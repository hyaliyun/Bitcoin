Historically on the boundary between the West Riding of Yorkshire and Cheshire, it is just inside the boundary of the Peak District National Park. The A6024 road between Holmfirth and Longdendale crosses the moor near its highest point close to Holme Moss transmitting station's prominent mast. Watershed Water seeping from the surrounding moorland into Rake Dike is the source of the River Holme. Rake Dike rising from Kay Edge on the moor flows through the village of Holme into Brownhill Reservoir, about a mile below the moor, and passes down through the Holme Valley to Huddersfield, where it flows into the River Colne. The upper part of the moor continues into Black Hill which is crossed by the Pennine Way north‚Äìsouth footpath.  Transmitting station  Holme Moss radio transmitter Holme Moss transmitting station is the highest in England. When erected it transmitted television signals that travelled much further than its intended service area. They were received on the Isle of Man and in parts of the Irish Republic, mainly Dublin and Wicklow. Now it provides VHF coverage for FM and DAB to a wide area around the transmitter including Derbyshire, Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire. The FM signals operate at 250 kW from one of the most powerful transmitters in the country with reception available as far north as the Borders, as far south as Birmingham, and to the east and west coasts. Emley Moor (55.44¬∞, 15.53 km) and Moorside Edge (348.22¬∞, 11.56 km) transmitters can be seen from the location. View from Holme Moss Transport In the winter Holme Moss frequently gets a covering of snow and the road over the moor is often the first in the area to be blocked. Kirklees Highways department clears the road as far as the border with Derbyshire. Derbyshire County Council Highways Authority is responsible for clearing the southern side. Sport=Athletics Holmfirth Harriers Athletics Club organise an annual \\"Holme Moss Fell Race\\" on and around Holme Moss in the summer. The race starts at Cartworth Moor cricket ground, crosses Ramsden Clough to Holme Moss, crosses and descends to Crowden before returning via Bareholme Moss, Laddow Rocks and Black Hill. Holme Moss in winter, viewed from Ramsden Road Cycling To British cycling enthusiasts, Holme Moss has become synonymous with the A6024 (Woodhead Road) which crosses the moor, between the village of Holmbridge to the north and the Woodhead Reservoir to the south. The northern side in particular is one of England's best known bicycle ascents, and has acquired a reputation as among the country's more difficult climbs. It has often been used for domestic competition in British road racing and mountain biking. =Climbs= Starting from Holmfirth, to the north, the climb is long, gaining in altitude, at an average gradient of 5.6%, although the penultimate kilometre is at a gradient of 11%. From the south, the climb starts at the junction with the A628, from where it is long, with a height gain of at an average gradient of 6.9%. =\\"Le Col de Moss\\"= Although not comparable in distance with the cols of European bicycle racing, the length and difficulty of Holme Moss relative to other British climbs has made it a frequent and popular inclusion in British races, including the Tour of Britain. For many years the (now defunct) Leeds Classic race saw internationally renowned riders (many of them, such as Bjarne Riis, veterans of the Tour de France) tackling the climb. =Tour de France= The second stage of the 2014 Tour de France followed the route across the Pennines to Derbyshire.

While widely attributed to Winston Churchill, the origins of the phrase are unclear. The phrase The phrase \\"the darkest hour\\" for this period, drawing on the proverb that \\"the darkest hour is just before the dawn\\", is usually ascribed to Winston Churchill, though there is no evidence he coined the phrase. Churchill had used a similar phrase at the time, though at the time he was referring specifically to the situation of France rather than to the United Kingdom. In his 'finest hour' speech, on 16 June 1940, Churchill described the collapse of France following the German invasion as \\"the darkest hour in French history\\";Their Finest Hour at The Churchill Centre website he had used similar terms when meeting with members of the Supreme War Council a week earlier. Writing after the war, in 1949, he described the period just before Dunkirk as \\"the darkest moment\\", and the period 1940-41 generally as \\"the darkest hours\\".. Dunkirk ref p. 79, 460 However, presumably due to the proverb, use of the phrase was widespread at the time. A little before Churchill's speech, it was being used to describe the current situation in sources as widely spread as the leader column of the Berwick Advertiser (30 May) and the New Zealand parliament (13 June). It is not clear when it became firmly associated with the United Kingdom specifically, or attributed to Churchill. Historical context Following the Fall of France in June 1940, and the evacuation of the British Army from Dunkirk, the British Empire was the only major power fighting against the Axis Powers in Europe. Through much of 1940, until victory in the Battle of Britain, the United Kingdom appeared to be under direct threat of invasion. Although the British Empire was the only major power fighting the Germans and Italians during the period, it was not the only major power fighting the Axis as a whole. China had been engaging the Imperial Japan since 1937, when the Japanese launched an all-out invasion. Some minor powers were also fighting the Germans and Italians: Greece fought the Axis powers from October 1940, when it defeated the Italian troops, to June 1941, when Crete surrendered to the Germans. Both Winston ChurchillWikiquote:Winston Churchill and Charles de Gaulle praised Greece's exceptional heroism at a point that many peoples were subjugated and the Axis seemed unbeatable. The United States did not formally become involved in the war on the Allied side until after the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Japanese on 7 December 1941. However, President Franklin D. Roosevelt clearly sympathized with Britain and other opponents of Germany, and he did what he could to quietly assist them within the confines of existing U.S. law, which mandated strict official neutrality, and in the face of strong isolationist sentiment, both among the public and Congress, which wanted the U.S. to stay out of the European and Asian conflicts. At Roosevelt's urging, a \\"cash-and-carry\\" provision allowed presidential approval of weapons sales to the belligerent nations, on the condition that the recipients both arranged for the transport and paid immediately with cash. The argument was that would not draw the U.S. into the conflict and so the provision was inserted into the Neutrality Act of 1937, which had been passed when war clouds were looming over Europe, and the Sino- Japanese conflict was already underway,The Neutrality Acts, 1930s, US: State Department, retrieved 5 June 2008. and after the provision officially lapsed in 1939, it was re-inserted into the follow-up Neutrality Act of 1939. Public Resolution 54, 76th Congress, 54 Stat. 4 4 November 1939 Roosevelt believed that \\"cash-and-carry\\" would aid France and Great Britain in the event of a war with Germany since they were the only countries that controlled the seas and could take advantage of the provision. The Neutrality Acts, 1930s, US: State Department, retrieved 5 June 2008. The U.S. officially dropped its pretense of neutrality with the passage of the Lend-Lease Act in March 1941 and openly allowed arms sales to Britain, Free France, China and later, the Soviet Union and other Allied states.Ebbert, Jean, Marie-Beth Hall & Beach, Edward Latimer.

Filmed entirely in California, the film included scenes filmed in Sausalito, and at San Francisco's Fisherman's Wharf and other locations around the city. Impact was based on a story by film noir writer Jay Dratler. The supporting cast features Charles Coburn, Helen Walker, Anna May Wong, Philip Ahn and William Wright. Plot Ella Raines and Brian Donlevy in Impact Charles Coburn and Helen Walker The San Francisco- based millionaire industrialist Walter Williams (Brian Donlevy) has a young wife, Irene (Helen Walker), who is trying to kill him with the help of her young lover, Jim Torrence (Tony Barrett). After Walter and Irene make plans to drive to Lake Tahoe, Irene feigns illness and asks Walter to instead give Torrence, who is pretending to be Irene's \\"cousin\\" from Illinois, a lift to Denver, allowing Torrence a chance to murder Walter en route. The plan falls apart when Williams survives a hit on the head from the would-be killer. Attempting to flee the scene in Williams' Packard convertible, Torrence dies in a fiery head-on collision with a gasoline tanker truck. The body of Torrence is mistakenly identified as Williams. In the meantime, Irene has made reservations at a hotel in Oakland for her and her boyfriend to meet afterward, under the assumed names of \\"Mr. & Mrs. Jack Burns\\". The wounded, dazed Williams falls asleep in the back of a moving van and ends up in the small town of Larkspur, Idaho. Using the name \\"Bill Walker\\", he gets a job as a service station mechanic and falls in love with Marsha Peters (Ella Raines), a young widow who is the station's owner. Meanwhile, the police arrest Williams' wife for his \\"murder\\". Williams eventually tells Marsha the truth, and she persuades him to go back to clear his wife, but when he does he is charged with murdering Torrence. Marsha enlists the help of kindly police detective Quincy (Charles Coburn) to prove Walter's innocence. With the additional evidence of the housekeeper Su Lin (Anna May Wong) the key and hotel registration are found and Walter is freed. His wife is then held for conspiracy to murder.

The actual town of Larkspur, California was used for filming the fictional town of Larkspur, Idaho. Several areas in and around Larkspur can be seen, including the Probert family's home and gas station at 234 and 238 Magnolia Avenue, the location that was recently occupied by The Tavern at Lark Creek. This was Anna May Wong's first screen appearance since 1942. Character actor Tom Greenway made his first appearance on screen as an unnamed moving van driver. Gossip reporter Sheilah Graham appears as herself, reading a news item about the case on the radio. Product placement In the 1940s, it was still uncommon for brand name products to be seen in movies, but this was a notable exception. A Bekins moving van is prominent in several scenes. The movie trade paper Harrison's Reports typically called attention to cases in which such products appeared on screen, and always took a stand against that practice. Although its review did not mention Bekins, the Harrison's review noted \\"advertising plugs worked in for such products as Pabst Blue Ribbon beer, Raleigh cigarettes, Coca-Cola, Mission Orange soda pop, Mobil gasoline, oil and tires, Gruen watches, and the trade name Rexall.\\"Harrison 1949, p. 46. In addition, Laykin et Cie (of I. Magnin & Co) is featured in the opening credits. Laykin et Cie was a leading West Coast jeweler during the period with an important salon in San Francisco during the time the movie was shot in 1948. In the opening scenes, Donlevy's character Walter Williams presents his wife with a custom Laykin et Cie intertwined diamond double heart brooch with the initials \\"IW\\" (for Irene Williams) which was produced for the film. Throughout the film, Irene Williams continues to wear various Laykin et Cie jewels of the period. Reception=Critical response At the time of release, the film critic for The New York Times, Bosley Crowther, in reviewing Impact panned the script and plot, writing, \\"If anyone seeing this picture is willing to string along with that as a fair definition of 'impact,' we can't vouch for the film's appeal to him. For it seems fairly obvious that the authors have geared their intellects to the suppositional level of that phony lexicon.

More recently, critic Gary W. Tooze praised Impact as the quintessential B film: \\"As far as 'modest' film noirs go, this is one of the best.

This concept broadly describes the negative consequences on the growth of the regions whose economies are primarily composed of branch plants that belong to multi-plant firms. Since the position of branch plants within the command chain is low, the regions that host these branch plants tended to be remotely controlled by the plant headquarters, which are usually located distantly. Authors at that time thought that branch plants might create a short-term boom in the regional economies when initial investments were deployed, or when they performed well owing to external factors such as the sector's expansion (e.g., the oil industry boom led to an economic boom in Aberdeen). That boom, however, did not sustain itself over the long term.Sonn, Jung Won and Dongheon Lee 2012 \\"Revisiting the branch plant syndrome: Review of literature on foreign direct investment and regional development in Western advanced economies\\", International Journal of Urban Sciences, 16(3) pp. 243-259 http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/12265934.2012.733589?journalCode=rjus20 In Scotland, it was mainly Scottish journalists and political readers who warned of the danger of Scotland's dependence on English firms' branches in Scotland. In Canada, an upsurge of Canadian nationalism in the 1960s and early 1970s led the Liberal governments of Lester Pearson and Pierre Trudeau to implement policies aimed at regulating foreign investment. The views of Walter L. Gordon were especially influential in the 1960s. Further left, the Waffle emerged in the New Democratic Party on a program based on Canadian economic nationalism and independence. These developments led to measures such as the creation of Petro-Canada, a government-owned oil and gas company, implemented by the Trudeau government in the mid-1970s to increase Canadian control over the oil industry. The crown corporation was created as one of the demands of the NDP in exchange for their support of Trudeau's minority government. Trudeau also established the Foreign Investment Review Agency to regulate foreign investment in the economy and limit the takeover of Canadian-owned companies by foreign multinational corporations. The election of Brian Mulroney's Progressive Conservative government in the 1984 election brought this period of economic nationalism to an end. Mulroney's government dismantled Foreign Investment Review Agency and moved to privatize Petro- Canada. The Mulroney government's negotiation and implementation of the Canada-US Free Trade Agreement resulted in increased economic integration between the US and Canada, and was opposed by economic nationalists in the 1988 election. The Canada-US FTA, the North American Free Trade Agreement and the World Trade Organization may bring branch plants to an end as the elimination of many tariffs and trade controls makes it much easier for a foreign supplier to sell in the Canadian market without having a branch plant in the country. Numerous plants, particularly in the textile and manufacturing sector, have shut down and moved to Mexico or other countries with lower wages and costs of production.

It first aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 8, 2005. Fantasia Barrino guest stars as Clarissa Wellington. Plot After being unable to shop at the Kwik-E-Mart because it is being held up, Lisa suggests the Simpsons have a vegetarian meal with ingredients purchased from a nearby stall, which they enjoy until Bart, Homer, Marge, and Maggie feel queasy and begin vomiting. Because she is a vegetarian, Lisa is immune to the \\"vitamins, minerals, and trace amounts of bug feces\\". Lisa points out that the rest of them are so used to processed foods that their bodies were not prepared for organic foods. As the family sits on the couch, wrapped in blankets, Lisa feeds them dry toast, and gently sings them to sleep with the \\"Hush, Little Baby\\" song. The next morning, the family is feeling better, eating fried chicken while watching TV. They see Krusty make an endorsement for his \\"Li'l Starmaker\\" competition, a children's American Idol-style competition where the winner shall be animated in an episode of Itchy & Scratchy. Bart convinces Lisa to enter because he believes she has a great voice. At the competition, another child (played by guest star Fantasia Barrino) sings a perfect version of Lisa's planned song, \\"Hush, Little Baby\\" which is declared by Bart to sound like \\"Whitney Houston brought to life\\". Lisa starts to panic, but Homer comes to her rescue by going to the nearby music store and writing a song for her to sing. She sings the song \\"I'm Talking Springfield\\", which praises Springfield (except Ned Flanders), delighting the crowd. Soon, the competition enters its knockout stages. Homer, now Lisa's manager, starts using every means at his disposal to make Lisa feel comfortable. He even gets her the right spotlight by beating up the technician. The competition progresses and contestants are eliminated, leaving just fan favorites Cameron and Lisa in the final to take place the next week. However, Homer's aggressive treatment of staff at the competition makes Lisa mad. As a result, Lisa fires him as her manager, causing him to be upset. Later that night, as the rest of the family eat dinner, Homer enters to announce that he has become Cameron's manager. Lisa is sad that Homer is upset with her. During the competition final, Lisa sings a song that she has written herself, called \\"Always My Dad\\", dedicated to Homer. The song expresses how much she loves her dad, and how sorry she is for hurting him. After she finishes, everyone loves it. Cameron, now restyled by Homer as \\"Johnny Rainbow\\", then goes up, and sings a rather condescending song called \\"Privileged Boy\\" that Homer wrote. The lyrics say how much better he is than the audience. Cameron is booed off the stage, with a few rotten vegetables as an accompaniment. Lisa is thrilled that Homer sabotaged Cameron in order to help her gain the prize. He tells her that he will always be there for her. During the closing credits, Homer teaches Lisa the jazz hands routine, which he taught Cameron earlier, for her next performance. Maggie joins in as well, though does stumble at first before picking up the routine.

He batted and threw right- handed. Professional baseball career Otis was initially drafted by the Boston Red Sox in 1965 as a shortstop. However, he spent time in the outfield, third base, and first base while playing in the minors. In November 1966, the Mets drafted him and he jumped all the way to Class AAA in 1967. He saw some time with the Mets late in the 1967 season, but he spent 1968 at AAA again before making the major league roster in 1969. When the Braves asked for Otis when trying to trade Joe Torre, the Mets refused and Torre wound up going to the St. Louis Cardinals instead. Otis immediately clashed with Mets manager Gil Hodges, who tried to make him a third baseman. After four games, Otis was sent back to the minors for a month. At the end of the season, Royals general manager Cedric Tallis sent third baseman Joe Foy to the Mets, in exchange for the young Otis. Foy was bogged down by drug problems and was out of baseball by 1971. Meanwhile, the Royals immediately moved Otis to center field, and he became the starter for most of the 1970s. He made the American League All-Star team in each of his first four years with the team and won three Gold Gloves. His speed worked well with the Royals' team philosophy of speed and defense. On September 7, 1971, he became the first player since 1927 to steal five bases in one game. He led the American League with 52 stolen bases that year. Otis scored the final run ever at Kansas City's Municipal Stadium in the fifth inning on October 4, 1972. He hit as many as 26 homers in a season, knocked in 90 runs or more three times, twice led the AL in doubles and once in stolen bases with 52. He compiled a career total of 341 steals, while being caught stealing 93 times. Otis was a clutch performer, and he consistently produced for the Royals as the team became a perennial contender. Otis (left) with Gerald Ford in 1976 On September 12, 1977, Otis helped eight youths who were stranded after a Royals game had been rained out when flooding prevented the boys' parents picking them up. \\"If it was my kids\\", Otis said, \\"I would have wanted someone to do something for them, too.\\" Otis hit .478 with three home runs and seven runs batted in the 1980 World Series. He set a record for putouts in a game by an outfielder in Game 3, a contest in which he also homered. He is one of two players (along with Alex Bregman; 2017) to drive in a run in each of his first five World Series games. Later his offense began to decline, in part due to a hand injury. By the late 1970s and early 1980s his fielding skills had diminished, and he lost his center field job to Willie Wilson near the end of his long run with the Royals. In 1983, he left the team before the season ended when told he was not in the Royals' future plans. Otis, circa 1977 He spent most of 1984 in the National League with the Pittsburgh Pirates. It was a quiet end to a successful career. In a 17-season career, Otis posted a .277 batting average, with 193 home runs and 1,007 RBI in 1,998 games while stealing 341 bases. Defensively, he recorded a .991 fielding percentage and 126 assists, primarily as a center fielder. He worked for the San Diego Padres and Colorado Rockies as a hitting instructor, and he has retired to Las Vegas. Otis still attends Royals reunions, and he dons a uniform to play in alumni games. In the early 1990s, Otis admitted that he used a corked bat during part of his Major League career.

Al Jean claims that the recorded commentary for this episode was the last time he saw Don Payne, the writer credited for the episode. Plot Marge tries to get the kids hair cuts, but is stopped when Homer takes them to get haircuts at a new barbershop in the mall. The kids' haircuts are done so badly, that they hide with Homer in a movie theater showing the film Left Below. In response to the kids losing their hair, Marge later makes them wigs using the leftover hair trimmings. Homer now fears that the Rapture will soon be coming. Despite being consoled by Marge and Lisa (who think God would not end the world unless he announced it), Homer encounters signs suggestive of the Rapture. He uses numerology to calculate the date and time of the Rapture and concludes that it is only a week away. Homer predicts that \\"stars will fall from the sky\\", then a blimp accident at the Krusty Celebrity Salute to Specials makes some celebrities (or \\"stars\\") fall to their deaths. His prophecy causes many of Springfield's residents to believe that the world will end and they go with him to the Springfield Mesa to wait for the Rapture. The hour passes without incident, and the people go home. All of them are annoyed at Homer, particularly Moe, who had sold his tavern to be converted to a Japanese sushi bar. Homer goes home and realizes that he has made an error in his calculation, so he returns to the Mesa with no support after getting ostracized by his family. Suddenly, he finds himself naked and ascending into Heaven. Homer arrives in Heaven, where he is greeted by the tour guide who shows him around. He is then shown to his room where he requests to see his family on the big TV screen in his room. Marge and the children are shown being tormented by the devil. He has a talk with God about saving his family. When God refuses to help, due to Jesus' suffering on Earth, Homer becomes angry. He runs around vandalizing Heaven and gets stopped by security. God finally agrees to undo the Rapture by turning back time. Homer later wakes up on the mesa and is reunited with his family, also discovering Moe's Tavern to curiously be back in its normal set up. Reception Don Payne was nominated for a Writers Guild of America Award for Outstanding Writing in Animation at the 58th Writers Guild of America Awards for his script to this episode.

(2006). International Financial Law Review, , 1. Features An income fund is a type of asset allocation fund. Income funds are often assumed to be bond funds, but they may be stock funds instead, more accurately called equity income funds. Typically these hold stocks with a good history of paying dividends. In fact, a typical income fund holds both stocks and bonds, to gain some of the strengths of both. The point in any case is that the investor is more interested in income than capital gains, perhaps with the intention the fund will never be sold. Income funds are often used as the endpoint for target-date funds. As each target-date fund approaches and passes its target date, it becomes more similar to the fund provider's income fund. At some point past the target date, the target-date fund may be merged into the income fund, which will then be owned by all investors whose target dates are some time in the past.

Probably dating from the 2nd century CE, it was within the canon of the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church, but not rediscovered in the Western world until the early 20th century. In 51 chapters, it takes the form of a letter from the apostles describing key events of the life of Jesus, followed by a dialogue between Jesus and the apostles. The work's apparent intent is to uphold orthodox Christian doctrine, refuting Gnosticism - in particular the teachings of Cerinthus - and docetism. Although presented as having been written shortly after the Resurrection, it refers to Paul of Tarsus. It offers predictions of the fall of Jerusalem and of the Second Coming. Origin The text is commonly dated to the 2nd century, perhaps towards the middle of it. (See New Testament Apocrypha: Gospels and related writings, Volume 1. Wilhelm Schneemelcher, ed., Westminster John Knox Press, 1991 , p. 251). CE Hill (1999) dates the Epistle to \\"just before 120, or in the 140s\\" and places \\"... the Epistula in Asia Minor in the first half of the second century.\\" CE Hill, 1999, The Epistula Apostolorum: An Asian Tract from the Time of Polycarp, p.1 The text was used regularly by the relatively isolated Ethiopian Orthodox Church, and was evidently not considered heretical. The work was lost to the West until 1895 when major portions of it were discovered in the Coptic language and a complete version translated into Ethiopic was discovered and published in the early 20th century. The fragmentary Coptic manuscript of the 5th or 4th century, is believed to be translated directly from the original Greek. One leaf of a Latin palimpsest, dating to the 5th century has also been identified as deriving from the same text.M.R. James, The Apocryphal New Testament (Oxford, 1924) 485-503. Format The text is framed as a letter from the 11 apostles to the worldwide church, as a report from Jesus involving a dialogue between them and Jesus, which occurs between Jesus's resurrection and ascension. The first 20% (10 chapters) begins by describing the nativity, resurrection, and miracles of Jesus, this framing is only done extremely superficially. The remainder of the text recounts a vision and dialogue between Jesus and the apostles, consisting of about sixty questions, and 41 short chapters. The text is by far the largest epistle in either the New Testament or Apocrypha. Content The text itself appears to be based on parts of the New Testament, in particular the Gospel of John, as well as the Apocalypse of Peter, Epistle of Barnabas, and Shepherd of Hermas, all of which were considered inspired by various groups or individuals during periods of the early church. Countering Gnosticism The whole text seems to have been intended as a refutation of the teachings of Cerinthus, although \\"Simon\\" (probably Simon Magus) is also mentioned. The content heavily criticises Gnosticism, although it does so not so much as a polemic against it, as an attempt to shore up the faith of non-Gnostics against conversion to Gnosticism. In particular the text uses the style of a discourse and series of questions with a vision of Jesus that was popular among Gnostic groups, so as to appeal to the same readers. However, the text is at pains to point out that it is not a secret teaching, that the content applies universally rather than to one group, and that everyone can easily come to learn its content, strongly differing with the esoteric mysteries inherent in Gnosticism. =Parable of the foolish virgins= One of the most important parts in this respect is the parable of foolish virgins: The Resurrection Other polemical features include emphasising the physical nature of the resurrection, to counter docetism, by having the apostles place their fingers in the print of the nails, in the spear wound in his side, and checking for footprints (like similar imagery in the Gospel of John, having the appearance of design to specifically counter docetism rather than to reflect history). Fully 20% of the text is devoted to confirming the doctrine of resurrection of the flesh, in direct conflict with the Gospel of Truth's criticism of this stance; it states that the resurrection of the flesh happens before death, which is to be understood esoterically. When Jesus is questioned further on this point, he becomes quite angry, suggesting that the pseudonymous author of the epistle found the Gnostics' stance both offensive and infuriating. Allusions to Paul Since the text is ostensibly written in name of the apostles from the period immediately after Jesus' resurrection, it necessarily excludes Paul of Tarsus from the category \\"apostle\\". However, given the importance of Paul and his writings to the mainstream church, it is not surprising that the author of the text chose to put in a prediction of Paul's future coming. The description of the healing of Paul's blindness in Acts by Ananias is changed to healing by the hands of one of the apostles, so that Paul is thus subordinate to them. Prophecies The work quotes an ancient prophecy about a new Jerusalem arising from Syria and the old Jerusalem being captured and destroyed (as happened in 70). This latter prophecy is likely to have been invented, as it is unknown in any previous texts. One of the reasons that the text probably fell into disuse by the mainstream churches is that its claim that the Second Coming shall be 150 years after the time of the vision to the apostles obviously failed to occur. Whether the text was ever considered heretical by the Catholic churches is unknown, as there are no clear references to it in the extant ancient Christian literature. However, the Ethiopian Orthodox Church evidently accepted it as basic orthodoxy.  Bibliography  *Epistula Apostolorum, introduction by C.D.G.

Chinese export porcelain includes a wide range of Chinese porcelain that was made (almost) exclusively for export to Europe and later to North America between the 16th and the 20th century. Whether wares made for non- Western markets are covered by the term depends on context. Chinese ceramics made mainly for export go back to the Tang dynasty if not earlier, though initially they may not be regarded as porcelain. It is typically not used as a descriptive term for the much earlier wares that were produced to reflect Islamic taste and exported to the Middle East and Central Asia, though these were also very important, apparently driving the development of Chinese blue and white porcelain in the Yuan and Ming dynasties (see Chinese influences on Islamic pottery). Longquan celadon, which is mostly not porcelain on Western definitions, is one of the wares to produce large dishes that reflected Islamic dining habits, rather than the deeper bowls used by the Chinese. In general wares made for export, especially in the early periods, were \\"mainly strong and rather roughly-finished articles\\",Hobson, R. L., The Wares of the Ming Dynasty, \\"Preface\\", 2nd edn, 1962 compared to those for the elite domestic market, to allow for the stresses of transport, and less sophisticated customers. Other types of Chinese wares made mainly for export to other markets may or may not be covered; they are certainly described as export wares in discussing the Chinese industry, but much discussion in Western sources only refers to wares intended for Europe. The other types include Swatow ware (c. 1575-1625), made for South-East Asian and Japanese markets, and Tianqi porcelain, made mainly for the Japanese market in the 17th century. Chinese celadons were exported to most of Eurasia, but not Europe, between roughly the Tang and the early Ming dynasties. It took some time for feedback from export markets to influence the shapes and decoration of the Chinese product, especially in earlier periods, and with distant markets such as Europe. Initially markets were sent what the Chinese market, or older exports markets, liked. With the increasing reach of European trading companies, especially the Dutch VOC, this became possible, and eventually even specific armorial designs could be ordered from Europe.  Wares for Europe, to the 18th century  European visitors to Istanbul in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries are recorded as having purchased Chinese porcelain there.Meister, p 17 Some other pieces came via the Portuguese settlement of Malacca; King Manuel I had several acquired from Vasco da Gama. The Chamber of Art and Curiosities at Ambras Castle contains the collection of Archduke Ferdinand II of Austria, assembled during the mid-15th century. These early collections, typically of blue-and-white ware, were regarded as rare curios and art objects, and were often mounted in precious metals. Canton, 1756. Wares include Kraak porcelain, Swatow ware, Transitional porcelain, armorial porcelain, Canton porcelain, and Chinese Imari, which were all largely or entirely made for export, as well as other types that were also sold to the domestic market. This group included Yixing stonewares, Blanc de Chine, blue and white porcelain, and famille verte, noire, jaune and rose. Chinese export porcelain was generally decorative, but without the symbolic significance of wares produced for the Chinese home market. Except for the rare Huashi soft paste wares, traditionally Chinese porcelain was made using kaolin and petuntse. While rim chips and hairline cracks are common, pieces tend not to stain. Chinese wares were usually thinner than those of the Japanese and did not have stilt marks. In the 16th century, Portuguese traders began importing late Ming dynasty blue and white porcelains to Europe, resulting in the growth of the Kraak porcelain trade (named after the Portuguese ships called carracks in which it was transported). In 1602 and 1604, two Portuguese carracks, the San Yago and Santa Catarina, were captured by the Dutch and their cargos, which included thousands of items of porcelain, were sold off at an auction, igniting a European interest for porcelain. Buyers included the Kings of England and France. After this, a number of European nations established companies trading with the countries of East Asia, the most significant for the porcelain being the Dutch East India Company or VOC. Between 1602 and 1682 the company carried between 30 and 35 million pieces of Chinese and Japanese export porcelain.Volker, T. (1954) Porcelain and the Dutch East India Company London; Victoria & Albert Museum The English East India Company also imported around 30 million pieces, the French East India Company 12 million, the Portuguese East India Company 10 million and the Swedish East India Company some 20 million pieces between 1766 and 1786.Meister, p 18 The trade continued until the mid-17th century when the Ming dynasty fell in 1644, and civil war disrupted porcelain production. European traders then turned to Japanese export porcelain instead, though much of that was still traded through Chinese ports. However, the Chinese had reasserted their dominance by the 1740s. Dutch 17th-century still-life painting by Jan Jansz. Treck, showing late Ming blue and white porcelain export bowls, 1649. As valuable and highly prized possessions, pieces of Chinese export porcelain appeared in many 17th century Dutch paintings. The illustration (right) shows a painting by Jan Jansz. Treck that includes two Kraak-style bowls, probably late Ming, the one in the foreground being of a type the Dutch called klapmuts. The blue pigment used by the artist has faded badly since the picture was painted. Under the Kangxi Emperor's reign (1662‚Äì1722) the Chinese porcelain industry, now very largely concentrated at Jingdezhen was reorganised and the export trade soon flourished again. Chinese export porcelain from the late 17th century included Blue and white and 'famille verte wares (and occasionally famille noire and Famille jaune). Wares included garnitures of vases, dishes, teawares, ewers, and other useful wares along with figurines, animals and birds. Blanc de Chine porcelains and Yixing stonewares arriving in Europe and gave inspiration to many European potters. The massive increase in imports allowed purchasers to amass large collections, which were often displayed in dedicated rooms or purpose-built structures. The Trianon de Porcelaine built between 1670 and 1672 was a Baroque pavilion constructed to display Louis XIV's collection of blue-and-white porcelain, set against French blue-and-white faience tiles both on the interior and exterior of the building. It was demolished in 1687. For the potters of Jingdezhen the manufacture of porcelain wares for the European export market presented new difficulties. Writing from the city in 1712, the French Jesuit missionary P√®re Fran√ßois Xavier d'Entrecolles records that \\"...the porcelain that is sent to Europe is made after new models that are often eccentric and difficult to reproduce; for the least defect they are refused by the merchants, and so they remain in the hands of the potters, who cannot sell them to the Chinese, for they do not like such pieces\\". In the later 18th century, as European porcelain factories became established, there was more competition, and the quality of export wares declined, with many using fussy and over-elaborate shapes and decoration. So-called Canton porcelain was made as \\"blanks\\" at Jingdezhen, then carried to Canton where it was painted in styles designed for Western markets at the Thirteen Factories, often including armorial porcelain for dining wares, with the design of the coat of arms of the buyer sent out from Europe and copied.  Wares and figurines  18th-century Chinese export porcleain, Guimet Museum, Paris. Although European crests on Chinese porcelain can be found on pieces made as early as the 16th century, around 1700 the demand for armorial porcelain increased dramatically. Thousands of services were ordered with drawings of individuals' coat of arms being sent out to China to be copied and shipped back to Europe and, from the late 18th century, to North America. Some were lavishly painted in polychrome enamels and gilding, while others, particularly later examples, might incorporate only a small crest or monogram in blue and white. Chinese potters copied the popular Japanese Imari porcelains, which continued to be made for export into the second half of the 18th century, examples being recovered as part of the Nanking cargo from the shipwreck of the Geldermalsen. Qing export porcelain with European Christian scene, 1725‚Äì1735. A wide variety of shapes, some of Chinese or Islamic origin, others copying faience or metalwork were made. Oriental figurines included Chinese gods and goddesses such as Guanyin (the goddess of mercy) and Budai (the god of contentment), figurines with nodding heads, seated monks and laughing boys as well as figurines of Dutch men and women. From the mid-18th century, even copies of Meissen figurines such as Tyrolean dancers were made for export to Europe. Birds and animals, including cows, cranes, dogs, eagles, elephants, pheasants, monkeys and puppies, were popular. From around 1720, the new famille rose palette was adopted and quickly supplanted the earlier Famille Verte porcelains of the Kangxi period. Famille rose enamels for the export market included the Mandarin Palette. Specific patterns such as tobacco leaf and faux tobacco leaf were popular as were, from around 1800, Canton decorated porcelain with its figures and birds, flowers and insects. Many other types of decoration such as encre de chine or Jesuit wares, made for Christian missionaries. One significant and diverse group of export wares is those with European subject designs copied from Western prints taken out to China. Well known examples include the Judgement of Paris, the Baptism of Christ and many others with portraits, mythological scenes, pastoral scenes, topographical views and literary and anecdotal images. About a thousand such 'European subject' designs are known from the long 18th century. Many of the original print sources have been identified though many remain to be found. Other examples include the Sydney punchbowls from the Macquarie era in Australia, 1810‚Äì1820.  Later trade  Qing export porcelain with European figure, famille rose, first half of the 18th century. As trade with China developed, finer quality wares were shipped by private traders who rented space on the ships of the companies trading with the country. The bulk export wares of the 18th century were typically teawares and dinner services, often blue and white decorated with flowers, pine, prunus, bamboo or with pagoda landscapes, a style that inspired the willow pattern. They were sometimes clobbered (enamelled) in the Netherlands and England to enhance their decorative appeal. By the late 18th century, imports from China had declined due to changing tastes and competition from new European factories, which used mass- production. Highly decorative Canton porcelain was produced throughout the 19th century, but the quality of wares waned. By the end of the century, blue and white wares in the Kangxi style were produced in large quantities and almost every earlier style and type was copied into the 20th century. In modern times, historic Chinese export porcelain is popular with the international fine arts market, though recently less so than wares made for the domestic market. In 2016, collections were auctioned for tens of millions USD, through companies such as Sotheby's and Christie's. In recent decades, modern porcelain production for export, mainly of basic household wares in contemporary styles, has increased enormously and once again become an important industry for China. Production of imitations of historic wares also continues.

Cardozo/Shaw neighborhood) of northwest D.C. It is known locally for its chili dogs, half-smokes, and milkshakes, and has been an integral part of the neighborhood's history since its founding in 1958. It was frequented by both police and protesters during the 1968 Washington, D.C. riots, and is regularly visited by celebrities, such as Anthony Bourdain and Chris Tucker. In January 2009, Washington, D.C. Mayor Adrian Fenty took then President-elect Barack Obama to eat at Ben's as part of his welcome to the city. History Ben's Chili Bowl was founded on August 22, 1958,Ali, Virginia R. (April 3, 1988). \\"Burned Into the Future; Before April 4, 1968, Washington was a tranquil but segregated town. After the riots, everything changed. Six Washingtonians look back\\". The Washington Post. p. W28. by Ben Ali, a Trinidadian-born immigrant who had studied dentistry at nearby Howard University, and his fianc√©e, Virginia-born Virginia Rollins. The two were married seven weeks after opening the restaurant. The building they chose was that of Washington's first silent movie house, the Minnehaha, which was established in 1911.Virtual Duke Ellington's Washington: Tour of Shaw: Ben's Chili Bowl, PBS The building is a contributing property to the Greater U Street Historic District. Most of the furniture in the restaurant is original to the 1950s.Vorhees, Mara, Ben's chili and hot dogs have time-tested appeal, The Boston Globe, 28 January 2004 At the time, U Street was known as \\"Black Broadway\\". Many jazz greats of the day, such as Duke Ellington, Miles Davis, and Nat King Cole, would stop by the restaurant when they performed at U Street clubs. The U Street corridor was devastated by the April 1968 riots that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr.Transcript: Ben's Chili Bowl Celebrates 45th Anniversary, CNN, aired 22 August 2003 During the riots, black activist Stokely Carmichael, leader of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee, asked Ben to keep his restaurant open, and the Alis obtained permission to stay open past curfew. The restaurant fed both the police officers and firemen working to impose order on the neighborhood, as well as the black activists. The violence and arson reached such an extent that Ben wrote \\"Soul Brother\\" in soap on the front window in the hopes that it would stop the angry mobs. Another view of the iconic facade The destruction of so many businesses led to the flight of residents towards the suburbs and the economic decline of the neighborhood through the mid-1970s to mid-1980s. As the area became known for its drug addicts, Ben's Chili Bowl reduced its staff to one employee. Ben and Virginia's son Kamal recalled, \\"We stayed and had a following, because the Chili Bowl was like the neighborhood barbershop. People would sit here and chat. There was always a family presence and the locals protected us.\\" The restaurant stopped serving pies and cakes, which attracted addicts, while police conducted surveillance on drug dealers from an upstairs window of the building. The extensive construction of the U Street Metro station across the street from the restaurant, completed in 1991, forced still more U Street businesses to close, but Ben's Chili Bowl stayed open to feed the construction workers. The Washington Post commented that Ben's Chili Bowl is \\"probably the only business on this strip that survived both the 1968 riots and the construction phase of the Metro Green Line\\".Becton, Neal, City Guide: Ben's Chili Bowl, The Washington Post editorial review The Metro and lower crime rates helped the gradual revitalization and gentrification of the neighborhood. From the early 1990s, business revenues grew by 10% annually, to $1.5 million in 2005, and the number of employees at the restaurant grew as well, to a staff of 20.

The New York Post quoted Nizam Ali as saying, \\"We see this as part of being involved in what is good for the neighborhood, what's good for the city....It's a good idea that helps the environment and, it turns out, makes economic sense for all of us.\\" In 2008, Ben's Chili Bowl opened a second location in the newly built Nationals Park, though it has a more limited selection than the original restaurant. On October 7, 2009, Ben died at the age of 82. He and his wife, Virginia, had retired from the restaurant business, having passed daily operations of Ben's Chili Bowl to their sons, Kamal and Nizam. Ali's death was mourned in many ways throughout the city, including a written statement by Mayor Adrian Fenty, which read in part: \\"I am deeply saddened to hear of the passing of the founder and namesake of Ben's Chili Bowl, one of the greatest treasures in the District of Columbia. Ben Ali was a man who invested his life in a small business that weathered many storms and became the soul of a neighborhood and the pride of our city.\\"Stabley, Matthew, \\"Ben's chili bowl owner dead at 82: Ben's is a Washington landmark,\\" NBCWashington.com, Oct 8, 2009.

The Boston Globe described Ben's diverse customers as \\"punk-looking kids and fashionable business people and everyone in between\\". In 2001, Ben and Virginia's son, Kamal, commented on the changes of what types of people were eating at the establishment: \\"You hear comments. Even the white customers. They want to think they're the only whites who'd been hip enough to go to the Chili Bowl. Now they look around and there are a lot of other whites and they are not so happy about it.\\" Sign posted showing who eats for free. The most famous regular customer is comedian Bill Cosby, who took his future wife to Ben's when they were dating. He recalls that he first became a frequent visitor while serving in the Navy and stationed in Bethesda, Maryland in 1958, and frequently visited the U Street jazz clubs.Alexander, Keith L., \\"Ben's Celebrates Chili Power,\\" Washington Post, August 21, 2008. Cosby recalls that during some of his visits with Camille, who was then a student at the University of Maryland, he would \\"eat as many as six half-smokes at a time.\\" Cosby returned to Ben's in 1985 to hold a press conference in the restaurant to celebrate the success of his television series, The Cosby Show. He continues to stop by Ben's while in town for servings of half-smokes. A sign posted in the restaurant proclaimed that Bill Cosby is the only person who eats for free at Ben's Chili Bowl. On November 3, 2008, a new sign was posted to add \\"the Obama family\\". Starting in 2012 a large mural featuring Cosby adorned the building, but was removed in January 2017 amid sexual assault allegations against the comedian. Many other celebrities, including Chris Tucker and Bono, have visited over the years. When journalist Ted Koppel stopped hosting news program Nightline, he held his 2005 farewell party at the restaurant. Then-President-elect Barack Obama ate at Ben's on January 10, 2009. The Washington Post asserts, \\"By the late 1990s, no D.C. politician would dream of running for office without dropping into Ben's.\\" Anthony A. Williams appeared at Ben's immediately after his successful mayoral election.Description written by Tom Sietsema, writer for The Washington Post, and member of The James Beard Foundation Restaurant Awards Committee However, celebrities at Ben's are not limited to American citizens. In 1998, former DC mayor Marion Barry described having traveled to Ghana and meeting the Mayor of Accra, an alumnus of Howard University, whose greeting was, \\"Glad to have you in Accra. Is Ben's Chili Bowl still there?\\" And when French President Nicolas Sarkozy and his wife Carla Bruni-Sarkozy visited Washington, D.C. in March 2010, they reportedly each had two of Ben's half smokes during their visit to the restaurant.Cooper, Helene, \\"Sarkozys eat half-smokes at Ben's,\\" The Caucus, March 30, 2010.

In popular culture A Washington-based episode of the Travel Channel's Man v. Food (S02E12), which first aired in the summer of 2009, featured Ben's Chili Bowl as one of the stops. The host, Adam Richman, helped Nizam Ali prepare his chili before trying out a chili Half-Smoke; Richman sat in the same seat that President Barack Obama had sat in earlier in the year. In the 2009 movie State of Play, reporter Cal McAffrey (Russell Crowe) visits Ben's Chili Bowl and appears to be a regular customer.

He was born in Florence, South Carolina and is a graduate of Wilson High School. Lorenz is best known for his duet with recording artist Mariah Carey on \\"I'll Be There,\\" a cover of the 1970 number-one Jackson 5 recording of the same name. The record topped the US Billboard Hot 100 and R&B; singles chart a second time in 1992 and earned Lorenz and Carey both a Grammy Award nomination for Best R&B; Performance by a Duo or Group with Vocals. They would later perform the song again at the funeral of Michael Jackson on July 7, 2009. Biography Lorenz began his career supporting singer Mariah Carey on her first promotional tour in 1990, and the following year he provided background vocals on her album Emotions. Lorenz again served as Carey's backing singer on her March 16, 1992 appearance on the television show MTV Unplugged, where he and Carey sang a cover of the Jackson 5's \\"I'll Be There\\" - a duet the two reprised at Michael Jackson's memorial service at the Staples Center in Los Angeles, California on July 7, 2009. Their Unplugged performance was released as a single that went to number one in the United States. Lorenz also recorded a duet She Deserves It with Polish vocalist Basia on her gold U.S. album The Sweetest Illusion. In 1991, he co-wrote \\"If You Go Away\\" for New Kids on the Block, which was included on their last studio album, Face the Music.

The single \\"Someone to Hold\\" (co-written and co-produced by Carey, who also sang backup vocals) peaked at number nineteen on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100 singles chart. The album itself, however, performed poorly and only peaked at #111 on the Billboard 200 albums chart, and Lorenz was dropped by his label. Lorenz returned to a career in background vocals, working for artists such as TLC, Selena, and Usher and also performed a duet with Basia titled \\"She Deserves It\\" .

Francesco Ferruccio (or Ferrucci) (1489August 3, 1530) was an Italian captain from Florence who fought in the Italian Wars. Biography After spending a few years as a merchant's clerk he took to soldiering at an early age, and served his apprenticeship under Giovanni de' Medici, in the latter's Black Bands (Delle Bande Nere being Giovanni de' Medici's nickname, from the black stripes on his insignia) in various parts of Italy, earning a reputation as a daring fighter and swashbuckler. When Pope Clement VII and the emperor Charles V decided to reinstate the Medici in Florence, during the War of the League of Cognac, they attacked the Florentine Republic, and Ferruccio was appointed Florentine military commissioner, where he showed great daring and resource by his rapid marches and sudden attacks on the Imperials. Early in 1530 Volterra had thrown off Florentine allegiance and had been occupied by an Imperial garrison, but Ferruccio surprised and recaptured the city. During his absence, however, the Imperials captured Empoli by treachery, thus cutting off one of the chief avenues of approach to Florence. Ferruccio proposed to the government of the Republic that he should march on Rome and terrorize the Pope by the threat of a sack into making peace with Florence on favorable terms, but although the war committee appointed him commissioner-general for the operations outside the city, they rejected his scheme as too audacious. Ferruccio then decided to attempt a diversion by attacking the Imperials in the rear and started from Volterra for the Apennines. But at Pisa he was laid up for a month with a fever, which enabled the enemy to get wind of his plan and to prepare for his attack. At the end of July Ferruccio left Pisa at the head of about 4,000 men. Although the besieged in Florence, knowing that a large part of the Imperialists under the Prince of Orange Philibert of Ch√¢lon, had gone to meet Ferruccio, wished to co-operate with the latter by means of a sortie, they were prevented from doing so by their own treacherous commander, Malatesta Baglioni. Left alone, Ferruccio encountered a much larger force of the enemy on August 3 at Gavinana. In the desperate battle that ensued, the Imperials were at first driven back by Ferruccio's onslaught and the Prince of Orange himself was killed. But when 2,000 Landsknecht reinforcements under Fabrizio Maramaldo arrived, the Florentines were almost annihilated, and Ferruccio was wounded and captured. Maramaldo out of personal spite dispatched Ferruccio with his own hand: \\"Vile, tu uccidi un uomo morto!\\" (\\"Coward, you kill a dead man!\\") were, according to popular accounts,See the Fabrizio Maramaldo article for details on the actual words. Ferruccio's last words uttered to his murderer. This defeat sealed the fate of the Republic, and nine days later Florence surrendered. Maramaldo's deed earned him immortal infamy, even turning his own surname into a synonym for \\"villainous\\" in Italian, while the verb maramaldeggiare exists as well - meaning \\"to bully a defenseless victim\\". Posthumous myth L'Assedio di Firenze, the most famous novel of Francesco Domenico Guerrazzi, was based on and greatly glorified his life; he is indeed cited in \\"Il Canto degli Italiani\\", the national anthem of Italy composed in 1847 by Goffredo Mameli.

The book was published posthumously in 1948, 15 years after its predecessor. Fittingly, it is the longest book in the series, and the tone is the darkest; World War II took place before the book was published, during which Lofting had published his 1942 anti-war poem Victory for the Slain. The book contains passages that almost border on being misanthropic with some very powerful passages concerning war and Man's inhumanity to man. Style The book starts with the Doctor giving up his dream of lengthening human life with discoveries he made on the Moon, and showing signs of despair. The tone of the passages for the first time acknowledges 'nature red in tooth and claw': another of the Doctor's experiments, a house where scavengers and parasites can live without harming other creatures, is also doomed to failure. The Doctor then receives an urgent call to rescue what is literally his oldest friend: Mudface the Giant Turtle, who was a passenger on Noah's Ark. We finally hear Mudface's tale of the Great Flood which was missing from Lofting's 1923 novel Doctor Dolittle's Post Office. Mudface's account of the Flood and its aftermath takes up most of the book, and it is by no means a jolly story. There are many references to genocide and slavery; not to mention a passage where animals gather outside a hut to devour the humans inside (a young man and his beloved, who are the most sympathetic characters next to Mudface and his mate). Comedy is reduced to a mere sprinkling, just enough to lighten some of the more dark passages. The book stands alone in style but with, arguably, some of Hugh Lofting's most powerful writing. Also of note is that Lofting's depiction of African characters is far less caricatured than in previous novels.

Built in Bath, Maine The third U.S. Navy ship to be so named, Warrington (DD-843) was laid down on 14 May 1945 at Bath, Maine, by the Bath Iron Works Corporation; launched on 27 September 1945; sponsored by Mrs. Katherine Chubb Sheehan; and commissioned at the Boston Naval Shipyard on 20 December 1945, Comdr. Don W. Wulzen (later Rear Admiral) in command. Naval service=Post-World War II service Warrington conducted shakedown training and winter exercises in the West Indies during February and early March and then returned to Boston, Massachusetts, for duty in Destroyer Division (DesDiv) 82, Destroyer Squadron (DesRon) 8. During the next year, the destroyer cruised almost the length of the eastern seaboard plane-guarding for carriers such as . Late in the spring of 1946, she joined in an extended cruise to Europe and visited ports in England, Scotland, Sweden, Denmark, Belgium, Portugal, and the Netherlands before entering the Mediterranean for her first tour of duty with the U.S. 6th Fleet. That assignment ended on 8 February 1947 when she passed through the Strait of Gibraltar on her way back home. Warrington arrived at New York City on 19 February and entered the naval shipyard there for voyage repairs. At the conclusion of the yard work on 8 March, she steamed to her new home port, Newport, Rhode Island, and for two years cruised along the U.S. East Coast, serving primarily as gunnery training ship for the Atlantic Destroyer Force. In April 1949, the ship was reassigned to DesDiv 222, which she served as flagship, and to DesRon 22. Late that summer, she departed the New England coast for a two-month training voyage to the West Indies. After a brief stop at Norfolk, Virginia, at the conclusion of those maneuvers, Warrington headed north at the end of October for cold weather training near the Arctic Circle, returning to Newport on 20 November. On 3 January 1950, the destroyer sailed from Newport in company with her squadron and for hunter/killer exercises along the U.S. East Coast and in the vicinity of Bermuda. The following month, she conducted antisubmarine warfare (ASW) exercises with out of Newport News, Virginia, before returning to that port for a brief yard availability. The ship next returned north to Newport for a tour of duty with the Operational Development Force detachment during which her division tested ASW tactics in company with along the coast of Newfoundland and in the waters around Iceland. That assignment lasted from 10 July to 8 August, at which time she returned to Newport to prepare for her second deployment to the Mediterranean. That tour of duty lasted only two months and one day. The destroyer returned to Newport on 10 November and resumed normal east coast operations. Mediterranean cruise period In January 1951, Warrington changed from DesDiv 222 to DesDiv 142 for which she served as flagship. Over the next eight years, the destroyer settled into a fairly repetitive routine, alternating four deployments to the U.S. 6th Fleet with operations out of Newport. Her Mediterranean cruises came in the spring of 1952, the summers of 1954 and 1956, and in the spring of 1957. 12 January 1955, Warrington collided with near Puerto Rico. Her U.S. 2d Fleet duties consisted primarily of ASW training in company with U.S. Atlantic Fleet aircraft carriers and took her from the coast of New England south to the Caribbean and the West Indies. Providing cadet training In May 1959, Warrington was reassigned to DesDiv 102. In June, she embarked U.S. Naval Academy midshipmen at Annapolis, Maryland, for a unique training cruise. Instead of Europe or the West Indies, the area of activity for that voyage was the Great Lakes. Warrington passed through the newly constructed St. Lawrence Seaway and participated in the opening ceremonies for the waterway led by Queen Elizabeth II of Great Britain and President Dwight D. Eisenhower of the United States. At the conclusion of those ceremonies‚Äîheld at Montreal, Canada, on 26 June -- Warrington continued on her mission, visiting a series of American ports on the Great Lakes, including Chicago, Illinois, Detroit, Michigan, and Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan, among others before returning to Newport on 4 August. During the next 22 months, she performed her normal duties out of Newport. Exercises along the east coast occupied her for the remainder of 1959 and the beginning of 1960. On 21 March, she began another cruise with the 6th Fleet which also included a six-week assignment with the Middle East Force between 16 June and 28 July. She concluded her Mediterranean deployment at Rota, Spain, on 7 October and reentered Newport on the 15th. East coast operations‚Äîbroken only by a visit to Washington, D.C., in January 1961 for the inauguration of President John F. Kennedy and duty as a recovery ship for a Project Mercury test in February‚Äîdominated her schedule until late in the spring of 1961. 1961 modernization On 12 May, the destroyer entered the New York Naval Shipyard for major alterations during her Mark I Fleet Rehabilitation and Modernization (FRAM I) overhaul. Those modifications reflected the enormous technological advances registered in antisubmarine warfare since the end of World War II and might be considered the beginning of the final phase in the shift of mission for destroyers from a surface-attack role to that of a submarine hunter. Her superstructure silhouette changed markedly as she received a larger combat information center (CIC) and sonar control as well as an antisubmarine rocket (ASROC) launcher, a torpedo magazine, and a hangar and flight deck for the Gyrodyne QH-50 DASH, a drone antisubmarine helicopter. The new ASROC launcher was installed between the stacks in the space formerly held by her 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes which, in turn, were replaced by two 12.75-inch triple torpedo tube mounts located on the 01 level forward of the bridge ‚Äî one to port and the other to starboard. These MK 32 mounts replaced the second 5-inch 38-caliber gun mount forward. The DASH flight deck and hangar, along with the ASROC/torpedo magazine was installed just aft of the after stack. Her surface battery was thus reduced to two twin 5-inch, 38-caliber in twin mounts. East coast operations Warrington's FRAM conversion took eight days short of a year. She emerged from the New York Naval Shipyard on 4 May 1962 and began various post-conversion qualifications and tests which culminated in refresher training in the Guantanamo Bay area during June and July. After two weeks at the Fleet Sonar School at Key West, Florida, she returned to Newport on 12 August to begin duty with the Atlantic Fleet's ASW forces. Over the next 27 months, Warrington's east coast operations routine‚Äîannual \\"Springboard\\" operations in the Caribbean and ASW training evolutions out of Newport‚Äîwas spiced up by a series of special assignments. On 19 September 1962, she got underway to serve as a unit of the recovery group for Lt. Comdr. Walter Schirra's \\"Sigma Seven\\" space flight which took place on 3 October. Later that month, when the Cuban Missile Crisis occurred, the destroyer joined a special ASW task group which, though it did not participate in the actual quarantine, performed a support role for the ships so engaged. Searching for the Thresher During early April 1963, the warship helped to conduct the unsuccessful search-and-rescue attempt prompted by the loss of the nuclear-powered submarine during deep- submergence tests. After a summer of operations out of Newport, Warrington got underway for the Indian Ocean on 1 October. Steaming via the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean, she arrived in Karachi, Pakistan, at the end of the first week in November. For the next fortnight, the destroyer joined other United States and CENTO powers' ships in Operation \\"Midlink VI.\\" She began the voyage home on 23 November and, after stops at several ports, returned to Newport on 23 December. Collision with USS Barry The first eight months of 1964 brought 2d Fleet operations, broken only by a repair period at Norfolk and another later one at Boston following her collision with on 25 July. Between 8 September and 18 December, the ship made another brief deployment to the Mediterranean, highlighted by Operation \\"Masterstroke\\" and NATO Exercise \\"Teamwork\\" during the outbound voyage. While conducting the latter operation, Warrington briefly ventured north of the Arctic Circle. Warrington returned to Newport on 18 December 1964 and began almost two years of operations along the east coast‚Äîprimarily ASW training evolutions‚Äîas well as occasional cruises to the Caribbean area for \\"Springboard\\" operations, gunnery drills, and refresher training. That duty ended late on 4 October 1966 when the destroyer stood out of Newport to deploy to the Far East. Reassigned to the Pacific Ocean She transited the Panama Canal on 9 October, stopped at Pearl Harbor on 24 October, and arrived at Yokosuka, Japan, on 10 November. That same day, she headed for the Tonkin Gulf in company with and . On 21 November, she relieved on \\"Traffic Cop\\" station off the coast of North Vietnam. Operation Traffic Cop, soon to be redesignated Operation Sea Dragon, was an ongoing patrol to interdict waterborne logistics to the insurgents in South Vietnam. After 13 days of \\"Traffic Cop\\" duty, Warrington put into Danang on 3 December before sailing later that same day for Kaohsiung, Taiwan. There she spent another 13 days undergoing a tender availability alongside before getting underway for Hong Kong on the 19th. On 26 December 1966, she departed Hong Kong to return to the Gulf of Tonkin, this time for plane guard duty with the fast carriers on Yankee Station. She continued that assignment until 19 January 1967 when she steamed south to the II Corps area of South Vietnam to provide naval gunfire support for troops of the 1st Cavalry Division conducting Operation Thayer II ashore. She completed that mission on 25 January and headed for Kaohsiung for another tender availability. Following a visit to Hong Kong and another repair period‚Äîat Subic Bay in the Philippines‚Äîthe destroyer resumed plane guard duty in the Gulf of Tonkin on 27 February. On 10 March, she parted company with the carrier to conduct a gunfire support mission in the III Corps zone near Rung Sat. She completed that task early on 24 March and set a course for Subic Bay. There, the warship rendezvoused with USS Keppler, USS Manley, and for the voyage home. The four destroyers began their journey home on 26 March, heading west across the Indian Ocean rather than east back across the Pacific Ocean. On their way, they stopped at Singapore and Massawa in Ethiopia, transited the Suez Canal, stopped at Palma Majorca, Spain, Naples, Italy and then steamed across the Mediterranean Sea, and visited Ponta Delgada in the Azores before arriving back in Newport on 8 May. Return to East Coast operations The ensuing years brought a return to the familiar routine of east coast operations alternated with deployments to the 6th Fleet in the Mediterranean. After eight months of training, readiness inspections, and the other normal evolutions of duty out of Newport, RI \\"Warrington\\" departed the United States in mid-February 1968, bound for a four-month tour of duty with the 6th Fleet. During that deployment, she visited a number of Mediterranean and Northern European ports. The Mediterranean ports included Naples Italy, Golfe-Juan France, Valleta Malta, Palma Majorca and Rota Spain (for two hours). The Northern European ports included, Rotterdam The Netherlands, Bremen Germany and Bergen Norway. Warrington returned to the United States on 14 June 1968 and operated out of Newport until October. On the 18th, she entered the Boston Naval Shipyard for a five-month overhaul. She completed her post-overhaul sea trials between 27 March and 3 April 1969 and returned to Newport on 5 April. Between 10 April and 27 June, the warship voyaged to the West Indies to conduct gunnery drills at Culebra Island and refresher training out of Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. She returned to Newport on 27 June and spent the major portion of the summer and the entire fall in an extended upkeep and in preparations for overseas movement. On 2 November, the destroyer stood out of Newport and headed back to the Mediterranean. During that assignment, her primary mission was to observe units of the Soviet Navy operating in the eastern Mediterranean. However, she also made goodwill visits and liberty calls at ports all along the Mediterranean coastline. On 13 May 1970, Warrington completed her tour of duty with the 6th Fleet and began her journey home. She reentered Newport on 22 May and began post-deployment leave and upkeep. Following a month of repairs at Boston late in July and early in August, the warship spent most of the remainder of the year in Newport, though she did get underway for two brief periods at sea‚Äîonce in September for the America's Cup yachting race and again in October to escort during the carrier's post-repair acceptance trials. On 14 January, Warrington embarked upon a two-month cruise to the Mediterranean to participate in 6th Fleet ASW exercises. She returned to Newport on 3 March and resumed her 2d Fleet routine. Her duties included two tours as school ship for the Destroyer School and the ever-present ASW training operations. Regular overhaul commenced on 15 September 1971 and ended on 16 January 1972. Following overhaul and a brief visit to Newport, Warrington put to sea on 23 January for post-overhaul gunnery drills and refresher training in the Caribbean. She completed those evolutions on 21 March and headed back to Newport for a brief period of local operations before her second deployment to the Far East. Return to Pacific Ocean operations Departing Newport on 5 June, Warrington headed, via the Panama Canal and Pearl Harbor, for the Mariana Islands. Arriving at Guam on 30 June, she departed Apra Harbor the following day, bound for Subic Bay. She left the Philippines in July and reached Vietnamese waters the same day. During her first period on the gunline, the destroyer conducted gunfire support missions along the coast of the I Corps zone of South Vietnam. On 15 July, she put into port at Danang briefly and then headed for the coast of North Vietnam to participate in Operation Linebacker. On 16 July, she relieved of Linebacker duty and began her primary blockade and interdiction mission‚Äîthe destruction of North Vietnamese small craft and observation of communist Chinese merchant shipping. The following morning, while operating in company with and , Warrington came under the rapid and heavy fire of enemy shore batteries. She took prompt evasive action and avoided damage. Struck by an underwater explosion That same afternoon, at 1316, two underwater explosions close aboard her port side rocked the destroyer. She suffered severe damage in her after fireroom, after engine room, and in the main control room. Her crew enabled her to retire from the area at 10 knots. USS Hull maneuvered alongside to transfer repair personnel, pumps, and shoring equipment to Warrington to address continuing flooding. Before returning to station, Hull also transferred feedwater to help maintain boiler operation, along with several movies for the slow trip. Later, the damage forced her to shut down her propulsion plant and ask Robison for a tow. Through the night of 17 and 18 July, her crew struggled against flooding caused by ruptured fuel oil and fresh water tanks. The next morning USS Robison turned her over to for the first leg of the trip to Subic Bay. took over from USS Reclaimer on the 20th and towed Warrington safely into Subic Bay on the 24th. Throughout the six-day voyage, Warrington's ship's company worked to keep their ship afloat. Around 1 December 1972, the Navy announced that Warrington had struck two American Mark 36 mines after finding fragments of a specific fuse on the ship. At the time, officials speculated that the mines had been jettisoned from an aircraft, but apparently the location had not recorded to warn ships of the location. According to the account of a retired chief minemen, who worked at Naval Magazine Subic Bay converting Mk 82 bombs to Mk 36 mines during that time period, the ship disregarded warning messages and entered a known area where aircraft jettisoned bombs and mines. Unfit for further Naval service For a month after her arrival, the ship repair facility at Subic Bay worked to improve her habitability and ensure watertight integrity. At the end of August, a board of inspection and survey found her to be unfit for further naval service. On 30 September 1972, Warrington was decommissioned at Subic Bay, and she was struck from the Navy list. On 24 April 1973, she was sold to the Taiwan Navy for cannibalization and scrapping. Honors and awards Warrington (DD-843) received two battle stars for service in the Vietnam War. Warrington and her crew received the following awards, chronologically: * Navy Expeditionary Medal, relating to Cuba, for 3 periods in 1961 and 1962. * Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal, relating to Cuba, for 11 November 1962 and 5 to 18 December 1962. * Vietnam Service Medal, for 4 separate periods between 18 November 1966 and 29 March 1967 and a period in July 1972. * Combat Action Ribbon, for 17 July 1972.

Rebelstar Raiders was published in 1984 by Red Shift for the ZX Spectrum. It was reworked in machine code as Rebelstar, published by Firebird in 1986. A sequel, Rebelstar II, was published in 1988 by Silverbird. Rebelstar, but not its sequel, was also adapted for the Amstrad CPC home computer.Rebelstar at CPCZone.net Each title in the Rebelstar series is a science fiction-themed turn-based tactics game, in which each player controls an opposing squad of soldiers, using their individual action points for movement, attacking, and other activities. The playing area is top-down plan view, with units shown in profile. The games achieved critical acclaim, and formed the beginning of a development history that led to the Laser Squad and X-COM series. A spiritual successor titled Rebelstar: Tactical Command was developed by Gollop's Codo Technologies and released for the Game Boy Advance by Namco in 2005. Two more Namco projects, Rebelstar: Psionic Rebellion and Rebelstar 2: The Meklon Conspiracy, were cancelled. Rebelstar Raiders Rebelstar Raiders was originally released for the 48k ZX Spectrum in 1984 by Red Shift Ltd, a war games publisher who had also released Julian Gollop's space strategy game Nebula. It was written in BASIC. Rebelstar Raiders does not feature a computer-controlled opponent, so is strictly a two-player game. It includes three different scenarios, the maps for which are loaded in as a screen datum; thus the playing area is limited to the size of the screen. In each scenario, each player's units are deployed manually before play commences. Combat can either be melee or ranged, which takes into account limited ammunition and line of sight. Damage is taken from a unit's 'endurance' statistic. If this is reduced below one fifth of its initial value, the unit is seriously wounded. If reduced to zero, the unit is destroyed. Units also have 'skill' and 'armour' values.\\"The Rebelstar Collection\\" players' manual; Mythos Games Ltd, 1991 *The first scenario, \\"Moonbase\\", is the beginning of a storyline that runs through the whole series. The Raiders are attempting to destroy a vast organisation based on a planet called Pi. Before any of the Raiders ships can land on Pi, the planetary defenses on the moon, Spyder, must be destroyed. One player controls a squad of 24 Raiders, who are led by \\"the first of the Capricorn clones\\", Joe Capricorn. The Raiders' squad also includes Captain Krenon, a character who features in the two later Rebelstar games. The moonbase, which is disguised as a mining station, is defended by sentry robots, mining robots and auto-guns in pre-set locations, and deployable technicians and security guards. The Raiders win if one unit can get to the control room and destroy the sensitive equipment there. *In the second scenario, \\"Starlingale\\", Joe Capricorn, Captain Krenon and a few other survivors have returned to their eponymous escape vessel. The ship is still undergoing hull repairs, and must be defended for 12 turns. The Red Shift player, controlling various robot operatives, must destroy the two Navcomps on the bridge to prevent takeoff. The Raider's units include the pre-deployed Starlingale pilots and plod-bots, 14 deployable Raiders, with eight Raiders arriving later as reinforcements. The Red Shift Operatives include zorbotrons (armed with gas bombs), fly-bots (armed with zeekers), slavers (with las-whips), a mining robot and two security guards. *The third and final scenario, \\"The Final Assault\\", has the Starlingale join the Freedream on the surface of Pi. The Raiders must destroy eight parts of the Main-Comp in an underground shelter.

However, the sound effects were deemed irritating, and the packaging amateurish.\\"Frontline\\" Rebelstar Raiders review from CRASH page 78 issue 9 , October 1984. Rebelstar Rebelstar was originally published in 1986 by Telecomsoft's budget label, Firebird. Unlike its predecessor it was written in machine code, and featured a larger, scrolling playfield. The game supports single player and two player variants, and had overhauled game mechanics. Only one map is available. Morale, stamina and encumbrance are new statistics for units, and ranged fire has the option of fast snapshots or more action-point consuming aimed shots. In addition, an \\"opportunity fire\\" system allows a player to interrupt their opponents turn with pre-targeted shots. Objects are more interactive than in Rebelstar Raiders, with units able to drop or collect weapons, ammunition, dead bodies, and other items. Some types of terrain may provide cover and slow units down. Wreckage of droids and dead bodies also cause partial obstructions. The objective for the Raiders in Rebelstar is to destroy ISAAC, the computer responsible for breaking the Raiders' secret codes. The game can be won either by destroying ISAAC's central core, or by eliminating all enemy forces in the base. The player can gain reinforcements by destroying three Laser Defence Computers located around the base; this allows reinforcements to arrive a few turns later. In the single player version, the difficulty level can be set from one to eight, each level increasing the number and power of the droid forces. The game has a built-in time limit, and the Raiders automatically lose if they fail to achieve either of their objectives within the time limit. Reception CRASH gave Rebelstar 93%,Rebelstar review from CRASH issue 31; retrieved from CRASH The Online Edition making it a Crash Smash. The magazine was impressed with the fast pace, challenging difficulty level, and clear graphics. The character graphics and individual morale and skills were felt to contribute towards the game's atmosphere. The reviewer pointed out some similarities with Snapshot, a module for the 1977 Game Designers' Workshop role playing game Traveller. Rebelstar was also ranked as the second greatest Spectrum game of all time by Your Sinclair, which held Rebelstar as an example of how the wargaming genre could be \\"an experience unrivalled for thrills by all but the most adrenalin-pumping blaster\\". Both Your Sinclair and CRASH praised the decision to release the game at the budget price of ¬£1.99. Rebelstar II Rebelstar II (also known as Rebelstar II: Alien Encounter) was developed by Target Games and published in 1988 on Telecomsoft's Silverbird label (their rebranded budget range). Again, it was programmed by Julian Gollop, with Ian Terry providing graphical assistance. The scenario takes place on the planet of Thray 6, on which an alien race is threatening Rebelstar. The Raiders' objective is to kill aliens, kill the alien queen, and capture alien eggs. The Raiders have a set escape window, with their shuttle landing on turn 15 and taking off on 26. At that point, the game ends and victory points compared. The left half of the map is an outdoor environment, with bushes, trees, rivers and marshes. The alien queen herself can fire a short-ranged but deadly acidic spit. Reception CRASH gave Rebelstar II an overall 90%,Rebelstar II review from CRASH issue 64, May 1989; retrieved from CRASH The Online Edition highlighting the excellent graphics and engrossing gameplay: \\"it can all get very exhilarating to see laser bolts flying back and forth, occasionally missing by pixels.\\" Similarities with the film Aliens were pointed out, with the visual appearance of the antagonists, the storyline, and the names of some of the Raiders: \\"This is a game to appeal not only to strategists, but also fans of the Alien movies and in fact anyone who enjoys a really good - and very tense - game.\\" Rebelstar: Tactical Command Rebelstar: Tactical Command, a Game Boy Advance game released in 2005, was developed by Gollop's new studio Codo Technologies and released by Namco.

Summary=Toronto Blue Jays vs. Oakland Athletics=Game summaries=Game 1 Wednesday, October 7, 1992, at SkyDome in Toronto, Ontario The first game of the series had Oakland's Dave Stewart face off against Toronto's Jack Morris. The A's put up a three-spot against Morris in the second inning, as Mark McGwire and Terry Steinbach hit back-to-back home runs. Stewart held the Jays scoreless until the fifth, when catcher Pat Borders homered to put Toronto on the board. Dave Winfield added another shot for Toronto in the sixth, and in the eighth a base hit by John Olerud scored Winfield to tie the game. However, Oakland took the lead right back in the top of the ninth, when Harold Baines led off the inning with a home run. A's closer Dennis Eckersley then shut down the Jays in the bottom half of the inning to preserve a 4‚Äì3 victory and give the Athletics a 1‚Äì0 lead in the series. Game 2 Thursday, October 8, 1992, at SkyDome in Toronto, Ontario Game 2 saw Oakland's Mike Moore face the Jays' David Cone. The game was initially a pitchers' duel, as Moore and Cone put up zeroes for the first four innings. In the bottom of the fifth, however, Toronto's Kelly Gruber hit a two-run home run off Moore to give the Jays the lead. In the seventh, Gruber doubled, took third on a grounder, and came home on a Manuel Lee sacrifice fly to extend the Toronto lead to three. The A's avoided a shutout in the top of the ninth, when Rub√©n Sierra tripled and scored on a single by Baines, but that was all they could muster against Toronto closer Tom Henke. The Jays took the second game and tied the series at a game apiece. Game 3 Saturday, October 10, 1992, at Oakland‚ÄìAlameda County Coliseum in Oakland, California The series shifted to Oakland for Game 3, as Juan Guzm√°n took the hill for the Jays while Ron Darling toed the rubber for the A's. Toronto struck in the second, when Winfield reached on an error by Athletics' third baseman Carney Lansford, moved to third on a wild pitch by Darling, and scored on a single by Candy Maldonado. Roberto Alomar hit an opposite-field home run in the fourth to give the Jays a 2‚Äì0 lead, but in the bottom half of the inning the A's tied the game with RBI base hits by Baines and Steinbach. However, the very next inning, Maldonado hit a homer, and after Oakland manager Tony La Russa gave Darling the hook in the seventh, the Jays added two unearned runs due to an error by Lance Blankenship and a triple by Lee, making it a 5‚Äì2 game. Although the A's cut Toronto's lead down to a run, the Jays tacked on single runs in the eighth and ninth. Henke retired the Athletics in order in the ninth, giving Toronto a 7‚Äì5 victory and a 2‚Äì1 edge in the series. Game 4 Sunday, October 11, 1992, at Oakland‚ÄìAlameda County Coliseum in Oakland, California For the fourth game, Toronto threw Morris against Oakland's Bob Welch. In the second inning, Olerud tagged Welch for an opposite-field homer to give the Jays the lead. However, the Athletics came back in a big way with a five-run third and tacked on another run in the sixth when Sierra doubled Rickey Henderson home, giving Oakland a seemingly secure 6‚Äì1 advantage. In the top of the eighth, however, La Russa pulled Welch, who had been cruising along, and went to his bullpen. The Jays capitalized by scoring three runs off hits by Joe Carter, Olerud, and Maldonado, cutting the A's lead to 6‚Äì4. In the top of the ninth, La Russa turned to Eckersley to shut down the Jays. Eckersley had given up two of Toronto's three runs in the previous innings, but La Russa decided to stay with his best closer. Devon White led off with a triple to left. Roberto Alomar hit a high line drive to right field that disappeared behind the wall for a game-tying two-run home run. This turned out to be a crucial point of the series, as it forced the game into extra innings and gave the Jays a chance to win. Indeed, in the top of the 11th, Toronto came through. Derek Bell walked, moved to third on a Maldonado single, and came home on a sacrifice fly by Borders to give the Jays a 7‚Äì6 lead. Henke shut the door on the A's in the bottom of the inning, handing Toronto a 3‚Äì1 series lead. Game 5 Monday, October 12, 1992, at Oakland‚ÄìAlameda County Coliseum in Oakland, California Game 5 pitted Toronto's Cone against Oakland's Stewart. In the bottom of the first, Sierra cracked a two-run home run off Cone. In the third inning an error by Cone on a pickoff attempt proved costly, as Henderson advanced to 3rd and then scored on a single by Jerry Browne. Although Winfield broke the shutout with a homer off Stewart in the fourth, the unearned runs continued to hurt the Jays, as the A's added three runs in the fifth (only one of which was earned) for a 6‚Äì1 lead. Toronto managed only one more run in the seventh when White singled Gruber home, and Stewart went the distance as the Athletics took a 6‚Äì2 victory and cut the Jays' advantage in the series to 3‚Äì2. This would be the last Major League Baseball playoff game to be played at the Oakland Coliseum with the old, classic open air view, prior to the installment of Mount Davis in 1996. Game 6 Wednesday, October 14, 1992, at SkyDome in Toronto The series came back to Toronto for Game 6, with Guzm√°n going against Moore. In the bottom of the first, the Jays took a lead they would never relinquish, as White reached on an error by Henderson and scored on a homer by Carter, making it 2‚Äì0. In the third, Olerud lashed an RBI double and Maldonado followed with a three-run shot, extending the advantage to 6‚Äì0. McGwire put Oakland on the board in the sixth with a single that scored Sierra, but the A's could only manage another run against the Jays. In the ninth, Henke took the mound and induced a flyout from Sierra to end a 9‚Äì2 win, making Toronto the first non-U.S.-based team to win a pennant in Major League history. Composite box 1992 ALCS (4‚Äì2): Toronto Blue Jays over Oakland Athletics Broadcasting notes CBS' coverage of the 1992 ALCS led to conflicts with the presidential debates that year. CBS did not cover one of the debates because Game 4 of the series went into extra innings. By the time it ended, the debate was almost over. Over the course of Game 2, Jim Kaat was stricken with a bad case of laryngitis. As a result, Johnny Bench had to come over from the CBS Radio booth and finish the game with Dick Stockton as a \\"relief analyst.\\" There was talk that if Kaat's laryngitis did not get better, Don Drysdale was going to replace Kaat on TV for Game 3 while Bench would continue to work on CBS Radio. Locally, the series was called on CJCL-AM in Toronto by Tom Cheek and Jerry Howarth and KSFO-AM in Oakland by Bill King, Lon Simmons, and Ray Fosse. Aftermath The A's would go into a slump beginning in 1993, from which they would not recover until the Moneyball era, nearly a decade later. The 1992 ALCS began a streak of playoff success for Toronto-based teams over their San Francisco Bay Area counterparts. In 1994, the Toronto Maple Leafs defeated the San Jose Sharks 4‚Äì3 in the NHL Western Conference semifinals, then in 2019, the Toronto Raptors won the NBA championship over the Golden State Warriors 4‚Äì2.

Technique Developed and popularized by American astrologer Jim Lewis (1941-1995),Biography of Jim Lewis by Robert Currey Part 1: Reprinted from the Astrological Journal May/June 1995: astrocartography is a locational astrology system that focuses on elements of the natal chart, by identifying these factors on a world \\"Astro*Carto*Graphy Map.\\" Lewis' Astro*Carto*Graphy maps show all locations on the earth where planets were \\"angular\\" (rising, setting, on the zenith or nadir) at the moment of an event like a person's birth. An \\"angular\\" planet is one that is conjunct one of these four angles (Ascendant, Descendant, MC or IC). These locations are displayed in the form of lines on the Astro*Carto*Graphy world map. Application These maps are used by 'astro- cartographers' to counsel their clients on plans for relocation or travel. As such, they are part of a general branch of astrology known as locational astrology or \\"relocation astrology\\". Other techniques used for this purpose include local space mapping, relocated birth charts, and city incorporation charts. A*C*G Map Sources & Variations Lewis created the trademark \\"Astro*Carto*Graphy\\" to refer to his map and granted licenses to three companies to customize his authorized maps and accompanying material: Astro Numeric Services (USA), Equinox Astrology (UK and Australia) and Astrodata (Switzerland). Other similar maps were developed showing additional locational factors Lewis rejected. One example is the \\"Astrolocality Map\\" developed by Astro Computing Services of San Diego. In addition to the A*C*G lines showing conjunctions to the angles, this version includes planetary squares, trines, and other aspects.

Career matura certificate (1936) From 1921 till 1936 he lived in Ternopil, where he graduated the state Polish gymnasium. Pritsak began his academic career at the University of Lviv in interwar Poland where he studied Middle Eastern languages under local orientalists and became associated with the Shevchenko Scientific Society and attended its seminar on Ukrainian history led by Ivan Krypiakevych. After the Soviet annexation of Galicia, he moved to Kyiv where he briefly studied with the premier Ukrainian orientalist, Ahatanhel Krymsky. During the war, Pritsak escaped to the west. He studied at the universities in Berlin and G√∂ttingen, receiving a doctorate from the latter, before teaching at the University of Hamburg. During his European period Pritsak initiated the establishment of the International Association of Ural ‚Äì Altaic Studies. In 1958‚Äì1965 he served as its President and Editor-in-Chief of the Ural‚ÄìAltaische Jahrb√ºcher in 1954‚Äì1960. In the 1960s, he moved to the United States, where he taught at the University of Washington for a while, before moving to Harvard at the invitation of the prominent linguist, Roman Jakobson, who was interested in proving the authenticity of the twelfth century \\"Song of Igor\\" through the use of oriental sources. In 1973 he founded the Harvard Ukrainian Research Institute at Harvard. Two years later he became the first Mykhailo Hrushevsky Professor of Ukrainian History (1975). In 1977 he started the journal, Harvard Ukrainian Studies. In 1988 he cofounded the International Association of Ukrainianists, established in Naples and became its Executive Board member and Head of Archeographic Commission. In 1989, he retired from his Harvard professorship. After the emergence of an independent Ukraine in 1991, Pritsak returned to Kyiv where he founded the Oriental Institute of the National Academy of Sciences and became its first Director (since 1999 ‚Äì Honorary Director). Also he re-established the journal Skhidnyi svit (The Oriental World). Pritsak spent his final years back in the United States and died in Boston at the age of 87. Main interests Pritsak was a medievalist who specialized in the use of oriental, especially Turkic, sources for the history of Kievan Rus', early modern Ukraine, and the European Steppe region. He was also a student of Old Norse and was familiar with Scandinavian sources for the history of Kievan Rus'. His magnum opus, The Origin of Rus', only one volume of which has appeared in English (1981), inclines toward, but does not totally adopt, a Normanist interpretation of Rus' origins. He saw Kievan Rus' as a multi-ethnic polity. In addition to the early Rus', Pritsak's works focused on Eurasian nomads and steppe empires such as those created by the Bulgars, Khazars, Pechenegs, and Kipchaks. However, he firmly rejected the \\"Eurasian\\" approach to Ukrainian and Russian history and would have nothing to do with its Russian nationalist postulates. Ukrainian historian Unlike his predecessors Mykhailo Hrushevsky, Dmytro Doroshenko, and Ivan Krypiakevych, who wrote national histories or histories of the Ukrainian people, Pritsak followed the Ukrainian historian of Polish background, Viacheslav Lypynsky, in proposing the ideal of writing a \\"territorialist\\" history of Ukraine that would include the Polish, Turkic, and other peoples who have inhabited the country from ancient times. This idea was later taken up by his younger contemporary Paul Magocsi, who was for some time an associate of the Harvard Ukrainian Institute. Pritsak sought to improve quality and extent of Ukrainian studies at Harvard University. He supported establishing three different chairs for Ukrainian studies in the university: Ukrainian history, Ukrainian literature and Ukrainian philology.https://archive.org/stream/journalofukraini3334cana/journalofukraini3334cana_djvu.txt  Omeljan Pritsak Research Center for Oriental Studies  In 2009 Omeljan Pritsak Research Center for Oriental Studies named in honour of the Professor was founded in 2009. It is based on an extensive library and archive collection of Omeljan Pritsak, which he made a pledge to transfer to Kyiv- Mohyla Academy after his death. The heritage, collected by Omeljan Pritsak for 70 years contains manuscripts, printed editions, publications, historical sources, archival documents and artistic and cultural monuments on philosophy, linguistics, world history, Oriental Studies, Slavic Studies, Scandinavian Studies, archeology, numismatics, philosophy etc. Thus it was brought to the National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy in 2007. Research center as well as the library and the archive collection are now open to the public. Politics Pritsak was a political conservative and during his youth in eastern Galicia under the Polish Republic, and later also during the Cold War was a supporter of the conservative \\"Hetmanite\\" or monarchist movement among Ukrainians. This led him to criticize Hrushevsky's political radicalism and historical populism, although, ironically, he claimed that Hrushevsky's \\"school\\" of history was being continued at Harvard. Also during the Cold War, Pritsak became prominent in the movement towards Ukrainian-Jewish reconciliation. Pritsak often was invited to brief Pope John Paul II on developments in Central and Eastern Europe.

Camp history The camp was opened in May 1944. In July of that year a military report was released which described such problems as inadequate shower facilities, unfit distribution of Red Cross parcels, and that prisoners complained about the food situation often. Two letters and four postcards were permitted per month. These letters were harshly censored, with prisoners forced to tell families that they were being treated well and that there were no problems whatsoever. A report by the International Red Cross in October 1944 described camp conditions as generally bad. The camp was divided into five compounds (A-E) separated by barbed wire fences, with the POWs housed in 40 wooden barrack huts, each containing 200 men. Prisoners in compounds A and B had triple-tiered bunks, but there were no bunks at all in compounds C and D, and POWs slept on the floor. None of the huts were heated, with only five small iron stoves in the whole camp. Latrines were open-air, and there were no proper washing facilities. Medical facilities and supplies of food and clothing were also inadequate. At this point there were 7,089 American and 886 British POWs (of these 606 were from the British Isles, and included 147 Canadians, 37 Australians, 58 Poles, 22 New Zealanders, 8 South Africans, 5 Czechs, 2 French and 1 Norwegian). Another International Red Cross inspection in January 1945, reported that the camp held: * 8,033 Americans * 820 British * 60 Polish * 5 Czech * 2 French * 1 Norwegian The Black March On February 6, 1945 some 8,000 men of the camp set out on a march that would be called the \\"Black March\\". The prisoners were given the remaining Red Cross parcels; they were allowed to carry as much as they could. The march from Gross Tychow lasted approximately 86 days. They were forced to march under guard about per day. There was much zigzagging, to escape the encroaching Soviet Red Army from the east. The treatment was very bad. The sick were mistreated when dysentery and diarrhea set in. The Germans could not be collaborated with. Some prisoners were bayoneted; others were kicked and hit. Shelter might be a barn or under the stars, in the rain, snow, or whatever was available. As for the food, a bushel or two of steamed potatoes for a barn full of men was the best ever received at the end of a day. Often, the food was placed in the barn in the dark of night for the men to get what they could. The German government provided no clothing. They carried two blankets, and an overcoat for bedding. The average POW lost a third of his body weight after capture. They drank water, often contaminated, from ditches beside the road, or ate snow when available. They used cigarettes, watches, rings or whatever they had to trade with the farmers along the way, for food. However, in doing so risking the farmers and the POWs' lives. The POWs ate charcoal to help stop dysentery, and they all became infested with lice. Pneumonia, diphtheria, pellagra, typhus, trench foot, tuberculosis and other diseases ran rampant among the POWs. Acts of heroism were virtually universal. The stronger helped the weaker. Those fortunate enough to have a coat shared it with others. The Germans sometimes provided a wagon for the sick. However, there seldom were horses available, so teams of POWs pulled the wagons through the snow. When a wagon was not available and a POW fell out along the road, a German guard would drop back and a shot would be heard. The guard would then come back into formation alone. However, not all Germans were hated - the guard Shorty was carried by several prisoners after he couldn't go on. They reached Stalag 357 (Stalag XI-B), near Fallingbostel around April 3, 1945. Many camps on the eastern edge of Germany were combined into one large camp there. The treatment was a repetition of that at previous camps, with the exception of food, of which there was virtually none. There were no beds or bedding in the buildings. The prisoners, and the Germans as well, knew liberation was close at hand. The sounds of the encroaching American artillery could be heard getting louder and louder at this camp. When the sound of Allied artillery grew closer, the German guards were less harsh in their treatment of POWs, because the prisoner roles might soon be reversed. The POWs were only in this camp for about a week, when lagers A and B from Stalag Luft IV were taken out on their final march, this time east. This last march lasted approximately three weeks, but was just as harsh as the previous march except for the treatment by the Germans, which was somewhat better. There was still little or no food available, and the pace was much slower, advancing 4‚Äì5 miles a day. On the morning of May 2, 1945 the POWs were all sitting in a ditch next to the River Elbe near Lauenburg, Germany, when the British arrived and liberated the camp. Soldiers were given virtually nothing and told to march west. Thus Stalag Luft IV ended.

The film, based on Marc Behm's novel of the same name and a remake of Claude Miller's 1983 French thriller Deadly Circuit, is directed and adapted by Stephan Elliott. Starring Ewan McGregor and Ashley Judd, the film is an international co-production of Canada, the United Kingdom, and Australia. Plot Stephen Wilson aka \\"The Eye\\" (Ewan McGregor) is an intelligence agent whose current assignment is to track down the socialite son of his wealthy boss and find out what trouble he has gotten himself into. This leads him to Joanna Eris (Ashley Judd), a serial killer who is in a relationship with the son, whom she murders. Stephen is a witness to the crime. At Penn Station in Pittsburgh, Eris commits yet another murder, enabling Stephen to finally corner her as he prepares to call for backup. Instead of turning her in, Stephen follows her in an effort to save her. He hallucinates constantly that his young daughter ‚Äî whom he hasn't seen since his ex-wife took custody of her ‚Äî is with him, and comes to think of Eris as a vulnerable, lost child. Stephen follows her across the country and through several murders. He soon discovers that Eris and her father were homeless and that he had abandoned her, explaining her pathological hatred of men. When Eris helps a rich blind man (Patrick Bergin) in an airport, the two become involved, fall in love and become engaged, and it looks like they might even live a happy life together. Stephen, who has witnessed all of this, cannot bear to let her go, and is willing to do anything to stop her from having a relationship with another man. While the couple is on the way to the chapel for the wedding, Stephen shoots out one of their tires and the car crashes, killing Eris' fianc√©. Stephen follows a grief-stricken Eris as she takes off for the desert. A drug addict named Gary (Jason Priestley) picks up Eris when her car dies, and tries to seduce her; when she rebuffs his advances, he beats her unconscious and injects her with heroin so he can rape her while she is unconscious. Stephen arrives just in time to save Eris and gives Gary a thorough beating. Eris loses her unborn baby before fleeing to Alaska, with Stephen on her trail. In Alaska, Stephen gains the courage to ask Eris out, as he is a frequent patron of the diner at which she waitresses. They have a few drinks in the evening, both getting emotional, and Eris mentions where she would like to be buried when she dies. She then says she has nothing to offer and that he should leave her alone. The next day the police, as well as Eris's psychiatrist (Genevi√®ve Bujold), come to the diner to arrest her. Stephen tries to save her, taking her to his trailer. There she is horrified to find out that he has been following her. She shoots him with Stephen's revolver, although she doesn't realize that he had loaded it with blank cartridges. She flees and he follows her on a motorcycle. He catches up to her, but she crashes her car onto an ice-covered lake, breaking through the ice. He then quickly pulls her out of the car, but she is badly injured. Before she dies in his arms, she tells him she knows that he is her \\"Angel\\". CastReception=Box office Despite opening in the United States at number- one during the Super Bowl weekend and grossing $6 million on its opening weekend, Eye of the Beholder was a financial failure in theaters, grossing $16.5 million domestically and $1.1 million internationally for a worldwide total of $17.6 million against a $35 million budget.

It was founded in 1928 by Bill Keziah and has been owned and operated by the Harper family since the Great Depression. It covers the towns of Southport, Oak Island, Caswell Beach, Boiling Spring Lakes, Bald Head Island, and St. James. It is published on Wednesdays. The Pilot had been founded in 1928 by Keziah, a hearing- and speech-impaired former editor of The News Reporter in Whiteville, whose talent as a reporter far exceeded his skill as a businessman. His new publication failed to meet its payment obligations to The News Reporter Inc., where the Pilot was printed then and continues to be printed until this day. The printing company took over the Pilot for non- payment, and hired Harper to be its editor. Among Harper's first decisions was the re-employment of the remarkable Keziah, this area's biggest promoter of fishing, tourism and the legendary Bouncing Log Spring. He continued with the Pilot until his death in the 1950s. The young editor's greatest decision was his courtship of Margaret Taylor, who soon joined him in marriage and in the newspaper operation. During World War II, when her husband was serving in the U.S. Navy, Margaret Harper and Keziah ran the newspaper by themselves. During the 1950s and ‚Äô60s the Pilot was a three- or four-person operation ‚Äî the editor, a reporter, always a secretary and sometimes an ad salesman. In 1972, youngest son Ed joined the newspaper as editor, allowing James and Margaret Harper time to pursue other interests. James Harper continued with the newspaper as publisher until his death in 1994; Margaret Harper served in an advisory capacity until her death in 2009. Both James Harper and Ed Harper have served as president of the North Carolina Press Association. Margaret Harper served as secretary-treasurer of the association for a number of years, and is a member of the N.C. Journalism Hall of Fame. In 1972, the newspaper's circulation was 3,500 and a weekly edition usually consisted of 12 to 16 pages. Today, a 70-page newspaper is the norm and circulation exceeds 10,000.

The game is the second installment of the Heroes of Might and Magic series and is typically credited as the breakout game for the series. Heroes II was voted the sixth-best PC game of all time by PC Gamer in May 1997. An expansion pack, The Price of Loyalty, was released in 1997. Later, 3DO bundled Heroes II and its expansion pack in one box, released as Heroes of Might and Magic II Gold in 1998. Gameplay Heroes of Might and Magic II adventure map For the most part, Heroes of Might and Magic II is largely a graphical overhaul to the first game. Gameplay in both games is along the 4X genre of strategy games, in that the player builds their kingdom from the ground up, securing resources, stronger armies, better generals, and then uses those assets to find and defeat opponents through capturing their castles and defeating their armies. Aside from the updated look, Heroes II added many new features that would become staples in the Heroes of Might and Magic franchise. Heroes II added the Necromancer and Wizard factions, joining the original four factions (Knight, Barbarian, Sorceress, and Warlock) from the first game. These two new factions also come with an army of creatures and a themed town that ties the faction together, and the six are divided down the middle to have 3 \\"good\\" and 3 \\"evil\\" factions. Each hero still retains the 'primary skill' system from Heroes I but now can also learn secondary skills, giving each hero the ability to become more distinctive as they gain experience. Each hero can possess up to eight different secondary skills and once gained, a skill can be developed from Basic to Advanced and Expert levels. For example, the Wisdom skill allows a hero to learn spells of level 3 and higher, while the Logistics skill increases the hero's movement ability over land. In Heroes I, heroes had a single, fixed, special ability according to their class. The magic system was overhauled in Heroes II. Heroes I had used a memorization system in which each spell could be cast a certain number of times before being exhausted, where the player had to return to a guild to relearn the spell. Heroes II uses a magic point system that allows the player to apportion spell use as needed, while the varying point cost of different spells maintains balance. Another major feature introduced in Heroes II is the ability to upgrade certain army units, granting them improved statistics and, in some cases, important abilities. Lastly, Heroes II added more scenarios to the game and a proper campaign, where the player chooses the good or evil side and plays a series of scenarios using the three factions of that side. Victories in certain scenarios give the player lasting bonuses that carry over to future scenarios, and the player can choose a starting bonus before each scenario starts, based on what strategy they take. Story The canonical ending of Heroes I results in Lord Morglin Ironfist's victory. In the following years, he has successfully unified the continent of Enroth and secured his rule as king. Upon the king's death, his two sons, Archibald and Roland, vie for the crown. Archibald orchestrates a series of events that lead to Roland's exile. Archibald is then declared the new king, while Roland organizes a resistance. Each alignment is represented by one of the game's two campaigns. Archibald's campaign features the three \\"evil\\" town alignments, while Roland's campaign features the three \\"good\\" town alignments. If Archibald is victorious, Roland's rebellion is crushed, and Roland himself is imprisoned in Castle Ironfist, leaving Archibald the uncontested ruler of Enroth. The canonical ending, however, results in Roland's victory, with Archibald being turned to stone by Roland's court wizard, Tanir. This event is referenced later in Might and Magic VI: The Mandate of Heaven, when Archibald is freed of the spell. He goes on to be a significant NPC in Might and Magic VII: For Blood and Honor. Development Much of the core programming of Heroes II was carried over from the original Heroes, thus the game actually took less time to develop than the original Heroes. The soundtrack produced primarily by Paul Romero.  Reception  In December 1996, PC Gamer reported that Heroes of Might and Magic II was \\"doing particularly well in retail, with every 3DO retailer reordering the product.\\" Combined sales of the Heroes of Might and Magic series, including Heroes II, surpassed 500,000 copies by October 1997. This number rose to 1.5 million copies by December 1999. Next Generation reviewed the Macintosh version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"as role-playing games are few on the Mac, HM&MII;, with its mix of character and Warcraft-like game elements is a welcome addition.\\" Computer Gaming World called Heroes I a \\"strategy game that amaze[d] everyone with its surprising, addictive qualities and amazing ease of use\\" and found that Heroes II was \\"much better than the original Heroes of Might and Magic.\\" Apart from two gameplay issues - the lack of a wait function, and not being able to control your hero if all of your units are disabled, the reviewer found the game \\"nearly perfect.\\" The editors of PC Gamer US named Heroes of Might and Magic II 1996's \\"Best Turn-Based Strategy Game\\", and called it \\"clearly a cut above\\" the rest of its genre that year. The game was nominated for Computer Gaming Worlds 1996 \\"Strategy Game of the Year\\" and Computer Game Entertainments \\"Best Strategy Game\\" prizes, as well as Computer Games Strategy Pluss award for the top turn-based strategy title of 1996, but lost in all of these categories to Civilization II. It was also a finalist for the Computer Game Developers Conference's 1996 \\"Best Strategy/War Game\\" Spotlight Award, which ultimately went to Command & Conquer: Red Alert. The editors of Computer Gaming World wrote, \\"The simplicity of King's Bounty- style tactical combat is the perfect counterpoint to the surprising depth of the strategic game, and unlike Heroes I, the campaign is much more satisfying.\\" Legacy Heroes of Might and Magic II was named the 25th-best computer game ever by PC Gamer UK in 1997. In 1998, PC Gamer US declared it the seventh-best computer game ever released, and the editors called it \\"the most dangerously addictive turn-based strategy game in the history of PC gaming (with the possible exception of Civilization II).\\" Expansion The Price of Loyalty is the expansion pack for Heroes II, released on May 16, 1997. The expansion adds four new campaigns, new artifacts, new scenario maps, new in-map buildings and an improved map editor. The expansion also added a new structure for the necromancer faction - the shrine that enhances the heroes' ability to raise the dead (Necromancy Skills). Each new campaign had a totally different story that doesn't have any connection to the original game or the other campaigns.

Trematodes are covered by a tegument, that protects the organism from the environment by providing secretory and absorptive functions. The life cycle of a typical trematode begins with an egg. Some trematode eggs hatch directly in the environment (water), while others are eaten and hatched within a host, typically a mollusc. The hatchling is called a miracidium, a free- swimming, ciliated larva. Miracidia will then grow and develop within the intermediate host into a sac-like structure known as a sporocyst or into rediae, either of which may give rise to free-swimming, motile cercariae larvae. The cercariae then could either infect a vertebrate host or a second intermediate host. Adult metacercariae or mesocercariae, depending on the individual trematode's life cycle, will then infect the vertebrate host or be rejected and excreted through the rejected host's faeces or urine. Typical life cycle stages Metacercariae of Clinostomum phalacrocoracis in fish Bucephalid cercaria larva from Ernst Haeckel's Kunstformen der Natur (1904): The tail's furcae give the impression of horns, hence the genus name Bucephalus meaning \\"ox head\\". While the details vary with each species, the general life cycle stages are: Egg The egg is found in the faeces, sputum, or urine of the definitive host. Depending on the species, it will either be non-embryonated (immature) or embryonated (ready to hatch). The eggs of all trematodes (except schistosomes) are operculated. Some eggs are eaten by the intermediate host (snail) or they are hatched in their habitat (water). Miracidium (plural: miracidia) Miracidia hatch from eggs either in the environment or in the intermediate host. They do not have a mouth; therefore they cannot eat and need to find a host quickly if they hatch in the environment. Energy is needed to develop into a sporocyst. The first intermediate host can differ for different trematodes.Galaktionov, K. V., & Dobrovol πskiƒ≠, A. A. (2003). The biology and evolution of trematodes: An essay on the biology, morphology, life cycles, transmission, and evolution of digenetic trematodes. Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic. Sporocyst Sporocysts are elongated sacs that produce either more sporocysts or rediae. This is where larvae can develop.Fried, Bernard, and Thaddeus K. Graczyk. Echinostomes as Experimental Models for Biological Research. Springer, 2011. *Mother Sporocyst: These have loose plates (cilia) and migrate to gonas. *Daughter Sporocyst: These are an asexual production of cercariae; they absorb nutrients while having no mouth. Redia (plural rediae) After the sporocyst form the larva. The first development from it forms the redia.Fried, Bernard, and Thaddeus K. Graczyk. Echinostomes as Experimental Models for Biological Research. Springer, 2011. They have a mouth which allows them to have an advantage to their competitors because they can just consume them and will either produce more rediae or start to form cercariae. =Parasite Competition in Snail Hosts= Co-infections of different parasite species within the same host could occur and cause competition between the rediae and sporocysts. Not all trematode species have a redia stage; some may just have a sporocyst stage depending on the life cycle. The rediae are dominant over sporocysts because they have mouths and are able to either eat their competitors' food or their competitors. Cercaria (plural cercariae) The larval form of the parasite develops within the germinal cells of the sporocyst or redia. A cercaria has a tapering head with large penetration glands. It may or may not have a long swimming \\"tail\\", depending on the species. The motile cercaria finds and settles in a host where it will become either an adult, or a mesocercaria, or a metacercaria, according to species. *Mesocercaria: They are involved in an encysted stage either on vegetation or in a host tissue on the second intermediate host. They have a hard shell and are also involved in the trophic transmission. This is where the parasite is able to infect the definitive host because it consumes the second intermediate host that has metacercariae on/in it. *Metacercaria: A cercaria encysted and resting.They are only involved when there are 3 intermediate host life cycles. Cercaria is also used as a genus of trematodes, when adult forms are not known.Cercaria at WoRMS The usage dates back to M√ºller, in 1773.Vermium terrestrium et fluviatile seu animalium infusorium, helminthicorum et testaceorum, non marinorum, succinct historia. OF M√ºller, 1773 Adult The fully developed mature stage. As an adult, it is capable of sexual reproduction. Deviations from the typical life cycle Not all trematodes follow the typical sequence of eggs, miracidia, sporocysts, rediae, cercariae, and adults. In some species, the redial stage is omitted, and sporocysts produce cercariae. In other species, the cercaria develops into an adult within the same host. Many digenean trematodes require two hosts; one (typically a snail) where asexual reproduction occurs in sporocysts, the other a vertebrate (typically a fish) where the adult form engages in sexual reproduction to produce eggs. In some species (for example Ribeiroia) the cercaria encysts, waits until their host is eaten by a third host, in whose gut it emerges and develops into an adult. Most trematodes are hermaphroditic, but members of the family Schistosomatidae are dioecious. Males are shorter and stouter than the females.

It runs from I-20 and LA 3132 in Shreveport to a second interchange with I-20 in Bossier City. The highway serve as a northern bypass of the downtown area for through traffic traveling on I-20, and with LA 3132, the highway helps to carry through traffic between the two currently disconnected portions of I-49, the area's main north‚Äìsouth route. Route description I-220 begins at an interchange with I-20 and LA 3132 near Shreveport Regional Airport in western Shreveport. From here, the highway heads northeast towards and crosses Cross Lake. The highway continues northeast through northern Shreveport, where it has a currently partially opened interchange with I-49. At an interchange with US 71, the highway curves east before crossing the Red River near Shreveport Downtown Airport. East of the Red River, I-220 enters Bossier City and continues east through its northern areas before curving south at Shed Road. The highway ends at an interchange with I-20 at the southwest corner of the Louisiana Downs racetrack. History Together, I-220 and LA 3132 were both planned together as a full loop of Shreveport. However, because of Barksdale Air Force Base being in the way of the proposed route of the southeast quadrant, the two highways were both split into their respective designations and LA 3132 being truncated. The first segment of I-220 was completed and signed in 1971, and the entire highway was completed in 1991. Future There have been proposals to extend the highway eastward over the Red River and then northward to complete the loop by reaching Interstate 20, but Barksdale Air Force Base is in the way of a direct route to join up with the beginning of I-220. Aerial imagery shows ramp stubs for a possible extension southward from its eastern terminus with I-20. There are five options currently in contention for closing the gap in I-49 in Shreveport. Four of these options involve the construction of a new alignment extending from the existing I-49/I-20 interchange to the I-49/I-220 interchange currently under construction. This direct connection, known as the Inner City Connector, is controversial due to its path being projected through a residential neighborhood, which would necessitate the displacement of many of its residents. The fifth option involves routing through traffic via the existing LA 3132 and I-220 alignments after necessary improvements to those highways are carried out.

Phorid flies can often be identified by their escape habit of running rapidly across a surface rather than taking to the wing. This behaviour is a source of one of their alternate names, scuttle fly. Another vernacular name, coffin fly, refers to Conicera tibialis.Colyer, C.N. (1954) The 'coffin fly', Conicera tibialis Schmitz (Dipt., Phoridae). Journal of the Society for British Entomology, 4, 203‚Äì206. About 4,000 species are known in 230 genera. The most well-known species is cosmopolitan Megaselia scalaris. At 0.4 mm in length, the world's smallest fly is the phorid Euryplatea nanaknihali.Brown, B.V. 2012: Small size no protection for acrobat ants: world's smallest fly is a parasitic phorid (Diptera: Phoridae). Annals of the Entomological Society of America, 105(4): 550‚Äì554.  Description  For terms see Morphology of Diptera Phora wing venation Phorid flies are minute or small ‚Äì 0.5‚Äì6 mm (‚Äì in) in length. When viewed from the side, a pronounced hump to the thorax is seen. Their colours range from usually black or brown to more rarely yellow, orange, pale grey, and pale white. The head is usually rounded and in some species narrowed towards the vertex. The vertex is flat. In some species, the ocellar callus is swollen and highly raised above the surface of the vertex. The eyes are dichoptic in both males and females (eyes of males close-set, of females wide-set). The third segment of the antenna is large and rounded or elongated, and bears a long apical or dorsal arista directed sideways. The arista is glabrous or feathered. The third antennal segment in some species is unique in shape. Sexual dimorphism is often shown in the shape and size of third segment of antennae, and in males, the antennae are usually longer. The proboscis is usually short and sometimes with enlarged labella. The proboscis may be elongated, highly sclerotized, and bent at an angle. Maxillary palpi vary in shape and are sometimes large (species of genus Triphleba). The groups of bristles are developed on the head. Two pairs of supra-antenna1 bristles, sometimes one, are completely reduced. Above these are antenna1 bristles closer to (but still some distance from) the margin of eyes. Three bristles are spaced along the margin of eyes-anterolateral midlateral and posterolateral. Immediately before the ocellar callus are two preocellar bristles. The ocellar callus bears a pair of ocellar bristles and in some genera between the antennae and the preocellar bristles two additional, intermediate bristles occur. The convex mesonotum is usually covered with hairs and rows of bristles. An important taxonomic character is the precise location of the anterior spiracles on the pleura of the thorax. The metapleuron may be entire or divided by a suture into two halves, and either with a few long bristles glabrous, or pubescent. The legs have stout femora and the hind femora are often laterally compressed. The wings are clear or tinged only rarely with markings. They have a characteristic reduced wing venation. The strong, well developed radial (R) veins end in the costa about halfway along the wing. The other veins (branches of the medius) are weaker and usually follow a diagonal course and are often parallel to each other. Crossveins are totally absent. The costa reaches only to the point of confluence of alar margins with veins R4+5 or R5. The ratio of first, second, and third sections of the costa is often a reliable specific character. Other costal indices (compared to other wing measurements) are used in the taxonomy. Two rows of well developed bristles are present on the costa and almost at a right angle to each other. The subcosta is reduced. Of the radial veins, only R1 and R4+5 are developed. R4+5 may furcate at end. R4 and R5 may merge into the alar margin separately or continue as a single vein to the end. Medial veins are represented by M1, M2, and M4. The anal vein may reach the alar margin, or is greatly shortened or almost atrophied. The abdomen consists of six visible segments. Segments VII to X comprise the genitalia of the male (hypopygium), and in the female the terminalia. In some genera, segments VII to X in the female are highly sclerotized and extended into a tube (\\"ovipositor\\"). Segments VII and VIII of the male are more or less sclerotized in the genus Megaselia, but otherwise mostly membranous. Tergite 9 the (epandrium) is highly developed and usually fused at least on one side with the hypandrium (sternite 9). Only in the genus Megaselia is the hypandrium more or less distinctly separated from the epandrium. Unpaired sclerites (ventrites) developed at the distal end of the hypandrium vary in shape. They may be flat, swollen, or other. Sclerites are always present near the base of the cerci, which may be highly developed, and converted either into a tube (anal tube) or a pair of asymmetrical large outgrowths (Phora). The phallosome is rarely complex in structure. The larva is small, rarely over 10.0 mm long and typically has 12 visible segments. The shape varies from fusiform with inconspicuous projections on posterior segments to short, broad, and flattened with conspicuous dorsal and lateral plumose projections especially on the terminal segment. The colour is whitish, yellowish white, or grey. The first instar is metapneustic, later instars are amphipneustic. Pupation occurs in the last larval skin which hardens and becomes reddish. The puparium is oval, pointed at ends (because the larval extremities remain relatively unchanged). Abdominal segment 2 has a dorsal pair of long, slender pupal respiratory horns.  Classification  Traditionally, phorids were classified into six subfamilies: Phorinae, Aenigmatiinae, Metopininae (including tribes Beckerinini and Metopinini), Alamirinae, Termitoxeniinae, and Thaumatoxeninae. Disney & Cumming (1992) abolished the Alamirinae when they showed they were the 'missing' males of Termitoxeniinae, which were known only from females.Disney, R.H.L. & Cumming, M.S. (1992) Abolition of Alamirinae and ultimate rejection of Wasmann's theory of hermaphroditism in Termitoxeniinae (Diptera: Phoridae). Bonner zoologische Beitr√§ge, 43, 145‚Äì154. Also in 1992, BrownBrown, B.V. (1992) Generic revision of Phoridae of the Nearctic Region and phylogenetic classification of Phoridae, Sciadoceridae and Ironomyiidae (Diptera: Phoridea). Memoirs of the Entomological Society of Canada, 164, 1‚Äì144. presented a revised, cladistic classification based on many new character states. This classification included subfamilies Hypocerinae, Phorinae, Aenigmatiinae, Conicerinae, and Metopininae (Termitoxeniinae and Thaumatoxeninae were not included in his study). Disney rejected the entirety of Brown's work, deeming it premature, and a lively debate ensued.Disney, R.H.L. (1993) Mosaic evolution and outgroup comparisons.

Journal of Natural History, 29, 1081‚Äì1082. Further resolution of this controversy awaits new data. Biology Phora sp. in copula Phorid flies are found worldwide, though the greatest variety of species is to be found in the tropics. The Phoridae show the greatest diversity of all the dipterous families. Larvae are found in the nests of social insects and in some aquatic habitats, in organic detritus such as dung, carrion, insect frass, and dead snails. Some are synanthropic. Some species feed on bracket and other fungi and mycelium or on living plants (sometimes as leaf miners). Some are predators or parasites of earthworms, snails, spiders, centipedes, millipedes, and insect eggs, larvae, and pupae. The adults feed on nectar, honeydew, and the juices exuding from fresh carrion and dung. Some adults feed on the body fluids of living beetle larvae and pupae, others prey on small insects. Several species have the common name coffin fly, because they breed in human corpses with such tenacity, they can even continue living within buried coffins. For this reason, they are important in forensic entomology. Most commonly, they feed on decaying organic matter. Because they frequent unsanitary places, including drain pipes, they may transport various disease-causing organisms to food material. The adults are conspicuous on account of their fast and abrupt running. In some species, the males fly in swarms. Megaselia halterata, the mushroom phorid, is a pest of mushroom cultures. Although it does not cause direct damage, it is an efficient vector of dry mould (Lecanicillium fungicola).  Lifecycle  Phorid flies develop from eggs into larval, and pupal stages before emerging as adults. The female lays from one to 100 tiny eggs at a time in or on the larval food. She can lay up to 750 eggs in her lifetime. The time it takes from egg to adult varies on the species, but the average is about 25 days. The larvae emerge in 24 hours and feed for a period between 8 and 16 days, before crawling to a drier spot to pupate. The phorid fly's egg-to-adult lifecycle can be as short as 14 days, but may take up to 37 days. Many species of phorid flies are specialist parasitoids of ants, but several species in the tropics are parasitoids of stingless bees. These affected bees are often host to more than one fly larva, and some individuals have been found to contain 12 phorid larvae.Piper, Ross (2007), Extraordinary Animals: An Encyclopedia of Curious and Unusual Animals, Greenwood Press. Other species, especially those of the giant genus Megaselia, develop in various fungi during their larval stage and may be pests of cultivated mushrooms.Disney, R.H.L., Kurina, O., Tedersoo, L. & Cakpo, Y. (2013) Scuttle flies (Diptera: Phoridae) reared from fungi in Benin. African Invertebrates, 54 (2), 357‚Äì371. Control of fire ants Hooked ovipositor of upright Phorid flies also represent a new and hopeful means by which to control fire ant populations in the southern United States, where some species of fire ants were accidentally introduced in the 1930s. The genus Pseudacteon, or ant- decapitating flies, of which 110 species have been documented, is a parasitoid of ants. Pseudacteon species reproduce by laying eggs in the thorax of the ant. The first instar larvae migrate to the head, where they feed on the ant's hemolymph, muscle and nerve tissue. Eventually, the larvae completely devour the ant's brain, causing it to wander aimlessly for about two weeks. After about two to four weeks, they cause the ant's head to fall off by releasing an enzyme that dissolves the membrane attaching the ant's head to its body. The fly pupates in the detached head capsule, requiring a further two weeks before emerging. Various species of Phoridae have been introduced throughout the southeast United States, starting with Travis, Brazos, and Dallas Counties in Texas, as well as Mobile, Alabama, where the non-native fire ants first entered North America. The native species of fire ants are also parasitized by some species of Pseudacteon; these native fire ants don't cause ecological damage the way introduced species do. Colony collapse disorder In January 2012, a researcher discovered larvae in the test tube of a dead honey bee believed to have been affected by colony collapse disorder. The larvae had not been there the night before. The larvae were Apocephalus borealis, a parasitoid fly known to prey on bumblebees and wasps. The phorid fly lays eggs on the bee's abdomen, which hatch and feed on the bee. Infected bees act oddly, foraging at night and gathering around lights like moths. Eventually, the bee leaves the colony to die. The phorid fly larvae then emerge from the neck of the bee.A New Threat to Honey Bees, the Parasitic Phorid Fly Apocephalus borealis Identification *Beyer, E.; Delage, A. Bearbeitet von: Schmitz, H.

Educated in the United States, P√©rez Balladares worked as a banker before becoming part of the government of military ruler Omar Torrijos; in 1989, he also served as campaign manager for the pro-Manuel Noriega presidential candidate Carlos Duque. He was elected president in 1994 as the candidate of the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD), in a close three-way race with Arnulfista Party candidate Mireya Moscoso and salsa singer Ruben Blades. P√©rez Balladares' term was notable for free-market reforms and the privatization of government services. He also rehabilitated a number of officials from the Noriega years and sought a closer alliance with the United States than the previous administration of Guillermo Endara. Following a failed constitutional referendum to allow him a second term in office, P√©rez Balladares was succeeded by Moscoso in 1999. In 2009, prosecutors opened an investigation into charges of corruption dating to P√©rez Balladares' time in office. He was placed under house arrest the following year, making him the first former Panamanian president to be arrested, and in October 2010 was charged with money laundering. A judge dismissed the charge against him in April 2011. In February 2012, P√©rez Balladares was convicted of slandering comptroller Alvin Weeden by calling him a narcocriminal, and sentenced to a $3,000 fine or a year in prison.  Background  P√©rez Balladares received master's degrees in the US at the University of Notre Dame and the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania. From 1971 to 1975, he was credit officer of the City Bank for Panama and Central America. He is married to Dora Boyd de P√©rez Balladares. Political career P√©rez Balladares served under military ruler Omar Torrijos as the Minister of Economy and Finances. In March 1979, he was one of the co-founders of the Democratic Revolutionary Party (PRD). He was picked to be the Secretary of the Party in 1982. However, in 1984, he clashed with new military leader Manuel Noriega, and passed several months in exile in Spain. P√©rez Balladares later served as campaign manager for Carlos Duque, Noriega's chosen candidate for the 1989 presidential election. The opposition candidate, Guillermo Endara, was reported by international observers to be leading the vote by a 3-to-1 margin, but the results were annulled by the Noriega government before counting was complete. During the December 1989 US invasion of Panama, however, Endara was certified the election's winner and sworn in as the next president of Panama. During the invasion, P√©rez Balladares was briefly detained and interrogated by US forces for his association with Noriega, but was then released. P√©rez Balladares himself stood as a candidate in the 1994 presidential election for the PRD, opposing Mireya Moscoso of the Arnulfista Party and the salsa singer Rub√©n Blades, who was then president of the party Papa Egoro. P√©rez Balladares' opponents sought to emphasize his connection with Noriega, broadcasting pictures of the two together. P√©rez Balladares denied the link, describing the current PRD as \\"diametrically opposed\\" to Noriega's policies. Instead, he worked to position himself as a successor to Torrijos, who was regarded as a national hero. The incumbent Arnulfista Party, meanwhile, was seen as hobbled by dissatisfaction with the perceived incompetence and corruption of Endara's government. He ultimately won the election with 33% of the vote, with Moscoso receiving 29% and Blades receiving 17%.  Presidency (1994‚Äì1999)  P√©rez Balladares's government was characterized by pro-free market policies. He included a number of free-market economists in his cabinet. Under his rule, both the electric and telephone companies were privatized and in 1997, Panama entered the World Trade Organization. In 1995, he reformed Panama's labor code, an action protested by 49 unions and causing his popularity to drop. Other unpopular actions by P√©rez Balladares included giving $35 million in back pay to Noriega's paramilitary Dignity Battalions and doubling the salaries of his cabinet despite the country's ongoing poverty. He rehabilitated a number of former Noriega officials in his government, including his Housing Minister, a doctor accused of helping to torture political prisoners during Noriega's rule, and his First Vice President, Tomas Altamirano Duque. P√©rez Balladares ultimately pardoned more than 200 people for crimes committed during the Noriega years, calling it a step toward national reconciliation. P√©rez Balladares forged closer ties with the US, agreeing with President Bill Clinton to take in 10,000 Cuban boat people at US military bases that Endara had refused to accept, as well as providing exile to Haitian former military ruler Raoul C√©dras as part of a negotiated settlement. P√©rez Balladares also pledged to join the US anti-drug effort and pass new laws to prevent money laundering. Peruvian reporter Gustavo Gorriti, working for the Panamanian newspaper La Prensa, reported in 1996 that an agent of Colombia's Cali Cartel had contributed US$51,000 to P√©rez Balladares' presidential campaign. After briefly threatening to sue for libel and calling the report \\"journalistic terrorism\\", P√©rez Balladares later stated that it had been correct, describing it as \\"the first time, perhaps in my life, that I have had to swallow my words.\\" When Gorriti's work visa expired the following year, however, the Panamanian government refused to renew it, triggering a storm of criticism from international press NGOs and domestic opposition parties. Under pressure, the P√©rez Balladares government later relented, and Gorriti's visa was renewed. In 1998, P√©rez Balladares organized a referendum to amend the constitution to allow him to serve a second consecutive term in office, stating that he needed another term to complete his reforms (the Panamanian Constitution only allows a former President to seek the office after sitting out two consecutive terms). Despite massive spending by the PRD, however, the proposal was defeated by a margin of almost 2 to 1, a result described by The Economist as \\"proving Panama's democracy more resilient than many dared suppose.\\" P√©rez Balladares also proposed constitutional amendments to allow penalties for a domestic or foreign journalist who \\"incites violent protest\\", and to ban the wearing of military fatigues or boots. Because P√©rez Balladares was ineligible to run again, the PRD ultimately selected Mart√≠n Torrijos, the son of Omar Torrijos, as the candidate for the 1999 Panamanian general election. He lost to the Arnulfista candidate, Mireya Moscoso. In the final weeks of P√©rez Balladares' presidency, the Arnulfista Party and president- elect Moscoso accused his administration of illegally using funds from the sale of government property, issuing last-minute contracts to political allies, and selling visas to Asians wishing to illegally enter the US. Critics also accused P√©rez Balladares of staffing the new Panama Canal Authority, which would oversee the Panama Canal beginning on January 1, 2000, with his own business associates and \\"cronies\\".  Corruption allegations and arrest  In November 1999, following allegations that he had participated in the illegal sale of US visas to Chinese immigrants, the US revoked P√©rez Balladares' tourist visa. The Panamanian government opened an investigation of the former president for money laundering in September 2009, however not enough evidence was available to prove such allegations. On January 14, 2010, he was placed under house arrest over accusations that he accepted money from Lucky Games SA casino. It was the first arrest of a former Panamanian president. In April, the bank account of his company Shelf Holding Inc. was frozen, and P√©rez Balladares was required to hand over his passport following a trip to Peru. District Attorney Jose Ayu Prado announced in October 2010 that there was sufficient evidence to charge P√©rez Balladares with money laundering. A preliminary hearing on the case was held on April 11, 2011, and the case was dismissed by the judge two weeks later. In December 2012, Ayu Prado was nominated to the Supreme Court. Perez Balladares stated via Twitter that the appointment was a trade for having persecuted him. P√©rez Balladares was later charged with slander for calling comptroller Alvin Weeden a narcocriminal. The former president was convicted on February 17, 2012 and sentenced to a $3,000 fine or a year in prison.

It begins southeast of the city at I-29 and U.S. Route 71 (US 71) and travels to the northwest into the city. In St. Joseph, it runs with US 59\\\\. Just north of an interchange with US 36, the two routes travel over a viaduct on the banks of the Missouri River. The two routes split at the north end of the viaduct. The interstate ends at another interchange with I-29 and US 71 north of St. Joseph. The portion that goes through downtown St. Joseph is the second double decked bridge in the state of Missouri, the other on I-64 in St. Louis, and one of only a few such bridges in the United States and the world.http://www.newspressnow.com/news/local_news/i--bridge-called- safe-but-costly-repairs-loom/article_c42c2162-84d8-5668-8c61-6ca296f63cbf.html The interstate was built in the late 1970s and early 1980s and was intended to draw people into St. Joseph's downtown area. A portion of the historic Robidoux Row, an area of St. Joseph built by the towns founder, was demolished to make way for the viaduct along the Missouri River. Route description I-229 begins southeast of Saint Joseph at a directional T interchange with I-29 and US 71 in rural Buchanan County. It heads to the north-northwest and almost immediately meets Route A at a half-diamond interchange; in this case, only southbound I-229 traffic can access Route A and Route A traffic can only access northbound I-229. North of the highway is a housing development while there are fields to the south. Another half-diamond interchange provides access to Route 752. Northbound I-229 traffic may exit to reach westbound Route 752. Full access to Route 752 is provided by the next exit, Route 371, known locally as 22nd Street. As I-229 approaches downtown St. Joseph, it encounters two half-diamond interchanges. The southern interchange, for E. Lake Boulevard, provides access to US 59 for northbound traffic. At the northern interchange, for S. 6th Street, northbound US 59 joins northbound I-229 while southbound US 59 leaves I-229. The two routes run together northward, where they encounter US 36\\\\. Just north of US 36, the northbound lanes I-229 / US 59 raise up and are positioned over the southbound lanes. Wyeth Hill This viaduct runs along the eastern bank of the Missouri River for just over . At the south end of the viaduct, another half-diamond interchange, for Route 759 provides southbound traffic access to westbound US 36 as the main interchange does not provide direct access. At roughly the three-quarter point of the viaduct, two sets of exit and entrance ramps, all of which on the eastern side of the structure, connect St. Joseph's central business district to the Interstate Highway. The viaduct ends at the St. Joseph Avenue interchange, which is also where US 59 leaves I-229. After which, the highway leaves St. Joseph and enters Andrew County. The Route K interchange provides access to Amazonia. The interstate continues north where it ends at a complex interchange with I-29 and US 71\\\\. I-29 runs from the southeast to the northwest, I-229 comes up from the south, and US 71 comes from the southeast with I-29 and exits to the north at the interchange. I-229 traffic that does not exit onto I-29 continues north on US 71\\\\. US 59 is signed at the interchange as if it were running along the same line as US 71, but it actually intersects I-29 southeast of the end of I-229. History The interstate, which was built in the late 1970s and early 1980s (with the southern section from downtown completed in 1979 and the northern section from downtown to the northern portion of I-29 completed in 1986), was intended to revive St. Joseph's downtown which had been seeing its businesses migrate to shopping malls along U.S. Route 169 (also known as the Belt Highway) about two miles (3 km) east of downtown near I-29. I-29 initially had been designed to bypass developed areas of St. Joseph but its construction spurred development near the interstate on the city's east side. Access to St. Joseph's downtown business district earlier had been via residential streets often on a confusing maze of one-way streets. The most dramatic and controversial section of the road is a two-level viaduct (with northbound cars on the top) on the west side of downtown separating the town from the Missouri River. Its construction caused several historic downtown buildings to be torn down including portions of Robidoux Row (built by the city's founder Joseph Robidoux).  Future  More than 400 people gave input on 19 different design proposals through an online survey via MoDOT's \\"I-229: Moving Forward\\" web site. Proposals in seven different categories included reconstructing the interstate at-grade or on slightly elevated structures in flood-prone areas; removing the top deck and building another elevated structure next to the existing one; decommissioning the interstate and using local streets or a scenic parkway through downtown St. Joseph, and; routing I-229 into Kansas along a 2700-foot long bridge across the Missouri River. On November 14, 2019, MoDOT told the City of St. Joseph it had settled on two possible alternatives for the two-level section, both of which would involve its demolition and removing the Interstate designation. According to MoDOT's district planning manager, \\"Removing the structure and creating a facility that would facilitate local traffic which is what‚Äôs going on right now is the best approach moving forward.\\" The St. Joseph Metropolitan Planning Organization's (MPO) technical committee voted down supporting the plans and asked for more information on how MoDOT arrived at its decisions. City officials have previously discussed the possibility of tearing the viaduct down at the end of its life in 2036. Don Wichern, an area engineer for the Missouri Department of Transportation's Northwest Region, said I-229 is the least used interstate in Missouri. No formal plans have been forward on how to handle the traffic if it is torn down.

It is usually manufactured using scrap metal and angle iron. These homemade weapons are usually manufactured in Danao, Cebu, where the production of replicas of known firearms is a cottage industry.

The Philippine government notes that these firearms are of low quality, even if some are considered as \\"Class A\\" or high quality. Danao has the most concentration of factories since the 1940s, but paltik production can also be found in Negros, Leyte, and Mindanao. The Moro Islamic Liberation Front were also known to produce paltik but were unable to upscale their production due to government pressure. The paltik suffered from poor accuracy and low quality firing mechanisms. Some lacked grooves in its bore, making its shots inaccurate. Due to poor craftsmanship, the weapon was more dangerous to the shooter than the target. Some Filipino gunsmiths however, did make reliable percussion cap rifles that functioned in a manner similar to a 19th-century musket. Paltiks are still being made illegally in the Philippines today. These were being registered during the administration of President Corazon Aquino but this \\"legalization\\" was revoked and all registered paltiks had to be surrendered to the government. President Gloria Macapagal-Arroyo signed Executive Order No. 171 in 2003 which prohibits paltiks from being licensed.

It was created in Japan and translated for North American release by Working Designs in 1996, a translation that was also used by Sega in Europe under license from Working Designs. The game's main selling point was that battles involve up to 200 soldiers fighting on screen in real time, causing them to be often likened to the battle scenes in the then-recent film Braveheart. Upon its release, critics resoundingly praised Dragon Force for its melding of the war simulation and story-driven RPG genres, and it remains one of the Saturn's most highly regarded games. A sequel, later translated by fans, was released for the Saturn in Japan in 1998. The first game was re-released for the PlayStation 2 as part of the Sega Ages series. An emulated version for the PlayStation 3 was released as a PS2 Classic in July 2012 in Japan. Gameplay The player assumes the role of one of eight rulers vying for control of Legendra. Each ruler has a set of generals under their command, and each general commands an army of up to 100 soldiers. Armies travel between towns and castles via fixed routes on an overhead scrolling map, much like the earlier Saturn game Romance of the Three Kingdoms IV: Wall of Fire. When armies of different nations meet, they engage in battle. Although both the world map and battles unfold in real time, the game pauses when the player opens a menu. At the outset of the battle, the player must choose to Attack, Talk, or Retreat. If the player chooses Retreat, their army loses the battle and some troops, and moves out of the victorious army's path on the world map. The Talk option opens negotiations with the enemy. The enemy may then leave their castle or join the player's monarch, but if the enemy refuses to negotiate, battle will start with the player bereft of all troops; because of this tremendous advantage, the enemy will nearly always refuse to negotiate. If Attack is selected, each side chooses a general and corresponding company of troops to send into battle, and then chooses a formation which determines the arrangement of troops. The enemy side always chooses first in both cases, allowing the player to determine an appropriate counter-strategy. During battle the player can select commands or special attacks from a menu. Each individual skirmish ends when one general runs out of hit points or retreats. If both generals' armies are depleted, both generals are given one last chance to retreat before they are thrust into a one-on-one battle. Generals who run out of hit points are, depending on the general, captured, injured, or (rarely) killed in action. If the player's ruler is defeated in this manner, the player loses the game and must restart from the last save. The skirmishes continue until one army's generals have all been defeated, at which point the battle ends. Every in-game \\"week\\" (a fixed amount of time on the world map), the player attends to administrative duties. During this time, players may give awards to generals (increasing the number of troops they can command or items that increase their capabilities), persuade captive enemy generals to join the player's army, search for items, recruit generals in the ruler's territory, fortify castles, and save the game. Plot-advancing cut scenes frequently take place at the end of the week. Plot Dragon Force is set in the world Legendra, which lived in an era of prosperity under the watch of the benevolent goddess Astea, until it came under siege by the evil god Madruk and his armies. The Star dragon Harsgalt and his chosen warriors, the Dragon Force, come to stop him. Personal disputes among the Dragon Force led to their downfall and left Harsgalt to face Madruk in a fight to death. Harsgalt, unable to kill Madruk, sealed him away until eight new chosen warriors could rise to permanently defeat him. 300 years later, the seal imprisoning Madruk has weakened and two of his Dark Apostles, Scythe and Gaul, have begun working towards his release. To ensure none will stop their master, the two of them manipulate the eight nations of Legendra into warring among themselves. Eventually, one of the monarchs successfully ends the war, though the events of how it occurs vary depending on the monarch. Regardless, the monarchs discover that they are the eight members of the Dragon Force, and that the only way they can kill Madruk is by obtaining the Dragon Power left by Harsgalt. Despite attempts to stop them by Scythe and Gaul, whichever monarch the player controls gains the power, and then has to use it to defeat Madruk's final apostle, a robot named Katmondo. Madruk's prison continues to weaken, allowing him to release his army of dragonmen. The Dragon Force fight their way to Madruk's prison and find his three Dark Apostles waiting for them. Whichever monarch has the Dragon power leaves to face Madruk, while the remaining seven fight the Dark Apostles. The monarch with the Dragon Power kills Madruk, finally ending his threat. The monarchs are saved by Astea, who leaves the world to be governed by the mortals, saying it is time for them to stand on their own. Within the game, eight different storylines exist, one for each monarch. The campaigns for Goldark and Reinhart can only be accessed after the game has been completed, as they contain spoilers from the outset. Reception Dragon Force received critical acclaim, with reviews lauding the game's balance of war simulation with RPG elements and the visual spectacle of the battle sequences. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave it their \\"Game of the Month\\" award, commenting particularly on the game's addictive quality. Crispin Boyer opined, \\"DF is about as good as a strategy game can get. It has a sprawling world, epic story line, a cast of thousands and the most awe-inspiring battles ever seen in a video game.\\" Scary Larry of GamePro criticized the graphics, but found their shortcomings hardly noticeable against the humor of the English localization and the intense strategy of the battles. Reiner of Game Informer commented that the unpredictability of the competing nations demands quicker thinking and reflexes than is required in most strategy games. Most critics also praised the story, with Next Generation in particular stating that \\"the story in Dragon Force is so well integrated that the game almost feels secondary. Each major character in the game approaches world conquest with a different motive, and gameplay changes accordingly. ... Seamlessly welding both traditional wargaming and RPG elements, Working Designs and Sega have created a classic that should appeal to fans of both genres.\\" Joe Fielder of GameSpot similarly remarked, \\"Dragon Force balances role-playing and strategy elements perfectly, intermittently directing the war of the land through storyline segments.\\" Matt Yeo of the official UK Sega Saturn Magazine gave Dragon Force a more mixed review than most; while agreeing that the game is well-constructed, he concluded that most British gamers would not have the attention span needed to enjoy the game's battle sequences, much less its administrative segments. Dragon Force won Electronic Gaming Monthlys Saturn Game of the Year and Strategy Game of the Year awards for 1996. It was also runner-up for the All Systems Game of the Year award. EGM ranked the game at #55 on its \\"100 Best Games of All Time\\" in 1997, Note: Contrary to the title, the intro to the article explicitly states that the list covers console video games only, meaning PC games and arcade games were not eligible. and #111 on its list of 'The Greatest 200 Videogames of Their Time' in 2006. Sales Dragon Force was a commercial success, selling more than 150,000 copies in North America alone. Sequel Dragon Force II: Kamisarishi Daichi ni was developed and published by Sega for the Saturn, and released only in Japan in 1998.

Transmission rates are defined by rate of the bitstream of the digital signal and are designated by hyphenation of the acronym OC and an integer value of the multiple of the basic unit of rate, e.g., OC-48. The base unit is 51.84 Mbit/s. Thus, the speed of optical-carrier-classified lines labeled as OC-n is n √ó 51.84 Mbit/s. Optical Carrier specifications Optical Carrier classifications are based on the abbreviation OC followed by a number specifying a multiple of 51.84 Mbit/s: n √ó 51.84 Mbit/s => OC-n. For example, an OC-3 transmission medium has 3 times the transmission capacity of OC-1. OC-1 OC-1 is a SONET line with transmission speeds of up to 51.84 Mbit/s (payload: 50.112 Mbit/s; overhead: 1.728 Mbit/s) using optical fiber. OC-3 OC-3 is a network line with transmission data rate of up to 155.52 Mbit/s (payload: 148.608 Mbit/s; overhead: 6.912 Mbit/s, including path overhead) using fiber optics. Depending on the system OC-3 is also known as STS-3 (electrical level) and STM-1 (SDH). OC-3c / STM-1 OC-3c (\\"c\\" stands for \\"concatenated\\") concatenates three STS-1 (OC-1) frames into a single OC-3 look alike stream. The three STS-1 (OC-1) streams interleaved with each other such that the first column is from the first stream, the second column is from the second stream, and the third is from the third stream. Concatenated STS (OC) frames carry only one column of path overhead because they cannot be divided into finer granularity signals. Hence, OC-3c can transmit more payload to accommodate a CEPT-4 139.264 Mbit/s signal. The payload rate is 149.76 Mbit/s and overhead is 5.76 Mbit/s. OC-12 / STM-4 OC-12 is a network line with transmission speeds of up to 622.08 Mbit/s (payload: 601.344 Mbit/s; overhead: 20.736 Mbit/s). OC-12 lines are commonly used by ISPs as wide area network (WAN) connections. While a large ISP would not use an OC-12 as a backbone (main link), it would for smaller, regional or local connections. This connection speed is also often used by mid-sized (below Tier 2) internet customers, such as web hosting companies or smaller ISPs buying service from larger ones. OC-24 OC-24 is a network line with transmission speeds of up to 1244.16 Mbit/s (payload: 1202.208 Mbit/s (1.202208 Gbit/s); overhead: 41.472 Mbit/s). Implementations of OC-24 in commercial deployments are rare. OC-48 / STM-16 / 2.5G SONET OC-48 is a network line with transmission speeds of up to 2488.32 Mbit/s (payload: 2405.376 Mbit/s (2.405376 Gbit/s); overhead: 82.944 Mbit/s). With relatively inexpensive interface prices, and being faster than OC-3, OC-12 connections, and even surpassing gigabit Ethernet, OC-48 connections are used as the backbones of many regional ISPs. Interconnections between large ISPs for purposes of peering or transit are quite common. As of 2005, the only connections in widespread use that surpass OC-48 speeds are OC-192 and 10 Gigabit Ethernet. OC-48 is also used as transmission speed for tributaries from OC-192 nodes in order to optimize card slot utilization where lower speed deployments are used. Dropping at OC-12, OC-3 or STS-1 speeds are more commonly found on OC-48 terminals, where use of these cards on an OC-192 would not allow for full use of the available bandwidth. OC-192 / STM-64 / 10G SONET OC-192 is a network line with transmission speeds of up to 9953.28 Mbit/s (payload: 9510.912 Mbit/s (9.510912 Gbit/s); overhead: 442.368 Mbit/s). A standardized variant of 10 Gigabit Ethernet (10GbE), called WAN PHY, is designed to inter-operate with OC-192 transport equipment while the common version of 10GbE is called LAN PHY (which is not compatible with OC-192 transport equipment in its native form). The naming is somewhat misleading, because both variants can be used on a wide area network. OC-768 / STM-256 OC-768 is a network line with transmission speeds of up to 39,813.12 Mbit/s (payload: 38,486.016 Mbit/s (38.486016 Gbit/s); overhead: 1,327.104 Mbit/s (1.327104 Gbit/s)). On October 23, 2008, AT&T; announced the completion of upgrades to OC-768 on 80,000 fiber-optic wavelength miles of their IP/MPLS backbone network. OC-768 SONET interfaces have been available with short-reach optical interfaces from Cisco since 2006. Infinera made a field trial demonstration data transmission on a live production network involving the service transmission of a 40 Gbit/s OC-768/STM-256 service over a 1,969 km terrestrial network spanning Europe and the U.S. In November 2008, an OC-768 connection was successfully brought up on the TAT-14/SeaGirt transatlantic cable,\\"First Transatlantic 40G IP-Router--(optics only)--IP- Router link\\" (via archive.org).

The type species, Nothronychus mckinleyi, was described by James Kirkland and Douglas G. Wolfe in 2001. It was recovered near New Mexico's border with Arizona, in an area known as the Zuni Basin, from rocks assigned to the Moreno Hill Formation, dating to the late Cretaceous period (mid-Turonian stage), around 91 million years ago. A second specimen, described in 2009 as a second species, Nothronychus graffami, was found in the Tropic Shale of Utah, dating to the early Turonian, between one million and a half million years older than N. mckinleyi. Nothronychus were bulky herbivorous theropods with wide, sloth- like hip (resembling that of the non-related ornithischians), four-toed feet with all four toes facing forward, elongated necks and prominent arms with sharp claws. Both species were similar in dimensions, in length and weighing approximately . N. graffami was slightly robust than N. mckinleyi though. History of discovery Known elements from N. mckinleyi in blue, N. graffami in red and both species in purple The first fossil evidence later attributed to Nothronychus was discovered by a team of paleontologists working in the Zuni Basin of New Mexico at the Haystack Butte site, Moreno Hill Formation. A therizinosaur ischium (a hip bone) had originally been mistaken for a squamosal, a part of the skull crest of the newly discovered ceratopsian Zuniceratops. However, closer examination revealed the true identity of the bone, and soon more parts of the skeleton were found. The New Mexico team, led by paleontologists Jim Kirkland and Doug Wolfe, published their find in the Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology on 22 August 2001, making it the type specimen of the new species Nothronychus mckinleyi. The Arizona Republic newspaper, however, was first to announce the name on 19 June 2001, in a column by R.E. Molnar. The generic name, Nothronychus, is derived from Greek ŒΩœâŒ∏œÅœåœÇ (nothros, meaning slothful) and ·ΩÑŒΩœÖŒæ (onyx, meaning claw). The specific name, mckinleyi, honours rancher Bobby McKinley on whose land the fossil findings were made. The holotype, specimen MSM P2106, consists of very sparse skull fragments, a braincase, some vertebrae and parts of the shoulder girdle, forelimbs, pelvis and hindlimbs. Localities where MSM P2106 and UMNH VP 16420 have been found A second, more complete specimen, UMNH VP 16420, was discovered from the Tropic Shale Formation (dating to the early Turonian stage) of southern Utah in 2000 by Merle Graffam, a resident of Big Water, Utah. The area around Big Water had been subject to several expeditions by teams from the Museum of Northern Arizona (MNA), and was known for its abundance of marine reptile fossils, especially plesiosaurs. During part of the late Cretaceous period, the region had been submerged under a shallow sea, the Western Interior Seaway, and preserves extensive marine deposits. Graffam's initial discovery (a large, isolated toe bone) came as a surprise to colleagues, as it clearly belonged to a land-dwelling dinosaur, rather than a plesiosaur. However, the location of the bone at the time would have been nearly 100 kilometers from the Cretaceous shoreline. An excavation of the area by an MNA crew revealed more of the skeleton, and the scientists found that it was a therizinosaur, and the first example of that group to be found in the Americas. All previous therizinosaur fossils had come from China and Mongolia. Between both species, N. graffami is the most complete but lacks the skull. The Utah specimen studied by the MNA team was found to be closely related to N. mckinleyi, though it differed in build (being heavier) and age (about half a million years older). The MNA specimen was first announced in two 2002 talks during the 54th meeting of the Rocky Mountain Geological Society of America. It was later discussed in an issue of Arizona Geology as a distinct species from N. mckinleyi, but not named. The specimen was classified and named as the new species Nothronychus graffami by Lindsay Zanno and colleagues in the journal Proceedings of the Royal Society B on 15 July 2009. N. graffami was named for Graffam, who discovered the original specimens. A reconstructed skeleton of N. graffami went on display at the MNA in September 2007. In 2015, Hedrick and colleagues conducted a large osteological revision of both species and their respective specimens concluding that Nothronychus was one of the most complete and well-known therizinosaurids. Description Size comparison between N. mckinleyi and N. graffami The genus Nothronychus can be distinguished from other therizinosaur taxa based on the distinctly subcircular obturator process; an elongated obturator foramen towards the bottom; the contact area between pubis and ischium is restricted to the upper half of the obturator projection; deep cut between towards the bottom facet of the obturator process and frontal ischial shaft. Both species, N. mckinleyi and N. graffami, were similar in size with equal sized humeri (upper arm) ( and respectively), covering in length and about in weight. Nothronychus were ponderous animals with large \\"pot-bellied\\" abdomens, long necks, and stocky hindlimbs with four-toed feet. The arms were relatively large with dexterous hands equipped with up to long curved and sharply-pointed claws on their fingers. In addition, the tail was reduced in length but more flexible. N. mckinleyi was different from N. graffami in being slightly less robust as well as details of the tail vertebrae, and a more bent ulna (lower arm bone). Classification Nothronychus were members of the Coelurosauria, the theropod group composed mainly by carnivorous dinosaurs. However, more specifically, Nothronychus form part of the sub-group Maniraptora, theropods which evolved into partial omnivores and, in the case of Nothronychus and their family, plant-eaters. Nothronychus mckinleyi was in 2001 assigned to the Therizinosauridae given the derived features of the genus. In 2010, Lindsay E. Zanno performed a large and comprehensive analysis of the Therizinosauria. The cladistic analysis performed recovered both N. mckinleyi and N. graffami as a sister group. Most of the data provided by Zanno was used by Hartman and collagues in 2019 during an extensive phylogenetic analysis for the Coelurosauria. Nothronychus was recovered as a therizinosaurid taxon with both species in derived positions. Below are the obtained results for the Therizinosauridae: Paleobiology Cranial endocast of N. mckinleyi In 2018, the holotype braincase of Nothronychus mckinleyi was re-examined by Smith and colleagues updating numerous basicranial and soft-tissues aspects. They noted that the braincase has particularly large pneumatic chambers on the sensorial areas, suggesting that the increased tympanic systems would result in optimal low frequency sound reception, possibly infrasound, and in complex social behavior. The enlarged cochlea and presence of enlarged pneumatic chambers near the middle ear also supports this insight. Smith and colleagues established an average hearing frequency of 1100 to 1450 Hz and upper limits of 3000 to 3700 Hz. They stated however, that these estimates could be slightly exaggerated. Also, N. mckinleyi retained elongated semicircular canals in the ear, which are more related to an active, predatory life-syle. This trait indicates that most therizinosaurids (possibly all therizinosaurs) retained the ancestral, carnivorous ear configuration‚àípreviously suggested for Erlikosaurus. Finally, based on Erlikosaurus, N. mckinleyi may have had a relatively horizontal head posture, which is associated with overlapping visual fields and binocular vision, given the orientation of the horizontal semicircular canal relative to the horizontal orientation of the occipital condyle.

Though the company had published many 'cult hits', it was known best to fans as the long-time exclusive US publisher of the Lunar series. The company was one of the few game publishers that attempted to bridge the cultural gap between the Japanese and American video game industries during the 1990s with an eclectic selection of releases from various genres, and was also one of the earliest American publishers to make use of the CD-ROM format for full, spoken English dialogue in their products at a time when voice acting was not a common feature in most mainstream games. On December 12, 2005, Victor Ireland, President of Working Designs, announced via the company's message board that it was closing its doors. He later started a new company called Gaijinworks. History Working Designs was initially founded as a software company focusing on logging management software for the IBM PC. After lead programmer Todd Mark's death in 1988, Victor Ireland was hired to complete Mark's unfinished work before transitioning the company to a game publisher in 1990. Working Designs published games for the Sega CD and TurboGrafx-CD due to the appeal of the CD medium, instead of the more popular cartridge-based Super Nintendo Entertainment System and Sega Genesis. The company released some of their games with premium packaging for higher prices. They applied foil stamps and extensive artwork to their packaging and supplied games with full color manuals with anime artwork and concept art at a time when many game manuals for Western releases were in greyscale. Also, every manual came with notes describing the translation process and procedure of their games, usually found on the last page of the manual. Every edition of these notes closed with the signature phrase, \\"We're nothing without you!\\" Working Designs became known for their incorporating quirky, distinctively American humor in their translations. President Victor Ireland maintained that the company has always adhered as closely to the original Japanese text as they could while making it understandable to U.S. audiences, and said the addition of American-style humor was necessary to replace Japanese jokes which most Americans would not be able to understand. When the Sony PlayStation and Sega Saturn were released, Working Designs met with Sony Computer Entertainment America (SCEA, whose president at the time was Bernie Stolar). SCEA said they had no interest in seeing non-action games released for the PlayStation, and as Working Designs published mainly strategy games and RPGs, this led them to begin publishing exclusively for the Sega Saturn. Working Designs had also built a strong working relationship with Sega by this time. Working Designs often postponed releases for upwards of a year. The final Sega Saturn game released in the US, Magic Knight Rayearth, was delayed for over two years. Following Stolar's departure from Sony, Working Designs began working on games for the PlayStation, for which they released the most single titles on a console (10 titles) in their history, and continued to branch out by introducing their \\"Spaz\\" label of arcade-style shoot 'em ups. Following E3 1997, where Ireland complained that Sega of America assigned them an out-of-the-way booth and was giving away information about the upcoming Dreamcast console to the detriment of the Saturn market, Working Designs announced they would publish no more Saturn games beyond the four that were then in progress. The company finally managed to get the rights to Arc the Lad and its sequels, which Sony's new management insisted that they bundle together as one game. Ireland's feud with Sega led them to ignore Sega's Dreamcast in favor of the PlayStation 2, but friction with Sony's approval process was starting to cost Working Designs money. Working Designs did not publish for the Nintendo GameCube or Microsoft's Xbox system. Ireland had been pursuing the rights to titles on both consoles, but kept finding himself outbid on the few titles that matched his company's skills. When asked why he passed on Lunar Legend for the Game Boy Advance, a title he already owned the right of first-refusal on, he said it was because the game was mediocre and because he still disliked the expense of publishing cartridges. He initially dismissed the Nintendo DS, saying that although production costs had come down significantly, the high wait times were still costly, and endorsed Sony's PlayStation Portable (PSP) and may have been pursuing titles for that handheld. Upon his company's demise, Ireland quietly withdrew his support of the PSP, and voiced his support for the Xbox 360. Due to a series of delays, approval snags, and sagging sales, Working Designs announced on December 12, 2005 that all existing staff had been laid off and the company was effectively defunct. In a public statement posted on the message board hosted at Working Designs' official site, President Victor Ireland, though expressing much gratitude for strong core fan support over the years, stated that a series of complications related to the approval of upcoming games for the PlayStation 2 had created a loss of revenue from which the company would not be able to recover. Ireland however went on to express optimism that a possible publishing deal may occur in the future with the support of remaining WD staff, likely for the Xbox 360.

Width: 18 5/8 in. (47.3 cm). For profile view see below. Kraak ware or Kraak porcelain (Dutch Kraakporselein) is a type of Chinese export porcelain produced mainly in the late Ming Dynasty, in the Wanli reign (1573‚Äì1620), but also in the Tianqi (1620-1627) and the Chongzhen (1627-1644).Vinhais L and Welsh J: Kraak Porcelain: the Rise of Global Trade in the 16th and early 17th centuries. Jorge Welsh Books 2008, p. 17 It was among the first Chinese export wares to arrive in Europe in mass quantities, and was frequently featured in Dutch Golden Age paintings of still life subjects with foreign luxuries. The wares have \\"suffered from imprecise terminology\\", sometimes being loosely used for many varieties of Chinese export blue and white pottery. Strictly defined, it \\"is distinguished by the arrangement of its ornament into panels; these usually radiate to a bracketed rim notorious for its liability to chip\\".Vainker, 147 It is a sub-class of Jingdezhen ware, mostly made as \\"deep bowls and wide dishes\\", decorated with motifs from nature, in a style not used on wares for the domestic Chinese market.Vainker, 147 Profile view of Jingdezhen dish above The quality of the porcelain used to form Kraak ware is much disputed among scholars; some claim that it is surprisingly good, in certain cases indistinguishable from that produced on the domestic market;Howard, p. 1 of \\"Introduction;\\" Crowe, p. 11 others imply that it is a dismal shadow of the truly fine ceramics China was capable of producing.Kerr, p. 38. Rinaldi comes to a more even-handed conclusion, noting that it \\"forms a middle category between much heavier wares, often coarse, and definitely finer wares with well levigated clay and smooth glaze that does not shrink on the rim... \\" Thus looking at ceramic production in China at the time from a larger prospective, Kraak ware falls between the best examples and a typical provincial output, such as the contemporary Swatow ware, also made for export, but to South-East Asia and Japan.Rinaldi, pp. 12, 67. Name Jan Davidsz de Heem, Still Life with Fruit and Lobster, second half of 17th century; Oil on canvas, 75 √ó 105 cm; Museum Boymans-van Beuningen, Rotterdam Kraak porcelain is believed to be named after the Portuguese ships (Carracks), in which it was transported. Carrak‚Äîor caracca in Italian or Spanish‚Äîis itself believed to be a derivative of the Arabic term for the type of trading ships used in Renaissance Mediterranean trade: qaraquir, meaning simply merchant vessels.Rinaldi, p. 32 Although the link with Carrak ships is generally accepted as the root of the name Kraak ware, other origins of the label have also been proposed. For example, Rinaldi points out that in Dutch the verb kraken means to break - a characteristic that certainly is common among Kraak wares. Moreover, the term refers to the type of shelves that often displayed import blue and white porcelains in Friesland, in the north of the Netherlands.Rinaldi, p. 60; Kerr, p. 38. Style Relatively unusual Kraak armorial porcelain, for the Wittelsbach family; Wanli reign Kraak ware is almost all painted in the underglaze cobalt blue and white porcelain style that was perfected under the Ming dynasty, although a few examples of dishes over-painted with vitreous enamel glaze have survived. It is often decorated with variations on the more traditional motifs found on Chinese porcelain, such as stylized flowers (peonies and chrysanthemums) and Buddhist auspicious emblems. However, most characteristic of Kraak decoration is the use of foliated radial panels. In other words, the surface of the porcelain is divided into segments, each containing its own discrete image. Shapes included dishes, bowls, and vases. Kraak ware bowls fall into roughly two types; the first is a deep, unrimmed Chinese style bowl, taking roughly the same shape as the Qing enameled cup, (at left). The second type are called klapmutsen. A klapmuts is somewhat akin to what we would today call a soup-bowl‚Äîa broader-based, rimmed style that was new in the Chinese repertoire, and seems to have been exclusively exported to Europe. (Two such examples are at the center of de Heem's Still Life, above: one holds fruit, and the other a shaved ham.) The specialist Maura Rinaldi suggests that the latter type was designed specifically to serve a European clientele, since there do not seem to be many surviving examples elsewhere in the world, even in the spectacular Topkapƒ± Palace collection, which houses the most extensive selection of Kraak ware of all. Noting the importance of soups and stews in European diet, Rinaldi proposes that klapmusten were developed to satisfy a foreign demand, noting that the heavy, long-handled, metal spoon that is common in Europe would have toppled and chipped the high-walled Chinese bowl.Rinaldi, pp. 11, 118.

As noted above, it made a frequent appearance in the sumptuous Dutch paintings of the seventeenth century (see also the detail of de Heem's Banquet Still Life, at right).For a study on foreign objects in Dutch paintings, see Hochstrasser, Still Life and Trade. Today a great deal is learned about Kraak ware through excavation of shipwrecks by marine archaeologists. Because the wreck can usually be dated with some degree of certainty, its contents provides a clear snapshot of production at the moment the vessel went down. Moreover, its location can also indicate its destination point, thus revealing much about international trade routes and outposts at the time.Carswell, p. 168. In contrast to the other major European imports of the time (for example textiles or spices), ceramics are able to withstand exposure to water, thus making it the ideal merchandise to serve as ballast cargo in the great ships.Crowe, p. 20; and Howard, p. 6 of \\"Introduction.\\" Yet from another perspective, porcelain's durability in this sense, even withstanding centuries of submersion at the bottom of the sea, means that it has been the good that has endured (sometimes even intact) to tell these tales.For a fascinating recent account, brilliantly illustrated, see J√∂rg, Porcelain from the Vung Tau wreck.

Between them, they played 231 Test matches, taking 853 wickets. They were one of the most deadly combinations in world cricket, especially on the dusty subcontinental pitches. The spin quartet was instrumental in producing many Indian Test victories. There was only one match in which all four of them were in the starting XI: usually one of the off spinners, Prasanna or Venkataraghavan, was left out. However, these four men made important contributions to some of India's greatest triumphs, including Test series victories in the West Indies and England, as well as Test victories in Australia and New Zealand. In 2004, the Board of Control for Cricket in India conferred on them the CK Nayudu award, named after India's first Test captain. Beginnings By the 1966-67 season, the interest in cricket in India had risen to unprecedented levels. Despite being beaten by the West Indies at home, the Indian team's spirits were not dampened. The captain Nawab of Pataudi thought that it would be a good idea to introduce more quality spinners into the team in order to compensate for the absence of good new-ball bowlers in the country.The birth of a spin quartet, ESPNCricinfo: http://www.espncricinfo.com/india/content/story/122156.html Bhagwat Chandrasekhar, the leg spinner, had already established his place in the team with solid performances against Australia and the West Indies. Erapalli Prasanna was making his comeback having been out of the team for five years, while both Venkatarghavan and Bedi played in the series against West Indies. All four of them played their first (and only) game together against England at Birmingham in the summer of 1967.Scorecard, 3rd Test, India vs England, Birmingham, 1967: http://www.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/match/63006.html Prasanna and Chandrasekhar impressed in that game, claiming 7 and 6 wickets respectively, and all four bowlers bowled a tight line. Even though these four bowlers continued to play for 11 more years, this remained the only Test where all of them featured in the Indian test XI. Successes Over the years, the spin quartet played vital roles in several memorable victories for the Indian team, starting with an overseas series win against New Zealand in 1967-68. Below are some major Test successes the quartet were a part of: * Away series victory against New Zealand, 1967-68 * Away series victory against West Indies, 1970-71 * Away series victory against England, 1971 * Home series victory against England, 1972-73 * Home series victory against New Zealand, 1976-77 * Home series victory against West Indies, 1978‚Äì79 * Home series victory against Australia, 1979-80 * Home series victory against Pakistan, 1979-80 * Drawn away series against Australia, 1980-81 * Home series victory against England, 1981-82 Out of the four, only Venkataraghavan and Bedi played regular one-day cricket for India. Prasanna never played ODIs, and Chandrasekhar played just one game, against New Zealand in 1976. Bedi and Venkatarghavan played in 10 ODIs together, which included the World Cups of 1975 and 1979. Statistics The spin quartet played a combined 231 Tests for India from 1962 to 1983, and grabbed 853 wickets, with 43 five-wicket inning hauls.Hall of Fame- The Spin Quartet, Indian Cricket Fever: http://www.cricketnetwork.co.uk/main/s119/st25857.php Much of this success can be attributed to the different bowling styles these bowlers possessed. Bedi was an orthodox left arm-spinner, while Chandrasekhar an attacking leg-break bowler whereas Prasanna and Venkataraghavan were both off-spinners. This way, they could target all kinds of batsmen in the opposition and give their captains plenty of options. It was Chandrasekhar and Bedi who were the leaders of the attack. The two played 42 Tests alongside each other and had almost similar figures, of 184 wickets each. Bedi averaged 27.22, while Chandra averaged 28.70 in these games.Bowling records, Test matches- Bishen Bedi and Bhagwat Chandrasekhar: http://stats.espncricinfo.com/ci/engine/stats/index.html?class=1;filter=advanced;orderby=wickets;player_involve=1219;player_involve=1290;player_involve_type=all;template=results;type=bowling ReferencesExternal links *The Fantastic Four of Indian Cricket Category:India in international cricket Category:Nicknamed groups of sportspeople ","title":"Indian spin quartet"},{"id":"1861318","text":"The Crusade and Death of Richard I is a mid-13th-century Anglo-Norman prose chronicle by an anonymous author.

It was founded by Joseph Matt on 7 October 1867. Unlike diocesan publications or those of religious institutes, the newspaper is independent of ecclesiastical oversight. Overview The Wanderer gives the following self-description: :The Wanderer, a national Catholic weekly journal of news, commentary, and analysis, has been publishing continually since 1867. Owned and operated by Catholic laymen, The Wanderer is independent of ecclesiastical oversight but maintains a fiercely loyal adherence to Catholic doctrine and discipline. It was originally published in Milwaukee, Wisconsin in German to minister to German immigrants to Minnesota, Wisconsin, and the Dakotas who were being \\"attracted to and influenced by Masonic and quasi-Masonic German-language newspapers and organizations.\\" A German language edition was published until 1957. The English edition began in 1931. History Early on, it was a major opponent of a perceived \\"Americanizing\\" of the Church. That tendency was addressed by Pope Leo XIII in his 1899 apostolic letter, Testem benevolentiae nostrae. It claims to have been one of the first newspapers to decry Nazi ascendancy as anti-Christian, and opposed Russia's participation in the Allied response as an \\"unholy alliance\\". The Wanderer was also noticed by Joseph Stalin in these efforts, as a repudiation of the paper's stance was published in Pravda. Among the initial acts of the Nazi party to control the press in 1933 was a ban on The Wanderer German-language edition (some 3,000 German subscribers). Through the Vatican II years, a dispute over the Council led to Walter Matt leaving The Wanderer to his brother, Alphonse Matt, and founding The Remnant in 1967. As The Wanderer states, \\"... the council was not a rejection or an abandonment of tradition, but a development of that tradition, safeguarded for 2,000 years by the Holy Spirit, to better enable the Church to continue to bring the gospel to all men.\\" ReferencesFurther reading  External links * Category:Catholic newspapers published in the United States Category:Publications established in 1867 Category:Weekly newspapers published in the United States ","title":"The Wanderer (Catholic newspaper)"},{"id":"1861335","text":"Kevin McMahon (born September 21, 1953) is a musician, singer, and songwriter for the long-standing bands Lucky Pierre and Prick. McMahon began recording with his new wave group Lucky Pierre in 1974, releasing a number of vinyl singles though 1981. Lucky Pierre initially consisted of: John Guciardo- Lead Guitar, Brian Dempsey- Drums, Dennis DeVito- Bass and McMahon on Guitar & Lead Vocals. In 1976, Tom Lash joined the band on bass guitar, and DeVito moved to guitar. Tom Miller played keyboards at this time. In 1977, Dempsey left the band and was replaced by drummer Gary Shay, and then drummer Dave Zima. After many live shows, both Tom Miller and John Gusciardo left Cleveland for California and DeVito switched to lead guitar. Many showcase concerts, radio broadcasts, and a few 45RPM singles followed. Lucky Pierre continued as a four-piece outfit, sometimes augmented by horns and vocalists to perform the array of song styles McMahon was developing. McMahon then went on hiatus until 1988, when Lucky Pierre recorded the Communiqu√© EP with Guciardo, Lash, Zima. Lucky Pierre disbanded again after the recording of Communiqu√©, but McMahon remained in contact with the band's manager, John Malm Jr. Shortly after the release of the Nine Inch Nails album Pretty Hate Machine, Trent Reznor played keyboard for McMahon's live shows in London during November of 1989, and Reznor started his tour of Europe the following month. Prick later toured with Nine Inch Nails and David Bowie in 1995, and McMahon is still in contact with Reznor. During the early 1990s, McMahon began his second musical project, the industrial rock band Prick. Prick was eventually signed to Reznor's Nothing Records label. The band's debut self-titled album was released in 1995. Prick's lead single, \\"Animal,\\" received high rotation on MuchMusic and MTV, and Prick opened for Nine Inch Nails' and David Bowie's Outside tour World Tour. McMahon would also be a temporary member of Nine Inch Nails, playing guitar on a short tour in 1995. The band would also perform 2 Prick songs on these nights, with McMahon sharing vocals with Reznor. Prick re-emerged in 2002 with The Wreckard, independently released by McMahon and featuring many songs once slated for the second, canceled Nothing Records album. Two years later, McMahon released Lucky Pierre's first full album, ThinKing, again selling the album independently online. In October 2008, McMahon released the hard-rock track \\"Runaway Brain,\\" this time under the moniker ( sic ). The song was available from the fansite http://www.luckyprick.net/ for a limited time, with a note in the MP3's metadata noting, \\"prick or treat ‚Äì derailing things to come from luckypierremusic ‚Äì THIS NOVEMBER (or ...it all depends on the speed of green).\\" In an interview released in March 2009 on the fansite http://www.luckyprick.net/ , McMahon talked about possible future releases, and also announced that http://www.luckypierremusic.com/ will be online again, with merchandising an re-releases of The Wreckard and ThinKing (in new packagings) for sale, and maybe re-mastered tracks of Lucky Pierre. On June 21, 2009, luckypierremusic.com went live, offering digital downloads, new and vintage shirts and hats, and new CDs. As alluded to previously, The Wreckard and ThinKing are being reissued, and the Fear of Blue and (sic) album and EP are also being released.

Owned and operated by Entercom, the station carries an all news radio format on weekdays, switching to mostly non-political talk radio nights and weekends. Syndicated shows include The Dave Ramsey Show, The Clark Howard Show, Our American Stories with Lee Habeeb and America in the Morning. Some weekends hours carry paid brokered programming. Most hours begin with CBS Radio News. The studios and offices are in Uptown Dallas. KRLD is a Class A, 50,000 watt, clear channel station. The daytime signal is non-directional, covering North Texas and part of Oklahoma. KRLD shares AM 1080 with Class A WTIC Hartford, so at night, KRLD switches to a directional antenna, using a two-tower array.

Station history KRLD first signed on the air in October 1926.Broadcasting Yearbook 1977 page C-203 It was originally owned by Radio Laboratories of Dallas, hence the call sign. At first it was on the air for six hours each day, except on Wednesdays when the station closed down to make repairs and recharge the batteries. The Dallas Times Herald, then published by Edwin J. Kiest, purchased KRLD within a year of its debut, in 1927. Since 1939, KRLD has broadcast at a power of 50,000 watts, the highest allowed by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). In the summer of 1941, KRLD moved to 1080 on the AM dial as a result of the North American Regional Broadcasting Agreement (NARBA). During the Golden Age of Radio, KRLD carried CBS network programming, including dramas, comedies, news, sports, game shows, soap operas and big band broadcasts. KRLD expanded into FM radio in 1948 with the original KRLD-FM 92.5 (now KZPS). The following year, it added a TV station, KRLD-TV Channel 4, (now KDFW). For most of the 1960s and 70s, KRLD ran blocks of different local programming, including Middle of the Road and Country music, with some news and talk. In April 1978, KRLD switched from a music-based format to become, at the time, the third news and information station in Dallas/Fort Worth. KRLD originally broadcast from the Adolphus Hotel in Dallas and for a time had its main studios in Arlington, Texas at Ameriquest Field, now known as Globe Life Park in Arlington. In the summer of 2005, the station moved operations to a 5th floor office at the southwest corner of North Fitzhugh Avenue and Central Expressway in Dallas. KRLD achieved several firsts in the field of radio broadcasting: *first station to present live broadcasts of high school and college football games. *first to offer continuous election returns. *first to broadcast live music and entertainment programs. The Big D Jamboree, which originated from the since-demolished Dallas Sportatorium, was a regular Saturday fixture on KRLD in the 1950s and 1960s. KRLD also aired wrestling matches from the Sportatorium, with longtime sportscaster Bill Mercer calling the action. History books dispute whether KRLD, KDKA Pittsburgh or WEAF New York (today WFAN) was the first station to broadcast commercial announcements on radio. Branch Davidian leader David Koresh used KRLD to broadcast his messages in 1993 during his standoff with the government and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, near Waco, Texas. Blue and red variant of the KRLD logo used from around 1999 to 2006. During the 1970s and 1980s, KRLD was the flagship station for the NFL's Dallas Cowboys, with Brad Sham providing color analysis and later play-by-play. (Sham continues as the Cowboys' lead voice, though the team's games now air on sister station KRLD-FM.) Beginning in 1995, KRLD served as the radio flagship of the MLB's Texas Rangers. In 2009, weekday games moved from KRLD to KRLD-FM. KRLD relinquished the Rangers' English language radio rights in 2011 to sports radio station 103.3 KESN. Rangers broadcasts returned to KRLD-FM in 2015 with broadcasts moving over to KRLD (AM) when conflicting with other programming, such as Cowboy games, on the FM channel.

Their style can be considered a mixture of indie, alternative, punk and folk music, with elements of 1960s and 1970s pop music. Though Means and Ruess are the foremost members of the band, they have played, toured, and recorded with Mike Schey, Mark Buzard, Don Raymond, and for the DVD recording and summer 2007 tour, The Honorary Title's drummer Adam Boyd. The Format chose their name to make fun of the music industry's inclination towards a cookie-cutter \\"format\\" for a hit. Formed in 2002, the band announced a hiatus on February 4, 2008. On February 4, 2020, they announced a return from their hiatus for a tour of special shows. History Before forming The Format in February 2002, Means and Ruess, who had been friends since grade school, formed the band Nevergonnascore and released the EP \\"The Byron Sessions\\" which had generated some record label interest but not a deal. The duo's first single, aptly titled \\"The First Single\\" from their five-song demo, EP, became locally popular on Phoenix radio station KEDJ and led to the duo signing with Elektra Records in 2002. Their first studio album, Interventions + Lullabies, recorded and produced by R. Walt Vincent and released in October 2003, was very successful around the Phoenix area. The band's fan base grew due to word of mouth, the Internet, and extensive touring. The album sold over 100,000 copies in the US. l After Elektra folded, The Format released a second EP, Snails, with sister label Atlantic Records in April 2005. As they began to work on their second full-length album, they drew on the influences of 1970s pop music, including Harry Nilsson, Electric Light Orchestra and The Beach Boys, and decided to collaborate with Redd Kross founder Steven Shane McDonald whom they brought on as record producer. But Atlantic Records executives were not impressed by the 1970s-pop-influenced demos and released The Format from its contract. Upon completing the album, Dog Problems, Ruess and Means, with help from their management company, decided to release it themselves through their newly established imprint label: The Vanity Label. Two months prior to the album's release, an MP3 version was leaked to the internet. In response, The Format decided to make the album immediately available digitally for only $7.99 via the Nettwerk Music Store, which led to the sale of over 2,000 digital copies prior to the album's official release. Dog Problems was released in stores on July 11, 2006. The day the album was released, an episode of MTV's My Super Sweet 16 featuring The Format aired, on which they performed at a birthday-graduation party for Priya and Divya Kothapalli from Nederland, Texas. Following the release of Dog Problems, The Format gained more attention, receiving high marks from various publications, even topping some Best of 2006 lists. During this year, The Format toured near constantly, supporting their own album Dog Problems as well as supporting The All American Rejects in September in the UK. In 2007, The Format played a show in Tokyo, Japan, were featured on Last Call with Carson Daly twice, co-headlined with Guster on their Campus Consciousness tour, and toured with Reubens Accomplice, Piebald, Limbeck, Steel Train, and The Honorary Title. On June 25, 2007, celebrating the one-year anniversary of Dog Problems, The Format offered the album in its entirety, including the liner notes in PDF form, for free on their official website. The offer was valid from June 25 to July 16, 2007. As of July 10, 2007, 36,000 people had downloaded the album. On February 4, 2008, The Format announced that they would be putting the band on hiatus, with Nate Ruess posting the following message on the band's website: Means has completed solo work, including scoring the soundtrack to the film The Sinking of Santa Isabel, as well as forming Destry with former Straylight Run singer Michelle DaRosa. When asked about the band getting back together, Ruess acknowledged that \\"every one of us like to remain optimistic and hopeful that it one day could happen.\\" Following The Format's 2008 breakup, Ruess joined with Andrew Dost of Anathallo and Jack Antonoff of Steel Train to form Fun, a band that has gone on to more commercial success than any of its associated former acts, with the pop hits \\"We Are Young\\" and \\"Some Nights\\" becoming some of the most popular songs of 2012. Fun began recording their debut album, Aim and Ignite, in September 2008 with producer Steven Shane McDonald and arranger Roger Joseph Manning Jr.; it was released on August 25, 2009. On February 3, 2020, the band formally re-released their 2007 concert film Live At The Mayan to streaming services and vinyl (previously only available on DVD.) The band also reunited for a live screening of the film and their first acoustic concert in over 12 years. The next day, the band announced a reunion in the spring of 2020 with concerts in Chicago, New York, and Phoenix. In March 2020, their tour (originally scheduled for March and April 2020) was postponed to July 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In June 2020, it was postponed again to July 2021.

No. 1 LCCN2004665373 Rowlandson‚Äôs humbugging depicts the public as a credulous simpleton being distracted by a display of ‚Äúthe miraculous‚Äù, the better to have his pockets picked. A humbug is a person or object that behaves in a deceptive or dishonest way, often as a hoax or in jest. The term was first described in 1751 as student slang, and recorded in 1840 as a \\"nautical phrase\\". It is now also often used as an exclamation to describe something as hypocritical nonsense or gibberish. When referring to a person, a humbug means a fraud or impostor, implying an element of unjustified publicity and spectacle. In modern usage, the word is most associated with the character Ebenezer Scrooge, created by Charles Dickens in his 1843 novella A Christmas Carol. His famous reference to Christmas, \\"Bah! Humbug!\\", declaring Christmas to be a fraud, is commonly used in stage and screen versions and also appeared frequently in the original book. The word is also prominently used in the 1900 book The Wizard of Oz, in which the Scarecrow refers to the Wizard as a humbug, and the Wizard agrees. Alternative root based on Millers Fly Leaves: During continental war in the 1700s many false reports and lying bulletins were fabricated in Hamburg, Germany. The phrase ‚Äòthis is Hamburg‚Äô was in Britain shortened to ‚ÄòHumbugs‚Äô. This then is a statement of disbelief I.e. Bah Humbug. If one says ‚Äòyou had that from Hamburg‚Äô, it is an expression of incredulity. We don‚Äôt know who Miller was. This explanation was taken from A Treatise on humbug by a Manchester Man, volume 1, 1866. Another use of the word was by John Collins Warren, a Harvard Medical School professor who worked at Massachusetts General Hospital. Dr. Warren performed the first public operation with the use of ether anesthesia, administered by William Thomas Green Morton, a dentist. To the stunned audience at the Massachusetts General Hospital, Warren declared, \\"Gentlemen, this is no humbug.\\"  Etymology  The oldest known written uses of the word are in the book The Student (1750‚Äì1751), ii. 41, where it is called \\"a word very much in vogue with the people of taste and fashion\\", and in Ferdinando Killigrew's The Universal Jester, subtitled \\"a choice collection of many conceits ... bon-mots and humbugs\\" from 1754; as mentioned in Encyclop√¶dia Britannica from 1911, which further refers to the New English Dictionary. There are many theories as to the origin of the term, none of which has been proven: * Charles Godfrey Leland mentions the idea that the word could be derived from the Norse word hum, meaning 'night' or 'shadow', and the word bugges (used in the Bible), a variant of bogey, meaning 'apparitions'.Charles Godfrey Leland, Gypsy Sorcery and Fortune Telling [1891], Chapter X of The Haunts, Homes, and Habits of Witches in The South Slavic Lands--Bogeys and Humbugs The Norse word hum mentioned, or hume, actually means 'dark air' in Old Norwegian. From the other Scandinavian languages based on Old Norse, there is h√∫m in Icelandic which means 'twilight', h√≥mi in Faeroese which means 'unclear', and humi in Old Swedish which means 'dark suspicion', documented back to 1541. From this word is also derived the Swedish verb hymla, still in use, which means 'to conceal, hide, not commit to the truth'. * According to the Dictionary of the Vulgar Tongue by Francis Grose, 1731‚Äì1791, to hum in English indeed originally meant 'to deceive'. To combine this early medieval Scandinavian word with bugges from the English Bible of a later date may seem far-fetched. The word bug is derived from the Middle English Bugge (of which the term bogey is also derived) which is in turn a cognate of the German word b√∂gge (of which b√∂ggel- mann (\\"Goblin\\") is derived)Middle English Dictionary by Sherman M. Kuhn, Hans Kurath, Robert E. Lewis, University of Michigan Press, 1958, , page 1212Merriam-Webster's collegiate dictionary, 11th edition, Merriam-Webster, 2003, , page 162 and possibly the Norwegian dialect word bugge meaning \\"important man\\".The Merriam-Webster new book of word histories, Merriam- Webster, 1991, , page 71 The Welsh bwg (\\"ghost\\") could also be connected, and was thought in the past to be the origin of the English term however more recent studies indicate that it is a borrowing from the much older Middle English word.Metatony in Baltic, Volume 6 of Leiden studies in Indo-European by Rick Derksen, Rodopi, 1996, , , page 274Lexical reflections inspired by Slavonic *bog : English bogey from a Slavonic root?, Brian Cooper 1, Department of Slavonic Studies, University of Cambridge, Correspondence to Department of Slavonic Studies, University of Cambridge, Sidgwick Avenue, Cambridge CB3 9DAEarly Modern Northern English Lexis: A Literary Corpus-Based Study, Javier Ruano-Garcia, Peter Lang, 2010, , . pp. 242‚Äì243Studies in folk life, John Geraint Jenkins, Iorwerth Cyfeiliog Peate, Ayer Publishing, 1977,, . p. 304 Also, with bug meaning ghost or goblin, the use of the term applies in Dickens' novel about the Christmas ghosts. In Etym. Diet. of 1898, Walter Skeat also proposed a similar theory, although using contemporary versions of the words, where hum meant to murmur applause, and bug being a spectre. * It could also come from the Italian uomo bugiardo, which literally means 'lying man'. There was considerable Italian influence on English at the time (e.g. Shakespeare's numerous Italian-based plays, approximately 150 years before the first recorded use of 'humbug'). * Uim-bog is supposed to mean 'soft copper' in Irish, worthless money, but there is no evidence of a clear connection to the term. * The 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica also suggests that it is a form of \\"Hamburg\\", where false coins were minted and shipped to England during the Napoleonic wars, which is inaccurate as the Napoleonic wars occurred 50 years after the word first appeared in print. * A modern conception is that it actually refers to a humming bug‚Äîi.e. something small and inconsequential, such as a cricket, that makes a lot of noise. In Norton Juster's novel The Phantom Tollbooth, there is a large beetle-like insect known as the Humbug, who is hardly ever right about anything. The word has been used outside anglophone countries for well over a century. For instance, in Germany it has been known since the 1830s, in Sweden since at least 1862, in France since at least 1875, in Hungary, and in Finland. The line was later used by Duncan in the Thomas and Friends eighteenth series episode Duncan the Humbug.

Yixing clay () is a type of clay from the region near the city of Yixing in Jiangsu Province, China, used in Chinese pottery since the Song dynasty (960‚Äì1279) when Yixing clay was first mined around China's Lake Tai. From the 17th century on, Yixing wares were commonly exported to Europe. The finished stoneware, which is used for teaware and other small items, is usually red or brown in colour. Also known as zisha () ware, they are typically left unglazed and use clays that are very cohesive and can form coils, slabs and most commonly slip casts. These clays can also be formed by throwing. The best known wares made from Yixing clay are Yixing clay teapots, tea pets, and other teaware. Types A Yixing zisha teapot - \\"Melon\\", which combines Zi Ni and Zhu Ni clays Yixing Duan Ni teapot There are several distinct types of Yixing clay used to make stoneware: *Zi sha or zi ni (Á¥´Á†Ç or Á¥´Ê≥•; literally, \\"purple sand/clay\\"): this stoneware has a purple-red-brown colour. *Zhu sha or zhu ni (Êú±Á†Ç or Êú±Ê≥•; literally, \\"cinnabar sand/clay\\"): reddish-brown stoneware with a very high iron content. The name only refers to the sometimes bright red hue of cinnabar. Due to the increasing demand for Yixing stoneware, zhu ni is now produced in very limited quantities. Zhu ni clay is not to be confused with hong ni (Á∫¢Ê≥•, literally, \\"red clay\\"), another red clay. *Duan ni (ÈçõÊ≥•; literally, \\"fortified clay\\"): stoneware that was formulated using various stones and minerals in addition to zi ni or zhu ni clay. This results in various textures and colours, ranging from beige, blue and green to black. Mineral composition Zisha is a mixture of kaolin, quartz and mica, with a high content of iron oxide. It is mined principally at Huanglongshan and Zhaozhuangshan and has a somewhat sandy texture. The process of preparing the clay is lengthy and was traditionally regarded as a trade secret. Typical firing temperature is between 1100 ‚Äì 1200 ¬∞C in an oxidizing atmosphere.K.S. Lo, et al., The Stonewares of Yixing: from the Ming period to the Present Day, (London, 1986). Manufacturing The raw materials for Yixing clay are buried deep underground, sometimes under heavy sedimentary rock formations. When excavated, it is usually located within stratified layers of other clays. The seam of Yixing zisha can be as thick as several decimeters, up to a meter. Yixing clays consist of fine iron-containing silt, with mica, kaolinite and varying quantities of quartz and iron ores as its main mineral constituents. Processing of raw zisha Yixing clay involves removing the clay from the underlying strata, drying it under the sun in open stalls, and then pulverizing the dried clay pieces into fine particles. The clay powder then undergoes air screening to isolate clay particles of the finest grit size. The screened clay is then mixed with water in a cement mixer to a thick paste, piled into heaps, and vacuum processed to remove air bubbles, in addition to some moisture from the clay mixture. The quality and quantity of water in Yixing clay is critical in that it determines the quality of the stoneware products produced. After this processing, the resulting clay is then ready to be used. The appearance of Yixing products, such as its colour or texture, can be enriched and altered through the addition of various metal oxides into the Yixing clay, through the manipulation of firing temperatures, and also from regulating the kiln atmosphere (oxidative versus reductive).  Use  Brush rest, a cicada on a branch Yixing teawares are prized because their unglazed surfaces absorb traces of the beverage, creating a more complex flavour. For these reasons, Yixing teawares should never be washed using detergents, but rather with water only, and connoisseurs recommend using each tea vessel for one kind of tea (white, green, oolong, black, or puer) or sometimes even one variety of tea only. Early pots were designed for travel use hence you will see the simple classical look of the pots produced during the Ming dynasty. Most tea drinking enthusiast will have one teapot for travel use, these tend to be less expensive and compact in design. It was not until during the mid-Qing dynasty (18th century) that tea connoisseurs started to use the pot at home and the artisan begin to form them into different shape and sizes. Many exotic forms were conceived. Vessels were decorated with poetic inscriptions, calligraphy, paintings and seals were incised onto the surface of the teapots. Influence in Europe In the late 17th century Yixing teapots were imported to Europe along with China tea. The unfamiliar material inspired attempts to imitate it, and one Delftware manufacturer announced in 1678 that he was making \\"red teapots\\", of which no examples are known to survive. Some red stoneware by rival Dutch potters from about 1700 does survive, closely copying Yixing pots in style. Johann Friedrich B√∂ttger, famous as the pioneer of European porcelain, was in contact with some of these and developed a rival B√∂ttger ware, a dark red stoneware first sold in 1710, and manufactured and imitated by others, all up to about 1740.Osborne, 134 It is a very significant stage in the development of porcelain in Europe.The Discovery Of European Porcelain By Bottger - A Systematic Creative Development.

The succession was supported by the USSR's former members and was not objected to by the UN membership; Russia accounted for about half the Soviet Union's economy and the majority of its people and land mass; in addition, the history of the Soviet Union began in Russia. If there was to be a successor to the Soviet seat on the Security Council among the former Soviet republics, these factors made Russia seem like a logical choice. Nonetheless, due to the rather inflexible wording of the United Nations Charter and its lack of provision for succession, the succession's technical legality has been questioned by some international lawyers. History Chapter V, Article 23 of the UN Charter, adopted in 1945, provides that \\"The Security Council should consist of fifteen Members of the United Nations. The Republic of China, The French Republic, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of America shall be permanent members of the Security Council.\\" http://www.un.org/en/sections/un-charter/chapter-v/index.html Vladimir Putin at the Millennium Summit of the UN in September 2000. The USSR collapsed in late 1991. Eleven of the twelve members of the Commonwealth of Independent States signed a declaration on December 21, 1991, agreeing that \\"Member states of the Commonwealth support Russia in taking over the USSR membership in the UN, including permanent membership in the Security Council.\\" One day before the resignation of Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev, Ambassador Y. Vorontsov transmitted to the UN Secretary-General Javier P√©rez de Cu√©llar a letter from President of the Russian Federation Boris Yeltsin stating that: :the membership of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics in the United Nations, including the Security Council and all other organs and organizations of the United Nations system, is being continued by the Russian Federation (RSFSR) with the support of the countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States. In this connection, I request that the name 'Russian Federation' should be used in the United Nations in place of the name 'the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics'. The Russian Federation maintains full responsibility for all the rights and obligations of the USSR under the Charter of the United Nations, including the financial obligations. I request that you consider this letter as confirmation of the credentials to represent the Russian Federation in United Nations organs for all the persons currently holding the credentials of representatives of the USSR to the United Nations.Letter to the Secretary- General of the United Nations from the President of the Russian Federation The Secretary-General circulated the request among the UN membership. There being no objection, the Russian Federation took the USSR's place, with Boris Yeltsin personally taking the Russian Federation's seat at the January 31, 1992 Security Council meeting. Legality The legality of the succession has been questioned by international lawyer Yehuda Z. Blum, who opined that \\"with the demise of the Soviet Union itself, its membership in the UN should have automatically lapsed and Russia should have been admitted to membership in the same way as the other newly-independent republics (except for Belarus and Ukraine).\\" The elimination of Soviet (and subsequently Russian) membership on the UN Security Council would have created a constitutional crisis for the UN, which may be why the UN Secretary-General and members did not object. This situation could have been avoided had all the other nations but Russia seceded from the USSR, allowing the USSR to continue existing as a legal entity. A mere change of name by itself, from the USSR to the Russian Federation, would not have barred Russia from succeeding the USSR. Zaire changed its name to the Democratic Republic of the Congo, and retained its UN seat. A change in the USSR's system of government likewise would not have prevented the succession; Egypt and many other countries have made a transition from monarchy to republic without jeopardizing their positions in international organizations. However, Blum argues that a key difference between these situations is that the Soviet Union was terminated as a legal entity. The 11 former members nations that supported the transfer of the seat to Russia also declared that \\"with the formation of the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Union of the Soviet Socialist Republics ceases to exist.\\" The poorly defined rules on state succession make the legal situation murky. Professor Rein Mullerson concluded that the succession was legitimate, identifying three reasons: \\"Firstly, after the dissolution, Russia is [sic] still remains one of the largest States in the world geographically and demographically. Secondly, Soviet Russia after 1917 and especially the Soviet Union after 1922 were treated as continuing the same State as existed under the Russian Empire. These are objective factors to show that Russia is the continuation of the Soviet Union. The third reason which forms the subjective factor is the State‚Äôs behaviour and the recognition of the continuity by the third States.\\" The Vienna Convention on Succession of States in respect of Treaties was not a factor in the succession because it did not enter into force until 1996. Effect on the United Nations The transition led to increased debate on the relevance of the 1945 system of a Security Council dominated by five permanent members to the present world situation. Russians abroad note that Russia is \\"only half the size of the former Soviet economy\\"; the transition thus marked a significant change in the entity exercising this permanent seat. Mohamed Sid-Ahmed noted that \\"one of the five powers enjoying veto prerogatives in the Security Council has undergone a fundamental identity change. When the Soviet Union became Russia, its status changed from that of a superpower at the head of the communist camp to that of a society aspiring to become part of the capitalist world. Russia's permanent membership in the Security Council is no longer taken for granted. The global ideological struggle that had for so long dominated the international scene is no more, and the new realities have to be translated into a different set of global institutions.\\" The years following the breakup of the Soviet Union have seen a dramatic increase in the number of proposals for Security Council reform. In 2005, Kofi Annan's report In Larger Freedom proposed finalizing arrangement to add more permanent seats as soon as possible. Campaigns to abolish the veto have also gained support, although their adoption is unlikely in the near future, since it would require the consent of the Permanent Five. Global Policy Forum has several statements from the Permanent Five on file giving arguments for why the current system should be maintained. Russia, for instance, states the veto is necessary for \\"balanced and sustainable decisions\\".  Precedent for Scottish and Irish independence  Professor Andrew MacLeod of Kings College argueshttps://betterdebate.wordpress.com/2016/07/07/is-the-uk-about-to-lose- its-security-council-seat/ that the Russian example could be a precedent for hypothetical independence developments in the United Kingdom. Should Scotland, Northern Ireland, or both choose to leave the country, he argues, this would dissolve the Acts of Union and the Act of Settlement, and hence the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland would no longer exist. The question would then be how the reinstated Kingdom of England could claim to be the continuing state for UN and Security Council membership. However, this view would probably be inconstistent with specific legislation passed by the Parliament, and does not take into account the fact that the Treaty of Union of 1706 has been, since then, well incorporated into the British legal system,Union with Scotland Act 1706. legislation.uk.gov. Retrieved May 23, 2020. and hence a Scottish independence would not bring an abrogation of the treaty and a termination of the United Kingdom, but rather only a reduction in its size‚Äîas happened with the Irish independence in 1922.

He spent the rest of the summer in southern Alberta's Porcupine Hills, then being taken up for ranching. Aldous accepted a job offer from the Hudson's Bay Company (HBC) in 1882 and soon had seven survey parties working frantically to keep up with the demand for HBC farm lots. Later he served as the HBC Timber Agent and was Chief Clerk of the HBC Land Department from 1901 to 1907. In February 1885 he was sent to the Belly River (now known as the Oldman River) coal district where the North Western Coal and Navigation Company had opened mines. He inspected about of HBC lands in the vicinity as well as the land grant to be given to the Galt Company for building the Dunmore-Lethbridge narrow gauge railway. The Galt Company paid Aldous' expenses; part of its agreement with him that he would survey the new Lethbridge prairie level town site. He worked from sketches which Elliot Torrence Galt, general manager of the coal company, had prepared (likely with assistance from his father) in January 1885 or earlier. Aldous completed the Lethbridge survey in March and prepared detailed plans. Town lots were available for sale by May 9. The prairie level town began to take shape on August 1 and, by December 31, 1,200 people had settled in the new community. Montague Aldous died in Winnipeg on May 25, 1946.

The Liberal Youth of Sweden has a long tradition of international cooperation and is a full member of the International Federation of Liberal Youth (IFLRY) and the European Liberal Youth (LYMEC). They have published the magazine Liebling - Liberal Youth since 1961. History The Liberal Youth of Sweden traces its roots back to Verdandi, a radical student organisation founded in 1882 by Karl Staaff, the future prime minister and leader of the Liberal Coalition Party. In 1910 the Swedish Freeminded Youth League () was formed as the youth wing of the Freeminded National Association, Sweden's first grassroots liberal organisation, with Eric Festin as its first chairperson. The youth league was active during the First World War, but lost members afterwards. In 1923 the Freeminded National Association split over the prohibition of alcohol, and though the youth league tried to stay together it too split in 1927. The two liberal parties reunited in August 1934 as the People's Party. The youth league was reunited in the same year as the Youth League of the People's Party (, FPU) with Bertil Ohlin as its first chairperson. When it was founded it had 1000 members in about 100 local associations, but many new members soon joined. In the 1930s FPU campaigned on issues such as the abolition of school fees, and in the 1950s began to demand that a proportion of GDP should go to aid. FPU also campaigned for Sweden to join NATO and for the TV and radio monopolies to be abolished. In the 1960s FPU became prominent under the leadership of among others Per Ahlmark and Ola Ullsten and influenced its mother party in a radical direction. However, a time of internal battles followed in the early 1970s, culminating in the chairmanship election of 1971 where the incumbent Per Gahrton was defeated by Lars Leijonborg by one vote's margin. At the congress in 1991 the youth league changed its name to the Liberal Youth of Sweden after the People's Party had renamed itself the Liberal People's Party the previous year. LUF was (and is) noted for its support of Swedish membership of the European Union, which Sweden joined in 1995. After the mother party's success in the general election of 2002 the membership of LUF increased significantly. On February 28, 2016, the Stockholm branch of the party passed a motion calling for the legalization of incest and necrophilia. Organisation LUF has 21 districts, the three largest being Stockholm, V√§st and Sk√•ne. The highest decisionmaking authority is the congress, which is held every year. 99 congress delegates are elected by the districts, with one seat for each district and the remainder allocated in proportion to their number of members. Once every two years the congress discusses and amends the Liberal Youth's policy programme. The most recent such congress was held in 2019 in V√§ster√•s.

FEI offers values-based leadership development opportunities through an \\"interagency residential learning experience\\" which emphasizes \\"personal growth as well as professional growth.\\"Novotny, T.W. What's So Special? An Introduction. The Public Manager Vol.28 No.1 Spring 1999. Pg 4. Programs are designed specifically for public sector senior management. History The Federal Executive Institute was founded in 1968 \\"to endow the career leadership levels of the Federal government with the capacity and motivation to bring proactive change to a huge enterprise.\\"Sherwood, Frank et al. The Early Years of the Federal Executive Institute (Bloomington, IN: iUniverse, 2010) 3. Background In the 1950s, the federal civilian workforce was larger than it had ever been. Millions of workers had been hired to manage the programs of the New Deal in the 1930s, and more still were brought into federal service to manage the American mobilization during World War II. However, the United States had not implemented any kind of education programs to prepare federal executives to manage this expanded workforce. As a result, the Society for Personnel Administration published a proposal for a \\"federal staff college\\" in 1953.Sherwood, 8. Early ideas for senior executive education were based on military models, specifically the military staff colleges which were used to prepare officers for assignments in the upper ranks, specifically as admirals and generals. The United States military had a long experience of organizing and training millions of men and it was believed by many that a similar model of continuing education should be applied to civil servants, to prepare them for more senior assignments.Proposal for a Federal Staff College The first step towards the creation of such a federal staff college was taken in 1958 when Congress passed the Government Employees Training Act. The act established several precedents that became central to the formation of the Federal Executive Institute. First and foremost, it cleared the way for the establishment of an executive training center funded by its own revenues, rather than by congressional allocations. This allowed FEI freedom of maneuver and sheltered it from political storms. Second, the act gave agency directors the authority to determine how much money they would spend on executive education and where they would send their executives to be trained. This encouraged FEI to remain tied to the senior executives it was founded to serve because they constantly had to market themselves to federal agencies. Finally, the act paved the way for interagency training. Interagency interaction would become one of the hallmarks of FEI, where senior executives from various backgrounds and agencies would live and learn with each other for weeks at a time. However, it would still be approximately 10 years before FEI was founded. In the meantime, federal executives furthered their education primarily through the Brookings Institution. Additionally, the Civil Service Commission (CSC) founded two Executive Seminar Centers. The first was founded at King's Point, Long Island in 1963 and the second at Berkeley, California in 1966. Even with these centers, Chairman Macy wanted more to be done. He wanted to create an institute for those civil servants who had reached the pinnacle of their careers, the \\"supergrades.\\" These people could not be motivated by further promotion and would only attend the institute in order to improve their own work and the work done by their organizations. Therefore, in August 1966Sherwood, 9-10. the CSC completed a proposal for a center for advanced executive study to be called the Federal Executive Institute.Sherwood, 7. Creating the Federal Executive Institute Following President Johnson's speech, John Macy designated James Beck to coordinate the creation of the Federal Executive Institute. Beck visited potential sites for FEI including Colonial Williamsburg, Fredericksburg, Virginia, the Research Triangle Park in North Carolina, the Walter P. Chrysler Estate, and Charlottesville, Virginia. The site needed to be near a university which the faculty could partner with, a location where courses could be held and executives housed, and be within driving distance of Washington D.C.Sherwood, 38-40. In addition to a location, the FEI needed a director. Chairman Macy was able to convince Frank Sherwood, who was teaching at the University of Southern California, to come to Charlottesville as the first director of the Federal Executive Institute. Macy chose Sherwood to be the FEI's first director because he wanted someone \\"with academic credentials who understands something about adult learning and adult education, who had a substance of understanding about problems of the Federal executive gained through academic research and study, someone with academic status and thus able to attract staff and deal with the University of Virginia.\\"Anderson, Peggy. \\"Federal Executive Institute: Special School for the Super Grades.\\" Government Executive, May 1969:58-61. He wanted someone who could turn his vision of a university model within the federal government into a reality. Macy and Sherwood worked exceptionally together and the two soon formed a partnership that shaped the foundational years of FEI.Sherwood, 41. Both agreed that FEI should have an Advisory Board. The FEI Advisory Board provided FEI with supporters placed throughout the government who knew about FEI's mission and the unusual way it operated.Sherwood, 43. When the Civil Service Commission (CSC) began leasing the Thomas Jefferson Inn, the facilities were in a state of disrepair. Though the exterior had been maintained, leaking pipes and other problems created many maintenance projects that had to be completed in a very short period of time. To help accomplish this, most of the hotel staff was kept on and became the initial FEI staff. Along with other workers, they were able to complete the most necessary repairs and prepare the facility for the first class in October 1968. The First Session at FEI The first session at FEI began on October 13, 1968. Fifty-three executives were in attendance. All were from within the federal government and all but two were supergrades. The session lasted eight weeks, a period intended to take the executives away from the office long enough to allow them to \\"look seriously at themselves and their careers and to consider what changes they needed to make for the future.\\" The curriculum was heavily based on John Gardener's book Self-Renewal and emphasized the ability to adapt and change over technical knowledge.Donald Nuechterlein. \\"FEI at Twenty: a Personal Retrospect.\\" Bureaucrat. (Washington D.C.: National Capital Area Chapter of the American Society for Public Administration, Spring 1988) 21. The emphasis on change and adaptability was a product of the times. The initial FEI faculty had witnessed many changes in American society in the last decade. As a result, they believed that any attempt to prepare executives for the future was too big a gamble, since it was impossible to accurately predict what the future held. Instead, they wanted to prepare America's \\"civilian generals\\" for the future by teaching them how to adapt with change and harness it to accomplish their agency's primary mission.Sherwood, 58. To ensure that FEI remained innovative, Macy and Sherwood only contracted faculty for short periods, ensuring that fresh personnel and ideas were always being brought to the Institute.Sherwood, 58. Although self-development was an important part of the original FEI curriculum, Macy believed it should be one of several intellectual and learning goals that executives pursued while at FEI.Sherwood, 13. Macy and Sherwood intentionally created a learning environment that was learner focused. Individuals were allowed to tailor their experience to their needs and chose which courses they would take to supplement the main programs.Hall, T.B. Rocky Top, Rocky Road, Solid Rock: Thirty Years of Intellectual History at the Federal Executive Institute. Diss. Virginia Tech, 1998. Falls Church, VA: 41. One of the major problems Macy identified in federal civil service was that most executives ranked GS-13 or higher had no experience outside their own agencies.Sherwood, 10. It bothered John Macy that the majority of federal executives spent most of their career in one department or even in one bureau. He wanted talented people to gain experience outside what they already knew. So he designed FEI to encourage executives from different agencies to get to know each other and what each person's agency did, furthering an understanding of the functions of government across the workforce.Sherwood, 33. The founders of FEI intentionally created a casual atmosphere to encourage the executives to mingle with each other and learn more about different government agencies. Executives were given nametags with names and agencies, not positions or rank, to encourage a feeling of equality rather than one of hierarchy among the executives.Nuechterlein, 21. FEI within the Civil Service Commission When it was founded, FEI was placed outside the mainstream CSC bureaucracy. The FEI Director reported directly to the CSC Chairman, an unusual relationship for such a small institution. Macy created this relationship so that FEI would be as independent as possible while remaining part of the government. He and his successor, Robert Hampton, ensured that this relationship was preserved. However, when Alan Campbell became Chairman of the Commission and the CSC began transitioning into the Office of Personnel Management (OPM), FEI became part of OPM's larger training program, the Center for Leadership Development.Sherwood, 28.

FEI operates five programs of leadership development: Leadership for a Democratic Society (LDS), the FEI SES Leading EDGE Portfolio, Custom Executive Programs (CEP), Open Enrollment Courses (OEP), and the Center for Global Leadership (CGL). Programs, workshops, and courses are designed and administered by a team of federally employed faculty and staff. In addition, all programs are supported by adjunct faculty representing a wide spectrum of expertise. Leadership for a Democratic Society The four-week \\"Leadership for a Democratic Society\\" (LDS) program improves the leadership skills of senior career federal government executives to enhance their individual performance and the performance of government agencies. The program focuses on four themes: personal leadership, transforming organizations, policy in a Constitutional system, and the global context for executive action. LDS offers federal executives a residential learning experience. Traditional sessions last four weeks while applied learning sessions consist of a two week period at FEI, three months back at the executives' home agency, and another two weeks at FEI. This program was designed to solve the issue that many interested executives are unable to take four weeks away from work.Hall, 78. The maximum enrollment is approximately seventy executives per session, but FEI will often see up to 750 executives complete the LDS program per year. In addition to an intense curriculum based on Constitutional values, LDS offers a personal approach to leadership development. By incorporating 360-degree assessments, inventories of strengths and areas for improvement, and constant feedback from peers and facilitators, participants are led to a larger picture of self- awareness. Executives learn in Leadership Development Teams (LDTs) which are smaller discussion and peer consultation groups that include guidance from a professional facilitator. In addition, interagency networking is encouraged and fostered throughout the program.Hall, 111. The Leadership for a Democratic Society program also includes a wellness track. All participants complete a comprehensive health risk appraisal to include blood lipid profile and fitness assessment and nutritional counseling. Executives are provided with the opportunity to take fitness classes in the mornings before breakfast and during the midday break as well as during the open hours when the fitness facility is available for individual exercise. In addition, smaller breakout sessions and seminar focusing on specific health and wellness topics are offered during the program. FEI offers on-campus gym facilities as well as a volleyball court and a swimming pool. Custom Executive Programs  In addition to LDS, elements of FEI focus on consulting and specific organizational needs within federal agencies. FEI offers open enrollment courses throughout the year in areas such as: collaborating across organizational boundaries, emotional competence, and strategic leadership. FEI also offers custom designed programs which can be constructed to respond to an organization's specific needs. FEI has worked with such agencies as: USAID, NOAA, NAVAIR, FAA, Department of Defense, Internal Revenue Service as well as the Army Senior Leader Development Program, the Defense Senior Leadership Development Program (DSLDP) and the President's Council on Integrity and Efficiency in the Government. Open Enrollment Programs  FEI also offers more than two dozen open enrollment programs to federal executives at the GS15 and Senior Executive Service (SES) level. These multi-day courses span a wide range of topics relevant to executive leaders including those which focus on individual skill development as well as organizational enhancement. Center for Global Leadership  FEI is a founding member of the Global Leadership Consortium with the Graduate School, USDA, and the National Academy of Public Administration to support federal agencies in developing leaders who can excel in the global environment. A variety of programs are offered that enhance executives ability to think and relate globally in their leadership approach. Related programs FEI is part of the United States Office of Personnel Management (OPM) and falls under OPM's HR Solutions organization which functions as OPM's services and consulting division for all U.S. Federal agencies. In addition to FEI, HR Solutions has educational facilities in Washington, DC (EMDC) and Denver, Colorado (WMDC). FEI also provides Briefing Programs for Senior Executive Service (SES) members and Schedule C (Administration) appointees.

He was born with the name Appius Claudius Pulcher, into the patrician family of the Claudii Pulchri but adopted by a Livii Drusi as a small child. His daughter Livia Drusilla became the wife of the first Roman Emperor Augustus, and he was a direct ancestor of the Julio-Claudian emperors Tiberius, Caligula, Claudius and Nero. Biography=Background As a Pulchri, Claudianus was a direct descendant of the consul and censor Appius Claudius Caecus trought his son Publius Claudius Pulcher. Claudianus descended via the first Appius Claudius Pulcher, who was consul in 212 BC and Publius Claudius Pulcher's son or grandson. Bartolomeo Borghesi has suggests that his biological father could have been either Appius Claudius Pulcher (military tribune in the year 87 BC) or the Gaius Claudius Pulcher who was legate or preator in 73 BC, both of the men were sons of Gaius Claudius Pulcher who was consul in 130 BC. Appius Claudius Pulcher, consul of 79 BC; and Gaius Claudius Pulcher, the consul of 92 BC, have been postulated by Ronald Syme. Susan Treggiari has speculated that his mother might have been a sister of Marcus Livius Drusus the tribune, this explaining his adoption by Drusus, since Drusus had at least two other nephews whom he chose Claudianus over. Adopted fathers and sons were often closely relatedOlli Salomies, Adoptive and Polyonymous Nomenclature in the Roman Empire (Helsinki: Societas Scientiarum Fennica, 1992), p. 35 and adoption of a sororal nephew was esspecialy common in Rome. Early life Little is known about the circumstances leading to Claudianus's adoption by Marcus Livius Drusus. He was unusually young at the time of adoption (likely a small child, if not an infant), as most other adoption in ancient Rome happened with the adoptee as adults. In accordance with convention, his name was changed from Appius Claudius Pulcher to Marcus Livius Drusus Claudianus, in honour of his adoptive father. Since the death of his adopted father's sister Livia Drusa, he was likely raised together with her children Servilia Major, Gnaeus Servilius Caepio, Servilia Minor, Porcia and Cato in Drusus's household. Drusus was assassinated in 91 BCDate: E. Gabba, 'Rome and Italy: The Social War', in CAH IX (1994), p. 113 and Claudianus presumably inherited all his immense wealth. Career Claudianus was praetor of Rome in 50 BC and presided over a court case brought under the Lex Scantinia. Caelius, writing to Cicero, seems to find the situation ironic.T. Corey Brennan, The Praetorship in the Roman Republic (Oxford University Press, 2000), vol. 2, p. 459. In 45 BC, Cicero had purchased gardens owned by Claudianus in Rome. Claudianus was a supporter of the Roman Republic and was among those who opposed the rule and dictatorship of Julius Caesar, assassinated in 44 BC by Brutus and Cassius. In 42 BC, Claudianus arranged for his daughter Livia Drusilla to marry his kinsman Tiberius Claudius Nero, who became the parents of future Roman Emperor Tiberius and the general Nero Claudius Drusus. Through this second grandson, Claudianus was a direct ancestor to the Roman Emperors Caligula, Claudius, and Nero. Death Claudianus became a supporter of Brutus and Cassius and joined them in the war against Octavian and Mark Antony. The decision would have serious consequences for him and for Livia's family. He fought alongside Brutus and Cassius at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC. When Brutus and Cassius were defeated, they committed suicide. Claudianus killed himself in his tent to avoid being captured alive by the victors. Family Claudianus married a woman of plebeian status called Alfidia. They had at least one child: a daughter Livia Drusilla (58 BC‚Äì29). The usage of the nickname \\"Drusilla\\" might imply that she had an older sister. Claudianus relatively advanced age at the time of his marriage to Alfidia could indicate that he had been married before. It is also probable that he had a biological son named Gaius Livius Drusus who had two daughters named Livia Pulchra and Livia Livilla. This son may have died in battle after the assassination of Julius Caesar, or had been proscribed and killed by the Second Triumvirate. He also adopted as his son Marcus Livius Drusus Libo.Syme, R., Augustan Aristocracy (1989), p. 257Weinrib, E.J., 'The Family Connections of M. Livius Drusus Libo' This was likely a testamentary adoption. Adoptions of that sort was mostly carried out because a man lacked legitimate sons who could carry on their name and estate, (perhaps implying that if Claudianus had ever had a son, he was likely dead before his father wrote his will). Legacy The poet Sextus Propertius [11.1.27], described the Battle of Philippi as \\"civilia busta\\" or \\"sepulchre of citizens\\". The 1st-century senator and historian Aulus Cremutius Cordus, glorified Brutus and Cassius in his history and described those who fought alongside Caesar‚Äôs assassins as the \\"last of the Romans\\". When his grandson the future Roman emperor Tiberius celebrated his coming of age, Tiberius staged two gladiatorial contests. One was held at the Forum in memory of his father and the other held at the amphitheatre in memory of his grandfather Drusus Claudianus.Suetonius, The Twelve Caesars, Tiberius, 7 Emperor Claudius dedicated an inscription to honor his ancestor on the Greek island of Samos. This surviving inscription in Greek, hails Claudianus as the \\"origin of many great and good works for the world\\" or \\"megiston agathon aition‚Ä¶en toi kosmoi\\". Claudius also honoured Claudianus with statues in Rome.

It was responsible for research, and some co-ordination, on issues of military strategy. Typically, a temporary sub-committee would be set up to investigate and report at length on a specific topic. Many such sub-committees were engendered over the decades, on topics such as foreign espionage (a committee report in 1909 led to the founding of MI5 and MI6), food rationing, and aerial defence. It is possible to argue that the Committee of Imperial Defence was an important step in the development of national security coordination in the UK, and to see the current National Security Council as one of its descendants. History The committee was established in 1904 by Arthur Balfour, then British Prime Minister, following the recommendations of the Elgin Committee, chaired by Lord Elgin. It was intended as an advisory committee for the Prime Minister, one that would be small and flexible; it replaced the Cabinet's 'weak and informal' Defence Committee (set up in 1902), which had usually only met during periods of crisis. The original concept was to create a strategic vision defining the future roles of the two military services, the Royal Navy and the British Army, after the military reductions in the wake of the Boer War. However, no arrangements were made for it to formally pass on its conclusions to those with the ability to translate them into actions. This lack soon became obvious enough that a Secretariat was appointed, under Sir George Clarke. However, far from simply acting as a communicator, Clarke expected actually to make policy and see it implemented. With the fall of the Balfour Government in 1906, and with the military services determined to control their own futures, Clarke's plans fell through, and with no support from the incoming Prime Minister, he resigned in 1907. A small Secretariat became permanent and provided communication between members outside of Committee meetings, and with other civil servants. Under the guidance of Maurice Hankey, the Committee slowly gained in importance. Hankey was appointed Naval Assistant Secretary to the Committee in 1908, and became Secretary to the Committee in 1912; he would hold that position for the next twenty-six years. By 1914, the Committee had begun to act as a defence planning agency for the whole British Empire, consequently providing advice to the Dominions on occasion. It continued to perform such a role into the 1920s. It was effectively a peacetime defence planning system, one which only provided advice; formal authority remained with Ministers and service chiefs, which helped ensure the Committee's acceptability to the existing bureaucracy.

Though there were four pillars surrounding the Linga, now there is only one pillar intact. Some believe the pillars to be symbols of yuga or time, namely, Satya, Treta, Dvapara and the Kali Yuga The Satya Yuga (), Sat Yuga or Krita Yuga (), in Hinduism, is the first of the four Yugas, the \\"Yuga (Age or Era) of Truth\\", when humanity is governed by gods, and every manifestation or work is close to the purest ideal and humanity will allow intrinsic goodness to rule supreme. It is sometimes referred to as the \\"Golden Age\\". The Satya Yuga lasts 1,728,000 years or 4800 divine years. The god Dharma (depicted in the form of a bull), which symbolises morality, stood on all four legs during this period. Later on in the Treta Yuga, it would become three, followed by two in the Dvapara Yuga. Currently, in the immoral age of Kali, it stands on one leg.  The cycle  The Yugas are said to succeed each other almost endlessly. After the perfect Satya Yuga, a decline marks the Treta Yuga. Further decline brings about the Dwapara Yuga, and after it comes the final and dark Kali Yuga, a time of wickedness, when people kill each other. At the end of the cycle Kalki is said to take birth and reestablish righteousness, thus beginning a new Satya Yuga or yuga of truth.  The Satya Yuga according to some holy texts As described in the Mahabharata, a Hindu epic: Brief Explanation Amongst the four eras, the Satya Yuga is the first and the most significant one. Knowledge, meditation, and penance hold special importance in this era. All the pillars of Dharma are present in totality. During Satya Yuga, all people engage only in good, sublime deeds. Ashrams become devoid of wickedness and deceit. Natyam (such as Bharatanatyam), according to Natya Shastra, did not exist in the Satya Yuga \\"because it was the time when all people were happy\\". This Yuga extends up to 1,728,000 years. Lord Vishnu incarnated in four forms i.e. Matsya,Kurma, Varaha and Narsimha in this era.The only text which was considered credible and was followed was Manu‚Äôs Dharma Shastra. The average human lifespan in Satya Yuga began with 100,000 years and gradually decreased to 10,000 years. The Vaishya (traders) of this era shall engage in trade and business very justly and honestly. Brahmins shall be engaged continually in religious sacrifices, study, teaching, charity etc. The Kshatriya (warriors) shall be inclined towards the exhibition of valiance and might. The Shudras shall sincerely serve the Brahmins, Kshatriyas and Vaishyas. This form of religion shall remain intact and absolute in the Satya Yuga. One shall witness the total establishment of Sanatan Dharma (eternal religion). All the deities, demons, Gandharvas, and Yaksha would give up their hatred and differences. The Rig, Sama and Yajurveda were not separate and demarcated. This era was devoid of agricultural activities or any other type of activity. Just by mere contemplation one would beget desired results. People in this era would never fall ill. No one would try to point out faults or demerits in anyone‚Äôs personality. The personality was not plagued by demerits like ego, sorrow, violent thought (aggression), jealousy, hatred, backbiting, fear, anger and lethargy. At that time, the colour of the Supreme cosmic soul that was situated in the heart of one and all and the saviour of all the sages was white (light). All the people that are Brahmins, Kshatriyas, Vaishyas and Shudras were embellished with all the good qualities. People would practice austerities and penance to attain Brahman. All would be inclined towards the supreme knowledge and all actions performed would be in the intention of attaining celestial bliss. In this way all these divine people would be bestowed with sublime faith and piousness. Albeit, people were segregated on the basis of the Varnashram method, they would all response their faith in the Vedas and the Sanatan Dharma because these people were devoid of selfishness, and they would effortlessly attain sublimity or union with God, which is a salient feature of Satya Yuga. Very valiant, mighty, intelligent and people gifted with all good qualities would be born in this era. They would surprisingly give birth to thousands of children. Great sages embellished with divinity would be born in this era. End of Kali Yuga and starting of Satya Yuga The tenth avatar of the Lord Vishnu in the current Mahayuga is foretold to appear at the end of Kali Yuga, the current epoch. The Purana scriptures foretell that Kalki will be atop a white horse with a drawn blazing sword. He is the harbinger of the end time in Hindu eschatology, after which he will usher in Satya Yuga. Astrology Kalki can only be the one whose tithi (birthday) falls on Dwadashi of shukla pakshya. This amounts to just 12 days per any given year; furthermore, as it can only be the day of the Lord Sri Maha Vishnu (Chaitra Dwadashi), this amounts to just one day each year or 100 days in the last century. Indian astrologers have analysed Puranas extensively to try to foretell the time of Kalki's birth. The signs described in the Kalki Purana are as follows: # The moon will be in Dhanishtha nakshatra, Aquarius, suggesting he will be wealthy, acclaimed and swift in action and thought. # The sun will be in Swati, the nakshatra of the sword. # Jupiter will be in Purva Ashadha nakshatra (Sagittarius). # The Ascendant Lord will be in Purva Ashadha nakshatra, suggesting invincibility and early victory. # Saturn will be exalted in Libra, predicting a balance between justice and the sword. # Ketu, a half snake (upper part of body) and half human (lower part of body) demon in navagraha, will be exalted in Scorpio, suggesting he will descend atop a great white steed. Kalki with his white horse Devadatta The Puranas describe the date as twenty-one fortnights from the birth of Krishna, which itself falls on Janmashtami in August. This would put his descent at Vaishakha, between April and May. At this time, the father of Kalki is foretold to be overwhelmed by the incarnation of Godhead that he sees as his son. This places Kalki under the sun sign of Aries or Taurus. The Bhavishya Purana foretells: There have been a range of dates predicted, purportedly from different methods of calculation. Sri Potuluri Virabrahmendra Swami, for example, wrote 400 years ago in his Divya Maha Kalagnanam,http://www.kalagnanam.in/ or 'Divine Knowledge of the Time,' that Kalki would arrive when the moon, sun, Venus and Jupiter entered the same sign. This is not a rare occurrence and last happened in early 2012, passing without event. The time of Kalki's arrival has not been consistently asserted by astrologers.

History The National Union of Workers of Australia was formed by a progressive amalgamation of unions from 1989 onwards in a time when all Australian unions were merging, with varying degrees of success. These unions merged into the one larger union to pool their expertise and resources, so they could provide members with a larger range of quality services. The six unions which form the NUW were established in the early part of last century and have been at the forefront of workers' achievements for nearly 100 years: * Federated Storemen and Packers Union (Est. 1912) * Federated Rubber and Allied Workers Union (Est. 1908) * Federated Cold Storage and Meat Preserving Employees' Union (Est. 1908) * Federated Millers and Manufacturing Grocers Union (Est. 1909) * Commonwealth Foremen's Association (Est. 1912) * United Sales Representatives and Commercial Travellers Guild (Est. 1888) In 2018 it was announced the NUW was in the process of merging with another union, United Voice. In June 2019, the Fair Work Commission approved a vote on the proposed merger between the two unions which will be held in August. On 30 August 2019 the Australian Electoral Commission declared the result of the vote, with just over 95% of members supporting the amalgamation. The name of the new union was the United Workers Union. As a result of the amalgamation, the NUW will be deregistered as part of the merger and its members folded into the larger United Voice. On 11 November 2019, the new United Workers Union was formed. Coverage Howard's IR reforms in a 2005 rally in Sydney The National Union of Workers covered workers in the following industries: * Warehousing and distribution * Food manufacturing * Rubber, plastic and cable-making * Dairy * Cold storage * Poultry, fish and game processing * Skin and hide * Wool * Oil * Pet food * Pharmaceutical manufacturing * Milling * Market research * Merchandising and sales representatives Politics The NUW was one of the most powerful unions in the Australian Labor Party and its national Labor Right faction.http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/new- victorian-superfaction-boosts-bill-shortens-influence-on-labor-party- machine-20150421-1mpqte It was generally a member along with other right-wing unions of the various state Labor Right factions that make up the national Labor Right faction.https://agitateeducateopine.wordpress.com/2014/09/02/what- is-the-factional-breakdown-at-labor-conferences/ However it made up its own Labor Right faction in Victoria called Labor Action and in Queensland called Labor Unity (also known as the Old Guard).http://www.smh.com.au/federal- politics/political-news/new-victorian-superfaction-boosts-bill-shortens- influence-on-labor-party- machine-20150421-1mpqtehttps://agitateeducateopine.wordpress.com/2013/03/05/understanding- the-labor-factions/ The NUW has also funded and supported the left-wing party, the Victorian Socialists.

The first Autocoders appear to have been the earliest assemblers to provide a macro facility.Solomon 1993, p. 8. Terminology Both autocoder, and the unrelated autocode, a term of the same era used in the UK for languages of a higher level, derive from the phrase automatic coding. This referred generally to programs which eased the burden of producing the numeric machine language codes of programs.Hopper 1955. \\"Autocoding\\" is seen occasionally, and can refer to any kind of programming system. In some circles \\"autocoder\\" could be used generically to refer to what is now called a macro- assembler.For an example see Allen 1981, p. 540. History The first Autocoders were released in 1955 for the IBM 702, and in 1956 for the almost compatible IBM 705. They were designed by Roy Goldfinger who earlier had worked on New York University's (NYU) NYAP assembler.Goldfinger 1956.The Encyclopedia of Computer Languages These machines were variable word length commercial machines, as were many of the computers for which an Autocoder was released. Besides the 702 and 705, there eventually also were Autocoders for the IBM 1410 and 7010, IBM 7030 (Stretch), 7070/7072/7074, IBM 7080, and the IBM 1400 series.7010: Weik 1964, p. 0160; 7030:, ; 7070: , ; 7080: ; 1400 series: , . Autocoder as implemented on the IBM 1401 Symbolic Programming System (SPS), was the assembler offered when IBM originally announced 1401 as a punched-card-only computer. SPS had different mnemonics and a different fixed input format from Autocoder. It lacked Autocoder's features and was generally used later only on machines that lacked tape drives, that is, punched-card only. Autocoder coding sheet 1401 Autocoder is the most well known Autocoder, undoubtedly due in part to the general success of that series of machines. Autocoder was the primary language of this computer, and its macro capabilities facilitated use of the Input/Output Control System which eased the programming burden. Solomon 1993, p. 8. Autocoder also had the ability to process code written for SPS. The 1401 was available in six memory configurations, with 1400, 2000, 4000, 8000, 12000, or 16000 six-bit characters. The 8000-character model was the minimum needed to run Autocoder. A loadable object file, on punched cards or magnetic tape, could be produced on an 8000-character model which could then be run on a 4000-character machine. Influence The popularity of Autocoder inspired other assemblers. ‚Äò‚ÄôEasycoder‚Äô‚Äô for the Honeywell 200, a computer similar to the 1401, resembled Autocoder. Other manufacturers sometimes built competing products, such as NCR's \\"National's Electronic Autocoder Technique\\" (NEAT).Weik 1964, p. 0202. The Pennsylvania State University developed a \\"Dual Autocoder Fortran Translator\\" (DAFT) compiler for the IBM 7074 in the 1960s which made it extremely easy to write (within a single program) lines of autocoder instructions freely interspersed with lines of Fortran code. This allowed symbolic machine instruction level coding within a higher level Fortran program, which was especially useful for optimizing the speed of inner loops, or for making use of the IBM 7074's unusual decimal word architecture. Bell Laboratories developed a program called \\"Peripheral Equipment Symbolic Translator\\" (PEST), which was a 1401 cross-assembler that ran on the 709/709x and accepted a subset of 1401 Autocoder. A copy of the source programs for SPS-1, SPS-2 and Autocoder was donated to the Charles Babbage Institute, University of Minnesota in 1985, by Gary Mokotoff, author of SPS and coauthor of Autocoder.

Prospect New Town is a New Urbanist housing development located on the southern edge of the city of Longmont in Boulder County, Colorado, in the United States. The first full-scale new urbanist new development in Colorado, it was developed starting in the mid-1990s by Kiki Wallace and designed by the firm of Duany Plater Zyberk & Company, who also designed the new urbanist communities of Seaside, Florida, and Kentlands in Gaithersburg, Maryland. As of 2009, the project is in its sixth phase of development. It is intended to have a population of approximately 2,000 people in 585 units on 340 lots. Description Traditional housing styles along a residential street in Prospect New Town The development is being built on the site of an tree farm formerly owned by Wallace's family. It sits along the west side of U.S. Highway 287 just south of Pike Road. The development incorporates a broad mix of traditional and modern designs, mixed to create an eclectic feel. Although planned by DPZ, the individual units are designed by a variety of architects, who are encouraged to experiment with styles. It includes a heterogeneous mix of businesses, detached homes, row houses, live/work lofts, and apartments. The original farmhouse and other structures have been integrated into the development, in part to retain continuity with the former use of the property. Some of the new structures resemble traditional housing styles from early in the 20th century, while others are very eclectic and ultramodern. A residential area showing mixed architectural styles of detached homes in Prospect New Town Keeping to new urbanist principles espoused by Andres Duany and Elizabeth Plater-Zyberk (the partners of DPZ) and others, the plan of the community forgoes traditional suburban features such as large front lawns, uniform featureless fronts dominated by large garage doors, and segregation of housing from businesses. Instead, the development is designed with small yards and higher density, to create a traditional neighborhood look and feel. It is also designed to be pedestrian friendly, not only in the amenities such as sidewalks, but in promoting the desirability of walking short distances within the complex. Houses and lots in the project are typically smaller than in U.S. suburban developments. The typical house in the project has an area 5,100 square feet (470 m¬≤) of living space on a 7,000 square foot (650 m¬≤) lot. Prices for houses in the project initially ranged from 150,000-500,000 USD, but have trended quickly upward because of the high demand and the overall growth of real estate prices in the area. The development includes a town center interwoven into the center of the residential area, with businesses ranging from restaurants to professional offices. The streets are oriented to maximize the view of the mountains, and a traditional town center that would be no more than five minutes on foot from any place in the neighborhood. It would include not only houses but also stores and offices that themselves would have living spaces upstairs, in the manner of many older traditional two-story commercial properties. Due to the bright colors and eclectic architecture of the buildings, many area residents refer to Prospect as \\"Toon Town\\". History Courtyard of a commercial structure along Tenacity Drive in Prospect New Town. The building shown here is less than 100 meters from the streets with detached homes, allowing quick commutes and easy access for residents. Wallace, who reportedly disliked suburbia, had previously bought the tree farm from his family and had wondered how to develop it in a tasteful way when he read an article in the Wall Street Journal about Duany and the New Urbanist movement. Wallace, together with Duany and Longmont developer Dale Bruns, began planning the unique development in the middle 1990s. The development was to serve as a test case for traditional neighborhoods in the planning stages along the Colorado Front Range. The parcel of land offered a full view of the nearby mountains, including Longs Peak. The development, at first called the \\"Wallace Addition\\" and the \\"Burlington Village\\", was to be financed at 37 million dollars. The partners also hired the Rocky Mountain Institute, based in Snowmass, Colorado, as consultants for the use of ecologically-friendly building materials and planning. The design calls for the eventual construction of nine small parks integrated throughout the houses and businesses. Some of the units will have apartments above garages, a traditional feature that will allow renters to live in the neighborhood and will allow homeowners to reduce mortgage payments. Other traditional features included in the project are the use of rear lanes, a feature that was once prevalent in the grid plans of most U.S. towns but which has been banished from suburbia. Duany has long espoused the use of rear lanes as leading to a better integration of automobile and foot traffic in a neighborhood. As was the case with many New Urbanist projects in the United States, the proposal violated numerous local zoning ordinances and met with much initial resistance from local planning authorities and other agencies. In particular, the project's density did not have the required open space; the local fire and police departments objected to the narrowness of streets; and the Colorado Department of Transportation objected that the project had too many curb cuts. Wallace, Bruns, and Duany struggled throughout 1994 to convince the local and state authorities to allow the project. The struggle is reflected in Wallace's choice of street names in the project: the main thoroughfare off U.S. 287 is called \\"Tenacity Drive.\\" The struggle of the three men paid off, however, and in the following year, many initial doubters came to embrace the project. In October 1995 the Longmont Planning Board granted the appropriate variances and unanimously approved the project, on the grounds that \\"this is what people want.\\" The project was strongly backed by Longmont mayor Leona Stoecker. Coffeeshop and wine store along Tenacity Drive, just off U.S. Highway 287, in Prospect New Town The first building phase was to include 65 lots. By the time of the approval of the planning board in 1995, Wallace had already pre-sold 35 of the lots. The initial success and enthusiasm prompted interest from other such developers. A developer from Colorado Springs began planning a similar development nearby. The nearby city of Broomfield likewise contacted California planner Peter Calthorpe, who espouses many New Urbanist ideas, to begin designing a master plan for their community. In 1996 the development won the Governor's Smart Growth Award. The development has been the subject of numerous articles in the local and national press in recent years.

The mission of the magazine was to encourage and support the practice of shamanism from an experiential perspective of shamans and other practitioners. In order to consolidate contemporary and ancient shamanic methodologies, Shaman's Drum regularly examined traditional, non-traditional and contemporary forms of shamanism and methodology: ranging from Siberian ecstatic seances and Tibetan trance oracles to Amazonian ayahuasca rituals and Native American healing ceremonies. The journal took the view that shamanism is a universal human phenomenon, or complex of phenomena, that ultimately transcends culture or tradition.

He opposed the dictatorship of Fulgencio Batista from its inception in 1952 and fought alongside Fidel Castro, Raul Castro, Che Guevara, Camilo Cienfuegos and other members of the 26th of July Movement to overthrow it. Following the success of the Cuban Revolution that brought Fidel Castro to power, he criticized the regime's shift in favor of Marxist principles and ties to the Communist Party of Cuba (PCC). Convicted of treason and sedition by the revolutionary government, he spent 20 years in prison (1959‚Äì1979) before being released in 1979. He then divided his time between Miami, Florida, and Costa Rica while continuing to protest the policies of the Cuban government. Early life Matos was born in Yara, in Oriente Province. He became a school teacher in Manzanillo, while also owning a small rice plantation. He joined the Cuban nationalist party, Partido Ortodoxo. Revolutionary activity Camilo Cienfuegos, Fidel Castro, R. Huber Matos, entering Havana on 8 January 1959 Following Batista's coup of 10 March 1952, Matos became involved with the resistance movement. He moved to Costa Rica for several years, maintaining contact with the M-26-7 revolutionaries stationed in Sierra Maestra hills and helping them with logistical and organizational support. He developed contacts with President Jos√© Figueres of Costa Rica who supported Cuban rebel aims and helped Matos obtain weapons and supplies. On 31 March 1958, Matos flew a five-ton air cargo with ammunition and weapons to Castro's rebels. On 8 August 1958 Castro awarded Matos the rank of combat commander and put him in command of the rebel army's ninth column, the Antonio Guiteras group. Matos led his column during the final assault on Santiago de Cuba that brought the revolutionary movements military operations to their close. In January 1959, he rode into Havana atop a tank in a victory parade alongside Castro and other revolutionaries. On 11 January 1959, Matos was appointed Commander of the Army in the province of Camag√ºey. Split with Castro In July 1959, Matos denounced the direction the revolution was taking by giving openly anti-communist speeches in Camag√ºey. This launched a months-long dispute between him and Castro, then Prime Minister of Cuba, When Castro replaced President Manuel Urrutia with the more radical Osvaldo Dortic√≥s Torrado, Matos tendered his resignation in a letter to Castro. On 26 July, Castro and Matos met at the Hilton Hotel in Havana, where, according to Matos, Castro told him: \\"Your resignation is not acceptable at this point. We still have too much work to do. I admit that Ra√∫l [Castro] and Che [Guevara] are flirting with Marxism ... but you have the situation under control ... Forget about resigning ... But if in a while you believe the situation is not changing, you have the right to resign.\\" In September 1959, Matos wrote: \\"Communist influence in the government has continued to grow. I have to leave power as soon as possible. I have to alert the Cuban people as to what is happening.\\" On 19 October, he sent a second letter of resignation to Castro. Two days later, Castro sent fellow revolutionary Camilo Cienfuegos to arrest Matos. Matos says that he warned Cienfuegos that his life was in danger, that Castro resented Cienfuegos' popularity and had purposely infuriated and seemed to have hoped that Matos' supporters would kill him rather than allow him to take command from Matos.C√≥mo lleg√≥ la noche: Matos, Huber: Tusquets-2004 Cienfuegos listened but relieved Matos of command and arrested Matos and his military adjutants.Thomas (1971), p.469-470 Cuban Communists later claimed Matos was helping plan a counter-revolution organized by the American Central Intelligence Agency and other Castro opponents, an operation that became the Bay of Pigs Invasion.Fabi√°n Escalante, The Secret War: CIA Covert Operations Against Cuba: 1959-62 (1995) Sentencing and imprisonment Matos under arrest The same day Matos was arrested, Cuban exile Pedro Luis D√≠az Lanz, a former air force chief of staff under Castro, flew from Florida and dropped leaflets into Havana that called for the removal of all Communists from the government. In response, Castro held a rally where he called for the reintroduction of revolutionary tribunals to try Matos and Diaz for treason. According to the New York Times, when Castro asked the crowd if Matos should be shot, \\"[a]lmost every hand was raised and the crowd again screamed: 'Firing squad! Firing squad!'\\". In the view of U.S. Ambassador to Cuba Philip Bonsal, Castro used D√≠az Lanz's action, which he characterized as a \\"bombing\\", to create a mass reaction and suppress the issues raised by Matos's resignation. Following the rally, Castro called a government meeting to determine Matos's fate. Guevara and Ra√∫l Castro favored execution, and three ministers who questioned Castro's version of events were immediately replaced by government loyalists. Castro decided against execution, explaining that \\"I don't want to turn him into a martyr.\\" Five captains and eleven lieutenants who had protested his arrest were tried with him. On the first day of the trial, 11 December, Matos testified that he had discussed the appointment of Communists to the government with officers who shared his anti-Communist sentiments, but had engaged in no conspiracy against the government. On 13 December, Ra√∫l Castro testified that Matos was trying to foster disunity by raising \\"the phantom of communism\\". Testifying the next day, Fidel Castro delivered a seven-hour speech accusing Matos and the others of campaigning against the revolution and \\"indirectly\\" promoting the interests of the United States, large landowners, and supporters of Batista and the dictatorship in the Dominican Republic. The prosecution asked for the death sentence. On 15 December, the court found Matos guilty of counter-revolutionary activity and sentenced him to twenty years in prison. He served the first six and a half years of his sentence at the Isla de la Juventud prison, where Castro had been imprisoned in 1953, and the remainder in Havana's La Caba√±a Prison. According to Matos: Matos served his full term and was released from prison on 21 October 1979. Life after prison Matos was reunited with his wife and children, who had left Cuba during the 1960s, in Costa Rica. They then moved to Miami where he lived until his death in February 2014. Matos, and his son Huber Rogelio Matos Araluce (Huber Matos Jr.), became active participants in the U.S.-based opposition to the Castro regime. He wrote a memoir, C√≥mo lleg√≥ la noche (How the Night Came).It is available in French as '. Matos served as secretary general for (CID), a Miami-based organization founded in October 1980 in Venezuela.

Examples include postage stamps, attorneys, tolls, public transit cards like the Greater London Oyster card, pay as you go cell phones, and stored-value cards such as gift cards and preloaded credit cards. Prepaid services and goods are sometimes targeted to marginal customers by retailers. Prepaid options can have substantial cost reductions over postpaid counterparts because they allow customers to monitor and budget usage in advance. Unlike postpaid or contract based services, prepaid accounts can be obtained with cash. As a result, they can be established by people who have minimal identification or poor credit ratings. Minors, immigrants, students, defaulters, and those on low incomes are typical prepaid customers. Prepaid mobile phones Recent statistics (OECD Communications Outlook 2005) indicate that 40% of the total mobile phone market in the OECD region consists of prepaid accounts. This service was invented by Portuguese provider TMN, while researching for a means to increase penetration of mobile technology by allowing anyone to buy a fully working (usually requiring a quick and simple activation process) mobile phone on any supermarket or electronics store. By removing the complications inherent to the contract system, this allowed the mobile communications user base to grow incredibly fast. In many countries this type of service became the predominant one, shortly after introduction, by providing both consumers and service providers with considerable advantages over the traditional method. In some countries, such as Italy or Mexico, market share of prepaid can be as high as 90%. In other countries, such as Finland or South Korea, the figure drops to about 2%. A Prepaid Call (or even Calling Card) is actually established through two calls. The first is either through an 800 Toll Free Number, or some come from the big telephone companies that have available international toll free numbers, or many offer calling through a local phone number, usually printed on the back that offer cheaper rates but the first call costs are passed on to the consumer. The user places this first call to get to the providers platform, and once connected, the caller is authenticated via a PIN or as seen in Europe or around other parts of the world the card may have an electronic chip on it, similar to how it is seen on the American Express Blue card. If the local number provided is used from the consumers home or cell phone, the user pays for the cost of the first call. The caller can see this on bills even if the call is not connected. The reason that 800 toll free is more expensive is because the Prepaid Calling Card Company pays for the attempts and even when calling to check a balance, the user only pays when they are actually connected. Many Local Telephone Companies don't show local usage so the consumer may not see that they are paying for a local call every time an attempt is made. This is not true when calling a toll free number from a land line, but with cell phones, air time is used. With most local phone companies, call detail can be retrieved to support this. Once authenticated, the consumer is usually presented with a balance then prompted for a destination number (the second call), and usually given the time left on the card based on the number just dialed. Then the user is connected. With smaller companies beware the hidden charges when the rates are too low to be true. They may have hidden fees or poorly advertised fees, like 3 minute rounding, connection fees, monthly, weekly, daily, or even maintenance fees. Look around when you buy these smaller name brands to make sure you know what you are buying. The pseudonymity enabled by prepaid services has recently become a concern with law enforcement agencies that consider it a safe haven for criminals and terrorists. As a result, a number of countries including Australia, Germany, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, Mozambique, Norway, Singapore, South Africa, Switzerland, and Thailand have passed laws to require that all prepaid customers register their personal information with their mobile carrier. In some countries the law requires that customers notify their mobile carrier when transferring ownership of a prepaid phone or SIM card. In Australia, the prepaid registration policy is part of a larger law enforcement initiative that includes the creation and maintenance of an Integrated Public Number Database.  Energy  In 1999, Texas deregulated the energy industry by allowing third-party affiliates to offer electricity services. As a result, a handful of Texas companies are offering the ability to prepay your electricity, with the balance going toward the posted kilowatt hours rate. This system is now common in China and Indonesia, as a way to forestall non-payment of bills. Insurance Insurance premiums are usually paid at or before the start of the insurance period, the period of cover, but the premium may at times be payable in instalments during the insurance period.

Ware. It has also released recordings by improvisational rock band Shrimp Boat and exclusively distributes the CaseQuarter and Riti labels. It was founded in 1997 by former Homestead Records label manager Steven Joerg. History Founder Steven Joerg is a native of Chicago and has stated that in high school he was heavily influenced by the do-it-yourself (DIY) approach of punk rock, especially labels such as SST Records. Moving to New York City after graduating college, Joerg worked for Bar/None Records. He became a manager of the indie rock label Homestead Records in 1992, where he signed and promoted albums by Babe the Blue Ox, Tara Key, Sleepyhead, Soul-Junk, and others. After releasing a well-received album by free jazz drummer William Hooker, Joerg convinced a reluctant Homestead to sign notable jazz musician David S. Ware and his Quartet. Their first release on the label, Cryptology, received a lead review in Rolling Stone. Joerg left Homestead in December 1996 and founded AUM Fidelity in Brooklyn in January 1997. His intent was to concentrate on modern jazz. He liquidated his savings, sold half his record collection, and took out a loan. The label derived its name partially from the Charles Mingus album Mingus Ah Um, but mostly from Om, the mantra representing the \\"soundless sound of the universe, the original tone and source of all creation\\". Not low fidelity or high fidelity, but AUM Fidelity.\\" The label launched in September 1997 with the release of David S. Ware's Wisdom of Uncertainty, and William Parker's Sunrise in the Tone World. AUM has released over 90 albums which have been acclaimed around the world. In addition to Ware and Parker, artists who have recorded for the label include Joe Morris, Whit Dickey, Other Dimensions in Music, Test, Farmers by Nature, Matthew Shipp, Mat Maneri, Hamid Drake, Rob Brown, Daniel Carter, Roy Campbell, Cooper-Moore, Chad Taylor, Roy Nathanson, Kidd Jordan, Eri Yamamoto, Gerald Cleaver, Craig Taborn, Bill Dixon, Jim Hobbs/The Fully Celebrated, Darius Jones, Little Women, Mike Pride, and others. AUM Fidelity began distributing Joe Morris' Riti label in 2002. In 2003 it co-launched the CaseQuarter label, which is devoted to gospel music of the American south. AUM Fidelity has supported the New York City downtown jazz scene. Joerg has volunteered at the Vision Festival since 1996 and produced Vision One, a two-disc benefit compilation of material recorded at the festival. AUM Fidelity was asked by musician and artist John Zorn to curate his avant-garde locale The Stone for June 16-30, 2011, which featured performances by many of the label's artists, including its then most recent signing, alto saxophonist/composer Darius Jones. In January 2009, the label was instrumental in finding a kidney donor for David S. Ware. Following his recovery and prior to his passing, Ware released five new albums with the label, including a recording of his final concert appearance, Live at Jazzfestival Saalfelden 2011. Setsuko S. Ware, David Ware's widow, and Joerg produced the Memorial Service for David S. Ware, which took place on January 7, 2013. AUM Fidelity celebrated its 15th anniversary in June 2011 with two weeks of curated performances at the Stone, and culminated with a series of concerts in June 2012 at Suoni Per Il Popolo (Montreal) and Vision Festival (New York City). William Parker's 8-CD box set, Wood Flute Songs, was produced the following year and released in late 2013, garnering a 5-star review in Down Beat and chosen as the No.1 Archive Release of the Year by The Wire. AUM continues to produce new recordings, and in 2015 launched the David S. Ware Archive Series (DSW-ARC) with a fully remixed & wholly expanded edition of Ware's first (1977) recordings as a bandleader, Birth of a Being.

The decoration is commonly applied by hand, originally by brush painting, but nowadays by stencilling or by transfer- printing, though other methods of application have also been used. The cobalt pigment is one of the very few that can withstand the highest firing temperatures that are required, in particular for porcelain, which partly accounts for its long-lasting popularity. Historically, many other colours required overglaze decoration and then a second firing at a lower temperature to fix that. The origin of this decorative style is thought to lie in Iraq, when craftsmen in Basra sought to imitate imported white Chinese stoneware with their own tin-glazed, white pottery and added decorative motifs in blue glazes. Such Abbasid-era \\"blue and white\\" pieces have been found in present- day Iraq dating to the 9th century A.D., decades after the opening of a direct sea route from Iraq to China. Later, in China, a style of decoration based on sinuous plant forms spreading across the object was perfected and most commonly used. Blue and white decoration first became widely used in Chinese porcelain in the 14th century, after the cobalt pigment for the blue began to be imported from Persia. It was widely exported, and inspired imitative wares in Islamic ceramics, and in Japan, and later European tin-glazed earthenware such as Delftware and after the techniques were discovered in the 18th century, European porcelain. Blue and white pottery in all of these traditions continues to be produced, most of it copying earlier styles. Origin and development Islamic tin-glazed earthenware, with blue and white decoration, Iraq, 9th century. The Arabic calligraphy is ghibta, i.e. \\"happiness\\".Met description Blue glazes were first developed by ancient Mesopotamians to imitate lapis lazuli, which was a highly prized stone. Later, a cobalt blue glaze became popular in Islamic pottery during the Abbasid Caliphate, during which time the cobalt was mined near Kashan, Oman, and Northern Hejaz.Medley, 177Lazaward (Lajvard) and Zaffer Cobalt Oxide in Islamic and Western Lustre Glass and Ceramics Tang and Song blue-and-white Early Chinese blue and white porcelain, c. 1335, in the Yuan dynasty; Jingdezhen ware.

The only three pieces of complete \\"Tang blue and white\\" in the world were recovered from Indonesian Belitung shipwreck in 1998 and later sold to Singapore.curating the oceans and Belintung shipwreck It appears that the technique was forgotten for some centuries. In the early 20th century, the development of the classic blue and white Jingdezhen ware porcelain was dated to the early Ming period, but consensus now agrees that these wares began to be made around 1300-1320, and were fully developed by the mid-century, as shown by the David Vases dated 1351, which are cornerstones for this chronology.Medley, 177; Kessler, 9 There are still those arguing that early pieces are mis-dated, and in fact go back to the Southern Song, but most scholars continue to reject this view.Kessler is a book devoted to arguing for earlier dates, as summarized in the Introduction. For earlier 20th century views, see p. 3 in particular. See Medley, p. 176 for a rejection of such dates. 14th-century development In the early 14th century, mass-production of fine, translucent, blue and white porcelain started at Jingdezhen, sometimes called the porcelain capital of China. This development was due to the combination of Chinese techniques and Islamic trade. The new ware was made possible by the export of cobalt from Persia (called Huihui qing, , \\"Islamic blue\\"), combined with the translucent white quality of Chinese porcelain, derived from kaolin.Finlay, p.158ff Cobalt blue was considered as a precious commodity, with a value about twice that of gold. Motifs also draw inspiration from Islamic decorations. A large portion of these blue-and-white wares were then shipped to Southwest-Asian markets through the Muslim traders based in Guangzhou. Chinese blue and white porcelain was once-fired: after the porcelain body was dried, decorated with refined cobalt-blue pigment mixed with water and applied using a brush, it was coated with a clear glaze and fired at high temperature. From the 16th century, local sources of cobalt blue started to be developed, although Persian cobalt remained the most expensive. Production of blue and white wares has continued at Jingdezhen to this day. Blue and white porcelain made at Jingdezhen probably reached the height of its technical excellence during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty (r. 1661‚Äì1722). Evolution of Chinese blue and white ware=14th century The true development of blue and white ware in China started with the first half of the 14th century, when it progressively replaced the centuries-long tradition of (normally) unpainted bluish-white southern Chinese porcelain, or Qingbai, as well as Ding ware from the north. The best, and quickly the main production was in Jingdezhen porcelain from Jiangxi Province. There was already a considerable tradition of painted Chinese ceramics, mainly represented at that time by the popular stoneware Cizhou ware, but this was not used by the court. For the first time in centuries the new blue and white appealed to the taste of the Mongol rulers of China. Blue and white ware also began making its appearance in Japan, where it was known as sometsuke. Various forms and decorations were highly influenced by China, but later developed its own forms and styles.

Blue and white porcelain however came back to prominence with the Xuande Emperor, and again developed from that time on. In this century a number of experiments were made combining underglaze blue and other colours, both underglaze and overglaze enamels. Initially copper and iron reds were the most common, but these were much more difficult to fire reliably than cobalt blue, and produced a very high rate of mis-fired wares, where a dull grey replaced the intended red. Such experiments continued over the following centuries, with the doucai and wucai techniques combining underglaze blue and other colours in overglaze.

By the end of the century, a large Chinese export porcelain trade with Europe had developed, and the so-called Kraak ware style had developed. This was by Chinese standards a rather low-quality but showy style, usually in blue and white, that became very popular in Europe, and can be seen in many Dutch Golden Age paintings of the century following; it was soon widely imitated locally.

European symbols and scenes coexisted with Chinese scenes for these objects. In the 1640s, rebellions in China and wars between the Ming dynasty and the Manchus damaged many kilns, and in 1656‚Äì1684 the new Qing dynasty government stopped trade by closing its ports. Chinese exports almost ceased and other sources were needed to fulfill the continuing Eurasian demand for blue and white. In Japan, Chinese potter refugees were able to introduce refined porcelain techniques and enamel glazes to the Arita kilns. From 1658, the Dutch East India Company looked to Japan for blue-and-white porcelain to sell in Europe. Initially, the Arita kilns like the Kakiemon kiln could not yet supply enough quality porcelain to the Dutch East India Company, but they quickly expanded their capacity. From 1659‚Äì1740, the Arita kilns were able to export enormous quantities of porcelain to Europe and Asia. Gradually the Chinese kilns recovered, and by about 1740 the first period of Japanese export porcelain had all but ceased.Ford & Impey, 126-127 From about 1640 Dutch Delftware also became a competitor, using styles frankly imitative of the East Asian decoration.

Partly as a result of the work of Francois Xavier d'Entrecolles however, an early example of industrial spying in which the details of Chinese porcelain manufacture were transmitted to Europe, Chinese exports of porcelain soon shrank considerably, especially by the end of the reign of the Qianlong Emperor.China's last empire: the great Qing William T. Rowe, Timothy Brook p.84 Though polychrome decoration in overglaze enamels was now perfected, in the famille rose and other palettes, top-quality blue and white wares for the court and elite domestic markets continued to be produced at Jingdezhen.

Meri, Jere L. Bacharach p.143 Ming dynasty blue-and-white plate, 16th century (Topkapƒ± Museum, Istanbul) From the 13th century, Chinese pictorial designs, such as flying cranes, dragons and lotus flowers also started to appear in the ceramic productions of the Near-East, especially in Syria and Egypt.Notice of British Museum \\"Islamic Art Room\\" permanent exhibit. Chinese porcelain of the 14th or 15th century was transmitted to the Middle-East and the Near East, and especially to the Ottoman Empire either through gifts or through war booty. Chinese designs were extremely influential with the pottery manufacturers at Iznik, Turkey. The Ming \\"grape\\" design in particular was highly popular and was extensively reproduced under the Ottoman Empire. Japan The Japanese were early admirers of Chinese blue and white and, despite the difficulties of obtaining cobalt (from Iran via China), soon produced their own blue and white wares, usually in Japanese porcelain, which began to be produced around 1600. As a group, these are called sometsuke (Êüì‰ªò). Much of this production is covered by the vague regional term Arita ware, but some kilns, like the high- quality Hirado ware, specialized in blue and white, and made little else. A high proportion of wares from about 1660-1740 were Japanese export porcelain, mostly for Europe. The most exclusive kiln, making Nabeshima ware for political gifts rather than trade, made much porcelain only with blue, but also used blue heavily in its polychrome wares, where the decoration of the sides of dishes is typically only in blue. Hasami ware and Tobe ware are more popular wares mostly using in blue and white.

Later some blue and white stoneware was also made. The historical production therefore all falls under the Joseon dynasty, 1392‚Äì1897. In vases, the typical wide shoulders of the shapes preferred in Korea allowed for expansive painting. Dragon and flowering branches were among the popular subjects.

Chinese blue-and-white ware were copied in Europe from the 16th century, with the faience blue-and-white technique called alla porcelana. Soon after the first experiments to reproduce the material of Chinese blue-and-white porcelain were made with Medici porcelain. These early works seem to be mixing influences from Islamic as well as Chinese blue-and- white wares.Western Decorative Arts National Gallery of Art (U.S.), Rudolf Distelberger p.238 File:Blue relief vase Florence 2nd half 15th century.jpgBlue relief vase, Florence, 2nd half of 15th century.

By the beginning of the 17th century Chinese blue and white porcelain was being exported directly to Europe. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Oriental blue and white porcelain was highly prized in Europe and America and sometimes enhanced by fine silver and gold mounts, it was collected by kings and princes.

The European manufacture of porcelain started at Meissen in Germany in 1707. The detailed secrets of Chinese hard-paste porcelain technique were transmitted to Europe through the efforts of the Jesuit Father Francois Xavier d'Entrecolles between 1712 and 1722.Baghdiantz McCabe, Ina (2008) Orientalism in Early Modern France, , Berg Publishing, Oxford, p.220ff The early wares were strongly influenced by Chinese and other Oriental porcelains and an early pattern was blue onion, which is still in production at the Meissen factory today. The first phase of the French porcelain was also strongly influenced by Chinese designs. Early English porcelain wares were also influenced by Chinese wares and when, for example, the production of porcelain started at Worcester, nearly forty years after Meissen, Oriental blue and white wares provided the inspiration for much of the decoration used. Hand-painted and transfer-printed wares were made at Worcester and at other early English factories in a style known as Chinoiserie. Chelsea porcelain and Bow porcelain in London and Lowestoft porcelain in East Anglia made especially heavy use of blue and white. By the 1770s Wedgwood's jasperware, in biscuit stoneware and still using cobalt oxide, found a new approach to blue and white ceramics, and remains popular today. Many other European factories followed this trend. In Delft, Netherlands blue and white ceramics taking their designs from Chinese export porcelains made for the Dutch market were made in large numbers throughout the 17th Century. Blue and white Delftware was itself extensively copied by factories in other European countries, including England, where it is known as English Delftware. =Patterns= A blue and white Staffordshire Willow pattern plate The plate shown in the illustration (left) is decorated, using transfer printing, with the famous willow pattern and was made by Royal Stafford; a factory in the English county of Staffordshire. Such is the persistence of the willow pattern that it is difficult to date the piece shown with any precision; it is possibly quite recent but similar wares have been produced by English factories in huge numbers over long periods and are still being made today. The willow pattern, said to tell the sad story of a pair of star-crossed lovers, was an entirely European design, though one that was strongly influenced in style by design features borrowed from Chinese export porcelains of the 18th century. The willow pattern was, in turn, copied by Chinese potters, but with the decoration hand painted rather than transfer- printed.

Illustration of the inner workings of the Astronomical Clock Tower Su Song (; courtesy name: Zirong )Harrist, 239, footnote 9. (1020‚Äì1101 AD) was a Chinese polymathic scientist and statesman. Excelling in a variety of fields, he was accomplished in mathematics, astronomy, cartography, geography, horology, pharmacology, mineralogy, metallurgy, zoology, botany, mechanical engineering, hydraulic engineering, civil engineering, architecture, invention, art, poetry, philosophy, antiquities, and statesmanship during the Song Dynasty (960‚Äì1279). Su Song was the engineer for a hydro-mechanical astronomical clock tower in medieval Kaifeng, which employed the use of an early escapement mechanism.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 445.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 448.Bodde, 140.Fry, 10. The escapement mechanism of Su's clock tower had been invented by Buddhist monk Yi Xing and government official Liang Lingzan in 725 AD to operate a water-powered armillary sphere, although Su's armillary sphere was the first to be provided with a mechanical clock drive.Needham, Volume 3, 351. Su's clock tower also featured the oldest known endless power-transmitting chain drive, called the tian ti (), or \\"celestial ladder\\", as depicted in his horological treatise.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 111. The clock tower had 133 different clock jacks to indicate and sound the hours.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 165. Su Song's treatise about the clock tower, Xinyi Xiangfayao (), has survived since its written form in 1092 and official printed publication in 1094. The book has been analyzed by many historians, such as Joseph Needham. The clock itself, however, was dismantled by the invading Jurchen army in 1127 AD, and although attempts were made to reassemble it, the tower was never successfully reinstated. The Xinyi Xiangfayao was Su's best-known treatise, but the polymath compiled other works as well. He completed a large celestial atlas of several star maps, several terrestrial maps, as well as a treatise on pharmacology. The latter discussed related subjects on mineralogy, zoology, botany, and metallurgy. European Jesuit visitors to China like Matteo Ricci and Nicolas Trigault briefly wrote about Chinese clocks with wheel drives,Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 438. but others mistakenly believed that the Chinese had never advanced beyond the stage of the clepsydra, incense clock, and sundial. They thought that advanced mechanical clockworks were new to China and that these mechanisms were something valuable that Europeans could offer to the Chinese.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 435‚Äì440. Although not as prominent as in the Song period, contemporary Chinese texts of the Ming Dynasty (1368‚Äì1644) described a relatively unbroken history of mechanical clocks in China, from the 13th century to the 16th. However, Su Song's clock tower still relied on the use of a waterwheel to power it, and was thus not fully mechanical like late medieval European clocks. Life and works A scale model of Su Song's Astronomical Clock Tower Career as a scholar- official Su Song was of Hokkien ancestry who was born in modern-day Fujian, near medieval Quanzhou. Like his contemporary, Shen Kuo (1031‚Äì1095), Su Song was a polymath, a person whose expertise spans a significant number of different fields of study. It was written by his junior colleague and Hanlin scholar Ye Mengde (1077‚Äì1148)Liu, 593. that in Su's youth, he mastered the provincial exams and rose to the top of the examination list for writing the best article on general principles and structure of the Chinese calendar. From an early age, his interests in astronomy and calendrical science led him onto a distinguished path as a state bureaucrat. In his spare time, he was fond of writing poetry, which he used to praise the works of artists such as the painter Li Gonglin (1049‚Äì1106).Edwards, 175‚Äì176.Harrist, 269. He was also an antiquarian and collector of old artworks from previous dynasties. In matters of administrative government, he had attained the rank of Ambassador and President of the Ministry of Personnel at the capital of Kaifeng, and was known also as an expert in administration and finance.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 32. After serving in the Ministry of Personnel, he became a Minister of Justice in 1086. He was appointed as a distinguished editor for the Academy of Scholarly Worthies, where in 1063 he edited, redacted, commented on, and added a preface for the classic work Huainanzi of the Han Dynasty (202 BC‚Äì220 AD).Roth, 224 & 226. Eventually, Su rose to the post of Vice President of the Chancellery Secretariat. Among many honorable positions and titles conferred upon him, Su Song was also one of the 'Deputy Tutors of the Heir Apparent'. At court, he chose to distance himself from the political rivalries of the Conservatives, led by Prime Minister Sima Guang (1019‚Äì1086), and the Reformists, led by Prime Minister Wang Anshi (1021‚Äì1086); although many of his associates were of the Conservative faction. In 1077, he was dispatched on a diplomatic mission to the Liao Dynasty of the Khitan people to the north,Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 446‚Äì447. sharing ideas about calendrical science, as the Liao state had created its own calendar in 994 AD.Bowman, 105. In a finding that reportedly embarrassed the court, Su Song acknowledged to the emperor that the calendar of the Khitan people was in fact a bit more accurate than their own, resulting in the fining and punishment of officials in the Bureau of Astronomy and Calendar.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 447. Su was supposed to travel north to Liao and arrive promptly for a birthday celebration and feast on a day which coincided with the winter solstice of the Song calendar, but was actually a day behind the Liao calendar.Wittfogel & Feng, 599. Historian Liu Heping states that Emperor Zhezong of Song sponsored Su Song's clocktower in 1086 in order to compete with the Liao for \\"scientific and national superiority.\\"Liu, 577. In 1081, the court instructed Su Song to compile into a book the diplomatic history of Song-Liao relations, an elaborate task that, once complete, filled 200 volumes.Breslin, 14. With his extensive knowledge of cartography, Su Song was able to settle a heated border dispute between the Song and Liao dynasties.Wright, 213. Astronomy A star map with equidistant cylindrical projection, from Su Song's Xinyi Xiangfayao, 1092Needham, Volume 3, 208. Su Song also created a celestial atlas (in five separate maps), which had the hour circles between the xiu (lunar mansions) forming the astronomical meridians, with stars marked in an equidistant cylindrical projection on each side of the equator,Miyajima, Kazuhiko (1997). Projection Methods in Chinese, Korean and Japanese Star Maps from \\"Highlights of Astronomy\\" vol. 11B p. 714. Ed. J. Andersen. Norwell: Kluwer Academic Publishers. and thus, was in accordance to their north polar distances.Needham, Volume 4, Part 3, 569. Furthermore, Su Song must have taken advantage of the astronomical findings of his political rival and contemporary astronomer Shen Kuo.Needham, Volume 3, 278. This is so because Su Song's fourth star map places the position of the pole star halfway between Tian shu (‚àí350 degrees) and the current Polaris; this was the more accurate calculation (by 3 degrees) that Shen Kuo had made when he observed the pole star over a period of three months with his width-improved sighting tube. There were many star maps written before Song's book, but the greatest significance of these star maps by Su Song is, that they represent the oldest extant star maps in printed form.Sivin, III, 32. Pharmacology, botany, zoology, and mineralogy Su categorized and accurately described the attributes of many minerals, including the red, pitted surface of realgar seen above. In 1070, Su Song and a team of scholars compiled and edited the Bencao Tujing ('Illustrated Pharmacopoeia', original source material from 1058‚Äì1061), which was a groundbreaking treatise on pharmaceutical botany, zoology, and mineralogy.Wu, 5. In compiling information for pharmaceutical knowledge, Su Song worked with such notable scholars as Zhang Yuxi, Lin Yi, Zhang Dong, and many others.Unschuld, 60. This treatise documented a wide range of pharmaceutical practices, including the use of ephedrine as a drug.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 446. It includes valuable information on metallurgy and the steel and iron industries during 11th century China. He created a systematic approach to listing various different minerals and their use in medicinal concoctions, such as all the variously known forms of mica that could be used to cure ills through digestion.Needham, Volume 3, 648. He wrote of the subconchoidal fracture of native cinnabar, signs of ore beds, and provided description on crystal form.Needham, Volume 3, 649. Similar to the ore channels formed by circulation of ground water written of by the later German scientist Georgius Agricola, Su Song made similar statements concerning copper carbonate, as did the earlier Rihua Bencao of 970 with copper sulphate. Su's book was also the first pharmaceutical treatise written in China to describe the flax, Urtica thunbergiana, and Corchoropsis tomentosa (crenata) plants.Needham, Volume 6, Part 1, 174, 175. According to Edward H. Schafer, Su accurately described the translucent quality of fine realgar, its origin from pods found in rocky river gorges, its matrix being pitted with holes and having a deep red, almost purple color, and that the mineral varied in sizes ranging from the size of a pea to a walnut.Schafer, 81. Citing evidence from an ancient work by Zheng Xuan (127‚Äì200), Su believed that physicians of the ancient Zhou Dynasty (1046‚Äì256 BC) used realgar as a remedy for ulcers.Schafer, 83. As believed in Su's day, the \\"five poisons\\" used by Zhou era physicians for this purpose were thought to be cinnabar, realgar, chalcanthite, alum, and magnetite. Su made systematic descriptions of animals and the environmental regions they could be found, such as different species of freshwater, marine, and shore crabs.West, 606. For example, he noted that the freshwater crab species Eriocher sinensis could be found in the Huai River running through Anhui, in waterways near the capital city, as well as reservoirs and marshes of Hebei. Su's book was preserved and copied into the Bencao Gangmu of the Ming Dynasty (1368‚Äì1644) physician and pharmacologist Li Shizhen (1518‚Äì1593).West, 605. Horology and mechanical engineering Armillary sphere on roof Su Song compiled one of the greatest Chinese horological treatises of the Middle Ages, surrounding himself with an entourage of notable engineers and astronomers to assist in various projects. Xinyi Xiangfayao (lit. \\"Essentials of a New Method for Mechanizing the Rotation of an Armillary Sphere and a Celestial Globe\\"), written in 1092, was the final product of his life's achievements in horology and clockwork. The book included 47 different illustrations of great detail of the mechanical workings for his astronomical clock tower.Ceccarelli, 58. Su Song's greatest project was the 40-foot-tall water-powered astronomical clock tower constructed in Kaifeng, the wooden pilot model completed in 1088, the bronze components cast by 1090, while the wholly finished work was completed by 1094 during the reign of Emperor Zhezong of Song.Fry, 9.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 495. The emperor had previously commissioned Han Gonglian, Acting Secretary of the Ministry of Personnel, to head the project, but the leadership position was instead handed down to Su Song. The emperor ordered in 1086 for Su to reconstruct the hun yi, or \\"armillary clock\\", for a new clock tower in the capital city. Su worked with the aid of Han Gong-lian, who applied his extensive knowledge of mathematics to the construction of the clock tower.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 39. A small-scale wooden model was first crafted by Su Song, testing its intricate parts before applying it to an actual full-scale clock tower.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 465. In the end, the clock tower had many impressive features, such as the hydro-mechanical, rotating armillary sphere crowning the top level and weighing some 10 to 20 tons, a bronze celestial globe located in the middle that was 4.5 feet in diameter, mechanically-timed and rotating mannequins dressed in miniature Chinese clothes that exited miniature opening doors to announce the time of day by presenting designated reading plaques, ringing bells and gongs, or beating drums,Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 455. a sophisticated use of oblique gears and an escapement mechanism,Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 456. as well as an exterior facade of a fanciful Chinese pagoda. Upon its completion, the tower was called the Shui Yun Yi Xiang Tai, or \\"Tower for the Water-Powered Sphere and Globe\\". Joseph Needham writes: south polar projection for Su's celestial globe, Xinyi Xiangfayao, 1092 Years after Su's death, the capital city of Kaifeng was besieged and captured in 1127 by the Jurchens of the Manchuria-based Jin Dynasty during the Jin‚ÄìSong wars.Wright, 96. The clock tower was dismantled piece by piece by the Jurchens, who carted its components back to their own capital in modern-day Beijing. However, due to the complexity of the tower, they were unable to piece it back together. The new Emperor Gaozong of Song instructed Su's son, Su Xie, to construct a new astronomical clock tower in its place, and Su Xie set to work studying his father's texts with a team of other experts. However, they were also unsuccessful in creating another clock tower, and Su Xie was convinced that Su Song had purposefully left out essential components in his written work and diagrams so that others would not steal his ideas. As the sinologist historian Derk Bodde points out, Su Song's astronomical clock did not lead to a new generation of mass-produced clockworks throughout China since his work was largely a government-sponsored endeavor for the use of astronomers and astrologers in the imperial court.Bodde, 362. Yet the mechanical legacy of Su Song did not end with his work. In about 1150, the writer Xue Jixuan noted that there were four types of clocks in his day, the basic waterclock, the incense clock, the sundial, and the clock with 'revolving and snapping springs' ('gun tan').Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 462. The rulers of the continuing Yuan Dynasty (1279‚Äì1368 AD) had a vested interest in the advancement of mechanical clockworks.Fry, 12. The astronomer Guo Shoujing helped restore the Beijing Ancient Observatory beginning in 1276, where he crafted a water-powered armillary sphere and clock with clock jacks being fully implemented and sounding the hours.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 504‚Äì505. Complex gearing for uniquely Chinese clockworks were continued in the Ming Dynasty (1368‚Äì1644), with new designs driven by the power of falling sand instead of water to provide motive power to the wheel drive, and some Ming clocks perhaps featured reduction gearing rather than the earlier escapement of Su Song.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 509‚Äì512. The earliest such design of a sand-clock was made by Zhan Xiyuan around 1370, which featured not only the scoop wheel of Su Song' device, but also a new addition of a stationary dial face over which a pointer circulated, much like new European clocks of the same period.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 511. Su Song's escapement mechanism The oldest known illustration of an endless power-transmitting chain drive, from Su's book of 1092; it was called the \\"celestial ladder\\" and was used for coupling the main driving shaft of his clock tower to the armillary sphere gear box (which was mounted at the top of the tower). In Su Song's waterwheel linkwork device, the action of the escapement's arrest and release was achieved by gravity exerted periodically as the continuous flow of liquid filled containers of a limited size. In a single line of evolution, Su Song's clock therefore united the concept of the clepsydra and the mechanical clock into one device run by mechanics and hydraulics. In his memorial, Su Song wrote about this concept: In his writing, Su Song credited, as the predecessor of his working clock, the hydraulic-powered armillary sphere of Zhang Heng (78‚Äì139 AD), an earlier Chinese scientist.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 466. Su Song was also strongly influenced by the earlier armillary sphere created by Zhang Sixun (976 AD), who also employed the escapement mechanism and used liquid mercury instead of water in the waterwheel of his astronomical clock tower (since liquid mercury would not freeze during winter and would not corrode and rust metal components over time).Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 469‚Äì471. However, Su Song stated in his writing that after Zhang's death, no one was able to replicate his device, much like his own.Needham Volume 4, Part 2, 470. The mechanical clockworks for Su Song's astronomical tower featured a great driving-wheel that was 11 feet in diameter, carrying 36 scoops, into each of which water poured at a uniform rate from the \\"constant-level tank\\" (Needham, Fig. 653). The main driving shaft of iron, with its cylindrical necks supported on iron crescent-shaped bearings, ended in a pinion, which engaged a gear wheel at the lower end of the main vertical transmission shaft.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 451. Joseph Needham gives a general description of the clock tower itself: Celestial globe on third floor Time display panel Water wheel with water tank and escapement mechanism That was figure Fig. 650, while Fig. 656 displays the upper and lower norias with their tanks and the manual wheel for operating them. Fig. 657 displays a rather miniature and scaled-down picture for the basics of the escapement mechanism in an illustration (from Su's book), with Needham's caption here in this quote: \\"The 'celestial balance' or escapement mechanism of Su Song's clockwork (Xinyi Xiangfayao, ch. 3, p. 18b)\\".Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 458. The latter figure carefully labels: *a right upper lock *upper link *left upper lock *axle or pivot *long chain *upper counterweight *sump *checking fork of the lower balancing lever *coupling tongue *main (i.e., lower) counterweight Figure 658 displays a more intricate and most-telling half-page scale drawing of Su Song's large escapement mechanism, labeling these individual parts as they interact with one another: *arrested spoke *left upper lock *scoop being filled by *water jet from constant-level tank *small counterweight *checking fork tripped by a projection pin on the scoop, and forming the near end of *the lower balancing lever with *its lower counterweight *coupling tongue, connected by *the long chain with *the upper balancing lever, which has at its far end *the upper counterweight, and at its near end *a short length chain connecting it with the upper lock beneath it; *right upper lockNeedham, Volume 4, Part 2, 460. The endless chain drive An endless roller chain and sprocket, used in Su Song's clock tower to operate the rotation of the armillary sphere The world's oldest illustrated depiction of an endless power- transmitting chain drive is from Su Song's horological treatise. It was used in the clockworks for coupling the main drive shaft to the armillary sphere gearbox (rotating three small pinions),Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 457. as seen in Needham's Fig. 410 and Fig. 652. This belonged to the uppermost end of the main vertical transmission shaft, incorporating right angle gears and oblique gears connected by a short idling shaft. The toothed ring gear called the diurnal motion gear ring was fit around the shell of the armillary sphere along the declination parallel near the southern pole.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 456‚Äì457. Although the ancient Greek Philo of Byzantium (3rd century BC) featured a sort of endless belt for his magazine arcuballista, which did not transmit continuous power, the influential source for Su Song's chain drive is most likely the continuously-driven chain pump known in China since the Han Dynasty (202 BC‚Äì220 AD). From his horological treatise, Su Song states: In addition, the motion gear rings and the upper drive wheel both had 600 teeth, which by Su's mathematical precision carefully calculated measured units of the day in a division of 1/600.Fry, 11. These gears, having 600 teeth, thus ensured the division of the day into measurements of 2 minutes and 24 seconds each. Su Song's armillary sphere A modern replica of a Ming Dynasty era armillary sphere found at the Beijing Ancient Observatory In Joseph Needham's third volume of Science and Civilization in China, the drawing for Fig. 159 displays a drawing of Su Song's armillary sphere (as depicted in his 11th century treatise), complete with three 'nests' or layers of mechanically- rotated rings. It was the earlier Chinese astronomer Li Chun-feng of the Tang Dynasty who in 633 AD created the first armillary sphere with three layers to calibrate multiple aspects of astronomical observation.Needham, Volume 3, 343. Zhang's armillary sphere has often been compared to that of the 13th century monarch Alfonso X of Castile in Islamic-era Spain. The chief difference was that Alfonso's instrument featured an arrangement for making measurements of the azimuth and altitude, which was present in the Arabic tradition, while Su Song's armillary sphere was duly graduated.Needham, Volume 3, 353. For the drawing of Su's armillary sphere, the listing of components are: *The Outer NestNeedham, Volume 3, 351. **meridian circle **horizon circle **outer equator circle *The Middle Nest **solstitial colure circle **ecliptic circle **diurnal motion gear-ring, connecting with the power-drive *The Inner Nest **polar- mounted declination ring or hour-angle circle, with **sighting tube attached to it and strengthened by a **diametral brace *Other Parts **vertical column concealing the transmission shaft **supporting columns in the form of dragons **cross-piece of the base, incorporating water-levels **south polar pivot **north polar pivot Transmission of Su's text and his legacy When Su Song's Xinyi Xiangfayao was written in 1092 and the horological monograph finalized and presented in 1094, his work was published and widely printed in the north (see woodblock printing and movable type of Bi Sheng). In the south, printing and circulation of his work was not widely distributed until Shi Yuanzhi of Jiangsu had it printed there in 1172. When presenting his clocktower design to the Emperor Zhezong, Su Song equated the constant flow of water with the continuous movements of the heavens, the latter of which symbolized the unceasing power of the emperor.Liu, 578, 585. This appealed to emperor, who featured artwork representing the clocktower on vehicles of major imperial processions, as illustrated in the Illustration of the Imperial Grand Carriage Procession of 1053.Liu, 578. The later Ming Dynasty/Qing Dynasty scholar Qian Zeng (1629‚Äì1699) held an old volume of Su's work, which he faithfully reproduced in a newly printed edition. He took special care in avoiding any rewording or inconsistencies with the original text as well. Again, it was later reprinted by Zhang Xizu (1799‚Äì1844). Su Song's treatise on astronomical clockwork was not the only one made in China during his day, as the Song Shi (compiled in 1345) records the written treatise of the Shuiyunhun Tianjiyao (Wade‚ÄìGiles: Shui Yun Hun Thien Chi Yao; lit. Essentials of the [Technique of] making Astronomical Apparatus revolve by Water-Power), written by Juan Taifa. However, this treatise no longer survives.Needham, Volume 4, Part 2, 450. In the realm of modern research, the late British biochemist and historian of Chinese science Joseph Needham (1900‚Äì1995) (known as Li Yuese in China) did extensive research and analysis of Su Song's texts and various achievements in his Science and Civilization in China book series. Joseph Needham also related many detailed passages from Su's contemporary medieval Chinese sources on the life of Su and his achievements known in his day. In 1956, John Christiansen reconstructed a model of Su Song's clocktower in a famous drawing, which garnered attention in the West towards 11th-century Chinese engineering.Liu, 577‚Äì579. A miniature model of Su Song's clock was reconstructed by John Cambridge and is now on display at the National Science Museum at South Kensington, London. In China, the clocktower was reconstructed to one-fifth its actual scale by Wang Zhenduo, who worked for the Chinese Historical Museum in Beijing in the 1950s.Xi, 466.

On 10 January 1995 the United States Central Command announced that 4,000 personnel (including 2,600 U.S. Marines) would be deployed to Somalia to assist with Operation United Shield. At that time, the UNOSOM II peacekeeping force remaining in Somalia was a combined force of approximately 2,500 troops, from Pakistan and Bangladesh. The United Nations Security Council established 31 March 1995 as the deadline for the departure of all its forces participating in U.N. operations in Somalia. A U.S. Marine Corps Bell UH-1N Twin Huey helicopter lifts off from the ramp at Moi International Airport in February 1995 LtGen Anthony Zinni (Commanding General, I Marine Expeditionary Force) was given command of the operation, which was to ensure the safe execution of an amphibious withdrawal. General Zinni, who served as director for operations for UNITAF during Operation Restore Hope in 1992‚Äì1993, knew most of the top Somali leaders at the time of Operation United Shield. The commanders utilized a 4,000 man air-ground task force to cover the withdrawal and prevent further casualties, while a seaborne coalition of American, Italian, Pakistani, French, British, and Malaysian naval vessels waited just off the coast of Mogadishu to accept the withdrawing forces. Execution * 7 January 1995: LtGen Anthony Zinni (Commanding General, I Marine Expeditionary Force) assembled a Combined Task Force consisting of air, ground, naval, psychological, and special operations forces.

During this operation, which lasted a little over four hours, the U.S. put a mechanized force consisting of about 1,800 US marines and 350 Italian marines and airborne soldiers, along with 150 pieces of military equipment ashore. These men and machines (including LCUs LAVs, AAVs, and LCACs) were employed to rapidly secure Mogadishu International Airport and New Port (the seaport facility). The entire amphibious landing was complete by 0430 on the morning of 28 February.DefenseLink, U.S. Department of Defense: UNITED SHIELD Press briefing, 28 February 1995 * 28 February 1995: The UNOSOM II command was relieved, and the CTF began withdrawing the UNOSOM II forces. * 3 March 1995: 73 hours after the beginning of the amphibious landing, 2,422 United Nations troops, approximately 3,800 CTF troops and over a hundred combat vehicles had been withdrawn without any loss of life among any of the coalition forces. * 6 March 1995: the CTF redeployed to their respective home stations. * 17 March 1995: the CTF was disestablished.

The station operates at 1 kW of power, and is owned by The News-Gazette, the primary newspaper in the Champaign-Urbana Metropolitan Area. The station provides news and information for the city, and agricultural information for surrounding farmland. The station broadcasts Rush Limbaugh, Sean Hannity, Dave Ramsey, Kim Komando, Jim Bohannon and Bill Cunningham. History The station signed on for the first time on January 24, 1937 as the area's first commercial radio station. David W. Stevick, publisher of the News-Gazette, had applied for a license in 1935, and his wife Helen and daughter Marajen continued the project. They named the station WDWS in his honor. Although the station broadcasts at only 1,000 watts, the signal is easily received throughout much of east-central Illinois due to the area's flat land and near- perfect ground conductivity. WHMS-FM, which also broadcasts from Champaign, is the sister station to WDWS, and was known as WDWS-FM for many years. The two stations are the flagships for Illinois Fighting Illini football and basketball games; a role that WDWS has held throughout its history. Longtime sports director Jim Turpin also doubled as the radio voice of the Illini from 1960 until 2002. WDWS also airs the Illini women's basketball, volleyball, and baseball games exclusively. WDWS broadcast the Chicago Cubs in 2011, however Cubs games moved to WGKC in 2012. WDWS was the east central Illinois affiliate for the St. Louis Cardinals when it signed on until 2010. WDWS has been a CBS Radio affiliate for its entire history, except for a period from 2001 to 2009 when it was affiliated with ABC News Radio. The station has been carrying Rush Limbaugh since 1997. Sean Hannity was added in 2009. WDWS is known throughout the area for its morning program, Penny for Your Thoughts. The show, formerly hosted by Turpin and since 2018 by Brian Barnhart, is known for its unique open-line format.

These wares were initially grouped under the French names of ' (\\"green family\\"), and ' (pink family) introduced by Albert Jacquemart in 1862. The other terms ' (yellow) and ' (black) may have been introduced later by dealers or collectors and they are generally considered subcategories of famille verte. Famille verte porcelain was produced mainly during the Kangxi era, while famille rose porcelain was popular in the 18th and 19th century. Much of the Chinese production was Jingdezhen porcelain, and a large proportion were made for export to the West, but some of the finest were made for the Imperial court. Famille verte Dish with Bird on Peach Branch, famille verte, Kangxi reign, Jingdezhen porcelain Famille verte (Â∫∑ÁÜô‰∫îÂΩ©, Kangxi wucai, also Á¥†‰∏âÂΩ©, Susancai), adopted in the Kangxi period around 1680, uses green in a few different shades and iron red with other overglaze colours. It developed from the wucai (‰∫îÂΩ©, \\"Five colours\\") style, which combines underglaze cobalt blue with a few overglaze colours. The famille verte enamels may be painted on the biscuit (unglazed prefired ware) with no underglaze blue, or over high-fired glaze, producing wares of different appearances. Wares with enamls painted on the biscuit usually have a solid-colour ground such as yellow, black or green, while those painted over the glaze may have a white ground. Occasionally both underglaze and overglaze blue may be seen in the same object. The firing to fuse the enamels was done at a relatively low temperature. The colours found in famille verte are typically green, red, yellow, blue and aubergine (non-vivid purple). Black may also be used and occasionally gold. The blue colour is more violet or royal blue in tone, which is different in shade from the blue used in Ming dynasty porcelain. The ability to achieve colour gradation famille verte is limited. The coloured enamels are often painted over the pure white body of the porcelain which comes over through the glaze. The colours may also be set off on a black or yellow grounds (known as famille noire and famille jaune respectively), and more rarely aubergine and green. Famille verte wares were popular for several decades until the 1720s after the reign of Kangxi when it became supplanted by famille rose which has a greater colour range. It continued to be made in small amounts in the subsequent periods, and its popularity revived in the West in the late 19th and early 20th century.

Famille noire Famille noire (Chinese: Â¢®Âú∞Á¥†‰∏âÂΩ©, Modi susancai) uses a black ground (although some clobbered wares had the black added in the 19th century). Famille noire wares were made in the Kangxi era. They may have a copper-green lead based enamel painted over dry black cobalt ground on the biscuit, and a transparent green glaze was then applied, giving it a near-iridescent appearance. Famille noire was once highly appreciated by western collectors, which led to high prices and many pieces were then counterfeited, with the result that a large proportion of surviving examples are forgeries. The popularity of this type of porcelain has since declined. File:MET 14 40 417 O1 sf.jpgFamille jaune vase, probably Kangxi reign, Jingdezhen. Porcelain painted in polychrome enamels on the biscuit and on the glaze . File:MET 61 200 49ab O4 sf.jpgFamille noire vase, Kangxi reign, Jingdezhen Famille rose Famille rose bowl, Imperial porcelain, Jingdezhen Famille rose, known in Chinese as fencai () or ruancai ( / ), 'pale colours' or 'soft colours'), yangcai (), lit. 'foreign colours'), and falangcai (, lit. 'enamel colours'), was introduced in China during the reign of Kangxi (1654‚Äì1722), possibly around 1720, but perfected only in the Yongzheng era when the finest pieces were made. Famille rose is named after its pink coloured enamel, but which may actually ranged from pale pink to deep ruby. Apart from pink, a range of other soft colour palettes were used in famille rose, hence the term fencai. The gradation of colours was produced by mixing coloured enamels with 'glassy white' (ÁéªÁíÉÁôΩ, boli bai), an opaque white enamel (lead arsenate). Famille rose colour palette was first achieved in Europe through the use of purple of Cassius made of colloidal gold and first used on glass. It is generally believe that the use of the new colour palette in China was introduced by Jesuits in China to the Imperial court, initially on enamels used on metal wares such as cloisonn√© produced in the falang workshop (ÁèêÁêÖ‰Ωú, falang meaning enamel may have originated from the word for the \\"Franks\\" or \\"France\\"), or through adaptation of enamels used in tin-glazed South German earthenware. Research has failed to show that the chemical composition of the pink colour pigment to be the same as that of the European one. However, the term used by Tang Ying (who oversaw the production of porcelain at Jingdezhen) and in Qing documents was yangcai (\\"foreign colours\\"), indicating its foreign origin or influence. Rudimentary famille rose have been found in Chinese porcelain from the 1720s, although the technique was not fully developed until around 1730 during the Yongzheng period. The pink of the early pieces of the 1720s were darker in colours made with ruby-coloured glass, but after 1725 softer shades were achieved by mixing with white enamels. At the Palace workshops in Beijing, experimentation was conducted to develop a range of enamel colours and techniques for applying the such enamels onto blank porcelain supplied by Jingdezhen, and the wares produced were called falangcai. Court painters were employed to make drafts to decorate such wares, which produced a new aesthetic style of decoration on porcelain. Falangcai decorations may be painted on a white ground, or on a coloured ground with yellow the most popular. As falangcai was produced at the palace for its exclusive use, there are relatively fewer pieces of falangcai porcelain. With the successful creation of falangcai porcelain at the palace, falangcai was also then made at the imperial kilns of Jingdezhen. The term yangcai was used to refer to porcelain produced at Jingdezhen to imitate falangcai. Visually there is little difference in appearance between falangcai and yangcai wares produced for imperial use, but differences may be detected in the chemical composition of the flux used. Ruancai ('soft colours') was also a term used in the Yongzheng era as the colours used are softer in contrast to the 'hard colours' (Á°¨ÂΩ©, yingcai) previously used for famille verte or wucai. Fencai is the more modern term used by Chen Liu (ÈôàÊµè) in the early 20th century and it then replaced yangcai in Chinese usage. The famille rose enamels allow for a greater range of colour and tone than was previously possible, enabling the depiction of more complex images, particularly during the Qianlong era, and decorations became more elaborate and crowded in the later Qianlong period. The images may be painted on coloured grounds, including yellow, blue, pink, coral red, light green, 'cafe au lait' and brown. Black ground or famille noire may also be used on famille rose ware, but they are not highly regarded. Many produced in the Qianlong period were on eggshell porcelain. Famille rose supplanted famille verte in popularity, and its production overtook blue and white porcelain in the mid-18th century. It remained popular throughout the 18th and the 19th centuries and continued to be made in the 20th century. The quality of wares produced however declined after the Qianlong period. Canton ware with Rose Mandarin decoration Jingdezhen produced many famille rose pieces, and some of the finest pieces were made there. However, from the late 18th century onwards, many pieces were decorated in the port city of Canton to produce the Canton ware intended for export, using white porcelain from Jingdezhen. In contrast to the more refined 'court-taste' porcelain, export wares particularly those from the 19th century tend to be highly and brightly decorated. The decorative patterns used in these export wares may be referred to as Rose Canton, Rose Mandarin and Rose Medallion. Famille rose enamels were known to have been used in Europe before its usage became established in China, for example in Vienna porcelain made by the Du Paquier factory in 1725. Large number of famille rose porcelains were exported from China to the West, and many European factories such as Meissen, Chelsea and Chantilly copied the famille rose palette used in Chinese porcelain. Export of Chinese porcelain then declined due to competition from the European factories.

It is a Western classification for Qing dynasty porcelain known in Chinese by various terms: fencai, ruancai, yangcai, and falangcai. The colour palette was introduced in China during the reign of Kangxi (1654‚Äì1722) by Western Jesuits who worked at the palace, but perfected only in the Yongzheng era when the finest pieces were made. Although famille rose is named after its pink coloured enamel, the colour may actually ranged from pale pink to deep ruby. Apart from pink, a range of other soft colour palettes are also used in famille rose. The gradation of colours was produced by mixing coloured enamels with 'glassy white' (ÁéªÁíÉÁôΩ, boli bai), an opaque white enamel (lead arsenate), and its range of colour was further extended by mixing different colours. Famille rose was popular in the 18th and 19th century, and it continued to be made in the 20th century. Large quantity of famille rose porcelain were exported to Europe, United States and other countries, and many of these export wares were Jingdezhen porcelain decorated in Canton. Porcelains with famile rose palette were also produced in European factories. Terms Moon flask (right) in famille rose, Jingdezhen porcelain, Yongzheng reign, the Percival David Collection at the British Museum The term ' meaning \\"pink family\\" was introduced together with ' (\\"green family\\") in 1862 by Albert Jacquemart to classify Qing dynasty porcelain by their colour palettes. This is still the term most commonly used, although various other terms originating from Chinese are also used. Different authors, however, have used these Chinese terms differently, and recent Chinese sources may use these terms in the following manner: *Falangcai (, lit. 'enamel colours') refers to overglaze enamel porcelain produced at the workshops within the Forbidden City itself in Beijing. The word falang meaning \\"enamel\\" may have come from the word for the \\"Franks\\" or \\"France\\", and falangcai originated as an attempt to apply the enamel colours used in metal wares such as cloisonn√© onto porcelain. Falangcai wares were produced at the palace workshops using glazed white porcelain from Jingdezhen, which were then painted with enamels and fired at a relative low temperature in muffle kilns. As these wares were produced in small workshops at the Imperial Palace and intended for its exclusive use, they are consequently rarer than other types of famille rose porcelain. There may be only around 400 surviving pieces of falangcai around the world. The term falangcai, however, may apply to other enamel colours and need not refer exclusively to famille rose. *Yangcai (), lit. 'foreign colours') is a type of porcelain produced at the Imperial kilns in Jingdezhen. According to Tang Ying who supervised the production of porcelain at the Imperial kilns in Jingdezhen, it was initially created in imitation of falangcai. Visually there may be little difference in appearance between falangcai and yangcai wares produced for imperial use, but differences may be detected in the chemical composition of the flux used. *Fencai () meaning 'powdery colours' or 'pale colours' in reference to its pastel shades, is the term most commonly used in Chinese to describe famille rose porcelain. Fencai is the more modern term used by Chen Liu (ÈôàÊµè) in the early 20th century and it is often used in place of yangcai in Chinese. *Ruancai ( / ), 'soft colours') is a term from the Yongzheng era as the colours used are softer in contrast to the 'hard colours' (Á°¨ÂΩ©, yingcai) used to refer to famille verte or wucai. Origin A selection of falangcai porcelains The origin of famille rose is not entirely clear. The pink colour palette was achieved in Europe through the use of purple of Cassius made of colloidal gold and first used on glass. It is generally believe that this use of the new colour palette in China was introduced by Jesuits in China to the Imperial court, initially on enamels used on metal wares such as cloisonn√© produced in the falang or enamel workshop (ÁèêÁêÖ‰Ωú), or through adaptation of enamels used in tin-glazed South German earthenware. The term used by Tang Ying (who oversaw the production of porcelain at Jingdezhen) and in Qing documents was yangcai (\\"foreign colours\\"), indicating its foreign origin or influence. Research, however, has failed to show that the chemical composition of the pink enamel pigment to be the same as that of the European one, although the cobalt blue of the enamel from some famille rose pieces has been determined to be from Europe. The oil used in gold-red Chinese enamel was doermendina oil instead of turpentine oil used in the West. Colloidal gold may have been previously available for use in Jingdezhen to achieve such colours, and gold-red enamel technique from Guangdong was used during the reign of Kangxi. Rudimentary famille rose have been found in Chinese porcelain from the 1720s, although the technique was not fully developed until around 1730 during the Yongzheng period. The pink of the early pieces of the 1720s were darker in colours made with ruby-coloured glass, but after 1725 softer shades were achieved by mixing with white enamels. At the Palace workshops in Beijing, experimentations was conducted under the supervision of Prince Yi to develop a range of enamel colours and techniques for applying the such enamels onto blank porcelain supplied by Jingdezhen. These blank porcelain could not be produced at the Palace due to the polluting nature of the big kilns, and pieces of porcelain decorated at the palace and then fired in muffle kilns are called falangcai. Court painters were employed to make drafts that may include calligraphy and poetry to decorate such wares, which produced a new aesthetic style of decoration on porcelain distinct from those used outside the court. Falangcai decorations may be painted on a white ground, or on a coloured ground with yellow the most popular. As falangcai was produced at the palace for its exclusive use, there are relatively fewer pieces of falangcai porcelain. Production at Jindezhen Some designs became more complex in the Qianlong period. A vase with engraved pattern and openwork medallions, painted with famille rose enamels. Falangcai porcelain was also made at the imperial kilns of Jingdezhen, and the term yangcai was used to refer to famille rose porcelain produced at Jingdezhen initially to imitate falangcai. Experimentations however were also conducted in Jindezhen to achieve the famille rose palette. The famille rose enamels allowed for a greater range of colour and tone than was previously possible, enabling the depiction of more complex images, particularly during the Qianlong era. Decorations became more elaborate and crowded in the later Qianlong period. The images may be painted on coloured grounds, including yellow, blue, pink, coral red, light green, 'cafe au lait' and brown. Black ground or famille noire may also be used on famille rose ware, but they are not highly regarded. Many produced in the Qianlong period were on eggshell porcelain. Famille rose supplanted famille verte in popularity, and its production overtook blue and white porcelain in the mid-18th century. It remained popular throughout the 18th and the 19th centuries and continued to be made in the 20th century. The quality of wares produced however declined after the Qianlong period. Export ware Canton ware with Rose Mandarin decoration A large number of famille rose wares were exported, sometimes as sets of armorial ware specifically ordered by Europeans. Jingdezhen produced many famille rose pieces, and some of the finest pieces were made there. However, from the late 18th century onwards, many pieces were decorated in the port city of Canton to produce the Canton ware intended for export, using white porcelain from Jingdezhen. In contrast to the more refined 'court-taste' porcelain, export wares particularly those from the 19th century tend to be highly decorated. These export ware may be decorated in Western styles or motif with European figures or in Chinese style with Chinese figures, and can come in a wide variety of forms, for example, they may be vessels with animal-shaped covers. A large number of decorative patterns are used in famille rose porcelain, sometimes with decorations requested by the buyers. Some popular types of decorative patterns in these export wares are referred to as Rose Canton, Rose Mandarin and Rose Medallion. Rose Medallion typically has panels or medallion of flowers and/or bird alternating with panels of human figures around a central medallion. Rose Canton contains no human figures, in contrast to Rose Mandarin which shows Chinese figures. Famille rose enamels were known to have been used in Europe before such wares were exported from China, for example in Vienna porcelain made by the Du Paquier factory in 1725. Large number of famille rose porcelains were later exported from China to the West, and many European factories such as Meissen, Chelsea and Chantilly copied the famille rose palette used in Chinese porcelain. Export of Chinese porcelain then declined due to competition from the European factories.

Its story was written by Warren Ellis. Plot Andrew Sterling is a former British SAS soldier working for MI6, who has been captured in the People's Republic of China and jailed in Chang political prison; MI6 destroyed all files on Sterling to prevent an international incident. He is rescued the night before his execution by an old female acquaintance named Kim and a former fellow SAS soldier Daniel Parish. To repay his debt to Parish for saving his life, Andrew agrees to work for his private security agency. Sterling then travels to Egypt to eliminate the leaders of an arms dealing cartel, who possess a missile guidance system called Octopus. He completes his mission, but at the cost of Kim's life. The antagonist is John Grey (voiced by Tom Baker), who as a young man who enlisted in the RAF to defend Britain at the height of World War II. Horrified by nuclear weapons John Grey formed a secret society, \\"Greywings\\" inspired by the heroes of the H. G. Wells novel The Shape of Things to Come. Greywings sought out and destroyed nuclear threats but ultimately came to the conclusion that the only way to abolish nuclear warfare would be to create a nuclear winter leaving the survivors afraid of nuclear warfare. Greywings planned on initiating their plan codenamed Operation: Cold Winter by providing world powers with the Octopus guidance systems. It turns out that Grey hired Parish to liquidate the Egyptian arms ring because they stole an Octopus unit which was intended for world superpowers rather than the third world countries its thieves planned on selling it to. Grey soon after betrays his own organization to save the life of his infant granddaughter. Sterling is sent to Greywing's headquarters in the Himalayan mountains where he destroys the facility's power core and escapes in Parish's helicopter. Grey is then seen in the game's last scene on a bench in Prague where his former subordinates murder him. Gameplay The game uses the Karma Physics engine, allowing for interactivity with items in the game world and for ragdoll effects. Cover can also be improvised by using objects in the environment; for example, the player can flip a table to provide cover or grab a table and block a door. Over 30 weapons are available. The game offers a multiplayer component that supports up to four players offline and eight players online; in the offline mode, human players may be substituted for CPU-controlled. There are a dozen maps and six modes, including deathmatch and king of the hill. Reception The game received \\"average\\" reviews according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. It was one of the five games nominated by GameSpot for the title of Best Story of 2005, with a comment: \\"A poignant, well-told story penned by Warren Ellis helps make Cold Winter a more engaging experience than your average first- person shooter.\\" The website considered the game to be sonically and graphically average, but an enjoyable straightforward shooter with a decent online mode. Whilst not the best game of its type it was \\"definitely worth playing\\".

Armorials have been popular on European pottery from the Middle Ages with examples seen on Spanish Hispano-Moresque ware, Italian maiolica, slipware, English and Dutch Delft, and on porcelain from the 18th century. Earlier examples were mostly large pieces such as jugs or basins and ewers, but later whole table services, all painted with the arms, were produced. Silver tableware also often had coats of arms engraved on it, but as porcelain replaced metal as the favoured material for elite tableware in the 18th century, armorial porcelain became very popular. When overglaze decoration was used, the pottery could produce the glazed ware without the arms, which were then added when a commission was received. Replica White House china with the arms of the United States The term is most often associated, with Chinese export porcelain, often decorated with the arms and crests of European and American families from the late 17th century through the 19th century. A painting of the arms was sent out to China, and after a considerable period the painted service arrived. British clients imported about 4000 services from 1695 until 1820, when a new prohibitive tax stopped the trade, as the British government sought to protect the domestic potteries. They were, and even more are, often only used at table on special occasions. They are popular with collectors. 17th-century Dutch armorial plates are called \\"wapenborden\\" and were commonly sold with recurring emblems that cannot be traced to any specific family.

Al-Duleimi represented Saddam, and told the head of the legal team, Jordan-based lawyer Ziad al- Khasawneh, that Saddam had answered the tribunal with \\"confidence and serenity\\". Al-Duleimi has spent significant time in hiding since his meeting with Saddam, as he received numerous death threats, including a message to his home warning that suicide cells had been formed specifically to kill him as an example to all other attorneys who had volunteered for Saddam's defense team. In May 2005, upon release of photos showing Saddam sleeping and washing his trousers, by an anonymous US Army officer, al-Duleimi made comments critical of the United States Army, but did not comment on a possible lawsuit proposed by al-Khasawneh. On August 8, 2005, Saddam's family dissolved the remainder of the legal team and appointed al-Duleimi as sole legal counsel.

It is associated in particular with the work of French philosopher Louis Althusser.(Verso: 1970, p.11) According to Althusser, every society is made up of ideological state apparatuses (ISAs) and repressive state apparatuses (RSAs) which are instrumental to constant reproduction of the relations to production of that given society. While ISAs belong to the private domain and refer to private institutions (family, church but also the media and politics), the RSA is one public institution (police/military) controlled by the government. Consequently, 'interpellation' describes the process by which ideology, embodied in major social and political institutions (ISAs and RSAs), constitutes the very nature of individual subjects' identities through the process of \\"hailing\\" them in social interactions. Althusser's thought has made significant contributions to other French philosophers, notably Derrida, Kristeva, Barthes, Foucault, Deleuze, and Badiou.  Overview  In \\"Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses (Notes Towards an Investigation)\\", Althusser introduces the concepts of ideological state apparatuses (ISA), repressive state apparatuses (RSAs), ideology, and interpellation. In his writing, Althusser argues that \\"there is no ideology except by the subject and for the subject\\". This notion of subjectivity becomes central to his writings. To illustrate this concept, Althusser gives the example of a friend who knocks on a door. The person inside asks \\"Who is there?\\" and only opens the door once the \\"It's me\\" from the outside sounds familiar. By doing so, the person inside partakes in \\"a material ritual practice of ideological recognition in everyday life\\". In other words, Althusser's central thesis is that \\"you and I are always already subjects\\" and are constantly engaging in everyday rituals, like greeting someone or shaking hands, which makes us subjected to ideology. Althusser goes further to argue that \\"all ideology hails or interpellates concrete individuals as concrete subjects\\" and emphasizes that \\"ideology 'acts' or 'functions' in such a way that it ... 'transforms' the individual into subjects\\". This is made possible through Althusser's notion of interpellation or hailing which is a non- specific and unconscious process. For example, when a police officer shouts (or hails) \\"Hey, you there!\\" and an individual turns around and so-to-speak 'answers' the call, he becomes a subject. Althusser argues that this is because the individual has realized that the hailing was addressed at him which makes him subjective to the ideology of democracy and law. Consequently, individual subjects are presented principally as produced by social forces, rather than acting as powerful independent agents with self-produced identities. Althusser's argument here strongly draws from Jacques Lacan's concept of the mirror stage. However, unlike Lacan who distinguishes between the \\"I\\" (i.e., the conscious ego which is created by the mirror stage) and the \\"subject\\" (that is, the symbolic subject of the unconscious), Althusser collapses both concepts into one.  Other applications  German philosophers Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer employ a method of analysis similar to Althusser's notion of interpellation in their text Dialectic of Enlightenment, although they do so 26 years before \\"Ideology and Ideological State Apparatuses\\" was released. Rather than situating their analysis heavily on the State, Adorno and Horkheimer argue that the mass media ‚Äì the \\"culture industry\\" ‚Äì also plays a role in the construction of passive subjects. So unlike the police officer in Althusser's example who reinforces the ideology of democracy and law, the mass media now plays a powerful complementary role in the creation of a passive consumer. However, whereas Althusser sought to make subjectivity a mere epiphenomenon of institutional interpellation, Adorno and Horkheimer insisted on a concept of subjectivity was not limited to institutional definition. They sought to expose tendencies favoring \\"total administration\\" over the individual and their subjective potential, while Althusser's analysis seemed only to confirm those tendencies. Feminist scholar and queer theorist Judith Butler has critically applied a framework based on interpellation to highlight the social construction of gender identities. She argues that by hailing \\"It's a boy/girl,\\" the newborn baby is ultimately positioned as subject. Media theorist David Gauntlett argues that \\"interpellation occurs when a person connects with a media text: when we enjoy a magazine or TV show, for example, this uncritical consumption means that the text has interpellated us into a certain set of assumptions, and caused us to tacitly accept a particular approach to the world.\\"David Gauntlett.

Politics and espionage played their roles. For American operations see Intelligence in the American Revolutionary War.  Political action = France  While intelligence committees of the Continental Congress were meeting in Philadelphia, Arthur Lee was meeting in London with Pierre-Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais, the successful author of Le Barbier de S√©ville who was a French agent.Harlow Giles Unger, Improbable Patriot: The Secret History of Monsieur de Beaumarchais, the French Playwright Who Saved the American Revolution (2011). Lee's inflated reports of patriot strength, which either he fabricated for Beaumarchais' benefit or were provided by Lee's regular correspondent, Samuel Adams, won the Frenchman to the American cause. Beaumarchais repeatedly urged the French Court to give immediate assistance to the Americans, and on February 29, 1776, addressed a memorial to Louis XVI quoting Lee's offer of a secret long-term treaty of commerce in exchange for secret aid to the war of independence. Beaumarchais explained that France could grant such aid without compromising itself, but urged that \\"success of the plan depends wholly upon rapidity as well as secrecy: Your Majesty knows better than any one that secrecy is the soul of business, and that in politics a project once disclosed is a project doomed to failure.\\" With the memorial, Beaumarchais submitted a plan proposing that he set up a commercial trading firm as a cover for the secret aid; he requested and was granted one million livres to establish a firm called Roderigue Hortalez et Cie for that purpose. Beaumarchais' memorial was followed by one of March 12, 1776, by the French Minister of Foreign Affairs, the Comte de Vergennes. Royal assent was granted, and by the time Silas Deane arrived in Paris, French arms and other aid was on its way to the revolutionaries. Deane expanded the relationship, working with Beaumarchais and other French merchants to procure ships, commission privateers, recruit French officers, and purchase French military supplies declared \\"surplus\\" for that purpose. On September 26, 1776, the Congress elected three commissioners to the Court of France‚ÄîBenjamin Franklin, Thomas Jefferson and Silas Deane‚Äîresolving that \\"secrecy shall be observed until further Order of Congress; and that until permission be obtained from Congress to disclose the particulars of this business, no member be permitted to say anything more upon this subject, than that Congress have taken such steps as they judged necessary for the purpose of obtaining foreign alliance.\\" Because of his wife's illness, Jefferson could not serve, and Arthur Lee was appointed in his stead. With Franklin's arrival in France on November 29, 1776‚Äîthe first anniversary of the founding of the Committee of Secret Correspondence‚Äîthe French mission became an intelligence and propaganda center for Europe, an unofficial diplomatic representation, a coordinating facility for aid from America's secret allies, and a recruiting station for such French officers as Lafayette and Johann de Kalb. In October 1777 the Continental Army won a crucial victory over the British at Saratoga, and on February 6, 1778, the French-American treaty of alliance was signed. On March 30, 1778, Franklin, Lee, and Deane were received at the French Court as representatives of the United States of America, and on July 7 Comte d'Estaing's fleet cast anchor in the Delaware River. France was now in the war; the mission to Paris had succeeded.Stacy Schiff, A Great Improvisation: Franklin, France, and the Birth of America (2005)  Spain and its colonies  Spain, at the urging of Vergennes, matched France's one million livres for the operation of Hortalez et Cie. But that was not the beginning of secret Spanish aid. During the summer of 1776 Luis de Unzaga y Amezaga, the governor of New Spain at New Orleans, had privately delivered five tons of gunpowder, out of the King's stores, to Captain George Gibson and Lieutenant Linn of the Virginia Council of Defense. The gunpowder moved up the Mississippi River under the protection of the flag of Spain and was used to thwart British plans to capture Fort Pitt. Oliver Pollock, a New Orleans businessman, had interceded on behalf of the Virginians. When Bernardo de Galvez became governor of New Orleans, Pollock‚Äîwho was soon appointed an agent of the Secret Committee there‚Äîworked closely with the young officer to provide additional supplies to the Americans. Galvez also agreed to grant protection to American ships while seizing British ships as smugglers, and to allow American privateers to sell their seized wares at New Orleans. Havana, too, became a focal point for dispensing secret Spanish aid to the Americans. From Galvez the revolutionaries received gunpowder and supplies for the George Rogers Clark expedition, and from Galvez' secret service fund came the funds used by Colonel Clark for the capture of Kaskaskia and Vincennes. When Spain formally entered the war on the American side on June 21, 1779, Oliver Pollock‚Äîwho suffered bankruptcy in funding the purchase of supplies for the cause of independence‚Äîrode as aide-de-camp to Galvez in the capture of Baton Rouge, Natchez, Mobile, and Pensacola.Thomas E. Ch√°vez, Spain and the Independence of the United States (2002).  The Caribbean  Another center of secret aid was St. Eustatia Island in the West Indies. A Dutch free port set in the midst of English, French, Danish and Spanish colonies, St. Eustatia (now Sint Eustatius) became‚Äîin the words of a British intelligence document of the period‚Äî\\"the rendezvous of everything and everybody meant to be clandestinely conveyed to America.\\" It was a major source of gunpowder for the American cause, and perhaps the safest and quickest means of communications between American representatives and agents abroad and with the Congress and others at home.J. Franklin Jameson, \\"St. Eustatius in the American Revolution.\\" American Historical Review (1903) 8#4: 683-708. online freeAndrew Jackson O'Shaughnessy, An empire divided: the American Revolution and the British Caribbean (2000).  Covert action = Bermuda  In July 1775 Benjamin Franklin and Robert Morris worked out a plan in collaboration with Colonel Henry Tucker, the head of a distinguished Bermuda family, to obtain the store of gunpowder in the Royal Naval Dockyard, Bermuda. To give Bermuda much-needed food in exchange for the powder, Congress resolved on July 15, 1775 to permit the exchange of food for guns and gunpowder brought by any vessel to an American port. On the night of August 14, 1775, two American ships kept a rendezvous with Colonel Tucker's men off the coast of Bermuda, and sent a raiding party ashore. An American sailor was lowered into the arsenal through an opening in the roof, and opened the doors. The barrels of gunpowder were rolled to waiting Bermudian whaleboats and transported to the American ships. Twelve days later half of the powder was delivered to Philadelphia and half to American forces at Charleston. America's second covert action effort ended in failure. General Washington, hearing independently of the Bermuda powder, dispatched ships to purchase or seize it. Lacking a centralized intelligence authority, he was unaware of the previous success; when Washington's ships arrived in Bermuda in October 1775, the gunpowder had been gone for two months and British ships patrolled Bermuda waters.Wilfred Brenton Kerr, Bermuda and the American revolution: 1760-1783 (1936).  Canada  On the basis of information received by the Secret Correspondence Committee, on February 15, 1776, Congress authorized a covert action plan to urge the Canadians to become a \\"sister colony\\" in the struggle against the British. A French printer was dispatched to Canada \\"to establish a free press... for the frequent publication of such pieces as may be of service to the cause of the United Colonies.\\" Benjamin Franklin, Samuel Chase, and Charles Carroll were appointed from the Congress to undertake the mission, and Father John Carroll was invited to join the team to prevail upon the Catholic clergy of Canada. The delegation was given a degree of authority over American expeditionary forces in Canada; it was empowered to raise six companies in Canada, and to offer sanctuary in the thirteen colonies \\"for all those who have adhered to us.\\" Excesses against the Canadian populace by the American military forces, the hostility of the clergy, and the inability of American commissioners to deliver little more than promises in exchange for Canadian defection, doomed the project. With the arrival of summer, both military and political action in Canada had ended in failure.  Foreign intelligence  The first intelligence agent enlisted by the Secret Correspondence Committee was Arthur Lee, then living in London. On November 30, 1775, the day after its founding, the Committee appointed Dr. Lee as its agent in England and told him that \\"it is considered of utmost consequence to the cause of liberty that the Committee be kept informed of developments in Europe.\\" Following the first Congressional appropriation for the work of the Committee on December 11, 1775, two hundred pounds was forwarded to Lee with the urging that he find out the \\"disposition of foreign powers towards us, and the admonition that we need not hint that great circumspection and impenetrable security are necessary.\\" The next agent recruited abroad by the Committee was Charles W. F. Dumas, a Swiss journalist at The Hague. Dumas was briefed personally by Thomas Story, a courier of the Committee, and instructed on the use of cover names and letter drops to be used for his reports to the Committee and for communication with Dr. Lee in London. He also planted stories in a Dutch newspaper, Gazette de Leide, intended to give the United States a favorable rating in Dutch credit markets. On March 1, 1776, the Committee appointed Silas Deane, a former delegate to Congress and future ambassador to France, as its agent there. He was instructed to pose as a Bermudian merchant dealing in Indian goods. He was also charged with making secret purchases and with attempting to gain secret assistance from the French crown. Later, both Deane and Lee would be converted from agents to commissioners to the French Crown, albeit secret ones, until the open and formal alliance of France with the Americans. Other agents of the Committee included William Bingham, who served first in France and then in Martinique, where he had once been British Consul; Major Jonathan Loring Austin, William Carmichael, and William Hodge.  Special operations = Kidnapping  For a review of many episodes see Christian McBurney, Abductions in the American Revolution: Attempts to Kidnap George Washington, Benedict Arnold and Other Military and Civilian Leaders (2016) = Benedict Arnold = After Benedict Arnold defected, several special operations, none successful, were mounted in an effort to capture him. In September 1780 Major Henry \\"Light-Horse Harry\\" Lee presented to Washington a plan to return the defector to American control and execute him. Washington approved the plan, but insisted that Arnold not be killed or injured in carrying it out, even at the risk of allowing him to escape. \\"Public punishment,\\" said Washington, \\"is the sole object in view.\\" Lee's sergeant major, John Champe of Loudoun County, Virginia, was assigned to this special mission, and on the evening of October 19, 1780, \\"deserted\\" to the British under a hail of gunfire. The official documents he carried and his cooperative attitude during interrogation convinced the British he was a genuine deserter. He was appointed sergeant major of Benedict Arnold's American Legion (No relation to the modern American Legion), which was composed of rebel deserters and Loyalists. Champe, now wearing a British uniform and having obtained freedom of movement in British- occupied New York City, made contact with American agents there and laid plans for Arnold's capture. Arnold's legion embarked for Virginia on the night the operation was to take place, and the plan was aborted. Champe accomplished his other mission, namely finding out if other American officers were collaborating with the enemy. He found no evidence that any were. Christian McBurney, Abductions in the American Revolution: Attempts to Kidnap George Washington, Benedict Arnold and Other Military and Civilian Leaders (2016) pp 96-103. In March 1781 an attempt to capture Arnold during his daily ride to the Virginia shore of the Chesapeake Bay was foiled by the chance anchoring of some British ships in the area. Yet another plan, devised by Thomas Jefferson, called for General John Peter Muhlenberg to send hand-picked soldiers \\"to seize and bring off this greatest of traitors\\" at Portsmouth, Virginia. Unusual security precautions at the British outpost thwarted the attempt. = Hostage taking = Recognizing the value of a royal hostage, Washington approved in 1782 a plan to capture the son of King George III, The Prince William (the future king, William IV), during the young naval officer's posting to New York. The operation failed after British intelligence heard about it and the Prince increased security around himself. After William later became monarch, the American ambassador told him of the wartime plan and of Washington's edict that, if the mission were successful, the young Prince should suffer no \\"insult or indignity.\\" Upon hearing the story, William IV responded: \\"I am obliged to General Washington for his humanity, but I'm damned glad I did not give him an opportunity of exercising it towards me.\\" McBurney, Abductions in the American Revolution (2016) pp 157-66  Privateering  On the high seas, British supply ships and troop ships often fell to American privateers operating under letters of marque and reprisal from the Continental Congress. Franklin, for example, ran a flotilla of Irish and French privateers from the American mission in Paris. Success in intercepting British vessels was so great that the British accused their captains of taking bribes from the Americans to surrender their ships. One privateer, operating under contract to Silas Deane and a French business associate and utilizing a French ship obtained by Benjamin Franklin, was the Bonhomme Richard, commanded by John Paul Jones.  Sabotage  Only one sabotage mission is known to have been launched in England. Sometime after his arrival in Paris, Silas Deane was visited by a young man named James Aitken, recently returned from America. Aitken produced crudely drawn but accurate plans of the Royal Navy Dockyards in England and proposed to sabotage them by utilizing a unique incendiary device of his own design. Deane engaged his services and issued Aitken a passport signed by French Foreign Minister Vergennes with instructions to French officials: \\"We will and command you very expressly to let pass safely and freely, Mr. James Actzen, going to England, without giving him or suffering him any hindrance; but on the contrary giving every aid and assistance that he shall want or occasion for.\\" In late November 1776 Aitken landed at Dover and, on December 7, he ignited a fire at the Portsmouth dockyard that burned from late in the afternoon until the following morning, destroying twenty tons of hemp, ten one-hundred-fathom (183 m) cables, and six tons of ship cordage. After failing to penetrate the security at Plymouth, Aitken proceeded to Bristol, where he destroyed two warehouses and several houses. On January 16, 1777, the British cabinet met in emergency session and urged immediate measures to locate the mysterious \\"John the Painter\\" (Aitken was a house painter). Guards were augmented at all military facilities and arsenals, and a reward was posted. By January 20 the cabinet, again in extraordinary session, discussed suspending habeas corpus and placing the country under martial law. Five days later the reward was increased to one thousand pounds, and newspapers reported panic throughout England. Aitken was soon apprehended, with a pistol and inflammables in his possession. He would not admit to the sabotage when interrogated, but eventually confided in a friendly American visitor who was secretly in the pay of the British. Based on these confidences, personal effects, including the passport from Vergennes, were located. His trial was speedy, and on March 10, 1777, Aitken went to the gallows at Portsmouth Dockyard, where his exploits had begun. His actions may have resulted in \\"arson in the Royal dockyards in the time of war\\" being added to the list of capital crimes in England, which was one of the last to be repealed.  Counterintelligence  Probably the first organization under the Articles of Confederation created for counterintelligence purposes was the Committee for Detecting and Defeating Conspiracies, later the Commission. It was made up of a series of groups established in New York between June 1776 and January 1778 to collect intelligence, apprehend British spies and couriers, and examine suspected British sympathizers. In effect, it was created as a \\"secret service\\" which had the power to arrest, to convict, to grant bail or parole, and to imprison or to deport. A company of militia was placed under its command. The Committee heard over 500 cases involving disloyalty and subversion. John Jay has been called the first chief of American counterintelligence because of his role in the Committee. William Duer,Duer is sometimes called \\"Colonel\\" Duer but he in fact decline a militia commission, apparently because he feared the British would confiscate property held jointly by him and his brother in Dominica. Jones, Robert Francis. \\"The King of the Alley\\": William Duer, Politician, Entrepreneur, and Speculator, 1768-1799. Philadelphia: American Philosophical Society, 1992. . p. 11. a New York planter and politician, and Nathaniel Sackett, an agent suggested by Duer to George Washington, were particularly successful in ferreting out British agents, but found their greatest success in the missions of one of the dozen or so agents of their own, Enoch Crosby. Crosby, a veteran of the Continental Army, had been mistaken by a Westchester County Loyalist as being someone who shared his views. He confided to Crosby that a secret enemy military company was being formed and introduced him to the group. Crosby reported the plot to the Committee and was taken with the group. He managed to \\"escape\\" and, as directed, infiltrated another secret Tory unit. This unit, including Crosby, was also taken and escaped once more. He repeated the operation at least two more times, before the loyalists started to get wise to his \\"escaping\\" and he retired. Crosby was the model for the central character in James Fenimore Cooper's book The Spy (1821), the first espionage novel written in English. Another successful American agent was Captain David Gray of Massachusetts. Posing as a deserter, Gray entered the service of Colonel Beverly Robinson, a Tory intelligence officer, and became Robinson's courier. As a result, the contents of each of Robinson's dispatches were read by the Americans before their delivery. Gray eventually became the courier for Major Oliver DeLancey, Jr., the head of the British secret service in New York. For two years, Gray, as DeLancey's courier to Canada, successfully penetrated the principal communications link of the British secret service. Upon completing his assignment, Gray returned to the ranks of the Continental Army and his name was struck from the deserter list, where it had been placed at the beginning of the operation. Major Benjamin Tallmadge, a senior intelligence officer under Washington, played a key role in the capture of Major John Andr√©, who preceded DeLancey as chief of the British secret service in New York. Although he declined to discuss the episode in his memoirs, it is said that one of Tallmadge's agents had reported to him that Major Andr√© was in contact with a \\"John Anderson\\" who was expecting the surrender of a major installation. Learning that a certain John Anderson had been captured by three Militiamen, Tallmadge hurried to the post where Andr√© was being held. John Paulding, Isaac Van Wert and David Williams had been on sentry trying to catch loyalist \\"Cow- Boys\\" that had been preying on people in Westchester County, New York. Andr√© mistakenly assumed that the men were aligned with the British and declared himself to be a British officer. Then upon realizing the mistake tried to use a pass provided by Arnold. They searched Andr√© and found papers hidden in his socks. Paulding understood the papers revealed \\"Anderson\\" to be a spy, and stated that no amount of money would be enough to let Andr√© go. As Tallmadge arrived to the post, he found that the acting Post Commander had sent Andr√©, under guard, back to General Arnold. After extensive and animated lobbying by Tallmadge, the commander, Jamieson, ordered that \\"Anderson\\" be returned for interrogation. \\"Anderson\\" admitted to his true identity (that he was Andr√©) and was tried, convicted, and executed as a spy. Arnold, learning that Andr√© had been taken and that his own treachery was no doubt was exposed, fled West Point before he could be captured, and joined the British forces. General Washington demanded effective counterintelligence work from his subordinates. On March 24, 1776, for example, he wrote: \\"There is one evil I dread, and that is, their spies. I could wish, therefore, the most attentive watch be kept... I wish a dozen or more of honest, sensible and diligent men, were employed... in order to question, cross-question etc., all such persons as are unknown, and cannot give an account of themselves in a straight and satisfactory line.... I think it a matter of importance to prevent them from obtaining intelligence of our situation.\\" Washington occasionally had to deal with rogue intelligence officers in his own ranks who used their positions for personal gain or undertook unauthorized or illegal operations that might have compromised parts of his intelligence apparatus. Once Washington discovered that two of his agents who supposedly were collecting intelligence on Long Island actually were \\"mere plundering parties.\\" He set up a special team to investigate and arrest the renegade operatives.  Deception operations  To offset British superiority in firepower and number of troops, General Washington made frequent use of deception and disinformation. He allowed fabricated documents to fall into the hands of enemy agents or be discussed in their presence. He allowed couriers carrying bogus information to be \\"captured\\" by the British, and inserted forged documents in intercepted British communications that were then permitted to continue on to their destination. He had army procurement officers make false purchases of large quantities of supplies in places picked to convince the British that a sizable rebel force was massing. Washington even had fake military facilities built. In all this he managed to make the British believe that his three-thousand-man army outside Philadelphia was forty thousand strong. After learning from the Culper Ring that the British planned to attack a French expedition that had just landed in Newport, Rhode Island, Washington planted information with known British agents indicating that he intended to move against New York City. The British commander held back the troops headed for Rhode Island. With elaborate deception, Washington masked his movement toward Chesapeake Bay and Yorktown by convincing the British that he was moving on New York. At Yorktown, James Armistead, a slave who had joined Lafayette's service with his master's permission, crossed into Cornwallis' lines in the guise of an escaped slave, and was recruited by Cornwallis to return to American lines as a spy. Lafayette gave him a fabricated order that was destined for a large number of nonexistent replacements. Armistead delivered the bogus order in crumpled, dirty condition to Cornwallis, claiming to have found it along the road during his mission. Cornwallis believed him and did not learn he had been tricked until after his surrender. Armistead was granted his freedom by the Virginia General Assembly as a result of this and other wartime service. Another deception operation at Yorktown found Charles Morgan entering Cornwallis' camp as a deserter. When debriefed by the British, he convinced them that Lafayette had sufficient boats to move all his troops against the British in one landing operation. Cornwallis was duped by him and dug in rather than marched out of Yorktown. Morgan, in turn, escaped in a British uniform and returned to the American lines with five British deserters and a prisoner.  Propaganda  Upon receiving accurate intelligence that the British were hiring Hessian mercenaries for service in America, Congress appointed a three-man committee \\"to devise a plan for encouraging the Hessions and other foreigners... to quit that iniquitous service.\\" The result was a resolution, believed to have been drafted by Thomas Jefferson, offering land grants to German deserters. It was translated into German and sent among the Hessians. Benjamin Franklin, who joined the committee to implement the operation, arranged for the leaflets to be disguised as tobacco packets to make sure they would fall into the hands of ordinary Hessian soldiers. Christopher Ludwick was dispatched by Washington into the enemy camp, posing as a deserter, to contact the Hessians and encourage them to defect. He is credited with the defection of \\"many hundred soldiers\\" from the German ranks. In 1777, after his arrival in France, Benjamin Franklin fabricated a letter purportedly sent by a German prince to the commander of his mercenaries in America. The letter disputed British casualty figures for the German troops, arguing that the actual number was much higher and that he was entitled to a great amount of \\"blood money\\", the amount paid to the prince for each of his men killed or wounded. The prince also encouraged the officer to be humane and to allow his wounded to die, rather than try to save men who might only become cripples unfit for service to their prince. Between 5,000 and 6,000 Hessians deserted from the British side during the war, in part because of American propaganda. Franklin also produced a newspaper report purporting to describe the transmittal of scalps of soldiers, settlers, women and children to the Royal Governor of Canada by Britain's Indian allies. The Indian transmittal letter indicated that a certain mark on scalps indicated they were those of women who \\"were knocked dead or had their brains beat out.\\" :This article is adapted from _Intelligence in the War of Independence_ , a publication of the Central Intelligence Agency in the public domain.

Fort Cornwallis is the largest standing fort in Malaysia. The fort never engaged in combat during its operational history. It was named after the then Lieutenant-General The 2nd Earl Cornwallis (1738-1805), the Governor-General of Bengal at the time of the fort's construction, who had also been involved in the American War of Independence, surrendering his army to George Washington at Yorktown in 1781. Lord Cornwallis was later created, in 1792, The 1st Marquess Cornwallis, and he was promoted to being a full-ranking General in the British Army in 1793. Lord Cornwallis later served, from 1798 to 1801, as the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, where he overseen the implementation of the Act of Union. History left left Captain Francis Light, R.N., took possession of Penang Island from the Sultan of Kedah in 1786 and built the original fort. It was a nibong (a Malay term meaning 'palm trunk') stockade with no permanent structures, covering an area of . The fort's purpose was to protect Penang from pirates and Kedah. Captain Light, who died in 1794, renamed Penang Island as Prince of Wales Island in 1786. In 1804, after the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars, and during Colonel R.T. Farquhar's term as Governor of Prince of Wales Island (also known as Penang Island), Indian convict labourers rebuilt the fort using brick and stone. Fort Cornwallis was completed in 1810, at the cost of $80,000, during Norman Macalister‚Äôs term as Governor of Penang. A moat 9 metres wide by 2 metres deep once surrounded the fort but it was filled in the 1920s due to a malaria outbreak in the area. Even though the fort was originally built for the British military, its function, historically, was more administrative than defensive. For example, the judge of the Supreme Court of Penang, Sir Edmond Stanley, an Anglo-Irish barrister, was first housed at Fort Cornwallis when the court opened on 31 May 1808. During the 1920s Sikh police of the Straits Settlements occupied the fort. Royal Navy personnel under the direction of Rev. Peter Brown conducted an archaeological survey in July/August 1970. The fort was gazetted on 8 September 1977, under the Antiquities Act 168/1976, as an Ancient Monument and Historic site. Today, it has become one of Penang's prime tourist attractions. Architecture The Chapel at Fort Cornwallis was built in 1799. The first recorded marriage here took place that same year when John Timmers married Martina Rozells, Light's widow. The building in the southwest bastion is almost certainly not the chapel, but the main magazine; the massive roof and the surrounding buttresses are typical of magazine buildings of the period. The building is the earliest roofed structure surviving in Penang from the colonial era. Old cannons decorate the fort. The largest, known as Seri Rambai, was cast in 1603; in 1606 the Dutch East India Company gave it to the Sultan of Johore. In 1613, the Acehnese took possession of Seri Rambai and carried it to Aceh. In 1795, the Achenese gave it to Kuala Selangor. The British seized Seri Rambai in 1871 as booty after a punitive raid on Kuala Selangor, and took the cannon to Penang. The government moved it to the fort in the 1950s. A skeletal steel lighthouse was erected in the northeast corner of the fort in 1882. It is the second oldest lighthouse in Malaysia, after the Cape Rachado Lighthouse at Tanjung Tuan, Malacca. Originally named Fort Point Lighthouse, it was renamed Penang Harbour Lighthouse after renovation in 1914 and 1925. The State Tourism Development Committee chairman claimed in 2006 that it was the only lighthouse in Malaysia that resembles a ship's mast, and the only one in Peninsular Malaysia not serving any navigational purpose.A beacon for visitors - Story  The Star Online File:Fort Cornwallis Penang Dec 2006 005.jpgEntrance drawbridge of Fort Cornwallis.

Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. pp.14‚Äì15Note: His date of birth still remains unknown. Though his tombstone says 1821, there is enough evidence to suggest that his birth year was 1820 (see: Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention by Burger, Peter) ‚Äì 10 June 1892), was a Canadian inventor who invented the wood pulp process for papermaking, which was first adapted into the production of newsprint. Fenerty was also a poet (writing over 32 known poems).Burger, Peter. Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. pp.89-169 Early life Fenerty was born in Upper Falmouth, Nova Scotia. He was the youngest of three boys, all of whom worked for their father, a lumberman and farmer. During the winter months, the Fenertys would clear-cut the local forests for lumber, which they then transported to the family's lumber mill at Springfield Lake. The Fenertys shipped their lumber to the Halifax dockyards, where it was exported or used locally.Burger, Peter. Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. pp.8‚Äì9. The Fenertys had around of farmland; they shipped most of their produce to the markets in Halifax. As a young man, Fenerty began writing poetry; his first (known) poem, written when he was 17 years old, was titled \\"The Prince's Lodge\\" (later retitled as \\"Passing Away\\" and published in 1888). It described an abandoned, decaying home overlooking the Bedford Basin near Halifax. The lodge had been built decades prior by Prince Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, who later returned to England.Burger, Peter. Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. pp.11‚Äì13 Invention of paper from wood pulp Each time Fenerty hauled lumber and produce to Halifax, he would pass the local paper mills, and sometimes stopped by to watch the process, since there were many similarities between lumber and paper mills. In those days paper was made from pulped rags, cotton and other plant fibres, a technique used for nearly 2000 years (see History of paper). Demand for paper was outstripping the supply of rags, and Europe starting cutting down their shipments of cotton to North America. Fenerty had learned that trees have fibres too, through discussions with the naturalist Titus Smith.Burger, Peter. Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. At the age of 17 (in c.1838) he began his experiments of making paper from wood. By 1844, he had perfected the process (including bleaching the pulp to a white colour). In a letter written by a family member circa 1915 it is mentioned that Charles Fenerty had shown a crude sample of his paper to a friend named Charles Hamilton in 1840 (a relative of his future wife), though the family member in question would have been around 8 at the time.http://www.charlesfenerty.ca/book_folder/BURGER%20-%20Charles%20Fenerty%209780978331818.pdf On 26 October 1844 Charles Fenerty took a sample of his paper to Halifax's top newspaper, the Acadian Recorder, where he had written a letter on his newly invented paper saying: Other inventors had used wood to make paper; in the 18th century a French scientist by the name of Ren√© Antoine Ferchault de R√©aumur suggested that paper could be made from trees.Burger, Peter. Andrew Leitch and his Paper Invention. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. pp.30‚Äì33 His theory caught the interest of Matthias Koops, who in 1800 experimented with papermaking by compressing and adhering straw and wood shavings.Burger, Peter. Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. pp.30‚Äì32 The F. G. Keller wood-grinding machine c.1854. In about 1838 German weaver Friedrich Gottlob Keller read R√©aumur's report. Unaware of Fenerty across the ocean, he experimented for a few years and, in 1845, a year after Fenerty's letter to the newspaper, filed for a patent in Germany for the ground wood pulp process for making modern paper. In that same year Henry Voelter bought the patent for about five hundred dollars and started making paper. His venture wasn't financially successful, and he later was unable to afford to renew his patent. Voelter has been credited in Germany as the first to make paper from wood pulp. Poetry and travel Fenerty was also a well-known poet of his time, publishing more than 35 (known) poems. Some of the better known titles were: \\"Betula Nigra\\" (about a Black Birch tree), \\"Essay on Progress\\" (published in 1866), and \\"The Prince's Lodge\\" (about Prince Edward Augustus, Duke of Kent and Strathearn, written around 1838 and published in 1888). In October 1854, he won first prize for \\"Betula Nigra\\" at the Nova Scotia Industrial Exhibition.Burger, Peter. Charles Fenerty and his Paper Invention. Toronto: Peter Burger, 2007. pp.40‚Äì45 Nova Scotia Industrial Exhibition of 1854 Fenerty did extensive travelling throughout Australia between the years 1858 to 1865, living through the Australian gold rushes, and then returned to Halifax. He became involved with the Church and held several positions in Halifax: Wood Measurer, Census Taker, Health Warden, Tax Collector for his community, and Overseer of the Poor. Charles Fenerty Monument Death and legacy Little attention was given to Fenerty's invention, and he himself never developed his process or took out a patent on it. It did mark the beginning to a new industry; today most people attribute F. G. Keller as the original inventor. Pulped wood paper slowly began to be adopted by paper mills. German newspapers were the first to adopt the new paper, then other newspapers made the switch from rags to wood pulp. Soon there were mills throughout Canada, the U.S., and Europe, and later the rest of the world. A wood pulp paper mill was erected near Fenerty's home town. By the end of the 19th century almost all newspapers in the western world were using pulp wood newsprint. Fenerty died on 10 June 1892 in his home in Lower Sackville, Nova Scotia, from a flu.\\"Charles Fenerty\\" The Canadian Encyclopedia Passing Away (aka, The Prince's Lodge), c.1838, by Charles Fenerty (which appeared in the Rockingham Sentinel (Halifax, NS), March 1888).

While most current authorities maintain the view that A. brevirostris is the correct name for the white- chested emerald, it has recently been suggested that this is incorrect, in which case its scientific name would revert to A. chionopectus. It is a widespread and common species in Trinidad, less so in Venezuela. It appears to be a local or seasonal migrant, although its movements are not well understood. It is a bird of cultivation, woodland and forest. The female lays her eggs in a small cup nest made of plant fibre and placed on a horizontal tree branch. The white-chested emerald is approximately 9 cm long and weighs 4.7 g. The black bill is straight and fairly long, at nearly 2 cm. It has bright golden-green upperparts, becoming bronze on the tail, white underparts, and its flanks are green, or white spotted with green. The tail is tipped with purple-black. The sexes are similar. White-chested emeralds feed on nectar, usually taken from the flowers of large trees, but sometimes from smaller plants such as Heliconia. They also take small insects.

She appeared in 69 episodes (68 of Law & Order, and the Homicide: Life on the Street episode \\"For God and Country\\"). Character overview Kincaid is introduced in the episode \\"Sweeps\\" as an Assistant District Attorney in the Manhattan DA's office. She is portrayed as an idealistic, outspoken feminist and agnostic who becomes increasingly disillusioned with her job. She is vocally pro-choice, opposes the death penalty, and has ambivalent feelings about drug prohibition. These political views often come into conflict with the realities of the legal system. She graduated from Harvard Law School, where her stepfather Mac Geller (Len Cariou) had been one of her professors. It is suggested throughout the fifth and sixth season that Kincaid and Executive ADA Jack McCoy (Sam Waterston) have a sexual relationship. However, it is not explicitly stated until season 9, long after the character had exited the show. Notable episodes During her first season on the show, she is paired with Executive ADA Ben Stone (Michael Moriarty). During the prosecution of a rape case, he threatens to fire her after she fails to share key information she learned while interviewing a witness, which subsequently comes out in trial, jeopardizing the case. Stone eventually relents and refuses to accept her resignation, relating to her because of a key mistake he made early in his career. In another case, Kincaid temporarily resigns after it is revealed she and a judge that the DA's office is prosecuting were once lovers, possibly jeopardizing the case against him. After Stone resigns from the DA's office, she is paired with Jack McCoy (Sam Waterston), the new Executive ADA. In the two seasons they appear in together, she and the brash, competitive McCoy often butt heads over the social and political implications of their trial strategies, as well as McCoy's penchant for going to legal extremes to get a conviction. The two eventually form a close bond, however, and it is hinted in several episodes that they become lovers. In the episode \\"Aftershock\\", she is one of the witnesses to a man being put to death for raping and murdering a young woman. Afterwards, she struggles with this, questioning whether or not the death penalty was a just punishment. Kincaid is killed just as she is considering leaving the DA's office; her car is struck by a drunk driver as she takes an inebriated Lennie Briscoe (Jerry Orbach) home from a bar. McCoy is haunted by her death, as evidenced by his intense, legally questionable efforts to prosecute a drunk driver and his indignation at being questioned about the circumstances of her death. Following her death, Briscoe re-enters Alcoholics Anonymous and remains sober for the rest of his life; it is implied that he feels his drinking was responsible for her death. In one episode of Season 6, \\"Corpus Delicti\\", Kincaid was played by Jill Hennessy's identical twin sister, Jacqueline Hennessy, in certain courtroom scenes.\\"The Daily Beast: Celebrity Hidden Twins: Jill and Jacqueline Hennessy,\\" The Daily Beast (August 5, 2009). This was because Jill was filming in Baltimore for the crossover episode of Homicide: Life on the Street, which was broadcast a few weeks later.https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0629216/ Jacqueline Hennessy's performance was uncredited. Jamie Ross (Carey Lowell) replaced Kincaid as McCoy's assistant. Behind the scenes The Kincaid character was written out after Hennessy expressed concern about being typecast as an \\"uptight lawyer\\".\\"'Law & Order': 20 Years of Arresting Drama\\", TV Guide Special Collector's Issue. Kincaid was originally intended to be portrayed as paralyzed and leaving the DA's office for private practice after the events of \\"Aftershock\\". This was eventually changed to Kincaid's death, which wasn't officially confirmed until Season 9. Hennessy rejects claims she refused to come back for a follow-up episode: \\"I made it clear I wanted to come back. I found out they killed me off from a friend who watched the show and told me, 'Jill, they said you were dead!' I was surprised, because I always thought I would return. Even now, I'd love to come back for some bizarre flashbacks.\\" References Category:Law & Order characters Category:Fictional assistant district attorneys Category:Fictional Harvard University people Category:Fictional lawyers Category:Television characters introduced in 1993 Category:Crossover characters in television Category:American female characters in television pt:Claire Kincaid ","title":"Claire Kincaid"},{"id":"1861881","text":"Peter Nicholas Broun (17 August 1797 ‚Äì 5 November 1846), known for most of his life as Peter Nicholas Brown, was the first Colonial Secretary of Western Australia, and a member of Western Australia's first Legislative Council. Early life Peter Broun was born in Guernsey on 17 August 1797, son of William Broun, who was the brother of Sir James Broun, the 7th baronet of Colstoun and Thornydykes, and Nancy Mainguy. Peter Broun was descended from Sir George Broun, the 3rd baronet, who lived in two of the family estates, Thornydyke Castle and Bassendean, in Berwickshire. Broun spent his early life in Scotland as a gentleman clerk. In 1825 he married Caroline Simpson. They were to have three sons and five daughters. Colonial Secretary On 30 September 1828, Lieutenant-Governor James Stirling made a number of appointments to important public service positions for the planned colony of Western Australia, including appointing Peter Broun to the position of Colonial Secretary at a salary of ¬£400. Broun's appointment was on the recommendation of Sir George Murray, Secretary of State for War and the Colonies, who was a close family friend of the Brouns. Broun sailed for the new colony with his wife and two children on board the , arriving in June 1829. Initially he worked out of a group of tents on Garden Island, before transferring to a temporary building on the new site of Perth, constructed by Broun with the intention of being his home. In 1832, the Colonial Secretary's office moved to more permanent quarters on the corner of Hay and Irwin Streets. Broun had brought livestock, equipment and furniture valued at more than ¬£500, which entitled him to a grant of , which he took up in Upper Swan and West Guildford. The latter estate, which he named Bassendean after the Berwickshire ancestral family estate, is now the suburb of Bassendean. The neighboring suburb, Eden Hill, was named after Eden Water, the river flowing through Bassendean, Berwickshire. In 1830, a legislative council was formed to help the governor to rule the colony, with the first sitting in 1832. As colonial secretary, Broun was automatically appointed to the council. The council met four times a month, and during Stirling's absence, from August 1832 to August 1834, Broun was particularly busy. He remained a member until his death. In addition to his duties as colonial secretary and clerk of the legislative council, he was also registrar for the colony and second in importance to the governor. Broun the banker As colonial secretary, Broun was initially responsible for managing much of the government's funds, and after an initial proposal to set up a government-backed colonial bank failed to materialise, when settlers needed to lodge their funds for safekeeping they naturally turned to him. Broun was entirely untrained in matters of finance and accounting, and the large distances over which the colony was spread meant that cheques were often held for long periods of time. Payments to shipping companies by settlers for imports meant that hard currency became scarce and in January 1834 the government issued a limited number of ¬£1 notes. This had the effect of raising suspicion against Broun's own promissory notes and by 1835, his makeshift bank had effectively collapsed, and government funds had to be used to settle the matter. To repay the government, Broun sold out his entire estate at Bassendean, and assigned one quarter of his income to the government until the debt was repaid. Not all settlers were prepared to accept that Broun's failure as a banker was entirely innocent, for on 12 January 1836 he was verbally assaulted in the street by a settler named Will Shaw, who had previously been involved in a protracted dispute with Broun over the boundary between their grants. Shaw was fined for the assault, but went on to slander Broun throughout the town. Broun then brought a slander case against Shaw, which he won easily. The court case won Broun much public goodwill, for it showed that he had only agreed to act as banker for the good of the public, and that as soon as he had had to suspend payments he had sold his own estate to settle the debts. Death Broun first became ill in July 1846. After a brief recovery, he relapsed in August. He eventually died in Fremantle on 5 November 1846, and was buried in East Perth Cemetery. He was survived by his wife and a number of sons. A grandson, Frank Broun, later became Member for Beverley in the Western Australian Legislative Assembly, and, like his grandfather, Colonial Secretary of Western Australia. His wife sailed for England in the which caught fire at sea and was destroyed. She was saved but Broun's diaries and papers which she had intended to have published in London were destroyed. Brown or Broun For most of his life, Broun spelled his surname Brown, despite the fact that the family name had been spelled Broun for most of the family's history. James Battye claimsThis claim of Battye is repeated in Bryan and Bray (1935), but no reference is given. that the entire family had changed the spelling of their surname to Brown in an attempt to avoid the consequences of an involvement in the Jacobite rising of 1745. The entire family, including Peter Broun, changed back to Broun in 1843. Although Broun lived for only a further three years, most current sources adopt the Broun spelling.

Defined in technical language, spectral music is an acoustic musical practice where compositional decisions are often informed by sonographic representations and mathematical analysis of sound spectra, or by mathematically generated spectra. The spectral approach focuses on manipulating the spectral features, interconnecting them, and transforming them. In this formulation, computer-based sound analysis and representations of audio signals are treated as being analogous to a timbral representation of sound. The (acoustic-composition) spectral approach originated in France in the early 1970s, and techniques were developed, and later refined, primarily at IRCAM, Paris, with the Ensemble l'Itin√©raire, by composers such as G√©rard Grisey and Tristan Murail. Hugues Dufourt is commonly credited for introducing the term musique spectrale (spectral music) in an article published in 1979. Murail has described spectral music as an aesthetic rather than a style, not so much a set of techniques as an attitude; as Joshua Fineberg puts it, a recognition that \\"music is ultimately sound evolving in time\\". Julian Anderson indicates that a number of major composers associated with spectralism consider the term inappropriate, misleading, and reductive. The Istanbul Spectral Music Conference of 2003 suggested a redefinition of the term \\"spectral music\\" to encompass any music that foregrounds timbre as an important element of structure or language. Origins and history While spectralism as a historical movement is generally considered to have begun in France and Germany in the 1970s, precursors to the philosophy and techniques of spectralism, as prizing the nature and properties of sound above all else as an organizing principle for music, go back at least to the early twentieth century. Proto-spectral composers include Claude Debussy, Edgard Var√®se, Giacinto Scelsi, Olivier Messiaen, Gy√∂rgy Ligeti, Iannis Xenakis, LaMonte Young, and Karlheinz Stockhausen.; ; }} Other composers who anticipated spectralist ideas in their theoretical writings include Harry Partch, Henry Cowell, and Paul Hindemith. Also crucial to the origins of spectralism was the development of techniques of sound analysis and synthesis in computer music and acoustics during this period, especially focused around IRCAM in France and Darmstadt in Germany. Julian Anderson considers Danish composer Per N√∏rg√•rd's Voyage into the Golden Screen for chamber orchestra (1968) to be the first \\"properly instrumental piece of spectral composition\\". Spectralism as a recognizable and unified movement, however, arose during the early 1970s, in part as a reaction against and alternative to the primarily pitch focused aesthetics of the serialism and post-serialism which was ascendant at the time.\\"... the question of timbre, though it is rigorously tackled by Sch√∂nberg (in his theory of the \\"melody of timbres\\") and above all by Webern, nevertheless has pre-serial origins, especially in Debussy‚Äîin this regard a \\"founding father\\" of the same rank as Sch√∂nberg. [...] Later, it also provided the grounds for the break with Boulez's \\"structural\\" orientations and the contestation of the legacy of serialism which was carried out by the French group L'Itin√©raire (G√©rard Grisey, Micha√´l Levinas, Tristan Murail ...)\\" . Early spectral composers were centered in the cities of Paris and Cologne and associated with the composers of the Ensemble l'Itin√©raire and the Feedback Group, respectively. In Paris, Gerard Grisey and Tristan Murail were the most prominent pioneers of spectral techniques; Grisey‚Äôs ‚ÄúEspaces Acoustiques‚Äù and Murail‚Äôs ‚ÄúGondwana‚Äù were two influential works of this period. Their early work emphasized the use of the overtone series, techniques of spectral analysis and ring and frequency modulation, and slowly unfolding processes to create music which gave a new attention to timbre and texture. The German Feedback Group, including Johannes Fritsch, Mesias Maiguashca, Peter E√∂tv√∂s, Claude Vivier, and Clarence Barlow, was primarily associated with students and disciples of Karlheinz Stockhausen, and began to pioneer spectral techniques around the same time. Their work generally placed more emphasis on linear and melodic writing within a spectral context as compared to that of their French contemporaries, though with significant variations. Another important group of early spectral composers was centered in Romania, where a unique form of spectralism arose, in part inspired by Romanian folk music. This folk tradition, as collected by B√©la Bart√≥k (1904‚Äì1918), with its acoustic scales derived directly from resonance and natural wind instruments of the alphorn family, like the buciume and tulnice, as well as the cimpoi bagpipe, inspired several spectral composers, including Anatol Vieru, Aurel Stroe, ≈ûtefan Niculescu, Hora»õiu RƒÉdulescu, Iancu Dumitrescu, and Octavian Nemescu. Towards the end of the twentieth century, techniques associated with spectralist composers began to be adopted more widely and the original pioneers of spectralism began to integrate their techniques more fully with those of other traditions. For example, in their works from the later 1980s and into the 1990s, both Grisey and Murail began to shift their emphasis away from the more gradual and regular process which characterized their early work to include more sudden dramatic contrasts as more well linear and contrapuntal writing. Likewise, spectral techniques were adopted by composers from a wider variety of traditions and counties, including the UK (with composers like Julian Anderson and Jonathan Harvey), Finland (composers like Magnus Lindberg and Kaija Saariaho), and the United States. A further development is the emergence of \\"hyper-spectralism\\" in the works of Iancu Dumitrescu and Ana-Maria Avram.; Compositional technique \\"The spectral adventure has allowed the renovation, without imitation of the foundations of occidental music, because it is not a closed technique but an attitude.\\" ‚Äì G√©rard Grisey. The \\"panoply of methods and techniques\\" used are secondary, being only \\"the means of achieving a sonic end\\". Spectral music focuses on the phenomenon and acoustics of sound rather than its potential semantic qualities. Pitch material and intervallic content are often derived from the harmonic series, including the use of microtones. Spectrographic analysis of acoustic sources is used as inspiration for orchestration. The reconstruction of electroacoustic source materials by acoustic instruments is another common approach to spectral orchestration. In \\"additive instrumental synthesis,\\" instruments are assigned to play discrete components of a sound, such as an individual partial. Amplitude modulation, frequency modulation, difference tones, harmonic fusion, residue pitch, Shepard-tone phenomena, and other psychoacoustic concepts are applied to music materials. Formal concepts important in spectral music include process and the stretching of time. Though development is \\"significantly different from those of minimalist music\\" in that all musical parameters may be affected, it similarly draws attention to very subtle aspects of the music. These processes most often achieve a smooth transition through interpolation. Any or all of these techniques may be operating in a particular work, though this list is not exhaustive. The Romanian spectral tradition focuses more on the study of how sound itself behaves in a \\"live\\" environment. Sound work is not restricted to harmonic spectra but includes transitory aspects of timbre and non-harmonic musical components (e.g., rhythm, tempo, dynamics). Furthermore, sound is treated phenomenologically as a dynamic presence to be encountered in listening (rather than as an object of scientific study). This approach results in a transformational musical language in which continuous change of the material displaces the central role accorded to structure in spectralism of the \\"French school\\". Composers= France  Spectral music was initially associated with composers of the French Ensemble l'Itin√©raire, including Dufourt, G√©rard Grisey, Tristan Murail, and Michael Levinas. For these composers, musical sound (or natural sound) is taken as a model for composition, leading to an interest in the exploration of the interior of sounds. Giacinto Scelsi was an important influence on Grisey, Murail and Levinas; his approach with exploring a single sound in his works and a \\"smooth\\" conception of time (such as in his Quattro pezzi su una nota sola) greatly influenced these composers to include new instrumental techniques and variations of timbre in their works.  Germany & Romania  Other spectral music composers include those from the German Feedback group, principally Johannes Fritsch, Mesias Maiguashca, Peter E√∂tv√∂s, Claude Vivier, and Clarence Barlow. Features of spectralism are also seen independently in the contemporary work of Romanian composers ≈ûtefan Niculescu, Hora»õiu RƒÉdulescu, and Iancu Dumitrescu.  United States  Independent of spectral music developments in Europe, American composer James Tenney's output included more than fifty significant works that feature spectralist traits. His influences came from encounters with a scientific culture which pervaded during the postwar era, and a \\"quasi-empiricist musical aesthetic\\" from John Cage. His works, although having similarities with European spectral music, are distinctive in some ways, for example in his interest in \\"post-Cageian indeterminacy\\".  Post-spectralism  The spectralist movement inspired more recent composers such as Julian Anderson, Ana-Maria Avram, Joshua Fineberg, Georg Friedrich Haas, Jonathan Harvey, Fabien L√©vy, Magnus Lindberg, and Kaija Saariaho. Some of the \\"post-spectralist\\" French composers include Eric Tanguy, Philippe Hurel, Fran√ßois Paris, Philippe Leroux, and Thierry Blondeau. In the United States, composers such as Alvin Lucier, La Monte Young, Terry Riley, Maryanne Amacher, Phill Niblock, and Glenn Branca relate some of the influences of spectral music into their own work. Tenney's work has also influenced a number of composers such as Larry Polansky and John Luther Adams. In the USA, jazz saxophonist and composer Steve Lehman, and in Europe, French composer , have both introduced spectral techniques into the domain of jazz.; Notable works Characteristic spectral pieces include: * G√©rard Grisey: Les espaces acoustiques (P√©riodes and Partiels) * Tristan Murail: Gondwana Other pieces that utilise spectral ideas or techniques include: *G√©rard Grisey: Vortex Temporum *Tristan Murail: M√©moire-√ârosion *Michael Levinas: Appels *Karlheinz Stockhausen: Stimmung *James Tenney: Clang *James Tenney: Quintext Post-spectral pieces include: * Georg Friedrich Haas: In Vain * John Chowning: Stria (1977) * Jonathan Harvey: Mortuos Plango, Vivos Voco (1980) Stria and Mortuos Plango, Vivos Voco are examples of electronic music that embrace spectral techniques.; .

Gaebelein. Arno Clemens Gaebelein (August 27, 1861 ‚Äì December, 1945) was a Methodist minister in the United States. He was a prominent teacher and conference speaker. He was also the father of educator and philosopher of Christian education Frank E. Gaebelein. Career Being a dispensationalist, he was a developer of the movement in its early days. Two of his books, Revelation, an Analysis and Exposition and Current Events in the Light of the Bible explain the dispensationalist view of eschatology. Gaebelein did not support the Christian Zionists in their alliance with the Zionist Organisation. In a 1905 speech, he stated: In 1899, Gaebelein left the Methodist Episcopal Church because of its theological liberalism. George Marsden notes that he was one of the early fundamentalist leaders to advocate ecclesiastical separation. Gaebelein was an advocate of gap creationism.McIver, Thomas Allen. (1989).

Paxton. They had a US number one hit record, \\"Alley Oop\\" (Lute Records 5905) in 1960. \\"Alley Oop\\" According to Paxton - who, at the time, was half of Skip & Flip - \\"Alley Oop\\" was written by Dallas Frazier as a country tune: > \\"As for the name, Kim Fowley and I were living in a $15-a-week room in > Hollywood.... Since I was still under contract (to Brent Records) as 'Flip,' > I couldn't put my name on 'Alley Oop.' Seeing that the studio was on the > corner of Hollywood Blvd. and Argyle Street, I decided on Hollywood > Argyles... Richard Podolor's studio American Recording Company in the > Hollywood Palladium building is where the song was recorded... Other than > myself, there were no actual Hollywood Argyles. Everyone else on the track > was either a friend or a studio musician who I paid $25 apiece for the > session. When 'Alley Oop' suddenly took off and people wanted to book us for > concerts, there was no such group.\\" The \\"Alley Oop\\" session was produced by Kim Fowley; He recalled that \\"all the participants were hopelessly drunk on cider by the time they recorded the song....\\" According to some reports, the lead vocalist on the track \\"Alley Oop\\" is Norm Davis, although the voice on the record has been identified as a match with other recordings sung by Paxton from the same era, such as \\"Spookie Movies.\\" According to an interview with Gary Paxton, The group consisted of Ronnie Silico on drums, Gaynel Hodge on piano, Harper Cosby as the bassist, and Sandy Nelson (of Teen Beat fame) was the percussionist on the tambourine and a garbage can. He was also the vocal scream in the song. The background singers were Dallas Frazier, Buddy Mize, Scott Turner, and Diane (Smith ? ) \\"Alley Oop\\" was the first song played on WLS-AM Radio in Chicago on May 2, 1960, when it changed format from farm programming to rock and roll. The song sold over one million copies and was awarded a gold disc by the RIAA. Other versions According to Jerry Osborne, two other groups, Dante and the Evergreens (Madison 130, U.S. #15) and the Dyna-Sores (Rendezvous 120, U.S. #59), \\"Jimmy Norman teamed up with H.B. Barnum and Ty Terrell (Robins). This group was the Dyna-Sores and they recorded on Rendezvous 120.\\" had a version of \\"Alley Oop\\" on the charts at the same time. Later activities Frazier is perhaps best known for writing the song \\"There Goes My Everything\\", a hit song for Jack Greene in 1966 and Engelbert Humperdinck in 1967. Frazier also wrote and recorded \\"Elvira\\" which became a 1981 country hit for the Oak Ridge Boys. Paxton later formed Garpax Records and became a gospel artist. Fowley soon produced The Murmaids' 1963 hit \\"Popsicles and Icicles\\" (US #3). He also helped bring together the Runaways in 1975, as well as The Orchids (not the Glaswegians, but another American all-female band). Their 1980 album, The Orchids, was released on MCA Records as MCA-3235.

Their name originated from a children's book called Tillie and the Wall, written by Leo Lionni. They are particularly noted for having a tap dancer, Jamie Pressnall, instead of a drummer. History=Formation and Wild Like Children The group formed in 2001 after the demise of several Omaha groups, including Conor Oberst's Park Ave., of which Neely Jenkins and Jamie Pressnall (then Jamie Williams) were members. Jamie brought along Kianna Alarid from another band that broke up called Magic Kiss. Derek Pressnall and Nick White, natives of Dunwoody, Georgia were drawn to the music scene in Omaha, Nebraska and moved. Nick White was also one of the few constants for Bright Eyes in 2005, appearing on I'm Wide Awake, It's Morning and Digital Ash in a Digital Urn, as well as touring worldwide with the band. Their first show was an open-mic night at the now defunct Ranch Bowl. Their first release, Woo!, was recorded in Conor Oberst's garage, self-published, and distributed at shows around the Omaha area. The group released a limited-pressing eponymous 7\\" on Rue Royale Records, followed by their debut LP, Wild Like Children in 2004. It was the flagship release on Oberst's Team Love label and made with the help of Presto studios. Wild Like Children garnered the band a substantial amount of critical acclaim and propelled them to national tours with Bright Eyes, Rilo Kiley, and Of Montreal. In early 2005, Tilly and the Wall became the first \\"band in residence\\" at Omaha's Bemis Center for Contemporary Arts, using the Bemis Underground's Studio T to develop their follow-up album to Wild Like Children. In September of that year, they released \\"You and I Misbehaving\\" as a limited- pressing 7\\" in the UK through indie label Trash Aesthetics. This release picked up further critical acclaim as well as support from BBC radio broadcaster Steve Lamacq. They played their first show outside of the US at the Freebutt in Brighton on February 14, 2006. Bottoms of Barrels Bottoms of Barrels, the band's follow-up to Wild Like Children, was released on May 23, 2006. Tilly and the Wall appeared on the Late Show with David Letterman on October 27, 2006, to perform \\"Bad Education\\". The song was not played in full due to time constraints. A number of live dates were played to support the album. The band toured with Jenny Lewis in support of her album featuring The Watson Twins, Rabbit Fur Coat. They then went on their first headlining tour to promote Bottoms of Barrels, with acts such as David Dondero, Now It's Overhead, and Wolf Colonel supporting them. They played the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival on April 27, 2007. In addition to performing at 2007's Splendour in the Grass festival, Tilly and the Wall toured Australia. Band members Jamie Williams and Derek Pressnall were married shortly after the album's release, on August 12, 2006. o On February 25, Tilly and the Wall released a video for a new song entitled \\"Beat Control\\". The digital release of the song was on March 4, with a new album track \\"Cacophony\\" appearing as a b-side. \\"Beat Control\\" was released only as a single and was not included on the album released later in 2008. Tilly and the Wall's third album, o, was released on June 17, 2008. Two songs they performed on their 2007 tour, \\"Too Excited\\" and \\"Chandelier Lake\\", appear on the album. The songs were played at their Daytrotter show. Tilly have recorded their own version of the ABC song for the new season of Sesame Street. The first single from the album is \\"Pot Kettle Black\\". It was featured in the pilot episode of 90210, TV spots for the Seth Rogen film Observe and Report, the film Whip It and its soundtrack album, and in the video game Midnight Club: Los Angeles.

In 1896, the first U.S. patent for an addressing machine, the Addressograph was issued to Joseph Smith Duncan of Sioux City, Iowa. It was a development of the invention he had made in 1892. His earlier model consisted of a hexagonal wood block onto which he glued rubber type which had been torn from rubber stamps. While revolving, the block simultaneously inked the next name and address ready for the next impression. The \\"Baby O\\" model was put into production on July 26, 1893, in a small back room of the old Caxton Building in Chicago, Illinois. The original company which manufactured the Addressograph, Addressograph International, merged in 1932 with American Multigraph of Cleveland, Ohio, to form the Addressograph-Multigraph Corporation manufacturing highly efficient addressograph and duplicating machines. In 1978 the corporate headquarters moved from Cleveland to Los Angeles, California, and the corporation name changed in 1979 to AM International. In 1982, the firm filed for bankruptcy under Chapter 11. An Addressograph system of the 1960s was essentially a Graphotype debossing machine for preparing address plates, a cassette-style plate feeder, a heavy-duty, rapidly moving inked ribbon, a platten for hand- feeding the mail piece, and a foot pedal for stamping the address. The individual steel address plates were inserted into card-sized frames which had a series of slots along the top where colored metal flags could also be inserted for sorting purposes. The plate assemblies were placed in steel cassettes resembling library card catalogue drawers, which were manually inserted into the machine. At the press of the foot pedal the plate assemblies were swapped in sequence in a similar fashion to a slide projector, placing an impression of the raised type onto the mail piece. Addressograph was one of the comparator companies in the book Good to Great. An Addressograph was used by the artist Jean Tinguely in his famous Homage to New York (1960) machine performance.\\"The Garden Party\\", report about Homage to New York (1960) by Billy Kl√ºver, reprinted in: Pontus Hult√©n (ed.): The Machine as seen at the End of the Mechanical Age.

The Pontine Marshes (, also ; , formerly also Paludi Pontine; by Titus Livius,History of Rome, 6.5.2. Pomptina Palus (singular) and Pomptinae Paludes (plural) by Pliny the ElderNatural History 3.59.Natural History 26.9.) is an approximately quadrangular area of former marshland in the Lazio Region of central Italy, extending along the coast southeast of Rome about from just east of Anzio to Terracina (ancient Tarracina), varying in distance inland between the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Volscian Mountains (the Monti Lepini in the north, the Monti Ausoni in the center, and the Monti Aurunci in the south) from The northwestern border runs approximately from the mouth of the river Astura along the river and from its upper reaches to Cori in the Monti Lepini. The former marsh is a low tract of mainly agricultural land created by draining and filling, separated from the sea by sand dunes. The area amounts to about 80,000 ha (800 km2; 310 sq mi).. The Via Appia, a Roman military road constructed in 312 BC, crosses the inland side of the former marsh in a long, straight stretch flanked by trees. Before then, travelers had to use the Via Latina along the flanks of the mountains; Terracina could not be reached across the marsh. Further southward along the coast as far as Minturno is another stretch of former coastal marsh called the South Pontino, the largest section being between Terracina and Sperlonga, as far inland as Fondi. It was part of ancient Latium adiectum and still belongs to Lazio. Bordered by the Aurunci Mountains, this land is mainly reclaimed, as well, but the more frequent incursion of hills permitted more dense settlements. Leaving Terracina, the Via Appia crosses it, as well. The marsh was an extensive alluvial plain at about sea level (some above, some below) created by the failure of the streams draining the mountains to find clearly defined outlets to the sea through the barrier dunes.. Above sea level, it was a forested swamp; below, it was mud flats and pools. Sparsely inhabited throughout much of their history, the Pontine Marshes were the subject of extensive land reclamation work performed periodically. The tribe of the Volsci began with minor draining projects in the vicinity of Tarracina in connection with their occupation of it in the pre-Roman period. The road proved difficult to keep above water. Under Augustus, a compromise was reached with the construction of a parallel canal. The part of the marsh above sea level was successfully drained by channels, and new agricultural land of legendary fertility came into being. Whenever the channels were not maintained, the swamp reappeared. Meanwhile, frequent epidemics of malaria at Rome and elsewhere kept the reclamation issue alive. Under Benito Mussolini's regime in the 1930s, the problem was nearly solved by placing dikes and pumping out that portion of the marsh below sea level. It continues to need constant maintenance. Italian confidence in the project was so high, the city placed by Mussolini in 1932 in the center of the marsh, Latina, became the capital of a new province, Latina. Geology The Agro Pontino geologically is one of four geomorphic divisions of a somewhat larger area, the Pontine Region, also comprising the Monti Albani, the Volscian Mountains and Monte Circeo; in short, all of Roman Latium.Van Joolen Chapter 1 2003 p. 10. The marsh itself was located in Latium Novum, the eastern part of the region, which the Romans removed from the sovereignty of the Volsci. The two terms create some confusion in the literature, as the region was often heavily settled, but the marsh supported no resident population. Pliocene The underlying land form is a horst-graben, in which expansion of the crust causes a section to drop, creating a rift valley. Underneath the marsh is such a valley, while the steeply sided Volscian Mountains and the floor under the outer dunes are the corresponding horsts. The graben was formed over a period approximated by the end of the Pliocene about 2.588 million years ago. The natural outcome of this graben topography was the creation of outer barrier islands and a lagoon that gradually filled with runoff sediment transported from the mountains. Pleistocene The rift valley remained a depression in the Tyrrhenian Sea for about 2 million years and then in the Tuscolano- Artemisio phase, dated 600-360 thousand years BP, a series of volcanic changes began leading to the current land form: the first four eruptive cycles of a new volcano in the vicinity of the Monti Albani, which spread pyroclastic rock and formed a caldera. In the Campi di Annibale phase, 300-200 thousand years BP, a stratovolcano formed in the caldera. Approximately contemporaneously, in the Middle Pleistocene, 781-126 thousand years BP, beds of sand and clay, termed the Latina Complex, appeared above sea level over the outer karst, enclosing a lagoon.Van Joolen Chapter 1 2003 p. 11. The beaches survive as the Latina Level from about 560 thousand years BP. The Tyrrhenian II transgression of ocean water into the lagoon left the Minturno level and complex, a dune barrier of about , dated 125-100 thousand years BP.Van Joolen Chapter 3 2003 p. 65. Behind the beach, deep peat and clay deposits alternating with alluvial sediments evidence the lagoon. It was deepest at the Terracina end diminishing to surface at Cisterna, where beds of travertine, sand fused by volcanic activity, reach the surface. At this time, Latium Vetus had been formed as a volcanic land mass, while Latium Novum was a lagoon, the future marsh. The Tyrrhenian III transgression left the Borgo Ermada Complex and Level, about 90 thousand years BP. It consisted of elongated sand ridges parallel to the shore, high. During the regression phase, fluvial incisions indicate by then at very latest, the lagoon was totally enclosed. After it drained, aeolian (wind-driven) sand covered the notches. At around 22 thousand years BP, the volcanic complex became active for the last time, erupting in hydromagmatic explosions that created the beds of Lakes Albano and Nemi, both crater lakes. Holocene The most recent beach, the Terracina Complex and Level, which began the Holocene about 11700 years BP, was a single ridge behind which clay, peat, and peaty clay were being deposited at sea level. No land was yet above it. The region was a shallow lagoon interspersed with marshland. Fluvial incisions in the beach let out the excess water, which was brackish and contained salt-water molluscs, leading to the question of where the excess water came from and why alluvial fans had not buried the region. The answer is in the composition of the Volscian Mountains, which are limestone, porous, and excessively cracked and faulted. All but the heaviest rainfalls sink into the rock only to appear as a large volume of spring and ground water at the foot of the mountains. Transport of sediment was minimal. In one estimate, per second flow from springs over a distance of . In another estimate, 80% of the rain falling on the Monti Lepini is absorbed, with a single spring at Ninfa exuding per second. These facts explain why the main fill of the lagoon is peat, silt, and clay, and not thicker-grained alluvial deposits, and why it took so long. Alluvial deposits known as the Sezze Fan began about 4000 BC in the marsh below Sezze. The increased rainfall required to move the sediment is attributed to the Atlantic Period, a time of warmer and moister climate dated around 5000-3000 BC. Pollen from the marsh indicates the replacement of mixed oak by alder and willow.Van Joolen 2003 Chapter 3 p. 79. The modern rivers incised the marsh: the Ufente, the Sisto, and the Amaseno, which had shifting rather than stable tributaries. The marsh drains to the southeast, with channels parallel to the coast, exiting between Circeo and Terracina. Although settlement on the mountain slopes began much earlier, deforestation by the Volsci began in the sixth century BC. The marsh rapidly acquired the alluvial deposits of the Amaseno Fan over the peat, bringing much of it above water. No buried soils indicate any cultivation of dry land in the marsh. Archaeology Archaeological work on the marsh has been extensive, including surveys, excavations, and core samples. Four land systems have been defined: Fogliano coastal, the beach system; Borgo Grappa Beach Ridge, the region just inland from the beach - rather extensive in the Circeo section; the Latina Plain, the main part of the fields; and the Monti Lepini, the flank of the mountains.Van Joolen 2003 Chapter 3 p. 64. The center of the marsh, earlier the lagoon, although currently urban, does not provide any ancient evidence of habitation. The land (or the lake) was undoubtedly uninhabited except possibly for itinerant fowlers and fishers, but further, any evidence of human activity there would be deep in the underlying peat. In the fringes, however, most anciently at the north edge of the lagoon and in the coastal fringe, in both the Fogliano and Borgo Grappa land systems, evidence of hunting-gathering dates from the Middle Pleistocene. Evidently, man has witnessed the entire history of the lagoon and marsh from its first formation, when he hunted and fished along its shores. Paleolithic Paleolithic material comes from Campoverde at the north edge of the Pontino Agro. It is dated by typology, as none has been found in context. The assemblage of amateur collections of surface artifacts \\"shares affinities with various Lower Palaeolithic industries of Latium, ... chronologically referred to the second half of the Middle Pleistocene;\\". that is, about 500 thousand years BP. These are primarily flint cores and - flakes, consisting of denticulate tools, sidescrapers, borers, retouched flakes, some microliths, and others. Also from Campoverde come animal bones excavated unscientifically from a trench during construction and one human tooth. The latter is too large to be of modern humans, and has been assigned the genus Homo. The animals include Elephas antiquus, Mammuthus primigenius, Equus ferus, Bos primigenius, Cervus elaphus, Capreolus capreolus, and others. A skull of Neanderthal man from a grotto on Monte Circeo dates to about 65 thousand years BP. History=Roman times The marsh is described by the geographers and historians of the early Roman empire. Livy reported that after the Secessio plebis of 494 BC, a strike by the common people for political rights, a famine occurred at Rome due to decreased economic activity. Grain buyers were sent to \\"the people of the Pomptine marshes\\" and elsewhere to acquire new supplies, but were met with refusal. The Volsci attempted to exploit this momentary weakness by raising an army of invasion, but were struck down by an epidemic, of what sort, or whether historians can conclude to malaria, remains unsaid. The Romans, buying grain in Sicily, reinforced their colony at Velitrae and planted a colony at Norba, \\"which thus became a fortified point for the defence of the Pomptine region.\\"History of Rome, 2.34. In 433 BC, Rome was struck by an epidemic and again sent buyers to the Pontine, this time successfully.History of Rome, 4.25. Apparently, at least some of the marsh was under cultivation, which the high density of Roman settlements along the two northern roads might lead one to expect. Strabo says:Geography, 5.3.6. > \\"In front of Tarracina lies a great marsh, formed by two rivers; the larger > one is called the Aufidus (Ufente). It is here that the Appian Way first > touches the sea ... Near Tarracina, as you go toward Rome, there is a canal > that runs alongside the Appian Way, and is fed at numerous places by waters > from the marshes and the rivers ... The boat is towed by a mule.\\" In Strabo's view, Latium extends south of Tarracina to Sinuessa. Through the marsh, with reference to the Via Appia and the Via Latina, \\"the rest of the cities of Latium ... are situated either on these roads or near them, or between them.\\" He lists a number of settlements of the Monti Lepini Land System, from southeast to northwest:Geography, 5.3.10. Setia, Signa, Privernum, Cora, Pometia, and a number of others in the north of the Roman Campagna on the Via Latina. Pliny the Elder's statement on the topic of the marshes:Historia Naturalis, III.59. > \\"Another marvel not far from Circello is the Pomptine Marsh, a place that > Mucianus, who was three times consul, has reported to be the site of 24 > cities. Then comes the river Aufentum, above which is the town of Tarracina > ...\\" is notable for what it does not say, which is the names and locations of the cities. Many more than 24 Roman settlements were built in the marsh, but it is not possible to find 24 of the size of Terracina or Antium without counting Latium Vetus or the coastal lands south of Terracina. According to Plutarch, Julius Caesar had ambitious plans for the marsh, which if realized or realizable would have diverted the Tiber through > \\"During the expedition [a planned campaign around Europe] he intended ... to > receive the Tiber immediately below the city in a deep cut, and giving it a > bend toward Circaeum to make it enter the sea by Tarracina, ...besides this > he designed to draw off the water from the marshes about Pomentium and > Settia, and to make them solid ground, which would employ many thousands of > men in the cultivation ...\\" Renaissance In 1298, Pope Boniface VIII had a canal dug to connect the Ninfa River with the Cavata River, which drained much of the land in the Dukedom of Sermoneta, recently bought by his nephews. The increase in water in the Cavata caused severe flooding in the marsh near Sezze. Before he died in 1447, Pope Eugene IV attempted to solve the now-longstanding water dispute between Sermoneta and Sezze by digging another canal to connect and control the rivers of those regions, but the project ended when he died. Pope Leo X, a Medici, proposed to finish the project, but was opposed by the Duke of Sermoneta over the fishing rights. In 1514, he decided to drain the region around Terracina instead, assigning the task to his brother Giuliano de Medici, commander of the papal army. The Medicis would retain all reclaimed land. In 1515, Giuliano hired Leonardo da Vinci to design the project. It provided the Ufente River with outlets through the Canale Giuliano and Canale Portatore. Giuliano died in 1516, and the city of Tarracina combined with Sermoneta and Sezze to halt work, over the issue of property rights. The people of the marsh were not going to allow the Medicis to take their land. Popes Martin V, Sixtus V, and Pius VI all attempted to solve the problem. Pius VI reconstructed the road. In 1561, Pope Pius IV employed the services of the mathematician Rafael Bombelli, who had gained a reputation as a hydraulic engineer in reclaiming marshland in the Val di Chiana in the Tuscan Apennines, but the project also came to naught. The ambitious Sixtus V also made unsuccessful attempts at reclamation of the area, and died of malaria after a visit to the Pontine Marshes. 18th century On February 17, 1787, Johann Wolfgang Goethe visited the region with his painter-friend Tischbein. He reports in his book, The Italian Journey, that they \\"have never seen so bad of an appearance as they are usually described in Rome\\". Goethe became interested in the dewatering attempts, after observing that it is \\"a large and extensive task\\". He probably used this image in this scene in his Faust II, Act V: \\"A marsh extends along the mountain-chain, That poisons what so far I‚Äôve been achieving; Were I that noisome pool to drain, 'Twould be the highest, last achieving. Thus space to many millions I will give. Where, though not safe, yet free and active they may live.\\" 19th century Near the end of the 19th century, a Prussian officer, Major Fedor Maria von Donat (1847-1919), had an idea; he would build a channel that followed the base of the mountains, cutting through a sand dune at Terracina. This would collect the water flowing from the mountain before it reached the lowest levels where it stagnated. The water collected in the canal system would then be pumped into the Mediterranean. The electricity needed to power the canal system would be collected through dams in the mountains with hydroelectric power plants. The German patent office patented the project under the number 17,120. He expected to dry out the marshes within a five-year time span. Major von Donat published his idea in Rome and Berlin, and succeeded in gaining the attention of Emil Rathenau, the general manager of AEG in Berlin. Rathenau saw market potential for electric investments, so he and some industrialists in Berlin, as well as private financiers, created the \\"Pontine Syndicate Ltd\\" in 1900. Seventy million gold marks were set aside for the project. (With 1 mark being 5g of pure silver, the amount is equivalent to $17.5m in 1900 US$.) One of the conditions was that the Italians would have to match the funds on the project. In 1898, Fedor von Donat resigned from his position as battalion commander and moved to Rome with his family. There, he lobbied the government for his project, as well as four large landowners, connections in financial circles and the Vatican. He leased of marsh near Terracina and established a model farm, \\"Tenuta Ponte Maggiore\\". With the help of waterwheels of ancient Egyptian type, revolved by three oxen, he was able to prove that the moorland had a high percentage of organics in its soil, of over 70 points; this proved that three harvests per year were possible. He protected his 80 workers from malaria with a daily dose of quinine. He invited Roman journalists to a press conference on his property. In 1902, large German newspapers, as well as foreign papers, carried long articles about the project. They often carried a sense of national pride about the development project.Otto Julius Bierbaum, \\"Eine empfindsame Reise mit dem Automobil\\", Berlin 1903:194 Donat argued above all for the extermination of malaria in the countryside surrounding the capital. Malaria prevented the expansion of Rome to the south, the settling of which could provide a new province for Italy without a colonial war. The urbanization of the marshes could prevent 200,000 Italians from emigration. Around 1900, one could count fewer than 1,000 inhabitants for a coastal region larger than 700 km¬≤. By a law passed in 1899, the proprietors were bound to arrange for the safe outlet of the water from the mountains, keep the existing canals open, and reclaim the district exposed to inundation, for a period of 24 years. Donat's plan failed. This time it was not the technical inadequacy as with the predecessors, but political deliberations that stood in the way of the project. The liberal government hesitated and gave the North preference, where in the valley of the Po, large marshes also needed to be reclaimed. A violent resistance of the four large property owners in the Pontine Marshes was the reaction to the necessary expropriation and leasing to the German syndicate of a large part of their marsh country. The cofinancer, the Banca Commerciale in Milan, delayed starting the task. Donat, whose lobbying had operated on his own funds, exhausted his wife's fortune of 75,000 gold marks by 1903. Unsuccessful, he returned to Germany. The Pontine Syndicate was dissolved on September 4, 1914. With it, a premature but bold attempt at a transnational investment to gain more land ended. 20th century In 1928, the population of the marshes was 1,637. They were people who lived in shanties across the fields, herded, practiced agriculture, and were in poor health most of the time. The Italian Red Cross related that, during the malaria season, 80% of those having spent one night in the marsh became infected. =Bonifica integrale= Starting in 1922, the Italian government's Department of Health, working with the Opera Nazionale Combattenti,a veteran's organization, founded in 1917, reformulated in 1923 and 1926. One of its functions was to find land for veterans. developed a new initiative to combat malaria called the bonifica integrale..Although Giuseppe Tassinari, the party's agricultural expert, attributed the terms to Mussolini, they were developed by the Department of Health, 1917‚Äì1923. . It featured three stages, the first being the bonifica idraulica, which would drain the swamp and control the waters. Mussolini and his party called it \\"the battle of the swamps\\" because it required the recruitment, deployment, and supply of an army of workers.. In the second stage, the bonifica agraria, homesteads with stone houses and public utilities were to be constructed and the land was to be parcelled among settlers. The third stage, bonifica igienica, took measures against the mosquitos (Anopheles labranchiae), such as screens and whitewash (so the mosquitos could be easily identified and killed), and against malaria, such as distributing quinine and setting up health services.. In 1922 also, Benito Mussolini was made prime minister by the king. In 1926, the Department of Health undertook a pilot project of the new strategy in the delta of the Tiber River, reclaiming land and creating 45 new homesteads with great success, after which Mussolini climbed aboard. At his request to the Director- general of the Department of Health, Alessandro Messea submitted a plan for the Pontine Marshes. In 1928, Mussolini brought it before parliament; it became \\"Mussolini's Law\\", and began to be implemented in 1929. In 1939, at the incorporation ceremony of the last new city, Pomezia, the project was declared complete. Beginning in 1930, the bonifica idraulica cleared the scrub forest,Mainly Quercus suber, Q. robur, shrubby Olea europaea, Erica arborea, and Myrtus species. constructed a total of of checkerboard canals and trenches, dredged rivers, diked their banks, filled depressions, and constructed pumping stations to change the elevation in the canals where necessary. The final channel, the Mussolini Canal, empties into the Tyrrhenian Sea near Anzio. The project reached a peak in 1933 with 124000 men employed. The previous agrarian population was moved out under protest in the name of progress. Workers were interned in camps surrounded by barbed wire. The camps were overcrowded, wages were low, hours were long, food was bad, sanitation was poor, healthcare was missing, and medical attention was lacking. However, workers could quit, and the turnover was high. In 1935, at the completion of the phase, they were all dismissed without notice. Many were infected with malaria.. The government placed about 2,000 families (most from northern Italy and of unimpeachable Fascist background) in standardised but carefully varied two-storey country houses of blue stucco with tiled roofs. Each settler family was assigned a farmhouse, an oven, a plough and other agricultural tools, a stable, some cows, and several hectares of land, depending on local soil fertility and the size of the family. Mussolini used the 10-year operation for propaganda purposes, and was often photographed between workers, shirtless with a shovel in his hand, or threshing wheat at harvest time; these occasions were regularly filmed by LUCE for inclusion in nationally shown propaganda newsreels. The new towns of Littoria (1932, now Latina), Sabaudia (1934), Pontinia (1935), Aprilia (1937), and Pomezia (1939) were founded, side by side with several other small borghi (rural villages). The carefully differentiated architecture and urban planning aspects of these towns is striking even today.An accessible and positive contemporary description is E. J. Russell, \\"Agricultural Colonization in the Pontine Marshes and Libya\\", The Geographical Journal, 94.4 (1939: 273-289).F. Caprotti, \\"Mussolini's Cities: Internal Colonialism in Italy, 1930‚Äì1939\\", Cambria Press, New Jersey 2007. =Battle of Anzio= On September 8, 1943, Italy changed sides in World War II, the king having already issued an order for Mussolini's arrest. Rescued by the Germans, he became the head of the Republic of Sal√≤, a puppet regime over northern Italy. The defense of Italy and the suppression of its insurgent population were left to the Wehrmacht. After the loss of Sicily, they successfully defended the Gustaf Line south of the marshes, necessitating an Allied landing at Anzio and Nettuno in an effort to outflank the Germans. Malaria had returned to the Agro Pontino: quinine and other medicines were in short supply or withheld by the Germans,The Third Reich at War, 1939‚Äì1945,Richard J Evans, Penguin 2009, Kindle Edition, location 8517 the food was bad, a shortage of metal prevented the screens from being repaired, and veterans returning from the Balkans brought back resistant strains of the disease.. The Germans stopped the pumps and opened the dikes, refilling the marsh with brackish water. They were being advised by the German malariologists Erich Martini and Ernst Rodenwaldt that the return of the salt water would encourage the return of Anopheles labranchiae, which thrives in salty environments. The water would also destroy agriculture, removing the essential supplies of food and fresh water from the vicinity, an act that had minimal military effect, but devastated the population. Although it is true that the bog impeded the movement of heavy equipment, the Germans did not flood the marsh for that reason; the equipment under the heavy shelling from some of the largest artillery pieces the Germans had was going nowhere, anyway. The flooding was an act of biological warfare and was opposed by former Italian colleagues of the Germans in malariology, but someone on Kesselring's staff - unknown to this day - issued the order. The allies and the Germans equally, therefore, found themselves fighting in a mosquito- infested bog. The new homes were being used as refuges for infantry and cover for tanks. Ernie Pyle relates:. > \\"On these little farms of the Pontine marshes Mussolini built hundreds of > ... stone farmhouses ... Now and then I saw a farmer plowing while German > shells landed right in his field. We tried to evacuate people ... But some > of them simply refused to leave their homes. Sometimes the Germans would > pick out one of the farmhouses, figuring we had a command post in it, I > suppose, and blow it to smithereens. Then, and only then, did some Italian > families move out ... on any side road we couldn't drive five minutes > without seeing the skeleton of a cow or a horse.\\" =Agro Pontino= The Battle of Anzio left the marsh in state of devastation; nearly everything Mussolini had accomplished was reversed. The cities were in ruins, the houses blown up, the marshes full of brackish water, the channels filled in, the plain depopulated, the mosquitos flourishing, and malaria on the rise. The major structures for water control survived, and in a few years, the Agro Pontino was restored. In 1947, the province of Littoria, created by Mussolini, was renamed to Latina. The last of the malaria was conquered in the 1950s, with the aid of DDT. Today, a duct system runs through the dried-out area. Wheat, fruit, and wine grapes are cultivated in the Pontine region. The \\"Agro Pontino\\" is a flowering landscape with modern cities with both prewar and postwar architecture. By 2000, about 520,000 inhabitants lived in this formerly deserted region. The Battle of the Swamps, however, is never quite over; without constant vigilance, dredging the canals, repairing and updating the pumps, and so on, the enemy would soon return. The spectre of distant problems remains: the prospect of chemical pollution of the environment, DDT-resistant mosquitos, and medicine-resistant strains of malaria.

Located on the bank of the Chenab River, it is the capital of the district with the same name. It is the 39th largest city of Pakistan by population. History The Muzaffargarh region was an agricultural and forested area during the rule of the Indus Valley Civilization. Then came the Vedic period, which was characterized by the introduction of Indo-Aryan culture from Central Asia into the Punjab province. Over time, several other civilizations came to power in the ancient town and surrounding district: the Kambojas, the Daradas, the Kekayas, the Madras, the Pauravas, the Yaudheyas, the Malavas and the Kurus. After the fall of the Achaemenid Empire in 331 BCE, Alexander the Great marched into the present-day Punjab province with an army of 50,000 men. The Muzaffargarh region was, during different time periods, also ruled by the Maurya Empire, the Indo-Greek kingdom, the Kushan Empire, the Gupta Empire, the White Huns, the Kushano-Hephthalites, and the Shahi kingdom. In 997 CE, Sultan Mahmud Ghaznavi took over the Ghaznavid Empire, and, in 1005, conquered the Shahis in Kabul, which granted him power over the Punjab region. The Delhi Sultanate and later the Mughal Empire also ruled the region. The location of the present-day town became predominantly Muslim during this time because of the arrival of missionary Sufis whose dargahs still persist in the area. After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the Sikhs conquered the Muzaffargarh District. Later, in 1848, the British Raj assumed control of the area. In 1794, the town of Muzaffargarh was founded by a Sarbani Pashtun of the Kheshgi Afghans, Nawab Muzaffar Khan, who was also the Governor of Multan at the time. The meaning of the word is \\"Fort of Muzaffar\\" because the \\"historic district\\" lies within the walls of a fort built by the governor. In 1864, it became the capital of the Muzaffargarh District.District Profile: Southern Punjab- Muzaffargarh The place was also referred to as Kala Pani (Black Water), as it is located between two rivers: the Indus and the Chenab. It was linked to the surrounding lands by bridges during the British era. During the independence movement of Pakistan, the Muslim population supported the Muslim League and the Pakistani Movement. In 1947, after Pakistan gained independence, the minority Hindus and Sikhs migrated to India while the Muslim refugees from India settled in Muzaffargarh. Geography and climate Muzaffargarh spreads over an area of 8,249 km2 and forms a strip between the Chenab River to the east and Indus River to the west. Muzaffargarh was hit especially hard by the 2010 Pakistan floods, given its position between the Chenab and Indus rivers. Muzaffargarh is located at almost the exact geographical center of Pakistan. The closest major city is Multan. The area around the city is a flat alluvial plain and is ideal for agriculture, with many citrus and mango farms. There are also canals that cut across the Muzaffargarh District, providing water to farms. During the monsoon season, the land close to the Chenab is usually flooded. Muzaffargarh features an arid climate with very hot summers and mild winters. The city has experienced some of the most extreme weather in Pakistan. The highest recorded temperature was approximately , and the lowest recorded temperature was approximately . The average rainfall is roughly . Dust storms are a common occurrence within the city. Transportation Muzaffargarh has connections with other cities by several means of transportation. Road The town is linked to the rest of the district by paved roads that stretch for 983.69 km. Buses to Multan leave frequently, because of their close proximity to each other. There are also buses that travel to more distant destinations. The N-5 National Highway connects the city to the other parts of Pakistan. This highway allows for direct travel to Rawalpindi, Islamabad, Faisalabad, Karachi, Lahore, and Bahawalpur. Railways Muzaffargarh is connected by rail with all parts of Pakistan, as it lies on the branch track between Rawalpindi, Multan, Mianwali and Attock. The main Peshawar-Karachi railway line passes through Multan District. Muzaffargarh Nuclear Power Complex According to the Wall Street Journal, the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission (PAEC) plans to install three nuclear reactors at Muzaffargarh. The Muzaffargarh Nuclear Power Complex will have a production capacity of 1100 megawatts. Notable places=Fayyaz Park Fayyaz Park Muzaffargarh is only one Park in the city. This is situated in the center of the city. This park was named after ex-Deputy Commissioner Muzaffargarh Fayyaz Bashir. Place of park was previously the residence of Deputy Commissioner.

Photograph by Stanley Kubrick, published in \\"Look\\" Magazine, 6 June 1950 Jim Robinson, also known as Big Jim Robinson (December 25, 1892 ‚Äì May 4, 1976) was an American jazz musician, based in New Orleans, renowned for his deep, wide-toned, robust \\"tailgate\\" style of trombone playing, using the slide to achieve a wide swoop between two notes (a technique that classical musicians call \\"glissando\\") and rhythmic effects. Born Nathan Robinson in Deer Range, a tiny settlement on the west bank of lower Plaquemines Parish, Louisiana, where he studied music under James Brown Humphrey. He arrived in New Orleans looking for work shortly before the Great Hurricane of 1915 which wiped out his home town of Deer Range, which prompted Robinson to settle in the city. In his youth, he got the nickname Jim Crow because of his facial features, which resembled a Native American. He was playing professionally in his twenties, from World War I on. In the 1920s he made his first recordings as a member of the Sam Morgan Jazz Band. He achieved gained greater fame with the resurgence of interest in early New Orleans jazz starting in the 1940s as a regular member of the bands of Bunk Johnson and George Lewis. Occasionally, he also led his own band and appeared regularly at Preservation Hall in his later years. Robinson's widely recognized, individualistic sound was influential with many later traditional and New Orleans-style jazz trombonists in the United States and Europe. These included two prot√©g√©s whom Robinson tutored personally‚ÄîFrank Demond and Big Bill Bissonnette; Robinson's influence is more evident in the former. Big Jim's signature tune, \\"Ice Cream\\", was requested at almost all personal appearances after his virtuoso performance of the number in an American Music Records recording made in the 1940s. He also was known for promoting audience participation‚Äîespecially encouraging dancing whenever feasible. Jim Robinson died of cancer at the New Orleans Touro Infirmary. Although he usually indicated his date of birth as Christmas Day 1892, no specific parish records are known to substantiate the exact day and year. In his May 5, 1976 obituary in The New York Times, his age is given as 86 without citing a source, suggesting the year of birth to be 1889 or 1890.

It is located in Santa Rosa, Laguna. It has a land area of . The park is managed and operated by Enchanted Kingdom Inc. Enchanted Kingdom is a member of the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA). History=Foundation The theme park was founded by Mario and Cynthia Mamon. Their family frequently visited local theme parks such as Boom na Boom, Big Bang sa Alabang, and Fiesta Carnival, all of which inspired the couple to open a theme park of their own. While they were visiting Ocean Park in Hong Kong in the early 1990s, they attended an amusement conference being held in the country where they were then introduced to the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions (IAAPA). Realizing the group can help them enter the amusement park industry, they joined the association in 1992 following their first trade show attendance in Dallas, Texas. Aside from being the founder and President of Enchanted Kingdom, Mario Mamon is the first Asian and first Filipino to head the International Association of Amusement Parks and Attractions or IAAPA. Construction The IAAPA assisted the Mamons on getting consultants, contractors, and suppliers to set up Enchanted Kingdom. Gary Goddard, who was then with Landmark Entertainment, designed and planned the park while Cincinnati-based firm International Theme Park Services, Inc. consulted the Mamons regarding amusement parks, especially on topics such as safety and operations, for the first three years. Construction on the park began in August 1994 on a property covering . Construction was rushed to surpass other potential competitors seeking to establish their own amusement park in the Philippines, and the park opened on October 19, 1995. Operation The theme park in January 2015, with the Wheel of Fate, a ferris wheel in the background Operations of Enchanted Kingdom were with difficulties during its first years from 1995 to 2002, with the 1997 Asian financial crisis affecting the business significantly only recovering from the financial breakdown in 2003. When business stabilized, the management began introducing two entertainment units per year. Business grew and was later registered the highest daytime visit to an amusement part in Region IV (Calabarzon and Mimaropa regions) from the Department of Tourism. Domestic visitors comprise the majority of the amusement park's visitors. In early 2020, the park's operations halted due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Its operations were later resumed on October 17, 2020.https://www.gmanetwork.com/news/lifestyle/travel/760236/enchanted- kingdom-to-reopen-oct-17-strict-health-protocols/story/ Future expansion In 2016, Enchanted Kingdom began a 10-year expansion which includes the redevelopment of the existing theme park and addition of new zones, a regional convention center, a water park and a lifestyle center.  Layout and design  Aerial view of a portion of the theme park in October 2019, as seen from the Wheel of Fate The initial design of the park, which was presented to the Mamons by the consultants they brought in, was heavily inspired by Philippine architecture. The concept was not chosen since the Mamons preferred a fantasy- oriented design. Mario Mamon stated that if the initial design was used instead, it would result in visitors seeing what they see \\"outside in their normal lives\\" which he remarks would \\"sort of break the magic\\". The rides and attractions of the park are scattered across seven themed zones. The zones are Victoria Park, Portabello, Boulderville, Midway Boardwalk, Brooklyn Place, Spaceport, and Jungle Outpost. Victoria Park, which includes the main entrance, is patterned after the Victorian era. Boulderville is a small ride area for children which is similar to the fictional town of Bedrock from The Flintstones. Midway Boardwalk is based on 1930s Coney Island and features the most rides. Jungle Outpost is based on the Amazon Jungle in South America. Spaceport is dedicated to the Space Age. Brooklyn Place is based on 1940s New York and the silent film era. Finally, Portabello is based on the Caribbean/West Indies. Future zones planned include a zone dedicated to the amusement park's mascot, Eldar, as well as a zone focusing on Philippine culture, dubbed as the Cultural Zone, which recalls the initial concept for the park. Attractions The Space Shuttle roller coaster. The Enchanted Kingdom hosts around 20 rides and attractions as of 2013. Among the attractions is the Space Shuttle, a roller coaster, and the Wheel of Fate, a high Ferris wheel with 36 gondolas with each gondola having a 6-person capacity., and the Agila: The EKsperience, a flight motion simulator ride. Visitors Enchanted Kingdom experienced financial difficulties in 1997, 2007, and 2008 but since 2009, the park has received a steady increase in regards to its number of visitors. However, in 2013, the park experienced a drop in attendance due to bad weather conditions in the latter half of the year which included Typhoon Haiyan (Yolanda). In 2015, it was reported that 10 percent of the park's visitors were foreigners, mostly Chinese and Koreans. In the same year, 1.8 million people visited the park, registering its largest attendance in its 20-year history. Branding Eldar the Wizard, the main mascot of Enchanted Kingdom Enchanted Kingdom does not pay royalties to outside sources regarding its characters and attractions, instead coming up with their own characters and other intellectual property. According to company owner, Mario Mamon, the attractions and shows are produced with educational and Filipino values in mind and not solely for entertainment and amusement purposes. Characters The main mascot of the park is Eldar the Wizard, who is designed to embody \\"knowledge and integrity\\". He is characterized as a jolly, old wizard from the distant land of Marsynthea. Another character devised by Enchanted Kingdom is Princess Victoria.

Since beginning his professional art life in 1974 he has worked as a painter (in egg tempera, oil and watercolour), printmaker (etching and lithography), photographer and writer. His subject matter focuses largely on the sparse elements of human impact on Otago's empty landscapes and the loneliness of individuals in this remote setting. In recent years, he has also consistently produced figure studies of his wife Fiona as model. Sydney's works have drawn comparisons with such artists as Edward Hopper, Vilhelm Hammershoi, Christopher Pratt and Andrew Wyeth but his images are saturated with a profound sense of the New Zealand south. Sydney has been the subject of several major exhibitions. His work is held in public institutions (including Museum of New Zealand Te Papa Tongarewa) and private collections in New Zealand and in private collections through-out the world. He now rarely exhibits publicly, occasionally collaborating with galleries but mainly working with a private client list. In the 2004 New Year Honours, Sydney was made an Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit for services to painting. Several books have been published on Sydney's work: 'Grahame Sydney Paintings: 1974 - 2014' (2014); 'The Art of Grahame Sydney' (1999); 'Timeless Land' (1995). Two books of his photography have been published: 'White Silence: Grahame Sydney's Antarctica' (2008) and 'Grahame Sydney's Central Otago' (2011). In 2009 he wrote 'Promised Land' a history of the Otago goldfields. Early Life: Born in Dunedin in 1948, the youngest of three children, he gained a degree in English and Geography at University of Otago, taught secondary school for two years (1971-72), then spent 18 months in London and Europe before returning to begin his career as an artist in May 1974. Four years later, in 1978 he was awarded the Francis Hodgkin's Fellowship by the University of Otago. Since then he has lived variously between Dunedin, Mount Pisa Cottage near Cromwell and Central Otago.

For certain groups within Islam like the Salafis and Jamaat-e-Islami, Dawah is also considered as a political activity. For these groups, the aim of Dawah outreach is also to engineer a reversal of what they perceive as the decline of Islam in the modern era, through the systematic propagation of Islamist ideology and ultimately enable the establishment of an Islamic state.  Etymology  Da‚Äòwah literally means \\"issuing a summons\\" or \\"making an invitation\\". Grammatically, the word represents a gerund of a verb with the triconsonantal root d- ï-w meaning variously \\"to summon\\" or \\"to invite\\". A Muslim who practices da‚Äòwah, either as a religious worker or in a volunteer community effort, is called a ' (, plural ' ). A dƒÅ‚Äòƒ´, is a person who invites people to understand and accept Islam through dialogue and other techniques, may be regarded as a missionary inviting people to the faith, prayer and manner of Islamic life.  Early Islam  The term da'wah has other senses in the Qur'an. In sura (chapter) 30:25, for example, it denotes the call to the dead to rise on the Day of Judgment. When used in the Qur'an, it generally refers to Allah's invitation to live according to His will. Thus, when used in the first centuries of Islam, it usually referred to that message and was sometimes used interchangeably with sharƒ´‚Äòa and dƒ´n. Da‚Äòwah is also described as the duty to \\"actively encourage fellow Muslims in the pursuance of greater piety in all aspects of their lives\\", a definition which has become central to contemporary Islamic thought.See entry for da‚Äòwah in the Encyclopaedia of Islam. During Muhammad's era During the Expedition of Al Raji in 625,Mubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar, p. 187 Muhammad sent some men as missionaries to various different tribes. Some men came to Muhammad and requested that Muhammad send instructors to teach them Islam, but the men were bribed by the two tribes of Khuzaymah, who wanted revenge for the assassination of Khalid bin Sufyan (Chief of the Banu Lahyan tribe) by Muhammad's followers. (online) A number of missionaries were killed in this expedition, either eight or, according to another account, ten.Note: Book contains a list of battles of Muhammad in Arabic, English translation available here Then during the Expedition of Bir Maona in July 625 Muhammad sent some missionaries at the request of some men from the Banu Amir tribe,Mubarakpuri, The Sealed Nectar, p. 188. (online) but the Muslims were again killed in revenge for the assassination of Khalid bin Sufyan by Muhammad's followers. 70 Muslims were killed during this expedition. During the Expedition of Khalid ibn al-Walid (Banu Jadhimah) in January 630, Muhammad sent Khalid ibn Walid to invite the Banu Jadhimah tribe to Islam.William Muir, The life of Mahomet and history of Islam to the era of the Hegira, Volume 4, p. 135. This is mentioned in the Sunni Hadith .Muhsin Khan, The translation of the meanings of ·π¢ahih Al-Bukhari, Arabic-English, Volume 5, p. 440. Mus\`ab ibn \`Umair was the first Muslim envoy in September 621. Note: Author says it happened before the Second pledge at al-Aqabah which happened in 622. Therefore this event happened in 621 He was sent to Yathrib (now Medina) to teach the people the doctrines of Islam and give them guidance. Post- Muhammad After Muhammad's death in 632, from the available historical evidence, it appears that after Muhammad's death Muslims did not immediately embark upon da'wa activities‚Äîduring and after the rapid conquests of the Byzantine and Persian lands, they ventured little if at all to preach to local non-Muslims. Da'wa came into wider usage almost a hundred years after Muhammad's death, in the wake of 'Abbasid propaganda against the then ruling Umayyad clan in the 720s. However, the 'Abbasid da'wa ceased as soon as the 'Abbasids were in power‚Äîa fact that attests to its political nature. Da'wa as a truly missionary activity, albeit still within the Muslim Umma, appeared in the form of the Isma'ili da'wa of the 9th through 13th centuries. Isma'ilis, in many ways, can be seen as the pioneers of the organized Muslim missionary activities: their highly institutionalized and sophisticated da'wa structure has hardly been repeated until today. Moreover, for the Isma'ilis, da'wa was a state priority. The Isma'ili da'wa encompassed extra- and intra-ummatic forms and blended both theology and politics.[Racius, Egdunas. \\"Blending of Politics and the Islamic Da'Wa.\\" Politologija.2 (2005): 91‚Äì122. ProQuest. Web. 5 Dec. 2016.]  Purpose  In Islamic theology, the purpose of da‚Äòwah is to invite people, Muslims and non-Muslims, to understand the worship of God as expressed in the Qur'an and the sunnah of the prophet Muhammad and to inform them about Muhammad.\\"Da‚Äòwah produces converts to Islam, which in turn [increases] the size of the Muslim Ummah [community of Muslims].\\" Da'wah as the \\"Call towards God\\" is the means by which Muhammad began spreading the message of the Qur'an to mankind. After Muhammad, his followers and the Ummah (Muslim community) assumed responsibility for it. They convey the message of the Qur'an by providing information on why and how the Qur'an preaches monotheism.See, for example, Qur'an ayat (verses) 6:19 and 16:36. Muhammad saw Islam as the true religion and mission of all earlier prophets. He believed that their call had been limited to their own people but that his was universal. His mission as the final prophet was to repeat to the whole world this call and invitation (dawa) to Islam. Muhammad wrote to various non-Muslim rulers, inviting them to convert.[Sookhdeo Patrick, and Murray, Douglas. 2014. Dawa: The Islamic Strategy for Reshaping the Modern World. Isaac Publishing.]  Scriptural basis  The importance of Dawah has been emphasised many times in the Quran: In the Hadith (\\"sayings\\") of Muhammad, dawah is mentioned to emphasise importance and virtues: : \\"Whoever directs someone to do good will gain the same reward as the one who does good.\\"Sahih Muslim, , , . : \\"Whoever calls to guidance will receive the same reward as the one who follows him without any decrease in the reward of his follower.\\"Sahih Muslim, , , . : \\"For Allah to guide someone by your hand is better for you than having red camels.\\"Sahih Al Bukhari, , , . (In ancient Arabia, camelsespecially of a reddish huewere considered particularly valuable property.) : \\"Convey from me, even if it be only a single verse.\\"Sahih Al-Bukhari, , , . Muhammad sent Muadh ibn Jabal to Yemen and told him ‚ÄúYou will be going to Christians and Jews, so the first thing you should invite them to is the assertion of the oneness of Allah, Most High. If they realize that, then inform them that Allah has made five daily prayers obligatory on them. If they pray them, then inform them that Allah has made the payment of charity from their wealth obligatory on their rich to be given to their poor. If they accept that, then take it from them and avoid the best part of people‚Äôs property.‚ÄùSahih Al-Bukhari, , , and Sahih Muslim, , , .  Methods =Gentleness With regard to Muhammad's mild nature in preaching Islam, the Quran says: > And by the mercy of Allah you dealt with them gently. If you were harsh and > hardhearted, they would have fled from around you. (). The Quran says about Moses and Aaron who preached to Pharaoh, the claimant of God: > So speak to him, both of you, mildly in order that he may reflect or fear > God. (). Muhammad was reported by his wife, Aisha to have said ‚ÄúWhenever gentleness is in a thing, it beautifies it, and whenever it is withdrawn from something, it defaces.‚ÄùSahih Al-Bukhari, vol. 4, p. 1370, no. 6274. Muhammad was quoted by Jareer as saying,‚ÄúOne deprived of gentleness is deprived of all good.\\"Sahih Al-Bukhari, , , . Influence in politics Muslims made it a part of their political theory (through relating da'wa to jihad) and life (using the concept of da'wa in their political agendas). Taken in general, the intertwining of da'wa and politics, then, has been a feature throughout the Muslim history, though practical implications of this have been different in different ages.Racius, Egdunas. \\"Blending of Politics and the Islamic Da'Wa.\\" Politologija.2 (2005): 91‚Äì122. ProQuest. Web. 5 Dec. 2016. Wisdom :\\"Invite to the way of your Lord with wisdom and good instruction, and argue with them in a way that is best. Indeed, your Lord is most knowing of who has strayed from His way, and He is most knowing of who is [rightly] guided ...\\". (). A classical example of diversion in dawah can be seen in the case of Prophet Yusuf in prison when two prisoners asked him to interpret their dreams. One of them said: ‚ÄúI saw myself pressing wine.‚Äù The other said: ‚ÄúI saw myself carrying bread on my head and birds were eating from it.‚Äù They asked: ‚ÄúInform us of the interpretation of these things. Indeed, we believe you are one of the righteous.‚Äù He replied: ‚ÄúWhenever food came to you as your provision, I informed you about it before it came. That is from what my Lord has taught me.... As for one of you, he will pour wine for his lord to drink, and as for the other, he will be crucified and birds will eat from his head. This is the case judged concerning which you both inquire.‚Äù () Speaking a common language :‚ÄúI did not send any messenger except that he spoke the language of his people to explain to them.‚Äù () Location Doing dawah in the right location. For example, Mount Safa in the time of Muhammad was used for announcements. So Muhammad went there to make his point. He chose that particular location because he knew the people who he was inviting to Islam. He knew their nature and characteristics, so he chose Mount Safa. He climbed up to its summit and addressed his people saying: ‚ÄúO people of Quraysh, if I were to tell you there was an army behind this hill would you listen to me?‚Äùhttp://www.kalamullah.com/Books/Dawah.pdf Dawah training Various Islamic institutions provide elaborate manuals, trainings and workshops to da‚Äòi to prepare them for successful dawah. Dawah manual Dawah manuals, booklets or guides are training material that give a framework and methodology for a da‚Äòi to invite non-Muslims to accept and convert to Islam. The manuals present detailed guidance on how to carry out dialogue, various techniques and detailed steps of implementing dawah for non-muslim individual or collective audiences as well as socio-religious groups like athiests, Buddhists, Christians, Hindus etc. Trainings and workshops Da‚Äòi are given trainings in the form of physical workshops and training sessions. Dawah trainings are also provided in the form of online video lessons, webinars, online discussion forums, handouts and quizzes.  Movements  Modern dawah movements are varied in their objectives and activities. Examples include: * The Muslim Brotherhood has focused on a methodology of building grassroots institutions and funding welfare projects, which has helped it survive decades of repression under various dictatorships in many Middle Eastern countries, with the group and its many offshoots still enjoying popular support and power.32,000 Muslim Brothers Detained Under Old Regime Emergency Law.

It lies 2.6 million light-years from Earth, and was discovered by Fritz Zwicky in 1942. The estimated mass of this galaxy is solar masses, with at least 80% consisting of an unknown dark matter. It is one of the most isolated galaxies in the Local Group and shows no indications of an interaction or merger for several billion years. However, Leo A is nearly unique among irregular galaxies in that more than 90% of its stars formed more recently than 8 billion years ago, suggesting a rather unusual evolutionary history. The presence of RR Lyrae variables shows that the galaxy has an old stellar population that is up to 10 billion years in age. Leo A is at a distance of about 2.5 million light-years, and is a member of the Local Group of galaxies. The neutral hydrogen in this galaxy occupies in a volume similar to its optical extent, and is distributed in a squashed, uneven ring. The galaxy is not rotating and the hydrogen is moving about in random clumps. The proportion of elements with higher atomic numbers than helium is only about 1-2% of the ratio in the Sun. This indicates a much less complete conversion of gas into stars than in the Milky Way galaxy.

He played college football at College of the Canyons and the University of California, Berkeley, and received consensus All- American recognition. The Arizona Cardinals selected him in the second round of the 2005 NFL Draft. He also played for the Denver Broncos, and had a brief stint with the Philadelphia Eagles and Las Vegas Locomotives of the UFL. Early years Arrington was born in Nashville, North Carolina. He attended Northern Nash High School in Rocky Mount, North Carolina, and was a letterman in football as a tailback. In football, he was a three-year varsity starter and a two-time All-Conference selection. He was also named his team's Most Valuable Player, and the Area Offensive Player of the Year as a senior. College career Arrington was sent to College of the Canyons by East Carolina University with the intent that he would play for the Pirates in two years. As a sophomore at College of the Canyons, he won All Region III honors (which is selected by the California Community College Football Coaches Association and the Junior College Athletic Bureau) and had 135 rushing attempts for 769 yards (5.7 yards per rushing attempt average), and caught 30 passes for 320 yards (10.67 yards per reception average). His 19 touchdowns that season, and 29 career touchdowns, were both school records. Arrington transferred to University of California, Berkeley as a junior, and played for the California Golden Bears football team in 2003 and 2004. Arrington would receive few carries for most of the 2003 season aside from his 114-yard performance against Southern Mississippi. A knee injury to then starting running back Adimchinobi Echemandu would thrust Arrington into the starting role against the Washington Huskies. This proved to be his breakout game as he mauled the Huskies defense for 185 yards and a touchdown. It took him only 14 carries to achieve this feat. In the first half managed to tally 157 yards on ten carries. He also caught a 30-yard touchdown pass from Aaron Rodgers giving him a total of 215 yards on the day. Despite his performance, he would receive limited carries the rest of the 2003 season. He did play a pivotal role in the Insight Bowl by catching five passes for 38 yards, including a 13-yard touchdown pass that would reduce Virginia Tech's lead to only 28-21 at halftime. Cal would ultimately prevail 52-49 on a game-winning field goal. The 2004 season would see Arrington earn the starting tailback spot after the departure of Echemandu for the NFL. Arrington played a major role in the Cal Bears' first 10-win season since 1949. He would rush for at least 100 yards in every single game that season. Arrington rushed for 169 yards or more in eight of his team's 12 games as well. Ultimately Arrington would have one of the greatest seasons of any running back in NCAA and Pac-10 history, gaining 2,018 rushing yards that season. He became only the third Pac-10 Tailback to gain over 2,000 yards, joining USC tailbacks Marcus Allen and Charles White. His mark is also the tenth best total in NCAA history. He would receive the honor of the Pop Warner Award, deeming him the best College Football player on the west coast. He would also earn All-American and All-Pacific-10 conference honors. Ultimately, the season would end in disappointment. Despite a stellar 10-1 record, they Bears were bypassed for a BCS Bowl bid by The University of Texas. As a result, they played in the Pacific Life Holiday Bowl against a 7-4 Texas Tech squad, where Cal was upset by a score of 45-31, a disappointing end to Arrington's college career. In addition, Arrington was not even invited to the Heisman Trophy ceremony (a distinction afforded the top three to five likely winners) despite having a better statistical year (15 TDs, 2018 yards rushing, 6.98 yards per carry) than the number 2 vote-getter, Adrian Peterson (15 TDs, 1925 yards rushing, 5.68 yards per carry). Professional career=Arizona Cardinals After drafting him in the second round, the Cardinals placed him as the starting running back on the depth chart, with the intention of having him share carries with Marcel Shipp. He started the first game against the New York Giants gaining 5 yards on 8 carries (0.625 average). After this poor showing in his first game, he didn't play a snap the second game of the season against the St. Louis Rams. By the end of the season he had played 15 games with 5 starts, gaining 370 yards on 112 carries (3.3 average) and 2 touchdowns. That following offseason the Cardinals signed Edgerrin James. The Cardinals' drafting of Tim Hightower in 2008 resulted in Arrington being shifted to third place on the depth chart at running back. He became the team's principal kick returner and in Super Bowl XLIII caught 2 passes for 35 yards. Denver Broncos Arrington signed with the Denver Broncos on March 4, 2009. He was released on May 27, 2009 after failing his physical. It was determined that Arrington would need season-ending microfracture surgery on his right knee, following surgery to the same knee in February. He was re- signed on March 4, 2010. Philadelphia Eagles Arrington was traded to the Philadelphia Eagles in exchange for linebacker Joe Mays on July 30, 2010. He was waived on September 3. Due to Arrington being released prior to the start of the season, the Eagles received a 2012 sixth-round draft pick from the Broncos. Las Vegas Locomotives Before the 2011 season, Arrington signed with the Las Vegas Locomotives of the United Football League.

According to the , it has a population of people. Talavera is part of Cabanatuan conurbation as adjacent urban center in the heart of Nueva Ecija. It is dubbed as the \\"Milk Capital\\" and \\"Food basket in Inland Luzon\\" Talavera is one of the fastest growing municipalities in the province and proposals have been planned for cityhood. Given its robust economic growth, Talavera enjoys annual progress and wealth. The town's revenue-generated income as of 2017 is P298,361,401.93 and with over 124,829 inhabitants, the town meets the requirements for cityhood. In July 2019, Congresswoman Estrellita B. Suansing has filed House Bill 184, regarding the cityhood of Talavera. According to the National Competitiveness Council in Cities/Municipalities Competitiveness Index, during the past years, Talavera maintained their rankings as one of the most competitive municipalities in the Philippines. It is bordered by Cabanatuan, Llanera, Mu√±oz, Aliaga, General Mamerto Natividad, Santo Domingo and San Jose. History Present-day Talavera was formerly a barrio of Cabanatuan City. It was called ‚ÄúKatugian‚Äù which means a place abundant in ‚ÄúTugue,‚Äù an edible root crop. The distance between Cabanatuan's town center and Katugian was critical during the early phase of its development although it was only . The parish- curate at that time recommended to the Spanish administrators a separate and independent administration of Katugian. By a royal decree issued on November 12, 1852, the plan making Katugian a town was approved. There was no formal inauguration of the new town in accordance with the royal decree. However, the Augustinian parish-curate of Cabanatuan, Fr. Gregorio Crisostomo, appointed the first officials of the town by sending his co-adjutor, a certain Pedro Estanislao Pascual, to handle the religious phase of the administration of the new town during Sundays and Holidays only. The first barrios that composed the new town were La Torre, Pulong Buli (Now Santo Domingo), Concepcion and Valle. Based on the petition presented to the Alcalde Mayor (governor) of Nueva Ecija, forwarded to the governor general in Manila, the ‚ÄúTalavera of the Crown of the Princess‚Äù was approved on February 17, 1853, by the Governor General. In 1954, Talavera lost some territory when the barrios of General Luna, Morcon, Mabini, Ricarte, Casili, and Picon, together with sitios Plaridel and Bosque were separated to form the town of Llanera along with some territory from Rizal and San Jose. Topography The municipality's terrain is relatively flat, with slope ranging from 0 to 3%. Due to the flat topography, the land is suited for agricultural, commercial or industrial development. Barangays Talavera is politically subdivided into 53 barangays. * Andal Ali√±o * Bagong Sikat * Bagong Silang * Bacal I * Bacal II * Bacal III * Baluga * Bantug * Bantug Hacienda * Basang Hamog * Bugtong na Buli * Bulac * Burnay * Calipahan * Campos * Casulucan Este * Collado * Dimasalang Norte * Dimasalang Sur * Dinarayat * Esguerra District * Gulod * Homestead I * Homestead II * Cabubulaunan * Caaniplahan * Caputican * Kinalanguyan * La Torre * Lomboy * Mabuhay * Maestrang Kikay (Poblacion) * Mamandil * Marcos District (Poblacion) * Matias District(Poblacion) * Matingkis * Minabuyoc * Pag-asa District (Poblacion) * Paludpod * Pantoc Bulac * Pinagpanaan * Poblacion Sur (Poblacion) * Pula * Pulong San Miguel * Sampaloc * San Miguel na Munti * San Pascual * San Ricardo * Sibul * Sicsican Matanda * Tabacao * Tagaytay * Valle There is a moved to include the Barangay Matingkis (Talavera) Bakal 1, Bakal 2 and Bakal 3 to become part of Science City of Munoz which is part of the jurisdiction of the Municipality of Talavera for the reason that the said barangays are geographically and strategically within the Science City of Munoz. This was favored by most of the residents of the said barangays but opposed by the Municipal Government of Talavera. The National Government has an ongoing move to transfer the said barangay to the Science City of Munoz. }} ClimateDemographics=Religion St. Isidore the Worker Parish Majority of Talavera's populace is Roman Catholic, served by St. Isidore the Worker Parish Church (Paroquia de San Isidro Labrador) and chapels in other barangays. Other religious groups have churches and places of worship in the municipality. Economy Public market and stores Talavera's economy focus on the agricultural sector. Palay, onions, and calamansi are their main crops. However, making it progress, economically developed andsprouting business establishment in their poblacion areas are currently addressed the town more productive and sustainable. Many government projects beneficial to the municipality's citizens were constructed, including the Nueva Ecija University of Science and Technology‚ÄîMunicipal Government of Talavera(NEUST‚ÄìMGT), an extension campus of the said university; Talavera Eternal Park, the municipality's cemetery; a town library, and government-run drugstore. Tourist attractions in Talavera are as follows: * Town Plaza *Tren ng Bayan * Crystal Wave Hotel and Resort * DVF Dairy Farm * Isdaan Floating Restaurant Festival= Gatas ng Kalabaw Festival  Carabao's milk festival also known as Gatas ng Kalabaw festival is celebrated annually starting May 12‚Äì15; including feast of the patron Saint Isidore. The festival aims to actively encourage, promote and enhance carabao's milk as a nutrition and livelihood industry. Highlights of the festival are street dancing, followed by float parade, parade of carabaos, carabao race, agri-trade fair, milk drinking contest and ice cream making competition among others.  Semana Santa sa Talavera  During the Holy Week, the members of the church (San Isidro Labrador Parish Church) commemorates Jesus' Paschal mystery. The church even has a community where each member owns a religious image called the Cofradia de la Sagrado Pasion del Nuestro Se√±or. Every Holy Wednesdays and Good Fridays, the members of the Cofradia places the images of their saints in carozzas or karo and exhibits it for the townspeople to witness thru a procession. Transportation There are of national roads, including the Maharlika Highway/Asian Highway 26 that passes through the municipality. Due to its central location, the Municipality of Talavera is one of the pivotal transport points in Central Luzon. Talavera is accessible by all means of land transportation. Regular jeepney trips are from 5:00 am to 9:00 pm. Tricycles are available 24 hours a day. Several bus companies also use the Talavera route from Cagayan Valley and Aurora Province to Manila, Cabanatuan City, San Jose City, Baguio City and other destinations. Health PJGMRCMC Extension Hospital Talavera's populace is served by Talavera General Hospital a National Government Financed Hospital formerly known as Dr. Paulino J. Garcia Memorial Hospital- Talavera Extension Program. Medical and dental clinics also serve the municipality. Education Talavera is served by both public and Departmet of Education-accredited private schools. The largest elementary school is Talavera Central School, also known as Central, which is situated at the town proper.

It has been adopted by numerous games. During its time, it competed with the Unreal Engine; both engines were widely licensed. While id Tech 3 is based on id Tech 2 engine; a large amount of the code was rewritten. Successor id Tech 4 was derived from id Tech 3, as was Infinity Ward's IW engine used in Call of Duty 2 onwards. At QuakeCon 2005, John Carmack announced that the id Tech 3 source code would be released under the GNU General Public License (version 2), and it was released on August 19, 2005. Originally distributed by id via FTP,quake3-1.32b-source.zip the code can be downloaded from id's GitHub account. Features=Graphics Unlike most other game engines released at the time ‚Äî including its primary competitor, the Unreal Engine, id Tech 3 requires an OpenGL-compliant graphics accelerator to run. The engine does not include a software renderer. id Tech 3 introduced spline-based curved surfaces in addition to planar volumes, which are responsible for many of the surfaces present within the game. ;Shaders The graphical technology of the game is based tightly around a \\"shader\\" system where the appearance of many surfaces can be defined in text files referred to as \\"shader scripts.\\" Shaders are described and rendered as several layers, each layer contains a texture, a \\"blend mode\\" which determines how to superimpose it over the previous layer and texture orientation modes such as environment mapping, scrolling, and rotation. These features can readily be seen within the game with many bright and active surfaces in each map and even on character models. The shader system goes beyond visual appearance, defining the contents of volumes (e.g. a water volume is defined by applying a water shader to its surfaces), light emission and which sound to play when a volume is trodden upon. In order to assist calculation of these shaders, id Tech 3 implements a specific fast inverse square root function, which attracted a significant amount of attention in the game development community for its clever use of integer operations. ;Video In-game videos all use a proprietary format called \\"RoQ\\", which was originally created by Graeme Devine, the co-designer of Quake 3, for the game The 11th Hour. Internally RoQ uses vector quantization to encode video and DPCM to encode audio. While the format itself is proprietary it was successfully reverse-engineered in 2001, and the actual RoQ decoder is present in the Quake 3 source code release. RoQ has seen little use outside games based on the id Tech 3 or id Tech 4 engines, but is supported by several video players (such as MPlayer) and a handful of third-party encoders exist. One notable exception is the Unreal Engine-based game Postal 2: Apocalypse Weekend, which uses RoQ files for its intro and outro cutscenes, as well as for a joke cutscene that plays after a mission at the end of part one. ;Models id Tech 3 loads 3D models in the MD3 format. The format uses vertex movements (sometimes called per-vertex animation) as opposed to skeletal animation in order to store animation. The animation features in the MD3 format are superior to those in id Tech 2's MD2 format because an animator is able to have a variable number of key frames per second instead of MD2's standard 10 key frames per second. This allows for more complex animations that are less \\"shaky\\" than the models found in Quake II. Another important feature about the MD3 format is that models are broken up into three different parts which are anchored to each other. Typically, this is used to separate the head, torso and legs so that each part can animate independently for the sake of animation blending (i.e. a running animation on the legs, and shooting animation on the torso). Each part of the model has its own set of textures. The character models are lit and shaded using Gouraud shading while the levels (stored in the BSP format) are lit either with lightmaps or Gouraud shading depending on the user's preference. The engine is able to take colored lights from the lightgrid and apply them to the models, resulting in a lighting quality that was, for its time, very advanced. In the GPLed version of the source code, most of the code dealing with the MD4 skeletal animation files was missing. It is presumed that id simply never finished the format,ioquake3 md4-readme.txt although almost all licensees derived their own skeletal animation systems from what was present. Ritual Entertainment did this for use in the game, Heavy Metal: F.A.K.K.¬≤, the SDK to which formed the basis of MD4 support completed by someone who used the pseudonym Gongo. ;Dynamic shadows The engine is capable of three different kinds of shadows. One just places a circle with faded edges at the characters' feet, commonly known as the \\"blob shadow\\" technique. The other two modes project an accurate polygonal shadow across the floor. The difference between the latter two modes is one's reliance on opaque, solid black shadows while the other mode attempts (with mixed success) to project depth-pass stencil shadow volume shadows in a medium-transparent black. Neither of these techniques clip the shadow volumes, causing the shadows to extend down walls and through geometry. ;Other rendering features Other visual features include volumetric fog, mirrors, portals, decals, and wave-form vertex distortion. Sound id Tech 3s sound system outputs to two channels using a looping output buffer, mixed from 96 tracks with stereo spatialization and Doppler effect. All of the sound mixing is done within the engine, which can create problems for licensees hoping to implement EAX or surround sound support. Several popular effects such as echoes are also absent. A major flaw of the sound system is that the mixer is not given its own thread, so if the game stalls for too long (particularly while navigating the menus or connecting to a server), the small output buffer will begin to loop, a very noticeable artifact. This problem was also present in the Doom 3, Quake, and Quake II engines. Networking id Tech 3 uses a \\"snapshot\\" system to relay information about game \\"frames\\" to the client over UDP. The server updates object interaction at a fixed rate independent of the rate clients update the server with their actions and then attempts to send the state of all objects at that moment (the current server frame) to each client. The server attempts to omit as much information as possible about each frame, relaying only differences from the last frame the client confirmed as received (Delta encoding). All data packets are compressed by Huffman coding with static pre-calculated frequency data to reduce bandwidth use even further. Quake 3 also integrated a relatively elaborate cheat-protection system called \\"pure server.\\" Any client connecting to a pure server automatically has pure mode enabled, and while pure mode is enabled only files within data packs can be accessed. Clients are disconnected if their data packs fail one of several integrity checks. The \`cgame.qvm\` file, with its high potential for cheat- related modification, is subject to additional integrity checks. Developers must manually deactivate pure server to test maps or mods that are not in data packs using the PK3 file format. Later versions supplemented pure server with PunkBuster support, though all the hooks to it are absent from the source code release because PunkBuster is closed source software and including support for it in the source code release would have caused any redistributors/reusers of the code to violate the GPL. Virtual machine id Tech 3 uses a virtual machine to control object behavior on the server, effects and prediction on the client and the user interface. This presents many advantages as mod authors do not need to worry about crashing the entire game with bad code, clients could show more advanced effects and game menus than was possible in Quake II and the user interface for mods was entirely customizable. Virtual machine files are developed in ANSI C, using LCC to compile them to a 32-bit RISC pseudo-assembly format. A tool called q3asm then converts them to QVM files, which are multi-segmented files consisting of static data and instructions based on a reduced set of the input opcodes. Unless operations which require a specific endianness are used, a QVM file will run the same on any platform supported by Quake 3. The virtual machine also contained bytecode compilers for the x86 and PowerPC architectures, executing QVM instructions via an interpreter. ioquake3 specular and normal mapping in ioQuake3, Tremulous 1.3 prerelease client Ioquake3 is a game engine project which aims to build upon the id Tech 3 source code release in order to remove bugs, clean up source code and to add more advanced graphical and audio features via SDL and OpenAL. ioquake3 is also intended to act as a clean base package, upon which other projects may be built. The game engine supports Ogg Vorbis format and video capture of demos in .avi format. The project was started shortly after the source code release with the goal of creating a bug-free, enhanced open source Quake III engine source code distribution upon which new games and projects can be based. In addition, the project aims to provide an improved environment in which Quake III: Arena, the Team Arena expansion pack and all the popular mods can be played. Notable features added by the project include builtin VoIP support, Anaglyph stereo rendering (for viewing with 3D glasses), and numerous security fixes. A list of some of the features is available on the project's website. Ioquake3 has been the basis of several game projects based on the id Tech 3 engine, such as OpenArena (mimicking Quake III Arena), Tremulous, Smokin' Guns, Urban Terror, Turtle Arena and World of Padman as well as game engine projects such as efport (a Star Trek: Voyager ‚Äì Elite Force Holomatch engine recreation project), ioJedi Outcast, ioJedi Academy,ioJedi Academy ioDoom3Iodoom3 and OpenMoHAA.OpenMOHAA The engine and its associated games have been included in several Linux and BSD distributions. The source code for the Return to Castle Wolfenstein and Wolfenstein: Enemy Territory engines was released under the GNU General Public License on August 12, 2010.ftp://ftp.idsoftware.com/idstuff/source/ The ioquake3 developers announced the start of respective engine projects (iortcw,Iortcw compiled packageIortcw source code iowolfet, Enemy territory:LegacyET Legacy source code) soon after. The ioquake3 project has also been used in the academic arena as the basis for a variety of research in institutions such as Stanford University's Center for Computer Research in Music and Acoustics (CCRMA), Notre Dame as the foundation for VR research, and Swinburne University of Technology's Centre for Advanced Internet Architectures. There are even collaborative efforts from researchers at Carnegie Mellon University and the University of Toronto that use ioquake3 as a platform for their published researches. Students have used ioquake3 as the basis for advanced graphics work for their theses, as well, such as Stephan Reiter's work which has even been noted at the LLVM project due to his synthesis of the ioquake3 engine, ray-tracing rendering technique, and LLVM. Though the name \\"ioquake3\\" is based on Ryan \\"Icculus\\" Gordon's site icculus.org, Ryan does not lead the project. Instead, he maintains a mentor role and provides hosting for the mailing lists and the SVN repository used by the project.

The name is an abbreviation of Structured Query Reporter, which suggests its relationship to SQL (Structured Query Language). Any SQL statement can be embedded in an SQR program.  History  In the early 80's SQR was a 'free' add-on to Gupta's SQLBase. At the time SQLBase was the only relational database that ran on IBM PCs (x86) machines. SQR was written by Israel Stern in Cleveland, Ohio, probably around 1984 or 1985. SQ Software created SQR in the mid 1980s. It had a marketing agreement with D & N Systems, which changed its name to SQL Solutions and was later acquired by Sybase Inc in the early 1990s. To avoid competing directly with Oracle Corporation, Sybase had a marketing and development agreement with MITI for the Oracle database compatible versions of SQR. MITI acquired the full rights to SQR in the mid-1990s. MITI changed its name to SQRiBE Technologies in 1997. Brio Technology acquired SQRiBE in August, 1999. Brio Technology later changed its name to Brio Software. Brio licensed its source code to PeopleSoft Inc. sometime around 2000. Hyperion Solutions Corporation acquired Brio Software in October, 2003.

It can embed any SQL statement almost anywhere in a program. One configuration of SQR can access multidimensional databases such as Essbase. It can combine database reads with print instructions, flexibly format data and page breaks, and print variable fonts, sizes, and colors. SQR contains a graph generation command that offers dozens of parameters for adjusting content and appearance.  Syntax  SQR has four scalar data types. The first three are numeric (variables begin with ‚Äú#‚Äù), character string (variables begin with ‚Äú$‚Äù), and date (variables begin with ‚Äú$‚Äù, same as with character string variables.). Date variables must be declared, to be distinguished from character string variables. Numeric variables may be of more specific types: integer, floating point,...). Database column variables begin with ‚Äú&‚Äù. The values of database columns are set only by a SQL ‚Äúselect‚Äù statement; no other command can change their values. SQR has an array data structure. An array has one or more fields, each of one of the available types. Each field may have multiple occurrences, giving SQR the equivalent of two-dimensional arrays. SQR has commands that manipulate multiple items within a single array. SQR has four control structures. The first three are if-else- end, while-end, and evaluate. The fourth is the embedded SQL ‚Äúselect‚Äù statement, which allows SQR statements to be executed for each row of data in a loop. SQR has commands to open, read, write, append, and close computer files. File input and output is sequential and record-oriented only; random access is not supported.

Fictional character biography=Negative Zone versions During one of his adventures, Spider- Man travelled to the Negative Zone. While there, he befriended a group of rebels battling the tyrannical Blastaar. Their leader had been a hero called Dusk who wore a completely black costume. Dusk's name and costume had in fact been taken up by a series of people as a symbol of freedom--but the latest man to take up Dusk's mantle had been killed by Blastarr's forces shortly after Spider-Man's arrival. At the rebels' request, Spider-Man wore the costume and led the rebels to victory. When he returned to the normal universe, he still had the costume. Later, a new Dusk took up the name and costume in the Negative Zone. Peter Parker When Spider-Man was accused of murder during the Identity Crisis storyline,The Amazing Spider-Man #434-435, The Sensational Spider-Man #27-28, Peter Parker: Spider-Man #91-92, The Spectacular Spider-Man #257-258 (May ‚Äì June 1998) Peter Parker donned several different costumes to continue saving lives without anyone knowing it was him; one of the adopted identities was that of Dusk. As Dusk, Peter pretended to be a mercenary with a quiet and serious personality, and teamed up with the Trapster who had in fact framed him for murder under Norman Osborn's orders by using a duplicate of Spider-Man's webbing to kill the small-time crook Joey Z. After helping the Trapster escape an attack from the Shocker, Trapster and Dusk became regular allies, taking out some of Osborn's various criminal activities across the city. Although Dusk failed to record a confrontation between Trapster and Osborn where Osborn admitted a role in the murder, Dusk was able to convince Trapster that the best way to hurt Osborn now was to admit his role in framing Spider-Man for Joey Z's murder. When he cleared his name, Peter abandoned the costume. Although the hero Black Marvel later gave a duplicate Dusk costume to Cassie St. Commons,Slingers # 0-12 (Nov. 1998 - Nov. 1999) the original remained in Peter's possession and has not been worn/seen since. Cassie St. Commons Cassie St. Commons first appeared in Slingers #0 (Dec 1998). Cassie was a college student at ESU with jet black hair, facial tattoos, and nose and tongue piercings. She was invited to join the Slingers, and was presented with the Dusk costume by the Black Marvel. She accepted, but had to undertake an \\"initiation\\" into the group by making a heroic leap across the rooftop of one building and land on another. While her teammates, Prodigy, Ricochet, and Hornet all had powers (or equipment) that enabled them to easily make the jump, she did not. When the others were distracted, Cassie did not actually jump, but instead purposefully fell to her death. But Cassie was reborn, no longer dead, but not truly alive. She was Dusk. She found that she could teleport anywhere in a swirl of shadows, and she had some kind of psychic awareness that enabled her to feel her teammates. When she returned, her fellow Slingers were shocked to see their friend back from the dead. But being dead didn't stop Dusk from developing a crush on Ricochet, or having Hornet fall in love with her. But she kept both boys at a distance, since she felt that they couldn't know what it was like to be alive, yet not have a heartbeat. Dusk's powers began to evolve to the point where she could use her powers to transport other people, and manipulate shadows, and she proved herself to be an invaluable ally. Her talent to sense the location and well- being of her teammates saved Hornet, when she \\"knew\\" that he was captured by a killer rat-man. When she learned that Black Marvel had been taken by Mephisto, she was shocked. When she learned that her costume was given to Black Marvel by the demon, she was horrified. But Dusk used her control over the darkness to help her team free Black Marvel's soul from Mephisto when he was captured. The team disbanded, and Dusk left to discover what she truly was.Slingers #0-12 Dusk was next seen being held captive by the Puppet Master. Puppet Master used an improved version of his magic clay to capture various women, including female heroes and villains along with Stature, Ara√±a, Tigra, and Silverclaw, and hold them in a state of suspended animation. He intended to sell the captives off as \\"interactive art\\". Dusk made no further appearances during the storyline, which concluded with Puppet Master's defeat and the release of his other captives. Her current whereabouts are again unknown.Ms. Marvel vol. 2 #18-20 Meanwhile, in the Loners series, it was shown that Mattie Franklin had been hired by Cassie's parents to find out if Ricochet knew the whereabouts of their daughter. During the scene that revealed this, a female shadow resembling Dusk was visible behind Mattie.Loners #5 Following the \\"Secret Empire\\" storyline, Dusk returns after the apparent resurrection of the Hornet where she assists Ricochet and the Scarlet Spider in confronting the demonic monster summoned by the new Hornet, drawing the creature into herself and apparently destroying itBen Reilly: Scarlet Spider #10. She joined the team in their plan to 'blackmail' the Scarlet Spider into surrendering himself to the authorities for his attack on Silas Thorne.Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider #11 She soon realizes that their apparently-resurrected mentor Black Marvel has no soul and that Hornet is actually Cyber who was resurrected by an as- yet-unidentified entity that was posing as Black Marvel.Ben Reilly: Scarlet Spider #12 After the Black Marvel is defeated, Dusk asks to talk with the Scarlet Spider about MysterioBen Reilly: The Scarlet Spider #13. Powers and abilities In addition to his regular abilities, the Dusk costume allowed Peter Parker to become virtually invisible in the shadows and glide short distances. Cassie St. Commons has many supernatural abilities. Her primary power is the ability to teleport herself (or others) anywhere she wishes to be. She can manipulate shadows to form objects or constructs of solid dark energy, a power she used to great effectiveness during the battle against Mephisto's horde of demons. She also can regenerate damaged tissue and she has a clairvoyant ability to sense the whereabouts of her teammates, and know if they are in danger, no matter how far away she is from them. She claims that she is able to tell whether or not others have souls due to her own experience of being dead.

There are at least a dozen schools of traditional flower arrangements. Introduction Formal flower arrangements were closely allied to the development of the Korean tea ceremony, and suggestions have been made that these were often corner-of-the- room arrangements on small tables using a central vessel with most often a small branch and a small group of local flowers. Sprigs of pear blossoms were particularly well known, and during the winters ever-green sprigs that would have enhanced celadon ware, or given a cool elegance to whiteware. Leaves, blossoms, ferns, and grasses were also used. Arrangements were primarily done by women in tea-houses and in the greater houses, Confucian male masters may have done this as well. History This floral art was not documented before the 14th century as a distinct art. Votive altar arrangements of flowers for Buddhist temples were precursors. But it was under Confucian hands, in Joseon Yi dynasty times, that arrangements can be said definitely to have begun and were known, and included in illustrations by artists of that time.

It is the second book in The Deptford Histories trilogy, a series of prequels to Jarvis's Deptford Mice books. It was first published in the United Kingdom in 1993 by Macdonald Young Books. In 2005, it was published in the United States by Chronicle Books. Plot summary In medieval England, a war has raged between the bats and the squirrels for many years. The bats believe that the Starwife, queen of the squirrels, has stolen their powers of prophecy and insight, given to them as a gift from the moon goddess. With the help of a treacherous squirrel named Morwenna, they launch a devastating attack on the Starwife's realm, Greenreach. The dying Starwife entrusts her magical silver acorn pendant to a peregrine falcon, who bears it away to safety. Meanwhile, in a faraway squirrel realm known as Coll Regalis, the inhabitants are celebrating a holiday called Aldertide. Crown princess Ysabelle, a beautiful black squirrel maiden, is excited to participate in the festivities. But soon an army of bats appears flying overhead. They are in pursuit of the falcon, determined to retrieve the silver acorn at all costs. The bats savagely murder the bird, and its mangled corpse falls to the ground beside the terrified Ysabelle. Then the silver acorn drops into her palm. Though the bats try to attack Ysabelle, the daylight confuses them and they resolve to return at nightfall. Ysabelle shows the amulet to her parents, who know that this is an ill omen, meaning that the Starwife is dead and Greenreach has fallen. Because Ysabelle is the one who caught the acorn pendant, it is decided that she will journey to Greenreach and become the new Starwife. She will be accompanied by all the guards of Coll Regalis, with those left behind to fight an unwinnable battle when the bats come back that night. This they willing do as a distraction while Ysabelle's entourage escapes. On their way through the forest, Ysabelle's guards come across a juvenile bat named Vespertilio. Too young to be a knight, he has run away from home with his late father's armour in hopes of joining the battle at Greenreach. But the armour proved too heavy while he was flying and he tumbled to the ground and broke his wing. Though Ysabelle detests the bat, when her adviser Godfrey suggests that Vespertilio could be used as a guide, she agrees to take him along as a prisoner. In the night, the group is attacked by Hobbers, members of a bloodthirsty cult. Several squirrels are taken to be ritually sacrificed, with the high priest calling for the cult's evil deity, Hobb, to rise up from the Underworld. When Godfrey sees that the high priest has Ysabelle's amulet, he is horrified and tells her that with its tremendous powers, it could indeed bring Hobb into the world. Godfrey hastily comes up with a plan to retrieve the acorn, which is successful but results in his death. Ysabelle escapes into the forest, stopping first to untie Vesper and force him to accompany her as she is now alone with no one else left to show her the way to Greenreach. The high priest appears, but is unable to reach the two as they are within a stream protected by the powers of the benevolent deity known as the Green. Furious, he lays curses on the two of them, proclaiming that when Hobb emerges from the ground he will kill Ysabelle and that Vesper will die surrounded by the sound of bells. Later, Ysabelle and Vespertilio meet a mole and shrew who are on a pilgrimage to Greenreach. The mole, Giraldus, has leprosy and is nearly blind, and the shrew, Tysle Symkyn, is his guide in gratitude for the former having saved his life. As they are bound for the same place, Ysabelle asks to accompany Giraldus and Tysle, telling Vespertilio he is free to go. But he chooses to stay with the group, having secretly developed a growing fondness for Ysabelle. After being chased by Hobbers on a nightmarish journey through the woods, Ysabelle is reunited with Wendel Maculatum, a stoat jester she befriended at the Aldertide celebrations in Coll Regalis. He says he has heard that a group of woodlanders have risen up in resistance to the Hobbers, and that their base is somewhere nearby. Upon reaching it, they meet the warrior mouse Fenlyn Purfote, who is at first suspicious of the group, but when the Ancient, messenger of the moon goddess, has an audience with Ysabelle and Vespertilio, he is convinced they are telling the truth. The Ancient says that the great war has been fought in vain, for it was not the Starwife who stole the bats' power away from them, but their own leader Hrethel. The only way for the Hobbers to be defeated is if the bats and squirrels team up and fight them together. Tysle turns up dead, and it is revealed that Wendel Maculatum, in reality the high priest of Hobb, murdered him. Mad with grief, Giraldus attacks Wendel and the two engage in a fight. Wendel easily gains the upper hand over the disabled mole but Giraldus causes the tunnel they're in to collapse completely, killing the high priest and sacrificing his life in the process. Vespertilio and Ysabelle escape and finally arrive in Greenreach, where Morwenna tricks Ysabelle into following her into a chamber deep beneath the Hallowed Oak. Revealing herself as a Hobber, she steals the silver acorn and leaves Ysabelle to be devoured by toads. Vespertilio rescues Ysabelle and the two emerge to see the bat and squirrel armies engaged in battle. Using special herbs given to him by the Ancient, Vespertilio creates a beacon fire which draws the bats and squirrels. They are shocked when he kisses Ysabelle, and listen in amazement to what he has to tell them. Though the bats are initially appalled that he would accuse Hrethel of treachery, they soon realise that it would explain a lot. As Hobbers surge up the hill, the bats and squirrels finally come together to fight their common enemy. Suddenly, the gigantic horned rat god Hobb emerges from the earth, much to everyone's horror. As Morwenna is the one presently wearing the silver acorn, not Ysabelle, Hobb mistakes her for his intended victim and incinerates her by breathing fire. Upon reclaiming the discarded pendant, Ysabelle performs the ritual that gives her all the powers of the Starwifeship, then confronts Hobb. She casts a spell that imprisons him in an acorn before collapsing from exhaustion. Weeks later, Greenreach is being restored to its former glory for Ysabelle's coronation day. Vespertilio arrives and asks to speak with her. He professes his love and asks her to run away with him, but she declines, telling him that her duty is more important. Left alone, the despondent Vespertilio is offered a drink by a cloaked stranger. He takes it, only to find to his horror that the drink is poison and the stranger is the ghost of Wendel Maculatum, having returned from the dead to ensure his curse was fulfilled. Meanwhile, all through the coronation ceremony, thoughts of the young bat fill Ysabelle's mind. Ultimately she publicly refuses the Starwifeship and races to find Vespertilio. She is heartbroken to find him lying dead, surrounded by bluebell flowers. Development The Final Reckoning, the third book in the original Deptford Mice trilogy, mentions a long ago war between the bats and squirrels. In writing The Oaken Throne, Jarvis \\"wanted to finally tell that story properly.\\" Per his usual technique, he sketched his cast of characters before writing about them. Giraldus the mole and his loyal friend Tysle the shrew were the first ones Jarvis drew, and would become his favorite characters in the story. He \\"was also very pleased with the Hobbers, they were all so vile and despicable.\\" Jarvis has clarified that Ysabelle is not the elderly Starwife who appears in the Deptford Mice books. Reception Sally Estes of Booklist described The Oaken Throne as \\"darker in tone than the previous book, with full of terrifying and gory scenes, but it is also filled with inspiring heroics, and its sentient characters are true to their animal natures.\\" Kirkus Reviews called it \\"a perfect choice for fans of the Redwall series ready for richer fare.\\" Christine McGinty of School Library Journal said that \\"readers will have a hard time putting down this dark, gripping tale of love, treachery, and the clashing forces of good versus evil. This second book in the series stands completely on its own. The well-rounded characters enhance the excellent plot, which is sure to keep readers on the edge of their seats up to the very last page.\\" ReferencesExternal links * http://www.sjcs.co.uk/Book%20Reviews/agerange%2012-13/The%20Oaken%20Throne.html Category:1993 British novels Category:British fantasy novels Category:Novels by Robin Jarvis Category:The Deptford Mice series Category:Fictional squirrels Category:Fictional bats Category:Fictional cults Category:Novels set in the Middle Ages ","title":"The Oaken Throne"},{"id":"1862103","text":"Laurie William Daley AM (born 20 October 1969), also known by the nicknames of \\"Lozza\\" and \\"Loz\\", is an Australian professional rugby league football coach and a former player who played as a and in the 1980s and 1990s. He represented Australia on 26 occasions and has since been named as one of the nation's finest of the 20th century. Daley played for the Canberra Raiders during their most successful period in the 1990s. Background Daley was born in Junee, New South Wales, Australia to a white father from the small village of Nangus, New South Wales and an Aboriginal mother of the former Aboriginal Mission Wantabadgery, Wantabadgery, New South Wales. Laurie is the third youngest of eight children. He is the only boy amongst seven sisters. Daley was playing representative rugby league before his 19th birthday in 1988 when he was selected to represent NSW Country in the annual City vs Country Origin game. He was the second highest try-scorer in the 1989 NSWRL season with sixteen tries, only one less than team mate Gary Belcher. He tasted premiership success with the Raiders 1989 in an extra-time game which saw Canberra defeat the Balmain Tigers 19-14, and in the ensuing celebrations the Winfield Cup was smashed, not by Daley dropping it as was reported by the press, but when it fell from the rear tray of Ford T bucket hot rod both were riding in when the hot rod hit a bump in the road. In the post season he travelled with the Raiders to England for the 1989 World Club Challenge, playing at centre in Canberra's 18-30 loss to Widnes at the Old Trafford stadium in Manchester. Daley played his first games for New South Wales in the 1989 State of Origin series. 1990s Part way through the 1990 NSWRL Premiership season Daley made his first appearance for Australian at against France in the NSW country town of Parkes, scoring a try on d√©but. He would then play against New Zealand a month later in Wellington. At the end of the 1990 season where the Raiders won their second consecutive Grand Final, Daley won the Raiders' player of the year award and was then selected for the 1990 Kangaroo Tour. He missed Australia's opening loss to Great Britain at Wembley Stadium due to a broken hand suffered in a previous tour match against Leeds, but played centre for three tests on tour (two against Great Britain and one against France). The broken hand, and later a hamstring injury which saw him miss the second Test against France, restricted him to just 6 games on tour, 3 club games (against St Helens, Wigan and Leeds) and the 3 tests. During the 1990 season, Canberra coach Tim Sheens shifted Daley from centre to five-eighth at the Raiders and popular theory was that he was being groomed to eventually take over the Test five-eighth role from Wally Lewis who was coming to the end of his career. Daley helped the Raiders to back-to-back premierships when they defeated Penrith 18‚Äì14 in the Grand Final at the Sydney Football Stadium. Following the Kangaroo Tour, Daley suffered a number of niggling injuries during the early part of the 1991 season, though he played well enough to retain his place in the NSW side for the 1991 State of Origin series (won 2‚Äì1 by Queensland), and although overlooked for the opining Trans-Tasman series test against New Zealand in Melbourne, was recalled into the side in the centres for the final two tests in Sydney and at Lang Park in Brisbane. After losing in Melbourne, the Australians (with Daley one of their stars) won 44‚Äì0 in Sydney and 40‚Äì12 in Brisbane. Canberra then limped into the Finals in defence of their crown, but suddenly found form and won high scoring games over Manly-Warringah and North Sydney to again face Penrith in the Grand Final. However, with Ricky Stuart taking a groin injury into the game and Daley doing the same with a dodgy hamstring, the Raiders were eventually no match for the Royce Simmons and Greg Alexander inspired Panthers who won the day 19‚Äì12. Daley's injury meant he was ruled out of the season ending Kangaroo tour of Papua New Guinea. During the 1992 Great Britain Lions tour of Australia and New Zealand, he helped Australia retain The Ashes. Affected severely by a knee injury in 1992, which saw him unable to fulfill his contract at Wakefield Trinity, and miss Australia's World Cup Final win over Great Britain at Wembley following the 1992 NSWRL season, 1992 also saw Daley take over the captaincy of the NSW Origin team and after being knocked out during the first game in Sydney, Daley recovered to lead the Blues to a 2‚Äì1 series win over Queensland now captained by Canberra team mate and Australian team captain Mal Meninga. Daley recovered from injury to captain Australia in the absence of suspended captain Meninga in the first Test against New Zealand in 1993, kicking the match-saving field goal and saving Australia from an embarrassing 14‚Äì13 loss (it was also his second field goal of the game). 1994 was again plagued by injury. For the third year running he captained NSW to an Origin series win over Queensland, before representing Australia in a mid season test against France at the Parramatta Stadium in Sydney. Following the test Daley underwent knee surgery, and recovered in time to help the Raiders easily win the Grand Final over Canterbury-Bankstown 36-12, scoring a 50-metre try in the first half and showing that he was back to 100% fitness. Following the Grand Final win, Daley was selected, along with six of his Canberra team-mates (Kangaroo captain Meninga, Ricky Stuart, Steve Walters, Brett Mullins and David Furner), to the successful 1994 Kangaroo Tour. As the incumbent NSW captain, Daley was selected as the vice-captain on the tour. His 1994 tour was a happier one than 1990 with Daley playing in 9 games including all 4 tests on the tour. In 1995, Ricky Stuart was preferred for the Canberra captaincy after Meninga's retirement , even though Daley had captained both New South Wales and Australia ahead of Stuart. Furthermore, the outbreak of the Super League War and Daley's subsequent support for the rival organisation saw him barred from representative games in 1995, including the World Cup at the end of the season. This was despite Daley and other Super League aligned players successfully taking the Australian Rugby League to court in a bid to be eligible for selection. While the ARL was forced to consider SL players, they weren't forced to select them, thus players like Daley missed a full year of representative games. Nonetheless, Daley was awarded the Raiders' player of the year award in 1995, 1996 and 1997. In 1996, Super League players were once again allowed to compete in representative fixtures sanctioned by the ARL, allowing Daley to compete in State of Origin. Even though Daley was the incumbent New South Wales captain from 1992-1994, Brad Fittler, who had also been appointed Australian captain in 1995, was retained as NSW captain. The following year, the Super League competition was launched, and Daley was appointed to captain the Super League representative teams of both New South Wales and Australia, winning their respective competitions. It was also this year Daley became a father, welcoming daughter Jaimee Frances Daley into the world on 27 May. In the opening match of the Super League Test series against Great Britain at the end of the 1997 season, The Australian side wore black armbands in memory of Daley's grandmother who'd died two days before. He captained the side and scored a hat-trick that match in The Kangaroos' emphatic victory. Daley alo scored a try in Australia‚Äôs victory in the third and deciding match. In 1998, Super League and the Australian Rugby League agreed to combine to launch the National Rugby League competition. Daley took over the Canberra captaincy on a full-time basis after Stuart signed with Canterbury in 1999 and was once again named the Raiders' player of the year. This was also the year Laurie married his wife Michelle and welcomed their first daughter, Caitlin Rose Daley, on 17 December 1999. Although Daley continued to make representative appearances, injuries began to limit his opportunities; and he was forced into retirement in 2000. In September of that year, his book, Laurie: Always a Winner was published. Post-playing From 2008-2012 he was the coach of the NSW Country Origin team. Laurie Daley working for the Nine Network In September 2007, Daley left his commentary position with Fox Sports and signed a contract with the Nine Network to co- present much of their rugby league coverage, from appearing on the weekly rugby league topic show The Footy Show, to commentating on Nine's weekend league coverage. In 2010, after New South Wales suffered their fifth consecutive series defeat and their first Origin whitewash (a series lost 0-3) , he was sacked as the state's team selector. However, on 21 August 2012 Daley was appointed the NSW State of Origin coach from 2013, taking over from former Canberra team mate Ricky Stuart who, under NSW policy of their Origin coach not being a current NRL club coach, was ruled out after agreeing to coach the Parramatta Eels in 2013. Daley got the job in preference to other candidates including Trent Barrett, Brad Fittler and Daniel Anderson. Daley led the Blues to their first series win in 2014, finally breaking the QLD dynasty and delivering the Blues their first series win since 2005. In 2014, Daley became only the second man after Wayne Pearce to play, captain and coach a Blues side to a series win over Queensland. In 2015, Daley coached New South Wales to a game 3 decider against Queensland after a spirited comeback in Game 2 but The Blues were defeated 52-6 in a record breaking Origin loss. In 2016, New South Wales were once again defeated by Queensland but the NSWRL board still backed Daley as the man to take the side forward. In 2017, NSW were widely tipped to win the series due to Queensland having suffered injuries to star players and won the first game with an emphatic 28-4 victory in Brisbane. In game 2, New South Wales surrendered a 16-6 halftime lead to lose 18-16. In game 3, NSW lost the series to Queensland after being defeated 22-6 in Brisbane. On 25 August 2017, Daley was terminated as New South Wales coach after only winning 6 out of 15 games and winning only 1 out of 5 series. His replacement was Brad Fittler who has since coached NSW to two consecutive series victories over the Queensland Maroons(2018&2019) Since February 2018, Daley has co-hosted the Big Sports Breakfast on Sky Sports Radio in Sydney.Laurie Daley ready to begin as host of Big Sports Breakfast Daily Telegraph 22 February 2018 In March 2018, Daley returned to commentating with NRL Nation, a syndicated Rugby League Radio call owned and run by Crocmedia. Since July 2018, he joined CBS Sports as co-host of Sports Tonight on Network 10. Accolades In February 2008, Daley was named in the list of Australia's 100 Greatest Players (1908‚Äì2007) which was commissioned by the NRL and ARL to celebrate the code's centenary year in Australia. In August 2008, Daley was named at five-eight in the Indigenous Team of the Century. On 11 January 2013, the local football ground in his home town of Junee was renamed Laurie Daley Oval.

However, the pacific viperfish has been found in the mesopelagic region, above the bathypelagic. In daytime it can be found from 200-5000 m below the ocean surface. At night it swims up into shallower depths of less than 200m where food is more plentiful. Pacific viperfish do not have a particular fish that they mainly feed on, but they will go after crustaceans, plankton, shrimp, small fish and occasionally will catch a larger fish. The pacific viperfish is one of the nine different species that belong to the genus Chauliodus or Viperfish. The pacific viperfish tend to be the largest of the species, typically reaching lengths of up to 1 foot and are considered an example of deep-sea gigantism. The pacific viperfish is classified as one of the most ferocious deep seas fish for its size. They are iridescent dark silver-blue color in life with pale fins. They can also be a light black color with blue fins. Looking at the mouth and curvature of teeth one can easily recognize the pacific viperfish. The fangs of the pacific viper are abnormally long that its jaw is extended out, so its teeth can fit outside of its mouth. The fangs rest near the viper‚Äôs eyes. These fangs are the viper‚Äôs way of killing fish, the viper will swim at high speeds at its prey and impale them in the process. High speed collisions and force in bites have cause the viperfish to adapt to high impact. The vertebrae that is located right behind its head is used a shock absorber, very similar to an air bag. They are excellent maneuvers in areas that receive significantly less sunlight than uppermost regions. This is accredited to a protein in the rods known as Rhodopsins, composed of the transmembrane protein opsin, and a chromophore (Yokoyama, S., Tada, T., Zhang, H., & Britt, L., 2008).  Hunting and feeding  According to O'Day (1973) luminescent silhouetting may aid the fish in mating, spacing themselves out as they hunt, maintaining conspecific aggregations, warning potential predators of their own formidable size, or perhaps allowing them to escape from predators by temporarily blinding them. These functions, however, remain speculative.O'Day, W. T. (1973). Luminescent silhouetting in stomiatoid fishes. Contributions in Science, 246. Natural History Museum, Los Angeles County PDF. The photophore is found on the dorsal fin of the pacific viper. The photophore uses bioluminescence to produce light to entice a victim. The prey is attracted to the flickering light like a fishing lure. Along with the extended photophore on the dorsal fin, the viperfish also carries photophores on side and underneath its body. The lights underneath provide a camouflage to fish from below. The photophore also serves as a communication tool; it is used by the viperfish to signal a mate or ward off potential rivals in the area. The pacific viper utilizes the low visibility and darkness to its advantage for hunting tactics. The pacific viper lies motionless in the darkness and waves its blinking lure over its head waiting on its meal to arrive. Their stomach is quite large, and they have low basal metabolic rates which enables them to go days without food and store up on food.  Reproduction  Little is known on pacific viperfish reproductions due to the depths it lives at. Due to darkness and limited mates it is best suited that the pacific viper externally spawn (biology) or oviparous. Females will release eggs into the water which the male will fertilize. The number of eggs and larvae produced by the female is determined by the temperature of the water and concentration of salt. Spawning is believed to occur year-round but with spikes of young larvae during January and March. When an offspring is born it is about six millimeters long. Offspring‚Äôs are expected to defend themselves until they are mature. Parasite on the pacific viperfish Parasites As most fish species, the Pacific viperfish has several parasites. In 2018, Susumu Ohtsuka, Dhugal J. Lindsay and Kunihiko Izawa described a new genus and species of pennellid copepod, Protosarcotretes nishikawai, from a single ovigerous female infecting a Pacific viperfish collected from the deep-waters of Suruga Bay, Japan. According to the authors, the new genus had the most plesiomorphic states in the first to fourth legs of pennellid copepods.  Captivity  Viperfish are not an endangered species, but they are preyed on by some dolphin and shark species. They are also unable to live in captivity because of the extreme pressure differences within the environment. Pacific viperfish have been recorded living from 15‚Äì40 years in their natural habitat. A few species have been captured, but only lasted a couple hours before dying. References  Yokoyama, S., Tada, T., Zhang, H., & Britt, L. (2008).

It is the 18th book in the Redwall series. Plot summary The novel begins with Riggu Felis, wildcat warlord of Green Isle, and his two sons, Jeefra and Pitru, attempting to kill an osprey, later known to be Pandion Piketalon. Riggu scorns his sons' attempts to kill the osprey and jumps into the fray himself, attempting to scare it into submission. The osprey is not intimidated and sinks his talons into the cat's face, flying into the air with him. The wildcat drops to the ground with half of his face torn off. Because of this incident, the wildcat orders all birds on Green Isle to be slain. Tiria Wildlough is daughter of Banjon Wildlough, the Skipper of Otters at Redwall Abbey. One afternoon, she and a few friends go out into Mossflower Woods to gather some wood, and along the way they run into some trouble in the form of a small but ferocious vermin band terrorizing Pandion. Tiria and her friends manage to fight them off, but the vermin swear revenge. US cover of High Rhulain When Tiria returns to Redwall, she and her father have a discussion, where Tiria learns that otter law allows only male otters to be Skippers. This upsets Tiria greatly, and she is quick to listen when Martin the Warrior and High Queen Rhulain Wildlough appear to her in a dream, telling her the otters of Green Isle need her assistance and leadership. After deciphering and scouring the Abbey for many clues with Old Quelt, Sister Snowdrop, Abbess Lycian, Brinty, Tribsy, and Girry, Tiria learns through another dream that she has to leave on her own, so she heads to Log-a-Log Urfa's encampment along with her father and Brink Greyspoke. Soon after, Brinty is killed when the aforementioned vermin band attacks Redwall, seeking vengeance. At the same time, a rogue otter named Leatho Shellhound leads the free otter clans in various attacks against the ruling wildcats in an attempt to free their enslaved friends. Many famous otter clans take part, including Galedeep (related to Finnbarr Galedeep of The Bellmaker), Streambattle (related to Rab of The Bellmaker), and Wavedog (related to Kroova of Triss). However, Finnbarr and Kroova were sea otters, and Finnbarr had no known living kin. Log-a-Log Urfa takes Tiria to Cuthbert Blanedale Frunk, a Long Patrol hare in the service of Lord Mandoral Highpeak at Salamandastron, where she receives a sling from the Badger Lord made of shark skin and the breastplate of the High Rhulain. Along with the a number of hares of the Long Patrol, Tiria sails to Green Isle in Frunk's ship, the Purloined Petunia, and they meet up with Shellhound and his otter clans. At the abbey, the Redwallers continue to solve riddles from Sister Geminya, finding Corriam Wildlough's lance and the High Rhulain's coronet. Brantalis Skyfurrow, a visiting goose, flies the crown to Tiria at Green Isle. When Tiria reaches Green Isle, she finds the otter clans in a stand-off with Riggu. Leatho Shellhound is trapped in a burning tower, set afire by Riggu's mate, Lady Kaltag, who lost her mind after the loss of her son, Jeefra. The birds Pandion and Brantalis save Leatho, but Riggu shortly after slays Pandion, who had previously ripped off part of his face, forcing him to wear a mask. Tiria, seeing Pandion killed, hurls the barbed star that first injured Pandion at Riggu, and with amazing accuracy, she strikes and kills Riggu Felis. Meanwhile, Riggu's other son Pitru had taken some forces and led them out of the burning fortress. Pitru establishes himself as the new warlord among the wildcats. Knowing the otters will now return to where their families are hiding, Pitru builds a barricade square in the route that the otter clans have to take in order to rejoin their families. With the help of newly freed Leatho Shellhound, Lorgo Galedeep, Kolun Galedeep, and Banya Streamdog, Tiria routes the remaining vermin forces. Sadly, however, Cuthbert dies bringing down a Nessie-type monster Slothunog, and Pitru with him. Recovering from this loss, Tiria is later proclaimed by all as the new High Rhulain of Green Isle.

Governor Sir Lawrence Guillemard conceived the idea of bringing people together from the Malaya peninsula and Borneo for the purpose of enhancing trade and other mutual benefits. \\"It was also felt that the opportunity was a fitting one for the exhibition, by the commercial and foreign communities, of imported goods in illustration of the varied trade activities of this country in general, and of the great exchange port of Singapore in particular.\\" Malaya Borneo Exhibition Singapore: Official Guide (Singapore: 1922) The Straits Budget described the details of the Planning and Layout of the site situated on reclaimed land adjacent to the Telok Ayer Basin in Singapore. \\"The large scale on which the Malaya-Borneo Exhibition, which is to be held in April has been arranged, as regards the variety of the exhibits, and the collecting together of arts and crafts, industries with trades of all nationalities, is of necessity occasioning a great deal of work on the part of those engaged in the planning and lay-out of the site in Robinson Road. The area of the site is 65 acres. It extends from Telok Ayer Market to Mount Palmer, a distance of 900 yards. The width, to be covered by the exhibition between Anson Road and the sea is 530 yards and between the main entrance opposite McCallum Street and the sea is 270 yards. These dimensions are on an equality with the dimensions of international exhibitions. Although much of the Ground appeared open and easy for free planning, in actuality there were many deciding and limiting factors. For example, the massive concrete flooring which had been used for the Goliath cranes and the making of caissons for the reclamation work, is an immovable fixture, altogether 900 feet in length and 65 feet in width. This has been utilised for large exhibition plots, the buildings on which will form one side of the main avenue. Then again, a groan of concrete cylinders have been turned to advantage for they have been surrounded with granite stones and filled up with earth and are now in process of being converted into a picturesque rock garden. The Stadium The many details of the planning might lend one at first to imagine that it is a garden city that is in course of construction rather than a trade exhibition, for numerous picturesque features are being arranged. A number of pleasant trees not far from Telok Ayer have been ‚Äúplanted‚Äù so as to form an attractive oval filled with foliage, and in the centre of which will he erected a grandstand. This is in the centre of the Borneo and Dayak groups. It was essential also to have a large padang or stadium and the choice of site was limited to some area in the centre of the exhibition, to be non-interfering with the general flow of traffic to be drainable and fairly level, and also, so placed as to be a striking feature of the general plan. The stadium as planned, and now in course of preparation, will he a grass ellipse in width, surrounded by a 60 feet circular road. There will thus be provision for a full-sized football ground on which football matches will be played. On one side will be erected a grandstand, about 140 feet long, facing east towards the main entrance so as to avoid spectators being troubled by the afternoon sun; while on the opposite side of the stadium will be an enclosure for the band. A movable platform is being provided for the centre of the stadium, so that, without discomfort, some five thousand will be able to witness the Dayak and other native dances which will be given there. The tea gardens are to be an attractive feature of this part of the exhibition. With regard to the trade exhibition itself, every endeavour is being made to allocate to each nationality and group of exhibitors equally effective sites. What might he called the national group, each having its own focussed grouping of buildings are as follows Malay, Chinese, Arabian, Indian, Japanese, European shops, Dayaks, Bornean shops. General Effect The main entrance will be in Robinson Road, the approach place from the road being over 100 yards wide. On entering the Exhibition one will look down a long avenue terminating in a triumphal arch through which the distant sea will be visible. To the left the main avenue bordered by exhibits will lead to the Telok Ayer market and on the right to the stadium, teagardens, Chinese and Arabian sections and the wayang and theatre grouped around Mount Palmer. Here there will be numerous native sideshows, a circus and merry-go-rounds, so that part of the Exhibition will no doubt be a very lively one. The other attractions will include two cinemas, the one to be devoted to comedy productions, and the other to official pictures. Road making has been a great problem but rickshaws will be able to traverse the two miles of roads which will have been constructed. The Exhibition will be brilliantly illuminated and lit electrically from the Harbour Board's power station, and on the highest point an illuminated fountain will play every evening. There will also be firework displays every evening in the stadium. The ground is being supplied with hydrants for use in the case of fire, and there will be stationed in the Exhibition a Fire Brigade and Ambulance and Police Stations. Special arrangements are being for the sea sports to be held along the South Pier and Quay. A special pagoda or stand will be provided there for accommodation of His Royal Highness. The land sports in addition to the usual flat races will include fencing, wrestling and boxing.\\"Straits Budget, 6 January 1922 After the Exhibition one feature was retained.

The story follows Kumiko Yamaguchi, the granddaughter of a yakuza boss and teacher at an all-male private high school. In 2008, an SP manga was out, featuring some of Yankumi's (Kumiko) old students who are by now working adults. In 2002, the manga was adapted into a television drama with Yukie Nakama in the title role. A second series was produced in 2005. The third season of the (live action) series was aired as Nippon Television's 55th Anniversary Program in 2008. An animated adaptation by Madhouse covering 7 volumes of the manga ran on Nippon Television from January 6, 2004 to March 30, 2004. A movie as part of the drama series was released in Japanese theaters on July 11, 2009. Plot The plot revolves Kumiko Yamaguchi, the granddaughter of a Yakuza boss, Kuroda of the Kuroda Ikka. Her parents died when she was at the age of seven, and her grandfather had no other descendants, so Kumiko is next in line to head the family business with the title of Ojou. However, her lifelong dream has been to become a teacher. While her grandfather approves of her choice, others in the family want her to become the next boss. Kumiko becomes home teacher of class 4-2 in mathematics at an all-boys private high school where she is known as Yankumi. Her class is full of delinquents, but she tries her hardest to teach them not just academicly, but about lessons of life. Though she's forced to keep her family a secret from the public, her Yakuza upbringing gives her the strength and the experience to reach out to her students, while also providing comedic situations. Characters ; : : Kumiko is a 23-year-old university graduate and is newly hired at Shirokin Gakuen. She is very idealistic and wants to inspire her students and help them graduate high school. Since the age of 7, when her parents died, Kumiko has been living with her grandfather, who is the head of an influential Tokyo Ninkyo group. Despite this strange upbringing and the bizarre mannerisms she has picked up from it like her use of yakuza slang and a habit of running from the cops when she sees them, Kumiko is a good-hearted girl who has a strong faith in her students even when they think the world is against them. Her belief in them and her combat skills help her earn their respect. They give her the nickname \\"Yankumi,\\" something she greatly likes. It is also revealed that she is attracted to men in a fundoshi; going into a trance when she saw Shin in one. In the 2008 SP manga, Yankumi finally returned Sawada's feeling after Sawada saved her from a gang of bikers. A running gag for the drama series is that with each new series almost everyone has completely forgotten she is next in line to run the yakuza, even when asking a fellow teacher from a previous series he replied only with a puzzled look on his face. Another running gag is in the beginning of each new series, she is shown incapable of teaching unless she is teaching the delinquents of the school and, more often than not, scaring her students with her unusual behavior. Shirokin High School ; : : 18-year-old Shin is the leader of class 3-D (17-year-old leader of 2‚Äì4 in the manga). He is cool, level-headed, smart, and somewhat introverted. Everyone in the class looks up to him. When he was in middle school, he punched a teacher for refusing to apologise to an innocent student the teacher had been unfairly harassing. He knows right away that something is not normal about their new teacher and keeps an eye on her. He's the first one who found out Yankumi's true identity and later confesses to her [in the manga's last chapter] that he is in love with her. In the manga, he is given the alias of \\"Young Master Red Lion\\" from Kyou. Shin's father is a high ranking police official. At the end of the series he wanted to become a Yakuza lawyer so to be with Kumiko, and when he confessed to her, it appeared that everyone knew of his feelings for her, even the teachers, except for her. In the drama, his father is a senator. An amusing aspect of this series is that whenever he thinks he's on a mission to save Kumiko, he always gets beaten up and she continuously has to come to his rescue. He never returned in the sequels in the live-action series as he decided to go abroad as a social worker. While in the Special Manga 2008, Sawada is a top student of Toudai University and he has a stable life and job. As he's seen taking Yankumi out for a movie with his own car and constantly with her, stating why he was so cooperative with her back then was because he liked her at first sight and set up their casual meeting to turn it into a date. For the first time he is shown with emotion when one of Yankumi's new students tricks her into fighting a gang of bikers and he goes off to save her ‚Äì he managed to save her. ; : : He is one of Shin's friends. He always gets into fights, like everyone else. He had gotten into a fight with Ichiro Tsuruta, and was beaten by him. Minami is the tough guy of the group. In the anime and manga he is often seen with Noda, indicating a close friendship. In the drama he was a ladies man, but in the anime/manga he was considered the ugliest. ; : : He is the guy with a weird purple hairstyle. In the drama, he has long hair that he bleached blonde. He's also one of Shin's friends. He was lost in Okinawa when they had a trip there and he gave Kumiko and Shin a lot of problems during that time. When they finally found him, Kumiko smacked him until his face was swollen. In the drama, he is a tough guy with a soft spot for his mother. His nickname is Uchi. In the manga, he is the first of the group to get a girlfriend when he starts a relationship with a horror-obsessed girl named Shiori. She constantly terrifies him with horror stunts. After a while, he seems to embrace her love of horror, even thinking about becoming a monster movie make-up artist. ; : : Large and tough, Kumai (called \\"Kuma\\", or \\"Bear\\" by everyone) always seems to be getting into trouble. He's either getting into fights, or being accused of theft, or being attacked by a rival school. Kuma and Shin are best friends. They grew up together, and Kuma calls Shin \\"Shin-chan\\". Even Kuma's mother was friends with Kumiko before she became a teacher. He is also the only former student of Yankumi's shown in the second and third drama seasons. He eventually marries his first love and later becomes a father. Throughout the seasons he helps Yankumi when he sees her students getting into some kind of trouble and becomes a mentor to them as well. In each new series of the drama there is always a kid who greatly resembles Kuma in Yankumi's class. ; : : He is also one of Shin's friends. He was the one who thought of giving Kumiko \\"Yankumi\\" as her nickname. Takeshi Noda is a member of class 2‚Äì4. Although not typically a main cast member, in one episode (in the drama), he becomes obsessed with the teacher Shizuka Fujiyama. Hurt when she threw away a present he gave her, Noda takes a picture of her at her secret second job: hostess of a bar. He then sends the picture to the head teacher and almost gets Shizuka put on probation for a week, to be fired if class 3-D does not get at least a 30 on their English mid-finals. In the manga, he is the first of his classmates to figure out that Shin likes Yankumi and gets Shin to admit so. In the manga, he is much more involved than in the anime or drama. He is also much smarter in the manga, like one instance when Ms. Fujiyama was being stalked, Noda made many suggestions as to how the stalker could follow Ms. Fujiyama. One thing he has in common with his drama counterpart is his sense in fashion, as demonstrated in the chapter of the manga \\"Protect our F-cup\\", where he dresses Yamaguchi in his sister's clothing in which Uchiyama and the others (first in disgust) found that the outfit worked well with her. He is often seen with Minami in the anime and manga, indicating a friendship between them, possibly being best friends. In the anime and manga he is accused of being a thief (similar to Uchi's situation in the drama). ; : : Shizuka Fujiyama is another female teacher hired by Shirokin Gakuin at the same time as Yankumi. In the drama, Fujiyama teaches English. In the anime she teaches music. One of her students once attempted suicide and she learned a lesson because of that incident. She started a choir club in school. In the drama, Fujiyama wears her normal clothes all the time, but in the anime and manga she wears a tracksuit like Yankumi does. Fujiyama used to teach middle school students, and is very happy to be teaching at a high school. She jokes about which boys are cute, and whom she would sleep with. In the manga, she developed a crush on Kyo-san and tries to meet him, but she doesn't believe he's her \\"knight\\". Since she daydreamed him younger looking. ; : :The School's Vice-Principal is Yankumi's main nemesis amongst the school staff. In episode 13 he was the 3rd person to find out about Yankumi's secret only to realize that she resigned. Also he tried to use a camera when he witnessed a fight only to be caught by Kyo. He is only majorly featured in the drama and anime. In the drama, despite initially antagonistic towards Yankumi and her class, he was undeniably portrayed as more benevolent than his anime incarnation. His state of benevolence was shown to be more prominent in Gokusen 2, where among the last few episodes, he deliberately informed Yankumi that her class attempted to boycott their graduation unless she calls off her resignation. It would seem that the drama-version Sawatori has grown to respect the headstrong and dignified educator that Yankumi is, despite knowing that he also risked getting fired in the process (he was poised for promotion). He was later seen a month after graduation, apparently assigned to another school (claiming to have resigned from the last one). He has a wife in the drama who runs an arranged marriage business, though he is constantly seen enjoying himself with younger women. A running gag in the drama is that he is able to instantly retain his status as Vice-Principal with each new school, even leading Yankumi to question how he does that. ; : : The School's Principal. He does have a great knack for popping up suddenly at unusual times to point out useful information. In the manga and anime, the Koucho is this happy little bald guy who likes to wear bow ties. He knows that Yankumi is next in line to the yakuza, and discovered that was one of the main reasons he hired her, because he knew she would be able to easily handle that class. Kuroda Family/Ooedo Clan ; : 'Voiced by: Chikao Ohtsuka (Japanese), Dan Green (English) : Kumiko's grandfather. He is a kindly, wise old man who loves Kumiko very much, and is always there to support her and give advice. He took Kumiko in after her parents died. He admits that he knows Yurikio(Kumiko's mother) left because she no longer desired to live like her father and mother. Though many rookies in the crime world might believe he runs a small branch of the Yakuza due to only having a few members, it is shown he is highly respected in the yakuza, and with a single command he could call upon thousands of members, as well as the few members that are with him are very strong and skilled at what they do, being able to take on a gang that clearly outmatched them in numbers with ease. This alone will scare smaller branches from even the thought of attacking him. He and the family are very respected around town as well, willing to do what they could to keep Kudou from escaping the Ooedo Clan. He is also shown to have a childlike personality as well, becoming moody at Shin when he believed he upset Kumiko. ; : : Kyo is a tough- looking member of the Yakuza, but he is very close to Kumiko. When he was younger, and Kumiko was a little girl, her grandfather entrusted him to look after her. During that he took on the role of a parental figure; though often failed at it. Among his tasks, he taught her how to fight and defend herself when she was being bullied in school and teased because of her Yakuza connections (in the drama it was her grandfather who did this). It becomes clear, that over the years the two formed a father/daughter bond and she admits she often sees him as the closest thing to her dad. He later figures out that Shin is in love with Kumiko and wishes him the best of luck. He respects the Ooedo Clan and Kumiko very dearly, where even though he pretended to hit her to make it seem like she was in debt to the yakuza rather than a part of it to her students, he tried to kill himself (while flooding with tears) for raising his hand to her, or protecting Class 4 because they are her students. Yet this does not prevent him from wishing to kill them when he believes they upset her. ; : : The young head assistant of the Kuroda family. He's very close to the group and is often seen either by Ryuichiro and Kyo- san, showing a friendship with the men. He's the only one of the group that is married and is extremely loyal to her. His wife Yusue owns a nightclub, that everyone visits. Like Kyo, he feels a close familial tie to Kumiko. ; : : Along with Tetsu, Minoru is a member of Kumiko's Yakuza group, and is one of her loyal followers. He and Tetsu watch over Kumiko and worry about her. Minoru and Tetsu can occasionally be seen running a takoyaki stand near Kumiko's school where they can be near her if needed. Sometimes their enthusiasm in serving her almost betrays her secret, but all they want to do is help. Kumiko took him in when he was a teen, calling him a 'younger brother' since the family didn't accept underage kids, and he had nowhere else to go. In the manga, he dated Noda's older sister briefly. But she dumped him when he tried to do a legitimate job to please their father, leaving him heartbroken. ; : : Tetsu is one of Kumiko's lackeys. He is a member of the Yakuza group, and is very devoted and protective of her. He and Minoru always keep an eye on Kumiko and do their best to help her when they can. In the drama, Tetsu seems to like Kumiko, but unfortunately he doesn't seem to have very good chances of getting romantically involved with her, as she considers him to be like family. Kumiko took him in when he was a teen, calling him a 'younger brother' since the family didn't accept underage kids, and he had nowhere else to go. ; : : He is Kumiko's old dog. He narrates the preview for the next episode. He is very loyal to Kumiko. He talks most of the time in the anime even though nobody can hear him (however Shin seems to be able to know what Fuji is thinking). Anime and manga character only, though a dog fitting Fuji's image can be seen in the drama. Others ; : : In the manga and anime, Shinohara is the lawyer that works for Kumiko's Yakuza group. He's handsome and cool. Kumiko's grandfather helped Shinohara back when he was a law student, and Shinohara works for the Yakuza to repay the favor. Kumiko has had a crush on him for a long time where in the drama she gets a crush on the new guy of the series, oddly though the P.E. teacher showed genuine feelings for her but during the time she is too star-struck by her new crush to notice. In the manga it is possible he returned Kumiko's feelings, near the end he asks her to go back home with him. But after thinking it over, she declines and he understands. He's very well aware of Shin's feelings and encourages him to look after her. At the end of the series he returns to his hometown after his father was getting out of the hospital. ; : A former student at Shirokin Gakuen. He was a senior there until he was kicked out. He met Kumiko during her first week of school, when he tried to beat up Kuma. Then Kumiko, when she found Kudoh and his gang, gave them a worse beating. He joins the Nekomata Group and tries to frame the Ooedo Clan to get back at Kumiko. Back at Shirokin Gakuen he and the other seniors used to beat up the juniors whenever they could. By the end of the anime he kidnapped Kumiko in hopes of bringing down the Ooedo Clan, only to be beaten by Shin and the rest of the class from 2‚Äì4. In the manga he is later taken in by Kumiko, seeing that she needs to make him into a better man, though he fights her (unsuccessfully) at every step. ; : : Tsuruta is known to be the strongest pupil in the school. He and Kudoh were the bullies to the juniors, and Tsuruta was eventually kicked out. He returns to school in Episode 9 for the festival thanks to the Vice- principal. The seniors basically used him to start fights with the juniors, until he and Kumiko secretly had a fight. Kumiko won and in return had Tsuruta stop being a bully and start hitting the books. Tsuruta may seem tough but he's actually a kind person and a good cook. He also shows up in episode 11 of the anime, to try to help the guys get Shin out. In the manga, he becomes part of Kumiko's class because honestly, he couldn't remember what grade he was in before being kicked out. ; : : A boy who goes to Shirokin Gakuen. A good kid who keeps getting bullied by his so-called friends. Ms. Fujiyama wanted him to join the choir club because she thought he was cute and to get him away from his bad friends, and because he reminded her of a student she had in middle school who tried to commit suicide. He almost did commit suicide, if not for Kumiko and Shin who grabbed him in time before he fell off the roof. He's later shown in Ms. Fujiyama's choir club. Drama The drama aired on Nippon TV from April 1, 2002 to July 3, 2002. The series consisted of 12 episodes. Nippon TV began airing a second season on January 15, 2005, with several returning cast members (including Yukie Nakama). It lasted 10 episodes. There is also a special episode titled \\"Gokusen Special: Sayonara 3-nen D-gumi\\" (Goodbye 3rd year Class D), it's a sequel to the first season and the prequel to the second season.

He is currently music director of the Cleveland Orchestra.  Biography  Franz Leopold Maria M√∂st was born in Linz, Austria, and later studied under the composer . As a youth in Linz, he studied the violin and had developed an interest in conducting. After suffering injuries in a car crash that led to nerve damage, he stopped his violin studies and shifted full-time to conducting studies. In 1985, M√∂st assumed the stage name Welser-M√∂st on suggestion of his mentor, Baron Andreas von Bennigsen of Liechtenstein, thus paying homage to the city of Wels where he grew up. In 1986, he was adopted by Bennigsen. In 1992, Welser-M√∂st married Bennigsen's former wife, Angelika. His first major debuts were at the Salzburg Festival in 1985, followed by the London Philharmonic Orchestra in 1986 and the Orchester Musikkollegium Winterthur in 1988. Between 1986 and 1991 Welser-M√∂st served as the principal conductor of Norrk√∂ping Symphony Orchestra, Sweden, and in 1990 he became principal conductor of the London Philharmonic Orchestra (LPO). His LPO tenure was controversial, with London critics giving him the nickname \\"Frankly Worse than Most\\". He concluded his LPO tenure in 1996. From 1995 to 2000, he was music director with the Z√ºrich Opera House. He became general music director of the Z√ºrich Opera in September 2005, with an original commitment to the Opera through 2011. However, he stood down from the Z√ºrich post in July 2008, after having agreed to serve in the same capacity at the Vienna State Opera. Welser-M√∂st first conducted at the Vienna State Opera in 1987, as a substitute for Claudio Abbado in a production of Gioachino Rossini's L'italiana in Algeri. On June 6, 2007, the Austrian government announced the appointment of Welser-M√∂st as Generalmusikdirektor of the Vienna State Opera, effective September 2010, alongside Dominique Meyer as director (Staatsoperndirektor). In September 2014, he announced his resignation from the Vienna State Opera, effective immediately. Welser-M√∂st is an honorary member of the Wiener Singverein. He conducted the Vienna New Year's Concert in 2011\\"New Year's Concert 2011 with Franz Welser-M√∂st\\" , Vienna Philharmonic, retrieved 1 Jan 2011. and 2013. Welser-M√∂st made his United States conducting debut with the St. Louis Symphony in 1989. He led The Cleveland Orchestra for the first time in February 1993, serving as a guest conductor. Nearly a decade later, with the 2002‚Äì03 season, Welser-M√∂st was named the seventh music director of The Cleveland Orchestra. With his most recent contract, which extends through the 2026‚Äì27 season, Welser-M√∂st will become the longest-serving music director in Cleveland Orchestra history. During his tenure, Welser-M√∂st has overseen many of The Cleveland Orchestra‚Äôs residencies, and had been a key driver behind community engagement programs and expansion activities. He leads the Orchestra‚Äôs ongoing residency at the Musikverein in Vienna, which began with Welser-M√∂st‚Äôs first European tour in 2003. In addition, under Welser-M√∂st The Cleveland Orchestra created an annual residency at Miami‚Äôs Carnival Center for the Performing Arts ‚Äì later renamed the Adrienne Arsht Center for the Performing Arts ‚Äì in 2007. Under Welser-M√∂st, the Orchestra began presenting regularly staged operas in 2009, typically during the second half of each season, with a three-year cycle of Mozart operas that feature libretti by Lorenzo Da Ponte: Le nozze di Figaro, Don Giovanni, and Cos√¨ fan tutte. Additional staged productions included Richard Strauss‚Äôs Salome (2011‚Äì12), Jan√°ƒçek‚Äôs The Cunning Little Vixen (2013‚Äì14 and 2017‚Äì18), returns to Strauss with Daphne (2014‚Äì15) and Ariadne auf Naxos (2018‚Äì19), Bart√≥k‚Äôs The Miraculous Mandarin and Bluebeard‚Äôs Castle in the 2015‚Äì16 season (a collaboration with the Joffrey Ballet), and Debussy‚Äôs Pell√©as et M√©lisande (2016‚Äì17). The presentation of Cleveland Orchestra operas in concert was started by Music Director Laureate Christoph von Dohn√°nyi and was revived by Welser-M√∂st. A standout performance of Wagner‚Äôs Tristan und Isolde took place during the Orchestra‚Äôs centennial season. Acknowledging the opera‚Äôs psychological layers, Welser-M√∂st said, ‚ÄúThe psychology of the entire piece is in the orchestra, and so the more transparent you can get, the more layers of psycho-drama you will understand. I‚Äôve always felt that this orchestra, which has such high musical intelligence, really has to play it.‚Äù Led by Welser-M√∂st, the Orchestra continues to provide extraordinary music experiences for people of all ages. In 2009, the Orchestra marked its return to performing concerts in Cleveland- area public schools, a tradition that began during the ensemble‚Äôs early years, and in 2020, the Orchestra released a three-disc recording featuring works from the past three centuries, The Cleveland Orchestra: A New Century, which was the ensemble‚Äôs debut album on its in-house label.  Recordings  During his tenure with the LPO, Welser-M√∂st had established an exclusive recording contract with EMI. His 1996 recording of Franz Schmidt's Symphony No. 4 received the Gramophone Award for Best Orchestral Recording. The CDs of Anton Bruckner's Mass No. 3 and Te Deum and works of Erich Wolfgang Korngold both received Grammy Award nominations for \\"Best Classical Album.\\" EMI struck a similar deal with Welser-M√∂st to record performances at the Z√ºrich Opera and has released a number of DVDs of his Z√ºrich opera productions. In 2008 EMI reissued many of Welser-M√∂st's earlier recordings in an eight CD set. In October 2007, Deutsche Grammophon released the first commercial recording featuring Welser-M√∂st with The Cleveland Orchestra: Beethoven's Symphony No. 9 including German bass Ren√© Pape among the soloists. This recording was soon followed by a disc of Richard Wagner Lieder performed by the orchestra and soloist Measha Brueggergosman. Several DVDs have been issued as well, including Bruckner's 7th and 8th symphonies, at Severance Hall, and the 5th and 4th at the St. Florian Monastery near Linz where Anton Bruckner is buried.

He came to office as the leader of the Labor Party, but was expelled from the party in the split of 1916. He subsequently became the inaugural leader of the NSW branch of the Nationalist Party. Holman was born in London and arrived in Australia at the age of 17, becoming a cabinet-maker in Sydney. Before being elected to parliament, he was active in the labour movement as a journalist and union official. He was elected to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1898. He began studying law part-time, and was called to the bar in 1903. In 1910, Holman became Attorney-General of New South Wales in the state's first Labor government, under Premier James McGowen. He succeeded McGowen as premier in June 1913, and later that year led his party to victory at the 1913 state election. In 1916, Holman supported the \\"Yes\\" vote in the referendum on overseas conscription and was consequently expelled from the Labor Party. He and his supporters remained in government with the backing of the opposition Liberal Reform Party, and the two groups subsequently merged to form the Nationalist Party's NSW branch under Holman's leadership. The new party won a large majority at the 1917 election. However, it was heavily defeated at the 1920 election, in which Holman lost his own seat. After his defeat, he returned to his legal practice and was made King's Counsel. He was elected to the House of Representatives for the United Australia Party at the 1931 federal election, but was in poor health and died before completing his first term. Early life Holman was born in St Pancras, London, England in 1871, the son of William Holman, an actor. His mother was also on the stage under the name of May Burney. He was educated at an Anglican school and was apprenticed as a cabinetmaker. He attended night classes and literary societies. He attributed his success and love of learning to her teaching of Matilda Sharpe who taught Latin to classes of up to 80. There were bad times in the British theatre during the 1880s, and the Holmans were glad to obtain an engagement with Brough and Boucicault in Australia. The family migrated to Melbourne, Victoria in October 1888. The burning of the Bijou Theatre in Melbourne resulted in their move to Sydney, New South Wales. Trade union activity As a cabinet maker in Sydney he was interested in the ideas of John Stuart Mill, William Morris, Herbert Spencer and Charles Darwin, and became very active in the Australian labour movement. He joined the Single Tax League, the Australian Socialist League and the newly formed Labor Electoral League, a forerunner to the Australian Labor Party (ALP). In the Australian Socialist League he mixed with anarchists and socialists and met future Prime Minister Billy Hughes, Creo Stanley, Ernie Lane, Henry Lawson and J.D.Fitzgerald. Holman and Hughes were associated with Arthur Desmond on the scandal sheet paper, The New Order. In 1893 he became Secretary of the Railways and Tramways Employees' Union, representing the union on the Sydney Trades and Labor Council. With the support of the Labor Electoral League he unsuccessfully stood for election to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1894 and 1895. During this period he was the proprietor of the Daily Post newspaper, sympathetic to the labour movement, which wound up in liquidation, with Holman and four other directors convicted of fraud. He spent nearly two months in jail before the conviction was quashed. He went on to become a journalist for the Grenfell Vedette, and later its proprietor. From 1896 to 1898 he worked as an organiser for the Australian Workers' Union. Legal profession In 1900 Holman began to study law part-time and in 1903 he passed the University of London's intermediate examination, and was admitted to the bar as a barrister of the Supreme Court of New South Wales on 31 July 1903. In 1909 he co-authored with P.A. Jacobs Australian Mercantile Law. In the 1920s, when he resumed his legal practice, he was made a Kings Counsel. After a lectureship in Brisbane in 1928, The Australian constitution : its interpretation and amendment was published. Parliamentary career In the late 1890s Holman was on the central executive of the embryonic Labor Party, before being elected as the Member for Grenfell in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1898. When Grenfell was abolished in 1904 as part of the post-Federation downsizing of the Legislative Assembly, Holman transferred to the new seat of Cootamundra. He became deputy-leader of the Labor party in 1905. In 1910 the Labor Party first won Government in New South Wales with a slim majority of 46 seats in a parliament of 90 seats, with James McGowen as Premier, and Holman made Attorney General. Premier of New South Wales=Labor government On 30 June 1913 McGowen resigned and Holman was named leader of the New South Wales Labor Party and hence became Premier. During his government, many state-owned enterprises were established to compete with private businesses, as a compromise to the Labor policy on Nationalisation. The Labor Party had a policy commitment to abolishing the New South Wales Legislative Council, with Holman moving a motion in 1893 that the upper house be abolished. Only 47 per cent of Government bills were passed by the Upper House for the period between 1910 and 1916. But Holman contradicted his position in 1912 by making nine appointments to the Upper House, some of which were not members of the Labor Party, without consultation with the party machine or the Trades and Labor Council. Other issues placing him at odds with the labour movement include the failure to control prices and profiteering during the war, and attitudes to pay and conditions of public servants. Nationalist government In 1916 the conscription issue divided the Labor Party and wider Australian Community. While much of the Australian labour movement and general community were opposed to conscription, Australian Labor Prime Minister Billy Hughes and Premier Holman strongly supported conscription, and both were expelled from the Labor Party for this stance. On 15 November 1916, Holman and 17 other pro-conscription Labor MPs formed a coalition with the leader of the opposition Liberal Reform Party, Charles Wade, with Holman remaining as Premier. Early in 1917, Holman and his supporters merged with Liberal Reform to form the state branch of the Nationalist Party of Australia, with Holman as leader. At the general election held that March, the Nationalists won a huge victory, picking up a 13-seat swing which was magnified by the large number of Labor MPs who followed Holman out of the party. It proved to be a harbinger of the Nationalists' equally massive victory in the federal election held two months later. Holman vigorously defended the state-owned enterprises from his new conservative allies. In the 13 March 1920 state election, Holman and his Nationalists were thrown from office in a massive swing, being succeeded by a Labor Government under the short-lived John Storey. Unusually for a long-serving premier, Holman was defeated in his own seat. However, he continued outside Parliament as a senior figure in conservative politics. Federal politics and death Holman's later parliamentary career was less notable than might have been expected from his 1910‚Äì20 achievements. He was elected to the federal Parliament as the Sydney seat of Martin in December 1931 as a member of the United Australia Party, which by this time had absorbed the Nationalists. He had an undistinguished time as a backbencher in the Joseph Lyons government. His health having deteriorated over a considerable period, he died on 5 June 1934 in the Sydney suburb of Gordon, apparently from shock and loss of blood after a difficult tooth extraction on the previous day. He was cremated at Northern Suburbs crematorium on 6 June 1934. It is rather telling that Lyons did not make Holman a minister as both were Labor defectors and former state Labor leaders and premiers, even though they were on opposite sides of the World War I conscription debate; the ensuing split helped Lyons ascend to the Tasmanian Labor leadership. In fact Lyons' tenure as Tasmanian Labor leader between 1916 and 1929 briefly overlaps Holman's tenure as NSW Labor leader between 1913 and 1917. However, by this time Holman was in poor health, which probably disqualified him for ministerial preferment in any event. Legacy Holman is still a controversial figure, for the same reason as Hughes. Both men moved from the ALP to the conservative parties, and as a consequence, historians of the ALP are apt to regard them as traitors. Although Holman protected the state-owned enterprises he had helped create during his ALP days, the Australian labour movement still considers him a \\"rat.\\" Family On 22 January 1901, Holman married journalist and novelist Ada Augusta Kidgell, niece of James Kidgell, a Member of the Queensland Legislative Assembly. Their one child, Portia Holman, was born on 20 November 1903; she was to become a doctor. NotesReferences * Australian labour leader : the story of W.A.

Chief places named in connection with Islamic pottery. Medieval Islamic pottery occupied a geographical position between Chinese ceramics, then the unchallenged leaders of Eurasian production, and the pottery of the Byzantine Empire and Europe. For most of the period it can fairly be said to have been between the two in terms of aesthetic achievement and influence as well, borrowing from China and exporting to and influencing Byzantium and Europe. The use of drinking and eating vessels in gold and silver, the ideal in ancient Rome and Persia as well as medieval Christian societies, is prohibited by the Hadiths,Hadithic texts against gold and silver vessels with the result that pottery and glass were used for tableware by Muslim elites, as pottery (but less often glass) also was in China, but was much rarer in Europe and Byzantium. In the same way Islamic restrictions greatly discouraged figurative wall-painting, encouraging the architectural use of schemes of decorative and often geometrically- patterned tiles, which are the most distinctive and original speciality of Islamic ceramics. The era of Islamic pottery started around 622. From 633, Muslim armies moved rapidly towards Persia, Byzantium, Mesopotamia, Anatolia, Egypt and later Andalusia. The early history of Islamic pottery remains somewhat obscure and speculative as little evidence has survived. Apart from tiles which escaped destruction due to their use in architectural decoration of buildings and mosques, much early medieval pottery vanished. The Muslim world inherited significant pottery industries in Mesopotamia, Persia, Egypt, North Africa (African Red Slip) and later other regions. Indeed, the origin of glazed pottery has been traced to Egypt where it was first introduced during the fourth millennium BCE. However most of these traditions made heavy use of figurative decoration, which was greatly reduced, though not entirely removed, under Islam. Instead Islamic pottery developed geometric and plant-based decoration to a very high level, and made more use of decorative schemes made up of many tiles than any previous culture.

Ceramic bowl decorated with slip beneath a transparent glaze, Gorgan, 9th century CE, Early Islamic period, National Museum of Iran A distinct Muslim style in pottery was not firmly established until the 9th century in Iraq (formerly Mesopotamia), Syria and Persia. During this period pieces mainly used white tin-glaze. Information on earlier periods is very limited. This is largely due to the lack of surviving specimens in good condition which also limits the interest in the study of ceramics of these periods. Archaeological excavations carried out in Jordan uncovered only a few examples from the Umayyad period, mostly unglazed vessels from Khirbat Al-Mafjar.Baramki, D.C., \\"The pottery from Khirbet El-Mefjer\\", The Quarterly of the Department of Antiquities in Palestine (QDAP 1942), vol. 10, pp.65-103Sauer, J.A., \\"Umayyad pottery from sites in East Jordan2, Jordan, Vol.4, 1975, pp.25-32. In the East, evidence shows that a production centre was set up in Samarkand under the Samanid dynasty who ruled this region and parts of Persia between 874 and 999 A.D. The most highly regarded technique of this centre is the use of calligraphy in the decoration of vessels. East Persian pottery from the 9th to 11th centuries decorated only with highly stylised inscriptions, called \\"epigraphic ware\\", has been described as \\"probably the most refined and sensitive of all Persian pottery\\".Arts, p. 223. see nos. 278-290 Chinese influence During the Abbasid dynasty pottery production gained momentum, largely using tin glazes mostly in the form of opaque white glaze. Some historians, such as Arthur Lane, attribute the rise of such industry to Chinese influence. Evidence from Muslim manuscripts, such as Akhbar al-Sin wa al-Hind (circa 851) and Ibn Kurdadhbih's Book of Roads and Provinces (846-885), suggest that trade with China was firmly established. Lane also referred to the passage in a work written by Muhammad ibn al-Husayn al-Baihaki, (circa 1059) where he stated that the governor of Khurasan, ‚ÄòAli ibn ‚ÄòIsa, sent as a present to the Caliph Harun al-Rashid (786-809), ‚Äútwenty pieces of Chinese Imperial porcelain (Chini faghfuri), the like of which had never been seen at a Caliph‚Äôs court before, in addition to 2,000 other pieces of porcelain‚Äù. Plate with dragon. Persia, 17th century, inspired by 15th- century Chinese blue and white porcelain According to Lane, the influence of Chinese pottery progressed in three main phases. The first contact with China took place in 751 when the Arabs defeated the Chinese at the Battle of Talas. It has been argued that imprisoned Chinese potters and paper makers could have taught the Muslims the art of pottery and paper-making. In 800's Chinese stoneware and porcelain reached the Abbasids. The second phase took place in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, a period noted for the decline of pottery industry following the fall of the Seljuk dynasty. This period also saw the invasion of the Mongols who brought Chinese pottery traditions. The influence of ceramics from the Tang Dynasty can be seen on lustrewares, produced by Mesopotamian potters, and on some early white wares excavated at Samarra (in modern-day Iraq). Ceramics from this period were excavated at Nishapur (in modern-day Iran) and Samarkand (in modern-day Uzbekistan). Early Chinese blue and white porcelain, c 1335, early Yuan dynasty, Jingdezhen, using a Middle-eastern shape By the time of the Mongol invasion of China a considerable export trade westwards to the Islamic world was established, and Islamic attempts to imitate Chinese porcelain in their own fritware bodies had begun in the 12th century. These were less successful than those of Korean pottery, but eventually were able to provide attractive local competition to Chinese imports.Vainker, Ch. 5, pp. 134, 140-141 especially Chinese production could adapt to the preferences of foreign markets; larger celadon dishes than the Chinese market wanted were favoured for serving princely banquets in the Middle East. Celadon wares were believed there to have the ability to detect poison, by sweating or breaking.Vainker, 136-137 The Islamic market was apparently especially important in the early years of Chinese blue and white porcelain, which appears to have been mainly exported until the Ming. Again, large dishes were an export style, and the densely painted decoration of Yuan blue and white borrowed heavily from the arabesques and plant scrolls of Islamic decoration, probably mostly taking the style from metalwork examples, which also provided shapes for some vessels. This style of ornament was then confined to blue and white, and is not found in the red and white painted wares then preferred by the Chinese themselves. The cobalt blue that was used was itself imported from Persia, and the export trade in porcelain was handled by colonies of Muslim merchants in Quanzhou, convenient for the huge Jingdezhen potteries, and other ports to the south.Vainker, 137-140 The start of the Ming dynasty was quickly followed by a decree of 1368, forbidding trade with foreign countries. This was not entirely successful, and had to be repeated several times, and the giving of lavish imperial diplomatic gifts continued, concentrating on silk and porcelain (19,000 pieces of porcelain in 1383), but it severely set back the export trade. The policy was relaxed under the next emperor after 1403, but had by then greatly stimulated the production of pottery emulating Chinese styles in the Islamic world itself, which was by now reaching a high level of quality in several countries (high enough to fool contemporary Europeans in many cases).Vainker, 140-142 Often Islamic production imitated not the latest Chinese styles, but those of the late Yuan and early Ming.Vainker, 140-141 In turn, Chinese potters began in the early 16th century to produce some items in overtly Islamic styles, including jumbled inscriptions in Arabic. These appear to have been made for the growing Chinese Muslim market, and probably those at court wishing to keep up with the Zhengde Emperor's (r. 1505-1521) flirtation with Islam.Vainker, 142-143 Islamic innovations From between the eighth and eighteenth centuries, the use of glazed ceramics was prevalent in Islamic art, usually assuming the form of elaborate pottery.Mason (1995) p.1 Tin-opacified glazing, for the production of tin-glazed pottery, was one of the earliest new technologies developed by the Islamic potters. The first Islamic opaque glazes can be found as blue-painted ware in Basra, dating to around the 8th century. Another significant contribution was the development of stoneware originating in 9th- century Iraq.Mason (1995) p.5 It was a vitreous or semivitreous ceramic ware of fine texture, made primarily from non-refactory fire clay.Standard Terminology Of Ceramic Whiteware and Related Products. ASTM Standard C242. Other centres for innovative pottery in the Islamic world included Fustat (from 975 to 1075), Damascus (from 1100 to around 1600) and Tabriz (from 1470 to 1550).Mason (1995) p.7 9th-century lustreware bowl from Iraq Lusterware was produced in Mesopotamia in the 9th century; the technique soon became popular in Persia and Syria.Ten thousand years of pottery, Emmanuel Cooper, University of Pennsylvania Press, 4th ed., 2000, , pp. 86‚Äì88. Lusterware was later produced in Egypt during the Fatimid caliphate in the 10th-12th centuries. While some production of lustreware continued in the Middle East, it spread to Europe--first in the Hispano-Moresque ware of Al-Andalus, notably at M√°laga, and then Valencia, then later to Italy, where it was used to enhance maiolica. Another innovation was the albarello, a type of maiolica earthenware jar originally designed to hold apothecaries' ointments and dry drugs. The development of this type of pharmacy jar had its roots in the Islamic Middle East. Brought to Italy from Spain, the earliest Italian examples were produced in Florence in the 15th century. Fritware refers to a type of pottery which was first developed in the Near East, where production is dated to the late first millennium AD through the second millennium AD. Frit was a significant ingredient. A recipe for ‚Äúfritware‚Äù dating to c. 1300 AD written by Abu‚Äôl Qasim reports that the ratio of quartz to ‚Äúfrit-glass‚Äù to white clay is 10:1:1.A.K. Bernsted 2003, Early Islamic Pottery: Materials and Techniques, London: Archetype Publications Ltd., 25; R.B. Mason and M.S. Tite 1994, The Beginnings of Islamic Stonepaste Technology, Archaeometry 36.1: 77 This type of pottery has also been referred to as ‚Äústoneware\\" and ‚Äúfaience‚Äù among other names.Mason and Tite 1994, 77. A ninth-century corpus of ‚Äúproto-stoneware‚Äù from Baghdad has ‚Äúrelict glass fragments‚Äù in its fabric.Mason and Tite 1994, 79-80. The glass is alkali-lime-lead-silica and, when the paste was fired or cooled, wollastonite and diopside crystals formed within the glass fragments.Mason and Tite 1994, 80. The lack of ‚Äúinclusions of crushed pottery‚Äù suggests these fragments did not come from a glaze.Mason and Tite 1994, 87. The reason for their addition would be to act as a flux, and so ‚Äúaccelerate vitrification at a relatively low firing temperature, and thus increase the hardness and density of the [ceramic] body.‚Äù Middle (1200‚Äì1400) Albarello with fleur-de-lys decoration, early 14th century, Syria, mus√©e du Louvre By this period the distinctive Islamic tradition of decorated wall tiles had emerged, and continued to develop together with vessel pottery in a way unique to Islamic art. In the account of Ibn Naji (circa 1016) the Caliph sent, in addition to tiles, ‚Äúa man from Baghdad‚Äù to Qairawan to produce lustre tiles for the mihrab of the Great Mosque (still well preserved). Georges Marcais suggested that Iraqi potters indeed came to Quairawan. The arrival of this Baghdadi potter must have led to the establishment of a satellite centre for the production of ceramics in Quairawan, but no information has yet been developed to confirm or deny this suggestion.Marcais G., Les faiences a reflets metalliques de la grande Mosquee de Kairouan, Paris, 1928, pp.10-11 The events leading to the collapse of the Fatimid reign in 1171 caused ceramic production to move out to new centres, via processes similar to those described above with respect to Iraq. As a result, Persia became a centre of revival under the Seljuk rule (1038‚Äì1327). This is not coincidental as the Seljuks expanded their rule over Persia, Iraq, Syria, and Palestine, as well as Anatolia and Muslim Asia Minor. All of these had been, for some considerable time, centres of old pottery. Bowl with hunters, Persian pottery from 12th‚Äì13th century. The Seljuks brought new and fresh inspiration to the Muslim world, attracting artists, craftsmen and potters from all regions including Egypt. In addition to continuing the production of similar (although more refined) tin and lustre glaze ceramics, the Seljuks (in Persia) were credited for the introduction of a new type sometimes known as \\"Faience\\". This is made from a hard white frit paste coated with transparent alkaline glaze. Hispano-Moresque ware emerged in Al-Andaluz in the 13th century, probably after potters escaped the instability after the fall of the Fatimids. It introduced lustreware manufacture to Europe and from the start was widely exported to the elites of Christian kingdoms. The first centre was M√°laga, producing wares in traditional Islamic styles, but from the 13th century Muslim potters migrated to the reconquered Christian city of Valencia, outlying suburbs of which such as Manises and Paterna became the most important centres, manufacturing mainly for Christian markets in styles increasingly influenced by European decoration, though retaining a distinct character. The potters were mostly still Muslim or Morisco.Caiger-Smith, Alan, Lustre Pottery: Technique, Tradition and Innovation in Islam and the Western World, Chapters 6 & 7, (Faber and Faber, 1985) In a rare manuscript from Kashan compiled by Abulqassim in 1301, there is a complete description of how faience production was carried out. Frit was made of ten parts of powdered quartz, one part of clay and one part of glaze mixture. The addition of greater amounts of clay made wheel throwing of the faience easier, and allowed a better quality of work, because otherwise the material had little plasticity.W. J. Allan,The History of So-Called Egyptian Faience in Islamic Persia The glaze itself is ‚Äúformed of a roughly equal mixture of ground quartz and the ashes of desert plants which contain a very high proportion of alkaline salts. These act as a flux and cause the quartz to vitrify at a manageable temperature. The two alone will produce a transparent glaze‚Äù.Watson, O., Persian Lustre Ware, London 1985, .p.32. Cited in Febervari Gesa (2000), op., cit, .p.96 Lane compared this material with the French p√¢te tender, which was used by potters as recently as the eighteenth century. This body material and the new glaze offered the potter a greater handling and manipulation ability. This allows the potter to improve the quality and appearance of the vessel, including more refined decorative designs and patterns. The result was a substantial variety of products such as bowls of different size and shapes, jugs, incense burners, lamps, candlesticks, trays, tiles and so on. These advantages also allowed greater control of carved decoration, the use of which the Seljuks refined and extended during the twelfth century.Lane, A. (1947) Early Islamic Pottery, Faber and Faber, London Carved decoration in ceramics, sgraffito, is an old tradition used in ninth- century Islamic pottery; it is an engraving technique based on incising the design with a sharp tool through a white slip to reveal the red earthenware body. The vessel is then coated with glaze. The Seljuks also developed the so- called silhouette wares which are distinguished by their black background. These are produced by a technique which consists of coating the white fritware body with a thick black slip, out of which the decoration is then carved. Later, a coat of colourless or coloured, usually blue or green, transparent glaze is applied. According to Lane, this technique was used, in a simpler form, in Samarkand between the ninth and tenth centuries. The method then consisted of mixing the colours with a thick opaque clay slip instead. Late/post-medieval (1400‚Äìonward) ƒ∞znik Pottery Candlesticks,Ottoman Turkey The influence of Blue and white porcelain of the Yuan and Ming dynasties is evident in many ceramics made by Muslim potters. ƒ∞znik pottery from around ƒ∞znik in Anatolia was supported by the Ottoman court and produced the finest Ottoman work in pottery and panels of tiles, using the same vocabulary of bold and elegant floral designs derived from Chinese decoration. A characteristic bold red was developed. ƒ∞znik ware had a major influence on European decorative arts: for example, on Italian Maiolica. The pottery was produced in as early as the 15th century AD, and was preceded by Miletus ware from the same region.M.S. Tite 1989, ƒ∞znik Pottery: An Investigation of the Methods of Production, Archaeometry 31.2: 115. Its best period lasted until the late 16th century.

Persian pottery under the Safavid dynasty (from 1502) was also heavily influenced by Chinese blue and white porcelain, which to a large extent replaced it in court circles; fine 16th-century Persian pieces are very rare.Jones and Mitchell, p. 262, no. 395 The Islamic parts of Southeast Asia, modern Indonesia and Malaysia, were export markets that were close at hand for the Chinese and later the Japanese, helped by the European trading companies, especially the Dutch East India Company. The Buddhist countries of the region also exported. Special types of wares were developed for them, such as the Chinese Kraak ware and Swatow ware, mostly producing large dishes for serving communally to a table. In the face of such competition, local wares were few and simple. The Islamic world as a whole never managed to develop porcelain, but had an avid appetite for imports of it. East Asian porcelain, first Chinese then Japanese export porcelain in the 17th century, was joined in the 18th century by the wares from Europe, in particular Vienna porcelain, which specialized in the Eastern market, and by the latter part of the century was sending as many as 120,000 pieces per year to the Ottoman Empire, many small cups and saucers for Turkish coffee.Battie, David, ed., Sotheby's Concise Encyclopedia of Porcelain, p. 96, 1990, Conran Octopus. The smaller scale factories of the Islamic world could not compete with the sophisticated imports arriving from both east and west, and local production became a craft affair, repeating now-traditional patterns. Study of Islamic pottery Arthur Lane produced two books which made substantial contribution to understanding the history and merit of Muslim ceramics. The first book was dedicated to the study of early ceramics from the Abbasid period till the Seljuk times, sketching the various events which played a significant role in the rise and fall of particular styles. In his second work, Lane used the same rhetorical style adopted in the first book, this time devoting his attention to later periods from the Mongols to nineteenth-century ƒ∞znik and Persian pottery. Following Lane's works, numerous studies appeared. The most comprehensive works adopting a general view are those by R.L. Hobson, Ernst J. Grube, Richard Ettinghausen, and more recently Alan Caiger-Smith and Gesa Febervari. Additional contributions were made by those specializing in particular temporal or regional history of Muslim pottery such as Georges Marcais in his work on North Africa, Oliver Watson on Persia and J.R. Hallett on Abbasid Pottery.

The device is a required part of resuscitation kits for trained professionals in out-of-hospital settings (such as ambulance crews) and is also frequently used in hospitals as part of standard equipment found on a crash cart, in emergency rooms or other critical care settings. Underscoring the frequency and prominence of BVM use in the United States, the American Heart Association (AHA) Guidelines for Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Emergency Cardiac Care recommend that \\"all healthcare providers should be familiar with the use of the bag-mask device.\\" Manual resuscitators are also used within the hospital for temporary ventilation of patients dependent on mechanical ventilators when the mechanical ventilator needs to be examined for possible malfunction or when ventilator-dependent patients are transported within the hospital. Two principal types of manual resuscitators exist; one version is self-filling with air, although additional oxygen (O2) can be added but is not necessary for the device to function. The other principal type of manual resuscitator (flow-inflation) is heavily used in non-emergency applications in the operating room to ventilate patients during anesthesia induction and recovery. Use of manual resuscitators to ventilate a patient is frequently called \\"bagging\\" the patientDaniel Limmer and Michael F. O'Keefe. 2005. Emergency Care 10th ed. Edward T. Dickinson, Ed. Pearson, Prentice Hall. Upper Saddle River, New Jersey. Page 140. and is regularly necessary in medical emergencies when the patient's breathing is insufficient (respiratory failure) or has ceased completely (respiratory arrest). Use of the manual resuscitator force- feeds air or oxygen into the lungs in order to inflate them under pressure, thus constituting a means to manually provide positive-pressure ventilation. It is used by professional rescuers in preference to mouth-to-mouth ventilation, either directly or through an adjunct such as a pocket mask.  History  The bag-valve mask concept was developed in 1953 by the German engineer Holger Hesse and his partner, Danish anaesthetist Henning Ruben, following their initial work on a suction pump. Hesse's company was later renamed Ambu A/S, which has manufactured and marketed the device since the late 1950s. The full-form of AMBU is Artificial Manual Breathing Unit. An Ambu bag is a self-inflating bag resuscitator from Ambu A/S, which still manufactures and markets self-inflating bag resuscitators. Today there are several manufacturers of self-inflating bag resuscitators. Some, like the original Ambu bag, are durable and intended for reuse after thorough cleaning. Others are inexpensive and intended for a single use. Initially produced in one size, BVMs are now available in sizes for use with infants, children or adults.  Standard components = Mask  Bag valve mask. Part 1 is the flexible mask to seal over the patients face, part 2 has a filter and valve to prevent backflow into the bag (prevents patient deprivation and bag contamination) and part 3 is the soft bag element which is squeezed to expel air to the patient The BVM consists of a flexible air chamber (the \\"bag\\", roughly a foot in length), attached to a face mask via a shutter valve. When the face mask is properly applied and the \\"bag\\" is squeezed, the device forces air through into the patient's lungs; when the bag is released, it self- inflates from its other end, drawing in either ambient air or a low pressure oxygen flow supplied by a regulated cylinder, while also allowing the patient's lungs to deflate to the ambient environment (not the bag) past the one way valve.  Bag and valve  Bag and valve combinations can also be attached to an alternative airway adjunct, instead of to the mask. For example, it can be attached to an endotracheal tube or laryngeal mask airway. Small heat and moisture exchangers, or humidifying/bacterial filters, can be used. A bag-valve mask can be used without being attached to an oxygen tank to provide \\"room air\\" (21% oxygen) to the patient. However, manual resuscitator devices also can be connected to a separate bag reservoir, which can be filled with pure oxygen from a compressed oxygen source, thus increasing the amount of oxygen delivered to the patient to nearly 100%. Bag-valve masks come in different sizes to fit infants, children, and adults. The face mask size may be independent of the bag size; for example, a single pediatric-sized bag might be used with different masks for multiple face sizes, or a pediatric mask might be used with an adult bag for patients with small faces. Most types of the device are disposable and therefore single use, while others are designed to be cleaned and reused.  Method of operation  Operation of bag valve mask Manual resuscitator cause the gas inside the inflatable bag portion to be force-fed to the patient via a one-way valve when compressed by the rescuer; the gas is then ideally delivered through a mask and into the patient's trachea, bronchus and into the lungs. In order to be effective, a bag valve mask must deliver between 500 and 800 milliliters of air to a normal male adult patient's lungs, but if supplemental oxygen is provided 400 ml may still be adequate. Squeezing the bag once every 5 to 6 seconds for an adult or once every 3 seconds for an infant or child provides an adequate respiratory rate (10‚Äì12 respirations per minute in an adult and 20 per minute in a child or infant).Emergency Care, Pages 142‚Äì3 Professional rescuers are taught to ensure that the mask portion of the BVM is properly sealed around the patient's face (that is, to ensure proper \\"mask seal\\"); otherwise, pressure needed to force-inflate the lungs is released to the environment. This is difficult when a single rescuer attempts to maintain a face mask seal with one hand while squeezing the bag with other. Therefore, common protocol uses two rescuers: one rescuer to hold the mask to the patient's face with both hands and focus entirely on maintaining a leak-proof mask seal, while the other rescuer squeezes the bag and focuses on breath (or tidal volume) and timing.Emergency Care, Page 141. An endotracheal tube (ET) can be inserted by an advanced practitioner and can substitute for the mask portion of the manual resuscitator. This provides more secure air passage between the resuscitator and the patient, since the ET tube is sealed with an inflatable cuff within the trachea (or windpipe), so any regurgitation is less likely to enter the lungs, and so that forced inflation pressure can only go into the lungs and not inadvertently go to the stomach (see \\"complications\\", below). The ET tube also maintains an open and secure airway at all times, even during CPR compressions; as opposed to when a manual resuscitator is used with a mask when a face mask seal can be difficult to maintain during compressions.  Bag valve masks used in combat  Airway obstruction is a leading cause of death in battlefield trauma. Airway management in combat is very different from its civilian equivalent. In combat, maxillofacial trauma is the primary cause of airway obstruction. The injury is frequently complicated by a struggling patient, distorted anatomy and blood, and these injuries often have significant associated hemorrhage from accompanying vascular injuries. Military paramedics face extreme challenges, including \\"darkness, hostile fire, resource limitations, prolonged evacuation times, unique casualty transportation issues, command and tactical decisions affecting health care, hostile environments and provider experience levels\\". They often have to treat multiple casualties using only the equipment they are carrying on their backs. Therefore, space is of primary importance and compact bag valve masks, such as a Pocket BVM, have been created to save valuable space in the emergency kit.  Complications  Under normal breathing, the lungs inflate under a slight vacuum when the chest wall muscles and diaphragm expand; this \\"pulls\\" the lungs open, causing air to enter the lungs to inflate under a gentle vacuum. However, when using a manual resuscitator, as with other methods of positive- pressure ventilation, the lungs are force-inflated with pressurized air or oxygen. This inherently leads to risk of various complications, many of which depend on whether the manual resuscitator is being used with a face mask or ET tube. Complications are related to over-inflating or over-pressurizing the patient, which can cause: (1) air to inflate the stomach (called gastric insufflation); (2) lung injury from over-stretching (called volutrauma); or (3) lung injury from over-pressurization (called barotrauma).  Stomach inflation / lung aspiration  When a face mask is used in conjunction with a manual resuscitator, the intent is for the force-delivered air or oxygen to inflate the lungs. However air entering the patient also has access to the stomach via the esophagus, which can inflate if the resuscitator is squeezed too hard (causing air flow that is too rapid for the lungs to absorb alone) or too much (causing excess air to divert to the stomach).\\"Wenzel V, Keller C, Idris AH, D√∂rges V, Lindner KH, Brimbacombe JR. Effects of smaller tidal volumes during basic life support: good ventilation, less risk? Resuscitation 1999: 43:25‚Äì29. Gastric inflation can lead to vomiting and subsequent aspiration of stomach contents into the lungs, which has been cited as a major hazard of bag-valve-mask ventilation,D√∂rges V, Sauer C, Ocker H, Wenzel V, Schmucker P. Smaller tidal volumes during cardiopulmonary resuscitation: comparison of adult and paediatric self-inflatable bags with three different ventilator devices. Resuscitation 1999: 43:31‚Äì37. with one study suggesting this effect is difficult to avoid even for the most skilled and experienced users, stating \\"When using a self-inflatable bag, even experienced anesthesiologists in our study may have performed ventilation with too short inspiratory times or too large tidal volumes, which resulted in stomach inflation in some cases.\\" The study goes on to state that \\"Stomach inflation is a complex problem that may cause regurgitation, [gastric acid] aspiration, and, possibly, death.\\" When stomach inflation leads to vomiting of highly acidic stomach acids, delivery of subsequent breaths can force these caustic acids down into the lungs where they cause life-threatening or fatal lung injuries including Mendelson's syndrome, aspiration pneumonia, acute respiratory distress syndrome and \\"pulmonary injuries similar to that seen in victims of chlorine gas exposure\\". Apart from the risks of gastric inflation causing vomiting and regurgitation, at least two reports have been found indicating that gastric insufflation remains clinically problematic even when vomiting does not occur. In one case of failed resuscitation (leading to death), gastric insufflation in a 3-month-old boy put sufficient pressure against the lungs that \\"precluded effective ventilation\\".Berg MD, Idris AH, Berg RA. Severe ventilatory compromise due to gastric insufflation during pediatric cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Resuscitation 1998: 36:71‚Äì73. Another reported complication was a case of stomach rupture caused by stomach over- inflation from a manual resuscitator.Smally AJ, Ross MJ, Huot CP. Gastric rupture following bag-valve mask ventilation. J Amer Med 2002: 22:27‚Äì29. The causative factors and degree of risk of inadvertent stomach inflation have been examined,Wenzel V, Idris AH, Banner MJ, Kubilis PS, Williams JL Jr. Influence of tidal volume on the distribution of gas between the lungs and the stomach in the nonintubated patient receiving positive-pressure ventilation. Critical Care Medicine 1998: 26:364‚Äì368. with one published study revealing that during prolonged resuscitation up to 75% of air delivered to the patient may inadvertently be delivered to the stomach instead of the lungs.  Lung injury and air embolism  When an endotracheal tube (ET) is placed, one of the key advantages is that a direct air-tight passageway is provided from the output of the manual resuscitator to the lungs, thus eliminating the possibilities of inadvertent stomach inflation or lung injuries from gastric acid aspiration. However this places the lungs at increased risk from separate lung injury patterns caused by accidental forced over-inflation (called volutrauma or barotrauma). Sponge-like lung tissue is delicate, and over- stretching can lead to adult respiratory distress syndrome ‚Äì a condition that requires prolonged mechanical ventilator support in the ICU and is associated with poor survival (e.g., 50%), and significantly increased care costs of up to $30,000 per day.Dasta JF, McLaughlin TP, Mody SH, Tak Piech C. Daily cost of an intensive care unit stay: The contribution of mechanical ventilation. Critical Care Medicine 2005: 33:1266‚Äì1271. Lung volutrauma, which can be caused by \\"careful\\" delivery of large, slow breaths, can also lead to a \\"popped\\" or collapsed lung (called a pneumothorax), with at least one published report describing \\"a patient in whom a sudden tension pneumothorax developed during ventilation with a bag-valve device.\\"Silbergleit R, Lee DC, Blank-Ried C, McNamara RM. Sudden severe barotrauma from self-inflating bag devices. Journal of Trauma 1996: 40:320‚Äì322. Additionally, there is at least one report of manual resuscitator use where the lungs were accidentally over- inflated to the point where \\"the heart contained a large volume of air,\\" and the \\"aorta and pulmonary arteries were filled with air\\" ‚Äì a condition called an air embolism which \\"is almost uniformly fatal\\". However, the case was of a 95-year-old woman, as the authors point out that this type of complication has previously only been reported in premature infants.Kane G, Hewines B, Grannis FW Jr. Massive air embolism in an adult following positive pressure ventilation. Chest 1988: 93:874‚Äì876.  Public health risk from manual resuscitator complications  Two factors appear to make the public particularly at risk from complications from manual resuscitators: (1) their prevalence of use (leading to high probability of exposure), and (2) apparent inability for providers to protect patients from uncontrolled, inadvertent, forced over-inflation.  Prevalence of manual resuscitator use  Manual resuscitators are commonly used for temporary ventilation support, especially flow-inflation versions that are used during anesthesia induction/recovery during routine surgery. Accordingly, most citizens are likely to be \\"bagged\\" at least once during their lifetime as they undergo procedures involving general anesthesia. Additionally, a significant number of newborns are ventilated with infant-sized manual resuscitators to help stimulate normal breathing, making manual resuscitators among the very first therapeutic medical devices encountered upon birth. As previously stated, manual resuscitators are the first-line device recommended for emergency artificial ventilation of critical care patients, and are thus used not only throughout hospitals but also in out-of-hospital care venues by firefighters, paramedics and outpatient clinic personnel.  Inability of professional providers to use manual resuscitators within established safety guidelines  Manual resuscitators have no built-in tidal volume control ‚Äî the amount of air used to force-inflate the lungs during each breath depends entirely on how much the operator squeezes the bag. In response to the dangers associated with use of manual resuscitators, specific guidelines from the American Heart AssociationNeumar RW, Otto CW, Link MS, Kronick SL, Shuster M, Callaway CW, Kudenchuk PJ, Ornato JP, McNally B, Silvers SM, Passman RS, White RD, Hess EP, Tang W, Davis D, Sinz E, Morrison LJ.

While no studies are known that have assessed the frequency of complications or deaths due to uncontrolled manual resuscitator use, numerous peer-reviewed studies have found that, despite established safety guidelines, the incidence of provider over-inflation with manual resuscitators continues to be \\"endemic\\"Aufderheide TP, Sigurdsson G, Pirrallo RG, Yannopoulos D, McKnite S, von Briesen C, Sparks CW, Conrad CJ, Provo TA, Lurie KG.

Another clinical study found \\"the tidal volume delivered by a manual resuscitator shows large variations\\", concluding that \\"the manual resuscitator is not a suitable device for accurate ventilation.\\"Lee HM, Cho KH, Choi YH, Yoon SY, Choi YH. Can you deliver accurate tidal volume by manual resuscitator. Emergency Medicine Journal 2008: 10:632‚Äì634. A separate assessment of another high-skilled group with frequent emergency use of manual resuscitators (ambulance paramedics) found that \\"Despite seemingly adequate training, EMS personnel consistently hyperventilated patients during out-of-hospital CPR\\", with the same research group concluding that \\"Unrecognized and inadvertent hyperventilation may be contributing to the currently dismal survival rates from cardiac arrest.\\" A peer-reviewed study published in 2012 assessed the possible incidence of uncontrolled over-inflation in newborn neonates, finding that \\"a large discrepancy between the delivered and the current guideline values was observed for all parameters,\\" and that \\"regardless of profession or handling technique ... 88.4% delivered excessive pressures, whereas ... 73.8% exceeded the recommended range of volume\\", concluding that \\"the great majority of participants from all professional groups delivered excessive pressures and volumes.\\"Bassani MA, Filho FM, de Carvalho Coppo MR, Marba STM. An evaluation of peak inspiratory pressure, tidal volume, and ventilatory frequency during ventilation with a neonatal self-inflating bag resuscitator. Respiratory Care 2012: 57:525‚Äì530. A further examination has recently been made to assess whether a solution to the over-ventilation problem may lie with use of pediatric-sized manual resuscitators in adults or use of more advanced flow- inflation (or \\"Mapleson C\\") versions of manual resuscitators: while \\"the paediatric self-inflating bag delivered the most guideline-consistent ventilation\\", it did not lead to full guideline compliance as \\"participants hyperventilated patients' lungs in simulated cardiac arrest with all three devices.\\"Sherren PB, Lewinsohn A, Jovaisa T, Wijayatilake DS. Comparison of the Mapleson C system and adult and paediatric self-inflating bags for delivering guideline-consistent ventilation during simulated adult cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Anaesthesia 2011 :66(7):563‚Äì567.  Guideline non-compliance due to excessive rate versus excessive lung inflation  \\"Hyperventilation\\" can be achieved through delivery of (1) too many breaths per minute; (2) breaths that are too large and exceed the patient's natural lung capacity; or (3) a combination of both. With use of manual resuscitators, neither rate nor inflating volumes can be physically controlled through built- in safety adjustments within the device, and as highlighted above, studies show providers frequently exceed designated safety guidelines for both ventilation rate (10 breaths per minute) and volume (5‚Äì7 mL/kg body weight) as outlined by the American Heart Association and European Resuscitation Council. Numerous studies have concluded that ventilation at rates in excess of current guidelines are capable of interfering with blood flow during cardiopulmonary resuscitation, however the pre-clinical experiments associated with these findings involved delivery of inspiratory volumes in excess of current guidelines, e.g., they assessed the effects of hyperventilation via both excessive rate and excessive volumes simultaneously.Aufderheide TP, Lurie KG. Death by hyperventilation: a common and life-threatening problem during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Critical Care Medicine 2004; 32(9 Suppl):S345‚ÄìS351. A more recent study published in 2012 expanded knowledge on this topic by evaluating the separate effects of (1) isolated excessive rate with guideline-compliant inspiratory volumes; (2) guideline-compliant rate with excessive inspiratory volumes; and (3) combined guideline non-compliance with both excessive rate and volume.Gazmuri RJ, Ayoub IM, Radhakrishnan J, Motl J, Upadhyaya MP. Clinically plausible hyperventilation does not exert adverse hemodynamic effects during CPR but markedly reduces end-tidal PCO2. Resuscitation 2012; 83(2):259‚Äì264. This study found that excessive rate more than triple the current guideline (e.g., 33 breaths per minute) may not interfere with CPR when inspiratory volumes are delivered within guideline- compliant levels, suggesting that ability to keep breath sizes within guideline limits may individually mitigate clinical dangers of excessive rate. It was also found that when guideline-excessive tidal volumes were delivered, changes in blood flow were observed that were transient at low ventilation rates but sustained when both tidal volumes and rates were simultaneously excessive, suggesting that guideline-excessive tidal volume is the principal mechanism of side effects, with ventilation rate acting as a multiplier of these effects. Consistent with previous studies where both excessive rate and volumes were found to produce side effects of blood flow interference during CPR, a complicating factor may be inadequate time to permit full expiration of oversized breaths in between closely spaced high-rate breaths, leading to the lungs never being permitted to fully exhale between ventilations (also called \\"stacking\\" of breaths). A recent advancement in the safety of manual ventilation may be the growing use of time-assist devices that emit an audible or visual metronome tone or flashing light at the proper guideline-designated rate interval for breath frequency; one study found these devices may lead to near 100% guideline compliance for ventilation rate.Kern KB, Stickney RE, Gallison L, Smith RE. Metronome improves compression and ventilation rates during CPR on a manikin in a randomized trial. Resuscitation 2010:81(2):206-210. While this advancement appears to provide a solution to the \\"rate problem\\" associated with guideline-excessive manual resuscitator use, it may not address the \\"volume problem\\", which may continue to make manual resuscitators a patient hazard, as complications can still occur from over-inflation even when rate is delivered within guidelines. Currently, the only devices that can deliver pre-set, physician-prescribed inflation volumes reliably within safety guidelines are mechanical ventilators that require an electrical power source or a source of compressed oxygen, a higher level of training to operate, and typically cost hundreds to thousands of dollars more than a disposable manual resuscitator.  Additional components and features = Filters  A filter is sometimes placed between the mask and the bag (before or after the valve) to prevent contamination of the bag.  Positive end-expiratory pressure  Some devices have PEEP valve connectors, for better positive airway pressure maintenance.  Medication delivery  A covered port may be incorporated into the valve assembly to allow inhalatory medicines to be injected into the airflow, which may be particularly effective in treating patients in respiratory arrest from severe asthma.  Airway pressure port  A separate covered port may be included into the valve assembly to enable a pressure-monitoring device to be attached, enabling rescuers to continuously monitor the amount of positive-pressure being generated during forced lung inflation.  Pressure relief valves  A pressure relief valve (often known as a \\"pop-up valve\\") is typically included in pediatric versions and some adult versions, the purpose of which is to prevent accidental over-pressurization of the lungs. A bypass clip is usually incorporated into this valve assembly in case medical needs call for inflation at a pressure beyond the normal cutoff of the pop-up valve.  Device storage features  Some bags are designed to collapse for storage. A bag not designed to store collapsed may lose elasticity when stored compressed for long periods, reducing its effectiveness. The collapsible design has longitudinal scoring so that the bag collapses on the scoring \\"pivot point,\\" opposite to the direction of normal bag compression.  Manual resuscitator alternatives  In a hospital, long-term mechanical ventilation is provided by using a more complex, automated ventilator. However a frequent use of a manual resuscitator is to temporarily provide manual ventilation whenever troubleshooting of the mechanical ventilator is needed, if the ventilator circuit needs to be changed, or if there is a loss of electrical power or source of compressed air or oxygen. A rudimentary type of mechanical ventilator device that has the advantage of not needing electricity is a flow- restricted, oxygen-powered ventilation device (FROPVD). These are similar to manual resuscitators in that oxygen is pushed through a mask to force-inflate the patient's lungs, but unlike a manual resuscitator where the pressure used to force-inflate the patient's lungs comes from a person manually squeezing a bag, with the FROPVD the pressure needed to force-inflate the lungs comes directly from a pressurized oxygen cylinder. These devices will stop functioning when the compressed oxygen tank becomes depleted.  Types of manual resuscitators  * Self-inflating bags: This type of manual resuscitator is the standard design most often used in both in-hospital and out-of-hospital settings. The material used for the bag-portion of a self- inflating manual resuscitator has a \\"memory\\", meaning after it is manually compressed it will automatically re-expand on its own in between breaths (drawing in air for the next breath). These devices can be used alone (thus delivering room-air) or can be used in connection with an oxygen source to deliver nearly 100% oxygen. As a result of these features, this type of manual resuscitator is appropriate for in-hospital use and in out-of-hospital settings e.g., ambulances. * Flow-inflating bags: Also termed \\"anesthesia bags\\", these are a specialized form of manual resuscitator with a bag-portion that is flaccid and does not re-inflate on its own. This necessitates an external flow source of pressurized inflation gas for the bag to inflate; once inflated the provider can manually squeeze the bag or, if the patient is breathing on his/her own, the patient can inhale directly through the bag. These types of manual resuscitators are used extensively during anesthesia induction and recovery, and are often attached to anesthesia consoles so anesthesia gases can be used to ventilate the patient. They are primarily utilized by anesthesiologists administering general anesthesia, but also during some in-hospital emergencies which may involve anesthesiologists or respiratory therapists.

This is a political and cultural union of six Iroquoian-speaking Native American tribes residing in the present-day state of New York, northern Pennsylvania, and the eastern portion of the province of Ontario, Canada. Background The Great Peacemaker's name means \\"Two River Currents Flowing Together\\". Some of the numerous legends about the Great Peacemaker have conflicting information. It is reported that he was born a Huron, and by some accounts, his mother was a virgin, making the birth miraculous. Others say he was born an Onondaga and later adopted by the Mohawk.  Haudenosaunee confederacy  Cohoes Falls in the 18th century AD by Pehr Kalm. By all accounts, the Great Peacemaker was a prophet who counseled peace among the warring tribes, and he called for an end to ritual cannibalism. According to some legends, his first ally was Jigonhsasee. She lent her home for the meeting of the leaders of the rival tribal nations. The Great Peacemaker's follower Hiawatha, an Onondaga renowned for his oratory, helped him achieve his vision of bringing the tribes together in peace. According to the archaeologist Dean Snow, the Great Peacemaker converted Hiawatha in the territory of the Onondaga; he traveled alone to visit the Mohawk tribe who lived near what is now Cohoes, New York. Other traditional accounts hold that the Great Peacemaker consulted with Jigonhsasee about which tribal leaders to approach and she facilitated that meeting to create the confederacy. According to some legends, initially the Mohawk rejected the message of the Great Peacemaker, so he decided to perform a feat to demonstrate his purity and spiritual power. After climbing a tree high above Kahon:ios (Cohoes Falls), the Great Peacemaker told the Mohawk warriors to chop the tree down. Many onlookers watched as the Great Peacemaker disappeared into the swirling rapids of the Mohawk River. They believed he had died but the next morning they found him sitting near a campfire. Greatly impressed by the Great Peacemaker's miraculous survival, the Mohawk became the founding tribe of the Iroquois Confederacy.Nelson Greene, editor. \\"Chapter 9: Dekanawida and Hiawatha\\", History of the Mohawk Valley: Gateway to the West 1614-1925, Chicago: The S. J. Clarke Publishing Company, 1925, at Schenectady Digital History Archive The tribes gathered at Onondaga Lake, where they planted a Tree of Peace and proclaimed the Great Binding Law of the Iroquois Confederacy. Dates The dates Dekanawida lived, and thus the founding of the Confederacy, have not been identified with certainty. Historians and archeologists have researched an incident related in the oral history of the founding of the Confederacy. As recorded by later scholars, one account relates there was a violent conflict among the Seneca, who were the last Iroquois nation to join the confederacy as a founding member. Their violence stopped when the sun darkened and the day seemed to turn to night. Since 1902 scholars have studied the possibility that this event was a solar eclipse, as William Canfield suggested in his Legends of the Iroquois; told by \\"the Cornplanter\\" . As scholars have learned more about the representation of natural events in oral histories, scholars into the 21st century have noted eclipses that could serve to date the founding of the Confederacy, in addition to the archeological evidence. Scholars referring to an eclipse have included (chronologically): Paul A. W. Wallace, Elizabeth Tooker, Bruce E. Johansen, Dean R. Snow, Barbara A. Mann and Jerry L. Fields, William N. Fenton, David Henige, Gary Warrick, and Neta Crawford. Since Canfield's first mention, and the majority view, scholars have widely supported a date of 1451 AD as being of a known solar eclipse and the likely founding date based on this oral account and other evidence. Some argue it is an insufficient fit for the description, and favor a date of 1142, when there was also a documented solar eclipse. A few question dating the founding of the confederacy based on the mention of the eclipse. Archeological investigation has contributed to discussions about the founding date, as its evidence can be dated and correlated to natural events. In 1982 archeologist Dean Snow said that evidence from mainstream archeology did not support a founding of the confederacy for any dates of an eclipse before 1350 AD (thus ruling out the 1142 AD date.) By 1998 Fenton considered an eclipse earlier than the 1451 AD majority view unlikely, but possible as long as it was after 1000 AD. By 2007/8 reviews considered an 1142 AD eclipse as a possible point of reference, even if most scholars supported 1451 AD as the safe choice. Influence on the United States constitution This confederacy influenced the United States Constitution and Anglo-American ideas of democracy, as recognized by Concurrent Resolution 331 issued by the U. S. Congress in 1988, which states in part: > Whereas the original framers of the Constitution, including, most notably, > George Washington and Benjamin Franklin, are known to have greatly admired > the concepts of the Six Nations of the Iroquois Confederacy; Whereas the > confederation of the original Thirteen Colonies into one republic was > influenced by the political system developed by the Iroquois Confederacy as > were many of the democratic principles which were incorporated into the > Constitution itself Iroquois dominance The Great Peacemaker established a council of clan and village chiefs to govern the confederacy. In each tribe, which had matrilineal kinship systems of descent and property-holding, power was shared between the sexes. Men held the positions of hereditary chiefs through their mother's line; clan mothers ruled on the fitness of chiefs and could depose any that they opposed. Most decisions in council were made by consensus, to which each representative had an equal voice. Early anthropologist Lewis H. Morgan attributed the regional dominance achieved by the Iroquois to their superior organization and coordination compared to other tribes; George Hunt also thought there was a factor of economic determinism, with their need for furs for the European trade and their superior geographic position controlling most of central and western New York.PAUL A. W. WALLACE, \\"THE RETURN OF HIAWATHA\\", New York History, Vol. 29, No. 4 (October, 1948), pp. 385-403, Published by: New York State Historical Association , accessed 18 May 2015 The oral laws and customs of the Great Law of Peace became the constitution of the Iroquois Confederacy, established by the 16th century or earlier. Prophecy of the Boy Seer The Great Peacemaker worked all his life to bring his vision to fruition. He prophesied that a \\"white serpent\\" would come to his people's lands and make friends with them, only to deceive them later. A \\"red serpent\\" would later make war against the \\"white serpent\\", but a Native American boy would be given a great power. He would be accepted as a chosen leader by the people of \\"the land of the hilly country.\\" The boy stays neutral in the fight, and he speaks to the people, who number as the blades of grass, but he is heard by all. After a season, a \\"black serpent\\" would come and defeat both the \\"white\\" and \\"red serpents\\". According to the prophecy, when the people gathered under the elm tree become humble, all three \\"serpents\\" would be blinded by a light many times brighter than the sun. Deganawidah said that he would be that light. His nation would accept the \\"white serpent\\" into their safekeeping like a long-lost brother. In the Bah√° º√≠ Faith Some members of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith have connected the signs of a Prophet, as described by Bah√°'u'll√°h (Prophet-founder of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith), with the Peacemaker. As such, many Native American Bah√° º√≠s in North America (and some non-Native) revere the Peacemaker as a Manifestation of God.

There are four associated model courses V103/1 to V-103/4 which are approved by IMO and should be used when training VTS personnel for the VTS qualifications.VTS Manual IALA, Edition 6  Information service  An information service is a service to ensure that essential information becomes available in time for onboard navigational decision- making. The information service is provided by broadcasting information at fixed times and intervals or when deemed necessary by the VTS or at the request of a vessel, and may include for example reports on the position, identity and intentions of other traffic; waterway conditions; weather; hazards; or any other factors that may influence the vessel's transit.  Traffic organization service  A traffic organization service is a service to prevent the development of dangerous maritime traffic situations and to provide for the safe and efficient movement of vessel traffic within the VTS area. The traffic organization service concerns the operational management of traffic and the forward planning of vessel movements to prevent congestion and dangerous situations and is particularly relevant in times of high traffic density or when the movement of special transports may affect the flow of other traffic. The service may also include establishing and operating a system of traffic clearances or VTS sailing plans or both in relation to priority of movements, allocation of space, mandatory reporting of movements in the VTS area,routes to be followed, speed limits to be observed or other appropriate measures which are considered necessary by the VTS authority.

He is the author of Kaf Hachaim, a work of halakha that he came to be known by. Biography Sofer was born in Baghdad, Ottoman Iraq. He studied the Torah under Abdallah Somekh and the Ben Ish Hai. In 1904, he journeyed to Ottoman Palestine together with colleagues Sadqa Hussein and the Asei HaYa'ar in order to meet with the Rishon LeZion, known as the Yisa Berakha, and to pray at the graves of the righteous.Bar Osher, Avishai; Biography of Rabbi Yosef ·∏§ayyim, the Ben Ish Hai, pg. 6, Hebrew; cms.edu.gov.il After visiting Jerusalem, he decided to settle there permanently. He studied in the Bet El yeshiva in the Old City of Jerusalem, well known for the study of kabbalah. In 1909 he moved to the newly founded Shoshanim leDavid yeshiva.

Works In Kaf Hachaim (◊õ◊£ ◊î◊ó◊ô◊ô◊ù), Sofer discusses the halakha in light of the Rishonim and Acharonim. Kaf Hachaim, usually published in ten volumes, covers Orach Chayim (8 vol.) and parts of Yoreh De'ah (2 vol.). It is often compared to the Mishna Berura in terms of scope and approach, but differs in its more extensive reliance upon quotations. This work also surveys the views of many kabbalistic sages (particularly Isaac Luria), when these impact the Halakha. Shinun Halacha is a work summarising the Halakhic conclusions presented in Kaf Hachaim.

In the case of ionic crystals, the fluxes of the diffusing species are coupled, while in a plasma the various species diffuse at the same rate.  Diffusion in plasmas  In plasma physics, ambipolar diffusion is closely related to the concept of quasineutrality. In most plasmas, the forces acting on the ions are different from those acting on the electrons, so naively one would expect one species to be transported faster than the other, whether by diffusion or convection or some other process. If such differential transport has a divergence, then it results in a change of the charge density. The latter will in turn create an electric field that can alter the transport of one or both species in such a way that they become equal. The simplest example is a plasma localized in an unmagnetized vacuum. (See Inertial confinement fusion.) Both electrons and ions will stream outward with their respective thermal velocity. If the ions are relatively cold, their thermal velocity will be small. The thermal velocity of the electrons will be fast due to their high temperature and low mass: v_e \\\\approx \\\\sqrt{k_BT_e/m_e}. As the electrons leave the initial volume, they will leave behind a positive charge density of ions, which will result in an outwardly-directed electric field. This field will act on the electrons to slow them down and on the ions to speed them up. The net result is that both ions and electrons stream outward at the speed of sound, c_s \\\\approx \\\\sqrt{k_BT_e/m_i}, which is much smaller than the electron thermal velocity, but usually much larger than the ion thermal velocity. In astrophysics, \\"ambipolar diffusion\\" refers specifically to the decoupling of neutral particles from plasma, for example in the initial stage of star formation. The neutral particles in this case are mostly hydrogen molecules in a cloud that would undergo gravitational collapse if they were not collisionally coupled to the plasma. The plasma is composed of ions (mostly protons) and electrons, which are tied to the interstellar magnetic field and therefore resist collapse. In a molecular cloud where the fractional ionization is very low (one part per million or less), neutral particles only rarely encounter charged particles, and so are not entirely hindered in their collapse (note that now is dynamical collapse, not free fall) into a star.

He was born in Kashiwara, Osaka, Japan on April 26, 1910, and died in Tokyo on April 2, 1997. Tanaka was married to the actress Chieko Nakakita (1926 - 2005). He died of a stroke at the age of 86. Soon after graduating from Kansai University in 1940, Tanaka joined Taisho Studios which merged with Toho Studios in 1941. After four years with the company, he began producing his own films, and his first effort, Three Women of the North, was released in 1945. In his 60-year career with Toho, Tanaka produced more than 200 films. He is best known as the creator, with storyteller Shigeru Kayama, director Ishir≈ç Honda, writer Takeo Murata and special-effects wizard Eiji Tsuburaya, of Godzilla, the towering embodiment of post-World War II anxiety. Tanaka created Godzilla in 1954 in an effort to illustrate the terror Japanese felt after the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. In an interview in 1985 Tanaka summed up the symbolism of Godzilla: > In those days, Japanese had a real horror of radiation, and that horror is > what made Godzilla so huge. From the beginning he has symbolized nature's > revenge on mankind. The classic 1954 film Godzilla (1954; released in the U.S. in 1956 as Godzilla, King of the Monsters!) would spawn a series of sequels, adding up to 28 films by 2004. Tanaka produced every Toho monster movie up to his death in 1997. He often worked with the other three members of the Godzilla team: Honda, Tsuburaya, and composer Akira Ifukube, to complete such works as The Mysterians (1957) and Matango (1963). Tanaka produced six films directed by the acclaimed Akira Kurosawa. Their film Kagemusha (1980) was nominated for a Best Foreign Film Oscar and took the Palme d'Or at Cannes. The 1998 American reimagining of Godzilla was dedicated to his memory.

He now competes in the World Wrestling Council (WWC) under his real name, Eddie Col√≥n. He is the son of Carlos Col√≥n Sr. and the younger brother of Carly Col√≥n (performed in WWE under the ring name Carlito) and Stacy Col√≥n. He began wrestling in the World Wrestling Council (WWC), where he won the WWC Universal Heavyweight Championship five times, as well as numerous secondary and tertiary titles. In 2007, Col√≥n signed a developmental contract with WWE, being assigned to Florida Championship Wrestling (FCW). He was teamed with Eric P√©rez, forming a tag team known as The Puerto Rican Nightmares, and they became the first wrestlers to hold the FCW Florida Tag Team Championship. Upon being promoted to the main roster in 2008, he was teamed with Carlito. Subsequently, The Col√≥ns became the first team to hold the WWE Tag Team Championship and World Tag Team Championship at the same time, making them the first Unified WWE Tag Team Champions. After Carlito left the promotion, he began teaming with his cousin Epico Col√≥n, with whom he held the WWE Tag Team Championship once. He left WWE in 2020. Professional wrestling career=World Wrestling Council (1999‚Äì2007) Col√≥n debuted in 1999, wrestling in the cruiserweight division. He won the first title on February 10, 2001, when he defeated Damian Steele for the WWC World Junior Heavyweight Championship. His feud with Steele continued for a month, during which he dropped and recovered the title on March 10, 2001. He feuded over the title for six months, losing and winning it once. By autumn, Col√≥n was involved in a storyline involving Justin McCully, continuing a similar pattern. In early 2002, Col√≥n was involved in a storyline with Rey Mysterio Jr, who defeated Col√≥n for the title on January 6, 2002. Mysterio held the title for two months before dropping it back on April 6, 2002, which marked Col√≥n's final Junior Championship reign. Following a feud with Kid Kash, the belt was held up and Col√≥n ascended to the Heavyweight division. Shortly after Carly Col√≥n signed with WWE, a tournament was organized to determine the new champion. Col√≥n was considered an early favorite and reached the final, but lost. Col√≥n then entered a feud with El Diamante over the WWC Puerto Rico Heavyweight Championship. In late 2004, Col√≥n was involved in a battle royal for the first contender's position. One week later on November 6, 2004, Col√≥n defeated El Bronco and won the Universal Heavyweight Championship for the first time in his career. He then entered a feud with El Diamante, eventually dropping the title to him. On July 31, 2005, he formed a tag team with his father as part of the Funking Conservatory‚Äòs television show, !Bang!, competing against Dory Funk, Jr. and Johnny Magnum. The team was victorious, winning the promotion‚Äôs Television Tag Team Championship. On March 5, 2006, he participated in WCW Saturday Night tribute show World Wrestling Legends: 6:05 - The Reunion, he was defeated by Vampiro.

His in-ring wrestling debut on the Raw brand took place on August 25, when he defeated Charlie Haas, dressed as Carlito and named Charlito, in singles competition. After only one match on ‚Äò‚ÄôRaw‚Äô', Primo Col√≥n, now billed as simply ‚Äò‚Äô'Primo‚Äô'‚Äô, was moved to the SmackDown brand where his animosity for his brother was dropped and they formed a tag team. On the September 12 episode of ‚Äò‚ÄôSmackDown‚Äò‚Äô, he teamed with his brother Carlito to defeat WWE Tag Team Champions Curt Hawkins and Zack Ryder in a non-title match. Two weeks later, both teams competed in a title rematch, with The Col√≥ns winning to become WWE Tag Team Champions. In January 2009, The Col√≥ns entered a feud with World Tag Team Champions John Morrison and The Miz. On the WrestleMania XXV pre-show, The Col√≥ns defeated John Morrison and The Miz in a tag team unification match, becoming the first team to hold the newly dubbed ‚ÄúUnified WWE Tag Team Championship‚Äù. On April 6, they successfully defended their titles for the first time in a rematch. On April 15, both Primo and Carlito were drafted back to the Raw brand as part of the 2009 Supplemental draft. At The Bash, they lost the championship to the team of Edge and Chris Jericho, who were added to a standard tag team match between The Col√≥ns and The Legacy (Cody Rhodes and Ted DiBiase) moments before the match started. The Col√≥ns invoked their rematch clause the next night on ‚Äò‚ÄôRaw‚Äô', but were unsuccessful. On the July 6 episode of ‚Äò‚ÄôRaw‚Äô', they lost again to Edge and Jericho, and afterwards Carlito attacked Primo, leading to a feud between the two which ended after Carlito defeated Primo on the August 3 episode of ‚Äò‚ÄôRaw‚Äô'.

Italian maiolica dating from the Renaissance period is the most renowned. When depicting historical and mythical scenes, these works were known as istoriato wares (\\"painted with stories\\"). By the late 15th century, several places,L. Arnoux, 1877, British Manufacturing Industries ‚Äì Pottery \\"Most of the Italian towns had their manufactory, each of them possessing a style of its own. Beginning at Caffagiolo and Deruta, they extended rapidly to Gubbio, Ferrara, and Ravenna, to be continued to Casteldurante, Rimini, Urbino, Florence, Venice, and many other places.\\" mainly small cities in northern and central Italy, were producing sophisticated pieces for a luxury market in Italy and beyond. In France maiolica developed as faience, in the Netherlands and England as delftware, and in Mexico as talavera. In English the spelling was anglicised to majolica but the pronunciation usually preserved the vowel with an i as in kite (). Name Istoriato charger, Faenza, 1555 (Dallas Museum of Art) The name is thought to come from the medieval Italian word for Majorca, an island on the route for ships bringing Hispano-Moresque wares from Valencia to Italy. Moorish potters from Majorca are reputed to have worked in Sicily and it has been suggested that their wares reached the Italian mainland from Caltagirone.C. Drury E. Fortnum (1892) Maiolica, Chapman & Hall, London, quoted in E.A. Barber, (1915), Hispano Moresque Pottery, The Hispanic Society of America, New York, pp. 25‚Äì26. Also published in 1876 by Scribner, Welford, and Armstrong, New York. An alternative explanation of the name is that it comes from the Spanish term obra de M√°laga, denoting ‚Äú[imported] wares from M√°laga‚Äù,Sweetman, John (1987), The oriental obsession: Islamic inspiration in British and American art and architecture 1500‚Äì1920, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. or obra de m√©lequa, the Spanish name for lustre. In the 15th century, the term maiolica referred solely to lustreware, including both Italian-made and Spanish imports, and tin-glaze wares were known as bianchi (white ware).Alan Caiger- Smith, Lustre Pottery, London and Boston: Faber and Faber, 1985 By 1875 the term was in use describing ceramics made in Italy, lustred or not, of tin- glazed earthenware.C Drury E Fortnum, 1875, MAIOLICA Stanniferous Glazed Wares, South Kensington Museum Art Handbook No. 4. \\"It was found that by the addition of a certain portion of the oxide of tin to the composition of glass and oxide of lead the character of the glaze entirely alters. Instead of being translucent it becomes, on fusion, an opaque and beautifully white enamel... after immersion in the enamel bath, and subsequent drying, the painting is applied upon the absorbent surface; the piece being then subjected to the fire which, at one application, fixes the colours and liquifies the glaze. This \\"enamelled\\" pottery (emaillee) is by far the more important group of the glazed wares, being susceptible of decoration by the lustre pigments, as well as by painting in colours of great delicacy; and it comprises the Hispano- moresque, the real Maiolica, and the perfected earthenware of Italy and other countries.\\" http://www.ebooksread.com/authors-eng/c-drury-e-charles-drury- edward-fortnum/maiolica-tro/1-maiolica-tro.shtml> With the Spanish conquest of Mexico, tin-glazed maiolica wares came to be produced in the Valley of Mexico as early as 1540, at first in imitation of tin-glazed pottery imported from Seville.Florence C. Lister and Robert H. Lister, Sixteenth Century Maiolica Pottery in the Valley of Mexico (Tucson: Anthropological Papers of the University of Arizona) 1982. Mexican maiolica is known famously as 'Talavera'. \\"By a convenient extension and limitation the name may be applied to all tin- glazed ware, of whatever nationality, made in the Italian tradition ... the name fa√Øence (or the synonymous English 'delftware') being reserved for the later wares of the 17th Century onwards, either in original styles (as in the case of the French) or, more frequently, in the Dutch-Chinese (Delft) tradition.\\"Honey, p.387 The term \\"maiolica\\" is sometimes applied to modern tin-glazed ware made by studio potters.(as in Osterman's book, see below) Tin-glazed earthenware Dish with bird, in Islamic-derived style, Orvieto, 1270‚Äì1330 (Victoria and Albert Museum) Tin glazing creates a white, opaque surface for painting. The colours are applied as metallic oxides or as fritted underglazes to the unfired glaze, which absorbs pigment like fresco, making errors impossible to fix, but preserving the brilliant colors. Sometimes the surface is covered with a second glaze (called coperta by the Italians) that lends greater shine and brilliance to the wares. In the case of lustred wares, a further oxygen-starved firing at a lower temperature is required. Kilns required wood as well as suitable clay. Glaze was made from sand, wine lees, lead compounds and tin compounds.Cipriano Piccolpasso, ‚Äò‚ÄòThe Three Books of the Potter‚Äôs Art‚Äô‚Äô, (translated by Ronald Lightbown and Alan Caiger-Smith), London, Scolar Press, 1980 Tin-glazed earthenware is frequently prone to flaking and somewhat delicate. Analysis of samples of Italian maiolica pottery from the Middle Ages has indicated that tin was not always a component of the glaze, whose chemical composition varied.'Tin-lead ratio of late Middle Age majolica glazes of some important Italian sites.' A.Krajewski, A.Ravaglioli, G.W.Carriveau. J.Mat.Sci.Lett. 11, No.12,1992.Pg.848‚Äì851. The fifteenth- century wares that initiated maiolica as an art form were the product of an evolution in which medieval lead-glazed earthenwares were improved by the addition of tin oxides under the influence of Islamic wares imported through Sicily.Richard A. Goldthwaite, \\"The Economic and Social World of Italian Renaissance Maiolica\\" Renaissance Quarterly, 42.1 (Spring 1989 pp. 1‚Äì32) p. 1. Such archaic waresHugo Blake, \\"The archaic maiolica of North-Central Italy: Montalcino, Assisi and Tolentino\\", Faenza, 66 (1980) pp. 91‚Äì106. are sometimes called \\"proto-maiolica\\".David Whitehouse, \\"Proto-maiolica\\" Faenza 66 (1980), pp 77‚Äì83. During the later fourteenth century, the limited palette of colours for earthenware decorated with coloured lead glazes (no added tin oxide) was expanded from the traditional manganese purple and copper green to include cobalt blue, antimony yellow and iron-oxide orange. Sgraffito wares were also produced, in which the white tin-oxide glaze was scratched through to produce a design from the revealed body of the ware. Scrap sgraffito ware excavated from kilns in Bacchereto, Montelupo and Florence show that such wares were produced more widely than at Perugia and Citt√† di Castello, the places to which they have been traditionally attributed.Galeazzo Cora, Storia della Maiolica di Firenze e del Contado. Secoli XIV e XV (Florence: Sassoni) 1973 History of production Refined production of tin-glazed earthenwares made for more than local needs was concentrated in central Italy from the later thirteenth century, especially in the contada of Florence. The medium was also adopted by the Della Robbia family of Florentine sculptors. The city itself declined in importance as a centre of maiolica production in the second half of the fifteenth century, perhaps because of local deforestation, and manufacture was scattered among small communes,Galeazzo Cora (1973) noted kilns dispersed at Bacchereto (a center of production from the fourteenth century), Puntormo, Prato and Pistoia, none of them site-names that have circulated among connoisseurs and collectors. and, after the mid-fifteenth century, at Faenza. Potters from Montelupo set up the potteries at Cafaggiolo. In 1490,Reproduced in Cora 1973. twenty-three master-potters of Montelupo agreed to sell the year's production to Francesco Antinori of Florence; Montelupo provided the experienced potters who were set up in 1495 at the Villa Medicea di Cafaggiolo by its Medici owners.In the villa's 1498 inventory, it is noted that in the villa's piazza murata (the walled enclosure), there are fornaze col portico da cuocere vaselle (\\"kilns for baking pottery\\"), let to Piero and Stefano foraxari, the \\"kilnmasters\\" of the maiolica manufactory for which Cafaggiolo is famed. These are Piero and Stefano di Filippo da Montelupo, who started up the kilns under Medici patronage in 1495, earlier than has been thought (Cora 1973 gave a date 1498); John Shearman, \\"The Collections of the Younger Branch of the Medici\\" The Burlington Magazine 117 No. 862 (January 1975), pp. 12, 14‚Äì27 gives 1495, based on a document. In the fifteenth century, Florentine wares spurred the production of maiolica at Arezzo and Siena. Deruta ware dish, 2nd quarter of the 16th century, shows the full range of glaze colors (Victoria and Albert Museum) Italian maiolica reached an astonishing degree of perfection in this period. In Romagna, Faenza, which gave its name to faience, produced fine maiolica from the early fifteenth century; it was the only significant city in which ceramic production industry became a major part of the economy.Goldthwaite 1989:14. Bologna produced lead-glazed wares for export. Orvieto and Deruta both produced maioliche in the fifteenth century. In the sixteenth century, maiolica production was established at Castel Durante, Urbino, Gubbio and Pesaro. The early sixteenth century saw the development of istoriato wares on which historical and mythical scenes were painted in great detail. The State Museum of Medieval and Modern Art in Arezzo claims to have the largest collection of istoriato wares in Italy. Istoriato wares are also well represented in the British Museum, London. Some maiolica was produced as far north as Padua, Venice and Turin and as far south as Palermo and Caltagirone in SicilyRackham, p. 9; Caiger-Smith p.82 and Laterza in Apulia. In the seventeenth century Savona began to be a prominent place of manufacture. The variety of styles that arose in the sixteenth century all but defies classification. Goldthwaite notesGoldthwaite 1989: p.6 that Paride Berardi's morphology of Pesaro maioliche comprises four styles in 20 sub- groups; Tiziano Mannoni categorized Ligurian wares in four types, eight sub- categories and 36 further divisions; Galeazzo Cora's morphology of Montelupo's production is in 19 groups and 51 categories. The diversity of styles can best be seen in a comparative study of apothecary jars produced between the 15th and 18th centuries. Italian cities encouraged the pottery industry by offering tax relief, citizenship, monopoly rights and protection from outside imports. An important mid-sixteenth century document for the techniques of maiolica painting is the treatise of Cipriano Piccolpasso.The standard English translation is The Three Books of the Potter's Art, translated and introduced by Ronald Lightbown and Alan Caiger-Smith, (London) 1980. The work of individual sixteenth-century masters like Nicola da Urbino, Francesco Xanto Avelli, Guido Durantino and Orazio Fontana of Urbino, Mastro Giorgio of Gubbio and Maestro Domenigo of Venice has been noted. Gubbio lustre used colours such as greenish yellow, strawberry pink and a ruby red. Lodi, Italy, Ferretti factory, 1770-75 The tradition of fine maiolica came under increasing competition in the 18th century, mainly from porcelain and white earthenware. But the 18th century is not a period of relentless decline. To face the competition from porcelain and its vibrant colours, the process of third firing (piccolo fuoco) was introduced, initially in North-West Europe around the mid of century. After the traditional two firings at 950 ¬∞C, the vitrified glaze was painted with colours that would have degraded at such high temperatures, and was fired a third time at a lower temperature, about 600-650 ¬∞C. New vibrant colours were thus introduced, in particular red and various shades of pink obtained from gold chloride. It is believed that one of the first to introduce this technique in Italy was Ferretti in Lodi, in northern Italy. Lodi maiolica had already reached high quality in the second quarter of the 18th century. With the introduction of the third firing technique, and with the increasing interest in botany and scientific observation, a refined production of maiolica decorated with naturalistic flowers was developed. Italian maiolica remains commonly produced in many centres, both in folk art forms and reproductions of the historic style. Some of the principal centers of production (e.g. Deruta and Montelupo) still produce maiolica, which is sold worldwide. Modern maiolica looks different from old maiolica because its glaze is usually opacified with the cheaper zircon rather than tin, though there are potteries that specialise in making authentic-looking Renaissance- style pieces with genuine tin-glaze.

In response to this action, amid rumors that blood had been shed, alarm spread through the countryside to Connecticut and beyond, and American Patriots sprang into action, fearing that war was at hand. Thousands of militiamen began streaming toward Boston and Cambridge, and mob action forced Loyalists and some government officials to flee to the protection of the British Army. Although it proved to be a false alarm, the Powder Alarm caused political and military leaders to proceed more carefully in the days ahead, and essentially provided a \\"dress rehearsal\\" for the Battles of Lexington and Concord seven and a half months later. Furthermore, actions on both sides to control weaponry, gunpowder, and other military supplies became more contentious, as the British sought to bring military stores more directly under their control, and the Patriot colonists sought to acquire them for their own use. Background In 1772, many of the thirteen British colonies, in response to unpopular British actions and the negative British reaction to the Gaspee Affair (the destruction by colonists of a grounded ship involved in enforcing customs regulations), elected to form Committees of Correspondence. These allowed communities to formally communicate with each other, raise awareness of incidents occurring elsewhere, and to coordinate actions;Tagney, pp. 65‚Äì67 as such, they became instrumental in managing the colonial response to enforcement of the Tea Act, the Intolerable Acts, and other unpopular British colonial legislation. The colonists of Massachusetts had not yet taken concerted action to organize themselves militarily against actions of the British regulars, although statements were made about supporting Boston (whose port had been closed earlier in 1774 under the Boston Port Act) \\"at the risque of our lives and fortunes.\\"Tagney, pp. 68‚Äì75 (emphasis in original) General Thomas Gage, who had become the military governor of Massachusetts in May 1774, was charged with enforcement of the highly unpopular Intolerable Acts, which British Parliament had passed in response to the Boston Tea Party. Seeking to prevent the outbreak of war and to keep the peace between the American Patriot (Whig) majority and the Loyalist (Tory) minority, he believed that the best way to accomplish this was by secretly removing military stores from storehouses and arsenals in New England.Frothingham, p. 13Fischer, p. 43 The secrecy of these missions was paramount, as Gage feared that leakage of any plans would result in the seizure or concealment of the stores by Patriot sympathizers before his men got there. Major William Brattle There were several places throughout the colonies where the British army had stockpiled supplies. Some of these places were fortifications that were manned by small garrisons; others were merely locked magazines. Most of the powder in these was under the control of the provincial government, though some was the property of individual towns. One locked storehouse near Boston, in what was then part of Charlestown, now Powder House Square in Somerville, was controlled by William Brattle, the leader of the provincial militia and an appointee of the governor. Brattle, who had not obviously sided with either Loyalists or Patriots, notified Governor Gage in a letter dated August 27 that the provincial (\\"King's\\") powder was the only supply remaining in that storehouse, as the towns had removed all of theirs.Richmond, p. 5 Gage decided that this powder had to be brought to Boston for safekeeping. The Powder House (\\"Magazine\\") is near the northern edge of this detail from a 1775 map of the Siege of Boston. Expedition On August 31, Gage sent Middlesex County sheriff David Phips to Brattle with orders to remove the provincial powder; Brattle turned the key to the powderhouse over to Phips. Gage also gave orders to ready a force of troops for action the next day, something that did not go unnoticed by the local population.Richmond, p. 6 At some point that day, General Gage, whether by his intent, accident, or theft by a messenger, lost possession of William Brattle's letter; the widely held story is that it was dropped. News of its content spread rapidly, and many considered it to be a warning to Gage to remove the provincial powder before Patriots could seize it.Richmond, pp. 52‚Äì56 Early in the morning of September 1, a force of roughly 260 British regulars from the 4th Regiment, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel George Maddison, were rowed in secrecy up the Mystic River from Boston to a landing point near Winter Hill in modern-day Somerville. From there they marched about a mile to the Powder House, a gunpowder magazine that held the largest supply of gunpowder in Massachusetts. Phips gave the King's Troops the keys to the building, and after sunrise they removed all of the gunpowder. Most of the regulars then returned to Boston the way they had come, but a small contingent marched to Cambridge, removed two field pieces, and took them to Boston by foot over the Great Bridge and up Boston Neck.Fischer, pp. 44‚Äì45 The field pieces and powder were then taken from Boston to the British stronghold on Castle Island, then known as Castle William (renamed Fort Independence in 1779).Richmond, p. 7 Response to the raid Rumors flew throughout the day across the countryside about the British troop movements. The regulars were marching; provincial powder had been seized; war was at hand; people had been killed; Boston was being bombarded by His Majesty's warships. The alarm spread as far as Connecticut. From all over the region, people took up arms and began streaming toward Boston. One traveler in Shrewsbury reported that in the space of 15 minutes, 50 men had gathered, equipped themselves, sent out messengers to surrounding towns, and left for Boston.Fischer, p. 46 On September 2, several thousand men bent on violence gathered in Cambridge, where they forced several notable Loyalists, including William Brattle, to flee to Boston and the protection of the military. Sheriff Phips was forced, in writing, to dissociate himself from any and all government actions.Fischer pp. 47‚Äì48 Eventually facts caught up with the rumors, and militia units (some of which were still heading toward Boston) returned home.French, pp. 122‚Äì125 Also on September 2, Boston newspapers published a letter from William Brattle in which he protested that he had not warned Gage to remove the powder; Gage had requested from him an accounting of the storehouse's contents, and he had complied. The content of his letter to Gage would be published on September 5. Brattle remained on Castle Island through the siege of Boston, leaving when the British evacuated the city in March 1776. He died in Halifax, Nova Scotia in October 1776 at the age of 70.Richmond, pp. 57‚Äì58 British reaction Gage, surprised by the size and scope of the colonial reaction, delayed and eventually cancelled a second planned expedition to the storehouse in Worcester.French, pp. 126‚Äì141 He concentrated his troops in Boston, and called for reinforcements from London, writing \\"if you think ten thousand men sufficient, send twenty; if one million is thought enough, give two; you save both blood and treasure in the end.\\"Fischer, p. 51 However, Gage's request was seen by some in London as absurd, as there were only 12,000 troops in Britain at the time, but he did eventually receive an additional 400 Marines in response to these requests. He later began planning and executing seizures again, and he further fortified the Boston peninsula. Colonial reaction A 2007 photograph of the Old Powder House in Nathan Tufts Park, Somerville, Massachusetts After the Powder Alarm, militia forces throughout New England were more cautious with their supplies and more intent on gaining information about Gage's plans and troop movements. Paul Revere played a significant role in distributing this information because of his geographical position in Boston, his social position as a middle-class craftsman in contact with all social classes, and his political position as a well-known Patriot propagandist and organizer. The colonists organize On September 21, Patriot leaders met in Worcester and urged town meetings to organize a third of the militias into special companies of minutemen in constant readiness to march.Provincial Congress Journals, pp. 642‚Äì644 They also instituted the system of express riders and alarms that would prove to be critical at Lexington and Concord.French, p. 170 In October, the former legislature of Massachusetts met in defiance of the Massachusetts Government Act and declared itself to be the First Provincial Congress. It created a Committee of Safety modeled after a body with the same name during the English Civil War and it recommended that a quarter of the militia be designated as minutemen. Military stores were to be stockpiled away from the coast (more than a convenient day's march), to make attempts to seize them more difficult. The largest stockpiles were located at Concord and Worcester.French, p. 160 Portsmouth Alarm Early in December, British military command voted to prohibit the export of arms and powder to North America, and to secure all remaining stores. On December 12, intelligence received by Paul Revere indicated that a seizure of stores at Fort William and Mary in Portsmouth, New Hampshire was imminent. He rode from Boston to Portsmouth the next day to notify the local Patriots, who quickly raided the fort on December 14 and removed its supplies. Revere's intelligence had been incorrect; although a British operation had been contemplated, it had not been ordered. The British did send ships carrying troops to Portsmouth, and they arrived three days after the fort's supplies were removed. The first arrived on December 17, and was directed into shallows at high tide by a local Patriot pilot, much to the captain's anger.Fischer, pp. 52‚Äì57 Stores of gunpowder‚Äîtypically referred to by Loyalists as \\"the King's powder\\" but in contrast by Patriots as \\"the militia's powder\\"‚Äîwere also carried off from forts in Newport, Rhode Island, Providence, Rhode Island, and New London, Connecticut, and distributed to the militias in towns away from the coast.Bancroft, pp. 183‚Äì184 Cannon and other supplies were smuggled out of Boston and Charlestown.Tagney, p. 130 Salem confrontation On February 27, 1775, HMS Lively brought a force of about 240 British regulars from the 64th Regiment under Colonel Alexander Leslie to confiscate weapons in Salem, Massachusetts. They were stopped by a small crowd that raised a drawbridge in their path and taunted them while others moved the cannon to safety and sent for help from nearby towns. Eventually, the drawbridge was lowered and the regulars were permitted to search the forge where the cannon had once been. They returned to their ship while being mocked by a growing force of irregulars marching along in lock-step next to them. There were minor scuffles, but no shots were fired.Tagney, pp. 140‚Äì142 See also * Gunpowder Incident‚Äîa similar event in Virginia NotesReferences    Further reading * (A fictionalized account of the Portsmouth Alarm) * * (includes a chapter discussing this incident) * External links * John Rowe's Diary, September 1‚Äì4, 1774 at the Massachusetts Historical Society * Abigail Adams' letter to John Adams describing the events * Article on theft of cannon from Boston in the wake of the Alarm * Leslie's Retreat (a recounting of the Salem confrontation) * Portsmouth Alarm exhibit at the University of New Hampshire Category:1774 in the Thirteen Colonies Category:1775 in the Thirteen Colonies Category:American Revolutionary War Category:Battles and conflicts without fatalities Category:History of Boston Category:Boston campaign Category:History of the Thirteen Colonies Category:1774 in Massachusetts Category:Massachusetts in the American Revolution ","title":"Powder Alarm"},{"id":"1862346","title":"Hong Kong &amp; Kowloon Ferry"},{"id":"1862352","text":"U.S. Route 121 (US 121) is a proposed U.S. highway designated as the Coalfields Expressway, a four-lane highway stretching from Beckley, West Virginia, to Pound, Virginia, approximately in length.

The Coalfields Expressway will depart from U.S. 23 in Pound, Virginia, in Wise County, and roughly follow Virginia State Route 83 in Buchanan County to West Virginia Route 83 in McDowell County, West Virginia. Then it will travel northeast through depressed areas of West Virginia, paralleling West Virginia Route 16 through Wyoming and Raleigh counties. It will then run toward an expanded Interstate 64/Interstate 77 interchange near Beckley. The roadways US 121 will replace are deficient in the fact that the existing roadways have limited passing opportunities, steep grades, and low design speeds.

Following the election of Governor Jim Justice in 2016, the newly elected Governor began aggressively pushing for the highway's completion. Governor Justice requested $54.4 million for grading in Wyoming County. The construction would be financed through raising taxes. In an upcoming ballot issue to approve of road bonds, Governor Justice allocated $55 million to extend the road from Slab Fork to Mullens and eventually to Welch. The ballot issue passed.

It is considered the classical Japanese style. From the Muromachi period (15th century), the term Yamato-e has been used to distinguish work from contemporary Chinese-style paintings , which were inspired by Chinese Song and Yuan-era ink wash paintings. Characteristic features of Yamato-e include many small figures and careful depictions of details of buildings and other objects, the selection of only some elements of a scene to be fully depicted, the rest either being ignored or covered by a \\"floating cloud\\", an oblique view from above showing interiors of buildings as though through a cutaway roof, and very stylised depiction of landscape. Yamato-e very often depict narrative stories, with or without accompanying text, but also show the beauty of nature, with famous places or the four seasons . The pictures are often on scrolls that can be hung on a wall (), handscrolls () that are read from right to left, or on a folding screen () or panel (). Although they received their name from the Yamato period, no Yamato-e paintings from this period survive, nor from several centuries afterwards. Yamato-e pictures rather stand for a style and are not restricted to a particular period. There was a revival of the Yamato-e style in the 15th century by the Tosa school, including a return to narrative subjects, and although the rival Kan≈ç school grew out of the alternative tradition of Chinese-style works, the style it developed from the late 16th century for large paintings decorating Japanese castles included some elements of the Yamato-e style. In the 17th century, the simplified and stylised depiction of landscape backgrounds in Yamato-e was revived as a style for large landscape works by the Rinpa school. Later the narrative element of Yamato-e, the interest in the depiction of everyday life, and the choice of oblique and partial views in a composition heavily influenced the ukiyo-e style, as well as the Nihonga. Rinpa school version of Yamato-e landscape style on a pair of screens by Tawaraya S≈çtatsu, 17th century History Scene from the Genji Monogatari Emaki Emaki, 12th century, Tokugawa Art Museum \\"Eastern House Chapter\\", another scene from the Genji Monogatari Emaki illustrated handscroll of The Tale of Genji Shigisan-engi, the \\"flying storehouse\\" scene, 12th century Uji Bridge Screen, an example of later Yamato-e from the 17th century The term Yamato-e is found in Heian texts, although the precise range of works it covered then, and also in subsequent periods, is a much debated topic. There are also references showing a distinction within Yamato-e between \\"women's painting\\" and \\"men's painting\\". This distinction is also much debated but the typical assumptions as to its meaning can be illustrated by works from each group discussed in the next two sections; both are famous masterpieces and National Treasures of Japan. The range of works discussed below, all usually considered to be embraced by the term Yamato-e, is considerable, but most are narrative handscrolls with many small figures. There were evidently also many screens and works in other formats in the various styles, of which few traces remain. The Yamato-e style is apparent in the landscape background of some of the Buddhist paintings which are the most numerous survivals of Heian painting. The Genji Monogatari Emaki The oldest Yamato-e works to survive are four famous 12th century handscrolls of parts of The Tale of Genji, three in the Tokugawa Art Museum in Nagoya, with another from the same set in the Gotoh Museum in Tokyo; together they are known as the Genji Monogatari Emaki. Only a small proportion, about 15%, of the original survives, assuming this was complete. The original scrolls would have totalled about 450 feet long, in 20 rolls which alternate text with images, containing over 100 paintings, with over 300 sections of calligraphy. The surviving scrolls consist of only 19 paintings, 65 sheets of text, and 9 pages of fragments.Okudaira, 109 The paintings show an already mature tradition that has developed a considerable way from its Chinese origins. Conventions include the angled view from above into roofless rooms, and very simplified facial details, allowing minimal expressiveness. The colours are fresh and bright, built up in a technique called where a first outline is covered by several layers of pigment, with final lines added on top. Only one example survives from so early comparable to the painted screens shown at the rear in the interior scene illustrated.Paine, 133‚Äì135; the one screen from this period shows a panoramic landscape and small figures; image As female figures, mostly shown in a state of elegant lassitude, far outnumber the men, this is taken as an exemplar of \\"women's painting\\". The Legend of Mount Shigi The Shigisan-engi or \\"Legend of Mount Shigi\\" tells the story of the 9th century Shingon monk Myoren, founder of the Chogosonshi-ji temple. Like contemporary Western hagiographies, the narrative contains miracles, including a famous episode of the \\"flying storehouse\\" (illustrated). The story takes place mostly among ordinary country people, and is shown as one continuous picture about 30 feet long, with the same characters recurring in different scenes which are connected by a continuous background (something also found in medieval Western art). The images are done in a very different technique, with ink drawing lightly coloured by washes. Most figures are men, and when women are shown, as in another scene where the missing rice returns, they are shown in a very different way to the figures in the Genji Monogatari Emaki. Facial features are shown in far more detail than in the Genji Monogatari Emaki, and a wide range of expressions are expertly depicted. This is an example of one version of what \\"men's painting\\" is taken to refer to. Other works The Murasaki Shikibu Diary Emaki is a now-incomplete illustrated version of The Diary of Lady Murasaki, the author of The Tale of Genjii, today surviving in four sections, with images of court ceremonies. An early military and political work is the Ban Dainagon Ekotoba (The Tale of Great Minister Ban), a late 12th century (handscroll painting) depicting the events of the ≈åtenmon Conspiracy, an event of Japan's early Heian period. The painting, attributed to Tokiwa Mitsunaga, is over 20 m long and about 31.5 cm tall. The Ch≈çj≈´-jinbutsu-giga represents a very different style within Yamato-e, with very lively pen drawings of men and anthropomorphic animals in a number of scenes. Rather more examples survive from the following Kamakura period (1185‚Äì1333), including many showing scenes of life among the ordinary people, and also stories of wars from Japanese history. The M≈çko Sh≈´rai Ekotoba (Illustrated Account of the Mongol Invasion) are a pair of illustrated handscrolls from between 1275 and 1293. They were commissioned by the samurai Takezaki Suenaga in order to record his battlefield valour and deeds during the Mongol invasions of Japan. From near the end of the first period of works in the style, the Y≈´ki Kassen Ekotoba is a handscroll nearly 3 metres long, with a single wide battle scene after a text section, illustrating the suicide of Ashikaga Mochiuji after his rebellion in 1439.Shihon Chakushoku Y≈´ki Kassen Ekotoba, Cultural Heritage Online accessed on July 26, 2012 Artists Famous artists include: *Kose Kanaoka *Tosa Mitsuoki *Tosa Mitsunobu *Awataguchi Takamitsu See also *Ink and wash painting NotesReferences *Okudaira, Hideo, \\"Narrative picture scrolls\\", in Arts of Japan Volume 5, 1973, Weatherhill *Paine, Robert Treat, in: Paine, R.

The geyser was first seen erupting in late 1900. Its eruptions were observed reaching up to in height, and it excited worldwide interest. Day trip visitors from Rotorua were keen to see the geyser erupting regularly for 5‚Äì6 hours out of a cycle of about 36 hours, and a tourist trip called the \\"Round Trip\\" ran from the summer of 1902/1903.Information panel \\"Waimangu Geyser 1900-1904\\" at geyser site The geyser was the catalyst for tourism to the Waimangu Valley. Its workings were apparently created by the great 1886 Mount Tarawera eruption. The water expelled by the geyser was black with rocks and mud from the surrounding terrain, so the indigenous MƒÅori people named the geyser Waimangu, meaning 'Black Waters'. The geyser gave its name to the surrounding geothermal region, the Waimangu Volcanic Rift Valley. Joseph Perry of the Limelight Department of the Salvation Army filmed the Waimangu Geyser in action. In August 1903, tourist guide Alfred Warbrick measured the depth of the geyser lake at only when he launched a rowboat on the lake as a result of a dare. The lake's shallow depth was attributed to much of the ejected solid material falling back into the vent each time. On 30 August 1903,Information panel at Warbrick Terraces New Zealand rugby international Joe Warbrick, David McNaughton, and sisters Ruby and Catherine Nicholls were killed after venturing close to the edge of the geyser, having ignored requests from Warbrick's brother Alfred to return to a safe distance. The four were scalded and then swept away in a sudden violent eruption. ‚Äì \\"Rootsweb is currently unavailable\\", 1 January 2018. In mid-1904, the geyser became dormant for several weeks and subsequent eruptions were shorter and weaker until they stopped on 1 November 1904. This coincided with a landslide that changed the water table of Lake Tarawera by several metres. While it was hypothesized that this was the cause for the extinction of the geyser, later studies found no apparent physical connection between these two events. The geyser became extinct in 1908. Afterwards, hydrothermal activity in the nearby Echo Crater increased, leading to eruptions in the crater in 1915, 1917, and 1924.

Written in exile in the United States, it tells the story of Cheng's arrest during the first days of the Cultural Revolution, her more than six years' confinement, release, persecution, efforts to leave China, and early life in exile. Cheng was arrested in late 1966 after the Red Guards looted her home. During her confinement, she was pressured to make a false confession that she was a spy for \\"the imperialists\\" because for many years after the death of her husband she had continued to work as a senior partner for Shell in Shanghai. Cheng refused to provide a false confession, and was tortured as a result. She was eventually paroled under the pretense that her attitude had shown improvement. However, Cheng resisted leaving the detention house without receiving acknowledgment from her captors that she had been unjustly treated. When released from jail in 1973, Cheng found that her daughter Meiping, who had been studying to become a film actress, had been murdered by the Red Guards, although the official position was that she had committed suicide. Cheng conducted a discreet investigation and found that this scenario was impossible. After being relocated from her spacious home to a mere two bedrooms on the second floor of a two-story building, Cheng continued her life under constant surveillance, including spying by the family on the first floor. She lived in China until 1980, when the political climate warmed enough for her to apply for a visa to the United States to visit family. She never returned, first emigrating to Canada, and later to Washington, D.C., where she wrote the autobiography. The autobiography goes into great detail about her persecution, confinement and torture, so much so that the author had to put the manuscript away many times as she wrote it because the memories were so troubling.

DDE allows programs to manipulate objects provided by other programs, and respond to user actions affecting those objects. DDE was partially superseded by Object Linking and Embedding (OLE), and is currently maintained in Windows systems only for the sake of backward compatibility.  History and architecture  Dynamic Data Exchange was first introduced in 1987 with the release of Windows 2.0 as a method of interprocess communication so that one program could communicate with or control another program, somewhat like Sun's RPC (Remote Procedure Call). At the time, the only method for communication between the operating system and client applications was the \\"Windows Messaging Layer.\\" DDE extended this protocol to allow peer-to-peer communication among client applications, via message broadcasts. Because DDE runs via message broadcasts, it is vulnerable to any window-management code that does not pump messages. This problem was not considered during the design of DDE, because DDE predates pre-emptive multitasking. Moreover, any code managing a window handle can respond to a DDE broadcast; the initiator of DDE must distinguish between expected and unexpected responses. DDE interlocutors usually express what information they seek in terms of hierarchical string keys. For example, a cell in Microsoft Excel was known to DDE by its \\"application\\" name. Each application could further organize information by groups known as \\"topic\\" and each topic could serve up individual pieces of data as an \\"item\\". For example, if a user wanted to pull a value from Microsoft Excel which was contained in a spreadsheet called \\"Book1.xls\\" in the cell in the first row and first column, the application would be \\"Excel\\", the topic \\"Book1.xls\\" and the item \\"r1c1\\". Internal changes in the cell due to Excel actions would then be signaled (in reverse) to the calling application via additional message broadcasts.  Relationship to modern automation technologies  The common use of DDE is for custom-developed applications to control off-the-shelf software. For example, a custom in-house application might use DDE to open a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet and fill it with data, by opening a DDE conversation with Excel and sending it DDE commands. This feature has mainly been superseded by the Component Object Model suite of technologies. Microsoft has not used DDE internally since the release of Windows 95. For example, Excel now exposes an extensive OLE Automation object model, which is the recommended method for communicating with Excel. The technique is, however, still in use, particularly for distribution of financial data.Joel Spolsky - comment on Fog Creek Software discussion forum Because DDE does not require more operating system components than a conventional Windows GUI program, it is also a [little-used] alternative for programs seeking to minimize their dependencies.  NetDDE  Wonderware developed an extension for DDE called NetDDE that could be used to initiate and maintain the network connections needed for DDE conversations between DDE-aware applications running on different computers in a network and transparently exchange data. A DDE conversation is an interaction between client and server applications. NetDDE could be used along with DDE and the DDE management library (DDEML) in applications. \`/Windows/SYSTEM32 DDESHARE.EXE (DDE Share Manager) NDDEAPIR.EXE (NDDEAPI Server Side) NDDENB32.DLL (Network DDE NetBIOS Interface) NETDDE.EXE (Network DDE - DDE Communication)\` The NetDDE library files Microsoft licensed a basic (NetBIOS Frames protocol only) version of the product for inclusion in various versions of Windows from Windows for Workgroups to Windows XP. In addition, Wonderware also sold an enhanced version of NetDDE to their own customers that included support for TCP/IP. The technology is extensively used in the SCADA field. Basic Windows applications using NetDDE are Clipbook Viewer, WinChat and Microsoft Hearts. NetDDE was still included with Windows Server 2003 and Windows XP Service Pack 2, although it was disabled by default. It has been removed entirely in Windows Vista.NetDDE has been removed in Windows Vista. However, this will not prevent existing versions of NetDDE from being installed and functioning on later versions of Windows.

He serves as representative of the 1st District of Marikina City since June 2016. During the term of President Gloria Arroyo, Fernando served as Chairman of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority (MMDA) where he gained notability and mixed public reactions on his style of governance. He announced his intention to run for President of the Philippines in the 2010 general elections, but after talks with Richard Gordon, he agreed to run instead as Vice-President under Gordon's newly established party, Bagumbayan. Fernando lost in the 2010 elections, placing fourth in the polls. Early life and career Bayani Fernando was born in San Juan del Monte, Rizal (now part of the Metro Manila) to Gil Fernando and Remedios Flores and finished his secondary education at the Marikina School of Arts and Trades (now Marikina Science High School). He finished college with a degree on Mechanical Engineering at the Map√∫a Institute of Technology. Political life=Mayor of Marikina City Fernando first ran for public office in 1992, becoming mayor of Marikina City. His administration as mayor transformed the former municipality into one of the best-managed cities and a paradigm of responsive and effective governance. His term saw the transformation of Marikina from a 4th class municipality to a model Philippine city accorded with 55 citations and distinctions. He was re- elected mayor twice, serving until 2001. He was succeeded by his wife, Ma. Lourdes C. Fernando. Chairmanship In 2002, he was appointed Chairman of the Metropolitan Manila Development Authority by President Gloria Macapagal- Arroyo, directing him to duplicate his transformation work in Marikina City, but for the entire Metro Manila. For his work as Chairman, he was conferred the Doctor of Humanities, Honoris Causa, Ateneo de Cagayan, The Outstanding Filipino (TOFIL) Award for Government Service, the H.R Reyes Academic Medallion of Honor, Central Colleges of the Philippines and Doctor of the Public Administration, Honoris Causa by the Polytechnic University of the Philippines. He is notable for introducing U-Turn slots, greatly increasing the amount of pedestrian overpasses at road intersections (called footbridges), pioneering broadcasting of the MMDA, sidewalk clearing operations, and revitalizing the assets and fleets of the government agency. Although some of his policies and structures were met with resistance and complaints, many of these can be still seen today. Subsequent MMDA chairmen continued many of BF's contribution, particularly the construction of footbridges. Secretary of the Department of Public Works and Highways Fernando briefly served as Secretary of the Department of Public Works and Highways (DPWH) from January 15, 2003 until April 15, 2003. Presidential campaign On January 4, 2008, Fernando announced that he would be running for the presidency in the 2010 elections. Fernando hinted that he had gathered the funds and logistics required for a nationwide campaign and was intent on running for the presidency with or without the support of his party, Lakas- CMD. But on September 16, 2009, when Lakas-CMD chose Gilbert ‚ÄúGibo‚Äù C. Teodoro to represent their party for the presidency, Fernando reiterated \\"he is keeping his options open and may possibly run as an independent candidate or bolt out of the party.\\" After talks with Richard Gordon, he agreed to slide to Vice-President under Richard Gordon's party. But he lost to Makati City Mayor Jejomar Binay and finished fourth. After holding positions Nothing was heard from Bayani Fernando after the elections; however, he made an appearance again with then MMDA Chairman Francis Tolentino, in the issue of informal settlers and the perennial flooding crisis, defending Tolentino in the flood control issues. On July 25, 2012, a Telephone Interview with Bayani Fernando was made by Senator Richard Gordon in a TV5 Radio Program. Bayani is now busy with his construction and metal fabrication business at BF Corporation. Run for 1st district Cong. of Marikina City He ran again, this time for the position of Congressman of 1st district of Marikina City in the 2016 local elections, marking his political comeback in Marikina. He won the congressional race beating incumbent Councilor Samuel Ferriol and television host Jopet Sison. Fernando garnered 43,127 total votes. ABS-CBN franchise renewal controversy On July 10, 2020, Fernando is among the 70 representatives who voted \\"yes\\" to \\"kill\\" (reject) the franchise renewal of ABS-CBN, the largest Philippine television network. The hearing for the network's renewal unearthed several questionable issues, prompting Fernando's vote. He also suggested continuing investigations due to the issues found, and even probing the government agencies that were supposed to oversee compliance and operations of such networks.https://mb.com.ph/2020/07/29/solons-now-want- to-probe-agencies-that-were-remiss-in-supervising-abs-cbn-operations/ Business career=BF Corporation Later on, he established BF Corporation, an umbrella company that includes BF Construction Company and BF Metal Works. His company became involved in the construction of structures for the Mall of Asia Arena, SM City Marikina, SM City Sucat, Robinsons Galleria, Robinsons Ermita, Shangri-La Plaza, Edsa Shangri-La, Manila, and buildings in Makati's business district such as Rufino Tower and one of the Philippines' tallest, PBCom Tower. Long after leaving MMDA, his construction company won a Public‚Äìprivate partnership (PPP) bid that will build classrooms and school buildings for the Department of Education. His company was again involved in a government project, the Common Station for lines Line 1, Line 3, Line 7, and Line 9 (Metro Manila Subway), supplying steel foundations for the structure. The same company would also supply steel that would become the foundation for large span girders in the NLEX Segment 10.1 Harbor Link section. Personal life He is married to Ma. Lourdes Fernando, the former mayor of Marikina City. He had one daughter named Tala Fernando, married to John Paul L. Ang who is the eldest son of Ramon Ang.

Valencia, c.1430-1500. Burrell Collection. Manises dish, 1430-1450, Diameter: 14 in. (35.56 cm) Hispano- Moresque ware is a style of initially Islamic pottery created in Al Andalus or Muslim Spain, which continued to be produced under Christian rule in styles blending Islamic and European elements. It was the most elaborate and luxurious pottery being produced in Europe until the Italian maiolica industry developed sophisticated styles in the 15th century, and was exported over most of Europe. The industry's most successful period was the 14th and 15th centuries. Around 711, the Moors conquered Spain. Over the following centuries, they introduced two ceramic techniques to Europe: glazing with an opaque white tin-glaze, and lustreware, which imitates metallic finishes with iridescent effects. Hispano-Moresque wares use both processes, applying the paint as an overglaze which is then fired again.Caiger-Smith, 1985, chapters 12-14 gives very full accounts of the materials, techniques and science involved. Norman, pp. 2-3 is much briefer. Lustreware was a speciality of Islamic pottery, at least partly because the use of drinking and eating vessels in gold and silver, the ideal in ancient Rome and Persia as well as medieval Christian societies, is prohibited by the Hadiths,Hadithic texts against gold and silver vessels; also the Qur‚Äôan specifies that ‚Äúin this life, those who drink from silver and golden vessels will, however, feel the fire (q.v.) of hell (q.v.) in their stomachs (Muslim, ·π¢a·∏•ƒ´·∏•, vi, 135)‚Äù; however, the Qur‚Äôan states that golden platters in paradise contain \\"whatever the souls desire\\" (Q 43:71). Gold, Sch√∂nig, Hannelore, 2002, GALE EBOOKS with the result that pottery and glass were used for tableware by Muslim elites, when Christian medieval elites still normally used metal for both dishes and cups. At first centred on M√°laga in the south, and using typical Islamic decoration, by the 15th century the largest production was around Valencia, which had long been reconquered by the Crown of Aragon. Wares from Manises and other Valencian towns were mainly for the Christian market, and exported very widely. Centres of production One of a number of large vases made for the Alhambra in Granada, 134 cm high Andalusian The earliest major centre of fine pottery in Al-Andalus was M√°laga in southern Spain. This is the major centre whose best-known wares were produced in a Muslim kingdom, as opposed to by a workforce presumed to be largely Muslim, or Morisco, under Christian rule. It was already celebrated for its gold lustrewares in the 14th century, and remained under Muslim rule until 1487, shortly before the fall of Granada, the last Moorish kingdom. Murcia, Almer√≠a, and perhaps Granada itself were also early centres of production.Nasrid; the tiles in the Alhambra may have been made locally, for example - see Jones & Michell, p. 271, no. 424 This pottery stayed much closer to styles seen in other Islamic countries, although much of it was being exported to Christian markets, as can be seen by the coats of arms on many pieces. Wares from M√°laga were celebrated for their gold lustre on white enamel; they are distinguished from lustreware from Granada by the inclusion of blue paint with the gold lustre over a red clay that is characteristic of the region. At least one authority, Alan Caiger-Smith, excludes this pottery from the term \\"Hispano-Moresque\\", but most who use the term at all use it to include Malaga and other Andalusian wares from the Islamic period as well as the Valencian pottery.Caiger-Smith, 1985, has successive chapters called 6 \\"Moorish Lustre of Andalucia\\" and 7 \\"Hispano- Moresque Lustre\\", but most sources do not so distinguish, which given the difficulty of distinguishing the two reliably, and re-allocation of some types from one to the other, seems prudent. When Spanish medieval pottery was first studied in the 19th century, there was awareness of the Valencian centres but very little of the Al-Andalus ones, and there has been a steady re-attribution of types of pottery formerly attributed to Manises to Malaga and the south, which was still continuing in the 1980s, following archaeological discoveries in Malaga, and scientific analysis of the clays used.Caiger-Smith, 1985, pp. 95 & 100; Jones & Michell, p. 272, no. 426 Though other types of painted pottery, not usually called Hispano-Moresque ware, were produced in Al-Andaluz earlier, firm evidence of lustreware production is not found before the early or mid-13th century, when it may have been begun by Egyptian potters escaping political disturbances. Already it was being exported, as some of the earliest evidence is bowls set as decoration into the facades of churches in Pisa when they were built. An import from Malaga through Sandwich, Kent in England for the Spanish-born Queen Eleanor of Castile was recorded in 1289, consisting of \\"42 bowls, 10 dishes, and 4 earthenware jars of foreign colour (extranei coloris)\\".Caiger-Smith, 1985, pp. 84-86; quote from p. 86 Malagan ware was also exported to the Islamic world, and has been found at Fustat (medieval Cairo) and elsewhere.Jones & Michell, p. 271, no. 423 Detail of two gazelles from an Alhambra vase, c. 1400 The best known and most impressive examples of Andalucian wares are the Alhambra vases, a number of very large vases made to stand in niches in the Alhambra in Granada, and perhaps elsewhere. These are very atypical in Islamic pottery in having only a decorative function, with no practical purpose, and are \\"by far\\" the largest pieces of lustreware known. They are based on traditional shapes descended from the ancient amphora, but at about 115 to 170 cm tall are close to the height of a human. They are thought to come from a range of dates covering the late 14th and the 15th centuries, and the decoration and precise shape of the body is different in each surviving example. According to Alan Caiger-Smith, \\"few other pots in the world make such a strong physical impression\\".Caiger-Smith, 1985, pp. 89-93; quotes on p. 90 and p. 89 All are now in museums, five in Spain and others in St Petersburg, Berlin, Washington D.C., Stockholm and Palermo; various large fragments also survive.Caiger-Smith, 1985, pp. 90-92; Kenesson, 113 n.1 has a fuller account Lustre tiles are also still in place at the Alhambra.Jones & Michell, p. 271, no. 424 The \\"Fortuny Tablet\\", a unique plaque measuring 90 x 44 cm, has a garden-like design, inside a border with an inscription praising Yusuf III, Sultan of Granada (r. 1408-1417). Its design resembles that of some Spanish carpets.Caiger-Smith, 1985, pp. 96-99 After Yusuf's throne was inherited by an eight-year-old in 1418, the Nasrid kingdom went into a decline before its final conquest, and the production of fine pottery seems to cease abruptly about 1450, even though the name obra de Malequa (\\"Malaga work\\") continued to be used in Valencia for lustreware long afterwards.Caiger-Smith, 1985, p. 99 Valencia Jug with the Medici arms, 1450‚Äì1460 Early 16th century Valencian dish with the arms of the Kingdom of Sicily.

Valencia and its suburbs Manises and Paterna became important centres after potters migrated there from the south; the city had returned to Christian rule from 1238, and the immigration of skilled potters had been going on since at least the mid-14th century. In 1362 a cardinal commissioned floor-tiles in \\"obra de Malicha\\" (\\"Malaga work\\", probably meaning lustreware) for the Pope's Palais des Papes in Avignon from two masters in Manises, at least one with an Arabic name (though \\"Juan\\" as his forename). In 1484 a German traveller mentioned vessels \\"which are made by the Moorish potters\\".Caiger-Smith, 1985, pp. 100-101 It seems that the local lords of Manises, the family of Buyl, encouraged the immigration, and may have acted as distributors and agents for the product; certainly when Maria of Castile, Queen of Aragon, wanted to order a large service in 1454, she wrote to the Buyl lord for him to arrange it. Several Buyl's had served as ambassadors, to Granada as well as Christian courts, giving them contacts in many markets. They seem to have taken a 10% royalty on all sales of pottery, and enjoyed a very high income from these.Caiger-Smith, 1985, pp. 101-103 The largest deposit of Manises ware found by archaeology, apart from Manises itself, comes from Sluis in the Netherlands, then part of the territories of the wealthy Duchy of Burgundy.Caiger-Smith, 1985, p. 109 Manises also had clay and a cave nearby where a special sand used as a raw material for glazes was extracted.Norman, 2 Catalonia Barcelona in Catalonia in northeastern Spain, which was under Muslim rule from 718 to 801, became a centre for pottery much later, probably receiving immigrant Christian potters from Al- Andalus, especially Valencia, during the later Reconquista period. It was important at first for wares resembling the brown and green decorated pottery of Paterna and in the 16th century for lustreware in a \\"warm silvery-gold\\", either reflecting different materials available, or a deliberate change in style. Several other towns began to produce lustreware in the same period.Caiger-Smith, 1985, pp. 121-123 Style Much, in Valencia most, of the pottery was clearly made for a Christian market, as it includes coats of arms and other Western elements in the decoration. As well as the Christian IHS monogram in the centre, the naturalistic vine-leaf decoration of the dish shown at top is derived from Gothic art, probably via the border decoration of illuminated manuscripts.Jones & Michell, p. 272, no. 425 No pieces have yet been found that are signed (as many pieces from other Islamic regions are), and hardly any dated, so heraldry, especially when pieces are assumed to have been commissioned to celebrate a wedding, is important evidence for dating. The pieces \\"had to be spectacular and elegant, yet every category of vessel had a particular use\\" and on grand occasions all might be used, even though the largest platters spent most of the time on display propped up vertically on sideboards, as is shown in some contemporary paintings.Caiger-Smith, 1985, pp. 89, 105-109, 111, 113; p. 105 quoted. On signed pieces from other regions, see Jones & Mitchell, 206-207 and exhibits Andalucian designs use a repertoire of geometric motifs, many of which probably had a religious significance of which Christian buyers remained unaware. These are usually contained in painted compartments. Pseudo-Kufic script is used, as well as inscriptions in proper Arabic. The dominant colours of gold and blue perhaps represent the sun and sky; other colours available, such as brown, green and yellow, are much less used. From about 1400 some elements, including the depiction of animals, which were probably first used for export wares seem to have become popular among local Muslim buyers also; two of the later \\"Alhambra vases\\" described above have pairs of gazelles.Quantara , \\"Large jar decorated with gazelles\\", now Alhambra By then the Nasrid kings of Granada had given themselves heraldic arms in the Christian way, which are also seen on pottery.Caiger-Smith, 1985, pp. 86-99 Many large Valencian dishes with typical complicated designs centring on a coat of arms are also decorated on the underside with boldly- painted animal figures occupying the whole space, often also taken from heraldry.Norman illustrates both sides of numbers C1-C3; Caiger-Smith, 1985, p. 116 Of Manises ware, Alan Caiger-Smith has written, \\"the sustained production of fine pieces at Manises during the years 1380‚Äì1430 is without parallel in the history of ceramics. Many of these vessels will keep their place among the world's finest pottery for ever; regardless of changes and outlook.\\"Caiger-Smith, 1973, p.65 Hispano-Moresque shapes of the fifteenth century included the albarello (a tall jar), large serving dishes with coats of arms, made for wealthy people all over Europe, jugs (some on high feet, the citra and the grealet), a deep-sided dish (the lebrillo de alo) and the eared bowl (cuenco de oreja). Hispano-Moresque wares had a considerable influence on early Italian maiolica,Nasrid indeed two possible derivations of the name have connections with it. Towards the end of the century designs began to incorporate raised elements in imitation of European silverware shapes, such as gadrooning.Norman, 2 Tiles were made in all centres, and the small ceramic tombstone of an Andalucian student who died in 1409 is one of the very few precisely datable pieces.Jones & Michell, p. 272, no. 427; Caiger-Smith, 1985, p. 89 Albert Van de Put categorizes the decorative motifs into ten categories: large mock-Arabic character, small mock-Arabic character, spur-band and cross- hatching, flower and leaf on dotted ground, large vine-leaf and small flower (two sizes), foliage, bryony leaf and small flower, smaller rounded vine-leaf, and diapering of dots and stalks derived from preceding, and gadroons. Decline and revival Alan Caiger-Smith describes the Valencian industry as the victim of its own success; as the wares initially produced for the very top of society, usually as bespoke commissions with personalized heraldry, were demanded by the expanding lesser nobility and bourgeoisie, both the size of pieces and their quality of decoration declined, with painting becoming more routine repetitions of simple motifs.Caiger-Smith, 1985, p. 121 The Italian maiolica industry, largely developed in imitation of the Spanish, was developing in directions where Valencia could or would not follow. That the Italian figurative Renaissance painting was not attempted in Spain is perhaps not surprising, but Valencia only joined the Italians in copying simpler shapes from metalware, the Italians being more ambitious.Norman, 2 The Reconquista captured Valencia for the third and final time in 1238, and Malaga was one of the last cities to fall, after the Siege of M√°laga (1487). The remaining Islamic Mud√©jar and converted Morisco populations were expelled from Spain in 1496 and 1609 respectively, the latter Expulsion of the Moriscos involving a third of the population in the province of Valencia. But many of the craftsmen had long been Christians in any case, and the Hispano-Moresque style survived in the province of Valencia, although showing an immediate drop in quality.Caiger-Smith, 1985, p. 125 Later wares usually have a coarse reddish-buff body, dark blue decoration and luster; by now their position as the most prestigious European pottery had been lost to Italian and other producers. Wares continued to be produced in a slow decline, now relying on relatively local demand for tiles and other decorated items, including votive offerings. There were still said to be thirty working kilns at Manises around 1800, by which time the first efforts to revive the industry's former glory had already been made. The secrets of the techniques for making high-quality wares were largely lost, and after Carlos III of Spain took a personal interest a report was commissioned in 1785 to record the methods then being used, lest more was lost. By the 1870s a market had developed for pieces as close to the early work as could be managed, and a number of new firms were set up, some of which continue today, although little original work in the tradition is done.Caiger-Smith, 1985, p. 166-168 Other uses of the term The term \\"Hispano-Moresque\\" is also used to describe figured silk textiles with geometric patterns woven in Al-Andalus,Monnas, Lisa.

London and New Haven, Yale University Press, 2008, p. 63 and sometimes to refer to Mud√©jar or other work in other media, such as carpets, an industry which followed a similar pattern to pottery in Spain.

It is also known as \\"Amazonian dark earth\\" or \\"Indian black earth\\". In Portuguese its full name is terra preta do √≠ndio or terra preta de √≠ndio (\\"black soil of the Indian\\", \\"Indians' black earth\\"). Terra mulata (\\"mulatto earth\\") is lighter or brownish in color. Homemade terra preta, with charcoal pieces indicated using white arrows Terra preta owes its characteristic black color to its weathered charcoal content, and was made by adding a mixture of charcoal, bone, broken pottery, compost and manure to the low fertility Amazonian soil. A product of indigenous soil management and slash-and-char agriculture, the charcoal is stable and remains in the soil for thousands of years, binding and retaining minerals and nutrients. Terra preta is characterized by the presence of low-temperature charcoal residues in high concentrations; of high quantities of tiny pottery shards; of organic matter such as plant residues, animal feces, fish and animal bones, and other material; and of nutrients such as nitrogen, phosphorus, calcium, zinc and manganese. Fertile soils such as terra preta show high levels of microorganic activities and other specific characteristics within particular ecosystems. Terra preta zones are generally surrounded by terra comum ( or ), or \\"common soil\\"; these are infertile soils, mainly acrisols, but also ferralsols and arenosols. Deforested arable soils in the Amazon are productive for a short period of time before their nutrients are consumed or leached away by rain or flooding. This forces farmers to migrate to an unburned area and clear it (by fire).Watkins and Griffiths, J. (2000). Forest Destruction and Sustainable Agriculture in the Brazilian Amazon: a Literature Review (Doctoral dissertation, The University of Reading, 2000). Dissertation Abstracts International, 15‚Äì17 Terra preta is less prone to nutrient leaching because of its high concentration of charcoal, microbial life and organic matter. The combination accumulates nutrients, minerals and microorganisms and withstands leaching. Terra preta soils were created by farming communities between 450 BCE and 950 CE. in Soil depths can reach . It is reported to regenerate itself at the rate of per year.  History =Early theories The origins of the Amazonian dark earths were not immediately clear to later settlers. One idea was that they resulted from ashfall from volcanoes in the Andes, since they occur more frequently on the brows of higher terraces. Another theory considered its formation to be a result of sedimentation in tertiary lakes or in recent ponds. Anthropogenic roots Soils with elevated charcoal content and a common presence of pottery remains can accrete accidentally near living quarters as residues from food preparation, cooking fires, animal and fish bones, broken pottery, etc., accumulated. Many terra preta soil structures are now thought to have formed under kitchen middens, as well as being manufactured intentionally on larger scales. Farmed areas around living areas are referred to as terra mulata. Terra mulata soils are more fertile than surrounding soils but less fertile than terra preta, and were most likely intentionally improved using charcoal. This type of soil appeared between 450 BCE and 950 CE at sites throughout the Amazon Basin.  Amazonia  Amazonians formed complex, large-scale social formations, including chiefdoms (particularly in the inter-fluvial regions) and even large towns and cities. For instance, the culture on the island of Maraj√≥ may have developed social stratification and supported a population of 100,000. Amazonians may have used terra preta to make the land suitable for large-scale agriculture. Spanish explorer Francisco de Orellana was the first European to traverse the Amazon River in the 16th century. He reported densely populated regions extending hundreds of kilometres along the river, suggesting population levels exceeding even those of today. Orellana may have exaggerated the level of development, although that is disputed. The evidence to support his claim comes from the discovery of geoglyphs dating between 0‚Äì1250 CE and from terra preta. Beyond the geoglyphs, these populations left no lasting monuments, possibly because they built with wood, which would have rotted in the humid climate, as stone was unavailable. Whatever its extent, this civilization vanished after the demographic collapse of the 16th and 17th century, due to European-introduced diseases such as smallpox. The settled agrarians again became nomads, while still maintaining specific traditions of their settled forbears. Their semi-nomadic descendants have the distinction among tribal indigenous societies of a hereditary, yet landless, aristocracy, a historical anomaly for a society without a sedentary, agrarian culture. Moreover, many indigenous peoples adapted to a more mobile lifestyle to escape colonialism. This might have made the benefits of terra preta, such as its self-renewing capacity, less attractive: farmers would not have been able to cultivate the renewed soil as they migrated. Slash-and-char agriculture may have been an adaptation to these conditions. For 350 years after the European arrival, the Portuguese portion of the basin remained untended.  Location  Terra preta soils are found mainly in the Brazilian Amazon, where Sombroek et al. in estimate that they cover at least 0.1 to 0.3%, or of low forested Amazonia; but others estimate this surface at 10.0% or more (twice the area of Great Britain). extract quoted here . Recent model-based predictions suggest that the extent of terra preta soils may be of 3.2% of the forest. Terra preta exists in small plots averaging , but areas of almost have also been reported. They are found among various climatic, geological, and topographical situations. Their distributions either follow main water courses, from East Amazonia to the central basin, or are located on interfluvial sites (mainly of circular or lenticular shape) and of a smaller size averaging some , (see distribution map of terra preta sites in Amazon basin The spreads of tropical forest between the savannas could be mainly anthropogenic‚Äîa notion with dramatic implications worldwide for agriculture and conservation. Archaeological research in the Beni area, directly linked with the recent renewal of interest on terra preta, as well as photographs of experimental reconstructions of that mode of agriculture. Terra preta sites are also known in Ecuador, Peru and French Guiana, and on the African continent in Benin, Liberia, and the South African savannas.  Pedology  In the international soil classification system World Reference Base for Soil Resources (WRB) Terra preta is called Pretic Anthrosol. The most common original soil before transformed into a terra preta is the Ferralsol. Terra preta has a carbon content ranging from high to very high (more than 13‚Äì14% organic matter) in its A horizon, but without hydromorphic characteristics. Terra preta presents important variants. For instance, gardens close to dwellings received more nutrients than fields farther away. The variations in Amazonian dark earths prevent clearly determining whether all of them were intentionally created for soil improvement or whether the lightest variants are a by-product of habitation. Terra preta's capacity to increase its own volume‚Äîthus to sequester more carbon‚Äîwas first documented by pedologist William I. Woods of the University of Kansas. This remains the central mystery of terra preta. The processes responsible for the formation of terra preta soils are: * Incorporation of wood charcoal * Incorporation of organic matter and of nutrients * Growth of microorganisms and animals in the soil  Wood charcoal  The transformation of biomass into charcoal produces a series of charcoal derivatives known as pyrogenic or black carbon, the composition of which varies from lightly charred organic matter, to soot particles rich in graphite formed by recomposition of free radicals. Cited in . All types of carbonized materials are called charcoal. By convention, charcoal is considered to be any natural organic matter transformed thermally or by a dehydration reaction with an oxygen/carbon (O/C) ratio less than 60; smaller values have been suggested. Cited in . Because of possible interactions with minerals and organic matter from the soil, it is almost impossible to identify charcoal by determining only the proportion of O/C. The hydrogen/carbon percentage Cited in . or molecular markers such as benzenepolycarboxylic acid, Cited in are used as a second level of identification. Indigenous people added low temperature charcoal to poor soils. Up to 9% black carbon has been measured in some terra preta (against 0.5% in surrounding soils). Cited in Other measurements found carbon levels 70 times greater than in surrounding ferralsols, with approximate average values of 50 Mg/ha/m. Cited in The chemical structure of charcoal in terra preta soils is characterized by poly-condensed aromatic groups that provide prolonged biological and chemical stability against microbial degradation; it also provides, after partial oxidation, the highest nutrient retention. Low temperature charcoal (but not that from grasses or high cellulose materials) has an internal layer of biological petroleum condensates that the bacteria consume, and is similar to cellulose in its effects on microbial growth. Charring at high temperature consumes that layer and brings little increase in soil fertility. The formation of condensed aromatic structures depends on the method of manufacture of charcoal. in The slow oxidation of charcoal creates carboxylic groups; these increase the cations' exchange capacity of the soil. Cited in . The nucleus of black carbon particles produced by the biomass remains aromatic even after thousands of years and presents the spectral characteristics of fresh charcoal. Around that nucleus and on the surface of the black carbon particles are higher proportions of forms of carboxylic and phenolic carbons spatially and structurally distinct from the particle's nucleus. Analysis of the groups of molecules provides evidences both for the oxidation of the black carbon particle itself, as well as for the adsorption of non-black carbon. This charcoal is thus decisive for the sustainability of terra preta. Amending ferralsol with wood charcoal greatly increases productivity. Globally, agricultural lands have lost on average 50% of their carbon due to intensive cultivation and other damage of human origin. Fresh charcoal must be \\"charged\\" before it can function as a biotope. Several experiments demonstrate that uncharged charcoal can bring a provisional depletion of available nutrients when first put into the soil, that is until its pores fill with nutrients. This is overcome by soaking the charcoal for two to four weeks in any liquid nutrient (urine, plant tea, etc.). = Biochar = Biochar is charcoal produced at relatively low temperatures from a biomass of wood and leafy plant materials in an environment with very low or no oxygen. Amending soil with biochar has been observed to increase the activity of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi. Tests of high porosity materials such as zeolite, activated carbon and charcoal show that microbial growth substantially improves with charcoal. It may be that small pieces of charcoal migrate within the soil, providing a habitat for bacteria that decompose the biomass in the surface ground cover. cited in . This process may have an essential role in terra preta's self- propagation; a virtuous cycle develops as the fungus spreads from the charcoal, fixing additional carbon, stabilizing the soil with glomalin and increasing nutrient availability for nearby plants.. Many other agents contribute, from earthworms to humans as well as the charring process. Should biochar become widely used for soil improvement, a side-effect would produce globally significant amounts of carbon sequestration, helping mediate global warming. \\"Bio-char soil management systems can deliver tradable C emissions reduction, and C sequestered is easily accountable, and verifiable.\\"; Biochar is shown to increase soil cation exchange capacity, leading to improved plant nutrient uptake. Along with this it was particularly useful in acidic tropical soils as it is capable of raising pH due to its slightly alkaline nature. Biochar shows that, in relation to a soil, productivity of oxidised residue is particularly stable, abundant and capable of increasing soil fertility levels. The stability of biochar compared to other forms of charcoal is due to its formation. The process of burning organic material at high temperatures and low oxygen levels results in a porous char-rich and ash-poor product. Biochar has potential to be a nutrient-dense long-term contributor to soil fertility.  Organic matter and nutrients  Charcoal's porosity brings better retention of organic matter, of water and of dissolved nutrients, Cited in . as well as of pollutants such as pesticides and aromatic poly-cyclic hydrocarbons. Cited in . =Organic matter= Charcoal's high absorption potential of organic molecules (and of water) is due to its porous structure. Terra preta's high concentration of charcoal supports a high concentration of organic matter (on average three times more than in the surrounding poor soils), Cited in . up to 150 g/kg. Organic matter can be found at deep. Bechtold proposes to use terra preta for soils that show, at depth, a minimum proportion of organic matter over 2.0-2.5%. The accumulation of organic matter in moist tropical soils is a paradox, because of optimum conditions for organic matter degradation. It is remarkable that anthrosols regenerate in spite of these tropical conditions' prevalence and their fast mineralisation rates. The stability of organic matter is mainly because the biomass is only partially consumed. =Nutrients= Terra preta soils also show higher quantities of nutrients, and a better retention of these nutrients, than surrounding infertile soils. The proportion of P reaches 200‚Äì400 mg/kg.Lehmann, Johannes.som \\"Site Terra Preta de √çndio - Soil Biogeochemistry\\", Cornell University. The quantity of N is also higher in anthrosol, but that nutrient is immobilized because of the high proportion of C over N in the soil. Anthrosol's availability of P, Ca, Mn and Zn is higher than ferrasol. The absorption of P, K, Ca, Zn, and Cu by the plants increases when the quantity of available charcoal increases. The production of biomass for two crops (rice and Vigna unguiculata) increased by 38‚Äì45% without fertilization (P < 0.05), compared to crops on fertilized ferralsol. Amending with charcoal pieces approximately in diameter, instead of ground charcoal, did not change the results except for manganese (Mn), for which absorption considerably increased. Nutrient leaching is minimal in this anthrosol, despite their abundance, resulting in high fertility. When inorganic nutrients are applied to the soil, however, the nutrients' drainage in anthrosol exceeds that in fertilized ferralsol. As potential sources of nutrients, only C (via photosynthesis) and N (from biological fixation) can be produced in situ. All the other elements (P, K, Ca, Mg, etc.) must be present in the soil. In Amazonia, the provisioning of nutrients from the decomposition of naturally available organic matter fails as the heavy rainfalls wash away the released nutrients and the natural soils (ferralsols, acrisols, lixisols, arenosols, uxisols, etc.) lack the mineral matter to provide those nutrients. The clay matter that exists in those soils is capable of holding only a small fraction of the nutrients made available from decomposition. In the case of terra preta, the only possible nutrient sources are primary and secondary. The following components have been found: * Human and animal excrements (rich in P and N); * Kitchen refuse, such as animal bones and tortoise shells (rich in P and Ca); *Ash residue from incomplete combustion (rich in Ca, Mg, K, P and charcoal); * Biomass of terrestrial plants (e.g. compost); and * Biomass of aquatic plants (e.g. algae). Saturation in pH and in base is more important than in the surrounding soils. ; Smith, 1980; Kern and K√§mpf, 1989; ; ; ;  Microorganisms and animals  Bacteria and fungi (myco-organisms) live and die within the porous media of charcoal, thus increasing its carbon content. Significant biological black carbon production has been identified, especially under moist tropical conditions. It is possible that the fungus Aspergillus niger is mainly responsible. The peregrine earthworm Pontoscolex corethrurus (Oligochaeta: Glossoscolecidae) ingests charcoal and mixes it into a finely ground form with the mineral soil. P. corethrurus is widespread in Amazonia and notably in clearings after burning processes thanks to its tolerance of a low content of organic matter in the soil. This as an essential element in the generation of terra preta, associated with agronomic knowledge involving layering the charcoal in thin regular layers favorable to its burying by P. corethrurus. Some ants are repelled from fresh terra preta; their density is found to be low about 10 days after production compared to that in control soils.  Modern research on creating terra preta = Synthetic terra preta  A newly coined term is 'synthetic terra preta‚Äô.Chia, C., Munroe, P., Joseph, S. and Lin, Y. 2010. Microscopic characterisation of synthetic Terra Preta. Soil Research, 48 (7), pp. 593‚Äî605 STP is a fertilizer consisting of materials thought to replicate the original materials, including crushed clay, blood and bone meal, manure and biochar is of particulate nature and capable of moving down the soil profile and improving soil fertility and carbon in the current soil peds and aggregates over a viable time frame. Such a mixture provides multiple soil improvements reaching at least the quality of terra mulata. Blood, bone meal and chicken manure are useful for short term organic manure addition. Perhaps the most important and unique part of the improvement of soil fertility is carbon, thought to have been gradually incorporated 4 to 10 thousand years ago. Biochar is capable of decreasing soil acidity and if soaked in nutrient rich liquid can slowly release nutrients and provide habitat for microbes in soil due to its high porosity surface area. The goal is an economically viable process that could be included in modern agriculture. Average poor tropical soils are easily enrichable to terra preta nova by the addition of charcoal and condensed smoke. Terra preta may be an important avenue of future carbon sequestration while reversing the current worldwide decline in soil fertility and associated desertification. Whether this is possible on a larger scale has yet to be proven. Tree Lucerne (tagasaste or Cytisus proliferus) is one type of fertilizer tree used to make terra preta. Efforts to recreate these soils are underway by companies such as Embrapa and other organizations in Brazil. Synthetic terra preta is produced at the Sachamama Center for Biocultural Regeneration in High Amazon, Peru. This area has many terra preta soil zones, demonstrating that this anthrosol was created not only in the Amazon basin, but also at higher elevations. A synthetic terra preta process was developed by Alfons-Eduard Krieger to produce a high humus, nutrient-rich, water-adsorbing soil. Terra preta sanitation  Terra preta sanitation (TPS) systems have been studied as an alternative sanitation option by using the effects of lactic-aid conditions in urine-diverting dry toilets and a subsequent treatment by vermicomposting.

His books include Breaking Open the Head: A Psychedelic Journey into the Heart of Contemporary Shamanism (Broadway Books, 2002), 2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl (Tarcher/Penguin, 2006), and Notes from the Edge Times (Tarcher/Penguin, 2010). He is a co-founder of the web magazine Reality Sandwich and of the website Evolver.net, and edited the North Atlantic Books publishing imprint Evolver Editions. He was featured in the 2010 documentary 2012: Time for Change, directed by Joao Amorim and produced by Mangusta Films. He is the founder of the think tank Center for Planetary Culture, which produced the Regenerative Society Wiki. Family and background Pinchbeck‚Äôs father, Peter Pinchbeck, was an abstract painter, and his mother, writer and editor Joyce Johnson, was a member of the Beat Generation who dated Jack Kerouac as On the Road at the time was published in 1957 (chronicled in Johnson's book, Minor Characters ). Works and activities Pinchbeck was a founder of the 1990s literary magazine Open City with fellow writers Thomas Beller and Robert Bingham. He has written for many publications, including Esquire, The New York Times Magazine, The Village Voice, and Rolling Stone. In 1994 he was chosen by The New York Times Magazine as one of \\"Thirty Under Thirty\\" destined to change our culture through his work with Open City. He has been a regular columnist for a number of magazines, including Dazed & Confused. In Breaking Open the Head, Pinchbeck explored shamanism via ceremonies with tribal groups such as the Bwiti of Gabon, who eat iboga, and the Secoya people in the Ecuadorean Amazon, who take the psychedelic tryptamine brew ayahuasca in their ceremonies. He also attended the Burning Man festival in Nevada, and looked at use of psychedelic substances in a de-sacralized modern context. Philosophically influenced by the work of anthroposophist Rudolf Steiner, through his direct experience and research Pinchbeck developed the hypothesis that shamanic and mystical views of reality have validity, and that the modern world had forfeited an understanding of intuitive aspects of being in its pursuit of rational materialism. Drawing heavily, and somewhat controversially, from material shared on the Breaking Open the Head forums, Pinchbeck's second volume, 2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl, chronicles Mayan and Hopi prophecies, and follows Pinchbeck's travels and travails as he responds to leads, both physical and intellectual, he receives via this forum. Examining the nature of prophecy during this period, Pinchbeck investigates the New Age hypothesis of Terence McKenna that humanity is experiencing an accelerated process of global consciousness transformation, leading to a new understanding of time and space. The book details the psi or extra-sensory perception research of Dean Radin, the theories of Terence McKenna, the phenomena of crop circles, and a visit to calendar reform advocate Jos√© Arg√ºelles. Pinchbeck concludes with an account of receiving a transmission of prophetic material from the Mesoamerican deity Quetzalcoatl,. This claim was enough to get the book dropped by its planned publisher, delaying its release for the greater part of a year. While acknowledging that the validity of such an experience is unknown, Pinchbeck describes how a voice identifying itself as Quetzalcoatl began speaking to him during a 2004 trip to the Amazon. At the time, he was participating in the ceremonies of Santo Daime, a Brazilian religion that includes sacramental use of ayahuasca. Through its references to 2012 and the Maya calendar in the context of New Age beliefs, Pinchbeck's book has contributed to Mayanism. In May 2007, Pinchbeck launched Reality Sandwich. He is the executive producer of Postmodern Times, a series of web videos presented on the iClips Network, and co-founder of Evolver.net, an online social network. His life and work are featured in the documentary 2012: Time for Change, featuring interviews with Sting, David Lynch, Barbara Marx Hubbard, and others. In August 2013, Pinchbeck became the host of Mind Shift, a new talk show, filmed in New York City, produced by Gaiam TV. Pinchbeck's How Soon Is Now? (2017) explores the idea that the ecological crisis is a rite of passage or initiation for humanity collectively, forcing us to reach the next level of our consciousness as a species. The book outlines the changes to our technical infrastructure - agriculture, energy, industry - and our social, political, and economic system that Pinchbeck believes necessary to avoid the worst consequences of global warming and species extinction. On October 22, 2017, Pinchbeck published a lengthy essay on Facebook that responded to accusations that he is a sexual predator that emerged through the #metoo movement. Pinchbeck conceded to many of the things he was accused of and sought to explain them in terms of his childhood traumas. Appearances and interviews In a 1973 article about the Wacky Packs parodies of consumer packaging, seven-year-old Pinchbeck told a reporter for New York Magazine, \\"I think they're bringing out the truth about foods.\\" On 14 December 2006, Pinchbeck appeared on the television program The Colbert Report to discuss his book, 2012: The Return of Quetzalcoatl. Pinchbeck was featured in the 2006 video Entheogen: Awakening the Divine Within, a documentary about rediscovering an enchanted cosmos in the modern world. Pinchbeck was also featured in the 2008 video 2012: Science or Superstition, a documentary describing how much of what we are hearing is science and how much is superstition. He interviewed Alejandro Jodorowsky for the German/French art television network Arte in a very personal discussion, spending a night together in France, continuing the interview in different locations like in a park and in a hotel. Pinchbeck appears in the documentary film 2012: Time for Change, directed by Jo√£o G. Amorim, which was released in October 2010. He also appeared in the documentary film Electronic Awakening, directed by AC Johner, released in 2011. Pinchbeck appeared on The Joe Rogan Experience podcast, recorded on 8 September 2011.

A heavy machine gun or HMG is a class of full-powered rifle cartridge machine gun implying greater characteristics than general purpose medium machine guns. There are two generally recognized classes of weapons identified as heavy machine guns. The first are weapons from World War I identified as \\"heavy\\" due to the weight and encumbrance of the weapons themselves. The second are large- caliber (12.7x99mm, 12.7√ó108mm, 14.5√ó114mm, or larger) machine guns, pioneered by John Browning with the M2 machine gun, designed to provide increased range, penetration and destructive power against vehicles, buildings, aircraft and light fortifications beyond the standard rifle calibers used in medium or general-purpose machine guns, or the intermediate cartridges used in light machine guns.  Classification  The term was originally used to refer to the generation of machine guns which came into widespread use in World War I. These fired standard rifle cartridges such as the 7.92 Mauser, .303 British or 7.62√ó54mmR, but featured heavy construction, elaborate mountings, and water- cooling mechanisms that enabled long-range sustained automatic fire with excellent accuracy. However, these advantages came at the cost of being too cumbersome to move quickly, as well as requiring a crew of several soldiers to operate them. Thus, in this sense, the \\"heavy\\" aspect of the weapon referred to the weapon's bulk and ability to sustain fire, not the cartridge caliber. This class of weapons was best exemplified by the Maxim gun, invented by the American inventor Hiram Maxim, who had traveled to England to market his design and became a British subject in 1900. The Maxim was the most ubiquitous machine gun of World War I, variants of which were fielded simultaneously by three separate warring nations (Germany with the MG 08, Britain with the Vickers, and Russia with the PM M1910). DShK in heavy role The modern definition refers to a class of large-caliber (generally .50 or 12.7mm) machine guns, pioneered by John Moses Browning with the M2 machine gun. These weapons are designed to provide increased range, penetration and destructive power against vehicles, buildings, aircraft and light fortifications beyond the standard rifle calibers used in medium or general-purpose machine gun, or the intermediate cartridges used in light machine guns. In this sense, the \\"heavy\\" aspect of the weapon refers to its superior power and range over light- and medium-caliber weapons, in addition to its weight. This class of machine gun came into widespread use during World War II, when the M2 was used widely in fortifications, on vehicles and in aircraft by American forces. A similar HMG capacity was later fielded by the Soviets in the form of Vasily Degtyaryov's DShK in 12.7√ó108mm. The ubiquitous German MG42 general-purpose machine gun, though well-suited against infantry, lacked the M2's anti- fortification and anti-vehicle capability, a fact that was noted and lamented by the Germans. The continued need for a longer-range machine gun with anti- materiel capability to bridge the gap between exclusively anti-infantry weapons and exclusively anti-materiel weapons has led to the widespread adoption and modernization of the class, and most nations' armed forces are equipped with some type of HMG. Currently, machine guns with calibers smaller than 10mm are generally considered medium or light machine guns, while those larger than 15mm are generally classified as autocannons instead of heavy machine guns.  History  In the late 19th century, Gatling guns and other externally powered types such as the Nordenfelt were often made in a variety of calibers, such as 0.5-inch and 1-inch. Due to their multiple barrels, overheating was not so much of an issue, but they were also quite heavy. When Maxim developed his recoil-powered machine gun using a single barrel, his first main design weighed a modest 26 pounds (11.8 kg) and fired a .45-inch rifle-caliber bullet from a 24-inch barrel. A famous photo of Maxim showed him picking it up by its 15-pound tripod (6.8 kg) with one arm. It was similar to present-day medium machine guns, but it could not be fired for extended periods due to overheating. As a result, Maxim created a water jacket cooling system to enable it to fire for extended periods. However, this added significant weight, as did the change to more powerful rifle cartridges. There were thus two main types of heavy, rapid-fire weapons: the manually powered, multiple-barrel machine guns and the single-barrel Maxim guns. By the end of the 19th century, many new designs such as the M1895 Colt‚ÄìBrowning and Hotchkiss were developed, powered by gas operation or recoil operation. Also, rather than the heavy water jacket, new designs introduced other types of barrel cooling, such as barrel replacement, metal fins, heat sinks or some combination of these.  Designs  Wheeled mounted DShK heavy machine gun. MG 08 system (7.92 mm) and crew circa 1931. Machine guns diverged into heavier and lighter designs. The later model water-cooled Maxim guns and its derivatives the MG 08 and the Vickers, as well as the American M1917 Browning machine gun, were all substantial weapons. The .303 Vickers, for example, weighed 33 lb (15 kg) and was mounted on a tripod that brought the total weight to 50 lb (23 kg). The heavier designs could, and in some cases did, fire for days on end, mainly in fixed defensive positions to repel infantry attacks. These machine guns were typically mounted on tripods and were water- cooled, and a well-trained crew could fire nonstop for hours, given sufficient ammunition, replacement barrels and cooling water. Carefully positioned heavy machine guns could stop an attacking force before they reached their objectives. Light machine guns However, during the same period a number of lighter and more portable air-cooled designs were developed weighing less than 30 lbs (15 kg). In World War I they were to be as important as the heavier designs, and were used to support infantry on the attack, on aircraft, and on many types of vehicles. The lightest of the new designs were not capable of sustained automatic fire, as they did not have water jackets and were fed from comparatively small magazines. Essentially machine rifles with a bipod, weapons like the Lewis Gun, Chauchat and the Madsen were portable by one soldier, but were made for single and burst fire. Medium models The medium designs offered greater flexibility, either being fitted with a bipod in the light machine gun role or on a tripod or other weapon mount as medium machine guns. An example was the Hotchkiss M1909 machine gun weighing 27.6 lb (12.2 kg) fitted with a mini-tripod and using linkable 30-round ammunition strips, but there was also a belt-fed version. This type of multipurpose machine gun would be further developed, and later given names such as \\"universal machine gun\\", and later \\"general-purpose machine gun\\", and would eventually supplant the water-cooled designs. These later designs used quick- change barrel replacement to reduce overheating, which further reduced the weapon's weight, but at the cost of increasing the soldier's load due to the extra barrels. Some earlier designs like the Vickers had this feature, but it was mainly for barrel wear, as they normally used water cooling. It was in the 1920s and 1930s that quick barrel replacement for cooling purposes became more popular in weapons such as the ZB vz. 30, the Bren, the MG34 and the MG42. US .50 caliber heavy machine gun developments ‚Äì Browning M2, Browning M2E2 Quick Change Barrel, XM806 Lightweight .50 Caliber Machine Gun (LW50) World War II and later The heavier designs continued to be used throughout World War II and into the 1960s, but were gradually phased out in favor of air-cooled designs. The mediums were now used both as medium machine guns while mounted on tripods and as light machine guns while mounted on bipods. This was possible in part because a heavy, static MG position was not a very effective tactic in vehicle-centered warfare, and the significantly lighter air-cooled designs could nearly match the capabilities of the water-cooled versions. Gatling-type machine guns such as the Minigun and GShG-7.62 reappeared after World War II. These are typically mounted on ships and helicopters because of their weight and large ammunition requirements (due to their extremely high rate of fire.) The need for sustained automatic fire on the ground, however, is now nearly entirely filled by air-cooled medium machine guns.

And so much more!  Later years of the NAB  As a replacement for Krysia Kocjan the NAB had at first recruited Joanna Carlin but she never recorded with them. She was actually called Melanie Harrold but was trying to avoid confusion with the better known Melanie (Melanie Safka). She later made singles and solo albums (under both her names) and worked with the Albion Band and members of Steeleye Span. The NAB continued as a duo comprising Hoy and Thyne until 1975 when Hoy joined Magna Carta. Thyne also joined this band at a later stage.

She made a solo album Krysia in 1974 (RCA LPL1 5052) with musicians including some Fairport Convention/Fotheringay members (specifically Jerry Donahue, Dave Pegg, Dave Mattacks) - and also Rabbit Bundrick, and renowned percussionist Ray Cooper. On one track she revived her youthful talent for setting romantic English poetry to music with John Keats' La Belle Dame Sans Merci.Krysia LP sleeve, RCA 1974 Al Stewart's backing group, led by Peter White with Kocjan as a member, chose the name Shot In The Dark and released an album with the same title in 1981 (RSO 2394 297). On this Kocjan used her occasional alternative name of Krysia Kristianne and her few solo lead vocals here include \\"Some Towns\\". She later moved to the US and in 1995 sang the track \\"The Lament\\" on the CD A Celtic Tale - The Legend of Deirdre by Mychael and Jeff Danna, a performance which drew review phrases such as \\"crystalline soprano\\" and \\"most moving\\" on Amazon. In 1996 came the CD Tyger and Other Tales (Sentience Records 70002) with Leslie Chew and David Kronemyer which revived the Keats work along with ten other romantic English poems set to music. Her own favourite of these was \\"Complaint of the Absence of Her Lover Being Upon the Sea\\", as stated privately to a fan. She died on February 21, 2007, in Portland, Oregon where she had lived and worked as a singing teacher since 2000. A memorial service for Kocjan was held in Los Angeles on Saturday, March 10, 2007. Tom Hoy Tom Hoy was born in Glasgow in the quaintly named ‚ÄúRotten Row Maternity Hospital‚Äú. He started playing gigs at the age of 15, mainly rock and soul music, with a dusting of blues. It was around this time he also began to write songs and has been doing so successfully ever since. At the age of 19, he formed the well loved Natural Acoustic Band, taking them down to London, where 16 different record companies tried to sign them on the strength of their live work. They eventually settled with RCA, making two highly acclaimed albums with John Denver's producer, Milton Okun. They played gigs in Europe, Morocco and Tunisia, also appearing at every major U.K. venue from the Royal Albert Hall down. They often supported such acts as Don McLean, Ralph McTell and Country Joe and The Fish, appearing on the prestigious Old Grey Whistle Test on BBC TV with Alice Cooper. Tom joined Chris Simpson and Glen Stuart in Magna Carta in the early 70's, staying constant through changing line-ups and going on to record such well known and popular albums as ‚ÄòTook a Long Time‚Äô, ‚ÄòPrisoners on the Line‚Äô and ‚ÄòLive in Bergen‚Äô. They toured extensively worldwide, appearing on television and radio throughout Europe and Scandinavia and the U.K, achieving chart success in Holland with both the single and album of ‚ÄòTook a Long Time‚Äô (a song which he co-wrote with Chris). He often mentions that these were some of his happiest times, always thriving on the live performances. After leaving Magna Carta, for around 10 years Tom toured Holland, Germany, Scandinavia, the Middle East, Central America and even The Falkland Islands with his wife Geraldine. He then worked solo for several years and went on to take an extended break to help look after his autistic son Rory who is now an artist in his own right having had Five highly successful albums of his own released. Over the years Tom has teamed up with Chris from time to time to play some of the old songs together, including the 30th Anniversary show and more recently their highly acclaimed appearance together at the Royal Carr√© Theatre, Amsterdam where they rolled back the years for the band's 40th Anniversary celebrations.

It was invented by Vilayanur S. Ramachandran to treat post-amputation patients who suffered from phantom-limb pain (PLP). Ramachandran created a visual (and psychological) illusion of two intact limbs by putting the patient's affected limb into a \\"mirror box,\\" with a mirror down the center (facing toward a patient's intact limb). The patient then looks into the mirror on the side with the good limb and makes \\"mirror symmetric\\" movements, as a symphony conductor might, or as a person does when they clap their hands. The goal is for the patient to imagine regaining control over a missing limb. Because the subject is seeing the reflected image of the good limb moving, it appears as if the phantom limb is also moving. Through the use of this artificial visual feedback it becomes possible for the patient to \\"move\\" the phantom limb, and to unclench it from potentially painful positions. Mirror therapy has expanded beyond its origin in treating phantom limb pain to treatment of other kinds of one-sided pain or disability, for instance hemiparesis in post-stroke patients and limb pain in patients with chronic regional pain syndrome. Post- amputation phantom limb pain Ramachandran (right) with his original mirror boxA diagram of a mirror box. A patient inserts a whole hand into one hole and the \\"phantom\\" hand into the other. When viewed from an angle, an image of two complete hands is created in the brain. Based on the observation that phantom limb patients were much more likely to report paralyzed and painful phantoms if the actual limb had been paralyzed prior to amputation (for example, due to a brachial plexus avulsion), Ramachandran and Rogers-Ramachandran proposed the \\"learned paralysis\\" hypothesis of painful phantom limbs.Ramachandran, V.S., Blakeslee, S.: \\"Phantoms in the Brain: Probing the Mysteries of the Human Mind\\", 1998, William Morrow & Company, Their hypothesis was that every time the patient attempted to move the paralyzed limb, they received sensory feedback (through vision and proprioception) that the limb did not move. This feedback stamped itself into the brain circuitry through a process of Hebbian learning, so that, even when the limb was no longer present, the brain had learned that the limb (and subsequent phantom) was paralyzed. Ramachandran created the mirror box to relieve pain by helping an amputee imagine motor control over a missing limb. Mirror therapy is now also widely used for treatment of motor disorders such as hemiplegia or cerebral palsy. As Deconick et al. state in a 2014 review, the mechanism of improved motor control and pain relief may differ from the mechanism of pain relief. Deconick et al., who reviewed only the effects of MVF on sensorimotor control, found that MVF can exert a strong influence on the motor network, mainly through increased cognitive penetration in action control. Although there has been much research on MVT, authors of many review articles complain about the poor methodology often used, for example, small sample sizes or lack of control groups. For this reason, one 2016 review (based on a review of 8 studies) concluded that the level of evidence was insufficient to recommend MT as a first intention treatment for phantom limb pain. A 2018 review, (based on 15 studies conducted between 2012 and 2017, out of a pool of 115 publications) also criticized the quality of many reports on mirror therapy (MT), but concluded that \\"MT seems to be effective in relieving PLP, reducing the intensity and duration of daily pain episodes. It is a valid, simple, and inexpensive treatment for PLP.\\" A 2018 literature review of phantom limb pain stated that, in randomized controlled trials, mirror therapy reduced pain. Post-stroke hemiparesis Treatment with mirror therapy soon expanded beyond its origin in treating phantom limb pain to treatment of other kinds of one-sided pain and loss of motor control, for example in stroke patients suffering from hemiparesis. In 1999 Ramachandran and Eric Altschuler expanded the mirror technique from amputees to improving the muscle control of stroke patients with weakened limbs. A review article published in 2016 concluded that \\"Mirror therapy (MT) is a valuable method for enhancing motor recovery in poststroke hemiparesis.\\"Kamal Narayan Arya, Underlying neural mechanisms of mirror therapy: Implications for motor rehabilitation in stroke, Neurology India,2016, Volume64, Issue 1, Pages 38-44 According to a 2017 review of fifteen studies that compared mirror therapy to conventional rehabilitation for the recovery of upper-limb function in stroke survivors, mirror therapy was more successful than CR in promoting recovery. A 2018 review based on 1685 patients recovering from hemiplegic stroke found mirror therapy provided significant pain relief, while improving motor functions and activities of daily living (ADL). Thirteen out of seventeen randomized controlled trials found that MT was beneficial for post-stroke patients' legs and feet, according to a 2019 review paper. Despite considerable research, as of 2016 the underlying neural mechanisms of mirror therapy (MT) for stroke were still unclear.Rossiter, Borrelli, Borchert, Bradbury, Ward:\\"Cortical mechanisms of mirror therapy after stroke\\", Neurorehabil Neural Repair. 2015 Jun;29(5):444-52 As Deconick et al. state in a 2014 review, the mechanism of improved motor control may differ from the mechanism of pain relief. Complex regional pain syndrome Mirror therapy is also a recommended therapy for complex regional pain syndrome (CRPS). Virtual reality Since the 2000s, the visual illusion of regaining control of a damaged limb, which mirror therapy provides, has also been available through virtual reality or robotics.

Biography Kosma was born J√≥zsef Kozma in Budapest, where his parents taught stenography and typing. He had a brother, √Åkos. A maternal relative was the photographer L√°szl√≥ Moholy-Nagy, and another was the conductor Georg Solti. He started to play the piano at age five, and later took piano lessons. At the age of 11, he wrote his first opera, Christmas in the Trenches. After completing his education at the Gymnasium Franz-Josef, he attended the Academy of Music in Budapest, where he studied with Leo Weiner. He also studied with B√©la Bart√≥k at the Liszt Academy, receiving diplomas in composition and conducting. He won a grant to study in Berlin in 1928, where he met Lilli Apel, another musician, whom he later married. Kosma also met and studied with Hanns Eisler in Berlin. He became acquainted with Bertolt Brecht and Helene Weigel. Kosma and his wife emigrated to Paris in 1933. Eventually, he met Jacques Pr√©vert, who introduced him to Jean Renoir. During the 1930s Kosma teamed up with Pr√©vert to set a number of Pr√©vert's poems to music, and have them recorded by popular singers. Several of these were hits. Kosma also composed scores to Renoir's films including La Grande Illusion (1937), La B√™te Humaine (The Human Beast, 1938), and La R√®gle du jeu (The Rules of the Game, 1939). During World War II and the Occupation of France, Kosma was placed under house arrest in the Alpes-Maritimes region and was banned from composition. However, Pr√©vert managed to arrange for Kosma to contribute music for films with other composers fronting for him. Under this arrangement, he wrote the \\"pantomime\\" of the music for Les Enfants du Paradis (1945), made under the occupation but released after the liberation. Among his other credits are the scores to Voyage Surprise (1946) and Le Testament du docteur Cordelier (The Doctor's Horrible Experiment, 1959), the last of which was made for television. He was also known for writing the standard classical-jazz piece \\"Les feuilles mortes\\" (\\"Autumn Leaves\\"), with French lyrics by Pr√©vert and later English lyrics by Johnny Mercer, which was derived from music in Marcel Carn√©'s film Les Portes de la Nuit (1946).

Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Volos, of which it is a municipal unit.Kallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior It is situated southwest of Volos and north of Almyros, on the coast of the Pagasetic Gulf. It is located on the national highway Athens-Lamia- Volos. The area of the municipal unit is and its population 6,819 people (2011). View of Anchialos from the Pagasetic Gulf History=Antiquity The modern town is built on the ruins of the ancient city of Pyrasos (Œ†œçœÅŒ±œÉŒøœÇ), and is associated with the nearby city of Thessalian or Phthiotic Thebes, near the modern village of Mikrothivai. Homer mentions Pyrasos in his list of ships (Iliad B.695) together with Phylace and Itona, which belonged to the kingdom of Protesilaus. According to Strabo (IX.435), who discusses its topography, \\"well-harboured Pyrasos\\" (Œµ·ΩëŒªŒØŒºŒµŒΩŒøœÇ Œ†œçœÅŒ±œÉŒøœÇ) was 20 stadia from Phthiotic Thebes. Pyrasos is scarcely known from historical sources, except that it was an active harbour and featured a famous temple of Demeter and Kore, after which the harbour was later known as Demetrion. The only excavation which took place on the hill of Magoula, the old acropolis, southeast of Nea Anchialos, proves that the site was peopled since the earliest Neolithic period (6th millennium BC) by fishermen and agriculturalists. Archaeologically, the remains of Pyrasos are scant, and the city is barely known in historical times. An arm from an oversized statue, which came into light in 1965, was attributed to Demeter. Possibly the most identical finding is a small fragment of an ancient epigraph, discovered in the debris of the big Basilica D with the name Pyrasos, confirming the location of the city. In the late 4th century BC, Pyrasos was joined (synoecism) with the neighbouring cities of Phylake and Phthiotic Thebes. The new conurbation took the name of Phthiotic or Thessalian Thebes. The city remained prosperous under Roman rule, but it was moved from the inland site of the old Phthiotic Thebes back to Pyrasos near the sea. The city's prosperity from the 4th through the 6th centuries is attested by the number of its Early Christian monuments, but was brought to an end in a great fire in the late 7th century that destroyed the city. The city was rebuilt and apparently continued to be of some note in the early Byzantine period‚Äîits bishop is last mentioned in the 8th/9th century‚Äîbut never recovered and was eventually eclipsed by the nearby port city of Halmyros. Nea Anchialos Nea Anchialos was founded in 1906 by Greeks who fled the Black Sea town of Anchialos (modern Pomorie in Bulgaria) after massive anti-Greek riots, provoked by the Greek-Bulgarian struggle in Macedonia.

Its inhabitants are called Saintaises and Saintais. Saintes is the second- largest city in Charente-Maritime, with inhabitants in 2008. The city's immediate surroundings form the second-most populous metropolitan area in the department, with inhabitants. While a majority of the surrounding landscape consists of fertile, productive fields, a significant minority of the region remains forested, its natural state. In Roman times, Saintes was known as Mediolanum Santonum. During much of its history, the name of the city was spelled Xaintes or Xainctes. Primarily built on the left bank of the Charente River, Saintes became the first Roman capital of Aquitaine. Later it was designated as the capital of the province of Saintonge under the Ancien R√©gime. Following the French Revolution, it briefly became the prefecture of the department (then called Charente-Inf√©rieure) during the territorial reorganization of 1790, until La Rochelle was designated and superseded it in 1810. Charente-Maritime, encyclop√©die Bonneton, p. 64 Although it only had the status of a subprefecture,The prefecture of Charente-Maritime is La Rochelle and the subprefectures are alphabetically: Jonzac, Rochefort, Saint- Jean-d'Ang√©ly and Saintes. Saintes was allowed to remain the judicial center of the department. In the late 19th century, Saintes was chosen as the seat of the VIIIth arrondissement of the Chemins de Fer de l'√âtat, railways, which enabled an era of economic and demographic growth. Today, Saintes remains the economic heart of the center of the department, and it is an important transportation hub. A few major industrial businesses operate (in electronics, rail repair, construction of hoists). The city's commerce and service sector is large, featuring the headquarters of Coop Atlantique, and administrative functions of state, courts, and legal services; banks, schools, and a hospital. Beyond this, property maintenance, retail, and tourism sectors provide large numbers of jobs. Because of its noteworthy Gallo-Roman, medieval and classical heritage, Saintes is a tourist destination. It has been a member of the French Towns and Lands of Art and History since 1990. It has several museums, a theater, cinemas, and organizes numerous festivals. A European center of musical research and practice is in its Abbaye aux Dames.

The city is based 60 km southeast of La Rochelle, 33 kilometers northeast of Royan, and about 100 km north of Bordeaux (to which it is linked by the A10 autoroute).  Geology  A chronostratigraphic stage of sedimentary rock (in stratigraphy) has been named after the former name for inhabitants, the Santones, the Santonian (approximately 84 Ma ago, after the Coniacian Age and before the Campanian Age in the Cretaceous Period). Saintes is built on its eponymous subset of mainly limestone that consists of particular flint nodules of quartz geodes and nodules of iron. Ancient stone quarries in its 'Colline de la Capitole' (Capitol Hill) and Bellevue, partially filled or converted to permit fungiculture, are evidence for Santonian stone's use in the construction of various buildings, where unimproved quite vulnerable to frost.Saintes, plus de ans d'histoire illustr√©e, Soci√©t√© d'arch√©ologie et d'histoire de la Charente- Maritime, p.11-14 Nearer to the river, the Cretaceous plateau gives way to more or less recent alluvial grasslands composed of bri, a type of clay.

City Hall on the left bank, district Saint-Pierre. The neighborhood of Saint-Pierre lies between the hill of the Capitole and the river Charente. It possesses a significant number of historic monuments justifying its forming of the core of a conservation area that spans over . Built around the cathedral Saint-Pierre, the place du march√© and the place du Synode, it is crossed by pedestrian alleys around which can be found numerous medieval, renaissance and classic buildings. Almost immediately west lies the neighbourhood of Saint-Eutrope, that has developed over the centuries around a rocky elevation bounded by two small valleys at right angles to the river. Dominated by the Saint-Eutrope basilica, it also contains the remains of a Clunian priory and several hillside houses. Little valleys lead to the vallon des Ar√®nes (meaning arenas vale) below, where a Roman amphiteatre survives, in a park named \\"Parc des Ar√®nes\\". The cours Reverseaux and cours des Ap√¥tres de la libert√© separate Saint-Eutrope (and its hill) in the west from the faubourg Berthonni√®re. These partly separate the hill of the Capitole to the north. Once outside-of-the-walls, the faubourg included some hostelries and inns for pilgrims. The streets of the faubourg converge toward the place Saint-Louis, the place de l'Aubarr√©e and the place Blair, dominated by a column of Liberty (in France popularised as fictional Marianne at the time) erected during the Revolution. Le patrimoine des communes de la Charente- Maritime, √©ditions Flohic, p. 1023 The square Gouleben√©ze stands between the place Blair and the river. The neighbourhoods of les Boiffiers and Bellevue are separated from the rest of the city by the avenue de Saintonge; they consist mainly in low-rent housing (HLM) and suburban housing standing on a plateau bounded by the Charente. Bellevue has inhabitants and spans ; it is listed as a zone urbaine sensible (ZUS). La Recouvrance, in a triangle formed by the cours du mar√©chal Leclerc, the cours Genet and the rocade ouest (bypass), contains a lyc√©e, the former seminary, the Yvon Chevalier stadium and a shopping mall. The water tower of Recouvrance is decorated with frescoes by contemporary artist Michel Genty. The north of the urban area, the Saint- Vivien neighborhood has an old faubourg (exurb) inhabited since antiquity where the thermes de Saint-Saloine, ancient Roman baths are found. = Right bank (Rive droite) = Abbaye aux Dames on the right bank The neighborhood of Saint-Pallais was probably urbanized in antiquity. Structured around the main access way of the Roman city, it was then linked to the town center by a bridge with a monumental entrance, the Arch of Germanicus. During the Middle Ages, a funeral basilica, dedicated to the bishop Palladius, was established (and later replaced by the √©glise Saint-Pallais, which gives its name to the neighborhood), then a Benedictine abbey of women amongst the largest in the region, the Abbaye aux Dames de Saintes. The presence of this monumental heritage led to the integration of part of the neighborhood in a conservation area. It was during the 19th century that the neighborhood began to develop. The antique bridge was destroyed and replaced in 1879 by the pont Bernard- Palissy, a few meters upstream ; the avenue Gambetta and the place Bassompierre are created ; the train station, the Gare de Saintes, the prison, the Haras national de Saintes, the parc Pierre-Mend√®s France, the Jardin public Fernand Chapsal and the protected area of the prairie de la Palu were subsequently created.  Adjacent communes  Saintes and its neighboring communes (in orange : Communaut√© de communes du Pays santon).  Transportation  Roads  The autoroute A10 leaving Saintes towards Bordeaux Saintes is a transportation hub of some importance, connected by two motorways and several secondary roads, national and departmental, that converge towards the rocade (partly a 2x2) that bypasses the city on its western and southern sides. The A10 autoroute (France), operated locally by Autoroutes du Sud de la France, passes through the commune in its western part, in a north-south axis. It can be accessed by the interchange 35. By the A10, Saintes is 125 km from Bordeaux, 140 km from Poitiers, 470 km from Paris. The A837 autoroute is a spur road of the A10 linking the area to Rochefort, the third city in the department. The Saint-Eutrope basilica from the Avenue de Saintonge Saintes is on the Route Centre-Europe Atlantique, an expressway that links it to Limoges and Lyon in the east ‚Äì its dualled western section Saintes-Saujon opened to traffic in 2008 making the two 25 minutes apart by car. An extension towards Royan on the coast completed in the following decade. The rocade is formed in its western part by the national road 137, that meets two key roads, the departmental road 728 (that links Saintes to the Island of Oleron by Marennes) and the departmental road 150 that intersects near the locality of Diconche. In its southern part, the rocade integrates the national road 141, that runs east towards Cognac, Angoul√™me and Limoges. The departmental road 150, at the end of the east part, runs towards Niort by Saint-Hilaire-de-Villefranche et Saint-Jean-d'Ang√©ly. The town center of Saintes is bypassed by the avenue de Saintonge or departmental road 24, that crosses the Charente with the bridge de Saintonge, opened in 1969.  Train  The Gare de Saintes (train station) is at the focal point of five railways that link the agglomeration to Nantes (by La Rochelle), Bordeaux, Angoul√™me, Niort and Royan ; the trains are mainly part of the regional rail network TER Nouvelle-Aquitaine and the network Intercit√©s. In 1894, the station was the starting point of a 3 km long network of tramways that was stopped in 1934. In 1894 was also founded a secondary railway 42 km long linking Saintes to Mortagne-sur-Gironde, by G√©mozac, then a somewhat important economic center ; however, this railway was dismantled in 1947. The importance of this railway network is explained by the designation of Saintes as the seat of the Compagnie des chemins de fer des Charentes in 1867, then as the regional seat of the VIIIth arrondissement of the Chemins de fer de l'√âtat from 1911 to 1971. The SNCF is still a major employer in the city, and new depots and workshops have been opened in 2009 and 2010.

It is the county seat. The city is located east of Rimouski near the south shore of the Saint Lawrence River. History In 1867, the main condition for New Brunswick and Nova-Scotia entering into the Canadian Confederation was, to be linked to the rest of the country by the railway. In 1868, work began on the Intercolonial Railway and the authorities decided to have the railway turn at Saint-Octave-de-M√©tis in Gasp√©sie. However, this village, because of its rugged landscape, was not suitable to receive the train station and maintenance shops. The engineers turned to the higher 2nd farming rank of Sainte-Flavie, and the train station was named Sainte-Flavie-Station. In 1880, Sainte-Flavie-Station became separate and was named Mont-Joli, the name which the first settlers had used to describe the area. On 13 June 2001, the neighbouring municipality of Saint- Jean-Baptiste (not to be confused with a different Saint-Jean-Baptiste in the Mont√©r√©gie region) merged with Mont- Joli.http://www.toponymie.gouv.qc.ca/ct/ToposWeb/fiche.aspx?no_seq=56863 Demographics According to the Canada 2011 Census: *Population: 6 281 *% Change (2011‚Äì2016): -5.8 *Dwellings: 3,138 *Area (km¬≤): 24.455 km¬≤ *Density (persons per km¬≤): 272.6 Transportation Via-Rail Station Mont-Joli is the easternmost end of Autoroute 20, whose segment connects with the city of Rimouski.

Iowa has 1,599 townships. Townships in the U.S. state of Iowa are distinct geographical areas. For civil administrative purposes, Iowa state law allows each county board of supervisors to divide the county into townships. An elected or appointed board of trustees governs each township. The trustees are often elected, but may be appointed by the county board of supervisors if authorized by voters after a referendum. Township trustees also serve as fence viewers and may resolve conflicts upon request. Iowa townships may provide fire protection, emergency medical services, cemeteries, community centers, playgrounds, and, upon voter approval, public halls. Although Iowa townships may levy taxes, the county board of supervisors issues anticipatory bonds on behalf of the township and the compensation of township trustees (other than fees) is paid by the county government. For this reason, townships in Iowa are classified as administrative subdivisions of the counties and are not counted as separate governments in the United States Census of Governments.

An influential leader, he became involved in internal struggles of power within neighboring Grand Duchy of Lithuania. He also held the town of Kholm (modern Che≈Çm, Poland) in his domain.  Name  Little is known of Shvarn and even his name is not entirely certain. The original documents relating to this ruler are scarce and mention him under a variety of names. For instance the first edition of Lithuanian Annals mentions him as Shkvarno, but the following editions use the names of Skirmont and Skirmunt, possibly a Ruthenisation of Lithuanian name Skirmantas. Contemporary sources also mention his Christian name of Ioann (–Ü–æ–∞–Ω–Ω), that is either John or George. In modern times the ruler is known by a variety of names in various historiographies, including Lithuanian ≈†varnas, Ukrainian –®–≤–∞—Ä–Ω–æ –î–∞–Ω–∏–ª–æ–≤–∏—á, Russian and Belarusian –®–≤–∞—Ä–Ω, and Polish Szwarno Dani≈Çowicz. All of them are versions of the name of Shvarn, which is likely to be a diminutive of the Slavic name of Svaromir.  Biography  One of the sons of king Daniel I of Galicia of the house of Romanovich, Shvarn inherited the north-western parts of the Kingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia, his fathers' domain. This land included the town of Halicz itself, as well as the land across the Bug River, that is Red Ruthenia with the towns of Be≈Çz, Czerwie≈Ñ, Mielnik, Drohiczyn and eventually also Kholm (since 1264). His brother Lev I inherited the southern part of the land, with the cities of Lviv and Przemy≈õl, while Roman became the heir of duchies of Lutsk and Terebovl. During the times of king Daniel's reign, the Galician lords were allied with their Polish neighbours against a common threat, the Lithuanian tribes that often raided the neighbouring lands for loot and plunder. However, in 1255 (or the previous year) Shvarn married an unnamed daughter of Mindaugas, since 1253 the first (and only) king of Lithuania. This allied him to Lithuania and together the two rulers undertook numerous military campaigns against the Kingdom of Poland. Already in 1255 they raided Lublin, in 1262 a major campaign against Masovia was started. Shvarn and Treniota captured the city of P≈Çock and besieged Shvarn's brother-in-law, Siemowit I of Masovia in Jazd√≥w (modern Warsaw). In the end Siemowit was killed by Shvarn's troops and his son Konrad II was taken prisoner. The Polish relief force did not arrive in time and was later defeated in a battle at D≈Çugosiod≈Ço on August 5, 1262. In 1264 king Daniel of Galicia died and Shvarn received nominal overlordship over all of Kingdom of Galicia‚ÄìVolhynia as its duke. Immediately he mounted a major campaign against Poland, this time aiming for Lesser Poland. However, although joint armies managed to plunder Skaryszew, Tarczek and Wi≈õlica, this time the campaign was less successful and the allied Ruthenian and Lithuanian armies were repelled. The Yotvingian auxiliaries were defeated by Boles≈Çaw V the Chaste at the Battle of Bra≈Ñsk. The following year Boles≈Çaw mounted a counter-offensive against Shvarn and his uncle Vasilko Romanovich, and defeated the earlier on June 19, 1266 at Wrota. This weakened Shvarn's position in his own domain. In the meantime in 1263 Mindaugas of Lithuania was murdered. In the chaos that followed Mindaugas' assassination, the lands of the Grand Duchy were in disarray, with both local and foreign rulers struggling for power. Shvarn gave his support to Vai≈°vilkas, one of Mindaugas' sons and his brother-in-law. Together they managed to depose Treniota and expel Dovmont all the way to Pskov. After Vai≈°vilkas returned to monastic life in 1267, Shvarn became the new Grand Duke. No details are known about Shvarn's rule over Lithuania and he probably did not gain a strong foothold in that country. However, he was apparently fairly successful in expanding his borders. Following successful military campaigns, in 1267 he defeated his brother Mstislav in the battle of the Yaselda River and captured Turov and Pinsk. He then campaigned against the Volga Tatars and defeated khan Balaklay in the battle of Kojdanow (modern Dzyarzhynsk, Belarus), which allowed Shvarn to capture the towns of Mozyr, Chernigov, Karachev and Starodub. The struggle for power within Lithuania however continued. Before a clear winner could emerge, Shvarm died in Kholm (nowadays Che≈Çm, Poland) some time between 1269 and 1271. He was buried in an Orthodox Cathedral that once stood on a place now occupied by the Basilica of the Birth of the Virgin Mary. After his death most of his lands reverted to Lithuania and came under the control of Traidenis, a noble from Auk≈°taitija.

A fidalgo is comparable in some ways to the French gentilhomme (the word also implies nobility by birth or by charge) and to the Italian nobile. The title was abolished after the overthrow of the Monarchy in 1910. It is also a family surname. Origins and etymology The word has the same etymological and historical roots as its Spanish cognate, hidalgo. Although algo generally means \\"something\\", in this expression the word specifically denotes \\"riches\\" or \\"wealth\\" and thus was originally synonymous with rico homem (literally, \\"a rich man\\").Corominas, Joan and Jos√© A Pascual (1981). \\"Hijo\\" in Diccionario cr√≠tico etimol√≥gico castellano e hisp√°nico, Vol. G-Ma (3). Madrid: Editorial Gredos, 359-360. As late as the reign of Afonso III (1248‚Äì1279), who completed the reconquest of the Algarve, the nobility was not differentiated as it would be later. All nobles, who were the large landowners, were referred to simply by two synonyms, fidalgo and ricos homens. Originally, rico homem referred to the administrative duties entrusted to a noble and fidalgo referred to the inherited status of nobility (in an older parlance, \\"the nobility of blood\\"). Below the ricos homens was a descending category of their vassals: the infan√ß√µes, the knights (cavaleiros), and the squires (escudeiros). Rico homem and fidalgo reached their current meanings during the reign of John I (1385‚Äì1433). Large segments of the nobility did not side with John I in the crisis of 1383‚Äì1385 and the subsequent war with Castile; they lost their lands after the new king secured his claim to the throne and were replaced by a new nobility, elevated from previously non-noble families and modeled on the English system. Fidalgo came to be applied to a category analogous to the English \\"gentleman.\\" By the start of the fifteenth century, the term infan√ß√£o fell out of use and \\"knight\\" came to mean all those below the ricos homens. Fidalgo began to be emphasized because, in its sense of someone who had inherited nobility, it differentiated the older knights from the growing bourgeoisie that continued to gain access to knighthood through accomplishments in the service of the state.

Jeremias Drexel S.J. (also known as Hieremias Drexelius or Drechsel) (August 15, 1581 - 19 April 1638) was a Jesuit writer of devotional literature and a professor of the humanities and rhetoric. He served for 23 years as court preacher in Munich to Maximilian I, Elector of Bavaria and his wife Elizabeth of Lorraine. Life Jeremias Drexel was born in Augsburg and was raised as Lutheran. However, he was converted to Catholicism in his youth and educated by the Jesuits before entering the Jesuit Order. He taught the Jesuit seminarians at Dillingen as professor of rhetoric, and then for 23 years he was a court preacher to Maximilian I, the prince-elector of Bavaria in the Holy Roman Empire. It is said that his voice was strong enough to be heard in every corner of the church and that his sermons were such that an hour would seem like a few minutes. During this period he accompanied Maximilian on his Bohemian campaign. He died in Munich. Works Drexel gave up preaching in 1621 and devoted himself to writing a biography of the Duchess and composing theological works redolent of his baroque preaching fervour. Drexel was fond of pictorial symbols to make his teachings concrete and thus most of his books are elegantly illustrated. Jeremias is the author of some 20 works that were widely read and translated. His writings on the eternal truth, the virtues and the Christian exemplar were popular; hundreds of thousands of copies of his works were printed. By 1642 in Munich alone, 170,700 copies of his works had appeared. His first work, De aeternitate considerationes, concerned various representations of eternity. Another of his works, Heliotropium, discussed man's recognition of the divine will and conformity to it.  Bibliography  * 1620 De √¶ternitate considerationes (Considerations on Eternity).

ÊòéÊ≤ªÂ∑•Ëä∏ÂÖ•ÈñÄ p.24. Me no Me, 2017 Maki-e objects were initially designed as household items for court nobles; they soon gained more popularity and were adopted by royal families and military leaders as a symbol of power. To create different colours and textures, maki-e artists use a variety of metal powders including gold, silver, copper, brass, lead, aluminum, platinum, and pewter, as well as their alloys. Bamboo tubes and soft brushes of various sizes are used for laying powders and drawing fine lines. As it requires highly skilled craftsmanship to produce a maki-e painting, young artists usually go through many years of training to develop the skills and to ultimately become maki-e masters. K≈çami D≈çch≈ç (1410‚Äì1478) was the first lacquer master linked to specific works. His maki-e works used designs from various Japanese contemporary painters. K≈çami and another maki-e master, Igarashi Shinsai, were originators of the two major schools of lacquer-making in the history of Japan. Takamakie (or \\"raised maki-e\\") is one of the three major techniques in maki-e making. Developed in the Muromachi period (1336‚Äì1573), the technique of takamakie involves building up design patterns above the surface through a mixture of metal powder, lacquer, and charcoal or clay dust. Another special kind of maki-e is togidashi maki-e, where a black lacquer without oil is put on the metal decoration as an additional coat.

An eruv (; , , also transliterated as eiruv or erub, plural: eruvin ) is a ritual halakhic enclosure made for the purpose of allowing activities which are normally prohibited on Shabbat (due to the prohibition of hotzaah mereshut lereshut), specifically: carrying objects from a private domain to a semi-public domain (carmelit), and transporting objects four cubits or more within a semi-public domain. The enclosure is made within some Jewish communities, especially Orthodox Jewish communities. An eruv accomplishes this by symbolically integrating a number of private properties and spaces such as streets and sidewalks into one larger \\"private domain\\" by surrounding it with mechitzas, thereby avoiding restrictions of transferring between domains. Often a group constructing an eruv obtains a lease to the required land from a local government. An eruv allows Jews to carry, among other things, house keys, tissues, medication, or babies with them, and to use strollers and canes. The presence or absence of an eruv thus especially affects the lives of strictly observant Jews with limited mobility and those responsible for taking care of babies and young children. Definition=The prohibition of transferring between domains In Jewish tradition it is commonly said that \\"carrying\\" is forbidden on Shabbat. Specifically, \\"transferring between domains\\" () is considered one of the 39 categories of activity prohibited on Shabbat. The halacha of Shabbat divides spaces into four categories: * Private domain (reshut hayachid), such as a house * Public domain (reshut harabim), such as a very busy road * Semi-public domain (carmelit), which includes most other places * Neutral domain (makom patur), such as the flat space on top of a pole A domain is defined as public or private based on its degree of enclosure, not its ownership. The rules here are complex, and expertise is needed to apply them. On Shabbat, it is forbidden to transfer an object from one domain to another, including from one person's house to another adjacent house. The only exception is transferring to or from a neutral domain (which is rarely relevant). In addition, it is also forbidden to transfer an object for a distance of 4 cubits (approximately 2 metres; 7 feet) within a public domain or carmelit. While biblical law prohibits carrying objects between private and fully public domains on Shabbat, rabbinic law extends this restriction to carrying between a private domain and a semi-public carmelit as a safeguard of the biblical law. The rabbinic prohibition of carrying between a private domain and a carmelit is relaxed whenever an eruv is in place. Eruv chatzerot The term eruv is a shortening of eruv chatzerot, literally a \\"merger of [different] domains\\" (into a single domain). This makes carrying within the area enclosed by the eruv no different from carrying within a single private domain (such as a house owned by a single person), which is permitted. A fence being used as an eruv boundary in Israel The eruv typically includes numerous private homes, as well as a semi-public courtyard whose ownership is shared by them. To enact the merger of the homes and courtyard into a single domain, all home owners as well as owners of the courtyard must pool together certain foodstuffs, which grants the area of the eruv the status of a single private domain. As a precondition for this merger, the area must be surrounded by a wall or fence.Maimonides, Mishne Torah (Hil. Eruvin 1:5). In many cases (for example, within an apartment complex or walled city) the demarcation of the shared area consists of real walls or fences. Building walls may also be used, and in some cases so may a natural wall such as a river bank or steep hill. Walls may include doors and windows. As such, the wall may even consist of a series of \\"doorframes\\" with almost no wall between them. Poles in the ground form the \\"doorposts\\" of the doorframe, and rope or wire between the poles forms the \\"lintel\\" of the doorframe. In modern cities, it is typical for the majority of an eruv to consist of such doorframes, using utility poles and wires. When a \\"doorframe\\" is used as part of an eruv, it is required that the \\"lintel\\" rest on top of the \\"doorpost\\", rather than being attached to the side of the \\"doorpost\\". Since the \\"lintel\\" is frequently a utility wire which runs along the side of the utility pole, the pole cannot be used as \\"doorpost\\". In this case, an additional \\"doorpost\\", known in Hebrew as a lechi (pl. lechai'in), is attached to the side of the utility pole. This typically takes the form of a thin plastic pipe attached to the side of the utility pole, and the wire runs directly overhead of this pipe. Within the walled area, a property transfer is needed to create the shared domain. This is formally effected today by having one resident give some \\"bread\\" to another resident to keep, to create a joint ownership of food for the whole community. This is usually done by the rabbi of the community to ensure that it is done correctly, and the bread is usually matzo to ensure that it will be edible and usable for a long time. (It is usually replaced once each year.) In the Talmud and other classic rabbinic sources, the term eruv refers to the bread itself. A typical modern eruv encloses public streets as well as private houses, and thus requires agreement from the government authorities controlling those streets. Creating an eruv that involves public property requires that a government entity grant permission in order for the eruv to be valid. This is often done by issuing a symbolic proclamation which has no weight in secular law (see Legal status). Sources In the Bible, calls on Jews \\"not to bring any burden into the gates of this city\\", suggesting that carrying a \\"burden\\" within the city was permissible, even though the city consisted of numerous separate private domains. The commentary of Radak suggests that such carrying was permitted because Jerusalem had an eruv and its walls formed the boundary, so carrying within the city was permitted.Translation and Radak commentary from Rabbi A.J. Rosenberg. Mikraoth Gedoloth: Jeremiah Vol. 1. Judaica Press, 1985 (2005 printing) p. 152. This view that an entire city could have an eruv influenced later views that an eruv could encompass a \\"courtyard\\" covering a wide area. Specific laws of eruv A gate in the eruv of Avnei Eitan, Golan Heights In general, authorities agree that eruvin are subject to certain restrictions. For example, they can be located in only certain places, and may not be of indefinite size. A prohibition against walking too far outside city boundaries (techum, see Eruv techumin) limits the possible size of an eruv. Also, the eruv walls or doorways must be at least 10 tefachim (about 1 meter) in height. The laws of eruv differ depending on whether the eruv contains only private domains and carmelit, or else public domains (reshut harabim deoraita) as well. If public domains are not included, the eruv wall may include \\"doorways\\" constructed out of wire and posts, with no actual door in them. If public domains are included, the wall must be an actual wall ‚Äì every \\"doorway\\" must have a door in it, and these doors must be closed each night. This situation was common in ancient walled cities, but is rare nowadays. So in practice, eruvin are only built in areas that do not include a public domain. What constitutes a \\"public area\\" is debated. The strict opinion holds that any road more than 16 cubits wide is a public domain, while the lenient opinion holds that a public domain must have both 16 cubits of width and 600,000 people passing through the road on a single day. In practice, communities that build eruvin accept the lenient opinion. However, in a few large cities such as New York City, it is possible that more than 600,000 people pass through certain roads in a single day. This would prevent building an eruv there even according to the lenient opinion. This possibility is the source of debates in New York City over whether a particular eruv, or any eruv is valid. Preparation of an eruv between Oz Zion and Giv'at Asaf In addition, the size of an eruv can be limited by a number of practical considerations. For example, the requirement that the eruv boundary be thoroughly checked each week and any needed repairs made before sunset on Friday limits the area that can be practically covered by a manageable eruv. The sensitivity of utility and public works crews about disturbing eruv- related attachments when making repairs can vary widely. Political and institutional differences, or differences about the correct interpretation of the relevant Jewish law, can also result in separate areas maintained by separate organizations.  Checking the eruv  The boundaries of an eruv must be checked regularly.Yosef Gavriel Bechhofer, \\"The Contemporary Eruv\\" (Feldheim, 2002), page 89, footnote 181: \\"It is customary to inspect municipal eruvin weekly. See Yesodei Yeshurun, ibid., pp. 331‚Äì32 for a discussion of the sources upon which the custom is based. I am indebted to Rabbi Ari Zivotofsky for the information that there are some communities that are very stringent when it comes to this inspection, to the extent that when Yom Tov falls on a Friday and precludes an effective inspection, these communities will not rely on an inspection conducted on Wednesday or Thursday before Yom Tov, and will assume the eruv to be invalid for the following Shabbos. Thus, the parameters of inspections are very subjective, and it is not necessarily possible to extrapolate from the guidelines of the community with an eruv that is subject to frequent manipulation by utility companies, etc., to a community with an eruv that is rarely disturbed, and vice versa.\\" (Source) If the boundary is not complete and contiguous in every element (i.e., one of the elements of the boundary is missing or broken), no valid eruv can exist that Shabbat, and carrying remains prohibited. Eruv associations generally maintain hotlines or web sites informing communities of the status of the eruv on Friday afternoon. Activities prohibited even within an eruv Though a valid eruv enables people to carry or move most items outdoors on Shabbat, all other Shabbat restrictions still apply. These prohibitions include: * Handling (or, according to some, moving) objects that are muktzeh, whether indoors or outdoors. * Opening an umbrella, which is analogous to erecting a tent, and falls under the category of construction. Since umbrellas may not be opened, they are muktzeh. * Typical weekday activities (uvdin d'chol), 'to protect the sanctity of Shabbat'. The precise scope of this prohibition is subject to a wide range of rabbinic opinion. * Moving or carrying items in preparation for a post-Shabbat activity (hakhana), unless one has a legitimate use for them on Shabbat itself. * Many sports and sport-related activities: Many authorities consider balls muktzeh; others do not.Shulchan Aruch OC 308:45 In general, sports that result in holes or ruts being carved into the playing surface may be played only on surfaces that are not subject to such damage. Exercise of any kind is only permitted on Shabbat if done for the pleasure of the activity itself, rather than for other reasons such as health.Shulchan Aruch OC 301:1‚Äì2 Disagreements among Orthodox groups Letter by 14 rabbis supporting the Manhattan eruv, 1960 There exists disagreement between rabbis about some of the technical requirements of a valid eruv. Thus, there are instances where Orthodox rabbis dispute the validity of a particular eruv (and therefore instruct their followers not to use it), or even dispute whether any eruv can be built in a certain location. One of the oldest halakhic disputes in the United States revolves around the issue of an eruv in Manhattan, New York. In 1905, Rabbi Yehoshua Seigel created an eruv on Manhattan's Lower East Side, bounded by seawalls which once protected the island as well as the Third Avenue El; however, some other rabbis ruled the eruv to be invalid. In the 1950s, a proposal by Rabbi Menachem Mendel Kasher to establish an eruv in Manhattan gained the support of many prominent rabbis, including Rabbis Yosef Eliyahu Henkin, Dovid Lifshitz, and Ephraim Oshry, and the Kopishnitzer, Novominsker and Radziner Rebbes. Other authorities, such as Rabbis Aharon Kotler and Moshe Feinstein, raised objections, and a major controversy ensued. In the end, the opponents Agudas Horabonim issued a declaration opposing it. Prohibition by the Agudas Horabonim, 1962 In June 2007, the East Side portion of the internal Manhattan Eruv was completed, offering an eruv within Manhattan to Orthodox Jews living on the East, Upper East, and Upper West Sides. There are also two eruvin in Manhattan's Washington Heights neighborhood, one covering the Yeshiva University area and another that is part of Mount Sinai Jewish Center and covers the Fort Washington area. Another ongoing dispute is the status of two inter-connected eruvin in Brooklyn: the Flatbush and Borough Park eruvin. The Borough Park eruv, from its initial construction, was rejected by most of the Hasidic community (though acceptance there has increased over time), and was rejected by most of the non-Hasidic \\"Lithuanian yeshiva\\" communities. The Flatbush eruv was originally built with the support of the Modern Orthodox community, and was later enhanced with the support of some local \\"non-Modern Orthodox\\" families. It was totally rejected by the many \\"Lithuanian yeshiva\\" communities led by the rosh yeshivas (\\"deans\\") of the large yeshivas Yeshiva Rabbi Chaim Berlin, Mir Yeshiva, and Yeshiva Torah Vodaas that are based in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn. In the Williamsburg section of Brooklyn, there is some dispute over the making of an eruv, with Rabbi Zalman Leib Teitelbaum, the Satmar Rebbe of Williamsburg leading the opposition to an eruv.  Eruv in Conservative and Reform Judaism  Although Conservative Judaism's Committee on Jewish Law and Standards enacted an exception to the general rules of Sabbath observance to permit driving to attend a synagogue, it otherwise formally requires the same rules of Shabbat observance as Orthodox Judaism with respect to carrying a burden. Therefore, Conservative Judaism's rabbinate requires the use of an eruv for ordinary carrying outside this exception. Compliance with the formal requirements varies. In general, Conservative authorities and organizations have not attempted to build or develop rules for eruvin distinct from ones established by Orthodox authorities and organizations. Reform, Reconstructionist, and other more liberal branches of Judaism do not call for observance of the underlying traditional rules against carrying, and hence the issue of an eruv is not relevant.  Coping without an eruv  An eruv surrounding a community in Jerusalem Many of those living in areas without an eruv are accustomed to life without one and have adapted their Shabbat practices accordingly. However, those who live in a place that has an eruv and are visiting a place without one, or if the eruv is temporarily out of service (perhaps due to wind or snow damage), may have difficulty making adjustments. Equally, those with young children, certain medical complaints and certain disabilities often feel trapped during Shabbat. Even without an eruv, there is no problem with wearing clothing outside, provided that it is normal clothing and being worn in its normal manner, as it is considered secondary to, and \\"part of,\\" the person themselves. The same is true for most medical items that are attached to the body and can be considered secondary to it, such as a cast, a bandage, or eyeglasses. Rabbinic authorities historically have differed about the use of a cane, wheelchair, or other similar devices by the less-able-bodied. Some have allowed their use even without an eruv and others have not. In recent years, however, the majority of poskim have leaned toward allowing these devices, since, if they were prohibited, disabled individuals might attempt to leave their homes on Shabbat without the device(s) and therefore risk serious injury. Loose medicines may not be carried; most authorities have agreed that it is preferable that one who constantly needs medication remain at home rather than transgressing Shabbat by carrying medication. But, if such a person leaves home, then comes in need of medication, it is permissible under the laws of Pikuach nefesh to break Shabbat and bring the medication to the person.Survey of Recent Halakhic Periodical Literature, Tradition: A Journal of Orthodox Jewish Thought vol. 16 (1977) No. 5, pp. 88‚Äì91.Rabbi Yirmiyohu Kaganoff: Carrying Nitroglycerin on Shabbos Yeshiva.co. A small number of authorities in recent years have been permitting carrying the medication, however, since such a person may be tempted to leave home without it, and then his/her life may be endangered thereafter. Many authorities allow the wearing of jewelry by women. As for a wristwatch, it could be seen either as an adornment (permitted to wear) or as a tool (forbidden to carry); therefore opinions are divided on whether men may wear wristwatches. In communities without an eruv, it is customary to create belts, bracelets, necklaces, or similar wearable objects incorporating housekeys so that the keys can be worn rather than carried when going outdoors. To be validly \\"worn\\" rather than \\"carried\\", the key needs to be an integral part of the belt, bracelet, or other item rather than simply attached to it.Rabbi Dovid Rosenfeld: Carrying Keys on Shabbat Aish.com. It may be either an adornment if worn in a manner visible to others or a component needed to keep the wearable object fastened. Special \\"shabbos belts\\" and similar items that incorporate this property are sold in religious stores. A tallit may be worn while walking to/from the synagogue, as it is considered clothing. Prayer books and other books may not be carried; either they must be brought to the synagogue prior to Shabbat or else the congregation's prayer books must be used.  Communities with eruvin  In Israel, almost every Jewish community is enclosed by an eruv. Outside Israel, there are over 150 community eruvin, as well as thousands of private ones enclosing only a few homes, or linking a synagogue to one or more nearby homes. Most major cities in North America have at least one, often surrounding only the Orthodox Jewish neighborhoods rather than the entire city. Outside North America, there are eruvin in Antwerp; Amsterdam; Bury, Greater Manchester (Whitefield); Gibraltar; Johannesburg; London; Melbourne; Perth; Rio de Janeiro; Strasbourg;Katz, Nathan. Strasbourg : Le erouv de la capitale de l‚ÄôAlsace. Actualit√© juive Hebdo, Oktober 17, 2013. Sydney; Venice and Vienna. Controversies The installation of eruvin has been a matter of contention in many neighbourhoods around the world, with notable examples including the London Borough of Barnet; Outremont, Quebec; Tenafly, New Jersey; Agoura Hills, California; Westhampton Beach, New York; and Bergen County, New Jersey. As the property-owner is the owner of the public streets, sidewalks and the utility poles on which symbolic boundaries are to be strung, some authorities have interpreted Jewish law as requiring the local government to participate in the process as one of the property owners by agreeing to the creation of the eruv, and to give permission for the construction of a symbolic boundary on its property. In addition, because municipal law and the rules of utility companies, in general, prohibit third parties from stringing attachments to utility poles and wires, the creation of an eruv has often necessitated obtaining permissions, easements, and exceptions to various local ordinances. These requirements that government give active permission for an eruv have given rise to both political and legal controversy. Demographic changes Jewish people who are not in favor of an eruv may feel that after an eruv is created they live in a symbolically segregated community.https://cardozo.yu.edu/sites/default/files/Mintz.pdf \\"It's like social engineering,\\" said Arnold Sheiffer, founder of the opposition group Jewish People for the Betterment of Westhampton Beach. \\"We [the Jewish people] fought like hell to get out of the ghetto and now they want to create that again. The opposition in the village here is very, very high.\\"  Legal status  In the United States, legal controversies about an eruv in a community often focus on provisions of the First Amendment of the Constitution of the United States, which addresses relations between government and religion. Opponents of an eruv typically take the view that the government participation in the eruv process necessary to approve its construction violates the First Amendment's prohibition of governmental establishment of religion. Proponents take the view that it constitutes a constitutionally permissible accommodation of religion rather than an establishment. Proponents have also argued that the Free Exercise Clause affirmatively requires government acceptance, on the grounds that government interference with or failure to accommodate an eruv constitutes discrimination against or inhibition of the constitutional right of free exercise of religion. In the 2002 decision on Tenafly Eruv Association v. Borough of Tenafly, Judge Ambro, writing for the United States Third Circuit Court of Appeals, held that Eruv Association members had no intrinsic right to add attachments to telephone poles on Borough property and that the borough, if it wished, could enact a general, neutral ordinance against all attachments to utility poles that could be enforced against the eruv. However, Judge Ambro held that in this case, the Borough had not enacted a genuinely general or neutral ordinance because it permitted a wide variety of attachments to utility poles for non-religious purposes, including posting signs and other items. Because it permitted attachments to utility poles for secular purposes, the court held, it could not selectively exclude attachments for religious purposes.Tenafly Eruv Association v. Borough of Tenafly, 309 F.3d 144, American Civil Liberties Union of New Jersey, October 24, 2002 The United States Supreme Court declined to hear the case. It was subsequently cited as precedent by a number of other federal courts deciding disputes between an eruv association and a local government. In Outremont, a neighbourhood in Montreal, Quebec, Canada, the city adopted a policy of removing eruv wires. In 2001, the Hasidic community obtained an injunction preventing such action by the city authorities. PVC pipe, attached to a utility pole in Mahwah, New Jersey, serving as a lechi to demarcate an eruv Between 2015 and 2018, there were ongoing issues with eruv markings extended on utility poles in a section of New Jersey. The adjoining municipalities of Mahwah, Upper Saddle River and Montvale, all border the state line on the other side of which is Rockland County, New York, where there are large communities of Orthodox Jews. After some eruvin were extended into Bergen County, allowing travel in the area, the municipalities took action in 2017 to dismantle the lechi markings. The matter was taken to court, and in January 2018 the presiding judge in the lawsuits made it clear he felt the municipalities did not have a strong case, and urged them to settle. The three municipalities have settled with the eruv association, allowing the eruv borders to remain in New Jersey, reimbursed the association's legal fees, received agreement from the association to adjust the color of the lechi mounted on local utility poles, and agreed to work through a few remaining route details. In general, state law has dealt with whether and to what extent government can permit or assist the erection and maintenance of boundary demarcations on public property. It has not dealt with the nature of the aggregation agreement or recognized an eruv as having legal effect or as implementing a meaningful change in real property ownership or tenancy. For purposes of accident liability, trespass, insurance, and other secular matters occurring on Shabbat, state law treats the properties within an eruv as continuing to be separate parcels. Other forms of eruv The term eruv is also used to refer to other, unrelated concepts in halakha. These include the eruv techumin which enables one to travel beyond the normal travel restrictions on Shabbat or holidays, and the eruv tavshilin which enables one to cook for Shabbat on a holiday which immediately precedes that Shabbat. Eruv techumin An eruv techumin (Hebrew: ◊¢◊ô◊®◊ï◊ë ◊™◊ó◊ï◊û◊ô◊ü \\"mixing of borders\\") for traveling enables a traditionally observant Jew to travel by foot on Shabbat or a Jewish holiday beyond the 2,000-cubit (one biblical mile) limit imposed by rabbinic restriction.Shulhan Arukh (Orach Chaim ¬ß 397:1‚Äì3); Maimonides, Mishne Torah (Hil.

Since food cannot be cooked on Shabbat, the only way to eat freshly cooked food on Shabbat is to cook it on Friday, which in this case is a holiday. The eruv tavshilin allows this cooking to be done in a way that does not violate the holiday work restrictions.

Plot summary In this story some aliens come to Earth as perfect replicas of a group of astronauts who died during a mission to Mars. The astronauts seem to be utterly convinced they are humans and they do not understand why the FBI chases them after they have 'come back' to Earth. Humans only know that these astronauts are not the same as those who originally left for Mars, and nothing more. The original astronauts could have been saved and/or cloned by the aliens. The disguise could be a way to try to communicate more easily with the earthlings. Still other factors could explain these perfect copies of human beings, but the earthlings have no intention of investigating them. Above all, the possible threat must be eliminated, and only then questions can be asked. At the end of the story, Wilks, an FBI agent, poses the central question raised by the story: After this brief meditation Wilks goes on to kill the last of the six astronauts, but he soon realizes that he did it only because he was afraid of an alien invasion: \\"That's what we are told... they are plotting against us, are inhuman, and will never be more than that\\". He also realizes that the cycle will only continue. At the end of Explorers We the beginning is repeated. Another spaceship with the same six astronauts aboard lands on Earth.

Aviation Publishers Co. Limited, Ottawa Ontario, Twenty Seventh Revised Edition, 1996. On a simple monoplane configuration, this is usually easy to identify. However, on parasol wing or multiple boom aircraft, the wing may not have a distinct root area. The opposite end of a wing from the wing root is the wing tip. The aerodynamic properties of the overall aircraft can be greatly impacted by the shaping and other design choices of the wing root. During both normal flight and landings, the wing root of an aircraft would be typically subjected to the highest bending forces through the aircraft. As a means of reducing interference drag between the wing and the fuselage, the use of fairings (often referred to as \\"wing fillets\\") became commonplace during the first half of the twentieth century; the use of wing root fairings has been credited with achieving more favourable flight characteristics at both high and low speeds. Furthermore, various other innovations and approaches have been developed to influence/control airflow in the vicinity of the wing root to achieve more favourable performance. Various calculating methods for designed an optimal wing root of an aircraft have been devised. Fatigue has been recognised as a critical life-limiting factor associated with the wing root, which will eventually lead to catastrophic failure if not monitored. Accordingly, it is commonplace within an aircraft's maintenance regime to mandate periodic assessments of the wing root to check for fatigue cracking and other signs of strain. For this purpose, the use of appropriately-applied strain gauges has become widespread, although alternative methods of detection have also been used. The complexity of the wing root can be greatly increased by the desired role and performance requirements of the aircraft in question. For instance, numerous naval aircraft intended for use at sea have incorporated wing-folding mechanisms into their wing roots, necessitating the installation of a hinge and other compromises to allow for folding. Other examples of specific needs include the presence of high-lift devices, which can be installed around the wing root for increased generation of lift as well as to optimize load distribution. In the case of very high speed hypersonic aircraft, the wing root is judged to be a critical structural areas in terms of its heat migration and dissipation properties.

Its construction started in 1604. It was the first summit level canal in Europe that was built using pound locks, connecting the Loire and Seine valleys. It is long and is part of the Bourbonnais route from Saint-Mamm√®s on the Seine to Chalon-sur- Sa√¥ne on the Sa√¥ne. From Briare to Buges, the canal rises through the first 12 locks some and then falls through the remaining 24 locks. Construction  The canal was initiated by Maximilien de B√©thune, duc de Sully, with support from Henry IV in order to develop the grain trade, and to reduce food shortages. Its construction started in 1604 and was completed in 1642. Between 6,000 and 12,000 labourers worked on this canal which connects the basins of the River Loire and the River Seine. Hugues Cosnier obtained the contract to build the second canal crossing a watershed in Europe, involving many more locks than on the first. It was thus necessary to use locks. A staircase of seven locks was built in Rogny-les-Sept-√âcluses. (This was bypassed in 1887 but is preserved as an ancient monument and floodlit at night.) After Henri IV's assassination, Hugues Cosnier had to give up work in 1611. In 1638, Guillaume Boutheroue and Jacques Guyon applied to resume work, and received letters patent from Louis XIII for this purpose. They created with other nobles the Compagnie des seigneurs du canal de Loyre en Seine and work was completed by 1642. Reservoirs were dug to supply the approximately 2000 cubic meters of water displaced at each lock. They include the reservoirs of Turfs, Chesnoy, Grand-r√ª, Tilery, Du Chateau, Cahauderie, Beaurois, the Bourdon reservoir, and the Moutiers reservoir on the Loing. The original source of water was the √âtang de la Gazonne. Usage By the mid 18th century more than 500 wine barges were in use bringing wines from the Auvergne, M√¢con, Beaujolais, Sancerre, and Languedoc regions. Other cargoes included firewood, timber, coal and iron, fa√Øence from Nevers and fruit from the Auvergne. All hauling was done by men, generally two to a boat. Shortages of water in the reservoirs and Loire valley often resulted in 2‚Äì3 months closure per year. Modifications Briare canal in Rogny-les-Sept-√âcluses. The old seven lock staircase is in the background The canal was repurchased by the State in 1860. In periods of drought the canal's reservoirs were insufficient to keep the canal full of water, therefore in 1894 and 1895 a pumping station was built to pump water into the summit pound. The Briare aqueduct built over the Loire in Briare between 1890 and 1896 by the engineer Abel Mazoyer is part of the Canal lat√©ral √† la Loire, and replaced the old line of that canal, built between 1820 and 1830.

MSSS is headed by chief scientist and CEO Michael C. Malin. Founded in 1990, their first mission was the failed 1993 Mars Observer for which they developed and operated the Mars Observer Camera Ground Data System. After this mission they were selected to provide the main camera for Mars Global Surveyor. They also developed the cameras that were carried on Mars Polar Lander, Mars Climate Orbiter, 2001 Mars Odyssey, Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter and 'Phoenix lander. Mars Color Imager on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiterright One of the most successful of their instruments to date was the Mars Observer Camera (MOC), on board the Mars Global Surveyor placed into orbit around Mars in September 1997. From that date until November 2006, the MOC took more than 243,000 images of Mars, some at very high resolution. Among the MOCs notable successes was the imaging of the landing sites of the two Mars Exploration Rovers (the discarded heatshield of one of the rovers was located). Even before they landed, images from the MOC were very useful in picking the destinations of the two rovers. After more than nine years of active duty, the Mars Global Surveyor ceased sending data back to Earth and it is now lost along with all its instruments, including the MOC. For the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, launched on August 12, 2005, MSSS built the Mars Color Imager (MARCI) which takes wide angle, daily global views of Mars and the Context Imager (CTX) which has a six-metre resolution. The Mars Science Laboratory was launched in 2011 and it carries three MSSS cameras. The MastCam is the main camera on board taking still and motion images of the surroundings. The 'HandLens Imager' is on the instrument arm and provides close up images of martian soil and rocks. Finally the Mars Descent Imager (MARDI) provided high resolution images of the ground during descent. In December 2004, MSSS was selected to provide three cameras for the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (2008) mission, under contract to Northwestern University. Recently, The MSSS has developed JunoCam for the Juno Jupiter Mission, which launched in 2011. In July 2014, NASA announced the selection of the Mastcam-Z proposal for the upcoming Mars 2020 rover mission, to be provided by MSSS. It is an improved zoom version of the original MastCam. The Mars Orbiter Camera, built by Malin Space Science Systems and used by NASA on the Mars Observer and Mars Global Surveyor spacecraft.  Liquid water on Mars  In June 2000, evidence for water currently under the surface of Mars was discovered in the form of flood-like gullies.Malin, Michael C., Edgett, Kenneth S., \\"Evidence for Recent Groundwater Seepage and Surface Runoff on Mars\\". Science (2000) Vol. 288. no. 5475, pp. 2330‚Äì2335. The question that was immediately asked was: is this an ongoing process or is this ancient and simply well preserved evidence of water/liquid flow? Most scientists agree that it is highly likely that water did flow on Mars in the distant past.MSSS June 2000 article Malin's camera controllers attempted to answer this question by taking photos of the same locations and in 2005 observation showed two areas where change had clearly occurred within the time of the photos (in other words, the activity was happening in present time and was not ancient). On December 6, 2006, MSSS announced that it had discovered evidence that liquid water had likely flowed on Mars within the past five years. At a press conference, NASA showed images taken by the Mars Global Surveyor that suggested that water occasionally flows on the surface of Mars. The images did not actually show flowing water. Rather, they showed changes in craters and sediment deposits, providing the strongest evidence yet that water coursed through them as recently as several years ago, and is perhaps doing so even now. The findings were published in the December 8, 2006 issue of the journal Science.Scientists: Water likely flows on Mars, Associated Press, accessed on December 7, 2006 Malin Systems published several documents which describe what they found: * New Gully Deposit in a Crater in Terra Sirenum: Evidence That Water Flowed on Mars in This Decade? * Support for Hypothesis that Groundwater is Source for Fluid Responsible for Erosion in Martian Gullies * Why the New Gully Deposits Are Not Dry Dust Slope Streaks Before the December 2006 paper, some researchers were skeptical that liquid water was responsible for the surface features seen by the spacecraft. They said other materials such as sand or dust can flow like a liquid and produce similar results. At this stage, (late 2006) the flowing water hypothesis looks strong, however more evidence is needed. For more, see Life on Mars.  Geysers on Mars Ron Miller. The MSSS cameras on board the Mars Global Surveyor, produced high resolution images that were also processed by Malin Space Science Systems, and discovered the intriguing polar features informally known as 'dark dune spots' and 'spiders'. The origin of dark dune spots and the dark slope streaks emanating from them is yet uncertain, and various hypotheses have been put forward on their origin and formation process. The current model proposed by NASA and European teams propose cold geyser-like systems that eject CO2 and dark basaltic sand. The seasonal frosting of some areas near the southern ice cap results in the formation of transparent 1 metre thick slabs of dry ice above the ground. With the arrival of spring, sunlight warms the subsurface and pressure from subliming CO2 builds up under a slab, elevating and ultimately rupturing it. This leads to geyser-like eruptions of CO2 gas mixed with dark basaltic sand or dust. This process is rapid, observed happening in the space of a few days, weeks or months, a growth rate rather unusual in geology ‚Äì especially for Mars. The gas rushing underneath a slab to the site of a geyser carves a spider-like pattern of radial channels under the ice.

She was named for Henry Laub. As USS Laub Laub was laid down by Bethlehem Shipbuilding Corporation, Squantum, Massachusetts, on 20 April 1918. The destroyer was launched on 28 August 1918, sponsored by Miss Marjorie Mohan, a collateral descendant of Henry Laub. The ship was commissioned on 17 March 1919, Commander W. F. Amsden in command. Assigned to the Atlantic destroyer force out of Newport, Rhode Island, Laub was dispatched 2 to 17 May 1919 to take up position off Newfoundland as plane guard, and navigational aid during the NC-4 transatlantic flight. The destroyer continued exercises off the east coast until 30 June when she sailed for European service. Arriving Brest 17 July, Laub operated with the fleet off Western Europe until she sailed late in August for duty in the eastern Mediterranean. Upon arrival at Constantinople 2 September, Laub operated with the Food Commission, bringing relief to Europe. She sailed for America on the 17th, arriving New York City 4 October. Her stay on the east coast was a brief one as she sailed 2 weeks later to join the Pacific Fleet, arriving San Diego, California 27 November. From December 1919 until she decommissioned 15 June 1922, Laub performed torpedo experiments and reserve training cruises along the Pacific coast. Laub recommissioned 18 December 1939, Cmdr. B. W. Chippendale in command. After shakedown out of San Diego, the destroyer arrived Guantanamo 7 April 1940 to join the Caribbean Neutrality patrol. Following 2 months' duty out of Guantanamo, she sailed to Galveston, Texas, for patrol operations in the Gulf of Mexico. Following 4 months of operations in the gulf and along the Atlantic coast, Laub arrived at Halifax, Nova Scotia, 5 September. She decommissioned there 8 October 1940. As HMS Burwell Laub was transferred to Great Britain the following day as part of the destroyer-bases agreement. During World War II she served in the Royal Navy protecting Allied shipping in the North Atlantic under the name HMS Burwell. As Burwell was modified for trade convoy escort service by removal of three of the original 4\\"/50 caliber guns and one of the triple torpedo tube mounts to reduce topside weight for additional depth charge stowage and installation of Hedgehog.Lenton&Colledge; (1968) pp.92-94 In this role Burwell was engaged in all the duties performed by escort ships; protecting convoys, searching for and attacking U-boats which attacked ships in convoy, and rescuing survivors. In sixteen months service Burwell escorted 24 Atlantic and three Gibraltar convoys, of which seven were attacked, and she was involved in two major convoy battles; around SC 52 in November 1941 and KMS 10 in March 1943. A notable incident during this period was her involvement in the capture of the German U-boat U-570 in August 1941. In October 1943 Burwell was withdrawn to the Reserve and converted to an Air target Ship. She continued in this function until January 1945 when she was withdrawn completely and laid up. In March 1947 Burwell was sold for scrap.

It was designed to provide high performance on complex queries against large databases, such as combining tables with hundreds of columns and millions of rows. MonetDB has been applied in high-performance applications for online analytical processing, data mining, geographic information system (GIS), Resource Description Framework (RDF), text retrieval and sequence alignment processing.  History  The older MonetDB logo Data mining projects in the 1990s required improved analytical database support. This resulted in a CWI spin-off called Data Distilleries, which used early MonetDB implementations in its analytical suite. Data Distilleries eventually became a subsidiary of SPSS in 2003, which in turn was acquired by IBM in 2009. MonetDB in its current form was first created in 2002 by doctoral student Peter Boncz and professor Martin L. Kersten as part of the 1990s' MAGNUM research project at University of Amsterdam. It was initially called simply Monet, after the French impressionist painter Claude Monet. The first version under an open-source software license (a modified version of the Mozilla Public License) was released on September 30, 2004. When MonetDB version 4 was released into the open-source domain, many extensions to the code base were added by the MonetDB/CWI team, including a new SQL front end, supporting the SQL:2003 standard.MonetDB historic background MonetDB introduced innovations in all layers of the DBMS: a storage model based on vertical fragmentation, a modern CPU-tuned query execution architecture that often gave MonetDB a speed advantage over the same algorithm over a typical interpreter-based RDBMS. It was one of the first database systems to tune query optimization for CPU caches. MonetDB includes automatic and self-tuning indexes, run-time query optimization, and a modular software architecture.P. A. Boncz, T. Grust, M. van Keulen, S. Manegold, J. Rittinger, J. Teubner. MonetDB/XQuery: A Fast XQuery Processor Powered by a Relational Engine . In Proceedings of the ACM SIGMOD International Conference on Management of Data, Chicago, IL, USA, June 2006. By 2008, a follow-on project called X100 (MonetDB/X100) started, which evolved into the VectorWise technology. VectorWise was acquired by Actian Corporation, integrated with the Ingres database and sold as a commercial product. In 2011 a major effort to renovate the MonetDB codebase was started. As part of it, the code for the MonetDB 4 kernel and its XQuery components were frozen. In MonetDB 5, parts of the SQL layer were pushed into the kernel. The resulting changes created a difference in internal APIs, as it transitioned from MonetDB Instruction Language (MIL) to MonetDB Assembly Language (MAL). Older, no-longer maintained top-level query interfaces were also removed. First was XQuery, which relied on MonetDB 4 and was never ported to version 5. The experimental Jaql interface support was removed with the October 2014 release. With the July 2015 release, MonetDB gained support for read-only data sharding and persistent indices. In this release the deprecated streaming data module DataCell was also removed from the main codebase in an effort to streamline the code. In addition, the license has been changed into the Mozilla Public License, version 2.0.  Architecture  MonetDB architecture is represented in three layers, each with its own set of optimizers. The front end is the top layer, providing query interface for SQL, with SciQL and SPARQL interfaces under development. Queries are parsed into domain-specific representations, like relational algebra for SQL, and optimized. The generated logical execution plans are then translated into MonetDB Assembly Language (MAL) instructions, which are passed to the next layer. The middle or back-end layer provides a number of cost-based optimizers for the MAL. The bottom layer is the database kernel, which provides access to the data stored in Binary Association Tables (BATs). Each BAT is a table consisting of an Object-identifier and value columns, representing a single column in the database. MonetDB internal data representation also relies on the memory addressing ranges of contemporary CPUs using demand paging of memory mapped files, and thus departing from traditional DBMS designs involving complex management of large data stores in limited memory.  Query Recycling  Query recycling is an architecture for reusing the byproducts of the operator-at-a-time paradigm in a column store DBMS. Recycling makes use of the generic idea of storing and reusing the results of expensive computations. Unlike low-level instruction caches, query recycling uses an optimizer to pre- select instructions to cache. The technique is designed to improve query response times and throughput, while working in a self-organizing fashion.* The authors from the CWI Database Architectures group, composed of Milena Ivanova, Martin Kersten, Niels Nes and Romulo Goncalves, won the \\"Best Paper Runner Up\\" at the ACM SIGMOD 2009 conference for their work on Query Recycling.  Database Cracking  MonetDB was one of the first databases to introduce Database Cracking. Database Cracking is an incremental partial indexing and/or sorting of the data. It directly exploits the columnar nature of MonetDB. Cracking is a technique that shifts the cost of index maintenance from updates to query processing. The query pipeline optimizers are used to massage the query plans to crack and to propagate this information. The technique allows for improved access times and self-organized behavior. Database Cracking received the ACM SIGMOD 2011 J.Gray best dissertation award.  Components  A number of extensions exist for MonetDB that extend the functionality of the database engine. Due to the three-layer architecture, top-level query interfaces can benefit from optimizations done in the backend and kernel layers.  SQL  MonetDB/SQL is a top-level extension, which provides complete support for transactions in compliance with the SQL:2003 standard.  GIS  MonetDB/GIS is an extension to MonetDB/SQL with support for the Simple Features Access standard of Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC).  SciQL  SciQL an SQL-based query language for science applications with arrays as first class citizens. SciQL allows MonetDB to effectively function as an array database. SciQL is used in the European Union PlanetData and TELEIOS project, together with the Data Vault technology, providing transparent access to large scientific data repositories. Data Vaults map the data from the distributed repositories to SciQL arrays, allowing for improved handling of spatio-temporal data in MonetDB. SciQL will be further extended for the Human Brain Project.  Data Vaults  Data Vault is a database- attached external file repository for MonetDB, similar to the SQL/MED standard. The Data Vault technology allows for transparent integration with distributed/remote file repositories. It is designed for scientific data data exploration and mining, specifically for remote sensing data. There is support for the GeoTIFF (Earth observation), FITS (astronomy), MiniSEED (seismology) and NetCDF formats. The data is stored in the file repository in the original format, and loaded in the database in a lazy fashion, only when needed. The system can also process the data upon ingestion, if the data format requires it. As a result, even very large file repositories can be efficiently analyzed, as only the required data is processed in the database. The data can be accessed through either the MonetDB SQL or SciQL interfaces. The Data Vault technology was used in the European Union's TELEIOS project, which was aimed at building a virtual observatory for Earth observation data. Data Vaults for FITS files have also been used for processing astronomical survey data for The INT Photometric H-Alpha Survey (IPHAS) = SAM/BAM = MonetDB has a SAM/BAM module for efficient processing of sequence alignment data. Aimed at the bioinformatics research, the module has a SAM/BAM data loader and a set of SQL UDFs for working with DNA data. The module uses the popular SAMtools library.  RDF/SPARQL  MonetDB/RDF is a SPARQL-based extension for working with linked data, which adds support for RDF and allowing MonetDB to function as a triplestore. Under development for the Linked Open Data 2 project.  R integration  MonetDB/R module allows for UDFs written in R to be executed in the SQL layer of the system. This is done using the native R support for running embedded in another application, inside the RDBMS in this case. Previously the MonetDB.R connector allowed the using MonetDB data sources and process them in an R session. The newer R integration feature of MonetDB does not require data to be transferred between the RDBMS and the R session, reducing overhead and improving performance. The feature is intended to give users access to functions of the R statistical software for in-line analysis of data stored in the RDBMS. It complements the existing support for C UDFs and is intended to be used for in-database processing. Python integration Similarly to the embedded R UDFs in MonetDB, the database now has support for UDFs written in Python/NumPy. The implementation uses Numpy arrays (themselves Python wrappers for C arrays), as a result there is limited overhead - providing a functional Python integration with speed matching native SQL functions. The Embedded Python functions also support mapped operations, allowing user to execute Python functions in parallel within SQL queries. The practical side of the feature gives users access to Python/NumPy/SciPy libraries, which can provide a large selection of statistical/analytical functions. MonetDBLite Following the release of remote driver for R (MonetDB.R) and R UDFs in MonetDB (MonetDB/R), the authors created an embedded version of MonetDB in R called MonetDBLite. It is distributed as an R package, removing the need to manage a database server, required for the previous R integrations. The DBMS runs within the R process itself, eliminating socket communication and serialisation overhead - greatly improving efficiency. The idea behind it is to deliver an SQLite-like package for R, with the performance of an in-memory optimized columnar store. Former extensions A number of former extensions have been deprecated and removed from the stable code base over time. Some notable examples include an XQuery extension removed in MonetDB version 5; a JAQL extension, and a streaming data extension called Data Cell.

It was first formed in 1988 together with Popular Action and Christian People's Party, FREDEMO. In 1990 FREDEMO launched the Movimiento Libertad led by Mario Vargas Llosa as its presidential candidate. It was an attempt to make alliances between libertarian and the conservative right-wing factions. It led to a break between Vargas Llosa and Hernando de Soto.

Plot In 1967, Hong Kong, Ben, Paul, and Frank are childhood friends and members of a gang. They regularly brawl with members of other gangs. Ben becomes engaged to his girlfriend Jane and Frank takes out a loan to pay for the reception. He is attacked by the leader of another gang, Ringo, and they fight over the money. After the wedding Ben and Frank attack Ringo in retaliation and Frank gets carried away and kills him. They meet with Paul and decide to flee Hong Kong to escape the police. They decide to go to Vietnam, as they have heard that there is money to be made as smugglers due to the war. Ben, Paul, and Frank get a load of contraband goods from a Hong Kong smuggler and agree to take them to a Vietnamese gangster named Leong. The three friends leave and reach Saigon by boat, only to have a Vietcong suicide bomber destroy all of their goods in an attempt on an officer of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam. They are arrested as suspects in the bombing and beaten, until the real bomber is discovered and executed in front of them. They meet Luke, a hitman working for Leong, who dreams of escaping Vietnam with Sally, a nightclub singer Leong has kidnapped and forced into prostitution. The four men attempt to save her, a plan which goes wrong and culminates in a shootout in the nightclub. During the altercation Paul discovers a box of gold in Leong's office and steals it. They escape the nightclub, but Sally is shot in the back and injured. The next morning, the five of them wait by the river for a boat that is supposed to pick them up. Ben and Frank are concerned with Sally and Paul guards the gold. They are attacked by gangsters and the ARVN as the boat arrives, and Sally dies just as they board it. Luke lets her body drift down the river. As they escape, the boat breaks down, and Paul becomes distressed over losing the gold. The three friends fight over Paul's preoccupation with the gold, and Ben and Frank tell him that the friendship is over. The boat is attacked by gangsters and sunk. Luke, Ben, and Frank escape, but Paul goes back for the gold, almost drowning before Ben and Frank save him and the gold. Ben, Paul, and Frank are captured by the Vietcong and taken to a concentration camp. The Vietcong take the gold, and find intelligence documents in the box that Leong was going to sell to the North Vietnamese. The three friends are brutally interrogated, and Paul claims to work for the CIA to save the others. Frank is forced to kill other prisoners, which distresses him, but Ben asks to join in. When he is told to kill Frank he turns on their captors and they escape, aided by the arrival of a squad of Americans led by Luke. Paul escapes from the Vietcong as well and takes the gold into a field. Frank, who is wounded, follows him and begs for help. They hide from the Vietcong and Paul urges Frank to be quiet, but he continues to scream in pain and fear, and Paul finally shoots him in the back of the head to silence him. Luke rushes to Frank's side, finding him still alive, and loads him into a helicopter. Ben chases Paul, who finds his way to a peaceful river village and steals a boat, massacring the villagers in the process. Ben witnesses this, and when he tries to save a child Paul shoots them both and escapes. Ben is saved by some monks, and eventually makes his way back to Saigon, where a badly disfigured Luke tells him that Frank is still alive, but that his head injury has changed him; he is now addicted to heroin and works as a contract killer. Luke takes Ben to see him, and after a brief altercation, Ben shoots Frank to put him out of his misery. Ben travels back to Hong Kong and is reunited with Jane, who has given birth to a child. Meanwhile, Paul has become a successful businessman. Ben confronts him over his actions, showing him Frank's skull and blaming him for what happened to him. Paul is indifferent and kicks Ben out. Later, Ben attacks Paul on the street and they engage in a car chase. They find themselves on the pier where they played together as children. They crash their cars, and continue to fight. Eventually Ben shoots Paul fatally, then tosses his gun away and limps from the scene.

Woo reworked the script into what it is today, and Tsui made his own prequel, A Better Tomorrow III. After the breakup with his partnership with Tsui, Woo was having trouble finding backing for his films; stories have circulated that Tsui (one of the most powerful men in Hong Kong cinema) said Woo was hard to work with, and this led to his virtual blacklisting. At any rate, Woo financed almost all of the cost of the movie out of his own pocket. Woo rewrote much of the script to incorporate his reaction to the 1989 incident in Tiananmen Square in Beijing. Woo has described this project as his equivalent of Apocalypse Now, as it had the same exhausting and draining effect on him as that film had on Francis Ford Coppola. The cost of the film was around US$3.5 million, the highest budget for a Hong Kong film at the time. Like Woo's previous film, The Killer, this film did not do well in Hong Kong because audiences didn't like the allusions to the Tiananmen Square protests during the riot scenes. Woo was deeply affected by the shootings and felt bad that he touched such a raw nerve in people, but at the same time he felt the Chinese people should react and not hide from it. Filming The Vietnam exteriors were shot in Thailand, and the interiors were shot in Hong Kong at the Cinema City Studio. It was deemed too expensive to shoot the nightclub shootout in Thailand. The helicopter footage used in the camp raid was a mixture of stock footage from the Vietnam War, as well as scenes from another Vietnam film. During the filming of some of the riot sequences, things got so chaotic on the set that John Woo panicked and ran into several shots. Once, he actually ran into an explosion, which caused large cuts on his head. Simon Yam actually burnt his face during the POW camp sequence. Reception=Box office In Hong Kong, the film grossed HK$8,545,123 ‚Äì a disaster when considering its large budget.Bullet in the Head (1990) John Woo is quoted in Jeff Yang's book Once Upon a Time in China as saying that Tsui Hark's A Better Tomorrow III was rushed into theatres to beat Bullet in the Head at the box office. Critical reception In his book The Hong Kong Filmography: 1977‚Äì1999 John Charles gave the film a nine out of ten rating, declaring it as John Woo's \\"most emotionally powerful film\\" that \\"comes close to being a masterpiece\\" The review compared the film to The Deer Hunter, stating that its influence was \\"obvious\\" but that one could miss the first half an hour of the aforementioned film and not miss any important information. The review praised Romeo Diaz and James Wong's score as \\"superb\\". In 2014, Time Out polled several film critics, directors, actors and stunt actors to list their top action films. Bullet in the Head was listed at 93rd place on this list. Censorship Woo's original cut of the film ran over three hours long. Golden Princess demanded that Woo cut the film down to a commercially viable length; however, the original theatrical version still remained massively edited from Woo's final cut. As a result, the film exists in many different cuts due to local/market censorship. The longest version available now is the 2 disc-set edition by Joy Sales with a runtime of 135 minutes. The longer 136-minute version was screened at a festival and was released on a bootleg VHS. DVD release On 5 July 2004, a DVD was released on a two-disc platinum edition by Hong Kong Legends in the United Kingdom in Region 2. One year later, The John Woo Collection DVD was released on 5 September 2005, as a four-disc set including two Chow Yun-fat films: The Killer and Once a Thief. All three films were directed by John Woo. A director's cut lasting 136 minutes screened at some festivals. It has been illegally released on a bootleg VHS. Another 135-minute version released on DVD has been sold to the public legally. It is distributed by Joy Sales; this disc has seamless branching which can be shown in its Theatrical Version, Alternate Ending version and the Festival Print version but the deleted scenes maintain a blue tint (possibly from the chemicals of the film reacting badly) and also frame jumping (film preservation done too late by the director himself).

The Japanese term comes from the Tang dynasty Chinese term \\"ËéäÂúí\\" (Mandarin: zhuƒÅngyu√°n, Cantonese: zong1 jyun4). Sh≈çen, from about the 8th to the late 15th century, describes any of the private, tax-free, often autonomous estates or manors whose rise undermined the political and economic power of the emperor and contributed to the growth of powerful local clans. The estates developed from land tracts assigned to officially sanctioned Shint≈ç shrines or Buddhist temples or granted by the emperor as gifts to the Imperial family, friends, or officials. As these estates grew, they became independent of the civil administrative system and contributed to the rise of a local military class. With the establishment of the Kamakura shogunate, or military dictatorship, in 1192, centrally appointed stewards weakened the power of these local landlords. The sh≈çen system passed out of existence around the middle of the 15th century, when villages became self-governing units, owing loyalty to a feudal lord (daimy≈ç) who subdivided the area into fiefs and collected a fixed tax. After the decay of the ritsury≈ç system, a feudal system of manors developed. Landowners or nameholders commended shares of the revenue produced (called shiki) to more powerful leaders often at the court, in order to be exempted from taxes and to subvert the Chinese-style \\"equal fields\\" system, whereby land was redistributed after certain periods of time. In the Kamakura period a hierarchy of nameholder, manor stewards (jit≈ç), shugo (military provincial governor), and the sh≈çgun in Kamakura had evolved. These sh≈çen were completely free from interference from the government, which therefore had no say or control of what occurred within the sh≈çens boundaries. By the end of the Heian period virtually all Japanese land had become sh≈çen and continued to be through the ≈ånin War until the Sengoku period. History Sh≈çen appeared in the 6th century and disappeared in the 16th century. They can be distinguished by historical period, and a sh≈çen of each period had specific features in its formation and relationships with the cultivators of its fields. There are two primary periods of sh≈çen development, although in fact smaller and more detailed categorizations exist. The first type; which developed in the middle of the Nara period, are now called shoki-sh≈çen (ÂàùÊúüÂ∫ÑÂúí, lit. \\"early Sh≈çen\\"). Sh≈çen of the second type, which continued from the middle of Heian period to the Sengoku period, are called ch≈´sei-sh≈çen (‰∏≠‰∏ñËçòÂúí, lit. \\"medieval Sh≈çen\\"). Note that these names and the distinction between the two are modern concepts, and were not used historically and cannot be found in the historical record. Before ritsury≈ç system The earliest antecedent of the sh≈çen are tatokoro or naritokoro (Áî∞Â∫Ñ); which is thought to be one of the etymologies of the term sh≈çen. Before the ritsury≈ç system or taika reform, land was divided up between powerful families historically called g≈çzoku (Ë±™Êóè) or influential Buddhist temples, and they placed facilities called yake (ÂÆÖ) in those lands in order to preside over agricultural management, armament, traffic, and trades. In early documents, the terms yake and tatokoro were used almost interchangeably to refer to those administrative facilities, and so tatokoro are thought to have had functions similar to yake. Before long, however, the meaning of tatokoro was extended to represent not only the originally indicated administrative facilities but also the cultivated land which they administrated. Land policies in the Nara period New policies of the central government during the Nara period, initially designed to encourage reclamation, played an important role in the development of sh≈çen. The land policy of the ritsury≈ç was called handen-sh≈´ju- sei (Áè≠Áî∞ÂèéÂèóÂà∂), and was similar to Chinese equal-field land system (ÂùáÁî∞Âà∂), but there was a difference in the treatment of reclaimed fields. If someone reclaimed wasteland in Japan at that time, the field would be dispossessed and he could not cultivate the field; while if someone reclaimed a field in China, he could cultivate the land providing that the field was smaller than legally prescribed dimensions. Therefore, there was no incentive to reclaim land and develop new fields, and little land was reclaimed although the population was steadily increasing. The shortage of fields thus became a social and economic problem. To solve this, in 723 the central government promulgated the law of sanze-isshin-h≈ç (‰∏â‰∏ñ‰∏ÄË∫´Ê≥ï), which promoted reclamation. This law allowed one to cultivate any field one reclaimed, and if certain conditions were satisfied, the fields reclaimed by one's parents or grandparents. Twenty years later, in 743 the central government promulgated a further law promoting reclamation, called konden-einen-shizai-h≈ç (Â¢æÁî∞Ê∞∏Âπ¥ÁßÅË≤°Ê≥ï) which provided for the succession of the right to cultivate reclaimed fields in perpetuity. This law resulted in massive reclamation by wealthy people, and this reclamation in turn had a significant impact on the development of sh≈çen. Shoki-sh≈çen One feature that distinguishes early or shoki-sh≈çen from medieval sh≈çen is their manner of formation. Most shoki-sh≈çen were established by a Buddhist temple or a central noble by obtaining ownership of either of two kinds of paddy fields: those that had existed prior to the temple's or noble's ownership; and those that were reclaimed under the order of the temple or the noble which ruled a sh≈çen. Sh≈çen composed primarily of newly reclaimed land characterized shoki sh≈çen, and accordingly shoki-sh≈çen are sometimes called kondenchi-kei-sh≈çen (Â¢æÁî∞Âú∞Á≥ªËçòÂúí, lit. 'estates of reclaimed fields.'). Another feature of shoki-sh≈çen is annual rental system of paddy fields. There were no permanent inhabitants of shoki- sh≈çen and the fields of shoki-sh≈çen did not have regular cultivators, so cultivation rights were rented out on a contract of a year to peasants who inhabited the neighborhood around the sh≈çen. Therefore, it was indispensable to recruit help of peasants, who did nearly all the work of cultivation, in order to ensure stable labor force for cultivation and reclamation of new fields. An owner of a shoki-sh≈çen often utilized the local government system of Daij≈ç-kan, kuni and k≈çri to meet this need; an owner of shoki-sh≈çen who usually had been assigned by the central government as a kokushi (ÂõΩÂè∏, a head or officer of kuni) appointed a local chief of the peasants to be a gunji (ÈÉ°Âè∏, a head or officer of k≈çri) to recruit and administer labor for the sh≈çen. Formation of Ch≈´sei-sh≈çen Medieval or ch≈´sei-sh≈çen are different from shoki-sh≈çen mainly in existence of sh≈çmin (ËçòÊ∞ë, peasants permanently residing on sh≈çen land) and in the power the owner of the sh≈çen had over the sh≈çmin. While shoki-sh≈çen did not have any sh≈çmin and the owner's rule of cultivators was weaker than that of the government, ch≈´sei-sh≈çen had sh≈çmin and most of the cultivators were sh≈çmin, and the sh≈çen owner's rule became more powerful than that of the government. The owner of a sh≈çen could expel peasants who were not obedient to him from the sh≈çen, and could promulgate his own penal codes for criminal offenses or treason in order to ensure this control over the sh≈çmin. That is to say sh≈çen owners, who originally cultivated influence with the government in the capital during the Nara period, came to discard the connection with the central government and to cultivate their power over local peasants. Another distinguishing feature of ch≈´sei-sh≈çen are their exemptions from some kinds of tax imposed by the central government. In the middle or the end of the Heian period there were two types of tax. One type of tax was corvee labor under the supervision of kuni, and the other was a tax on farm products (about three percent of rice or other farm products). To evade these taxes, peasants wanted to be ruled and protected by the sh≈çen owners, which was usually a politically influential Buddhist temple, Shinto shrine or court noble. To achieve this protection by the sh≈çen owners, peasants donated the nominal land ownership of the fields they cultivated to sh≈çen owners. These fields, nominally donated to the ownership of a sh≈çen were historically called . Then the sh≈çen owners who received \\"donated lands\\" from the sh≈çmin peasant populace negotiated with the kokushi or directly with the central government and achieved tax exempt status. Most ch≈´sei-sh≈çen gathered vast amounts fields through the process of receiving donated lands from peasants as kishinchi. In this sense, ch≈´sei-sh≈çen is sometimes called kishinchi-kei-sh≈çen (ÂØÑÈÄ≤Âú∞Á≥ªËçòÂúí, lit. \\"estates of donated fields\\"). Meanwhile, there also appeared sh≈çen which gathered territory by depriving peasants of land ownership. In some cases, sh≈çen owners would demand tribute from peasants cultivating neighboring fields and if the peasants could not pay that tribute, the sh≈çen confiscated the fields. In other cases, a peasant could not repay the rent for cultivation rights of sh≈çen land, and the sh≈çen owner who was the cultivator's creditor foreclosed on the cultivator's land rights as substitution of the credit, in which case the peasant became bound to the sh≈çen as a sh≈çmin, rather than a tenant cultivator. This kind of sh≈çen is sometimes called konden-sh≈´seki-sh≈çen (Â¢æÁî∞ÈõÜÁ©çËçòÂúí, lit, \\"estates of accumulated fields\\"). There were several kinds of ch≈´sei-sh≈çen, and each kind of sh≈çen had particular process of achieving exemption from tax: =Kansh≈çfu-sh≈ç= is sh≈çen where exemption from so (Áßü, a kind of tax, three percent of total harvest of rice) was allowed in official procedures. In the ritsury≈ç system, powerful Shinto shrines and Buddhist temples had the right to receive rice as support from the central government. Each shrines or temples were allotted particular fields to, and the rice was levied as so from peasants cultivating the allotted fields. In the 8th century in some sh≈çen, semi-permanent land ownership of the fields and exemption from so in the fields was permitted by Daij≈ç-kan, which administered exemption of tax, and the notified the owner of the fields about the permission using the document called the or \\"charter\\". Later the permission by Daij≈ç-kan not for temples or shrines but for powerful noble was gradually increased. =Kokumen-sh≈ç= is sh≈çen allowed exemption from so or other tribute in bempo or binho (‰æøË£ú) system. At that time kuni had an obligation to pay to sh≈çen owner the benefits the amount of which was determined as to his dignity by the central government. Bempo system is a means usually used when kuni could not prepare the benefits since the taxation from peasants cultivating public fields did not function well; kuni transferred sh≈çen owner its right of taxation from fields the dimensions of which was corresponding to the amount of the benefits. This field was usually selected, according to sh≈çen owner's request, from fields which sh≈çen owner had received from peasants as kishinchi, and this means practical exemption from tax. This system was not admitted by the central government and a contract of bempo became invalid when the term of tenure of the kokushi who contracted was over. However, in most case the new kokushi could not refuse sh≈çen owner's request of continuation of a contract because they felt sorry for accumulated debt of the delinquent benefits, which had not paid while bempo was performed as substitution of payment. Consequently, these fields were established as an area exempt from so or other tribute imposed by the central government. In the 10th and 11th century kokumen-sh≈ç was rapidly increased, and in 1040 the central government was not able to continue ignoring kokumen-sh≈ç and finally explicitly prohibited kuni 's new permission of exemption of tax. This ordinance is now called ch≈çky≈´-sh≈çen-seiri-rei (\\"The Order for Disposal of Sh≈çen in Ch≈çky≈´ Era\\" in Japanese). =Rinjiz≈çyaku-menjo-sh≈çen= is a general term of variant labor imposed to peasants as tax by the government from the middle to the end of the Heian period, and is sh≈çen allowed exemption of rinjiz≈çyaku. There were two main processes of formation of rinjiz≈çyaku-menjo-sh≈çen. One was the process of sh≈çen owner's negotiation with kokushi; sh≈çen owner abandoned the right of using a part of labor force of rinjiz≈çyaku and instead achieved exemption from rinjiz≈çyaku of peasants living in particular area. The other is the process of bempo system. However, repeated exemption of rinjiz≈çyaku resulted in the shortage of kishinchi of some sh≈çen owners which was remained not exempt from rinjiz≈çyaku. While practicing bempo, if all the kishinchi of the sh≈çen owner was exempt from rinjiz≈çyaku, sh≈çen owner was provided with the right of using labor force of particular public fields. This resulted in absorption of public fields into sh≈çen territory, and in the 11th century new exemption from rinjiz≈çyaku of fields which had neither exemption of so nor that of other tributes was prohibited. Sh≈çen in the Muromachi period In the aftermath of the ≈ånin War, the power of the sh≈çen disappeared as new daimy≈ç came in control of the court. These daimyo dissolved or destroyed the sh≈çen, preferring to keep the peasants under their direct control, and effectively making them serfs in return for their protection.

Although he was most associated with football, he covered a number of other sports for ITV, notably golf. Early life Montford was raised in Greenock and was a lifelong supporter of local football club Greenock Morton. Journalism Montford worked as both a print journalist and radio broadcaster before joining Scottish Television in August 1957 as a continuity announcer. He was then chosen to present STV's new sports programme, Scotsport (originally Sports Desk), where he remained as anchorman for 32 years. In all, he hosted over 2,000 editions of the programme. During his time on Scotsport, Montford became famous for his trademark checkered pattern sports jackets, and some classic lines of football commentary, including What a Stramash! and Disaster for Scotland!https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=9&v;=OyQUI79WSW4&feature;=emb_titlequote= ...and that's disaster, absolute disaster for Scotland! He also presented the Scottish version of World of Sport which was broadcast under the Scotsport banner. During the 1978 FIFA World Cup, a technical fault with the feed from Argentina prevented ITV from broadcasting Hugh Johns' commentary on the Scotland-Peru game, so Montford's commentary, originally only intended for Scottish viewers, was used on the entire network (the same fault affected the BBC in reverse, with Scottish viewers having to listen to David Coleman instead of Archie MacPherson). Montford's last Scotsport programme was live coverage of the 1989 Scottish Cup Final. After retiring from television, Montford continued to comment on Scottish football, both in the national press and in the matchday programme at Morton. In 1990, he narrated the film documentary Scotland: The World Cup Story. In late 2010, Montford served as an occasional commentator on the Greenock Morton webcast. In May 2010, Montford received the SPFA Special Merit award for his services to football broadcasting and journalism alongside fellow broadcaster Archie Macpherson. He died aged 85 on 26 November 2014. Other positions He served as a director of Greenock Morton for several years under the chairmanship of his close friend Douglas Rae. After stepping down as a director, Montford continued his affiliation with the club as an Honorary Vice-President. In 1974, Montford was elected as Rector of the University of Glasgow, the first sports journalist to receive the honour. He remained in the position until 1977. Montford wrote a column for Scottish golf magazine, Bunkered. His recollections of some of golf's greatest players, moments, and tournaments were popular with the magazine's readers and he was the title's longest-serving regular contributor.

He is sometimes confused with Ed \\"Strangler\\" Lewis, a later six-time World Heavyweight Champion also credited with first using the hold, whose moniker is attributed to Lewis's after a reporter noted a resemblance between the two. Life and wrestling career Born in Ridgeway, Wisconsin, Lewis began wrestling professionally winning a 64-man tournament in Montana in May 1882. He returned to Wisconsin and defeated Ben Knight for the Wisconsin Heavyweight Championship in a Mineral Point match on March 20, 1883. Moving to Madison in 1885, he later defeated several international wrestlers, including Andre Christol, Tom Cannon, and Matsuda Sorakichi. Defeating Joe Acton in Chicago, Illinois, for the American Catch-as-Catch-can Championship on March 14, 1887, he later unified the World Catch-as-Catch-can and American Greco-Roman Heavyweight Championship in a best-of-five match against Ernest Roeber in New Orleans, Louisiana on March 3, 1893 (he also had defeated him for the \\"Collar and Elbow Championship\\" on May 18, 1890). After defending the title for over two years, Lewis lost the American Heavyweight Championship to Martin Burns, whom he had previously defeated in his debut match in 1886.

He later reported from many parts of the world and was diplomatic correspondent for four years, before becoming one of its lead anchors during the late 1960s and 1970s, often working alongside Andrew Gardner, Leonard Parkin, Sandy Gall and, mostly late in his tenure, Alastair Burnet. His partnership with Anna Ford on News at Ten was popular with viewers in the late 1970s. As Ford has since revealed, this rapport could prove distressing: on one occasion Bosanquet, having somehow discovered the birth-date of Ford's mother, wished her a \\"happy birthday\\" at the end of the broadcast, unaware that she had died some time previously.Bill Hagerty \\"Anna Ford: Try a little tenderness\\" , British Journalism Review 18:3, 2007, p.7-16 Ford recalled in 2007: \\"Reggie was a dear.

At times he could appear puzzled by unfamiliar foreign names while his trademark slurred delivery fed contemporary suspicions that he was a heavy drinker.Evening Standard, 15 May 2000 Such rumours became raw material for wags and comedy writers: Bosanquet acquired such nicknames as \\"Reginald Beaujolais\\", \\"Reginald Boozalot\\" and \\"Reginald Boozatten\\". Later career Bosanquet was elected Rector of the University of Glasgow in 1980, serving until 1984. He was a controversial choice; shortly after his election he hit the headlines when he turned up at an official reception late and drunk, and insulted various guests, including the Lord Provost of Glasgow (and his eventual successor as Rector) Michael Kelly. In 1980, Bosanquet \\"sang\\" (or, more accurately, narrated the lyrics in the style of a newscast) on the disco single \\"Dance with Me\\".

Jackson served as a Conservative Member of Parliament (MP) for Peterborough from 2005 to 2017. After being ousted by Labour's Fiona Onasanya at the 2017 general election, he served as Chief of Staff, and Special Adviser to David Davis, Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, until July 2018 when Davis resigned his position. Early life Jackson was born in Woolwich and brought up in south-east London. He was educated at the London Nautical School in Lambeth, and Chatham House Grammar School in Ramsgate, Kent, followed by Royal Holloway, University of London, where he was awarded a BA (Hons) degree in Economics & Public Administration, in 1988.Election highs for Royal Holloway alumni , www.rhul.ac.uk Jackson was elected President of the University of London Union for the 1988‚Äì89 academic year. During his tenure as president, he faced a no-confidence motion in January 1989, and resigned before he was required to leave office. Political career Jackson served on Ealing Borough Council in west London from 1990 to 1998, during which time he was Conservative Party spokesman on planning and housing. He is Vice-President of the Local Government Association. Jackson unsuccessfully contested the parliamentary constituency of Brent South at the 1997 general election. He was then selected as the Conservative candidate for the Peterborough seat in October 2000, and fought the 2001 general election, where he reduced the Labour Party's majority in the constituency from 7,323 votes to 2,854 votes, but lost to the incumbent Labour MP Helen Brinton. Jackson was re-adopted as the Conservative candidate for Peterborough in August 2002, and defeated Brinton at the 2005 general election to become the MP. In the 2010 general election, held on 6 May, Jackson increased his majority to 4,861 votes over the Labour candidate, Ed Murphy; he was appointed the following month as Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Owen Paterson, the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, but resigned as PPS on 24 October 2011, after voting against a three-line whip on an EU referendum. After Theresa May's selection as the new Conservative Prime Minister, following David Cameron's resignation, Stewart Jackson was appointed as Parliamentary Private Secretary to David Davis, the Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, in July 2016. Following the loss of his seat at the 2017 general election, Jackson was appointed Special Advisor and Chief of Staff to the Secretary of State at the Department for Exiting the European Union. Conservative Voice Together with other MPs on the Conservative right wing, such as Nadine Dorries, Jackson assisted in establishing the Conservative Voice parliamentary grouping led by David Davis (David Cameron's principal opponent in the contest to win the leadership of the Conservative Party) and Liam Fox (former Secretary of State for Defence). In explaining his decision to join the new right-wing grouping, Jackson said that he hoped it could \\"get Cameron back on election-winning ground\\" and away from the \\"current social liberal mush\\". He stated that he would vote against the government's legislation to introduce same-sex marriage, and accused his party leader of being \\"arrogant\\" for pressing ahead with it. Policy positions In 2014, Jackson, along with six other Conservative Party MPs, voted against the Equal Pay (Transparency) Bill, which would have required all companies with more than 250 employees to declare the gap in pay between the average male and average female salaries. Jackson opposed the 2013 bill to allow gay marriage. In March 2015, he told a constituent: \\"The feeling's fully mutual. Please feel free to never bother me again\\" after she requested to be removed from his campaign mailing list because she disagreed with his position on the act. Use of social media In March 2015, Jackson attracted media attention for his response to a constituent which was subsequently circulated on social media. Jackson's email told the constituent ‚ÄúThe feeling‚Äôs fully mutual. Please feel free to never bother me again‚Äù after she requested to be removed from his campaign mailing list because she disagreed with his opposition to the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013. On 26 June 2016, Rupert Myers, a political correspondent for The Times, tweeted about the outcome of the Referendum of the United Kingdom's membership of the European Union \\"I can't get over the fact that the winning side lied about a whole bunch of stuff & yet expect us to live cheerfully with the result\\". Stewart Jackson replied from his verified Twitter account \\"Suck it up whiner...\\". Jackson attracted attention in October 2016, when he used Twitter to state that patriots should not subscribe to The Economist, a liberal, free-market magazine, because of its arguments about the problems leaving the EU would entail. After losing his seat in 2017, Jackson contacted a former constituent who had been critical of him on Facebook to call him a \\"thick chav\\", and also wrote: \\"If you print any shit about me on Facebook in the future you will regret it.\\" In October 2018, Jackson, who is known for his pro-Brexit views, was again criticised after tweeting: \\"What a pathetic cretin\\" in response to a picture of an ill child with a duvet depicting the European Union flag. The child was recovering from an operation at the Great Ormond Street Hospital. Jackson subsequently said, after deleting the initial tweet, that he was referring to the child's stepfather rather than the child himself. The Science Minister, Sam Gyimah, criticised the tweet, saying: \\"No one can take credibly or seriously people who use that language.\\" Heidi Allen, another Conservative MP, responded by describing Jackson as \\"a pathetic, unkind and nasty man.\\" Parliamentary expenses Articles in the Daily Telegraph reported that Jackson had claimed more than ¬£66,000 in three financial years for housing costs in his constituency: on 11 May 2009 the newspaper reported that he had claimed ¬£11,000 in professional, legal and mortgage fees on buying a new constituency home. However, Jackson argued that there were legitimate 'one-off costs' relating to the purchasing of a home base in the constituency after his election as an MP, and claimed that until the house was purchased, he, his wife and infant daughter were renting one bedroomed accommodation in the constituency. On 12 May 2009, both BBC Newsnight, and a second article published by The Daily Telegraph reported that Jackson had claimed ¬£55,000 on housing costs for the constituency house, bringing the total sum to over ¬£66,000. When asked about how MPs should be housed in their constituencies, Jackson was quoted in The Daily Telegraph as saying that any ban on the second home allowance would be \\"draconian and unfair\\". In May 2013, the Independent Parliamentary Standards Authority (IPSA) issued a High Court action in an attempt to recover ¬£54,000 in alleged notional Capital Gains arising from Jackson's Peterborough home. The case was settled when a Tomlin Order was sealed in the High Court in February 2014, permanently staying the civil proceedings which had allegedly cost IPSA over ¬£20,000 in legal fees. Wikipedia biography IP addresses from inside the Houses of Parliament have often edited the Wikipedia biographies of politicians including Jackson in an attempt to remove details on the parliamentary expenses scandal, and attempts have been made to remove details of Jackson's interaction with a lesbian constituent. Ben Riley-Smith, a correspondent for The Daily Telegraph, argues that it is impossible to prove that changes are made by staff of any particular MP. Citizen's arrest attempt In July 2012, Jackson attempted to tackle a vandal in Peterborough. Jackson, who was shopping with his wife and daughter, tried to perform a citizen's arrest after seeing a bus shelter being vandalised. The vandal got away, but only after kicking the MP. Cambridgeshire Constabulary subsequently arrested a twenty-year-old man in connection with the incident who was later found guilty of assault and criminal damage at Peterborough Magistrates Court.

When a boat is rowed, the rowlock acts as a fulcrum, and, in doing so, the propulsive force that the rower exerts on the water with the oar is transferred to the boat by the thrust force exerted on the rowlock. On ordinary rowing craft, the rowlocks are attached to the gunwales. In the sport of rowing, the rowlocks are attached to outriggers (often just called \\"riggers\\"), which project from the boat and provide greater leverage. In sport rowing, the rowlocks are normally U-shaped and attached to a vertical pin which allows the rowlock to pivot around the pin during the rowing stroke. They additionally have a locking mechanism (properly known as \\"the gate\\") across the top of the \\"U\\" to prevent the oar from unintentionally popping out of the rowlock. Originally, rowlocks were two wooden posts or thole pins that the shaft of the oar nestled between. Single thole pins may be used when the oars have holes cut into the loom, which then sits over/around the thole pin.Captain Dennis Robinson FNI, Master Mariner Sport rowing In sport rowing oarlocks were originally brass or bronze and open (no gate). With the advent of modern materials oarlocks are now injection moulded plastic and precision made to minimize play (slop) between the oar collar and the oarlock. The most recent sport racing oarlocks have a spring loaded feature to keeps the oar collar firmly against the pin at all times.

The common name of some species is globeflower or globe flower. Native to the cool temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere, with the greatest diversity of species in Asia, Trollius usually grow in heavy, wet clay soils. Description They are mostly herbaceous, fibrous rooted perennials with bright yellow, orange or lilac coloured flowers. The name \\"globe flower\\" refers to the petals of T. europaeus and T. √ó cultorum which are curved over the top of the flower, forming a globe. But T. pumilus has flatter flowers, and T. chinensis has open flowers with prominent stamens. Ecology All species of Trollius are poisonous to cattle and other livestock when fresh, but their acrid taste means they are usually left uneaten. They are, however, used as food plants by the larvae of some Lepidoptera species including silver-ground carpet. Cultivation Some species are popular ornamental flowers in horticulture, with several cultivars selected for large and brightly coloured flowers. The hybrid T. √ó cultorum in particular is a source of several garden cultivars, including 'Superbus', which has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.

Description  The area, located in the municipalities of Bad Honnef and K√∂nigswinter, consists of more than 40 hills. The hills are of ancient volcanic origin and came into being between 28 and 15 million years ago. Much of the territory covered by Sieben Hills belongs to the Sieben Hills Nature Park (Naturpark Siebengebirge), which is under environmental protection. The highest peak is the √ñlberg at 460 metres above sea level. It is a popular tourist destination for hiking, because of its natural environment.

Taylor (2009). Retrieved 10 Feb 2015. where sieben is modern German for \\"seven\\" and a Gebirge is a hill range, alternative derivations for the name have been suggested. Three theories exist: # The oldest nameMoller, 1590 was not Siebengebirge, but Sieben Berge (septem montes, seven hills). Depending on the viewpoint near the river Rhine, one notices almost exactly seven hills, which are not always the same and not even the highest. Also, the number seven used to denote an arbitrary amount of items, was connected to magic and thus had a highly symbolic meaning. This makes it an obvious name for an area that was said to be sinister and impenetrable before the 19th century. # The word sieben is derived from the word siefen which, in turn comes from the Middle Low German word s√Æpe \\"wet depression\\" or \\"little stream, brook\\", the verb s√Æpen means \\"trickle, drip\\".See the entry siepen in the Deutsches W√∂rterbuch. # The name Siebengebirge emerged from the word Siedengebirge which indicated the presence of soap boilers (\\"Seifensieder\\"), who were banned from the valleys because boiling soap smelled so bad.

Wippleman began his career working in professional wrestling promotions in the Southern United States, especially Memphis. In the 1990s, he debuted in the World Wrestling Federation (WWF), where he managed wrestlers such as Sid Justice, Kamala, Giant Gonzalez and Bertha Faye. In 2000, he became the first and only man to win the WWF Women's Championship. Wippleman works backstage in WWE (formerly the WWF) and occasionally manages in the Memphis area as Downtown Bruno. In 2020, Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson named Lauer as the \\"GOAT\\" (greatest of all time) for assisting Johnson early in his career and providing him a place to stay. Professional wrestling career=Early career In 1979, Lauer attended an independent wrestling show at a circus in Pennsylvania. In exchange for helping to tear down the ring after the show, he was given free admission. He later joined the company and toured Ohio. During this time, The Royal Kangaroos' Jonathan Boyd became his mentor. Back in Pennsylvania, Geeto Mongol trained Lauer and gave him the ring name Dr. Lennerd Spazzinsky. He then moved to Memphis, where he performed under the name Downtown Bruno. In 1986, he became the most prominent villainous manager in Memphis. In addition, wrestlers like Jerry Lawler and Sid Eudy helped his career. He continued to work in the Southern promotions for the rest of the late 1980s. In September 1989, he won the Continental Wrestling Federation's Southeastern United States Junior Heavyweight Championship and held it until the promotion closed in November. It was in Continental in 1987 that he first teamed with Eudy, while Eudy was under a mask as an incarnation of Lord Humongous. World Wrestling Federation/EntertainmentManager= Harvey Wippleman as a manager in 1994 In 1991, Sid Eudy helped bring Lauer to the World Wrestling Federation (WWF). He debuted as Harvey Wippleman, a Pee-Wee Herman-like character wearing a pin-striped suit with slacks cut at his shins, a red bow-tie, and a flat cap. He first managed Big Bully Busick. When Busick left the company and Slick turned face, Wippleman took over managing The Warlord. However, Wippleman's greatest acquisition was his real-life friend, Sid Justice. When Sid turned heel, working on a program with Hulk Hogan leading to Wrestlemania, Wippleman became Sid Justice's manager and became \\"Dr. Harvey Wippleman\\". Wippleman would begin carrying a doctor's bag to the ring containing medical equipment. After Sid's matches against jobbers, Wippleman would retrieve a stethoscope from his bag and listen to the defeated wrestler's hearts. After Sid left the company, Wippleman managed Kamala, who was feuding with The Undertaker. After Kamala was defeated by Undertaker in a Coffin match at Survivor Series in 1992, Kamala left Wippleman and Reverend Slick became his new manager. Afterwards, Wippleman dropped the Dr. gimmick. He continued to feud with the Undertaker and brought a new wrestler to the WWF, the nearly eight-foot-tall Giant Gonz√°lez. The feud culminated in a Rest in Peace match at SummerSlam, which Undertaker won. During this period, Wippleman also briefly managed Mr. Hughes, who left the WWF after a few months. Wippleman was also the manager of Adam Bomb from October 1993 until June 1994, when Bomb turned face, and feuded with Kwang, who was also being managed by Wippleman. Wippleman also managed Well Dunn, who faced the Rock 'n' Roll Express in the RnR's WWF debut on October 10, 1993. Since debuting in the WWF, Wippleman was always at odds with ring announcer Howard Finkel, whom Wippleman believed introduced him in a condescending manner. At WrestleMania X, Wippleman tore up Finkel's tuxedo, and Finkel shoved him to the mat. The feud culminated in a tuxedo match on the January 9, 1995 edition of Monday Night RAW, which Finkel won. Wippleman's next high-profile storyline was later in 1995, when he managed his on-screen girlfriend Bertha Faye. Faye, with Wippleman in her corner, won the WWF Women's Championship by defeating Alundra Blayze at SummerSlam 1995. After losing the WWF Women's Championship in late 1995, Faye was dropped from the WWF roster and Wippleman disappeared from television. According to Lauer, he and Bertha didn't get along. =Referee and road agent= By spring 1996, Wippleman began making appearances on WWF Superstars, critiquing the referees during the matches in preparation to make a full report to WWF President Gorilla Monsoon about the apparent lack of consistency amongst the officials. Monsoon rewarded Wippleman for his efforts by making him an official referee. One of Wippleman's last appearances as a regular WWF referee during this time came on the March 10, 1997 episode of Raw when Chyna gorilla pressed him into a group of referees. On the May 19, 1997 episode of Raw Wippleman appeared in a backstage segment with Stone Cold Steve Austin telling Wippleman that he was going to be his tag team partner with Wippleman responding that he was scared. Wippleman also appeared as \\"Handsome Harvey,\\" introducing D-Generation-X on Raw on November 24, 1997. This was to make fun of Rick Rude. Rude had been a member of DX and had just left the company a week earlier to go to WCW. This resulted in Rude being on both Raw and WCW Monday Nitro on the same night. (At the time, Raw was taped every other week while Nitro was live every week). In June 1999, after another period of absence from television broadcasts, Wippleman resurfaced on the June 13 episode of Sunday Night Heat as a referee in a match between then-Intercontinental Champion Jeff Jarrett and Test. Test won the match after outside interference, thus being named the new champion, but he was persuaded by Jarrett's valet Debra to overturn the result and return the belt. He also served as a scab official during the WWF referee strike in September 1999, including at the Unforgiven PPV, again refereeing a match with Jarrett defending the Intercontinental title against Chyna. On January 31, 2000, Wippleman won the WWF Women's Championship from The Kat while he was in a disguise and used the name \\"Hervina\\" in a \\"Lumberjill Snow Bunny\\" match, which took place in a snow-filled pool surrounded by female wrestlers who kept the competitors from leaving the pool. The win made him the first male to hold the Women's Championship. He lost the title the following day (but broadcast on February 3) to Jacqueline in a match that lasted under a minute, thus ending the shortest reign in the title's history. Through the remainder of 2000, Wippleman appeared in backstage and non-match segments of the WWF's television programming, including a segment on the April 23, 2000 episode of Sunday Night Heat where he appeared dressed up as a rabbit as part of a segment with Al Snow and Steve Blackman. At WrestleMania X-Seven on April 1, 2001, Wippleman managed Kamala during the gimmick battle royal. At the point the Invasion storyline began in 2001, he had disappeared from WWF programming, and was then working as a road agent for the company. On November 15, 2010, for WWE's old school episode of Raw, Wippleman returned to WWE, managing the Brooklyn Brawler in a squash loss to Ezekiel Jackson. As of 2011, Lauer was working with the WWE in backstage roles at television and pay-per- view events. In an interview with Jim Korderas, Lauer described his role as \\"concierge\\", taking care of details such as food, rental cars and the like. On January 22, 2018, Harvey made a brief backstage appearance during Raw 25 Years. Personal life Lauer grew up, in Walls, Mississippi, near Memphis. According to Lauer, he spent his teenage years \\"sprawling on car hoods, smoking cigarettes, and drinking beer with no particular ambition in mind\\". His drinking eventually caused Lauer to serve jail time in Memphis. In 1994, Lauer was in a car accident with Joey Marella, which claimed Marella's life and injured Lauer. The crash occurred as a result of Marella falling asleep at the wheel while driving on the way to Newark. Marella was not wearing his seat belt, but Lauer‚Äìthe passenger‚Äìwas wearing his. Because of the severity of his injuries, however, Lauer incurred approximately $10,000 in medical expenses. He wrote an autobiography Wrestling with the Truth, which was released in 2008. Lauer is Roman Catholic.

In 1954 he received the Carden Fellowship from the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria; while he officially retired in 1996, he continued working and held his fellowship until his retirement in December 2014. Education, research and career Metcalf studied medicine at the University of Sydney, and had his first experience of medical research in the laboratory of Professor Patrick de Burgh. In 1954 Metcalf was awarded a Carden Fellowship from the Anti-Cancer Council of Victoria at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. There he initially studied virology and leukemia, later transitioning to hematology. Metcalf's pioneering research revealed the control of blood cell formation and the role of hematopoietic cytokines. In the 1960s he developed techniques to culture blood cells, which led to the discovery of colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), including macrophage colony-stimulating factor, granulocyte colony- stimulating factor and granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor. CSFs are cytokines that control white blood cell formation and are responsible for resistance to infection. CSFs are now widely used to boost the immune system for patients receiving chemotherapy, and to mobilise blood stem cells for transplants. Awards and honours In the Australia Day Honours of 1976, he was named an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO).It's an Honour: AO In the Queen's Birthday Honours of 1993, he was promoted to Companion of the Order (AC).It's an Honour: AC Metcalf has been awarded many international prizes including * the 1986 Royal Society Wellcome Prize (now the GlaxoSmithKline Prize), * the 1987 Bristol-Myers Award for Distinguished Achievement in Cancer Research (jointly with Leo Sachs), * the 1988 Robert Koch Prize, * the 1988 Armand Hammer Prize for Cancer Research, * the 1989 General Motors Cancer Foundation Sloan Prize, * the 1993 Lasker-DeBakey Clinical Medical Research Award, * the 1993 Louisa Gross Horwitz Prize from Columbia University, * the 1994 Jessie Stevenson Kovalenko Medal from the United States National Academy of Sciences, * the 1994 Gairdner Foundation International Award, * the 1995 Royal Society Royal Medal and, * in 1997, a Lifetime Achievement Award from the American Association for Cancer Research.

The chief mate is customarily a watchstander and is in charge of the ship's cargo and deck crew.Chief Mate Requirements The actual title used will vary by ship's employment, by type of ship, by nationality, and by trade: for instance, chief mate is not usually used in the Commonwealth, although chief officer and first mate are; on passenger ships, the first officer may be a separate position from that of the chief officer that is junior to the latter. The chief mate answers to the captain for the safety and security of the ship. Responsibilities include the crew's welfare and training in areas such as safety, firefighting, search and rescue. Epaulettes often worn by the chief officer on merchant ships (similar to those worn by a commander) Senior on board Operations Manager The Chief Mate, who is the second in command of the vessel, is often equated, in corporate terms, to a senior manager for the operations on board, as the Mate is in charge of a number of departmental functions. In modern cargo vessels, the Mate holds appointments like Head of Deck Department, Head of Cargo/ Stowage Operations, Head of Safety/ Fire Fighting, Head of On-Board Security (Ship Security Officer), Head of Environment and Quality, and so forth. Cargo Officer As cargo officer, a chief mate oversees the loading, stowage, securing and unloading of cargoes. Moreover, the chief mate is accountable for the care of cargo during the voyage. This includes a general responsibility for the ship's stability and special care for cargoes that are dangerous, hazardous or harmful. Even under the best of conditions, a ship is balanced precariously upon the water and is subject to a number of forces, such as wind, swells, and storms, which could capsize it. The cargo officer uses tools like ballasting and load balancing to optimize the ship's performance for the expected type of environment. Watchstanding Traditionally, the chief mate stands a \\"4-8\\" watch: from 4 AM until 8 AM and 4 PM until 8 PM.,Turpin and McEwin, 1980:1-21. in port and at sea, the chief mate is responsible to the captain for keeping the ship, crew, and cargo safe. On watch, the mate must enforce all applicable regulations, such as the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea and pollution regulations. In port, the watch focuses on duties such as cargo operations, fire and security watches, monitoring communications and the anchor or mooring lines. IMO regulations require the officer be fluent in English. This is required for a number of reasons, such as ability to use nautical charts and nautical publications, to understand weather and safety messages, communicate with other ships and coast stations, and to be able to work with a multi-lingual crew. Sea watch At sea, the mate on watch has three fundamental duties: navigate the ship, safely avoid traffic, and respond to any emergencies that may arise. Mates generally stand watch with able seamen who act as helmsman and lookout. The helmsman executes turns and the lookout reports dangers such as approaching ships. These roles are often combined to a single helmsman/lookout and, under some circumstances, are eliminated completely. The ability to smartly handle a ship is key to safe watchstanding. A ship's draught, trim, speed and under-keel clearance all affect its turning radius and stopping distance. Other factors include the effects of wind and current, squat, shallow water and similar effects. Shiphandling is key when the need arises to rescue a man overboard, to anchor, or to moor the ship. The officer must also be able to transmit and receive signals by Morse light and to use the International Code of Signals. Navigation The conditions for navigating a ship can often be challenging. Celestial, terrestrial, electronic, and coastal navigation techniques are used to fix a ship's position on a navigational chart. The officer directs the helmsman to keep to track, accounting for effects of winds, tides, currents and estimated speed. The officer uses supplemental information from nautical publications, such as Sailing Directions, tide tables, Notices to Mariners, and radio navigational warnings to keep the ship clear of danger in transit. Safety demands the mate be able to quickly solve steering control problems and to calibrate the system for optimum performance. Since magnetic and gyrocompasses show the course to steer, the officer must be able to determine and correct for compass errors. Weather's profound effect on ships requires the officer be able to interpret and apply meteorological information from all available sources. This requires expertise in weather systems, reporting procedures and recording systems. Traffic management The International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea are a cornerstone of safe watchkeeping. Safety requires that one live these rules and follows the principles of safe watchkeeping. Maximizing bridge teamwork, including the practice of Bridge Resource Management, is an emerging focus in watchkeeping. The main purpose for Radar and Automatic Radar Plotting Aids (ARPA) on a ship's bridge is to move safely among other vessels. These instruments help to accurately judge information about prominent objects in the vicinity, such as: * range, bearing, course and speed * time and distance of closest point of approach * course and speed changes These factors help the officer apply the COLREGS to safely maneuver in the vicinity of obstructions and other ships. Unfortunately, radar has a number of limitations, and ARPA inherits those limitations and adds a number of its own. Factors such as rain, high seas, and dense clouds can prevent radar from detecting other vessels. Further, dense traffic and course and speed changes can confuse ARPA units. Finally, human errors such as inaccurate speed inputs and confusion between true and relative vectors add to the limitations of the radar/ARPA suite. Under the best conditions, the radar operator must be able to optimize system settings and detect divergences between an ARPA system and actual conditions. Information obtained from radar and ARPA must be treated with scrutiny: over reliance on these systems has sunk ships. The officer must understand system performance, limitations and accuracy, tracking capabilities and limitations, and processing delays, and the use of operational warnings and system tests. Emergencies Emergencies can happen at any time. The officer must be equipped to safeguard passengers and crew. The officer must be able to take initial action after a collision or a grounding. Responsibilities include performing damage assessment and control, understanding the procedures for rescuing persons from the sea, assisting ships in distress, and responding to any emergency which may arise in port. The Chief Mate is in charge of the firefighting and damage control teams. He is scene leader and reports via radio to the Captain who is in command and coordinates the larger response from the bridge. The officer must understand distress signals and know the IMO Merchant Ship Search and Rescue Manual. Controlling ship operations Understanding ship's stability, trim, stress, and the basics of ship's construction is a key to keeping a ship seaworthy. The mate must know what to do in cases of flooding and loss of buoyancy. Fire is also a constant concern. Knowing the classes and chemistry of fire, fire-fighting appliances, and systems prepares the officer to act fast in case of fire. An officer must be expert in the use of survival craft and rescue boats. Expertise includes the vessels' launching appliances and arrangements, and their equipment including radio life-saving appliances, satellite EPIRBs, SARTs, immersion suits and thermal protective aids. It's important to be expert in the techniques for survival at sea techniques in case it's necessary to abandon ship. Officers are trained to perform medical tasks, and follow instructions given by radio or obtained from guides. This training includes what to do in case of common shipboard accidents and illnesses. Licensing=United Kingdom It is usual for a chief/first officer to hold a master's certificate so that he can take over from the master if necessary. In the same way, a second officer usually holds a chief officer's certificate. United States A chief mate must have a number of qualifications, including a license. To become a chief mate (unlimited) in the United States, one must first accumulate at least 365 days of service while holding a second mate's license. Then, the candidate must attend approximately 13 weeks of classes or complete the assessments from NMC Policy Letter 04-02 and pass a series of examinations given by the United States Coast Guard. Similarly, one must have worked as a third mate for 365 days to have become a second mate. There are many special cases in license upgrades at the individual level, as licensing regulations change from time to time. A sizable portion of mates still working received their licenses before current laws went into effect. There are two methods to attain an unlimited third mate's license in the United States: to attend a specialized training institution, or to accumulate \\"sea time\\" and take a series of training classes and examinations. Training institutions that can lead to a third mate's license include the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy (deck curriculum), the U.S. Coast Guard Academy and U.S. Naval Academy with qualification as an underway officer in charge of a navigational watch, any of the state maritime colleges, the Great Lakes Maritime Academy, or a three-year apprentice mate training program approved by the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard. A seaman may start the process of attaining a license after three years of service in the deck department on ocean steam or motor vessels, at least six months of which as able seaman, boatswain, or quartermaster. Then the seaman takes required training courses, and completes on-board assessments. Finally, the mariner can apply to the United States Coast Guard for a Third Mate's license. A master of 1,600 ton vessels can, under certain circumstances, begin the application process for an unlimited third mate's license. If approved the applicant must then successfully pass a comprehensive license examination before being issued the license. Hawsepiper is an informal maritime industry term used to refer to an officer who began his or her career as an unlicensed merchant seaman and did not attend a traditional maritime college/academy to earn the officer license. A ship's hawsepipe is the pipe passing through the bow section of a ship that the anchor chain passes through. Hawsepiper refers to climbing up the hawsepipe, a nautical metaphor for climbing up the ship's rank structure. Hawsepiper is considered a positive term when said respectfully. Many hawsepipers are proud of their background and use the term to describe themselves. Several merchant seamen's unions offer their membership the required training to for career advancement. Similarly, some employers offer financial assistance to pay for the training for their employees. Otherwise, the mariner is responsible for the cost of the required training. Since the requirements of STCW '95 have been enacted, there have been complaints that the hawsepiper progression path has been made too difficult because of the cost in time and money to meet formal classroom training requirements. These critics assert that the newer requirements will eventually lead to a shortage of qualified mariners, especially in places like the United States.

Chambers, 463 U.S. 783 (1983), was a landmark court case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that government funding for chaplains was constitutional because of the \\"unique history\\" of the United States.. Three days before the ratification of the First Amendment in 1791, containing the Establishment clause, the federal legislature authorized hiring a chaplain for opening sessions with prayer. Background Nebraska state senator Ernie Chambers sued in federal court claiming that the legislature's practice of opening sessions with a prayer offered by a state-supported chaplain was in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment. The district court held that the prayer did not violate the Constitution, but that state support for the chaplain did. The 8th Circuit Court of Appeals held that both practices violated the Constitution. Question before the Court Does paying a chaplain for religious services using taxpayer dollars violate the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment? Decision of the Court In a 6‚Äì3 decision in favor of Marsh, Chief Justice Burger wrote the opinion for the majority. The Chief Justice noted that the position of chaplain has been closely tied to the work of state and federal legislatures. \\"This unique history leads us to accept the interpretation of the First Amendment draftsmen who saw no real threat to the Establishment Clause arising from a practice of prayer similar to that now challenged.\\" Dissenting opinions Justice Brennan, joined by Justice Marshall, wrote in a dissenting opinion, > The Court makes no pretense of subjecting Nebraska's practice of legislative > prayer to any of the formal \\"tests\\" that have traditionally structured our > inquiry under the Establishment Clause. That it fails to do so is, in a > sense, a good thing, for it simply confirms that the Court is carving out an > exception to the Establishment Clause, rather than reshaping Establishment > Clause doctrine to accommodate legislative prayer. For my purposes, however, > I must begin by demonstrating what should be obvious: that, if the Court > were to judge legislative prayer through the unsentimental eye of our > settled doctrine, it would have to strike it down as a clear violation of > the Establishment Clause.Marsh, 463 U.S. at 796 (Brennan, J., dissenting). Citing Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971), Justice Brennan points out that the circumstances in the present case clearly do not meet the three-point Lemon test: > Every analysis in this area must begin with consideration of the cumulative > criteria developed by the Court over many years. Three such tests may be > gleaned from our cases. First, the statute [at issue] must have a secular > legislative purpose; second, its principal or primary effect must be one > that neither advances nor inhibits religion; finally, the statute must not > foster \\"an excessive government entanglement with religion.\\"Marsh, 463 U.S. > at 797 (Brennan, J., dissenting, quoting ). Justice Stevens also wrote a dissenting opinion, where he essentially argues that religious minorities of any particular region will be disenfranchised by the majority ruling, stating: > Prayers may be said by a Catholic priest in the Massachusetts Legislature > and by a Presbyterian minister in the Nebraska Legislature, but I would not > expect to find a Jehovah's Witness or a disciple of Mary Baker Eddy or the > Reverend Moon serving as the official chaplain in any state legislature. > Regardless of the motivation of the majority that exercises the power to > appoint the chaplain, it seems plain to me that the designation of a member > of one religious faith to serve as the sole official chaplain of a state > legislature for a period of 16 years constitutes the preference of one faith > over another in violation of the Establishment Clause of the First > Amendment.\\"Marsh, 463 U.S. at 823 (Stevens, J., dissenting). Subsequent history In Town of Greece v. Galloway (2014) the Court held that the Establishment Clause is not violated when a town board begins their sessions with a sectarian prayer, so long as the town does not discriminate against minority faiths in determining who may offer a prayer.. The Court rejected the Fourth Circuit's opinion in Simpson v. Chesterfield County Board of Supervisors, which cited Marsh and held that town boards may exclude prayers that do not fit within \\"the Judeo-Christian tradition.\\" See also * List of United States Supreme Court cases, volume 463 ReferencesExternal links * Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Burger Court Category:Establishment Clause case law Category:1983 in United States case law Category:1983 in religion Category:Nebraska Legislature Category:American chaplains ","title":"Marsh v.

Plot summary Time travelers from the United States, called tempunauts, are sent only a few days into the future rather than a century as was intended. In this near-future, they learn their return from the future was fatal to them. Addison Doug, one of the tempunauts, believes that they are trapped with the rest of the Earth in a closed time loop, forever doomed to repeat the period between their starting their trip and their fatal return. Having found out the cause of their fatal return journey, they have to decide whether to change or not to change their return journey in order to get out of the loop.

Data mapping is used as a first step for a wide variety of data integration tasks, including: * Data transformation or data mediation between a data source and a destination * Identification of data relationships as part of data lineage analysis * Discovery of hidden sensitive data such as the last four digits of a social security number hidden in another user id as part of a data masking or de- identification project * Consolidation of multiple databases into a single database and identifying redundant columns of data for consolidation or elimination For example, a company that would like to transmit and receive purchases and invoices with other companies might use data mapping to create data maps from a company's data to standardized ANSI ASC X12 messages for items such as purchase orders and invoices. Standards X12 standards are generic Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) standards designed to allow a company to exchange data with any other company, regardless of industry. The standards are maintained by the Accredited Standards Committee X12 (ASC X12), with the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) accredited to set standards for EDI. The X12 standards are often called ANSI ASC X12 standards. In the future, tools based on semantic web languages such as Resource Description Framework (RDF), the Web Ontology Language (OWL) and standardized metadata registry will make data mapping a more automatic process. This process will be accelerated if each application performed metadata publishing. Full automated data mapping is a very difficult problem (see semantic translation). Hand-coded, graphical manual  Data mappings can be done in a variety of ways using procedural code, creating XSLT transforms or by using graphical mapping tools that automatically generate executable transformation programs. These are graphical tools that allow a user to \\"draw\\" lines from fields in one set of data to fields in another. Some graphical data mapping tools allow users to \\"auto-connect\\" a source and a destination. This feature is dependent on the source and destination data element name being the same. Transformation programs are automatically created in SQL, XSLT, Java programming language, or C++. These kinds of graphical tools are found in most ETL (extract, transform, and load) tools as the primary means of entering data maps to support data movement. Examples include SAP BODS and Informatica PowerCenter. Data-driven mapping This is the newest approach in data mapping and involves simultaneously evaluating actual data values in two data sources using heuristics and statistics to automatically discover complex mappings between two data sets. This approach is used to find transformations between two data sets, discovering substrings, concatenations, arithmetic, case statements as well as other kinds of transformation logic. This approach also discovers data exceptions that do not follow the discovered transformation logic. Semantic mapping Semantic mapping is similar to the auto-connect feature of data mappers with the exception that a metadata registry can be consulted to look up data element synonyms. For example, if the source system lists FirstName but the destination lists PersonGivenName, the mappings will still be made if these data elements are listed as synonyms in the metadata registry. Semantic mapping is only able to discover exact matches between columns of data and will not discover any transformation logic or exceptions between columns. Data lineage is a track of the life cycle of each piece of data as it is ingested, processed, and output by the analytics system. This provides visibility into the analytics pipeline and simplifies tracing errors back to their sources. It also enables replaying specific portions or inputs of the data flow for step-wise debugging or regenerating lost output. In fact, database systems have used such information, called data provenance, to address similar validation and debugging challenges already.De, Soumyarupa. (2012).

Polypersonalism is a morphological feature of a language, and languages that display it are called polypersonal languages. In non-polypersonal languages, the verb either shows no agreement at all or agrees with the primary argument (in English, the subject). In a language with polypersonal agreement, the verb has agreement morphemes that may indicate (as applicable) the subject, the direct object, the indirect or secondary object, the beneficiary of the verb action, etc. This polypersonal marking may be compulsory or optional (the latter meaning that some agreement morphemes can be elided if the full argument is expressed). Polysynthesis often includes polypersonalism, which in turn is a form of head-marking. Polypersonalism has also been correlated with ergativity. Examples of languages with polypersonal agreement are Basque, Georgian, Magahi, to a lesser extent Hungarian (see Definite conjugation) and several other Uralic languages such as Mansi, Mordvinic or Nenets, the Bantu languages, as well as most polysynthetic languages, like Mohawk, Inuktitut and many other Native American languages. Examples=Georgian In Georgian, the verb consists of a root and several optional affixes. The subject and object markers might appear as suffixes or prefixes, according to the verb class, the person and number, the tense and aspect of the verb, etc.; they also interact with each other phonologically. The polypersonal verbal system of Georgian allows the verb compound to convey the meanings of subject, direct object, indirect object, genitive, locative and causative meanings. As examples of the extremely complicated Georgian verb morphology, these are some simple polypersonal verbs (hyphens indicate morpheme boundaries): :v-khed-av \\"I see him\\" :g-mal-av-en \\"they hide you (sing. or pl.)\\" :g-i-mal-av-en \\"they hide it from you (sing. or pl.)\\" :gv-i-ket-eb-s \\"he is doing it for us\\" :a-chuk-eb-s \\"he will give it to him (as a gift)\\" :mi-u-lots-av-s \\"he will congratulate him on it\\" :a-rb-en-in-eb-en \\"They are making him run\\" :gad-mo- gv-a-xtun-eb-in-eb-di-t \\"you would make us make him jump (towards us)\\" An example of a polypersonal verb that has the genitive meaning incorporated can be: :xelebi ga-m-i-tsiv-d-a \\"My hands got cold\\" Here, xelebi means \\"hands.\\" The second morpheme in the verb (-m-) conveys the meaning \\"my.\\" In Georgian this construction is very common with intransitive verbs; the possessive adjective (my, your, etc.) is omitted before the subject, and the verb takes up the genitive meaning. Basque Basque is a language isolate with a polypersonal verbal system comprising two sub-types of verbs, synthetic and analytical. The following three cases are cross-referenced on the verb: the absolutive (the case for the subject of intransitive verbs and the direct objects of transitive verbs), the ergative (the case for the subject of transitive verbs), and the dative (the case for the indirect object of a transitive verb). A dative (along with the absolutive) can also be cross- referenced on an intransitive verb without a direct object in a \\"dative of interest\\" type of construction (cf. English \\"My car broke down on me\\"), as well as in constructions involving intransitive verbs of perception or feeling. Synthetic verbs take affixes directly onto their stems, while analytical verbs use a non-finite form that carries the lexical meaning of the verb, along with a conjugated auxiliary which is either strictly transitive or intransitive. Some common auxiliaries used to conjugate analytical verbs are izan ‚Äòbe‚Äô, ukan ‚Äòhave‚Äô, and egin ‚Äòdo‚Äô. Unlike Georgian, Basque has only two really synthetic tenses able to take these affixes: present simple and past simple. Here are a few examples: Synthetic forms: : d-akar-ki-o-gu ‚ÄòWe bring it to him/her‚Äô, from ekarri ‚Äòbring‚Äô (‚Äòd‚Äô standing for ‚Äòit‚Äô, ‚Äòki‚Äô for the dative case, ‚Äòo‚Äô for ‚Äòhe‚Äô, and ‚Äògu‚Äô for ‚Äòwe‚Äô) : z-erama-zki-gu-te-n ‚ÄòThey took them to us‚Äô from eraman ‚Äòtake‚Äô Analytical or semi-synthetic forms: : Ekarriko d-i-o-gu ‚ÄòWe'll bring it to him/her‚Äô : Eraman d-ieza-zki-gu-ke-te ‚ÄòThey can take them to us‚Äô (‚Äòd‚Ä¶zki‚Äô standing for ‚Äòthem‚Äô, ‚Äòieza‚Äô being a form of the auxiliary ‚Äòizan‚Äô, ‚Äògu‚Äô standing for ‚Äòto us‚Äô, ‚Äòte‚Äô for ‚Äòthey‚Äô, and ‚Äòke‚Äô being a potential marker) : Iristen z-a-izki-zue ‚ÄòThey get to you (pl)‚Äô from iritsi ‚Äòget, arrive‚Äô Semitic languages In Biblical Hebrew, or in poetic forms of Hebrew, a pronominal direct object can be incorporated into a verb's conjugation rather than included as a separate word. For example, ahavtikha, with the suffix -kha indicating a masculine, singular, second-person direct object, is a poetic way to say ahavti otkha (\\"I love you\\"). This also changes the position of the stress; while ahavti puts the stress on hav (), ahavtikha puts it on ti (). The same is true also of Arabic and Akkadian. A number of modern Arabic dialects incorporate both direct and indirect object pronouns, e.g. Egyptian Arabic \\"he didn't write them to me\\". (In Classical Arabic the equivalent would be three words: .) Ganda In Ganda, direct and indirect pronominal objects may be incorporated into the verb as object infixes. For example: In the second example, the applicative suffix -ira converts the (usually monotransitive) verb gamba to a ditransitive. While agreement with a verbal subject is compulsory, agreement with an object is required only when the object is omitted. Many other Bantu languages exhibit this feature. Hungarian In Hungarian the suffix -lak/-lek indicates a first person singular subject and a second person (either singular or plural) object. The most prominent example is szeretlek \\"I love you\\". The second person singular object may be omitted but the plural requires the pronoun (titeket). Clitic pronouns Polypersonalism involves bound morphemes that are part of the verbal morphology and therefore cannot be found separated from the verb. These morphemes are not to be confused with pronominal clitics. Some have observed that the French pronominal clitics (common to all Romance languages) have evolved into inseparable parts of the verb in the colloquial use, and so, suggested that French could be analyzed as polypersonal.

The two were on their way to a bushcamp near Onion Lake to recruit sympathetic bushworkers for a large strike which was gaining momentum west of Thunder Bay in Shabaqua and Shebandowan. Discovery of the bodies and funeral The bodies of Rosvall and Voutilainen were found by a union search party, which included Aate Pitkanen, at Onion Lake the following spring. The men's funeral on April 28, 1930 was the largest ever held in Thunder Bay. Adding to the legendary status of the event, a solar eclipse darkened the sky as the funeral procession marched to Riverside Cemetery.S. Repo, \\"Rosvall and Voutilainen: Two Union Men Who Never Died\\", Labour/Le Travail Autumn/Spring 1981/82. Volume 8/9, pg. 95 http://www.lltjournal.ca/index.php/llt/article/viewPDFInterstitial/2634/3037 The funeral events were regarded as the symbolic beginning of the Great Depression for local residents. Cause of death The official cause of death was ruled to be accidental drownings; however, the Finnish community in Thunder Bay suspected that the two were murdered by thugs employed by the bushcamp boss. Evidence that the two men had struggled before their deaths as well as the questionable matter that two experienced bushworkers had drowned in shallow water added to the feeling that foul play was involved. Furthermore, some community members claimed that they had gained knowledge that the hired thugs were in Finland, where they had been shipped after the murder. Legacy The case of Rosvall and Voutilainen continues to be controversial. An Ontario Historical Plaque was erected by the province to commemorate Rosvall and Voutilainen's role in Ontario's heritage.Ontario Plaque The plaque was erected in the memory of the two men in Centennial Park which has a small logging museum and is located approximately 20 kilometres downstream on Current River which flows out of Onion Lake where the bodies were found. The plaque reads > On November 18, 1929, Finnish-Canadians Viljo Rosvall and Janne Voutilainen > left the Port Arthur area for Onion Lake, 20 kilometres upstream from here > to recruit bushworkers for a strike. Their bodies were found at Onion Lake > the following spring. Local unionists and many Finnish-Canadians suspected > foul play, but coroner's juries ruled the deaths accidental drownings.

The mystery surrounding the deaths of > Rosvall and Voutilainen endures, sustaining them in public memory as martyrs > to the cause of organized labour. As an event that has seeped into more mainstream Canadian consciousness, the case of Rosvall and Voutilainen has aroused interest from academics, unionists, and authors. For instance, Michael Ondaatje's 1987 novel In the Skin of a Lion gives a fictionalized account of the murder of Rosvall and Voutilainen. Continuing controversy Historian Peter Raffo has carefully analyzed the oral and written evidence, and concluded, \\"According to the contemporary historical record, the likelihood is that Rosvall and Voutilainen were not murdered. The oral record - the myth - does not stand up well to close examination. Practically none of its details are sustained by the facts of the case... Not martyrs so much as tragic and brave victims.\\"P. Raffo, \\"Oral Witness versus Documentary Evidence ; the case of Rosvall and Voutilianen,\\" Thunder Bay Historical Museum Society Papers and Records, XXIX (2001), 3-34. Raffo's analysis, however, might be criticized from at least two different angles: firstly, the reliability of Raffo's access and interpretation of the oral record as a non-Finnish speaking academic; and secondly, as an interpretation based almost entirely on the \\"oral record\\" for evidence, largely neglecting other important elements in the case of Rosvall and Voutilainen. Satu Repo, for instance, observes in her article \\"Rosvall and Voutilainen: Two Union Men Who Never Died\\" that > The advances made by [social historians such as] E.P. Thompson in expanding > historical writing about the working class to include the experienced, > \\"lived\\" quality of history, the way the past felt to the contemporaries, are > not easy to apply to Canadian working-class history. There are several > reasons for this. Not only is it hard to find records from which to > construct the subjective side of working-class lives, (this is presumably > the case everywhere), but these records, even when they do exist, speak in > the numerous languages of our ethnically fragmented population. The > precondition to access to some of them requires a kind of double identity, > an ability to be on intimate terms with some \\"other\\" Canadian experience, > and at the same time the capability of communicating that experience to the > mainstream culture. An additional problem, of course, is the highly > selective nature of any such records. For obviously it is not some > homogeneous working class, but certain self-conscious and articulate > minorities who are likely to leave a record of any kind.S. Repo, \\"Rosvall > and Voutilainen: Two Union Men Who Never Died\\", Labour/Le Travail > Autumn/Spring 1981/82. Volume 8/9, pg. 79 > http://www.lltjournal.ca/index.php/llt/article/viewPDFInterstitial/2634/3037 Repo thus raises the question of how accurate Raffo's analysis could be, given that Raffo lacked direct access to Finnish-language sources. It could be charged further that Raffo's article is an inappropriate attempt to use a highly emotional and controversial event in Thunder Bay labour history as merely a case study in oral history. As for the second criticism, the reliance on oral history does not address many of the facts of the case. Voutilainen was a trapper who had maintained trap lines in the Onion Lake area for several years, and thus, intimately familiar with the area.S. Repo, \\"Rosvall and Voutilainen: Two Union Men Who Never Died\\", Labour/Le Travail Autumn/Spring 1981/82. Volume 8/9, pg. 85 http://www.lltjournal.ca/index.php/llt/article/viewPDFInterstitial/2634/3037 How could an experienced trapper with an intimate knowledge of the local environment fall through ice and drown in (at most) three and a half feet of water? The testimony of the official coroner, Dr. Crozier, also raises doubts. Not only was his testimony highly agitated and hostile,S. Repo, \\"Rosvall and Voutilainen: Two Union Men Who Never Died\\", Labour/Le Travail Autumn/Spring 1981/82. Volume 8/9, pg. 91 http://www.lltjournal.ca/index.php/llt/article/viewPDFInterstitial/2634/3037 but Crozier also belonged to an anti-union \\"citizens' group\\" formed around the time of the Winnipeg General Strike. Other inconsistencies include contradictory statements from the camp boss, Maki, and evidence of injuries on the bodies suggesting a struggle before their drowning.S. Repo, \\"Rosvall and Voutilainen: Two Union Men Who Never Died\\", Labour/Le Travail Autumn/Spring 1981/82. Volume 8/9, pg. 92 http://www.lltjournal.ca/index.php/llt/article/viewPDFInterstitial/2634/3037 That violent methods were used by employers, the authorities, and/or vigilantes to disrupt or discourage union activity around this time in North America is not unusual. Numerous instances such as the lynching of Frank Little, the case of Sacco and Vanzetti, the Everett Massacre, or the Estevan Riot, to name only a few, clearly show that violent and brutal means were common place in class conflict.

Senior havildars are promoted to JCO rank on the basis of merit and seniority, restricted by the number of vacancies. JCOs are treated as a separate class and hold many privileges. With good pay and privileges, it is an ambition of most enlisted men to attain such rank. Primarily the term was associated with armies but since 2000s India and Pakistan's navies and forces are using the term to indicate their Chief Petty Officers and Warrant Officers. The British Indian Army recruited Gurkha soldiers from Nepal since the 19th century and separate Gurkha Regiments were created for them, the Gurkha soldiers got same ranks as other Indian soldiers; the modern Nepal Army officially made the Indian Army rank system for their soldiers in 1960s through a series of reorganizations and the 'JCO' term is being used by them from then. After the secession of East Pakistan in 1971 the Bangladesh Army inherited the 'JCO' rank system from Pakistan Army though since early 2000s the army uses the Warrant Officer terms. History In the British Indian Army during the British Raj, JCOs were known as Viceroy's Commissioned Officers (VCOs) except in Nepal, which was never a British colony. Under the British, there was a clear colonial context, with the VCOs being the highest ranks that an Indian could attain while the full commissioned officers were British ‚Äì a distinction which disappeared with Indian independence. Army A Junior Commission is signed and awarded by the Havildar's commanding officer. This type of commission is inferior to that held by full commissioned officers. In the army, JCOs have a separate mess (the JCOs' mess), and are entitled to travel in AC 2 Tier on the railways and by air economy class (while on temporary duty or other movements). In the infantry, all JCO ranks have the word subedar in them, whereas the cavalry equivalent is risaldar. The JCO ranks in the Indian Army and the Pakistan Army (from highest to lowest) are: *Subedar Major/Risaldar Major *Subedar/Risaldar *Naib Subedar/Naib Risaldar JCOs holding the rank of Naib Subedar or Subedar often serve as platoon commanders in an infantry company in place of lieutenants, with a major as the company commander and a captain as second-in- command. JCOs holding the rank of Subedar Major assist their battalion's commanding officer in the same way as a regimental sergeant major would, to the extent that the equivalent rank of regimental havildar major is now almost obsolete in the Indian Army. In the Indian Army, due to their long years of service, officers accord JCOs great respect and JCOs have a great amount of influence, especially in cases involving the enlisted ranks, their welfare and morale. Another custom religiously followed is that a JCO is never addressed using just his name or rank. The word sahib (sir) is added as a suffix, e.g. a subedar named Pritam Singh would be addressed as either Subedar Sahib or Pritam Singh Sahib. Navy Sailors receive a warrant on promotion to the rank of Chief Petty Officer and this is a certificate issued by the Commodore Bureau of Sailors on behalf of an admiral of India/Pakistan to authenticate the promotion of a sailor to the Chief Petty rank, as the CPO/MCPO II/MCPO I ranks are Junior Commissioned ranks. The Warrant is made on pre-printed stationery written by hand. The JCO equivalent (or Chief Petty) ranks in the Indian Navy and Pakistan Navy are: *Master Chief Petty Officer Class 1 Master Chief Petty Officer (Pakistan) *Master Chief Petty Officer Class 2 Fleet Chief Petty Officer (Pakistan) *Chief Petty Officer Air Force The JCO equivalent (or Warranted) ranks in the Indian Air Force and Pakistan Air Force are: *Master Warrant Officer Chief Warrant Officer (Pakistan) *Warrant Officer *Junior Warrant Officer Assistant Warrant Officer (Pakistan) Honorary commissions There is also a custom of giving honorary commissions to deserving JCOs. Every year a list of eligible JCOs is drawn up and honorary commissions awarded to them. This could be at the time of retirement, or when still in service. Honorary commissioned officers may wear the appropriate rank insignia, but they do not become members of the officers' mess. They do, however, receive the pay and pension of their honorary rank. The honorary ranks in the various forces are: Indian Army: *Honorary Lieutenant *Honorary Captain Indian Navy: *Honorary Sub Lieutenant *Honorary Lieutenant Indian Air Force: *Honorary Flying Officer *Honorary Flight Lieutenant Generally, in official documents the JCO rank held by the person is also added before the Honorary Commission rank.

The second mate is the third in command (or on some ocean liners fourth) and a watchkeeping officer, customarily the ship's navigator. Other duties vary, but the second mate is often the medical officer and in charge of maintaining distress signaling equipment. On oil tankers, the second mate usually assists the chief mate with the Cargo operations. The Navigator's role focuses on creating the ship's passage plans. A passage plan is a comprehensive, step by step description of how the voyage is to proceed from berth to berth or one port to another. The plan includes undocking, departure, the en route portion of a voyage, approach, and mooring at the destination. The GMDSS (Global Maritime Distress and Safety System) officer role consists of performing tests and maintenance, and ensuring the proper log-keeping on the ship's Global Maritime Distress Safety System equipment. Safety equipment includes Emergency Position-Indicating Radio Beacons, a NAVTEX unit, INMARSAT consoles, various radios, Search and Rescue Transponders, and Digital Selective Calling systems. Watchkeeping A second mate is almost always a watchkeeper. In port and at sea, the second mate is responsible to the captain for keeping the ship, its crew, and its cargo safe for eight hours each day. Traditionally, the second mate stands a \\"12-4\\" watch: from midnight until 4 a.m. and noon until 4 p.m. On watch, he must enforce all applicable regulations, such as safety of life at sea and pollution regulations. In port, the watch focuses on duties such as cargo operations, fire and security watches, monitoring communications, and the anchor or mooring lines. IMO regulations require the officer be fluent in English. This is required for a number of reasons, such as to use charts and nautical publications, understand weather and safety messages, communication with other ships and coast stations, and to be able to work with a multi- lingual crew. Sea watch At sea, the mate on watch has three fundamental duties: to navigate the ship, to safely avoid traffic, and to respond to emergencies. Mates generally stand watch with able seamen who act as helmsman and lookout. The helmsman executes turns and the lookout reports dangers such as approaching ships. These roles are often combined to a single helmsman/lookout and, under some circumstances, can be eliminated completely. The ability to smartly handle a ship is key to safe watchstanding. A ship's draught, trim, speed and under-keel clearance all affect its turning radius and stopping distance. Other factors include the effects of wind and current, squat, shallow water, and similar effects. Shiphandling is key when the need arises to rescue a man overboard, to anchor, or to moor the ship. The officer must also be able to transmit and receive signals by Morse light and to use the International Code of Signals. Officer in charge of navigational equipment and other aids to navigation On the ship the second officer is the officer that works under the master, i.e. the captain of the ship, and shoulders the responsibility of checking the functionality of all the navigational equipment, such as the echo-sounder, radar, ECDIS, AIS, and on some vessels even the GMDSS radio equipment; however, recently it has been observed that companies tend to designate the responsibility of maintaining the GMDSS equipment to the third officer. These checks are made in according to the companies' planned maintenance system. In addition these checks are usually made prior to arrival and departure ports. Often if any navigational equipment is suspected of being faulty then it should be checked that the equipment is in working order as per the given performance standards. Correction of navigation charts and the duties of keeping the charts up to date rests on the second mate. These corrections are received in the Weekly/Monthly/Annual Notices to Mariners, if Admiralty Charts are used on board. Corrections are to be made using the standard Symbols from Chart 5011. Admiralty Publication NP 294 How to Keep Charts Up to Date, should be used as a reference to maintenance of charts. However, due to the introduction of the ECDIS in a phased manner that is due to be introduced on most merchant vessels by 2018, manual correction of charts is fast becoming obsolete. ECDIS has ushered in the age of SENC, Vector Charts; these charts can be updated remotely by the broadcasts of the service provider, provided that the ship is connected to the Internet. Corrections may also be received via email, or Correction CD's, depending on the service provider and your needs. Navigation While a ship is under way, the officers navigate it, typically in three shifts or watches.Celestial, terrestrial, electronic, and coastal navigation techniques are used to fix a ship's position on a navigational chart. Accounting for effects of winds, tides, currents and estimated speed, the officer directs the helmsman to keep to track. The officer uses supplemental information from nautical publications, such as Sailing Directions, tide tables, Notices to Mariners, and radio navigational warnings to keep the ship clear of danger in transit. Safety demands the mate be able to quickly solve steering control problems and to calibrate the system for optimum performance. Since magnetic and gyrocompasses show the course to steer, the officer must be able to determine and correct for compass errors. Weather's profound effect on ships requires the officer be able to interpret and apply meteorological information from all available sources. This requires expertise in weather systems, reporting procedures, and recording systems. Traffic management Mates were in high demand during World War II. NDL, 1966. During this time, he was responsible for all freight operation of the cargo freighter The International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea are a cornerstone of safe watchkeeping. Safety requires that one live these rules and follow the principles of safe watchkeeping. Maximizing bridge teamwork, including Bridge Resource Management is an emerging focus in watchkeeping. The main purpose for Radar and Automatic Radar Plotting Aids (ARPA) on a ship's bridge are to move safely among other vessels. These tools help to accurately judge information about prominent objects in the vicinity, such as: * range, bearing, course and speed * time and distance of closest point of approach * course and speed changes These factors help the officer apply the COLREGS to safely maneuver in the vicinity of obstructions and other ships. Unfortunately, radar has a number of limitations, and ARPA inherits those limitations and adds a number of its own. Factors such as rain, high seas, and dense clouds can prevent radar from detecting other vessels. Conditions such as dense traffic and course and speed changes can confuse ARPA units. Finally, human errors such as inaccurate speed inputs and confusion between true and relative vectors add to the limitations of the radar/ARPA suite. The radar operator must be able to optimize system settings and detect divergences between an ARPA system and reality. Information obtained from radar and ARPA has to be treated with scrutiny: over reliance on these systems has sunk ships. The officer must understand system performance. Examples include limitations and accuracy, tracking capabilities and limitations, and processing delays, and the use of operational warnings and system tests. Emergencies Emergencies can happen at any time, and the officer must be equipped to safeguard passengers and crew. After a collision or a grounding, the officer must be able to take initial action, perform damage assessment and control, and understand the procedures for rescuing persons from the sea, assisting ships in distress, and responding to any emergency which may arise in port. The officer must understand distress signals and know the IMO Merchant Ship Search and Rescue Manual. Cargo handling The ship's officer must be able to oversee the loading, stowage, securing and unloading of cargoes. Requirements include understanding the care of cargo during the voyage. Of particular importance is knowledge of the effect of cargo including heavy lifts on the seaworthiness and stability of the ship. The officer must also understand safe handling, stowage and securing of cargoes, including cargoes that are dangerous, hazardous or harmful. Controlling ship operations The officer has special responsibilities to keep the ship, the people on board and the environment safe. This includes keeping the ship seaworthy during fire and loss of stability, and providing aid and maintaining safety during man overboard, abandoning ship, and medical emergencies. Understanding ship's stability, trim, stress, and the basics of ship's construction is a key to keeping a ship seaworthy. Competencies include knowing what to do in cases of flooding and loss of buoyancy. Fire is also a constant concern. Knowing the classes and chemistry of fire, fire-fighting appliances, and systems prepares the officer to act fast in case of fire. An officer must be expert in the use of survival craft and rescue boats, their launching appliances and arrangements, and their equipment including radio life-saving appliances, satellite EPIRBs, SARTs, immersion suits and thermal protective aids. It's important to be expert in the techniques for survival at sea techniques in case it's necessary to abandon ship. Officers are trained to perform medical tasks and to follow instructions given by radio or obtained from guides. This training includes what to do in case of common shipboard accidents and illnesses. Licensing=United States A second mate must have a number of qualifications, including a license.To become a second mate (unlimited) in the United States, one must have been a Third Mate and have at least 360 days of service while holding that license. Third mates who attained their licenses after the implementation of STCW 95 have passed all the examination topics required for the second mate's license, and can automatically claim the second mate's license after documenting the required service. Third mates who attained their licenses before STCW 95 must meet additional requirements. There are two methods to attain an unlimited third mate's license in the United States: to attend a specialized training institution, or to accumulate \\"sea time\\" and take a series of training classes and examinations. Training institutions that can lead to a third mate's license include the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy (deck curriculum), the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, and U.S. Naval Academy with qualification as an under way officer in charge of a navigational watch, any of the state maritime colleges, the Great Lakes Maritime Academy, or a three-year apprentice mate training program approved by the Commandant of the U.S. Coast Guard. A seaman may start the process of attaining a license after three years of service in the deck department on ocean steam or motor vessels, at least six months of which as able seaman, boatswain, or quartermaster. Then the seaman takes required training courses, and completes on-board assessments. Finally, the mariner can apply to the United States Coast Guard for a Third Mate's license. A master of 1,600 ton vessels can, under certain circumstances, begin the application process for an unlimited third mate's license. If approved the applicant must then successfully pass a comprehensive license examination before being issued the license. Hawsepiper is an informal maritime industry term used to refer to an officer who began his or her career as an unlicensed merchant seaman and did not attend a traditional maritime college/academy to earn the officer license. A ship's hawsepipe is the pipe passing through the bow section of a ship that the anchor chain passes through. Hawsepiper refers to climbing up the hawsepipe, a nautical metaphor for climbing up the ship's rank structure. Hawsepiper is considered a positive term when said respectfully. Most hawsepipers are proud of their background and use the term to describe themselves. Several merchant seamen's unions offer their membership the required training to help them advance. Similarly, some employers offer financial assistance to pay for employee training. Otherwise, the mariner is responsible for the cost of the required training. There have been complaints that the hawsepiper progression path has been made too difficult since the requirements of STCW 95 have been enacted. Issues include the cost in time and money to meet formal classroom training requirements. Critics assert that the newer requirements will eventually lead to a shortage of qualified mariners, especially in places like the United States. India In India the authority to issue licences rests with the Directorate General of Shipping. In order to be eligible to receive such a licence a cadet must have worked for the required amount of time and have work experience which should translate into the required amount of seatime prescribed by the administration in accordance with the STCW Code 2010. In addition he must possess various mandatory training in Life saving, Survival, Fire fighting, Bridge team Management etc. And lastly he must have cleared the 2MFG written and orals conducted by the various Mercantile Marine Departments, aka. MMD. The for the 2MFG orals a candidate may be examined by a Nautical Surveyor, Deputy Nautical Advisers or the Nautical Adviser of India. The Age of Sail In the 1840s personal narrative Two Years Before the Mast, the author (Richard Henry Dana, Jr.) describes the role of a second mate on an American merchant trading brig as follows: > The second mate's is proverbially a dog's berth. He is neither officer nor > man. The men do not respect him as an officer, and he is obliged to go aloft > to reef and furl the topsails, and to put his hands into the tar and slush, > with the rest. The crew call him the \\"sailor's waiter,\\" as he has to furnish > them with spun-yarn, marline, and all other stuffs that they need in their > work, and has charge of the boatswain's locker, which includes serving- > boards, marline-spikes, etc. He is expected by the captain to maintain his > dignity and to enforce obedience, and still is kept at a great distance from > the mate, and obliged to work with the crew. He is one to whom little is > given and of whom much is required. His wages are usually double those of a > common sailor, and he eats and sleeps in the cabin; but he is obliged to be > on deck nearly all the time, and eats at the second table, that is, makes a > meal out of what the captain and chief mate leave. However, the role of the second mate officer (or any subordinate officer) was then very much determined by the captain of a ship. So, as the author has described, it is not necessarily the case with the officer in other ships. Nowadays, the role of a second officer on board any ship is that of a navigating officer; he is in charge of navigation, navigational equipment and navigational publications. He reports to the captain of the ship. Deck work charge is not expected on a second officer but he may do so. He is a licensed officer.

He was involved in \\"remote viewing\\" (RV) operations and experiments conducted by U.S. Army Intelligence and the Stanford Research Institute. He was among the first personnel recruited for the classified program now known as the Stargate Project (1978‚Äì95). Along with colleague Ingo Swann, McMoneagle is best known for claims surrounding the investigation of RV and the use of paranormal abilities for military intelligence gathering. His interests also include near-death experiences, out-of-body travel, and unidentified flying objects. Biography=Early years McMoneagle describes a remarkable memory of very early childhood events. He grew up surrounded by alcoholism, abuse and poverty. As a child, he had visions at night when scared, and began to hone his psychic abilities in his teens for his own protection when he hitchhiked. He enlisted in the Army in 1964, at the age of 18, to get away from the family turmoil. McMoneagle subsequently became an experimental remote viewer while serving in U.S. Army Intelligence.Memoirs of a Psychic Spy : The Remarkable Life of U.S. Government Remote Viewer 001 by Joseph McMoneagle, Hampton Roads Publishing Co., 2002, 2006, Revised and updated version of McMoneagles' The Stargate Chronicles, first edition. Military career McMoneagle's early career was as an NCO and he retired after 20 years as a chief warrant officer. He was severely injured in a helicopter accident in Vietnam. He was involved in intelligence work for 15 years. From 1978, he was known as \\"Remote Viewer No. 1\\" at Project Stargate ‚Äî the U.S. Army's psychic intelligence unit at Fort Meade, Maryland.

He believes he has remote-viewed into the past, present, and future and has predicted future events. Among the subjects he claims to have remote-viewed are a Chinese nuclear facility, the Iranian hostage crisis, the Red Brigades, and Muammar Qadhafi. He writes that he predicted the location and existence of the Soviet \\"Typhoon\\"-class submarine in 1979, and that in mid-January 1980, satellite photos confirmed those predictions.Memoirs of a Psychic Spy : The Remarkable Life of U.S. Government Remote Viewer 001 by Joseph McMoneagle, Hampton Roads Publishing Co., 2002, 2006, p. 123, Revised and updated version of McMoneagles' The Stargate Chronicles, first edition McMoneagle says the military remote viewing program was ended partly due to stigma: \\"Everybody wanted to use it, but nobody wanted to be caught dead standing next to it.

McMoneagle co-wrote an episode of the psychic science fiction show The Dead Zone. In the episode, remote viewing was used in the hunt for Osama Bin Laden. USA Network, which aired The Dead Zone, canceled the episode's initially scheduled broadcast because of concern about the subject matter, but did air the program a few months later, after the series returned from a mid-season hiatus. In 2002, McMoneagle started receiving regular coverage on Nippon Television's prime-time Chounouryoku Sousakan show (roughly translated, \\"FBI: Psychic Investigator\\"), during which he performed remote viewings related to unsolved police cases.

The third mate is a watchstander and customarily the ship's safety officer and fourth-in-command (fifth on some ocean liners). The position is junior to a second mate. Other duties vary depending on the type of ship, its crewing, and other factors. Duties related to the role of safety officer focus on responsibility for items such as firefighting equipment, lifeboats, and various other emergency systems. Watchstanding International Maritime Organization (IMO) regulations require the officer be fluent in the English language. This is required for a number of reasons. Examples include the ability to read charts and nautical publications, understand weather and safety messages, communicate with other ships and coast stations, and to successfully interact with a multi-lingual crew. General watchstandingEmergencies= Emergencies can happen at any time. The officer must be ready at all times to safeguard passengers and crew. After a collision or grounding, the mate must be able to take initial action, perform damage assessment and control, and understand the procedures for rescuing persons from the sea, assisting ships in distress, and responding to any emergency which may arise in port. The officer must understand distress signals and know the IMO Merchant Ship Search and Rescue Manual. =Controlling ship operations= The officer has special responsibilities to keep the ship, the people on board and the environment safe. This includes keeping the ship seaworthy during fire and loss of stability, and providing aid and maintaining safety during man overboard, abandoning ship, and medical emergencies. Understanding ship's stability, trim, stress, and the basics of ship's construction is a key to keeping a ship seaworthy. The mate must know what to do in cases of flooding and loss of buoyancy. Fire is also a constant concern. Knowing the classes and chemistry of fire, fire-fighting appliances and systems prepares the officer to act fast in case of fire. An officer must be expert in the use of survival craft and rescue boats, their launching appliances and arrangements, and their equipment including radio life-saving appliances, satellite EPIRBs, SARTs, immersion suits and thermal protective aids. In case it is necessary to abandon ship, it is important to be expert in the techniques for survival at sea. Officers are trained to perform medical tasks and to follow instructions given by radio or obtained from guides. This training includes what to do in case of common shipboard accidents and illnesses. Sea watch At sea, the mate on watch has three fundamental duties: to navigate the ship, to safely avoid traffic, and to respond to any emergencies that may arise. Mates generally stand watch with able seamen who act as helmsman and lookout. The helmsman executes turns and the lookout reports dangers such as approaching ships. These roles are often combined to a single helmsman/lookout and, under some circumstances, can be eliminated completely. The ability to smartly handle a ship is key to safe watchstanding. A ship's draught, trim, speed and under-keel clearance all affect its turning radius and stopping distance. Other factors include the effects of wind and current, squat, shallow water and similar effects. Ship handling is key when the need arises to rescue a person overboard, to anchor, or to moor the ship. The officer must also be able to transmit and receive signals by Morse light and to use the International Code of Signals. =Navigation= While a ship is underway, the officers navigate it, typically in three shifts or watches.Celestial, terrestrial, electronic, and coastal navigation techniques are used to fix a ship's position on a navigational chart. Accounting for effects of winds, tides, currents and estimated speed, the officer directs the helmsman to keep to track. The officer uses supplemental information from nautical publications, such as Sailing Directions, tide tables, Notices to Mariners, and radio navigational warnings to keep the ship clear of danger in transit. Safety demands the mate be able to quickly solve steering control problems and to calibrate the system for optimum performance. Since magnetic and gyrocompasses show the course to steer, the officer must be able to determine and correct for compass errors. Weather's profound effect on ships requires the officer be able to interpret and apply meteorological information from all available sources. This requires expertise in weather systems, reporting procedures and recording systems. =Traffic management= Avoiding collisions can be challenging in heavy traffic. The International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea are a cornerstone of safe watchkeeping. Safety requires one lives these rules and follows the principles of safe watchkeeping. An emerging focus in watchkeeping is maximizing bridge teamwork, including the practice of Bridge Resource Management. The main purpose for Radar and Automatic Radar Plotting Aids (ARPA) on a ship's bridge is to move safely among other vessels. These instruments help to accurately judge information about prominent objects in the vicinity, such as: * range, bearing, course and speed, * time and distance of closest point of approach, and * course and speed changes. These factors help the officer apply the COLREGS to safely maneuver in the vicinity of obstructions and other ships. Unfortunately, radar has a number of limitations, and ARPA inherits those limitations and adds a number of its own. Factors such as rain, high seas, and dense clouds can prevent radar from detecting other vessels. Moreover, dense traffic and course and speed changes can confuse ARPA units. Finally, human errors such as inaccurate speed inputs and confusion between true and relative vectors add to the limitations of the radar/ARPA suite. Under the best conditions, the radar operator must be able to optimize system settings and detect divergences between an ARPA system and reality. Information obtained from radar and ARPA must be treated with scrutiny: over reliance on these systems has sunk ships. The officer must understand system performance, limitations and accuracy, tracking capabilities and limitations, and processing delays, and the use of operational warnings and system tests. In-port watch In port, the watch focuses on duties such as cargo operations, fire watches, security watches, monitoring communications, and monitoring the anchor or mooring lines. =Cargo handling= The ship's officer must be able to oversee the loading, stowage, securing and unloading of cargoes. He must also understand the care of cargo during the voyage. Of particular importance is knowledge of the effect of cargo including heavy lifts on the seaworthiness and stability of the ship. The officer must also understand safe handling, stowage and securing of cargoes, including cargoes that are dangerous, hazardous or harmful. Safety officer The third mate is usually responsible for the upkeep of lifesaving and firefighting equipment.Turpin and McEwen, 1980:1-1.Turpin and McEwen, 1980:1-25. This includes a responsibility for some or all of the ship's boats, and particularly the lifeboats. The third mate is also generally an active participant in fire and boat drills.Turpin and McEwen, 1980:1-11. Working conditions Merchant mariners spend extended periods at sea. Most deep-sea mariners are hired for one or more voyages that last for several months. The length of time between voyages varies depending on job availability and personal preference. At sea, these workers usually stand watch for 4 hours and are off for 8 hours, 7 days a week. People in water transportation occupations work in all weather conditions. Although merchant mariners try to avoid severe storms while at sea, working in damp and cold conditions is inevitable. While it is uncommon nowadays for vessels to suffer disasters such as fire, explosion, or a sinking, workers face the possibility that they may have to abandon their craft at short notice if it collides with other vessels or runs aground. They also risk injury or death from falling overboard and hazards associated with working with machinery, heavy loads, and dangerous cargo. However, modern safety management procedures, advanced emergency communications, and effective international rescue systems place modern mariners in a much safer position. Most newer vessels are air-conditioned, soundproofed from noisy machinery, and equipped with comfortable living quarters. For some mariners, these amenities have helped ease the sometimes difficult circumstances of long periods away from home. Also, modern communications, especially email, link modern mariners to their families. Nevertheless, some mariners dislike the long periods away from home and the confinement aboard ship and consequently leave the occupation. National details=United Kingdom Certification Initial Officer of the Watch (OOW) Certification in the United Kingdom can be achieved through the various training programme options, these are; MNTB Deck Officer Cadet training programme (Degree Route), leading to the following qualifications: Foundation Degree (FdSc) in Marine Operations Direct pathway to BSc (Hons) Marine Operations Management MCA STCW‚Äô95 II/I OOW certification MNTB Deck Officer Cadet training programme (HND Route), leading to the following qualifications: Higher National Diploma (HND) in Nautical Science NVQ Level 3 in Merchant Vessel Operations MCA STCW‚Äô95 II/I OOW certification Alternative training programmes for Experienced Seafarers (Examination or NVQ Level 3 Routes), leading to the following qualifications: MCA STCW‚Äô95 II/I OOW certification HND Part I in Nautical Science All entry routes require the UK candidate to have successfully undertaken STCW'95 safety and certification training in the following; Personal Survival Techniques, Fire Prevention and Firefighting, Elementary First Aid, Personal Safety & Social Responsibilities, Proficiency in Medical First Aid Aboard Ship, Proficiency in Survival Craft & Rescue Boats, Advanced Firefighting, Efficient Deck Hand, MCA Signals Examination, GMDSS General Operator's Certificate and Navigation Radar & ARPA Simulation Training (Operational Level) United StatesLicensing= A third mate must have a number of qualifications, including a license. There are two methods to attain an unlimited third mate's license in the United States: to attend a specialized training institution, or to accumulate \\"sea time\\" and take a series of training classes and examinations. Training institutions that can lead to a third mate's license include the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy (deck curriculum), or any of the other state maritime colleges. The Coast Guard Academy does not give licenses to its graduating cadets. A seaman may start the process of attaining a license after three years of service in the deck department on ocean steam or motor vessels, at least six months of which as able seaman, boatswain, or quartermaster. Then the seaman takes required training courses and completes on-board assessments. Finally, the mariner can apply to the United States Coast Guard for a Third Mate's license.Bureau of Labor Statistics, 2007:2. A master of 1,600 ton vessels can, under certain circumstances, begin the application process for an unlimited third mate's license. If approved the applicant must then successfully pass a comprehensive license examination before being issued the license. Hawsepiper is an informal term referring to an officer who did not attend a maritime college or academy and began his or her career as a seaman.Halyer, 2003:xvi. The term derives from the ship‚Äôs hawsepipe: the pipe passing through the bow section of a ship that the anchor chain passes through.Halyer, 2003:8-15. \\"Coming up through the hawsepipe\\" is a nautical metaphor for climbing up the ship's rank structure. Some maritime unions offer their membership the required training for career advancement, such as the American Maritime Officers RTM-STAR Center and the Paul Hall Center for Maritime Training and Education administered by the Seafarers International Union of North America. Similarly, some employers offer financial assistance to pay for the training for their employees. Otherwise, the mariner is responsible for the cost of the required training. Since the requirements of STCW '95 have been enacted, there have been complaints that the hawsepiper career path has been made too difficult. Examples include the cost in time and money to meet formal classroom training requirements. Critics assert that the newer requirements will eventually lead to a shortage of qualified mariners, especially in places like the United States. =Working conditions= The rate of unionization for these workers is about 36 percent, much higher than the average for all occupations. Consequently, merchant marine officers and seamen, both veterans and beginners, are hired for voyages through union hiring halls or directly by shipping companies. Hiring halls rank the candidates by the length of time the person has been out of work and fill open slots accordingly. Hiring halls typically are found in major seaports. Mates employed on Great Lakes ships work 60 days and have 30 days off, but do not work in the winter when the lakes are frozen. Workers on rivers, on canals, and in harbors are more likely to have year-round work. Some work 8-hour or 12-hour shifts and go home every day. Others work steadily for a week or a month and then have an extended period off. When working, they usually are on duty for 6 or 12 hours and off for 6 or 12 hours. Those on smaller vessels are normally assigned to one vessel and have steady employment.

Initially, video games supporting PhysX were meant to be accelerated by PhysX PPU (expansion cards designed by Ageia). However, after Ageia's acquisition by Nvidia, dedicated PhysX cards have been discontinued in favor of the API being run on CUDA- enabled GeForce GPUs. In both cases, hardware acceleration allowed for the offloading of physics calculations from the CPU, allowing it to perform other tasks instead. PhysX and other middleware physics engines are used in a large majority of today's video games because they free game developers from having to write their own code that implements classical mechanics (Newtonian physics) to do, for example, soft body dynamics. History What is known today as PhysX originated as a physics simulation engine called NovodeX. The engine was developed by Swiss company NovodeX AG, an ETH Zurich spin-off. In 2004, Ageia acquired NovodeX AG and began developing a hardware technology that could accelerate physics calculations, aiding the CPU. Ageia called the technology PhysX, the SDK was renamed from NovodeX to PhysX, and the accelerator cards were dubbed PPUs (Physics Processing Units). The first game to use PhysX was Bet On Soldier: Blood Sport (2005). In 2008, Ageia was itself acquired by graphics technology manufacturer Nvidia. Nvidia started enabling PhysX hardware acceleration on its line of GeForce graphics cards and eventually dropped support for Ageia PPUs. PhysX SDK 3.0 was released in May 2011 and represented a significant rewrite of the SDK, bringing improvements such as more efficient multithreading and a unified code base for all supported platforms. At GDC 2015, Nvidia made the source code for PhysX available on GitHub, but required registration at developer.nvidia.com. The proprietary SDK was provided to developers for free for both commercial and non-commercial use on Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS and Android platforms. On December 3, 2018, PhysX was made open source under a 3-clause BSD license, but this change applied only to computer and mobile platforms. Features The PhysX engine and SDK are available for Microsoft Windows, macOS, Linux, PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, Wii,, iOS and Android. PhysX is a multi-threaded physics simulation SDK. It supports rigid body dynamics, soft body dynamics (like cloth simulation, including tearing and pressurized cloth), ragdolls and character controllers, vehicle dynamics, particles and volumetric fluid simulation. Hardware acceleration alt=Comparison of physics levels in (PC) The top screenshot shows how debris is simulated in Mafia II when PhysX is turned to the highest level in the game settings. The bottom screenshot shows a similar scene with PhysX turned to the lowest level. PPU A physics processing unit (PPU) is a processor specially designed to alleviate the calculation burden on the CPU, specifically calculations involving physics. PhysX PPUs were offered to consumers in the forms of PCI or PCIe cards by ASUS, BFG Technologies, Dell and ELSA Technology. Beginning with version 2.8.3 of the PhysX SDK, support for PPU cards was dropped, and PPU cards are no longer manufactured. The last incarnation of PhysX PPU standalone card designed by Ageia had roughly the same PhysX performance as a dedicated 9800GTX. GPU After Nvidia's acquisition of Ageia, PhysX development turned away from PPU extension cards and focused instead on the GPGPU capabilities of modern GPUs. Modern GPUs are very efficient at manipulating and displaying computer graphics, and their highly parallel structure makes them more effective than general-purpose CPUs for accelerating physical simulations using PhysX. Any CUDA-ready GeForce graphics card (8-series or later GPU with a minimum of 32 cores and a minimum of 256 MB dedicated graphics memory) can take advantage of PhysX without the need to install a dedicated PhysX card. APEX Nvidia APEX technology is a multi-platform scalable dynamics framework build around the PhysX SDK. It was first introduced in Mafia II in August 2010. Nvidia's APEX comprises the following modules: APEX Destruction, APEX Clothing, APEX Particles, APEX Turbulence, APEX ForceField and formerly APEX Vegetation which was suspended in 2011. From version 1.4.1 APEX SDK is deprecated. Nvidia FleX FleX is a particle based simulation technique for real-time visual effects. Traditionally, visual effects are made using a combination of elements created using specialized solvers for rigid bodies, fluids, clothing, etc. Because FleX uses a unified particle representation for all object types, it enables new effects where different simulated substances can interact with each other seamlessly. Such unified physics solvers are a staple of the offline computer graphics world, where tools such as Autodesk Maya's nCloth, and Softimage's Lagoa are widely used. The goal for FleX is to use the power of GPUs to bring the capabilities of these offline applications to real-time computer graphics.  Criticism from Real World Technologies  On July 5, 2010, Real World Technologies published an analysis of the PhysX architecture. According to this analysis, most of the code used in PhysX applications at the time was based on x87 instructions without any multi-threading optimization. This could cause significant performance drops when running PhysX code on the CPU. The article suggested that a PhysX rewrite using SSE instructions may substantially lessen the performance discrepancy between CPU PhysX and GPU PhysX. In response to the Real World Technologies analysis, Mike Skolones, product manager of PhysX, said that SSE support had been left behind because most games are developed for consoles first and then ported to the PC. As a result, modern computers run these games faster and better than the consoles even with little or no optimization. Senior PR manager of Nvidia, Bryan Del Rizzo, explained that multi-threading had already been available with CPU PhysX 2.x and that it had been up to the developer to make use of it. He also stated that automatic multithreading and SSE would be introduced with version 3 of the PhysX SDK. PhysX SDK 3.0 was released in May 2011 and represented a significant rewrite of the SDK, bringing improvements such as more efficient multithreading and a unified code base for all supported platforms. Usage= PhysX in video games  PhysX technology is used by game engines such as Unreal Engine (version 3 onwards), Unity, Gamebryo, Vision (version 6 onwards), Instinct Engine, Panda3D, Diesel, Torque, HeroEngine and BigWorld. As one of the handful of major physics engines, it is used in many games, such as The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, Warframe, Killing Floor 2, Fallout 4, Batman: Arkham Knight, Borderlands 2, etc. Most of these games use the CPU to process the physics simulations. Video games with optional support for hardware- accelerated PhysX often include additional effects such as tearable cloth, dynamic smoke or simulated particle debris.

Soft-paste decorated in enamel colours with a gold anchor mark. V&A; Museum no. 528-1902 Victoria and Albert Museum, London Soft-paste porcelain (sometimes simply \\"soft paste\\", or \\"artificial porcelain\\") is a type of ceramic material in pottery, usually accepted as a type of porcelain. It is weaker than \\"true\\" hard-paste porcelain, and does not require either the high firing temperatures or the special mineral ingredients needed for that. There are many types, using a range of materials. The material originated in the attempts by many European potters to replicate hard-paste Chinese export porcelain, especially in the 18th century, and the best versions match hard- paste in whiteness and translucency, but not in strength.Edwards, 3-6 But the look and feel of the material can be highly attractive, and it can take painted decoration very well.Battie, 104; Edwards, 4 The ingredients varied considerably, but always included clay, often ball clay, and often ground glass, bone ash, soapstone (steatite), flint, and quartz. They rarely included the key ingredients necessary for hard-paste, china clay including kaolin, or the English china stone,Edwards, 1-6 although some manufacturers included one or other of these, but failed to get their kilns up to a hard-paste firing temperature. They were called \\"soft paste\\" (after the French \\"p√¢te tendre\\") either because the material is softer in the kiln, and prone to \\"slump\\", or their firing temperatures are lower compared with hard-paste porcelain,Honey (1977), 4; Rado, P, An Introduction To The Technology Of Pottery, 2nd edition. Pergamon Press, 1988 or, more likely, because the finished products actually are far softer than hard-paste, and early versions were much easier to scratch or break, as well as being prone to shatter when hot liquid was suddenly poured into them.Honey (1977), 2, 4, 8 The German Meissen porcelain had developed hard-paste porcelain by 1708, and later German factories usually managed to find the secret out from former Meissen employees, beginning with Vienna porcelain in 1718.Battie, 88-102 The other European countries had much longer to wait, but most factories eventually switched from soft to hard- paste, having discovered both the secret and a source of kaolin. In France kaolin was only found in Limousin in 1768, and S√®vres produced both types from 1769, before finally dropping soft-paste in 1804.Honey (1977), 3; Battie, 107-109 In England there was a movement in a different direction, as Spode's formula for bone china, developed in the 1790s, was adopted by most other factories by about 1820. By that point little soft-paste porcelain was being made anywhere, and little hard-paste in England, with Nantgarw and Swansea in Wales among the last factories making soft-paste.Honey (1977), 4-5; see Edwards for the Welsh factories. Background Saint-Cloud manufactory soft porcelain bowl, with blue decoration under glaze, 1700-1710. There were early attempts by European potters to replicate Chinese porcelain when its composition was little understood and its constituents were not widely available in the West. The earliest formulations were mixtures of clay and ground-up glass (frit). Soapstone (steatite) and lime are also known to have been included in some compositions. The first successful attempt was Medici porcelain, produced between 1575 and 1587. It was composed of white clay containing powdered feldspar, calcium phosphate and wollastonite (CaSiO3), with quartz.Marco Spallanzani, Ceramiche alla Corte dei Medici nel Cinquecento, (Pisa: Scuola Normale Superiore, and Modena: Franco Cosimo Panini, 1994), p. 69.According to on-site Raman spectroscopic analyses performed at the Mus√©e National de C√©ramique, S√®vres, reported in Ph. Colomban, V. Milande, H. Lucas, \\"On-site Raman analysis of Medici porcelain\\", Journal of Raman Spectroscopy, 35.1 (2003:68-72). Other early European soft- paste porcelain, also a frit porcelain, was produced at the Rouen manufactory in 1673, which was known for this reason as \\"Porcelaine fran√ßaise\\".Artificial Soft Paste Porcelain - France, Italy, Spain and England Edwin Atlee Barber p.5-6 Again, these were developed in an effort to imitate high-valued Chinese hard-paste porcelain. As these early formulations slumped in the kiln at high temperatures, they were difficult and uneconomic to use. Later formulations used kaolin (china clay), quartz, feldspars, nepheline syenite and other feldspathic rocks. Soft-paste porcelain with these ingredients was technically superior to the traditional soft-paste and these formulations remain in production. Characteristics Soft-paste formulations containing little clay are not very plasticHoney (1952), p.296 and shaping it on the potter's wheel is difficult. Pastes with more clay (now more commonly referred to as \\"bodies\\"), such as electrical porcelain, are extremely plastic and can be shaped by methods such as jolleying and turning. The feldspathic formulations are, however, more resilient and suffer less pyroplastic deformation. Soft- paste is fired at lower temperatures than hard-paste porcelain, typically around 1100 ¬∞CFournier, p.214Lane, p.21 for the frit based compositions and 1200 to 1250 ¬∞C for those using feldspars or nepheline syenites as the primary flux. The lower firing temperature gives artists and manufacturers some benefits, including a wider palette of colours for decoration and reduced fuel consumption. The body of soft-paste is more granular than hard-paste porcelain, less glass being formed in the firing process. According to one expert, with a background in chemistry, \\"The definition of porcelain and its soft-paste and hard-paste varieties is fraught with misconceptions\\",Edwards, 4 and various categories based on the analysis of the ingredients have been proposed instead.Edwards, 4-6 Some writers have proposed a \\"catch-all\\" category of \\"hybrid\\" porcelain, to include bone china and various \\"variant\\" bodies made at various times.Edwards, 3-4 This includes describing as \\"hybrid soft-paste porcelain\\" pieces made using kaolin but apparently not fired at a sufficiently high temperature to become true hard-paste, as with some 18th- century English and Italian pieces.Hess, Catherine (2003), Italian Ceramics: Catalogue of the J. Paul Getty Museum Collections, pp 230, 237 note 7, 2003, Getty Publications, , 9780892366705, google books At least in the past, some sources dealing with modern industrial chemistry and pottery production have made a completely different distinction between \\"hard porcelain\\" and \\"soft porcelain\\", by which all forms of pottery porcelain, including East Asian wares, are \\"soft porcelain\\".Inorganic Chemistry, by A. F. Holleman, Egon Wiberg, Nils Wiberg, Editor Nils Wiberg, 2001, Academic Press, ISBN, 0123526515, 9780123526519, google books; see also Singer and Singer, pp. 104-1102 European soft-paste Chinese porcelain, which arrived in Europe before the 14th century, was much admired and expensive to purchase. Attempts were made to imitate it from the 15th century onwards but its composition was little understood. Its translucency suggested that glass might be an ingredient,Honey (1952), p.496 so many experiments combined clay with powdered glass (frit), including the porcelain made in Florence in the late 16th century under the patronage of the Medicis. In Venice there were experiments supposedly using opaque glass alone.Honey (1952), p.497 German factories either made hard-paste from their foundation, like Meissen, Vienna, Ludwigsburg, Frankenthal and later factories, or obtained the secret and switched. France did in fact make hard-paste at Strasbourg in 1752-54, until Louis XV gave his own factory, Vincennes, a monopoly, at which point the factory moved to become the Frankenthal operation.Battie, 88-102 Early factories in France, England, Italy, Denmark, Sweden, Holland, Switzerland and other countries made soft-paste, the switch to hard-paste generally coming after 1750, with France and England rather in the rear, as explained below.Battie, 102-113 The American China Manufactory (or Bonnin and Morris) in Philadelphia, America's first successful porcelain factory, also made soft- paste from about 1770-72.Metropolitan Museum France Saint-Cloud manufactory soft porcelain vase, with blue designs under glaze, 1695-1700. Experiments at the Rouen manufactory produced the earliest soft-paste in France, when a 1673 patent was granted to Louis Poterat, but it seems that not much was made. An application for the renewal of the patent in 1694 stated, \\"the secret was very little used, the petitioners devoting themselves rather to faience-making\\". Rouen porcelain, which is blue painted, is rare and difficult to identify.Honey (1952), p.528 The first important French porcelain was made at the Saint-Cloud factory, which was an established maker of faience. In 1702, letters-patent were granted to the family of Pierre Chicaneau, who were said to have improved upon the process discovered by him, and since 1693 to have made porcelain as \\"perfect as the Chinese\\". The typical blue-painted Saint-Cloud porcelain, says Honey, \\"is one of the most distinct and attractive of porcelains, and not the least part of its charm lies in the quality of the material itself. It is rarely of a pure white, but the warm yellowish or ivory tone of the best wares of the period is sympathetic and by no means a shortcoming; and while actually very soft and glassy, it has a firm texture unlike any other. The glaze often shows a fine satin-like pitting of the surface that helps to distinguish it from the brilliant shiny glaze of Mennecy, which is otherwise similar. The heavy build of the pieces is also characteristic and is saved from clumsiness by a finer sense of mass, revealed in the subtly graduated thickness of wall and a delicate shaping of edges.\\"Honey (1952), p.533 Louis Henry de Bourbon, prince de Cond√© established a soft-paste factory on the grounds of his ch√¢teau de Chantilly in 1730; Chantilly porcelain continued to be made after his death in 1740. A soft-paste factory was opened at Mennecy by Fran√ßois Barbin in 1750. The Vincennes porcelain factory was established in 1740 under the supervision of Claude- Humbert G√©rin, who had previously been employed at Chantilly. The factory moved to larger premises at S√®vresMetropolitan Museum of Art in 1756. A superior soft-paste was developed at Vincennes, whiter and freer of imperfections than any of its French rivals, which put Vincennes/S√®vres porcelain in the leading position in France and throughout the whole of Europe in the second half of the 18th century.Metropolitan Museum of Art The use of frit in this paste lent it the names \\"Frittenporzellan\\" in Germany and \\"frita\\" in Spain. In France it was known as \\"p√¢te tendre\\" and in England \\"soft-paste\\", perhaps because it does not easily retain its shape in the wet state, or because it tends to slump in the kiln under high temperature, or because the body and the glaze can be easily scratched. (Scratching with a file is a crude way of finding out whether a piece is made of soft-paste or not.) England The first soft-paste in England was demonstrated by Thomas Briand to the Royal Society in 1742 and is believed to have been based on the Saint-Cloud formula. In 1749, Thomas Frye, a portrait painter, took out a patent on a porcelain containing bone ash. This was the first bone china, subsequently perfected by Josiah Spode. Recipes were closely guarded, as illustrated by the story of Robert Brown, a founding partner in the Lowestoft factory, who is said to have hidden in a barrel in Bow to observe the mixing of their porcelain.Savage (1983), p.215 A partner in Longton Hall referred to \\"the Art, Secret or Mystery\\" of porcelain.Savage, (1983), p.212 In the fifteen years after Briand's demonstration, several factories were founded in England to make soft-paste table-wares and figures:All covered by Honey (1977) - see Index or Contents * Chelsea 1743 ‚ÄòScience Of Early English Porcelain.‚Äô I.C.

Vase of so-called Chinese soft-paste, with crackle glaze and underglaze blue painting, Kangxi period (1662‚Äì1722) Chinese soft-paste porcelain Unlike the European product, Chinese porcelain began with hard-paste, and it is common to regard all Chinese production as hard-paste,Edwards, 4 until bone china began to be made there in the 20th century. However, a classification of \\"Chinese soft-paste porcelain\\" is often recognised by museums and auction-houses,example in the Walters Art Museum; example in the Metropolitan Museum; Lot 3205 \\"A FINE AND RARE DING-TYPE GLAZED SOFT-PASTE VASE, QIANLONG INCISED SIX-CHARACTER SEAL MARK AND OF THE PERIOD (1736-1795)\\" Christie's, Hong Kong, Sale 3265, Imperial Chinese Porcelain: Treasures from a Distinguished American Collection, 27 November 2013, another example though its existence may be denied by others.Edwards, 4 It refers to pieces of Chinese porcelain, mostly from the first half of the 18th century, that are less translucent than most Chinese porcelain and have a rather milky-white glaze, which is prone to crackling. Some regard it as essentially made from a hard-paste body that did not reach a sufficiently high firing temperature, or uses a different glaze formula. It takes underglaze cobalt blue painting especially well, which is one of the factors leading it to be identified as the wares using a mineral ingredient called huashi, mentioned by Father Fran√ßois Xavier d'Entrecolles in his published letters describing Chinese production.Valenstein, 242 It used to be thought that the special ingredient was soapstone (aka \\"French chalk\\", a form of steatite), as used in some English porcelain. However chemical analsis of samples shows no sign of this.Savage & Newman, 267-268 Hard-paste porcelain Hard-paste porcelain was successfully produced at Meissen in 1708 by Ehrenfried Walther von Tschirnhaus, though Johann Friedrich B√∂ttger who continued his work has often been credited with the discovery of this recipe. As the recipe was kept secret, experiments continued elsewhere, mixing glass materials (fused and ground into a frit) with clay or other substances to give whiteness and a degree of plasticity. Plymouth porcelain, founded in 1748, which moved to Bristol soon after, was the first English factory to make hard- paste.Honey (1977), Chapter 14 NotesReferences *Atterbury, Paul (ed.), The History of Porcelain (Orbis, 1982) *Battie, David, ed., Sotheby's Concise Encyclopedia of Porcelain, 1990, Conran Octopus. *Edwards, Howell G.M., Nantgarw and Swansea Porcelains: An Analytical Perspective, 2018, Springer, , 9783319776316, google books *Fournier, Robert, Illustrated Dictionary of Practical Pottery (Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1973) *Honey, W.B.

Widely used as a flavor enhancer, it is typically obtained from chicken byproducts or other meat industry waste. Inosinic acid is important in metabolism. It is the ribonucleotide of hypoxanthine and the first nucleotide formed during the synthesis of purine nucleotides. It can also be formed by the deamination of adenosine monophosphate by AMP deaminase. It can be hydrolysed to inosine. The enzyme deoxyribonucleoside triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase, encoded by YJR069C in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and containing (d)ITPase and (d)XTPase activities, hydrolyzes inosine triphosphate (ITP) releasing pyrophosphate and IMP. Important derivatives of inosinic acid include the purine nucleotides found in nucleic acids and adenosine triphosphate, which is used to store chemical energy in muscle and other tissues. In the food industry, inosinic acid and its salts such as disodium inosinate are used as flavor enhancers. It is known as E number reference E630. Inosinate synthesis The inosinate synthesis is complex, beginning with a 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP). Enzymes taking part in IMP synthesis constitute a multienzyme complex in the cell. Evidence demonstrates that there are multifunctional enzymes, and some of them catalyze non- sequential steps in the pathway. This figure shows the pathway described: IMP synthesis. Adenylate (AMP) and guanylate (GMP) come from inosinate Within a few steps inosinate becomes AMP or GMP. Both compounds are RNA nucleotides. AMP differs from inosinate by the replacement of IMP's carbon-6 carbonyl with an amino group. The interconversion of AMP and IMP occurs as part of the purine nucleotide cycle.Voet, D, Voet, J. G., Biochemistry (3rd Edition), John Wiley & Sons, Inc., 2004, pg 1095 GMP is formed by the inosinate oxidation to xanthylate (XMP), and afterwards adds an amino group on carbon 2. Hydrogen acceptor on inosinate oxidation is NAD+. Finally, carbon 2 gains the amino group by spending an ATP molecule (which becomes AMP+2Pi). While AMP synthesis requires GTP, GMP synthesis uses ATP. That difference offers an important regulation possibility. Glutamine-PRPP-amidotransferase Inosinate takes part in the regulation of purine nucleotide biosynthesis Inosinate and many other molecules inhibit the synthesis of 5-phosphorybosilamine from 5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate (PRPP), disabling the enzyme that catalyzes the reaction: glutamine-5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate-amidotransferase. In other words, when levels of inosinate are high, glutamine-5-phosphoribosyl-1-pyrophosphate-amidotransferase is inhibited, and, as a consequence, inosinate levels decrease. Also, as a result, adenylate and guanylate are not produced, which means that RNA synthesis cannot be completed because of the lack of these two important RNA nucleotides. Applications Inosinic acid can be converted into various salts including disodium inosinate (E631), dipotassium inosinate (E632), and calcium inosinate (E633). These three compounds are used as flavor enhancers for the basic taste umami with a comparatively high effectiveness. They are mostly used in soups, sauces, and seasonings for the intensification and balance of the flavor of meat.

It was first made in China around the 7th or 8th century, and has remained the most common type of Chinese porcelain.Fleming, John & Hugh Honour. (1977) The Penguin Dictionary of Decorative Arts. London: Allen Lane, p. 622. For the rare Chinese soft- paste, see here From the Middle Ages onwards it was very widely exported and admired by other cultures, and fetched huge prices on foreign markets. Eventually Korean porcelain developed in the 14th century and Japanese porcelain in the 17th, but other cultures were unable to learn or reproduce the secret of its formula in terms of materials and firing temperature until it was worked out in Europe in the early 18th century, and suitable mineral deposits of kaolin, feldspar and quartz discovered. This soon led to a large production in factories across Europe by the end of the 18th century. Despite the huge influence of Chinese porcelain decoration on Islamic pottery, historic production in the Islamic world was all in earthenware or fritware, the latter having some of the properties of hard-paste porcelain. Europeans also developed soft-paste porcelain, fired at lower temperatures (around 1200 ¬∞C), while trying to copy the Chinese, and later bone china which in modern times has somewhat replaced hard-paste across the world, even in China. History Chinese porcelain began to be exported to Europe by the Portuguese and later by the Dutch from the middle of the 16th century, creating vast demand for the material. The discovery in Europe of the secret of its manufacture has conventionally been credited to Johann Friedrich B√∂ttger of Meissen, Germany in 1708,Hildyard, Robin. (1999) European Ceramics. London: V&A; Publications, p.46. but it has also been claimed that English manufacturersPots of fame economist.com, 31 March 2010. Retrieved 28 November 2013.

Archived here. \\"The Discovery of European Porcelain Technology\\" by C.M. Queiroz & S. Agathopoulos, 2005. Certainly, the Meissen porcelain factory, established 1710, was the first to produce porcelain in Europe in large quantities and since the recipe was kept a trade secret by B√∂ttger for his company, experiments continued elsewhere throughout Europe. Vienna porcelain became the second European manufacturer in 1718, followed by Vezzi porcelain in Venice in 1720. Section of the letter of Fran√ßois Xavier d'Entrecolles about Chinese porcelain manufacturing techniques, 1712, published by Jean-Baptiste du Halde in 1735. French porcelain factory, 1771. Comte de Milly's L'art de la porcelaine, 1771. In 1712, the French Jesuit Fran√ßois Xavier d'Entrecolles described the Chinese process of manufacturing porcelain in his letters to Europe. In 1771, the comte de Milly published L'art de la porcelaine, a detailed account of the processes of creating hard-paste porcelain, ending its prestige as a rare and valuable material. Hard-paste now chiefly refers to formulations prepared from mixtures of kaolin, feldspar and quartz. Other raw materials can also be used and these include pottery stones, which historically were known as petunse although this name has long fallen out of use.‚ÄòChinese Porcelain‚Äô. N.Wood. Pottery Q. 12, (47), 101, 1977 Characteristics Hard-paste porcelain is now differentiated from soft-paste porcelain mainly by the firing temperature, with the former being higher, to around 1400¬∞C, and the latter to around 1200¬∞C.Singer, F. and Singer, S.S., Industrial Ceramics (Chapman Hall, 1963).Rado, Paul, An Introduction To The Technology Of Pottery (Pergamon Press, 1988). Depending on the raw materials and firing methods used, hard- paste porcelain can also resemble stoneware or earthenware. Hard-paste porcelain can also be used for unglazed biscuit porcelain. It is a translucent and bright, white ceramic. Hard-paste has the advantage over soft-paste that it is less likely to crack when exposed to hot liquids, but the higher firing temperature of hard-paste may necessitate a second \\"glost\\" firing for the decoration.

Presented at the 1993 Geneva Motor Show, the Guar√† was initially available in coup√© body-style. Later a roadster and an open-top barchetta bodystyle became available. The latter corresponds to the coup√© but without roof and proper windscreen; a small air deflector protects the passenger and the driver from the passing wind and the car had to be driven while wearing a helmet. Development 1998 De Tomaso Guar√† Spider (BMW-engined) The Guar√† is based on the Maserati Barchetta Stradale prototype from 1991 which was meant to be the street-legal variant of the track-only car. A take-over of Maserati by Fiat prevented Alejandro de Tomaso from realising such a variant of the Barchetta manufactured by Maserati as Maserati ceased production of the Barchetta under its new owner. The car was thus manufactured by De Tomaso and was named Guar√†. The Guar√† was designed by Carlo Gaino of \\"Synthesis Design\\" who also designed the Maserati Barchetta.  Production and Sales  The first cars (mainly Coup√©s) were sold in 1994 and with some interruptions the Coup√© and the Barchetta still were available (prepayment in full required) in 2005/2006 in Italy, Austria and Switzerland. However, it seems there were no cars built after 2004 when the company went into liquidation. The last car, ordered by an Austrian in 2004, was only delivered in 2011 after De Tomaso's liquidation was completed. Though sources vary, approximately fifty two cars in total were built. Ten were the open top barchettas, four were the convertible spiders, and 38 cars were coup√©s. The Spyders were built by Carrozzeria AutoSport S.r.L.  Specifications and performance  alt= Fibreglass, Kevlar, and other composites make the body shell, fitted to a backbone chassis made from aluminium. The suspension is a reminiscent of Formula 1 and IndyCar technology with independent upper and lower wishbone with pushrod front and rear end suspension having rose-joints designed by famed Formula 1 car engineer Enrique Scalabroni. The Guar√† is known for its highly agile handling which makes it a bit too \\"nervous\\" for the average driver. The Guar√† has no luggage space at all as the area under the front is utilised by the racing-style suspension. The large, distinct wheels are manufactured by Marchesini. Early variants of the Guar√° used the 4.0-litre BMW M60 V8 engine shared with the BMW 840Ci. This was due to Ford's inability to supply engines for the car. The engine was modified by De Tomaso and had different timing belt routing. The engine has a power output of . A six-speed manual transmission made by Getrag was used to drive the rear wheels and it had a gated shifter for easier gear changes. The engine has a red-line of 7,000 rpm. Later variants switched to a 4.6-litre supercharged cast-iron block V8 engine from Ford primarily because BMW phased out the engine. The Ford engine has a power output of . The brakes are from Brembo and were non-servo assisted. The brakes were similar to those used on the Ferrari F40. Like its predecessors, the Guar√° did not have a power-steering system as it increased weight. The interior is upholstered in leather and has racing bucket seats with optional six-point racing harness. Most of the interior components were sourced from BMW. The Guar√° had the steering and pedals manually adjusted according to the owner's preferred driving position. The Guar√° had a dry weight of and had a power-to-weight ratio of 236 PS per tonne with the BMW engine. The Guar√° could accelerate to in a claimed 5.0 seconds and had a claimed top speed of .

Arthur Dodd & David Murfin. 3rd edition. The Institute Of Minerals. 1994-1995. Bone china is the strongest of the porcelain or china ceramics, having very high mechanical and physical strength and chip resistance, and is known for its high levels of whiteness and translucency.Ozgundogdu, Feyza Cakir. ‚ÄúBone China from Turkey‚Äù Ceramics Technical; May2005, Issue 20, p29-32.'Trading Places.' R.Ware. Asian Ceramics. November,2009, p.35,37-39 Its high strength allows it to be produced in thinner cross-sections than other types of porcelain. Like stoneware it is vitrified, but is translucent due to differing mineral properties.What is China? As with stoneware, the body becomes vitrified; which means the body fuses, becomes nonabsorbent, and very strong. Unlike stoneware, china becomes very white and translucent. In the mid-18th century, English potters had not succeeded in making hard-paste porcelain (as made in East Asia and Meissen porcelain) but found bone ash a useful addition to their soft-paste porcelain mixtures, giving strength. This became standard at the Bow porcelain factory in London (operating from around 1747), and spread to some other English factories. The modern product was developed by the Staffordshire potter Josiah Spode in the early 1790s. Spode included kaolin, so his formula, sometimes called \\"Staffordshire bone-porcelain\\", was effectively hard-paste, but stronger, and versions were adopted by all the major English factories by around 1815.Honey, W.B., Old English Porcelain: A Handbook for Collectors, p. 4-5, 410-411, 1977, 3rd edn. revised by Franklin A. Barrett, Faber and Faber, From its initial development and up to the latter part of the 20th century, bone china was almost exclusively an English product, with production being effectively localised in Stoke-on-Trent. Most major English firms made or still make it, including Spode, Royal Crown Derby, Royal Doulton, and Wedgwood, Mintons. In the 20th century it began to be made elsewhere, especially in USSR, Leningrad (–õ–§–ó), China and Japan, and China is now the world's largest manufacturer. In the UK, references to \\"china\\" or \\"porcelain\\" can refer to bone china, and \\"English porcelain\\" has been used as a term for it, both in the UK and around the world.Osborne, Harold (ed), The Oxford Companion to the Decorative Arts, p. 130, 1975, OUP, ; Faulkner, Charles H., \\"The Ramseys at Swan Pond: The Archaeology and History of an East Tennessee Farm, p.96, 2008, Univ. of Tennessee Press, 2008, , 9781572336094; Lawrence, Susan, \\"Archaeologies of the British: Explorations of Identity in the United Kingdom and Its Colonies 1600-1945\\", p. 196, 2013, Routledge, , 781136801921  History  The first development of what would become known as bone china was made by Thomas Frye at his Bow porcelain factory near Bow in East London in 1748. His factory was located very close to the cattle markets and slaughterhouses of London and Essex, and hence easy access to animal bones. Frye used up to 45% bone ash in his formulation to create what he called \\"fine porcelain\\".'Trading Places.' R.Ware. Asian Ceramics. November,2009, p.35,37-39.\\"Science Of Early English Porcelain.\\" I.C. Freestone. Sixth Conference and Exhibition of the European Ceramic Society. Vol.1 Brighton, 20‚Äì24 June 1999, p.11-17 Plate from Ronald Reagan's state service for the White House, by Lenox Later, Josiah Spode in Stoke-on-Trent further developed the concept between 1789 and 1793, introducing his \\"Stoke China\\" in 1796. He died suddenly the year later, and his son Josiah II quickly rechristened the ware \\"Bone china\\".Spode Museum Trust:The First Spode Period 1776-1833 Among his developments was to abandon Frye's procedure of calcining the bone together with some of the other raw body materials, instead calcining just the bone. Bone china quickly proved to be highly popular, leading to its production by other English pottery manufacturers.Karwatka, Dennis. \\"Josiah Spode and His World-Famous Pottery.\\" Tech Directions; Apr 2009, Vol. 68 Issue 9, p12-12. Both Spode's formulation and his business were successful: his formulation of 6 parts bone ash, 4 parts china stone and 3.5 parts china clay, remains the basis for all bone china, and it was only in 2009 that his company, Spode, went into receivership before eventually being purchased by Portmeirion.  Production  The production of bone china is similar to porcelain, except that more care is needed because of its lower plasticity and a narrower vitrification range. The traditional formulation for bone china is about 25% kaolin, 25% Cornish stone and 50% bone ash.Birks, Steve. ‚ÄúBone China‚Äù The Potteries. 17 Feb. 2003 The bone ash that is used in bone china is made from cattle bones that have a lower iron content. These bones are crushed before being degelatinised and then calcined at up to 1250 ¬∞C to produce bone ash.‚ÄòProduction Of Bone Ash For The Manufacture Of Bone China.‚Äô Industrial Ceramics. No.843,1989, p.767-770 The ash is milled to a fine particle size.Whitewares: Production, Testing And Quality Control. W.Ryan & C.Radford. Pergamon Press / Institute Of Ceramics, 1987 The kaolin component of the body is needed to give the unfired body plasticity which allows articles to be shaped. This mixture is then fired at around 1200 ¬∞C. The raw materials for bone china are comparatively expensive, and the production is labour- intensive, which is why bone china maintains a luxury status and high pricing. Bone china consists of two crystalline phases, anorthite (CaAl2Si2O8) and Œ≤-tricalcium phosphate/whitlockite (Ca3(PO4)2) embedded in a substantial amount of glass.‚ÄòPottery Science ‚Äì materials, process and products.‚Äô Allen Dinsdale. Ellis Horwood. 1986.  Production locations  For almost 200 years from its development bone china was almost exclusively produced in the UK. During the middle part of the 20th century manufacturers in other countries began production, with the first successful ones outside the UK being in Japan: Noritake, Nikko and Narumi.

In more recent years production in China has expanded considerably, and the country is now the biggest producer of bone china in the world. Other countries producing considerable amounts of bone china are Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Iran, Sri Lanka and Thailand.Bangladesh Tableware. Asian Ceramics February 2012. From the start of the first factory, Bengal Potteries, in 1964, bone china output from Indian factories had risen to 10,000 tonnes per year by 2009. Indian Bone China - Serving Up Opportunities.

The production of bone china at the Lomonosov Porcelain Factory (Leningradsky Farforovii Zavod - –õ–§–ó (LFZ) (after the collapse of the USSR, the historical name IFZ was returned to it) began only in the 1960s. The recipe obtained by the plant‚Äôs specialists made it possible to create porcelain, the products from which were obtained thinner and whiter than English products from bone china. This was achieved thanks to the special regime of firing thin-walled products from bone china, and all formulation developers received USSR State Awards. Until now, –õ–§–ó (–ò–§–ó) in Saint-Petersburg, Russia)] remains the only company in Russia that produces bone china products. Lenox was the only major manufacturer of bone china in the United States, and has supplied presidential services to the White House. It closed production in the US permanently in March 2020. Cultural issues In the 21st century, \\"Islamic bone china\\" became available, using only bone ash from halal animals, as well as (more conventionally) clay and a high firing temperature.Shirazi, Faegheh, Brand Islam: The Marketing and Commodification of Piety, p. 17, 2016, University of Texas Press, , 9781477309469, google books Due to the use of animal bones in the production of bone china, some vegetarians and vegans avoid using or purchasing it.

The rugby ground is the home of Gala RFC and was formerly used by the professional Border Reivers team. It hosted one match of the 1999 Rugby World Cup. It has also occasionally been used for rugby league matches. The football ground is home to Gala Fairydean Rovers and has a Category A listed grandstand. Overview The Netherdale complex is located on Nether Road towards the east end of Galashiels, near the River Tweed. The Gala rugby ground is in the north-west corner of the site, with the Gala Fairydean Rovers football ground in the south-west; the two grounds are joined end-to-end. The rest of the site is taken up by a number of undeveloped rugby and football fields known as the back pitches. Gala RFC moved to the area in 1912 from their previous ground at Mossilee, initially playing on what is now the football ground before the construction of their present ground ‚Äì \\"New Netherdale\\" ‚Äì in 1961-62. Gala Fairydean F.C. arrived at Netherdale in 1929, initially playing on an undeveloped pitch called Raid Stane Park, before taking over the old rugby ground. Local amateur club Gala Rovers F.C. also played at the Netherdale complex before the two clubs merged to form Gala Fairydean Rovers in 2013. Since the installation of a 3G pitch in 2011, the Fairydean ground is officially known as the 3G Arena Netherdale and is also used as a community football and rugby facility. Football ground The main stand of Netherdale football stadium is a Category A listed building Gala RFC had previously played at the Public Park and Mossilee before moving to Netherdale in 1912, where their new ground incorporating a pavilion and grandstand was built at a cost of ¬£1,150. The first rugby match took place in September 1912, against local rivals Hawick. The rugby club continued to play on this part of the ground until the construction of the adjacent \\"New Netherdale\\" in 1961‚Äì62. The football stadium has a capacity of around 2,000. The ground‚Äôs most striking feature is the main stand, which was opened in 1964. With a capacity of 500 it is the largest stand in the Scottish Borders. Designed by the renowned British architect Peter Womersley in the brutalist style, the concrete structure is sometimes sarcastically dubbed as ‚Äúthe San Siro of the Borders.‚Äù It was awarded a 'B' category listing by Historic Scotland in December 2006, which means the \\"character and setting\\" of the building must be preserved for \\"future generations\\". Historic Scotland upgraded its listing to 'A' category in December 2013, stating that the stand is \\"a significant work of late modernist architecture in Scotland\\". The stand was closed during the 2018-19 season, pending works needed to repair water damage to the concrete. Rugby ground Netherdale rugby stadium, home of Gala RFC The rugby stadium has a large grandstand which overlooks the pitch and the nearby Eildon Hills. While the professional Border Reivers club played, a second fully seated stand was installed, increasing the capacity to around 4,000 from the previous 2,000. New pitch protection systems were installed, which the Scottish Rugby Union continued to pay the maintenance costs for even after the Border Reivers club was closed. The stadium hosted the 1999 Rugby World Cup Pool A match between Uruguay and Spain.IRB World Cup 99 Stats , rugbyworldcup.com; accessed 10 November 2015. Netherdale has also hosted rugby league international matches, firstly the match between Scotland and France on 31 October 2014 as part of the 2014 European Cup. France won that match 38-22. As part of the 2015 European Cup, Netherdale hosted the match between Scotland and Ireland on 23 October.

Founded on 1 April 1960, it has over 250 member organisations in 120 countries. Its head office is based in London, England, with regional offices in Latin America, Asia Pacific, Middle East and Africa. Consumers International is a not-for-profit company limited by guarantee, company number 04337865 and registered charity number 1122155.  History  The organisation was first established in 1960 as the International Organisation of Consumers Unions (IOCU) by national consumer organisations who wanted to create cross-border campaigns and share knowledge. IOCU was founded by Elizabeth Schadee, who would later chair the board of the Netherlands' Consumentenbond, and Caspar Brook, who was the first director of the United Kingdom's Consumers' Association. The two proposed an international conference to plan for consumer product testing organisations worldwide to work more closely together. The United States organization Consumers Union provided at the request of Colston Warne to help fund the event. In January 1960, these three organisations sponsored the First International Conference on Consumer Testing in The Hague. Thirty-four people representing seventeen consumer organisations in fourteen countries attended to discuss product testing and founding the International Organisation of Consumers Unions as an international organisation. Belgium's Association des Consommateurs and the Australian Consumers' Association joined the three conference sponsors as the five founding organisations who became the international organisation's initial council.  Membership  Consumers International has over 250 member organisations in 120 countries. These members are independent consumer organisations. About two-thirds of member organisations are in economically developing countries, the other third in industrialised countries. Consumers International also works with and hosts the Transatlantic Consumer Dialogue (TACD) a forum of US and EU consumer organisations that develops and agrees on consumer policy recommendations to the US government and European Union to promote the consumer interest in EU and US policy making ‚Äì at its office in London.  World Consumer Rights Day  On 15 March 1962 former US President John F. Kennedy said: WCRD's poster at Hanoi First two chapters of Access to Knowledge for Consumers, a book from the Access to Knowledge campaign of Consumers International Consumer rights activist Anwar Fazal working for Consumers International at the time, later proposed the observance of a 'World Consumer Rights Day' marking that date, and on 15 March 1983 consumer organisations started observing that date as an occasion to promote basic rights of consumers. World Consumer Rights Day is an annual occasion for celebration and solidarity within the international consumer movement. Participants observe the day by promoting the basic rights of all consumers, demanding that those rights are respected and protected, and protesting about the market abuses and social injustices which undermine them. World Consumer Rights Day is celebrated on 15 March every year. The theme for 2018 was Fairer Digital Marketplaces. Consumers International is calling for: 1. Access to fair and secure internet as half of the world is still offline. 2. Action against scams and fraud. 3. Better general consumer protection online. The Theme for 2019 was \\"Trusted Smart Products\\" which highlighted what the consumers needed from IoT products like smartphones and wearables.https://www.consumersinternational.org/what-we-do/world-consumer- rights-day/trusted-smart-products/ The theme for 2020 will be \\"The Sustainable Consumer\\" to spread awareness about environmental breakdown and global climate changes. https://www.consumersinternational.org/what-we-do/world-consumer- rights-day/sustainable-consumer-2020/  World Consumer Rights Day Theme  2013: Consumer Justice Now 2014: Fix Our Phone Rights!

Its campaigns often fall under the themes of consumer justice and protection, food policy, digital consumer rights and sustainability. Consumers International has campaigned on issues like junk food marketing and unethical drug promotion, corporate social responsibility and unethical or unsustainable behaviour by corporations and governments. In 1979, IOCU (which then became Consumers International) and other citizens‚Äô groups formed the International Baby Food Action Network (IBFAN) to eradicate the death and disease affecting millions of babies in economically developing countries as a result of consuming bottle-fed formula milk. After intense campaigning by IBFAN, including organising consumer boycotts against the likes of Nestl√©, whose subtle yet effective campaigns were undermining breast feeding, the World Health Assembly of the World Health Organization, adopted the International Code of Marketing on Breast Milk Substitutes the first such code designed to control widespread marketing abuses by baby food companies. In 1981, Consumers International co-founded the Health Action International (HAI), an informal network of some 120 consumer and public interest groups, HAI engaged in worldwide campaigns for the safe, rational and economic use of pharmaceuticals. At the 41st World Health Assembly in 1987, HAI organised a large lobby of delegates to urge stronger controls on advertising by the drugs industry.

Gordon was one of Famous' first directors, and he wrote and directed several Popeye the Sailor and Superman cartoons. Later, at Hanna- Barbera, Gordon worked on several cartoons featuring Yogi Bear, Huckleberry Hound, and others. In the late 1940s, \\"funny animals\\" and \\"teen humor\\" were two of the most popular categories in the ever-growing world of comic books. Gordon specialized in both genres and combined the two in the world's first funny-animal teen-humor title. When he created comic books, he used the pen name \\"Dang\\".Gifford, Denis. The International Book of Comics. (Crescent Books, 1984). 132. Retrieved from Google Books on January 24, 2011. \\"As drawn by \\"Dang\\" (the comic-book pen name of animator Dan Gordon from the Fleischer Studio) [...]\\"  Career = Van Beuren Studios, Fleischer Studios and Famous Studios  Dan Gordon began his animation career as a story man at New York's Van Beuren Studios, and by 1936 he was receiving a director's credit there. When Van Beuren went under, Gordon and many of his colleagues went to work for Paul Terry‚Äôs Terrytoons.Maltin, Leonard. Of Mice and Magic (New York: Plume, 1980, rev. 1987), p. 134. It was here that Gordon worked with Joe Barbera (another Van Beuren alum) on Pink Elephants, a cartoon that Barbera described as one of \\"... the first cartoons I had a hand in actually creating from the beginning.‚ÄùBarbera, Joe. My Life in ‚ÄòToons: From Flatbush to Bedrock in Under a Century (Turner Publishing, 1994), p. 56. Gordon and Barbera headed out west to MGM in 1937,Maltin, p. 136. but Gordon bolted back to the East shortly thereafter to help re-write the troubled Gulliver‚Äôs Travels animated feature film at Fleischer Studios.Culhane, Shamus. Talking Animals and Other People (Da Capo Press, 1998), p. 205. Gordon‚Äôs rewrites couldn‚Äôt save much of Gulliver, but Gordon was instrumental in the success of the Fleischer Studios‚Äô next hit: the 1941 Superman theatrical animated shorts. When Paramount seized control of the Fleischer studio in Miami, Gordon was one of four directors put in charge of production.Beck, Jerry. \\"Fleischer Becomes Famous Studios,\\" Cartoon Research. Retrieved June 7, 2011.. Gordon stayed only a couple years at the newly dubbed Famous Studios, but the few Popeye shorts he directed are remarkable for their manic intensity. The Hungry Goat, released in 1943, stands out as an attempt to bring a new, screwball character to the screen, heavily influenced by contemporary WB shorts. The fast-paced, hyper-kinetic, and over-caffeinated mayhem of those Popeye cartoons leads right into the comic book stories he crafted for The American Comics Group (ACG). Gordon was fired from Famous Studios in late 1943 or early 1944, presumably to alcohol- related problems.https://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/animation-profiles-dan- gordon/  Comic books  Superkatt and funny animals = Gordon was part of a group of animation pros led by Jim Davis (of Fox and Crow fame) that supplied original funny animal comic book stories to ACG and DC Comics. Gordon's work began appearing in Giggle Comics in 1944, and by Giggle #9, he introduced the long-running character Superkatt. Superkatt is a funny animal jab at the ‚Äúlong-underwear‚Äù genre of superhero comics. The title character does not have any super powers at all, but is a normal (talking) house cat that dresses in a diaper, a baby's bonnet, and a big blue bow to fight minor neighborhood injustices. In 1949 came Funny Films, a funny animal anthology title that tried to convince the reader that its stories were the filmed exploits of famous Hollywood cartoon characters. Gordon's Puss and Boots was a dog-and-cat version of Tom and Jerry on crack, with unbridled cartoon violence its only delicious theme. Gordon's other Funny Films character was the comical rabbit inventor Blunderbunny. In La Salle Comics' Hi-Jinx, he experimented with the hybrid idea of ‚Äúteenage animal funnies‚Äù. = Cookie O'Toole = Gordon's final major character from this era is Cookie O‚ÄôToole, the teenage star of Cookie comics. Cookie began his run in 1945 when he and his whole gang (best friend/hipster Jitterbuck, heartthrob Angelpuss, sharp-dressed rival Zoot, and their egghead pal, ‚ÄúThe Brain‚Äù) appeared fully formed in a one-shot issue of Topsy-Turvy Comics. By the next year, Cookie had his own title, and began a run that lasted nine years and 55 issues. Cookie is a rare example of a knock-off surpassing its inspiration. The explosive popularity of MLJ Comics‚Äô ‚ÄúArchie‚Äù in the mid-1940s gave birth to an entire comics genre: the teen humor comic. While the Archie gang is clearly more iconic and enduring than Cookie and his pals ever hope to be, the Cookie comics are a much more entertaining read. Gordon continued to make comics for ACG (and ACG imprints like La Salle) until he was called back into animation service by his old friend Joseph Barbera.  Hanna-Barbera  Bill Hanna and Joe Barbera had been creating the classic Tom and Jerry cartoons at MGM since 1940, but by 1957 the studio‚Äôs animation division was shut down.Markstein, Don. MGM entry, Don Markstein's Toonopedia. In a desperate bid to stay alive in the new TV era, Hanna and Barbera struck out on a foolhardy mission to make a weekly animated television series for a tiny fraction of their old Tom and Jerry budgets.Hanna, Bill. A Cast of Friends (Da Capo Press, 2000), p. 84. Gordon jumped on board to help out at Hanna-Barbera, and (with partner Charles Shows) was soon writing and drawing storyboards for most of the episodes of those earliest, foundational H-B cartoon classics:Adams, T.R. The Flintstones: A Modern Stone Age Phenomenon (Turner Publishing, 1994), p. 37. Huckleberry Hound, Yogi Bear, Pixie & Dixie, Quick Draw McGraw, and Augie Doggie. Emboldened by their early success in Saturday morning, Hanna and Barbera set their sights on producing a prime-time domestic comedy with a prehistoric twist. Gordon had some experience with cartoon cavemen, having worked on the ‚ÄúStone Age‚Äù series of animated shorts for Fleischer Studios back in 1940.\\"Stone Age\\", Big Cartoon Database. Accessed June 7, 2011. Although many talented people had a part in creating what would become The Flintstones, Bill Hanna generously points to Gordon. ‚ÄúNow you may not get the same response from anybody else, Bill Hanna recalls, ‚Äùbut to me, Dan Gordon is responsible for The Flintstones. He came up with the basic concept of doing it with cavemen in skins.‚ÄùBill Hanna, as quoted in Adams, p. 28. And Joe Barbera recounts in his autobiography that, ‚Äùthe first two Flintstones were the work of Dan Gordon and myself; I controlled the content, and Dan did the storyboards.‚ÄùBarbera, p. 136. Dan Gordon continued to work for Hanna-Barbera until his deathBill Hanna, as quoted in Adams, p. 37. in 1970.  Death  On August 13, 1970, exactly a month after Gordon's 68th birthday, Gordon passed away in a house fire while intoxicated. Some sources state his last known location was in Fulton County, Georgia, but the legitimacy of this information is unknown. Wife, Margaret Hannon, died at age of 39 in 1946 from brain cancer. Dan and Margaret had three sons. Son, Kevin, died in a house fire in Malibu, 1965. Son, Michael, died in 1965 in car accident in Los Angeles. Son, Donal, died in 1994 from cancer in Seattle. Dan Gordon died of liver disease while in nursing home in Atlanta, GA in 1970. Dan had five grandchildren from son Donal and wife, Frances. This information is cited by Granddaughter.  Legacy  Gordon's cartoons live on through sales of DVD reissues featuring many of his Superman and Popeye cartoons, and deluxe DVD sets of Huckleberry Hound and The Flintstones. Some of his work from the early Van Beuren Studios and Terrytoons days can be found on streaming video sites on the Internet. With the advent of eBay, online comic shops, and cartoon/comics blogs, today's Gordon fan has a decent chance of finding some of his comics at a reasonable cost. Well-worn back issues of Giggle, Ha-Ha, and Cookie comics are fairly easy to find, and many fans have been scanning and sharing these public-domain stories online.

HeatoN was the manager of NiP up until October 2018 when he decided to part ways with the organisation to focus on his own brand. He is widely considered one of the best Counter-Strike players of all time. Career The name HeatoN comes from a brand of equipment, which is now owned by CCM, he used when he played ice hockey. Emil's first hobby was ice hockey, but he retired because of an injury. A friend (CS player fRa1L, from RevolutioN) told him to try Counter-Strike. Christensen was part of the original Ninjas in Pyjamas team of 2001 which won the Cyberathlete Professional League World Championship that year. He and the other members of Ninjas in Pyjamas went on to become the foundation to the highly successful SK Sweden, one of the most successful teams in electronic sports history. Christensen led SK Gaming to the World Cyber Games Counter-Strike championship in 2003 and to 4th place in 2004. HeatoN and NiP competed in the World Series of Video Games. Christensen was nominated for Best Counter-Strike Player of the Year in 2004, losing out to SK Gaming teammate, Tommy \\"potti'\\" Ingemarsson. He was selected for the Global Gaming League European Counter-Strike All-Star team in 2005. At the beginning of 2005 he and the rest of SK Sweden chose not to renew their contracts with SK Gaming and re-formed NiP. Since then some of the NiP players moved back to SK Gaming but Christensen and others have stayed on at Ninjas in Pyjamas. NiP are now competing at professional LAN tournaments again, after a hiatus in which SpawN joined after HeatoN decided to take time off for personal reasons. Christensen, along with the other members of Ninjas in Pyjamas, assisted in the design of the SteelSound 5H (USB) Headphones produced by SteelSeries. In December 2006 he travelled to New York and Dallas to provide support for his teammates as they competed in the World Series of Video Games (WSVG) world finals and CPL winter respectively. NiP were expected to be strong contenders in both tournaments, however bowed out uncharacteristically early. In September 2007 HeatoN quit playing Counter- Strike to be coach of NiP but was then offered a chance to be a general manager for Stockholm in the Championship Gaming Series (CGS). HeatoN's CGS franchise was called the Stockholm Magnetik and had a Counter-Strike: Source team, one male and one female Dead or Alive 4 player, a FIFA 08 player, and two Forza Motorsport 2 players. After the CGS's folding in late 2008 Christensen moved to promote a computer hardware company named Qpad, from his native country Sweden, for the first part of 2009. Later in the year however, he left Qpad to join with his former teammate Abdisamad \\"SpawN\\" Mohamed in product development at ZOWIE GEAR which is a manufacturer of competitive gaming gear, founded late 2008. In July 2010, ZOWIE GEAR announced HeatoN's first series of mice co-developed by himself called EC after player's initials. In March 2012 ZOWIE GEAR announced a new version of the EC series, named the EC eVo series which features an improved optical sensor and was released in April. In 2012 Christensen returned to Ninjas in Pyjamas and became the organization's manager. In September 2015 Christensen and two other formers NiP owners were charged with misleading an auditor about Ninjas in Pyjamas AB's finances during its sale to Diglife. Christensen was found guilty of fraud, and was sentenced pay a fine and perform community service. In June 2016 HeatoN became the first person inducted into the ESL Hall of Fame. During the end of summer 2019 former and current players of Ninjas in Pyjamas stepped forward accusing Christensen and other leaders of the organisation of purposely withholding money from the players. According to players, the timeslot in which they were not paid was around the same time as the fraud took place 2013-2014 (sentenced 2015). The first player that stepped forward was Robin \\"Fifflaren\\" Johansson. Shortly there after a number of former NiP players further corroborated the allegations made by Johansson. Some of the other players among Johansson who stepped forward include Richard \\"Xizt\\" Landstr√∂m, Adam \\"friberg\\" Friberg, Christopher \\"GeT_RiGhT\\" Alesund and Patrik \\"f0rest\\" Lindberg.

The policy aimed to persuade the Soviet Union to co-operate in restraining revolutions in the Third World in return for concessions in nuclear and economic fields. Despite the lack of Soviet intervention, many revolutions still occurred in Third World countries, undermining the policy. The premise behind linkage, as a policy, was to connect political and military issues. This established a relationship making progress in area \\"A\\" dependent on progress in area \\"B.\\" An important aspect of the policy was that deviations from respecting the rights and interests would go punished. The intent of the action was to bring home to the offending state the limitations of acceptable international behaviour and demonstrate that attempts at expansion (and upsetting international stability) would go punished. This meant that conflict itself would contribute to stabilising the international order. The Nixon- Kissinger approach did not link foreign and domestic areas. Selective relaxation of tensions is an opposing policy to linkage. In that case, an issue of arms control could be addressed and tension diminished, with the status quo being maintained in other strategic areas.  Different uses of the term  There have been different uses of the term ‚Äòlinkage‚Äô in reference to both domestic and international policy making. There is often debate over the true meaning of the term. Historians and academics have portrayed the meaning of ‚Äòlinkage‚Äô in different lights. Common understandings of the term are that linkage means leverage ‚Äì the linking of one event to another in order to maintain bargaining power or pressure on the opposing party involved. Another description of linkage comes from Marvin Kalb and Bernard Kalb. They describe linkage as ‚Äúan up-to-date application of [Henry] Kissinger‚Äôs theories about balance of power.‚Äù Specific types of linkages can be coercive or cooperative. They can also be prospective, such as promises or threats, and they can be retrospective, such as rewards or retaliation. Since the 1970s, the term has been used to make reference to the influence and manipulation of US-Soviet and east‚Äìwest connections. An example of coercive linkage policy would be the US seeking to tie arms control progress to what they thought was acceptable behaviour in the Third World. This was based on the assumption that the Soviet Union wanted arms control more than the US did.  The politics of linkage  There are multiple theories behind linkage politics. The basic differences behind these theories are that the parties involved are either different or similar ‚Äì with respect to their issue positions. For those parties that are different, the politics of linkage are based on the assumption that governments or parties involved make decisions as trade-offs. Linkage is \\"established by the players‚Äô beliefs that cooperative behaviour in one setting influences the prospects for cooperation in other settings.\\" By connecting events or issues that are not necessarily connected in a particular way, governments can boost their political and economic situations by surrendering less important issues for those that have a greater, all-round importance. For those parties that are similar, linkage politics are based on the observation that mutually beneficial exchange is more prevalent between similar countries. One country would link positive incentives (such as technology transfers and arms control) to the expectation of the other country‚Äôs cooperation requital. With similar issues, it becomes more about bargaining power and convincing the other country involved that they are receiving something worthwhile in return.  Origin and setting  Linkage policy became significant during the time of d√©tente during the Cold War. This meant a relaxing of tensions, mainly between the East and the West. By 1971, the newly established Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev was ready to accept US ideas about relaxing tensions. This was for a number of reasons. The Soviet Union had issues with the Czechoslovakian Communist party in 1968 when their leader, Alexander Dubƒçek, created reforms encouraging free speech and democracy. This began a wave of demonstrations that promoted liberalisation, called the Prague Spring. On August 20, the USSR invaded Czechoslovakia to undo the reforms taking place. This created the Brezhnev Doctrine, which gave the Soviet Union its own right to intervene against counterrevolutionary behaviour. Fearing that this might apply to them, China provoked and engaged in conflict with the Soviets. Such conflicts forced the Soviets to scale back aggressiveness and \\"repair [their] image in the wake of the Prague Spring.\\" The fear of having poor relations with both the US and China was an incentive for the Soviets to seek d√©tente. Other incentives included the need for agricultural imports and access to better Western technology. The US and Soviet Union saw d√©tente differently. The US saw d√©tente as an encouragement of changes in Soviet Union domestic and foreign policy. The Soviets saw d√©tente as influencing only foreign policy, not domestic issues. What they did have in common was a shared interest in avoiding a nuclear war. They were also in agreement that east‚Äìwest competition would continue during this period of relaxed tensions. The problem arose when they was a lack of clarity in terms of how d√©tente would affect Third World involvement. The US mainly had issues with Soviet foreign policy in these areas. Henry Kissinger (US Secretary of State at the time) believed there were areas of congruent interests which would help to regulate competition between the US and the Soviet Union.  Nixon-Ford era (1969-1977)  During the Presidencies of both Richard Nixon and Gerald Ford, linkage diplomacy was used as a key foreign policy measure. It was particularly aimed at the Soviet Union. Henry Kissinger, who was Nixon's National Security Advisor, said that the aim of this policy was to \\"free [American] foreign policy from oscillations between overextension and isolation and to ground it in a firm conception of the national interest.\\" Richard Nixon (left) and Henry Kissinger (right) pictured together in February 1972, a few months before the signing of the SALT I agreement Following the signing of the Strategic Arms Limitation Talks (SALT) agreement in 1972, both the US and the Soviet Union agreed to practise mutual restraint. The terms of the agreement were vague. This meant that Nixon and Kissinger interpreted it as a justification of their own actions. As a result of this, part of this administrations perception of linkage was to convince Soviet leaders that they would have motivation for moderation, and also punishment for a contradiction of the previous agreements they had signed. Nixon and Kissinger also wanted to tie linkage to trade. As trade ties between the US and the Soviet Union increased, Kissinger aimed to convert these connections into political advantages. They wanted to make economic cooperation contingent on the evidence of progress in US foreign policy matters. If the Soviet Union made exceptions to issues they had with US foreign policy, the United States would grant them the most favoured nation (MFN) status. This administration aimed to use the growing economic relationship with the USSR as a ‚Äúcarrot for Soviet political behaviour.‚Äù Congressional intervention made it difficult for Nixon and Kissinger to implement linkage policy in the way they wanted to. The trade agreement that Nixon and Kissinger established was amended in 1974 under the Jackson-Vanik amendment. This linked the granting of the MFN status, instead, with increased Jewish emigration from the USSR. Such terms were found to be humiliating and unacceptable on the part of the Soviet Union. This made it difficult to finalise the agreement. Raymond Garthoff (US treaty adviser and former US ambassador to Bulgaria) said that the intervention by Congress spoiled Soviet expectations of economic benefits that had been promised by the Nixon government by making them dependent on Soviet internal affairs. Kissinger objected the intervention from Congress as he believed foreign issues are better resolved quietly than publicly in Congress. The success of quiet diplomacy can be seen in the following fact: in 1968 only 400 Jews were allowed to emigrate, but in 1973, nearly 35,000 were allowed to emigrate. Nixon and Kissinger were secretive in their policymaking. This was because they were suspicious of the bureaucracy. Decisions were made without the knowledge of William Rogers, who was the secretary of State at the time and responsible for the management of US diplomacy. Congress also grew suspicious and played a role in foreign policy as well. This secrecy and conflicting ideas made it difficult to gain concessions and make progress in foreign policy.  Jimmy Carter era (1977-1981)  While Nixon had the idea of championing Linkage policy during his time as president, Carter did not believe that linkage policy was the answer to cooling Soviet tensions early on in his presidency. He believed that the majority of his country's international concerns stemmed from the confrontational relationship between the US and the Soviet Union. This view was backed by the US Secretary of state Cyrus Vance. Carter also had no desire to engage in issues related to Soviet engagement in the Third World. Carter's National Security Advisor, Zbigniew Brzezinski, held a different view. He supported the employment of linkage diplomacy. Brzezinski believed that the correct answer to Soviet actions in the Third World was a \\"carefully calibrated policy of simultaneous competition and cooperation of its own, designed to promote a more comprehensive and more reciprocal d√©tente.\\" In 1978 Brzezinski strove to link developments in the SALT II negotiations to revised Soviet behaviour in Africa. The Ogaden War took place in 1977-78 between Ethiopia and Somalia. The US was allied to Ethiopia, and the Soviet Union was allied to Somalia. The Soviets had recently started constructing a military presence in Ethiopia, despite the US‚Äô previously established relationship. After efforts of mediation from the Soviet Union failed, Somalia cut all ties and its friendship treaty with the USSR in 1977. The Soviet Union increased its presence by sending 10,000 soldiers into the country by early 1978. Soviet involvement in this conflict created a setback in the US attempts to deal with instability in the third world, especially Africa. Following this, Brzezinski called for the delay of SALT II negotiations in retaliation. This would continue until the USSR complied with what the US perceived as acceptable conduct in the Third World. Vance tried to dampen the usage of linkage diplomacy. He suggested that a more suitable approach would be to accept that the US and the Soviet Union have competition, but not link Third World behaviour with important issues such as the SALT agreements. President Carter did not reject this, but said that the abuse of human rights and involvement in Africa would make it difficult to ratify the SALT agreement. In December 1979, the Soviet Union intervened in Afghanistan. The intervention was considered a ‚Äúblatant violation of accepted international rules of behaviour‚Äù by Carter. Another concern was the fall of the Shah in Iran in early 1979, and the perceived inability of the Carter administration to free the American hostages held there. This largely affected US policy and according to Brzezinski, led to the demise of d√©tente. Carter's national security advisor, Brzezinski, believed that the Soviet's found a sense of confidence and were emboldened by the US failure to react strongly to the USSR intervention of the Horn in 1978. He mentioned that this allowed them to be more aggressive in their foreign policy without the risk of US punishment. He believed linkage policy should have been developed and used more consistently throughout Carter's term as president. If this happened, the Soviet's would have been less adventurous in their exploration of the Third World, and the SALT negotiations could have been saved. Following this, the US imposed sanctions on the Soviet Union including a grain embargo and a ban on the transfer of technology.  Looking back after the Cold War  There are multiple arguments as to whether linkage diplomacy had achieved its objectives by the end of the Cold War. Samuel Makinda states three reasons against the success of linkage policy. These include conceptual problems, unsolicited interference in Soviet internal affairs, and Soviet intervention due to American disenchantment.  Conceptual problems  The Basic Principles agreement was the basis on which Linkage policy was first imposed. The agreement was vague and not very specific. This meant that each country interpreted the agreement in their own way. This was the conceptual problem. For example, the US wanted ‚Äòunilateral advantage‚Äô in the Middle East but did not involve the Soviet Union in the Egyptian-Israeli peace process. But when the Soviets wanted ‚Äòunilateral advantage‚Äô in Africa, the US wanted to punish them.  Soviet internal affairs  The US wanted to link their own issues with Soviet domestic policies. The SALT I agreement between the US and the Soviet Union in 1972 and the Basic Principles Agreement did not involve issues related to domestic policies. When the US did attempt to affect domestic policy in the Soviet Union, the Soviet leaders regarded it as interfering in their internal affairs in an attempt to undermine their leadership.  US disenchantment  The US had disenchanted some countries in its attempt to deal with Soviet aggressiveness and expansion. For example, Ethiopia became disenchanted after developments in the Ogaden War. Angola also became disenchanted because they could not get US support due to their ideological inclinations. This meant that Soviet intervention in Africa was partly because these disenchanted countries invited them.

Overview As a category, libertarian fiction is unusual because the vast majority of its authors are self-identified as science fiction authors. This contrasts with the authors of much other social criticism who are largely academic or mainstream novelists who tend to dismiss any genre classification. The identification between libertarianism and science fiction is so strong that the U.S. Libertarian Party often has representatives at science fiction conventions and one of the highest profile authors currently in the subgenre of libertarian science fiction, L. Neil Smith, was the Arizona Libertarian Party's 2000 candidate for the President of the United States. As a genre, it can be seen as growing out of the 1930s and 1940s when the science-fiction pulp magazines were reaching their peak at the same time as fascism and communism. While this environment gave rise to dystopian novels, in the pulps, this influence more often give rise to speculations about societies (or sub-groups) arising in direct opposition to \\"totalitarianism\\". Ayn Rand's novel Atlas Shrugged is a strong (perhaps the strongest) influence with an anti-socialist attitude and an individualist ethic that echoes throughout the genre. Of more direct relevance to the science fiction end of this genre is the work of Robert A. Heinlein, particularly his novel The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress, which is highly regarded even by non-libertarian science fiction readers. Some other prominent libertarian science fiction authors include S. Andrew Swann and Michael Z. Williamson. An award for libertarian science fiction, the Prometheus Award, is given out every year. Some winners of the award identify as libertarians (e.g., L. Neil Smith, Victor Koman, Brad Linaweaver), while others do not (Terry Pratchett, Charles Stross).  Notable examples  * Ayn Rand, Atlas Shrugged * L. Neil Smith, The Probability Broach * Kenneth W. Royce, Molon Labe! * Victor Koman, Kings of the High Frontier * Robert A. Heinlein, The Moon Is a Harsh Mistress * J. Neil Schulman, Alongside Night See also * Anarcho-capitalist literature Notes :In the novel, the inhabitants of the Lunar colony start a revolution against Earth rule and declare independence on July 4, 2076, the 300th anniversary of the United States' Declaration of Independence. The Lunar revolutionaries heavily base their Luna declaration of independence on it. A common expression on Luna that states one of the main ideas of the book's political system is \\"There Ain't No Such Thing As A Free Lunch!\\".

Calculation Equations derived from spherical trigonometry allow for the conversion from equatorial coordinates to ecliptic coordinates. As points in the ecliptic have no latitude (=0¬∫) and the East point of the horizon has a right ascension 6h higher than that of the meridian (or 90¬∫ more in hour angle), the equation that determines East Point's longitude can be written as: :\\\\tan\\\\lambdaEP = {\\\\tan(\\\\theta_{\\\\rm L}+90^\\\\circ)\\\\over \\\\cos\\\\varepsilon}\\\\Leftrightarrow\\\\lambdaEP = \\\\arctan\\\\left({-1\\\\over \\\\tan(\\\\theta_{\\\\rm L}) \\\\cos\\\\varepsilon}\\\\right) where \\\\theta_{\\\\rm L} is the local sidereal time and \\\\varepsilon is the obliquity of the ecliptic. , chap. 12 The equation can also be derived from the Ascendant at the equator (\\\\phi=0¬∫).

From 1986 to 1991, he was the chairman of the Thai Nation Party and served as the Prime Minister of Thailand from August 1988 until the coup d'√©tat of February 1991. Family Chatichai was the only son of Field Marshal Phin Choonhavan and Khunying Wibunlak Choonhavan. He was of Thai Chinese descent with ancestry from Chenghai District of Shantou City, Guangdong Province, China.Close bond with China inherited from ancestors His father was the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Army from 1948 to 1954 and exerted a strong influence on the country's politics and economy. Chatichai had four sisters. The eldest was married to General Phao Siyanon, who was one of Thailand's strongmen during the 1950s. Another sister married Pramarn Adireksarn, who later became Chatichai's political ally. Chatichai married Boonruen Sopoj, a relative and confidante of Princess Mother Srinagarindrathe mother of kings Ananda Mahidol and Bhumibol Adulyadej. Chatichai and Boonruen had two children, daughter Wanee Hongpraphas, and their son political scientist, social activist, and former senator Kraisak Choonhavan. The former deputy prime minister Korn Dapparansi is his nephew. Education, military and diplomatic career Chatichai studied at Debsirin School, a long-standing, prestigious, all-boys school in Bangkok, and at the Chulachomklao Royal Military Academy. He entered active military service as second lieutenant and cavalry platoon leader in 1940. During World War II, he was assigned to the Phayap Army (\\"Northwest Army\\"), under the command of his father Phin, and participated in the invasion of the Shan States of Burma. After the war, he continued his training at the Thai Army Cavalry School and the United States Army Armor School in Fort Knox, Kentucky. In 1949, he was appointed military attach√© in Washington, DC. At the age of 31, Chatichai was a major-general. In 1951, the military, led by Chatichai's father and his brother-in-law, Phao Siyanon, effectively assumed power in Thailand in a \\"silent coup\\". They used their political influence to extend their activities to the economic sphere. Chatichai served in the Korean War as the commander of the 1st Cavalry Battalion. Then, he became director and commander of the Thai Army Armor School. In 1957, Field Marshal Sarit Thanarata rival of Chatichai's father and brother-in-lawstaged a coup d'√©tat against the government of Prime Minister Plaek Phibunsongkhram. He ousted the Phin-Phao clique and filled the important political and military posts with his own followers. The new regime accused the Choonhavan clan (also known as the Soi Rajakru clan, after the family's residence) of having embezzled millions of dollars of public funds and hiding them in Swiss bank accounts. This ended Chatichai's military career. Chatichai was transferred to the diplomatic service and assigned to the relatively unimportant post of ambassador to Argentina. During the following years he consecutively served as the Thai ambassador to Austria, Switzerland, Turkey, Yugoslavia, the Holy See and the United Nations. In 1972, he returned to Bangkok to become the director of the Foreign Ministry's political department. Political career Chatichai in 1974 In the government of Field Marshal Thanom Kittikachorn, Chatichai was appointed deputy minister of foreign affairs in 1972. During the hostage-taking in the Israeli embassy by a terrorist commando of the Palestinian Black September organisation in December 1972, he and the Agriculture Minister Dawee Chullasapya negotiated with the terrorists. In exchange for the release of the Israeli diplomats, they lent themselves as guarantees and accompanied the terrorists on their freedom flight to Cairo. Chatichai continued as deputy foreign minister after the 1973 democratic uprising, serving in the interim cabinet of Sanya Dharmasakti. In December 1973, one and a half years before Thailand officially established diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China, Chatichai and Daweewho was then minister of defencewere the first Thai government officials to visit Beijing. There, they negotiated a contract for the supply of 50,000 tons of diesel oil at a \\"friendship price\\" and promised to remove trade barriers between the two nations. In 1974, Chatichai and his in-laws Pramarn Adireksarn and Siri Siriyothinalso major generalsfounded the conservative and aggressively anti-communist Thai Nation Party (Chart Thai). It ran in the January 1975 general election, the first democratic election after the end of military dictatorship, and became the third-strongest party. Chatichai was elected member of parliament, representing a constituency in Nakhon Ratchasima Province. The Thai Nation Party joined a government coalition under Kukrit Pramoj. Chatichai served as minister of foreign affairs from 17 March 1975 to 21 April 1976. After the snap election in April 1976, in which the Thai Nation Party expanded its share of seats significantly, he was minister of industry in the government of Seni Pramoj until it was overthrown by a military coup d'√©tat after the Thammasat University massacre of 6 October 1976. From 1980 to 1983, Chatichai served as industry minister under Prime Minister Prem Tinsulanonda. After three years of opposition, the party returned to government and Chatichai was deputy prime minister under Prem. Premiership President George Bush and Prime Minister Chatichai Choonhavan at the White House in 1990left The Thai Nation Party won the most votes in the 1988 Thai general election, resulting in Chatichai being appointed prime minister on 4 August 1988. This made him the first democratically elected head of government after 12 years of dictatorship and \\"semi-democracy\\". His government improved relations with communist-ruled Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, which had been Thailand's enemies during the Cold War. It promoted international trade with these countries and others. Chatichai's slogan was to turn Indochina \\"from a battlefield into a marketplace\\". It also supported the Sihanouk-led Government of Cambodia. Chatichai's government initiated many infrastructure projects, including an expansion of the telecommunications network in partnership with the state-owned Telephone Organization of Thailand (TOT), development of the Eastern Seaboard of Thailand, and road and rail networks in partnership with the Mass Rapid Transit Authority (MRTA) in the Greater Bangkok Area. During Chatichai's premiership, Thailand's economy saw annual growth rates of up to 13 percent. Under Chatichai's government, there was rampant corruption. The parties and politicians in Chatichai's coalition scrambled overtly over the distribution of public funds. The Thai press dubbed them the \\"buffet cabinet\\", referring to their \\"take-what-you-like\\" mentality. Chatichai's standard answer whenever he was confronted by the press with difficulties or corruption allegations against members of his government was \\"no problem\\". A parody variant, \\"no plomplam\\", became the title of a popular song by folk rock singer Aed Carabao and entered Thai common parlance. Chatichai was heavily criticised when he tried to downplay the damage caused by Typhoon Gay, which resulted in 360 deaths, in the same way. The formerly right-wing Thai Nation Party had de- ideologized itself and now represented the interests of the rising class of provincial businessmen. It pursued policies that boosted their businesses and involved them in lucrative government contracts. It advocated a reinforcement of the role of parliament, in which politicians from the provinces were strongly represented, in contrast with the unelected power elites in the administration and military which had made political decisions during the tenure of Chatichai's predecessor, Prem Tinsulanonda. Chatichai's government emphasised the economic development of the periphery at the expense of Bangkok's big businesses and military expenditures, which it tried to cut. These policies challenged the country's traditional elites. Disempowerment and return On 23 February 1991, the Commander-in-Chief of the Royal Thai Army, General Sunthorn Kongsompong, and the generals of the Chulalongkorn Military Academy class 5, Suchinda Kraprayoon, Issarapong Noonpakdi, and Kaset Rojananil, formed the National Peace Keeping Council to depose Chatichai's government in a coup d'√©tat. They accused the elected government of massive corruption and abuse of power for its own advantage. They charged several cabinet members, including Chatichai, with \\"unusual wealth\\". At the same time, they acted in the interest of the traditional elite of the bureaucracy, military and Bangkokian business circles, whose influence the Chatichai government had sought to curtail. The coup group called the form of governance under Chatichai \\"parliamentary dictatorship\\" and alleged a moral decline. Chatichai temporarily went into exile in the United Kingdom. After his return, he continued his political activity. After the 1992 Black May, he founded the National Development Party and was again elected in his constituency in Nakhon Ratchasima. Personal life Chatichai was known for his fondness of cigars, fine wines, and Harley-Davidson motorcycles. Even in old age, he practised several sports and visited parties and discoth√®ques, earning him a reputation of being a playboy. On 6 May 1998, at the age of 78, Chatichai died from liver cancer in a hospital in London.

It is the sequel to the 1988 Robert Altman-directed and Garry Trudeau-written miniseries about a failed presidential candidate, Tanner '88. The sequel focuses mostly on Alex Tanner (Cynthia Nixon), a struggling filmmaker and the daughter of onetime presidential candidate Jack Tanner (Michael Murphy). Episodes * \\"Dinner at Elaine's\\" (October 5, 2004) * \\"Boston or Bust\\" (October 12, 2004) * \\"Alex in Wonderland\\" (October 19, 2004) * \\"The Awful Truth\\" (October 26, 2004) Plot Alex Tanner is working on a documentary about her father's run for president in 1988. After her documentary, My Candidate, is met with an underwhelming response at an independent film festival, Robert Redford advises her that her film is lacking and that she should do follow-ups with all the people from the 1988 campaign to see what they are doing now, and get their reflections on their past roles. Alex does just this, interviewing most of the old campaign staffers and her father before going to the 2004 Democratic Convention in Boston with her film crew to compare and contrast it with the 1988 Democratic National Convention where her father lost the nomination. Along the way, one of her crew members, Salim (Aasif Mandvi), is repeatedly stopped and frisked by police because of his Arab ethnicity. There she meets up with TJ, her father's old campaign manager, who is now advising John Kerry. While TJ provides assistance to Alex, she also advises Jack that he is being considered for a position in the administration, should Kerry win the election. She says he would need to make sure footage from Alex's documentary of him attacking the Iraq War is removed and destroyed, so as not to potentially embarrass Kerry. Jack asks Alex to remove and destroy the footage, which she considers the best part of her documentary. Alex becomes very upset and disillusioned with her father. (It is also implied that she has had a falling out with him.) She eventually destroys her whole film, looking to move on with her life.

His aesthetic style is in line with that of the Sturm und Drang \\"movement\\" of German art and literature. Biography Holzbauer was born in Vienna. Despite the opposition of his parents, who intended him for the law, he studied music, and in 1745 became kapellmeister to Count Rottal and at the Court Theatre of Vienna. Later he was kapellmeister at Stuttgart, Germany. His operas include Il figlio delle selve, which was the opening performance of the Schlosstheater Schwetzingen in 1753. Its success led to a job offer from the court at Mannheim, Germany, where he stayed for the rest of his life, continuing to compose and to teach, his students including Johann Anton Friedrich Fleischmann (1766‚Äì1798), the pianist, and Carl Stamitz. Holzbauer died in Mannheim, having been entirely deaf for some years. His opera G√ºnther von Schwarzburg, based on the life of the eponymous king (and described here), was an early German national opera, a performance of which Mozart and his sister attended, through which they met Anton Raaff, who was later to premiere a role in Idomeneo. This opera has recently been recorded on the label cpo. Holzbauer wrote 196 symphonies. Mozart also composed nine numbers for insertion in a Miserere by Holzbauer on commission by the Parisian Concert Spirituel in 1778, but they have been lost. They have been given the catalog number KV 297a in the list of Mozart's works.

It is led by the Prime Minister of Singapore who is the head of government. The Prime Minister is a Member of Parliament (MP) appointed by the President who selects a person that in his or her view is likely to command the confidence of a majority of the Parliament of Singapore. The other members of the Cabinet are Ministers who are Members of Parliament appointed by the President on the Prime Minister's advice. Cabinet members are prohibited from holding any office of profit and from actively engaging in any commercial enterprise. The Cabinet generally directs and controls the Government and is collectively responsible to Parliament. It also has significant influence over lawmaking. Ministers may be designated by the Prime Minister to be in charge of particular ministries, or as Ministers in the Prime Minister's Office. Singapore's ministers are the highest paid in the world. Prior to a salary review in 2011, the Prime Minister's annual salary was S$3.07 million, while the pay of ministerial-grade officers ranged between S$1.58 million and S$2.37 million. On 21 May 2011, a committee was appointed by the Prime Minister to review the salaries of the Prime Minister as well as the President, political appointment holders, and Members of Parliament. Following the recommended wage reductions by the committee which were then debated and subsequently accepted in Parliament, the Prime Minister's salary was reduced by 36% (includes the removal of his pension) to S$2.2 million (then about US$1.7 million). Nonetheless, the Prime Minister remains the highest-paid political leader in the world. The earliest predecessor of the Cabinet was the Executive Council of the Straits Settlements, introduced in 1877 to advise the Governor of the Straits Settlements. It wielded no executive power. In 1955, a Council of Ministers was created, made up of three ex officio Official Members and six Elected Members of the Legislative Assembly of Singapore, appointed by the Governor on the recommendation of the Leader of the House. Following the general elections that year, David Saul Marshall became the first Chief Minister of Singapore. Constitutional talks between Legislative Assembly representatives and the Colonial Office were held from 1956 to 1958, and Singapore gained full internal self-government in 1959. The Governor was replaced by the Yang di- Pertuan Negara, who had power to appoint to the post of Prime Minister the person most likely to command the authority of the Assembly, and other Ministers of the Cabinet on the Prime Minister's advice. In the 1959 general elections, the People's Action Party swept to power with 43 out of the 51 seats in the Assembly, and Lee Kuan Yew became the first Prime Minister of Singapore. The executive branch of the Singapore Government remained unchanged following Singapore's merger with Malaysia in 1963, and subsequent independence in 1965. Following the 2020 general election, a Cabinet slight rearrangement took place for the \\"4G\\" leaders to experience different ministries effective 27 July 2020 with 37 political office holders, the same as the previous cabinet. Heng Swee Keat took up an additional role as Coordinating Minister for Economic Policies while maintaining his other appointments. Lee Hsien Loong, Teo Chee Hean, Tharman Shanmugaratnam, Ng Eng Hen, Vivian Balakrishnan, Gan Kim Yong, K. Shanmugam, Josephine Teo, and Chan Chun Sing will be retaining their positions with no new appointments. Lawrence Wong, Masagos Zulkifli, Grace Fu, Desmond Lee and Ong Ye Kung were also reshuffled to a new ministry as minister. Indranee Rajah was also reshuffled into a new ministry as second minister while maintaining her role as Minister in the Prime Minister's Office. Maliki Osman and Edwin Tong were both promoted to a minister position. Tan See Leng was newly appointed into the cabinet as both a minister and second minister. History Up to the outbreak of World War II, Singapore was part of the Crown colony known as the Straits Settlements together with Malacca and Penang. The earliest predecessor of the Cabinet was arguably the Executive Council of the Straits Settlements that was introduced in 1877 by letters patent issued by the Crown,Letters patent dated 17 November 1877. though its function was very different from that of today's Cabinet. The council, which was composed of \\"such persons and constituted in such manner as may be directed\\" by royal instructions,1877 letters patent, Art. II. existed to advise the Governor of the Straits Settlements and wielded no executive power. The Governor was required to consult the Executive Council on all affairs of importance unless they were too urgent to be laid before it, or if reference to it would prejudice the public service. In such urgent cases, the Governor had to inform the Council of the measures he had taken... Sir William Cleaver Francis Robinson (1834‚Äì1897), the Governor of the Straits Settlements when the Executive Council of the Straits Settlements was introduced in 1877 Following the Second World War, the Straits Settlements were disbanded and Singapore became a Crown colony in its own right.By the Straits Settlements (Repeal) Act 1946 (9 & 10 Geo. VI, c. 37) and the Singapore Order-in-Council 1946, S. R. & O., 1946, No. 462 (UK), dated 27 March 1946. The reconstituted Executive Council consisted of six officials and four nominated \\"unofficials\\".Tan, \\"A Short Legal and Constitutional History of Singapore\\", p. 41. In February 1954, the Rendel Constitutional Commission under the chairmanship of Sir George William Rendel, which had been appointed to comprehensively review the constitution of the Colony of Singapore, rendered its report. Among other things, it recommended that a Council of Ministers be created, composed of three ex officio Official Members and six Elected Members of the Legislative Assembly of Singapore appointed by the Governor on the recommendation of the Leader of the House, who would be the leader of the largest political party or coalition of parties having majority support in the legislature. The recommendation was implemented in 1955.By the Singapore Colony Order-in-Council 1955, S.I. 1955, No. 187 (UK). In the general election held that year, the Labour Front took a majority of the seats in the Assembly, and David Saul Marshall became the first Chief Minister of Singapore. Major problems with the Rendel Constitution were that the Chief Minister and Ministers' powers were ill-defined, and that the Official Members retained control of the finance, administration, and internal security and law portfolios. This led to confrontation between Marshall, who saw himself as a Prime Minister governing the country, and the Governor, Sir John Fearns Nicoll, who felt that important decisions and policies should remain with himself and the Official Members..Tan, \\"A Short Legal and Constitutional History of Singapore\\", pp. 42‚Äì43. Lee Kuan Yew, who was elected the first Prime Minister of Singapore in 1959, in a 2005 photograph In 1956, members of the Legislative Assembly held constitutional talks with the Colonial Office in London. The talks broke down as Marshall did not agree to the British Government's proposal for the casting vote on a proposed Defence Council to be held by the British High Commissioner to Singapore, who would only exercise it in an emergency. Marshall resigned as Chief Minister in June 1956, and was replaced by Lim Yew Hock.. The following year, Lim led another delegation to the UK for further talks on self-government. This time, agreement was reached on the composition of an Internal Security Council.Turnbull, p. 264. Other constitutional arrangements were swiftly settled in 1958, and on 1 August the Parliament of the United Kingdom passed the State of Singapore Act 1958,State of Singapore Act 1958 (6 & 7 Eliz. II, c. 59, UK). granting the colony full internal self-government. Under Singapore's new constitution which came into force on 3 June 1959,Singapore (Constitution) Order-in-Council 1958, S.I. 1958, No. 156 (UK). the Governor was replaced by the Yang di-Pertuan Negara (Head of State), who had power to appoint as Prime Minister the person most likely to command the authority of the Legislative Assembly, and other Ministers of the Cabinet on the Prime Minister's advice.Singapore (Constitution) Order-in-Council 1958 (UK), Art. 21. The Constitution also created the post of the British High Commissioner,Singapore (Constitution) Order-in-Council 1958 (UK), Arts. 15‚Äì19. who was entitled to receive the agenda of each Cabinet meeting and to see all Cabinet papers. In the 1959 general elections, the People's Action Party (PAP) swept to power with 43 out of the 51 seats in the Assembly, and Lee Kuan Yew became the first Prime Minister of Singapore. Nine other Ministers were appointed to the Cabinet.Tan, \\"A Short Legal and Constitutional History of Singapore\\", pp. 44‚Äì45. The British High Commissioner's role became that of an ambassador following Singapore's independence from Britain and merger with Malaysia in 1963. Apart from that the executive branch of the Singapore Government remained largely unchanged,Tan, \\"A Short Legal and Constitutional History of Singapore\\", p. 46. although now it governed a state within a larger federation. However, with effect from 9 August 1965, Singapore left the Federation of Malaysia and became a fully independent republic. On separation from Malaysia, the Singapore Government retained its executive authority, and the executive authority of the Parliament of Malaysia ceased to extend to Singapore and vested in the Singapore Government.Constitution and Malaysia (Singapore Amendment) Act 1965 (No. 53 of 1965) (Malaysia), ss. 4 and 5. The Yang di- Pertuan Agong, the Supreme Head of State of Malaysia, also ceased to be the Supreme Head of Singapore and relinquished his sovereignty, jurisdiction, power and authority, executive or otherwise in respect of Singapore, which revested in the Yang di-Pertuan Negara of Singapore.Constitution and Malaysia (Singapore Amendment) Act 1965 (Malaysia), s. 6. The Republic of Singapore Independence Act 1965, s. 4. then vested the executive authority of Singapore in the newly created post of President, and made it exercisable by him or by the Cabinet or by any Minister authorized by the Cabinet. Structure of government Singapore inherited a Westminster system of government from the British. In such systems, there is an overlap between the executive and legislative branches of government. The head of state, who is the President of Singapore, is a member of both the executive Government of Singapore and the Parliament of Singapore but plays a minimal role in them. Executive power lies in the hands of the Cabinet, which is made up of the Prime Minister of Singapore (the head of government) and other Ministers., Art. 24(1). At the same time, the Prime Minister and Ministers are also Members of Parliament (MPs). Following constitutional reforms in 1991, the office of President was transformed from an appointed to an elected post. Thus, both the President and MPs are elected to their posts by the citizens of Singapore in separate elections.Constitution, Arts. 17(2) (\\"The President shall be elected by the citizens of Singapore in accordance with any law made by the Legislature.\\") and 39(1) (\\"Parliament shall consist of ‚Äì (a) such number of elected Members as is required to be returned at a general election by the constituencies prescribed by or under any law made by the Legislature; (b) such other members ... who shall be known as non-constituency Members ...; and (c) such other Members ... who shall be known as nominated Members ...\\" The procedure for elections is governed by the and the . Appointment of Cabinet Tony Tan, a former President of Singapore, in 2011 The President appoints as Prime Minister an MP who, in his judgment, is likely to command the confidence of the majority of the MPs.Singapore Constitution, Art. 25(1). In practice, the Prime Minister is usually the leader of the political party holding the majority of the seats in Parliament.. The President also appoints other Ministers to the Cabinet from among the MPs, acting in accordance with the Prime Minister's advice. Any MP, including a Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP) or a Nominated Member of Parliament (NMP), may be appointed a Minister. Thus it is possible for a person who was not elected by voters to be appointed by Parliament as an NMP, then by the President as a Minister. In 1990, then Deputy Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong said in Parliament: \\"I would rather that a government has the flexibility to appoint the right person to be the minister for finance, than to compel that government to select from whoever is available in the House.\\"Speech of the First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence Goh Chok Tong on the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Amendment) Bill, Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (29 March 1990), vol. 55, col. 1045. However, he added that the Government had no intention to appoint a Cabinet minister from among the NMPs at that time. In May 2009, MP Hri Kumar proposed during a Parliamentary debate that this stand be reconsidered as the Prime Minister would be able to draw on the experience of many capable Singaporeans. He expressed the view that this would not offend democratic principles. Singapore's Parliamentary system placed more weight on the party in power rather than individual MPs, and \\"Parliamentarians must still win the support from the ground and, ultimately, the PM and the ruling party and his Cabinet team will still be answerable to the electorate at elections.\\"Speech of MP Hri Kumar Nair on the President's Address, Singapore Parliamentary Debates, Official Report (26 May 2009), vol. 86 (no column numbers assigned yet). Critics have commented that adopting the practice would disenchant Singaporeans, deepen the already parochial political culture, and lead to a lack of accountability and legitimacy.. Before entering on the duties of their office, the Prime Minister and other Ministers must take and subscribe (sign) the Oath of Allegiance and an oath for the due execution of their offices before the President.Constitution. Art. 27. The Oath of Allegiance reads as follows: The oath for the due execution of the office of Prime Minister or a Minister is as follows: Cabinet members are prohibited from holding any office of profit or actively engaging in any commercial enterprise.Constitution, Art. 33. In addition, they are required to comply with a Code of Conduct for Ministers.. For example, to counter potential allegations of corruption and unexplained wealth and to avoid potential conflicts between private interests and public responsibilities, the Code requires every Minister, upon appointment to office, to disclose in confidence to the President through the Prime Minister all sources of income other than his salary as a Minister and as an MP. This must include all assets, such as financial assets, real property, interests in any company or professional practice, and any other substantial personal assets as well as financial liabilities, including mortgages and borrowings.Code of Conduct for Ministers, para. 1.1. A Minister must also \\"scrupulously avoid any actual or apparent conflict of interest between his office and his private financial interests\\".Code of Conduct for Ministers, para. 3.1. Thus, a Minister is not permitted to accept any favour of any kind from persons in negotiation with, or seeking to obtain any licence or enter into any contractual relations with, the Government,Code of Conduct for Ministers, para. 3.4. or to use official information that comes to him as a Minister for his own private profit or the profit of any family member or associate.Code of Conduct for Ministers, para. 3.5. Vacation of office The President must declare the office of Prime Minister vacant if the Prime Minister resigns his office, or if the President, acting in his discretion, is satisfied that the Prime Minister has ceased to command the confidence of a majority of the MPs. In the latter situation, the President is required first to inform the Prime Minister of his evaluation in this regard, and if the Prime Minister requests him to, the President may dissolve Parliament instead of making a declaration of vacancy.Constitution, Art. 26(1). A general election must be held within three months after the dissolution of Parliament.Constitution, Art. 66. This gives the former Prime Minister the opportunity to consolidate support by receiving a fresh mandate at the polls. At present, it is not clear what evidence the President may rely on to be satisfied that the Prime Minister has ceased to command the confidence of a majority of MPs, as the Singapore courts have not yet had to decide the issue. In the Sarawak case of Stephen Kalong Ningkan v. Tun Abang Haji Openg,Stephen Kalong Ningkan v. Tun Abang Haji Openg [1966] 2 M.L.J. [Malayan Law Journal] 187, declining to apply the approach taken by the Privy Council on appeal from Nigeria in . See also . decided on provisions similar to those in the Singapore Constitution, the court found that the phrase ceased to command the confidence of a majority of the Members of Parliament was a term of art which had to be signified by a formal vote of no confidence taken by the legislature. In contrast, a Sabah court held in Datuk Amir Kahar v. Tun Mohd Said bin Keruak, Yang di-Pertua Negeri SabahDatuk Amir Kahar v. Tun Mohd Said bin Keruak, Yang di-Pertua Negeri Sabah [1995] 1 M.L.J. 169. that loss of confidence could be assessed on the basis of evidence other than a legislative vote.Thio, \\"The Constitutional Framework of Powers\\", p. 85. This might include, for instance, media reports or letters addressed to the President. Other Cabinet ministers must vacate their office if they resign, or if their appointments are revoked by the President acting in accordance with the advice of the Prime Minister.Constitution, Art. 26(2). A person who has vacated his or her office as Minister may, if qualified, be subsequently appointed again as a Minister.Constitution, Art. 26(3). The Prime Minister and other Ministers who make up the Cabinet do not vacate their offices upon a dissolution of Parliament, but continue in their posts until the first sitting of the next Parliament following a general election.Art. 26 of the Constitution does not list the dissolution of Parliament as a ground on which the Prime Minister and a minister must vacate their offices. In addition, Art. 25(2) states that an MP may be appointed as Prime Minister by the President when Parliament is dissolved, but that MP shall not continue to hold office after the first sitting of the next Parliament unless he is also an MP of that Parliament. Responsibilities and remuneration The Cabinet is headed by the Prime Minister, Lee Hsien Loong, photographed here on 21 November 2004 The executive authority of Singapore is vested in the President and is exercisable by him or by the Cabinet of Singapore or any Minister authorized by the Cabinet.Constitution, Art. 23(1). However, the President normally plays a nominal and largely ceremonial role in the executive branch of government. Although the President acts in his personal discretion in the exercise of certain functions as a check on the Cabinet and Parliament of Singapore,See, generally, Art. 21(2) of the Constitution. he is otherwise required to act in accordance with the advice of the Cabinet or of a Minister acting under the general authority of the Cabinet.Constitution, Art. 21(1). It is the Cabinet that has the general direction and control of the Government.Constitution, Art. 24(2). As Singapore follows the Westminster system of government, the legislative agenda of Parliament is determined by the Cabinet. At the start of each new Parliamentary session, the President gives an address prepared by the Cabinet that outlines what the Cabinet intends to achieve in the session., Orders 15(1) (\\"At the conclusion of the President's speech delivered at the opening of any session, Parliament shall stand adjourned without any question being put. The Leader of the House shall give two clear days' notice naming an ordinary sitting day, not less than two clear days after the day on which the speech was delivered, for the next sitting of Parliament, and Parliament shall sit on the day stated in such notice.\\") and 15(2) (\\"Such notice shall also give notice for such sitting day, of a motion to be moved by a Minister or other Member named by the Leader of the House that an Address expressing the thanks of Parliament for the speech of the President be agreed to. Debate thereon shall be confined to the policy of the Government as outlined in the speech.\\"). See also Singapore Constitution, Art. 62: \\"The President may address Parliament and may send messages thereto.\\" Under the Constitution, the Cabinet is collectively responsible to Parliament. In theory, Parliament acts as a check on the power of the Cabinet as Ministers are required to justify their actions and policies upon being questioned by MPs. However, in Singapore this is a weak check because the ruling People's Action Party holds a large Parliamentary majority, and party members who are MPs are required by party discipline to vote according to the party Whip's instructions. The Cabinet may not be summoned except by the authority of the Prime Minister.Constitution, Art. 28(1). As far as is practicable, the Prime Minister is required to attend and preside at Cabinet meetings, but in his absence he may appoint another Minister to preside.Constitution, Art. 28(2). Whenever the Prime Minister is ill, absent from Singapore, or has been granted leave of absence from his duties, the functions conferred on him by the Constitution are exercisable by any other Minister authorized by the President.Constitution, Art. 26(4)(a). The President may revoke any such authority: Art. 26(4)(b). In general, the President must act in accordance with the Prime Minister's advice in appointing a Minister for this purpose. However, the President may act in his own discretion if in his opinion it is impracticable to obtain the advice of the Prime Minister due to his illness or absence.Constitution, Art. 26(4)(c). Responsibilities of Ministers The Prime Minister may, by giving written directions, charge any Minister with responsibility for any department or subject.Constitution, Art. 30(1). In practice, this is done by issuing notifications that are published in the Government Gazette. For instance, the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Responsibility of Senior Minister and Co-ordinating Minister for National Security, Prime Minister's Office) Notification 2009Constitution of the Republic of Singapore (Responsibility of Senior Minister and Co-ordinating Minister for National Security, Prime Minister's Office) Notification 2009 (S 142/2009). states: Ministers may be designated by the Prime Minister to be in charge of particular ministries, or as Ministers in the Prime Minister's Office. Such Ministers were formerly known as Ministers without portfolio. The Prime Minister may retain any department or subject in his charge.Constitution, Art. 30(2). RemunerationBefore 2010= In 1994, then Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong received a monthly salary of nearly S$96,000 (about $1.15 million a year), while other ministers earned about $48,900 a month ($586,800 a year). This made them among the highest paid government ministers in the world.. In October that year, the Government issued a white paper entitled Competitive Salaries for Competent & Honest Government. which proposed that the salaries of ministers and civil servants be pegged at two-thirds the average principal earned income of the top four earners in six professions: accounting, banking, engineering, law, local manufacturing firms and multinational corporations. These professions were chosen because their top members had general management skills which ministers also had to have. According to the white paper, the one-third \\"discount\\" would be \\"a visible demonstration of the sacrifice involved in becoming a minister\\". Although \\"[s]alaries should never be the motivation for persons to become ministers\\", the financial sacrifice had to be minimized if outstanding and committed Singaporeans were to be encouraged to take on the \\"risks and public responsibilities of a political career\\".. See also ; ; . The benchmark would also be used to determine the pay of the President, Prime Minister, Deputy Prime Minister, Attorney-General, Chairman of the Public Service Commission and judges. Following Parliamentary approval of the white paper in November 1994,; . the Government established an independent panel to examine the benchmark for the Prime Minister's salary. The panel's report, released in January 1995, recommended that the benchmark be about $1.6 million a year, but said it would be reasonable for the Prime Minister to be paid $2.4 million in view of his heavy responsibilities. The Government said that in three years it planned to raise the pay of the Prime Minister to $1.46 million and that of ministers to 60% of the benchmark, and in the \\"longer term\\" to $1.6 million and two-thirds of the benchmark respectively.. In February 1996 it was reported that a survey of 19 countries by the World Economic Forum magazine World Link had found that political leaders and senior civil servants of Singapore had the highest salaries. The pay of the Singapore Prime Minister (S$1.1 million, or US$812,858) was almost five times the average pay of the chief political executives of the nations surveyed (US$168,291). Senior civil servants were paid US$292,714, almost three times their counterparts' average pay.. In August 2000, in view of the Singapore economy's growth of almost 10% led by a rapid increase in exports, the salary of the Prime Minister was increased by 14% and those of other ministers by 12%. In response to public disquiet, Goh Chok Tong said that, spread across the population, the rises amounted to about $11 per person, equivalent to \\"about five plates of char kway teow [fried noodles with cockles] per Singaporean\\".. Subsequently, in late 2001, when Singapore experienced its worst recession in a generation, ministerial pay was reduced by more than 17%. Nonetheless, it was reported that the prime minister still earned a gross annual salary of about $1.03 million before the variable component was taken into account. In April 2007, the Prime Minister's annual salary increased to S$3.1 million (US$2.05 million), about five times that of the then President of the United States George W. Bush who earned US$400,000.. The annual entry-level salary for ministers increased from $1.2 million to $1.6 million, and was projected to rise to 88% of the private sector benchmark by the end of 2008. Almost half of ministers' pay packages was made up of an individual performance bonus decided by the Prime Minister, and a variable bonus component based on the country's prevailing gross domestic product and capped at eight months of each minister's annual salary.. The pay increases were justified by the Government on the grounds that the salaries had to keep pace with those in the private sector to attract the best talent and to avoid corruption. Teo Chee Hean, the then Minister for Defence and minister in charge of the civil service, was reported as saying: \\"We don't want pay to be the reason for people to join [the government]. But we also don't want pay to be the reason for them not to join us, or to leave after joining us.\\" The increases sparked much debate both in and out of Parliament, with many people seeing ministerial pay as already being too high. During a Parliamentary debate on the issue, then Nominated Member of Parliament Thio Li-ann said: \\"It would be a sad indictment of my generation if no one came forward to serve without excessive monetary inducement, as to be bereft of deep convictions is to be impoverished indeed.\\". On 11 April 2007, the Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong told Parliament: \\"To make it quite clear why I am doing this, and also to give me the moral standing to defend this policy with Singaporeans, I will hold my own salary at the present level for five years. The government will pay me my full salary, because that is the way the system will have to work, but for five years, whatever the increase in the salary above its present level, I will donate to suitable good causes.\\"; see also . The following day, it was clarified that the Prime Minister had decided to do so a while ago, and that he had not been influenced by pressure arising from the announcement of the ministerial pay rise.. In 2008, the annual salary for entry-level ministers was $1,924,300.. In view of the worsening economic crisis in 2008‚Äì2009, as of January 2009 the Prime Minister's salary was cut to $3.04 million, while the pay of ministerial-grade officers was reduced by 18% to $1.57 million.. In November 2009 the Public Service Division announced that pay increments would be deferred for a second time in 2010 because of the uncertain economic recovery. A minister's 2009 salary of $1,494,700 per year was therefore 22% lower than what he or she received in 2008. =2011 review= As at 31 December 2010, the remuneration of ministers depended on which ministerial grade ‚Äì from the lowest to the highest, MR4, MR3, MR2 or MR1 ‚Äì they were at. (\\"Ministerial salaries report\\"). Each minister's pay package was made up of fixed components (a monthly salary for 12 months, a non- pensionable annual allowance of one month's salary, a special allowance of one month's salary, and a public service leadership allowance of two months' salary) and variable components (an annual variable component, a performance bonus, and a gross domestic product (GDP) bonus). The annual variable component of up to one and a half-month's salary was paid based on Singapore's economic performance. In years where economic performance was exceptional, a special variable payment was also made. Each minister's performance bonus was determined by the Prime Minister and could be up to 14 months' salary, though most good performers received the equivalent of nine months' salary. The GDP bonus depended on the nation's GDP growth rate. No bonus was paid if the rate was below 2%, and a maximum bonus of eight months' salary was paid if the rate was 10% or greater. In addition, ministers received the same medical benefits as civil servants.Ministerial salaries report, pp. 12‚Äì13, paras. 18‚Äì19. In 2010, the benchmark annual remuneration for an MR4-grade minister was $2,598,004, while the actual salary paid was $1,583,900.Ministerial salaries report, p. 11, para. 14. An MR1-grade minister's salary was $2,368,500.Ministerial salaries report, pp. 31‚Äì32, para. 85 and Table 3. The annual pay of the Prime Minister was set at a fixed ratio to the MR4 salary, and was $3,072,200 in 2010. This included a fixed service bonus in lieu of a performance bonus since there was no one to assess the Prime Minister's individual performance. The fixed service bonus was the same as the performance bonus paid to a good performer at the MR4 grade.Ministerial salaries report, p. 27, para. 77. On 21 May 2011, following the 2011 general election, the Prime Minister announced that a committee would be appointed to review politicians' remuneration, and that revised salaries would take effect from that date. The committee to Review Ministerial Salaries chaired by Gerard Ee rendered its report on 30 December 2011, and released it to the public on 4 January 2012. As regards ministerial pay, the Committee recommended benchmarking an MR4-grade minister's salary to the median income of the top 1,000 wage earners who are Singapore citizens, with a 40% discount \\"to signify the sacrifice that comes with the ethos of political service\\".Ministerial salaries report, p. 5. It also recommended removing the special allowance and public service leadership allowance; capping performance bonuses at six months' salary (with good performers generally receiving three months' salary); and replacing the GDP bonus with a national bonus based on four equally weighted indicators: the real median income growth rate (that is, the growth rate taking inflation into account), the real growth rate of the incomes of the lowest 20th percentile earners, the unemployment rate, and the real GDP growth rate. As regards the latter, no bonus will be paid if the minimum targets for the indicators are not met. A bonus of three months' salary will be paid if the targets are met, and a maximum bonus of six months' salary if the targets are greatly exceeded.Ministerial salaries report, pp. 25‚Äì27, para. 76. This would result in a reduction of an M4-grade minister's annual salary by 31% of the 2010 figure to $1.1 million.Ministerial salaries report, p. 6. This is made up of a base pay of $715,000, a one-month annual variable component, a three-month performance bonus and a three-month national bonus* .See also ; ; . Where the Prime Minister's remuneration was concerned, the Committee recommended that it be pegged to twice of a MR4-grade minister's salary and doing away with the fixed service bonus. Instead, the Prime Minister will receive a larger national bonus. His annual bonus where the targets for the indicators have been met will be six months' salary, and 12 months' salary where they have been greatly exceeded.Ministerial salaries report, p. 27, paras. 77‚Äì78. This will lead to a reduction in the Prime Minister's annual salary of 28% to $2.2 million (about US$1.7 million).Ministerial salaries report, p. 7. Lee Hsien Loong said that he accepted the committee's recommendations. He remains the best-paid head of government in the world, his proposed annual pay package exceeding that of the then Chief Executive of Hong Kong Sir Donald Tsang, the political leader with the second-highest salary in the world (around US$550,000), by about three times; and that of then President of the United States Barack Obama (US$400,000). by over four times.. The committee's report was discussed in Parliament from 16 to 18 January 2012. Setting out the position of the Workers' Party, Chen Show Mao said that the basic monthly salary of an MP should be $11,000, the pay of an MX9-grade director in the Management Executive Scheme of the Civil Service. A minister should be paid five times this sum ($55,000), and the Prime Minister nine times ($99,000). then NCMP Gerald Giam said that ministers should obtain an average annual bonus of three months of their base salaries, and in any case no more than five months' bonus. Two-thirds of the bonus should be made up of the national bonus, and the remaining third based on the individual's performance, which should be determined according to key performance indicators fixed for each ministry at the start of a new government's term. Moreover, only a portion of bonuses should be paid at the end of each year. Payment of the remainder should be deferred till the end of the government's term. If the minister's performance is poor, some of the withheld bonus should be clawed back.; .. The WP's proposal was criticized by a number of PAP MPs. Senior Minister of State for Health Amy Khor expressed the view that \\"[p]olitical service is much more than public service. Civil servants are not subject to the votes of citizens nor do they need to carry the ground in policymaking. ... Pegging ministerial salaries to civil service salaries is not an adequate mechanism to account for the burdens and responsibilities that come with the job.\\" Rounding up the debate, Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean said that under the WP's proposal for calculating ministerial salaries, the quantum achieved was similar to the sum proposed by the committee, and that in his view the WP had approved the three principles of the new system: the requirement for the pay to be competitive, recognition of the ethos of political service, and the desirability of a \\"clean wage\\" system (that is, one in which ministers do not receive additional benefits such as housing and medical allowances)..; . PAP MPs then voted to endorse the committee's proposals. On 26 March 2012, the Public Service Division of the Prime Minister's Office announced that the fixed component of the salary of a political appointment holder would be 13 months of his or her monthly salary. For 2011, the annual variable component of the salary would be 1.25 months plus $250, while the national bonus would be 2.625 months though appointment holders would receive a pro rata amount of 1.618 months' pay as the new salaries took effect from 21 May 2011 when the Cabinet was appointed following the general election. The targets for the four indicators making up the national bonus were 2‚Äì3% for real median income growth of citizens and real median income growth for the lowest 20th percentile of citizens, 3‚Äì5% for real GDP growth, and not more than 4.5% for the unemployment rate of citizens.

There are three major isoforms of the ryanodine receptor, which are found in different tissues and participate in different signaling pathways involving calcium release from intracellular organelles. The RYR2 ryanodine receptor isoform is the major cellular mediator of calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) in animal cells.  Etymology  Ryanodine The ryanodine receptors are named after the plant alkaloid ryanodine which shows a high affinity to them.  Isoforms  There are multiple isoforms of ryanodine receptors: * RyR1 is primarily expressed in skeletal muscle * RyR2 is primarily expressed in myocardium (heart muscle) * RyR3 is expressed more widely, but especially in the brain. * Non-mammalian vertebrates typically express two RyR isoforms, referred to as RyR-alpha and RyR-beta. * Many invertebrates, including the model organisms Drosophila melanogaster (fruitfly) and Caenorhabditis elegans, only have a single isoform. In non-metazoan species, calcium-release channels with sequence homology to RyRs can be found, but they are shorter than the mammalian ones and may be closer to IP3 Receptors. { - valign=\\"top\\"  }  Physiology  Ryanodine receptors mediate the release of calcium ions from the sarcoplasmic reticulum and endoplasmic reticulum, an essential step in muscle contraction. In skeletal muscle, activation of ryanodine receptors occurs via a physical coupling to the dihydropyridine receptor (a voltage- dependent, L-type calcium channel), whereas, in cardiac muscle, the primary mechanism of activation is calcium-induced calcium release, which causes calcium outflow from the sarcoplasmic reticulum. It has been shown that calcium release from a number of ryanodine receptors in a ryanodine receptor cluster results in a spatiotemporally restricted rise in cytosolic calcium that can be visualised as a calcium spark. Ryanodine receptors are very close to mitochondria and calcium release from RyR has been shown to regulate ATP production in heart and pancreas cells. Ryanodine receptors are similar to the inositol trisphosphate (IP3) receptor, and stimulated to transport Ca2+ into the cytosol by recognizing Ca2+ on its cytosolic side, thus establishing a positive feedback mechanism; a small amount of Ca2+ in the cytosol near the receptor will cause it to release even more Ca2+ (calcium-induced calcium release/CICR). However, as the concentration of intracellular Ca2+ rises, this can trigger closing of RyR, preventing the total depletion of SR. This finding therefore indicates that a plot of opening probability for RyR as a function of Ca2+ concentration is a bell-curve. Furthermore, RyR can sense the Ca2+ concentration inside the ER/SR and spontaneously open in a process known as store overload-induced calcium release (SOICR). RyRs are especially important in neurons and muscle cells. In heart and pancreas cells, another second messenger (cyclic ADP-ribose) takes part in the receptor activation. The localized and time-limited activity of Ca2+ in the cytosol is also called a Ca2+ wave. The building of the wave is done by * the feedback mechanism of the ryanodine receptor * the activation of phospholipase C by GPCR or RTK, which leads to the production of inositol trisphosphate, which in turn activates the InsP3 receptor.  Associated proteins  RyRs form docking platforms for a multitude of proteins and small molecule ligands. The cardiac-specific isoform of the receptor (RyR2) is known to form a quaternary complex with luminal calsequestrin, junctin, and triadin. Calsequestrin has multiple Ca2+ binding sites and binds Ca2+ ions with very low affinity so they can be easily released.  Pharmacology  *Antagonists: **Ryanodine locks the RyRs at half-open state at nanomolar concentrations, yet fully closes them at micromolar concentration. **Dantrolene the clinically used antagonist **Ruthenium red **procaine, tetracaine, etc. (local anesthetics) *Activators: **Agonist: 4-chloro-m-cresol and suramin are direct agonists, i.e., direct activators. **Xanthines like caffeine and pentifylline activate it by potentiating sensitivity to native ligand Ca. **Physiological agonist: Cyclic ADP-ribose can act as a physiological gating agent. It has been suggested that it may act by making FKBP12.6 (12.6 kilodalton FK506 binding protein, as opposed to 12 kDa FKBP12 which binds to RyR1) which normally bind (and blocks) RyR2 channel tetramer in an average stoichiometry of 3.6, to fall off RyR2 (which is the predominant RyR in pancreatic beta cells, cardiomyocytes and smooth muscles). A variety of other molecules may interact with and regulate ryanodine receptor. For example: dimerized Homer physical tether linking inositol trisphosphate receptors (IP3R) and ryanodine receptors on the intracellular calcium stores with cell surface group 1 metabotropic glutamate receptors and the Alpha-1D adrenergic receptor  Ryanodine  The plant alkaloid ryanodine, for which this receptor was named, has become an invaluable investigative tool. It can block the phasic release of calcium, but at low doses may not block the tonic cumulative calcium release. The binding of ryanodine to RyRs is use-dependent, that is the channels have to be in the activated state. At low (<10 micromolar, works even at nanomolar) concentrations, ryanodine binding locks the RyRs into a long-lived subconductance (half-open) state and eventually depletes the store, while higher (~100 micromolar) concentrations irreversibly inhibit channel-opening.  Caffeine  RyRs are activated by millimolar caffeine concentrations. High (greater than 5 mmol/L) caffeine concentrations cause a pronounced increase (from micromolar to picomolar) in the sensitivity of RyRs to Ca2+ in the presence of caffeine, such that basal Ca2+ concentrations become activatory. At low millimolar caffeine concentrations, the receptor opens in a quantal way, but has complicated behavior in terms of repeated use of caffeine or dependence on cytosolic or luminal calcium concentrations.  Role in disease  RyR1 mutations are associated with malignant hyperthermia and central core disease. RyR2 mutations play a role in stress-induced polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (a form of cardiac arrhythmia) and ARVD. It has also been shown that levels of type RyR3 are greatly increased in PC12 cells overexpressing mutant human Presenilin 1, and in brain tissue in knockin mice that express mutant Presenilin 1 at normal levels, and thus may play a role in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, like Alzheimer's disease. The presence of antibodies against ryanodine receptors in blood serum has also been associated with myasthenia gravis. Recently, sudden cardiac death in several young individuals in the Amish community (four of which were from the same family) was traced to homozygous duplication of a mutant RyR2 (Ryanodine Receptor) gene. Normal (wild type) ryanodine receptors are involved in CICR in heart and other muscles, and RyR2 functions primarily in the myocardium (heart muscle).  Structure RyR1 cryo-EM structure revealed a large cytosolic assembly built on an extended Œ±-solenoid scaffold connecting key regulatory domains to the pore. The RyR1 pore architecture shares the general structure of the six-transmembrane ion channel superfamily. A unique domain inserted between the second and third transmembrane helices interacts intimately with paired EF-hands originating from the Œ±-solenoid scaffold, suggesting a mechanism for channel gating by Ca2+.

Context The opera was a commercial failure, lasting only five performances in London after its premiere. In the 19th century, however, the aria was rediscovered and became one of Handel's best-known pieces. Handel adapted the aria from the setting by Giovanni Bononcini, who, in turn, adapted it from the setting by Francesco Cavalli. All three composers had produced settings of the same opera libretto by Nicol√≤ Minato. Music Originally composed to be sung by a soprano castrato (and sung in modern performances of Serse by a countertenor, contralto or a mezzo- soprano), it has been arranged for other voice types and instruments, including solo organ, solo piano, violin and piano, and string ensembles, often under the title \\"Largo from Xerxes\\", although the original tempo is marked larghetto. In the opera, the aria is preceded by a short recitativo accompagnato of 9 bars, setting the scene (\\"Frondi tenere e belle\\"). The aria itself is also short; it consists of 52 bars and typically lasts three to four minutes. The instrumentation is for a string section: first and second violins, viola, and basses. The key signature is F major, the time signature is 3/4 time. The vocal range covers C4 to F5 with a tessitura from F4 to F5. Libretto Plane tree (planted in 1680) The title translates from the Italian as \\"Never was a shade\\". It is sung by the main character, Xerxes I of Persia, admiring the shade of a plane tree. Frondi tenere e belle del mio platano amato per voi risplenda il fato. Tuoni, lampi, e procelle non v'oltraggino mai la cara pace, n√© giunga a profanarvi austro rapace. Ombra mai fu di vegetabile, cara ed amabile, soave pi√π. Tender and beautiful fronds of my beloved plane tree, let Fate smile upon you. May thunder, lightning, and storms never disturb your dear peace, nor may you by blowing winds be profaned. Never was a shade of any plant dearer and more lovely, or more sweet. Cultural references On 24 December 1906, Reginald Fessenden, a Canadian inventor and radio pioneer, broadcast the first AM radio program, which started with a phonograph record of \\"\\" followed by his playing \\"O Holy Night\\" on the violin and singing the final verse. The aria therefore was the first piece of music to be broadcast on radio.

Biography=Early life Born at Quixeramobim, Ant√¥nio Maciel was the son of Maria Joaquina de Jesus and Vicente Mendes Maciel, a rugged family of cattle breeders in the sert√£o (\\"backlands\\"), the semi-arid zone of the Brazilian Northeast. His infancy was marked by a bloody feud with the powerful family of the Ara√∫jos, causing many deaths in both families, following the tragic cycle of vengeance and honour which were so common in these regions. After the death of his mother in 1834, his father married again, and Ant√¥nio and his two sisters suffered with the father's alcoholism and maltreatment by their stepmother. Ant√¥nio went to study with his grandfather, Manoel Ant√¥nio Ferreira Nobre, who was a teacher in Quixeramobim. He developed well as a serious, quiet and hard-working pupil, studying Latin, French, Portuguese, mathematics, geography and history. In 1855 his father died and he assumed the family's business, striving to get his sisters married. In 1857, Ant√¥nio himself married Brasilina Laurentina de Lima and began working as a salesman, teacher and lay counselor (poorman's lawyer). Already with two children, he was betrayed by his wife in 1861, and disillusioned and depressed, he separated from them and retired to a farm, working as a rural teacher, and devoting himself more and more to Christian mysticism. Moving again to Santa Quit√©ria, Cear√°, he had a third child, a son named Joaquim Apr√≠gio, after a brief affair with a local artist named Joana Imagin√°ria. He was restless, however, and started to wander around the country, from 1865 to 1869, and then from 1871 and afterwards. The counsellor He was tall and thin, with long black hair and beard, always dressed in a rough blue tunic, a straw hat and leather sandals, carrying a necklace with a wooden cross, Ant√¥nio Maciel cut an impressive figure, reminding people of Jesus Christ. Gradually he became a pilgrim, an itinerant benefactor and counsellor of the poor, as well a pious preacher and religious leader. He was called alternatively by the simple people of the region as Ant√¥nio Conselheiro, Santo Ant√¥nio dos Mares, Santo Ant√¥nio Aparecido or Bom Jesus Conselheiro, and began to attract not only admirers, but fanatical followers, who started travelling with him. Trouble with law and Church In 1874, Ant√¥nio Conselheiro began to attract the attention of authorities and the Catholic Church, due to his preaching to the oppressed and poor peasants and common folk of small villages and farms. In 1876 he was arrested by the police in Itapicuru, Bahia, under the suspicion of being a wanted criminal. After being identified, he was sent by ship to Fortaleza. He was severely beaten, his hair and beard were cut and he was sent back for trial to his city of origin, Quixeramobim. The local judge, however, released Ant√¥nio Conselheiro due to the absence of any criminal charges against him. Ant√¥nio returned immediately to Bahia and restarted his wandering and preaching. He vowed to construct 21 churches and proceeded to do so in 12 cities in the backlands of the provinces of Bahia and Sergipe, as well as cemeteries and small dams. In 1877, one of the periodical catastrophic droughts began in the Northeast. It would be two years long and kill more than 300,000 peasants by hunger and thirst, creating havoc with the predominantly semi-arid agrarian economy of the region. Many villages were entirely abandoned and instances of cannibalism even occurred. Ant√¥nio Conselheiro and his followers did what they could to diminish the extreme suffering of the poor people, adding more and more admirers and followers to his group. The sense of an impending end of the world and that the only salvation could come through religion were strong incentives to the surge of religious fanaticism. Conselheiro was widely regarded as a saint and a Messiah. Due to his increasing criticism of the official Church, and his open preachings in the small churches of the backlands, in 1882 the Archbishop of Bahia issued an order forbidding priests to allow him access to the flocks and characterising Ant√¥nio Conselheiro as an apostate and as a madman. The abolition of slavery and the proclamation of the Republic In 1888 and 1889, Brazil went through the most revolutionary and far-reaching social, economic and political changes of its history since Europeans settled in 1500. On May 13, 1888, slavery was abolished by the ruling Emperor, Dom Pedro II, by an act signed by his daughter, Princess Isabel. More than five million black people were suddenly out of work, abandoned the farms and swelled enormously the rural and urban ranks of extremely poor inhabitants. Tens of thousands of farmers went broke and agriculture almost stopped for a while, particularly for cash crops which required intensive labor, such as coffee, cotton, tobacco and sugarcane, the mainstays of the Brazilian economy at the time. On November 15, 1889, the Emperor was deposed by a military coup and the Republic was proclaimed, further adding instability and strife to the already torn-up country. All this was important to the make-up of Canudos. Ant√¥nio Conselheiro was strongly against slavery, and had preached and written about it, incurring in the wrath of farmers and authorities. The number of his flocks increased dramatically, and it is estimated that over 80% were former slaves. In addition, he considered that monarchy was a grant of God, and that the Republic, with its separation between Church and State, was morally wrong and would wreck the country and family, a kind of new antichrist. Again he stepped up public criticism and rallied the social movement around these flags. General nervousness of farmers, priests and government increased to hysterical fear. Finally, in 1893, violence erupted. Protesting against taxes levied by the new Republican government in Masset√©, state of Bahia, \\"Conselhistas\\" (as Ant√¥nio Conselheiro's organized following was named) were attacked by a small police force and retaliated. Canudos Ant√¥nio Conselheiro. Ant√¥nio Conselheiro decided then to retreat and to establish in 1893 a permanent place for his growing band of now quasi-insurrectionaries. Near the city of Monte Santo, in the Northeast tip of Bahia, he founded the village of Bello Monte (Fair Hill), in an area named Canudos. It was set in an abandoned farm amid several mountain ranges, near the Vaza-Barris River. In Canudos, Ant√¥nio Conselheiro, aided by a local government by committee, composed by 12 \\"apostles\\", or elders, established a communist-like social system, with division of labour and produce, common property, abolition of civil marriage and of the official currency, prohibition of taverns, liquor and prostitution, rigid control over crimes and mandatory religious activities. He also gave a measure of personal freedom from injustice and oppression by landlords and governmental authorities. The fame of Canudos spread rapidly throughout the Northeast, as being a promised land of \\"milk and honey\\". Former black slaves, uprooted indigenous people and impoverished and landless mestizos started to come in droves to Canudos. By one year later, Canudos already had 8,000 new residents; by 1895 its population had grown to more than 30,000 and more than 5,000 dwellings. Two churches and one school were also built and commerce and agriculture became more organised. The massive presence of such kinds of people started to cause much fear and trouble in the region, since many of the new residents were not-so-peaceful \\"jagun√ßos\\" (hired armed men who worked for farmers), leading to appeals to the government for repression and control. Fearing an invasion of the city of Juazeiro by the \\"Conselhistas\\", who had a dispute with a lumber merchant, its mayor appealed hysterically to the provincial government. A visit by two Capuchin friars to Canudos was insufficient to calm the population and one of them mistakenly accused Ant√¥nio Conselheiro of trying to raise a monarchist sedition. All was set for the start of military aggression against the largely peaceful settlement. Death During the military siege that ensued, Ant√¥nio Conselheiro, anguished by the death, hunger and suffering of his followers, spent his time praying and severe fasting. He was no military leader. Due to his severe fasting, he died at the age 67, on September 22, 1897, probably of dysentery. His death was the beginning of Canudos' defeat, which eventually brought about the brutal death of probably more than 50% of the city's inhabitants during the military operations and ensuing atrocities committed against civilians by the victors. The corpse of Ant√¥nio Conselheiro was located, disinterred and identified by military surgeons, his head was cut off and sent to Salvador, both as a proof and as a war spoil.

M. Forster, first published in 1907. It is the second of Forster's six published novels, following Where Angels Fear to Tread (1905) and preceding A Room with a View (1908) and Howards End (1910). It has a reputation for being the least known of Forster's novels, but was also the author's personal favourite and one of his most autobiographical. It is the only one of Forster's novels not to have received a film or television adaptation. Plot summary Rickie Elliot is a student at early 20th century Cambridge, a university that seems like paradise to him, amongst bright if cynical companions, when he receives a visit from two friends, an engaged young woman, Agnes Pembroke, and her elder brother, Herbert. The Pembrokes are Rickie's only friends from home. An orphan who grew up living with cousins, he was sent to a public (boarding) school where he was shunned and bullied because of his lame foot, an inherited weakness, and frail body. Agnes, as it happens, is engaged to Gerald, now in the army, who was one of the sturdy youths who bullied Rickie at school. Rickie is not brilliant at argument, but he is intensely responsive to poetry and art, and is accepted within a circle of philosophical and intellectual fellow-students led by a brilliant but especially cynical aspiring philosopher, Stewart Ansell, who refuses, when he is introduced to her, even to acknowledge that Agnes exists. When visiting the Pembrokes during his vacation, Rickie has an epiphanic vision of the sexual bond between Gerald, who is coarse but handsome and athletic, and Agnes, a bond he cannot imagine for himself. He takes these lovers' side in trying to speed their marriage, offering part of his own inheritance, an offer that insults Gerald. When Gerald is suddenly killed in a football match, Rickie finds a role consoling Agnes‚Äîhe tells her she should \\"mind\\" what has happened, that is, that she should grieve‚Äîsince her passion for Gerald has been the main event of her life. Rickie becomes Agnes' chief consolation and support, though he is in every way Gerald's opposite, and after a year or two, despite the failure of Rickie's stories to find a publisher, he and Agnes become engaged to marry. The young couple pay a visit to Rickie's Aunt Emily Failing, a wealthy eccentric, the widow of a well-known essayist. On this visit they meet Aunt Emily's ward, Stephen, a quarrelsome and handsome semi-educated 19-year-old. For some reason‚Äîperhaps just to make malicious mischief‚ÄîAunt Emily wants Rickie and Stephen to get to know each other. The two young men do not take to each other at all, and quarrel. Yet it turns out that they are in fact half-brothers, a long-kept secret that Aunt Emily reveals to Rickie, mostly to shock him. Rickie assumes that Stephen is the illegitimate son of his father‚Äîa father he hated‚Äîwho lived apart from Rickie's mother during Rickie's childhood. Illegitimacy in this period is considered to be a blight on the child, as well as the family, and Agnes, who is essentially conventional, considers Stephen's existence something to be deeply ashamed of and to be kept secret, and Stephen a person who deserves to be shunned. Her brother, Herbert, has received an offer to be the head of a dormitory at Sawston School, and can fill this post only if Agnes and Rickie marry quickly and join him, Agnes to be house mother, and Rickie to be a teacher of classics. Rickie's ambition to be a writer, and his freedom of thought, are suppressed by the dreary regimen of teaching, and his moral sense is suffocated by the influence of his wife and brother-in-law. He becomes a petty tyrant in the classroom, and an insensitive enforcer of school rules, though a part of him still sees and understands what he has lost, both as a writer and a man of refinement and sensitivity, since Cambridge. He is \\"dead\\" to his former friend, Stewart Ansell, who refuses to answer Rickie's letters. Ansell finally does pay a visit to Rickie, stopping at the house of another acquaintance, and by coincidence he meets Stephen, who (partly due to Agnes's scheming to get Aunt Emily's inheritance for Rickie and herself) has been expelled from Mrs. Failing's house. Stephen has discovered his identity at last, and now knows that Rickie is his half-brother. He wants to meet him again and see whether they might get on better. Ansell falls under the spell of Stephen's rustic honesty, physical vitality, and impulsiveness. Rickie, Agnes and Herbert assume Stephen has come to blackmail them and Agnes offers him money, but Stephen, who is in fact penniless, now wants nothing to do with them. In a horrifying blowout, in front of all the pupils, Ansell accuses Rickie and Agnes of wanting to deny Stephen's existence. Ansell reveals to Rickie that Stephen is, in fact, his mother's illegitimate child, not his father‚Äôs. Rickie faints at this revelation. Rickie‚Äôs marriage has become loveless, as Ansell assumed it would, and with his brother's reappearance he realises that he has fallen under his wife's spell and denied his better nature. He leaves to find Stephen, dear to him now because he is the child of the same beloved mother, and he attempts unsuccessfully to assume the role of a brother, for example, to get him to stop drinking. The two of them go to Wiltshire to see his aunt. This brief period when they travel together restores to Rickie the sense of himself that has been lost ever since he fell under his wife's influence, and, as well, restores his sense of joy and playful love of life. Rickie is unable, however, to control his mercurial half-brother, who gets drunk despite his promise not to. Like his mother, and like Gerald, Rickie dies suddenly: his legs are severed when he tries to pull a drunken Stephen off some railway tracks. Stephen survives, marries, and in a brief epilogue stands up to Herbert Pembroke for his right to money that is due him with the publication of his half-brother‚Äôs book of stories, now valuable since, after his death, Frederick Elliot has become a noted author. The \\"longest journey\\" which is the span of one‚Äôs life, or, in another sense, the development into one‚Äôs true self, has concluded successfully for Rickie, who has regained his sense of integrity. Though his life is cut short, he receives his vindication by coming to moral clarity at last, rejecting conventional hypocrisy, and acknowledging his bond to his brother. His uniqueness and worth are confirmed as well by his posthumous success as an artist. The phrase \\"the longest journey\\" appears in Percy Bysshe Shelley's Epipsychidion: I never was attached to that great sect Whose doctrine is, that each one should select Out of the crowd a mistress or a friend, And all the rest, though fair and wise, commend To cold oblivion, though it is in the code Of modern morals, and the beaten road Which those poor souls with weary footsteps tread, Who travel to their home among the dead By the broad highway of the world, and so With one chained friend, perhaps a jealous foe, The dreariest and longest journey go. Writing Forster mapped out a loose plot in July 1904 after meeting a shepherd boy whilst walking in Wiltshire. He spent the first half of 1906 working on the novel. Returning to Weybridge from abroad in October 1906, Forster worked to complete it.Moffat, Wendy E. M. Forster: A New Life, London: Bloomsbury Publishing, 2010 Reception Critically The Longest Journey is the most polarizing of Forster's novels. The novel was well-reviewed but had disappointing sales when first released; it is most often viewed as a minor work compared to Forster's later novels. However, even in Forster's lifetime there was reassessment of the novel's quality, with literary critic Lionel Trilling calling it \\"...perhaps the most brilliant, the most dramatic, and the most passionate of his works.\\" According to Margaret Drabble both the structure and the uncharacteristically high death count which occurs later in the book confuse fans of Forster's. Gilbert Adair wrote that the greatest weaknesses for readers is its \\"unrelenting intellectuality, its sublimation and even outright repression of the importance of the erotic in human relationships\\" and the \\"...not always intentional priggishness of its characters\\", which he saw as constituting a poignant quality.

The trunkline runs through a rural section of Leelanau County, connecting two villages with the county seat. Originally a gravel road in 1933, it was later paved within the first three years of existence. Segments were realigned to straighten curves in the late 1930s and early 1970s near the villages of Lake Leelanau and Suttons Bay. Route description M-204 starts at an intersection with M-22 (Manitou Trail) south of Leland next to Duck Lake. From there it follows Duck Lake Road along the south shore of Lake Leelanau's northern lobe. The two-lane roadway runs eastward and then southeasterly through a mixture of woods and fields to the village of Lake Leelanau. One there, M-204 follows Phillip Street across the Narrows and turns northeasterly. The bridge that the trunkline uses is eligible for listing on the National Register of Historic Places. Outside of town, the highway follows Duck Lake Road again past the county seat of Leelanau County. Near the intersection with Horn Road, M-204 turns southeasterly toward the village of Suttons Bay. As the trunkline descends a hill into the village, it passes through vineyards and woods. Inside town, M-204 follows Race Street and ends downtown at M-22 (St. Joseph Avenue). Like other state highways in Michigan, M-204 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT). In 2011, the department's traffic surveys showed that on average, 3,397 vehicles used the highway daily in Suttons Bay and 2,931 vehicles did so each day near the western terminus, the highest and lowest counts along the highway, respectively. No section of M-204 is listed on the National Highway System, a network of roads important to the country's economy, defense, and mobility. History M-204 was first designated on July 12, 1933 between Leland and Suttons Bay along what is today Duck Lake Road. The highway was paved by the middle of 1936. The road was realigned on July 13, 1939, across the narrows of Lake Leelanau in the village of the same name. Another realignment near Suttons Bay was completed on March 26, 1956, to smooth out a curve in the road. A second completed on May 4, 1956, straightened a curve by Sylt Road east of Lake Leelanau. The western section was completely rebuilt between Duck Lake Corner and the Lake Leelanau Narrows Bridge to smooth out curves in the roadway. Sections not obliterated by the reconstruction were turned over to local control as Main Street or Old M-204 in Lake Leelanau when the project was finished on July 1, 1970.

It tells the story of an introverted young boy (Haley Joel Osment) who is sent to live with his eccentric great-uncles (Robert Duvall and Michael Caine) on a farm in Texas.  Plot  14-year-old Walter is left by his irresponsible mother, Mae, to live for the summer with his reclusive, bachelor great-uncles, Hub and Garth. Despite living on a ramshackle Texan farm, they are said to have a secret fortune and are made the target of every traveling salesman. They, in turn, sit on their porch with shotguns, shooting at the salesmen. Walter is given a room in the attic and is not welcomed at first, until they realize he annoys other gold-digging relatives who visit with their children. For his part, Walter persuades his uncles to try spending some of their money, generally with disastrous results. Packets of seeds to plant a vegetable garden turn out all to be corn. Then they order a lion for an animal target and end up with an aging, tame, retired circus lioness, which they turn over to Walter as a pet. Later, she is released by accident and takes to the cornfield, which becomes her new \\"jungle\\" home. While loading 50-pound bags of Lion Chow, Hub passes out and is taken to the hospital. On leaving, they encounter four greasers at a roadside store who draw switchblade knives on Hub, but are easily beaten by him in a fight. A subplot develops around the photograph of a beautiful woman that Walter finds in the attic. In a series of flashbacks, Garth tells Walter the story of their African past, during which Hub fell in love with an Arab princess named Jasmine (after whom Walter names the lioness) who was promised to a powerful Sheik. After Hub and Jasmine married, the Sheik put a price on Hub's head, keeping them in constant peril from assassins. Finally Hub won a duel against the Sheik but spared his life, warning him to cease the manhunt. When Walter asks to hear more from Hub, his uncle reveals that Jasmine and their baby died in childbirth. Hub then returned to the French Foreign Legion, until he retired with Garth to their farm, where they are resignedly waiting to die. Walter asks Hub for confirmation, since his mother always lies to him. Hub responds with a piece of his \\"What Every Boy Needs to Know...\\" speech, that the actual truth is not as important as belief in ideals. Walter then asks Hub to promise to be around to give him the rest of the speech when he's old enough and Hub grudgingly agrees. Late one evening, Walter trails Garth and discovers they have a room filled with money underneath the barn. On another night, Walter's mother and her current boyfriend, a supposed \\"private investigator\\" named Stan, arrive. While the uncles sleep, Stan and Mae demand that Walter reveal the location of his uncles' fortune, claiming they were actually bank robbers. When Walter chooses to believe in his uncles instead, Stan pins Walter down and begins beating him. Jasmine (the lion), sensing Walter in danger, emerges from the cornfield and attacks Stan. Awakened by the ruckus, Hub and Garth find the old lioness has died of heart failure defending her ‚Äúcub‚Äù. The next day, Walter leaves with his mother. Once on the road, Mae explains that Stan will be staying with them to recuperate, but Walter asks her instead to \\"do something that's best for me for once\\" and abandons her. While Hub and Garth are delighted to see him back, Walter insists there have to be changes: His uncles must involve themselves in his education and live carefully, as he wants them to die of old age. Seventeen years later, Walter is alerted by the sheriff of his uncles' deaths from a failed flying stunt with their biplane. Arriving at the farm, he is given his uncles' will, declaring \\"The kid gets it all. Just plant us in the damn garden, with the stupid lion.\\" A helicopter bearing the logo Sahara Petroleum then touches down near the homestead and a man steps out with his young son, explaining that he heard about Hub and Garth's deaths on the radio. He had recognized the names as the two Americans in tales told to him in his youth by his grandfather, \\"a very wealthy sheik\\". When the man's young son asks Walter if his uncles really lived, Walter confirms, \\"Yeah.

London) was an important British artist, designer, writer and poet associated with the Arts and Crafts Movement. He designed stained glass windows, furniture, embroidery, and was an illustrator of books. Image was the first Slade Professor of Fine Art at Oxford from 1910 to 1916. Early life and education Selwyn Image was born in Bodiam, Sussex on 17 February 1849 to the Reverend John Image (c. 1802‚Äì1878), vicar of Bodiam and Mary Maxwell (nee Hinds c. 1807‚Äì1857). He attended Marlborough College and the New College, Oxford in 1868 where he studied drawing under John Ruskin. Intending on entering the clergy and following his father as Vicar of Bodiam, Image took Holy Orders at the age of 24. He was ordained deacon in 1872, and priest the next year. He was a curate at Tottenham and later at St. Anne's, Soho. Image began studying art with A. H. Mackmurdo and Ruskin's assistant, Arthur Burgess in 1880. Image eventually abandoned the clergy in 1882. The Century Guild of Artists He founded the Century Guild of Artists in London with prominent architect and designer A. H. Mackmurdo. With Mackmurdo, Image established the Guild's workshops which produced furniture, wallpaper, primarily domestic design such as furniture, stained glass, metalwork, and decorative painting. Image was co-editor of the Guild's magazine, The Hobby Horse, from 1886 to 1892. He was an active member of the Art Workers' Guild in London and became a Master of the guild in 1900.. Stained glass designer right One of Image's first stained glass designs, The Seasons, manufactured by James Powell & Sons, was exhibited at the Paris International Exhibition in 1878. Image's designs were influenced by the work of William Morris. Image's early designs, composed of individual figures against a floral background, was inspired by Morris's previous work. Image described one of Morris & Co. earliest stained glass commissions, one of a pair of two-light windows (1862) depicting the four archangels at St. Michael and All Angels church in Brighton 'as one of the finest modern windows I know of.'\\" The early window, designed by Ford Madox Brown was the inspiraton for Image's Archangel window at Mortehoe. The basis of Image's stained glass design was a \\"simplicity of treatment, not only in figure drawing and ornament‚Äîwhich closely match his contemporary graphic work, such as for the Century Guild The Hobby Horse‚Äîbut also in the use of leading. In an article published in The Hobby Horse in 1890, Image expounded his principles of stained glass design, emphasizing that qualities of 'richness and brilliance of effect....in no small measure depend upon the management of the leads'\\". Image and well-known stained glass artist, Christopher Whall met in the 1880s and became lasting friends. Whall and Image were among the earliest pioneers and important contributors to the Arts and Crafts Movement. Image designed fewer than thirty windows during his career, but a number of cartoons (designs) were displayed at Arts and Crafts Exhibitions. Several of Image's designs were illustrated in books and magazines where Image acquired a wide following. Christopher Whall included one of Image's cartoons in his influential manual Stained Glass Work (1905), \\"as an example of the 'simple and severe' style of drawing best suited to the medium.\\" Image was influential in the work of a number of stained glass artists, including two women: Mary J. Newill (1860‚Äì1947) and Helen Coombe (1864‚Äì1937). Mary J. Newill was a talented artist-craftsman who trained at the Birmingham Municipal School of Art in the 1880s and 1890s. Helen Coombe (1864‚Äì1937) was a student of Image at the Slade School of Fine Art and her design for the Mary and Martha window was displayed at the 1896 Arts and Crafts Exhibition and showed the influence of Image as artistic mentor. Writer, lecturer, and poet Image was an influential writer on design and the first Slade Professor of Fine Arts at Oxford from 1910 to 1916. Between December 1887 and February 1888, Image gave a series of four lectures on Modern Art at Willis' Rooms. Oscar Wilde attended at least one of this series, and reviewed the second lecture in the Sunday Times on 25 January 1888. Image published a number of essays, contributed introductions and chapters to scholarly publications, and published a poetry collection, Poems and Carols in 1894. Other work Image's line-block design for the cover of the inaugural 1884 issue of the Hobby Horse, the Guild's publication, is widely known. Other celebrated works include the design of embroideries for the Royal School of Needlework and bookbindings such as that for the novel Stefania (1893)\\". In 1900, Image was hired as a designer for the Glasgow furniture manufacturer, Wylie and Lochead. Death and legacy Image died at Holloway on 21 August 1930. Two years after his death, selected poems and later his letters, edited by Mackmurdo was published.

Life He was a descendant of a wealthy priestly family in Upper Galilee.Tosefta Hallah 1:10; Bava Kamma 80a; compare Rabbinovicz, Dikdukei Soferim ad loc.; Hullin 49a His year of birth was 90 CE. He was captured by the Romans as a young boy, but redeemed by R' Joshua ben Hananiah.Tosefta Horayot 2:5; Gittin 58a R' Nehunya ben HaKanah became his teacher,Shevu'ot 26a and he remained a close colleague of Rabbi Joshua.Avodah Zarah 2:5; Tosefta Parah10(9):3 He is likely the grandson of the high priest of the same name. He lived in Kfar Aziz, south of Hebron.Mishnah Kilaim 6:4 Some suppose that he was among the martyrs of Betar.Compare Avot of Rabbi Natan 38 [ed. Schechter, p. 57b; The more generally received opinion, however, is that one of the martyrs was a namesake (Rabbi Ishmael's death is mentioned in Nedarim 9:10).

Filipowski, p. 25\\\\. According to tradition, his burial place is at Parod in the Galilee.http://www.mytzadik.com/tzadik.aspx?id=68 Disposition Yishmael's teachings were calculated to promote peace and goodwill among all: \\"Be indulgent with the hoary head;\\" he would say, \\"and be kind to the black-haired [the young]; and meet every man with a friendly countenance\\". What he taught he practised. Even toward strangers, he acted considerately. When a non-Jew greeted him, he answered kindly, \\"Your reward has been predicted\\"; when another abused him, he repeated coolly, \\"Your reward has been predicted.\\" This apparent inconsistency, he explained to his puzzled disciples by quoting : \\"Cursed be one who curses you, and blessed be one who blesses you\\".Yerushalmi Berakhot, chapter 8, page 11c; ; He was fatherly to the indigent, particularly to poor and plain maidens, whom he clothed attractively and provided with means, so that they might obtain husbands., One Friday night, while absorbed in the study of the Bible, he inadvertently turned the wick of a lamp; and he vowed that when the Temple was rebuilt, he would offer there an expiatory sacrifice. Views on marriage Yishmael opposed the refusal of the ultra-patriotic to beget children under the Roman sway.Tosefta, Sotah, 15:5;; Even under the conditions then existing, he recommended early marriage. He said, \\"The Scripture tells us, 'Thou shalt teach them [the things thou hast seen at Horeb] to thy sons and to thy sons' sons;' and how may one live to teach his sons' sons unless one marries early?\\"Deuteronomy ; Yerushalmi Kiddushin, chapter 1, page 61a. See also Halakhic exegesis Yishmael gradually developed a system of halakhic exegesis which, while running parallel with that of Rabbi Akiva, is considered the more logical of the two. Indeed, Yishmael established the principles of the logical method by which laws may be deduced from laws and important decisions founded on the plain phraseology of the Scriptures. Like Akiva, he opened up a wide field for halakhic induction, but, unlike Akiva, he required more than a mere jot or a letter as a basis for making important rulings.Compare Yishmael was of opinion that the Torah was conveyed in the language of man,Yerushalmi Yevamot, chapter 8, page 8d; ; Yerushalmi Nedarim, chapter 1, page 36c and that therefore a seemingly superfluous word or syllable cannot be used as a basis for new deductions. In discussing a hypothetical case with Akiva, he once exclaimed, \\"Wilt thou indeed decree death by fire on the strength of a single letter?\\" He considered the plain sense of the Scriptural text, irrespective of its verbal figures, to be the only safe guide. Hermeneutic rules To consistently carry out his views in this direction, Ishmael formalized a set of 13 hermeneutic rules by which halakha was derived from the Torah. As a basis for these rules he took the seven rules of Hillel, and on them built up his own system, which he elaborated and strengthened by illustrating them with examples taken from the Scriptures.See Baraita of R. Ishmael; Talmud; comp. Gen. R. 92:7 Even these rules, he would not permit to apply to important questions, such as capital cases in which no express Scriptural warrant for punishment existed; he would not consent to attach a sentence of death, or even a fine, to a crime or misdemeanor on the strength of a mere inference, however logical, where no such punishment is clearly stated in ScriptureYerushalmi Avodah Zarah, chapter 5, page 45b, or to draw a rule from a law itself based on an inference.Yerushalmi Kiddushin, chapter 1, page 59a) His rules were universally adopted by his successors, tannaim, as well as amoraim, although occasionally he himself was forced to deviate from them.See Sifre, Numbers, 32 Aggadah He had a reputation for greatness in aggadah.

Her 1933 collaboration with Diedrich Hermann Westermann, Practical Phonetics for Students of African languages, was reprinted many times. African languages she worked on include Efik (1933), Igbo (1936, 1941), Mende (1944), and Yoruba (published posthumously in 1952).Westermann, Diedrich Hermann (1949) 'Professor Ida C.

She studied for a B.Litt degree at Durham University, as a member of the then recently founded Women's Hostel, graduating in 1902. Following this she taught as a secondary school teacher for 16 years before becoming an academic. From 1919 to 1932 she worked in the phonetics department at University College London with the famous phonetician Daniel Jones; in 1932 she moved on to the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, becoming a professor in 1944.

The original Elizabethan building was demolished in 1819 and replaced by the present Victorian house. History The Londesborough estate belonged, in the 16th and early 17th century, to the Clifford family, the Earls of Cumberland. The original house was built by George Clifford, 3rd Earl of Cumberland, in 1589, created in the Elizabethan style. In 1643, the last Earl, Henry Clifford, 5th Earl of Cumberland died. His only child, Lady Elizabeth Clifford, had married Richard Boyle, 2nd Earl of Cork, and thus the property passed to the Boyle family. In 1664, Richard Boyle was also created 1st Earl of Burlington. Robert Hooke was engaged to enlarge the house and lay out formal gardens, between 1679 and 1683. Richard Boyle, 3rd Earl of Burlington, who was the principal patron of the Palladian movement in England, and himself a noted architect, had alterations made to Londesborough, undertaken by William Kent in the 1720s. On the 3rd Earl's death without a male heir, in 1753, Londesborough passed to the Dukes of Devonshire, along with all his other properties, as his daughter, Lady Charlotte Boyle, had married William Cavendish, soon to be the 4th Duke of Devonshire. In 1819, the 6th Duke of Devonshire, who had a superfluity of grand homes, a large running debt inherited from his father, and many other expensive interests to pay for, including his reconstruction of Chatsworth House, had Londesbrough demolished. He is said to have regretted this, and in 1839, he had a hunting box built on the estate, but in 1845, under mounting financial strain, he sold the whole Londesborough estate to the \\"Railway King\\", George Hudson. A private railway station (Londesborough Park) was built on the adjacent York to Beverley line for Hudson to use. Hudson's questionable financial practices soon brought about his ruin, and in 1849, he sold Londesborough to the politician, Albert Denison, who was created Baron Londesborough in 1850. Denison enlarged the hunting box to create a country house in the Victorian style. His son, William Denison, later became the Earl of Londesborough. The Victorian house survives in the ownership of Dr and Mrs Ashwin, who also own the Londesborough estate. The Yorkshire Wolds Way long-distance footpath passes through Londesborough Park, which still has open pastureland described on the walk's official site as \\"a delight to walk through\\".

AmCham is the largest foreign business organization in Taiwan, with more than 1,000 members representing over 500 companies across a diverse array of sectors. Membership in AmCham Taipei does not require U.S. citizenship. AmCham is a founding member of APCAC. The Chamber's monthly journal is Taiwan Business TOPICS. Organization & Leadership An elected Board of Governors oversees AmCham, and chooses one of its members to serve as Chairman for a one-year term. The Board also hires a president to guide the overall direction and manage the day-to-day affairs of the Chamber. The current president is Bill Foreman. Activities AmCham Taipei represents its diverse membership in government advocacy efforts, provides a forum for networking and access to information, and encourages civic-minded participation in the greater Taiwan community. Committees Much of AmCham's advocacy efforts begin in one of 24 committees, whose fields of activity range from Agro-Chemical, Banking, and Manufacturing to Education & Training, Public Health and Travel & Tourism. Most committees formulate a priority issues paper included in the Taiwan White Paper. Taiwan White Paper Each year, AmCham publishes a white paper that summarizes AmCham's recommendations to the government and public on legislative, regulatory and enforcement issues that have a major impact on the quality of the business environment. The primary purposes are information and advocacy. The paper assesses the Taiwan business climate on both the macro level and sector by sector. It provides a review of the status of last year's priority issues, states the current issues identified by AmCham's industry- specific committees, and offers recommendations to the U.S. government. Taiwan Business TOPICS The Chamber's flagship publication provides year- round reporting and policy analysis in support of Chamber advocacy. First issued in 1969, TOPICS has become the definitive voice on the Taiwan business climate for executives, government officials, the media, and academics. The magazine appears monthly and enjoys widespread distribution to prominent officials, elected representatives, and think tanks in the United States and Taiwan. The June issue is devoted to the Taiwan White Paper. Hsieh Nien Fan An AmCham tradition since 1970, the Hiseh Nien Fan banquet is an opportunity to thank Taiwan government officials for their assistance in the previous year. Customarily, the president of the country is the keynote speaker. Then-President Ma Ying-jeou giving keynote address at AmCham Taipei's Hsieh Nien Fan in 2013 Washington ‚ÄúDoorknock‚Äù Once a year, an AmCham delegation meets with senior officials in the U.S. Administration and on Capitol Hill to discuss international business concerns regarding U.S.-Taiwan trade and commerce. Doorknock team meets in Washington, D.C. with Undersecretary of Commerce Francisco Sanchez History AmCham registered with the Taipei City Government on 14 September 1951. The heads of five U.S. companies‚Äîthree trading companies and the oil companies Caltex and Standard Vacuum (the precursor of both Exxon and Mobil)‚Äîjoined together originally to lobby Washington to open Taiwan's procurement of equipment, raw materials, and commodities to U.S. private companies. After this early success, AmCham grew, with early members including Eli Lilly, Mattel, Timex, and distributors for U.S. motion pictures. By the 1960s, the Chamber was developing into an active professional organization: In 1967, it held its first formal breakfast meeting; in 1968, it became a founding member of the new Asia-Pacific Council of American Chambers (APCAC); and in 1969, AmCham published the first issue of its bimonthly magazine, now called Taiwan Business TOPICS. Supporting Economic Development U.S. companies played an important role in laying the groundwork for Taiwan's later economic achievements in the consumer electronics, computer, semiconductor, and flat panel display industries. General Instrument's decision in 1964 to set up a subsidiary on the island to make various electronic components was a pioneering investment that prompted other major U.S. electronics companies to follow suit and laid the groundwork for Taiwan's entry into consumer electronics, which eventually led to the production of computers, semiconductors, and flat panel displays. General Instrument grew into one of Taiwan's biggest employers; by 1980, it had 10,000 workers. American firms also helped advance Taiwan's 10 Big Projects, which in the 1970s provided the infrastructure foundation for the island's future economic prosperity. For Taiwan's first international-standard freeway‚Äîthe Sun Yat-sen Freeway stretching from Keelung to Kaohsiung‚ÄîU.S. engineering companies helped to conduct feasibility studies, design several sections, and provide construction engineering and inspection. Numerous American companies, including Amoco Chemical, Mesta Machine, General Electric (GE), Westinghouse, and U.S. Steel Corp., provided Taiwan's first integrated steel mill and its new petrochemical complex with investment, procurement, training, and engineering consultation. American firms like Texas Instruments and Varian Associates were early entrants into the Hsinchu Science Park. Established in 1980 and inspired by the Stanford Research Park that nurtured Silicon Valley, Hsinchu has helped foster the development of some renowned global technology companies. Helping Forge the Taiwan Relations Act Following the shock of U.S. derecognition of Taiwan, AmCham Taipei's leadership played an instrumental role in determining the form of the continued U.S. relationship with Taiwan. In 1976, under the chairmanship of Marinus ‚ÄúDutch‚Äù van Gessel, AmCham made the strategic decision not to oppose the improvement of U.S. relations with mainland China‚Äîas long as it was not done at the expense of Taiwan. Van Gessel had previously served as Deputy Assistant Secretary in the U.S. Department of Commerce and by 1976 was heading up the Taiwan operations of Corning Glass. Concerned with giving due consideration to the potential impact on U.S. business interests of any change in U.S. diplomatic relations, in January 1977, van Gessel wrote a paper entitled The U.S. and the ROC: A Businessman‚Äôs View‚ÄîA Position Paper of the American Chamber of Commerce in the ROC. The document laid out many of the principles later incorporated in the Taiwan Relations Act, the law passed by Congress in 1980 that has formed the basis of U.S. relations with Taiwan ever since. Van Gessel also testified before a Congressional committee in 1977, and he organized a letter-writing campaign to Congressional offices and others in Washington to argue that the U.S. commitment to Taiwan's security was not only a military and diplomatic issue, but also crucial to the stability of the business environment. The Shanghai Communique of 1972 made clear that the U.S. and China intended to normalize relations. Nevertheless, the timing of President Carter's announcement of derecognition of the R.O.C. in December 1978 caught Taiwan, and the American business community there, by surprise. According to the Chamber, \\"AmCham did not object to U.S. recognition of the PRC per se, but strongly objected to the terms of the agreement and to the discourtesy of the lack of proper advance notice to Taiwan.\\" Robert P. Parker (AmCham chairman in 1979 and 1980) played a key role in helping to reaffirm U.S. friendship with Taiwan. In February 1979, he represented AmCham in testimony before the U.S. Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee on the ‚ÄúOmnibus Legislation‚Äù that had been drafted by the U.S. State Department and proposed by the Carter Administration as the basis for future unofficial relations with ‚Äúthe people of Taiwan.‚Äù In his remarks, Parker emphasized that ‚Äúnormalization‚Äù jeopardized American economic interests in Taiwan and offered specific proposals for correcting the proposed legislation's failure to provide adequately for the security of Taiwan from threat or use of coercion from mainland China, as well as failure to offer a clear and sufficient legal framework for the continuation of U.S.-Taiwan relationships sufficient for continued trade and investment. Parker noted that the prompt enactment of these specific proposals ‚Äúwould not only be in the interest of American business, [but also] necessary to meet our country‚Äôs moral responsibilities to Taiwan and its people.‚Äù The final version of the Taiwan Relations Act (TRA) saw virtually all of AmCham's principal recommendations written into law. Managing the Impact of Derecognition In the wake of the official switch of U.S. diplomatic relations, uncertainty surrounded the potential impact on Americans and other foreign residents in Taiwan. As the U.S. embassy in Taipei wrapped up its operations, AmCham stepped in to serve as the main conduit for communication with the Taiwan authorities to preserve or establish needed expatriate community organizations. AmCham worked to establish International Community Radio Taiwan (ICRT) to replace the Armed Forced Network Taiwan (AFNT), which stopped broadcasting English-language news, entertainment, and vital emergency information on typhoons and earthquakes. The departure of the U.S. military also risked leaving a gap in social and recreational programs. The Chamber helped to create the Taipei Youth Program Association to provide recreational opportunities for expat children, and arranged for a new and larger location for the American Club in China (ACC). The Chamber also secured the legal status of the Taipei American School, then the sole large-scale institution of international education on the island. Encouraging WTO Accession and Cross-Border Flows In January 2002, Taiwan acceded to the World Trade Organization (WTO) under the name of Customs Territory of Taiwan, Penghu, Kinmen and Matsu. In 2008, Taiwan signed the Government Procurement Agreement (GPA) under the WTO and began regularly scheduled cross-Strait direct air service. Committed to the easy flow of people, goods, services, and investment, AmCham lobbied hard for these developments.

Overview Searls' journalism career began in 1971, when he worked as an editor and photographer for Wayne Today in New Jersey. A longtime advocate for open-source software, he has been involved with the Linux Journal since it began publishing in 1994. He became a Contributing Editor in 1996, Senior Editor since 1999, and Editor-in-Chief in 2018. His column \\"Linux for Suits\\" ran until 2007, and was followed by \\"EOF\\" inside each issue's back cover. His work with Linux Journal, and as an advocate of free software and open-source, earned him a Google-O'Reilly Open Source Award for Best Communicator in 2005. His byline has also appeared in many other publications, including OMNI, Wired, PC Magazine, The Standard, The Sun Magazine, Upside, Release 1.0 and The Globe and Mail. In early 1999 Searls joined Christopher Locke, David Weinberger and Rick Levine in writing The Cluetrain Manifesto, an iconoclastic website that was followed in January 2000 by the book with the same title. The book was published in nine languages. A 10th Anniversary edition came out in June 2009. Among Searls' contributions to the Manifesto was its first thesis, \\"Markets are conversations\\"‚Äîalso the title of the Cluetrain chapter he co-wrote with David Weinberger. Weinberger and Searls co- wrote \\"World of Ends: What the Internet Is and How to Stop Mistaking It for Something Else\\".

VRM tools and methods also help individuals engage with government and other non-commercial organizations. At the Center for Information Technology and Society (CITS) at the University of California, Santa Barbara, Searls is studying both the nature of infrastructure and of the Internet as a form of infrastructure. In April 2012, his book The Intention Economy: When Customers Take Charge was published. Searls coined the term in an article for Linux Journal. He wrote: \\"The Intention Economy grows around buyers, not sellers. It leverages the simple fact that buyers are the first source of money, and that they come ready-made. You don't need advertising to make them.\\" Background The nickname \\"Doc\\" is what Searls calls a \\"fossil remnant\\" of \\"Doctor Dave,\\" his humorous persona at WDBS (now WXDU) radio at Duke University in Durham, North Carolina, in the late 1970s.Getting rained out in a brainstorm, February 4, 2009, Doc Searls Weblog Following his work in radio, Searls co-founded Hodskins Simone & Searls (HS&S;).

It was among the last offences that were punishable by execution in the United Kingdom. The crime was created by the Dockyards etc. Protection Act 1772 (12 Geo. 3 c.24) passed by the Parliament of Great Britain and was designed to protect Royal Dockyards and vessels from arson attacks. It remained one of the few capital offences after reform of the death penalty in 1861, and remained in effect even after the death penalty was permanently abolished for murder in 1969. However, it was then eliminated by the Criminal Damage Act 1971.  Passage  The Dockyards etc. Protection Act 1772 was passed in order to protect Royal Navy ships, dockyards, and stores from damage. At the time, ships were built of flammable oak wood and tar, and the naval yards were full of these supplies. Punishment for violating the act was a death sentence. The first section created the offence of arson in the royal dockyards by making it an offence to burn or destroy Royal Navy ships, stores, or ammunition under penalty of death anywhere in the British Empire. The Act also provided that benefit of clergy was not an available defence for the crime. The second section also stated that offenders could be tried if the offence occurred anywhere outside of the realm. The act put a version of arson in statute law for the first time, as all arson previously had been under common law. Though Scotland had its own similar offence of wilful fire raising. At the time of the Act's passage, the death penalty was common; at the turn of the 19th century, 220 offences carried the death penalty. In 1861, Parliament passed the Offences against the Person Act 1861, as part of a series of criminal law consolidation acts, which sharply limited the death penalty to only five civilian crimes: arson in royal dockyards, murder, treason, espionage, and piracy with violence.  Case of John the Painter  John the Painter, hanged for committing arson in a royal dockyard in 1777. Only one prosecution was brought under the Act.R. v. Hill (1777) 20 St. Tr. 1317 In that case, the Scottish saboteur John the Painter (also known as James Hill or John Aitken) was prosecuted and executed in 1777 for setting the rope house at Portsmouth Royal Dockyard on fire. He was hanged from the mizzenmast of the frigate , the highest gallows erected in British history, with the frigate moored at Portsmouth Royal Dockyards in view of the damage he had caused. A crowd of 20,000 gathered to witness the hanging.  Repeal  The death penalty for murder was abolished in 1969, leaving the provisions of the Dockyards etc. Protection Act 1772 as one of the few crimes that retained the death penalty. In 1970, the Law Commission proposed that the crime of arson in royal dockyards be abolished in its draft Criminal Damage Bill as part of an update of the law on criminal damage. The reasoning was that the law was no longer required for its original purposes, as warships were no longer made of flammable materials. The resulting Criminal Damage Act received royal assent from Queen Elizabeth II in 1971 and the offence of arson in royal dockyards was abolished. In a speech in the House of Lords in 1998, Lord Goodhart stated that the dockyard arson offence disappeared from the list of capital crimes in 1971 \\"without, so far as I am aware, either comment or concern.\\" The Crime and Disorder Act 1998 and the Human Rights Act 1998 abolished the death penalty for all remaining crimes. Despite abolition in the United Kingdom, a 2004 episode of the comedy quiz show QI asserted that it is still popularly and erroneously believed that arson in royal dockyards continues to exist as a capital offence. Though similar crimes have occurred since abolition, they are now dealt with under general laws relating to arson.  Applicability outside of the United Kingdom  A 1975 report for the Australian state of Victoria found that the Dockyards etc. Protection Act 1772 was still apparently in force, as the sections of the Criminal Damage Act 1971 that repealed the Dockyards Act explicitly applied only to the United Kingdom. However, the offence of arson in royal dockyards is considered obsolete in Victoria, as the provisions have been superseded by the Victorian Crimes Act 1958 and the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914‚Äì1973. New South Wales also retained it, as it was viewed as being ultra vires for the Parliament of New South Wales to amend it. The British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar had the act incorporated into its law in the English Law (Application) Act 1962. Thus, the offence was retained in Gibraltarian law; however, section two was repealed in 1972. Until 2007, the act remained on the statute books in the Republic of Ireland, as British statutes formed a part of Irish law following the Kingdom of Ireland's absorption into the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland in 1801. It was fully repealed under schedules two and three of the Irish Statute Law Revision Act 2007.

The Dachau trials were held for all war criminals caught in the United States zones in occupied Germany and Austria, as well as for those individuals accused of committing war crimes against American citizens and its military personnel. The trials, which were held within the walls of the former Dachau concentration camp, were conducted entirely by American military personnel whose legal authority had been conferred by the Judge Advocate General's Department within the U.S. Third Army. Dachau was established on 10 March 1933 in Dachau, roughly 12 miles North of Munich, and was liberated on 29 April 1945. The Dachau trials were held at Dachau Concentration Camp due to the camp having the facilities to hold the trials, and also because many of those prisoners who had worked there were confined to the premises. The Dachau Military Tribunal's chief prosecutor was 32 year-old William Denson, a U.S. Army lawyer. The chief defence counsel was Lieutenant Colonel Douglas T. Bates Jr., an artillery officer and lawyer from Centerville, Tennessee. Proceedings The trials started in November 1945 and were adjourned in December. They were held by the American Military Tribunal, without a jury, but instead by a panel of seven men, one of whom was versed in international military law. The prosecution was different from most trials, in that the burden of proof was on the defense. The charges to be carried out by the United States Military were against Germans such as camp guards, some SS units and medical personnel, who had taken part in war crimes against allied nationals. The Dachau Trials consisted of 465 trials from not only the Dachau concentration camp, but also Flossenb√ºrg concentration camp, Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp complex, Nordhausen concentration camp, Buchenwald concentration camp, and M√ºhldorf concentration camp complex and consisted of four main categories of charges: main camp offense, subsidiary camp offenses, atrocities against downed fliers, and then a catchall category mainly consisting of details about the Malmedy Massacre. On December 13, 1947 when the trials adjourned, roughly 1200 defendants had been tried with roughly a 73% conviction rate. Unlike the International Military Trials in Nuremberg that prosecuted the major Nazi war criminals under the jurisdiction of the four Allied Occupying Powers, the Dachau tribunals were held exclusively by the United States military between November 1945 and August 1948. The proceedings were similar to the 12 post-1946 Nuremberg trials that were also conducted solely by the United States. All the hearings were held within Dachau because it was, at the time, the best known of the Nazi concentration camps and it would act as a backdrop for the trials by underlining the moral corruption of the Nazi regime. During almost three years, the American military tribunals tried 1,672 German alleged war criminals in 489 separate proceedings. In total 1,416 former members of the Nazi regime were convicted; of these, 297 received death sentences and 279 were sentenced to life in prison. All convicted prisoners were sent to War Criminals Prison #1 at Landsberg am Lech to serve their sentences or to be hanged. Two of the most highly publicised trials concerned the activities of German forces during the Battle of the Bulge in late 1944. In the Malmedy massacre trial, 73 members of the Waffen-SS were found guilty of summarily executing 84 American prisoners of war during the attack. In another trial, former German commando Otto Skorzeny and nine officers from the Panzer Brigade 150, were found not guilty of breaching the rules of war contrary to the Hague Convention of 1907 for wearing American military uniforms in a false flag operation, Operation Greif.The trial of Otto Skorzeny and others in the General Military Government Court of the U.S. Zone of Germany.Some Noteworthy War Criminals Source: History of the United Nations War Crimes Commission and the Development of the Laws of War.

He was born in Bloomsbury, London to Methodist parents. He had a somewhat Puritanical upbringing, his father Henry Simpson Lunn (1859-1939), founder of Lunn's Travel agency that would become Lunn Poly) having strong religious beliefs which were in conflict with his talent as a businessman. Arnold Lunn and Hugh Kingsmill were his brothers. His most important work as a writer was 'Switchback', his autobiography published in 1948. Its highlight is Brian's description of a mental breakdown he had while serving in Mesopotamia in the 11th Black Watch. The onset of his breakdown was described as follows: 'Men and beasts passed through the haze, black outlines; a troup of mules with Indian driver was a stately silhouette; shambling after them a bucket-carrying menial with tousled turban and bedraggled shirt flapping round flexed knees was an immortal grotesque, raised above the plane of human need and anxiety. The Platonic Idea, as interpreted by Schopenhauer, the basis of art. Removed from all appeal to the will, the horrible was transmuted into the beautiful. He was, in fact, a sanitary man staggering back from a punishment fatigue; constantly in trouble, he would incur more fatigues, with stoppages of pay, staggering in the bog of inefficiency under implacable authority. ' '...I looked along the river banks - tents and incinerators, horses and mules, soldiers, native and European, a complex of endeavour in an enterprise as unreal as all the day-to-day needs and anxieties and discomforts, ambitions and humiliations of each individual, were real.' 'Unreal? The word came back to me as a sudden illumination. That was it, it was all a staged show.' The delusions which accompanied this insight were hardly more absurd than the futilities of war. His other books were a biography of Martin Luther, a travel guide to Belgium and a history of the Rothschild family. \\"Salvation Dynasty\\" was Brian Lunn's account of the Salvation Army's founders.

The weapon was developed in the late 1990s and was first seen publicly in September 2001. It has been selected to replace the 7.62 mm MG3 general- purpose machine gun in the Bundeswehr at the squad support level; it will complement the MG3 in other roles. The MG4 will also be the secondary armament of the new Puma infantry fighting vehicle. Overall, it is designed to be light, provide maximum safety to the user and function reliably under adverse conditions using a wide range of ammunition from different manufacturers, without the need to adjust the gas system. The machine gun was initially known as the MG43 prior to its adoption by the Bundeswehr.  Design details  German Army MG4 with a telescopic sight. The MG4 is an air-cooled, belt-fed gas-operated light machine gun with a positively locked rotary bolt and is somewhat similar in concept to the Belgian Minimi light machine gun. Safety mechanisms on the machine gun includes a manual safety incorporated into the fire mode selector toggle; setting the fire selector lever on the \\"safe\\" position blocks the trigger mechanically and locks the bolt in the cocked position. When the bolt is not pulled back completely, accidental firing is prevented by an integral, automatic mechanism that prevents the bolt from traveling forward. In addition, the firing pin cannot reach the cartridge primer until the cartridge has been fully chambered. The machine gun is fed from a disintegrating belt and is carried out in two stages from the top left using an enhanced pawl mechanism. As on the MG42 family of machine guns, the belt is expelled to the right and spent cases are ejected downwards, although sideways ejection to the right is an option. The MG4 has a hammer-forged quick-change barrel that can be safely exchanged when hot without the need for protective gloves; the carrying handle serves as the barrel change grip. The barrel assembly weighs . To reduce the overall length of the weapon for transport, the butt stock can be folded to the left side of the receiver. With the buttstock folded the MG4 remains fully operable. A field cleaning kit is housed within the stock. The MG4 takes zero shifts between barrel assemblies into account by making the front sight of the assemblies mechanically adjustable. In its standard form, the MG4 is equipped with closed type iron sights with range settings up to in increments. The folding front sight element is mounted on the barrel assembly and is adjustable mechanically for both windage and elevation. The sight line radius is . Optical or night sights or laser pointers can be mounted on a length of MIL-STD-1913 Picatinny rail located on the receiver feed tray cover. Bundeswehr models are equipped with telescopic sights with 3√ó magnification. A folding bipod weighing is provided. Supporting interfaces are integrated into the receiver to allow the MG4 to be mounted on the standard American M122A1 tripod for increased accuracy and stability.

The film's title means \\"everything is going well\\". It was released in the United States under the title All's Well and internationally under the title Just Great. The Godard/Gorin collaboration continued with the featurette Letter to Jane as a postscript to Tout va bien. Overview The film centers on a strike at a sausage factory which is witnessed by an American reporter and her French husband, who is a director of TV commercials. The film has a strong political message which outlines the logic of the class struggle in France in the wake of the May 1968 civil unrest. It also examines the social destruction caused by capitalism. The performers in Tout va bien employ the Brechtian technique of distancing themselves from the audience. By delivering an opaque performance, the actors draw the audience away from the film's diegesis and towards broader inferences about the film's meaning. The factory set in Tout va bienThe factory set consists of a cross-sectioned building and allows the camera to dolly back and forth from room to room, theoretically through the walls. Another self-reflexive technique, this particular set was used because it forces the audience to remember that they are witnessing a film, breaking the fourth wall in a literal sense. This type of staging was appropriated from Jerry Lewis's film The Ladies Man.

Falsely attributed to Methodius of Olympus,Alexander (1985) p. 15. a fourth century Church Father, the work attempts to make sense of the Islamic conquest of the Near East.Ballard (2011) p. 51. The Apocalypse is noted for incorporating numerous aspects of Christian eschatology such as the invasion of Gog and Magog, the rise of the Antichrist, and the tribulations that precede the end of the world. The Apocalypse, however, adds a new element to Christian eschatology: the rise of a messianic Roman emperor. This element would remain in Christian apocalyptic literature until the end of the medieval period. Translations into Greek, Latin, Slavonic, Arabic, and other languages from the early eighth century onwards would facilitate the Apocalypse‚Äôs influence.Jackson (2001) pp. 347, 348. The text=Authorship, location, and translations The Apocalypse is attributed to Methodius of Olympus in the Syriac text,Griffith (2008) p. 33. of Patara in the Greek, both of whom lived in the fourth century.Louth (2010) p. 247. In all likelihood, however, the text was written in the seventh century by an unnamed Christian cleric, hence the moniker of Pseudo-Methodius, who was most likely of the Jacobite, Chalcedonian, or Melkite branch of Christianity. Scholars have argued that the work was written as a contemporary to the Arab Conquests in response to the hardships faced by Christians and widespread apostasy to avoid taxations. As well, the author sees the invasion occurring as punishment from God.Griffith (2008) p. 32.Griffith (2010) p. 201.Guenther (2007) p. 371. The text, therefore, employs historiography, geography, and apocalyptic prophecy. The text was originally written in Syriac in Northern Syria. Early scholarship, however, lacked the original Syrian text, and so relied heavily on Greek, Latin, and Slavonic texts for study. In 1897, the scholar V. Istrin relied heavily on the Greek text and at the same time, and independently, Sackur studied the oldest Latin translations. Both of these studies ushered in the scholarly study of the Apocalypse, but it was not until 1931 that the original Syriac manuscript was discovered. With this find, Michael Kmosko was able to ascertain that original Apocalypse of Pseudo- Methodius to have been written in the Syriac language. Content The manuscript begins with a history of the world, starting with Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden, through to the Muslim conquests, and into the end-times. One notable feature about the work is the presence of sexuality with regards to Christian behavior in the end days‚Äîspecifically discussing swinging, homosexuality, and cross-dressing as indicators of a sinful society.Garstad (2012), p. 39 et seq. It is only then that the text says the ‚Äúsons of Ishmael‚Äù, that is Muslims, will emerge from the desert of Ethribus to inflict God‚Äôs punishment upon the Christians who ‚Äúslipped into depravity‚Äù. The Apocalypse also recounts the events that took place at the hands of Muslims in the previous decades.Ballard (2011) p. 52. In invoking figures in other Christian eschatological literature, such as Gog and Magog, Pseudo-Methodius attempts to legitimize his place as a fourth century Church Father.Jackson (2001) p. 353. The manuscript also notes the rise of an Emperor-Saviour figure, echoing the fourth century AD prophecy contributed to the legendary Tiburtine Sibyl.Alexander (1985) p. 152. This Roman emperor will save the Christian lands from ‚Äúthe sons of Ishmael‚Äù, place his crown upon the cross ‚Äúfor the sake of the common salvation of all‚Äù thereby saving Christendom as a whole.Debi√© (2005) p. 65. The work is notable for its vivid description and brutality. Descriptions of drinking the blood of cattle,Garstad (2012) p. 15. stabbing pregnant women, and feeding babies to animalsGarstad (2012) p. 47. permeate throughout the author‚Äôs work. Ballard notes, however, that Pseudo- Methodius deviates from previous eschatological literature, such as Revelation, in that the Apocalypse utilizes Roman emperors as agents of change. For this reason, Griffith notes, the Apocalypse marks the end of the antique era and the dawn of the Middle Ages. Guenther also notes that Pseudo- Methodius was influenced by the books Revelation and Daniel, maintaining the lineage of Christian literature. This is an important feature as it shows the author was most likely a Christian cleric and was familiar with past Christian writings. By introducing new features into Christian literature while keeping core Christian beliefs and teachings intact helped to make the Apocalypse accessible to the laity, as well. Part of the Apocalypse‚Äôs influence is attributed to its ability to reflect the beliefs of Eastern Roman citizens; they are merely acting out foretold events, and mankind is bound with the fate of the empire and the capital.Shepard (2010) p. 7. This, again, helped to endear the piece to a widespread Byzantine audience. Historical context Rome and Sassanid Persia had been at war with one another for much of the first quarter of the seventh century. With both empires still feeling the effects of such a long series of battles, an Arab threat took advantage of the weakening empires. The Persians faced defeat west of the Euphrates in Qadisiyya in what Griffith calls ‚Äúthe beginning of the demise of both Roman and Persian rule for good‚Äù.Griffith (2008) p. 23. This demise would continue throughout the 630s and 640s, as the Arabs conquered much of the Middle East and the Mediterranean world. In 635, Damascus fell, Jerusalem and Antioch followed in 637, Edessa in 640, Alexandria in 642, and Seleucia/Ctesiphon in 645. Three out of the five patriarchates of Roman Christendom were under Arab Muslim rule.Griffith (2008) p. 24. In 674, the Ummayad Caliph Muawiyah launched a land and sea assault on Constantinople. Within three years he was defeated and turned his attention on the rest of the surviving Roman Empire, namely the Middle East, Greece, and the Balkans. As Ballard notes, Constantinople was ‚Äúreduced to a small Christian enclave within an ocean of Islam.‚Äù A campaign by the new Muslim rulers was set in place in order to remove any public display of Christian symbolism through building Islamic- styled buildings and issuing coins declaring an Islamic triumph. The most dramatic of such constructions was the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem.Griffith (2010) p. 200. The inscriptions on the Dome of the Rock are taken from the Quran and ‚Äúproclaim the arrival of a powerful empire that was founded on pure monotheist belief.‚Äù This, as Ballard and Griffith both note, was in response to Christians believing in the trinity, and their supposed worship of the Virgin Mary and the Saints something that Muslims saw as polytheistic. To defend themselves and without any real power or authority, Christians turned to writing. The hardships Christians faced in a Muslim territory caused a ‚Äúliterary awakening‚Äù, and the earliest of these texts were written in Syriac, Greek, and Arabic. Syriac writers in particular reacted to their world in apocalyptic terms ‚Äì the fall of their Christian empire was continuing with each Muslim conquest and Syriac writers saw these conquests as a punishment from God. The most well-known of these texts was the Apocalypse attributed to Pseudo-Methodius. Translations, spread, and influence of the Apocalypse The Apocalypse marks the end of antiquity and the beginning of the Middle Ages because of its style and influence. The document was frequently copied and readapted in order to fit the cataclysmic events that occurred in a particular area. By the early 8th century, the work was translated into Greek and then Latin and other languages. The Apocalypse was most likely translated into Latin by Petrus Monachus in Francia.Pollard (2010) p. 27. The spread and influence of the Apocalypse was so far reaching that during the Mongol invasions of the 13th century, Russian Christians invoked the work of Pseudo- Methodius in order to explain the onslaught by using the historical and geographical explanations found within the text. As well, Christians believed Pseudo-Methodius had predicted the Mongols‚Äô arrival because of their lifestyle, dietary habits, and activities. However, Pelle notes the Apocalypse was not popular in England before the Norman Conquests, despite the popularity of other eschatological literature. Of the almost twenty-four pre-twelfth century Latin manuscripts, only two were in English and none were from before 1075. With the invasion of England by the Normans, however, one of the earliest English texts to explain the invasion of ‚Äúheathens‚Äù on a Christian land included the Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius.Pelle (2009) p. 325. The Apocalypse was invoked by Christians throughout the centuries in order to explain the turmoil they faced in their respective time and place. As well, it shaped Western Christendom‚Äôs view of Islam through the Middle Ages because of various re-adaptions and translations. With the fall of more Christian cities from the fourteenth century onwards, along with Constantinople in 1453, the Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius was invoked once again. Modern context Griffith notes, because of questions surrounding the historicity of the Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius, it is easy to dismiss the piece outright. However, for the historian the Apocalypse sheds a light on the environment of the age and therefore the literature is still relevant. Furthermore, the literature is important because of the anonymity of its author. In a sense, this anonymity lends a sense of ‚Äúunderground literature‚Äù.Griffith (2008) p. 39. Furthermore, the Apocalypse of Pseudo-Methodius allowed the population, regardless of locale, to maintain a ‚Äúsense of seemingly rightful superiority‚Äù despite evidence to the contrary.

Born in Bridgewater, Nova Scotia, he received a B.A. in Biology from Acadia University in 1939, a M.Sc. from Dalhousie University in 1942, and an M.D., C.M. from McGill University in 1945. Attending Merton College, Oxford as a Rhodes Scholar he received his D. Phil in 1949. After completing his residency, Feindel was in neurosurgical practice for two years with Wilder Penfield at the Montreal Neurological Institute. In 1955 he founded the Neurosurgical Department at the University Hospital in Saskatoon. In 1959 Feindel re-joined the Montreal Neurological Institute where he founded the William Cone Laboratory for Neurosurgical Research and became the first William Cone Professor of Neurosurgery and then Director of the MNI from 1972 to 1984. During this tenure he led a clinical neuroscience team to acquire the first CAT and combined MRI/S units in Canada and to develop the world's first PET system utilizing a prototype Japanese \\"Baby\\" cyclotron and the MNI-designed BGO crystal PET scanner for detecting brain tumours and stroke. He integrated these systems into a Brain Imaging Center (BIC), within a major extension of the MNI, opened in 1984 and since then recognized as a leading world center for clinical diagnosis, teaching and research in neuro-imaging. In the early 1950s, during brain mapping studies with Penfield and Jasper, Feindel discovered the role of the amygdala in patients with temporal lobe seizures, which, with related studies at the MNI, led to the operation of antero-mesial temporal lobe resection often referred to as \\"the Montreal procedure\\", an operation adopted worldwide for the surgical cure of many thousands of patients with epilepsy. Feindel was curator of the Wilder Penfield Archive. He was the Chancellor of Acadia University from 1991 to 1996 and then Honorary Governor. In 1998 he was elected Honorary Osler Librarian by the Board of Curators of the Osler Library of the History of Medicine at McGill University. At the 2005 Neuro Convocation, he was given a Lifetime Achievement Award of the Montreal Neurological Institute.

Those with the disorder usually have suffered from a right hemisphere frontal or temporal brain lesion typically affecting the cortical areas, basal ganglia or limbic structures. These people develop a new, post-injury passion for gourmet food. There are two main aspects of gourmand syndrome: first, the fine dining habits and changes to taste, and second, the obsessive component, which may result in craving and preservation. Gourmand syndrome can be related to, and shares biological features with, addictive and obsessive disorders. The syndrome was first characterised in 1997.  Signs and symptoms  * A new-found obsession for fine foods * Wanting to write, talk, eat, about refined foods  Causes  It is believed that the frontotemporal circuits, normally involved in healthy eating, can, when injured, cause gourmand syndrome in patients.  History  Only 36 people had been diagnosed with gourmand syndrome as of 2001. In many of these cases, the patient did not have any interest in food beforehand nor had any family history with eating disorders. The first, most famous case was seen in 1997 by Regard and Landis in the journal Neurology: after a Swiss stroke patient was released from the hospital, he immediately quit his job as a political journalist and took up the profession of food critic. Regard and Landis also observed an athletic businessman with this condition whose family was shocked to see such a sudden, drastic change in his diet. Only one case of gourmand syndrome has been reported in a child. He was born with issues with his right temporal lobe; at eight years old he began to experience seizures, within the year of the seizures beginning, his behavior began to change to the symptoms of gourmand syndrome. In 2014, a man that was once interested in marathon running now was only interested in gastronomy, traveling hundreds or thousands of miles to eat gourmet food. He became a famous gastronomic critic and gained 50 kg (110 pounds).

She began training with The Fabulous Moolah right after finishing high school. In the 1980s, as part of the World Wrestling Federation (WWF)'s Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection, a storyline that combined wrestling and music, Kai defeated Wendi Richter to become the Women's Champion. Kai, however, lost the title at the inaugural WrestleMania event. She was later paired with Judy Martin, in a tag team that would become known as The Glamour Girls. The team held the Women's Tag Team Championship twice (managed by \\"The Mouth of the South\\" Jimmy Hart) and the LPWA Tag Team Championship once. In her later career, Kai returned briefly to the WWF in 1994, challenging for the Women's Championship at WrestleMania X. She also wrestled for World Championship Wrestling under the name Patty Stonegrinder and held the NWA World Women's Championship.  Professional wrestling career = Training and early career  Seymour was trained by The Fabulous Moolah in 1975 right after she finished high school. She was originally from Florida, but because Moolah thought she looked a little bit Hawaiian, Seymour was given the ring name Leilani Kai.Ellison, Lillian. First Goddess of the Squared Circle, p.145. Her fellow wrestlers also bestowed upon her the nickname \\"The Hawaiian Princess\\" during her early career. Four weeks after beginning her training, Moolah sent her on a two-week tour of Alaska. Over the next few years she worked for promotions throughout the United States, including in Oklahoma, Minnesota, California, and New York. It was in 1979 in North Carolina, that Kai first began working with Judy Martin, who would be her future tag team partner.  World Wrestling Federation  Women's Champion (1985) = On July 23, 1984, Wendi Richter defeated The Fabulous Moolah at MTV's The Brawl to End it All for the WWF Women's Championship, ending what was billed as the longest championship reign in professional wrestling history (Moolah's 28-year reign, though in reality she had won and lost the title on numerous occasions and Richter actually ended a 7-year reign).Shields, Brian. Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s, p.105 As a result, in early 1985, Kai‚Äîwho had been trained by Moolah‚Äîwrestled Richter and defeated her for the title at The War to Settle the Score, with Moolah in her corner and singer Cyndi Lauper in Richter's corner. Richter, however, regained the title at the first-ever WrestleMania one month later. These matches were part of the WWF's \\"Rock 'n' Wrestling Connection\\", an era that combined both music and professional wrestling. = The Glamour Girls (1985-1989) = Kai was then paired with Judy Martin, and the duo won the WWF Women's Tag Team Championship from the champions Velvet McIntyre and Desiree Petersen in Egypt in August 1985, although this match's existence has been disputed. Information also available at Solie's Title Histories. Meanwhile, in August 1986, Kai traveled to Japan where she won All Japan Women's Pro-Wrestling's All Pacific Championship from Chigusa Nagayo, whom she also lost the title to in April 1987. In November 1987, Kai and Martin became known as The Glamour Girls, and she underwent an image change that involved bleaching her dark hair platinum blonde at the suggestion of their manager Jimmy Hart. The duo appeared at the first Survivor Series in 1987 as part of then champion Sherri Martel's team to face the Fabulous Moolah's team.Shields, Brian.

Kai and Martin feuded in 1988 with Japanese imports the Jumping Bomb Angels for the Women's Tag Team Championship. The two teams staged a two out of three falls match at the first Royal Rumble event in 1988, with the Jumping Bomb Angels capturing the gold. Kai and Martin recaptured the title months later in June 1988 before the belts were once again abandoned in 1989 when the company lost interest in the women's division.  Ladies Professional Wrestling Association (1990-1991)  The Glamour Girls then surfaced in the newly formed Ladies Professional Wrestling Association (LPWA), managed by Adnan El Kassey. In February 1991, they won the LPWA Tag Team Championship from the team of Misty Blue and Heidi Lee Morgan. Leilani Kai appeared on the November 10, 1991 episode of WCW Main Event, losing to Madusa. They retained the Tag Team Championship against Malia Hosaka and Bambi at the only LPWA pay per view Superladies Showdown in 1992. The title was abandoned when the promotion closed.  Later career  Kai returned to the WWF on March 20, 1994 at WrestleMania X to unsuccessfully challenge Alundra Blayze in a Women's Championship match. On October 20, 1996, she wrestled Madusa in a losing effort during WCW WorldWide. In the later 1990s, Kai returned to World Championship Wrestling under the name Patty Stonegrinder, usually wrestling against Madusa. Kai traded the NWA Mid-Atlantic Women's Championship with Strawberry Fields in 2000, holding the belt a total of three times. In the summer of 2002, Kai challenged Lexie Fyfe for the Professional Girl Wrestling Association's (PGWA) championship in Branson, Missouri and won the belt. In 2002, however, Pippa L'Vinn defeated her for the title. On March 12, 2003, she defeated Madison to win the NWA World Women's Championship in a dark match on a Total Nonstop Action Wrestling pay-per-view. She defended the belt at the NWA 55th Anniversary Show against AJ Sparx in October 2003. She was later stripped of the title by NWA President Bill Behrens on June 19, 2004 after Kai no-showed several events. After becoming less active in the ring, she also began training female wrestlers, including Amber O'Neal. She also served as a trainer for the California-based Women of Wrestling. On September 5, 2013 it was announced that Kai will debut at Pro Wrestling Syndicate Bombshells against Sumie Sakai on September 28 in Iselin, NJ. On May 31, 2014 Kai appeared on West Coast Wrestling Connection, slapping Kylie Sutton for allegedly implying that she was old. The following week, Kai was scheduled to face Sutton in a match. After refusing to participate, she forced her manager Jonny Fairplay to take her place. Sutton won the match by DQ after Kai entered the ring and attacked her, before referees pulled her off.  Personal life  In addition to wrestling, Seymour has trained with nunchucks for at least two years. She also rides motorcycles, deep sea fishes, and hunts wild boar.

He is currently Professor Emeritus in physics at the University of Toronto and is also an adjunct Professor in physics at the University of Waterloo and a resident affiliate member of the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics. Moffat is best known for his work on gravity and cosmology, culminating in his nonsymmetric gravitational theory and scalar‚Äìtensor‚Äìvector gravity (now called MOG), and summarized in his 2008 book for general readers, Reinventing Gravity. His theory explains galactic rotation curves without invoking dark matter. He proposes a variable speed of light approach to cosmological problems. The speed of light c may have been more than 30 orders of magnitude higher during the early moments of the Big Bang. His recent work on inhomogeneous cosmological models purports to explain certain anomalous effects in the CMB data, and to account for the recently discovered acceleration of the expansion of the universe. Moffat has proposed a new nonlocal variant of quantum field theory, that is finite at all orders and hence dispenses with renormalization. It also generates mass without a Higgs mechanism. Early life and education Kawarthas Landscape by John Moffat Moffat was born in Copenhagen, Denmark, the son of a Scottish father, George Moffat, and Danish mother, Esther (n√©e Winther). His father, a musician from Glasgow, was performing in a night club in Copenhagen when he met Esther, a dancer. They married three weeks later. In 1938, on the eve of the Second World War, John's father moved the family to London, correctly predicting that Denmark would be invaded by Germany. In later 1939, during the Blitz, the 7-year-old John was evacuated to Glasgow to live with his grandparents. But he failed to thrive in Glasgow, struggling academically, so after a year he returned to his parents, and all three moved to Bristol, where his father got a job searching ships for German spies. In Bristol, they lived close to the factory that manufactured the Bristol F2 Fighters. Air raids were frequent as the Battle of Britain intensified in 1940. One day, they went to the boardwalk at Weston-super-Mare to escape the raids in Bristol, only to have German planes appear overhead. As Moffat recalled in his memoir, Einstein Wrote Back: > \\"I heard the shriek of the whistling bombs as they fell, and then the hollow > booms as they detonated deep inside the mud of the beach... The blast blew > my parents and me across the road adjacent to the boardwalk. I landed in a > garden on my back, opened my eyes and stared at the blue sky, and there was > a loud ringing in my ears. The blood was pouring out of my nose, and I felt > a terrible tightness and pain in my chest... In a daze, I got up, and soon > discovered my parents in the same garden, on all fours, attempting to stand > up, also suffering from nosebleeds and chest pains.\\" The trauma from the bombing and the air-raids stayed with him for a lifetime, Moffat wrote: > \\"At the time, I was somehow able to suppress the horror of our experiences > during the war, and carry on day by day. However, about a year after the > bombings in Bristol and Weston-super-Mare, I began suffering from what is > now called post-traumatic stress disorder. I began getting severe nightmares > and panic attacks. Even today I still occasionally experience panic attacks, > generally when I am visiting Europe.\\" When John was 7 or 8, his father took him to a psychiatrist in London because he insisted on reading sentences and clocks backward. The psychiatrist told his father that he was a genius. John, overhearing, did not think the word meant much for his future. After the war, the family moved back to Denmark, where John's father started an import-export business. He contracted tuberculosis from one of his employees and became seriously ill for a year, and the family struggled to get by. Interest in physics As a teenager, Moffat quit school at 16 to become an artist. He gave up after living for a time in Paris with no income. Upon returning to Copenhagen, he became interested in the cosmos and began teaching himself mathematics and physics. The University of Copenhagen allowed anyone to check out books from its libraries, and he made such quick progress that within a year he began working on problems of general relativity and unified field theory. When Moffat was about 20 years old, he wrote a letter to Albert Einstein, informing the great physicist that he was working on one of his theories. \\"Dear Professor . . . I would be eternally indebted if you could find time to read my work,\\" he began. > \\"In 1953 Einstein sent me a reply, from Princeton, New Jersey, but it was > written in German. So I ran down to my barber shop (in Copenhagen) to have > my barber translate it for me. Through that summer and fall, we exchanged > about a half dozen letters. The local press picked up on these stories which > then caught the attention of physicist Niels Bohr and others. Suddenly doors > of opportunity were swinging open for me\\". (Perimeter Institute for > Theoretical Physics, 2005) Einstein's initial reply: > \\"Most honorable Mr. Moffat: Our situation is the following. We are standing > in front of a closed box which we cannot open, and we try hard to discuss > what is inside and what is not,\\" Einstein replied. Moffat's correspondence with Einstein and meeting with Bohr drew the attention of officials at the British consulate in Copenhagen, and he was invited to study at Cambridge. In 1958, he was awarded a PhD without a first degree at Trinity College, Cambridge. He was supervised by Fred Hoyle and Abdus Salam. Variable speed of light: theory and controversy In 1992, John Moffat proposed that the speed of light was much larger in the early universe, in which the speed of light had a value of more than 1030 km/s. He published his \\"variable speed of light\\" (VSL) theory in two places‚Äîon the Los Alamos National Laboratory's (LANL) online archive, 16 Nov. 1992, and in a 1993 edition of International Journal of Modern Physics D.Michael Martin (24 March 2003)\\"In From the Cold: A Toronto physicist's once-ridiculed theory gains acceptance\\" Maclean's Michael Martin (1 July 2003) \\"In the Shadow of the Speed of Light\\" , St. Louis Journalism Review The scientific community mostly ignored VSL theory until in 2001, University of New South Wales astronomer John Webb and peers detected experimental evidence from telescopic observations that the cosmological fine structure constant‚Äîwhich contains the speed of light‚Äîmay have been different than its present value in the very early Universe. The observations supported Moffat's VSL theory‚Äîand started a race for primacy that began in 1998. That year, five years after Moffat had published his VSL papers, Jo√£o Magueijo of Imperial College in London, and collaborators Andrew Albrecht of the University of California at Davis and John D. Barrow of Cambridge University, published a strikingly similar idea in the more prestigious journal, Physical Review D, which had rejected Moffat's paper years earlier. Informed of the omission, Magueijo credited Moffat with an entire chapter in Magueijo's 2002 book, Faster Than the Speed of Light: The story of a scientific speculation. The controversy reignited, however, when during a worldwide publicity tour for Magueijo's book, the author neither credited Moffat nor corrected numerous erroneous press accounts‚Äîin such magazines as Discover,Tim Folger (April, 2003) \\"Was Einstein Wrong?\\" Discover Magazine Publisher's Weekly,Judith Rosen (1 January 2003) \\"Physics Brat: First-time author takes on Einstein\\" Publisher's Weekly Seed Magazine and the Christian Science Monitor.Lori Valigra (30 January 2003) \\"New theory on light weighs heavily on scientists: A brash young theoretical physicist claims Einstein was wrong\\" Christian Science Monitor In efforts to portray Magueijo as a \\"brash, young scientific upstart,\\" dozens of publications attributed VSL theory entirely to Magueijo and his co-authors, leaving Moffat‚Äîin his late sixties by this time‚Äîout. Moffat expressed displeasure about the re-emergent omissions, urging reporters to check their facts, but to no avail. Stories emerged about the book tour media omissions in March and July 2003, written by a science journalist, Michael Martin, who had earlier attributed VSL theory to Moffat in a 2001 UPI article about Webb's astronomical discoveries.Michael Martin (17 August 2001) \\"That Speed of Light Varies Long Suspected\\" United Press International Discover Magazine writer Tim Folger acknowledged the omissions in his story and apologized. In response to a reader letter from Henry van Driel of the University of Toronto Department of Physics, Folger wrote, \\"Professor van Driel is absolutely right‚ÄîJohn Moffat did develop a varying speed of light theory several years before Jo√£o Magueijo, and I regret not including that information in my story.\\"Reader Letters (June 2003) Discover Magazine Months later, as other reports picked up on the reignited dispute,Dan Falk (8 Nov. 2003) \\"Maverick Physicist\\" Toronto Globe and Mail Magueijo reiterated Moffat's primacy in VSL theory. In September 2004, Discover Magazine's Tim Folger followed through on a promise he had made during the controversy to \\"write a story about John Moffat.\\"Tim Folger (4 Sept. 2004) \\"Einstein's Grand Quest for a Unified Theory\\" Discover Magazine The two physicists became friends, publishing a joint paper in 2007 in the journal General Relativity and Gravitation. Modified gravity theory Continuing Einstein's search for a unified field theory, Moffat proposed a nonsymmetric gravitational theory that, like Einstein's unified field, incorporated a symmetric field (gravity) and an antisymmetric field. Unlike Einstein, however, Moffat made no attempt to identify the latter with electromagnetism, instead proposing that the antisymmetric component is another manifestation of gravity. As investigation progressed, the theory evolved in a variety of ways; most notably, Moffat postulated that the antisymmetric field may be massive. The current version of his modified gravity (MOG) theory, which grew out of this investigation, modifies Einstein's gravity with the addition of a vector field, while also promoting the constants of the theory to scalar fields. The combined effect of these fields modifies the strength of gravity at large distances when large masses are involved, successfully accounting for a range of astronomical and cosmological observations. The resulting theory describes well, without invoking dark matter, the rotation curves of galaxiesJ. W. Moffat, S. Rahvar, The MOG weak field approximation and observational test of galaxy rotation curves; arXiv:1306.6383 and the mass profiles of X-ray galaxy clusters.J. W. Moffat, S. Rahvar, The MOG Weak Field approximation II. Observational test of Chandra X-ray Clusters, arXiv:1309.5077 Non-local quantum field theory In 1990, Moffat proposed a finite, non-local quantum field theory. The theory was developed extensively by Evens, Moffat, Kleppe and Woodard in 1991. In subsequent work, Moffat proposed this theory as an alternative to the standard electroweak unification of electromagnetism and the weak nuclear interactions. Moffat's theory is a quantum field theory with a non-local term in the field Lagrangian. The theory is gauge invariant and it is finite to all orders of perturbation theory. For the standard model it can solve the Higgs boson mass hierarchy naturalness problem.J. W. Moffat, Beyond The Standard Model; arxiv:hep-ph/9802228 It also leads to a finite quantum gravity theory.

The island covers an area of and had 40 inhabitants in January 2018. The island is part of Esbjerg Municipality and is situated approximately southwest of the ancient town of Ribe. Mand√∏ is barely accessible at high tide over an unpaved surface level causeway of about four kilometers in length that connects the island to the mainland. Extensive mudflats and tidal marshes encircle the island and provide breeding areas to multitudes of birds and other organisms.C.M. Hogan, Ecology and Geology of Mand√∏ Island, Lumina Technologies, July 9, 2006 In the past centuries a large earthen dike has been constructed around the perimeter of the island, although substantially set back from the shoreline. This artifice has allowed conventional farming in the form of grain growing and sheep grazing. Mand√∏ is technically a hallig, although it is far from the ten German islands commonly described by that term. The name was formerly often spelled Man√∏. Logistics of access Causeway to Mand√∏ Conventional motor vehicles can access Mand√∏ Island via a causeway unpaved roadway, although this route is compromised in storms at high tide. The nearest village on the mainland which is the gateway to Mand√∏ Island is Vester Vedsted.Denmark and Southern Sweden, Hammond International, Hammond World Atlas Company, Germany (2005) This simple causeway road is no more than copious gravel laid down on an immense mudflat, with required frequent periodic maintenance of added gravels. Alternatively many visitors reach the island by way of a specially designed tractor pulled bus with greatly oversized tires. This vehicle is capable of traversing some of the firmer mudflats, but only at the lowest tides.Ribe, Denmark's oldest town, Ribe Turistbureau, Ribe, Denmark (2005) In any case private vehicles or the \\"Mand√∏ bus\\" leave the mainland at the point of the Wadden Sea Centre, which offers nature information and boasts a small museum devoted to the natural history of Mand√∏. Mand√∏ is located midway between the two larger islands Fan√∏ and R√∏m√∏ which are connected to the mainland by a ferry and a road running across a causeway, respectively. Geology and regional setting Sheep grazing on Mand√∏ Island Mand√∏ is geographically one of the northernmost islands among the North Frisian Islands off the southwestern Danish and northwestern German coast.Rand McNally Goode's World Atlas, Editor Edward B. Espenshade, Jr., 18th Ed., Rand McNally, Chicago, Illinois, USA (1986) The Frisian Islands are generally the line of demarcation separating the North Sea from the Wadden Sea, which is a shallow sea of approximately 5000 square kilometers in size, riddled with small islands and tidal flats. The entire Wadden Sea area was formed by intervening riverine depositional periods between Ice Age glacier movements. Ecology Western end of Mand√∏ Island viewed from top of perimeter dike The principal ecosystems on this island are: tidal marsh; mudflat; littoral zone; and upland grassland. In fact, there is about as much land area in mudflat as the considerable arable land of the island. Mand√∏ Island is known for its extensive birdlife. Breeding birds consist of terns, sandpipers, many waders and ducks including eiders. Mudflats and marshes afford birds a safe and undisturbed location for feeding, resting and breeding. There are also a variety of insects, marine organisms and small mammals that find habitat on this island. Many grasses and wildflowers populate the upland portion of the island, in addition to marsh grasses in the intertidal zone. Besides the indigenous wildlife there are sheep which are grazed on the island and along part of the causeway. History The first written record of Mand√∏ dates from 1231.Store Danske Encyklop√¶di, CD-rom edition, entry: Mand√∏, Copenhagen: Gyldendal, 2004 The meaning of the original name Mann√¶√∏ or Mann√∏ is disputed. According to one interpretation the name means the Isle of Men. It has also been interpreted as relating to a burial site for victims of shipwrecks. A number of islands in Sweden have similar names with this meaning.Politikens Nudansk Ordbog, 15th edition (1992), Copenhagen: Politikens Forlag. A third interpretation explains it as derived from the name Manni.Salmonsens Konversationsleksikon (1924), second edition, volume XVI, entry: Man√∏ A local record, Avia Ripensis (), mentions the existence of a local church in 1340. The current building dates from 1727. The island belonged to the royal demesne until 1741 when the islanders purchased it at auction. Mand√∏ remains sparsely populated compared to the neighbouring islands, Fan√∏ and R√∏m√∏. The census of 1890 records the island's population as 262, a number which has now dwindled to c. 70. The island has been hit by storm floods on several occasions. A dyke known as Bydiget ('village dyke') was constructed in 1887 east of the main settlement. A second one, Havnediget ('harbour dyke'), was constructed in 1937 protecting the northern part of the island, Gammel Mand√∏ ('Old Mand√∏'). Both dykes were breached in a flood in 1981. Life on the island was first supported by a combination of agriculture and fishing. Fishing was the responsibility of the island's men and agriculture was managed by the women. The island was later associated with seafaring. In the 20th century, agriculture became the dominant activity. At its peak, the number of farms was 25, a number dwindling to a single one by 1997. Notable native Eugenius Warming (1841-1924), recognized as a major founding figure of the scientific discipline of Ecology, was born and lived until about the age of three on the island. Villum Benedikt Kann Rasmussen (1909‚Äì1993), construction engineer and businessman, founder of the roof windows company VELUX, was born and lived in Mand√∏ until 1927 when he moved to Sor√∏, in Jutland to continue his education. Later in live Rasmussen established various foundations to support social and cultural initiatives, as granting scholarships to inhabitants of Mand√∏.

Tilaka may be worn daily or for rites of passage or special religious occasions only, depending on regional customs. The term also refers to the Hindu ritual of marking someone's forehead with a fragrant paste, such as of sandalwood or vermilion, as a welcome and expression of honour when they arrive.Axel Michaels (2015), Homo Ritualis: Hindu Ritual and Its Significance for Ritual Theory, Oxford University Press, , page 100-112, 327 Description The tilaka is a mark created by the application of powder or paste on the forehead. Tilakas are vertical markings worn by Vaishnavites. The Vaishnava tilaka consists of a long vertical marking starting from just below the hairline to almost the end of one's nose tip, and they are also known as Urdhva Pundra. It is intercepted in the middle by an elongated U. There may be two marks on the temples as well. This tilaka is traditionally made with sandalwood paste. The other major tilaka variant is often worn by the followers of Shiva, known by the names of Rudra-tilaka and Tripundra. It consists of three horizontal bands across the forehead with a single vertical band or circle in the middle. This is traditionally done with sacred ash from fire sacrifices. This variant is the more ancient of the two and shares many common aspects with similar markings worn across the world. Shaktas, worshippers of the various forms of the Goddess (Devi), wear a large red dot of kumkum (vermillion or red turmeric) on the forehead. Significance Chapter 2 of the Kalagni Rudra Upanishad, a Shaiva traditional text, explains the three lines of a Tilaka as a reminder of various triads: three sacred fires, three syllables in Om, three gunas, three worlds, three types of atman (self), three powers in oneself, first three Vedas, three times of extraction of the Vedic drink Soma. *The first line is equated to Garhapatya (the sacred fire in a household kitchen), the A syllable of Om, the Rajas guna, the earth, the external self, KriyƒÅ - the power of action, the Rigveda, the morning extraction of Soma, and Maheshvara. *The second streak of ash is a reminder of Dakshinagni (the holy fire lighted in the South for ancestors), the sound U of Om, Sattva guna, the atmosphere, the inner self, Iccha - the power of will, the Yajurveda, midday Soma extraction, and Sadashiva. *The third streak is the Ahavaniya (the fire used for Homa), the M syllable in Om, the Tamas guna, Svarga - heaven, the Paramatman - the highest self (the ultimate reality of Brahman), Jnana - the power of knowledge, the Samaveda, Soma extraction at dusk, and Shiva. These lines, represent Shiva‚Äôs threefold power of will (icchƒÅ≈õakti), knowledge (j√±ƒÅna≈õakti), and action (kriyƒÅ≈õakti). The Tripu·πá·∏çra described in this and other Shaiva texts also symbolises Shiva‚Äôs trident (tri≈õ≈´la) and the divine triad of BrahmƒÅ, Vishnu, and Shiva.Antonio Rigopoulos (2013), Brill's Encyclopedia of Hinduism, Volume 5, Brill Academic, , pages 182-183 The Vasudeva Upanishad, a Vaishnava tradition text, similarly explains the significance of three vertical lines in Urdhva Pundra Tilaka to be a reminder of Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva; the Vedic scriptures ‚Äì Rigveda, Yajurveda and Samaveda; three worlds Bhu, Bhuva, Svar; the three syllables of Om ‚Äì A, U, M; three states of consciousness ‚Äì awake, dream sleep, deep sleep; three realities ‚Äì Maya, Brahman and Atman; the three bodies ‚Äì Sthula, Sukshma, and Karana.Sunder Hattangadi (2000), Vasudeva Upanishad, Sama Veda, SanskritDocuments ArchivesD Dennis Hudson (2008), The Body of God, Oxford University Press, , pages 90-95 Traditions Examples of Tilaks or sect- marking in British India, summarised by 19th-century scholar Russell Different Hindu traditions use different materials and shapes to make the tilaka.Makhan Jha, Anthropology of ancient Hindu kingdoms: a study in civilizational perspective, Page 126 *Saivites typically mark their Tilak using vibhuti (ash) in three horizontal lines across the forehead. Along with the three horizontal lines, a bindu of sandalwood paste or a dot of red kumkum in the centre completes the Tilaka (tripundra). *Vaishnavas apply a Tilak with vermillion, clay, sandalwood paste (Chandan), or latter two mixed. They apply the material in two vertical lines, which may be connected at the bottom, forming a simple U shape, often with an additional vertical red marking in the shape of a tulsi leaf inside the U shape. Their tilaka is called the Urdhva Pundra. See also Srivaishnava Urdhva Pundra, the Srivaishnava tilaka. *Ganapatya use red sandal paste (rakta candana).p. 202, note 40. Grimes, John A. Ganapati: Song of the Self. (State University of New York Press: Albany, 1995) *Shaktas use kumkuma, or powdered red turmeric. They draw one vertical line or dot (not to be confused with Bindi used by Indian women from different religions). *Honourary tilakas (Raja tilaka and Vira tilaka are usually applied as a single vertical red line. Raja tilaka will be used while enthroning kings or inviting prominent personalities. Vira tilaka is used to anoint victors or leaders after a war or a game. *Swaminarayana tilaka is U-shaped in the middle of forehead along with the red dot in the middle of U (known as chandlo). Cultural tradition Applying Tilaka on the forehead of guests to welcome and honour is a cultural tradition in India and Nepal. *Jains use Tilaka to mark the forehead of Jaina images with sandalwood paste, during Puja ceremonies.Robert Williams (1998), Jaina Yoga: A Survey of the Mediaeval ≈örƒÅvakƒÅcƒÅras, Motilal Banarsidass, , pages 221-222 *Christians in India use Tilaka, both to mark special occasions and during their worship rites.Robert Eric Frykenberg (2008), Review: Christian Inculturation in India by Paul M. Collins, Journal: Church History (Cambridge University Press), Vol. 77, No. 4, pages 1118-1120 *Hindus use the Tilaka ceremony, as a mark of honour and welcome to guests, something special or someone special. It may also be used, for same reason, to mark idols at the start of a Puja (worship), to mark a rock or tree before it is cut or removed from its original place for artisan work, or a new piece of property.E. Washburn Hopkins (1910), Mythological Aspects of Trees and Mountains in the Great Epic, Journal of the American Oriental Society, Vol. 30, No. 4, pages 347-374  Types  The choice of style is not mandated in Hindu texts, and it is left to the individual and the regional culture, leading to many versions.

A bindi can signify marriage, or be simply for decorative purposes. *A bindi is worn only between the eyes, whereas a tilaka can also cover the face or other parts of the body. Tilaka can be applied to twelve parts of the body: head, forehead, neck, both upper-arms, both forearms, chest, both sides of the torso, stomach and shoulder. Terminology similar pictography from Indus Valley Civilization It is also called tikli or sheether harr in Bengali, tika, or tilakam or tilak in Hindi; ; )V. S. Apte. A Practical Sanskrit Dictionary. p. 475. In Nepal, Bihar, Uttar Pradesh, and other regions, the tilakam is called a tikƒÅ/teeka (‡§ü‡§ø‡§ï‡§æ ), and is a mixture of sindoor, a red powder, yoghurt, and grains of rice. The most common tikkas are red powder applied with the thumb, or sandalwood (chandan) paste, in a single upward stroke. Gallery File:Green Tara as Prajnaparamita.

One of Singapore's first international schools, SAS was founded in 1956 and started with a hundred students in a colonial house. It has since developed into a school of over 4,000 students on a 36-acre campus. SAS is accredited by the US-based Western Association of Schools and Colleges (WASC). The SAS student body is made up of over 60 nationalities, with over half of the students being United States citizens. Singaporean student numbers are limited as Singapore government regulations prevent most local students from attending international schools within the country. The majority of the teachers come from the US, and staff members from twenty other countries also work at SAS. Most are hired overseas, and 80% hold master's degrees. The maximum number of students per class in preschool and pre-kindergarten is 16, while for kindergarten through grade 12 it is 22. SAS offers classes in the standard academic subjects as well as foreign languages, music, art, physical education, dance, sports, and technology. The high school offers over 20 AP courses, including the AP Capstone program. The campus has both air- conditioned and open-air spaces. Facilities include gyms, cafeterias, libraries, and theaters, as well as courtyards, playgrounds, playing fields, swimming pools, tennis courts, a rainforest, and an eco-garden.  History  Singapore American School was established by the American Association of Malaya in January 1956. It was originally intended as a school for the children of American executives, missionaries, and diplomats who did not want to follow the British practice of sending school-aged children home to boarding schools. In the beginning, around a hundred elementary and junior- high students attended classes in a colonial house on Rochalie Drive, on the edge of downtown Singapore. High school classes were soon added, and the school grew quickly, attracting students from a wide variety of backgrounds. Over the next half-century, the school moved several times: * In 1962 the school moved to a purpose-built K-12 facility on King‚Äôs Road, as it had outgrown the Rochalie Drive campus. * By 1971 the school‚Äôs population had outgrown the King's Road campus, and SAS‚Äôs younger students were moved to two temporary sites, Alexandra Junior School and Gillman Barracks. * In 1973 a new K-8 campus opened on Ulu Pandan Road, and the KIng's Road campus was turned into an expanded high school. * To accommodate a long wait-list, the satellite Baytree elementary campus in Clementi was established in 1990‚Äì91. * In 1996 the Woodlands Campus was opened, and all SAS students were once again together on one campus.  Woodlands campus history  By the late 1980s, SAS again faced space constraints, as enrollment continued to outstrip capacity at both the King's Road and Ulu Pandan campuses. In addition, the Ulu Pandan lease would soon expire, and the Singapore government wanted the school to accommodate more students, as part of its push to attract foreign talent to help develop new industries. While SAS opened the temporary Baytree campus as a short-term solution, the government offered three sites for a brand-new campus, and the school selected a large plot in the developing Woodlands neighborhood. The school received a 90-year lease, with the stipulation that the new campus be able to accommodate 3,700 students. The site was developed at the cost of $150 million, and the Woodlands campus opened in the fall of 1996. To the surprise of many in the American community, enrollment quickly rose to capacity, and the western end of the campus had to be redeveloped into a new high school and early learning center, which opened in 2004.  School governance and finance  SAS is a non-profit, member-based independent school. It is incorporated in the Republic of Singapore and recognized under the Singapore Charities Act. Parents, guardians, teachers and administrators are members of the school unless they opt out; currently there are over 4,900 members. All members are invited to the annual general meeting (AGM) in October, at which the superintendent reviews the school's progress and finances. Members participate in school governance by electing the board of governors. These twelve parents of enrolled students serve in a volunteer capacity for terms of three years. The board is responsible for hiring the superintendent and providing strategic oversight for the school, while the superintendent and administrative team are responsible for the school's day- to-day operations. The school's finances are managed by the chief operating officer under the guidance of the superintendent and board. An independent financial audit is conducted annually and presented at the AGM. The school maintains financial reserves and an endowment to ensure long-term financial stability. An investment advisory committee supports the board in managing these funds. Two philanthropic organizations support educational programs, operations, and capital initiatives at SAS. These are the SAS Foundation Limited (Singapore), and the Singapore American School Foundation (United States). The SAS Annual Fund solicits donations to these foundations from current and former parents and employees, as well as from SAS alumni and friends of the school. Foundations funds make possible special opportunities for students, as well as providing for the long-term financial health of the school.  School organization and divisions  SAS is organized into three divisions: The elementary school (including the early learning center) for preschool through grade 5; the middle school for grades 6‚Äì8; and the high school for grades 9‚Äì12. The primary school, which included grades preschool-2, and the intermediate school, which included grades 3‚Äì5, were combined into the elementary school in 2014 to minimize transitions for students, support research and development work, and promote better co-ordination across divisions. A principal and deputy principals guide each division.  Elementary School: Early Learning Center  The SAS ELC (Early Learning Center) serves three- and four-year-old students in a self-contained set of learning hubs, activity spaces, and playgrounds adjacent to the high school. Students in preschool and pre-K have a shorter school day than those in the rest of the school. The ELC program is inspired by the Reggio Emilia schools in Italy. Two classes of 16 students each are combined to form a hub, and each hub is guided by two teachers and two teaching aides. Parent volunteers often help with classroom activities and projects. Besides spending time in their individual classrooms, students have two recesses every day, which take place on the two ELC playgrounds and in the large central hall. They also have a separate Chinese class and a perceptual motor class in the Move and Groove Room. Once a week students have library time in the ELC's own library corner. Students also have \\"buddy time\\" with older students, counseling lessons to develop social skills, and special celebrations. They eat in the high school cafeteria at a designated ELC-only lunchtime.  Elementary School: grades K-5  Students in the elementary school are organized into classes with a maximum of 22 students. Teachers are supported by instructional aides. Students receive instruction in reading, writing, math, social studies, and science in their classrooms. The elementary school‚Äôs literacy program is based on the Columbia Teachers‚Äô College program, and students use the enVision math common core program. Outside their home classrooms, students attend their choice of daily Spanish or Chinese language classes. A Chinese-immersion program started in Kindergarten in August 2017. Art, music, and PE classes occur in a three-day rotational schedule, with library, science laboratory, technology, and counseling lessons at longer intervals. A 1:1 iPad program ensures that each K-5 student uses technology to support learning, and students have service learning opportunities based on grade-level themes. Special events include United Nations Day, PTA Book Fair, Halloween parties, winter holiday parties, Chinese New Year celebrations, and an end-of-year Play Day. Students in grades 3‚Äì5 may participate in the science fair. In each grade students go on several field trips. Destinations include the Singapore Zoo, Little India, the Asian Civilizations Museum, Sungei Buloh Wetlands Reserve, and various plays and theatre offerings. Parents are welcome to help in classrooms, as field trip chaperones, and with parties and special events throughout the year. The elementary school occupies the eastern end of the SAS campus, and includes its own language, art, music, and science classrooms, as well as a library, an auditorium/theater, two pools, two gyms (one with a climbing wall), two cafeterias, and several playgrounds.  Middle School: grades 6‚Äì8  The SAS middle school offers a foundation of academic classes complemented by elective courses and after-school activities. ‚ÄúHomebase‚Äù meets every morning, giving each group of a dozen students a daily connection with one teacher. With over 900 students, the middle school is organized into teams, called A Side, B Side, and C Side, each supported by a set of teachers. These smaller groups within the large middle school are intended to help meet students‚Äô social, emotional, and academic needs. Besides the required courses (reading and language arts, math, science, social studies, and PE/health) students may take Chinese, French, or Spanish, strings, band, or choir, or a selection of electives including drama, art, technology, and cooking. Student learning is supported in a number of ways in the middle school. A 1:1 laptop program was implemented in 2013‚Äì14. \\"Classroom Without Walls\\" takes each grade level to a regional destination for several days in the first month of school, and students develop relationships with peers and staff. Learning support teachers, school counselors and the school psychologist work with small groups and individuals needing specialized support. The school uses a standards-based grading protocol. The middle school occupies the central area of the SAS campus. Core classes are taught in classrooms grouped around large-group activity areas. Art, band, orchestra, choir, technology, cooking, health and dance occupy specially designed rooms. The middle school has its own playing field and library/media centre. Students share a 25-meter pool, gymnasiums, and fields with the high school, and eat in the open-air elementary-middle school cafeteria.  High School: grades 9‚Äì12  The SAS high school offers a foundation of academic classes complemented by elective courses and after- school activities. Like many US college preparatory schools, course requirements ensure a comprehensive liberal arts education. The ‚Äúinternational perspective‚Äù central to the school's mission statement is reflected in academic offerings, service opportunities, and extracurricular activities. Students with different learning styles, interests, and skills are accommodated. In recent years, the high school has launched several programs to ensure student wellbeing and foster community spirit. These include the advisory program, the house system, and the reorganization of the counseling department into two offices: one for social, emotional, and academic counseling and one for college counseling. The high school offers 180 course options, and class size averages 17.1 students. Required credits include English, math, science, social studies, visual and performing arts, physical education, and health education. American citizens must earn one credit in American Studies or US History. All students must take two years of a foreign language (Chinese, French, Japanese or Spanish) or demonstrate proficiency in another language. Students also participate in a weeklong \\"Interim Semester\\" every year. This is a required off-campus experience that provides high school students with experiences beyond the traditional classroom. Beginning with the class of 2018, all students must complete a Catalyst Project. Elective options include classes in technology, engineering and robotics, journalism and media, and independent studies. Students may also take specialist courses through the Global Online Academy; may enroll in SAS's Summer Semester program; may enroll in the yearlong, nontraditional Quest program; and may study abroad in China, France, Italy, or Spain through School Year Abroad. SAS currently offers 22 AP courses, as well as the AP Capstone Diploma program. In May 2018, SAS students took 1,846 AP exams, with 96% receiving a score of 3 or higher, and 79% receiving a score of 4 or 5. The high school also offers 20 Advanced Topic (AT) courses. Developed by SAS teachers and vetted by university partners, these courses meet college-level standards of rigor and depth and emphasize student agency, project-based learning, and skills relevant to students' futures. Faculty Approximately 395 faculty members work full-time at SAS. These teachers come from 21 different countries, with 59% being American and 13% Canadian. Other countries of origin include Australia, China, the United Kingdom, Singapore, New Zealand, and Spain. Eighty percent of SAS teachers have a master's degree in addition to a bachelor's degree, and 18 teachers hold a PhD. Teachers tend to be experienced, with over 70% having at least six years of teaching experience before arriving at SAS. SAS teachers' average stay at the school is 8.4 years. Currently, 60% of SAS teachers have over five years' tenure at the school, including 34% who have stayed a decade or more. The student-teacher ratio is 10.2:1, and class sizes are limited to 16 in the ELC and, with few exceptions, 22 for grades K‚Äì12. Academics=Curriculum All curriculum at SAS is standards-based and aligned to current recommendations of US professional associations. Faculty are organized into professional learning communities (PLCs) that set essential learning targets and develop common assessments. PLCs also refine academic offerings to ensure that all students are appropriately challenged and supported in their learning. SAS has identified seven critical skills it believes students need to be prepared for academic, professional, and interpersonal success in the twenty-first century. These seven \\"desired student learning outcomes,\\" or DSLOs, include content knowledge, cultural competence, character, collaboration, communication, critical thinking, and creativity. Five \\"core values\\" are instilled in SAS students through programs, practices, and adult modeling. They include respect, responsibility, honesty, fairness, and compassion.  Testing  SAS student test scores consistently show a high level of academic achievement. Students in grades 3 through 9 take the Measures of Academic Progress (MAP) assessments in math, reading, and language use twice yearly. SAS students' average MAP scores are higher than average scores of students in the US and comparable regional international schools. SAS began offering Advanced Placement courses in 1968, and over the years it has developed an extensive AP program. Today, over 90% of high school students take at least one AP exam during their time at SAS. Offering around 25 AP courses each year, SAS has one of the largest AP programs of any school outside the US in the spring of 2017, SAS students took 1,761 AP exams, with 93% receiving a score of 3 or higher, and 76% receiving a score of 4 or 5. 337 SAS students received an AP Scholar award from the College Board. This award recognizes students who score 3 or higher on at least 3 AP exams.  College admissions  Students graduating from SAS overwhelmingly go on to college or university, and the application process is supported by a comprehensive college counseling program. Of the class of 2017, 89% went directly on to college or university, with 8% completing Singapore's National Service requirement (applicable to male Singaporean citizens or permanent residents) and 3% taking a gap year. Of those going directly on to college, 85% chose a US institution, 6% went to Canada, and the remainder attended British, Australian, and Asian universities.  Co-curricular and extracurricular activities =Athletics SAS offers physical education classes across all divisions, starting with perceptual motor classes in the early grades. Younger students may participate in after-school sports through the Elementary Activities and Athletics (EAA) program, which offers weekday, pay-as-you-go classes such as soccer, baseball, and karate. Middle school students have PE (including health lessons) every second day. The all-inclusive MS after-school program includes many sports opportunities. Representative teams in soccer, cross-country, rugby, badminton, basketball, volleyball, track and field, tennis and swimming require try-outs and compete against other teams in the Athletic Conference of Singapore International Schools (ACSIS), of which SAS is a founding member. Clubs and intramural teams offer climbing, ultimate frisbee, soccer, lacrosse, table-tennis, dodgeball, basketball, volleyball, and cricket. High school athletes try out for boys‚Äô and girls‚Äô freshman/reserve, junior varsity, and varsity teams, depending on age and ability. Sports include cross-country, soccer, volleyball, basketball, rugby, touch rugby, swimming, tennis, badminton, golf, softball, and track and field. Teams compete against ACSIS teams, teams from local schools, community teams, and sometimes teams from other international schools in the region. Besides playing locally, varsity teams participate in the Interscholastic Association of Southeast Asia (IASAS). This organization, composed of six international schools with similar histories, was founded in 1982 to provide an organized, co-ordinated athletic conference for international competitions. Besides SAS, IASAS includes the International School of Kuala Lumpur, the International School of Bangkok, the Intercultural School of Jakarta, the International School of Manila, and Taipei American School. Each sport's season culminates with a competitive final tournament at one of the IASAS schools, hosted on a rotating schedule. Students stay with host school families, and develop both rivalries and friendships with the competition. SAS students have many other sporting options. The SAS Community Sports and Activities (CSA) program offers sports such as baseball, swimming, volleyball, and soccer after school and on weekends. American football enthusiasts can play in the Singapore American Football League (SAFL), organized by the Singapore American Community Action Council (SACAC). Many SAS students participate in local teams and leagues, or take lessons from private coaches or through Singapore social clubs such as the American Club. Extra-curricular clubs and activities Students in the elementary school have a range of after-school options available to them through the EAA program. This provides pay-as-you-go participation in a number of extra classes in areas such as music, arts and crafts, and cooking. Middle school students participate in teacher-led after-school activities at no extra cost. These include activities such as Caring for Cambodia, National History Day Club, Chess Club, Spanish Language Club, and Junior Model United Nations. Middle school students may also audition for the annual fall dance show and the annual spring play or musical. SAS National History Day Club students won prizes in the Junior Group Project division at the National History Day competitions in 2015 and 2016. High school students run and participate in more than ninety clubs, organizations, and activities. These span a wide variety of interests and talents, and include athletic clubs, academic honor societies, academic interest clubs, environmental clubs, fine arts activities, language and cultural clubs, media and publications, music, dance, and theatre performances, service clubs, social clubs, and student government. SAS high school students participate in Model United Nations and compete in a variety of math competitions as well as Knowledge Bowl and Academic Quiz Club. Students compete in debate and forensics in the annual IASAS Cultural Conventions, which also include dance, drama, art and music. Student editors of The Eye school newspaper won the Straits Times National Youth Media Competition in 2014. In June 2017, six SAS high school students were the first in Singapore to send a science experiment to the International Space Station. Community service Community service has been part of the SAS experience since students began volunteering at a local hospital in the 1960s. Currently, the emphasis at all levels is for students to have hands-on service experiences. Elementary students participate in local charities‚Äô efforts by visiting local schools and care homes and conducting fund-raisers like walkathons and readathons. Middle school students support causes they learn about in social studies and science classes, and also design independent service projects. Over half the high school extracurricular organizations are service clubs, such as Migrant Workers Outreach Program, Leprosy Home, Blue Planet Initiative, Medical Explorers Club, Global Issues Network, and Youth for Girls. Elected high school students make up the Executive Service Council, an umbrella organization providing logistical and funding support for service clubs. Student fundraisers, parent organizations, and philanthropic donors also provide funding for service club efforts.  Environmental initiatives  SAS incorporates environmental initiatives in its facilities planning and classroom activities. Sustainability measures include a large photovoltaic array, the conversion of a formerly air-conditioned cafeteria to an open-air space, enhancements to the school's rain forest and eco-garden, and the installation of low-flow faucets, more efficient chillers, and \\"green walls.\\" The school's one-megawatt solar photovoltaic system includes nearly 3,500 panels on the school's rooftops, and earned the school a 2013 Solar Pioneer Award from Singapore's Economic Development Board. Singapore's Building and Construction Association awarded SAS a Green Mark \\"Gold\\" Award for sustainability in 2013. Student participation in the school's sustainability includes science projects studying how to cut down on paper-towel usage, student clubs running recycling efforts, and students helping with island-wide efforts such as the annual Coastal Cleanup Day.  Food services  SAS students eat in three cafeterias: the elementary school cafeteria for grades K-2; the elementary-middle school cafeteria for grades 3‚Äì8; and the high school cafeteria, where the early learning centre children also eat in a designated area. Food provider Hoe Brothers Catering has been working with the school since the 1960s, and alumni remember signature dishes with fondness. High school students also have the choice of purchasing food from on-campus outlets such as Subway and Baja Fresh. The SAS cafeterias provide a variety of meals, including Asian, Western, and vegetarian options. Younger students buy set meals, while older students can choose from set meals or a la carte items. SAS works with a school nutritionist, and in recent years has moved toward alignment with USDA standards for school meals and snacks. Healthy changes include increasing amounts of fruits, vegetables, and whole grains in meals, using healthier oils and less sugar and salt, and eliminating sodas and sugary drinks from campus. In 2014, these changes were featured in an episode of MediaCorp Channel 5's TV show The Food Detectives.  Parent support organizations = SAS Parent Teacher Association (PTA)  The PTA was founded in the same year as the school, and continues to encourage community participation in school events and support student learning opportunities. It is a separate legal entity with an elected board, and membership is automatic for school families and faculty members. The PTA organizes classroom holiday parties, field trip chaperones, and special community events such as the Open House Ice Cream Social, the International Fair, and informative parent coffees. Volunteers also run the on-campus uniform store. Funds raised by the PTA support visiting authors and artists, library acquisitions, and scholarships.  SAS Eagles Booster Club  The SAS Eagles Booster Club is a parent organization that supports SAS high school students. It started in 1985 to support student athletic teams, and quickly expanded its mission to include boosting school spirit and promoting teamwork and sportsmanship. Volunteers run the Booster Booth, which sells high school uniforms, spirit items, and school supplies. They also organize barbecues, spirit events, scholar luncheons, and the annual Trivia Night. Funds raised by the Boosters are used to support student clubs, productions, and teams, recognize academic achievements, and provide scholarships. School facilities SAS occupies a 36-acre parcel of land near Singapore's northern coast. Opened in 1996 and expanded in 2004, the Woodlands campus is divided into three divisions: the elementary school for preschool through grade 5; the middle school for grades 6‚Äì8; and the high school for grades 9‚Äì12. School facilities include air- conditioned classrooms and purpose-designed spaces for science, language, music, drama, dance, art and cooking classes.

Knoll and her husband, Hans Knoll, built Knoll Associates into a leader in the fields of furniture and interior design. She worked to professionalize the field of interior design, fighting against gendered stereotypes of the decorator. She is known for her open office designs, populated with modernist furniture and organized rationally for the needs of office workers. Her modernist aesthetic was known for clean lines and clear geometries that were humanized with textures, organic shapes, and color. Early life and education Florence Marguerite Schust was born in Saginaw, Michigan, to Frederick Emanuel (1881‚Äì1923) and Mina Matilda (Haist) Schust (1884‚Äì1931), and was known in familiar circles as \\"Shu\\". Frederick Schust was born about 1882 in either Switzerland or Germany, was a native German speaker, and the 1920 United States Federal Census describes him as the superintendent of a commercial bakery. Mina was born about 1887 in Michigan, and her parents had been born in Canada. Knoll was orphaned at a young age, her father died when she was 5, her mother died when she was 12. She was placed under the care of Emile Tessin, who had been designated by Mina Schust as Knoll's legal guardian in the event of her death. Tessin made arrangements for Knoll to attend boarding school. After visiting, Knoll recalls feeling the Cranbrook educational community was the right place for her. Knoll attended Kingswood School for Girls (1932-1934), part of the Cranbrook Educational Community in Bloomfield Hills, Michigan. There she was mentored by Rachel de Wolfe Raseman, the art director at Kingswood. Together they designed a home which integrated interior and exterior, sparking her interest in architecture and bringing her to the attention of Eliel Saarinen, the Cranbrook Academy of Art President. Eliel and Loja Saarinen practically adopted Knoll; she spent summers with the family in Finland and befriended their son, Eero Saarinen who even gave her impromptu architectural history lessons. She attended the architecture department at Cranbrook Academy of Art for one year in 1934‚Äì35, In 1935, she studied town planning at the School of Architecture at Columbia University. She returned to Michigan in 1936 to undergo surgery and enrolled in the architecture department at Cranbrook again. From 1936-37, she explored furniture-making with Eero Saarinen and Charles Eames. In the summer of 1938 she met Alvar Aalto, who praised Architectural Association in London as a \\"terrific school,\\" Knoll went on to attended from 1938-1939. There she enjoyed the focus on studio work and was influenced by Le Corbusier's International style. She left as World War II was spreading. From 1940-1941, Knoll furthered her architectural educations under leading figures of the Bauhaus movement. In 1940, she moved to Cambridge, Massachusetts, and worked briefly as an unpaid apprentice for Walter Gropius and Marcel Breuer. Though her studies had been repeatedly interrupted by ill health and international events, Knoll was determined to finish her degree. She enrolled at the Chicago Armour Institute (now the Illinois Institute of Technology) in fall 1940. She went to specifically study under Mies van der Rohe and received a bachelor's degree in architecture in 1941. Knoll's design approach was profoundly influenced by Mies, resulting in clarified designs with rigorous geometries. Career After graduating Knoll moved to New York in 1941, taking jobs with several New York architects, including Harrison & Abramovitz. \\"Being a woman, I was given interiors,\\" Knoll stated about her time at Harrison & Abramovitz. While there, she worked with Hans Knoll to design an office for Harry Stimson. Afterwards she continued the partnership, moonlighting as a designer for the Hans G. Knoll Furniture Company, which included designing their showroom. In 1943, she joined the Hans Knoll's company and founded their interior design service, the Knoll Planning Unit. She and Hans Knoll were married in 1946, when she became a full business partner and the company became known Knoll Associates, Inc.  Knoll Associates  The pairing led to success as Florence Knoll helped Hans Knoll turn what was a small furniture company into an international powerhouse. Florence Knoll was the design force and Hans Knoll was entrepreneurial and charismatic. A new furniture factory was established in East Greenville, Pennsylvania, and dealers of Knoll's furniture were carefully added over the next several years. Knoll Showrooms and retailers expanded internationally, by 1960 the company was doing $15 million dollars of business annually. The Knoll showrooms embodied their humanized modern designs, showing customers how to use their new furniture. Their first showroom was opened in 1948 in New York City followed by those in Dallas, Chicago, San Francisco, Paris, Los Angeles, Southfield, Michigan and other cities. The company expanded internationally forming Knoll International in 1951, as well as moved into textiles, forming Knoll Textiles. Knoll felt architects should contribute their design ability to furniture as well, and she brought her international connections, designer friends, and former teachers to Knoll. She managed to get architects including Eero Saarinen, Marcel Breuer, Pierre Jeanneret and Hans Bellman to design furniture for Knoll. Famously, Knoll asked Saarinen to design a chair that was \\"like a great big basket of pillows that I can curl up in,\\" resulting in his classic Womb chair. Knoll and Saarinen had to work with a fiberglass boat builder in order to manufacture the chair. Knoll persuaded her former teacher, Mies van der Rohe, to give Knoll the rights to the Barcelona Chair which he had designed with Lilly Reich in 1929. Knoll also tapped artists to create furniture, such as Isamu Noguchi, whose cyclone table (1950) became a Knoll replica. Knoll had the sculptor, Harry Bertoia spend two years in his studio to see if he could translate his metal work into furniture resulting in his well known wire chairs. She managed to attract Knoll's considerable stable of designer talent by paying commissions and royalties and ensuring credit for designs. File:Eero Saarinen, Womb Chair, Model No. 70, Designed 1947-1948.jpgEero Saarinen's Womb Chair was designed in 1947-1948 at the request of Florence Knoll. File:Diamond Chair - Harry Bertoia, MNAM.jpgKnoll had Bertoia translate his sculptural work into furniture, resulting in his wire chairs. File:Mies-Barcelona-Chair-and-Ottoman.jpgMies van der Rohe formally granted Knoll the production rights to the Barcelona Chair and Stool in 1953. File:Saarinen Tulpanstolen.jpgIn 1956, Knoll introduced Eero Saarinen's tulip chairs and pedestal table. When Hans Knoll died in a car accident in 1955, Florence Knoll took over as president of all three Knoll companies (Knoll Associates, Knoll Textiles, and Knoll International). She sold the companies to Art Metal Construction Company in 1959, though continued on as president of all three companies until 1960. In 1960, she moved to Florida with her second husband, Harry Hood Bassett. However, she stayed in charge of design for all of Knoll until 1965. In the ten years since she had taken primary responsibility for Knoll, she had doubled the size of the company to become one of the most influential design businesses in the world.  Knoll Planning Unit  Florence Knoll created the interior design service of Knoll Associates (The Knoll Planning Unit) in 1943 and directed its activities until 1965, the unit closed down 1971. The Planning Unit at first designed Knoll Showrooms, arranging furniture and accessories to showcase the firm's designs and demonstrate how to use the furniture, Knoll Showrooms became an essential part in convincing clients to adopt Knoll's modernist aesthetic. During the post-war period, the United States experienced an office building boom, and the Knoll Planning Unit was well positioned to take advantage as it began offering innovative full-service design solutions for office interiors including everything from space planning to furniture selection. Knoll also advanced the science of office design, not just decorating the space, but analyzing the client's work requirements and designing functional spaces that would meet these needs. Knoll conducted interviews to identify clients' work needs through interviews. The Unit completed over 70 office interiors, including the offices of major American companies such as IBM, GM, Look magazine, Seagram, Heinz, Connecticut General Life Insurance Company, and CBS. The Unit's breakthrough came from designing for the CBS president, Frank Stanton, who had been impressed by the Knoll Showrooms. Stanton promoted Knoll design to his contacts, and Knoll shrewdly promoted their work for CBS through architecture and design magazines. The Planning Unit typically ran on a very small team, typically only 8 designers and 2 drafters on staff, and even as the volume of projects dramatically increased, the staff only grew to around 20 employees. Knoll provided extensive education and mentoring to the designers that worked under her, and many of the Knoll Planning Unit designers went on to found interior divisions at architectural firms such as SOM. The preparation and training of interior designers earned the Planning Unit the moniker \\"Shu U\\" after Knoll's nickname.  The Knoll look  Knoll and her Knoll Planning Unit has been credited with revolutionizing office design and environments, replacing antique styles and haphazard arrangements with the signature \\"Knoll Look,\\" marked by rationalized space plans, modern furniture, sleek geometries, and an integration of structure, color, and texture. In the 1940s office decoration had been dominated by antique and period styles. Offices typically had traditional, heavy, carved, mahogany desks placed diagonally in the corner of a room, another diagonal table behind it, chairs scattered, and a glassed-in bookcase. Knoll replaced the old executive desk with light and sleek modern designs, as well as straightening its diagonal positioning. Work spaces were made to be more open with sitting areas for informal discussion. She redesigned conference tables into a boat-shape so that people could see one another to accommodate group discussions. She often employed floating open- riser staircases and multilevel interiors, drawing on her architectural background. Knoll radically transformed interior space planning creating a \\"total design\\" or \\"Bauhaus approach\\" where interior architecture, furniture, lighting, textiles, and art were integrated. The unit created some of the most innovative design for office interiors during the post-war period, largely due to Knoll's design aesthetic of humanized modernism, in which Knoll brought color and texture to interiors inspired by modernism, making them more comfortable for everyday use. This \\"softer modernism\\" with color and organic shapes, which was also practiced by Charles and Ray Eames as well as Eero Saarinen, was more appealing to a general public. Knoll brought in architecture, ergonomics, efficiency, and space planning to her comprehensive interior designs. The NY Times critic, Paul Goldberger, said she ‚Äúprobably did more than any other single figure to create the modern, sleek, postwar American office, introducing contemporary furniture and a sense of open planning into the work environment.‚Äù In 1957, Architectural Forum said \\"the Knoll interior is as much a symbol of modem architecture as Tiffany glass was a symbol of the architecture of Art Nouveau.\\"  Selling modernism  Florence Knoll Paste-up One of Knoll's main challenges was convincing executives and the public to adopt a modernist aesthetic. Knoll Showrooms played a key room in selling the public on modernist design, but Knoll was also gifted at convincing executives to hire Knoll to transform their offices. Knoll was renowned for her how she communicated and presented the designs of the Knoll Planning Unit through what she referred to as \\"paste-ups\\". A \\"paste- up\\" was a general graphic-arts term for any draft or finished mechanical flat art, traditionally using an adhesive commonly used in fashion and set design. Knoll was the first to use the method for interior design presentation. Her paste-ups were small representational plans of the space with fabric swatches, wood chips and finishes attached to represent furniture and other details. Knoll used the paste-ups to convey the feeling and experience of the space, in the pictured example the color and texture of the materials used better represented the humanized modernism that was essential to Knoll's designs. The paste-ups were essential in overcoming resistance to change, they gave executives something they could identify with, making them feel comfortable in adopting Knoll's new aesthetics.  Furniture design  Knoll designed furniture when the existing pieces in the Knoll collection didn't meet her needs. She described her pieces as the \\"meat and potatoes,\\" the filler among the flashier pieces in the Knoll collection. Knoll stated that she was not a furniture designer, perhaps because she didn't want her furniture pieces to be viewed on their own but rather as an element of her holistic interior design.Transcript of interview with F. Knoll Bassett, n.d., pg. 9, Knoll Archives. Nonetheless, almost half of the furniture pieces in the Knoll collection were her designs including tables, desks, chairs, sofas, benches and stools. She designed furniture not only to be functional but also to designate the functions of interior space as well as relate to the architecture of the space and its overall composition. The distinctive features of Knoll's furniture designs were their sleek silhouettes and clear geometries, reflecting her architectural training and interests. Her furniture was designed with the notion of transforming architecture into furniture, which she achieved by translating the structure and language of the modern building into a human-scaled object.Profile , uvm.edu; accessed May 12, 2017.  Professionalization of interior design  Before Knoll's influence Interior decoration was mostly a non-professional pursuit, typically practiced by hobbyists. It had previously only been applied to the home, spaces like offices were not typically professionally planned or designed. Knoll saw an opportunity, when she realized that most office spaces were not professionally designed: > In those days the boss usually had a decorator. They did his office and > maybe some of the other senior executives, but the people further down the > line had offices designed by the purchasing agent, who ordered furniture out > of a catalog. So when I came along with my questionnaire, I wanted to know > what they needed. It was kind of a radical ideal, but it was also logical > and obvious. With her Knoll Planning Unit, Knoll radically shifted interior design to be a professional endeavor. Knoll fused decoration with architecture and industrial design ad applied it to commercial office space, this fusion has continued to be at the core of modern professional interior design. Knoll was aware of the shift she was creating, in an interview with the New York Times in 1964, Knoll state \\"I am not a decorator... the only place I decorate is my own house.\\" She took this stance to differentiate the titles of an interior decorator and an interior designer. Knoll was one of the first to make this differentiation, frustrated at the title of interior decorator especially in its gendered connotation and concomitant lack of status and respect. She felt expertise in furniture design and architecture exceed the common skill of an interior decorator.  Awards  In 1961 she became the first woman to receive the Gold Medal for Industrial Design from the American Institute of Architects. In 1983 she won the Athena Award of the Rhode Island School of Design. She was inducted into the Interior Design Magazine Hall of Fame in 1985. In 2003, President George W. Bush presented her with the nation's highest award for artistic excellence, the National Medal of Arts. In 2004 she was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Vermont.  Personal life  She married Hans Knoll in 1946; he died in a car crash in 1955. In 1958 she married Harry Hood Bassett, the son of Harry H. Bassett. On 25 January 2019, Florence Marguerite Knoll Bassett died at age 101 in Coral Gables, Florida.

As the daughter of Aurelian \\"Grizzly\\" Smith, she is a second-generation wrestler. Her brother Sam Houston and half-brother Jake \\"The Snake\\" Roberts are also wrestlers. Smith worked for the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) in the 1980s. She held the WWF Women's Championship from October 1988 until it was retired in 1990. She then worked on the independent circuit. Professional wrestling career=World Wrestling Federation Smith grew up in a wrestling family and enjoyed going to wrestling shows, where she claims she and her siblings were treated like celebrities. Smith later decided to become a professional wrestler and trained, along with her sister-in-law Nickla Roberts (known by her ring name Baby Doll), under Nelson Royal. During 1987, Smith competed as Rockin' Robin in Wild West Wrestling, where she feuded with Debbie Combs and Sue Green. When the WWF decided to restart their women's division in the late 1980s, both women tried out for the company, but the role ultimately went to Smith. Smith, as Rockin' Robin, debuted in the WWF in late 1987. She competed at the first Survivor Series as a member of The Fabulous Moolah's team. Throughout 1988, she feuded with Sensational Sherri for the WWF Women's Championship. On October 7, 1988, she defeated Sensational Sherri, who had held the title for fifteen months prior, for the Women's Championship in Paris. At the Royal Rumble in 1989, she defended the title against Judy Martin. Smith defended the belt against Martin for the first six months of 1989. In the meantime, at WrestleMania V, she sang \\"America the Beautiful\\" to open the show. Smith continued to defend the Women's title against Martin throughout the summer of 1989. She held the championship until 1990, when she left the company. At that time, the title was retired by the WWF due to inactivity. Smith is still in possession of the title belt. The title remained inactive until 1993. Independent circuit Unlike some former WWF wrestlers, Smith was able to continue using her ring name after leaving the company because she owned the rights to it.Brody, Howard. Swimming with Piranhas, p.190. In 1990, wrestler Hiro Matsuda, who had feuded with her father in the 1960s, picked Smith to tour for All Japan Women's Pro Wrestling. In Japan, Smith teamed with Luna Vachon. The Japanese bookers gave the girls a positive review for their work with the company. In the United States, Smith defeated Peggy Lee Leather for the Ladies Major League Wrestling's International Championship. She still occasionally defended the WWF Women's Championship, even though the title was officially declared vacant by the World Wrestling Federation. In May 1991 she defended the WWF Women's Championship against \\"Japanese Women's Champion\\" Madusa Miceli on a Great Lakes Wrestling Association event. On June 9, 1991, she defeated Candi Devine in Herb Abrams's Universal Wrestling Federation to become the first UWF Women's Champion at UWF Beach Brawl. She also competed in the Ladies Professional Wrestling Association (LPWA), forming a tag team with Wendi Richter. She competed at LPWA's only pay-per-view, LPWA Super Ladies Showdown. Personal life Smith and her brother Sam Houston are the children of Aurelian \\"Grizzly\\" Smith and were born after his first marriage dissolved. Her half-brother is Jake \\"The Snake\\" Roberts, who was born during their father's first marriage. Robin and her brothers all wrestled in the WWF at the same time in the 1980s, but their relationship was never mentioned on-screen at the request of Robin. Author and former National Wrestling Alliance president Howard Brody alleges in his book Swimming with Piranhas that Robin was a victim of sexual abuse at the hands of her father. According to Brody, Robin was removed from her father's care when her mother discovered what had been happening. After leaving the WWF in 1990, Smith was married to a man named Harvey Zitron. Zitron was sentenced to 81 months in federal prison for 10 counts of filing false tax returns, identity theft and access device fraud. After divorcing, she moved to Louisiana and opened a telemarketing company that sold industrial chemicals and precious metals. Later, she opened a real estate appraisal business. During this time, Smith had a drinking problem but eventually was able to quit altogether. In 2005, Smith's home and all of her belongings were destroyed by Hurricane Katrina.Brody, Howard. Swimming with Piranhas, p.403‚Äì405. During the aftermath of the hurricane, she stayed with family in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. She now runs a real estate appraisal business in Hammond, Louisiana.

It runs from Worcester via Bristol and Yeovil to Shoreham, West Sussex. All of the route is waymarked, using a logo with a drawing of the ship Surprise above a Prince of Wales three-point feathered crown on a silhouette of the Royal Oak tree (which is at Boscobel House). The route is shown as a series of green diamonds on the Ordnance Survey (larger scale) 1:25000 maps, and of red diamonds on its 1:50000 maps. Route description From its starting point at Worcester the route travels north to Boscobel and then south to Stratford upon Avon. It then continues south to Stow on the Wold before turning south west towards Bristol via Cirencester. South of Bristol the route is almost directly south across the Mendip Hills to Wells, continues through Somerset almost to Yeovil and then south west to Charmouth in Dorset. There is then a short section along the Dorset coast before turning north again to Yeovil, before turning east and following much of the escarpment of Cranborne Chase, the Hampshire Downs and South Downs to Shoreham-by-Sea where it has a short extension to neighbouring Brighton and Hove, being its historic port and today a main yachting centre in Sussex. The Monarch's Way is an approximation of the King's route using available public rights of way and visiting places noted in the historic records. Most of the route has been radically changed in the intervening centuries by enclosure, mining, urbanisation and the building of roads, canals and railways. Use of canals and disused railways allows a more pleasant walk than taking to the public highway and provides an insight into industrial history particularly of the Black Country. Worcester to Stratford-upon-Avon via Boscobel () A memorial near Powick Bridge commemorates the thousands of Scots who perished in the Royalist cause at the Battle of Worcester. Powick Bridge saw both the first and last engagements of the English Civil War. From here the footpath follows the banks of the River Teme and River Severn across the battlefield to enter the 'Faithful City' of Worcester . The King watched the battle unfold from the tower of the cathedral before fleeing with Colonel Charles Giffard of Chillington and others. The Monarch's Way leaves the city past the Commandery, now a museum, on the towpath of the Worcester & Birmingham Canal then crossing to the Droitwich Canal, to Droitwich. Heading north it passes Chaddesley Corbett and Hagley on its way to Stourbridge. Here it joins the towpath of the Stourbridge Canal negotiating the four locks at Stourton to join the Staffordshire & Worcestershire Canal. Continuing north along the canal to the Bratch Locks at Wombourne to pick up the trackbed of the former Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway now the South Staffordshire Railway Walk to Oaken. Leaving the railway the northerly route continues passing Pendrell Hall and Boscobel to White Ladies Priory. The King was hidden overnight in the house by Richard Pendrell. The next part of the route traces the King's unsuccessful attempt to cross the River Severn to escape into Wales. Leaving White Ladies and the nearby Pendrell home at Hubbal Grange the route turns west via Tong to Evelith Mill and Kemberton. Reaching Madeley it became apparent that the river crossings were well guarded and the King spent a night in the 'Royal Barn' before beating a hasty retreat. Retracing the route through Norton and Beckbury to Boscobel House where the King hid in an oak tree to avoid capture. A descendant of the Royal Oak stands in the grounds of the English Heritage property. An alternative plan was hatched for the King's escape and the path now heads east. Crossing the grounds of Chillington Hall and using sections of the Shropshire Union Canal and Staffordshire & Worcestershire Canal it reaches Moseley Old Hall, now a National Trust property, where the King was hidden in a 'Priest hole'. From Moseley Old Hall the King left in the night for Bentley Hall with Colonel Lane. The Monarch's Way passes Northycote Farm and Essington before entering the fringe of the urban West Midlands. The route follows the Wyrley & Essington Canal the 'Curly Wyrley' and the ancient forest at Rough Wood to reach Bentley Hall at Bentley, West Midlands. Anson Branch Canal The Monarch's Way picks up the closed Anson Branch Canal. This section of the Monarch's Way follows the canal system through the heart of the Black Country using Walsall Canal, Wednesbury Old Canal, Netherton Tunnel and Dudley Canal to Halesowen. Then Bromsgrove, Headless Cross, Alcester, Wootton Wawen, Snitterfield and Welcombe Hills Country Park. Finally following the Stratford-upon-Avon Canal until it joins the River Avon in the centre of Stratford-upon-Avon. Stratford-upon-Avon to Charmouth () The Royal Shakespeare Theatre in Stratford-upon-Avon is the start of this leg of the Monarch's Way. Following the west bank of the River Avon south and passing Holy Trinity Church, with its connections to William Shakespeare.Explorer Map 205: Stratford-upon-Avon & Evesham. Published in 2006 by the Ordnance Survey Crossing both the River Avon then the River Stour near to Stratford racecourse. The path then follows the route of the Honeybourne Line to Long Marston. Leaving east on the route of the Heart of England Way and passing through Lower Quinton and Upper Quinton to meet with the Centenary Way which it follows east round Meon Hill at the start of the Cotswolds. Leaving the Centenary Way in a south westerly direction it enters Gloucestershire and passes Hidcote Manor Garden, owned by the National Trust, before rejoining the Heart of England Way. The path crosses Campden Tunnel on the Cotswold railway line and enters the market town of Chipping Campden. Moreton-in-Marsh, Stow-on-the-Wold, Northleach, Cirencester, Tetbury, Chipping Sodbury, Wick. River Chew The Monarch's Way enters Somerset, having crossed the River Avon at Keynsham, where it diverts from the route taken by Charles II into Bristol and instead runs alongside the River Chew, where it shares the route with the Two Rivers Way, through the Chew Valley to Chewton Keynsham, Compton Dando and Woollard.Landranger Map 172: Bristol & Bath. Published in 2006 by the Ordnance Survey It then crosses the river at Pensford and turns north to Norton Malreward, skirting the prehistoric henge monument of Stanton Drew stone circles, the second largest stone circle in Britain, and travels along Dundry Down to the village of Dundry. From Dundry there is a northerly loop to Leigh Court at Abbots Leigh where Charles II stayed on the night of 12 September 1651. The path then returns to Dundry and heads turns south to Winford and passes Regil before passing between Chew Valley Lake and Blagdon Lake to Compton Martin,Landranger Map 182: Weston-super-Mare. Published in 2005 by the Ordnance Survey where it climbs up into the Mendip Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, passing East Harptree before entering the Forestry Commission plantation Stock Hill. On leaving the woods the path skirts the Priddy Mineries and Priddy Pools Site of Special Scientific Interest and continues south to Wookey Hole before entering the city of Wells, where it passes the Cathedral and Bishop's Palace. South of Wells the Monarch's Way crosses the River Sheppey and passes through Twinhills Woods and Meadows before entering North Wootton, continuing across the Somerset Levels and the A361 and A37 roads, through East Pennard, to Hornblotton. It then crosses the River Alham and travels east crossing the River Brue and the A371 before entering Castle Cary.Landranger Map 183: Yeovil & Frome. Published in 2005 by the Ordnance Survey South Cadbury, Trent, Dorset The King was sheltered by Colonel Wyndham at Trent Manor House. The next part of the journey leads down to the Dorset coast where a ship had been found to take the King to France. At Montacute the Monarch's Way passes in front of the Grade I listed Abbey Farmhouse, which incorporates the gateway of the medieval Montacute Priory. Ham Hill, Crewkerne, Drimpton, Hawkchurch, Charmouth The King stayed overnight on 22 September 1651 at the Queen's Armes before taking passage; the plan fell through and the King beat a hasty retreat inland, returning to Trent. Charmouth to Shoreham () From Charmouth the Monarch's Way follows the South West Coast Path east along the Jurassic Coast of Dorset past St Gabriel's Mouth, over Golden Cap, the highest point on the south coast, through Seatown, over Thorncombe Beacon and past Eype's Mouth to West Bay. From here it heads north up the River Brit to Bridport, swinging west and north to Pilsdon Pen, briefly joining the Wessex Ridgeway eastwards before reaching Broadwindsor. The King hid overnight in the George Inn, Broadwindsor on 23 September 1651. From here it continues eastwards to the north of Beaminster, before zig-zagging north and east to Winyard's Gap near Chedington, where it meets the head of the River Parrett Trail. Continuing north the path enters Somerset and passes Hardington Marsh, swinging east from Hardington Mandeville to East Coker and then north through Yeovil and Mudford. Crossing the River Yeo and back into Dorset, the path returns like the King to Trent. The King stayed here before setting out for the south coast and exile in France. Skirting north of Sherborne to Sandford Orcas then re-entering Somerset the path passes to the south of Corton Denham to Charlton Horethorne and South Cheriton, then north to pass under the A303 to Wincanton. From here it continues north-east to Penselwood. After crossing the Stour Valley Way and River Stour, the path enters Wiltshire at Zeals. From here it crosses the A303 dual carriageway and passes Zeals House before reaching Mere, passing West Knoyle and climbing Cleeve Hill. Crossing the A350, the path continues east to Hindon, Berwick St. Leonard, Fonthill Bishop and through part of Grovely Wood to reach Great Wishford. Here it crosses the River Wylye to Stoford before heading north and east near Stapleford to cross the A360, dropping down into the valley of the Avon at Middle Woodford before crossing at Lower Woodford. Traversing the country to the north of Salisbury, the path next crosses the A345 and the River Bourne at Winterbourne Dauntsey. After passing Figsbury Ring the path crosses the A30, to follow the course of the former Roman road from Winchester to Old Sarum. As it approaches Middle Winterslow, the path is joined by the Clarendon Way, the two paths following the Roman road over the county boundary. Beacon Hill across the Meon Valley towards Old Winchester Hill Bat and Ball Inn at Broadhalfpenny Down Entering Hampshire, the Monarch's Way and Clarendon Way continue to run together over the chalk through Broughton, crossing the River Test at Houghton. East of the Test the Clarendon Way continues east towards King's Somborne, whilst the Monarch's Way joins the Test Way, heading south down the Test Valley along the bed of the former Sprat and Winkle Line past Horsebridge. The two paths re-cross the Test to Mottisfont, heading south to cross the River Dun at Kimbridge, where the Test Way continues south and the Monarch's Way heads east to cross the Test again to the Bear & Ragged Staff and climbs to Michelmersh. From here eastwards for many miles the route skirts the northern rim of the Tertiary sediments of the Hampshire Basin, alternating between chalk downs to the north and heaths and woodland to the south. From Braishfield, the route crosses the wet clay of Ampfield Wood, passing through the hamlet of Knapp to the north of Ampfield, before heading for Hursley. The path continues east through the hamlets of Bunstead and Silkstead, passing under the M3 and passing the station at Shawford. Here the path crosses the Itchen Way before crossing the River Itchen to Twyford. West of Twyford the path crosses more chalk downs, now part of the South Downs, to Owslebury, before using short sections of Roman road in places to reach Upham. East of Upham the path heads northward for some miles, before joining the South Downs Way (and briefly the Wayfarers Walk) heading east. At Beacon Hill, the Monarch's Way takes a route north of the hill to Warnford, whilst the South Downs Way splits into alternative routes to Warnford or Exton. After crossing the River Meon and A32 the two routes rejoin further east before climbing Old Winchester Hill. To the east the routes diverge, with the South Downs Way continuing eastwards and the Monarch's Way heading south to the Bat & Ball Inn, Clanfield, then west past Broadhalfpenny Down towards Hambledon, before again striking east to Horndean. After crossing the town and A3(M), the path crosses The Holt to Rowland's Castle, where it passes the station. left Entering West Sussex with the Sussex Border Path at Stansted Park, the Monarch's Way passes through Walderton and Stoughton, crossing Stoughton Down to West Dean. Here it crosses the A286 and River Lavant before climbing to the Trundle, on top of St Roche's Hill. Continuing east along a ridge the path passes Goodwood Racecourse and Goodwood Country Park. East of Goodwood the route diverts briefly north towards East Dean before heading south-east to Eartham. Here the path heads north-east along a section of Stane Street through Eartham Wood, before passing through the neolithic camp below Glatting Beacon and heading east down to the River Arun at Houghton. Remaining west of the river past South Stoke, it heads south through the park of Arundel Castle to the town of Arundel, where it crosses the Arun to Warningcamp. From here it continues east across the parish of Patching to Findon, passing near Cissbury Ring and climbing to meet the South Downs Way above Steyning for a short distance. Passing to the south of Steyning it crosses the River Adur at Bramber to Upper Beeding. After crossing Beeding Hill and Thundersbarrow Hill the path approaches the northern edge of the built-up area near Mile Oak, before doubling sharply back to the north of the A27 to continue east across the downs, before heading south down the former route of the Devil's Dyke railway towards West Blatchington.

The instruments can be percussion instruments, or different types of flutes or trumpets, or string instruments that are plucked, hammered or use a form of bow.

After beginning her career in 1980, she wrestled in American independent promotions before joining the World Wrestling Federation (WWF, now WWE). She had rivalries with both The Fabulous Moolah and Sherri Martel and held the WWF Women's Championship and WWF Women's Tag Team Championship. After the WWF's women's division went on hiatus in the 1990s, McIntyre wrestled in several Canadian promotions, holding several championships. McIntyre wore wrestling boots for the first four years of her career, but later wrestled barefoot when someone took one of her boots as a joke and she was forced to wrestle without them. Wrestling barefoot subsequently became one of her trademarks, as well as her high flying wrestling maneuvers. Professional wrestling career=Independent circuit Growing up in Ireland,Shields, Brian. Main Event: WWE in the Raging 80s, p.164 McIntyre had three brothers with whom she wrestled. After finishing high school, she moved to Oregon in 1980 to train with Sandy Barr, under whom she trained with her future opponent and tag team partner, Princess Victoria. McIntyre made her professional wrestling debut in Idaho in 1980, but she did not begin wrestling full-time until three months later. She then joined Vancouver's All Star Wrestling in 1981, where she feuded with Princess Victoria. She continued to feud with Victoria for the remainder of the year in both singles and tag team matches in Vancouver and the NWA Pacific Northwest under promoter Don Owen. In 1982, however, she joined the World Wrestling Federation, where she began teaming with Princess Victoria, and in March, the duo lost a series of matches against the team of The Fabulous Moolah and Wendi Richter. McIntyre, however, defeated Richter in two separate matches in Bill Watts's Mid-South Wrestling Association. In November and December 1982, McIntyre worked for Stampede Wrestling, where she teamed with Judy Martin against Richter and Joyce Grable; the feud between the two teams resumed in April 1983 in Verne Gagne's American Wrestling Association. In May 1983, McIntyre returned to Stampede Wrestling, where she continued her rivalry with Richter and Grable; this time, however, she teamed once again with Princess Victoria. Victoria and McIntyre won the NWA Women's World Tag Team Championship on May 13 in Calgary. Information also available at Wrestling- Titles.com. World Wrestling Federation In 1983, the World Wrestling Federation withdrew from the National Wrestling Alliance, and when McIntyre and Victoria rejoined the promotion in 1984, they were immediately recognized as holding the WWF Women's Tag Team Championship. The duo defended the championship against the team of Wendi Richter and Peggy Lee. Desiree Petersen later replaced Victoria in the team, and the new duo lost the title in August 1985 to Judy Martin and Leilani Kai (known as The Glamour Girls) in Egypt. Information also available at Solie's Title Histories. McIntyre then began wrestling as a singles wrestler, immediately feuding with The Fabulous Moolah, unsuccessfully challenging her at Wrestlemania 2 (the referee counted the pin on McIntyre despite her left leg being draped over the bottom rope which should have stopped the count). She won the WWF Women's Championship on July 3, 1986 when she defeated Moolah at the Brisbane Festival Hall on the WWF's 1986 Australian tour, but Moolah regained the title six days later at the Sydney Entertainment Centre (the only two times the WWF Women's Championship changed hands in the Southern Hemisphere).Shields, Brian.

By 1990, however, the women's division in the WWF was again on hiatus. Canada After leaving the WWF, McIntyre continued to wrestle sporadically on the independent circuit. At that time, there were not many opportunities for females in the business. She competed in the Women's Pro Wrestling organization in the early 1990s. In November 1993, she won the Canadian Wrestling Alliance's Women's Championship from Iron Maiden, but lost it to Iron Maiden again in January 1994. They continued to feud into 1996, when the two women joined Extreme Canadian Championship Wrestling, where the two traded the Women's Championship, which McIntyre held for two months. In September, they competed in a strap match‚Äîa match where the wrestlers must compete while connected via a leather strap‚Äîin which McIntyre was victorious.

Plot introduction  Khushwant Singh, one of India's most well-known and widely read authors, commenced writing The Company of Women when he was eighty-three and finished at age eighty-five. The octogenarian writer has declared ‚Äúas a man gets older, his sex instincts travel from his middle to his head.‚Äù This Mohan Kumar as a student in the U.S., Mohan has \\"lost his virginity\\" at Princeton University to Jessica Brown, a beautiful black lady. Their relationship looked like a honeymoon without wedding. While still in the US, Ms Yasmeen, a Pakistani, revealed to Mohan Kumar the heady passion of a woman older than her male counterpart. After Mohan gets back to India and settles in married life, his passion for women continues undiminished. He feels highly relieved after being divorced by his \\"nagging and ill-tempered\\" wife. But Mohan was an unfaithful husband. His sex escapades, before the divorce and post divorce were unusual and varied, including his repeated relations with his ever-obliging maid, Dhanno, with her practiced charm on the bed. Another woman in Kumar's life was Tamilian Marry Joseph, described by the author as ‚Äúa dark, plump woman in her thirties.‚Äù She worked as a nurse to Kumar's son. She has been described almost inviting Shakti Kumar tacitly with these words, ‚ÄúSaar, one life to live, not to waste it on a drunkard husband. You agree?‚Äù Kumar has agreed. The book describes Kumar's rendezvous with madam Sarojini Bhardwaj, a Professor of English. And, when it came to sex, the lady professor proved that she was stronger than many men. Another lady appearing in the sex life of Kumar was Molly Gomes, who was ‚Äúnot only as an incarnation of sensual impulse, but also as a mistress of sexuality.‚Äù Likewise, Susanthika, \\"the small wonderful bird\\", from Sri Lanka was really active on bed. Major themes The basic theme of the book is the relationship between men and women, who has been depicted in countless works, in innumerable ways and styles, including literary texts and poetry, mediums like paintings, stone carvings, folksongs and folklores. This has been described in the book in the form of a series of events in the life of the lead character, Mohan Kumar. A series of sequences unfold in the book in the form of Mohan Kumar's association and rendezvous with a number of women. In brief, The Company of Women celebrates the universal and the eternal story of man's relationship with woman: the relationship of love, sex, and passion. The book presents this relationship in a very unusual and original style, which is not only uninhibited and erotic, but also enormously enchanting and engrossing. However, the story also serves as a sort of modern-day morality tale, with Mohan Kumar committing suicide as he realizes he has AIDS, in effect, paying for his promiscuity.

Delfino, 35 Cal.4th 180 (2005) is a California Supreme Court opinion by then-Associate Justice Janice R. Brown interpreting the state's SLAPP statute. Specifically, the case holds that an appeal from a denial of an anti-SLAPP motion stays all trial court proceedings: \\"The perfecting of an appeal from the denial of a special motion to strike automatically stays all further trial court proceedings on the merits upon the causes of action affected by the motion...you have a right not to be dragged through the courts because you exercised your constitutional rights.\\" Facts In this case involving the arcana of appellate procedure, research scientists Michelangelo Delfino, Ph.D. and Mary E. Day filed an appeal from a $775,000 defamation judgment for tens of thousands of postings they made on their Website and on various Internet message boards criticizing their former employer, Varian Associates, renamed Varian Medical Systems in April 1999; two senior Varian Associates' executives, George A. Zdasiuk and Susan B. Felch; and a 1999 Varian Associates' spin off, Varian Semiconductor Equipment Associates, a high-tech corporation headquartered in Gloucester, Massachusetts. The judgment against Delfino and Day included a broad injunction ordering them not to \\"publish, post, or otherwise disseminate, directly or indirectly, on the Internet or elsewhere\\" 23 categories of statements that the trial court judge Jack Komar, and not the jury, found \\"untrue\\" and \\"false and defamatory.\\" In the fall of 2001 prior to the Santa Clara County Superior Court trial, Delfino and Day filed a special motion to strike Varian's complaint under California's Anti-SLAPP statute, Code of Civil Procedure section 425.16. The trial court denied the motion and Delfino and Day appealed from that denial, but the trial court and California Courts of Appeal refused to stay the trial under Code of Civil Procedure section 916 while the anti-SLAPP appeal was pending. At the conclusion of a seven-week jury trial the anti-SLAPP appeal was dismissed as moot. Ruling On appeal to the California Sixth District Court of Appeal, in November 2003 a three- judge panel rejected the argument that the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction to conduct the trial because of Delfino and Days' pending appeal from the denial of their anti-SLAPP motion. On March 3, 2004, the California Supreme Court granted review to resolve the jurisdictional question: Does an appeal from the denial of a special motion to strike under the anti-SLAPP statute effect an automatic stay of the trial court proceedings? Three weeks after review was granted the Supreme Court stayed all of the plaintiffs' attempts to collect on the judgment and no compensation were ever collected from Delfino and Day. On March 3, 2005, the Supreme Court held by a 7-0 vote that under Code of Civil Procedure section 916, \\"all of the matters on trial were embraced in and affected by defendants' appeal from the denial of that motion and the trial court lacked subject matter jurisdiction over those matters.\\" By a 6-1 vote, Chief Justice Ronald M. George dissenting, the Supreme Court reversed the judgment, finding that the lack of subject matter jurisdiction in the trial court rendered the resulting trial completely void. The Supreme Court found that Delfino and Day's postings were simply \\"derogatory\\" and remanded the case back to the Santa Clara County Superior Court for a new trial where Komar was quickly disqualified as trial judge and replaced by the Honorable Jamie A. Jacobs-May. On the eve of a second jury trial, in March 2006 with Jacobs-May presiding and with Delfino and Day in pro per, the case settled amicably and more than seven years of remarkably acrimonious litigation ended. Amicus curiae briefs in support of Delfino and Day were filed in the Supreme Court by the California Attorney General, the California Newspaper Publishers Association with the Los Angeles Times, Oakland Tribune and San Francisco Chronicle, and the ACLU. All four Varian plaintiffs represented by the Orrick, Herrington & Sutcliffe law firm and the Pillsbury Winthrop Shaw Pittman LLP failed to receive any amicus support.

History and Formation  Orpheus is a musically themed krewe taking its name from Orpheus {ohr'-fee-uhs} of Classical mythology. The Krewe of Orpheus was founded by Harry Connick Jr., his father Harry Connick Sr., Sonny Borey, and others. When the krewe had their first parade on February 14, 1994,NewsLibrary Search Results there was a record high 700 riders on their parade, and they had then already established themselves as a super krewe.  Mythology  The Krewe of Orpheus derives its name from the mortal Orpheus, son of the god Apollo and the muse Calliope. The story of Orpheus illustrates the power of music in both this world and the next. Legend is that Apollo presented Orpheus with a lyre, which he played with perfection. The music of Orpheus was so beautiful that wild animals ceased their hunting, mountains bowed, seas stopped spraying and trees bent near to listen when he sang. His music was celebrated and cherished by all who heard it. His melodies inspired the noblest love. When Orpheus sang every heart was opened. Orpheus accompanied Jason and the Argonauts on their adventures. During one voyage a storm arose, and Orpheus began to play his lyre. Immediately, the sea calmed and the storm ended. When his fellow sailors were bewitched by the enchanted song of the Sirens, Orpheus took up his lyre and began to sing. The Sirens' song lost all its power, and the women were changed into rocks. However, Orpheus' greatest feat involved his beautiful wife, Eurydice. Shortly after their marriage, Eurydice was pursued by Aristaeus, who was overwhelmed by her beauty. When fleeing his advances, Eurydice stepped on a snake, which bit her foot, and she died. Overcome with grief, Orpheus vowed to rescue her from the regions of the dead. Orpheus gained entry to the Underworld by using his music to charm Charon, the ferryman and Cerberus, the three headed dog that guarded the gates of Hell. He passed through crowds of ghosts, and presented himself before Hades and Persephone. Orpheus strummed his lyre as he implored them to return Eurydice to the realm of the living. As he sang, the ghosts wept and the cheeks of the Furies became wet with tears. The yearning notes from Orpheus' lyre had kindled their memories of the sweet secrets of life's pleasures. At last, Eurydice was called forth. Orpheus was permitted to take her away, on condition that he should not turn to look at her until they both reached the surface. They traveled through dark waters and passages, in silence. They had nearly reached the surface and shafts of sunlight began to illuminate the cavern. In a moment of longing, Orpheus cast a glance behind him. But Eurydice was still in darkness, and she was instantly carried away. They reached for one another, but only grasped the air. Eurydice was lost to Orpheus forever. Touched by the charm and power of the music of Orpheus, Zeus turned his lyre into a constellation. Thus, Orpheus still inspires lovers, at night, as they gaze upon his stars.  Membership  The Krewe accepts members of either gender and any race or ethnicity, and quickly became one of New Orleans' largest, after it was founded in 1993. Ridership is open to dues paid members. Krewe of Orpheus was the first super krewe to include both men and women.  Parade  The Krewe of Orpheus parades on St. Charles Avenue and Canal Street on Lundi Gras (Fat Monday) - the day before Mardi Gras (Fat Tuesday). The parade ends inside the Convention Center where Orpheuscapade begins. Krewe of Orpheus utilize flambeaux to light the parade route.  Parade Themes  Celebrity Monarchs  Iconic Floats  The Leviathan stored at Mardi Gras World, New Orleans Per 2008, the krewe has 36 floats. Harry Connick, Jr. wrote and recorded a song for his 1994 album She, called \\"Here Comes the Big Parade\\". The song's music video shows clips from floats in the parade. The floats have a large amount of flowers, gilding and gold leaf. The flowers are made out of cardboard, wire, paint, gold leafing, some of paper-m√¢ch√©, etc.  Notable Floats  *In 2004, the Krewe of Orpheus bought the Dolly Trolley, the original horse-dawn bus that was used in the opening of Hello Dolly with Barbra Streisand.and others.

Collectible throws from Orpheus include the Orpheus emblem beads, stuffed animals, signature beads, light-up Orpheus medallion beads, custom print go-cups, three different types of doubloons, masks, and 4-foot-long stuffed dragons.  Orpheuscapade  The Orpheus parade ends inside the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center where Orpheuscapade begins. Orpheuscapade is a post-parade black-tie party that includes live music, food, and dancing. It is open to the public by paid admission. It is estimated Orpheuscapade draws a crowd of over 5000 people each year.

Restricted byways On 2 May 2006 the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000 reclassified all remaining roads used as public paths as restricted byways. The public's rights along a restricted byway are to travel: *on foot *on horseback or leading a horse *by vehicle other than mechanically propelled vehicles (thus permitting e.g. bicycles, horse-drawn carriages, to travel along restricted byways), except in certain circumstances. Nature and history of byways A warning sign on a Northamptonshire byway Some byways that have not been over- modernised retain traces of the aggers or ditches that originally ran along each side of the lane; good examples of this can be seen along the side of the Roman \\"Ermine Street\\" in Lincolnshire. By contrast, straight enclosure roads which were laid out between 1760 and 1840 run through the then newly enclosed lands with straight walls or hedges. A Northamptonshire byway Many former Roman roads were later designated as parish boundaries - unlike the newer enclosure roads which rarely ran along boundaries but were solely designed to give access from a village to its newly created fields and to the neighbouring villages. The latter can often be seen to bend and change width at the parish boundary: this reflects the work of the different surveyors who had each built a road from a village to its boundary. If the roads did not meet up exactly, which was quite common, a sharp double bend would result. Many British byways are sinuous, as the poet G. K. Chesterton wrote in The Rolling English Road: See also * Country lane * Dirt road * Rights of way in England and Wales * Rights of way in Scotland * Road ReferencesExternal links Category:Types of roads Category:Trails ","title":"Byway (road)"},{"id":"1863448","text":"Elvis Presley recorded at least 24 songs at Sun Studio in Memphis, Tennessee, between 1953 and 1955. The recordings reflect the wide variety of music that could be heard in Memphis at the time: blues, rhythm & blues, gospel, country & western, hillbilly, rockabilly and bluegrass. Because of the recordings' historical significance in the foundation of rock and roll music, they were inducted into the U.S. Congress's National Recording Registry in 2002.The Full National Recording Registry Of the 24 known taped songs, 22 survive. Ten were released by Sun as Elvis's first five singles between 1954 and 1955. With the exception of the first four songs, which were demos recorded at Presley's expense, all of the songs were produced by Sam Phillips and featured Scotty Moore on guitar and Bill Black on bass. A year after Presley joined RCA Victor, he had a spontaneous informal session with Carl Perkins, Johnny Cash, and Jerry Lee Lewis when visiting the Sun studio. This meeting was recorded on December 4, 1956, and dubbed the Million Dollar Quartet by the local newspaper the next day. These sessions are not generally included when reference is made to \\"Elvis's Sun Sessions\\", however. History=Recordings On July 18, 1953, Presley first went to the Memphis Recording Service at the Sun Record Company, now commonly known as Sun Studio. He paid $3.98 to record the first of two double-sided demo acetates, \\"My Happiness\\" and \\"That's When Your Heartaches Begin\\". Presley reportedly gave the acetate to his mother as a much-belated extra birthday present,\\"However After research Elvis went to a friends grand parents house to listen to the Acetate.

He thought a combination of black blues and boogie-woogie music would be very popular among white people, if presented in the right way.Miller, p.71 In the spring, Presley auditioned for an amateur gospel quartet called The Songfellows, as one of the group was leaving and they were seeking a replacement. However, following Presley's audition, the original group member decided to stay. In May, Presley auditioned at the Hi-Hat in Memphis as a vocalist for a band. Eddie Bond, the owner of the Hi-Hat, turned him down.Guralnick 1994, p.83 When Phillips acquired a demo recording of \\"Without You\\" and was unable to identify the vocalist, his assistant, Marion Keisker, reminded him about the young truck driver. She called him on May 26, 1954. Presley was not able to do justice to the song (the original acetate of the song that Phillips presented to Elvis resides in the Memphis State University collection),Lichter, p.12 but Phillips asked him to perform some of the many other songs he knew. After running through a few songs, Presley expressed an interest in finding a band to play with, and Phillips invited local Western swing musicians Winfield \\"Scotty\\" Moore (electric guitar) and Bill Black (slap bass) to audition Presley. They did so on Sunday, July 4, 1954, at Moore's house. Neither musician was overly impressed, but they agreed a studio session would be useful to explore his potential.\\"Sam Phillips Sun Records Two\\". history-of-rock.com. Retrieved on 2007-10-14. On July 5, 1954, the trio met at Sun studios to rehearse and record a handful of songs. According to Moore, the first song they recorded was \\"I Love You Because\\", but, after a few other country-oriented songs that weren't all that impressive, they decided to take a break. During the break, Presley began \\"acting the fool\\" with Arthur Crudup's \\"That's All Right (Mama)\\", a blues song.Guralnick, Peter (1992). The Complete 50's Masters (CD booklet notes). When the other two musicians joined in, Phillips got them to restart and began taping. This was the bright, upbeat sound he had been looking for.Jorgensen, p.13 Black remarked, \\"Damn. Get that on the radio and they'll run us out of town.\\"(August 11‚ÄìAugust 17, 2007). \\"Would he still be King?\\". Radio Times. BBC, p.12 The group recorded four songs during that session, including bluegrass musician Bill Monroe's \\"Blue Moon of Kentucky\\", which he had written and recorded as a slow waltz. Sources credit Bill Black with initiating the song, with Presley and Moore joining in. They ended up with a fast version of the song in 4/4 time. After an early take, Phillips can be heard on tape saying: \\"Fine, man. Hell, that's different‚Äîthat's a pop song now, nearly 'bout.\\"Naylor and Halliday, p.42 To gauge professional and public reaction, Phillips took several acetates of the session to DJ Dewey Phillips (no relation) of Memphis radio station WHBQ's Red, Hot and Blue show. \\"That's All Right\\" subsequently received its first play on July 8, 1954.Carr and Farren, p.6 A week later, Sun had received some 6,000 advanced orders for \\"That's All Right\\" / \\"Blue Moon of Kentucky,\\" which was released on July 19, 1954. From August 18 through December 8, \\"Blue Moon of Kentucky\\" was consistently higher on the charts, and then both sides began to chart across the South.EPE (July 21, 2004). \\"Elvis Presley Sun Recordings \\". elvis.co.au. Retrieved on August 17, 2007. After several performances with other bands, Presley arranged for Moore and Black to be his regular back-up group, giving them each 25% of the takings. Moore and Black were originally members of their own band, The Starlight Wranglers, but after the success of \\"That's All Right\\", jealousy within the group forced them to split. Over the next 15 months, the trio would release five singles, tour extensively across the South, and appear regularly on the Louisiana Hayride; it was the biggest rival to the Grand Ole Opry at the time. They had originally auditioned for the Opry in October 1954, but they failed to impress the people in charge, or the audience, and were not invited back. Several biographers cite Jim Denny, talent agent at the Opry, as the man who told Presley that he should \\"go back to driving a truck\\". The trio would record at Sun together until November 1955, when Phillips sold Presley's contract to RCA Victor for $40,000; it was, at the time, the highest sum ever paid for a recording contract. Sun had permission to keep pressing the singles until January 1, 1956, and RCA Victor released Presley's first five Sun singles nationally. In January 1956, Presley recorded \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\", his first RCA Victor single. He would return to Sun studios regularly over the next few months, visiting with Phillips and meeting many of the label's new artists. Although Presley never officially recorded for Sun again, he was caught on tape during an impromptu jamming session on December 4, 1956. Presley had arrived during a Carl Perkins recording session, which also featured a young Jerry Lee Lewis on piano, and a new artist named Johnny Cash watching on. During a break in recording, Presley sat at the piano and began to sing along with Perkins, Lewis and Cash. Phillips kept his tape recorder running, and, seeing an opportunity to promote another of his new acts, he arranged for a reporter to cover the event. The recordings would eventually be known as \\"The Million Dollar Quartet\\". During Presley's tenure at Sun Records, he recorded two demo recordings in Lubbock, Texas: \\"Fool, Fool, Fool\\" and \\"Shake, Rattle and Roll\\", which were released for the first time by RCA in the 1990s. These are not considered Sun recordings. Songs recorded Listed are the 24 titles from 1953‚Äì55, ordered by their recording date.

The afternoon became a jam session with Carl Perkins (then already famous for his \\"Blue Suede Shoes\\"), Jerry Lee Lewis (relatively unknown at the time), and Johnny Cash (not heard on the tapes, although he does appear on the cover photo). The taping was largely unintended by the quartet; they were just singing the songs they had in mind. About 40 titles are recorded, most of them incomplete.

Rumored Over the decades, several additional recordings have been claimed as having been recorded by Elvis at Sun Records. The reference work Elvis: The Illustrated Record by Roy Carr and Mick Farren lists the following songs that were, as of 1982, believed to have been recorded by Elvis at Sun Records but as of 2009 remain unreleased and unaccounted for in the official record:Roy Carr and Mick Farren, Elvis: The Illustrated Record (Harmony Books, 1982), p. 22-23 *\\"Tennessee Saturday Night\\" (2 takes recorded July 5‚Äì7, 1954). According to Carr and Farren, RCA planned to include this recording on the 1965 compilation album Elvis for Everyone!, but substituted the Sun side \\"Tomorrow Night\\" instead.Carr and Farren, p. 99 *\\"Uncle Penn\\" (1 take recorded September 9, 1954). Carr and Farren claim the existence of \\"Uncle Penn\\" is proven by it being listed on the session sheet for the recording session of December 8, 1954 that produced \\"Tomorrow Night\\"Carr and Farren, p. 22 however this contradicts the authors' chart that gives the September 9 recording date.Carr and Farren, p. 23 *\\"Oakie Boogie\\" (1 take recorded December 8, 1954). Releases Most of the tapes, including the private single, the Million Dollar Quartet and alternate takes have been released. Sun Singles Ten songs, making five singles, were originally released on the Sun label. These records (in both 45 RPM and 78 RPM formats) are among the most valuable of Elvis's output, fetching four figures in excellent condition: * Sun 209‚ÄîJuly 19, 1954: \\"That's All Right\\" / \\"Blue Moon of Kentucky\\" * Sun 210‚ÄîSeptember 25, 1954: \\"Good Rockin' Tonight\\" / \\"I Don't Care If the Sun Don't Shine\\" * Sun 215‚ÄîDecember 28, 1954: \\"Milkcow Blues Boogie\\" / \\"You're a Heartbreaker\\" * Sun 217‚ÄîApril 10, 1955: \\"Baby Let's Play House\\" / \\"I'm Left, You're Right, She's Gone\\" * Sun 223‚ÄîAugust 6, 1955: \\"I Forgot to Remember to Forget\\" / \\"Mystery Train\\" RCA Releases After signing with RCA, the same songs, in the same b/w combination, were re-released by RCA (December 1955). The songs were available on 78 RPM and 45 RPM, which explains the two ordering-numbers 20/47, respectively: * RCA 20/47-6357: Sun 223 * RCA 20/47-6380: Sun 209 * RCA 20/47-6381: Sun 210 * RCA 20/47-6382: Sun 215 * RCA 20/47-6383: Sun 217 The same pairings were later reissued as part of RCA's Gold Standard series in five different label formats: Black label with dog at top (September 1958), black label with dog on left side (September 1965), orange label (November 1968), red label (September 1970), and black label with dog in upper right hand corner (September 1976) * 447-0600: Sun 223 * 447-0601: Sun 209 **B-side of red label version misspells Elvis's last name as \\"PRESELY\\" * 447-0602: Sun 210 **The original \\"dog on top\\" copies of the above two were released with special picture sleeves * 447-0603: Sun 215 * 447-0604: Sun 217 Albums featuring the Sun recordingsElvis Presley (1956) On January 27, 1956, the first RCA single, \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" b/w \\"I Was the One\\" was released, giving Elvis a nationwide breakthrough. His reputation as a performer on stage was already growing in the same dimensions. On March 23, 1956, the first album, Elvis Presley, was released (RCA 1254). At that moment, \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" was climbing the lists, but as Rock'n'Roll was largely bought by teenagers at the time, and teenagers usually bought singles, albums were seen as less important for the genre; as such, \\"Heartbreak Hotel\\" is not on this album. RCA, however, put five unreleased Sun recordings on this album: * \\"I Love You Because\\" * \\"Just Because\\" * \\"Tryin' to Get to You\\" * \\"I'll Never Let You Go (Little Darlin')\\" * \\"Blue Moon\\" For LP Fans Only (1958) and A Date with Elvis (1959) These two albums were released during Elvis's hitch in the Army, consisting of tracks previously released only as singles or on EPs, including all but one of the ten commercially released Sun tracks. Four were included on For LP Fans Only... * \\"That's All Right\\" * \\"Mystery Train\\" * \\"I'm Left, You're Right, She's Gone\\" * \\"You're a Heartbreaker\\" ...with five featured on A Date with Elvis: * \\"Blue Moon of Kentucky\\" * \\"Milkcow Blues Boogie\\" * \\"Baby, Let's Play House\\" * \\"Good Rockin' Tonight\\" * \\"I Forgot to Remember to Forget\\" The remaining commercial release, \\"I Don't Care If the Sun Don't Shine\\", would not appear on LP until the 1976 compilation \\"The Sun Sessions\\".

His successful campaigns in the 2005‚Äì10 Parliament included the defeat of legislation on home education and saving the Beverley Pasture Masters. In the following parliament, he was involved in the successful campaign for lower Humber Bridge tolls, and successfully persuaded the government to improve the A164 and construct the Beverley Bypass. In 2012, he defeated a proposed increase in VAT on static caravans, which are largely manufactured in the East Riding of Yorkshire. In an interview with the journalist Peter Wilby for The Guardian, Stuart described himself as socially liberal, a \\"deficit hawk\\" who favours faster cuts to public spending, and an end to welfare dependency. He was appointed an Assistant Whip by the new Prime Minister, Theresa May on 18 July 2019. He was later promoted to serve as Parliamentary Undersecretary of State for International Trade in the January 2019 government reshuffle. Chair of Education Schools and Families Select Committee In June 2010, Stuart was elected by MPs as Chair of the Education Select Committee. Despite being a Conservative MP, Stuart frequently disagreed with the Secretary of State for Education Michael Gove. His Committee produces up to six reports a year ranging from single evidence inquiries to more detailed examinations into Education, Schools and Family policy.

SR 17, a freeway and expressway, carries substantial commuter and vacation traffic between Santa Cruz and the rest of the San Francisco Bay Area. Route description From its southern terminus with SR 1 in Santa Cruz, Route 17 begins as a five-lane freeway (narrows to four lanes after Pasatiempo Drive). From there, it proceeds through Scotts Valley. At the north end of Scotts Valley, it becomes a four-lane divided highway, with access at various points without interchanges, and begins a winding ascent of the Santa Cruz Mountains. The road crosses the Santa Clara/Santa Cruz county line through the Patchen Pass, commonly referred to as \\"The Summit\\", at an elevation of 1,800 feet (549 m), where there is an interchange with SR 35. Just north of the summit, a winding descent of the mountains begins, again with access at various points, mostly without grade separations, as far as Los Gatos. At Los Gatos, SR 17 becomes a freeway again. It expands to six lanes after an interchange with SR 85. This interchange has three levels; in a similar fashion to SR 99 at U.S. 50 in Sacramento, SR 17 is at-grade, with the other levels below-grade. The number of lanes later expands to eight shortly before reaching its northern terminus at Interstate 280, where it continues as Interstate 880. SR 17 is part of the California Freeway and Expressway System, and is part of the National Highway System, a network of highways that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR 17 is eligible to be included in the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation. Safety Looking downhill from the Summit Road overpass; brake lights can be seen as cars slow down before the curve known as \\"The Valley Surprise\\". SR 17's combination of narrow shoulders, dense traffic, sharp turns, blind curves, wandering fauna such as deer and mountain lions, and sudden changes in traffic speeds have led to driving conditions that result in a number of collisions and fatalities, leading to the reputation of SR 17 as one of the most dangerous highways in the state. In the winter months, because SR 17 crosses a high precipitation area in the Santa Cruz Mountains, the roadway can become slippery from rain, snow or ice, especially at the summit. Despite having fewer curves than in Santa Cruz County, certain sections of SR 17 in Santa Clara County are so dangerous that they have been nicknamed. The first long sweeping turn North of Summit Road with its sharp angle, off-camber banking, and steep entering downhill slope is called \\"The Valley Surprise\\" for the fact that so many strike the median shortly after having entered the Santa Clara Valley. The most infamous is called \\"Big Moody Curve\\". This curve is named after Big Moody Creek below, slightly greater than a 180 degree turn, and bracketed by additional 90 degree turns. The inside surfaces of the median barriers in both of these turns are normally chipped up and black with tire rubber. Efforts to improve safety have included adding electronic speed monitoring signs and warnings lights on curves, removing trees to improve visibility around blind curves, and increased patrol and enforcement of traffic laws. The portion between Los Gatos and Scotts Valley has been designated the Highway 17 Safety Corridor by Caltrans and the California Highway Patrol. In addition, barbed wired fencing and retaining walls were added after the route suffered landslides in the Loma Prieta Earthquake. The route has seen recent repaving work in 2010, 2014, and 2019-2020. Gillian Cichowski Memorial Overcrossing Bridge, over SR 17 near Los Gatos at Lexington Reservoir, was named by California Senate Concurrent Resolution 32, Chapt. 70 in 1994. Gillian Cichowski was killed in an accident at this location in 1992. This is one of the few highway constructions in California named for a woman. The overpass was in response to a campaign by friends of Gillian Cichowski to make the intersection (with Bear Creek Road) safer. The overpass was open to northbound traffic July 18, 1996 and opened to southbound traffic August 29, 1996. Margaret Green of Sunnyvale, California died in a similar accident near the same location during overpass construction. Gillian Cichowski Memorial Overcrossing. SR 17 in Santa Cruz County is named after California Highway Patrol Lieutenant Michael Walker. Walker was setting flares to direct traffic around an auto accident on New Year's Eve 2005 when he was struck and killed.Lt. Michael Walker Killed New Year‚Äôs Eve While Aiding Motorist , accessed August 26, 2008 Partly in response to this accident near the Glenwood Road intersection, Caltrans began work in 2008 to widen the shoulder to eight feet.Caltrans Public Notice (PDF), access August 26, 2008 History In 1934, the State of California began signing its routes. The route which in subsequent years corresponded with State Route 17 was signed as State Route 13, and described as \\"Santa Cruz to Jct. US 101 at San Rafael, via San Jose, Mt. Eden, and Oakland.\\"California Highways and Public Works, August 1934, p.32 The route taken between Oakland and San Rafael is not described. In the 1920s, the segment from San Jose northward had been signed as US 101-E (\\"east\\"), branching off from US 101-W in San Jose. Santa Cruz Mountains The earliest connection between Santa Cruz and San Jose was an old Native American foot trail. The first road that could be navigated by a wagon was a dirt toll road built by Charlie McKiernan,Beal 1990, p. 70 known as \\"Mountain Charlie\\" by locals, some time around 1853. Portions of this road still exist as Mountain Charlie Road, to the west of Highway 17 and south of Summit Road. Several other stage lines were built as competitors, such as the San Jose Turnpike (1863), which follows the approximate route of present-day Soquel San Jose Road.Beal 1990, pp. 70‚Äì72 After realignment to increase the road width; many sections of the original stage route were cut off. These sections became side streets named with variations containing Old Turnpike. Some of these now dead end streets have retained the look of narrow stage coach roads. SR 17 was opened in 1940, replacing several other modes of transportation, including the old Glenwood Highway from 1919 (which still exists in Glenwood), and the railroad which went all the way from Santa Cruz to San Francisco and Oakland. The railroad stopped operating in 1940 and the tunnels that it passed through were sealed soon after. Nearly all the tunnel entrances still exist, but are unusable as the tunnels themselves are collapsed. The rise in the use of automobiles made the railroads unprofitable. The city of Glenwood, founded by Charles C. Martin in 1851, gained notoriety for hot springs in the area.Beal 1990, pp. 44‚Äì6 The Glenwood Highway, which passed through town, was deserted when the \\"New 17\\" was built, and the town became a ghost of its former self.Beal 1990, p. 48 The town's final resident, Mrs. Ed C. Koch, the great- granddaughter of the founder, died in 1992, and Glenwood is a ghost town. Parts of the original SR 17 lie underwater in Lexington Reservoir. When the reservoir was built, the highway was rerouted to higher ground, and the two towns along its path (Alma and Lexington) were abandoned.Beal 1990, p. 21 When the reservoir levels are extremely low, the old highway pavement is visible as well as some stone and concrete foundations of buildings. East Bay SR 17 first appeared along the east shore of San Francisco Bay in the mid-1930s. The original route between San Jose and Oakland ran along the Old Oakland Road, Main Street (Milpitas) and Warm Springs Boulevard (southern Fremont) proceeding along what is now Fremont Boulevard, which becomes Alvarado Boulevard in Northern Fremont, before entering Union City. From there, the route proceeded along Hesperian Boulevard in Hayward, then into San Leandro via East 14th Street to Davis. It then went west on Davis to Maitland Drive along the southern edge of the Oakland Municipal Airport and across Bay Farm Island to the Bay Farm Island Bridge into Alameda. In Alameda it went via Clay, High, Santa Clara, and Webster to the Posey Tube. SR 17 went through the Posey Tube into Oakland along Harrison Street to 14th, and west on 14th to Broadway where it terminated at a junction with US 40 and SR 24.1936 Shell Oil Map Following the completion of the San Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge in late 1936, SR 17 was re-routed. Instead of turning west at Davis Street in San Leandro, it was continued along East 14th Street into Oakland. At 44th Avenue it turned west, leading to a new diagonal connection to East 12th Street. SR 17 then followed East 12th northward to 14th Avenue, then one block on 14th to East 8th Street, becoming 8th Street into downtown Oakland. It continued west on 8th, picking up a concurrency with Business Route US 50 at Broadway. Both routes continued on 8th to Cypress Street which became an elevated viaduct entering the Bay Bridge Distribution Structure (\\"The Maze\\"). SR 17 terminated here at its junction with US 40 (Eastshore Highway) and US 50 (38th Street).1938 Street Map of East Bay Cities, Standard Oil Co. JM Gousha Co. In 1947, work began on a new freeway through Oakland to replace the street routing of SR 17. It was finished in segments, finishing in 1958 with the completion of the double-decked Cypress Structure leading into the MacArthur Maze. The new freeway was called the \\"Eastshore Freeway\\", continuous with a planned new freeway north of the Maze to replace the old Eastshore Highway.San Francisco and Vicinity, Shell road map, 1956Shell Street Map of East Bay Cities, 1956 In 1958, the freeway south of the Maze was re-named the \\"Nimitz Freeway\\", in honor of WWII Admiral Chester W. Nimitz.Senate Joint Resolution 24, Statutes of California, Chapter 84, 1958 With the completion of the Richmond-San Rafael Bridge in 1956,California Highways and Public Works, September-October 1956, pp.12-18 as well as the first segment of the Eastshore Freeway north of the Maze, SR 17 was extended northward along the new freeway in a concurrency with US 40. SR 17 left the freeway at the Hoffman Blvd. exit (thereafter popularly called the \\"Hoffman Split\\") and proceeded along city streets through Richmond to the San Rafael bridge. It went via Hoffman, Cutting, and Standard Avenue up to the bridge. It crossed the bridge into San Rafael, terminating at a junction with US 101.California Highways and Public Works, November-December 1957, p.28San Francisco and Vicinity, Shell road map, 1956 Shows transitional situation with bridge completed, but route number not yet depicted beyond the Maze. In 1984 the segment of SR 17 from Interstate 280 in San Jose to the Maze (by then known as the \\"MacArthur Maze\\") in Oakland was renumbered as I-880, and the portion of SR 17 from the MacArthur Maze to San Rafael was renumbered as part of I-580. SR 17 was thereby reduced to its current length.

From 1936 to 1975, J.H. Corbeil was a manufacturer of bus bodies; Les Enterprises Michel Corbeil was a body manufacturer that specialized primarily in school buses, opened from 1985 to 2007. In 2007, the company was acquired out of bankruptcy by Collins Industries and renamed Corbeil Bus Corporation. Serving as the Canadian equivalent of Collins Bus Corporation, manufacturing was shifted from Quebec to Hutchinson, Kansas. Prior to its 2007 shift to Kansas, Corbeil manufacturing was located in Saint-Lin‚ÄìLaurentides, Quebec, Canada. Following the 2013 discontinuation of manufacturer Mid Bus, Collins ended the use of the Corbeil name after 2015 in favor of using its namesake brand on its vehicles across North America. History= 1936-1975: J.H. Corbeil  Corbeil traces its roots to 1936, when Joseph Henri Corbeil founded J.H. Corbeil. Located in St-Lin-Laurentides, the company was a manufacturer of bodies for trucks and buses, shifting to bus body production in 1956. Following the 1960 death of Joseph Corbeil, control of J.H. Corbeil shifted to his sons, including Michel Corbeil. During the late 1960s, the company held nearly two-thirds market share of bus body production in Quebec and eastern Canadian provinces. To accommodate increased demand, J.H. Corbeil introduced a larger manufacturing facility in St-Lin-Laurentides (next door to the first factory). After the 1975 sale of J.H. Corbeil, the company ended operations in the early 1980s.  1985-2007: Les Enterprises Michel Corbeil  In 1985, with several business partners in St-Lin-Laurentides, Michel Corbeil founded Les Enterprises Michel Corbeil, Inc. restarting production in the 7,000 square-foot factory founded by his father in 1936. For the first time, Corbeil produced school bus bodies, specializing in bodies for single rear-wheel cutaway van chassis. By the end of 1985, the company produced 77 bus bodies. By the end of the 1980s, production of Corbeil buses expanded, with the company replacing its 1930s facility with a 130,000 square-foot factory to accommodate demand. In 1990, the company added bodies for dual rear-wheel van chassis for the first time. In the early 1990s, the company introduced its first full-size buses, the EMC 1st Premier conventional (EMC=Enterprises Michel Corbeil), using an International 3800 chassis (with Ford B800 as an option). In 1993, the EMC3900 was introduced; sharing its International 3900 chassis with the AmTran Genesis, the EMC3900 was a front-engine transit-style bus. For the United States bus market, Corbeil concentrated on its small bus offerings, not selling the 1st Premier or the EMC3900 outside of Canada. For 1994, Corbeil entered a joint venture with Indiana-based manufacturer Carpenter, manufacturing single rear-wheel buses marketed through its deal network (similar to a joint venture between Blue Bird and Girardin); the joint venture lasted through 1998. In 1995, Corbeil changed its company emblem, shifting from a vertical EMC to a large smiley face on the roofline of the bus, with the design becoming one of the most widely recognized manufacturer emblems in the transportation industry. WIth the addition of the \\"smiley face\\", the EMC 1st Premier was renamed the Corbeil Conventional. In 2000, Corbeil produced a rear-engine transit-style bus using an International 3000 chassis. Similar in configuration to the AmTran RE, very few examples of the Corbeil Rear Engine were produced; all were sold in Canada. In 2001, Les Enterprises Michel Corbeil underwent several major changes. Following poor sales, the Corbeil Rear Engine was withdrawn, alongside the EMC3900 front- engine bus. The body of Corbeil minibuses and conventionals underwent several revisions, largely distinguished by the warning light surrounds. During the early 2000s, Les Enterprises Michel Corbeil struggled to compete. In 1999, Carpenter shifted exclusively towards production of full-size buses, effectively ending its joint distribution agreement with Corbeil (before closing its operations forever in 2001). In the mid-2000s, IC Corporation (the successor to AmTran/Ward) commenced sales of full-size buses in Canada, largely taking the place of the discontinued Corbeil Conventional and EMC3900. In September 2007, after 22 years of assembly, Corbeil shut down its operations.

In a major change, Corbeil transitioned from a stand- alone manufacturer to a regional product line of Collins Bus Corporation, consolidating headquarters from Quebec to the Hutchinson, Kansas facility of Collins. The parent company of Mid Bus, in 2007, Collins consolidated production of all three bus product ranges in its Kansas facility, with the first American-produced Corbeils assembled before 2008. As the company restarted bus production, Corbeil offered the Collins Bantam product line under the Corbeil Quantum nomenclature. To minimize internal competition, Collins marketed itself, Mid Bus, and Corbeil in different regions of North America. As before, Corbeil production was marketed primarily in Canada (Quebec and Ontario) and New England. In 2012, the Quantum naming scheme was retired as Collins introduced the NexBus bodyshell for all three of its brands (shifting towards a naming scheme naming buses by function). During the 2010s, Collins has consolidated from three vehicle brands to one. In 2013, Mid Bus (the final remaining entity of the bus manufacturer Superior) was withdrawn. In 2016, Collins ended the use of the Corbeil brand in Canada in favor of using the Collins brand across North America.

Biography Joasaphus took monastic vows in Solovetsky Monastery. In 1621, he became a hegumen at Pskovo-Pechorsky Monastery. In January 1627, Joasaphus was appointed archbishop of Pskov and Velikiye Luki. He is known for his protection of Pskov's trade privileges and resistance to pretensions of the German merchants, for which he would be punished by the patriarch. Patriarch of Moscow Upon Philaret's death in 1634, Joasaphus was appointed his successor, upon his recommendation. His selection to the role of Patriarch was held in the traditional way: The Council of Bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church (knowing in advance the will of Mikhaill Romanov) pointed to three candidates, of whom the Tsar could choose. Enthronement of the new Primate of the Russian Orthodox Church was held, also in keeping with tradition, the council of the Dormition of the Mother of God in the Kremlin in Moscow on 6 February 1634. One of Joasaphus' first deeds was severe punishment of Joseph Kurtsevich, Archbishop of Suzdal, for his indecent behaviour. He took part in reviving Moscow's printing activities. They published 23 ecclesiastic books under his supervision. In 1636, Joasaphus wrote –ü–∞–º—è—Ç—å (Pamyat, or memo), in which he urged Russian clergymen to settle all the discords between themselves. He also published a piece called –õ–µ—Å—Ç–Ω–∏—Ü–∞ –≤–ª–∞—Å—Ç—è–º (Lestnitsa vlastyam, or Hierarchy of power), in which he explained the hierarchy of clergymen during divine services and sobors. Also, Joasaphus published the so-called –¢—Ä–µ–±–Ω–∏–∫ (Trebnik, or book of prayers) with a supplement of Philaret's resolutions and decrees. As Patriarch, he did not interfere in affairs of state policy and refused to even granting the tsar advice in this regard, thereby the strengthening process the position of the Patriarchate in the country declined. He focused instead on efforts to moral renewal of society. He aimed for the effective implementation of the provisions of the Council of the Hundred Chapters in terms of arrangement of worship, opposed the custom of simultaneous execution of several passages of worship at the same time and false jurodiwych. Joasaphus I is buried in the Cathedral of the Dormition in the Moscow Kremlin. Legacy Most historians assess Josaphus as a colorless figure. According to the historian Parsley such determination activities of the patriarch is unfair, because the lack of interest of Josaphus for state affairs did not mean lack of involvement in the problems of the Orthodox Church, where the latter showed the energy and determination. Parsley also points out that the relatively short period of office of the patriarch by Joazafa results in the obfuscation of its achievements and the personalities of the two other seventeenth-century Russian Orthodox Church superiors: Filaret and Nikon. At the same time the authors of works devoted to Josaphus give it a raw ascetic, pious and humble man.

Krapf played an important role in exploring East Africa with Johannes Rebmann. They were the first Europeans to see Mount Kenya with the help of Kikuyus who dwelled at its slopes and Kilimanjaro. Krapf also played a key role in exploring the East African coastline. Early life Krapf was born into a Lutheran family of farmers in southwest Germany. From his school days onward he developed his gift for languages. He initially studied Latin, Greek, French and Italian. Other more languages were to follow throughout his life. After finishing school he joined the Basel Mission Seminary at age 17 but discontinued his studies as he had doubts about his missionary vocation. He read theology at University of T√ºbingen and graduated in 1834. While working as an assistant village pastor, he met a Basel missionary who encouraged him to resume his missionary vocation. Ethiopia In 1836 he was invited by the Anglican Church Missionary Society (CMS) to join their work in Ethiopia. Basel Mission seconded him to the Anglicans and from 1837-1842 he worked in this ancient Christian land. He prepared himself by learning ancient Ge'ez and the Amharic language of the highlands. Landing at Tadjura, Krapf followed the trade route to Shewa where he presented himself to its ruler, Meridazmach Sahle Selassie, and later accompanied the Meridazmach on a military campaign in southern Shewa. Krapf's pietist background did not help him much to understand and appreciate traditional Ethiopian Christianity, especially their emphasis on saints, liturgy and use of Ge'ez, a language no longer spoken. When he departed Shewa in 1842, he found his way to Gondar blocked by the aftermath of the Battle of Debre Tabor, retraced his steps to the court of Adara Bille, a chieftain of the Wollo Amhara who then robbed him. Krapf managed to effect his escape with his servants, and made his way to Massawa supported by the reluctant charity of the local inhabitants. Thus he centered his interest on the Oromo people of southern Ethiopia, in his time known as the Galla, who then were largely believers in a traditional religion. He learned their language and started translating parts of the New Testament into it. While 1842 saw Krapf receive a doctorate from University of T√ºbingen for his research into the Ethiopian languages, it also witnessed the expulsion of all Western missionaries from Ethiopia, which ended his work there. In association with his colleague, Carl Wilhelm Isenberg, he published a memoir of his time in Ethiopia, Journals of Isenberg and Krapf in 1843.

From there he set off for East Africa hoping to reach the Oromo from what is now the Kenyan coast. Most of the East African coastline was then part of the Zanzibar sultanate. Sultan Sayyid Said gave him a permit to start a missionary station at the coastal city of Mombasa. Krapf started again by learning the languages of the local Mijikenda people and also Swahili which is an East African lingua franca language of communication. Soon after arrival in Mombasa his wife and young daughter suffered and died from malaria. Krapf moved to the higher grounds of Rabai on the coastal hills and started his station New Rabai. Here he wrote the first dictionary and grammar of the Swahili language. He also started studying other African languages, drafting dictionaries and translating sections of the Bible. Working with a Muslim judge named Ali bin Modehin, he translated Genesis. He went on to translate the New Testament, as well as the Book of Common Prayer. However, most of this was unpublished, though it was later used in revising a translation in a more southern version of Swahili.Ansre, Gilbert. 1988. To unify or dialectize? In Issues in Bible Translation, ed. by Philip Stine, 187-206. (United Bible Societies Monograph 3.) London: United Bible Societies. In 1846 he was joined by Johannes Rebmann, another southwest German Lutheran who was in the service of the CMS. Krapf and Rebmann set off to explore the interior of East Africa and they were the first Europeans to see the snowcapped mountains of Kilimanjaro and Mount Kenya. They sent reports about them to Europe which were ridiculed by the experts. Krapf's deteriorating health forced him to return to Germany in 1853. He brought with him several old Swahili manuscripts, including copies of the Book of the Battle of Tambuka, the earliest Swahili manuscript. In Korntal he continued his linguistic studies and advisory work for the Christian missions.Albert S G√©rard, Contexts of African Literature, page 90. Krapf's legacy * The Anglican Church of Kenya counts him as its founding father. * Linguists have been drawing on his works as he studied languages as diverse as Ge'ez, Amharic, Oromo, Swahili, Kamba, Mijikenda and Maasai language. * His house at New Rabai is now part of Rabai Museum, one of the National Museums of Kenya. The building of the German Embassy at Nairobi is called \\"Ludwig-Krapf-House\\". * In his home town of T√ºbingen-Derendingen there is an elementary school that bears his name.

The Specialist Schools and Academies Trust was responsible for the delivery of the programme. The scheme ended in 2010, by which time there were nearly 3,000 specialist schools, which were 88% of the state-funded secondary schools in England. History Numbers of specialist schools in England by year and first specialism The Education Reform Act 1988 introduced a new compulsory subject of Technology, but there were insufficient funds to equip all schools to teach the subject. A first attempt at developing centres of excellence, the City Technology College programme between 1988 and 1993, had produced only 15 schools. In 1994, the Conservative government, at the urging of Sir Cyril Taylor, designated 35 grant-maintained and voluntary aided schools as Technology Colleges. The schools were required to arrange private sponsorship of ¬£100,000, and would then receive a matching government capital grant and increased recurrent funding. The following year the programme was opened to all maintained schools, and specialism in Languages was added. Specialisms in Arts and Sport were added in 1996. As specialism implied diversity of schools, it was opposed by many supporters of comprehensive schools, including many in the Labour Party. Nevertheless, in 1997 the new Labour government, also encouraged by Sir Cyril Taylor, adopted the embryonic programme, and the number of specialist schools continued to grow. The School Standards and Framework Act 1998 made it possible for specialist schools to select up to 10% of their intake on aptitude in the existing specialisms in sport, the arts, modern languages and technology, though new selection for aptitude in technology was prohibited in 2008. However, few took up this option. The 2001 white paper Schools Achieving Success envisaged expansion of the programme to 50% of secondary schools by 2005, and introduced new specialisms in Business and Enterprise, Engineering, Mathematics and Computing and Science. The emphasis changed from centres of excellence to a means of driving up standards in most schools. The required amount of private sponsorship was halved, and could be made up of goods and services in lieu of cash. Software donations had been ineligible due to the difficulty in evaluating the true value of something that has no manufacturing cost and can simply be given away as a form of collateral, but this changed when Oracle and then Microsoft were allowed to sponsor the programme with \\"in kind\\" donations. In 2002 the government introduced the Partnership Fund, funded at ¬£3 million per annum, to make up the shortfall for schools that were unable to raise the required ¬£50,000 of private sponsorship. Specialisms in Humanities and Music were added in 2004. By 2008 approximately 90% of maintained secondary schools had become specialist schools. Extension of the specialist programme to primary schools was trialled at 34 schools in England, starting in 2007. The specialisms involved in the pilot were Arts, Music, Languages, Science and Physical Education/Sport. A specialist schools programme was trialled by the Department of Education of Northern Ireland from 2006, with 44 schools being awarded the status by September 2009.  Closure  When the Coalition government took power in May 2010, the scheme was ended and funding was absorbed into general school budgets. Gaining specialist school status To apply for specialist school status, a school must demonstrate reasonable standards of achievement, and produce a four-year development plan with quantified targets related to learning outcomes. The school must also raise ¬£50,000 in private sector sponsorship. Private sector sponsorship includes charitable trusts, internal fund raising and donations from private companies. In some cases donations can be made in cash from entities in the private sector such as Arcadia and HSBC, but may also be donations \\"in kind\\" of goods or services. The total sponsorship to date is of the order of ¬£100m. A school may specialise in any of the following fields, or combine specialisms in two of them (at the same level of funding): * Arts (can be Media, Performing Arts, Visual Arts, or combination of these) * Business & Enterprise * Engineering * Humanities * Languages * Mathematics & Computing * Music * Science * Sports * Technology Specialist schools must still meet the full requirements of the English national curriculum, so the specialism is seen as adding value to the existing statutory provision rather than being a radical departure from it. The reward for achieving specialist status is a government grant of ¬£100,000 to go with the ¬£50,000 in sponsorship for a capital project related to the specialism and an extra ¬£129 per pupil per year for four years to support the development plan. This is normally targeted on additional staffing and professional development, though up to 30% may be spent on equipment. Schools that make a good attempt at achieving their targets over the 4 year development plan period normally have their grants renewed at 3-year intervals with no further need to raise sponsorship. However since 2008, the government has sought to encourage long-term relationships with business partners by offering a matching grant to redesignating specialist schools that are able to raise a further ¬£25,000 in private sponsorship. High Performing Specialist Status Some schools that demonstrated that they were achieving significantly higher results than other schools were invited to apply to be designated as High Performing Specialist Schools. This typically allowed the school to apply for a further specialism, which brought with it additional funding so that the school could develop that further specialism. By 2009 some 900 schools (30% of specialist schools) had achieved this status. Evaluation= Results  David Jesson of the University of York published a series of annual studies of the results of the specialist schools program, on behalf of the SSAT. These studies reported that non-selective specialist schools achieved significantly higher results at GCSE results than non-specialist comprehensive schools, that they achieved higher 'added value' when prior achievement was taken into account, and that the gains had increased with the length of time the school had been specialist. Jesson's statistical methodology was criticised, and others pointed out that early specialist schools were chosen for the programme because they were already successful. Other studies found that specialist schools performed slightly better at GCSE, particularly benefitting more able pupils and narrowing the gap between boys and girls. Subsequent studies attributed the increase to the additional funding, and reported that the effect was diminishing as a greater proportion of schools become specialist. Systemic effects Specialist schools and academies were promoted, notably by Estelle Morris (Education Secretary 2001-2002), as part of an attempt to improve standards by 'increasing diversity' in secondary schools. Left wing commentators had criticised this move away from the comprehensive ideal. The two biggest UK teaching unions had opposed the programme because they said that it created a two-tier education system, made up of specialist schools with extra funding and non-specialist schools which could not have benefited from any extra money. There was also evidence that specialist schools took fewer children from poorer families than non-specialist schools. One possible cause was that it may have been easier for middle-class parents to raise the necessary sponsorship.

It was the first album after the band reformed in 1975 and was recorded after a European tour. As the first self-produced album by the band, it featured a tighter, more pared-down sound than the band's earlier recordings with producer John Anthony. Hammill said \\"we did not want to make 'Son of Pawn Hearts' with a big long side two and lots of studio experiments\\". Van der Graaf Generator would never work with an outside producer from this point forward. Hammill made extensive use of the Hohner Clavinet D6 keyboard, which he had first started using on his previous solo album, Nadir's Big Chance (1975). The first release of the record in the United States was on Mercury Records. The 2005 reissue added live performances by the band of two songs from Peter Hammill's album The Silent Corner and the Empty Stage (1974), recorded at a concert at L'Altro Mondo, Rimini, Italy.  Artwork  Godbluffs album cover was minimal, consisting of a band logo and \\"stamped\\" red album title on an otherwise black sleeve. The band logo that first appeared here was designed by John Pasche; it would also be used on the next two albums, Still Life (April 1976) and World Record (October 1976). Godbluffs sleeve design was later parodied on the cover of Fall Heads Roll by The Fall.  Reception  In Melody Maker, the reviewer said that \\"in a very real sense, [Godbluff] is the sound of the mid-seventies: uncomfortable, coherent, unremitting, courageous\\". Geoff Barton of Sounds deemed Godbluff \\"simply, an essential buy\\". A negative review appeared in the Lancashire Evening Post in November 1975, in which Bob Papworth wrote that \\"Godbluff is a lengthy exhibition of the type of studiously avant-garde rock which so many other groups play infinitely better.\\" Papworth added that \\"Guy Evans couldn't drum his way out of a paper bag and David Jackson's saxes and flutes are a little too simplistic to be credible.\\" In his 2011 AllMusic review, Steve McDonald wrote: \\"the album opened with daring quietness, with David Jackson's flute echoing across the stereo space, joined by Hammill's voice as he whispered the opening lines. There was sturm und drang to come, but the music had been opened up and the lyrics had developed more focus, often abandoning metaphor in favor of statement. Godbluff was a bravura comeback ‚Äì only four cuts, but all were classics.\\" In a May 2002 review in Mojo magazine, Julian Cope said of the album: \\"It was the best re-formation ever. Godbluff was every inch a classic. It conjured up vast tracts of heathland, the burning huts of herdsmen, hordes of chariot maniacs trashing farmsteads, heads on javelins stuck in. And Hammill standing amidst all this, Zoroaster-like and mystified, searching desperately and eloquently for some semblance of moral where there was none.\\"  Track listing  All tracks written by Peter Hammill, except where indicated.

The production, largely a police procedural, features Humphrey Bogart and is based on the Murder, Inc. trials. Plot The action is set in an unnamed American city and is told mainly in flashback, and flashbacks within flashbacks. The Terrified Witness Under heavy police protection, gangster Joe Rico (Ted de Corsia) arrives late at night at the courthouse to testify against crime lord Albert Mendoza (Everett Sloane). There have been several attempts on Rico's life and he is a bag of nerves, but lead prosecutor ADA Martin Ferguson (Humphrey Bogart) reminds him that he himself faces plenty of charges that could \\"burn you a dozen times\\". Ferguson is bound and determined to get Mendoza \\"in the electric chair\\" and stresses to Rico that Mendoza will \\"die, he's got to die, and you're going to kill him.\\" After yet another attempt on his life, Rico gives his bodyguards the slip and tries to escape by reaching the fire escape on the eighth floor of the building, but he falls off the ledge and is killed on impact when he hits the courtyard. Rico was the only evidence Ferguson had against Mendoza, who will walk away in the morning as a free man. However, he believes that something else came up in the course of the investigation that might make the case‚Äîif only he could remember it. He and police Capt. Nelson (Roy Roberts) decide to go through the evidence hoping that something will come up. The Original Investigation The case began when a distraught man named James \\"Duke\\" Malloy (Michael Tolan), a small-time gangster and strongarm-man, burst into a police station and claimed to have killed his girlfriend, under pressure from others. At the crime scene, which is out in the countryside, the police find an empty grave. Malloy, overcome with grief, bitterly explains that his girlfriend was a \\"contract\\" and a \\"hit\\", terms which mean nothing to the officers. He later commits suicide in his cell. Ferguson, the ADA in charge of homicide, is brought in on the case. Malloy only had convictions for petty crimes, not murder, but a check of his associates leads the investigators to \\"Big Babe\\" Lazick (Zero Mostel). Lazick refuses to talk, but when Ferguson threatens to jail his wife and put his little son into foster care, Lazick confesses that he is part of a \\"troop\\" (a group of killers) operating under the orders of Joe Rico who gets requests to commit murders over the telephone from a third party. The gang uses terms like \\"contract\\" (a request to commit murder) and \\"hit\\" (the actual killing) in case others‚Äîmainly the cops‚Äîare listening in. The killers get a regular salary (even if they go to jail), their families are looked after if anything goes wrong and bonuses are paid for actual killings. Only Rico knows who the top boss is. The killers carry out murders for profit, the idea being that they are hired to kill someone at the request of someone else (the person's spouse or business partner, for example). The killer will have no motive for committing the crime and thus will not be suspected by the police, while the client with the motive will have a perfect alibi. Furthermore, the client has to keep contributing money in case of exposure. Lazick leads the police to the body of Nina Lombardo, Malloy's girlfriend whose murder started the investigation. It emerges that she was a contract whom Malloy was supposed to kill, but he instead fell in love with her. He tried to cover it up but his associates caught up with them and forced him to kill her. Nina's roommate, Teresa Davis (Patricia Joiner) tells the detectives that Nina's real name was Angela Vetto and that she was in hiding since her father's death. Ten years beforehand Angela and her father, a cab driver, witnessed the murder of John Webb, a caf√© owner. The police eventually find a mass grave filled with dozens of bodies. As the authorities close in on them, the gang begins to break up. Some go into hiding, fearing for their lives as others are killed by other members from out of town. Rico himself is hiding on a farm with his last remaining accomplices. He calls his boss, whose answers do not reassure him. Rico pretends to go to town for a contract but instead parks his car behind some bushes. He later witnesses his accomplices being murdered by a pair of hired killers sent by his boss to silence everyone‚Äîincluding Rico. Rico contacts Ferguson. In return for being spared the death penalty, he offers to testify against his boss, Mendoza. Rico first met Mendoza when the latter tried to interfere in a bookmaking racket run by Rico's previous employer. Impressed by the beating he got from Rico, Mendoza took him to a caf√© and explained the concept of his new business: murder for profit. To prove his point he killed the caf√© owner, John Webb, for which he received $500. However, the killing was witnessed by Tony Vetto (Tito Vuolo) and his daughter. Mendoza and Rico got away, but years later Vetto recognized Mendoza as a cab fare and was murdered by Rico, on orders from Mendoza, before he could go to the police. Desperate Hunt With Rico now dead, Mendoza will walk. Frustrated, Ferguson goes to Mendoza's cell and leaves him with photos of his victims, warning him of the nightmares that they will give him. He then returns to the evidence room and listens to a tape made of Rico's confession -- which is not admissible in court. In it, Rico describes Vetto's daughter as having \\"big blue eyes\\"; Ferguson remembered that Nina Lombardo (assumed to be Angela Vetto) had brown eyes. On the other hand, her roommate, Teresa Davis, did have blue eyes. Ferguson concludes that Nina was pointed out as Duke's contract by mistake. Teresa told the police that Nina was Angela Vetto as a hint: to get them on the trail of the killers without getting involved herself; she even tried to leave town, but Ferguson warned her against it. However, from Nina's photo, Mendoza has come to the same conclusion and, through his attorney, sends two of his remaining men after the real Angela Vetto. Ferguson and Nelson arrive at her house to learn that she has gone shopping. The streets are too crowded for them to find her, so Ferguson uses a music store's sidewalk loudspeakers to warn her that her life is in danger and to contact him at the store. Angela does so and Ferguson sets off to meet her, followed by the killers. In the subsequent shootout, Ferguson kills one of the gangsters and the other is arrested. He then escorts Angela Vetto to testify against Mendoza and put him in the chair. Cast * Humphrey Bogart as Dist. Atty.

Walsh refused to take the credit, calling it Windust's work. This was Bogart's last film for Warner Bros., the studio that had made him a star. Warner only distributed the film. It was produced by United States Pictures, and is now owned by Republic Pictures, a division of Paramount Pictures. Background Although largely fictional, the film is based on the real-life investigation into a group of hired killers dubbed by the press as \\"Murder, Inc.\\" (the film was released under that title in the United Kingdom). It was during this investigation, and the Kefauver hearings, that terms like \\"contract\\" (a deal to commit a murder) and \\"hit\\" (the actual killing itself) first came into the public knowledge. The gangsters used such codes in case of eavesdroppers or phone tappings by the police. Bogart's ADA Martin Ferguson is based on Burton Turkus, who led the prosecutions of several members of the Murder, Inc. gang.The Aurum Film Encyclopaedia - Gangsters, edited by Phil Hardy, published in 1998 by Aurum. His book on the case was published at about the same time the film was released. Ted de Corsia's Joe Rico was probably inspired by Abe Reles. Like Rico, Reles was about to testify against a major crime lord but, although under heavy police guard, was found dead after falling out of the Half Moon Hotel in Coney Island on November 12, 1941. It has never been established for sure if Reles' death was murder, accident or suicide. Reception=Box Office According to Warner Bros records the film earned $1,584,000 domestically and $1,289,000 foreign. Critical response When the film was released the staff at Variety magazine praised director Windust, writing, \\"The film plays fast and excitingly in dealing with Humphrey Bogart‚Äôs efforts to bring the head of a gang of killers to justice. The script uses the flashback technique to get the story on film, but it is wisely used so as not to tip the ending and spoil suspense ... Bretaigne Windust‚Äôs direction is thorough, never missing an opportunity to sharpen suspense values, and the tension builds constantly.\\"Variety. Staff, film review, 1951. Accessed: July 16, 2013. Noir analysis Film critic Dennis Schwartz questioned if the film should be labeled as film noir, writing, \\"The crime film tells for the first time in film how a mob works and its use of terms such as 'contract', 'hit', and 'finger man.' It is shot in a semi-documentary style and looked more like a crime caper movie than the film noir category most film critics have classified it under.\\"Schwartz, Dennis.

It was founded in 1934 and includes savannah, montane and swamp habitats. The park is named for the Kagera River which flows along its eastern boundary feeding into Lake Ihema and several smaller lakes. The complex system of lakes and linking papyrus swamps makes up over a third of the park, which is the largest protected wetland in Eastern-Central Africa.  History  Akagera National Park was founded in 1934 by the Belgian government, which at the time occupied Rwanda. The park was large and was known for its biodiversity. Akagera used to have a large population of African wild dogs.http://www.apncb.be/archives/publications/fol63694/1962-contribution-la- connaissance-des-lycaons-au-parc-national-de-la-kagera At one point, it was known as the 'Parc aux Lycaons' and wild dogs were so abundant, that the Belgian government considered them a pest. However, a disease epidemic diminished the population and the last wild dogs were seen in 1984. Vande weghe, Jean Pierre: Akagera: Land of water, grass and fire / Jean Pierre Vande weghe. With collaboration of Th√©r√®se Abandibakobwa, Jos√© Kalpers a.o. Photography by Philippe Dejace. Translated by Alicia L. Spruijt-Ray. - Brussels: World Wildlife Fund for Nature, 1990 In 1957, black rhinos were introduced from Tanzania. In the 1970s, more than 50 black rhinos lived in the savannah-habitat of the park. Due to widespread poaching, the population declined over the following decades, and the last confirmed sighting was in 2007. In 1986, Masai giraffes were introduced from Kenya. Their population has grown to over 80 individuals in recent years. Around 1990, Akagera was known to have a population of 250 to 300 lions. In the years following the Rwandan Civil War, the entire population was killed by farmers who returned to Rwanda after the War and settled in the park. In 2009 the Rwanda Development Board (RDB) and the African Parks Network entered into a 20-year renewable agreement for the joint management of Akagera. The Akagera Management Company was formed in 2010 as the joint management body for Akagera National Park. Over the next 5 years a $10 million expenditure was carried out in the national park area, with financial help from the Howard Buffett Foundation. The aim was to increase the security of the national park and to reintroduce locally extinct species. Security measures that were taken include: the construction of a western boundary fence which measures , deploying an air surveillance helicopter, training of an expert rhino tracking and protection team and a canine anti-poaching unit. Buffaloes in Akagera National park In July 2015, seven lions from South Africa were introduced and released in the park, making them the first lions in Rwanda for 15 years. AndBeyond donated five lionesses from Phinda Private Game Reserve. and Tembe Elephant Park in KwaZulu-Natal donated two male lions. This effort was described by African Parks as \\"a ground-breaking conservation effort for both the park and the country\\" as part of a project aimed at reversing the local extinction of the species in Akagera National Park. Since 2015, the lion population has grown to almost 40 animals and it keeps growing. In May 2017, a joint operation between the Rwanda Development Board and African Parks saw the reintroduction of 18 Eastern black rhinoceroses from South Africa, which had been absent for 10 years. With the reintroduction of black rhinos and lions, the national park is now home to all of Africa's \\"big five\\": lion, African leopard, African bush elephant, rhinoceros, and African buffalo. Topi antelopes in Akagera National Park Elephants in Akagera National Park During June 2019, Akagera received a further 5 eastern black rhinoceros from 3 different zoos in 3 different countries located across Europe. The zoos includes Dvur Kralove zoo from the Czech Republic, Flamingo Land from the UK and Ree Park Safari from Denmark.

He was born √âtienne Nicolas Marie B√©chet, Sieur de Rochefontaine. Born in Ay, Marne France, Rochefontaine came to America in 1778 after failing to gain a position in the French Royal Corps of Engineers. He volunteered in General Washington's Continental Army on May 15, 1778 and was appointed captain in the Corps of Engineers on September 18, 1778. For his distinguished services at the siege of Yorktown, Rochefontaine was given the brevet rank of major by Congress, November 16, 1781. He returned to France in 1783 and served as an infantry officer, reaching the rank of colonel in the French Army. He came back to the United States in 1792 and anglicized his first name to Stephen. President Washington appointed him a civilian engineer to fortify the New England coast, in 1794. After the new Corps of Artillerists and Engineers was organized, Washington made Rochefontaine a lieutenant colonel and commandant of the new Corps on February 26, 1795. Rochefontaine started a military school at West Point in 1795, but the building and all his equipment were burned the following year.

He served as United States Solicitor General under President Ronald Reagan from 1985 to 1989. He is a professor at Harvard Law School and has been a visiting professor at Columbia Law School. He also serves on the board of the nonpartisan group, the Campaign Legal Center. Fried is the author of nine books and over 30 journal articles, and his work has appeared in over a dozen collections. Early life and education Fried was born in 1935 in Prague, Czechoslovakia, where his father was an important industrialist and Czech patriot. The Frieds left Czechoslovakia in 1939 to escape Nazi Germany's persecution of Jews, lived in England for almost two years and came to the United States in 1941 via Montreal, Quebec, Canada. He and his parents became United States citizens in 1948, after the Communist takeover of Czechoslovakia. After graduating from the Lawrenceville School in 1952, he attended Princeton University, where he was a member of Phi Beta Kappa and received an A.B. in modern languages and literature in 1956 after completing a senior thesis titled \\"The Phedre of Racine: An Analysis of the Play's Artistry.\\" Fried then attended the University of Oxford, where he earned a Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts degree in jurisprudence, in 1958 and 1960, respectively, and was awarded the Ordronnaux Prize in Law (1958). In 1960, Fried received his Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) degree from Columbia Law School, where he was a Stone Scholar. Subsequently, he served as law clerk to Supreme Court Justice John Marshall Harlan II. Legal career Fried is admitted to the bars of the United States Supreme Court, United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, the District of Columbia, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, and numerous U.S. courts of appeals. He argued 25 cases in front of the Supreme Court while in the Solicitor General's office. He has served as counsel to a number of major law firms and clients, and in that capacity argued several major cases, perhaps the most important being Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, both in the Supreme Court and in the Ninth Circuit on remand. Fried's government service includes a year as Special Assistant to the Attorney General of the United States (1984‚Äì85) and a consulting relationship to that office (1983), as well as advisory roles with the Department of Transportation (1981‚Äì83) and President Ronald Reagan (1982). In October 1985, Reagan appointed Fried as Solicitor General of the United States. Fried had previously served as Deputy Solicitor General and Acting Solicitor General. As Solicitor General, he represented the Reagan Administration before the Supreme Court in 25 cases. In 1989, when Reagan left office, Fried returned to Harvard Law School. From September 1995 until June 1999, Fried served as an Associate Justice of the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts, while teaching constitutional law at Harvard Law School as a Distinguished Lecturer. Prior to joining the court, Fried held the chair of Carter Professor of General Jurisprudence at Harvard Law School. On July 1, 1999, he returned to Harvard Law School as a full-time member of the faculty and Beneficial Professor of Law. He has served on the Harvard Law School faculty since 1961, teaching courses on appellate advocacy, commercial law, constitutional law, contracts, criminal law, federal courts, labor law, torts, legal philosophy, and medical ethics. Fried speaking at Harvard Law School in 2009. Fried has published extensively. He is the author of nine books and over 30 journal articles, and his work has appeared in over a dozen collections. Unusually for a law professor without a graduate degree in philosophy, he has published significant work in moral and political theory only indirectly related to the law; Right and Wrong, for instance is an general statement of a Kantian position in ethics with affinities with the work of Thomas Nagel, John Rawls, and Robert Nozick. On September 27, 2010, he and Gregory Fried discussed their book Because It Is Wrong: Torture, Privacy, and Presidential Power in the Age of Terror at the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Fried has been Orgain Lecturer at the University of Texas (1982), Tanner Lecturer on Human Values at Stanford University (1981), and Harris Lecturer on Medical Ethics at the Harvard Medical School (1974‚Äì75). He was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship in 1971‚Äì72. Fried is a member of the National Academy of Sciences's Institute of Medicine, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Law Institute. Politics and affiliations In September 2005, Fried testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in support of the nomination of John Roberts to become Chief Justice of the United States. After the nomination of Samuel Alito to the U.S. Supreme Court, Fried praised Alito as an outstanding judge but dismissed claims that Alito is radical, saying, \\"He is conservative, yes, but he is not radically conservative like Scalia.\\"Fried, Charles; Morning Edition November 1, 2005, National Public Radio Fried testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee and wrote a New York Times op- ed in support of Alito, who had served under him in the Solicitor General's office. On October 24, 2008, despite his previous support for the presidential aspirations of Senator John McCain, Fried announced that he had voted for Senator Barack Obama for President by absentee ballot. Fried cited McCain's selection of Governor of Alaska Sarah Palin as his running mate as the principal reason for his decision to vote for Obama. As president of the Harvard Law Review in 1990, Obama had published an article Fried wrote criticizing the effects of race-based affirmative action. Fried later told The Wall Street Journal: > I admire Senator McCain and was glad to help in his campaign, and to be > listed as doing so; but when I concluded that I must vote for Obama for the > reason stated in my letter, I felt it wrong to appear to be recommending to > others a vote that I was not prepared to cast myself. So it was more of an > erasure than a public affirmation‚Äîalthough obviously my vote meant that I > thought that Obama was preferable to McCain-Palin. I do not consider > abstention a proper option. In February 2011, Fried testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee in support of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act. When asked by Illinois Senator Richard Durbin to respond to critics of the law's individual mandate who ask: \\"[I]f the government can require me to buy health insurance, can it require me to have a membership in a gym, or eat vegetables?,\\" Fried replied: > Yes. We hear that quite a lot. It was put by Judge Vinson, and I think it > was put by Professor Barnett in terms of eating your vegetables, and for > reasons I set out in my testimony, that would be a violation of the 5th and > the 14th Amendment, to force you to eat something. But to force you to pay > for something? I don't see why not. It may not be a good idea, but I don't > see why it's unconstitutional. Fried is an adviser to the Harvard chapter of the Federalist Society. Having supported John Huntsman for the Republican nomination in 2012 and John Kasich for the Republican nomination in 2016, Fried opposed the election of Donald Trump and voted for Hillary Clinton. He endorsed Joe Biden's presidential candidacy in 2020. Works * Because It Is Wrong: Torture, Privacy and Presidential Power in the Age of Terror, by Charles Fried and Gregory Fried (2010 W.W.

First planned in the mid-1990s and officially opened in 2005, the neighborhood's 138 acres (558,000 m¬≤) are located on the former brownfield site of the Atlantic Steel mill. History Atlantic Station is located on the site of the Atlantic Steel mill, which opened in 1901. The steel mill was nearly closed in the mid-1970s, but it remained nominally operational primarily to avoid the huge costs it would have required to remediate the soil contamination present after years of operation. Developer Jim Jacoby, who also redeveloped Florida's Marineland, began putting the project together in 1997 when his company became the property contractor of the land. The redevelopment of the land into what is now Atlantic Station was financed largely by private investment, but was heavily supplemented by a special tax district to pay for city tax bonds for public utilities (streets, sidewalks, and sewers). The development was originally planned to include of retail, office, residential space as well as of public parks. Its size encouraged the Postal Service to award the neighborhood its own ZIP code: 30363. Atlantic Steel Mill The project design was led by US architect, John Clark while working at Development Design Group Inc. (DDG), based in Baltimore. Atlantic Station was designed with energy efficiency in mind and many of the buildings are LEED certified. Additionally, the project was developed to help mitigate urban sprawl and reduce air pollution by allowing many more people to live and work within walking distance of most everyday things they need, with many alternative transportation options nearby. The proposed BeltLine transit/greenway project is expected to pass within a few miles of the development. In October 2003, the very first residents moved into the development. The 17th Street bridge was completed in January 2004 and the first round of retail establishments opened in October 2005. Atlantic Station received the EPA's 2004 Phoenix Award as the Best National Brownfield Redevelopment, as well as the Sierra Club's 2005 America's Best New Development Projects listing. In July 2005, a pre-dawn fire completely destroyed a large wood-frame residential building under construction. Two days later, it was ruled arson after a major investigation. In addition to the destruction of the 65-unit Element building, which was only framed-in at the time, another 80 inhabited units at the Art Foundry across Mecaslin Street had damage to the facade, including scorching, broken windows, and melted miniblinds. At least five million dollars of damage was done to the buildings, 18 cars parked on the street were destroyed and another 7 were seriously damaged from the intense heat. In a joint venture, North American Properties Atlanta, founded by Mark Toro, and CB Richard Ellis Investors closed on the purchase of Atlantic Station's retail component on December 31, 2010. Toro and the NAP management launched a social media blitz, attended community meetings and real estate symposiums to openly discuss challenges, such as crime, and invite feedback. Toro's vision to transform Atlantic Station included new retail, new restaurants, better parking and a renewed effort to make Atlantic Station a destination for in-town residents. On October 1, 2015, Atlantic Station's retail core was officially sold to Hines Interest Limited Partnership with an unnamed joint financial partner. Layout A smokestack from the original steel mill Atlantic Station comprises three distinct areas that are lined along 17th Street between the Downtown Connector and Northside Drive, the District, the Commons, and the Village. The District is where most of Atlantic Station's retail and office space is located. Opened on October 21, 2005, it was constructed in the style of an outdoor mall, with choices of shopping, dining, and a 16-screen Regal movie theater. Above the retail levels is an additional two to three stories of condominiums. With the 7,200-space parking garage underneath, the shopping area is pedestrian-friendly and many of the surface level streets are often closed off for special events. The southwest corner of The District is home to the 26-story, TWELVE Hotel and Residences Atlantic Station, which was completed in December 2005. In addition, townhomes constructed in 2004 line 16th Street one block south of The District. The District's office space is located along the six-lane 17th Street Corridor, and is home to the 22-story tall 171 17th Street, known as the Wells Fargo Building and completed in 2004, and the 17-story 201 17th Street, completed in 2007. Developed by AIG Global Real Estate, 171 17th Street was awarded the silver certificate in the U.S. Green Building Council's Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) Core and Shell Development program. 171 17th Street became the first-ever LEED Silver-Core and Shell certified high-rise office building, and the first high-rise office building in Georgia to receive any LEED certification. The 25-story BB&T; Tower at 271 17th Street was completed in 2009, becoming Atlantic Station's tallest office tower. 271 was designed by tvsdesign and built by Brasfield & Gorrie. The Commons is home to many low-rise condominiums, apartments, townhomes, and a large man-made stormwater retention pond that is located within the median of 17th Street. The Village is located on the westernmost portion of Atlantic Station, along 16th Street, and comprises an IKEA store that opened in 2005, as well as two apartment complexes. Retail Current tenants include Athleta, The Athlete's Foot, Atlanta Falcons Official Team Store, Atlanta United Official Team Store, AT&T;, Banana Republic, Bath & Body Works, Cellairis, Dermalogica, Dillard's, DSW, Earth and Sky Creations, Express, The Eye Gallery, Fab'rik, Francesca's, Gap, H&M;, Icing, Ikea, It'Sugar, Jos A. Bank, Journey's, Kate's, Kinnucan's, LA Fitness, Loft, Lush Nail Bar, Old Navy, Publix, Regal Cinemas, Target, Tervis, Victoria's Secret, West Elm, and Z Gallerie.

Attractions The Premier Exhibition Center at Atlantic Station is currently home to the exhibit Bodies: The Exhibition. Millennium Gate Millennium Gate Adjacent to the Commons pond is the Millennium Gate, an $18 million arch intended to celebrate peaceful accomplishment, with special attention paid to Georgia's rich history and people. The Millennium Gate opened July 4, 2008. As of 2008, it is the largest classical monument to have been dedicated since completion of the Jefferson Memorial in Washington, D.C.. Hugh Petter of ADAM Architecture was commissioned by the National Monuments Foundation to work alongside National Monuments director, Rodney Cook Jr., to develop the initial concepts into the final architectural design. The design is embellished with a sculptural allegory by Alexander Stoddart, telling the story of peaceful accomplishment over the last 2000 years. It houses of gallery space, featuring traditional and modern exhibits. Collections of artifacts and family histories contribute to exhibits showcasing the pioneering and philanthropic spirit behind the development of Atlanta. Other exhibits include a recreation of the 1928 Rhodes-Robinson House foyer located on West Paces Ferry Road and a recreation of Thomas K. Glenn's office. Mr. Glenn, the late chairman of Trust Company bank, in the 1930s ran Atlantic Steel, previous owner of the land that is now Atlantic Station. Glenn's family is among the project's supporters. The Millennium Gate has been greeted with puzzlement regarding its purpose, and it has been criticized by Modernists for its historic references. To this, New York sculptor George Kelly responds that \\"People are more drawn to tradition. It's the scale of it, it's the warmth of it. The word is beauty.\\" Because of its proximity to the IKEA furniture store, some observers have given it the nickname \\"Arc d‚ÄôIkea.\\"Patrik Jonsson, 'Arc d'Atlanta' ... or a new bit of kitsch?, The Christian Science Monitor, July 7, 2008Shaila Dewan, An Elaborate Arch, an Opaque Significance, The New York Times, April 30, 2009, page A16 of the New York edition. The Gate's exhibits are open to the public. The rooftop penthouse, Foyer gallery, and Oval Lawn are available for weddings, conferences, and other events by booking only. The Millennium Gate also serves as a museum, but is only open to the public by appointment. Transportation The primary roadway access to and through Atlantic Station is an extension of 17th Street constructed by the developers. As part of the project, the Georgia Department of Transportation erected the yellow 17th Street bridge over the I-75/85 Downtown Connector expressway that separated Atlantic Station and the Home Park residential neighborhood from the rest of Midtown. The courtyard of Atlantic Station's town center Controversy developed at the time of construction not only because of the bridge's unusual yellow color, but also for GDOT's insistence that the bridge and street meet suburban highway standards. Indeed, the bridge is eight lanes wide, and the enormous right-of- way afforded to 17th Street east of the bridge lacks street parking and utilizes an unusual arrangement of placing street trees and lamps at the edge of the adjacent buildings' property lines instead of against the street. Motorcycles are not allowed. The section of the Street west of the bridge consists of four through-lanes of traffic, in addition to a bus lane, bike lane, and turning lanes in each direction, also lacking street parking. Access to public transportation is provided via a free shuttle that runs every 5‚Äì15 minutes to the Arts Center MARTA rail station and MARTA bus route (110 Peachtree St./\\"The Peach\\" ), which also serves the Arts Center Station. A railroad line runs along the northern border, but passenger service on the Crescent (Amtrak) is available only at the Peachtree Station in Brookwood, one walking mile away. In April 2011, the city of Atlanta submitted a grant application seeking $22.5 million to relocate that station to the Atlantic Station community. Shuttle service is also provided by Lanier Parking Solutions, for Georgia Tech students in the student apartments, the Flats. Despite the pedestrian-friendly arrangement of much of the eastern section of the project, parking is inexpensive (first two hours of deck parking is free) and easily available in underground parking decks; indeed most visitors arrive by car.

He set up his own workshop in the Sixties. He is well known for his book Cabinetmaking - a professional approach (re-published in 2009) and his revision (for the fourth edition) of Ernest Joyce's The Technique of Furniture Making. In 1990 he was awarded the OBE for his services to furniture and in 1998 he moved to Minehead in West Somerset. He was a main exponent of the seventies British Craft Revival. His work is rooted in tradition and shows a deep understanding and respect for his material wood. In 2009 fellow furniture designer maker Jeremy Broun made a film and wrote a book called \\"Alan Peters - The Makers' Maker\\". To a generation of British woodworkers in the seventies and eighties he is considered to be the greatest British furniture designer maker. He died on 11 October 2009 aged 76. He is known for his particularly elegant furniture work, such as an adzed, fan-like table and a tabletop with a bowl carved into it. Although his work was influenced by Japanese woodworking, he rejected Japanese tools after experimenting with them. He is famed among other woodworkers and furniture makers for his use of the No. 7 plane - a particularly large and heavy one - for nearly everything. Since 2010 The Alan Peters Award for Excellence has been run as an annual award, established by Jason Heap, a designer maker and director of The Celebration of Craftsmanship and Design exhibitions. The award open to furniture makers under 30 years of age was set up to continue the important legacy of Alan Peters.

Biography Berendt grew up in Syracuse, New York, where both of his parents were writers. As an English major at Harvard University, he worked on the staff of the Harvard Lampoon. He graduated in 1961 and moved to New York City to pursue a journalism career. He was an associate editor of Esquire from 1961 to 1969, editor of New York magazine from 1977 to 1979 and a columnist for Esquire from 1982 to 1994. Berendt published Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil in 1994 and became an overnight success; the book spent a record- breaking 216 weeks on the New York Times bestseller list ‚Äî still, to this day, the longest standing best seller of the Times. The story, unsettling and real, broke down the idea of the quintessential phenomenon of a true American city‚Äîonly to reveal its quirks: its man walking an invisible dog; its voice of the drag queen; a high-society man in its elite community‚Äîall that somehow, unravels a murder mystery. Virtually seeming like a novel and reading like a tale, the non-fictional story is about the real-life events surrounding the murder trial of Jim Williams in Savannah, Georgia. Berendt acknowledged that he fabricated some scenes and changed the sequence of some events. The book was adapted into a 1997 film directed by Clint Eastwood. John Cusack plays a character loosely based on Berendt. Berendt's second book, The City of Falling Angels, was published in September 2005.Penguin Reading Guides, The City of Falling Angels. It chronicles interwoven lives in Venice in the aftermath of the fire that destroyed the La Fenice opera house.

The original album features just three tracks, including the side-long suite \\"A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers\\". The album was not commercially successful in the UK, but reached number one in Italy. It has since seen retrospective critical praise and was reissued on CD in 2005 with extra material. The songs for the album were worked out while on tour in 1971, with further development and arranging at manager Tony Stratton-Smith's house in Crowborough, Sussex over a two-month period. The original plan had been to release more material, making up a double album, but Charisma vetoed the idea. A non-album single, \\"Theme One\\" was included on some releases in the US and Canada. The album's strong commercial showing in Italy resulted in a number of lucrative promotional tours there, but the resulting pressure led to the band's split in August 1972.  Background  By 1971, Van der Graaf Generator's line-up had stabilised as frontman and songwriter Peter Hammill, saxophonist David Jackson, organist and bassist Hugh Banton and drummer Guy Evans. The group had been gigging extensively and became close friends after a particularly gruelling tour of Germany. Hammill wrote \\"A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers\\" during the tour, and the group began performing \\"Man-Erg\\" towards its end. To alleviate the tedium of touring, the group invented games including \\"Crowborough Tennis\\" which involved bouncing a ball off a table, a photograph of which was eventually used as the inner sleeve for the album. Following the tour and in preparation for the album, Hammill invited producer John Anthony to his home, where Hammill played songs intended for the album unaccompanied on acoustic guitar and piano, allowing Anthony to take recording notes. \\"Man Erg\\" was written about the conflict between good and evil, represented as \\"angels\\" and \\"killers\\" in the song. \\"A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers\\" was inspired by Hammill's fascination with the sea, and the narrative is about a lighthouse keeper who keeps seeing people die offshore. He feels guilty about not being able to help, and the song's ending is left open, leaving the listener to decide if the keeper has committed suicide or rationalised events to live in peace. Banton was against putting \\"A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers\\" on the album, wanting more commercial material such as the previous album H to He, Who Am the Only One's \\"Killer\\", but after a band meeting he agreed to rehearse the song and worked out an arrangement. The group moved to manager Tony Stratton-Smith's house, Luxford House, Crowborough, Sussex for two months in summer 1971 to rehearse material. Recording Recording ran from July to September 1971 in Trident Studios. In addition to the band and Anthony, Robin Cable, David Hentschel and Ken Scott helped with engineering. The first tracks to be recorded were \\"Theme One\\", a cover of the George Martin composition used as the original closing theme to BBC Radio 1, and \\"W\\", which was ultimately left off the album. The music, particularly \\"A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers\\" was recorded in short sections between two and five minutes, which were later edited together. In addition to Hammill's original suite, Banton contributed the \\"Pictures/Lighthouse\\" section, an Olivier Messiaen-influenced organ piece, Evans wrote \\"Kosmos Tours\\" around a short piano riff, and Jackson wrote the music to the closing theme, \\"We Go Now\\". The piece was edited together by Banton and Anthony towards the end of the session. Banton used an effect called a \\"psychedelic razor\\", a customised tape recorder that could rewind and record simultaneously. The device appealed to the band's sense of humour. At one stage, every tape machine in the studio had to be used for mixing. The album was originally conceived as a double album similar to Pink Floyd's Ummagumma (1969). The first half was made up of the album as released, while the second was to be divided between personal projects and live-in-studio versions of older Van der Graaf Generator songs such as \\"Killer\\" and \\"Octopus\\". Evans contributed an avant-garde piece, \\"Angle of Incidents\\" which featured drums being recorded backwards and the sound of a fluorescent lighting tube being dropped down the studio's stairs. Jackson recorded \\"Ponker's Theme'\\", a short jazz piece, and a longer piece, \\"Archimedes Agnostic\\", with Latin lyrics written by Hammill. Charisma ultimately felt that the group should simply release a single album, and vetoed the live and solo recordings. The album's title came from a spoonerism by Jackson, who once said, \\"I'll go down to the studio and dub on some more porn harts\\", meaning \\"horn parts\\". The cover was designed by regular Charisma album artist Paul Whitehead, who was told by Hammill, \\"no matter if you're a king, a pauper or whatever ‚Äì you're a pawn\\" which led to a design containing the earth and a curtain. The inner gatefold picture was taken by Keith Morris and featured the band playing Crowborough Tennis while appearing to give Nazi salutes to each other, though Banton later said this was simply the band attempting to look ridiculous in the vein of Monty Python.  Release  The album was originally released in October 1971 on Charisma Records. In the US and Canada, the album was distributed via Buddah Records and contained \\"Theme One\\" as an extra track between \\"Lemmings\\" and \\"Man-Erg\\", which was done without the band's approval. In Europe, where Pawn Hearts only contained the three tracks, \\"Theme One\\" was released as a single in February 1972, with \\"W\\" as its B-side. When the Van der Graaf Generator catalogue was remastered for reissue in 2005, several of the tracks from the missing half of the album were found and added as bonus tracks. A live, in-studio version of \\"Squid/Octopus\\" was added to the H to He, Who Am the Only One reissue, while the Pawn Hearts reissue added \\"Angle of Incidents\\", \\"Ponker's Theme\\", and \\"Diminutions\\". The CD also contained the original mix of \\"Theme One\\", which is different to the one released as a single, and an earlier take of \\"W\\". \\"Theme One\\" was also released on the 2003 compilation CD The Best Prog Rock Album in the World... Ever.  Reception  The album was not commercially successful in the UK. A Record Mirror review said \\"I have to confess complete ignorance of precisely what Van der Graaf Generator are trying to achieve\\", though Melody Maker were more enthusiastic, saying \\"A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers\\" is one of the most fascinating and dramatic items I've ever heard\\". However, the album reached number one on the Italian album charts. Google Book Search. Retrieved on 10 June 2009 The group toured Italy to promote the album, where they were treated like superstars and surrounded by army vehicles and riot police. They followed this with a short European tour, during which they filmed a live version of \\"A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers\\" for Belgian television. The production took two hours to film as the band had not intended to perform the song live and had forgotten it. The resulting film shows Hammill singing the song while reading a lyric sheet. Regular tours of Europe followed over the next four months, but the strain of the workload became too much for the band, and they split up in August 1972. Retrospective reviews have been favourable. Q magazine called the album a \\"misunderstood masterpiece\\" while Mojo said it was \\"one of the most extraordinary albums of its era\\". Singer-songwriter Fish is a fan of the album, particularly of \\"A Plague of Lighthouse Keepers\\". Julian Cope has called the album \\"a masterpiece\\". Hammill has said, \\"although a fairly extreme musical statement, [the album] contains some of our most cohesive work\\". Though \\"Theme One\\" did not chart as a single in the UK, John Peel replaced Martin's original orchestral version with the group's before closing down Radio 1 each night. The BBC subsequently carried on using Van der Graaf Generator's version. Martin enjoyed the group's cover, calling it \\"a powerful recording that respected the original\\".

Murray considered missions to be \\"the chief end of the church\\".  Early life and education  Andrew Murray was the second child of Andrew Murray Sr. (1794‚Äì1866), a Dutch Reformed Church missionary sent from Scotland to South Africa. He was born in Graaff Reinet, South Africa. His mother, Maria Susanna Stegmann, was of French Huguenot and German Lutheran descent. Murray was sent to the University of Aberdeen in Scotland for his initial education, together with his elder brother, John. Both remained there until they obtained their master's degrees in 1845. From there, they both went to the University of Utrecht where they studied theology. The two brothers became members of Het R√©veil, a religious revival movement opposed to the rationalism which was in vogue in the Netherlands at that time. Both brothers were ordained by the Hague Committee of the Dutch Reformed Church on 9 May 1848 and returned to the Cape. Murray married Emma Rutherford in Cape Town, South Africa, on 2 July 1856. They had eight children together (four boys and four girls).  Residence in Utrecht In 1846 they lived in the Minrebroederstraat (number unknown). From 1847-1848 they lived at the Zadelstraat 39.  Religious work in South Africa  Murray pastored churches in Bloemfontein, Worcester, Cape Town and Wellington, all in South Africa. He was a champion of the South African Revival of 1860. In 1889, he was one of the founders of the South African General Mission (SAGM), along with Martha Osborn and Spencer Walton. After Martha Osborn married George Howe, they formed the South East Africa General Mission (SEAGM) in 1891. SAGM and SEAGM merged in 1894. Because its ministry had spread into other African countries, the mission's name was changed to Africa Evangelical Fellowship (AEF) in 1965. AEF joined with Serving In Mission (SIM) in 1998 and continues to this day. Through his writings, Murray was also a key \\"Inner Life\\" or \\"Higher Life\\" or Keswick leader, and his theology of faith healing and belief in the continuation of the apostolic gifts made him a significant forerunner of the Pentecostal movement. In 1894, Murray was visited by John McNeill and Rev. J Gelson Gregson, the ex-British Army Chaplain and Keswick convention speaker. Death Murray died on 18 January 1917, four months before his 89th birthday. He was so influenced by Johann Christoph Blumhardt's M√∂ttlingen revival that he included a portion of Friedrich Z√ºndel's biography at the end of With Christ in the School of Prayer.

Several thousand species are placed in this family, many of which are well known for being serious plant pests. They are also the family of insects containing most plant virus vectors (around 200 known) with the green peach aphid (Myzus persicae) being one of the most prevalent and indiscriminate carriers. Eggs of Cinara strobi on white pine Evolution Aphids originated in the late Cretaceous about (Mya), but the Aphidinae which comprises about half of the 4700 described species and genera of aphids alive today come from their most recent radiation which occurred in the late Tertiary less than 10 Mya.Von Dohlen CD, Moran NA (2000) Molecular data support a rapid radiation of aphids in the Cretaceous and multiple origins of host alternation. Biol J Linnean Soc 71: 689‚Äì717Von Dohlen CD, Rowe CA, Heie OE (2006) A test of morphological hypotheses for tribal and subtribal relationships of Aphidinae (Insecta: Hemiptera: Aphididae) using DNA sequences. Mol Phylo Evol 38: 316‚Äì329 Characteristics Members of the Aphididae are soft-bodied, pear-shaped insects called aphids, as are other members of the superfamily Aphidoidea. Most of them have a pair of little tubes, called cornicles, projecting dorsally from the posterior of their abdomens. The cornicles have been variously interpreted in the past, either as organs of excretion, or for the production of honeydew, but in fact their only confirmed function to date is that they produce fatty alarm pheromones when the insects are attacked by predators. When wings are present they occur only on particular morphs called \\"alates\\", and wingless morphs are said to be \\"apterous\\". The forewing (mesothoracic wing) of the alate in the Aphididae has four to six veins attached to a major vein-like structure that has been interpreted as the combined stems of all the other major wing veins. That structure ends in a stigma, a solid spot on the anterior margin of the forewing. The rear (metathoracic) wings have a similar scheme, but simpler in structure, with no stigma The rear wing however, does bear a hamulus, a small hook that, when in flight, engages the claval fold of the forewing, keeping the wing beats in synchrony. All aphids have very small eyes, sucking mouthparts in the form of a relatively long, segmented rostrum, and fairly long antennae. These insects are so small (a few millimeters in length), that winds can transport them for fairly long distances. They are often green, but might be red or brown, as well. They move quite slowly and cannot jump or hop. Aphids excrete a sugary liquid called honeydew, because the plant sap from which they feed contains excess carbohydrates relative to its low protein content. To satisfy their protein needs, they absorb large amounts of sap and excrete the excess carbohydrates. Honeydew is used as food by ants, honeybees, and many other insects. Classification There is considerable controversy in the classification of aphids, with conservative classifications recognizing as many as 24 subfamilies within a single family Aphididae (see taxobox), and others elevating various subfamilies to establish as many as 9 other families within Aphidoidea in addition to Aphididae.http://tolweb.org/Aphidoidea/11009 Tree of Life - Aphids] Selected speciesSee also *Wooly aphids - Subfamily: Eriosomatinae ReferencesExternal links * On the UF / IFAS Featured Creatures Web site: * Aphis gossypii, melon or cotton aphid * Aphis nerii, oleander aphid * Cerataphis brasiliensis, palm aphid * Hyadaphis coriandri, corianderaphid * Longistigma caryae, giant bark aphid * Myzus persicae, green peach aphid * Sarucallis kahawaluokalani, crapemyrtle aphid * Schizaphis graminum, greenbug * Shivaphis celti, an Asian woolly hackberry aphid * Sipha flava, yellow sugarcane aphid * Toxoptera citricida, brown citrus aphid Category:Aphids Category:Hemiptera families ","title":"Aphididae"},{"id":"1863583","text":"Le 1501 McGill College, also known as La Tour McGill, is a , 36-storey skyscraper in Downtown Montreal.

Bennett (August 12, 1918 ‚Äì July 2, 2015) was an American songwriter known for the songs he wrote with Sid Tepper, which spawned several hits for Elvis Presley. Between 1945 and 1970, Tepper and Bennett published over 300 songs. Biography Born as Israel Brodsky into an Eastern European immigrant family in Brooklyn, New York, as a young boy he befriended a newly arrived neighbor by the name of Sid Tepper. Their mutual interest in music led to a highly successful music collaboration that spanned more than twenty-five years. Bennett graduated from Thomas Jefferson High School in the East New York neighborhood in Brooklyn, then he studied music at City College of New York. Although blessed with a good singing voice he chose to pursue his lifelong interest in writing words and music. His career plans were interrupted by World War II, however, when he served with the United States Army Air Forces. After the war he joined ASCAP and worked as a staff writer for Mills Music Inc. (now EMI Mills Music Inc.) Partnered with Tepper, between 1945 and 1970 Bennett had close to three hundred musical compositions published. In 1948 they wrote \\"Red Roses for a Blue Lady\\". Actor-singer John Laurenz (1909‚Äì1958) first recorded the song for Mercury Records in 1948. The original 78rpm single was issued on Mercury 5201. On December 22, 1948 Guy Lombardo and His Royal Canadians recorded the song for Decca Records (#24549 A). Vocalist Vaughn Monroe had the best selling version of the song in 1949 for RCA Records. His version was a No.3 hit single. The song has been recorded by others such as Wayne Newton, Vic Dana, Eddy Arnold, Johnny Tillotson and Andy Williams. Bennett and Tepper scored big again in 1951 when Rosemary Clooney recorded their composition \\"Suzy Snowflake.\\" In 1955, their 1954 composition of \\"Naughty Lady of Shady Lane\\" was a top-10 hit for both Dean Martin and the Ames Brothers and the novelty song \\"Nuttin' for Christmas\\" by the Art Mooney band and singer Barry Gordon went to No. 6 on the music charts and was recorded by four other singers. In 1958, the popular singer and TV variety show host Perry Como had a top-10 hit with their \\"Kewpie Doll.\\" Other successful artists who recorded Bennett & Tepper songs include The Beatles (\\"Glad All Over\\" which appears on The Beatles At The BBC), Connie Francis, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Robert Goulet, Dinah Shore, Burl Ives, Eartha Kitt, Les Paul & Mary Ford, Frank Sinatra, Duke Ellington, Tennessee Ernie Ford, Marty Robbins, Jo Stafford, Wayne Newton, and Sarah Vaughan. While these songs were very important in the music world, they prospered significantly with the onset of rock and roll music. They wrote fifteen songs for British superstar Cliff Richard, including his biggest selling single ever, \\"The Young Ones\\" which was also used in Richard's 1961 motion picture of the same name and two decades later in the 1982‚Äì84 UK television series with the same title, The Young Ones. In 2002, Mr. Bennett was invited to England to meet Cliff Richard and sang \\"The Young Ones\\" with him before an audience of 12,000 people in Birmingham. Most significant in his career are the forty-two songs recorded by Elvis Presley. These songs, co-written with Tepper, appear on a number of Presley's music albums and film soundtracks. Their collaboration ended in the 1970s when Tepper suffered a heart attack and retired to Florida. Bennett remained active, and published the Choral Singer's Handbook which is still in print today. Fascinated by the desktop computer, he created a software program called PowerMacros for WordPerfect. In 2002 Bennett and Tepper were honored at ceremonies in Memphis, Tennessee by Lisa Marie Presley for their contribution to her father's success. They were also honored for having written almost half the album in Presley fans favorite, Blue Hawaii. Tepper died in April 2015, while Bennett died on July 2 of the same year in Queens, New York, at the age of 96. ReferencesExternal links * * Interview with Roy C.

Its author, Aleister Crowley, described it as \\"the Word of the Aeon, which signifieth The Great Work accomplished.\\" This is in reference to his belief that the writing of Liber Legis (another name for \\"The Book of the Law\\") heralded a new Aeon for mankind that was ruled by the god Ra-Hoor-Khuit (a form of Horus). Abrahadabra is, therefore, the \\"magical formula\\" of this new age. It is not to be confused with the Word of the Law of the Aeon, which is Thelema, meaning \\"Will\\". Description Crowley replaced the 'C' in \\"Abracadabra\\" with an 'H', which the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn in their Neophyte ritual linked with Breath and LifeHiero: Is there any peculiarity in these names? Hierus: They all commence with the letter 'H'. Hiero: Of what is this letter a symbol? Hierus: Of life; because this letter 'H' is our mode of representing the ancient Greek aspirate or breathing, and Breath is the evidence of Life. The Golden Dawn by Israel Regardie, p. 118. as well as with the god Horus.Golden Dawn links Horus with the letter 'H' on p. 345, and with the Hierus, p. 338, 352. Aleister Crowley had taken the place of Horus or the Hierus officer in the Golden Dawn's Neophyte ritual,\\"The Book of Results\\" as presented in The Equinox of the Gods, Chapter 6. which means that he personally gave the response explaining the meaning of the letter 'H'. Crowley explains in his essay \\"Gematria\\" that he changed the magick word to include 'H' because of qabalistic methods. He appears to say that this happened before his January 1901 meeting with Oscar Eckenstein, one of his teachers. At this meeting, Eckenstein ordered Crowley to put aside magick for the moment, and to practice meditation or concentration.Sutin, Do What Thou Wilt, p. 85. In \\"Gematria\\", Crowley says he took great interest in Abrahadabra, and its qabalistic number 418, at the time someone ordered him to \\"abandon the study of magic and the Qabalah\\". In the Book of Thoth, Crowley refers to Abrahadabra as a 'cypher' of the Great Work. The word \\"Abrahadabra\\" appears repeatedly in the 1904 invocation of Horus that preceded the writing of Liber Legis and led to the founding of Thelema.(The Equinox I(7), 1912) It also appears in a May 1901 diary that Crowley published in The Equinox.\\"THE TEMPLE OF SOLOMON THE KING. IV\\" in The Equinox I(4), 1910 The essay \\"Gematria\\" gives Hindu, Christian, and \\"Unsectarian\\" versions of the problem that Crowley intended this magick word to answer. He also gives a qabalistic equivalent for each phrasing, and a brief symbolic answer for each. The unsectarian version reads, \\"I am the finite square; I wish to be one with the infinite circle.\\" Its equivalent refers to \\"the Cross of Extension\\" and \\"the infinite Rose.\\" Crowley's numerological explanation of \\"ABRAHADABRA\\" focuses mainly on this last formulation and the answer to it. \\"Abrahadabra\\" is also referred to as the \\"Word of Double Power\\". More specifically, it represents the uniting of the Microcosm with the Macrocosm‚Äîrepresented by the pentagram and the hexagram, the rose and the cross, the circle and the square, the 5 and the 6 (etc.), as also called the attainment of the Knowledge and Conversation of one's Holy Guardian Angel. In Commentaries (1996), Crowley says that the word is a symbol of the \\"establishment of the pillar or phallus of the Macrocosm...in the void of the Microcosm.\\" Mystical interpretations=Gematria As with most things found in the mystical works of Aleister Crowley, the word \\"Abrahadabra\\" can be examined using the qabalistic method of gematria, which is a form of numerology, whereby correspondences are made based on numerical values. *ABRAHADABRA = 418 *ABRAHADABRA has 11 letters *ABRAHADABRA = 1+2+2+1+5+1+4+1+2+2+1 = 22 *The five letters in the word are: A, the Crown; B, the Wand; D, the Cup; H, the Sword; R, the Rosy Cross; and refer further to Amoun the Father, Thoth His messenger, and Isis, Horus, Osiris, the divine- human triad. *Also 418 = ATh IAV, the Essence of IAO, translated from Hebrew as ‚ÄúThou art IAO‚Äù *418 = BVLShKIN, or Boleskine *418 = RA HVVR, or Ra Hoor *418 = , a Hebrew spelling of Heru-Ra-Ha *418 = , a Greek spelling of Aiwass *418 = The sum of all integers between 13 and 31 inclusive. *Abrahadabra is from Abrasax, Father Sun, which = 365 * 418 = 22 x 19 Manifestation Other interpretations Where AbraCadabra means ‚ÄúI create as I speak‚Äù, abraHaDabra, roughly speaking, means ‚ÄúI create the speech‚Äù, in Aramaic. *Had is the keyword of Abrahadabra. Had is another name for Hadit, the second Speaker in Liber Legis (\\"The Book of the Law\\"). *\\"ABRAHADABRA is \\"The key of the rituals\\" because it expresses the Magical Formulae of uniting various complementary ideas; especially the Five of the Microcosm with the Six of the Macrocosm.\\" * \\"Abrahadabra is the glyph of the blending of the 5 and the 6, the Rose and the Cross.\\" Quotes from Liber Legis *\\"Abrahadabra; the reward of Ra Hoor Khut.\\" (AL III:1) *\\"This book shall be translated into all tongues: but always with the original in the writing of the Beast; for in the chance shape of the letters and their position to one another: in these are mysteries that no Beast shall divine.

Prime Minister Stephen Harper in December 2008 until his aging out of the Canadian Senate upon his 75th birthday on November 6, 2019. Before his appointment to the Senate, he was a British Columbia Liberal Party Member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia from 1991 to 2008, serving as Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources in the cabinet of Gordon Campbell. Neufeld was first elected to the legislative assembly in the 1991 B.C. general election. He won the Peace River North riding as a member of the Social Credit party.British Columbia Votes 2009: Peace River North. cbc.ca. He received 5,758 votes (54.79% of total valid votes) in a field of five candidates. Neufeld defected to the BC Reform Party following the electoral collapse of the SoCreds. In the 1996 BC general election Neufeld was re-elected in the Peace River North riding as a member of the BC Reform party. He received 5,299 votes (48.41% of total valid votes) in a field of six candidates. He was one of two BC Reform candidates to be elected, the other being party leader Jack Weisgerber‚Äìthereby losing official party status. BC Reform's presence was blamed for splitting the centre-right vote, allowing the NDP to eke out a majority despite coming second in the popular vote behind the Liberals. Following a conflict with then BC Reform leader Wilf Hanni, Neufeld defected to the BC Liberals in October 1997. During this time in the Official Opposition he served as energy, mines and northern development critic. In the 2001 general election Neufeld was again re-elected in the Peace River North riding as the BC Liberal candidate. He received 6,629 votes (73.22% of total valid votes) in a field of four candidates. Neufeld was appointed Minister of Energy and Mines on June 5, 2001 by Premier Gordon Campbell. In his position as Minister, Neufeld was at the centre of the fray regarding the \\"re-regulation\\" of BC Hydro, which involves privatization of some of that Crown corporation. Neufeld has also advocated the increased use of coal power, and has promoted allowing a scientific review of offshore oil and gas. His term as Minister of Energy and Mines was marked by significant growth in the oil and gas, and mining sectors. In the 2005 general election Neufeld was again re-elected in the Peace River North riding as the BC Liberal candidate. He received 5,498 votes (59.37% of total valid votes) in a field of four candidates. Neufeld was re-appointed Minister of Energy, Mines and Petroleum Resources on June 16, 2005 by Premier Gordon Campbell. Neufeld served on the Fort Nelson city council from 1978 to 1986, five of those years as mayor. He lives in Fort St. John. On December 22, 2008, it was announced that Neufeld would be appointed to the Canadian Senate on the advice of Prime Minister Stephen Harper. He assumed office on January 2, 2009. Upon reaching his age 75, on November 6, 2019, Neufeld was aged out of the Canadian Senate per constitutionally-enshrined mandatory retirement rules.

It was released in 1970 on Charisma Records. The band recorded the album in several stages throughout mid-1970 in Trident Studios with producer John Anthony. The songs mentioned a killer shark in \\"Killer\\", lost love in \\"Lost\\" and science fiction material in \\"Pioneers Over c\\". Bassist Nic Potter left the group in August partway through recording, with organist Hugh Banton covering on bass guitar in the studio and playing bass pedals in concert. King Crimson's Robert Fripp made a guest appearance on guitar, and the cover was the first of several by the band to feature the artwork of Paul Whitehead. The album did not chart in the UK, and contemporary reviews were mixed, but it has since been regarded as a good example of progressive rock albums by critics. \\"Killer\\" has been singled out for praise as a fan favourite.  Background  The group's previous album, The Least We Can Do Is Wave to Each Other (February 1970) had achieved a small amount of commercial success and critical acclaim in the UK and Europe. The next project the group attempted was recording the soundtrack to the 1970 film Eyewitness, but it was rejected, largely for being too sinister. They started to develop a live following during 1970, counting film director Anthony Minghella as one of their fans, but things backfired after a show at the Royal Festival Hall in June that drew negative reviews from Melody Makers Chris Welch. Around this time, the band decided to write some new material for a follow-up album. The first song to be attempted was \\"Killer\\", which came out of a rehearsal that attempted to join fragments of songs together in a deliberate attempt to create something that would be commercially successful. The track was a composite of a basic song structure written by group leader Peter Hammill in 1968, an old song written by founding member Judge Smith called \\"A Cloud as Big as a Man's Hand\\", and a rock riff composed by organist Hugh Banton that he later said was influenced by The Move's \\"Brontosaurus\\". The lyrics referred to a shark in the ocean, who becomes lonely through killing everything. \\"Killer\\" quickly became a live favourite with fans, and the group's signature track. Hammill wrote \\"The Emperor in His War Room\\" about a tyrant who tortures people indiscriminately but is ultimately haunted by those he has tormented. The music joined together two different sections, a sombre opening and closing combined with a bass-driven rock section in the middle. \\"Lost\\" was, uncharacteristically for the band, a straightforward song about lost love and the group added several different instrumental sections into the basic structure. \\"Pioneers Over c\\" was co-written by Hammill and saxophonist David Jackson. The song had a strong science fiction element and was about a group of astronauts who managed to travel faster than the speed of light (hence the \\"c\\" in the title). As a result, they go into a time warp, experiencing a \\"living death\\" where time passes in a nonlinear fashion, and are unable to return to Earth. The whole band helped with the arrangement, coming up with musical themes to match the lyrical theme of isolation and fear. The last track to be written for the album was \\"House with No Door\\". Hammill wrote the song on piano, which was about someone who had difficulty forming friendships and was unable to have meaningful contact with other people. The song is one of several by Hammill to use a house as a metaphor, which would be revisited in subsequent solo work.  Recording  As with previous Van der Graaf Generator albums, the band collaborated with producer John Anthony at Trident Studios, who had established a good working relationship with the band. However, recording for H to He was sporadic, and occurred intermittently between gigs throughout 1970. Hammill wanted King Crimson's guitarist and bandleader Robert Fripp to play on \\"The Emperor In His War Room\\". Fripp had never played as a session musician at that point, but had enjoyed listening to The Least We Can Do ... and was persuaded to take part by Anthony. Jackson recalled that Fripp \\"set up all of his stuff, put his headphones on, and started searing away.\\" Fripp played the guitar part twice, having never heard the track before, and a composite of both takes appears on the final recording. Fripp has subsequently introduced Anthony as \\"the guy who gave me my first session\\" at events. Fripp would collaborate again with Van der Graaf Generator on their next album, Pawn Hearts, released the following year. The group took a break from recording to play several festivals throughout the summer of 1970. In July, they played at the Munich and Aachen Festivals with Deep Purple, Pink Floyd, Black Sabbath and Fairport Convention. In August, the group played a show as part of BBC Radio 1's \\"In Concert\\" series, which included \\"Killer\\", and performed at the 10th National Jazz and Blues Festival at Plumpton on 9 August. Immediately after the show, bassist Nic Potter quit the band, before the album was completed (he played on the already recorded tracks \\"Killer\\", \\"The Emperor in His War Room\\" and \\"Lost\\"). The group quickly auditioned Dave Anderson, roadie for Brinsley Schwarz who knew Van der Graaf Generator socially, but the group struggled during rehearsals to form a cohesive sound. As an alternative, Banton, who had a background in classical and church organ music, suggested he could simply play all the bass parts on bass pedals instead, purchasing a Hammond organ to augment his existing Farfisa. Anderson was retained as a roadie. To further expand the sound, Jackson started working with electric saxophones, playing them through effects boxes including a wah-wah. Banton decided to play bass guitar as well as organ for the remaining studio sessions, being familiar with the instrument. \\"Pioneers Over c\\" was recorded in sections in the studio, then edited together, making it impossible to perform live in concert. Banton used an oscillator as a musical device to complement that track's lyrical theme. By contrast, \\"House with No Door\\" was mostly put down live. The group found the sessions enjoyable despite some of the downbeat themes present on the album, and all found fun in some of the esoteric sounds they were creating. To promote the album, the band went on Charisma's \\"Six Bob Tour\\" with Genesis and Lindisfarne. As Van der Graaf Generator had been signed to Charisma the longest, they were the headline act.  Artwork  The cover was drawn by Paul Whitehead, and was inspired by \\"Pioneers Over c\\". The front cover was a painting he had already completed, called \\"Birthday\\", which showed a beam of light focusing on London, illustrating Whitehead's birth. The inner gatefold picture was called \\"Checkmate\\". \\"H to He\\" in the title refers to the fusion of hydrogen nuclei to form helium nuclei, a basic exothermic reaction between the sun and stars. The first U.S. issue of the album was on the Dunhill Records division of ABC Records. It featured a revised cover with a white background instead of purple. The mid-priced \\"Charisma Classics\\" re-issue from the early 1980s had a blue cover. A re-mastered version of this album added bonus tracks and was released in 2005. One of the additions is a studio version of \\"Squid / Octopus\\", a song that had been a staple of early Van der Graaf Generator concerts. Whitehead would go on to draw several other covers for the band, and for other Charisma artists, including Genesis. He became something of a \\"house artist\\" for the label in the early 1970s.  Reception  The album was released in December 1970, but did not sell as well as The Least We Can Do, and did not reach the album charts in the UK. Charisma hoped the group could produce another single like \\"Refugees\\", released earlier in the year. There was some interest in releasing \\"Killer\\" as a single, but the band rejected this as they might have been pigeonholed as a hard rock band. The group felt there was some conflict of interest by having Tony Stratton-Smith both as manager and record company owner. Contemporary reviews of the album were mainly positive to mixed. Melody Maker praised \\"the brilliance of the songs\\", Sounds enjoyed Jackson's sax playing, and Record Mirror thought the band would be \\"one of the groups most likely to succeed in 1971\\". Disc & Music Echo were less favourable, complaining that the group's sound was \\"distinctive but somehow mainly boring\\". Retrospective reviews have been positive. In 2000, Q Magazine listed the album as one of the best progressive rock albums of all time, saying \\"texturally, they were unmistakable. No guitars, just thick dark layers of organ and saxophone.\\" AllMusic's Mike DeGagne rated the album 4 out of 5, noting that \\"the brooding tones of synthesizer and oscillator along with Peter Hammill's distinct and overly ominous voice make it one of this British band's best efforts.\\" Iron Maiden's Bruce Dickinson and Blur's Graham Coxon have both spoken favourably about the album.

He had by then hurriedly published an \\"abstract\\" of this work as On the Origin of Species in 1859, and following the immediate reaction to Darwin's theory his earlier work included demonstrating the utility of the flowers of Orchids in directing insect pollination to achieve cross fertilisation, and a summing up of thirteen years of experiments in The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication which went on sale on 30 January 1868. He now published his ideas on human evolution and on how beautiful but apparently impractical features could have evolved in The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex. After revising The Origin of Species as the definitive 6th edition, his major works on species culminated in The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals. This period was followed by extensive work on insectivorous plants and research into worms.  Family and research  Despite Darwin's concerns that his children were weakened as his wife Emma Darwin was his cousin or had inherited his own illness, around early 1868 his sons had successes with William Darwin doing well as a bank manager, Leonard Darwin coming second in the entrance exam for the Royal Military Academy and George coming runner-up in his mathematics degree class at the University of Cambridge, getting offered a science mastership at Eton College but choosing to make his career in law.  Sexual selection  Darwin turned his attention to sexual selection, writing to scientist friends for information. He got commercial breeders to experiment with altering the appearance of their stock and recording the subject's sexual prowess. He thought that exotic creatures like hummingbirds and peacocks owed their appearance, not to divine design to please man, but to the cumulative effect of the female preferring minute differences in choosing a mate, writing that \\"A girl sees a handsome man, and without observing whether his nose or whiskers are the tenth of an inch longer or shorter than in some other man, admires his appearance and says she will marry him. So, I suppose, with the pea-hen.\\" To meet a lack of books supporting the Origin on natural selection, Darwin arranged with John Murray to publish a translation of F√ºr Darwin, written by Fritz M√ºller exiled in Brazil. Darwin provided ¬£100 subsidy and arranged the translator, and Facts and Arguments for Darwin. sold well. In the spring of 1868 Darwin got information on newts from St George Mivart, a brilliant anatomist and one of Huxley's prot√©g√©s who had dropped law for zoology after hearing Owen lecture. He assured Darwin that \\"As to \\"natural selection\\" I accepted it completely\\" but added that he had \\"doubts & difficulties.. first excited by attending Prof. Huxley's lectures\\".  Descent of Man  The book The Reign of Law by the Duke of Argyll argued that beauty with no obvious utility, such as exotic birds' plumage, proved divine design. Darwin had to show how this was explained by his theory of sexual selection, and was now working to include this with ape ancestry and evolution of morality and religion in a new book which he now decided to call The Descent of Man.  Sources  Darwin found many ideas in the quality magazines. Wallace argued that group co-operation increased fitness for survival. Darwin's cousin Francis Galton wrote Hereditary Talent and Character for Macmillan's Magazine emphasising the inheritance of traits, and their extension to races and classes, and calling for better breeding to ensure that the \\"nobler varieties of mankind\\" prevailed, with civilisation being saved from \\"intellectual anarchy\\" by scientific \\"master minds\\" rising to power. These views were shared by Darwin's old friend W. R. Greg whose Fraser's Magazine article about natural selection in society raised fears of the \\"unfit\\" and of the prudent middle classes being out-bred by the idle rich and the feckless poor. These ideas raised a dilemma, of evolution working against progress. Darwin found help in Walter Bagehot's essays on Physics and Politics in the Fortnightly Review which argued that progress depended on the command structure of society. Civilisation came from obedience, respect for law and a \\"military bond\\". Through tribal and imperial battles new racial and national types would emerge, selected as \\"The characters which do win in war are the characters which we should wish to win in war\\". Darwin added his comment \\"nations which wander & cross would be most likely to vary\\" in the face of wider competition, and commended to Hooker Bagehot's analysis of \\"prehistoric politics\\".  British Association  Julia Margaret Cameron's 1868 portrait shows the beard Darwin began growing during illness in July 1862, which became so bushy that he had to reintroduce himself to friends in April 1866. Hooker became the first Darwinian to become president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. While Hooker was working on his initial address, Darwin with his wife Emma and daughter Henrietta went on holiday to the Isle of Wight on 16 July 1868, and rented a cottage from the photographer Julia Margaret Cameron who took Darwin's portrait. Hooker joined them and the Irish poet William Allingham described \\"Dr. Hooker in lower room writing away at his Address... Upstairs Mrs. Darwin, Miss D. and Mr. Charles Darwin himself‚Äì, yellow, sickly, very quiet. He has his meals at his own times, sees people or not as he chooses, has invalid's privileges in full, a great help to a studious man.\\" Hooker's address to the Norwich British Association was a great success for the X Club (a dining club formed in November 1864 to support the evolutionary \\"new reformation\\" in naturalism, including Huxley, Hooker, John Tyndall, Busk, Spencer, and Spottiswoode). Darwin arrived home on 21 August with a clutch of the day's newspapers carrying the address and editorial comments. The Guardian said Darwinism's \\"reign was triumphant\\", and it was generally said that the disciples were \\"ready to push their consequences more fearlessly than the master himself\\". Darwin enjoyed John Tyndall's lecture in which the physicist widened the application of his theory. Ernst Haeckel's Darwinismus was even more universal, incorporating life, mind, society, politics and knowledge itself, though Darwin had struggled with reading his book and his efforts to get it translated were thwarted as the book proved too controversial. Haeckel, the \\"indomitable worker\\", quickly produced his History of Creation. An impressed Huxley adopted Haeckel's approach, and did what he had told Darwin was impossible and wrong, drawing up a genealogical tree for the ancestry of partridges and pigeons which traced them back to the dinosaurs. Huxley also arranged audiences for Germans arriving to pay their \\"devotions at the shrine of Mr. Darwin\\". That autumn, the botanist Asa Gray came to England with his wife for a long rest from \\"drudgery\\" at Harvard. He spent the time with Hooker at Kew, visiting the Darwins at weekends. There were many other visitors at this time, including Gray's friend Charles Eliot Norton who brought his wife and her sister Sara Sedgwick, who caught William Darwin's eye. Gray was theologically uncomfortable with the implications of Variation, and returned home wanting to avoid further \\"Darwinian discussions\\" or become \\"mixed up\\" with the Huxley set.  Parish affairs  Ever since moving to Downe, Darwin had supported the parish church's work and had been a friend of the Revd. John Innes since he had taken over in 1846. Darwin continued to help, though he stopped attending church after his daughter Annie died in 1851. By 1864 Innes had retired to a property he had inherited in the Scottish Highlands, changing his name to Brodie Innes and leaving the parish in the dubious hands of his curate, the Revd. Stevens, while still remaining the patron. The meagre \\"living\\" and lack of a vicarage made it hard to attract a priest of quality. Innes made Darwin treasurer of Downe village school and they continued to correspond, with Innes seeking help and advice on parish matters. The Revd. Stevens proved lax, and departed in 1867. His successors were worse, one absconding with the school's funds after Darwin mistakenly shared the treasurer's duties with him. The next was rumoured to have disgraced himself by \\"walking with girls at night\\". Darwin now became involved in helping Innes with detective work, subsequently advising him that the gossip that had reached Innes was not backed up by any reliable evidence.  Thomson and Mivart  Concerned about Thomson's calculations giving a young age for the earth, Darwin asked his mathematical son George to check the figures, disbelieving the \\"brevity of the world... else my views would be wrong, which is impossible ‚Äì Q.E.D.\\". Darwin modified the 5th edition of the Origin, speeding up the process of variation and reviving the Lamarckian \\"useful inheritance\\" notion. In February 1869 Huxley at the Geological Society argued that '\\" Biology takes her time from geology...[even] if the geological clock is wrong, all the naturalist will have to do is to modify his notions of the rapidity of change accordingly\\". Huxley was charged with heresy after giving a Sunday \\"lay sermon\\" in Edinburgh \\"on the physical basis of life\\". In April the \\"Metaphysical Society\\", a group of liberal churchmen of all denominations and even atheists, attempted to reach a consensus and Huxley coined a new label for his position ‚Äì agnostic. Wallace was now arguing that human brains were an over-endowment created by \\"spiritual forces\\" rather than natural selection, leading Darwin to write \\"I differ grievously from you, and I am very sorry for it\\". Mivart gained his Fellowship of the Royal Society on 3 June with Huxley's help, then surprised him by announcing that he was going to publish his objections to Darwinian views of human nature and morality. Mivart placed anonymous articles criticising natural selection in the Catholic Month. The Duke of Argyll published his Primeval Man arguing that man could not rise unaided from \\"utter barbarism\\", and that \\"savages\\" were degenerates forced out by fitter races. Argyll claimed that \\"Man must have had the human proportions of mind before he could afford to lose bestial proportions of body\\", contrasting a gorilla with an elder of the British Association, but Darwin noted that without remains of ancestors there was no evidence for this, and that man's vulnerability would have encouraged social cohesion and moral sense. Darwin sought to trump Frances Power Cobbe by writing in the Descent of Man that though women tended to be more intuitive, this was shared by less advanced peoples.  Holiday in Wales  On 10 June \\"his ladies\\" took Darwin away on holiday to Caerdon in the Barmouth valley, but he was depressed to be barely able to walk half a mile. On one walk the feminist Frances Power Cobbe caught up with him and tried to persuade him that John Stuart Mill's book The Subjection of Women was an ideal source for his study of man's origins and sexual selection. When Darwin, who had read Cobbe's review of Mill, answered that Mill '\\"could learn some things\\" from biology, and that the \\"struggle for existence\\" produced man's special \\"vigour and courage\\" from battling \\"for the possession of women\\", she offered him a copy of Kant on the \\"moral sense\\" to sort out his ethical problems, but he declined. He did ask his son William to read Mill and tell him what to think. On 16 July, Darwin started to work out a strategy to \\"trump\\" Cobbe, and wrote down his notes that men were superior to women because they had been \\"defending the tribe & hunting\\" for many generations and that Mill didn't think of sexual selection. When he returned home, Darwin added his notes to Descent, commenting that women seemed to show \\"greater tenderness and less selfishness\\", suggesting that this came from maternal instincts in contrast to male competitiveness. He wrote that \\"It is generally admitted that with woman the powers of intuition, of rapid perception, and perhaps of imitation, are more strongly marked than in man; but some, at least, of these faculties are characteristic of the lower races, and therefore of a past and lower state of civilisation.\\" His views supported Victorian stereotypes. In November the founding of Nature gave the X Club an outlet for their views. As well as Hooker and Huxley, it featured Darwin's cousin Francis Galton.  Editing and translation  Darwin continued to slog away at the Descent of Man, feeling \\"as dull as a duck\\". He dreaded publication, telling Mivart that \\"I can see that I shall meet with universal disapprobation, if not execution\\". As he wrote, he posted chapters to his daughter Henrietta at Cannes, for editing to ensure that damaging inferences could not be drawn. He thought he was getting rather evangelical, writing \\"Who would ever have thought I should turn parson!\\" Emma also advised, writing that the treatment of morals and religion might be \\"very interesting\\", but she would still \\"dislike it very much as again putting God further off\\". They took a break in mid May 1870 along with Henrietta and Bessy to visit Cambridge where Horace had started and Frank was graduating with a good mathematics degree. Charles was haunted by the absence of \\"Dear Henslow\\", but on the last day met Sedgwick who was overjoyed to see him with his \\"dear family party\\". They had a long chat, with Sedgwick not mentioning the Origin, possibly from tact though Darwin thought his brain \\"enfeebled\\". Late in the day Sedgwick insisted on showing Charles round his new geological museum, by the end of which Darwin was \\"utterly prostrated\\". As Darwin on struggled to get to the train the next day he remarked on the humiliation of being \\"thus killed by a man of eighty-six, who evidently never dreamed that he was thus killing me?\\". The South American Missionary Society had converted and clothed the natives of Tierra del Fuego that Darwin thought were untameable, and after Bartholomew Sulivan sent a photograph of Jemmy Button's son as evidence, Darwin made donations for several years. Darwin was proud to become an honorary member, but warned Sulivan that he would shortly publish \\"another book partly on man, which I dare say many will decry as very wicked\\". Darwin's neighbour Lubbock had been elected Member of Parliament for Maidstone in February 1870 and Darwin lobbied him to get a question added to the census to find if married cousins had as many surviving children as unrelated parents, but when it came up in July, Lubbock's amendment caused furious debate and was heavily defeated. As the Franco-Prussian war got under way, Darwin pressed on to finish the manuscript while worrying about how it would affect his German allies. When the French surrendered at Sedan in November he wrote that \\"I have not met a soul in England who does not rejoice in the splendid triumph of Germany over France... It is a most just retribution against that vainglorious, war-liking nation.\\" An \\"ailing and grumbling\\" Darwin worked on with his corrections, and the proofs were sent off on 15 January 1871 with him doubting that the book was \\"worth publishing\\". He promptly started on his next book, using left over material on emotional expressions.  Mivart's Genesis  Within a week Mivart had published On the Genesis of Species, the cleverest and most devastating critique of natural selection in Darwin's lifetime. Mivart wrote expressing \\"sympathy and esteem\\" for Darwin, blaming \\"irreligious deductions\\" on overzealous supporters and adding \\"God grant that we in England may not be approaching a religious decay at all similar to that of the middle of the 18th century in France which Frenchmen are now paying for in blood & tears!\\" As Paris suffered under siege, Darwin sent out review copies of his book, expecting a backlash. Just at this point parish affairs intruded. The Revd. Henry Powell had now taken over, but the two previous curates got together to sue Darwin for defamatory remarks about the first absconding with the school's cash. Darwin wrote to Brodie Innes that \\"being examined in court could half- kill me, but was assured that the case would never come to court.  Publication  A caricature in The Hornet satirical magazine dated 22 March 1871 was typical of many portraying Darwin with an ape body, identifying him in popular culture as the leading author of evolutionary theory and helping to identify all forms of evolutionism with Darwinism. The two 450-page volumes of The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex went on sale at twenty- four shillings, with a publication date of 24 February 1871. Within three weeks a reprint had been ordered, and 4,500 copies were in print by the end of March 1871, netting Darwin almost ¬£1,500. Darwin's name created demand for the book, but the ideas were old news. \\"Everybody is talking about it without being shocked\\" which he found \\"proof of the increasing liberality of England\\". To critics, the book was \\"raising a storm of mingled wrath, wonder and admiration\\", though they denied that \\"spiritual powers\\" had evolved from brutes in case earnest men gave up \\"those motives by which they have attempted to live noble and virtuous lives\\". The Prussians had been defeated, but 26 March an insurrection led by socialists and republicans took over Paris and set up the Paris Commune, which was then besieged by French troops. The Times condemned the Communards, and accused Darwin of undermining authority and principles of morality, opening the way to \\"the most murderous revolutions\\". A \\"man incurs a grave responsibility when, with the authority of a well-earned reputation, he advances at such a time the disintegrating speculations of this book.\\" Darwin was able to shrug this off as from a \\"windbag full of metaphysics and classics\\". When his Tory friend Brodie Innes taunted him that God's scheme, before being thwarted by interfering radicals, was that \\"Man was made a man..[split] into niggers who must be made to work [and] better men able to make them\\", Darwin responded that \\"I consider myself a good way ahead of you, as far as this goes.\\" He dismissed the objections raised in Wallace's review in the Academy as \\"almost stereotyped\\", but to his brother Erasmus Alvey Darwin the generous and polite exchanges formed a \\"perfectly beautiful\\" controversy, and thought that \\"In future histories of science the Wallace- Darwin episode will form one of the few bright points.\\"  6th Edition of the Origin  Mivart wrote wishing \\"with all my heart that we did not differ so widely\\", but challenging Darwin to debate the basic metaphysics underlying science, from his Roman Catholic position writing that \\"while combatting (as duty compels me to do) positions you adopt, I am not so much combatting you as others to whose view your scientific labours give additional currency.\\" Darwin took this personally, feeling that Mivart's Genesis of Species was \\"producing a great effect against Natural Selection, and more especially against me.\\" After completing a rough draft of Expressions in April 1871 he set it aside and turned to revising the Origin to meet Mivart's arguments and counter the claim that some divine inner force was driving evolution. Darwin told Murray of working men in Lancashire clubbing together to buy the 5th edition at fifteen shillings, and he wanted a new cheap edition to make it more widely available. In June Edward L. Youmans, over from the United States to seek authors for his International Scientific Series, told Darwin about lecturing on the Descent of Man to a \\"clerical club\\" in Brooklyn. Darwin burst out \\"What! Clergymen of different denominations all together? How they would fight if you should get them together here!\\" He was cheered by a damning analysis of Mivart's Genesis of Species by Chauncey Wright (one of Gray's students) for the North American Review, and thought of importing it, but Wallace thought it too heavy and obscure. Next Mivart's anonymous Quarterly Review article claimed that the Descent of Man would unsettle \\"our half educated classes\\" and talked of people doing as they pleased, breaking laws and customs. The author was obvious to a furious Darwin who thought \\"I shall soon be viewed as the most despicable of men\\". He wrote to ask Wright for permission to reprint his article as a pamphlet, then feeling \\"giddy and bad\\" was taken by Emma to recuperate at the nearby hamlet of Albury. His head remained \\"rocky and wretched\\" and for two months he suffered giddiness and inability to work. They returned for Henrietta's marriage after a whirlwind courtship to Richard Litchfield. She departed, leaving behind her fox terrier \\"Polly\\" who now became Darwin's dog. Murray sent out copies of Wright's pamphlet in September 1871. Only fourteen sold, but by then Huxley had already written a cutting review of Mivart's book and article. A relieved Darwin told him \\"How you do smash Mivart's theology... He may write his worst & he will never mortify me again\\". Hooker thought he surely would not be the happier for Mivart's humiliation, but an unrepentant Darwin responded that '\\"I am not so good a Christian as you think me, for I did enjoy my revenge\\". In December Darwin completed extensive revisions of the Origin, using the word \\"evolution\\" for the first time and adding a new chapter to refute Mivart's guided jumps, tackling the argument of uselessness of part-evolved organs with myriad examples of gradual development or organs changing function. As 1872 began, Mivart politely inflamed the argument again, writing \\"wishing you very sincerely a happy new year\\" while wanting a disclaimer of the \\"fundamental intellectual errors\\" in the Descent of Man. This time Darwin ended the correspondence.  The Index  Darwin reacted positively to a tract by the American Francis Abbott proposing \\"the extinction of faith in the Christian Confession\\" and a new humanist \\"Free Religion\\" for the \\"spiritual perfection of the individual and the spiritual unity of the race\\". He subscribed to Abbott's weekly The Index and allowed it to print his endorsement of the tract's \\"truths\\", \\"I admire them from my inmost heart & I agree to almost every word\\".  Publication  Darwin told Haeckel \\"I doubt whether my strength will last for much more serious work. I shall continue to work for as long as I can, but it does not much signify when I stop, as there are so many good men fully as capable, perhaps more capable than myself, of carrying on our work; and of these you rank as the first.\\" With \\"the little strength left in me\\" he reopened his enquiries into earthworms, requesting information from correspondents. The 6th edition of Origin of Species was published by Murray on 19 February 1872 at a price kept down to 7s. 6d. by using minute print, and sales increased from 60 to 250 a month.  Emotions  Through the spring Darwin pressed on with The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, pointing to shared evolution in contrast to Charles Bell's Anatomy and Physiology of Expression which claimed divinely created muscles to express man's exquisite feelings. Darwin drew on worldwide responses to his questionnaires, hundreds of photographs of actors, babies and \\"imbeciles\\" in an asylum, as well as his own observations, with particular empathy for the grief following a family death. The proofs, tackled by Henrietta and Leo, needed major revision which made him \\"sick of the subject, and myself, and the world\\". It was to be one of the first books with photographs, with seven heliotype plates, and Murray warned that this \\"would poke a terrible hole in the profits\\". In May 1872 Darwin became a foreign member of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences. Wallace wrote in August, enthusing about H. Charlton Bastian's The Beginnings of Life claiming the spontaneous generation of life, but Darwin told him that \\"I have taken up old botanical work, and have given up all theories\\". By the end of September he was again near collapse, but Emma arranged three weeks away to rest, which worked well though he was still \\"growing old and weak\\". Hooker's collections at Kew were threatened with government cuts under Acton Smee Ayrton. The X Club petitioned Gladstone. When Richard Owen was found to be involved, possibly trying to bring Kew under his British Museum, Darwin commented that \\"I used to be ashamed of hating him so much, but now I will carefully cherish my hatred & contempt to the last days of my life\\". In October Hooker sent sun-dews and Venus fly-traps for Darwin's experiments, then was devastated when his bedridden mother died. In his hot-house Darwin experimented, giving such plants from around the world a variety of foods and poisons, and began writing insectivorous Plants. The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals proved very popular, selling over 5,000 copies, but an exhausted Darwin became a \\"confirmed invalid\\" and at his brother Eramus's over Christmas 1872 sat drawing up his will.  New edition of The Descent of Man  Darwin recovered and pressed on with several projects. He subsequently tackled a new edition of the Descent of Man, incorporating ideas from Galton and new anecdotes. The manuscript was completed in April 1874, and the new edition was published on 13 November. Darwin continued his work following this period.

To many students, Stanton is known for its challenging academics and rigorous standards. Most Stanton students attend some form of college after graduation, whether four-year or two-year institutions, local, national, or international.Stanton College Preparatory School profile at cyberguidance.net In 2014, the Washington Post ranked the school as the 4th most challenging high school in the Southern United States.High School Challenge Washington Post 2014 History Edwin M. Stanton, namesake of the school Edwin M. Stanton School Shortly after the end of the Civil War, a group of African Americans from Jacksonville organized the Education Society, and, in 1868, purchased the property on which the Old Stanton School was built. It was their intent to erect a school to be called the Florida Institute. Financial problems, however, delayed progress on the building until December of that year, when the school was built and incorporated through the aid of the Freedmen's Bureau. This wooden structure was named in honor of Edwin McMasters Stanton, President Abraham Lincoln's second Secretary of War. He was an ardent champion of human rights and an advocate of free school education for Negro boys and girls. It was the second school for black children in the state of Florida (the first, from 1866, was the predecessor of Edward Waters College). Freedmen's Bureau ran the school. Northern white teachers were employed until the county leased the property for the purpose of opening a public school. The first building was destroyed by fire in 1882. Another building constructed the same year was also destroyed by fire on May 3, 1901, a fire that destroyed much of Jacksonville. A new school was constructed in 1902 and remained in operation until 1917. Originally the school mascot had been the Blue Devil. Because the school had burned and been rebuilt twice, \\"the Phoenix rising from ashes\\" would eventually be adopted as a second mascot. Today both mascots are used, with the Blue Devil used as the mascot for sports and other activities, and the Phoenix used as a symbol of the school itself, along with the most current logo, a royal blue Superman \\"S\\" symbol. On May 23, 1914, the Circuit Court of Duval County appointed nine trustees to manage the school and its property. They were Robert B. Archibald, S. H. Hart, A. L. Lewis, J. W. Floyd, W. L. Girardeau, I. L. Purcell, B. C. Vanderhorst, J. E. Spearing, and W.H. H. Styles. Archibaid and Hart resigned and were replaced by J. M. Baker and L. H. Myers. The deteriorating and unsafe condition of the poorly-constructed school building prompted the Board of Public Instruction, the Stanton School trustees, and interested citizens of Jacksonville to jointly agree to replace the wooden structure with a fire- proof building. In 1917 the building, which still stands at Ashley, Broad, Beaver, and Clay Streets, was completed. Stanton became the main focus for the education of black children in Duval County and surrounding areas. The Edwin M. Stanton School was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. An equally impressive record of academic expansion has accomplished the physical growth of Stanton. Beginning as an elementary school with six grades, under the administration of J. C. Waters as the first principal and D. W. Gulp who followed as principal, Stanton gradually became known throughout the state for the high educational standards which it still maintains today. The eighth grade was added under the leadership of Principal W. M. Artrell. Principal James Weldon Johnson, an alumnus, started the move toward a high school department. The addition of the twelfth grade made Stanton a comprehensive school. Stanton continued as a school for all grades through the administrations of I. A. Blocker, G. M. Sampson, and J. N. Wilson. In 1938, with F. J. Anderson as principal, Stanton became a senior high school exclusively. J. L. Terry served as the last principal of Stanton Senior High School. In 1953, the Stanton Senior School name was transferred to a new facility on 13th Street and was renamed New Stanton Senior High School. Charles D. Brooks was the first principal of the new school. Under his leadership, Stanton continued to foster the same traditionally high standards which befit its rich heritage, and flourished as the oldest and most important high school for blacks in Jacksonville. Beginning in 1953, the Broad and Ashley Street facility became known as the \\"Old\\" Stanton. The building was used as a junior high school in 1953-1954. In August 1954, it was converted into the Stanton Vocational High School and functioned as a vocational training center, adjusting its curriculum to train and graduate African- American students in technical skills. At night, it became a center for the Adult and Veterans Education Program. From 1969-1971, the focus of New Stanton Senior High School began to change from academic to vocational under the leadership of Principal Ben Durham, the former principal of Stanton Vocational High School. In 1971, the Old Stanton High School building was again placed under control of the trustees of Stanton and the student body was transferred to New Stanton Senior High School where the revised curriculum now provided for both the academic and the vocational interests of the students In 1981, Stanton College Preparatory School became the Duval County School System's first magnet school. Beginning with grades 7-10, and adding one grade level each succeeding year, the first senior class of 54 students graduated in 1984. Stanton College Preparatory School now serves secondary students living within the of the Duval County school district and leads the Duval County Public Schools in academic achievement.Stanton History In March 2017, the school received international criticism for verbiage on flyers hung around campus presenting both acceptable and unacceptable attire for the school prom. Students found the use of \\"good girl\\" to praise those with attire deemed appropriate to be demeaning, and took to social media with the hashtag #scpgoodgirl. The principal quickly issued an apology. School programs=Honor societies Stanton has many honor societies that support students in multiple fields. Honor societies include: * National Honor Society (NHS) * National Spanish Honor Society (NSHS) * National French Honor Society (NFHS) * National Latin Honor Society (NLHS) * Chinese National Honor Society (CNHS) * National Art Honor Society (NAHS) * National Film Honor Society (NFHS) * International Thespian Honor Society (ITHS) * National History Honor Society (NHHS) * National Math Honor Society (ŒúŒëŒò) * Science National Honor Society (SNHS) * National English Honor Society (NEHS) * National Society for Leadership and Success (NSLS) * Tri-M Music Honor Society * National Psychology Honors Society (NPHS) * Quill & Scroll International Journalism Honor Society Athletics Stanton competes in the Gateway Conference,https://dcps.duvalschools.org/Page/15719 a collaboration between most public high schools in Duval County. As of the 2018-2019 school year, Stanton's athletic director is Christopher Crider.https://dcps.duvalschools.org/domain/4027 Stanton's campus has a limited number of athletic facilities due to its urban environment, but includes a football field, a rubber track, a softball field, and two hard surface tennis courts. Because Stanton doesn't have a baseball field, the baseball team practices at J. P. Small Memorial Stadium. Similarly, Stanton's cross country and track & field teams used to practice at Mallison Park before Stanton's rubber track was built.

Gisenyi is contiguous with Goma, the city across the border in the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Overview The shoreline at Gisenyi. Taxi park at Gisenyi The city features a resort on the shores of Lake Kivu, with several hotels and three sandy beaches. The area is also known for water sports. The northern shore of the lake on which Goma and Gisenyi lie is a flat plain featuring lava formations from the eruptions of nearby Mount Nyiragongo. In contrast to Goma, Gisenyi escaped the lava flows of both the 1977 and the 2002 eruptions, which destroyed between 15 and 40% of the former. The centre of Gisenyi lies by foothills at the northeast corner of the lake, and low-density expansion is taking place in the hills, which are expected to be safe from future eruptions. Gisenyi is also home to Bralirwa, which manufactures various local beers ‚Äî Primus, M√ºtzig, Amstel and Guinness ‚Äî as well as a range of Coca-Cola‚Äìbranded soft drinks. Gisenyi is a small town compared to neighbouring Goma in the DRC, though Gisenyi is growing quickly. In 2011, a new multistorey shopping mall began construction over an old bus station. As of 2011, the main roads of the town are paved, and sidewalks are nearing completion for most of them as well. Gisenyi has two borders with Goma, the \\"Petite Barri√®re\\" and the \\"Grand Barri√®re\\". These names are a little misleading because the Petite Barri√®re is physically larger and features much higher traffic volumes. About 6,000 people crossed the Petite Barri√®re daily during 2011. On the Gisenyi side, a large customs and immigration office was built with a large capacity, not yet matched by the Congolese facilities. Similarly, the road to the Petite Barri√®re is paved on the Rwandan side but not on the Congolese side. The Grande Barri√®re is paved on both sides and receives more of the heavy truck traffic. It is also a diplomatic border. During the Rwandan genocide, the provisional government was based in the city.

The transient flow of groundwater is described by a form of the diffusion equation, similar to that used in heat transfer to describe the flow of heat in a solid (heat conduction). The steady-state flow of groundwater is described by a form of the Laplace equation, which is a form of potential flow and has analogs in numerous fields. The groundwater flow equation is often derived for a small representative elemental volume (REV), where the properties of the medium are assumed to be effectively constant. A mass balance is done on the water flowing in and out of this small volume, the flux terms in the relationship being expressed in terms of head by using the constituitive equation called Darcy's law, which requires that the flow is laminar. Other approaches are based on Agent Based Models to incorporate the effect of complex aquifers such as karstic or fractured rocks (i.e. volcanic) Mass balance A mass balance must be performed, and used along with Darcy's law, to arrive at the transient groundwater flow equation. This balance is analogous to the energy balance used in heat transfer to arrive at the heat equation. It is simply a statement of accounting, that for a given control volume, aside from sources or sinks, mass cannot be created or destroyed. The conservation of mass states that, for a given increment of time (Œît), the difference between the mass flowing in across the boundaries, the mass flowing out across the boundaries, and the sources within the volume, is the change in storage. : \\\\frac{\\\\Delta M_{stor}}{\\\\Delta t} = \\\\frac{M_{in}}{\\\\Delta t} - \\\\frac{M_{out}}{\\\\Delta t} - \\\\frac{M_{gen}}{\\\\Delta t} Diffusion equation (transient flow) Mass can be represented as density times volume, and under most conditions, water can be considered incompressible (density does not depend on pressure). The mass fluxes across the boundaries then become volume fluxes (as are found in Darcy's law). Using Taylor series to represent the in and out flux terms across the boundaries of the control volume, and using the divergence theorem to turn the flux across the boundary into a flux over the entire volume, the final form of the groundwater flow equation (in differential form) is: : S_s \\\\frac{\\\\partial h}{\\\\partial t} = - abla \\\\cdot q - G. This is known in other fields as the diffusion equation or heat equation, it is a parabolic partial differential equation (PDE). This mathematical statement indicates that the change in hydraulic head with time (left hand side) equals the negative divergence of the flux (q) and the source terms (G). This equation has both head and flux as unknowns, but Darcy's law relates flux to hydraulic heads, so substituting it in for the flux (q) leads to : S_s \\\\frac{\\\\partial h}{\\\\partial t} = - abla \\\\cdot (-K abla h) - G. Now if hydraulic conductivity (K) is spatially uniform and isotropic (rather than a tensor), it can be taken out of the spatial derivative, simplifying them to the Laplacian, this makes the equation : S_s \\\\frac{\\\\partial h}{\\\\partial t} = K abla^2 h - G. Dividing through by the specific storage (Ss), puts hydraulic diffusivity (Œ± = K/Ss or equivalently, Œ± = T/S) on the right hand side. The hydraulic diffusivity is proportional to the speed at which a finite pressure pulse will propagate through the system (large values of Œ± lead to fast propagation of signals). The groundwater flow equation then becomes : \\\\frac{\\\\partial h}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha abla^2 h - G. Where the sink/source term, G, now has the same units but is divided by the appropriate storage term (as defined by the hydraulic diffusivity substitution). Rectangular cartesian coordinates Three-dimensional finite difference grid used in MODFLOW Especially when using rectangular grid finite-difference models (e.g. MODFLOW, made by the USGS), we deal with Cartesian coordinates. In these coordinates the general Laplacian operator becomes (for three-dimensional flow) specifically : \\\\frac{\\\\partial h}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 h}{\\\\partial x^2} +\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 h}{\\\\partial y^2} +\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 h}{\\\\partial z^2}\\\\right] - G. MODFLOW code discretizes and simulates an orthogonal 3-D form of the governing groundwater flow equation. However, it has an option to run in a \\"quasi-3D\\" mode if the user wishes to do so; in this case the model deals with the vertically averaged T and S, rather than k and Ss. In the quasi-3D mode, flow is calculated between 2D horizontal layers using the concept of leakage. Circular cylindrical coordinates Another useful coordinate system is 3D cylindrical coordinates (typically where a pumping well is a line source located at the origin -- parallel to the z axis -- causing converging radial flow). Under these conditions the above equation becomes (r being radial distance and Œ∏ being angle), : \\\\frac{\\\\partial h}{\\\\partial t} = \\\\alpha \\\\left[ \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 h}{\\\\partial r^2} + \\\\frac{1}{r} \\\\frac{\\\\partial h}{\\\\partial r} + \\\\frac{1}{r^2} \\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 h}{\\\\partial \\\\theta^2} +\\\\frac{\\\\partial^2 h}{\\\\partial z^2} \\\\right] - G. Assumptions This equation represents flow to a pumping well (a sink of strength G), located at the origin. Both this equation and the Cartesian version above are the fundamental equation in groundwater flow, but to arrive at this point requires considerable simplification. Some of the main assumptions which went into both these equations are: * the aquifer material is incompressible (no change in matrix due to changes in pressure -- aka subsidence), * the water is of constant density (incompressible), * any external loads on the aquifer (e.g., overburden, atmospheric pressure) are constant, * for the 1D radial problem the pumping well is fully penetrating a non-leaky aquifer, * the groundwater is flowing slowly (Reynolds number less than unity), and * the hydraulic conductivity (K) is an isotropic scalar. Despite these large assumptions, the groundwater flow equation does a good job of representing the distribution of heads in aquifers due to a transient distribution of sources and sinks. Laplace equation (steady-state flow) If the aquifer has recharging boundary conditions a steady-state may be reached (or it may be used as an approximation in many cases), and the diffusion equation (above) simplifies to the Laplace equation. : 0 = \\\\alpha abla^2 h This equation states that hydraulic head is a harmonic function, and has many analogs in other fields. The Laplace equation can be solved using techniques, using similar assumptions stated above, but with the additional requirements of a steady-state flow field. A common method for solution of this equations in civil engineering and soil mechanics is to use the graphical technique of drawing flownets; where contour lines of hydraulic head and the stream function make a curvilinear grid, allowing complex geometries to be solved approximately. Steady-state flow to a pumping well (which never truly occurs, but is sometimes a useful approximation) is commonly called the Thiem solution. Two-dimensional groundwater flow The above groundwater flow equations are valid for three dimensional flow. In unconfined aquifers, the solution to the 3D form of the equation is complicated by the presence of a free surface water table boundary condition: in addition to solving for the spatial distribution of heads, the location of this surface is also an unknown. This is a non-linear problem, even though the governing equation is linear. An alternative formulation of the groundwater flow equation may be obtained by invoking the Dupuit‚ÄìForchheimer assumption, where it is assumed that heads do not vary in the vertical direction (i.e., \\\\partial h/\\\\partial z=0). A horizontal water balance is applied to a long vertical column with area \\\\delta x \\\\delta y extending from the aquifer base to the unsaturated surface. This distance is referred to as the saturated thickness, b. In a confined aquifer, the saturated thickness is determined by the height of the aquifer, H, and the pressure head is non-zero everywhere. In an unconfined aquifer, the saturated thickness is defined as the vertical distance between the water table surface and the aquifer base. If \\\\partial h/\\\\partial z=0, and the aquifer base is at the zero datum, then the unconfined saturated thickness is equal to the head, i.e., b=h. Assuming both the hydraulic conductivity and the horizontal components of flow are uniform along the entire saturated thickness of the aquifer (i.e., \\\\partial q_x /\\\\partial z=0 and \\\\partial K /\\\\partial z=0), we can express Darcy's law in terms of integrated groundwater discharges, Qx and Qy: : Q_x=\\\\int_0^b q_x dz = -K b\\\\frac{\\\\partial h}{\\\\partial x} : Q_y=\\\\int_0^b q_y dz = -K b\\\\frac{\\\\partial h}{\\\\partial y} Inserting these into our mass balance expression, we obtain the general 2D governing equation for incompressible saturated groundwater flow: : \\\\frac{\\\\partial nb}{\\\\partial t} = abla \\\\cdot (K b abla h) + N. Where n is the aquifer porosity. The source term, N (length per time), represents the addition of water in the vertical direction (e.g., recharge). By incorporating the correct definitions for saturated thickness, specific storage, and specific yield, we can transform this into two unique governing equations for confined and unconfined conditions: : S \\\\frac{\\\\partial h}{\\\\partial t} = abla \\\\cdot (K H abla h) + N. (confined), where S=Ssb is the aquifer storativity and : S_y\\\\frac{\\\\partial h}{\\\\partial t} = abla \\\\cdot (K h abla h) + N. (unconfined), where Sy is the specific yield of the aquifer. Note that the partial differential equation in the unconfined case is non-linear, whereas it is linear in the confined case. For unconfined steady-state flow, this non-linearity may be removed by expressing the PDE in terms of the head squared: : abla \\\\cdot (K abla h^2) = - 2N. Or, for homogeneous aquifers, : abla^2 h^2 = - \\\\frac{2N}{K}. This formulation allows us to apply standard methods for solving linear PDEs in the case of unconfined flow. For heterogeneous aquifers with no recharge, Potential flow methods may be applied for mixed confined/unconfined cases.

Its thermic effect or specific dynamic action‚Äîthe caloric \\"cost\\" of digesting the food‚Äîwould be greater than its food energy content. Despite its recurring popularity in dieting guides, there is no scientific evidence supporting the idea that any food is calorically negative. While some chilled beverages are calorically negative, the effect is minimal and requires drinking large amounts of water, which can be dangerous, as it can cause water intoxication. Controversy There is no scientific evidence to show that any of these foods have a negative calorific impact. Foods claimed to be negative in calories are mostly low-calorie fruits and vegetables such as celery, grapefruit, orange, lemon, lime, apple, lettuce, broccoli, and cabbage. However, celery has a thermic effect of around 8%, much less than the 100% or more required for a food to have \\"negative calories\\". Diets based on negative-calorie food do not work as advertised but can lead to weight loss because they satisfy hunger by filling the stomach with food that is not calorically dense. A 2005 study based on a low-fat plant-based diet found that the average participant lost over fourteen weeks, and attributed the weight loss to the reduced energy density of the foods resulting from their low fat content and high fiber content, and the increased thermic effect. Nevertheless, these diets are not \\"negative-calorie\\" since they bear energy. Another study demonstrated that negative-calorie diets (NCDs) have the same efficacy to low-calorie diets (LCDs) in inducing weight loss when both of these diets are combined with exercise. Chewing gum was once speculated as \\"negative-calorie food,\\" however a study on chewing gum reported mastication burns roughly per hour. Therefore, one stick of gum which contains around 10 kcal would require being chewed for one or more hours to reach \\"negative- calorie\\". Rebuttal Looking at this as just the digestive system; The digestion process takes energy to run. Chemicals are released, muscles are moved in sequence to push the food through the system. Uptake (nutrition) and waste systems both have a cost X calories to run. Looking at this as a systems view; Westerns were warned not to eat certain white tailed rabbits because they ultimately caused starvation. The energy in that case to catch, prepare, cook, eat wasn't gained from the intake of the rabbit. Lastly there is a time view your body takes so many calories to run (your brain being the biggest power draw), so if you intake less calories over 24 hours than you need you run at a color deficit. If you decided to eat only apples for a few days, most people would run a clear calorie deficit.

He notably played for West Ham United, Celtic, Ipswich Town, Leicester City and Watford, as well as representing England at under-21 and B level. Later on in his career he played for Carlton, Forest Green Rovers, Aberystwyth Town, Weston-super-Mare and Wivenhoe Town. Club career=West Ham United Slater joined West Ham as an apprentice in 1986 and after a tough first year, he became a star of the youth team. He made his first appearance for West Ham, still an apprentice, when he came on as substitute for Ray Stewart in the Division One home game against Derby County in October 1987. He was offered a professional contract in April 1988 just after his seventeenth birthday and made a second appearance in the 1987‚Äì88 season when he came on as substitute in the home game against Coventry City in the same month. He made his first start for West Ham against Southampton in August 1988, when a clash of heads with Russell Osman led to him being taken off in the first minute. He recovered to win the Man of the Match award in his next two games, against Charlton and Newcastle United, and scored his first goal for the club in a F.A. Cup 5th round tie against Charlton in February 1989. Playing in Division Two in 1989‚Äì90, he scored nine goals in 50 league and cup appearances as West Ham reached the semi-final of the League Cup, and made three substitute appearances for the England Under 21 team in 1990. Manager Billy Bonds switched him to the left wing towards the end of the 1989‚Äì90 season where he excelled to the extent that after a 5‚Äì0 home defeat of Sheffield United in March 1990, the Sheffield United defender, Chris Wilder, shook Slater's hand, saying, \\"That's the closest I've been to you all evening.\\" A similar performance came against Everton in the sixth-round of the FA Cup in March 1991, when he also scored West Ham's second goal from 20 yards, as West Ham won 2‚Äì1 to reach the semi-finals. West Ham returned to Division One in 1991‚Äì92 but, troubled by an Achilles injury, Slater failed to score a goal in 51 appearances. He turned down the offer of a new contract and left the club in August 1992 for Celtic. Celtic Former West Ham teammate, Liam Brady, then manager of Celtic, took Slater to Glasgow in a ¬£1.5 million deal in August 1992. Slater made his debut in the same month, coming on as a substitute in a 1‚Äì1 away draw against Rangers, but did not make an impression at Celtic and thirteen months later he returned south to Ipswich Town, having scored three goals in 43 appearances. Ipswich Town He joined Ipswich Town in a ¬£750,000 deal in September 1993, where he linked up again with his former manager at West Ham, John Lyall, in the Premier League. He stayed at Ipswich for three seasons scoring four goals in 84 appearances before leaving on a free transfer. Later career After a short spell on trial at Leicester City, Slater joined Watford. Injuries limited him to only 35 league appearances for the Watford in almost three years and he eventually moved to Australia, joining NSL club, Carlton S.C., in August 1999. Slater returned to England a year later to join Football Conference club Forest Green Rovers in October 2000, for whom he made 24 league and cup appearances in the 2000‚Äì01 season and played in the FA Trophy final at Villa Park in May 2001, when Rovers were beaten 1‚Äì0 by Canvey Island. He was unable to agree a new contract with Rovers and followed manager Frank Gregan to League of Wales side Aberystwyth Town in July 2001. Poor results in the first months of the 2001‚Äì02 season saw Frank Gregan depart and Slater follow him to Southern League club, Weston-super-Mare, in December 2001, where he stayed for the next three years, helping Weston-super-Mare to promotion to the Southern League Premier Division in 2003. He played his final game for Weston-super-Mare in a 1‚Äì1 draw, in which he scored, at Bishop Stortford in October 2004. In January 2009, Slater joined Wivenhoe Town, managed by his former West Ham teammate, Julian Dicks, but never made an appearance for the team. Career after football Slater became football coach having achieved the UEFA 'B' licence and has been a coach/manager at the Youth Academy of West Ham United and remains a club ambassador at 1st team games to this day. He also has many years experience as a secondary school P.E. Teacher at Kings Langley School. Slater later oversaw a full-time squad of under-19 Apprentices at Chelmsford City along with former Southend United and Colchester United player Kirk Game. The club has partnered Chelmsford College and formed a football programme called SOCA (Soccer Opportunities and Coaching Academy) that helps develop talented young footballers and coaches, giving them a chance to develop their skills at recognised clubs and organisations whilst also gaining top coaching and educational qualifications.

He brought academic rigour to an area that had been marked by nationalistic and religious biases. His work was part of the marked changes to Quebec society during the Quiet Revolution. Trudel's work has been honoured with major awards, including the Governor General's Literary Award for French Non-Fiction in 1966, and a second nomination for the award in 1987. Early life and education Marcel Trudel was born in Saint-Narcisse- de-Champlain, Quebec, northeast of Trois-Rivi√®res, the son of Hermyle Trudel and Antoinette Cossette, the ninth of eleven children. Orphaned at the age of five, he was adopted by a local couple in his extended family, Th√©odore Baril and Mary Tr√©panier.Marcel Trudel website: Biographie. .Les Prix du Qu√©bec: Prix L√©on-G√©rin 2001. He showed great academic progress and spent some months at a seminary at Trois-Rivi√®res, but concluded that the priesthood was not for him. Rather, he had a particular interest in literature and hoped to make his living as a writer. He earned a licence √®s lettres (cum laude) in 1941 and a Doctorat √®s lettres (magna cum laude) in 1945, both from Universit√© Laval. He then had two years of post-doctoral studies at Harvard University before returning to Laval to teach history.Emeritus professor Marcel Trudel dies , University of Ottawa, retrieved 12th Jan 2011. Career In 1947, Trudel was the first professor of history in Laval's newly founded Institute of History. He went on to become head of the History department. From 1955 to 1960, he published on many subjects that the Catholic hierarchy controlling the university found scandalous, such as: \\"Chiniquy\\" (the first French Catholic priest who became a Presbyterian minister), \\"The Canadian Catholic Church under the English Military Government, in 1759-1764\\", and \\"The Slaves in New France\\" (most of them being Amerindian and belonging even to the Catholic Church masters). As of 1962, Trudel was also president of the For La√Øcit√© Movement in Quebec City. It was too much: in 1962, under pressure from the Roman Catholic Church, Laval University demoted him from his position as head of the History department. In 1961, Laval University Press joined with the University of Toronto Press in establishing the Dictionary of Canadian Biography (DCB). Trudel served as the Associate General Editor from 1961 to 1965, working with the General Editor, George Williams Brown, a historian at the University of Toronto. They collaborated both in organizing the over-all project, which has published 15 volumes and is on-going, and in editing the first volume, which covered the period from 1000-1700 and was published in 1966. The DCB is published simultaneously in English and French and has been widely recognized as one of the most important scholarly undertakings in Canada. In 1965, Trudel left Laval University and Quebec City to live near Ottawa and taught at Carleton University. The next year, he began teaching at the University of Ottawa after the Ontario government took over the university from the Catholic Oblate Fathers. Having reached age 65 in 1982, he was relieved of his lecturing duties, but he continued to write from his home near Montreal until the year he died; half of his books were published in retirement. In 1993, he also began lecturing at a university to seniors' groups. Trudel's life's work was the history of New France, in particular his monumental and authoritative Histoire de la Nouvelle-France. Planned to be ten volumes in collaboration with another Quebec historian, Guy Fr√©gault, Trudel wrote six volumes in the series, published between 1963 to 1999.Marcel Trudel website: \\"Oeuvre inachev√©e\\". . Trudel meticulously reviewed the primary sources and criticized previous accounts in his effort to tell the colony's story without what he viewed as pious or nationalist bias.  Family and death  In 1942, Trudel married Anne Chr√©tien, with whom he had three children. He married again in 1970, to Micheline D'Allaire, who was also a professor of history at the University of Ottawa. Trudel died at the age of 93 on January 11, 2011, of generalized cancer. He left his three children, plus six grandchildren and six great-grandchildren. Selected Honours * 1964: J.B. Tyrrell Historical Medal by the Royal Society of CanadaRoyal Society of Canada, J.B.

It is part of the Campbell Union High School District, (CUHSD), the other schools in which are Branham, Leigh, Prospect, and Westmont. Most of Del Mar‚Äôs students come from the Campbell Union School District‚Äôs Monroe Middle School. The school serves both San Jose and Campbell, in addition to some unincorporated pockets of Santa Clara County. In 2016, Del Mar became an International Baccalaureate school. The first class who started the diploma, was the class of 2018. The school mascot of Del Mar is \\"The Don,\\" and the colors are black, gold, and, officially, white. As of 2012 the school principal is Larry Lopez. In recent years, the school's academic scores have risen significantly,Nobida, Martin. \\"After only a year, Principal Russell makes a big impact.\\" The Campbell Reporter, SVCN, LLC.

History  The CUHSD began construction on the Del Mar campus in 1957; it was established in 1959. The first school year began in September 1959 with the first class graduating in June 1960. Del Mar was the first complete four year high school in California to be constructed by the state's aid building fund, at a cost of $3 million. The dedication of the new school was attended by California Governor Edmund G. \\"Pat\\" Brown. The school was also the first of any high school in the state to boast a sunken football stadium; the stadium came about as part of an agreement between the school district and Count Allesandro Dandini, the owner of a brick-making plant which was adjacent to the football field. The stadium area was cleared out in exchange for the clay which was excavated. In 2007, the grass field and dirt track were replaced with an artificial turf field and tartan track in time for football season. The superintendent of the CUHSD at the time of the school's construction in 1957, Larry Hill, made a deal to get the 'clinker' bricks from the yard at a discount, to use in the schools the district was building at the time.\\"Del Mar High School History.\\" CUHSD. As a result, all of Del Mar's original buildings have a great deal of brick in them.  Athletics and extracurricular activities  Del Mar‚Äôs main athletic rivals are often Branham, Westmont or Leigh, since they are sister schools in the Campbell Union High School District. This varies between sports and changes from year to year, however.  Sports  Del Mar sports teams compete in the Blossom Valley Athletic League, divisions of which are ‚ÄòA league‚Äô: Mount Hamilton Division, ‚ÄòB league‚Äô: Santa Teresa Division, and ‚ÄòC league‚Äô: West Valley Division.\\"Blossom Valley Athletic League Online.\\" Blossom Valley Athletic League. BVAL falls in California‚Äôs Central Coast Section, known as CCS. The school's sport program includes football, soccer, basketball, cross country, volleyball, field hockey, tennis, golf, wrestling, baseball, softball, badminton, swimming & diving, and track & field.\\"Athletics.\\" Del Mar High School, CUHSD. Del Mar sports teams have won many League and CCS championships over the course of the school's history - the banners commemorating those titles hang in the school's big gym. In the 2005-2006 school year, several teams won the title of League Champions, including football, JV boys' soccer, badminton, and girls' swimming. The 2006-2007 season was no different, as boys' basketball won the league, as did the ladies soccer team, who went on to CCS. In the spring of 2007, the track & field team sent the first relay team to CCS in 10 years, but fell short of winning league to Andrew Hill. Field hockey has won league titles in 2001-2002 and 2008-2009, 2009-2010, 2010-2011. In fall 2007, the football team made history by going 10-0, a feat that has never accomplished in the school's history, and also was able to host the first round of CCS Playoffs at home for the first time in 11 years. In 2007-2008 Del Mar's track team won the League championship going a perfect 7-0 in League. In 2009, the girls basketball team won a school-record 21 games and made it to the second round of CCS playoffs.\\"BVAL Team Standings Archives.\\" Blossom Valley Athletic League. Del Mar's Football team won the 2010 league championship with a 7-3 record, which was a huge turn around from the 1-9 record the previous season. Del Mar repeated as the 2011 West Valley Division Football Champs with a league record of 7-3. This was the first time Del Mar won back to back league championships in football since the 90-91 teams. Awards lined up at the 2007 Feste Del Mar.  Performing arts  Del Mar‚Äôs marching band is officially named the Del Mar High School Marching Band. In the fall, they host the annual Feste Del Mar Band Review, which holds competitions for Concert, Jazz, and Marching bands,\\"Welcome.\\" Del Mar HS Performing Arts. and is known in the NCBA (Northern California Band Association) circuit for its hospitality. Del Mar routinely sends musicians to the Northern California Honor Band, and the All-State Honor Band. Fall season Marching Band was a class until 2016 when it officially became an extra- curricular sport, rehearsing Tuesday and Thursday nights from 6 to 9 pm and Saturdays from 9 am to 5 pm. Meanwhile, the class became solely dedicated to Symphonic band performance. In the winter season, Del Mar fields a WinterGuard and Winter Percussion, which both practice Tuesday and Thursday nights. They have competed as part of CCGC, and NCBA. Del Mar also has a fairly successful Choir class, with plans to travel to Dublin in June 2018. Orchestra has also become an outside-school activity due to low enrollment. Drama 1 and Drama 2, and occasionally Drama 3, classes are offered at Del Mar. There is a play produced every November and a musical produced every February, as well as a faculty musical every April. All productions are usually directed and produced by the chair of the performing arts department.

Schedule  Del Mar, along with the rest of the CUHSD, is on a block schedule, with periods 1-3 on Gold days, 4-6 on Black days, zero period every day, and seventh period every day except Wednesday. This gives teachers longer uninterrupted class periods to work with. For the 2009-2010 school year, Del Mar's faculty voted on a new class schedule. This schedule would consist of a tutorial period in the middle of the day named \\"PLUS PERIOD.\\" Furthermore, freshman who are not enrolled in Honors classes will follow a Learning Community program. This is an attempt to remedy past failures in increasing exam scores. Del Mar also has \\"collaboration days\\" when seventh period doesn‚Äôt meet, and school ends at 1:15. There are also minimum days at the end of each grading period, (every six weeks), when regular classes get out at 12:25, seventh period at 1:00.

Several school awards are presented at graduation, including the Principal's Cup, the Laurance J. Hill Award, and the titles of valedictorian and salutatorian. Laurance Hill was a principal of the old Campbell High School, and played an important role in the expansion of the CUHSD district. An award in his name is given out to those with good grades and high involvement in school, especially in community service.

The large and small gyms, locker rooms, and swimming pool, on the south side of the quad, are also original. The big gym, home to basketball, volleyball, badminton, and several families of small birds which build nests in the old lights in the ceiling, received a new paint job in 2006 courtesy of the Don's Club. The pool deck has two pools, the 12-foot diving well and the 6-lane pool, which is 3.5 feet at the ends and 4 in the middle. Water polo cannot be played at Del Mar because of the pool's depth, or lack thereof. There are seven tennis courts, four outdoor basketball courts, two sand volleyball courts that are rarely used, the weight room, a football practice field, a baseball diamond, three softball/baseball fields, and a large field that houses soccer. There is also the Bowl, housing the brand new artificial-turf athletic field and appropriately new rubber track which is used for field hockey, soccer, and football.Google Maps.

It was one of the palaces owned by Federico da Montefeltro and his wife Battista Sforza and was a fortified, palatial retreat. It is now a museum. History Fortress of San Leo The first fortification on the top of the mountain was built by the Romans. In the Middle Ages it was bitterly fought over by the Byzantines, Goths, Franks and Lombards. Between 961 and 963 Berengar II, the last king of the Lombard Kingdom of Italy, was besieged by Otto I of Saxony. Around the middle of the eleventh century the Counts of Montecopiolo came to Montefeltro, the ancient name of San Leo, from which they took the name and title. In the second half of the 14th century the Malatesta were able to capture the fortress, but until the middle of the 15th century, the castle was often retaken by the Montefeltro. In 1441 the young Federico da Montefeltro scaled the walls of the fort. Faced with the new military dangers, he had the fortress rebuilt, entrusting the task to the Sienese engineer Francesco di Giorgio Martini. The new structure allowed for a dynamic counter-offensive, providing for cross-fire. The fortress sides were equipped with artillery and the access points were rendered unreachable by enemy fire thanks to military outposts. In 1502, Cesare Borgia, with the support of Pope Alexander VI, took possession of the fortress. At the death of the pope, in 1503, Guidobaldo da Montefeltro took possession of his dominions. In 1516 the Florentine troops, supported this time by Pope Leo X and guided by Antonio Ricasoli, penetrated the city and commandeered the fort. From 1527 until the devolution to the Papal State from the Duchy of Urbino in 1631, San Leo belonged to the Della Rovere. With the new ownership, the fortress was used as a prison. Among the inmates were Felice Orsini and Freemason Alessandro Cagliostro. In 1906 the fortress ceased to be a prison and for eight years, until 1914, it hosted a \\"compagnia di disciplina\\". In the period of Italia Unita, the municipality of San Leo belonged to the province of Marche (Province of Pesaro and Urbino), until 15 August 2009 when it was separated together with six other municipalities of the Valmarecchia, following the outcome of a referendum held on 17 and 18 December 2006. Currently the castle houses a museum and an art gallery in arms. Description In the fortress there are two distinct parts: the keep, with its square turrets and the gothic entrance is the older part and residential wing; and the more recent round towers and massive corbeled wall that connects them. The two towers, the wall, and the keep surround the so-called Place d'Armes. The area is dotted with rocky peaks that rise steeply from the sea cliffs. On each of these peaks, the ruins of a castle or fort recall a tumultuous past. To the visitor who walks up the Romagna plain, the City-Fortress appears as a huge shield of high smooth rock. It appears like a ship with the bow to the East, the bell tower like a mast, and the handful of houses scattered around. * It played a large part in the 1991-film Hudson Hawk as the fictional castle of Leonardo da Vinci.

This section treats all aspects of Jewish law primarily pertinent to the Hebrew calendar (be it the daily, weekly, monthly, or annual calendar). Rabbi Yosef Karo modeled the framework of the Shulkhan Arukh (◊©◊ï◊ú◊ó◊ü ◊¢◊®◊ï◊ö), his own compilation of practical Jewish law, after the Arba'ah Turim. Many later commentators used this framework, as well. Thus, Orach Chayim in common usage may refer to an area of halakha, non-specific to Rabbi Jacob ben Asher's compilation.

Loammi Baldwin Colonel Loammi Baldwin (January 10, 1744 - October 20, 1807) was a noted American engineer, politician, and a soldier in the American Revolutionary War. Baldwin is known as the Father of American Civil Engineering. His five sons, Cyrus Baldwin (1773-1854), Benjamin Franklin Baldwin (1777-1821), Loammi Baldwin, Jr. (1780-1834), James Fowle Baldwin (1782-1862), and George Rumford Baldwin (1798-1888) were also well-known engineers. He surveyed and was responsible for the construction of the Middlesex Canal, but today he is perhaps best remembered for the Baldwin apple which he developed at his farm, or rather he recognized its potential and propagated it throughout the northeast. The apple had been discovered on the farm of John Ball in Wilmington, Massachusetts, around 1750, and named Woodpecker by a later owner of the farm. Colonel Baldwin's promotion of the apple occurred after 1784. He was also a surveyor and plantation co-owner in Hartford, Maine, which at that time was known as East Butterfield.The Apples of NY (1905), and Lorraine Parsons in Hartford, Maine Education Baldwin attended grammar school in Woburn, Massachusetts. Later he would walk from North Woburn to Cambridge with his younger friend and childhood neighbor, Benjamin Thompson, later Count Rumford, to attend the lectures of Professor John Winthrop at Harvard College. He and Thompson performed their own experiments at home. Baldwin received a Master of Arts degree from Harvard in 1785. Military Career in the American Revolution In 1774, Baldwin enlisted in a regiment, and commanded the Woburn militia at the Battle of Lexington and Concord as a major. He is recorded as having described the events of April 19, 1775 as follows The Woburnites http://www.yeoldewoburn.net/Baldwin.htm \\"We mustered as fast as possible. The Town turned out extraordinary, and proceeded toward Lexington.\\" As a major at the time he continues \\"I rode along a little before the main body, and when I was nigh Jacob Reed's (at present Durenville) I heard a great firing; proceeded on, soon heard that the Regulars had fired upon Lexington people and killed a large number of them. We proceeded on as fast as possible and came to Lexington and saw about eight or ten dead and numbers wounded.\\" He then, with the rest from Woburn, proceeded to Concord by way of Lincoln meeting house, ascended a hill there, and rested and refreshed themselves a little. Then follows a particular account of the action and of his own experience. He had \\"several good shots,\\" and proceeded on till coming between the meeting-house and Buckman's tavern at Lexington, with a prisoner before him, the cannon of the British began to play, the balls flying near him, and for safety he retreated back behind the meeting-house, when a ball came through near his head, and he further retreated to a meadow north of the house and lay there and heard the balls in the air and saw them strike the ground. Woburn sent to the field on that day, one hundred and eighty men. At the beginning of the war, he enlisted in the 26th Continental Regiment commanded by Colonel Samuel Gerrish. Here he rapidly advanced to be lieutenant-colonel, and upon Colonel Gerrish's retirement in August 1775, he was placed in command of the regiment, and was soon commissioned colonel.Marquis Who's Who, Inc. Who Was Who in American History, the Military. Chicago: Marquis Who's Who, 1975. P. 26 Until the end of 1775, Baldwin and his men remained near Boston, but in April 1776, he was ordered with his command to New York City. He took part in the Battle of Pell's Point on October 18, 1776. On the night of December 25‚Äì26, in the face of a violent and extremely cold storm of snow and hail, General Washington and his army crossed the Delaware to the New Jersey side, and fought the Battle of Trenton on the morning of December 26. Baldwin and his regiment participated in both the crossing and the fight. In 1777, Baldwin resigned from the army because of ill health. Political career Baldwin was elected to various public offices between 1780 and 1796. He was appointed high sheriff of Middlesex County in 1780, and was the first to hold office after the adoption of the state constitution. From 1778-1784, he represented Woburn in the Massachusetts General Court. In 1794, he was a candidate for election to the United States House of Representatives, and obtained all the votes cast in Woburn but one. Engineering career Baldwin began work with his older sons on the Middlesex Canal in 1794 and after nine years, the canal began service in 1803. He later worked on Boston's fortifications. His son Cyrus continued his father's work on the Middlesex Canal as an agent for the canal company. His son Benjamin worked on the Boston Mill Dam until his early death at the age of 43. Other Baldwin was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1782. He opposed Shays' Rebellion. His published work as a member of the AAAS included early experiments with electricity \\"An account of a Curious Appearance of the Electrical Fluid,\\" (Memoirs Am. Acad. Vol. 1, 1785, pp. 257‚Äì259); and \\"Observations on Electricity and an Improved Mode of Constructing Lightning Rods,\\" (Memoirs, Vol. 2, pt. 2, 1804, pp. 96‚Äì104). The first paper was written in 1783, and the \\"curious appearance\\" described was produced by raising an electrical kite at the time of a thunder shower. The experiments, however, were tried in July, 1771. At that time the author mentions that there stood some lofty trees near his house, and also a shop near by it. His parents, family, and neighbors witnessed the \\"electrical effect\\" he succeeded in producing. The date of preparing the second article was January 25, 1797. His home Baldwin House‚Äîoriginally built in 1660 and expanded in the 1800s‚Äîstill stands in Woburn and is currently in use as a Chinese restaurant. Family Baldwin married July 9, 1772, Mary Fowle (died 1786 age 39) daughter of James Fowle, Jr. and Mary Reed, and had four sons. He married again, May 26, 1791, Margaret Fowle (1747-1799), daughter of Josiah and Margery Carter, and had a son and a daughter.Marquis Who's Who, Inc. Who Was Who in American History, the Military.

Welbeck Woodhouse is a further notable mansion, in the former park (grounds) of Welbeck Abbey and was built by Lord Portland in the 1930s. Character The Dukeries saw four ducal families in close proximity among fewer than twenty at any given time current (extant) English dukedoms and their parks or farmed lands largely neighbouring to the point of being at most points touching (contiguous). The last mansion in single-family occupation is Welbeck Abbey ‚Äì by a great-nephew of the final (seventh) Duke of Portland. The late Duke had neighbouring Welbeck Woodhouse built in the early 1930s when he bore his courtesy marquessate style. The latter property is equally intact, , north east of the main house and long. The incumbent Duke of Norfolk sold Worksop Manor to the Duke of Newcastle in 1839. The Norfolks preferred to spend more time at Arundel Castle and the Duke of Newcastle wanted the land to enlarge his estate and had the main part of the house demolished. The service wing was adapted into a smaller mansion-esque country house later in the 19th century, which survives. Clumber House was demolished by the Dukes of Newcastle in the 1930s because they could no longer afford the upkeep, but the Victorian chapel survived, and the park now belongs to the National Trust. Thoresby Hall opened as a country house hotel early in the 21st century after a period of neglect, though the wider Thoresby Estate remains in the hands of the descendants of the Dukes of Kingston. Although not part of the Dukeries, Nottingham Castle, a former residence of the Dukes of Newcastle is also situated in Nottinghamshire, as is the former seat of the Dukes of St Albans at Bestwood Lodge. Bestwood St Albans, a civil parish in the Gedling borough of Nottinghamshire, maintains a link with the Dukes of St Albans through its name. Dukeries Coalfield In the early 20th century the economic and social base of the Dukeries was dramatically influenced by the development of its underlying coalfield, the eastern extension of the Nottinghamshire coalfield. Five coal mines were opened after the first shaft sinking commenced in 1920. The coal mines were at Clipstone (coal won 1922), Ollerton (1925), Blidworth (1926), Bilsthorpe (1927) and Thoresby near Edwinstowe (1928).Waller (1983), p. 5 The landowners auctioned or leased their mineral rights: Earl Manvers' Thoresby estate in May 1919 and Lord Savile of Rufford Abbey's lease for Ollerton in 1921.Waller (1983), p. 14 Colliery companies such as the Butterley Company at Ollerton and the Stanton Company at Thoresby bought the rights.Waller (1983), p. 15 The companies financed the construction of pit villages to house the miners and their families, who migrated from older coalfields throughout Britain.Waller (1983), pp. 25‚Äì53 The villages offered facilities, such as a distinctive heating system provided by the mine running in pipes between houses in New Ollerton.Waller (1983), p. 79 While displaying characteristics of paternalism the villages were restrictive, as some companies employed company policemenWaller (1983), pp. 98‚Äì100 and discouraged trade unionism, apart from the breakaway Nottinghamshire Miners' Industrial Union (NMIU) of George Spencer in the 1930s. Work at the Dukeries collieries did not cease even during the coal and general strike of 1926.Waller (1983), pp.108‚Äì130 The Labour party was not electorally successful in the mining villages until 1946, after the Second World War had weakened the power of the employers.Waller (1983), pp. 131‚Äì162 ReferencesExternal links *The Dukeries at Worksop Heritage Trail *Welbeck Colliery history webpage Dukeries ","title":"The Dukeries"},{"id":"1863786","text":"Linda Joyce Greenhouse (born January 9, 1947) is an American legal journalist who is the Knight Distinguished Journalist in Residence and Joseph M. Goldstein Lecturer in Law at Yale Law School. She is a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter who covered the United States Supreme Court for nearly three decades for The New York Times. She is President of the American Philosophical Society (since 2017),https://www.amphilsoc.org/about/officers-council and a member of the Phi Beta Kappa Senate.https://www.pbk.org/senate Early life and education Greenhouse was born to a Jewish family in New York City, to H. Robert Greenhouse, a physician and professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, and Dorothy (n√©e Greenlick). She received her Bachelor of Arts degree in government from Radcliffe College in 1968, where she was elected to Phi Beta Kappa. She received her Master of Studies in Law from Yale Law School in 1978. Career Greenhouse began her 40-year career at The New York Times covering state government in the paper's bureau in Albany. After completing her master's degree on a Ford Foundation fellowship, she returned to the Times and covered 29 sessions of the Supreme Court from 1978 to 2007, with the exception of two years during the mid-1980s during which she covered Congress. Since 1981, she has published over 2,800 articles in the Times. She has been a regular guest on the PBS program Washington Week. Linda Greenhouse (left) at the Phi Beta Kappa Book Awards Dinner in Washington, DC on December 7, 2018. In 2008, Greenhouse accepted an offer from The Times for an early retirement at the end of the Supreme Court session in the summer of 2008. Seven of the nine sitting Justices attended a goodbye party for Greenhouse on June 12, 2008. She continues to blog for The Times in the \\"Opinionator\\" section. In 2010, Greenhouse and co-author Reva Siegel put out a book on the development of the abortion debate prior to the 1973 Supreme Court ruling on the subject: Before Roe v. Wade. This was largely a selection of primary documents, though with some commentary. Greenhouse criticized US policies and actions at Guantanamo Bay, Abu Ghraib, and Haditha in a 2006 speech at Harvard University. In it, Greenhouse said she started crying a few years back at a Simon & Garfunkel concert because her generation hadn't done a better job of running the country than previous generations. Awards and prizes Greenhouse was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in Journalism (Beat Reporting) in 1998 \\"for her consistently illuminating coverage of the United States Supreme Court.\\" In 2004, she received the Goldsmith Career Award for Excellence in Journalism and the John Chancellor Award for Excellence in Journalism. She was a Radcliffe Institute Medal winner in 2006. When she was at Radcliffe, she said in a speech given in 2006, \\"I was the Harvard stringer for the Boston Herald, which regularly printed, and paid me for, my accounts of student unrest and other newsworthy events at Harvard. But when it came time during my senior year to look for a job in journalism, the Herald would not even give me an interview, and neither would the Boston Globe, because these newspapers had no interest in hiring women.\\" Criticism Greenhouse has expressed her personal views as an outspoken advocate for abortion rights and critic of conservative religious values, and a 2006 report on NPR questioned whether this compromised the appearance that she maintains journalistic neutrality on such matters. New York Times public editor Daniel Okrent said that he has never received a single complaint of bias in Greenhouse's coverage. Journalism conference, 2007 On August 9, 2007, a television crew from C-SPAN was forbidden to film a panel discussion at a meeting of the Association for Education in Journalism and Mass Communication. Greenhouse had told organizers that she would not be able answer questions as fully and frankly if the session were filmed. The vice president of programming at C-SPAN, Terence Murphy, questioned the decision: \\"If professors of journalism and working journalists taking part in a journalism education conference don't stand up for open media access to public policy discussions, who will?\\" Suggestions of conflict of interest, 2008 Ed Whelan, writing in a blog associated with National Review, suggested that Greenhouse had an obligation to her readers to inform them when she reported on a Supreme Court case that her husband, Eugene Fidell, had submitted an amicus brief: He had submitted an amicus brief in the Hamdan case. Fidell also submitted an amicus brief in the Boumediene case when it was at the D.C. Circuit level before it went to the Supreme Court. Clark Hoyt, the public editor of the New York Times, opined that the paper \\"should have clued in readers\\" to Greenhouse's conflict, but defended the neutrality of her coverage. Emily Bazelon and Dahlia Lithwick, writing in Slate, complained that the New York Times \\"had failed to stand up\\" for Greenhouse and defended Greenhouse from Whelan's criticism. They quoted Yale Law School professor Judith Resnik who pointed out that Whelan had been unable to point to any actual sign of bias. In a rebuttal in the National Review, Whelan asserted both that Bazelon and Lithwick had resorted to \\"baseless ad hominem attacks and to (literally) catty comments about 'right- wing kitty cats.'\\" He then refutes the claim that he did not provide any actual examples of bias, and points readers to a previous article in his series on Greenhouse's alleged conflict of interest.  Personal life  She married lawyer Eugene R. Fidell on January 1, 1981 in Washington, D.C., in a Jewish ceremony. Together they have one daughter, filmmaker Hannah Fidell (born October 7, 1985).
