Background and life Manuel Anemas was a member of the Anemas family. Four Anemas brothers were involved in a serious conspiracy against Alexios I Komnenos in 1105.Kazhdan, p. 96 It is remarkable that in the next generation a member of the same family, Manuel, married the porphyrogenita princess Theodora Komnene, daughter of John II and his empress, Eirene of Hungary. By this marriage John II may have been seeking to politically neutralise the threat of a potentially dangerous family. He was certainly pursuing a policy of bringing 'new blood' into the imperial family and governing circles.Magdalino, p. 207 Manuel was celebrated by the Byzantine court poet Theodore Prodromos, who described him as a wise general and the \\"great tower of the Rhomaioi\\",Kazhdan and Epstein, p. 107 Rhomaioi being the Romans, as the Byzantines referred to themselves. Though Anemas appears to have been a prominent soldier little information on his exploits has survived. Manuel Anemas died in 1148; a funerary lament dated to Holy Week of that year by Prodromos, for \\"'Kyrios Manuel Anemas, the most fortunate son-in-law of the late basileus and autokrator of the Romans John the Purple-born\\", is extant.Magdalino, p. 486 Family Manuel Anemas and Theodora Komnene had a number of children: * Alexios KomnenosHe adopted his mother's more prestigious surname. . ( or – 1155/57), married Anna Komnene Doukaina, a great-grandniece of Alexios I (possibly a granddaughter of Alexios' brother Isaac Komnenos). He died of some disease, possibly tuberculosis, and died at a young age; his wife followed soon after. The couple had one child, of whom nothing further is known. * A daughter, possibly named Irene (born ), she married an unknown husband, and had at least one daughter, Theodora, the wife of Andronikos Lapardas. * A daughter, possibly named Maria (born ), she married John Angelos, a nephew of Constantine Angelos and distinguished military commander. The marriage remained childless. * Eudokia (born ), she married the scholar Theodore Styppeiotes, who became Manuel I's chief minister.

Nicknamed The Truck, he and fellow American Jimmy Rogers, who signed with Ármann, have been credited for revolutionizing the Icelandic basketball scene after they became the first foreign born professional players in the Icelandic Basketball League in 1975. Early life Carter grew up in Kansas City and played for Missouri Southern State University and Bishop College before being drafted by the Phoenix Suns 15th round of the 1971 NBA Draft. He was released by the Suns in mid-June 1971 before playing any game. Iceland Carter joined KR in 1975, at the age of 25, after playing in Mexico and Sweden the previous two seasons, and immediately caught the attention of the fans and media with his powerful play and dunks. On November 11, 1975, in a game between KR and Valur, he was issued a warning and later a technical foul for repeatedly dunking the ball during the game, a move that was illegal by the rules at that time. The game officials where also worried that the bolts holding the basket to the ceiling would not be able to sustain his powerful dunks. The first meeting between Carter and Rogers on December 16 was highly anticipated and did not disappoint. It was a tightly played and ended with an 86-81 victory for Ármann. But 54 second remaining in the game, and the score tied at 81-81, Carter got into a fight with Rogers and knocked him down. The punch was caught on a picture and made the front page of Dagblaðið the day after, as well as the headline in Þjóðviljinn \\"Jimmy won the duel - The Truck won the boxing\\". Both players received a one-game suspension for the fight from the disciplinary court of the Icelandic Basketball Federation and where threatened with a six-game suspension for any future fights. The verdict was highly criticized, both for the short suspension and for the threat of a longer suspension that only applied to them, as referees were worried that opposing players would try to harass them and goad into a fight. In the end, Rogers and Ármann came out on the top in the league after beating KR in the last game of the season, guaranteeing them the first place and the national championship. Carter did beat Rogers for the scoring title, leading the league with 451 points, followed by Rogers with 365 points and Kristján Ágústsson with 337 points.

Education and career Xia's construction proving the Painlevé conjecture Xia received in 1982 from Nanjing University a bachelor's degree in astronomy and in 1988 a PhD in mathematics from Northwestern University with thesis advisor Donald G. Saari and thesis The Existence of the Non-Collision Singularities. From 1988 to 1990 Xia was an assistant professor at Harvard University and from 1990 to 1994 an associate professor at Georgia Institute of Technology (and Institute Fellow). In 1994 he became a full professor at Northwestern University and since 2000 he has been there the Arthur and Gladys Pancoe Professor of Mathematics. His research deals with celestial mechanics, dynamical systems, Hamiltonian dynamics, and ergodic theory. In his dissertation he solved the Painlevé conjecture, a long- standing problem posed in 1895 by Paul Painlevé. The problem concerns the existence of singularities of non-collision character in the N-body problem in three-dimensional space; Xia proved existence for N \\\\geq 5 . For the existence proof he constructed an example of five masses, of which four are separated into two pairs which revolve around each other in eccentric elliptical orbits about the z-axis of symmetry, and a fifth mass moves along the z-axis. For selected initial conditions, the fifth mass can be accelerated to an infinite velocity in a finite time interval (without any collision between the bodies involved in the example).In 1908 Edvard Hugo von Zeipel proved the surprising fact that the existence of a non-collision singularity in the N-body problem necessarily causes the velocity of at least one particle to become unbounded. The case N = 4 is open.Joseph L. Gerver gave arguments (a heuristic model) for the existence of a non-collision singularity for the planar Newtonian 4-body problem — however, there is still no rigorous proof. See For N = 3 Painlevé had proved that the singularities (points of the orbit in which accelerations become infinite in a finite time interval) must be of the collision type. However, Painlevé's proof did not extend to the case N > 3 . In 1993 Xia was the inaugural winner of the Blumenthal Award of the American Mathematical Society. From 1989 to 1991 he was a Sloan Fellow. From 1993 to 1998, he received the National Young Investigator Award from the National Science Foundation. In 1995 he received the Monroe H. Martin Prize in Applied Mathematics from the University of Maryland. In 1998 he was an Invited Speaker of the International Congress of Mathematicians in Berlin.

Factory carries out the production of natural gas, natural gas liquids, natural gasoline, gas condensate, heavy condensates, dry gas, commercial butane and commercial propane-butane mixture. The plant is situated in Lokbatan settlement, Baku. The director of the Gas Processing Plant is Agshin Pashayev.  History  In 1958 “GIPROAZNEFT” institute, which operated in the former Soviet period designed the Gas Processing Plant. The first and second building phases were completed, respectively in 1961 and in 1963-1964. During the first phase, three units were put into operation with other all supporting facilities. The units were unit 3 contains gas-gasoline separator equipment, natural gasoline stripping and gas condensate processing unit 4. The gasoline- gas separator equipment in unit 2 and unit 1 were established during the second phase. The initial design of the plant was capable to process 4.5 billion cubic meters natural gas per year. The annual processing capacity increased to 6.5 billion cubic meters as a result of the reconstruction works in 1986. During the reconstruction works 2 gas measuring points were constructed. At the same time, underground gas pipelines were laid over trestles and underwater pipes replaced with surface pipelines. Two measuring plants “high-pressure output of gas” and “total output of gas” were built in 2003-2004. In 2009 additional line of the “total output of gas” plant was established.  Trends in gas processing  Since early 2017 the volume of recovered natural gas after processing in the Plant was 1.68 billion cubic meters. Statistics reveal that 63% of the annual natural gas processing capacity of the plant was used. Besides, more than eleven thousand tons of naphtha and 7500 tons of technical butane were processed and 4600 tons of technical butane were transferred to Azerikimya Production Union. There is an agreement between Gas Processing Plant and Azneft Production Union. According to this contract, the plant processes gas of Azneft SOCAR and transfers producing gas to Azerigas.

It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2009. It is a two-story two part commercial block building, in plan, built with hollow tile walls by builder/architect C.C. Smith. The building \\" deftly illustrates the specialized adaptation of a typical main street commercial building for automobile sales and service functions. As the popularity of automobiles soared, real estate investors constructed this building near the heart of Kansas City’s nascent Automobile Row. By blending a traditional commercial façade with physical elements that addressed the specific needs of automobile sales and service, the building met the needs of tenants and consumers. Distinctive features include large storefront windows on the first story, which gave passersby a clear view of the vehicles for sale inside; large expanses of over-sized windows on the second story and skylights in the roof, which provided ample light and ventilation to work areas on the second floor; and an oversized freight elevator capable of transporting vehicles, as well as auto parts, from the back alley to the first floor or the second floor. Most notable, though, is the building’s highly unique structural system, which supplements a typical early-twentieth century masonry and wood structure with massive steel I-beams that span the ceiling on the first floor and distinctive turnbuckle trusses that hang from the ceiling on the second floor. These structural enhancements responded to the very heavy loads the building had to support to serve its intended function. The automotive service building at 1901 McGee Street clearly embodies this type and period of commercial design and is characteristic example of the automotive service buildings that survive from the heyday of Kansas City’s automobile row. The period of significance, 1912 – 1941, reflects the dates of construction and a significant renovation.\\".

She is well known for her bird-and- flower paintings executing the \\"boneless\\" technique, and became the most famed of the Yun family's female artists. Biography Yun was born to an artistic family in Wujin District of Changzhou, the granddaughter of the famed painter Yun Shouping. Her niece Yun Zhu was also a talented artists. Though her birth and death dates are unknown, one of her paintings in the Shanghai Museum is dated to 1750. She married Mao Hongtiao, also from Wujin, and the two sold paintings and wrote poetry to support their family. One of Yun's granddaughters, named Zhou (), was recorded in the Yun family genealogy book, which has been used to suggest that her artistic skills were worthy of the Yun clan. Art Yun's painting style was heavily influenced by her family's preference for the \\"boneless\\" technique. She predominantly painted bird-and- flower paintings, but also painted people, one of which depicts a woman doing her hair known as the Hairpin Scroll (). Yun is often compared with her contemporary Ma Quan, who similarly specialised in bird-and-flower painting but favoured strong outlines. The Chuyue jiexu wenjian lu (), compiled in 1818, describes how people throughout the Jiangnan region described them as the \\"two without parallel\\" () During his tenure as governor-general of Liangjiang, Yi Jishan presented some of Yun's works to Empress Dowager Chongqing who in turn showed them to the Qianlong Emperor. The emperor was reportedly so impressed that he wrote a poem praising her art, after which Yun's reputation as a painter spread.

The early camps were attended by several high- ranking politicians both from Romania (f.i. Emil Constantinescu, Traian Băsescu, Adrian Severin) and Hungary, and it was well received by both communities.Tusványos, sau când dialogul seamănă a monolog, Adevărul, July 29, 2015Tusványos: kapocs a nemzetek között, Erdélyi Napló, February 14, 2014 In 1997, the event was moved from Balvanyos to Tușnad (hence the Hungarian informal name Tusványos). Around 2000, it started turning from a political workshop into a student summer camp; some critics consider this had a negative effect on the event.

It is the oldest velodrome in the United Kingdom having been opened on 12 May 1877, and is the oldest, working velodrome in the world.  Characteristics  As well as being the first track in the UK, Preston Park is also the longest at 579m (1900 feet). It is one of the few velodromes which is not the normal oval shape, instead comprising four straights and two slightly banked corners. This is because there were no international velodrome standards until after Olympic track cycling grew in popularity after 1900, so early velodromes from the late 1800s came in all shapes and sizes.  Site of Special Historic Interest  The velodrome and cricket ground are included in land registered under the Historic Buildings and Ancient Monuments Act 1953 within the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens by Historic England for its special historic interest. The site was listed within the Register as a Grade II Park and Garden on 25 March 1987.  Construction  The velodrome is situated within Preston Park, Brighton, which was opened in 1884 following the purchase by Brighton Corporation of land from V F Bennett-Stanford in 1883 for £50,000. The entire park was laid out by the Corporation's Head Gardener, James Shrives and the Borough Engineer, Philip Lockwood, in 1883-4 and formally opened to the public on 8 November 1884. Construction then moved onto the velodrome and cricket ground site, which was previously a polo ground during the Stanfords' ownership, this use being transferred to the park's playing fields upon purchase by Brighton Corporation. A retaining bank in the north-east corner of the park was constructed to house the cricket ground and surrounding cycle track. The entire arena was dug out by hand by the British Army. Upon opening in 1887 the sports arena comprised a cricket pitch, surrounding cycle track, pavilion and open air, flint-edged seating for thousands of people. The velodrome was formally opened at a Whit Monday race meeting on 30 May 1887 with races including a 1 mile handicap, 3 mile handicap, half-mile scratch and a 1 mile tricycle handicap, with a 2 shilling entry fee and prizes of up to £7 for first places. The arena remains in use for both cricket and cycling to this day, the original Pavilion is still standing and the flint edged seating can still be seen around the North and Eastern sides of the track.  Improvements and renovation  In 1893 a concrete retaining wall was erected to support the embarnkment on the North West corner of the track at a cost of £50. A wooden grandstand with seating for 500 people was opened by mayor Horace Aldrich on 18 October 1930, paid for partly by a gift of Benjamin Saunders. In 1936 a tarmac surface was added, with the two banked corners added at the same time for safety reasons. In 2015 racing was forced to stop following a period when the track fell into general disrepair. Following rider concerns about safety issues it was deemed unsafe for racing by British Cycling in 2015 with the quality of track fencing being the main issue. While this didn't prevent recreational use of the track, it did mean that official racing had to stop, such as the Sussex Cycle Racing League. A successful Save Preston Park Cycle Track campaign was started by Cyclist and local Brighton Photographer Rupert Rivett, which was supported by former Tour de France cyclist and Team Sky sporting director Sean Yates. This was attended by many riders along with hundreds of supporters from the wider cycling community, demonstrating the value of this important amenity not just to cycling clubs and racing leagues but to local families and recreational cyclists who all use the velodrome regularly. In January 2016 British Cycling announced that it would contribute £110,000 of the £160,000 needed to repair and reopen the track, with the remainder of the required funding coming from Section 106 financial contributions made by developers as part of planning applications. The track reopened for racing in May 2016.  Tenants  = Current tenants = Preston Park Youth Cycling Club has used the site since its formation in 1998, catering for over 100 young members aged 8 to 18 and meeting between March and October every Saturday morning. Sussex Cycle Racing League has used the site since circa 2000, running a Wednesday night track league between April and August every year. This usually attracts between 60 and 80 competitors weekly and includes all types of events from scratch races, handicaps and points races to the more unusual keirins and devil-take-the-hindmost contests. = Occasional tenants = A number of other regional cycling clubs regularly hire the velodrome for coaching sessions including Brighton Mitre Cycling Club, East Grinstead Cycling Club and Crawley Wheelers. = Historical tenants = Prestonville Nomads, a cycling club founded in 1933 were based at the track from 1948 to 1967 and used the Park View Hotel, adjacent to the velodrome on Preston Drove, as their club room. = Notable users = Geraint Thomas (double Olympic champion, triple world champion and 2018 Tour de France champion) writes about Preston Park Velodrome in his book, The World According to G (2015): \\"As a kid it was all outdoor tracks, each of them with their own idiosyncrasies... The old stager in Brighton's Preston Park runs noticeably downhill in the last 100 metres. It also has a ten meter section where there is no barrier at the top of the track, just a two-metre drop-off to the walkway below.\\" Laura Kenny (four times Olympic champion and seven times World Champion) placed 2nd in the Preston Park Youth Omnium in 2006 and later went on to win consecutive Omnium gold medals at the Summer Olympics of 2012 and 2016 . Reg Harris (five times World Sprint champion and double Olympic silver medallist) raced at the track in the 1950s. On 7 August 1950 Harris rode his last race there before defending his World Sprint title in Belgium the following week. He was reportedly in fine form, beating Belgian sprint champion Franz van Looveren and American sprint champion Jackie Heid in each of 5 encounters and recorded a time of 1 min 15.4 secs in the 1,000 meter, standing-start time trial. He also competed at the track on 4 August 1952, comfortably winning all three of his races against Arie van Fliet (Holland) and Sid Patterson (Australia). Harris returned to Brighton in 1957 in different circumstances as the driver of a 1904 Raleighette vintage car in the annual London to Brighton vintage car run.  Events  The velodrome hosts a full calendar of regional racing events organised via the Sussex Cycle Racing League. At the heart of this are weekly racing events throughout the season from March to August, including the Sussex Cycle Racing League on Wednesday nights, Vets and Women's racing on Friday nights and women's racing on Sunday mornings. The velodrome is also used for National-level racing and regularly hosts rounds of the National Youth Track Omnium series, as part of the British Cycling National Track Series, providing opportunities for the country's most promising youth riders. Notable, Laura Kenny (née Trott) placed 2nd at Preston Park in 2006 before going on to win consecutive Summer Olympics gold medals in 2012 and 2016. Historically, attendees of 3000-5000 spectators were a regular occurrence with the largest recorded attendance reaching 8,000 on August 4, 1952 to see world champion Reg Harris in action. Bank Holiday open race meetings were a regular occurrence, typically organised by Brighton Cyclist Club, Brighton Stanley Wanderers Cycling Club or Brighton Mitre Cycling Club, which would feature handicaps and scratch races over half mile, 1 mile and 3 mile distances, often with some athletics races alongside. Some sources put bank holiday race attendances as high as 10,000 spectators.  Other uses  St Peters Cricket Club, formed in 1883, has been using the arena since moving to Preston Park in 1889. In 2013 the club agreed a 20 year lease with Brighton and Hove City Council for both the clubhouse and the upkeep of the two cricket squares. Marco Lincoln is the current Club captain for St Peters and has been since 2011. In that time he has taken 9 wickets and amassed a total of 103 runs. The arena has also been used for athletics meetings, including an England versus France international on 25 July 1925.

Currently, the city has 4 AM and 11 FM radio stations operated by All India Radio, Anna University and Suryan FM, Radio Mirchi, BIG FM, Hello FM, Radio City, Radio One among others. History Broadcasting in India began in June 1923 during the British Raj with programmes by the Bombay Presidency Radio Club and other radio clubs. In 1924, the Madras Presidency Radio Club was established by V. Krishnaswamy Chetty. It made its first broadcast from Holloway’s Garden in Egmore on 31 July 1924. The Club later faced some financial difficulties but was rescued by the Madras Municipal Corporation in 1927, which ran it till All India Radio was established in Madras in 1938. The radio station at the Ripon Building complex was founded in 1930. According to an agreement of 23 July 1927, the private Indian Broadcasting Company LTD (IBC) was authorised to operate two radio stations: the Bombay station began on 23 July 1927, and the Calcutta station followed on 26 August 1927. The company went into liquidation on 1 March 1930. The government took over the broadcasting facilities and began the Indian State Broadcasting Service (ISBS) on 1 April 1930 on an experimental basis for two years and permanently in May 1932. On 8 June 1936, the ISBS was renamed All India Radio. All India Radio Madras began its operations on 16 June 1938. It became one of the six operational stations in the AIR network in the country when India gained independence in 1947, along with Delhi, Bombay, Calcutta, Lucknow, and Tiruchirappalli. The total number of radio sets at that time was about 275,000 in India. The Vividh Bharati Service was launched on 3 October 1957 to compete with Radio Ceylon. AIR Madras became the first station in the country to begin FM broadcasting on 23 July 1977, which was later expanded during the 1990s.

Among the public offices Koni held was prosecutor at the district court of Kharkiv since 1867, vice director of the Ministry of Justice since 1875, presiding judge of the district court of Saint Petersburg since 1878, and member of the State Council since 1907.

Koni led the investigation into the 1888 Borki train disaster and presided over the 1878 jury trial against the revolutionary and attempted assassin Vera Zasulich. As a jurist, Koni was instrumental in liberalizing Russian criminal law, notably in the form of the revised criminal code of 1903. As a member of several reform commissions, he defended judicial independence and the trial by jury. Due to his influence, prison sentences were reduced and special establishments for juvenile criminals were introduced towards the end of the 19th century. While he supported the liberals' call for a constitutional order in Russia, he declined an appointment as Minister of Justice in the government of Pyotr Stolypin in 1906.

She ran nine times as a juvenile in 1886, winning three races including an upset victory in the Dewhurst Plate in October. In the following year she won nine races including the 1000 Guineas, Oaks Stakes, Sussex Stakes, York Queen's Plate, Yorkshire Oaks, Great Foal Stakes and Newmarket Oaks. She remained in training until the age of seven, winning the Jockey Club Cup in 1888 and the City and Suburban Handicap in 1890. She had limited success as a broodmare in France. Background Reve d'Or was a chestnut mare bred and owned by Henry Somerset, 8th Duke of Beaufort. The filly was sent into training with Alec Taylor Sr. at Manton in Wiltshire. Her sire, Hampton was an excellent stayer who won both the Goodwood Cup and the Doncaster Cup. Hampton was Champion sire in 1887 and sired, in addition to Merry Hampton, the Derby winners Merry Hampton, Ladas and Ayrshire as well as the influential sires Bay Ronald and Royal Hampton. Reve d'Or's dam, Queen of the Roses, was a granddaughter of the Irish broodmare Maria (foaled 1845), making her a distant relative of The Finn and Wintergreen. Queen of the Roses had once been sold for £30 and was then acquired almost as cheaply by the Duke of Beaufort. Racing career =1886: two-year-old season= Reve d'Or's owner, the 8th Duke of Beaufort In her first major test, Reve d'Or finished third to Timothy in the Stockbrige Post Sweepstakes at Stockbridge Racecourse in June and then contested a Rous Memorial Stakes over six furlongs at Goodwood Racecourse on 29 July in which ran unplaced behind Mamia. She then won the Bretty Stakes at Derby Racecourse, upsetting the 1/20 favourite Kilwarlin. On 1 October at Newmarket Racecourse the filly started 7/2 favourite for another Rous Memorial but was unplaced again. At the end of the month at Newmarket she ran third to Caller Herrin in the Criterion Stakes. and then won the Home-bred Produce Stakes. Reve d'Or was then stepped up in class for the seven furlong Dewhurst Plate at the same meeting and started a 20/1 outsider in a ten-runner field which included Florentine (winner of the Middle Park Plate), Enterprise (July Stakes) and Freedom (Molecomb Stakes). Ridden by Charles Wood she tracked the leaders before going to the front approaching the final furlong and drew away in the closing stages to win by three lengths from Enterprise. Reve d'Or was beaten in three other races in 1886. =1887: three-year-old season= Charles Wood, who rode Reve d'Or to victory in two classic races On 29 April Reve d'Or, with Wood in the saddle, started the even money favourite for the 74th running of the 1000 Guineas over the Rowley Mile at Newmarket. The best fancied of her eleven rival were Agave, Lord Zetland's Gale, Edoardo Ginistrelli's Ginestra and Lord Bradford's Tactic. Reve d'Or was settled just behind the leaders as first St Mary, then Agnostic, then Porcelain made the running. She took the lead entering the last quarter mile and after a \\"good race\\" won by half a length from Porcelain, with Freedom the same distance away in third place. Reve d'Or was then stepped up in distance for the 109th running of the Oaks Stakes over one and a half miles at Epsom Racecourse. She started the 8/11 favourite ahead of Lady Muncaster, with Freedom and Hawthorn being the only others in the nine-runner field to start at less that 25/1. Reve d'Or was settled by Wood in mid-division before making steady progress and turned into the straight in second place behind the 40/1 outsider St Helen. The favourite overtook the outsider inside the last quarter mile and drew away to win \\"in a canter\\" by three lengths with a long gap back to Freedom in third. Shortly afterwards she ran in a five furlong sprint race at Sandown Park Racecourse leading to claims that she was being \\"egregiously messed about\\" by her connections. At Royal Ascot on 7 June Reve d'Or was matched against male opposition in the Prince of Wales's Stakes, which was then run over thirteen furlongs and restricted to three-year-olds. She finished second to the colt Claymore in race which was ruined as a contest when a frightened police horse swerved across the track, hampering several of the runners. The Gold Cup two days later was another unsatisfactory race: the pacemaker Bird of Freedom was allowed to open up a huge lead and was never seriously challenged, winning by three lengths with Reve d'Or finishing at the rear of the six-runner field. Reve d'Or ran twice at Goodwood, winning the Sussex Stakes on 27 July at odds of 4/9 from the colts Scottish King and Devilshoof, but being beaten by the outsider Maize in the Nassau Stakes. In August at York Racecourse in August Reve d'Or defeated Maize \\"in a canter\\" to win the Yorkshire Oaks at odds of 1/4. At the same meeting she was matched against the five-year-old mare Merry Duchess (winner of the City and Suburban Handicap) in the Queen's Plate over two miles. Exiting the paddock she reared up, throwing Wood from the saddle and breaking her bridle, thereby causing a considerable delay. When the race eventually began she quickly opened up a clear lead and won \\"easily\\" by a length. At Doncaster Racecourse in September she was beaten by a head by Porcelain in the Park Hill Stakes. At the end of the month she returned to winning form by taking the Great Foal Stakes at Newmarket, and went on to win the Newmarket Oaks in October. In the Cambridgeshire Handicap she again threw off her jockey on the way to the start before finishing tenth behind Gloriation. Reve d'Or won at least two other races in 1887 to end the year with winnings of £10,559. =1888–1891: later career= At Manchester Racecourse on 25 May 1988 Reve d'Or finished unplaced under top weight of 120 pounds in the fourteen furlong Manchester Cup. She started 2/1 favourite in her second attempt to win the Ascot Gold Cup on 14 June but came home at the rear of the five-runner field behind Timothy. On 9 October at Newmarket she finished unplaced under 121 pounds in the Cesarewitch. Two weeks later she ran unplaced in the Cambridgeshire but in the Jockey Club Cup at the same meeting she won the Jockey Club Cup at odds of 1/2, beating her only rival Cotillon by half a length. In 1889, Reve d'Or began her fourth season by again finishing unplaced in the Manchester Cup, run that year on 14 June. In November she finished second to Philomel in the Autumn Cup at Liverpool. On 23 April 1890, Reve d'Or, by now a six-year-old, was assigned a weight of 111 pounds in the City and Suburban Handicap at Epsom. Ridden by Mornington Cannon she hampered several of her opponents when veering to the right in the closing stages but prevailed by a neck from French-bred Vasistas. The racecourse stewards held an enquiry but allowed the result to stand. In May she was unplaced for a third time in the Manchester Cup, with the race being won by L'Abbesse de Jouarre. Later that year she ran unplaced in the Ascot Gold Vase, Royal Hunt Cup, Goodwood Cup and Liverpool Autumn Cup. Despite reports that she was to be retired at the end of 1890 Reve d'Or returned in April 1891 and finished fourth in the City and Suburban Handicap. before running unplaced at Sandown a day later. At Goodwood on 31 July she was unplaced in the Chesterfield Cup. Breeding record At the end of her racing career, Reve d'Or was retired to become a broodmare and was deported to France. She produced at least seven foals: *Reve d'Amour, a brown mare, foaled in 1894, sired by Petronel *Regate, chestnut mare, 1898, by Xantrailles.

The prisoners were falsely promised that they would be set free from the prison if they completed the experiment. The subjects behaved as usual during the initial days, talking to each other and whispering to the researchers through the one-way glass, though it was noted that their discussions gradually became darker in subject matter. After nine days, one subject began screaming uncontrollably for hours while the others had no reaction to his outburst. The man screamed for so long that he tore his vocal cords. The man didn’t know why he was screaming. He was paralyzed. When the second one started screaming, the others prevented the researchers from looking inside by pasting torn book pages and their own feces on the porthole windows. A few days passed without the researchers being able to look inside, during which the chamber was completely silent. The researchers used the intercom to test if the subjects were still alive, and got a short response of a subject expressing compliance. On the 15th day, the researchers decided to turn off the stimulating gas and reopen the chamber. The subjects did not want the gas to turn off, for fear they would fall asleep. Upon looking inside, they discover that the four surviving subjects have performed lethal and severe mutilation and disembowelment on themselves during the past days, including tearing off flesh and muscles, removing multiple abdominal internal organs, practicing self-cannibalism, and allowing of blood and water to accumulate on the floor by jamming pieces of flesh from the first subject into the drain, who was found dead on the floor as soon as the chamber was opened. The subjects also violently refuse to leave the chamber and begged the scientists to continue administering the stimulant, murdering one soldier and severely injuring another that attempted to remove them. After eventually being removed from the chamber, all subjects were shown to exhibit extreme strength, unprecedented resistance to drugs and sedatives, the ability to remain alive despite lethal injuries, and a desperate desire to stay awake and be given the stimulant. It was also found that if any one of the subjects fell asleep, they would die. After being somewhat treated for their severe injuries, the surviving three subjects were prepared to return to the gas chamber with the stimulant by the orders of the military officials (though against the will of the researchers), with EKG monitors showing short recurring moments of brain death. Before the chamber was sealed, one of the subjects fell asleep and died, and the only subject that could speak screamed to be immediately sealed in the chamber. The military commander ordered for three other researchers to be closed inside the chamber along side the two remaining subjects. One researcher immediately drew his gun and killed the commander and the mute subject by shooting both of them in the head, causing the other personnel to flee the room. With only one surviving subject, the terrified researcher explained that he would not allow himself to be locked in a room with monsters that could no longer be called people. He desperately asked what the subject was, to which the subject smiled and identified himself and the other fallen subjects as an inherent evil inside the human mind that is kept in check by the act of sleeping. After a brief pause, the researcher shot the prisoner in the heart, and with his dying breath on the floor, the subject muttered his final words; \\"So...nearly...free...\\" Popularity The Russian Sleep Experiment became immensely popular upon its original publication. It is considered by some to be the greatest and most shared creepypasta story ever. Much of the online and offline debate surrounds the belief held by many that the story is real rather than fiction, and many articles therefore seek to debunk this claim. It has also sparked more general discussion of the viral nature of creepypasta stories. The creepypasta is often shared alongside an image of a grotesque, demonic figure, which is implied to be one of the test subjects. The image is actually of a life-size animatronic Halloween prop called \\"Spasm\\". Adaptations The Russian Sleep Experiment's popularity has led to various adaptations over the years. A novel inspired by the original short story was published in 2015 but is now out-of- print. In early 2018, a psychological thriller based on the short story began production, directed by John Farrelly, and is set to be released in 2020. Several other adaptations have been created, including a film based on the short story, with Chris Kattan starring and Barry Andersson directing.

A brutal and despotic man, after just over a year he was murdered by a Carib, as were most of the other colonists. Accounts of the events and aftermath are somewhat confused, gathered from the few survivors several years later. Life Map of the Island of Cayenne and its surroundings in 1729. North to the right. Charles Poncet, seigneur de Brétigny was born around 1610. Poncet de Brétigny was appointed admiral, lieutenant-general of King Louis XIII of France and head of the Compagnie de Rouen(fr). Poncet de Brétigny led a group of colonists to Cayenne for the company, also called the Compagnie du Cap au nord. His objective was to found new settlements at Cap Nord and on the Maroni River. He disembarked on Cayenne Island on 4 March 1644, and collected the remains of the first settlers, men who had adopted the customs and language of the local Galibi people. Brétigny landed with 400 men at the cove of Armire, later the site of the city of Remire-Montjoly. After two days' march along the coast he chose the Morne Cépérou, a hill on the coast at the mouth of the Cayenne River as the site for what would become the city of Cayenne. He purchased the hill from Cépérou, chief of the Amerindian tribe of Galibi people (Caribs). The first wooden Fort Cépérou was built on the hill, and a village was built below it. The three hundred men he had brought were, apart from a few officers, vagabonds and fortune hunters rather than artisans and farmers. Brétigny was governor of Cayenne from 4 March 1644 until June 1645. He was ruthless and despotic, and terrorized both the colonists and the indigenous people. He seems to have been a mentally unstable megalomaniac. De Bretigny soon began to behave as if he were in possession of an organized kingdom. He appointed a captain of the guards, a squire and a chancellor. He had an iron stamp made with his name to brand the front of colonists who disobeyed him. He had eight soldiers broken for the most frivolous reasons, and another received the strap for having picked up a sprig of pepper. The indigenous people were treated no better, and soon planned an uprising. Death One source says a Galibi woman warned Bretigny of the plot, who had some of the Galibis arrested, but others escaped and swam to the mainland. Bretigny pursued them in a canoe, captured them and held them in a grass hut. The next day he found himself surrounded by a large number of Indians who shot and killed him with arrows. The natives then went to the Island of Cayenne, where they burned the harvests and massacred the colonists. Another source says Brétigny was killed by an Amerindian named Pagaret in a savanna near to Cayenne, which has preserved this name. His head was split open by an axe. Most of the Europeans were killed by the Caribs, and the village of Cayenne was destroyed. Aftermath Some missionaries and forty men managed to escape. In November of that year the Company of Rouen sent forty men to the colony under the sieur Laforét. All of them were massacred the next month apart from one man named Le Vendangeur who got away to Suriname and from there returned to France. In September 1652 the twelve seigneurs of the Compagnie de la France équinoxiale landed 800 men at the tip of the Pointe du Mahury, where they found 25 survivors from the previous expedition. The found a Monsieur de Navarre in command of Fort Cépérou. He had arrived there from France about six months earlier, and was a first sergeant. He was promoted to lieutenant for surrendering the fort to the new arrivals. All of the new settlers were soon killed by the Caribs or had escaped to Barbados.

History The company was founded in Manoppello, in eastern Italy, in 1982, by Nicola Di Sipio. In 1995 a new challenge arrived: the design and the production of friction material for brake discs; it started from the taking over of the company Permafuse, located in Turin, aiming to become the OE supplier of the most important car manufacturing industries. The growing path has been marked by important investment in R&D;, partnership with research centres and universities, advanced production plants, with the constant goal of \\"doing it good\\", always in order to do. In 2005 Raicam enlarged its products range by taking over AP Automotive Products SrL, a leader company for the design, development and manufacturing of clutches; also in 2009 it took over AP Driveline Technologies Ltd, today named Raicam Clutch Ltd, and thus gaining a 100 years history of brakes and clutches top quality manufacturing. In 2008 for the first time Fiat 500 was assembled with Raicam clutches and brakes: a big achievement for an OE supplier. In 2015 Raicam has extended in the Asian market by setting up the first R&D; centre in India, in order to support the local car manufacturing industries; in 2016 the Indian plant started its production for supplying the OE local market. 28 March 2018 – Raicam has completed the acquisition of the Hydraulic Actuator Business from Valeo.

It was built from 1830 to 1850. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The site itself may date from the 1830s.WCC, 2012 Little Milton is thought to be the earliest surviving cottage in the urban portion of Wollongong, with the earliest surviving section of the complex dating from the 1850s ( additions). The original building was acquired soon after completion by Rev. George Charter, Wollongong's first Congregationalist Minister. It was built in the plain bungalow style. The once large grounds lent themselves to full domestic existence: coach house, stables, croquet lawn, tennis court, vegetable and flower gardens and sweeping lawns with flag pole; the Union Jack was raised to honour the British Empire on every appropriate day, including even Trafalgar Day. They worked for their church, and even kept a church garden, where only white flowers were grown, for the altar. They were devoted and lifelong workers for charity. Apart from sports like tennis and golf, at which they excelled, their recreations were dancing, music, singing, games and handcrafts such as spinning and knitting. In the 1880s (variously described as 1883 or 1886)(Beale and WCC (2012) both say 1886) it was purchased by English doctor, Dr Timothy Wood Lee, and extended to its present form (with a \\"northern\\" wing running right out to the footpath) for his use as a surgery and residence. He practiced there for over three decades. His daughters kept on the house until their deaths. In 1970 it was acquired by Mr and Mrs Seymour. In 1971 the property was inherited (willed to) three charities: Greenacres, the Crippled Children's Society (CCS) and the Anglican Church Mission. The property was due for auction in September 1973. Wollongong City Council and the Illawarra Historical Society asked the Perpetual Trustee Co. Ltd. to defer the auction to allow the National Trust of Australia (NSW) to evaluate if the property was worth restoring. The Trust and the Historical Society could not agree. The Trust felt the brick section was the only part worth restoring, but the Society wanted the whole building restored. There was a seven-month delay before the auction, as a single unit, occurred in April 1974. By then the bottom had fallen out of the real estate market and bidders would not consider the $200,000 reserve price sought. Council had drawn up plans for subdivision before the auction. One of the conditions of sale was that the buyer would donate the building and surrounding land to Council to renovate and preserve for posterity. The buyer would be able to develop on the remaining land. When the property did not sell, Council decided to conduct a Lord Mayor's appeal to raise funds for the restoration, but this did not eventuate. From 1974 until 1977 the property was on the real estate market by Perpetual Trustee Co. Ltd. for sale in two lots, 1) house and surrounding land (993.8sq.m.); and 2) a battle axe block with access to Smith Street (1896 sq.m.). The principal beneficiaries (Greenacres, CCS and the Anglican Church Mission) noted the property was costing them $5000 a year to maintain. Mr R. Henderson of CCS said the bank loan and interest taken out in 1973 to keep Little Milton occupied and maintained and pay the smaller beneficiaries of the will (about $15,000) was the main cause of the debt. Land taxes, rates, insurance and caretaker wages were also drawing heavily on the estate. In March 1977, the beneficiaries offered Little Milton to Wollongong City Council for $135,000 but Council rejected the offer. As a final effort to rid themselves of the property, the beneficiaries decided to try to auction the property in the two subdivisions (land parcels) worked out by Council in 1974. In 1979 Mr. & Mrs G. & C. V. A. Seymour, in seeking financial assistance, nominated the property for protection under the Heritage Act, 1977. They restored the building, replacing verandah flooring, controlling rising damp, electrical rewiring, plastering, painting, plumbing and repairs to boarding and roofs. Terminites and borers had led to general deterioration of house fabric at this time. In 1980 a grant of $3,000 was provided to engage a consultant to prepare a restoration plan of Little Milton. A further $10,000 loan was offered but not accepted. In recognition of its heritage significance and to protect the building from redevelopment and from possible road works to Smith Street a Permanent Conservation Order was placed over the property on 9 September 1983. In 1992, the owners received approval to renew the existing roof, add a new attic room and carry out general maintenance. It was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999. Little Milton was sold for between $900,000 and $1 million in 2008. In 2018, the building houses medical offices.  Description  Little Milton is an old bungalow-type dwelling with pitched and hipped roofs, standing some 12.2m from the footpath on approximately 0.3ha of land. The site is believed to date from the 1830s, with additions around 1855 and the northern wing in 1886. The front garden comprises two large camphor laurel trees (Cinnamomum camphora), a mature Cabbage tree palm (Livistona australis), a Canary Island date palm (Phoenix canariensis) which has been parasitised by an adventitious seedling fig (Ficus rubiginosa) that has reached great size, encircling the palm's trunk. A low wooden picket fence and gates face Smith Street. Gravel paths and low box (Buxus sempervirens) hedge-edged beds face a circular space between the 1850s bungalow \\"house\\" and the northern wing to its right. The 1850s portion of Little Milton consisted of a single-storey residence (the early part in sandstone and (heavily cream-) rendered brick with a shingle roof )Seymour, 1979and a two-storey servants and services building adjacent to it. Both buildings have rendered and whitewashed walls and corrugated iron roofs. The residence has a hipped roof penetrated by two chimneys as well as French doors leading out onto a surrounding verandah. The services building has a pitched roof with simply detailed barge boards. In the 1880s ( 1886)a single storey building wing was added to the west extending from the street alignment)WCC Health Surveyor's Report, 8/2/1977 with exposed (weathered apricot-coloured) sandstock brick-work, a pitched (iron) roof and decorative barge boards was added on the street side of the services wing. A lean-to verandah with champhered posts and a cast iron valence was erected to integrate the old and new structures. At this time it is probable that a timber framed and glazed conservatory was added behind the residence, enclosing an early well.Branch Managers Report to the Heritage Council, 4 May 1983 Two doors in the northern facade of this western wing open directly onto the footpath, giving access to the surgery. A pedestrian path immediately to the west of the 1886 wing gave patients access to the Doctor's waiting room, located in the rear room of the 1850s bungalow). Internal cedar joineryincluding chimney piece in room to right of front door; cabinets in same room. In the south-western corner is a two-storey servants' and services building, comprising a large kitchen or laundry area with a (small) cellar below and a large attic above (converted into two bedrooms). This part of the building was probably contemporary with the bungalow section, erected in c.1907. An appendage at the rear (east) of the bungalow section is what was formerly used as a billiard room (NB: this has since been demolished to ground level, the brick-lined well (original) surviving below a plasterboard cover (former floor). Another small wing extension to the north-east at the bungalow's rear may date to the 1940s. A small timber-framed fibro area formerly existed within the western wing, but this has been demolished and is now an open courtyard. The rear garden dates from the 1970s subdivision (a battle-axe block with flats on it was built), comprising four Hill's figs (Ficus microcarpa var. Hillii) for screening, four Leyland Green cypress (x Cuprocyparis leylandii 'Leighton's Green') in the south-western corner to screen another block of flats to the south, a raised terrace and one mature but unfortunately dead bangalow palm (Archontophoenix cunninghamiana).  Heritage listing  Little Milton is thought to be the earliest surviving cottage in the urban section of Wollongong. The first section of the house complex was constructed in the 1850s.Branch Managers Report to the Heritage Council 4 May 1983 Little Milton was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Description The sculpture is situated in an area of Fælledparken known as Den Franske Plads (The French Square). It depicts rwo lions, one male and one female. The male lion stands up while its female counterpart is lying down. History The sculpture was created by in 1905 and a bronze cast of the sculpture was subsequently presented to the City of Copenhagen by the Victor Freund Grant (Victor Freunds Legat). Jensen wanted the sculpture placed at Langelinie and a location in Søndermarken was also considered but it was ultimately installed in the garden complex at present-day Israels Plads. The sculpture was later moved to a new location outside the entrance to Fælledparken on Østerbrogade. Another reason for the move was fear that a tail might break or bend, or that it might suffer other damage, since local use tended to use it for \\"gymnastic exercises\\". In 1915 it was proposed to protect it at its new location by installing a surrounding rough iron fence. The sculpture was moved to a small mound a little further to the west when the site was redesigned in 2010. In 2012 the sculpture was moved to its current location close to Serridslevvej in Fælledparken.

Carmel Avenue in Hamden, Connecticut. Built about 1795 by the grandson of an early settler of the area, it is a well-preserved and unusual example of late Georgian architecture. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1982. It is now owned and operated by the local historical society. It was heavily damaged by a tornado in 2018, but a new house has been built on the same lot. Description and history The Jonathan Dickerman II House is located in northern Hamden, oriented facing west on the south side of Mt. Carmel Avenue just west of the Quinnipiac College campus. It is a 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with a gabled roof, central chimney, and clapboarded exterior. Unusual for a two-story house of this period, the front roof face extends to just above the first floor, and flares outward at the eave. The main facade is five bays wide, with windows arranged symmetrically around the center entrance. The entrance is also unusual for the period, with a double- leaf paneled door with glazed top panels. The interior follows a fairly typical center chimney plan, although it lacks the winding stair typically found in the entry vestibule. It retains many original period finishes, and has been fitted with displays of period furnishings. With Jonathan Dickerman I was one of the first people to settle in what is now Hamden, building on land purchased by his father Abraham in the 18th century's second quarter. His son built this house, most likely in 1795 after selling an older house it is sometimes confused with. It passed out of the family in 1835, and was used as a year-round residence until 1907. From 1924 to about 1961 it was used by the adjacent Sleeping Giant State Park as a seasonal staff residence. The historical society was given the house in 1961, with the understanding that it would be moved across the street as part of a road straightening project.

It is part of a larger heat wave affecting the northern hemisphere, caused in part by the jet stream being weaker than usual, allowing hot high-pressure air to linger in the same place. According to the European Drought Observatory, most of the areas affected by drought are across northern and central Europe. General Researchers at the Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute and World Weather Attribution estimated that global warming more than doubled the overall likelihood of the heat wave, and in some places like Denmark made it up to five times as likely.\\"We estimate that the probability to have such a heat or higher is generally more than two times higher today than if human activities had not altered climate.\\" The heat has built up for two months due to slow and weakened jet stream. One possible cause for the jet stream to be slow and weak relates to global warming. In the polar regions, the average surface temperature is rising more quickly than at mid latitudes in a phenomenon called polar amplification. Many researchers believe a strong polar amplification reduces the strength and changes the pattern of the jet stream, producing patterns like those occurring during the 2018 heat wave. Dr. Michael Mann opined that global warming may be making such heat waves even more likely than the researchers estimated, because at the time of the study the climate models could not fully account for how the jet stream is affected by global warming. The extreme heat was blamed for forest fires and crop failures. According to the World Meteorological Organization, the severe heat waves across the northern hemisphere in the summer of 2018, are linked to climate change, as well as events of extreme precipitation. Results were increase in elderly mortality; severe decline in yields; the biggest algae bloom in the Baltic sea for decades, that has poisoned water both for human and animals use; shutdowns of nuclear power plants in Europe, because the water in the rivers, that is used for cooling the reactors, was too warm; and electricity grids crashing across four continents. The impacts were severe, even in the countries considered rich and well prepared to deal with the impacts of climate change. By country Rank of the highest max temperature of the 2018 summer in Europe, until August. Dark red means record high since 1950, bright red second place etc. The parched landscape of northwestern Europe, 15 July 2018 North-Central Europe on 19 July 2017 (left) and 24 July 2018 (right) =Austria= The west and the north of Austria were worst affected by drought; certain areas in these regions experienced up to 85% less rainfall than the 10 year average. Insurance companies estimate the damage as high as 210 million euro. Note: As of 7 August 2018. =Belgium= Belgium experienced the second hottest July since regular measurements started in 1833, with an average of 22 °C. Precipitation during July was close to normal at the official weather station in Uccle; most regions however received less than 20% of the normal amount of rain for the month, which was especially true for the western part of the country. As a whole, 2 heat waves occurred: the first one between 13 and 27 July (making this the fifth longest heat wave in history) and the second one from 29 July until 7 August. Belgium's official weather service, the KMI, defines a heat wave as a period of at least 5 days with maximum temperatures of 25 °C or higher, of which 3 days require a maximum of 30 °C or more. =Croatia= Zagreb saw 19 nights in a row where temperature did not fall under , breaking the previous record that was set in the 2013 heat wave. Despite the lack of extreme temperatures seen , the 2018 summer saw temperatures averaging above the mean at all official weather stations and the year as a whole was the hottest on record in Zagreb, which has the tenth oldest contiguously monitoring weather station in the world, operating since 1861. =Denmark= The Danish summer was exceptionally dry and warm, and several records were broken: According to the Danish Meteorological Institute, May 2018 had the highest average temperature ever recorded for the month, beating the old record by (recording began in 1879), the highest number of sunny hours recorded in the month (recording began in 1920), the highest temperature recorded in Copenhagen in the month (recording began in 1879), and it was the driest May in a decade. June had the highest average temperature in 26 years and it was the third driest since recording began in 1920. July was the sunniest ever recorded (recording began in 1920), and it was one of the driest and warmest ever recorded (recording began in 1879). The night between 30 and 31 July was the second-warmest on record. Heat increases the risk of cardiac arrest and other serious conditions in people with poor health. On 8 August, Statens Serum Institut released a report that showed an increase of about 250 deaths, primarily among elderly, in the summer of 2018 (peak in late July) compared to the norm. A similar increase was seen in neighbouring countries affected by the heat wave, including other Scandinavian countries. The unusually low water-levels in the Gudenå, the longest Danish river, led to fears that the SS Hjejlen would run aground. Because of the drought, farmers experienced a significantly reduced harvest. Outside fires and most types of barbecue grills were initially banned locally and later throughout the country due to the risk of fire. A total of 845 wildfires, both small and large, were recorded from 1 May to 5 July, which is about 500 more than the usual. In July alone there were more than 1,000 wildfires, or almost as many as typical of an entire year. Many foreign tourists, apparently unaware of the record-breaking weather, complained about the lack of air conditioning in hotels, which usually is unnecessary. =Finland= Finland experienced very high temperatures and drought, and like its neighbouring Scandinavian countries, several wildfires occurred. Its northernmost municipality of Utsjoki, north of the Arctic Circle, experienced a record-breaking temperature of in July. =France= The French utility company EDF made known that on the morning of 4 August 2018 it had to shut down reactor number one of the Fessenheim Nuclear Power Plant. This was necessary because the nearby river which is used for cooling water had reached a critical temperature. Note: As of 4 August 2018. The white storks in the Alsace region have also been suffering under the drought and heat waves. The 2018 stork generation is generally malnourished. Many are too weak to fly and crash-land when they leave the nest, resulting in fatal injuries like broken legs or wings. Note: As of 4 August 2018. =Germany= Both April and May set new temperature records as the warmest April and May since modern record- keeping began in 1881. June experienced continued heat, with average temperatures above the 1961-1990 mean, while receiving only 57% of expected rainfall; July experienced average temperatures above the reference period and 52% of the expected rain, making it the fourth-warmest July since modern record-keeping began. The period from April–July is also the hottest and driest on record. The heat also caused the deaths of many freshwater fish due to reduced oxygen levels in rivers and ponds, causing firefighters to pump in more water in order to raise the levels. Near Hamburg, almost five tonnes of dead fish were collected by German authorities. On 26 July, regions in Western Germany hit ; on 31 July 2018, the heat traveled further east where some regions hit . The Rhine and Elbe river recorded high water temperatures causing fish to suffocate, and low water levels made shipping worse. The overnight low in Berlin between 31 July and 1 August was , the city's warmest night since 1905. On 31 July, temperature reached in Bernburg, coming shy of the all-time German temperature record set in 2015. Also on 31 July, the country experienced average highs of . German farmers have seen the drought affect their crops, potentially ruining harvests and forcing many to harvest early. There are fears many face bankruptcy in the event of a crop failure. The German Farmer's Association have asked the government for over one billion euros in financial aid, as the expected harvest of rapeseed is down by 30% on last year and grain down by 20%. Many German nuclear power plants reduced their electricity output, as the river temperatures were too warm to safely absorb the full amount of waste heat from their cooling systems without causing environmental damage (such as fish kills). =Greece= On 23 July, wildfires started in the areas of Attica, killing 100 people, and destroyed or damaged over 1,000 buildings. These are the deadliest wildfires in Greece in living memory. On 24 July rescuers found 26 bodies near Mati, in the Attica region. On 24 July a state of emergency was declared near Athens by the government. The cause of the fires is thought to be arson along with the heatwave causing the hot conditions. The Culture Ministry closed the Acropolis between 2:00 and 5:00 pm. local time on 23 July, since in Greek law, public sites can be closed if temperatures reach to prevent ill health. =Hungary= Water levels on the Danube were extremely low, even breaking records in Central Hungary (Ercsi, Dunaföldvár, and Dunaújváros) =Ireland= Met Éireann recorded the highest June temperature in more than 40 years. An 11-day heatwave was recorded, making it the longest heatwave in 20 years. =Italy= A heat wave struck the entire country, while 8 people died in Genoa.I morti per il caldo nelle città italiane =Latvia= Latvia has seen fires that have destroyed around of land including peat bog, scrubland and forest. =Lithuania= The Lithuanian government declared a state of emergency for drought. =Netherlands= In the Netherlands, a heat wave is defined as a period of at least five consecutive days are so called ‘summery days’ (days on which the daily maximum temperature is at least ), of which at least three days are ‘tropical’ (days on which the daily maximum temperature is at least ). The Netherlands experienced a heat wave of 13 days starting with 15 July and to 27 July inclusive, the country's longest since the European heat wave of 2006. The highest temperature of was measured in Arcen, Limburg, on 26 July. In many parts of the country authorities were planning for measures in case of water shortages. A second heat wave started on 29 July, lasting 10 days until 7 August inclusive. =Norway= The Norwegian government has imposed water restrictions and the cost of electricity is expected to rise due to a high dependency on hydro-electric generation. In the Banak peninsula in northern Norway a temperature of was recorded on 30 July 2018, which is considered extremely unusual for a region located north of the Arctic Circle. In the first half of July there have been more than 40 forest fires. Oslo experienced its warmest summer day for 80 years with the maximum of =Poland= Polish authorities banned swimming at more than 50 beaches, due to the outbreak of toxic cyanobacteria, forming in warmer waters. =Portugal and Spain= Portugal and Spain experienced record temperatures. Portugal's average high temperature was above for 3 consecutive days (40.1 °C, 40.9 °C and 41.6 °C, respectively 2, 3 and 4 August) and 6 different municipalities recorded temperatures at or above with being recorded at Alvega on 4 August. Lisbon set the highest temperature of on 4 August. In Spain, 9 people died due to the heat wave.Nueve fallecidos por la ola de calor en España The 2018 heat wave in Catalonia took place from 25 July to 6 August. After three very dry years, drought conditions in Catalonia were widespread, but the rain of the first four months of the 2018 was higher than the climatic average and the agriculture recovered from the water deficit. The spring was not very warm and the heat of summer came suddenly. July was warm. The first heat wave did not produce deaths, but the second one was really deadly: the Public Health Agency of Catalonia (Aspcat) estimated that 23 people died from heat stroke. Most of the deaths were in the same city of Barcelona (eleven), six in the province of Barcelona, four in Tarragona-Terres de l'Ebre, one in Girona and one in Lleida. Ten people suffered heat stroke at home, thirteen on the street and six were at work or doing sport activities. The 'Health care telephone' received 453 calls during the heat wave related to the high temperature. Blood donations fall 40% due to the heat wave. According to the Meteorological Service of Catalonia, the warmest days were 4 and 5 August. On Saturday 4, 42.3 °C were reached at the Ebre Observatory (Roquetes, Baix Ebre), 41.4 °C at Benissanet (Ribera d'Ebre) and values from 38 °C to 40 °C were recorded in various coastal areas and even by the sea. On Sunday 5, very high registers were repeated in the same sectors, up to 41.6 °C in Vinebre (Ribera d'Ebre). The minimum temperature also stayed very high during the weekend, with some values around 30 °C in the Empordà coast (NE of Catalonia) and in the center of the city of Barcelona. The automatic weather station of Portbou (Alt Empordà) registered two consecutive nights above 30 °C, with a minimum record of 31.0 °C throughout day 4 (0-24h UTC). The night from Saturday to Sunday was exceptional in Roses (Alt Empordà), since from midnight the temperature did not fall below 31.9 °C, although at night it had measured 29.3 °C. Between Saturday and Sunday, the weather observer from L'Estartit (Baix Empordà) measured the warmest night of its 49 years of data: 29.2 °C of minimum temperature. The Raval automatic weather station in the centre of Barcelona city did not drop from 29.8 °C during the night from Saturday to Sunday and the minimum temperature was 29.4 °C on Saturday 4th. Also in Barcelona city, the station of Can Bruixa (31 years of data) measured a minimum temperature of 29.9 °C. These high minimum temperature values represent the highest minimum temperature since 1780 in Barcelona city. =Sweden= May 2018 was the warmest May and July 2018 was the warmest July ever recorded in Sweden. In Stockholm, the previous monthly record of May was recorded in 1993, while the recorded monthly average of May 2018 reached . In Stockholm the monthly average of July reached , making it the hottest month on record. Sweden also experienced widespread drought. More than 50 wildfires, ranging from north of the Arctic Circle to the southernmost county of Scania, occurred and have been called the most serious in the country in modern history by the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency. They burned over , with in its central Kårböle region. On 30 July 2018, the Swedish government offered in financial assistance to drought stricken farmers; one farmer said their losses could be around . Extreme forest fires and continuous drought conditions due to high temperatures caused short supplies for animal food, forcing farmers to resort to imports. On 30 July, the Swedish nuclear power plant Ringhals-2 was shut down, as Kattegat sea waters were too hot to cool the reactor. Ringhals 2 reopened on 3 August. =Switzerland= Switzerland had the warmest April–July period since meteorological records began in 1864. Likewise, 2018 broke the record for the least rainfall in any April–July period since 1864. Fearing wildfires, authorities have completely banned outdoor fires in the canton of Valais and in the Rhine river valley of Grisons. 18 of the 26 cantons have restricted outdoor fires in some way. Note: As of 27 July 2018. =United Kingdom= From the start of June to mid-July the UK underwent their driest summer in modern records. A heatwave was officially declared on 22 June and it caused widespread drought, hosepipe bans and the 2018 United Kingdom wildfires. These series of wildfires worst affected moorland areas of the UK around the Greater Manchester region, the largest of which being at Saddleworth Moor and Winter Hill which together burned over over a period of nearly a month. On 29 June, Northern Ireland Water introduced the first hosepipe ban in Northern Ireland since 1995. The highest temperature reached according to the Met Office was in Faversham, Kent on 26 July.

It was designed by and built by Marie Byles during 1937. It is also known as Ahimsa, The Hut of Happy Omen and Sentosa. The property is owned by the National Trust of Australia (NSW). It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 March 2002.  History  In 1935 Marie Beuzeville Byles purchased of land on the outskirts of Cheltenham. A few years later she designed and built a small one-bedroom house. Perched on a large rock and built of unpainted fibro, oiled timber, random rubble and with a roof glazed terracotta the structure melds well with its bushland setting. Except for a vegetable garden near the house, the remainder of the site was left in its native state. Marie Byles shared with Walter Burley Griffin the objective of integrating structures with the natural landscape and vegetation. Although there is no documented record to prove that Griffin's work influenced her, it seems highly likely that she was favorably impressed by the houses he designed for her friends and sought to incorporate some of their qualities into Ahimsa. Marie Byles was not an architect and, not surprisingly, her work as a designer is less accomplished than Griffin's. Some specific differences are that he preferred flat roofs while her house has a more conventional terracotta pitched roof; Griffin experimented with prefabricated building materials where as Marie used fibro (even in the 1930s this was a very conventional material); but they shared the goal of building small scale, understated and low cost houses which fitted unobtrusively into the Australian bush. Born in England in 1900, Byles studied law at The University of Sydney graduating in 1924 to become the first woman in NSW to practice as a solicitor. She was a remarkable woman who was passionately involved in preserving wilderness areas. She was a keen mountaineer and travelled to Norway, China, Canada and New Zealand in search of unclimbed peaks. In 1938 she led an all women team in an attempt to scale a peak, Mount Sansate in Western China. The expedition failed due to adverse weather conditions. In Australia her determined, active nature led her to become an early lobbyist for what we now know as national parks. Byles was one of the early members of The Sydney Bushwalker's Club and was responsible for drawing the attention of the NSW Lands Department to the wilderness area around Maitland Bay on the central coast north of Sydney. She was appointed Trustee of Bouddi National Park and organised working bees amongst the bushwalkers to maintain the area. The Beecroft-Cheltenham Civic Trust was established by her as a \\"non-progress association\\" which worked for the closure of roads in the area and the planting of native trees and shrubs. She worked with the Bradley sisters (Joan and Eileen) to rid the bush of weeds around her property, and practiced organic gardening techniques all her life. She always slept outside on an open verandah, never drove a car, and walked everywhere, usually with a rucksack. In 1941 while on a bushwalk, where one of the members was taken ill, Byles shouldered his pack, his carriers and her own, and in consequence her feet were permanently damaged. From that time onwards she could manage short bushwalks only, and mountain climbing became impossible. Always interested in eastern religions, in particular the ideas of Gandhi, her disability gave her more time to research and write. In the late 1940s she took up medication and later traveled to India and Burma to undergo instruction. In the 1950s Byles built a hut in her garden called the Hut of Happy Omen, which she made available to meditation groups. By this time she had adopted the most ascetic form of South East Asian Buddhism. The name Ahimsa is derived from Gandhi's teachings and means peace or non-violence. One night in 1966, while sleeping on her open verandah Byles was physically assaulted and sustained serious injuries including a fractured skull. She declined to charge her assailant. After a period of convalescence she returned to live alone on the estate still sleeping out in the open air. Miss Byles gave up her legal practice in 1970, four years after the attack. In 1970 Miss Byles gave the property to the National Trust of Australia, remaining in residence as Honorary Curator. Concerned that the one-bedroom house might be too small for her successor, she developed a plan for an addition comprising a one room detached pavilion. Marie Byles died at Ahimsa on 21 November 1979.  Description  Ahimsa has an area of and is contiguous with a much larger area of bushland, Pennant Hills Park, to the north.Beecroft Cheltenham Civic Trust 1976 The vegetation is described as dry sclerophyll (hard leafed) bushland on Sydney sandstone and is typical of the flora associated with the Northern Hills District of Sydney. The northwest, northeast and part of the southeast boundaries are delimited by unmade road reserves, Malton Road (part) and Lyne Road (also known as Cobram Road). It is located on a small ridge, formerly and unofficially called Native Rose Ridge, on the inside of a sharp curve in a creek draining the Beecroft Cheltenham area. This creek subsequently joins Devlins Creek. The upper parts of Ahimsa are relatively flat but the groundslopes off in a series of small Hawkesbury Sandstone cliffs in a north by north-west direction to the fire trail and towards Pennant Hills Park. There are many flat sandstone outcrops and small cliffs. ;Buildings The buildings include Ahimsa, The Hut of Happy Omen, the toilets, which were all built before the land was sold to the Trust, Sentosa, a detached bedsitter which was approved in principle in November 1975. A carport was built onto The Hut in 1977. Ahimsa is a small one-bedroom house built of unpainted fibro, oiled timber and random rubble with a pitched roof of glazed terracotta. There is a brick fireplace in the living room and a large north-facing open verandah looking over the gully. The Hut of Happy Omen is basically an open shed built of unpainted fibro with a roof of corrugated fibro. At some time it has been extended to incorporate a kitchenette and a shower stall. Sentosa is an open plan bedsitter also constructed of fibro with a skillion roof of corrugated fibro. Marie Byles' design principles are best expressed in this quotation from her: 'No Painting whatever anywhere - Any woodwork to be treated with linseed raw oil (saves unkeep): External walls are to be fibro; Corrugated (sic) fibro (long experience has shown fiber to be lasting, with no upkeep).' Paths were made by volunteers and Marie Byles' bushwalking friends.Levins 1995 = Condition = As at 27 June 2000, the physical condition was good. = Modifications and dates = An absorption trench was constructed in 1975 to contain surface run off from properties adjacent to Ahimsa as the Trust was afraid that excessive run off would encourage weed growth. One cave has been altered and an attractive two-metre high Hawkesbury Sandstone retaining wall was constructed many years ago near the path from the northern gate. Despite her wish that no plants foreign to it, even from other parts of Australia, should be planted several native plants not indigenous to Ahimsa have been planted.  Heritage listing  As at 27 January 2010, Ahimsa and surrounding landscape stand as a testimony to Marie Byles' life and vision as a feminist and a conservationist. These subjects are of increasing interest to contemporary Australians and are helping to share our culture. Aesthetically, the small scale understated buildings fit unobtrusively into the Australian bushland. The peaceful atmosphere of the property gives visitors an insight into the character of the woman who gave the property to the National Trust. The bushland and topographical features, and the property's close proximity to the state reserve next door, form an intact natural area indicative of the appearance of this area prior to human occupation. Ahimsa was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 1 March 2002 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The history of the property is very much the culmination of the ideology practiced by Marie Byles. Marie Byles has been one of the foremost protagonists of national parks as a mechanism to conserve nature. She was one of the early members of Sydney Bushwalkers' Club joining it in 1929 being a keen bushwalker. She was also the first woman lawyer in Australia, which gave her a certain amount of confidence. This confidence coupled with her interest and dedication to the cause of nature conservation became an asset to the nature conservation lobby in Australia. The creation of the Bouddi National Park is identified as a result of the unrelenting efforts by Marie Byles.

Raised in the south Dublin suburb of Milltown, Keogh initially played schoolboy football with Castleville and Home Farm before joining local League of Ireland side Shamrock Rovers. Making his senior football debut in 1959, Keogh would go on to play for, among others, Drumcondra, Ards, Drogheda and Cork Hibernians. Keogh was part of the Drumcondra side that played a number of matches in European competition in the early 60s, including a 1-0 home win over Bayern München in the 1962–63 Inter- Cities Fairs Cup. He was a League of Ireland XI international footballer and played professionally on both sides of the Irish border. Early years Keogh played schoolboy football with Castleville and Home Farm. He made appearances for the Shamrock Rovers reserve side in 1958 before making his first team debut a year later. It has mistakenly been stated that Ray was part of the Rovers side that faced Manchester United in a European Cup tie in 1957, it was however, the similarly named Shay Keogh who featured in this match. With opportunities hard to come by in a talented and successful Rovers side; Keogh would sign for Longford Town in the 59-60 season. His stay with the B Division side was short before moving back to the top flight of Irish football with north Dublin's Drumcondra. Drumcondra With Drums Keogh would feature in the 1961 FAI Cup Final, losing to St. Patrick's Athletic. He would, however, claim his first league title that year, with Drumcondra finishing a solitary point ahead of St. Pats, and Keogh's teammate Dan McCaffrey top-scorer with 29 goals. The league win meant that Drumcondra qualified for the European Cup as League Champions for the 1961-62 European Cup, which was Keogh's first full season with the side. He featured in the First Round aggregate defeat at the hands of German champions FC Nürnberg, playing in a 5-0 loss away at Städtisches Stadion in front of over 30,000 spectators, but didn't play in the 4-1 home loss at Tolka Park. Drumcondra would finish 7th in the League that season, but qualified for the 1962–63 Inter-Cities Fairs Cup, a predecessor to the Europa League. The first round of the Fairs Cup saw Drums drawn against an Odense XI from Denmark. The first-leg saw Drumcondra triumph 4-1, with Keogh playing in front of the 12,000 spectators at Tolka Park. He was also part of the team that lost 4-2 away in Denmark, but Drumcondra had done enough to go through 6-5 on aggregate. In the Second Round, they were drawn against German giants Bayern München. While Keogh didn't feature in the 0-6 first leg loss at Grünwalder Stadion, he returned to the starting line-up for the home leg at Tolka Park as Drums recorded one the most famous wins by a League of Ireland side in Europe, winning 1-0. Drumcondra would finish 3rd in the League that year. Later years Keogh moved North in 1964, playing for Ards and briefly with Portadown. In 1966 he joined Cork Hibernians and also spent time with Drogheda FC. During his time with Drogheda, Keogh would play under Arthur Fitzsimons and later Mick Meagan. After retiring from senior football, Keogh moved into coaching with Tullamore Town where, as player-manager, he would win the 1970-71 Intermediate Cup and the League of Ireland B Division. He also later coached at Parkvilla F.C. based Navan, County Meath and Bluebell United F.C. in Dublin. League of Ireland XI Keogh won representative honours representing the League of Ireland selection on a number of occasions, making his debut in a September 1961 1-1 draw against a Scottish League XI in front of 6,000 people at Dalymount Park.

It is the burial place of Danish- Norwegian statesman Henrich Krummedige and contains a richly decorated altarpiece from Antwerp, unparalleled in the province of Skåne. History The first church to be built where the presently visible church stands was probably a stave church. During the 12th century, it was replaced by the presently visible stone church. The church has been successively enlarged and rebuilt since then, and today only a single Romanesque window and parts of the northern wall of the nave remain from the earliest church. The church porch in front of the southern entrance was built during the 14th century, and the interior vaults date from 1450-1475. In the 1520s the church was enlarged towards the west. At the same time a burial chamber was installed for the Krummedige family, owner of nearby Månstorp Gables. The Danish-Norwegian statesman Henrich Krummedige is buried in the burial chamber. The Renaissance gable adorning the western facade of the church was constructed in 1593. The western entrance was made considerably later, in 1832, and the church tower added as late as 1855 and renovated already in 1894. Furnishings The church contains a large and richly decorated altarpiece made in Antwerp 1520. There are no other similar pieces in the province of Skåne. The central part consists of deep sections with an abundance of sculpted scenes, depicting the suffering of Christ. The six wings have painted depictions of the Passion and six saints. It has been suggested that such a valuable altarpiece perhaps originally was made for a richer church in nearby Malmö, possibly Sankt Petri, but it is also possible that the altarpiece was made for Västra Ingelstad Church and installed in the church during the reconstruction of the church in the 1520s. The other furnishings of the church are from after the Reformation. The pulpit was made in the 1620s and altered in 1742. The pews are from the 18th century, and the baptismal font was made in 1967.

He showed useful but unremarkable form in his first two seasons before developing into a high-class performer at the age of four when he won the Glorious Stakes as well as finishing second in both the Irish Champion Stakes and the Champion Stakes. He continued his progress as a five-year-old in 2018, winning the Brigadier Gerard Stakes, Prince of Wales's Stakes and King George VI & Queen Elizabeth Stakes. Background Poet's Word is a bay horse standing 16.1 hands high (1.64 m) with no white markings bred in Ireland by the Woodcote Stud. As a yearling he was offered for sale at Tattersalls in October 2014 and bought for 300,000 guineas by the bloodstock agent Charles Gordon-Watson. He entered the ownership of Saeed Suhail and was sent into training with Michael Stoute in Newmarket, Suffolk. He was from the first crop of foals sired by Poet's Voice, who won the Queen Elizabeth II Stakes in 2010. Poet's Word's dam Whirly Bird won five minor races and produced several other winners including the Prestige Stakes winner Malabar. She was a granddaughter of the Child Stakes winner Inchmurrin, making her a close relative of Balisada and Harbour Law. Racing career =2015: two-year-old season= Poet's Word made his only appearance as a juvenile on 21 October when he started a 16/1 outsider for a maiden race over seven furlongs at Newmarket Racecourse.

His three other appearances in 2016 were in handicap races. On 4 June at Epsom Racecourse he carried 124 pounds and finished fourth to Gawdawpalin (112), beaten five lengths. At Goodwood on 29 July he was ridden by Moore and started 7/4 favourite despite carrying 133 pounds over eleven furlongs. He struggled to obtain a clear run in the straight but \\"stayed on strongly\\" to win by just over a length from Sixties Groove. On his final appearance of the season he was matched against older horses and beaten a length by the four- year-old Central Square at Doncaster Racecourse in September. =2017: four- year-old season= Poet's Word began his third campaign on the Polytrack at Chelmsford on 13 April when he started 8/11 favourite for a ten furlong handicap for which he was assigned 130 pounds. With Moore in the saddle he took the lead inside the final furlong and won \\"readily\\" by a length and a quarter from Intrude. The colt was then moved up to Group 3 level for the first time to contest the Huxley Stakes at Chester Racecourse in May and finished second, beaten a neck by the Aidan O'Brien-trained Deauville. After a break of almost three months, Poet's Word returned on 4 August for the Group 3 Glorious Stakes over one and a half miles and started the 7/4 favourite against five opponents. Moore settled him in fourth before taking the lead approaching the final furlong and winning by one and a half lengths and a neck from Second Step (Grosser Preis von Berlin) and Scarlet Dragon. In September the colt was sent to Ireland and stepped up to Group 1 class for the Irish Champion Stakes over ten furlongs at Leopardstown Racecourse in which he was partnered by James Doyle. Starting at odds of 10/1 he was beaten half a length by the outsider Decorated Knight with Cliffs of Moher, Churchill and The Grey Gatsby among the unplaced finishers. In the Champion Stakes at Ascot Racecourse on 21 October, he proved no match for the winner Cracksman but took second place ahead of Highland Reel, Recoletos, Brametot, Cliffs of Moher and Barney Roy. For his final run of the year he was sent to Sha Tin Racecourse for the Hong Kong Cup on 10 December and finished sixth behind the locally trained Time Warp. In the 2017 edition of the World's Best Racehorse Rankings Poet's Word was given a rating of 119, making him the 59th best racehorse in the world. =2018: five-year-old season= Poet's Word began his fourth season with a trip to Dubai for the Sheema Classic at Meydan Racecourse in March. Ridden for the first time by Frankie Dettori he finished second of the ten runners, beaten three lengths by Hawkbill. On his return to Europe the horse started 4/6 favourite for the Brigadier Gerard Stakes over 10 furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse on 24 May. He was positioned in second place by Moore before taking the lead entering the last quarter mile and \\"kept on well\\" to win by two and a quarter lengths from Laraaib. At Royal Ascot on 20 June Poet's Word started 11/2 second favourite behind Cracksman in a seven-runner field for the Group 1 Prince of Wales's Stakes which also included Hawkbill and Cliffs of Moher. After being restrained by James Doyle in fifth place he made a forward move approaching the straight, took the lead a furlong out and drew away from his rivals to win by two and a quarter lengths from Cracksman. His victory gave Stoute his 76th victory at Royal Ascot, making him the most successful trainer in the meeting's history. Stoute described the winner as \\"a very consistent, brave horse\\". On 28 July Poet's Word, with Doyle in the saddle, was one of seven horses to contest the 68th running of the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes over one and a half miles at Ascot. He started the 7/4 second favourite behind his stablemate Crystal Ocean with the other fancied runners being Coronet Stakes, Hydrangea, Rostropovich (Dee Stakes), Salouen (runner-up in the Coronation Cup) and Desert Encounter. After racing towards the rear of the field, Poet's Word produced a sustained run on the outside in the straight, overhauled Crystal Ocean inside the final furlong, and won by a neck. His win was a record sixth in the race for Stoute, after Shergar, Opera House, Golan, Conduit and Harbinger. James Doyle commented \\"He's a true warrior. Everything he does, he's so professional and he responds really well. I just had to be patient... I had to be brave and attack late and he’s helped me out. He's the real star today\\". Poet's Word was dropped back in distance at York on 22 August and started 8/5 favourite for the International Stakes in which he faced the leading three-year-olds Roaring Lion and Saxon Warrior. After tracking the leaders Doyle found himself boxed in when the field tracked right to race up the stands-side in the straight. He quickly obtained a clear run but was unable to make any impression on the leader Roaring Lion and was beaten just over three lengths into second place. In September it was announced that Poet's Word had sustained an injury and would miss the rest of the season. He was officially retired from racing a month later. In the 2018 World's Best Racehorse Rankings, Poet's Word was given a rating of 126, making him the 7th best racehorse in the world.

Reception Niyati Bhat of The Hindu wrote: \\"'Half Widow' does not fall into the Bollywood trap of the formula Kashmir film\\" Aakansha Naval of Cineblitz gave it 4 stars out of 5 and wrote \\"it's a hard look at the harrowing and emotional trauma of half widows in Kashmir, Danish Renzu’s directorial debut is storytelling at its best and not to be missed. Danish Renzu’s Half Widow differs. In fact, not just from these two films, but also from every other film that’s either been made, based, set or shot in Kashmir!\\" Keyur Seta of Cinestaan gave it 3 stars out of 4 and write: \\"It is a more intimate portrayal and captures the lives of ordinary Kashmiris. The simple and realistic dialogues are an example. The use of the local language in a number of places adds to the realism.\\" Nandini Ramnath of Scroll in praised the lead actors performance and wrote: \\"Neelofar Hamid’s sensitive and affecting portrayal accommodates the spectrum of Neela’s emotional experiences, from loneliness to comfort in family and community, and from despair to hope. Neela’s dilemma, articulated through a voiceover by dialogue writer Sunayna Kachroo, moves away from politics towards the direction of poetics. There is immense poignancy and wistfulness in Neela’s ruminations. The seasons change, but no season brought you back, Neela says to herself as she remembers Khalid.\\" Sanjana Bhagwat of Shorted wrote: \\"This is just what the film is – grounded, honest and real, without any glossiness of romanticism or manipulation. Familiar songs like ‘Dilbaro’ and ‘Ae Watan’ sound starkly different without the sheen of being in a Bollywood film; they can be heard in Half Widow through the static of radios or the off-key, asynchronous hum of a children’s choir.\\" Awards and Festivals Festivals *CAAMFest , San Francisco *Seattle International Film Festival, Seattle *Asian Film Festival of Dallas, Dallas *Indie Meme International Film Festival, Texas *Vancouver South Asian Film Festival, Canada *South Asian International Film Festival, New York *Innovative International Film Festival, Bangalore *2nd New Delhi Film Festival, Delhi *Le Festival des Films Indiens de Toulouse, France *Jaipur International Film Festival, Jaipur *Tasveer South Asian Film Festival, Seattle *Chicago South Asian Film Festival, Chicago *Houston Asian American Pacific Islander Film Festival (HAAPIFest), Houston *UN_Women, Los Angeles chapter (SPECIAL SCREENING) *Boston Indian and International Film Festival, Boston *Mustard Seed Film Festival of Philadelphia, Philadelphia *San Luis Obispo International Film Festival, San Luis Obispo *DC South Asian Film Festival, Washington DC *New Jersey Indian & International Film Festival, New Jersey *Caelesdoscope International Film Festival, Rhode Island *Hyderabad Bengali Film Festival, Hyderabad *Indian Film Festival of Cincinnati, Ohio *National Film Festival of Kerala, Kochi *Third Eye Asian Film Festival, Mumbai *Indian Film Festival Of Prague Nominations *Best Actress (Neelofar Hamid) - Boston Indian and International Film Festival *Best Film - Boston Indian and International Film Festival *Le Festival des Films Indiens de Toulouse - Film Critics Circle of India Award for the Best Debut Director Danish Renzu https://filmcriticscircle.com/fcci-awards/ *In Competition at Asia Pacific Screen Awards, Australia Awards *Best Director, Dada Saheb Phalke Film Festival 2018 *Audience Choice, Best Feature Film - 2017 South Asian International Film Festival, New York (world premiere) *Audience Choice, Best Feature Film - 2018 Vancouver South Asian International Film Festival, Canada *Best Film Award - 2018 New Jersey Indian and International Film Festival *Best Director Award Danish Renzu - 2018 New Jersey Indian and International Film Festival *Best Actress (Neelofar Hamid) - 2018 Caelesdoscope International Film Festival *Best Cinematography (Antonio Cisneros) - 2018 Boston Indian and International Film Festival, Boston *Best Film Critics Choice - 2019 Indian Film Festival of Cincinnati, Cincinnati References External links * Category:Films set in Jammu and Kashmir Category:Films shot in Jammu and Kashmir Category:Human rights abuses in Jammu and Kashmir Category:Politics of Jammu and Kashmir Category:Urdu-language films Category:Indian independent films Category:Kashmir conflict in films Category:Indian Army in films ","title":"Half Widow"},{"id":"58015924","text":"John S.

He is a professor of synthetic chemistry at the University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom, and a visiting professor at Henan Normal University and guest professor at East China University of Science and Technology, both in China. His research is in molecular recognition and catalysis, and he is a user of boronic acid derivatives. He is a former industry fellow of the Royal Society. Education Fossey received his four-year MChem from Cardiff University in 2000 and was awarded a PhD from Queen Mary University of London in January 2004. Research and career Fossey’s research looks at synthetic chemistry to develop new therapies for tuberculosis and diabetes. This work on diabetes involves an alternative drug delivery for type 1 diabetes management. This research is in collaboration with the Chinese Academy of Sciences research institute Guangzhou Institutes of Biomedical Health (GIBH)., to develop new drugs that could help tackle global epidemics. Specifically, Fossey is developing a ‘smart insulin’, a gel that dissolves in the presence of glucose, as an alternative to insulin injection. The idea is that the smart insulin, as a smart drug delivery, can be administered perhaps once a week and will deliver insulin as and only when glucose levels are raised. He is on the advisory board of two Royal Society of Chemistry journals, Organic Chemistry Frontiers and Catalysis Science & Technology,, and the editorial board of the Chemistry Central Journal.

Cudjoe was the Maroon warrior who led them into battle during the First Maroon War in the 1730s.McFarlane, Cudjoe the Maroon, p. 24. The Maroons of Cudjoe's Town, known as Leeward Maroons, fought the British colonial forces to a standstill in the 1730s, until Governor Edward Trelawny felt compelled to offer Cudjoe a peace treaty. After some initial suspicion, Cudjoe signed the treaty in 1739, reportedly at Petty River Bottom, near the present-day village of Flagstaff.\\"Flagstaff\\" https://www.caribbeanbirdingtrail.org/sites/jamaica/flagstaff/ Retrieved 24 June 2020. However, the Maroons of Accompong Town believe that the treaty was signed by Cudjoe in their Maroon town. The Maroon town eventually became known to the colonial authorities as Trelawny Town.Mavis Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica 1655-1796: a History of Resistance, Collaboration & Betrayal (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), pp. 88-118. The 1739 treaty initially only recognised the existence of Cudjoe's Town, which they called Trelawny Town, and failed to identify Accompong Town as another Maroon town that fell under Cudjoe's jurisdiction.Michael Siva, After the Treaties: A Social, Economic and Demographic History of Maroon Society in Jamaica, 1739-1842, PhD Dissertation (Southampton: Southampton University, 2018), p. 46. http://explore.bl.uk/primo_library/libweb/action/display.do?tabs=moreTab&ct;=display&fn;=search&doc;=BLL01019153409&indx;=1&recIds;=BLL01019153409&recIdxs;=0&elementId;=0&renderMode;=poppedOut&displayMode;=full&frbrVersion;=&frbg;=&&dscnt;=0&scp.scps;=scope%3A%28BLCONTENT%29&vl;(2084770704UI0)=any&tb;=t&vid;=BLVU1&mode;=Basic&srt;=rank&tab;=local_tab&dum;=true&vl;(freeText0)=michael%20sivapragasam&dstmp;=1546605833202 The Maroons of Cudjoe's Town saw action in Tacky's War, fighting on the side of the white militia against rebel slaves, under a younger Maroon captain named Furry or Furre.Douglas Hall, In Miserable Slavery: Thomas Thistlewood in Jamaica, 1750-86, Macmillan, 1999, pp. 105-6. Trelawny Town Trelawny Town was located in the Saint James Parish, Jamaica, not Trelawny. The town and the parish were both named after Governor Trelawny. After the treaty of 1739, both the colonial authorities, generals and Maroons gradually stopped calling it Cudjoe's Town, and started to call it Trelawny Town. Trelawny Town's population grew from 276 in 1740 to 362 in 1770, to 594 in 1788. p. 239. Because of their population growth, in the second half of the eighteenth century, there were a number of land disputes between Trelawny Town and neighbouring planters. When the Assembly sided with the planters in these disputes, the tension that occurred as a result exploded in the form of the Second Maroon War of 1795-6.Siva, After the Treaties, pp. 126-7. When Trelawny Town was ruled by the white superintendents father-and-son team of John James and John Montague James, they were able to quell these disputes. However, when the Jamaican Assembly dismissed the James family, and appointed the inexperienced Thomas Craskell as superintendent, then Maroon colonel Montague James took control of Trelawny Town, and dismissed Craskell from his post.Siva, After the Treaties, pp. 129-132. The Second Maroon War of 1795-6 was sparked when the magistrate of Montego Bay unwisely ordered that two Trelawny Town Maroons be flogged by slaves for stealing two pigs. This action outraged the Maroons of Trelawny Town, and led to Montague James ousting Craskell, and renewing calls for more land, and the reinstatement of his friend, John James, as superintendent.Richard Hart, Slaves Who Abolished Slavery: Blacks in Rebellion (Kingston, Jamaica: University of the West Indies Press, 2002), pp. 159, 165-7. The casualties suffered by the colonial militias were higher than those suffered by the Maroons. In the first two weeks of the conflict, the Maroons of Trelawny Town had killed 65 British soldiers without any Maroon death reported. Throughout the entire conflict, one general complained that the colonial forces had killed less than 32 Maroons and their allies. Recent research shows that the colonial militias were only able to kill about 16 Trelawnys. The Maroon warriors also laid waste to a number of sugar estates in western Jamaica.Siva, After the Treaties, pp. 144-7. Hundreds of runaway slaves secured their freedom by fighting alongside Trelawny Town. They formed independent communities first under Cuffee (Jamaica), and then at Me-no-Sen-You-no-Come.Michael Sivapragasam (2019) \\"The Second Maroon War: Runaway Slaves fighting on the side of Trelawny Town\\", Slavery & Abolition, DOI: 10.1080/0144039X.2019.1662683 https://www.tandfonline.com/eprint/PEX47HQYJUGEEZRJY6DE/full?target=10.1080/0144039X.2019.1662683 Retrieved 10 September 2019. However, the Maroons of Trelawny Town were unable to maintain their guerrilla campaign during the drought months, and Colonel George Walpole employed a scorched-earth policy, backed up by the importation of hunting dogs. By 22 December Walpole was able to persuade Montague James and his Maroon lieutenants, including Major Jarrett, Charles Samuels and Andrew Smith, to come to terms.Campbell, Maroons of Jamaica, p. 229.Siva, After the Treaties, pp. 148-9. https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/423482/1/LIBRARY_COPY_After_The_Treaties_Final.pdf Walpole promised the Maroons that they would not be transported off the island if they laid down their arms, and the Trelawny Town warriors agreed to submit to terms. However, the governor, Alexander Lindsay, 6th Earl of Balcarres, exploited a loophole to reverse Walpole's promise, and he promptly arranged for the deportation of just under 600 Trelawny Town Maroons to Nova Scotia, where they became Black Nova Scotians.Campbell, Maroons of Jamaica, pp. 230-242.Siva, After the Treaties, pp. 145-151. Trelawny Town in Exile As many as 58 Trelawny Town Maroons avoided deportation to Nova Scotia, and they remained in Jamaica, some settling in Accompong Town, while others merged with the free black population. The Second Maroon War proved costly to the colonial authorities, and in an attempt to recoup their losses, the Jamaica Assembly auctioned off most of the 1,500 acres belonging to Trelawny Town.Siva, After the Treaties, pp. 152-5. The Maroons were unhappy with the conditions of their exile in Nova Scotia, and they regularly petitioned the British government to be relocated to another colony. In 1800, the British government eventually agreed to transport the Trelawny Maroons to Sierra Leone, where they helped to suppress a rebellion by the Black Nova Scotians. As a reward, the Sierra Leone colonial authorities granted the Jamaican Maroons in Sierra Leone the best houses and land, which originally belonged to the Black Nova Scotians.Simon Schama, Rough Crossings (London: BBC Books, 2002), p. 382. After the Second Maroon War, the colonial authorities converted Trelawny Town into a military barracks, and renamed it Maroon Town, Jamaica. The Returned Maroons of Flagstaff After slavery was abolished in 1838, the Jamaican colonial authorities imported labourers from Sierra Leone, and among that number were scores of Trelawny Town Maroons. These Returned Maroons established themselves in nearby Flagstaff, and their descendants are still there today.http://maroonconnection.blogspot.com/p/brief-history-of-trelawny-town- maroons.html Retrieved 25 April 2019.

Sandwiched between Connecticut Route 8 and the tracks of the former Naugatuck Railroad line, now the Waterbury Branch, it developed in the mid-19th century as a successful industrial center dominated by the production of brass goods. The district was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. Description and history The area that is now Seymour was originally part of Derby, and was separately incorporated in 1850. Its industrial and commercial history began in the late 18th century, when John Wooster and Bradford Steele established first a blacksmithy, and then fulling and carding mills at the falls of the Naugatuck River. In 1803, General David Humphreys purchased land and water rights nearby their mills, and established what is believed to be one of the oldest woolen mills in the nation, after bringing a flock of merino sheep over from Spain. Construction of the railroad through the area in the late 1840s brought further expansion, and development of the downtown area, which lasted into the 1920s. During this period, the industrial processing of copper and brass became one of its leading businesses. With The historic district is a roughly rectangular area, with a truncated northwest corner, in size. It is set in a bend of the Naugatuck River, with CT 8 paralleling the bank west of the district, and the railroad cutting a straight north-south line to its east. There are only a few residences in the district, most of which are vernacular Queen Anne wood frame structures built late in the 19th century. The oldest building in the district is believed to be the Trestle Tavern, a 2-1/2 story frame structure at 26-28 Main Street built about 1850. The southern end of the district is dominated by the former Waterman Pen complex, an industrial site with associations to the city's brass industry; most of its buildings date to the early 20th century. The town's major civic buildings (town hall, post office, and fire station) are just north of the industrial complex, and the rest of the district consists mainly of commercial buildings built mostly between 1880 and 1940.

In 88 BC, Sura and a small detachment from Sentius's army were sent south to stop Archelaus, a leading general of King Mithridates VI of Pontus, who had invaded Greece. Sura started with a naval engagement in which he was victorious, then captured the island of Sciathos, which the Mithridatics were using as a storehouse. He crucified all escaped slaves on the island, and brutally cut off the hands of the free men. After receiving reinforcements, he pushed further south into Boeotia.Timothy Venning, \\"A Chronology of the Roman Empire\\", Bloomsbury, 2011 Archelaus and his Greek allies moved against him.

Mayhem in 1985) was an American straight edge hardcore punk band formed in Queens, New York in 1984, by drummer and vocalist Tommy Carroll, guitarist Gordon Ancis and bassist Tony Marc Shimkin. History Straight Ahead were formed by former-Assault guitarist and bassist Gordon Ancis and Tony Marc Shimkin along with drummer and vocalist Tommy Carroll, who had previously played in Corrupt, in 1984, the band would then change their name to \\"N.Y.C. Mayhem\\" in 1985, release their debut demo tape \\"Mayhemic Destruction\\" and then replace Shimkin with Craig Setari. Late-1985 saw the release of their debut EP \\"We Stand\\" and the band's first breakup, in which Carrol and Setari would join Youth of Today. N.Y.C. Mayhem reformed in 1986, back under their previous moniker \\"Straight Ahead\\", this time with Rob Echeverria on guitar, instead of Gordon Ancis. This lineup would record a 7-inch as a three-piece, before recruiting Armand Majidi on drums, having Carroll move over to only vocals. They played their final gig on 3 May 1987, playing one reunion gig in 1988 at the \\"For Pete's Sake\\" benefit, after which Carroll was rarely seen, if ever. Musical style and Legacy Straight Ahead are considered a hardcore punk band, more specifically, their work as N.Y.C. Mayhem has been categorised as the subgenre thrashcore and some of their songs as an early form of death metal. whereas their post-1986 work is considered crossover thrash. They were one of the earliest bands to blur the lines between punk rock and heavy metal, with their style being just as much indebted to extreme metal bands like Venom and Slayer as it was to Void, Necros and Negative Approach. The band have also been cited as referring to their own music as \\"deathcore\\" as early as 1985. Bernard Doe of Metal Forces magazine referred to them as \\"the fastest band around\\". Straight Ahead (specifically their output as N.Y.C. Mayhem) was a significant influence on Stormtroopers of Death, as well as the genres of death metal, grindcore and black metal due to early use of death growls and heavy riffing on tracks from 1985's \\"We Stand\\" such as \\"Necropolis (City Of The Dead)\\" and \\"Deathwish\\". Jeffrey Walker of English band Carcass has cited N.Y.C. Mayhem as a major influence on the band's early grindcore sound, Shane Embury (later of Napalm Death) and Mitch Dickinson (later of Heresy)'s band Warhammer were heavily influenced by N.Y.C. Mayhem's early demo tapes, according to Matt Olivo of grindcore band Repulsion, N.Y.C. Mayhem were one the bands that inspired them to play at the speed they did and American grindcore band Brutal Truth covered Straight Ahead's song \\"White Clam Sauce\\" on their 2011 album \\"End Time\\". Charlie Benante of Anthrax has said that the first time that he ever heard blast beats was from one of N.Y.C. Mayhem's demo tapes, inspiring him to learn the technique himself. Heavy metal band Prong played their first gig on 23 November 1986 in support of Straight Ahead and Nausea. Tom Capone, guitarist of Quicksand, has cited N.Y.C. Mayhem as one of his favorite bands in the world. Original bass player Tony Marc Shimkin has worked with artists such as Madonna, on her 1992 album Erotica. The band's vocalist, Tommy Carroll, went on to be the drummer in Youth of Today and vocalist of Irate. Original guitarist Gordon Ancis went on to found pioneering death metal band Hellhouse in 1985, as well as Zero Hour, which included ex-Whiplash guitarist Tony Scaglione, Massacre guitarist Rob Goodwin and Deathrash bassist Pat Burns. Ancis also played in New York crossover thrash band Leeway and hardcore punk band Agnostic Front. Bassist Craig Setari has played bass for New York hardcore punk band Sick of It All since 1992, along with drummer Armand Majidi. Setari has also played with Youth of Today, Agnostic Front and Cro- Mags. Guitarist Rob Echeverria joined Helmet and eventually Biohzard. Echeverria, Majidi and Setari also all played in hardcore punk band Rest in Pieces.

Life  Reinhard Schwabenitzky was born in his maternal grandmother's pub in the remote hamlet of Bucheben, a long walk along the valley to the south of Rauris, which is a small town in the mountains of the State of Salzburg, positioned an hour or so by car (in the summers) to the south of Salzburg itself. Gerhard Klingenberg, his father, was an actor. He would later describe his childhood as short of material benefits, but happy. During his early school years there was still no electricity supply. The farmhouse was lit with kerosine lamps. His 3 km / 2 mile walk down to school, and back up again at the end of the day, created memories in him that would endure. In 1951 his parents moved to Sankt Pölten in connection with his father's work. Reinhard Schwabenitzky appeared in his first acting roles at the age of just 4 at the Municipal Theater in Sankt Pölten (\\"St. Pöltner Stadttheater\\"), under the direction of his father. Two years later the child had to bid fare well to then theatre when his parents divorced. He was sent to live with an aunt and an uncle in a relatively remote mountain village called Mittersill. He later went back to live with his grandmother and his Uncle Erwin who ran the family farm in the mountains south of Rauris. When he had time available it was assumed unquestioningly that he too should work on the farm, and during his summer school vacations he took his turn in taking the cattle to the higher pastures. His mother remarried when he was 9. He moved with his mother and stepfather along with his grandmother to their newly acquired guest house, the \\"Itzlinger Hof\\", in Salzburg. The culture shock of the change was considerable and initially, finding no friends at his new school, he became lonely. There was no pure mountain air and few mountain views in the city. On the other hand there were cinemas, and as far as his pocket money allowed he became a regular cinema-goer. Eventually he began to make friends, but at that point he was sent for two years to a boarding school. Those two years he would later describe as the worst in his life. But there was much to learn. There were new concepts such as falsehood, injustice, untruthfulness and personal censorship. The head teacher at the school was a priest, and Reinhard Schwabenitzky found that the times that, as the son of a peasant family in the mountains, he had set aside for attending Mass, he now preferred to dedicate to cinema visits. After his parents' divorce he remained in contact with his father whom he visited several times. His father had moved to East Berlin and was working at the vast Babelsberg Film Studios as a film director. The boy was able to help with the filming, saw the studios, the cutting rooms and the cameras. He watched the film shooting and cutting and, aged just 11, met Wolfgang Staudte, whom he would later come to revere as one of the best film directors ever. Without his being aware of it at the time, Reinhard Schwabenitzky's visits as a boy to his father in East Berlin did much to define the course of his later professional life. When he was 14 Reinhard Schwabenitzky started a band, but the venture was short-lived since he was sent away to school again, this time attending a large \\"Technical College\\" (\\"Höhere Technische Lehranstalt\\" / HTL) at Mödling, just outside Vienna. He studied at the Electrical Engineering department. He did not take naturally to the technical aspects of the course but was keen to emerge with a respectable qualification. He had entered the college with the ambition to become an actor, but by the time he successfully completed his course, receiving his \\"Matura\\" diploma in 1968, this had shifted. He now prepared to build a career as a film director. After his three years at Mödling he returned to Salzburg where his grandmother was still running the \\"Hotel Restaurant Itzlinger Hof\\", a responsibility which would pass down the generations only in 2003. He now had more time for cinema visits, and he resumed playing in a band. During summers in 1967/68 he took work as a lighting technician during the Salzburg Festival, which led to encounters with the musical stars of the day, including Herbert von Karajan, Karl Böhm, Jacqueline du Pré and Oscar Fritz Schuh. He gained admission to the University of Vienna to study not the film directing course but the camera course. He had by this time taken to 8 mm film photography as a hobby. However, once he had enrolled at the university, he was eventually able to switch to a more appropriate curriculum package. He also found time to take plenty of casual work in film and television production, and when there was no casual work he could sometimes be found in a dark corner at the Burgtheater during rehearsals, watching and learning. While still a student Reinhard Schwabenitzky married. His son, Markus, was born a year later: his daughter, Martina, two years after that. During his student years, relations with his mother's new husband were frosty, and Schwabenitzky became unwilling to accept financial support from home. He was able to find work as a director's assistant with Axel Corti, Franz Antel and Bernhard Wicki, and also worked as a cameraman on a television series and for various television commercials. He produced his own \\"graduation film\\" two years before the end of his course, and managed to have the film, \\"Die Lebensaufgabe\\" (loosely, \\"The Tasks of Life\\") shown on Austrian Television. This led to his first commission as a movie director and the production of \\"Schwester Martha verzichtet auf ihr Glück\\" (loosely \\"Sister Martha renounces her good fortune\\"). The success of this satirical piece led to a second commission, \\"Die Entführung einer unmuendigen Person\\" (loosely \\"The kidnapping of an irresponsible party\\"), a forty minute television film, and \\"Salz der Erde\\" (\\"Salt of the earth\\"). He also won a screenplay competition. The success of \\"Salz der Erde\\" triggered anpother television film commission, resulting in the television series \\"Ein echter Wiener geh nicht unter\\" (loosely, \\"You can't keep a true Viennese down\\", 1975-1977). By March 1975, when he took his final degree exams in Camera work and film directing, he was already a highly successful film director. Press reports highlighted the unusual situation, also asserting (incorrectly) that he had passed his degree exams \\"with honours\\". Meanwhile further successful film productions followed. With \\"Ein echter Wiener geh nicht unter\\" Schwabenitzky won the German Goldene Kamera award. Citing restrictive factors affecting his career with Austrian Television he now relocated to Munich in what was then West Germany. His professional career went from strength to strength but his first marriage foundered. He was nevertheless able to maintian close contact with his two children. During the 1970s and 1980s he achieved success with the thirteen part German television series Parole Chicago (1979), the six part series Tour de Ruhr (1980) and the long-running German comedy series Büro, Büro (1982-1984). Another venture involved teaming up with the actor Helmut Fischer to produce a couple of episodes of the long-running television police-drama series Tatort. There were also various cinema movies produced with the stage polymath Dieter Hallervorden. After more than fifteen years in Bavaria, Schwabenitzky returned to Austria, by ow accompanied by Elfi Eschke, his second wife. He continued to enjoy popular success, notably with the Austrian television series Kaisermühlen Blues (1992/93) and Oben ohne (2005-2011), both of which achieved cult status.

It was designed by John Horbury Hunt and built from 1890 to 1893. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The Highlands was built for Alfred James Hordern, a retail merchant, and his wife, Caroline. During the construction of Highlands the couple lived in a small cottage close to the construction site. It was in this cottage that their first son was born, Alfred Roy. Their second son, Bruce Alexander, was born six years later. Alfred (1859-1932) married Caroline Doig (1870-1938) in 1890. Caroline was the daughter of Alexander, a planter in Levaka, Fiji, where she was born. Plans for Highlands would have already been drawn up or the house may already have been under construction. Caroline obviously had a hand in the plans. Lesley Horden said of Alfred that \\"There is nothing in his letters to suggest he had the aestheticism or the spirit of innovation which would move him to commission such an architect. He was not a man to take risks or flout convention, and the robust and distinctive style of this house... bears little relation to his nervous personality.\\" Caroline, however, is described as an artistic and well-educated woman, attributes reflected in Highlands. Other evidence of her influence of the plans is the second kitchen, located next to the household kitchen, which allowed her to \\"indulge in a culinary orgy.\\" For Caroline, cooking was a creative outlet and was not for the purpose of feeding her family. Once her masterpieces had been formed they were given to local hospitals to feed patients. The garden was also created and maintained by Caroline, with the help of up to 14 gardeners. The original garden, how much modified, featured colour. Of note was the gravel driveway bordered by hydrangeas, in 1931 the garden was said to contain 100 varieties. Another feature was a bed of lily-of-the-valley. The garden was not just ornamental, there were extensive kitchen garden beds and, in 1903, Caroline had a grape house constructed. She was also an avid collector and would bring back exotics from her travels in the Pacific Islands and Europe. This had its down side, it is said she introduced a weed of the Oxalidaceace family to Australia. The Alfred junior and Bruce may not have maintained the house as when it was purchased by Mr and Mrs Norman Jones in 1948 it was in a dilapidated state. The Jones replaced the shingle roof with concrete tiles in the 1960s as part of the restoration.  Description  This distinctive two- storey house comprises two conjoining components. The prominent part is the house proper, the kitchen wing sits a separate pyramidal roof. The separation of these two functional centres was advanced for its time. Both roofs were originally shingled, like the walls. The wall shingles curve out over verandahs and openings, to shed water away from the walls. This is a feature of several of Hunt's Shingle Style houses. The verandahs are supported by massive timber posts, minimally decorated. The verandahs are recessed under the eves, another design element commonly used by Hunt. Internally, a small stair hall opens into the sitting room on the right and the drawing room on the left. The drawing room was formerly a dining room. Behind the hall was originally Mrs. Hordern's kitchen, but has since been converted into the dining room. The bedrooms on the second floor open off the stairwell, with the verandah facing north off the main bedroom. Extensive alterations have been made to the kitchen wing. This wing contains a feature not seen in Hunt's other houses - a wide half-glass door. Reynolds and Hughes describe \\"the structural brace is treated as a glazing member, to which the normal glazing bars are subservient.\\" The chimney stack is another unusual feature, \\"a tall, buttressed slab of brickwork which appears almost freestanding.\\" Externally, the original roof shingles have been replaced by grey roof tiles. The main framing, including window openings is of NSW hardwood, while the window sashes and doors are cedar. The house was originally situated on , but subdivisions have left it on a substantially smaller allotment, with the rear of the house to the street. The garden, although significantly altered, contains a notable period Hoop Pine and provides a sympathetic setting to the house.  Heritage listing  As at 20 September 2006, Highlands was a fine example of John Horbury Hunt's interpretation of the Shingle Style. The house displays many of the elements common to Hunt's Shingle Style houses, including recessed verandahs and sweeping skirts to deposit water well away from the walls. In contrast to these common elements, Highlands also displays several unusual features, a half-glass door and distinctive chimney stack being the most prominent. Highlands is significant as evidence of women shaping architecture. Mrs Caroline Hordern was a keen cook and the two-storey kitchen wing was heavily influenced by her. The landscaping was also of her creation and Mrs. Horden introduced many exotics from the Pacific Islands to adorn the garden. Highlands was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. Highlands is representative of John Horbury Hunt's interpretation of the Shingle Style. While each of Hunt's houses has distinctive elements, Highlands displays features common to his Shingle Style houses, namely recessed verandahs and shingles sweeping away from openings to carry water away. Highlands is currently the only Shingle Style house of this scale on the State Heritage Register.

The enterprise soon failed. In 1663 it was relaunched, but the next year was merged into a general company for all French possessions in the Americas. The colony of Cayenne, the nucleus of French Guiana, was eventually secured in 1674. Background \\"Equinoctial France\\" (France équinoxiale) was the name given to the part of South America between the Orinoco and Amazon River – the Guianas. The French government gave several companies the right of commerce and navigation in these countries. The first was given to the merchants of Rouen in 1633 and confirmed by letters patent in 1638. Settlements were founded at the mouth of the Cayenne River in 1634 and 1636. In 1643, a new company was formed in Rouen called the Compagnie du cap du Nord, which obtained letters patent that ceded it all the land between the Orinoco and the Amazon. It was headed by Charles Poncet de Brétigny. Poncet de Brétigny led a group of colonists to Cayenne Island, where he disembarked on 4 March 1644 and collected those who remained of the first settlers. The first wooden Fort Cépérou was built on a hill beside the river's estuary and a village was built below it. Brétigny was ruthless and despotic, and terrorized both the colonists and the indigenous people. The next year Brétigny and most of the Europeans were killed by the Caribs, and the village of Cayenne was destroyed. First company French Guiana in South America The first Compagnie de la France équinoxiale was given the same privileges as the Compagnie du cap du Nord towards the end of 1651. It was led by twelve seigneurs. Also known as the Compagnie de l’Amerique Equinoxial, it was a Paris-based joint stock company sponsored by notables such as the Abbé Marivault of the Sorbonne, the Sieur le Roux de Royville from Normandy, La Boulaye, Secretary of the Marine, and Jean-Jacques Dolu, grand audiencier at the court and intendant of New France in 1620. The company recruited 800 colonists, male and female, to settle in Guiana. The priest Antoine Biet took part in the expedition as a chaplain, and describes it in his Voyage de la France équinoxiale en l'isle de Cayenne entrepris par les françois en l'année M. DC. LII. (Paris, 1664). Abbé Marivault drowned during the embarkation at Honfleur. Balthazar Le Roux de Royville, who led the expedition, was assassinated by the sailors and thrown overboard during the voyage. In September 1652 the expedition reached the tip of the Pointe du Mahury on the Island of Cayenne, where they found the 25 survivors of the earlier settlement. A Monsieur de Navarre was in command of Fort Cépérou. He had arrived there from France about six months earlier, and was a first sergeant. He was promoted to lieutenant for surrendering the fort to the new arrivals. Jean de Laon, a king' engineer, replaced the wooden walls of the fort with a stone bastion called Fort Saint Michel to guard against attacks from the Caribs across the river, and attacks by the English and Dutch. There were violent disputes among the colonists and between them and the local Kalina people. The attempt to found a colony ended in failure. Of the 700 colonists just over 100 survived and escaped to Suriname in January 1654, then to Barbados. The company went bankrupt when it emerged that it was not backed by the king. Interlude A Dutch soldier, Guerin Spranger, obtained a grant from the States General of the Netherlands and established a Dutch colony on Cayenne Island around 1656. He arrived after the French had abandoned the island. The Dutch established plantations and Spranger had begun a profitable trade with the Netherlands when the French decided to regain control, despite being at peace with the Netherlands at the time. Second company Jean- Baptiste Colbert, originator of the second Compagnie de la France équinoxiale The second Compagnie de la France équinoxiale was formed in 1663. The minister Jean-Baptiste Colbert conceived the idea of a new Compagnie de la France équinoxiale, and King Louis XIV of France approved the project. The new company had a capital of 200,000 francs, and all the privileges that had been granted to the first. Antoine Lefèbvre de La Barre, former intendant of the Bourbonnais and a very able man, was appointed governor of Cayenne. He left the port of La Rochelle, France, on 26 February 1664 with two warships and 400 soldiers. He was carried on a fleet commanded by Alexandre de Prouville de Tracy. The expedition included 1,200 settlers. Lefèbvre arrived in Cayenne on 11 May 1664. On 15 May 1664 the Dutch general Spranger agreed to capitulate. Lefèbvre de La Barre established a garrison at Fort Cépérou and started construction of a settlement of 200 huts. He made a treaty with the indigenous people and began colonization in very favourable circumstances. However, the enterprise soon ran into serious difficulty. Successors In 1664, Louis XIV revoked all the concessions made to specific companies and created a general company for all the American colonies named the Compagnie des Indes Occidentales. The Compagnie de la France équinoxiale was merged into the Compagnie des Indes occidentales, and Lefèbvre de La Barre was recalled to take charge of the new enterprise. De la Barre was made governor of Cayenne and of the Antilles. However, the English and the Dutch captured the French establishments, and it was not until 1674 that Marshall Jean II d'Estrées restored French power in Guiana. Louis XIV took all the colonies into his domain in 1674, and the governors were now royal officers.

It forms the north-eastern extreme of the Bosna Ridge in the Strandzha Mountains. Administratively, it lies in the municipalities of Sozopol and Primorsko, Burgas Province. The main orographic ridge extends from the north-west to the south-east with a maximum length of 18-20 km and width of 3-5 km. The north-western extreme of Medni Rid reaches Cape Chukalya on the southern coast of the Gulf of Burgas; to the south-east it reaches the valley of the river Ropotamo, which separates it from the isolated ridge of Kitka Ridge. To the west, the valleys of the rivers Rosenska (a left tributary of the Ropotamo) and Otmanliy (flowing directly into the Gulf of Bourgas) separate it from the small ridge Rosen Bair. The two ridges are connected via a low saddle near the village of Rosen. To the east, Medni Rid descends to the shores of the Black Sea. Its highest point, Mount Bakarlaka (376.2 m), rises in the northern section. Medni Rid is composed by andesite, tuff and plutonic rocks. In its northern part there are copper ore deposits. The climate is continental with significant Black Sea influence. The ridge is drained by small rivers and streams. The predominant soils are cinnamon forest ones. The ridge and its slopes are overgrown with oak, hornbeam and lime forests. On its eastern and western foothills there are four villages: Atia and Ravadinovo to the east, Rosen and Veselie to the west. The south-eastern part of Medni Rid falls within the territory of the Ropotamo Nature Reserve; its northern part is occupied by the Rosenets recreational forest. A 7.21 hectare section of the ridge is designated as a protected area named Bakarlaka. About 172 bird species have been discovered in Medni Rid and the ridge has been declared a site of ornithologic importance. It is an important stop for migrating storks and pelicans after they cross the Gulf of Burgas from Cape Emine in the easternmost Balkan Mountains. Medni Rid is among the nation's foremost nesting sites for middle spotted woodpecker, olive-tree warbler, spotted crake and yelkouan shearwater. There are significant populations of barred warbler and ortolan bunting. On all high points of the ridge — from north to south Atia, Bakarlaka, Lobodovo Kale, Malkoto Kale — there are remnants of Thracian fortresses, built of crushed stone. Methodical excavations were conducted only at Malkoto Kale between 1973 and 1977. Copper, as well as some quantities of silver, had been mined since the second millennium BC. The last copper mine \\"Rosen\\" was closed down in 1995.

The name Quao is probably a variation of Yaw, which is the Twi Akan name given to a boy born on a Thursday. The First Maroon War The Windward Maroons were based in the forested interior of the island, in the heart of the Blue Mountains (Jamaica). During the First Maroon War, Quao shared the leadership of the Windward Maroons with Queen Nanny, an outstanding female Maroon leader. Under the leadership of Quao and Nanny, the Windward Maroons carried out the bulk of the fighting against the British colonial authorities during the 1730s.Mavis Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica 1655-1796: a History of Resistance, Collaboration & Betrayal (Massachusetts: Bergin & Garvey, 1988), pp. 88-125. When Governor Edward Trelawny realized that the British colonial forces would not be able to win the First Maroon War, he offered a treaty first to Cudjoe of the Leeward Maroons in 1739, and then to Quao in 1740. However, Cudjoe was able to secure a more advantageous treaty than Quao, probably because the western Maroon leader was negotiating from a stronger position. The 1739 treaty gave Cudjoe permission to keep all Maroons who had joined his town before he signed the document, but the Windward Maroons were required to return all runaways who joined them in the three years prior to Quao signing the 1740 treaty.Campbell, The Maroons of Jamaica, pp. 126-163. Quao watched while the British military commanders quarreled over who should sign the treaty with the Windward Maroons, an argument that was eventually won by Robert Bennett. Quao and Bennett ‘cut their fingers, and mixed their blood in a calabash bowl’, after which they signed the peace treaty.Michael Siva, After the Treaties: A Social, Economic and Demographic History of Maroon Society in Jamaica, 1739-1842, PhD Dissertation (Southampton: Southampton University, 2018), pp. 44-5. Crawford's Town uprising After the 1740 treaty, it appears that Quao and Nanny parted ways. It seems that Nanny took her supporters east to what would later become Moore Town on the eastern fringes of the Blue Mountains, while Quao took his people west to central Jamaica, and formed a community in a town that later came to be known as Crawford's Town on the western edge of the Blue Mountains. However, in about 1746, the white superintendents appointed by the British governors took control of Crawford's Town, and replaced Quao as the Maroon leader of that community. The new leader was another Maroon officer, Edward Crawford, after whom the town was eventually named.Siva, After the Treaties, pp. 4, 54. https://eprints.soton.ac.uk/423482/1/LIBRARY_COPY_After_The_Treaties_Final.pdf In 1754, Quao and his supporters rose up in revolt, killed Ned Crawford, and captured the three white men who acted as superintendents in Crawford's Town. Governor Charles Knowles sent a militia detachment under the command of Lieutenant Ross to negotiate with Quao, but the Maroon leader spurned his offers, and reasserted Maroon control of Crawford's Town. Ross then secured the allegiance of the supporters of Crawford, as well as other Windward Maroons, and they defeated the minority of Maroons who supported Quao, capturing him, and killing a number of his Maroon officers.Siva, After the Treaties, pp. 55-6. Legacy It is not clear what happened to Quao, because he disappears from the records after Crawford's Town was destroyed. The supporters of Quao relocated to the neighbouring Maroon town of Scott's Hall (Jamaica), while the supporters of Crawford took up residence in the new Maroon community of Charles Town (Jamaica). The white superintendents took control of both Charles Town and Scott's Hall in the aftermath of the Crawford's Town uprising. Maroon officers, such as Davy the Maroon, reported to the superintendents in Scott's Hall.Siva, After the Treaties, pp. 56-7.

Her poems were published when she was sixteen using a pen name until she married. Later she wrote songs. Bedford contributed periodicals published to many southern States. In El Paso, she filled the position of social and literary editor of the El Paso Sunday Morning Tribune. Early life and education Lou Singletary was born in Feliciana, Kentucky, April 7, 1837. She came of a distinguished family. Her father, Luther Singletary, was of English descent and a native of Massachusetts, born in 1796. He was educated in Boston. Her mother, Elizabeth Hamilton Stell, was born in 1802, in Dinwiddie County, Virginia. Bedford was the fifth child and third daughter. Her great-grandfather was Amos Singletary. Bedford's father was a teacher, and she attended his school starting at six years of age. She had no special love for books, except for reading, spelling and grammar, but her ambition kept her at the head of most of her classes. Nearly all of her education was received under her father's instruction in a country school, though she completed her course of study in Clinton Seminary. She wrote, \\"My Childhood's Home,\\" a age 15, and it appears in her first collection of poems. Career Adopting the pen name of \\"Lenora\\" she contributed to periodicals and based on this success, she wrote more ambitiously. In 1857, she married a friend, John Joseph Bedford, who was a descendant of Gunning Bedford Jr. who signed the Constitution of the United States. There were six children, of the three living sons, two married. The other moved to El Paso, and helped educate their youngest daughter. In the financial panic of 1857, their fortunes were so much impaired that she stopped writing till end of the Civil War. In 1878, she accompanied her husband to Florida, where he went for his health. There she began her literary work while living at Bay Cottage, Milton, Florida. Her husband was editor and proprietor of The Milton Standard, and she had charge of the literary department. She eventually wrote over her own name. In 1881, she completed A Vision and Other Poems. It was published by Robert Clark & Company, (Cincinnati) and a London publisher. This volume received recognition. Paul H. Hayne spoke warmly in its favor. Oliver Wendell Holmes, writing to Mrs. Bedford, after a review of the poems, says: \\"I recognize in your poems a sincere human feeling—a character which always commends any poetical effort.\\" Longfellow, amid the praise of the world found time to write a letter of encouragement and well wishes, and a host of others, able critics and authors, were not insensible to the merits of the work. The Louisville Courier-Journal, to which Bedford was at one time a frequent contributor, speaking of this work, said:— \\"Mrs. Lou S. Bedford is compared by many to Felicia Hemans; and permit me to suggest that her name be inscribed as high upon the scroll of honor and worth as that of Paul H. Hayne. There is the sweet charm of dignity, decorum and morality; yea, even more, of Christianity, breathing from her lines. There are beauty and variety, as she paints from some image before her mental eye; and truth, as she blends some internal passion of noble thought with the most beautiful imagery and choicest language. Like Mrs. Hemans, a tone of unforced, persuasive goodness, pervades her poetry; and though often sad, it is never complaining. That she is a great-hearted, womanly woman, to whose ear the words, home, husband, children and friends, are terms of sweetest import, no one can doubt who is fortunate enough to possess a copy of her elegant poems, called A Vision and Other Poems. The Vision is a tribute to the North for her magnanimity and beautiful charity to the South in 1878, when the yellow fever had desolated and depopulated so many cities and homes. The outpourings of a mighty sympathy dictated this poem; while the fragrant incense of a nation's gratitude breathes and burns through the inspiration of this woman's pen. And well may we be proud of and rejoice in her success; for, although classed among the Southern poets, 'this star-eyed, night-haired' queen of Southern song is a native of our own grand old Kentucky; and only a few years ago, sought a home beneath sunnier skies.\\" Gathered Leaves (Dallas), another volume, appeared in 1888. When her Gathered Leaves appeared, many notices commending the poetic merit of the book appeared in various periodicals, speaking always of her as \\"our gifted Texas Poetess.\\" Deservedly popular, it won for her sincere admirers wherever it was read. In 1893, she published Driftwood and Driftings. In its preface, she stated:— \\"It is said that prefaces are out of date; nevertheless, I am sufficiently old-fashioned to believe that a word of explanation is often necessary to bring the reader and writer into sympathy with each other. Heretofore, I have confined my publications to poetry; but in this miscellaneous collection I have interspersed prose with recently written poems, together with others not embraced in the former volumes. I have also gathered together the short stories and other literary remains of my daughter, Mrs. May Bedford-Eagan, and included them in this work. Had not death intervened, she intended publishing these under the title here used—Driftings. In that event, mine would have been called Miscellaneous Pencilings—a title under which I have contributed much to the press. I have chosen Driftwood and Driftings as being a more euphoneous combination than the other names would have been. Doubtless her work would have been more finished had she lived to revise it; but to me it is sacred as it is—I have made few changes.'''' In 1909, Bedford published a poetical romance called Forrest Dayre. Personal life From Florida, the couple moved to Dallas, Texas.

Balint was co-founder of New York's Squat Theatre where he wrote, acted and directed L-Train to Eldorado and Full Moon Killer. Life Istvan Balint was the son of poet and artist Endre Balint. Balint was the founding member of a theater group called the Squat Theater, who performed in the living room of a house after being denied a public broadcast licence by the communist regime of Hungary. The group grew into a collective that became well known to younger artists throughout Budapest for trying to invent a new type of avant-garde production. In 1976, Balint, along with a number of other artists in the collective, toured theater festivals throughout Europe with the troupe, before relocating to New York City in mid 1977, where he changed his name to Stephan. The troupe finally settled in a theater in Chelsea, Manhattan where they became famous throughout the late 1970s and 1980s. Among the plays Balint co- wrote, co-directed, and performed in were Pig! Child! Fire!, Andy Warhol's Last Love, and Mr. Dead & Mr's Free. He also acted in several films including Hunter, directed by Robert Frank, written by himself, American Stories, Food, Family and Philosophy in 1989 and The Golden Boat in 1990. Balint returned to Budapest in the early 1990s, continuing his work until the start of his long illness in 2002, dying in 2007 of pneumonia. He was survived by his daughter Eszter Balint, his son Gaspar Balint who lives in Budapest and grandson August Balint DuClos, who lives in New York.

It was designed by Norman Selfe who was involved in the design, and built during 1893. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  Gilligaloola was constructed in 1893 on 14 acres of land and planted with Italian gardens and orchards. It was built for Norman Selfe, a prominent civil engineer, after whom the suburb Normanhurst takes its name. The architect and builder of the house is unknown, but the design and character of certain details appear to suggest that Selfe was himself involved. The following obituary taken from the 16 October 1911 edition of The Sydney Morning Herald described the significant contribution that Selfe made at the turn of the century: In November 1981 community representations were made to the Heritage Branch raising concerns for the future of Gilligaloola. At the time there was a proposal to subdivide the grounds of approximately one hectare into five separate lots. Subdivision plans showed lot boundaries particularly close to Gilligaloola and the grounds reputedly contained predominantly intact stylistic and horticultural elements. Following consideration of the matter the Heritage Council of New South Wales considered the matter at its 27 November 1981 meeting and recommended to the Minister the making of an Interim Heritage Order. An Interim Heritage Order was gazetted on 8 January 1982 over the five lots. On 16 December 1983 the Interim Heritage Order over the five lots was revoked and a Permanent Conservation Order placed over Lot 1 DP 262809 on 16 December 1983. Gilligaloola was transferred to the State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  Description  ;Site and garden Remnant garden to Norman Selfe's prominent federation house, formerly on a property of on the ridge line. Gilligaloola's mature trees are a prominent local landmark.LEP, 1994 A majestic Norfolk Island pine (Araucaria heterophylla) over high is a prominent landmark of the area and along Pennant Hills Road probably dates from . The garden also conserves a fine weeping cedar to high from s and a line of olives on the north boundary to from s (?) and a tall palm in the rear garden. A modern brick fence is not sympathetic. In the front garden of No 30 Frazer Road is a mature high stone pine (Pinus pinea) from s and two camphor laurels (Cinnamommum camphora) to 14m from -60 which were probably originally part of the Gilligaloola garden. ;Buildings: Gilligaloola consists of two buildings: The first and original portion is a timber framed two storey farmhouse built in timber studwork with timber shiplap. It has timber floors and is built on brick piers. The second being a two-storey brick residence was added to the original portion in 1893. The two-storey brick house has picturesque verandahs to the north, east and west elevations and a large tower. The upper story is timber framed and decoratively shingles and lath and plaster lined. The front section of the roof is ripple iron. The house is finely detailed throughout with five panelled doors and baronial style marble fireplaces. Remarkable Arts and Crafts chimneys and quality decorative woodwork complement the house. = Modifications and dates = *1991funding assistance provided for renewing guttering, downpipes, roof carpentry, repainting external areas and reline and refloor back verandah and rejoint areas of brickwork. *September 1992approval given for construction of garage on northern corner of property.  Heritage listing  As at 16 April 2013, Gilligaloola was of State heritage significance as the family home of Norman Selfe, the 19th century engineer and innovator, after which the suburb of Normanhurst was named. Constructed in 1893, Gilligaloola is an imposing two storey house with fine Art Nouvea detailing and has outstanding architectural character.

Formerly knows as “The Last Minute Band”, the band originally formed to play a benefit concert for Relay For Life held at Rochester Community and Technical College. Over the past 2 years the band has played shows across multiple US states and plans to tour the United Kingdom and Europe extensively in 2020. Currently the band performs at a variety of venues in and around their founding city of Rochester. Two of the founding members, lead vocalist and guitarist Cassandra Grace and guitarist Dylan McGreevy, met while sharing music online via Facebook and YouTube. McGreevy & Grace have led the group throughout various incarnations of the band, including while McGreevy was still residing in Newcastle upon Tyne, England. The band has described their influences and creative force as multifaceted due to the unique style and musical upbringing of each member. Their influences include Thin Lizzy, Gary Moore, Rory Gallagher, AC/DC, Johnny Cash, Bob Dylan, Neil Young, Bruce Springsteen and Steve Earle to name just a few.  History  = Early years (The Last Minute Band) = In July 2016, Israelson had booked a benefit concert for his band at the time The Rares, but had subsequently exited the band before the performance. In the last minute attempt to fulfill his commitment Israelson put together a new group. Guitarist Issac Gullickson was brought in from Addisons time at The Rares. Vocalist and guitarist Cassandra Grace and husband, guitarist Dylan McGreevy were added to the band to fill out the sound. Originally McGreevy was tasked with Bass only venturing to guitar for the occasional song. Finally, the \\"Man at the back\\" Mark Schnaedter helped round out the sound by adding percussion with his signature style of drumming. The band's name originally came from their last-minute formation, which they later changed to The New Morning after the original \\"The Last Minute\\" tour. In the summer of 2016, the band played various dates throughout the Midwestern United States. In late August of that year, the band members went their separate ways. Schnaedter remained in Rochester, but Grace, Israelson, and Gullickson returned to their separate universities hours away from each other. Meanwhile, McGreevy returned home to Newcastle upon Tyne, England. By the end of the year, The New Morning was in hiatus until spring 2017. = \\"The New Morning\\" (2017–Present) = 2016 Tour Poster In mid 2017, the band re-branded as The New Morning and currently tours with a new lineup. Founding members Grace and McGreevy now front the band mainly as a duo, but with the occasional guest appearance from Gullickson and Israelson. The band's next steps are to continue to pack their touring calendar with dates, record new material and ultimately return to a 4-5 piece band.

History Interior view towards the choir with murals visible Linderöd Church was built during the middle of the 12th century. The vaults of the church are Gothic and date from the 15th century. During the late Middle Ages a church porch was also built in front of the southern entrance, but it was later demolished. In 1770 the church was enlarged towards the west. At this time there were plans to build a church tower, but they were never realized. Helgo Zettervall led a rebuilding of the church in 1873, adding modern windows while demolishing the church porch and moving the Romanesque southern portal to the western gable. Murals In 1929, medieval murals were discovered under later layers of whitewash, and in 1950 they were restored. They cover all the vaults of the church and are, unusually, both signed by the artist, Anders Johansson, and dated to 1498. Anders Johansson was a painter from Sweden, but could work in Skåne (at the time part of Denmark) because the two countries were united in the Kalmar Union. The paintings depict different religious subjects, including the narrative of the creation, the fall of man, the life of Christ, different Christian martyrs, saints and angels. Furnishings The church has a baptismal font from the 12th century, decorated with Romanesque ornaments. It was replaced in 1798 and put outside the church but since 1951, it is again used as the font of the church. Both the altarpiece and the pulpit date from the first half of the 18th century. Noteworthy is also the Romanesque sculpture in the tympanon above the western entrance, dating from the construction period of the church. It depicts the birth of Christ and a vision of the afterlife.

It can glide above the surface of the sea to escape predators. Description The maximum length for this fish is about but a more common length is . The dorsal fin has no spines and 12 to 15 soft rays while the anal fin has no spines and 12 to 14 soft rays. The exceptionally large pectoral fins enable this fish to glide for long distances above the surface of the water. The upper parts of the body are an iridescent dark blue colour while the belly is silvery white. The pectoral fins and tail fin are greyish while the other fins are colourless. Juvenile fish are sometimes barred with black. This species can be distinguished from the oceanic two-wing flyingfish (Exocoetus obtusirostris) by having a less blunt snout and by the origin of the anal fin being at a location behind the origin of the dorsal fin. Distribution and habitat Exocoetus volitans is present in the tropical and subtropical zones of all the world's oceans. Its range includes the Caribbean Sea and the western part of the Mediterranean Sea, but it is absent from the Gulf of Mexico and largely absent from the inland southeastern Asian seas such as the Celebes Sea, the Sulu Sea and the Flores Sea. It is found in surface waters both in the open ocean and close to the coast. Ecology Illustration by Marcus Elieser Bloch E. volitans feeds in the open sea on crustaceans, such as copepods, and other planktonic fauna. The female lays her clutches of 300 or 400 eggs in the open water. This fish sometimes launches itself into the air in an attempt to escape from predators such as tuna, dolphinfishes (Coryphaena), snake mackerel (Gempylus serpens) and the rainbow runner (Elagatis bipinnulata). However, in so doing, it exposes itself to a different set of predators in the form of gulls, cormorants and other aquatic birds. It often exits the water in shoals and sometimes lands on the decks of boats. E. volitans have a high level of genetic similarity caused by a high rate of gene flow and a high level of population expansion, recently. Status This flyingfish is abundant in the tropical and subtropical parts of all oceans. It is not fished commercially, and no particular threats have been identified, so the International Union for Conservation of Nature has assessed its conservation status as being of \\"least concern\\".

The hoard, discovered in 1933, contained numerous Achaemenid coins as well as many Greek coins from the 5th and 4th centuries BCE.: \\"The most important and informative of these hoards is the Chaman Hazouri hoard from Kabul discovered in 1933, which contained royal Achaemenid sigloi from the western part of the Achaemenid Empire, together with a large number of Greek coins dating from the fifth and early fourth century BC, including a local imitation of an Athenian tetradrachm, all apparently taken from circulation in the region.\\" Approximately one thousand coins were counted in the hoard.106\\\\. Kabul: Chaman-i Hazouri, Center for Environmental Management of Military Lands (CEMML), Colorado State University and US Department of Defense, retrieved 26 October 2018. The deposit of the hoard is dated to approximately 380 BCE, as this is the probable date of the least ancient datable coin found in the hoard (the imitation of the Athenian owl tetradrachm). This numismatic discovery has been very important in studying and dating the history of the coinage of India, since it is one of the very rare instances when punch-marked coins can actually be dated, due to their association with known and dated Greek and Achaemenid coins in the hoard. The hoard proves that punch-marked coins existed in 360 BCE, as also suggested by literary evidence. According to numismatist Joe Cribb, it suggests that the idea of coinage and the use of punch-marked techniques was introduced to India from the Achaemenid Empire during the 4th century BCE. However, numerous Indian scholars see the development of coinage in the Gangetic plains as an indigenous development. Historical context Gandhara at the northeastern corner of the Achaemenid Empire The Kabul valley and the region of Gandhara to the west of Indus came under the Achaemenid rule during the reign of Cyrus the Great (600–530 BCE). Jointly, the region was known by its Iranian name Paruparaesanna as well as the Indian name Gandara. It was administered at first from Bactria, but organised into a separate satrapy in BCE with a headquarters possibly at Pushkalavati (near present-day Charsadda in Pakistan).: \\"One should...be careful to distinguish the limited geographical unit of Gandhāra from the political one bearing the same name.\\" It was a tribute-paying region until the time of Artaxerxes (424 BCE), but it remained part of the royal conception of the empire until Alexander's conquest ( BCE). At Alexander's time, the region was said to be governed by hyparchs (rulers in their own right, but professing subjection to the emperor). The nature of the local administration under the Achaemenid empire is uncertain. Magee et al. note that neither the Achaemenid nor classical sources mention the presence of any satraps in Gandara. However, there were official personages encountered by Alexander's companions. Coin type of Croesus, the Croeseid, minted in Lydia, under the rule of Cyrus the Great to Darius I. Circa 545–520. Coinage was developed by the Greeks of the Asia Minor, influenced by the Lydian coinage in the 7th century BCE. Over the next two centuries, the use of coins spread throughout the Mediterranean area.: \\"Ancient Greek coinage developed in Asia Minor, probably influenced by the circulation of Lydian coinage in the 7th century BC. The production of Greek coinage grew as the polis flourished and spread throughout the Mediterranean during the height of the colonization phase between c.700 and c.500 BC. As a result, coinage in antiquity was an essentially Greek phenomenon and became a medium of exchange, the legacy of which remains with us today.\\" The Achaemenid conquest of Asia minor in 540 BCE made no immediate difference to the situation: the Greek coinage continued under the Achaemenid rule and the Iranian heartland itself had little use for money.: \\"Neither the Egyptian nor the Mesopotamian civilizations had needed coinage as a form of money; further, the Achaemenids in the Iranian heartland remained attached to a barter and exchange economy throughout their reign, using commodities like corn, meat, and wine, as well as silver bullion.\\" Daris I introduced new Achaemenid coins, gold darics and silver sigloi, primarily as replacements for the Lydian coins in the Asia minor. While the darics proved to be popular, the sigloi did not catch on. The Greek cities continued to mint their own silver coins. A mix of these Greek silver coins and the Achaemenid sigloi thus began to circulate throughout the Achaemenid empire, the Greek coins generally being in a majority.: \\"the tetradrachms of Athens, above all, had developed in the course of the fifth century to a kind of world trade currency\\" and \\"the Achaemenids had introduced their own distinctive currency in Asia Minor, which, however, formed only a small part of the monetary supply and circulated side by side with local and imported Greek coins.\\" Discovery and storage of the hoard The hoard was discovered by a construction team in 1933 when digging for foundations for a house near the Chaman-i Hazouri park in central Kabul. According to the then director of Délégation Archéologique Française en Afghanistan (DAFA), the hoard contained about 1,000 silver coins and some jewellery. 127 coins and pieces of jewellery were taken to the Kabul Museum and others made their way to various museums in British India and elsewhere. Some two decades later, Daniel Schlumberger of DAFA published photographs and details of the finds stored in the Kabul Museum in a book titled Trésors Monétaires d'Afghanistan.Achaemenid Rule (550–330 BC), Center for Environmental Management of Military Lands (CEMML), Colorado State University and US Department of Defense, retrieved 26 October 2018. The Chaman-i-Hazouri coins remained at the Kabul Museum until 1992–1993, at which time the Mujahideen fighting the Afghan civil war plundered the museum. All the coins were lost (along with various other artifacts). Some two years later, 14 coins from the collection surfaced in a private collection in Pakistan. Osmund Bopearachchi and Aman ur Rahman published their details in the book Pre-Kushana Coins in Pakistan (1995). Description of the hoard The hoard suggests, together with other coin finds in the areas of Afghanistan and Pakistan that Greek coins had found their way to India, at least as far as the Indus, well before the conquests of Alexander the Great. This happened under the rule of the Achaemenids. The Achaemenid sigloi themselves were a small minority, just as in the hoards from other parts of the empire. Daniel Schlumberger published descriptions of 115 coins from those in the Kabul Museum. They included 30 coins from various Greek cities, about 33 Athenian coins and an Iranian imitation of an Athenian coin, 9 royal Achaemenid silver coins (siglos), 29 locally minted coins of said to be of a \\"new kind\\" and 14 punch-marked coins in the shape of bent bars. It seems that the Classical Greek and Achaemenid coins were imported from the west. =Achaemenid siglos coins= A royal Achaemenid siglos, 485-470 BCE (Archer king type). Coins of this type were also found in the Bhir Mound hoard of Taxila.Kabul hoard 1-3-4 Several Achaemenid siglos coins were found in the hoards of Kabul (deposit dated circa 350 BCE)Kabul hoard, coins 65-72 and Bhir Mound hoard of Taxila (deposit dated circa 300 BCE), which were evidently transmitted from the western part of the Achaemenid Empire. They typically show a crowned Achaemenid king running to right, holding bow and spear (Archer king type), with a rectangular punch-mark on the reverse. The several coin hoards discovered in the East of the Achaemenid Empire generally have very few sigloi, suggesting that the circulation of Sigloi was actually quite small compared to the circulation of Greek coinage (both Archaic and early Classical) in those part of the Empire. Coins of this type were also found in the Bhir Mound hoard of Taxila.: \\"Coins of this type found in Chaman Hazouri (deposited c.350 BC) and Bhir Mound hoards (deposited c.300 BC).\\" =Greek coins= Early Classical coins from Athens were by far the most numerous coin type in the Kabul hoard.

The Greek coins recorded in the hoard were 30 coins from various Greek cities and about 34 from Athens with one Iranian imitation. Generally, Greek coins (both Archaic and early Classical) are comparatively very numerous in the Achaemenid coin hoards discovered in the East of the Achaemenid Empire, much more numerous than sigloi, suggesting that the circulation of Greek coinage was central in the monetary system of those part of the Empire. ;Archaic Greek coin types from the Kabul hoard The Kabul hoard contained some archaic Greek coin types (minted before 480 BCE), among them: archaic staters from Aegina, Thasos and Chios. These early coins were made using a die on the obverse with an illustrative design, while the back was formed with simple geometric punch- marks. File:ISLANDS off THRACE, Thasos.

Circa 500-380 BC, or c.350 BCE.\\"Extremely Rare Early Silver from the Kabul Valley\\", CNG 102, Lot:649, CNG Coins Schlumberger labelled 29 round punch-marked coins found in the hoard as being \\"of a new kind\\", not found elsewhere. They are round or elliptic/ cup- shaped coins of the Achaemenid weight standard, struck with one, two or several punches. They usually display a sort of arrow symbol on the obverse, and circular geometric symbols on the reverse. Similar coins have also been found in the Shaikhan Dehri hoard in Pushkalavati in the center of the Gandhara area, but not in Taxila. Their dispersal in Kabul and Pushakalavati led Bopearachchi to postulate that they were manufactured locally, while the region was under Achaemenid protection, during the 5th century BCE. Some scholars also believe them to have been a \\"product of the local Achaemenid administration\\".: \\"In the same hoard there were also discovered two series of local silver coins which appear to be the product of the local Achaemenid administration. One series (no.8) was made in the same way as the Greek coins in the hoard, but with novel designs of local origin, and the other (no.9) had similar local design but made in a new way, which relates it to the silver punch-marked coins of India. It appears that it was these local coins, using technology adapted from Greek coins, which provided the prototypes for punch- marked coins, the earliest coins made in India.\\" NB: Series No.8 refers to the cup-shaped coins, series no.9 refers to the bent-bar punch-marked coins presented in this article. However, others state that the local administration was largely autonomous and followed an independent monetary policy.: \\"There has been some debate about the nature of Achaemenid administration over the eastern provinces, using Achaemenid and classical sources. What is clear is that both are harmonious in referring to the existence of satraps in Bactria and Arachosia (Harauvatish), whereas at no point does either refer to satraps in Gandara, Thatagus, or Hindush.\\": \\"The ‘autonomy’ revealed by urban settlements in the Persian satrapies situated south of the Hindu Kush mountains can also be seen in their monetary policy. While the whole empire accepted the Achaemenid darics and sigloi as the legal tender, Indian satraps issued their own coinage consisting of curved and punch-marked bars, which the English have agreed to call 'bent bars'.\\" According to Joe Cribb, these coins were locally made imitations of Greek coins, with some pictorial, but mostly non-pictorial designs, using weight standards derived from Greek and Persian coinage. According Bopearachchi, these coins illustrate the transition from regular round coinage to Indian punch-marked coins. First, these coins have been shown to be the chronological predecessors of and bent and punch-marked coins. Second, they were minted according to the Achaemenid weight standard of 1 siglos (5.5 grams), or 2 siglos (11 grams). ;Design evolution of the round coins Silver coin issued by King Croesus of Lydia (561–545 BC), obverse: facing busts of lion and bull. Lastly, the round coins in the Kabul hoard display a marked evolution in design: the series starts with simple round coins struck on the obverse and reverse with animal motifs reminding of the \\"western designs\\" of Croesus, or Achaemenid motifs. In particular, the round coins which are considered the oldest in the hoard, have an obverse design consisting in the facing busts of two bulls, evocative of the design of the mid-6th century coins of Croesus with the facing busts of a lion and a bull, generally considered as the first coins ever to be minted. Other western designs include a stag, or double Persian column capitals. In later coins, the obverse design is progressively abandoned, and the reverse becomes a punch mark which progressively evolves to more symbolic motifs (such as the cup-like coins with lines around a central circle), before reaching a stage were the round coins are struck with multiple punches.Coins minted in the Kabul, Center for Environmental Management of Military Lands (CEMML), Colorado State University and US Department of Defense, retrieved 26 October 2018. In summary, these coins were \\"the precursors of the bent and punch-marked coins\\", and \\"the use of independent punches is at the origin of the striking of Indian \\"coins with multiple punch-marks\\". Mauryan kings later issued descendants of these very coins in the territories south of the Hindu Kush for local circulation.: \\"In the territories to the south of the Hindu Kush the punch- marked coins, descendants of the local coins of the Achaemenid administration in the same area, were issued by the Mauryan kings of India for local circulation.\\" =Short punch-marked bent-bars= Short \\"bent-bar\\" punch-marked coin minted under Achaemenid administration, of the type found in large quantities in the Chaman Hazouri.372\\\\. Lot: 658, Lot of two AR bent bars, CNG Coins The round punch-marked coins have been shown to precede chronologically the \\"bent bars\\", also minted under Achaemenid rule from Bactria to the Punjab. The practice of using unmarked silver bars for currency is known from the Iranian plateau and seems to have been current in Central Asia under the Achaemenid Empire. The bent bars are believed to have been derived from that practice, representing \\"a marriage between Greek coinage and Iranian bar currency\\". The short \\"bars with punch-marks\\" (28x15mm) discovered in Chaman Hazouri are attributed to the Paropamisadae by Bopearachchi.; Their design uses two circular symbols punched at each end of one face of the bar. These bent bars are clearly reminiscent of later punch-marked Indian types, which use several of the designs of these coins \\"of a new kind\\". The \\"long bars\\" with punch marks (42x10mm), of which none were found in the Kabul hoard, are attributed to the area of Gandhara, as well as in the Bhir Mound hoard in Taxila.

According to Joe Cribb the earliest punched-marked bent-bars are found in the northwest of the continent, and their simple designs was then adopted in the Gangetic plains, before designs evolved there towards the usage of more numerous punches on each coin. This is also proven by the fact that the Gangetic plains have no known coin designs anterior to their simple punch-marked bars, whereas the Kabul/Gandhara punch-marked bars were preceded there by the round punch-marked coins with symbols, minted under the Achaemenids. Daniel Schlumberger too considers probable that punch-marked bars, similar to the many punch-marked bars found in northwestern India, initially originated in the Achaemenid Empire, rather than in the Indian heartland: Impact on the dating of Indian punched-marked coins India Early northern trade coinage. Multi punch-marked coins from the Gangetic plains were probably derived from the early Achaemenid punch-marked designs found in the Chaman Hazouri hoard. There is uncertainty regarding the actual time punch-marked coinage started in India, with proposals ranging from 1000 BCE to 500 BCE. However, the study of the relative chronology of these coins has successfully established that the first punch- marked coins initially only had one or two punches, with the number of punches increasing over time. According to Joe Cribb, the study of the Chaman Hazouri hoard suggests that Indian punch-marked coins may only go back to the mid-4th century BCE or slightly earlier, and actually started with the punch-marked coinage of the Achaemenids in the Kabul/Gandhara area. This date remains consistent with various literary works mentioning the usage of coinage in India. This early design was then adopted in the Gangetic plains to evolve towards multi-punch-marked coins. Another find that can be dated was made in Kausambi, where silver-plated forgeries imitating the early types of punch- marked coins and bars from Chaman Hazouri were found in the Mauryan Empire levels associated with the Pillar of Ashoka that can be found there. This is another indication that the earliest punch-marked coins only date from around the mid-4th century BCE, and that they were still the standard coinage of reference at the time of the early Mauryan Empire (mid-3rd century CE). However, historian Romila Thapar has stated that the punch-marked coins were in circulation before the Mauryan rule and the general opinion adhers to the 6th century BCE as the date of their introduction. Connected findings In 2007 a small coin hoard was discovered at the site of ancient Pushkalavati (Shaikhan Dehri hoard) in Pakistan. The hoard contained a tetradrachm minted in Athens circa 500/490-485/0 BCE, together with a number of local types as well as silver cast ingots.

It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000.  History  Timber truss road bridges were extensively used in New South Wales because of the high quality of local hardwoods and the shortage of steel during the early decades of settlement of the state. The timber truss was highly developed for bridges in New South Wales, perhaps more so than anywhere else in the world at that time. The McDonald truss is a significant evolutionary link in the development of timber road bridges in New South Wales and has three standard span lengths, , and .  Description  The Galston Bridge is a single-span timber McDonald truss bridge located on Galston Road. It was built between 1893 and 1894 by the NSW Department of Public Works and crosses Tunks Creek in Galston Gorge, east of Hornsby. At , the bridge is the shortest of all the remaining timber truss bridges in NSW. The bridge is supported at each end on timber abutments which also retain the road earthworks. The bridge width is between kerbs and at both ends the approach road turns sharply at right angles. This bridge will be preserved without upgrading with modern materials as it does not have to carry heavy loads due to the winding and scenic Galston Road having a load limit.

In April 2009 the condition was updated to 'good'.  Heritage listing  The Tunks Creek bridge was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 20 June 2000. , of the 91 McDonald truss bridges built in New South Wales, the Galson Bridge is one of five remaining. Timber truss road bridges have played a significant role in the expansion and improvement of the NSW road network. Prior to the bridges being built, river crossings were often dangerous in times of rain, which caused bulk freight movement to be prohibitively expensive for most agricultural and mining produce. Only the high priced wool clip of the time was able to carry the costs and inconvenience imposed by the generally inadequate river crossings that often existed prior to the trusses construction. Timber truss bridges were preferred by the Public Works Department from the mid 19th to the early 20th century because they were relatively cheap to construct, and used mostly local materials. The financially troubled governments of the day applied pressure to the Public Works Department to produce as much road and bridge work for as little cost as possible, using local materials. This condition effectively prohibited the use of iron and steel, as these, prior to the construction of the steel works at Newcastle in the early 20th century, had to be imported from England. A series of five timber truss bridges were used. These included 1865 Old PWD, 1884 McDonald, 1894 Allan, 1899 de Burgh and 1905 Dare. Each was a technical improvement on its predecessor. Timber truss bridges, and timber bridges generally were so common that NSW was known to travellers as the \\"timber bridge state\\". The bridge at Pearce's Creek was built in response to agitation for a new road to shorten the distance to market for fruit growers in the Galston area. This road would not be completed until 1895. It was also used as part of a depression relief scheme to provide work for the poor during the depression of the early 1890s. Not all believed a road up the steep grades of the gorge would be successful and believed the construction of bridges for it to be a waste of time and money. Nevertheless, bridge construction went ahead and tenders for Pearces Creek Bridge together with the nearby Berowra Creek Bridge on the Hornsby-Galston Road were called for on 5 August 1892. Thirteen tenders were received. The contract was won by Francis Boland whose tender of just over 2651 pounds was the lowest of the thirteen received. Work commenced in February 1893 and was completed by early 1894.

The director was William Merritt Chase. The school was one of the first and most popular plein air painting schools in America. During the time Chase was teaching at Shinnecock Hills he painted some of his most notable Impressionist landscapes. History Chase teaching at the Shinnecock Hills Summer School of Art Mrs. William Hoyt (Janet Ralston Chase Hoyt) was a New York philanthropist, developer, and artist. She was a summer resident of Southampton, Long Island and had the desire to start a summer art school providing training in open air landscape painting. She asked Chase to teach at the school. At that time Chase was well-regarded as a painter and a teacher. Hoyt also approached fellow Southampton residents Mrs. Henry Kirke Porter (Annie de Gamp Perrot Hegeman Porter) and Samuel Longstreth Parrish to provide financial support. Porter and Parrish provided the land for a large studio. The land abutting the studio, named the \\"Art Village\\", had residential cottages. The first classes were taught in the summer of 1891 before any construction on the studio or the \\"Art Village\\". The school rented an old farmhouse and Chase lived at the Shinncock Inn. The students could stay in Samuel Parrish's home or rent rooms in the area. The first summer was a success. By the summer of 1892 there were more than 100 students enrolled The studio and several cottages were completed, and classes were held at the location where it would continue to operated until its closure in 1902. Chase taught for two days each week. On Mondays he would hold a studio critique, reviewing the student work from the previous week. On Tuesdays Chase would set up his easel in the Shinncock Hills and paint while providing instruction. Chase encouraged his students to paint in the bright light, omitting preliminary sketches, and matching the colors painted to those observed. Students spent the rest of the week working on their paintings, either outside in the dunes, or in the studio during inclement weather. Classes were taught by other artists, for example Lydia Field Emmet taught beginning drawing. In 1897 the school made a change in the name and administration due to Chase severing his ties with the school's co-sponsor, the Brooklyn Institute. The name was changed to the Shinnecock School of Art for Men and Women. Chase became the president, with Charles Webster Hawthorne and serving as administrators. From 1891 to 1902 about 1,000 students studied at the Shinnecock Hills Summer School of Art. The school was successful, but Chase returned to spending his summers in Europe and the school closed in 1902. Students at Shinnecock Hills Summer School of Art, ca. 1895 Buildings Map of the Art Village Situated at Shinnecock Hills The Art Studio was at the northeastern edge of the property, built with an exterior of log slabs.. The interior was one large workspace, with a large 2-sided easel in the center of the room. The \\"Art Village\\" had cottages that were built by the individual owners of the residential lots. They were built in a variety of rustic styles, including Colonial Revival and early Arts and Crafts, and mostly clad in natural shingles. Several of the cottages were designed by former students Grosvenor Atterbury and Katharine Budd. The cottages were often rented out to students. The \\"Art Village\\" was designated as a Hamlet Heritage Resource Area by the Southampton Town Board in 2012. A few miles down the road a summer home and studio were built for Chase and his family. They were designed by Stanford White. Location The Shinnecock Hills Summer School of Art was located on the south fork of Long Island, New York in Shinnecock Hills just west of Southampton. At the time the school was started, the 4,000 acres of Shinnecock Hills was being developed by the Long Island Improvement Company (LIIC) which was a subsidiary of the Long Island Railroad. The school was close to the Shinnecock Hills station located on the Sag Harbor branch of the Long Island Railroad, about three hours by rail from New York City. The LIIC sold the land for the studio to benefactors Porter and Parrish. The LIIC also sold the land for the adjacent 21 residential lots (the \\"Art Village\\") to private individuals, most of whom were associated with the school. The Hoyt family, the Parrish family, and Grosvenor Atterbury purchased multiple lots. References Gallery File:Chase William Merritt A Sunny Day at Shinnecock Bay c1892.jpgW. M.

It overlies the Table Mountain Group and underlies the Witteberg Group. The Bokkeveld Group rocks are considered to range between Lower Devonian (Lochkovian) to Middle Devonian (Givetian) in age.  Background  The Cape Supergroup rocks were deposited in a purely marine setting, within a wide passive margin basin known as the Cape Basin. The rocks were deposited over a 170-million-year period ranging from approximately 485 Ma (Tremadocian) to the Early Carboniferous (about 330 Ma; late Mississippian). Up to of strata were preserved throughout. The Cape Supergroup rocks later underwent deformation during the Cape orogeny, in which the rocks were folded and thrusted upwards. The Cape orogeny formed the Cape Fold Belt and the mountains that range along the Cape and the southern parts of South Africa. An additional geological formation, the Msikaba Formation, found north of Port St. Johns in the Eastern Cape is considered to correlate with the Witteberg Group of the Cape Supergroup.Truswell, J.F., 1977. The geological evolution of South Africa. Purnell.  Geographic extent  Bokkeveld Group outcrops and exposures range from the Breede River Valley in the west to Port Alfred near Grahamstown in the east. The group displays lateral continuity throughout the length of the Cape Fold Belt. The Msikaba Formation rocks appear north-northeast of Port St. Johns in the Eastern Cape.  Stratigraphic units  The Bokkeveld Group is subdivided into three subgroups: the Ceres Subgroup and Bidouw Subgroup that are found West of 24ºE, and the Traka Subgroup found East of 24ºE. The Ceres Subgroup is found throughout the extent of the lower Bokkeveld Group exposures. The Bokkeveld Group contains five complete coarsening-upward cycles and is arranged into three distinctive facies arrangements represented by the subgroups. The geological formations are also distinguished by their sedimentology of alternating mudstone/siltstone and sandstones. The Bokkeveld Group subgroups and their respective geological formations are listed below (from oldest to youngest): _Ceres Subgroup:_ *Gydo Formation: Composed mainly of mudrock and siltstone that contain minor sandstone layers. The rock sediments of the Gydo were deposited in low-energy, offshore-prodeltaic environments. *Gamka Formation: Sandstone-rich in contrast to the Gydo, composed of fine to medium-grained feldspathic wacke, arenites and some subordinate mudstone. The sandstones are arranged in coarsening upward cycles - a greater geological feature seen in the Bokkeveld Group as a whole. Hummocky cross-bedding structures are frequently observed in this formation. The sandstones exhibit coarsening- upward cycles and hummocky cross-bedding. These features indicate that the depositional environment was a high-energy storm and wave reworked delta front or delta plain environment. The formation is abundant in invertebrate fossils, especially brachiopods. *Voorstehoek Formation: Mudstone and siltstone. Same depositional environment as the lower Gydo Formation. *Hex River Formation: Sandstones arranged in coarsening-upward sequences much like the Gamka Formation. Trace fossils of Planolites, Skolithos, and Arenicolites are found. *Tra-Tra Formation: Mudstone and siltstone-rich. *Boplaas Formation: Fine to medium-grained feldspathic wackes and arenites with minor shales and siltstone. _Bidouw Subgroup (West of 24ºE):_ *Waboomberg Formation: Mudstone and siltstone interbedded with fine-grained sandstones. *Wuppertal Formation: Fine to medium-grained sandstones and minor siltstones. *Klipbokkop Formation: Shales and siltstones with subordinate fine-grained sandstone. *Osberg Formation: Westernmost outcrops of this formation are dominated by sandstone. *Karoopoort Formation: Shale and siltstone with some minor sandstone layers. _Traka Subgroup (East of 24ºE):_ *Karies Formation: Dark-coloured shale and rhythmites are dominant. Deep marine (pelagic zone) depositional environment. *Adolphspoort Formation: Dark, wavy-bedded siltstone and micaceous shales. Eastern correlate of the Osberg Formation. *Sandpoort Formation: Reddish, lenticular bedded sandstones with minor mudstones. Plant fossils are common.  Paleontology  The bulk of the fossils found in the Cape Supergroup are eroded fragments of benthic invertebrate Malvinokaffric fauna, particularly that of various brachiopods such as Australocoelia,Boucot, A.J. and Gill, E.D., 1956. Australocoelia, a new Lower Devonian brachiopod from South Africa, South America, and Australia. Journal of Paleontology, pp.1173-1178. Australospirifer, and chonetids. Crinoids are also found, although their dis- articulated ossicles are more common, as are trace fossils such as worm burrows and feeding trails left by other invertebrates. Rarer are fossils of trilobites, bivalves, cephalopods, gastropods, ophiuroids, hyoliths, echinoids, echinoderms, conulariids, cricoconarids, and corals.Almond, J.E., 2005.

It is located within North Cascades National Park and Stephen Mather Wilderness. It rises steeply from the North Cascades Highway and Newhalem, Washington which are both set at the southern foot of the mountain. Like many North Cascades peaks, Mount Ross is more notable for its large, steep rise above local terrain than for its absolute elevation. Mount Ross honors James Delmage Ross (1872–1939), the superintendent of the Skagit River Hydroelectric Project. Ross Dam and Ross Lake also bear his name. Mount Ross was first climbed on August 17, 1969 by Jack Roper, Maurine Roper, and Jan Bergerson. The nearest higher peak is The Roost, to the north. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into the Skagit River. Climate Mount Ross is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Summary  Lost Gay Novels provides plot summaries and reviews of 50 novels, organized alphabetically by the authors' last names. The book does not comprehensively cover gay literature from the time period, nor was it designed to be a recommended reading list, but rather covers books with different outlooks on homosexuality and gay issues and the context of their times. Most of the novels included are American, though a few are from Europe. The book also provides a discussion on the characters, and presents authors who are not normally associated with homosexuality.  Importance  Lost Gay Novels is notable for documenting the gay literature subculture that was active prior to the Stonewall riots. The novels discussed in the book have historically been both ignored by researchers and overshadowed by the history of gay pulp fiction and erotica. Slide mentions that in the 1940s and 1950s, gay literature was published and given publicity, likely due to gay editors leveraging their influence in the publishing world. Widespread realization that this \\"Homintern\\" was happening was partly the influence for homosexual panic.

Description The female C. sinicus generally ranges from about . The male generally ranges between about . For adults and copepodite stages IV and above, lower temperatures result in longer prosomes. Distribution C. sinicus is found in the northwest Pacific, off of the east coast of Asia to the South China Sea. Ecology =Life cycle and reproduction= C. sinicus reproduces throughout the year. There are generally two peaks in reproduction. In the southern Yellow Sea, these peaks occur from May to July and from November to January. These peaks occur when the temperatures throughout the water column fall into its preferred temperature range of . It can tolerate ranges between for limited periods of time, and can reproduce between about . It is likely that there are two different reproductive strategies carried out during spring and autumn. In the first reproductive period, during spring, the average prosome length is high, which allows it to produce more eggs around the time of the phytoplankton bloom. During autumn, on the other hand, accumulated energy is likely used to finance reproduction. Spawning occurs at the surface during the night and dawn, with peak spawning occurring during the latter. The depth at which eggs are found varies seasonally; a study in the Sea of Japan found that eggs generally occurred at about in depth in August and September, about in November, about in June, and about in March. The depth at which eggs are found may be related to the avoidance of cannibalism by late copepodite stages and adults, as, in some cases, a lack of overlap between the vertical distribution of eggs and potential cannibals has been observed. The eggs hatch into nauplii in about one day. From August onwards, the population declines and its distribution shrinks. During this time, it is found in cooler waters; it oversummers, for example, in the Yellow Sea Cold Bottom Water, where temperatures are usually below . Adults, stage V copepodites, and some stage IV copepodites are found in the colder bottom waters, whereas copepodite stages I through III are found in the middle layer, where temperatures are between about . During this time, it still feeds actively. Relationship with humans C. sinicus is an important food of anchovies, sandeels, and sardines, which are important commercially.

It is located within North Cascades National Park and Stephen Mather Wilderness, and is situated one mile north of Mount Ross. Like many North Cascades peaks, The Roost is more notable for its large, steep rise above local terrain than for its absolute elevation. The Roost was first climbed on July 12, 1966 by John and Taffy Roper. The nearest higher peak is Glee Peak, to the north-northwest. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into the Skagit River. Climate The Roost is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The “U”-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

Early life Margaret Pender was born Margaret Teresa Doherty in 1848 or 1850 in Ballytweedy, County Antrim. Her parents were farmer, Daniel, and Margaret Doherty (née White). Her father was from a poor Catholic background, and her mother was a wealthier Presbyterian who disowned her after her marriage. She was the youngest daughter of the couple's 7 children. There was a literary and nationalist tradition in the family, her maternal grandfather, William White, and her mother were poets. Pender started to write verse from a young age. Pender was educated at home, as well as attending Ballyrobin national school and Convent of Mercy, Belfast. She trained to be a teacher, and taught for a short time in Aghagallon. She married Hugh Owen Pender, a printer, in 1869 and moved to Belast. Writing She was published in the Shamrock, the Belfast Morning News, The Nation and United Ireland, winning a number of poetry competitions. She wrote under the pseudonyms \\"Marguerite\\", \\"Colleen\\", and \\"M.T.P.\\". She also wrote serialised novels and short stories which usually has Irish nationalistic tones, that were published in Irish, American, and Australian press. Pender supported nationalist politics in her writing but also in activism. She was a prominent supported of Joseph Devlin, and was elected president of the Belfast branch of the Nationalist Association of Irishwomen, succeeding Alice Milligan. She gave lectures to both Young Ireland and the Irish Women's Association, with her name \\"sufficient to bring a large audience together.\\" In 1916, her novel O’Neill of the Glen was the source material for the first indigenous Irish film, O’Neil of the Glen (1916). The film was the first work of the Film Company of Ireland, and was adapted for the screen by W. T. Lysaght. No prints survive of the film, but reviews note the film adaptation remained very close to Pender's novel. Death and legacy Pender died at her home 7 Newington Street, Belfast, on 17 March 1920. She had three daughter and two sons, with one son, Justin (1870–1906), also a published poet. A portion of her letters are held in the British Library.

It was built by Forster and Andrews. It is also known as Pipe Organ from Bourke Street Congregational Church (former) and Forster and Andrews Pipe Organ; Galston Uniting Church Pipe Organ. The property is owned by Uniting Church in Australia. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The organ was built in 1887 by Forster and Andrews of Hull, England, for the Congregational Church, Bourke Street, Darlinghurst, to a specification designed by Mr Thomas Sharpe, organist of All Saints' Anglican Church, Woollahra. Installation was carried out by Mr Charles Richardson. The organ was a gift to the church by the three Misses Baxter, the original purchase cost being A£746 plus £50 for freight and erection. The formal opening of the organ was at a service on Sunday 10 June 1888, at which Thomas Sharpe was the organist. The organ was regularly used for worship over the next eighty years. Following church union, the Fellowship of Congregational Churches sold the Darlinghurst property in 1984. The organ remained on the site for a further three years. A small group from the Dural Uniting Church began to investigate the possibility of including this organ into the new building development on the Galston site. Enthusiasm for the proposal grew, and following a petition and Parish Council approval, an application was submitted to the Heritage Council of New South Wales for permission to remove the Heritage Fosters and Andrews organ from the Congregational Church building, Bourke Street, Darlinghurst. Also submitting an application was SCEGGS Redlands, Cremorne, and on 3 July 1986, the SCEGGS Redlands application was successful. Since the Dural application was unsuccessful, application was made to Saint Alban The Martyr Anglican Church, St Albans, to purchase their 1890 Telford and Telford pipe organ. This application was accepted, and the organ was removed and stored for refurbishing in January 1987. On or about 14 August 1986, the Galston congregation was notified that SCEGGS Redlands were undecided about finalising the purchase of the Forster and Andrews organ. Purchase of the organ by the Galston congregation was concluded by 25 August 1986, for the sum of $8,500. An application to the Heritage Council of New South Wales on 2 October 1986, approved the removal of the organ from the Darlinghurst site, and installation of it in the church at 11 School Road, Galston. It was then decided to offer the Telford and Telford organ from the St Albans church (with some refurbishment) for sale. St Mark's Anglican Church, Granville, purchased the organ for $20,000. The removal of the Fosters and Andrews organ was carried out between November 1986 and February 1987. It was stored for refurbishment, and this long and laborious task continued over the next six years. Galston Uniting Church was opened and dedicated on 22 October 1988, and the organ was gradually installed thereafter. The majority of the work was done by volunteers over seven years, with over 3,000 person hours of work. Supervision of the work was by Brown and Arkley, with the consultant for the Heritage Council of New South Wales being Mr Christopher Dearnley. The final installation detail, tuning and voicing has been undertaken by Ian Brown and Associates. The organ has been fully refurbished and installed in its new location, and the specification is unchanged from when it was built. On 6 June 1993 the organ was re-dedicated. Prayers were added to that of the Baxter sisters who at the original dedication on 12 June 1888, prayed that \\"the organ will ever be used for the purpose for which it has primarily been given, namely to glorify God by assisting the congregation to sing His praises.\\"http://galstonunitingchurch.com/pipe-organ/  Description   Heritage listing  The Pipe Organ from Bourke Street Congregational Church was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.

Its design is attributed to Henry Marcus Clark and was built from 1913 to 1914. It is also known as Mt Wilga. The property is privately owned. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 2 April 1999.  History  The North Shore railway line terminates at Hornsby, where it connects with the Main North line going to Brooklyn, Gosford, Newcastle and eventually the North Coast and Brisbane. The Northern Line was extended from Strathfield to the Hawkesbury in 1886, passing through the present suburb of Hornsby. The station was over from the village of Hornsby (modern day Normanhurst), so in 1895 the station was called Hornsby Junction to avoid confusion. In 1900 the word Junction was dropped and the area around the station became known as Hornsby; Old Hornsby was the name adopted for the present Normanhurst.Pollen & Healy, 1988, 125 Mt Wilga Estate dates from an initial purchase in 1907 of at Hornsby by Georgina Clark, wife of the successful Sydney Draper and Retailer, Henry Marcus Clark. Additional purchases of acres and were made between 1907 and 1908. In 1908 Clark built a long suspension bridge over the deep gully which lies between Mt Wilga and Hornsby railway station to facilitate the arrival of guests to the property from Sydney. Prior to Mt. Wilga, Clark had resided in \\"Sefton Hall\\" in Marrickville Road, Dulwich Hill, which was named after a property in England. Mt. Wilga was reputedly designed by the owner and planned along similar lines to his summer home \\"Sefton Hall\\" at Mount Wilson in the northern Blue Mountains. It was intended to be Marcus Clark's winter home. The original garden as planned by Clark reflected an aesthetic of defining the property boundary and main access route as well as concealing the house from direct view and then revealing the house at journey's end. A formal area of the garden was laid out to the north of the house and open paddocks and orchard to the west of the house. To the south and south east was a service area. However, Clark died in 1913 during the construction of the large single storey Federation Queen Anne style house. It was completed in 1914 by his widow, Georgina Clark. The Clark family resided at Mt Wilga until 1919. Henry's son, Les Clark built a very similar house \\"Dulcidene Homestead\\" in Dubbo. In 1926 Mrs Georgina M Clark sold the house and a portion of its land to Miss Jessie Hamilton Scott]of Hornsby who subdivided the land creating Manor Road. In 1928 the subdivision of Mt Wilga into 67 residential allotments was initiated. The large allotment containing Mt Wilga house remained in private hands until its sale in 1952 to the Commonwealth of Australia for use as a rehabilitation hospital. In 1948 the property was owned by a Dr Smallpage. The Mt Wilga Rehabilitation Hospital operated between 1952 and 1987. During the 35-year period the estate and house were altered to accommodate the functions and facilities of a rehabilitation hospital. Several large buildings were constructed on site. In 1985 Howard Tanner & Associates (HT&A;) prepared'\\"Mt Wilga, Hornsby NSW: Conservation Management Plan for the Administration Building' for the Commonwealth Department of Housing and Construction. In January 1987, Howard Tanner wrote to the then Heritage & Conservation Branch advising of the impending sale of the property by the Australian Government. In March, 1987, HT&A; wrote to the Heritage & Conservation Branch making recommendations for a site curtilage based on historic and contemporary conditions. Mount Wilga House Concern over the future of the site led to the placement of a Permanent Conservation Order (PCO) #535 over the house and some of the curtilage on 4 September 1987. This is understood to have taken place prior to the sale of the property. In late 1987 (post PCO listing) Alpha Pacific purchased the site for use as a private rehabilitation hospital, and in July, 1988, sought to subdivide the site. The Heritage Council refused the application which sought to reduce the curtilage around Mt Wilga. A modified proposal to subdivide the site into two large allotments was subsequently approved by the Heritage Council. Consequently, Lot 2 DP 792198 was sold in 1990 to the Japan-based Buddhist sect, the Nichiren Shoshu Sokagakkai Australia and run as a Buddhist Cultural Centre.1999: Austral. Archaeology, 2014, i The northern Lot 1 DP 792198 continued to operate as a private hospital. The original garden as planned by Marcus Clark reflected an aesthetic of defining the property boundary and main access route as well as concealing the house from direct view and then revealing the house at journey's end. The formal area of the garden which existed to the north of the house and open paddocks and orchard to the west of the house were lost during the development of the hospital. The extant grounds to the south and south east of the house were formerly the service area of the property. In their present state the grounds reflect the reduction of the gardens and expansion of open lawn areas, the gradual attrition and simplification of planting and the removal of the majority of the trees, associated with the institutional management of the site. In August 1991 a Conservation Management Plan was prepared by Robertson & Hindmarsh Pty Ltd for Soka Gakkai International Australia, a Buddhist group who made a number of small modifications to the house and outbuildings. These included repainting the interior and exterior of the house, recarpeting, refurbishing a former minor building into a Women's temple and various services were partially separated from the hospital to the north. Although the group planned further extensions to the temple facilities, they moved from the site in 1999 and these modifications were never initiated.Austral Archaeology, 2014, 12 The site was sold to a consortium wanting to construct a SEPP5 aged care facility.Branch report, 2008 From 1999 the site has been vacant, or served once again as a private residence. In August 1999 Scott Robertson of Robertson & Hindmarsh Pty Ltd was engaged by Mirrabeema Project Management on behalf of the Mt Wilga Village Consortium to prepare \\"Conservation Management Plan of Mt Wilga, 2a Manor Road, Hornsby\\". At its meeting of 20 January 2000, the Heritage Council provided its general terms of approval to an amended integrated development application. On 9 June 2000 delegated conditional approval was granted to the subsequent section 63 application. On 6 October 2000 delegated conditional approval was granted to a further section 63 application under the Heritage Act. Since 2006 one residential allotment facing Manor Road (known as Lot 2 in DP 1181742), outside the NSW State Heritage Register curtilage boundary, has been subdivided off the property. This lot was previously occupied by a cottage on the Mount Wilga estate, which was demolished .NBRS & Partners, 2014, 15. The site was sold in 2008 to Austcorp Project No. 1 Pty Ltd.Heritage Branch Report, 2008 Between 1999 and 2010 a series of unsuccessful attempts by several owners were made to adapt the site for medium-high density retirement living. During this time, many buildings with little heritage significance were demolished and many conservation works to the house were completed.NBRS & Partners, 2014, 13. Additions to the hospital were approved in 2011. The current owners bought the homestead site in 2011. A four-lot subdivision (three small lots on the southern boundary, one large lot for the house) was withdrawn and later a two-lot subdivision was approved (for the current owners) in 2012.  Description  ;Site Federation mansion and garden prominently sited in large groundsLEP, 1994 on the apex of a long ridge with commanding views of the surrounding countryside, including across the valley to \\"neighbouring\\" mansion, Mount Errington. ;Garden The original garden planned by Clark reflected an aesthetic of defining the property boundary and main access route as well as concealing the house from direct view and then revealing the house at journey's end. A formal area of the garden was laid out to the north of the house and open paddocks and orchard to the west of the house. To the south and south east was a service area. Despite subdivision and loss of land to the north and east, a generous area of garden surrounds the house to the east and south. This retains the core of the eastern garden, driveway and a good part of the former service area, including the tennis court, bowling green and site of the former chicken house. Subdivision and redevelopment of the hospital to the north and west has greatly altered much of the estate's land there and encroaches fairly close to the carriage loop and western boundary of Mt. Wilga. Period elements remaining on the site include border planting around the perimeter of the house. A grand drive sweeps south-west from Manor Road leading up to a fine circular carriage drive in front (north) of the house (formerly gravel, now bitumen) with central planting plot and dominant Canary Island date palm (Phoenix canariensis) to high. (This possibly dates from s as it is not evident in a 1917 photograph). The original long drive sandstone castellated gate arch structure no longer exists - it has been replaced with a modest brick pillar modern steel gates in the hospital era) but an eastern pedestrian entrance constructed of sandstone remains. This eastern entrance is covered by climbing fig (Ficus pumila var.pumila) and retains an intact wrought iron period gate. Mt Wilga's grounds include large sloping lawn areas to the house's east and south, a tennis court to its east, a bowling green to its south-east and some shrubbery (seemingly reduced in quantity). Large mature trees including Bunya Bunya pine (Araucaria bidwillii), Port Jackson or rusty fig (Ficus rubiginosa) and Monterey pines (Pinus radiata) to (probably from ) camphor laurels (Cinnammomum camphora) and brush box (Lophostemon confertus) to a 16m evergreen /southern magnolia / bull bay (Magnolia grandiflora) and crepe myrtle (Lagerstroemia indica). Along the southern boundary there is a row of turpentine trees (Syncarpia glomulifera) to 15m high which have grown since the 1950s and, further to the south-west adjoining the former service driveway to the former garage, a Himalayan cedar (Cedrus deodara), book leaf cypress/arborvitae (Platycladus orientalis) and brush box trees (now outside the boundary to the west near the former service drive). Also mature trees on site include two sweet gums (Liquidambar styraciflua), two frangipani (Plumeria rubra) flanking the front steps to the house, a rare jambos/ rose apple (Syzygium jambos) tree on the eastern boundary near the entrance drive, an ironbark tree west of the house (Eucalyptus sp., possibly E.crebra), a NZ flax bush south of the drawing room (Phormium tenax) and a large Chinese wisteria (W.sinensis) on the wire mesh fence of the tennis court. Younger tree plantings on the eastern lawn include tupelo or sour gum (Nyssa sylvatica), Camellia sasanqua, a mature Japanese maple (Acer palmatum) and native cheese tree (Glochidion ferdinandii).Stuart Read, 9 March 2012, visit. A weld-mesh boundary fence is modern (dating from the hospital era)S.Read, pers.comm. and inappropriate to the style of the grounds (LEP). ;Residence Federation mansion with face brick walls, complex steep pitched terracotta tiled roof, tall roughcast chimneys, shingled and half-timbered gables, sandstone veranda piers with simple scalloped timber valences. Unusual cylindrical polished granite colonettes support the timber veranda posts. The residence is a single storey with a basement and three- storey tower at the roof apex. Original casement windows include projecting bays with leadlight and sculpted sandstone sills. Original doors and other joinery remains. Much of the original interior survives. The residence is prominently sited in large grounds with a number of large trees and a stone gateway (LEP). = Modifications and dates = 2007-8: 88 units with basement parking: repairs and maintenance work to preserve the fabric of the building, including the: * removal of glazing to the tower reinstate the lookout at the summit o the tower; * replication of stolen items from the house (using documentary evidence) will improve the presentation of the house and allow an understanding of its decoration. This replication will restore significance that has been lessened by the theft of joinery items and lighting fixtures. * reconstruction of the stone gate will ensure its survival, restore its significance, enable an understanding of is significance as part of Marcus Clark's pedestrian link to Hornsby across the gully, enhance its appearance and ensure public safety; * relaying original tiles on a new slab will prevent subsidence and protect the tiles from substrate collapse; and * rebuilding the north-west corner of the front veranda will ensure the survival, while using the existing timber and stone elements.  Heritage listing  As at 18 September 2014, outstanding late Federation Queen Anne style mansion. Impressive multi-level roof with highly decorated gables. Unusual verandah detailing. Generally in good condition. Many interior features of note. Owned by Marcus Clark leading Sydney retailer of the time. Grounds: Remnant garden layout surrounding notable mansion.

The ministry was formed by presidential decree on April 21, 2008. History The ministry was preceded by the Headquarters of the Civil Defense, which has operated in the Armenian SSR since 1961. The 1988 Armenian earthquake (also commonly known as the Spitak earthquake) revealed many issues related to the civil defense system in Soviet Armenia and became the main force behind the restructuring of the Emergency Management Department of the Government of Armenia. Following the Declaration of State Sovereignty of Armenia by the Supreme Council of Armenia, the Emergency Department was established with Stepan Badalyan its first head. On September 4, 1997, a rescue rapid reaction unit is created, with its main tasks being to perform rescue operations in the disaster zone, as well as rendering professional assistance to the population in case of emergency incidents in the shortest possible time. In 1994, Armenia became a full member of the International Civil Defence Organization. In December 2005, the Emergency Management Department was renamed to the Rescue Service of the Ministry of Territorial Administration of the Republic of Armenia. Newly elected Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan restructured the service on 21 April 2008 as the Ministry of Emergency Situations, with Mher Shahgeldyan being the first Minister of Emergency Situations. The ministry was merged with the Ministry of Territorial Administration in December 2014 only to become an independent agency two years later.  Mission and structure  The Ministry of Emergency Situations of Armenia coordinates its services with the law of the Republic of Armenia in the sphere of citizenship and protection of citizens in the context of emergency situations. It serves to evacuate Armenian citizens during natural disasters and accidents. The ministry is composed of 5 main agencies: * Rescue Service * National Seismic Protection Service * Armgosgidromet * State Reserves Agency * National Center for Technical Security The ministry utilizes Stepanavan Airport in Lori Province to support the rescue services by fighting wildfires. Fire-fighting aircraft based there includes Beriev Be-200 aircraft, which is in the process of being purchased by the Russian government.  Symbols  The ministry provides 9 awards for exceptional employees of the ministry. * Medal \\"Cross of Glory Noah\\" * Medal \\"For the Commonwealth in the Name of Salvation\\" * Medal \\"For impeccable service\\" * Medal \\"The best fireman-rescuer\\" * Medal \\"The brave rescuer\\" * Medal \\"Honored Employee of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Republic of Armenia\\" * Medal \\"Prevention, assistance, rescue\\" * Medal \\"Veteran of the Ministry of Emergency Situations of the Republic of Armenia\\" * Badge \\"First class rescuer\\" Like the Armenian Army and the Police of Armenia, the rescue service of the ministry has a 48 member, ceremonial brass band (Poghatin Nvagaxumb) which works during public ceremonies involving the ministry. It is led by Colonel Manvel Utujyan, who previously served in the band of the Internal Troops. The brass band was founded in 2010 by Minister Armen Yeritsyan.

It was founded on 25 July 1884 by socialist Morris Winchevsky and his friend, writer Eliyahu Wolf Rabinowitz. It featured poetry (mostly Winchevsky's), transatlantic Jewish news and critiques of the local Yiddish theatre (including Sarah and Jacob Adlers' troupe). Its writing style was inspired by Aaron Liebermann (who established London's Hebrew Socialist Union), combining international commentary with local community organising. It sold for 1 penny per issue. In 1892, it was renamed to Di Tsukunft (Yiddish: די צוקונפֿט, The Future). The newspaper ceased publication after less than a year, due to ideological differences. Winchevsky, who was staunchly anti-religious, left because Rabbinowitch accepted an advertisement from Samual Montagu, who was a pillar of the religious community. Winchevsky went on to co-found the Arbeter Fraynd, which regularly criticised Montague and Britain's Chief Rabbi Herman Adler. The newspaper struggled to gain traction and published a total of 16 issues. It was quickly overtaken by the Arbeter Fraynd. The Jewish scene in London in general suffered from factionalism. The prevalence of anarchists meant Russia was not interested in supporting them. Most radical Jews ended up in New York City, including the paper's founder Morris Winchevsky. The paper claimed to \\"treat the Jew... as a man... as a Jew... as a worker\\" and listed four kinds of Jews: \\"The 'indifferent' care only about themselves; 'assimilationists' consider Jewish separateness to be the root of Jewish troubles; 'nationalists' blame the Jews' homelessness for their sufferings; 'socialists' consider the Jewish problem to be part of the general social problem, not one apart\\".

History =Colonial period= The Societies Ordinance was first introduced in 1911, replacing the Triad and Secret Societies Ordinance 1887 which only control the unlawful societies during the time the criminal activities of the secret societies, notably the Triad Societies flourished, to expand its control on all the societies. The 1911 Ordinance was soon replaced in 1920 which relieved the duty of a society to register, but instead to outlaw the Triad Society and its associated rituals. Moreover, it gave the Governor-in-Council the power to ban any society deemed to be injurious to law and order in Hong Kong. The registration of a society was reinstated in the 1949 amendment which gave the government extensive powers of supervision. Any association of ten or more persons \\"whatever its nature or object\\" was required to register. The words \\"foreign political organisations\\" were also mentioned for the first time in the bill in the light of the influx of migrants from the Chinese Civil War between the Nationalists and the Communists. After the 1956 Double Ten Riots which resulted in more than 6,000 arrests, the government introduced amendments that included the extension of the provisions to a society connected with another unlawful society, and allowed the Registrar to rescind the exemption with any society that attempted to politically influence a school. The Societies Ordinance was under review after the enactment of the 1991 Bill of Rights Ordinance, in the light of the concerns of the Hong Kong people over their civil liberties after Tiananmen Square Massacre of 1989, which had the effect of repealing any previous laws which was inconsistent with it. Major amendments were made to the Societies Ordinance in 1992 which largely relaxed the restriction on the registration of a society. =SAR period= After the transfer of the sovereignty of Hong Kong, the 1992 amendments were rolled back by the Beijing-controlled Provisional Legislative Council (PLC) in 1997, which reinstated the provisions of the power of the government to refuse to register a political body \\"that has a connection with a foreign political organisation\\" and the requirement to register with the police. In July 2018, the Hong Kong Police Force issued a notice under the Societies Ordinance to ban the Hong Kong National Party, a pro-independence party, on the basis that the party has engaged in sedition and that the party may be banned on grounds of \\"national security, public safety, public order, protection of freedom and rights of others.\\" On 24 September 2018, the Hong Kong SAR government officially declared HKNP to be an illegal society and banned the operation of HKNP.

History The church was built at the end of the 12th century, but has undergone several changes throughout its history. A church porch, later demolished, was built during the 15th century and during that century the interior of the church was also remade, and the currently visible Gothic vaults constructed. Substantial changes were also made during the 19th century. The church tower partially collapsed and was rebuilt, albeit lower, to designs by Helgo Zettervall. At the same time, in 1865, the western addition to the church was built. During a restoration in 1939-1940, the medieval murals were discovered under layers of whitewash and uncovered. Murals Interior view towards the choir with murals visible The church is richly decorated with murals from two different time periods. In the apse there are Romanesque murals from the second half of the 13th century, depicting Christ in Majesty surrounded by the symbols of the Four Evangelists. Underneath, the Apostles are depicted in a row. The other set of paintings decorate the vaults in the nave of the church. They are Gothic in style and depict religious scenes from the Bible. They were made some time before 1487, since the coat of arms of two Danish noble families (the province of Skåne was at the time Danish) from Jutland who are known to have owned estates in the area previous to that date decorate the walls. Very probably it was these two families who commissioned the painting of the murals. Furnishings The oldest item in the church is the simple baptismal font from the 12th century. The pulpit is from 1598 and made in the workshop of Jacob Kremberg. The altarpiece by Johan Ullberg is from 1774 but was moved from the apse when the murals there were discovered and uncovered. The smaller of the church bells comes from Russia and was brought to Sweden by the lord of Råbelöv Castle, who had served as a colonel in the army. It was bought by the church in 1836. The church also contains the only runestone in , the so-called (Rundata number DR 350 M).

He established the first exclusively periodontal practice in London in 1966. After he retired, he attended the University College Hospital and took a course in Holocaust studies, leading him to write the biographies of refugee dental surgeons in the UK, and assess their skills as a missed opportunity for improving the ordinary quality of interwar British dental surgery. He died shortly after completing his PhD thesis on German and Austrian Refugee Dentists 1933–1945, The Response of The British Authorities in 2007. His PhD degree was awarded posthumously and his thesis remains unpublished. Early life and career John Zamet was born in London on 11 November 1932. In 1958, three years after completing his studies in dentistry at the Royal Dental Hospital (RDH), he obtained his fellowship in dental surgery of the Royal College of Surgeons of England. With an interest in periodontology, between 1956 and 1962, he worked in the departments at the Eastman Dental Hospital, Guy's Hospital and the RDH. At the time the subject was still in its infancy in the UK. Although in the US the speciality was long established, the first British academic department was only set up in 1948 at the Eastman Dental Hospital, under W. G. Cross. He went to America in 1962 on a post-graduate fellowship to study at the University of Pennsylvania Department of Periodontics. There he came under the influence of periodontologist D. Walter Cohen. =Return to London and senior posts= On his return to the UK, Zamet was appointed senior lecturer at the RDH, and later consultant in periodontology at University College Hospital (UCH) Dental School. After the closure of the UCH school Zamet moved to the Eastman as honorary consultant in periodontology. He stayed there until he retired in 2001. Whilst at UCH and the Eastman, Zamet carried out several research projects. In 1974 he was awarded an MPhil degree by the University of London for his dissertation, A Comparative Clinical Study of Three Periodontal Surgical techniques, which examined clinical outcomes of surgical periodontal therapy. Other research was carried out into particulate bioglass grafts. In 1966, Zamet established the first, and for many years the only, singularly periodontal practice in London. He was also the first UK periodontist to participate in the Bränemark Osseointegration Programme in Göthenberg. This programme stemmed from when, in 1952 Per-Ingvar Brånemark put titanium-encased optical devices into the legs of rabbits to study the healing process. At the end of the research period, after removing the devices, they discovered unexpectedly that the titanium had fused into the bone and could not be removed. He called the process osseointegration. The toleration to long-term presence of titanium led to the potential for new research in using it to create an anchor for artificial teeth. Zamet pursued recognition for periodontology as a UK speciality and played an influential role in the establishment of the General Dental Council's Specialist Register in Periodontology. Other roles =Societies= He took up responsibilities in numerous societies, including President, Honorary Vice-President and Honorary Life Member of the British Society of Periodontology, a Life Member of the American Academy of Periodontology and an Honorary Member of the American Dental Society of London. =Alpha Omega International Dental Fraternity= At a time when Jewish students were not allowed to form social groups, a group of Jewish dental students founded The Alpha Omega International Dental Fraternity in 1907 at the University of Maryland School of Dental Medicine, which claims to be the oldest international dental organisation and the oldest international Jewish medical organisation. It eventually incorporated over 100 alumni and student chapters in ten countries. Zamet became the first and twenty-fifth chairman of the London chapter of the Alpha Omega Dental Fraternity, which sponsored numerous projects in the UK and Israel. He also served as secretary of its London Charitable Trust. At one time, he liaised with Walter Annenberg and obtained funding for postgraduate education and the Annenberg Lecture and Traveling Scholarship. Retirement and Holocaust studies Zamet retired in 2001, following which he enrolled at University College London in Holocaust studies, where he was a student of Michael Berkowitz. After completing an MA, he furthered his studies by working on a PhD thesis on German and Austrian Refugee Dentists 1933-1945, The Response of The British Authorities. In the 1930s and 1940s, displaced doctors searched the world for locations where their skills might be appreciated and where they could find a place of safety from worsening Nazi persecution. As part of his thesis, in 2005, Zamet wrote to the British Dental Journal as he attempted to \\"reconstruct the history of this brave group of professionals, who despite the odds, succeeded in a foreign country which did not want them\\". He recreated the biographies of refugee dental surgeons, and assessed their qualifications and skills as a missed opportunity for improving the quantity and quality of interwar British dental surgery. As a result, he established many contacts with surviving refugees and their families, assembling a unique compilation of sources. His research has been described by medical historian Paul Weindling as \\"outstanding\\" and \\"exceptional\\". Zamet compared dental training at the University of Vienna with that in Britain in the 1930s, concluding that the \\"dilapidated state of British dental health and dentistry\\" at that time was a \\"cottage industry\\". Despite demonstrating a British need for them, of the 360 Viennese dental surgeons (stomatologists) that applied to the General Medical Council (GMC) to register on the Dental Register, there being no General Dental Council until 1956, only 41 were granted registration, and only after re-certification. Many of those disallowed registration and therefore denied entry to the UK, \\"despite their excellent training, probably died during the Holocaust\\" or were led to suicide. Death and legacy Weindling attributes the loss of records and lack of archival material on migrant practitioners in general to the delay in “Vergangenheitsbewältigung”, that is, the coming to terms with the past. He consequently relates Zamet as a \\"pioneer\\" in this field and a historian of refugee dental surgeons, while other medical professionals have yet to find their historian. Zamet completed his PhD thesis in December 2006. He died on 5 May 2007,Find a will. Gov.UK. Retrieved 2 August 2018. and his PhD degree was awarded posthumously in 2007. In acknowledgement of his contributions to periodontology, in 2011 the London Chapter and Charitable Trust established a John Zamet Memorial Prize in Periodontal Research open to UK-based postgraduate dental students studying for a master's degree or PhD who are undertaking or who have recently completed original research associated with clinical periodontology. It is awarded every second year.

He is perhaps most famous for painting the Kaos Temple in Llanera, Asturias, Spain. His murals can be seen on buildings and objects across the world in India, Mali, France, the United States, Japan, Chile, Brazil, Peru, South Africa, Mexico, Canada, Morocco, Ukraine and Spain. Biography Born Oscar San Miguel Erice in Santander, Spain, Okuda began producing recognizable graffiti along railroad tracks and on abandoned factories in his hometown around 1997. After receiving a Bachelor of Fine Arts from the Complutense University of Madrid in 2007, he began to produce works in his studio, which led to shows in New York, Berlin, London and Paris. Around 2009, he also began producing sculpture. In 2011, his sculpture began to exhibit the colorful, frequently triangular geometric patterns for which he became known. His early works focus on birds, stars, naked women, skulls and faces. Many of Okuda's human characters are painted in grayscale. Okuda received international renown after painting the interior of the church of Santa Barbara in Llanera, Asturias, Spain, in 2015. After a group of donors purchased the church and turned it into a skate park, they agreed with Okuda to paint the interior. Following its debut, the church was renamed the Kaos Temple. In 2015, he also began producing 3D sculpture of animal heads in fiberglass bearing his signature colorful geometric patterns. The following year, Okuda painted another abandoned church with a 360-degree mural in Marrakesh, Morocco, which he titled \\"11 Mirages to Freedom.\\" In 2017, Okuda was named among the most recognized contemporary urban artists by Graffiti Art Magazine. His outdoor works appear in Spain, Morocco, Miami, Paris, Edmonton, Vancouver, and Toronto. His tallest outdoor mural is a multithemed painting on a 23-story student residence in Toronto completed in 2018. Characteristics of his work The work of Okuda San Miguel is predominantly characterized by geometric structures and multicolored prints. These are sometimes associated with gray bodies, and often include headless figures, religious references, symbols, animals and giant heads. Art critics catalog his style as pop surrealism with a clear street influence of urban art, though his style has not been exempt from controversy. His works focus on contradictions in existentialism, the meaning of life and the false freedom of capitalism, particularly on the conflict between modernity and our human roots. He is interested in pop art, especially in cinema and fashion, as well as in the light and color of other cultures, which allows him to incorporate all these interests to his style. Sometimes he looks for inspiration in great classic works such as the Garden of the Delights of El Bosco or Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci. As influences, he cites René Magritte, Max Ernst, Yayoi Kusama, Takashi Murakami and Hieronymus Bosch. Selected exhibitions =Solo exhibitions= * \\"Horses and muses\\" Hashtag Gallery, Toronto.

The palace was constructed by Jaime Marquet between 1755 and 1766 as a summer residence for the Dukes of Alba, and currently houses a school. History Where once was a medieval castle belonging to the Álvarez de Toledo family, the French architect Jaime Marquet constructed a palace for Fernando de Silva, 12th Duke of Alba between 1755 and 1766. The duke used the palace as a summer residence. His granddaughter María Cayetana de Silva, 13th Duchess of Alba invited to the palace famous visitors such as the painter Francisco Goya The palace suffered damage during the Napoleonic wars and the Spanish civil war. The interior was burned down and looted, however, the exterior remained without alterations. The city council of Piedrahita bought the palace in 1931. It has been declared a monument in 1993. The palace houses now a school and the gardens are a public park.

It is located on the Schlossberg north of Burg (Spreewald).  Architecture  About 1.5 million red clinker bricks were used for the construction. The building has a square base one meter high and an edge length of 13.77 meters. The first floor is square with an edge length of 9.35 metres. There is a memorial hall surrounded by 28 pillars. Above it is an octagonal dome. There are viewing platforms at heights of 5 and 18 metres respectively. In 1999 another exit was installed on the tower head, increasing the height of the tower from 27 to 28 meters.  History  In 1900 there were first plans to build an observation tower near Burg. At that time, the decision was made for the Schlossberg as a location. In 1910 it was decided to build a Bismarck Tower and the initiators began to collect donations. Architect Bruno Möhring from Berlin was commissioned to create a design. The design was carried out by the Cottbus architect Hermann Hauke. The outbreak of the First World War delayed construction work, which only began in the spring of 1915 and lasted two years. The tower also became a memorial to the soldiers who died in the war. During the Third Reich, solstice celebrations were held on the site. In 1944 a military observation point was established on the tower. The Wehrmacht used the tower as a radio control centre. In 1945 the tower was prepared for demolition but this could be prevented. After 1945 \\"ideological components\\" - such as Bismarck's coat of arms and his bust - were removed. The fire bowl on the top of the tower was dismantled. In 1951 the tower was renamed the \\"Tower of Youth\\". Between 1950 and 1990 the tower was closed to the public for strategic military reasons. The tower was finally renamed \\"Bismarckturm\\" again on October 3, 1990 with a public festival and made accessible to the public again.

It was built by Coney Island-based manufacturer William F. Mangels 1906–1909, with wooden horses carved by Marcus Illions. The carousel has been relocated and refurbished several times over its history. The B&B; Carousell has been located in Luna Park since 2013. The \\"Carousell\\" in the attraction's name is derived from the way Mangels's brochures spelled the word, while the \\"B&B;\\" refers to two former owners. Charles Carmel crafted replacement horses for the B&B; Carousell in 1927, and August Wolfinger painted murals on the carousel's rounding boards in the 1940s. It is the last operating carousel in Coney Island, and in 2016, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Description The carousel consists of fifty horses and two chariots. There are 18 \\"sections\\" of horses connected to spokes that revolve around the center of the carousel. Sixteen of the sections each contain three horses located side-by-side. Thirty-six of the horses, within twelve of the eighteen sections, can move up and down. These horses are connected to brass poles with spiral-groove designs, which in turn are connected to the cranking rods at the top of each section, which rotate when the carousel is in motion. Fourteen of the horses, as well as both chariots, do not move. Twelve of the stationary horses are spread across four sections. The other two stationary horses are located side-by-side with each of the chariots, which take up the space normally occupied by two horses. The stationary horses are also connected to poles, which are connected to stationary rods at the top of each section. The original horses were created by carousel-horse carver Marcus Illions, but most of them were replaced by carvings from Charles Carmel in 1927. The horses and chariots are installed on a rotating wooden platform, with its inner and outer edges painted red. The sizes of the horses vary: the largest horses are located on the outside, while the smallest horses are located on the inside. Each of the horses is designed with different motifs and colors, and appear in \\"a variety of dramatic poses\\". The pole connected to the lead horse contains a plaque stating: \\"Abraham Lincoln Centennial Horse. Riders Not Permitted. Built by MC Illions. 1909.\\" To celebrate Abraham Lincoln's 100th birthday in 1908, Illions had carved four horses for different carousels. This particular horse was originally installed on the Stubbman Carousel in 1908. It is the only horse originally carved by Illions that is still in situ on the B&B; Carousell. The exterior of the B&B; Carousell building as seen from the Riegelmann Boardwalk during the offseason. The carousel frame was built by William F. Mangels. The center of the carousel contains a large pole, which is hidden by a fairground organ on one side and gold-framed mirrors on the other three sides. The organ was built by Gerbruder-Bruder and imported from Germany around 1917. It was originally a 69-key organ before the Brooklyn-based B.A.B. Organ Company refurbished it into a 66-key instrument in the 1930s, and is one of three such organs in known existence. For a time after the carousel opened, outsiders could try to grab the single brass ring in order to gain a free ride. The brass ring was later removed for monetary reasons, though onlookers could still grab steel rings. The carousel's sweeps—horizontal beams under the roof that connect to the center pole and to poles bolted to the outer edge of the rotating wooden platform—are painted white. The sweeps, which radiate from the center, are held together by a series of cross sweeps, which run in a polygonal shape around the center of the carousel. These cross sweeps also have colored flower designs. The B&B; Carousell is bordered by Riegelmann Boardwalk to the south, West 16th Street to the east, and MCU Park to the west and north. The Thunderbolt roller coaster is located just east of the carousel. The B&B; Carousell is located inside a cylindrical building pavilion, which was built between 2011 and 2013 when the carousel was relocated to Luna Park. A large sign with the word \\"Carousell\\" is hung near the top of the building's exterior. The rounding boards, which are the panels located on the top of the carousel building's exterior, contain painted depictions of motifs representing the United States, such as the United States Flag, the bald eagle, Abraham Lincoln, and the Statue of Liberty. History The B&B; Carousell is one of more than two dozen carousels that have operated on Coney Island throughout the area's history. In Coney Island's heyday, it contained up to a dozen carousels at a time, and there were four wooden carousels on Surf Avenue alone. By the late 1880s, the first carousel manufacturers had opened in Coney Island, and by the early 1900s, the island had several carousels. There was even a \\"Coney Island\\" style of carousel horses. = Early history = View looking west from Riegelmann Boardwalk; the B&B; Carousell is the structure with the multicolored sign at bottom center, just behind the sign for the Thunderbolt roller coaster. The Parachute Jump can be seen in the background, behind the carousel building. Mangels and Illions constructed the B&B; Carousell at Coney Island between 1906 and 1909. The carousel was initially located in New Jersey; it was likely first installed at Asbury Park, then moved to Lake Hopatcong in 1927. Around the same time that the carousel was relocated to Lake Hopatcong, Charles Carmel carved the two chariots, as well as replacements for most of Illions's horses. In 1932, the carousel was sold to William Bishoff and Herman Brienstein. The \\"B&B;\\" in the carousel's name refers to Bishoff and Brienstein, and \\"Carousell\\" is the spelling used in Mangels's catalogs. The carousel was moved back to Coney Island by 1934–1935, and was sited at 1043 Surf Avenue near West 12th Street. Five years later, the carousel was moved to another location on Surf Avenue. In the 1940s, August Wolfinger was commissioned to paint the carousel's rounding boards. Coney Island's allure as an amusement area began to wane in the 1960s and 1970s. James McCullough and Mike Saltzstein purchased the B&B; Carousell in 1973. By 1979, it was one of the last remaining carousels in the city. By that time, a single ride on the carousel cost 50 cents. When Saltzstein died in 2001, the B&B; Carousell was the only remaining amusement attraction on Coney Island located north of Surf Avenue. Out of the 2,000 to 3,000 wooden carousels produced between 1880 and 1930, the B&B; Carousell was one of about 175 that remained. = Restoration = Shortly before Saltzstein's death, the land under the B&B; Carousell had been purchased by developer Joe Sitt. After Saltzstein's death, McCullough found it difficult to continuing operating the attraction, and Sitt evicted McCullough once the lease on the carousel expired. The carousel was proposed to be auctioned off. In 2005, a private donor purchased the carousel and gave it to the government of New York City, which stored the carousel at Brooklyn Army Terminal. Starting in 2008, the horses of the B&B; Carousell were restored by carousel restorer Todd W. Goings in Marion, Ohio. According to The New York Times, the restoration involved synthesizing and applying more than 80 colors that most closely matched the horses' original tones, using brushes made of several animals' natural bristle. The final part of the restoration included new horsehair tails for the 50 horses. The New York City Economic Development Corporation paid $1,700,000 for the restoration. In 2011, the city announced that the B&B; Carousell would be reinstalled at Steeplechase Plaza within Luna Park. It reopened in 2013 at the Steeplechase Plaza section of Luna Park, near the former site of Steeplechase Park. The B&B; Carousell was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2016. It is Coney Island's last operating carousel.

While the prescription for success worked flawlessly on the larger boats, the 22 had a few problems of scale that were corrected during manufacture of the boat into the late '80s...As with most boats this size, the market the original 22 found itself in was mainly composed of first-time buyers with little knowledge to let them justify the 22's price. I was amazed when Mark Ellis reminded me that the original 22 had an enclosed head and full galley.

The castle dates back to the 12th century when king Ferdinand II of León built a watchtower on a site overlooking the river Tormes.

He made his first appearance during the twenty-ninth series episode \\"If You Could Bottle It\\", which was broadcast on 18 July 2015. Venn's casting was announced on 13 February 2015 and he began filming at the show's studios that same week. Jacob is a former army medic turned nurse, who is given a job at Holby City Hospital after he brings a patient into the Emergency Department (ED). Jacob is portrayed as being direct, confident, manipulative and unconventional. Jacob was given connections within the ED through fellow nurse Louise Tyler (Azuka Oforka) and consultant Elle Gardner (Jaye Griffiths). His early storylines saw him implement a \\"controversial\\" protocol in the ED, held hostage by terrorists and then shot by a police officer. Jacob is seen struggling with the IPCC's decision not to take action against the officer. The character has had an on- off relationship with Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing), which became popular with viewers who gave them the portmanteau #Jonnie on social media. The couple's relationship was tested several times. Later storylines have seen Jacob revealed as the biological father of Elle's son, Blake Gardner (Kai Thorne). In June 2018, Jacob's was given a new love interest in the form of paramedic Sam Nicholls (Charlotte Salt). Exploration of the character's background will begin in September 2018, upon the arrival of his mother Omo (Ellen Thomas). For his portrayal of Jacob, Venn won the Favourite Male TV Personality accolade at the 2016 Screen Nation Film and Television Awards. Critics have had a mixed response to the character, with Alison Graham of the Radio Times calling him \\"a cocky narcissist\\", while Elaine Reilly from What's on TV thought he had become \\"one of the foundations of the ED\\". Casting On 13 February 2015, the BBC Media Centre announced Charles Venn had joined the cast of Casualty as new nurse Jacob Masters. Venn began filming at the show's Roath Lock Studios that same week. Of his casting, Venn commented, \\"It's truly a pleasure and honour to be part of Casualty as it's such a successful long- standing medical drama. I'm keenly relishing the challenge and my time in Cardiff and I look forward to tackling the role of nurse Jacob.\\" Shorty after he was cast as Jacob, Venn's mother told him that he would be working alongside his cousin, Azuka Oforka (who plays Louise Tyler). Venn admitted that he had no idea they were related, but called it a \\"wonderful surprise\\" and said they had worked on a storyline together. Venn filmed five months worth of scenes before they aired. He made his first appearance as Jacob during the episode broadcast on 18 July 2015. Development =Characterisation= In his fictional backstory, Jacob was an army medic and then a highly experienced nurse, whose focus is on saving lives. He comes from South London and has developed \\"a down-to-earth and streetwise attitude\\", which allows him to help the more challenging patients. Executive producer Oliver Kent stated that Jacob would create excitement and \\"ruffle a lot of feathers\\". Venn told a reporter for The Sunday Post that Jacob is \\"confident\\", \\"unconventional\\" and is direct, which annoys some people. His nursing style is \\"controversial, but he definitely gets the job done\\". Venn also said that his character would divide opinion, and people will either think Jacob is \\"a cool dude\\" or an \\"arrogant fella\\". But Jacob does not mind if he is not liked, he just wants to be respected. The character's profile on BBC Online stated that he has a \\"maverick attitude\\", but he is courageous and \\"Holby's answer to Robin Hood\\". Venn compared Jacob to his EastEnders character Ray Dixon. Although they are very different, Venn thought they were both \\"charming\\", but Jacob is more manipulative than Ray. Venn told Allison Jones from Inside Soap that he enjoys wearing Jacob's medical scrubs. He likened them to the uniforms worn by characters in Star Trek, which he felt gave them \\"swagger\\". He found that Jacob's uniform had the same effect on his portrayal of the character, and found that \\"it gives me an extra spring in my step, and it makes me feel two inches taller.\\" =Introduction= The character's first scenes saw him entering the Emergency Department (ED) of Holby City Hospital and demand treatment for his friend. When Connie Beauchamp (Amanda Mealing) learns that Jacob is a nurse, she tells him that the hospital is currently advertising for one. Venn explained that Connie is impressed by Jacob and his confidence. He continued, \\"Jacob wins his position in an unconventional, but effective manner – that's how he rolls.\\" Jacob also wins over his new colleagues with his \\"subordination\\" of Connie. The character was given immediate connections within the ED through nurse Louise Tyler and consultant Elle Gardner (Jaye Griffiths). Jacob trained with Louise, while he attended the same school as Elle and they become good friends. One of the Jacob's early storylines saw him implement a \\"controversial\\" gun and gangs protocol in the ED, following the admittance of a teenager who has been shot. Knowing Jackson (Louis Chandler- Joseph) is a member of a gang, Jacob worries that the hospital could be the setting for a revenge attack. Connie gives permission for his new protocol to go ahead and Jacob expresses confidence that it will prevent further incidents. However, Jackson's partner Roxanne (Tiffany Brown) is later stabbed in the ED. =Shooting= During the thirtieth series episode \\"Belief\\", Jacob is involved in a terrorist incident at the hospital and is shot by a police officer. The storyline begins with an attack carried out on an extremist vigilante group, who have been vandalising mosques. The assailant is brought into the ED along with those who have been injured, and Connie suspects that trouble between the two groups is forthcoming. A gunman then opens fire in reception, forcing an evacuation of the hospital, so he and his friends can attack the leader of the vigilante group. Realising that some of their colleagues are still inside, Connie and Jacob manage to sneak back in and find themselves held hostage in the boardroom. A spokesperson told Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap that the police are informed that one of the armed terrorists is dressed as a nurse, so when Jacob manages to get hold of a gun, the police open fire without asking questions. Connie struggles to save Jacob, and his condition initially worsens, before he stabilises. Jacob returns to work a few weeks later, concerning his colleagues, who worry that he is coming back too soon. Jacob throws himself into his work and starts undermining authority \\"in his usually brash manner\\". But when he learns that the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) want to pin the blame on him for the shooting, he \\"begins to unravel\\". Connie calms him down and after she convinces him to visit a counsellor, they almost share a kiss. The storyline concluded with Jacob's attempt to find out the name of the officer who shot him and get his revenge, after he learns that the IPCC are not taking any action against the officer. Jacob shows that he is not happy with the development and makes a call to one of his \\"dodgy contacts\\" in an attempt to find out the officer's name. =Relationship with Connie Beauchamp= Upon his introduction, it was shown that Jacob was attracted to Connie and Venn thought they would make a good couple. Venn said Connie was impressed by Jacob's style and confidence, and he observed that Connie is looking for \\"an assertive man who knows what he wants and is very good at his job\\". Connie initially denies her own attraction to Jacob. The show's annual autumn trailer later showed the couple becoming close and engaging in an arm wrestling contest. Jacob and Connie's attraction to one another culminated in them sharing a kiss in Connie's office. The storyline begins with the pair working together to save a patient in the back of an overturned ambulance. Venn explained to Sarah Ellis, \\"It's a very highly charged situation, which leads to an intimate moment for the two of them.\\" The actor admitted to feeling emotional about the episode, as Jacob becomes invested in patient, Flo's (Alison Pargeter) situation. As Jacob and Connie treat Flo for a leg injury, she tells them that she is meeting up with her love interest, who has flown over from Australia to take her back with him. Connie thinks Flo's boyfriend is a fraud, but Jacob has faith that he will show up. Ellis observed that Jacob's \\"romantic outlook on the situation starts to thaw her icy heart\\". When Flo dies from her injuries, Jacob and Connie seek comfort in each other. Venn stated that before the episode, he had viewers asking him when Jacob and Connie were going to get together, as they were enjoying their chemistry. However, he also said that the couple would be in for a bumpy ride after their moment together. Connie realises how strong her feelings for Jacob are when he risks his own life to save her. The soon become a couple, but when they are seen kissing by Connie's daughter Grace Beauchamp (Emily Carey), Connie is forced to choose between them both. Producers implemented a break-up for the couple. On-screen, Connie and Jacob argue, and Connie ends the relationship in order to focus on her daughter. Later that day, Jacob goes out with the paramedics and attends to a patient left injured after a building collapse. When a doctor is needed at the scene, Connie \\"doesn't hesitate\\" and it becomes obvious to everyone that she still loves Jacob. Connie is forced to amputate the patient's arm to get him out, but she and Jacob start arguing again and they fall through the floor when the roof suddenly caves in. Both Connie and Jacob are trapped in the basement and sand begins pouring in. Venn admitted that the scenes were some of the most challenging he had filmed during his time with the show. He and Mealing chose to stay in the purpose built basement set, so they would create \\"as much as a claustrophobic, enclosed feel as possible\\". When Connie and Jacob realise that they are going to be buried alive, she radios the hospital to say goodbye to Grace. However, they are soon rescued by their colleagues and the fire brigade. When asked by Elaine Reilly of What's on TV if the couple would reconcile, Mealing expressed her desire to see them back together, as it was obvious they still cared for one another. Of Connie's feelings, she explained, \\"I think Jacob is the only person she's really loved. He's the only person she's allowed into her life fully. She's very guarded. To Connie being in love is a vulnerable place. Jacob is the only person she allowed in, but even then she pushed him away!\\" Weeks later, Jacob has another near-death experience, which leads to a reconciliation with Connie. The former couple are driving to a conference, where Jacob is due to give a speech, when they are flagged down by another driver, who tells them a man is stuck in a storm drain. Jacob jumps in the water \\"without a thought for his own safety\\", but is soon swept downstream by the current. A spokesperson said Connie is left to \\"watch in horror\\" as Jacob heads towards a waterfall. However, he manages to pull himself up onto a bank, before going back in to help the man and get him out. Jacob's actions lead Connie to realise how close she was to losing him. She supports him when he admits that he has a fear of public speaking, before his presentation. Connie and Jacob are soon \\"getting hot and heavy\\" in her room, and Ellis (Inside Soap) wondered if they could make their relationship work this time. Grace soon discovers that her mother and Jacob are back together, and she is initially unhappy about the development. The relationship is soon tested by an accident that sees Connie and Grace injured after their car plunges into a ravine. During \\"Too Old for This Shift\\", the helicopter transporting Grace to the hospital crashes. Mealing told David Brown of Radio Times that the accident would impact Connie's relationship with Jacob, leaving it strained. Mealing also admitted that she liked her character's relationship with Jacob, and felt that he matched her. Jacob tries to support Connie through Grace's recovery, but their relationship starts to cool off. When Connie blames fellow consultant and Jacob's friend Elle Gardner for Grace's condition, it leads to the couple breaking up for a second time. In September 2017, series producer Lucy Raffety confirmed that there were no immediate plans to reunite Connie and Jacob, saying \\"Her and Jacob remain friends, absolutely.\\" =Fatherhood= Series producer Lucy Raffety teased a long- running storyline between Jacob and Elle Gardener in September 2017, saying \\"Something massive happens with Elle and Jacob which totally redefines their friendship forever. That is a wonderful story and I'm really excited about that.\\" Venn stated that Jacob's life is changed forever by a big revelation from Elle. In the lead up to the moment, Jacob tries to help find Elle's son Blake (Kai Thorne), who has skipped school because he is struggling to get along with his father and Elle's new partner.In late 2017, Jacob learns that he has fathered a child with his best friend Elle Gardener, played by Jaye Griffiths (pictured). Venn explained Jacob has often helped out with Blake in the past and comes across as \\"a cool uncle\\", who Blake looks up to. Jacob eventually locates Blake, who appears to be drunk. Venn said, \\"Jacob makes clear to Blake that he has messed up, and his mum is going to eventually find out what he's done.\\" Elle realises that Blake has injured himself after stealing alcohol from a shop, and Jacob helps to calm things down between mother and son. Elle then reveals that Jacob is Blake's biological father. She explains that she conceived after they had a one-night stand during a bad patch in Elle's marriage. Griffiths revealed that she and Venn had known about the storyline from the moment she joined the cast. They made time to rehearse the reveal scene and Griffiths admitted that it was hard, saying \\"We tried to avoid Elle and Jacob having a Star Wars 'I am your father' moment, which was very tricky!\\" Griffiths thought Elle was always planning on telling Jacob the truth, but she struggled to find the right moment. The actress added that Elle and Jacob's friendship would be broken after her revelation. Jacob tells Elle that he does not want to take parental responsibility for Blake. He takes a brief holiday and on his return, he tries to avoid Elle. When Blake is later brought into the ED, Jacob gets involved and offers his son some advice. Without talking to Elle first, Jacob tells Blake that he is his father. Shortly after, Blake's fellow student Miles Ashworth (Finney Cassidy) is admitted to the ED with a serious head injury, and Jacob reveals that Miles has been bullying their son. Blake is soon arrested for assault. Both Jacob and Elle accompany Blake to court, but Elle leaves when she learns that Miles has been readmitted to the hospital in a bad condition. Jacob, who has been left \\"holding the fort\\", agrees to give Blake a character reference when Elle does not return. Blake is not given a prison sentence and he leaves court with his parents. He then tells his mother that he wants to move in with Jacob, leaving Elle \\"noticeably devastated\\". =Relationship with Sam Nicholls= In April 2018, a potential romance between Jacob and paramedic Sam Nicholls (Charlotte Salt) was teased in the show's annual spring trailer. A couple of months later, the storyline began with Jacob providing support to Sam, after she endures a \\"traumatic\\" incident that occurred during her shift. They grow closer when Sam offers to give Blake some boxing lessons. Venn told Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap that Jacob sees Sam as someone who is \\"strong, confident, and very self-assured\\". He likes women who challenge him, and he feels that Sam can do that, plus they have \\"an unexpected\\" spark. Jacob also appreciates Sam's help with Blake, as he is still getting used to being a father. Following a night shift, Sam thanks Jacob for his recent support and invites him to have breakfast with her, where they flirt and Jacob realises that she may have feelings for him. Sam challenges Jacob to a boxing match and reckons she will win, which Jacob think is unlikely. Venn commented, \\"He's a bit blasé about things, he sees it as a fun form of courtship!\\" Sam manages to knock Jacob down and they share a kiss, before Jacob falls unconscious. Venn joked that it was probably because Jacob's blood pressure was just starting to rise. Venn also explained that both Jacob and Sam want their relationship to work, and they enjoy keeping it a secret, but it soon becomes a problem as Blake grows closer to Sam. When Sam dies, Jacob \\"has some emotional moments\\" as he deals with his grief and comes to terms with her death. He also has to support Blake, who developed a crush on her. =Mother= Further exploration of the character's background began in September 2018, upon the introduction of his mother Omo Masters, played by Ellen Thomas. Sophie Dainty of Digital Spy said Jacob has a \\"complicated past\\" and series producer Lucy Raffety commented that mother and son would not have \\"a happy family reunion\\". Blake meets up with Omo for the day, but when she becomes agitated, Blake is forced to call an ambulance and she is admitted to the ED. Jacob is \\"stunned\\" to see his mother, as they have been estranged for several years, and he tells Elle that Omo suffers from schizophrenia. Omo becomes further distressed when the voices in her head grow louder, and Jacob and Elle soon find her standing in the middle of the ED, having pulled out her cannula. Reception For his portrayal of Jacob, Venn won the Favourite Male TV Personality accolade at the 2016 Screen Nation Film and Television Awards. He was also longlisted for Best Newcomer at the 21st National Television Awards. Alison Graham of the Radio Times had a mixed response to the character. Following his debut, she branded him \\"a cocky narcissist\\". In a later review, Graham dubbed him \\"the hunky new nurse\\", whose \\"inability to find a shirt\\" had attracted attention from his female colleagues. Graham thought Jacob was \\"an insufferable know-it-all\\" and hoped he would have \\"a spectacular fall from grace very soon\\". Holly Wade, writing for the same publication, said \\"Senior Staff Nurse Jacob has ruffled feathers since he joined the ED a few weeks ago. He's impulsive and bossy but nonetheless pretty impressive.\\" Inside Soap's Allison Jones called him \\"no- nonsense\\" and thought he would be \\"a controversial character\\". She also thought that he would make a big impression on the ED, like Venn's EastEnders character Ray Dixon did on Albert Square. Elaine Reilly from What's on TV wrote, \\"When Jacob first joined the team he was cocky in the extreme. These days Jacob's mellowed into a confident, expert senior nurse and one of the foundations of the ED. Jacob has a red-hot temper. It's mostly under control – but not always!\\" Kayleigh Dray, writing for Closer believed that Connie and Jacob were \\"perfect for one another\\". The couple became popular with viewers, who dubbed them \\"#Jonnie\\" on social media. A Daily Mirror reporter branded Jacob \\"hunky\\", and they observed that he was \\"the hero of the Emergency Department\\" after correctly diagnosing two poisoned patients. When Jacob helped a man talk to his crush, another reporter for the publication commented that he was \\"Fancying himself as a bit of a ladies' man, and channelling Ryan Gosling in romcom Crazy Stupid Love.\\" The Mirror's Nicola Methven dubbed the character a \\"hunky, maverick nurse\\". After Elle told Jacob that Blake was his son, Reilly (What's on TV) branded them a \\"traumatised trio\\".

East Campus, along with West Campus, make up most of Duke's main campus. The campus follows the Georgian architecture style, making it distinct from West Campus. Currently, East Campus is the exclusive residential home to first-year students. It borders Trinity Historic District to the east and Walltown Neighborhood to the north.  History  The first history of Duke University traces back to its founding in 1838 in Trinity, North Carolina. Much to the dislike of the Methodist preachers, under the leadership of the college's President John F. Crowell, Washington Duke made a donation to the college large enough to build a new campus in Durham, North Carolina and move the college. The new campus was constructed over the course of the last decade of the nineteenth century. Original Bell Tower (circa 1899) In 1911, the Washington Duke Building was destroyed in a fire. The university created the buildings East Duke and West Duke (not to be confused with East Campus and West Campus) to serve as a replacement with expanded classroom and office space. In 1938, after the opening of Duke's West Campus for the then all-male undergraduate Trinity College of Arts and Sciences, East Campus became the exclusive campus for Duke's Undergraduate Women's College. Unlike West Campus, where the campus is surrounded by forest owned by the university, East Campus is surrounded by private property not owned by the university. Thus, much of Duke's development, except for living spaces, has occurred on West Campus. In 1972, as part of the merging of Duke's Women's College and Duke's Men's Trinity College, the campus became coeducational. Unlike at Harvard University, where the merger between its all-female Radcliffe College and all- male Harvard College took 22 years, the coeducational merger between Duke's undergraduate colleges were merged in a single year. In 1997, as part of a university-wide change, East Campus became solely the housing for first-year students. This decision was made so that each Duke undergraduate class would feel a sense of connectedness, and it also allows students to better understand the SLG, Greek, or Independent House groups they are eligible to join in the second semester of their first year. In 2018, Duke opened Trinity Dorm to offset the closings of the historic East and Epworth houses.  First- year Housing  Unlike that of West Campus, East Campus is not organized into quadrangles, rather it has individual houses and residential halls. Because East Campus is only for first-year students, the campus does not have housing for Selected Living Groups or Greek Organizations. The joining process for these organizations occurs in the spring of an undergraduate's first-year. = Residence Halls = The Residence Hall concept represents the newer dormitories on East Campus. The dormitories are typically larger than their older \\"house\\" counterparts. * Bell Tower Residence Hall * Blackwell Residence Hall * Randolph Residence Hall * Gilbert-Addoms Residence Hall * Trinity Residence Hall = Houses = Although the \\"house\\" style dormitories are smaller and older than the newer Residence Halls on West Campus, Duke has recently renovated many of the \\"houses.\\" Marketplace Dining Facility * Epworth House, the oldest structure still in operation at Duke University, originally opened in 1892 * Alspaugh House * Bassett House * Brown House * East House * Giles House * Jarvis House * Pegram House * Southgate House * Wilson House = Student Union = First-year students who live on East Campus often eat at the original Trinity College Student Union (commonly called \\"Marketplace\\").

West Campus, along with East Campus, make up most of Duke's main campus. The campus follows the Collegiate Gothic architecture style, inspired by the mid-18th century Gothic Revival style, making it distinct from East Campus.  History  James Buchanan Duke's relationship with the Horace Trumbauer Architectural Firm began in 1912, when he commissioned the \\"costliest home\\" on New York City's Fifth Avenue according to The New York Times. In 1924, Horace Trumbauer's firm was commissioned to build a new campus for Duke University. In 1925, Julian Abele, a prominent architect and the first African-American graduate of the University of Pennsylvania who at the time worked for Trumbauer, began work on a rendering of the proposed West Campus. This rendering included the Duke Chapel (one of the tallest university chapels in the world according to Princeton University archives), the first four housing quadrangles (now Craven, Crowell, Few, and, Kilgo), the library (now Perkin's Library), Student Union (now the Richard H. Brodhead Center), and departmental buildings. In 1938, the original West Campus opened at once, to serve as the expanded home for Duke's Trinity College of Arts and Sciences, at the time an all-the male undergraduate college. By 1928, the Cameron Indoor Stadium for Duke Men's Basketball and the Wallace Wade Stadium for Duke Men's Football had opened. Both stadiums have been renovated in recent years, and renovations were completed by 2017. In July 1939, the Board of Trustees approved the first expansion to the original West Campus, adding the Few Quadrangle, houses FF, GG, and HH. Although previous dorms on the university had meeting spaces, these dorms were the first in Duke's history to include common spaces for students throughout the house to interact. Since this time, most of Duke's dormitories have been retrofitted to include common rooms. In 1968, the Paul M. Gross Hall opened to serve as the home for the Chemistry department. After additional space for the department was completed, the university remodeled the building in 2015 to reconfigure the building to serve as a maker space and the headquarters for Duke's Social Science Research Institute, part of the Economics Department. In 1972, as part of the merging of Duke's Women's College and Duke's Men's Trinity College, the campus became coeducational. Unlike at Harvard University, where the merger between its all-female Radcliffe College and all-male Harvard College took 22 years, the coeducational merger between Duke's undergraduate colleges were merged in a single year. Aerial view of West Campus, In 1982, The Bryan Center opened with the Duke University Store, Duke Barber Shop, Duke Post Office, Restaurants, Student Government and Administrative Offices. In 1994, Duke opened the Levine Science Research Center, to house the department of Computer Science. As of 2018, this research complex is the largest single-site interdisciplinary research facility in the United States. By 2004, due to the University's expansion, the need for more housing on West Campus arose and the University opened the first house of what would become Keohane Quadrangle. The last house of the quadrangle was opened in 2012, with more meeting spaces and suite-style living arrangements. 2004 also marked a substantial expansion for the Pratt School of Engineering's buildings on West Campus, with the opening of The Fitzpatrick Center for Interdisciplinary Engineering. In 2007, Bill and Melinda Gates (an alum of Duke) opened the French Family Science Center, a facility consisting of biological and genetic laboratories. In 2015, renovations began on most of the housing on West Campus, with the Wannamaker Quadrangle becoming the first retrofitted house. In 2018, the university completed renovations of the Crowell Quadrangle, and is now renovating the Craven Quadrangle. In 2018, as part of a university-wide construction initiative to replace aging dorms on both East Campus and West Campus, construction began on a new quadrangle.  Undergraduate Housing  West Campus is organized into housing quadrangles (referred to as \\"quads\\"), which have corresponding houses and provide housing for selective living groups and greek organizations. The campus serves as student housing from sophomore year through senior year, as Duke has both a residency requirement as well as guarantees housing for all undergraduate students. The Duke House Model is similar to house models at other universities such as Harvard and Yale. = Quadrangles = There are 8 undergraduate quadrangles on West Campus. The naming convention follows past presidents of Duke University. * Craven Quadrangle (named after Duke University President Braxton Craven) * Keohane Quadrangle (named after Duke University President Nannerl O. Keohane) * Crowell Quadrangle (named after Duke University President John Franklin Crowell) * Edens Quadrangle (named after Duke University President Arthur Hollis Edens) * Kilgo Quadrangle (named after Duke University President John Carlisle Kilgo) * Few Quadrangle (named after Duke University President William Preston Few) * Wannamaker Quadrangle * The Hollows Quadrangle = Selective Living Groups = Duke consists of several undergraduate \\"Selective Living Groups,\\" which operate as an alternative to the Duke House Model and Greek Life. Each selective group has a specific theme, and is open to students who meet certain criteria. = Greek Organization Living Sections = Duke provides housing accommodations to Greek Organizations (both Fraternities and Sororities) which meet university criteria, known commonly as \\"House Sections.\\" The Greek Organizations are not clustered on one quad, for example Duke's Sigma Alpha Epsilon (ΣΑΕ) has its section in Craven House Y whereas Duke's Sigma Nu (ΣΝ) fraternity has its section in university annex housing. No Greek Organizations have housing on Duke's East Campus.  Transportation  The overall shape of Duke University in Durham is bar-bell shaped, with two ends of West Campus and East Campus.

Kadhim received his formal art education at Baghdad's Academy of Fine Arts in the 1950s. Actively involved in the Iraqi arts community, he became a founding member of the art group known as Al-Mujadidin (The Innovationists) formed by Salim al-Dabbagh, and whose members included Salim al-Dabbagh, Salman Abbas, Amer al-Obaidi, Saleh al-Jumai'e, Faik Husein and Talib Makki.Sharifian, S., Mohammadzade, M., Naef, S. and Mehraeen, M., \\"Cultural Continuity in Modern Iraqi Painting between 1950 and 1980,\\" Bagh-e-Nazar, [The Scientific Journal of NAZAR Research Center (Nrc) for Art, Architecture & Urbanism], vol. 14, no.47, 2017, pp 43–52 (published in English and Persian); Dabrowska, K. and Hann, G., Iraq Then and Now: A Guide to the Country and Its People, Bradt Travel Guides, 2008, p. 269 The group held its first exhibition at the National Gallery of Modern Art where members all exhibited works.Salīm, N., Iraq: Contemporary Art, Vol. 1, Sartec, 1977, p. 173; Inati, S.C.

It is situated in the Mount Baker Wilderness, which is managed by the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest. The summit offers views of Mount Shuksan, Mount Baker, and the Picket Range. Mount Sefrit's name honors Frank Ira Sefrit (1867–1950), editor and publisher of The Bellingham Herald for nearly 40 years. This mountain's name was officially adopted in 1952 by the U.S. Board on Geographic Names. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into the deep valleys of Ruth Creek and the Nooksack River which nearly encircle Mount Sefrit, except for Nooksack Ridge which connects it to Ruth Mountain. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. East aspect from Ruth Creek Valley The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The \\"U\\"-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area. Climate Mount Sefrit is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall.Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer. The months July through September offer the most favorable weather for viewing or climbing this peak. Gallery File:Mt. Sefrit.jpgMt.

Originating in the Middle Ages, it developed from a pilgrimage to the grave of Saint Servatius into the present-day religious, historical, cultural and commercial enterprise. Highlights in the programme are the displaying or unveiling of the relics in the main churches and secondly, the processions with the town's main relics. The next pilgrimage will take place in 2025.  History  = Maastricht as a pilgrimage town = Basilica of St Servatius. The Frankish sarcophagus was added later Our Lady's. In the centre the Byzantine double cross Maastricht had been an important destination for pilgrims centuries before the first recorded septennial pilgrimage. The first to mention pilgrims paying tribute at the grave of Saint Servatius was Gregory of Tours in the late 6th century. It was at that time that bishop Monulph replaced the wooden grave chapel with a stone basilica.Gregory of Tours (587): Liber in gloria confessorum (\\"The Glory of the Confessors\\"), chapter 71 (online text in Latin). Calendars of saints from the 8th and 9th century make mention of miracles happening at the saint's grave.Koldeweij (1990), pp. 97-98. As the number of pilgrims increased, the original church became too small. It was replaced by ever larger structures, until the current church was built in the 11th century. Throughout the centuries the Church of Saint Servatius acquired many relics, which were housed in precious reliquaries. The indulgences connected to these relics brought in more pilgrims. A French pilgrim calculated in 1453 that in one year in Maastricht one could earn about 800 years reduction of purgatorial punishment. At the same time, it was assumed that a completed Maastricht pilgrimage was rewarded with a plenarary indulgence (full remittance of punishment).Koldeweij (1990), pp. 91-92. The other collegiate church in Maastricht, the Church of Our Lady, possessed important relics too. After the First Crusade (1096-99), two major relics of the True Cross were acquired from Constantinople. One was the so-called Pectoral Cross of Constantine, which was set in a small golden triptych. The other was the Byzantine double cross or Patriarchal cross, presented to the church by Philip of Swabia. Both reliquaries were donated to the pope by a former canon in 1837. They are now in the Treasury of St. Peter's Basilica in Vatican City. Another reason for pilgrims to visit Our Lady's was the relic of the girdle of the Virgin Mary, which remains in the church today.The nowadays much venerated 15th-century statue of Our Lady, Star of the Sea only arrived in this church in 1837, and thus prior to that date had no role in attracting pilgrims to Our Lady's. Koldeweij (1990), p. 98. There was great rivalry between the two principal churches when it came to attracting pilgrims. More pilgrims meant more income. The Chapter of St Servatius, considering itself the oldest and more powerful institution, made sure that no relics were shown in the open air at Our Lady's. It has been suggested that the ambulatory gallery in the choir of Our Lady's was used for this purpose. Whichever way they showed their relics, it was almost certainly less effective than the spectacular open-air displays at St Servatius'. Over the centuries several disputes arose from this, some were fought at the highest level at the Papal Tribunal., 'Geschiedenis van de Maastrichtse Heiligdomsvaart'. In: Van Rensch/Koldeweij/De la Haye/De Kreek (1990), pp. 116-117. The differences culminated in 1495, when the Chapter of Saint Servatius commissioned a copy of the Patriarchal Cross of Our Lady's. For the benefit of the pilgrims two hospitiums were built on the south-west corner of Vrijthof. The Hospitium of Saint Servatius is first mentioned in the 11th century. Next to it stood the Hospitium of Saint James, which was specifically built for pilgrims on their way to Santiago de Compostella. Due to dwindling numbers of pilgrims, both institutions took on other tasks in the 17th century. They were demolished in the early 19th century.Koldeweij (1990), pp. 98-99. = Middle Ages: Apogee of the Maastricht pilgrimage = Relics form of the 1468 pilgrimages of Maastricht, Aachen and Kornelimünster Abbey The Dutch word heiligdomsvaart (German: Heiligtumsfahrt) means \\"journey to the holy relics\\". It is probably derived from the older German terms Römerfahrt and Aachener Fahrt, the medieval journeys or pilgrimages to Rome and Aachen. The Maastricht heiligdomsvaart was long held simultaneously with Aachen and Kornelimünster Abbey. Together they offered some of the best relics to be seen in Europe. A papal bull of 1249 is the oldest document referring to the Maastricht pilgrimage around the traditional dates in mid-July, although the name heyldomsvaert is not mentioned until 1440. The term used in 1391 was heiligdomskermis (\\"fair of the holy relics\\"). The popularity of the Maastricht-Aachen-Kornelimünster pilgrimage reached its zenith in the 15th century when up to 140,000 pilgrims visited these towns in mid-July.De la Haye (1990), pp. 107-113. The septennial pilgrimage in medieval Maastricht was centred around the Church of Saint Servatius, although Our Lady's and other churches undoubtedly benefitted with their indoors activities. The traditional date was one week before and one week after 16 July, the feast of the holy bishops Monulph and Gondulph.In Aachen the pilgrimage centred around 17 July, the dedication of Aachen Cathedral. It remains unclear whether this was a coincidence or planned. It was certainly hugely beneficial to both. Later Kornelimünster joined in. It is not known when this date became the focal point of the Maastricht pilgrimage but in 1289 auxiliary bishop Bonaventura of Liège offered an indulgence to pilgrims visiting the grave of Saint Servatius around this time of the year. The year in which a septennial pilgrimage took place was a Jubilee, which meant that extra indulgences were granted. The majority of pilgrims aimed to earn indulgences by visiting the grave of Saint Servatius, drinking holy water from the cup of Saint Servatius and attending at least one of the daily relics displays. No indulgences could be obtained without going to confession and doing penance. After fulfilling the requirements pilgrims received a pre-printed confessional certificate. A chaplain would fill in the name of the pilgrim and attach the seal of the church.De la Haye (1990), pp. 113-115. In Maastricht the Collegiate Church of Saint Servatius had the sole right of showing relics in the open air. During the septennial pilgrimage this took place once a day at Vrijthof Square. In the 15th-century so many pilgrims gathered there, that the walls around the square had to be taken down.: 'Het graf blijft warm' on website NRC Handelsblad, 12 September 2003. After celebrating an open-air mass, a selection of the church's relics were shown from the dwarf gallery, the arcaded gallery just below the apse's roof. The dwarf gallery was decorated for the occasion with cloths printed with angels and Saint Servatius' keys. The pilgrim's staff and one of the 'heavenly cloths' being shown from the dwarf gallery (Blokboek van Sint-Servaas, ca. 1460) Vrijthof Square (Valentijn Klotz?, 1671) The showing of the relics must have been a theatrical event during which many pilgrims were overcome with emotion. Throughout the ceremony loud cries could be heard.Van Os (2000), p. 84. Some pilgrims were sitting on rooftops around Vrijthof to get a better view of the relics and to benefit from their exposure.: 'Maastricht in de ban van de Sint Servaas' in NRC Handelsblad, 24 August 1990. Many took bread, meat and personal objects with them in order to be blessed by the relics. The relics were shown in four groups. Each group was announced with a formula that started with: \\"Thou shall be shown...\\", followed by a brief description of the objects and a prayer. The fixed order was: 1. the sudarium of Saint Servatius (one of the three \\"heavenly cloths\\", lost during the Siege of Maastricht of 1579) along with his crozier; 2. the red shroud of Saint Servatius along with his pilgrim's staff; 3. the white cloth that covered the sarcophagus of Saint Servatius, along with his chalice and paten; 4. the reliquary bust of Saint Servatius, the reliquary arm of Saint Thomas and the silver pectoral cross made by Saint Luke for the Virgin Mary.Kroos (1985), pp. 353-355. The pilgrims were then invited to visit the grave inside the church and see the other relics on display there.Many did visit the tomb of Saint Servatius, some lying on top of it and confessing their sins, as described by a pilgrim from Geraardsbergen in 1433. Koldeweij (1990), p. 94. The ceremony was concluded by bell ringing and pilgrims blowing their pilgrim horns.De la Haye (1990), pp. 116, 121. Pilgrim badges of Saint Servatius Throughout the Middle Ages tens of thousands visited Maastricht during the septennial pilgrimage.There are no exact visitor numbers available. In Aachen 142.000 pilgrims visited in 1496. It is assumed that most of them visited Maastricht as well. De la Haye (1990), p. 113. Monasteries, hospitals, alms houses and individual citizens offered shelter, as only a limited number could be admitted to the town's official pilgrims' hospitiums.Koldeweij (1990), p. 99. Pilgrims came from all over Europe, notably from the Low Countries, France (Normandy and Brittany in particular, where Saint Servatius was venerated much), England, the Holy Roman Empire (Germany, Austria and Bohemia), Hungary and Scandinavia. After visiting Maastricht many carried on to Aachen and Kornelimünster, or to other pilgrimage sites.Maastricht pilgrim badges have been found in most of the afore-mentioned countries. Five badges from Maastricht as well as French and Italian sites, stuck together as a result of oxidation, were found in a grave at Selje Abbey in Norway. It may be assumed that all five were collected during a single pilgrimage. Koldeweij (1990), pp. 90-91, 100-101. The pilgrims were vital for the town's medieval economy. During the septennial pilgrimage the usually strict rules for trading were relaxed. Every citizen could sell food and drink or change currency.Ubachs/Evers (2005), p. 566: 'Vrijheid van Sint Servaas'. Pilgrims were offered a range of religious souvenirs: pilgrim horns made of clay, pilgrim flasks made of white pipe clay and, most of all, pilgrim badges made of tin or lead. In the 16th and 17th century these were gradually replaced by printed images, pilgrim's forms, booklets, medals and flags. The objects were often decorated with images of relics from Maastricht, Aachen and Kornelimünster, which made it easy to sell them in all three places.Koldeweij (1990), pp. 102-104. The fourteen days of the Maastricht pilgrimage were known as the \\"Freedom of Saint Servatius\\". It was a period when normal rules did not apply, resulting in more freedom for citizens and visitors but also in more crime. The start of this period was announced by the town watchmen blowing their buisines. From that moment on no-one could be tried for past offences. There was always a number of pilgrims who had been sent on a pilgrimage as part of a penalty.Koldweij (1990), p. 89. Breaking the rules during this time was punished with forced pilgrimages (e.g. to Santiago de Compostella) or fines. Magistrates and guilds formed militia that patrolled the streets, especially in areas where many pilgrims gathered. The large concentration of people in the relatively small city of around 15,000 also posed threats of fire and disease. Citizens were obliged to have a bucket of water on their doorstep to help prevent major conflagrations.Ubachs/Evers (2005), p. 219: 'Heiligdosmvaart'. = 16th-17th century: Decline of the Maastricht pilgrimage = Pilgrim's booklet and confessional certificates, 16th-17th century The decline of the Maastricht pilgrimage in the 16th century was a result of the Protestant Reformation, as well as the ensuing wars of religion and outbreaks of the plague. This affected Maastricht as much as many other places in north- western Europe. The 1489 and 1552 pilgrimages were cancelled due to threat of war.Kroos (1985), p. 357.De la Haye (1990), p. 113. During the Siege of Maastricht (1579) the three \\"heavenly cloths\\" went missing, whereas the reliquary bust of Saint Servatius was largely destroyed. Maastricht became a heavily defended Catholic bulwark. By 1608 attendance to the pilgrimage had dropped to 13,000. After the Capture of Maastricht by the Protestant Dutch Republic in 1632, a ban on processions and other religious manifestations in public was issued, meaning the end of the traditional Heiligdomsvaart.Processions inside the church or on church grounds were permitted. The 1629 Heiligdomsvaart had been the last pilgrimage with open-air displaying of the relics. Ubachs/Evers (2005), pp. 423-424: 'processie'. The pilgrimages of 1655 and 1662 took place inside the Church of Saint Servatius. After 1706 no septennial pilgrimages took place until the revival of the tradition in the 19th century. During the French Annexation (1794-1814) the religious chapters in Maastricht were abolished. For some years both collegiate churches were used as military arsenals and horse stables. The church treasures suffered great losses in this period. Many objects of gold and silver were melted down in order to pay for war taxes. After the French period neglect continued. Some of the medieval reliquaries were sold to collectors or just given away. The church of Saint Servatius lost the four panels that belonged to the chest of Saint Servatius, as well as its Vera Icon by Van Eyck. Our Lady's lost its Byzantine Cross and various other objects (see above). Few regretted these losses at the time. With the disappearance of the pilgrimages and the religious institutions that had guarded these objects for centuries, they had become meaningless to most. = 1874: Revival of the septennial pilgrimage = Bock & Willemsen's Die mittelalterlichen Kunst- und Reliquienschätze zu Maestricht (1872) Treasury (detail of a print, 1873) Caricature mocking the \\"cortège of relics\\" (Uilenspiegel, 16 August 1873) From the mid-19th century Catholicism began to flourish once again in Maastricht and elsewhere in the Netherlands. Catholics' self-esteem was boosted by the reestablishment of the episcopal hierarchy in the Netherlands in 1853. Catholics now wanted to express their faith in public. In 1867 Joannes Paredis, bishop of Roermond, reinstated the feast of the holy bishops of Maastricht. Four years later he introduced the feast in honour of the relics of all saints. (1983): 'Het omstreden herstel van de heiligdomsvaart in 1874'. In: De Sint Servaas, pp. 77-78. Many relics that had lost their containers during the French period were given new reliquaries, predominantly in the Gothic Revival style. At the same time, a renewed interest in medieval art became apparent. An important step in the reassessment of Maastricht's religious patrimony was the publication of Bock and Willemsen's illustrated catalogue of the church treasures in 1872. The French edition of 1873 moreover contained additional texts about the medieval pilgrimages, which may have contributed to the revival of the tradition one year later. Also in 1873, the Treasury of the Basilica of St Servatius, after extensive restoration works led by Dutch architect Pierre Cuypers, opened to the public. Part of the opening ceremony was a short procession with several reliquaries that went from the old treasury via Vrijthof to the new treasury. The procession with three bishops and over 50 priests was illegal as it clearly ignored the ban on processions that was included in the 1848 Dutch Constitution.Kroos (1985), pp. 396-397. Catholics in the Netherlands were impressed; others made fun of the \\"Maastricht cortège of relics\\". The success of the 1873 procession stimulated F.X. Rutten, dean of St Servatius', to reinstate the septennial pilgrimage in 1874. Papal permission was obtained from Pope Pius IX, who also revived the medieval plenarary indulgence for those who completed the pilgrimage. The medieval custom of showing the relics from the dwarf gallery was not revived; instead the relics were exhibited in the church and during a procession. The relics remained on view for two weeks on a pedestal in the choir of St Servatius'. The route of the procession was the same as the previous year: leaving the church from the south-east portal, via Vrijthof and Keizer Karelplein to the north portal and the treasury in the cloisters. This time judicial action was taken against dean Rutten. The case went on for years; the dean persisted despite losing every single case. (2000): Teedere quaesties: religieuze rituelen in conflict. Confrontaties tussen katholieken en protestanten rond de processiecultuur in 19e-eeuws Nederland, pp. 311-317. Uitgeverij Verloren, Hilversum. (online tekst op pure.knaw.nl). This and similar cases led to heated discussions in Dutch Parliament. It did not stop the Catholics taking to the streets: in 1878 six processions were held in Maastricht and in 1881 the second 'modern' pilgrimage went ahead. = 20th century: Towards a modern pilgrimage = In the course of the 20th century Catholics were no longer regarded as a threat in the Netherlands, partly due to the fact that they had evolved from being a religious minority to a majority. Whereas processions and pilgrimages were previously regarded by non- Catholics as \\"catholic superstition\\" and \\"folklore\\", there was now a certain curiosity in this sensual approach to faith. Some Catholics regarded this new 'acceptance' with scepticism.Kroos (1985), p. 405. Announcement in the Limburger Koerier, 1930 During the 1909 pilgrimage displaying of relics took place in the two main churches, as well as in the parish church of Wyck, where the so-called Black Christ of Wyck could be venerated. Masses were celebrated by the archbishop of Utrecht and the bishop of Liège, indicating the high profile the pilgrimage by then had achieved within the Roman Catholic Church.Kroos (1985), p. 404, note 227. In 1916 the Saint Servatius Play, a musical piece that intended to visualise the ancient legend, was performed in the open-air in Vrijthof. The play or variations on it were performed until recently.The play The Golden House performed in 1983 led to criticism by the German art historian Renate Kroos, author of an important publication on the Shrine of Saint Servatius: \\"Höchst bedenklich dagegen scheint mir, daß bei diesem Aufzug (mit ca. 1200 Mitwirkenden und Kostümen von den Salzburger Festspielen) Reliquien 'mitspielen' mußten: der Thomas-Arm, die Staurothek von 1490, die Servatiusbüste und der Servatiusschrein. Einmal verbietet konservatorische Vorsicht, die gefährdeten Goldschmiedewerke von Schauspielern traktieren zu lassen.\\" Kroos (1985), p. 406. Kroos' criticism did not have much effect; in the play Echo of a Pilgrim from 1990 relics were again being carried around. (1990): 'Heiligdomsvaart 1990: een terugblik'. In: De Sint Servaas, pp. 422-425. Another pre-19th-century element of the pilgrimage that was revived in the 20th century was the playful spectacle The Storming of the Castle, which took place on the river Meuse in 1930, 1937 and 1983. (1983): 'Maastricht gaat weer burcht op Maas bestormen'. In: De Sint Servaas, pp. 78-79.Ubachs/Evers (2005), pp. 103-104: 'burcht bestormen'. Since 1937 the task of organising the septennial pilgrimage lies with the Vereniging Het Graf van Sint Servaas (Society of the Grave of Saint Servatius). The society aims to promote the city of Maastricht as a catholic centre and a pilgrimage site. Also in 1937, an old tradition was reintroduced to allow the statues of Our Lady, Star of the Sea and the Black Christ of Wyck in the procession. Several other non-reliquary objects (mainly statues of saints) have been admitted since.Kroos (1985), pp. 405-406. The 1944 pilgrimage was cancelled because of World War II. It was postponed until 1948, thus breaking the seven-yearly cycle as well as no longer being synchronized with Aachen.Kroos (1985), p. 397, note 160. It also meant that participants from Aachen were able to join the Maastricht procession. In 1955 the Bust of Charlemagne came over from Aachen, accompanied by many German pilgrims (among them cardinal Josef Frings). In 1969 the reliquary chest of Saint Remaclus was brought in from Stavelot and that of Saint Gummarus from Lier; in 1976 Saint Lambert's bust visited from Liège, Saint Ursula's shrine from Cologne and other reliquaries from Oldenzaal, Visé, Aachen and Burtscheid.Kroos (1985), p. 406. Starting in 1969 the traditional dates around mid-July were abandoned because too many people were away on holiday. Initially the dates were changed to late August, early September; later to late May, early June. (1989): 'Kom, wij gaan naar het huis van de Heer'. In: De Sint Servaas, p. 350. In 1988 a partnership with other pilgrimage sites within the Euregion Meuse-Rhine was initiated. Unlike the medieval partnership with Aachen and Kornelimünster, the pilgrimages are scheduled in such a way that there is no competition between the towns. 1990 saw a dip in numbers of visitors, possibly a result of tensions in the Diocese of Roermond under bishop Joannes Gijsen.: 'De betekenis van de Katholieke Kerk', in: Vijftig jaar jaarboeken Maastricht, p. 149 (online tekst on website zichtopmaastricht.nl). In 1997 the theme was Where are you? with around 100,000 visitors. In 2004 the theme was We are the time. It was the first time an extensive cultural programme was added to the pilgrimage.'Heiligdomsvaart' on website kro.nl. The 2011 theme was Towards the Light. Around 175.000 attended some of the events.'Maastricht, H. Servaas (Servatius)' on website meertens.knaw.nl The 55th (modern) edition took place from 24 May until 3 June 2018. Its theme was Do good and do not look back. The next Maastricht pilgrimage takes place in 2025.

The centre of most activities is the Basilica of St Servatius. The entrance to the church and treasury is free of charge at this time (normally there is a fee). During the pilgrimage the church can be accessed via three portals, two of which are generally not in use. The small crypt, providing access to the grave of Saint Servatius, is also open at certain hours. The reliquary chest of Saint Servatius, locally known as the Noodkist ('Chest of Distress'), is permanently exhibited on the choir stairs. A secondary focal point during the pilgrimage is the Basilica of Our Lady. To a lesser degree involved are the other churches in central Maastricht, as well as a number of (Catholic) schools, senior citizens homes and cultural institutions. The administrational centre of the pilgrimage doubles as an information point for both pilgrims and tourists.'Programme Heiligdomsvaart 2018' on website heiligdomsvaartmaastricht.nl. = Masses and other services = The opening ceremony begins with a short service in the open air at the Spring of Saint Servatius in the Jeker valley, a few miles south of Maastricht. The service includes drinking water from the spring that, according to legend, sprung where Saint Servatius tapped his crozier on the ground. The opening ceremony continues at the Basilica of St Servatius, where the bust of Saint Servatius is carried around the church in procession, after which it makes its grand entry via the South Portal (Bergportaal), normally reserved for royal visitors. This is followed by a Pontifical High Mass, celebrated by the bishop of Roermond, the dean of Maastricht and other priests. During this mass the Noodkist is brought into the church and placed on a platform on the choir steps, where it remains for the entire period.Fotoboek (2011), pp. 24-39, and 'Impressies HDV 2018: Processie en Openingsmis 24.05.2018' on website heiligdomsvaartmaastricht.nl. During the next 11 days, high masses are celebrated every day, often aimed at certain groups. In 2018 masses and services were held for members of the Taizé Community, the Community of Sant'Egidio, the Community of the Crucified and Risen Love, the Society of St Gregory, the Order of the Holy Sepulchre and the monks of St. Benedictusberg Abbey. Other groups that received a special welcome in the church included pilgrims to the shrine of Saint Gerlach in Houthem, pilgrims from Sint Oedenrode and Hasselt, members of the Armenian, Philippine and Antillian communities in Maastricht, as well as children of primary schools in Maastricht. Furthermore, prayer services, Liturgies of the Hours, lectures and other spiritual activities are organised, some of which take place in the crypt, the Keizerzaal, or other unusual locations. Throughout the 11-day pilgrimage there are priests available for confession or personal counsel.

The procession, which had been his main goal, he considered disappointing. : 'Relieken en de Heiligdomsvaart in Maastricht; Een hot line met gene zijde'. In: NRC Handelsblad, 20 June 1997. The modern way of showing the relics is not from the dwarf gallery but inside the churches, first in the Basilica of Our Lady, followed by the Basilica of St Servatius.Before 1990 the Basilica of St Servatius had no ceremony for displaying the relics; they were just on show in the church after the processions. In 1990 the relics display took place in both churches simultaneously. From 1997 on they take place at different times, so people can attend both events. Cf. the programmes of 'Heiligdomsvaart 1983' and 'Heiligdomsvaart 1990'. In: De Sint Servaas, p. 84 & pp. 408-409. Compared to the medieval practice, more relics (also, different ones) are shown nowadays.De la Haye (1990), p. 119.  Relics display in the Basilica of Our Lady  Our Lady's, waiting for the relics display, 2018 The relics display in the Basilica of Our Lady starts with a liturgical entrance procession in which the main relics from the treasury are brought into the church. While groups of carriers walk up the central aisle toward the choir stairs, the Litany of the Saints is sung. The carriers position themselves in a semicircle in the chancel area in front of the ambulatory. The service starts with a reading from the Gospel, after which the priest announces the relics with the medieval formula \\"Thou shall be shown...\\" The relics are shown in five groups. Each time a group has been announced the carriers step forward near the edge of the choir steps, then lifting up the reliquaries for a few seconds, so they can be seen by all. At no point are the relics taken out of their containers. A prayer is said and the carriers return to their position in the semicircle, after which the next group of relics is announced. In 2018 the order of showing was: # relics of Christian martyrs: the reliquary of the apostle Peter, the reliquary bust of the apostle Bartholomew, a Scandinavian reliquary horn with relics of the apostles Thomas, Andrew and Judas Thaddeus, and the reliquary arm of Saint Tranquillus (a saint associated with the Theban Legion); # relics of the holy bishops of Maastricht: the reliquary busts of Servatius, Monulph, Gondulph and Hubert; # relics of holy women: the reliquary of the girdle of Saint Mary, Mary's wedding ring, relics of Mary Magdalene, Catherine of Siena and Bernadette Soubirous; # relics of holy men: a reliquary with oil from the grave of Saint Nicholas, a relic of Saint Roch and a relic of Saint Giles; # relics of Jesus: a staurothèque (cross reliquary) with relics of the True Cross (a papal present in gratitude of the donation of the Byzantine double cross). After the blessing, given with the cross reliquary, a procession is formed once more, taking the relics to the north transept where they are exhibited for about an hour. Members of the congregation can then approach the relics, touch them, take photographs and venerate them.'Reliekentoning Heiligdomsvaart 2018 Basiliek van Sterre der Zee', booklet handed out at the relics display in the Basilica of Our Lady, 2 June 2018.

The formula \\"Thou shall be shown...\\" is sung here by a cantor. Each time a group of relics is shown, a short fanfare sounds from the west choir of the church, adding to the dramatic effect.: 'Relieken en de Heiligdomsvaart in Maastricht; Een hot line met gene zijde'. In: NRC Handelsblad, 20 juni 1997. Also, after having been shown, the relics do not return to the chancel area, but are immediately taken down the choir steps into the side chapels. Here they remain, guarded by members of confraternities. This means that, unlike at Our Lady's, the chancel is virtually empty at the end of the service. It is remarkable that the arm reliquary of Saint Thomas and most of the Servatiana (see below: 'List of devotional objects/Servatiana'), which were so pivotal in the medieval relics display, are no longer shown. The current order of showing is: # relics of Jesus: the patriarchal cross of 1490 with relics of the True Cross; # relics of holy men:In 1955 this group of relics was subdivided into: apostles, martyrs and confessors. See: , 'Geschiedenis van de Maastrichtse Heiligdomsvaart'. In: Van Rensch/Koldeweij/De la Haye/De Kreek (1990), p. 119. reliquaries of Marcellinus and Peter, Saint Blaise, Saint Livinus, Saint Amor and Saint Gerlach; # relics of holy women: reliquaries of Saint Agnes, Saint Barbara, Saint Cecilia, Saint Amelberga and the blessed Clara Fey; # relics of holy bishops of Maastricht: the reliquary busts of Monulph, Gondulph and Lambert, and the reliquary horn of Hubert; # relics of Saint Servatius: the key of Saint Servatius, his pectoral cross, the reliquary bust and the reliquary chest (which remains immobile). After the conclusion of the ceremony the relics are exhibited in the side aisles and chapels, in order to be admired and venerated. Members of various confraternities and guilds keep watch over them.'Heiligdomsvaart 1990'. In: De Sint Servaas, pp. 408-409.

The colourful parades on both Sundays are watched by ten thousands of people, as well as being televised. Additionally, there are a number of smaller processions, such as the opening procession, the 'Star Procession' (departing from various parish churches), and the children's procession (with self-made reliquary shrines).'Processie en Openingsmis 24.05.2018', 'Sterprocessie 25.05.2018' and 'Mini Heiligdomsvaart 28.05.2018' on website heiligdomsvaartmaastricht.nl. Vrijthof during the first procession, 27 May 2018 The route of the main procession on the first Sunday starts in Wyck and passes over the Saint Servatius Bridge. A week later the starting point is in Jekerkwartier from where it goes to Onze Lieve Vrouweplein and along the Meuse. Both routes continue via Markt towards Vrijthof. Here, in the Basilica of St Servatius, a short service is held, ending with the singing of the Hymn of Saint Servatius.First mentioned in 1923 as being part of the pilgrimage. 'Kerknieuws. De zevenjaarlijksche Heiligdomsvaart te Maastricht' in De Tijd, 23 July 1923 (on website resolver.kb.nl). In Vrijthof, and sometimes in Markt or Sint Pieterstraat, the procession can be watched from a spectator stand. The first rows at the Vrijthof stand are usually reserved for guests such as bishops, cabinet ministers, the governor of Limburg, the mayor of Maastricht and other dignitaries. Television recordings usually take place at Vrijthof.'Flyer procession 27 May 2018', 'flyer procession 3 June 2018' and photos of previous processions on website heiligdomsvaartmaastricht.nl. Since the 1960s, the organizers of the processions have found it increasingly difficult to involve local participants, especially children and young adults. As a result, traditional groups of altar servers, choir boys, scouting groups and 'brides' (young women dressed in white) have largely disappeared. The same has happened to Catholic women's associations and workers' associations. Their place has now been taken by non-religious, historical and folkloristic groups, or in some cases by religious groups from elsewhere (e.g. the Singing Virgins of Tongeren).  Carrier groups  About half of the participants in the processions are members of confraternities, carriers guilds or other groups that are involved in carrying and escorting the holy objects assigned to them. The Confraternity of Saint Servatius for instance is responsible for the safety of the reliquary chest of Saint Servatius (or Noodkist), while the Saint Servatius Guild is concerned with the bust of Saint Servatius. Other groups take care of the bust of Saint Lambert, the busts of Saint Monulph and Saint Gondulph, the statue of Our Lady, Star of the Sea, or other statues. The larger objects are carried on a processional litter (comparable to a paso in Spanish processions but usually smaller), decorated with flowers. The carriers are dressed formally (in morning dress or white tie) or wear pseudo-liturgical tunics. In order to move the larger litters usually two teams of 12 or 16 carriers are needed. Other members carry processional lanterns or poles decorated with confraternity medals. Smaller objects are carried by single participants, previously often by priests or nuns, nowadays mostly by seminarists or other laymen. They usually wear white gloves and/or hold the objects with the wide sleeves of their gowns.

In the processions, the theme provides a guideline for those groups that attempt to present the Gospel to an increasingly non-religious audience. In 2018 the theme Do good and do not look back was presented by several local amateur theatre groups. Some participants reenacted themes from the Old and New Testament, others focussed on Catholic themes like Saint Servatius, Pope Francis and the Holy Sacraments. A group of students from the Roman Catholic seminaries of Rolduc and Liège carried reproductions of a painting by the Master of Alkmaar, illustrating the Seven Works of Mercy. As an answer to this, members of the Protestant Church in the Netherlands carried drawings by school children with the same theme in a contemporary context.

In 2018 there were local representatives of the Protestant Church in the Netherlands (see above), the Russian Orthodox Church, the Armenian Apostolic Church, the Philippine community (with an Ave Maria theme), the Antillian community (with a gospel group), the Order of the Holy Sepulchre, the Order of Saint Lazarus, the OSMTH Order of the Knights Templar, the Bund der St. Sebastianus Schützenjugend (with the Aachener Friedenskreuz or Aachen Peace Cross) and the Sisters of the Poor Child Jesus (with a banner commemorating the beatification of their founder, Clara Fey).

In the Heiligdomsvaart processions the Basilica Choir (the main choir of Our Lady's) accompanies the statue of the Star of the Sea, while the Cappella Sancti Servatii (the choir of St Servatius') walks in front of the bust of Saint Servatius. A position of honour is given to the marching band that walks behind the Noodkist, thus closing the procession. On the first Sunday in 2018 this was the Royal Harmonie Sainte Cécile of Eijsden; on the second Sunday it was the Harmonie Sint Petrus en Paulus from the Maastricht neighbourhood of Wolder.

Most of these activities are connected to the over-all theme. In 2018 there were plays and concerts in various churches: Saint John's, Saint Lambert's, Saint Theresia's, the Sacred Heart Church (Church of the Dome) as well as the cloisters of St Servatius'. Films were shown in the open air in front of the church of St. Peter-Beneden. Theme exhibitions took place in the cloisters of the basilicas, the east crypt of Our Lady, the Dominican Church, the Centre Céramique cultural centre, the Vrijthof Theatre and the Bonnefantenmuseum. The exhibition Copes in the Bonnefantenmuseum showed historical copes, as well as contemporary designs by local designers of Fashionclash.'Brochure Cultuurprogramma' on website heiligdomsvaartmaastricht.nl.

Some objects are very old and are part of the local or national patrimony. Not every relic, reliquary or statue of a saint is shown during the Heiligdomsvaart pilgrimage. There are hundreds of objects in the treasuries of the main churches, which requires selection. For conservational reasons some fragile objects that traditionally have been part of the pilgrimage are no longer shown. = Servatiana = Since the earliest records the so-called 'Servatiana' have played a pivotal role in the Maastricht pilgrimage. These are objects believed to be the personal belongings of Saint Servatius. In the septennial pilgrimage they were shown from the dwarf gallery. Some of the Servatiana were lost over time. Remaining in the treasury are: the key of Saint Servatius, the pectoral cross of Saint Servatius, his seal, his cup, his pilgrim's staff, his crozier, his chalice, his paten and his portable altar. Due to their size and frailty their role has diminished in recent years. An additional reason for this could be that art historians have argued that, with the exception of the cup of Saint Servatius, none of these objects are old enough to have been the personal belongings of someone who lived in the 4th century.Koldeweij (1985), pp. 55-56, 283-286. These days only the key and the pectoral cross are shown during the relics display in the church; none of the Servatiana are included in the processions.'Photos of the relics display in St Servatius', 02.07.2011' on website heiligdomsvaartmaastricht.nl. A copy of the pilgrim's staff is on permanent display in the small crypt which gives access to the grave of Saint Servatius.

They are: the statue of Our Lady, Star of the Sea, the Black Christ of Wyck, the bust of Saint Servatius and the bust of Saint Lambert. During the Maastricht pilgrimage they take part in processions and various other religious activities.  Star of the Sea  The statue of Our Lady, Star of the Sea (usually referred to as: the Star of the Sea) is probably the best known and most popular of the Maastricht devotions. It is a 15th-century statue of Mary with the baby child Jesus in the style of the German schöne Madonnen. It has a long tradition of being included in processions, first with the Maastricht Minorites, after 1837 with the parish of Our Lady. Even now it participates in around ten processions each year. For the shorter processions a small processional litter is used that requires four carriers. For the longer processions, as in the septennial pilgrimage, a much larger steel structure is used. Twelve carriers are required to take this litter on their shoulders. The larger structure is covered in white damask and decorated with flowers. The carriers are members of the Carriers Guild of the Star of the Sea (Dutch: Dragersgilde Sterre der Zee). The guild members wear tunics, some dark-blue and red, others light-blue and white, decorated with guild medals. They all wear white gloves. At regular intervals one team of carriers replaces the other.'Dragersgilde Sterre der Zee' on website sterre-der-zee.nl. Members of the Confraternity of the Star of the Sea (Dutch: Broederschap Sterre der Zee) escort the processional litter, wearing white tie and a black cloak with a six-pointed star on it. Some carry processional lanterns or processional poles with fraternity plaques.'Broederschap Sterre der Zee' on website sterre-der- zee.nl. The statue of the Star of the Sea has no role in the relics display in the church, although this ceremony is traditionally concluded by the hymn O Star of the Sea.

For centuries it was kept in the monastery of the White Nuns (Dutch: Wittevrouwenklooster) in Vrijthof, where it attracted pilgrims mainly from Central Europe.Ubachs/Evers (2005), p. 600: 'Zwarte Christus'. After the dissolution of the monasteries the statue was given to the parish church of St Martin in Wyck. In 1813 the Confraternity of the Holy Cross (Dutch: Broederschap van het Heilig Kruis) was founded, which in 1963 had around 2,000 members.Ubachs/Evers (2005), p. 98: 'Broederschap van het H. Kruis'. Members of the confraternity carry the Black Christ in processions on a large processional litter similar to the one used for the Star of the Sea. Their tunics are red and black, matching their processional banner.

A previous bust dating back to around 1400 was shown from the dwarf gallery to pilgrims in Vrijthof square. It was largely destroyed during the Siege of 1579. The new bust was commissioned by the besieger, Alexander Farnese, Duke of Parma, whose coat of arms is on the pedestal. The silver-coated and partly gilded bust is a major artistic work in the Treasury of Saint Servatius. It contains a large fragment of the skull of the saint. The bust is also a cultural icon of the Maastricht pilgrimage. Images of the bust appear on flags, banners and printed material. The bust takes central stage at the opening ceremony of the pilgrimage (see: 'Programme/Masses and other services'). Until the 1970s, the brothers of the Beyart Monastery (Brothers of the Immaculate Conception of Mary, or Brothers of Maastricht) carried the bust in processions; since 1976 members of the Saint Servatius Guild have taken that task (literally) upon their shoulders.'Sint Servaasgilde' on website sintservaas.nl. Members of the guild wear two-part dark blue tunics, white gloves and a green ribbon around their neck with a guild medal. As is the case with the Star of the Sea statue, two processional litters are used, one for short or indoor processions, the other one for longer trips. A plastic slip-over is used to protect the bust in bad weather.

It was made by the Utrecht silversmiths Edelsmidse Brom for the parish church of St Lambert in 1938-40. This happened after an ambitious parish priest obtained a relic of Saint Lambert, Maastricht's last bishop and the only one who was born there. The relic was picked up in Liège and brought back in triumph by 2,000 parishioners in two extra trains in 1937.Ubachs/Evers (2005), p. 300: 'Lambertus, h'. The new bust was clearly modelled after the bust of Saint Servatius. It instantly gained popularity, to such a degree that it was included in the Maastricht Devotions. (1979): Kerken van Maastricht, p. 94. Vroom & Dreesmann, Maastricht Saint Lambert's church closed in 1985 due to constructional problems and the parish merged with that of Saint Anne. Since 2004 the bust is kept in the modern church of Saint Anne, where in 2018 it was given a separate chapel.'Rondleiding' on website annalambertus.nl. The bust of Saint Lambert is carried in processions on either one of two processional litters, depending on the occasion, much like the previously-mentioned objects. The small litter is dressed in green; the larger litter in white damask and decorated with flowers. Members of the Carriers Guild of Saint Lambert (Dutch: Dragersgilde St. Lambertus) wear green and yellow tunics; around their neck a chain with an embroidered medallion with an image of the bust and the five-pointed star of Maastricht.'Groeperingen' on website annalambertus.nl.

Showing the reliquaries remains a central feature of the Maastricht pilgrimage. Apart from the main reliquary of Saint Servatius (the Noodkist), these include a number of reliquary busts of apostles and bishops, as well as reliquaries and statues of other locally venerated saints. As mentioned before, many reliquaries are considered too fragile to leave their protected environment. This applies to most of the Servatiana, the alb of Saint Servatius, the cloak of Saint Lambert, several staurothèques (cross reliquaries), all the reliquary horns in the treasuries (except for the Viking horn in Our Lady's), all the ivory and enamelled caskets, as well as the silver reliquary arm of Saint Thomas.  Reliquary chest of Saint Servatius  The Noodkist, firmly positioned on the choir steps for the duration of the pilgrimage, guarded by members of the Confraternity of Saint Servatius The reliquary chest of Saint Servatius, often – incorrectly – referred to as the Shrine of Saint Servatius,The use of the word 'shrine' is an incorrect translation of the German and Dutch term Schrein' or 'schrijn', meaning simply 'box' or 'chest'. In German it has come to mean 'reliquary chest'., in Dutch usually referred to as the Noodkist ('Chest of Distress'), is a 12th-century chest that contains the bodily remains of bishop Servatius of Maastricht-Tongeren. The wooden chest with elaborate gilded copper reliefs, champlevé enamels and precious stones is the main treasure of the Basilica of St Servatius and arguably the most important medieval object in the Netherlands. Its significance as a major product of Mosan metalwork has been recognised internationally.The Noodkist was one of the few objects from Dutch collections that was included in the grand exhibition Rhine and Meuse. Art and Culture 800-1400, held in Brussels and Cologne in 1972. (1972): Rijn en Maas. Kunst en Cultuur 800-1400 (exhibition catalogue), pp. 245-246. Schnütgen Museum & Belgian Ministries of Dutch and French Culture, Cologne/Brussels. For centuries the Noodkist was the centre of veneration of Saint Servatius in Maastricht, receiving its nickname from the custom of taking it out in procession in times of distress (first mentioned in 1409).Ahsmann (2017), p. 163. Not much is known about its role in the medieval pilgrimage practices. For obvious reasons it could not be shown from the dwarf gallery. Normally it stood on a stone altar behind the high altar, covered by a capsa, a painted wooden box. During the pilgrimage the capsa was removed and pilgrims were given access to the chancel. They were even allowed to touch the chest.Kroos (1985), p. 355. After the revival of the pilgrimage in the 19th century, the chest has been part of most festivities. Nowadays, it is permanently exhibited on the choir stairs (which in fact are situated in the crossing). When the church is open to the public, the chest is permanently guarded by two or four members of the Confraternity of Saint Servatius. This association was founded in 1916 and currently has around 50 members. Inside the church they wear tunics, either yellow and red, or black and red. The fraternity members also escort the chest when it leaves the church in processions, which normally only happens once a year (Saint Servatius Day, 13 May). The brotherhood then wears morning dress with red and white rosettes and fraternity medals. The processional litter is custom-designed featuring a steel structure with flexible parts that can be adjusted on the shoulders of the carriers. There are normally two teams of sixteen fraternity brothers involved in carrying the chest. The lower part of the frame is covered with grey fabric. A perspex box in the shape of the Noodkist covers it, regardless of the weather.Website Confraternity of Saint Servatius.

The busts discussed here predominantly date from the 19th century, made of wood and then polychromed. They replace the silver or gilded busts that were lost in the French Period. There are a few remarkable 'doubles'. Both the Basilica of Our Lady and the Basilica of St Servatius own busts of Monulph and Gondulph, the 6th-century bishops of Maastricht often associated with one another. All four busts are shown during the relics display in the churches but only one set joins the outdoor processions (the set owned by St Servatius'). They are carried on relatively small litters by members of the Guild of Saint Monulph and Saint Gondulph, which also is a bell-ringers guild.'Klokkenluidersgilde' on website sintservaas.nl. Naturally, both churches own a bust of Saint Servatius. The one in Our Lady's is merely used for the relics display in the church. The same goes for Saint Batholomew's and Saint Hubert's busts, also in Our Lady's. St Servatius' Basilica has two busts of Saint Lambert (one silver bust is on loan from the Rijksmuseum and never leaves the treasury), which in fact makes three, together with the bust in St Anne's. St Servatius' also owns a bust of Saint Amandus, another bishop of Maastricht. Regular 'visiting' busts from other churches and other towns are the bust of Saint Anthony of Padua (from the Maastricht parish of Scharn), the bust of Saint Amelberga (from Susteren Abbey), the silver bust of Saint Gerlach (from the parish of Houthem-Sint Gerlach). Note: the gilded and silver-coated busts of Saint Servatius and Saint Lambert are discussed in detail above (see: 'Maastricht Devotions').

A distinguished piece – even though it is a 15th- century copy of a much older cross – is the Patriarchal Cross of the Basilica of St Servatius. It contains several large pieces of the True Cross. It is carried by a priest as a processional cross at the entrance procession during the ceremony of the relics display. It is however too fragile to participate in any other processions. That would perhaps also apply to the reliquary with the girdle of Saint Mary in Our Lady's Basilica, were it not that this relic is considered too vital to be excluded. The core of the reliquary is medieval (first mentioned in 1286) but the outer case was replaced in the 19th century. Both inside the church and in the outdoor processions it is carried and escorted by a group of women in light-blue dresses. Two women carry the processional litter; the others hold red roses. Since the Second World War, a number of important relics have 'visited' Maastricht (see: 'History/20th century'). In 2018 there were busts from Houthem and Susteren (mentioned above), a cross reliquary from Dordrecht, a reliquary of Saint Lidwina from Schiedam, and a reliquary of Saint Cassius and Florentius (martyrs of the Theban Legion) from Bonn.

Some Maastricht parishes are represented in the pilgrimage processions with their patron saint, each with their own carriers guild. A 15th-century statue of Saint Peter hails from the parish of Sint Pieter (in fact two parishes: one at the bottom of Sint-Pietersberg, the other one halfway up the hill). The parish of Saint Anthony of Padua in Scharn is represented both with a bust (mentioned above) and a 17th-century(?) statue of the saint. Nearby Amby participates with a statue of Saint Walpurga. A special guest in 2018 was the statue of Our Lady, Cause of Our Joy, from the Basilica of Our Lady in Tongeren.

The five ships in order of the dates they entered service were: * (1899) * (1899) * (1899) * (1901) * (1901) Background The White Star Line had originally been based on the Australian trade. Thomas Ismay had purchased the houseflag of the Pilkington and Wilson's White Star Line which had prospered during the Australian gold rushes of the 1850s. In the late 1890s the company decided to restart an Australian service, and ordered five new steamships for the new service, these were referred to as the \\"Jubilee class\\" as their commissioning coincided with the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria. The ships were built in two groups, with the first three ships of the class (Afric, Medic and Persic) entering service in 1899, and the last two (Runic and Suevic) entering service two years later. The five ships enabled White Star to run their planned monthly \\"Colonial service\\" to Australia. Features The Jubilee-class ships were built for a dual role of carrying both passengers and cargo, and were at the time, the largest ships ever made for the Australia service. The first three had a gross register tonnage of slightly below 12,000 tons, and a capacity for 320 passengers. The passenger service proved more popular than White Star had expected, and so the last two ships of the class incorporated some design changes, giving them a slightly higher tonnage of around 12,500 tons, and an enlarged capacity of 400 passengers. The most notable design changes were the extension of the poop deck and the moving of the bridge closer to the bow. All of the ships had three continuous decks, with the passenger accommodation located mostly aft of amidships. The passenger accommodation was built with the immigrant and settler trade in mind, and only a single class of accommodation was provided; this was described as third-class, but was of higher quality than most third- class accommodation for ships of the period, and ranged in scale from two or four berth cabins, to open berth dormitories as the cheapest option. Passenger facilities included a dining salon, a library and a smoking room: These facilities were considered luxurious, and were not at the time normally included in third-class accommodation. One of the advantages of having a single class of accommodation was that passengers could have a free run of every part of the ship except the bridge, instead of being confined to the part of the ship reserved for one particular class. As well as passenger accommodation, all of the Jubilee class also had a substantial 15,000 deadweight tons of cargo capacity, in seven cargo holds, most of which were refrigerated using a carbonic anhydride system: These were intended principally for the transport of Australian meat, with the capacity for 100,000 frozen carcasses of mutton in of refrigerated space. Each ship also had one cargo hold which was specially designed for the transport of up to 20,000 bales of wool. The cargo holds were served by twenty-five derricks. The ships all had a single funnel and four masts with schooner rigging; plans had apparently been drawn up in the design stage for the ships to be equipped with sails, but this idea was abandoned. They were powered by two quadruple- expansion steam engines through two propellers, with a service speed of around . Careers =Afric= SS Afric Afric was the first of the five ships to be launched, although not the first to sail to Australia, She was launched on 16 November 1898, making her maiden voyage on 8 February the following year from Liverpool to New York as a test run, after further work she entered service on the Australia service on 9 September. Afric and her sisters carried troops and horses during the Boer War (1900–1902), which often interfered with their schedule, it would not be until the war concluded in 1902 that White Star was able to put their planned regular monthly service into effect. After twelve years of uneventful peacetime service, Afric was requisitioned for use as a troopship by the Australian government in 1914 on the outbreak of World War I. She was sunk by a German U-boat on 2 February 1917 in the English Channel with the loss of 22 lives, making her the shortest lived member of the class. =Medic= SS Medic Medic was launched on 15 December 1898, and inaugurated the Australia service with her maiden voyage which started from Liverpool on 3 August 1899, on her return voyage she carried Australian troops and horses to the Boer War which had started in October. She initially remained in commercial service after the outbreak of World War I, but was requisitioned under the Liner Requisition Scheme from 1917 to 1919, after which she returned to commercial service on the Australian route, until December 1927. In 1928 Medic was sold to A/S Hektor (N.Bugge) of Norway who renamed her Hektoria and converted her into a whaling factory ship. In 1932 Hektoria returned to the British register after her ownership was transferred to Hektoria Ltd. Hektoria was requisitioned for use as an oil tanker on the outbreak of World War II, but sunk by a U-boat on 11 September 1942 whilst sailing in an Atlantic convoy. =Persic= SS Persic Persic was launched on 7 September 1899, and started her maiden voyage on 7 December carrying 500 troops for the Boer War. During the maiden voyage her rudder stock broke, and Persic had to remain at Cape Town until a replacement could be shipped out from Belfast and fitted. When the voyage resumed early the next year Persic carried home injured Australian troops. In October 1900 Persic rescued the crew of the ship Madura which had caught fire. Persic remained in commercial service until she was requisitioned under the Liner Requisition Scheme in 1917, and used as a troopship. On 12 September 1918 while carrying American soldiers Persic was torpedoed off the Isles of Scilly, but remained afloat and was able to reach port for repairs. She was released into commercial service and refitted in 1920, but was withdrawn from service in 1926 after her engines were found to be suffering from advanced wear, and were beyond economic repair. The following year she was sold for scrap, and in July 1927 she sailed for her last voyage to a shipbreakers in the Netherlands. =Runic= SS Runic Runic was launched on 25 October 1900, and entered service with her maiden voyage on 19 January 1901, on 25 November that year she towed the liner which had broken down to the port of Dakar. Runic was commissioned by the Australian government as a war transport in January 1915, and on 1 May that year she collided with and sunk the collier Horst Martini in fog whilst in the English Channel, but no lives were lost. Between 1917 and 1919 she served with her sisters under the Liner Requisition Scheme, before being returned to commercial service and refitted in 1921. Runic made her last voyage to Australia in December 1929. In July 1930 she was sold to the Sevilla Whaling Co of London who converted her into a whaling factory ship and renamed her New Sevilla, the following year she was sold to Christian Salvesen. On 20 September 1940 New Sevilla was sailing in a convoy from Liverpool to Antarctica when she was torpedoed off the coast of Ireland, she sank the next day with the loss of two lives. =Suevic= SS Suevic Suevic was launched on 8 December 1900, and made her maiden voyage on 23 March the following year. At , Suevic was fractionally the largest of the Class. Like her sisters, during her early career she carried British troops to the Boer War on the outbound journeys to Cape Town, and Australian troops on the inbound journeys. After an uneventful early career, on 17 March 1907, Suevic ran aground on rocks near Lizard Point, Cornwall due to a navigational error which led to her position being miscalculated. After the passengers, crew and cargo were taken off the ship, unsuccessful efforts were made to free the vessel by reversing her engines. As only the bow was stuck on the rocks, and the stern section was undamaged, an unusual salvage operation was decided on, which involved splitting the ship in two with explosive charges, and constructing a new bow which would then be joined to the freed stern. On 2 April Suevic was successfully divided with dynamite, and the freed stern section was made seaworthy and then towed to Southampton, with the original bow left on the rocks. A new bow section was constructed at Belfast, and was then towed to Southampton, where it was joined to the original stern. Suevic then returned to her normal service on 14 January 1908. She initially remained in commercial service following the outbreak of World War I in 1914, but was taken up as an Australian troopship in May 1915, and made one dedicated trooping journey to the Gallipoli Campaign. She was taken up by the British government under the Liner Requisition Scheme between 1917 and 1920, after which she was refitted and returned to commercial service on the Australian service with her remaining sisters. In 1928 she was sold to Yngvar Hvistendahl's Finnhval A/S of Norway, and like her sisters Medic and Runic was converted into a whale factory ship and renamed Skytteren. When Norway was invaded by Nazi Germany in 1940, Skytteren was left stranded at the Port of Gothenburg in neutral Sweden. On 1 April 1942 Skytteren and nine other Norwegian ships made an attempt to reach international waters, where they would be guided by the Allies to the UK, the operation was a disaster as the Germans were tipped off; six of the ships were scuttled or sunk by the Germans, and two returned to Sweden, only two of the ships made it, Skytteren was not one of them; she was scuttled by her crew to avoid being captured by the Germans off the Swedish coast, and her crew taken as prisoners of war.

Background and formation The German Order Police was a key instrument of the security apparatus of Nazi Germany. In the prewar period, Heinrich Himmler, the head of the SS, and Kurt Daluege, chief of the Order Police, cooperated in transforming the police force of the Weimar Republic into militarised formations ready to serve the regime's aims of conquest and racial annihilation. The police units participated in the annexation of Austria and the occupation of Czechoslovakia. Police troops were first formed into battalion-sized formations for the invasion of Poland, where they were deployed for security and policing purposes, also taking part in executions and mass deportations. Twenty-three Order Police battalions were slated to take part in the 1941 invasion of the Soviet Union, Operation Barbarossa. Two battalions were assigned to support the Einsatzgruppen, the mobile death squads of the SS, and the Organisation Todt, the military construction group. The goals of the police battalions were to secure the rear by eliminating the remnants of the enemy forces, guarding the prisoners of war, and protecting the lines of communications and captured industrial facilities. Their instructions also included, as Daluege stated, the \\"combat of criminal elements, above all political elements\\". Comprising about 550 men, the battalion was raised from recruits mobilised from the 1905–1915 year groups. They were led by career police professionals, steeped in the ideology of Nazism, driven by anti-semitism and anti-Bolshevism. Operational history During 1941, Police Battalion 306 was stationed in Lublin, occupied Poland, where its duties included shooting Soviet POWs who were identified as Red Army political officers (Commissars) and Jews. The battalion shot thousands of prisoners. For example, between September 21 and 28, the unit killed over 6,000 people in Stalag 359B. In October 1941, a junior officer, Lieutenant refused to carry out an order to shoot over 700 prisoners on legal and ethical grounds. He was discharged and eventually sentenced under the Nazi law of \\"undermining of military morale\\". The battalion departed Lublin on 18 February 1942.The Lion and the Star: Gentile-Jewish Relations in Three Hessian Towns, By Jonathan Friedman, page 263 In the summer of 1942, the battalion became part of the 15th Police Regiment formed in the occupied Soviet Union for Bandenbekämpfung (\\"bandit-fighting\\") duties. It participated in the 2–3 September 1942 massacre of Jews who lived in the ghetto in Kożangródek (now Kažan-Haradok, Belarus). The perpetrators included personnel of the battalion's 2nd Company, alongside the 2nd Company of Police Battalion 69. More than 900 Jews, including women and children, were murdered. There was only one survivor. Also on 2 September, personnel of the same units provided support to the SS and police forces liquidating the Łachwa Ghetto. Between 29 October and 1 November of 1942, the battalion participated in the liquidation of the Pinsk Ghetto (now in Pinsk, Belarus). About 20,000 inhabitants were murdered, shot either in the ghetto or over prepared pits. Aftermath The Order Police as a whole had not been declared a criminal organisation by the Allies, unlike the SS, and its members were able to reintegrate into society largely unmolested, with many returning to police careers in Austria and West Germany. Six members of Police Battalion 306 were tried in the 1960s in West Germany for the murders committed in Pinsk and Stolin. They were given short prison sentences.

She belonged to the elite members of the Royal Danish Theatre in 1774-1805. She has been referred to as one of the three most noted female opera singers in 18th-century Denmark.Birgitte Winther in Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon Life Birgitte Winther was the daughter of the school teacher Peder Winther and Bolette Marie Palle. She never married. She was one of the first students to be included in the first class of the newly founded opera school in 1773. She was the student of Michel Angelo Potenza. She made her debut in 1774. Though active both as a singer and an actress, as was the custom at the Royal theater, she was famed as an opera singer. As an actress, she was somewhat criticized for being too stiff. As a singer, however, Winther was named the best opera singer in Denmark and as the prima donna of the Danish opera alongside Catharine Frydendahl and Caroline Frederikke Müller. She was considered undefeated in her ability to perform long arias. Not only active at the Royal Danish Theatre, she also toured Denmark and performed on concerts at the countryside. Also in the capital, she frequently performed in concerts, and along Michael Rosing and Jens Musted, she often performed at the concerts hosted by Det musikalske Selskab and Det harmoniske Selskab, to such an extent that the Royal Theatre complained and stated that when Winther performed so often outside of the theatre, it was not longer necessary for the audience to come there to hear her, which caused the theatre a financial loss. She retired in 1805 after a successful career and died in Copenhagen.

Segel said that he chose to shoot in Philadelphia because during location scouting he was surprised to learn that the city is full of colorful public art; he said seeing the Magic Gardens for the first time was the moment he knew Philly was the right location for the show.

Biography  Member of a Porfiriano oligarchy family (son of Captain Mateo Uruchurtu Díaz and Mercedes Ramírez Estrella), the young Uruchurtu travelled to Mexico City to study law. He married a fellow student, the aristocrat Gertrudis Caraza y Landero, with whom he had seven children. He and his family moved to Mexico City. His friendship with the prominent Porfirista and Cientifico Ramón Corral opened the doors to Mexico's political life. His close ties to the dictatorship forced him, upon the fall of the regime and banishment of Porfirio Díaz in 1911, to leave the country and take refuge in Europe. In 1912 he visited his friend and political godfather in France, the also banished Ramón Corral. On March 1, Uruchurtu met with Corral. Upon completion of his assignment, the Sonoran acquired his ticket to travel on April 10 on the transatlantic liner Paris, from Cherbourg, France to Veracruz, Mexico. At the end of March or the beginning of April of that year, Uruchurtu, who was staying at the Hotel París, was visited by Guillermo Obregón, son-in- law of Ramón Corral and president of the Great Commission of the Mexican Chamber of Deputies. Obregon had paid a little over 27 £ for a first class ticket that would allow him to sail on the luxurious ocean liner RMS Titanic's maiden voyage, but had changed his mind and wished to exchange tickets, to which Uruchurtu agreed; Guillermo Obregón would travel in the Paris and Uruchurtu in the Titanic with the ticket No. P C 17601. On April 8, Uruchurtu was invited to a party with exiles loyal to Porfirio Diaz and on the 10th of the same month he sent a postcard to his mother in Hermosillo, telling her that the photograph on the postcard was more or less the ship in which he would travel, and that upon arriving in Mexico he would visit her in Hermosillo to tell her about the trip on the famous ship. That same day, in Cherbourg, he boarded the Titanic along with 273 other passengers. After the wreck of the ship, the body of Uruchurtu was never recovered.  The last moments aboard the Titanic  The popularly-accepted anecdote of Uruchurtu tells that on the night of the sinking of the Titanic, Uruchurtu was assigned to lifeboat number 11 thanks to his status as a congressman on an official visit. Once on board, he observed a second-class lady passenger named Elizabeth Ramell Nye (age 29), who begged to be included in the lifeboat, claiming that her husband and son were waiting in New York. The officers refused to let her get on the boat since it was at its maximum capacity and would jeopardize its stability. Uruchurtu exited the lifeboat and gave his place to the lady, asking that in case he died, she would visit his wife and family in Mexico (Hermosillo and Xalapa) to let them know about his last minutes in life. Nye was rescued and survived; but Uruchurtu died in the sinking. Later it was discovered that Elizabeth Nye had lied, since she was not married or had any children. However, the woman kept her promise and in 1924 traveled to Xalapa, Veracruz to find the widow of Uruchurtu and tell her the story of her husband's last moments. On August 24, 2012, the journalist Guadalupe Loaeza, author of the book El caballero del Titanic (The Gentleman of the Titanic), published on the centenary of the sinking, recounted the events described above for El Mañana. However, she has stated publicly that there is no proof of this anecdote.

History  A newspaper recruiting advertisement for the regiment, showing the bounty offered A newspaper recruiting advertisement for the regiment The regiment was organized at Camp Cadwalader near Philadelphia on 22 July 1864, under the command of volunteer officer Colonel John R. Haslett, who had worked as a house painter before the war. It was alternately known as the 3rd Coal Exchange Regiment due to its having been organized with the assistance of the Coal Exchange Association of Philadelphia, and had a total enrollment of 932. All companies were recruited in Philadelphia, except for a portion of one company in Montgomery County. According to Samuel Penniman Bates' official history, \\"a large proportion\\" of the regiment were \\"well schooled soldiers.\\" Shortly after its organization, the regiment was sent to Camp Bradford at Mankin's Woods near Baltimore on 29 July, where it trained for two weeks. From there, it entrained for Rock Island in August to guard Confederate prisoners of war. The number of guards was insufficient for the task, and this placed pressure on the 197th, which repeated the 133rd Illinois Infantry's practice of firing upon prisoners, but was otherwise undistinguished. The regiment returned to Philadelphia at the end of its term, and was mustered out there on 11 November. During its service, six men of the regiment died of disease.

Among others territories of the former Crown of Aragon, the coats of arms of Catalonia, Aragon, Valencia and the Balearic Islands include the Four Bars.«En lo que hace a la cuestión heráldica, toda vez que [...] no hay duda de que el primer poseedor de los palos de oro y gules fue Ramón Berenguer IV, no puede haberla tampoco de que ese emblema personal lo era entonces (1150) de un miembro de la Casa de Aragón, dentro de la cual se hizo símbolo hereditario a partir de su adopción por los tres hijos de aquél, Alfonso, Pedro y Sancho».

Retrieved 22 July 2018«Dado que la cruz de San Jorge era el emblema tradicional de la ciudad de Barcelona y también de la Generalidad de Cataluña, se consideró a menudo que las armas propias del principado eran las que unían esta señal con las de sus soberanos, los palos de oro y gules. Por ello, en los siglos XVI y XVII se emplearon, de forma similar a la aragonesa, diversas variantes del escudo de Cataluña. Los modelos básicos son dos: el que acoge únicamente los palos y el que los combina con la cruz georgiana.» Cfr. Montaner, op. cit., pp. 105 and foll. = Saint George's Cross = The first instance of a cross is found in a seal of 1288. The Saint George's Cross is shown on a 13th-century mural of the Tinell Hall, depicting by Barcelonan or Catalan soldiers. The Neighborly host ordinances of 1395 ordered: «Than for the city councillors, the present be made a long side banner which has the sign of Saint George, containing a red cross on a white field, that is badge of the city». Thus the cross seem to have been used as a distinguishing and official of Barcelonan citizens, or perhaps slightly earlier. The Aragonese Royal Standard (and County of Barcelona, the four red stripes on a yellow field) used alongside the banner of the city worn by Barcelonan soldiers and later joining them in a quartering first depicted on the heraldic sign and later on the banner. Quartering in is a method of joining several different coats of arms together in one shield to avoid conflict with otherwise similar coats of arms but quarters are numbered from the dexter chief (the corner nearest to the right shoulder of a man standing behind the shield), proceeding across the top row, and then across the next row and so on. The arms of the citizens were placed in the most honourable quarters (the first and fourth) because their representative traditionally forced the king to negotiate his policies. In 1359 the Generalitat of Catalonia adopted the Saint George's Cross as flag and sign «by being the ancient arms of the County of Barcelona». = Number of bars = Version of the arms of Barcelona with two bars on the ancient main façade of the City Hall Before the Royal grant of 1345, that set the number of paletts to four, where periods when four pallets were alternated with three or two. Later the shield charged with two bars was recurrent source of discussion as a proper variant of Barcelona. In 1996 was adopted a monochrome logotype as official emblem of Barcelona, a rhombus or lozenge with the cross two bars impaled, sharply defined edges and without the crown. A secondary version, for ceremonial use and shown in the seal of the city with four pallets, quartered, and a former royal crown. The versions of 1996 caused such controversy, because they were not designed to conform to traditional heraldic rules and the content of the Law of local symbols of Catalonia, that led to the Catalan Society of Genealogy, Heraldry, Sigillography, Vexillology and Nobility lodged an appeal against them. This appeal to repeal the emblems of 1996 was successful and a most appropriate version had to be created, so the current arms, quartered with four bars was adopted in 2004.  Crest  The coat of arms of Barcelona with the Aragonese royal crest (1627) The coat of arms of Barcelona with a county crown and the crest of the bat (Early 20th Century) Since the 15th century a former royal crown (without arches, orb and cross) set atop the shield, as was customary in territories of the Crown. In the 17th century was introduced the royal crest of the Aragonese monarchs, a winged dragon, as the city Valencia or Palma have done during the previous century. In some cases, the winged dragon will in time be transformed into in a bat, Rat penat, commonly used in local heraldry. Together with the crest, a helmet was situated above the shield and bears lambrequins and the former royal crown (open). By the 19th century the bat has cornered the dragon as can be seen in the Official Gazette of Catalonia and Barcelona since 1810. The bat and the former royal crown without the helmet were remained for much of the century. The removal of the bat from the coat of arms of Barcelona has been seen as a loss of an emblematic symbol shared by other capitals of the former Crown of Aragon as Palma, capital of the former Kingdom of Mallorca and Valencia, in the former homonymous kingdom. = Royal and condal crown = During 16th and 17th centuries the use of the heraldry of Barcelona was also used as coat of arms of the Principality of Catalonia. This use may reflect the Principality as heir of the County of Barcelona or the governmental capacity of the Generalitat over the territory of the former county. The heraldry of the city of Barcelona has depicted different types of heraldic crowns, both royal or county crown have been used in different variants. The crown of count referred the history of the territory and the royal crown has been reflected the rank of the titular of the county. The royal crown equals city and territory as other realms of the Hispanic Monarchy. For this reason, the historiography referred to these holders as Count-King (Comte-rei). From 1800 to 1931, successive town and city councils used both crowns with or without the crest of the bat. After the Spanish Civil War, the coat of arms showed a former royal crown without the crest.Image of Barcelona, Stamps of Spanish capitals of provinces. Retrieved 28 July 2018.

The sign of the Saint George's Cross was widely displayed on a lozenge by the City Council and the Generalitat. The laurel wreath is a symbol of victory and honor and the olive one represents peace. In Spain many civic coats of arms use the former or the modern Royal Crown as heraldic crest. The Provincial Council has a logo commonly used as official emblem. The provincial flag contains these arms but it has horizontal stripes.

During this period, she went on overseas training cruises, frequently to South America, the West Indies, or the Mediterranean Sea. She was used as a headquarters ship for the High Seas Fleet from 1906 to 1910, when the Reichstag cut funding for the vessel. She was stricken from the naval register in June 1911 and used as a barracks ship until April 1923, when she was renamed Hulk C and sold to a private shipping company, which converted her into a lighter and used in that role from 1925 to 1930 under her original name, when she was broken up. Design After the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–1871, the Kaiserliche Marine began an expansion program to strengthen the fleet to meet the demands imposed by Germany's increased economic activities abroad and to prepare it for a potential future conflict with France. Through the mid and late 1870s, the German fleet ordered twelve corvettes of the and es; these vessels had limited combat capabilities, emphasizing long range cruising rather than engaging hostile cruisers. This program began under the direction of General Albrecht von Stosch, the chief of the Kaiserliche Admiralität (Imperial Admiralty); the contract to build a new corvette, Nixe, was awarded in August 1882. Stosch was replaced in 1883 by General Leo von Caprivi. Caprivi believed that all new cruisers should have a more balanced design that placed greater emphasis on combat power. Though the ships of the Carola class had not yet been completed, the Admiralität was bound by the fleet plan that had been adopted in 1873, and so despite Caprivi's preferences, construction of Nixe and the similar but larger corvette went ahead. Nixe in particular had an insufficiently powerful propulsion system and a too weak battery of guns, leaving her essentially useless as a combat vessel. The historians Hans Hildebrand, Albert Röhr, and Hans-Otto Steinmetz stated that \\"why no one objected to the building of this ship cannot be determined from the record.\\" They suggested that Caprivi's inexperience, since he had just replaced Stosch, contributed to the decision to allow construction to proceed. They also argued that inconclusive debates in the Reichstag (Imperial Diet) over the needs of the navy pressured the Admiralität into adhering to the plan despite the obvious shortcomings of the design. =Characteristics= Nixe was long at the waterline and long overall. She had a beam of and a draft of forward and . She displaced as designed and up to at full load. The ship's hull was constructed with transverse iron frames with one layer of wood planks, which were sheathed with copper to prevent biofouling on extended cruises abroad, where shipyard facilities were not readily available. Her hull was divided into nine watertight compartments. The ship's crew consisted of 27 officers and 331 enlisted men, though as a training ship later in her career, her complement amounted to 17 officers and 354 sailors, of whom 125 were naval cadets. She carried a variety of small boats, including one picket boat, one launch, three (later two) cutters, two yawls, and two (later one) dinghies. Steering was controlled with a single rudder. The vessel was a very poor sea boat, and yawed badly when running before the wind; without her sails, the rudder had to be kept at 5–10 degrees to the leeward side to keep the ship on a straight course. She also lost significant speed in a head sea. =Machinery= The ship was powered by a 2-cylinder marine steam engine that drove a single shaft with one 2-bladed screw propeller. Steam was provided by two coal-fired fire-tube boilers, which were ducted into a retractable funnel. The ship was designed for a top speed of at , though she reached at on speed trials. Coal storage amounted to . She had a cruising radius of at a speed of , though this fell to at . As built, Nixe was equipped with a full ship rig to supplement their steam engines on overseas cruising missions, though this was later reduced. =Armament= Nixe was armed with a battery of eight L/23 breech-loading guns, two of which were later removed; these were supplied with a total of 800 shells. These guns had a range of . Later in her career, two SK L/30 quick-firing guns and four Hotchkiss revolver cannon were added. The two 8.8 cm guns were given a total of 300 shells. Service history =Construction – 1894= Nixe moored to a buoy Nixe was laid down at the Kaiserliche Werft (Imperial Shipyard) in Danzig in August 1883 under the contract name Ersatz as a replacement for the old corvette. She was launched on 23 July 1885 and at the launching ceremony, the director of the shipyard, Konteradmiral (Rear Admiral) Johann-Heinrich Pirner christened the ship after the Nixe water spirits of German mythology. She was commissioned on 1 April 1886 and began sea trials. She then went into the Kaiserliche Werft in Kiel, where she was fitted out as a training ship for naval cadets and Schiffsjungen (apprentice seamen). Nixe went on her first cruise with a contingent of Schiffsjungen from 17 to 31 May. Nixe began her first major overseas cruise on 15 June, which went to South and Central America. She first visited Bahía Blanca and then toured the West Indies. While in St. Thomas, she joined the Training Squadron and left with the rest of the ships to return to Germany on 3 February 1887. They stopped in Queenstown, Ireland on 4 March, where Nixe left the Training Squadron to proceed independently, stopping in Lisbon, Portugal and Gibraltar before finally arriving back in Kiel on 25 July. She took part in the annual fleet maneuvers from 6 to 28 August in the Bay of Danzig and then served as the guard ship in Wilhelmshaven for the Marinestation der Nordsee (North Sea Naval Station) from 17 September 1887 to 17 April 1888. Nixe resumed training duties in April, first with short cruises in the Baltic Sea. On 4 June, she embarked on her next major cruise to visit the West Indies and ports in Canada, arriving back in Kiel on 9 September 1889. She was decommissioned on 30 September and then recommissioned on 9 April 1890. The ship conducted more Baltic training cruises until 10 June, when she went on another cruise to the West Indies; during this voyage, she visited ports in Venezuela and Norfolk, Virginia in the United States. She reached Kiel on 25 August 1891 and immediately joined the fleet maneuvers, which lasted until 18 September. The next year's training program began on 1 April 1892, and it followed the same pattern as the previous year, but the overseas cruise instead went to the Mediterranean Sea. During this trip, the crew suffered an outbreak of typhoid. The annual fleet maneuvers followed her return in early September, after which she began the winter training cruise on 23 September, again to the West Indies. This was the first such voyage that Nixe carried a group of cadets from the Marineschule (Naval School). On her return to Germany on 15 March 1894, Nixe was decommissioned for a modernization at the Kaiserliche Werft in Danzig. =1897–1930= Nixe underway, c. 1892 Nixe returned to service on 1 April 1897; in late September she began the winter training cruise to the West Indies, and while on the return voyage, she was diverted to Kamerun to participate in the funeral ceremonies for the funeral of Ndumbe Lobe Bell, the pro-German leader of the Duala people, on 12 December. Nixe left Kamerun on 12 January 1898 and arrived in Kiel on 19 March, after which she underwent periodic maintenance. The ship went on training cruises in the Baltic, and on 15 August she began the next overseas cruise, which went to South America, including stops in Brazil and Argentina. While in São Francisco do Sul, Brazil, a portion of her crew visited the German enclave in Joinville. Nixe reached Kiel on 1 April 1899 and went into the shipyard for another overhaul. After returning to service, Nixe started the next major training cruise in mid-May, which again went to the West Indies. While in the Caribbean Sea, a revolution broke out in Venezuela, prompting the German government to order Nixe to visit the ports of La Guaira and Puerto Cabello to protect German interests from the violence. On 6 November, she was replaced by the corvettes and , allowing Nixe to resume her training duties before returning to Kiel on 26 March 1900. She began the year's training program on 25 May with a short cruise to Vlissingen, the Netherlands from 31 May to 6 June. She then went on a training cruise to visit St. Petersburg, Russia. On returning from the trip, she was decommissioned to free her crew for other purposes, as the navy was facing a shortage owing to the expedition to China to participate in the suppression of the Boxer Rebellion. The navy had planned to modernize the ship in 1901, but the loss of the corvette off Málaga forced the Admiralität to reduce the modernization to a simple reduction in her rigging. She was not recommissioned until 1 November 1906, however, and she was used only as a headquarters ship for the High Seas Fleet. The Reichstag did not allocate funds for the reactivation of Nixe in the 1910 fiscal year, however, and so she had to be decommissioned again on 18 May. Nixe was stricken from the naval register on 24 June 1911, the last sailing ship of the Imperial Navy still on the register, and converted into a barracks ship at Kiel. She served on that capacity, attached to the Naval Gunnery School, into the 1920s. On 1 April 1923, she was renamed Hulk C, and was sold to a private firm. Converted into a sea-going lighter and renamed Nixe, she was operated by the firm Emil Retzlaff, based in Stettin, until 1930, when she was broken up in Wewelsfleth.

By 1920, he had become quite wealthy and an influential player in Republican Party politics. He allegedly swung enough Republican votes to assure Warren G. Harding would be the Republican candidate for President, and subsequently become the President-elect. It was rumored that Harding would name Hamon to an important post in the new administration. His murder, and the subsequent trial of his mistress, was national news in 1920. His mistress, private secretary and business agent, Clara Smith, was found innocent of murder charges.  Personal life  Hamon graduated from the University of Kansas with a law degree in 1898. He married Georgia Perkins in 1898 in Sedan, Kansas. They had two children, Jake L. Hamon Jr. (b. 1901) and Olivebelle Hamon (b, 1909).  Career  Hamon moved to Lawton in 1901. He became city attorney. He was elected mayor. He was voted out of office in 1903, amid accusations of corruption and claims of extorting money from local gamblers. He became chairman of the Oklahoma Territory Republican National Committee. In 1909, he was a lobbyist in Washington, D. C.. In 1910, he was accused of trying to bribe U.S. Senator Thomas Gore to support some land contracts that attorney J. M. McMurray had made with the Chickasaw and Choctaw Nations. Gore claimed that the contracts were worth $30 million, and that Hamon stood to gain a 10 percent fee contingent on the sales. Hamon had offered Gore $25,000 for his favorable vote. Gore continued to oppose the sale. The charge was investigated by a congressional committee, where both McMurray and Hamon denied under oath that they had attempted to bribe the Senator Gore. He moved to Ardmore, Oklahoma in 1912, and, with circus owner, John Ringling, built a railway from Ardmore to Ringling, Oklahoma. Hamon had already begun speculating in oil leases in the Healdton oil field, where he reportedly became very wealthy. In 1920, he was elected a Republican National Committeeman for Oklahoma, defeating John Embry of Chandler and Oklahoma City's James J. McGraw of Oklahoma City. He helped broker the selection of Warren G. Harding for candidate for US President. As a result, he was believed to be inline for selection for a cabinet post.  Clara Smith Hamon  Robinson's article says that Jake Hamon met Clara Belle Smith at a store in Lawton when he was 40 and she was 16, and that they began a love affair shortly after. She was beautiful and very ambitious to get out of small-town Oklahoma. Soon, Jake sent her to a business school, where she displayed a sharp mind for the subject. He also sent her to a finishing school, so she could behave appropriately and comfortably while dealing with important people. Showing still more nerve and ruthlessness, Jake summoned his nephew, Walter, and offered him $10,000 to marry Clara, then disappear to California, leaving Clara in Oklahoma. Apparently Walter accepted the whole deal. When Georgia Hamon, Jake's wife, figured out the relationship between Jake and Clara, and that she had essentially been abandoned by Jake, she confronted all three. In the end, she said that she would not give her husband a divorce, but would take their two children and go live in Chicago. True to her word, Georgia moved to Chicago. Jake and Clara continued to live life as usual. They returned to Ardmore, Oklahoma where they lived in luxurious adjoining rooms at the Randol Hotel. In 1919, Jake would campaign for election as Republican National Committeeman.  1920 Presidential election  This election turned increasingly bitter. His opponents in the party began a campaign to undermine his public credibility and reputation, even claiming that he was not a resident of the state. One attack in the press openly called him a womanizer. When it seemed that he might actually lose the election, Hamon called Georgia and begged her to return to the state and campaign with him. Amazingly, she agreed, and he was able to present himself as a good family man. The party faithful jumped into line behind him, enabling him to win the election and making him even more powerful in party politics. A few months before the 1920 Presidential election, Hamon met Warren G. Harding for the first time. At the meeting, Hamon first learned that Florence Harding was a second cousin of his estranged wife, Georgia. The news ended any thought Jake might have had about divorcing Georgia. Clara quickly realized the same thing and put more pressure on Jake to initiate a divorce. By June 1920, Jake had impressed Harding's campaign manager, Harry M. Daugherty, that he could swing enough campaign money and votes to Harding to give the Ohioan the party nomination, in exchange for the right offer. After Harding won the general election in November, a rumor spread that the new President had offered Hamon the post of Secretary of the Interior. Many political observers seemed surprised that Hamon declined the job. Decades later, Bob Hutchins, a close associate of Hamon revealed the probable reason:\\"Harding directed Hamon to bring his 'legitimate family' to Washington, D.C., and to leave his secretary in Ardmore.\\"  Death  A confidant of the new president came to Ardmore on November 21, 1920. Hamon had ordered a private dinner set up in the Randol Hotel for himself and his visitor, where they were expecting to talk about Hamon's role in the new administration. According to Bob Hutchins, Clara was not included, but she came down early from upstairs, totally drunk by at least report. She and Hamon had an argument before Jake told her to go back to her room and threatened to have police arrest her for disorderly conduct. Hutchins escorted Clara to her room, where she apparently laid down and fell asleep. When Hamon told Hutchins that he wanted to go up and console her, Hutchins warned him not to go because she had been so distraught all afternoon. Hutchins claimed he said, \\"She thinks you are giving her the brushoff. If you go up there now, you will come down on a death wagon.” Later that evening, Hamon came down alone, reeling, and collapsed when he reached the dining room. Hutchins rushed to his side and discovered Jake had been shot. A local surgeon was awaiting dinner in the restaurant, and quickly helped Hutchins get the victim to the nearby Ardmore Sanitarium and Hospital. Hutchins waited while doctors worked on Hamon. Jake claimed he had been cleaning his pistol, and the gun accidentally went off. Meanwhile, the doctors found that the bullet had lodged against the victim's spine, and they considered the situation inoperable. While fading in and out of consciousness, Hamon told Hutchins to take Clara to his own home in El Paso immediately and send her to Mexico. Then see that she came back in time for her trial in court. Hutchins faithfully complied. Hamon continued to linger between life and death for five days. Georgia made it back in time to hold his hand as he took his last breath on November 26, 1920.  Aftermath  He was killed by Clara Smith Hamon, his mistress and the wife of his nephew. She pleaded self-defense. After a trial which lasted seven days, the jury reported back in 39 minutes with a finding of not guilty. After her trial, Clara nearly disappeared into obscurity. She apparently tried to work as an actress. The Missouri newspaper,Bolivar Herald Free Press recently ran a series about her that opened with a 1921 headline, “Clara Smith Hamon Film Will Be Barred in City.” The article went on to explain who Clara Smith Hamon and Jake L. Hamon were.The silent movie's title was not even named in the article.Johns, Paul W. \\"Her only movie was banned from Springfield.\\" Bolivar Herald Free Press. March 22, 2017.

Background of Northern Cyprus Northern Cyprus (), officially the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus (TRNC; ), is a de facto state that comprises the northeastern portion of the island of Cyprus. Recognised only by Turkey, Northern Cyprus is considered by the international community to be part of the Republic of Cyprus. Northern Cyprus extends from the tip of the Karpass Peninsula in the northeast to Morphou Bay, Cape Kormakitis and its westernmost point, the Kokkina exclave in the west. Its southernmost point is the village of Louroujina. A buffer zone under the control of the United Nations stretches between Northern Cyprus and the rest of the island and divides Nicosia, the island's largest city and capital of both sides. A coup d'état in 1974, performed as part of an attempt to annexe the island to Greece, prompted the Turkish invasion of Cyprus. This resulted in the eviction of much of the north's Greek Cypriot population, the flight of Turkish Cypriots from the south, and the partitioning of the island, leading to a unilateral declaration of independence by the north in 1983. Due to its lack of recognition, Northern Cyprus is heavily dependent on Turkey for economic, political and military support. Attempts to reach a solution to the Cyprus dispute have been unsuccessful. The Turkish Army maintains a large force in Northern Cyprus. While its presence is supported and approved by the TRNC government, the Republic of Cyprus, the European Union as a whole, and the international community regard it as an occupation force, and its presence has been denounced in several United Nations Security Council resolutions. Northern Cyprus is a semi-presidential, democratic republic with a cultural heritage incorporating various influences and an economy that is dominated by the services sector. The economy has seen growth through the 2000s and 2010s, with the GNP per capita more than tripling in the 2000s, but is held back by an international embargo due to the official closure of the ports in Northern Cyprus by the Republic of Cyprus. The official language is Turkish, with a distinct local dialect being spoken. The vast majority of the population consists of Sunni Muslims, while religious attitudes are mostly moderate and secular. Northern Cyprus is an observer of the OIC and ECO, and has observer status in the PACE under the title \\"Turkish Cypriot Community\\". Connection to the Jews of Cyprus The history of the Jews in Cyprus dates back at least to the 2nd century BCE, when a considerable community of Jews on the island is first attested.E. Mary Smallwood, The Jews Under Roman Rule: From Pompey to Diocletian: a Study in Political Relations, BRILL, 2001 The Jews had close relationships with many of the other religious groups on the island and were seen favourably by the Romans. During the war over the city of Ptolemais between Alexander Jannaeus and Ptolemy IX Lathyros, King of Cyprus, many Jews were killed. During the war the Jewish citizens remained committed in their allegiance to King Lathyros. Connection to the Jews of Turkey The history of the Jews in Turkey (, Turkish Jews; Yehudim Turkim, ) covers the 2400 years that Jews have lived in what is now Turkey. There have been Jewish communities in Anatolia since at least the fifth century BCE and many Spanish and Portuguese Jews expelled from Spain by the Alhambra Decree were welcomed into the Ottoman Empire in the late 15th century, including regions now part of Turkey, centuries later, forming the bulk of the Ottoman Jews. Today, the vast majority of Turkish Jews live in Israel, while modern-day Turkey continues to host a modest Jewish population. Connection to the Jews of Greece The history of the Jews in Greece can be traced back to at least the fourth century BCE. The oldest and the most characteristic Jewish group that has inhabited Greece are the Romaniotes, also known as \\"Greek Jews\\". The term \\"Greek Jew\\" is predominantly used for any person of Jewish descent or faith that lives in or originates from the modern region of Greece.

However, although Biron advanced and planned to take the city of Mons and eventually Brussels, he judged his forces were not strong enough and decided to retreat.

It is part of the Okanogan Range which is a sub-range of the North Cascades Range. Porcupine Peak is situated north of Rainy Pass and south of Mount Hardy on land administered by Okanogan National Forest. The nearest higher peak is Cutthroat Peak, to the southeast. Porcupine Peak can be seen from the North Cascades Highway which follows below the southwest slopes of the mountain. Precipitation runoff from the mountain drains into the Porcupine Creek, Swamp Creek, and Granite Creek. These three creeks, which nearly encircle the mountain, ultimately empty to the Skagit River. Climate Porcupine Peak is located in the marine west coast climate zone of western North America.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades (Orographic lift). As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, p. 16 Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The “U”-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades area.

The video ended with the person filming crying out and running away. The video became popular in August 2016, buoyed by many existing conspiracy theories concerning CERN.

The video caused controversy both by creating mockery of existing theories and by fueling existing conspiracy theories about CERN activities.

Most members of the group joined Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) in January 2017. The founding leader of Jaysh al-Ahrar, Hashim al-Shaykh (\\"Abu Jaber\\") was appointed as the head of HTS. Jaysh al-Ahrar left HTS in September 2017, and have since then closely cooperated with both HTS and Ahrar al-Sham, as well as other rebel groups in the area. History =Formation and HTS= On 20 September 2016, Ahrar al-Sham's shura council authorized its fighters to cooperate with the Turkish Armed Forces and the Turkish-backed Free Syrian Army and participate in Operation Euphrates Shield against the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant and the Syrian Democratic Forces, while the Battle of Aleppo was still active. This led to a split between Ahrar al- Sham's majority pro-Turkey, nationalist and pragmatic faction on one side and its minority Salafi jihadist faction, who favoured a merger with Jabhat Fatah al-Sham, the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda, on the other. Members of the pragmatic faction opposed such merger in fears of losing support from foreign backers, mainly Turkey. On 1 December, 16 units from the hardliner faction grouped together under the name of Jaysh al-Ahrar, led by Abu Jaber. Soon after its formation, Jaysh al-Ahrar destroyed Liwa Ahfad al-Sahaba in the Kafr Halab area after the latter killed one of the former's fighters. On 22 January 2017, amid heavy infighting between Ahrar al-Sham and JFS, Abu Jaber announced the temporary dissolution of Jaysh al-Ahrar, while continuing to push for a merger with JFS. This merger was achieved when JFS, member groups of Jaysh al-Ahrar and other Ahrar al-Sham defectors, Jabhat Ansar al-Din, Liwa al-Haqq, Jaysh al-Sunna, and the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement formed Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (HTS) on 28 January. Abu Jaber was named HTS's general commander. In September 2017, a number of Jaysh al-Ahrar members left HTS due to disagreements with HTS after a leak in which Abu Muhammad al-Julani and HTS Idlib commander Abu Hamza Binnish discussed using foreign Salafi jihadist clerics such as Abdullah al-Muhaysini as tools. While Abu Maria al-Qahtani encouraged Abu Muhammad al- Julani to eliminate other rebel groups and to develop a relationship with Iran. The split came after Muhaysini as well as another cleric officially resigned from HTS. However Jaysh al-Ahrar and HTS both agreed to maintain good terms and continue to cooperate. Abu Jaber remained with HTS. On 1 October, he resigned as HTS's general commander, being replaced by Abu Muhammad al-Julani, who was considered to be HTS's top commander all along. Abu Jaber was then appointed as the head of HTS's shura council. =Post-HTS= Jaysh al-Ahrar fought alongside other rebel groups, including HTS, Ahrar al-Sham, Free Idlib Army, Army of Victory, Army of Glory, Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement, and Jund al-Malahim against the Syrian Army's Northwestern Syria campaign (October 2017–February 2018), which resulted in a rebel defeat. In February 2018, during fighting between Hayat Tahrir al-Sham and the Syrian Liberation Front, a coalition of Ahrar al-Sham and the Nour al-Din al-Zenki Movement, Jaysh al- Ahrar released a statement urging the Turkistan Islamic Party in Syria to not get involved in the fighting on the side of HTS, and for HTS' leader Abu Mohammad al-Julani to submit to the authority of a Sharia court in order to mediate the conflict.https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DWqtG- DW0AAhjuT?format=jpg&name;=900x900 On 18 June 2018, unidentified gunmen assassinated Jaysh al-Ahrar deputy commander Khalil Ismail Arslan (\\"Abu Ismail Gubas\\") and his son in a village near Saraqib.

Jephthah's daughter, sometimes later referred to as Seila or as Iphis, is a figure in the Hebrew Bible, whose story is recounted in Judges 11. The judge Jephthah had just won a battle over the Ammonites, and vowed that he would offer the first thing that came out of his house as a burnt offering to Yahweh. However, his only child, an unnamed daughter, came out to meet him dancing and playing a tambourine (v. 34). She encourages Jephthah to fulfill his vow (v. 36) but asks for two months to weep for her virginity (v. 38). After this period of time Jephthah fulfilled his vow and offered his daughter. The majority opinion among commentators is that Jephthah killed his daughter as an act of human sacrifice. There is, however, a minority opinion that Jephthah's daughter spent the rest of her life in seclusion. This is based on considerations such as weeping for her virginity would make no sense if she were about to die (although it would be sensible in light of the Biblical commandment to \\"be fruitful and multiply\\", which she would now no longer be able to fulfill). Commentators holding to the minority view include David Kimhi, Keil and Delitzsch, James B. Jordan, and Jehovah's Witnesses.  Later influence  Jephthah's daughter was not given a central role in many pre-medieval texts: the major exception being the first-century Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum of \\"Pseudo-Philo\\", which devoted an entire chapter to her (and gave her the name of \\"Seila\\"). The French scholar Peter Abelard (d. 1142) praised Selia in his lament Planctus virginum Israel super filia Jephte. In a letter to his lover Héloïse d'Argenteuil, Abelard also portrayed Selia as a model for monastic women who devote their lives to God. In other medieval Christian texts, Jephthah's daughter was portrayed as a type of Virgin Mary and her death was likened to the purification of the Virgin. During the medieval period, some Jewish communities refrained from drinking water from wells and rivers for a few hours at four key times of the year (a custom called the tekufah). In the twelfth century Rabbi Judah the Pious wrote that the tekufah that fell during the month of Tishre was observed because of Jephthah's daughter. Jephthah's daughter is called \\"Adah\\" by the Order of the Eastern Star and is one of its five heroines, representing obedience to duty.

The store banners are printed in five languages: Russian, Polish, Lithuanian, French, and German The Józef Zawadzki printing shop was a family-owned printing shop operating in Vilnius (Vilna, Wilno) from 1805 to 1939. It was established by Józef Zawadzki who took over the failing printing press of Vilnius University established in 1575. It was one of the largest and most prominent printing presses in Vilnius. Until 1828, it had the exclusive rights to publish university publications. It published numerous books and periodicals in Polish (e.g. the first collection of poetry by Adam Mickiewicz), Latin, Lithuanian (e.g. works by bishop Motiejus Valančius). It suffered difficulties due to Russification policies that closed Vilnius University in 1832 and banned Lithuanian press in 1864, but recovered after the restrictions were lifted due to the Russian Revolution of 1905. After World War I, it had difficulty competing with the larger printing presses in Poland. The press was sold to a Lithuanian company Spindulys in 1939 and nationalized by the Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic in 1940. After World War II, the press was transferred to the communist daily Tiesa. History Zawadzki, after studies of economy and book publishing in Wrocław and Leipzig, moved to Vilnius, then part of the Russian Empire, in 1803. He established a small printing press (his first work appears to be a student dissertation on galactorrhea published in June 1803). He bought inventory of the printing press of Vilnius University, which traced its roots to a press established by Mikołaj Krzysztof \\"the Orphan\\" Radziwiłł in 1575, on 1 November 1805 for 3,000 silver rubles payable in installments over ten years. Additionally, he rented the premises for ten years for another annual payment of 300 silver rubles. Zawadzki received financial assistance from Adam Kazimierz Czartoryski, who gifted him 1,000 ducats. The rental agreement was renewed until 1828 when Zawadzki lost the title of university printer and had to move out of the campus (at present-day Šv. Jono g. 4) to his own home (at present-day Bernardinų g. 8), where the press operated until 1940. Adam Zawadzki who inherited the press from his father When Zawadzki took over the press, he found 11 printing presses (seven of them outdated) and eight employees. He quickly purchased two new printing presses and typesets for Latin, Polish, Russian, Greek, German, Hebrew, and Arabic languages. The number of employees grew to 35 within a year. The press printed books, textbooks and academic literature for the university, periodicals, calendars, and (from 1808) sheet music. It also collaborated with the Jewish Romm publishing house. Zawadzki was a bibliophile and cared for the quality of the books, both in terms of accuracy of the texts (spelling, etc.) and graphic design. He hired the first full-time proofreader Jan Paweł Dworzecki- Bohdanowicz and worked with western printers to adapt new technologies. He imported high quality paper from Germany and France. To help sell the books, the press had its own bookstores in Vilnius, Warsaw, and Varniai (1853–1864). The bookstore in Vilnius was particularly large, numbering 20,000 titles in 1821. In 1853, the bookstore moved to new three-floor premises. It had sections of English, French, German, Italian, Lithuanian books and operated a library. Historian and librarian estimated that the bookstore in Kražiai sold about 8,000 books from late 1859 to March 1863. After the death of Józef Zawadzki, the press was inherited by his son Adam (1814–1875) but was managed by his wife until 1851. The failed Uprisings of 1831 and 1863 brought a wave of repressions and restrictions on books and periodicals. The university was closed in 1832 taking away textbook and academic publishing while Lithuanian press was banned in 1864. When Lithuanian books were banned, the press had 5,696 copies of four primers that were confiscated and burned. It also had 62,994 copies of 36 titles of pre-1864 Lithuanian books that it managed to get a permit to sell off. Many Lithuanian publishers in East Prussia used to counterfeit publication data, indicating that a book was published by the Zawadzki Press in 1863, in order to confuse the Russian police. The company improved its fortunes by the end of the 19th century and particularly after various restrictions were lifted due to the Russian Revolution of 1905. It was one of the first presses to acquire Lithuanian typesets in 1904. In 1909, it acquired the printing shop of Edmund Nowicki, which he had moved from Saint Petersburg in 1906. Expecting large orders from bishop Eduard von der Ropp, Nowicki employed 40–50 workers. It became a branch of the main Zawadzki Press. The company diminished during World War I and found it difficult to compete with larger printers in the Second Polish Republic. It stopped printing Lithuanian texts in 1920. The press was purchased in 1939 by Kaunas-based publishing house . The company was nationalized in July 1940 by the newly established Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic. It was renamed to Švyturys (beacon) and transferred to the communist daily Tiesa in 1945. In 1989, during the rise of the independence movement, it restored its original name, Spindulys. Publications Title page of the first poetry collection by Adam Mickiewicz published in 1822 In the first three years, the press printed 27 books. In 1805–1838, under Józef Zawadzki, the press printed 851 books. Most of these books were in Latin and Polish, and only three in Lithuanian (including Lietuwiszkas ewangelias by financed by bishop ). In 1854–1864, the press published 596 books – 348 works in Polish, 107 in Latin, 105 in Lithuanian, 25 in Russian, and 11 in French and German. Among the Polish works, there were works by Adam Mickiewicz (including his first poetry book in 1822), Józef Ignacy Kraszewski, Henryk Sienkiewicz, Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz, Jan Śniadecki, Joachim Lelewel. Among the Lithuanian books, there were works by bishop Motiejus Valančius, Laurynas Ivinskis, Simonas Daukantas, Konstantinas Sirvydas. In 1852–1862, the press published approximately 65% of all Lithuanian books. During the Lithuanian press ban, the press managed to get three Lithuanian publications approved by Russian censors: 26,000 copies of two Catholic prayer books in 1879 and a petition by Donatas Malinauskas to allow Lithuanian-language services at the Church of St. Nicholas in Vilnius. In total, the press published about 700 Lithuanian books.

It includes North Wollongong Beach, the North Beach/Wollongong Bathing Pavilion, Puckey's Salt Works, the Tram Cutting, Battery Park and Smiths Hill. It was added to the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 17 June 2005.  History  =Early history= The earliest people to have enjoyed North Beach were the Aboriginals who inhabited the Illawarra district. The five tribes that lived in the region favoured the coast because of its abundant resources of food. Although relationships between the Aboriginal people and early European settlers were initially peaceable, by the 1830s they had deteriorated as a result of the Europeans' laying claim to land and clearing it. As a result, the Aboriginal population declined sharply - by 1846 it was reported there were less than one hundred indigenous people remaining. Descendants from this small proportion of survivors still live in the area.Howard, 2001 Although the existence of coal in the area was recognised by the end of the 1790s, the development of a coal industry had to wait for about fifty years, early forays into coal mining were to have an effect on the physical character of North Beach. The first but short-lived coal mine was opened up at Mount Keira in 1849 by James Shoobert. In 1857 a second and vastly more successful mine was opened, and in the following years mining began at Woonona, Bellambi, Coalcliff and Mount Pleasant. The Mount Pleasant Colliery began production in July 1861. The construction of a tramway that gave direct access to Wollongong harbour was a crucial element in the success of the mine, and it was decided to route it from the mine incline east to Fairy Creek and then into a reserve where it turned south and ran along the coast past North Beach and along the base of the cliff to Belmore Basin. It was built under the provisions of the Mount Pleasant Tramroads Act 1862 which enabled the Illawarra Coal Company, which owned the colliery, to construct the tramway through the coastal reserve. The tramway was to be open for public use on the payment of a toll and was opened for use in December 1862. It was upgraded in the early 1880s to accommodate locomotive haulage, and the company took delivery of its first locomotive in 1884.Rod Howard, 2001 Industry came briefly to North Beach the following decade when an English pharmacist, Courtney Puckey, established an experimental saltworks at the southern end of the beach adjacent to the railway cutting, which still forms a prominent landmark. The saltworks operated for about ten years from the middle of the 1890s onwards. Although short-lived and \\"commercially inconsequential\\" it is significant as the only Australian example of a \\"tea-tree framework\\" presently known to be recorded pictorially.Rogers, 1984, 70 During the 1920s Wollongong Council expressed some interest in the possibility of acquiring the land between Stuart Park and the Illawarra Coal Company's wharf, and requested meetings with the Company to discuss the issue. In April 1932 a meeting was held at the NSW Public Works Department in Sydney which included delegates from Wollongong Council to discuss the removal of the tramway from the foreshores, but apparently little or no action was forthcoming. The Mount Pleasant colliery closed in 1933 as a result of the Great Depression, and went into liquidation the following year. It was acquired by Broken Hill Proprietary in December 1936. In the meantime, Wollongong Council had been persistently \\"endeavouring to secure the removal of the Mt. Pleasant Railway Line and the conversion of the site of the line into a promenade...but with little success\\". Then, on 16 November 1937 representatives of Broken Hill Pty met with members of Council. They advised that the company had decided to abandon the Mt Pleasant and Mt Keira railways and donate the land to Council, and expressed the hope \\"that the company's action will be useful to the Council in clearing up and beautifying the foreshores of Wollongong\\". In 1938 the land was finally given to Wollongong Council. =A tradition of sea bathing= Early bathing facilities were established in Wollongong not long after its foundation. Bathing facilities for ladies and men were in place at Brighton Beach by 1839. In 1856 public baths were established at Flagstaff Hill and the following year the Brighton Hotel introduced bathing machines to improve its seaside amenity. Despite its apparent popularity, however, sea bathing was heavily proscribed. In 1870 it was forbidden to bathe between the hours of 8 a.m. and 7 p.m.. Furthermore, men and women were segregated and made to bathe at different locations. During the 1880s men bathed at Clarke's Hole and Gibson's Hole while women were confined to Flagstaff Point, but as the decade moved on restrictions eased a little, and sea bathing was only forbidden between the hours of 10 a.m. and 5 p.m. However, in 1888 it seems that crowds of recalcitrant men bathed from 3 p.m. onwards in defiance of the regulations, thus rendering the areas that they frequented unfit for the presence of women. Around the same time work began on upgrading the various bathing facilities in Wollongong, which at this period was frequently described as the \\"Brighton of NSW\\". In March 1894 the first moves towards organised beach activities came about with a meeting held at the Brighton Hotel to form a men's swimming club. This almost coincided with the first incursions into surf life saving in New South Wales when a member of the St George Swimming Club suggested that life saving classes be started up in 1893. After surf bathing hours were relaxed in 1902 there was a notable surge in the popularity of ocean bathing, but the dangers of the surf soon became very apparent. A public meeting was held in Wollongong Council Chambers on 11 January 1908 \\"for the purpose of forming a surf bathing and life saving club\\" with almost one hundred people in attendance. The mayor of Wollongong presided, and mentioned discussions that had taken place between a \\"visitor from Manly\\" and himself. The popularity of surf bathing, its attendant dangers and the necessity for a life saving club were raised. So were more some tangible benefits associated with the surf - \\"during the past four or five years the population of Manly, Bondi and other places had increased to a marvellous degree through surf bathing...surf bathing was not only a pleasant and healthy pastime, but was the means of bringing a large number of tourists to the town\\". As a result of the meeting the Wollongong Surf Bathing and Life Saving Club was formed, with the immediate enrollment of 57 members. It is indicative of the nature of the surf life saving movement at this time that the nascent club was offered support and encouragement from a number of clubs in Sydney, most scarcely a few years old themselves. At the club's first practice session, held on 19 January 1908, some 600 spectators looked on at the activities. This was an impressive figure given that the population of Wollongong was then just under 3,000, and indicates the amount of interest that with surf bathing held for the local populace. Though the Wollongong Surf Bathing and Life Saving Club was the first such organization to be formed in the Illawarra region, there were several others founded very shortly afterwards. For instance, the Helensburgh-Stanwell Park Life Saving and Surf Bathing Club commenced operating on 11 February 1908, Kiama Surf Bathers Club was founded on 14 March 1908 and a Club was established in Thirroul around August l908. In April 1908 a meeting was held concerning the erection of dressing sheds on North Beach. It was agreed that the Club and the Wollongong Municipal Council would raise a quarter of the required amount each while the balance would come from a pounds for pounds subsidy from the State Government. The Club set to work and staged fund raising activities such as dances, but it still took a year for it to accumulate the required sum of money. Still, by the end of 1909 a timber dressing shed for men was standing on what is now the site of the present North Beach Bathers' Pavilion and it was opened by the mayor at a surf carnival held on 30 November to celebrate the jubilee of the Municipality of Wollongong. Indeed, the Club was promoted as one of Wollongong's prime assets in a booklet that was published by the Council to promote the jubilee - \\"As a seaside resort Wollongong offers every attraction to the tourist. The surf bathing is of the best and is under the management of a most efficient club\\" - and a photograph of the new dressing shed took up an entire page. Should it be thought that the locals were demonstrating excessive pride in this matter, the Surf Bathing Association of NSW made it known that \\"accommodation provided at Wollongong for surf-bathing, thanks to an energetic Council and Life Saving Club, is probably the best on any of the beaches in the State, and in recognising the need for such, the Council have taken a step which could be followed with advantage by many other seaside municipal bodies\\". Public facilities were expanded shortly afterwards. On 2 December 1910 a special Sand and Sport Day was held to celebrate the completion of a dressing shed for women and a kiosk. This too was officially opened by the Mayor of Wollongong. The new dressing shed was located near Stuart Park while the kiosk, which was leased out, was located between it and the men's shed. Further improvements in the form of fencing and seats had also been constructed along the cliff above the beach. While the amenities for the public at North Beach may have been improving, the situation within the Wollongong Surf Bathing and Life Saving Club was certainly not. A group calling themselves the Water Rats, which took an intense interest in life saving, broke away from the Club in 1911. The Water Rats also began their operations on North Beach and friction between the two clubs inevitably developed because both wanted control of the beach. The Water Rats decided to change their name to the North Wollongong Surf Life Saving Club in September 1914. At a Mayoral conference held on 28 December 1914 attended by members of both clubs it was moved that a unified North Wollongong Surf Bathing and Life Saving Club be formed. This motion was carried unanimously, thus resolving the awkward situation. Over the next few years a number of improvements were carried out or proposed on and around North Beach. Extensions to both sheds so that children could be accommodated were made in 1912. A room for the Surf Club was built several years later. It was funded jointly by the Club, the Council, and also the North Wollongong Progress Association and was officially opened on 19 December 1917. A proposal for a lookout station on the beach was put forward in 1920, while the pleasures of a visit to the Beach were enhanced by the installation of a soda fountain in the kiosk. Wollongong Municipal Council maintained its involvement in the running of North Beach by employing a lifesaver in November 1921. It handed over control to the tenant of the Kiosk in the second half of 1922 and the tenant ended up employing the lifesaver and attending to the dressing sheds. The site has been used for major surf life saving events throughout the twentieth century. The first annual combined surf carnival, organised by the South Coast Surf Lifesaving Association (founded in 1917), was held at North Beach during March 1922. The first State Championship Carnival staged by a country branch of the Surf Life Saving Association in NSW was held there during the 1949-50 season and then the Australian Championships in March 1952. From the 1970s particular groups of youth subculture such as \\"surfers\\" and \\"revheads\\" have used this area extensively, adding more informal and unofficial usages and meanings. The beach and its associated buildings have been increasingly important also to older Australians, offering sites for gatherings of informal groups of friends and relatives, often made up of retired people from nearby suburbs. =North Beach Bathing Pavilion and Kiosk= It would appear that around the year 1924 proposals were put forward for the replacement of the dressing sheds with a new pavilion, and repairs were carried out on the sheds pending the construction of the new building the following year. This did not in fact eventuate, but the Surf Club gained some additional space when Council gave it at least a part of the boys' dressing shed towards the end of 1929, owing to the destructive activities of recalcitrant children towards the shed. However, the issue of replacing the dressing sheds did not go away. Wollongong Council's Parks and Baths Committee received correspondence at the beginning of 1931 raising the matter. Its response, given the economic depression of the period, was understandably negative - \\"[t]he matter of drainage and the erection of new surf sheds will be dealt with in any beach improvement scheme to be considered, but the costs of the work are too great for immediate action\\". At the end of May 1935 Council's Parks and Gardens Committee received a deputation from the Surf Club to discuss proposed improvements to North Beach. The Club submitted two proposals, one for a new clubhouse and the other for a \\"club house and public dressing sheds with kiosk combined\\". The Club was seeking guidance from Council as to whether it could proceed with either of the schemes and also some assistance in obtaining funding from the state government's Unemployed Relief Council to cover the cost of building. The Club had already managed to raise £800. The Council, however, did not commit itself. The Club approached Council again the following June in an effort to arrange a meeting to discuss the proposals. The Parks and Gardens Committee did meet with representatives of the South Beach Surf Club place in the first half of July, at which a proposal for new facilities for that beach were favourably received. At the same time the committee \\"proposed\\" to meet with North Beach \\"with a view of arriving at a definite proposal also from this body\\". At the end of August representatives of the Council and the two Surf Clubs met with the Minister for Local Government, Mr Spooner, to discuss loan funding for \\"surfing\\" accommodation at North and South Beaches. The Minister visited Bulli Shire and Wollongong on 28 September 1935 and announced that the sum of £8,750 was to be made available for dressing sheds at South Wollongong Beach and a club house at North Beach. This enabled the North Beach Surf Club to build a new clubhouse. Tenders were called for the clubhouse and were opened at the end of October 1935. The foundation stone for the building was laid by the Mayor of Wollongong on 25 January 1936 and it was officially opened by Adrian Curlewis, President of the Surf Life Saving Association of Australia on 2 May 1936. The clubhouse was designed by J. Hugh Britten, who had also prepared the earlier, unsuccessful scheme that included dressing accommodation and the kiosk. In August 1936 Council's Parks and Gardens Committee recommended demolition of the old surf pavilion and recycling the timber from it to repair other buildings at North Beach. While the old dressing sheds and kiosk continued in use, there were now some pressing problems associated with them, not the least of which was that the Surf Club 'was unable to use its balcony at present owing to its overlooking the lady's dressing sheds'. However, it was going to take a little more time for new facilities to eventuate, despite Council having List of mayors and lord mayors of Wollongong7,000 in funds ready to build new dressing sheds in November 1936. One of the aldermen, with an eye to economy, suggested that surfers using the beach preferred \\"an open shed as at present with perhaps a brick wall\\". Once again, the Club submitted plans describing the layout of new facilities to Council for its consideration early in 1937. A Council committee visited North Beach on 27 February 1937 and held discussions with members of the Club and the caretaker about these improvements. It was resolved that members of the committee, that is the Health Inspector and Engineer, inspect facilities on some of the \\"more important surf beaches in the Metropolitan area\\" on 13 March following. The result of this was that at the beginning of April a recommendation was made to Council that the pair be requested to prepare a scheme for new facilities. The Health Inspector duly prepared a scheme and at the end of May was instructed to work in collaboration with Council's Engineer and architect Hugh Britten on the final documentation for dressing sheds and a kiosk. What eventuated was two schemes prepared by Hugh Britten. One consisted of three separate pavilions, while the other combined all of the facilities into one building. Council moved to accept the second proposal at its meeting on 15 July 1937. But it was far from over. It appears that the Surf Club had problems with the proposal because of privacy issues relating to the dressing sheds and the location of the kiosk. Despite a special meeting held shortly afterwards, the design of the new dressing sheds and kiosk remained unresolved for some months. The Club requested a meeting with Council to reopen discussions at the end of July, but in the middle of October Council was still deferring consideration of the dressing sheds and kiosk. At the end of the year there was some discourse within Council concerning the possibility of holding a competition for the beautification of the oceanfront extending from the northern to the southern end of its eastern boundary. This included North Beach. Notwithstanding all this, Council directed Harvey B. Gale, Council's long serving Health Inspector, to prepare documentation for dressing accommodation and a kiosk and residence at the end of December 1937 and in the second half of January 1938 Gale was able to submit plans for approval. Accordingly, Council requested completion of the documentation and tenders for the construction of the buildings were invited at the beginning of February. Five tenders were received by the beginning of March, including one from J. H. Britten. It was the lowest tender and duly accepted. However, this decision was rescinded about two weeks later and fresh tenders were called. That of W. J. Anderson was accepted around 21 April. At last, construction could begin. The new dressing pavilion, designed to accommodate the needs of 2,000 persons, and the nearby refreshment kiosk were opened on 12 November 1938 in front of several hundred spectators by the Minister for Works and Local Government, Eric Spooner. The new buildings were described fulsomely in the Illawarra Mercury: :'The modern design of the new buildings adds a distinct beauty to the beach and the composite picture is one that would be hard to equal in Australia...The dressing pavilion is 250 feet [76.2 metres] in length, and 34 feet [10.36 metres] wide. It is set at the base of a grass covered cliff amongst terraced lawns. The bricks are a warm red on a cream facing, and the design is unique. Sweeping lines enhanced by a cloister effect along the front elevation of the building are the outstanding features. Fibro cement screens surmounting the walls of the building give an extremely modernistic tone. The rear of the building has a different treatment and is equally simple and effective. :'Designed to give the maximum of light and sunshine, the interior of the building is attractive. Both the men and women's sections are spacious and open. The women's section has 34 cubicles in addition to the usual facilities. In both places mirrors and washbasins are provided. A block of four showers in each section has an unusual feature. The flooring in each shower block has been built of brick which have a non- slippery surface and are porous. A great deal of attention has been paid to the drainage, which is carried well away from the beach. There are ten modem tiled lavatories in the building. :'The design and supervision was carried out by Mr H Gale, chief inspector for the Wollongong Council. He said the designs were his original designs and they were to give the minimum service with the maximum sunlight and fresh air. . . '(52) A number of extra items were included during construction, including plumbing for hot water and the construction of additional brickwork, screens and lattice to prevent the public seeing into the dressing areas from the cliffs behind the building. However, the Kiosk, if not the Bathing Pavilion, was suffering from a number of aggravating problems less than ten years after it was built. In 1946 it was reported that the roof was leaking, causing stains on the ceilings of the kitchen, laundry and shop, while termites were infesting floor joists, skirting boards and doors. The two buildings formed an important adjunct to a major event during the 1949-50 season when the Illawarra Branch of the Surf Life Saving Association of Australia and North Wollongong Surf Life Saving Club hosted the first State Championship Carnival to be staged by a country branch of the Surf Life Saving Association in New South Wales. This necessitated the destruction of trees and bulldozing part of the beach to form a car park. The two organizations then went on to conduct the Australian Championships at North Beach in March 1952. The Bathing Pavilion and Kiosk enjoyed a close association with the North Wollongong Surf Life Saving Club in the post war years because of leasing arrangements with the Council. At this time a number of lessees had direct associations with the Surf Club because of their membership, and their wives would manage the Kiosk while they would look after the Pavilion. The lessee's duties included supervision, control and guarding the beach and its buildings (other than the surf club) and keeping the beach, reserve and Bathing Pavilion clean. One of the lease conditions specified that the interior and the exterior of the Kiosk were to be painted at least once during the term of the lease. At least two modifications to the Kiosk were documented at this time - the timber lattice screen and gate enclosing the porch on the western side of the building and fencing on its northern side were in place before the end of 1955. The most substantial alterations to the Bathing Pavilion for which documentation exists took place at the end of the 1960s. They comprised replacement of the seating within the dressing sheds and reduction in the number of benches, construction of solid masonry partitions between toilet cubicles in the male dressing area and replacement of early stairs on the eastern side of the building with new flights of concrete stairs. New concrete floor slabs were documented for the dressing areas as well Such expenditure indicated that the Pavilion was still well patronised, perhaps not surprising given that North Beach was reputedly the most popular beach on the Illawarra coastline. Several years later, documentation for the replacement of a large section of concrete floor slab in the central section of the Bathing Pavilion was prepared during l976. The Surf Club reinstated its role in the management of the Kiosk when it purchased the lease of the Kiosk in 1980 (or 1981), but sold it two years later after being unable to make a profit. The special character of North Beach was brought to the attention of a national audience in 1983 with the publication of an article on Wollongong's interwar architecture in the journal Heritage Australia: :'Where once upon a time a railway line ran along North Wollongong Beach to the boat harbour, now pedestrians stroll past pavilions, dressing sheds and Continental Baths built in the interwar years. Just past the paths are the North Wollongong dressing pavilion and the Surf Life Saving Club's premises. Together these buildings, with their spectacular ocean setting, make an architectural and aesthetic precinct of considerable grace. Permanent conservation orders should be placed on all the items in this pedestrian precinct' (61). Ironically, it was during this decade that a threat to the buildings emerged with the construction of the North Beach International Business and Leisure Resort, which opened in December 1982. After the building changed hands in 1987 its new owners called for the demolition of the Bathing Pavilion, provoking a defensive reaction amongst some sections of the community. In July 1989 Council decided to seek expressions of interest for the renovation of the Bathing Pavilion, adapting it into multi-use facility incorporating a cafe or kiosk, a shop and new changing facilities. The following April North Beach was the centre of national attention when it set the scene once again for the Australian Surf Life Saving Championships. In 1993 Council received two expressions of interest for the reuse of the Pavilion. The proposals were both for restaurants. One was received from the local cafe proprietor and ex-footballer Michael Bolt, while the other came from the Queensland based Alben Holdings Pty Ltd restaurant chain. The proposal put forward by the chain, the design of which was prepared by the architectural firm of Jones Brewster Regan, described modifications to the building that would have altered its appearance and character - new roofs over much of the dressing areas, new stairs on the eastern side of the building and removal of portions of the eastern walls enclosing the dressing areas to open up views across the beach. Council approved the application on 24 May 1993. However, the approval met with opposition from members of the community, the other applicant and the South Coast Labour Council, which quickly imposed a black ban on the redevelopment of the site. Council conducted a community survey in the second half of 1993 which apparently favoured the proposed development but the union ban remained firmly in place. In 1995 the Surf Club put forward its own proposal, which was to turn the building into a cultural and community centre and the following year the Pukapuka Cook Island Community Group submitted an expression of interest for a cultural centre that was rejected by the city's Lord Mayor, David Campbell (68). The pavilion closed for refurbishment in 2011 and reopened in 2012, having been restored with the addition of a cafe, a new pedestrian promenade and the replacement of the seawall. Remains of the former saltworks were uncovered during the restoration works. In 2018, the building houses the Northbeach Pavilion Pizza Restaurant, Bar and Kiosk. =The Architecture of Beach Pavilions= The interwar period was significant in that it witnessed the construction of architecturally considered surf and bathing pavilions along the coast of New South Wales. This reflected the important place that recreation on the beach held for many people across the country during the interwar period: 'Surfing and sunbaking...were almost obligatory for young people on the coast...Bondi was a national symbol; in Perth Cottesloe proclaimed itself \\"the Bondi of the West\\". On weekends and public holidays people flocked to the beaches to anoint their bodies and be immersed, the newspapers duly estimating the size of the crowds attending each resort'. The importance of beaches in the life of Australians was noted by overseas commentators as well. For instance, both life on the beaches and the exceptional activities of the surf lifesaving movement were brought to the attention of American readers in an article on Australia's capital cities appearing in National Geographic magazine for December 1935. Apart from the convenience and amenity that they furnished, one important reason for the construction of a number of pavilions during the 1930s was the provision of much needed work for the unemployed, and many were funded out of the state government's Unemployment Relief Council. A large number of bathing pavilions and surf clubhouses were built along the coastline of New South Wales. They were new building types that appear to have reached a definitive form by the end of the 1920s. Wollongong certainly appears to have established a respectable tradition of beach related architecture during the interwar period, much of which has been lost. Demolished buildings include the Continental Baths Pavilion and Baths, which were operating at the end of 1925 and officially opened by the Mayor on 6 March 1926, Woonona Baths Pavilion (1928), and the Austinmer Bathing Pavilion, promenade and Surf Club (1930). The buildings at North Beach were relatively late additions to the genre as was the South Beach Pavilion which was opened on 9 October 1936. This building was designed by C. D. Leake and consisted of a central two storey pavilion flanked on either side by attached wings housing men and women's dressing areas. The central pavilion included a kiosk, ladies' club room, residence for the kiosk lessee and an assembly hall for the surf club. The South Beach pavilion was demolished between in the 2000s. Another extant beach pavilion from the interwar period is located at Thirroul. It was officially opened by Eric Spooner on 20 January 1940. It consists of a central single storey pavilion containing a kiosk and residence. The eastern facade of the pavilion has a simple though effective Art Deco character, and is flanked on each side by attached male and female dressing pavilions. The surf clubhouse is a separate building located to the immediate north of the complex. An olympic sized swimming pool was also built as part of the complex, which was funded by the state government on a pound for pound basis (74). The other pavilions and clubhouses located along Wollongong's northern beaches are all relatively recent structures. There were a number of surf pavilions erected at the beaches included in Sydney's metropolitan area. Perhaps the most grand and elaborate of all was built at Bondi Beach, the Bondi Pavilion. Designed by the influential architectural firm of Robertson and Marks, it was designed to accommodate the extraordinary number of 12,000 visitors and opened in 1930. Numerous facilities were provided within one large building. The ground floor contained dressing areas, shops, Turkish baths, a gymnasium, auditorium and the manager's residence, while a ballroom, dining rooms and office space were located on the first floor. At the opposite end of the 1930s the Manly Surf pavilion (completed in 1938) represented the acme of functional architectural modernism. This building, shaped like a boomerang in plan, combined dressing areas over which sun bathing decks were located and quarters for the surf club. The building won the Sir John Sulman Medal for 1939, partly for its harmonious relationship with its setting. It has since been demolished. The Cronulla Beach Surf Pavilion is another notable building, and was completed during 1940. It was designed by architect A. B. Polin in a rather severe Interwar Stripped Classical style. Here men's and women's dressing areas were separated by a central two storey pavilion - 'In the men's section there is cubicle accommodation encircling a large area, while the centre is taken up by blocks of lockers under hoods of curved corrugated asbestos cement roofing. The floor here is of the orthodox batten type...In the ladies' section accommodation is on similar lines with more cubicles. These are arranged in two tiers, the upper ones being approached from the sun-baking area on the upper level\\". An adjacent surf clubhouse was completed at the same time. Few interwar pavilions remain on Sydney's northern beaches. There is an lnterwar Mediterranean style pavilion containing dressing and surf club accommodation at Newport Beach. It was opened by the Minister of Labour and Industry, John Dunningham, on 30 September l933. The pavilion at Freshwater Beach is also a Mediterranean style building and was designed by club member Lindsay Scott. It was opened by Eric Spooner on 8 September 1935. Scott held the positions of vice president and honorary architect to the Surf Life Saving Association during the 1930s and also designed surf pavilions for Palm Beach, South Curl Curl and Harbord beaches. Palm Beach is also graced by a fine Interwar Functionalist dressing pavilion that was constructed around 1936. Although its designer has not been ascertained, this may be the building designed by Scott. The pavilion contains a central circulation space with changing spaces on either side. Some fine surf pavilions were erected in Newcastle. Nobby's Beach Surf Pavilion was designed by the City Architect F. A. Scorer and opened on 1 December 1934. It was designed as a central pavilion with attached flanking dressing sheds in the Interwar Mediterranean style. Bar Beach Surf Pavilion was designed by architects A. J. Brown and S. F. Coleman in association with Newcastle architects F. O. and A. C. Castleden. It was completed in 1933 and was considered to have no equals in the district and to be comparable to any in Sydney. The building contained facilities for the surf club, a refreshment kiosk, an office, lavatories, the caretaker's residence, sunbathing accommodation, and changing areas - 500 lockers and 50 cubicles were provided for men and 100 lockers and 250 cubicles for women. The exterior of the building was designed in an idiom that combined the Interwar Spanish Mission and Art Deco styles. The Merewether Surf Pavilion was completed in 1937. It was designed by the architectural firm of Pitt and Merewether in a restrained Art Deco idiom and consisted of a central two storey pavilion containing a caretaker's flat and surf club room on the first floor, flanked on either side by attached dressing pavilions. The building was officially opened by Eric Spooner. Distinctive pavilions were also erected in other parts of the state. For instance, an elegant Georgian Revival building consisting of a high central pavilion flanked by lower attached pavilions was erected at Forster. Other Interwar beach pavilions still exist within the Illawarra Region. They include the 1940 beach pavilion and surf life saving club at Thirroul.  Description  The Bathing Pavilion and Kiosk form an important part of the environs of North Beach. The buildings do much to define the visual character of the beach and regulate the movement of pedestrian and bicycle movement along this section of coast. From a distance the bathing pavilion in particular is visible as a prominent landmark against the cliff that rises behind it. Both buildings are related visually to the Surf Club to the north because of a shared architectural aesthetic. The grassed and paved open space that extends from the Bathing Pavilion to the Surf Club and in front of the kiosk plays an integral role in the recreational uses of North Beach. Both the North Beach Bathing Pavilion and the Kiosk are examples of what has become known as the Interwar Functionalist style. This style minored the infiltration of aspects of European modem architecture of the 1920s and 1930s into the local architectural mainstream. It became relatively prevalent from 1936 onwards and still remained popular during the post war era. Characteristics of the style, a number of which are evident in these two buildings, include simple geometric shapes, light toned colours, contrasting horizontal and vertical motifs, large areas of glazing and bands of windows, plain surfaces in cement render or face brick and flat or pitched roofs concealed behind high parapets. Lettering was often integrated into the design of buildings. The Interwar Functionalist style is quite common in Wollongong, and numerous examples of a variety of building types demonstrating its characteristics have survived down to the present day (3). =North Beach Bathing Pavilion= The North Beach Bathing Pavilion is a long single storey building consisting of a central pavilion with high parapets on the eastern and western sides concealing a pitched roof. It is flanked on each side by large dressing areas that are mostly open to the sky. The male dressing area, on the southern side, is longer than the female dressing area on the north. The building sits on a base of dark brick while the remainder is constructed of light toned brick Tall semi circular parapets enclose the ends of the dressing areas and are covered with cement render over their external faces. The floor of the building consists of a suspended concrete slab supported by load bearing brick walls and brick piers. Roofing consists of corrugated asbestos cement sheeting which is deteriorating, especially above the dressing areas which are only roofed along their western sides. It has been observed that sea water has entered at the base of the Bathing Pavilion during severe storms. Although flooding of the building has not taken place, the roller door on the eastern side of the building has been damaged. It would appear that this is the only storm-related problem to have affected the building However, the condition of some brick surfaces and metal items reflects the harsh conditions to which the building is subjected. The report, Preliminary Structural Investigation North Beach Pavilion Wollongong, dated June 1995, was prepared by McMillan Britton & Kell Pty Limited. It concluded that brick and concrete damage was superficial in nature and that minor differential foundation movement has caused moderate cracking in brickwork in some locations. Other cracking has taken place as a result of expansion due to corrosion of ferrous fixings. ;Pavilion Exterior The Bathing Pavilion as built differs in some respects from the early documentation held at Wollongong Council. The principal differences include the arches along the eastern side of the base of the building, which repeat at regular intervals rather than being grouped in threes as shown on the drawings. The opening below the male dressing area near the central pavilion, designated for surf canoes was never built, and the walls around the dressing areas are higher than documented, particularly at the northern and southern ends, to overcome privacy problems that became evident during construction. Alterations to the exterior of the building include the following: the concrete stairs on the eastern side of the building, bricking up of the openings behind the arches along the base of the building; insertion of a roller shutter in an enlarged opening to the early female toilets that were accessible from the pathway on the western side of the building and bricking up of the equivalent opening to male toilets. The flagpoles have been removed from the western facade, but appear to have been placed on the roof of the building. A clock was installed on the eastern facade, and reference to a photograph published in 1977 suggests that the clock appeared during or after that year. All of the doors have removed from the main eastern and western entrances. The cement rendered architraves around the high window opens above and beside the main western entrance are badly stained as a result of corrosion of metal elements within the openings. The external appearance of the Bathing Pavilion is very much the same as it was in 1938, although the area between it and the Kiosk has been modified. The terraces visible in early photographs of the precinct have been replaced by a crib block retaining wall . . . The main western entrance has been subjected to modification, most particularly by the removal of flag poles and lettering from the parapet and the enlargement of the opening to the former female toilets on the western side. Corrosion of metal grilled over window openings is staining the rendered sills. The main entrance has also been the subject of modification, which includes the installation of a clock within the parapet, replacement of timber stairs with concrete stairs and the introduction of intrusive security gates across the opening beneath the stair landing. ;Pavilion Interior The original plan of the building is still very much in evidence and is very much the same as shown on the early documents. However, the interior of the building has been modified to some extent, most notably during the late 1960s and 1970s. Then seating and joinery in the dressing areas was replaced, masonry toilet cubicles in the male dressing rooms were constructed and new concrete floor slabs documented (and presumably laid). Other alterations include bricking up of counter openings in the western walls of the former northern and southern attendant's offices, along with the high openings above these spaces. A door opening has been cut into what was formerly the externally accessed male toilet from within the southern passage. Showers located in the dressing areas have been retiled, while the seats have been largely removed from the male dressing area. The female dressing area has, by contrast, retained a large number of joinery items including a series of cubicles located against the western wall which appear to be early, if not original. The basic layout of the Bathing Pavilion remains unaltered, although the function of some spaces has changed. This has meant that some early openings have been filled in, most notably in walls associated with the early attendant's rooms on the eastern side of the pavilion. =North Beach Kiosk= The Kiosk, like the Bathers' Pavilion, has retained much of its original external form and internal layout. However, its fabric is deteriorating in places. ;Kiosk Exterior Alterations to the exterior of the Kiosk, or elements that were modified from the original documentation during construction, include the following items. Minor modifications were made to the parapet, most particularly at the southern end of the building around the flagpole. Photographic evidence indicates that this took place while the building was under construction. Installation of a timber screen and gate enclosing the porch on the western side of the building was carried out prior to the end of 1955. A garage has been constructed on the eastern side of the building, although the date that this took place has not been ascertained. The eastern wall of the garage serves as a showering area for those using the beach. The window to the Kitchen consists of double hung sashes on either side of a wide fixed pane, whereas the original drawings show a pair of double hung sashes separated by an area of brickwork, and an early photograph of the building confirms that the original configuration has been altered. Another modification to windows consists of tiling that has been laid on the sills of the windows illuminating the shop area. The rainwater head on the eastern side of the building has also been replaced, perhaps reflecting the repairs of which the roof of the building has been subjected in the past. Fabric on the exterior of the building is deteriorating in places. This is most evident in the arch bars over windows along the northern wall which are corroding and the rather crude repointing of brickwork on the northern side of the building. The exterior of the kiosk is essentially the same as documented in 1938. Apart from detail modifications that were made during construction, the major external modifications since that time have been the addition of the garage and the enlargement of the window of the kitchen area. The northern side of the Kiosk shows most evidence of deterioration. The brickwork has been repointed in recent times in a poor fashion. Mortar has been left on many bricks. Steel lintels are also corroding and sagging above window and door openings and require urgent attention. Some intrusive and ugly items have been added to the western side of the Kiosk, including a sign, the deteriorating lattice screen across the porch, a storage tank, electrical meter board and electrical conduits. ;Kiosk Interior Alterations to the interior of the Kiosk, or elements that were modified from the original documentation during construction, include the following items. The shop area within the Kiosk has been modified and now contains two separate sections, a sales area and a food preparation area. The counter shown on the original documents has been removed, as has the western column within the space. The floor of the space has been tiled relatively recently and a new counter has been installed. However, early finishes such as the textured render on walls and piers and the ceiling lining and cavetto profile cornices, are still in place. Room 1, designed as a store, now serves the function of a scullery. The floor has been tiled relatively recently, and shelving and a stainless steel sink have been installed. The wall surface below the southern window is deteriorating. Room 2 was originally designated as a kitchen attached to the Kiosk. The opening in the southern wall between it and the kiosk has been altered and a domestic kitchen has been installed within the southern part of the room. The room has retained early cornices and ceiling linings, but the floor is covered with cork tiles that were probably laid at the same time as the kitchen joinery, around 1980. Sliding doors have been installed on the openings leading to Rooms I and 3; the original drawings do not indicate that these openings were originally fitted with door leaves. Room 3 was originally designated a dining room. Its early fabric is generally intact. A door has been fitted into the opening in the northern wall leading into the hallway; the original drawings do not indicate that this opening was originally fitted with a door leaf. Room 4 was originally designated a bedroom. Its early fabric is generally intact. However, the ceiling and cornices have been damaged in the north western corner of the room and are deteriorating. There is also a severe crack in the wall surface above the northern side of the doorway. A large wardrobe has been installed in relatively recent times. The floor is covered with carpet. Room 5 was also designated a bedroom, and its early fabric is generally intact. It is the only room in the building, apart from the hallway, to have a picture rail around its walls. The floor is covered with carpet. Room 6 was originally designated Hot Water. It appears relatively unaltered, and currently serves as a store room. Room 7 still retains its original function, that of Laundry and Bathroom. Original wall tiling and ceiling linings survive. The original window on the eastern wall has also survived, but opens into the garage.  Heritage listing  The North Beach Precinct, Wollongong is of State significance for demonstrating the recreational role played by surfing and beach culture during the twentieth century in coastal NSW in conjunction with important remnants of the industrial heritage of Wollongong. The North Beach Bathing Pavilion and Kiosk, Wollongong are good and relatively intact examples of the Interwar Functionalist style of architecture. The Bathing Pavilion and Kiosk have a strong aesthetic relationship to each other, as well as to the greatly altered Surf Life Saving Club, also dating from the 1930s. The tramway cutting is a significant reminder of the days when coal was transported from Mount Pleasant through North Beach to Wollongong Harbour, while the archaeological site of Puckey's Salt Works offers research potential concerning the history of salt manufacture in NSW. Comparison with other beach architecture built during the 1930s in New South Wales indicates that this architectural style is rare in this genre, that separating the functions of pavilion / kiosk / and Surf Life Saving Club into separate buildings is a rare arrangement of beach architecture and that intact Interwar seaside architecture is increasingly rare in NSW. The buildings have research potential of State significance for demonstrating aspects of the management and social uses of beaches in New South Wales throughout the twentieth century. The Surf Life Saving Club is sited on a separate title of land and this SHR listing may be later expanded to include the building because of its strong historical and geographical associations with the group; however the extent of its renovations requires further investigation. It is rare to find this conjunction of seaside architecture and industrial remnants / archaeology in such close proximity. The site is also of high local significance for its landmark Interwar seaside buildings within the Illawarra region and for the historical, cultural and social associations of the place within the Wollongong community. North Beach Precinct was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 17 June 2005 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. The North Beach Precinct is of State significance firstly for its remnants of the industrial heritage of Wollongong. The curtilage includes the tramway cutting used to transport coal to Wollongong Harbour from the Mount Pleasant mine (1861-1933) and the archaeological site of Puckey's Salt Works (1895-1905). Secondly the site is of State significance for demonstrating the recreational role played by surfing and beach culture during the twentieth century for people in coastal NSW. Robert Irving states: \\"The Pavilion . . . is a marvellous monument to the enthusiasm with which Wollongong people have devoted themselves to the pleasures of the beach.\\" The beach buildings also provide historical evidence of the State Government's provision of capital for the construction of public facilities during the Great Depression and of Wollongong City Council's long- term role in providing recreational amenities for its citizens. The site is also associated with national surf life saving events. The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The North Beach Bathing Pavilion, Kiosk and Surf Life Saving Club (SLSC) are of high local significance for their association with the North Wollongong Surf Bathing and Life Saving Club, which lobbied for their construction throughout the 1930s. This was the first surf life saving club to be formed in the region, and the building is still used by life savers to patrol the beach. The buildings have strong associations with Wollongong City Council because of its role in documenting, constructing and managing them, and particular associations with Council's Architect, J Hugh Britten who designed the SLSC in 1936 and Council's Health Inspector Harvey Ennis Gale who designed the Bathing Pavilion and Kiosk buildings in 1938. The archaeological site of Puckey's Salt Works also has high local significance for its association with Courtenay Puckey, a prominent local pharmacist and businessman. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The North Beach Bathing Pavilion and Kiosk, Wollongong are of State significance as good and relatively intact examples of the Interwar Functionalist style of architecture. The Bathing Pavilion and Kiosk have a strong aesthetic relationship to each other, as well as to the greatly altered Surf Life Saving Club also dating from the 1930s. As a group the three buildings constitute a visual presence integral to the character of North Beach. Auchmuty and Spearritt state that \\"these buildings, with their spectacular ocean setting, make an architectural and aesthetic precinct of considerable grace\\". Robert Irving states: 'The Pavilion . . . in one of Wollongong's most favoured locations, is possibly Wollongong's most recognisable place.. Visually it certainly captures the culture of the surf bathing scene'. The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The North Beach Precinct is of high local significance because of the esteem in which the buildings are held within the community, evidenced by the public debates that have surrounded proposals for their adaptive reuse since the end of the l980s. The Bathing Pavilion has an ongoing association with the Surf Club because it is used by life savers as a convenient location to watch over the beach, thus ensuring the safety of the public who bathe there. From the 1970s particular groups of youth subculture such as \\"surfers\\" and \\"revheads\\" have used this area extensively, adding more informal and unofficial usages and meanings. The beach and its associated buildings have been increasingly important also to older Australians, offering sites for gatherings of informal groups of friends and relatives, often made up of retired people from nearby suburbs.Eklund, 2005 The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The North Beach Precinct, Wollongong has research potential of State significance for demonstrating aspects of the management and social uses of beaches in New South Wales throughout the twentieth century. The archeological site of Puckey's Salt Works offers research potential concerning the history of salt manufacture in NSW. Although 'short-lived and \\"commercially inconsequential\\" it is significant as the only Australian example of a \\"tea-tree framework\\" ...presently known to be recorded pictorially'. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. The North Beach Precinct, Wollongong is of State significance as a rare and relatively intact grouping of Interwar beach architecture in NSW. Comparison with other beach architecture built during the 1930s in New South Wales indicates that this architectural style is rare in this genre, that separating the functions of pavilion / kiosk / and Surf Life Saving Club into separate buildings is a rare arrangement of beach architecture and that intact Interwar seaside architecture is increasingly rare in NSW. It is also rare to find this conjunction of seaside architecture and industrial remnants and archaeology in such close proximity. The place is important in demonstrating the principal characteristics of a class of cultural or natural places/environments in New South Wales. The North Beach Precinct, Wollongong is of State significance because of the relatively intact condition and configuration of the Bathing Pavilion and the Kioskand because of their siting in proximity to North Beach and the Surf Club building. They demonstrate the principal characteristics of a class of cultural environment - the leisure environment associated with beach activity since the 1930s.

Moon was accompanied by Suh Hoon, Director of the National Intelligence Service of South Korea, while Kim was joined by Kim Yong-chol, a former military intelligence chief who is now a vice chairman of the North Korean ruling party's central committee tasked with inter-Korean relations. The meeting was largely centered around North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's upcoming summit with US President Donald Trump. Kim and Moon also embraced before Moon returned to South Korea. On 27 May, Moon stated in a public address that he and Kim agreed to meet again at \\"anytime and anyplace\\" without any formality and that the North Korean leader once again pledged to denuclearize the Korean Peninsula in accordance with the Panmunjom Declaration. Agenda Moon and Kim talking at the summit The two leaders of North and South Koreas exchanged their opinions about the issues and solutions for the Trump–Kim summit, as Trump abruptly cancelled the upcoming US–North Korea summit on 12 June. The principal agenda of the meeting was trying to get the US summit back on track and keep progressing the denuclearization talks. Meeting The second 2018 summit was established by Kim Jong-un's suggestion within a whirlwind 24 hour notice, but Moon Jae-in accepted Kim's invitation as per the critical nuclear agenda between North and South Korea. Moon had expressed his belief, and he discussed with Kim Jong-un about Kim's willingness to join nuclear interventions with Trump. Moon and Kim agreed to also convene inter-Korean high-level talks on 1 June, to be followed by talks between military authorities to ease military tensions and Red Cross talks for the reunion of separated families. Both leaders also agreed to accelerate the implementation of the Panmunjom Declaration and meet again at \\"anytime and anyplace\\" without formality. Aftermath During the 1 June meeting, officials from both countries agreed to move forward with the military and Red Cross talks. Both Koreas also agreed to reopen a liaison office located within a factory park in Kaesong which had been jointly operated by the countries as an economic zone until the South shut it down in February 2016 after a North Korean nuclear test. The first talks involving the Red Cross and military were then held at North Korea's Mount Kumgang resort on 22 June 2018 and during the talks, it was agreed that family reunions which had been cancelled in 2015 would resume between 20 and 26 August 2018.

It is situated in the Stephen Mather Wilderness on a ridge which also has Switchblade Peak and Jackknife Peak to its east. Stiletto Peak is also located on the border of North Cascades National Park. Precipitation runoff on the north side of the mountain drains into Bridge Creek via Copper Creek, whereas the south side of the mountain drains into the East Fork Bridge Creek. Climate Most weather fronts originate in the Pacific Ocean, and travel northeast toward the Cascade Mountains. As fronts approach the North Cascades, they are forced upward by the peaks of the Cascade Range, causing them to drop their moisture in the form of rain or snowfall onto the Cascades. As a result, the west side of the North Cascades experiences high precipitation, especially during the winter months in the form of snowfall. During winter months, weather is usually cloudy, but, due to high pressure systems over the Pacific Ocean that intensify during summer months, there is often little or no cloud cover during the summer.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Because of maritime influence, snow tends to be wet and heavy, resulting in high avalanche danger.Beckey, Fred W. Cascade Alpine Guide, Climbing and High Routes. Seattle, WA: Mountaineers Books, 2008. Geology The North Cascades features some of the most rugged topography in the Cascade Range with craggy peaks, ridges, and deep glacial valleys. Geological events occurring many years ago created the diverse topography and drastic elevation changes over the Cascade Range leading to the various climate differences. These climate differences lead to vegetation variety defining the ecoregions in this area. Switchblade and Stiletto peaks seen from Wallaby Peak The history of the formation of the Cascade Mountains dates back millions of years ago to the late Eocene Epoch. With the North American Plate overriding the Pacific Plate, episodes of volcanic igneous activity persisted. In addition, small fragments of the oceanic and continental lithosphere called terranes created the North Cascades about 50 million years ago. During the Pleistocene period dating back over two million years ago, glaciation advancing and retreating repeatedly scoured the landscape leaving deposits of rock debris. The “U”-shaped cross section of the river valleys are a result of recent glaciation. Uplift and faulting in combination with glaciation have been the dominant processes which have created the tall peaks and deep valleys of the North Cascades.

Post-war, he garnered the respect of colleagues in his respective fields of endeavor, particularly so for his body of work which documented Pennsylvania's history from its founding through the late 19th century – excerpts of which continued to be reprinted in newspapers following his death in 1901 and are still cited as references by present-day historians and professional genealogists. His passing was \\"deeply mourned\\" by many, according to historian Luther Reily Kelker, who said of Egle, \\"few brighter, nobler types of manhood have ever adorned the generations of men in the Keystone State.\\"Kelker, History of Dauphin County: Genealogical Memoirs.  Formative years  Born in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania on September 17, 1830, William Henry Egle was a son of Pennsylvania natives John Egle (1798–1834) and Elizabeth (von Treupel) Egle (1810–1841). Reared in Dauphin County, Pennsylvania, he was compelled to relocate to the home of his paternal grandmother in 1834, following the sudden death of his father. Educated initially in the county's public schools, he then spent two years at the Harrisburg Military Institute.Egle, William Henry. \\"The Family of Egle\\", in Pennsylvania: Genealogies Chiefly Scotch-Irish and German, pp. 166–167.

Egle, in U.S. Census (Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, 1850). Washington, D.C.: U.S. National Archives and Records Administration. During his three years with the Pennsylvania Telegraph, he worked his way up to become foreman and then state printer. He then began his medical studies under the training of Harrisburg physician Charles D. Bombaugh, M.D. Supporting his training through employment as a teacher and mail clerk, he enrolled in 1857 for formal studies with the medical department at the University of Pennsylvania, graduating from there in March 1859. Once back home in Harrisburg, he opened a private medical practice.Kelker, History of Dauphin County. In 1860, he wed Eliza Beatty (1833–1923).\\"Dr. William H. Egle\\", The New York Times.Kelker, History of Dauphin County. The following year, they welcomed the birth of a son, Beverly Waugh Egle (1861–1882).\\"William H. Egle, Eliza B.

Egle, M.D. enrolled for Civil War military service at Bakersville, Maryland, and was commissioned as an assistant surgeon with the field and staff officers' corps of the 96th Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry, a position he held until resigning his commission roughly six months later. Stationed in Virginia with his regiment throughout the fall of 1862, he experienced his first true taste of life as a combat surgeon with the 96th Pennsylvania's participation in the Battle of Fredericksburg. Involved in engagements ranging from light skirmishes to intense battles under heavy rifle and artillery fire beginning on December 12, 1862, he and his fellow 96th Pennsylvanians finally found relief three days later when they were ordered back across the Rappahannock River and made camp near White Oak Church. Caring for men who were primarily assigned to fatigue duty from January through March 1863, he resigned his commission on March 9 of that year.\\"Egle, William H., F&S; – 96 I\\", in \\"Civil War Veterans' Card File, 1861–1866.\\" Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania State Archives.\\"Egle, William H. and Egle, Eliza B.\\", in U.S. Civil War Pension Files (general index).

He was then commissioned as a surgeon at the age of 32, and enrolled on July 10, 1863 with the field and staff officers' corps of the 47th Pennsylvania Militia, Emergency of 1863. (Not to be confused with the 47th Pennsylvania Infantry, the 47th Pennsylvania Militia, Emergency of 1863 was one of a group of temporary volunteer militia units which were formed in response to the threatened invasion of Pennsylvania by Confederate troops during the summer of 1863. When the threat was deemed over by Pennsylvania's governor and senior military leaders, these units were disbanded, and their men were sent back to their respective communities.) A resident of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania at the time of his enrollment, Egle officially mustered in at Camp Curtin in Harrisburg the next day, but remained in that position only until August 14 when the entire regiment honorably mustered out.\\"Egle, William H. (F&S; – 47 I Mil 63)\\", in \\"Civil War Veterans' Card File.\\" Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: Pennsylvania State Archives.

Commissioned again as a surgeon, he mustered in at Camp Nelson, Kentucky on 12 July 1864 with Company S of the 116th Regiment Infantry, U.S. Colored Troops (USCT). On August 12, 1864, he was promoted to the rank of major. Attached to the Military District of Kentucky, Department of Ohio until September 1864, he and the other members of his regiment then served with the U.S. Army's X Corps (Army of the James) until November of that same year when the regiment became part of the X Corps' 1st Brigade, 3rd Division.\\"Official Register of The Army Volunteer Force, 1861–65\\" (116th Regiment, U.S. Colored Troops).

Post-war life  Following his resignation from the military, Egle returned home to his wife and medical practice in Pennsylvania. He also embarked on what would become a prolific career as a chronicler of Pennsylvania history.Kelker, History of Dauphin County. Before the decade was over, he and his wife welcomed the births of daughters, Sarah Beatty (1866–1939) and Catharine Irwin (1869–1943), on July 13, 1866 and January 19, 1869, respectively. A federal census taker in 1870 confirmed that Egle was employed as a physician, and noted that he had amassed real estate and personal property valued at $15,000, , while the 1880 federal census taker described him as a \\"druggist\\". The latter census also noted that the Egle household included son Beverly, a 19-year-old medical student; daughters \\"Sallie\\" and \\"Kittie\\", who were both still in school; and Mary Williams (aged 45) and Mary Jones (aged 30), who were employed as domestic workers in the Egle home.U.S. Census, 1870, 1880, 1900. The 1870s and 1880s were productive for Egle, as he became increasingly known and respected for his historical research and writing. In 1878, Lafayette College presented him with an \\"honorary degree [an A.M.] for his service in American history.\\"\\"MG 501 - Egle, William Collection.\\" Harrisburg, Pennsylvania: The Historical Society of Dauphin County, retrieved online July 30, 2018.

According to the Bloomsburg, Pennsylvania newspaper, The Columbian, Egle secured the position after Pennsylvania's Republican-controlled Senate failed to approve the governor's first choice for the post, York Press editor Edward Stuck.

Egle was described as a physician shortly after the turn of the century, when a federal government employee arrived at his Harrisburg home to interview him for the 1900 U.S. Census. Still residing with him were his wife, and his daughter Catharine.U.S. Census, 1870, 1880, 1900.  Death and interment  Sometime during the winter of 1901, Egle contracted the grippe, which then turned into pneumonia. He died from related complications in Harrisburg on February 10, 1901. Following funeral services at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church which were well attended by friends and colleagues, he was laid to rest at the Harrisburg Cemetery.

Playing in the first two rounds of the 2018 Masters at Augusta, Lin scored 79 and 80 for 15-over-par, which meant he missed the cut and did not qualify for the last two rounds. In the 2018 Open Championship at Carnoustie, he scored 80 and 74 for 12-over-par in the first two rounds, again missing the cut. Lin was the first winner of the Asia- Pacific to receive a direct invitation to both the Masters and The Open Championship.

It is described as a neurosteroid and anti-inflammatory drug and was used in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and soft-tissue rheumatism in the 1950s but is no longer used today. Pregnenolone can be taken by mouth, as a topical medication, or by injection into muscle. Pregnenolone is promoted online with false claims that it can treat a variety of health conditions including cancer, arthritis and multiple sclerosis. Medical uses Pregnenolone was approved for use as a pharmaceutical medication in the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and soft-tissue rheumatism in the 1950s. It is no longer used today. =Available forms= Pregnenolone acetate was available as Enelone in the form of 100 mg oral tablets and as a 100 mg/mL crystalline aqueous suspension in 10 mL vials. Pharmacology Pregnenolone is a neurosteroid. It is a negative allosteric modulator of the CB1 receptor, a ligand of the microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP2), and an agonist of the pregnane X receptor. Pregnenolone has no progestogenic, corticosteroid, estrogenic, androgenic, or antiandrogenic activity. In addition to its own activities, pregnenolone is a precursor for other neurosteroids such as pregnenolone sulfate, allopregnanolone, and pregnanolone and for steroid hormones. Pregnenolone has low bioavailability and is subject to high metabolism. Oral administration of 50 or 100 mg pregnenolone has been found to have minimal or negligible effect on urinary levels of testosterone and testosterone metabolites, including of androsterone, etiocholanolone, 5β-androstanediol, androstadienol, and androstenol (and/or their conjugates), and this suggests that only a small amount of pregnenolone is converted into testosterone. This is in accordance with findings on the conversion of DHEA into testosterone, in which only 1.5% of an oral dose of DHEA was found to be converted into testosterone. In contrast to the androstanes, 50 or 100 mg oral pregnenolone has been found to significantly and in fact \\"strongly\\" increase urinary levels of the progesterone metabolites pregnanediol and pregnanolone (and/or their conjugates), whereas pregnanetriol was unaffected. Unlike the case of oral administration, transdermal administration of 30 mg/day pregnenolone cream has not been found to affect urinary levels of metabolites of any other steroids, including of progesterone. Intranasal administration of pregnenolone was found to have low bioavailability of around 23%. Sripada et al. reported that oral pregnenolone is preferentially metabolized into the neurosteroid allopregnanolone rather than into other steroids such as DHEA or cortisol. In further research by their group, a single 400 mg dose of oral pregnenolone at 3 hours post-administration was found to result in a 3-fold elevation in serum levels of pregnenolone and a 7-fold increase in allopregnanolone levels. Pregnanolone levels increased by approximately 60% while DHEA levels decreased non-significantly by approximately 5% and cortisol levels were not affected. Another study found that allopregnanolone levels were increased by 3-fold at 2 hours post-administration following a single 400 mg oral dose of pregnenolone. In addition to allopregnanolone, pregnenolone acts as a prodrug of pregnenolone sulfate. However, pregnenolone sulfate does not cross the blood–brain barrier. Chemistry Pregnenolone, also known as 5-pregnenolone or as pregn-5-en-3β-ol-20-one, is a naturally occurring pregnane steroid and a derivative of cholesterol. Related steroids include pregnenolone sulfate, 3β-dihydroprogesterone (4-pregnenolone), progesterone, allopregnanolone, and pregnanolone. =Derivatives= A few synthetic ester derivatives of pregnenolone exist. These include pregnenolone acetate (Antofin, Previsone, Pregno-Pan) and pregnenolone succinate (Panzalone, Formula 405). Prebediolone acetate (Acetoxanon, Acetoxy-Prenolon, Artisone, Artivis, Pregnartrone, Sterosone), the 21-acetate ester of 21-hydroxypregnenolone, also exists. These esters are all described as glucocorticoids similarly to pregnenolone. The 3β-methyl ether of pregnenolone, 3β-methoxypregnenolone (MAP-4343), retains similar activity to pregnenolone in regard to interaction with MAP2, and is under development for potential clinical use for indications such as the treatment of brain and spinal cord injury and depressive disorders. History Pregnenolone was first synthesized by Adolf Butenandt and colleagues in 1934. It was first used in medicine, as an anti-inflammatory medication, in the 1940s. Society and culture =Generic names= Pregnenolone is the generic name of the drug and its , , , and . =Brand names= Pregnenolone has been marketed in the past under a variety of brand names including Arthenolone, Bina-Skin, Enelone, Natolone, Pregnetan, Pregneton, Pregnolon, Prenolon, Prenolone, Regnosone, Sharmone, and Skinostelon. =Availability= Pregnenolone is no longer marketed as a medication, but remains available as a supplement. Alternative medicine Pregnenolone has been promoted online with claims it can treat a variety of diseases including multiple sclerosis, arthritis, and cancer, but such claims are not backed by evidence. Research pregnenolone is being researched for possible therapeutic applications, but its poor bioavailability makes its prospects for usefulness low. Pregnenolone is available as an over-the-counter supplement, for instance in the United States.
