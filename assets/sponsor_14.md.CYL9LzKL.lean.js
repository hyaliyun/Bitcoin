Early 20th- century scholars were unsure of what language they spoke,Coree Indian Tribe, in Frederick Webb Hodge, Handbook of American Indians North of Mexico, Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution, 1906, carried on Access Genealogy, accessed Mar 18, 2010 but the coastal areas were mostly populated by Iroquois and Algonquian peoples. History 1585 map by Theodor de Bry with Cwareuuoc village in top left corner along Neuse River The Coree were not described by English colonists until 1701, by which time their population had already been reduced to as few as 125 members, likely due to epidemics of infectious disease and warfare. In the early 18th century, the Coree and several other tribes were allied with the Iroquoian Tuscarora against the colonists. In 1711, they participated in the Tuscarora War, trying to drive out the English settlers. The Native Americans were unsuccessful and suffered many fatalities. By 1715, some Coree merged with the remaining members of the nearby Algonquian Machapunga and Tuscarora people and settled in their single village of Mattamuskeet in present-day Hyde County. This was on the shore of Lake Mattamuskeet. Other Coree remained in Carteret county (especially in isolated areas such as Indian Beach, Atlantic Beach, Harkers Island- formerly known as Craney Island, Core Creek, and swamp lands). Descendants gradually married and assimilated into the European-American and African-American populations. Although in the 20th century, some people claim individual descent from the historical Coree, no revival of the tribe has been accomplished. Some observers believe that current attempts to claim Coree descent are by people who were among what anthropologists called \\"tri-racial isolates\\", often of majority European and African descent. Language The ethnographer James Mooney speculated that the Coree were related to the Iroquoian Cherokee, but he did not have convincing evidence. According to limited colonial reports, they spoke a language that did not appear to be mutually intelligible with any of the three major language stocks (Carolina Algonquian, Iroquoian Tuscarora, and Waccamaw Siouan or Woccon) to John Lawson, who described Coree after recording vocabularies of the other three.Handbook of North American Indians (2004, ) On the other hand, the Coree occupied territory that was historically mostly that of Tuscaroras, which suggests they were affiliated with these peoples. The name Coree may be the singular form of the Carolina Algonquian name Cwareuuoc. References Bibliography * Ives Goddard.

History =Origins= John Penton was an accomplished American off-road motorcycle racer. In 1950, Penton and his brothers opened a motorcycle dealership in Amherst, Ohio, where they sold BSA as well as BMW and NSU motorcycles. Penton became one of the top motorcycle enduro competitors in the nation, representing the United States seven times at the International Six Days Trial (now called International Six Days Enduro) between 1962 and 1970. The International Six Days Trial is a form of off-road motorcycle Olympics which is the oldest annual competition sanctioned by the FIM dating back to 1913. After winning the 1966 Jack Pine Enduro on a Husqvarna, the Swedish motorcycle manufacturer named him the distributor of the brand for the eastern United States. As the baby boomer generation came of age during the 1960s and 1970s, off-road motorcycling experienced a boom in popularity. Penton sought to capitalize on this boom by providing a lightweight off-road motorcycle. After failing to convince Husqvarna to produce an even lighter off-road machine, he decided make his proposal to the KTM factory in Austria which, at the time produced bicycles and mopeds. Penton offered to put up $6,000 of his own money if KTM would build prototypes to his specifications which, would be sold in the United States as Penton motorcycles. The first Penton motorcycles were produced in 1968 and used a modified small-capacity Sachs engine with improved suspension and details. He formed a successful racing team that supported some of the top enduro racers of the era including his son, Jack Penton who competed in 12 ISDT events as well as Dick Burleson, Carl Cranke and Billy Uhl. =Models= The early motorcycles made their mark in International Six Days Trials competitions, enduro races like the Michigan Jack Pine Endurance Run, scrambles and motocross. The most popular size was the 125cc (Six Day), but they were also made in 100 cc (Berkshire) and later, in 175 cc (Jackpiner, in 1972), 250 cc (Hare Scrambler, in 1973), and 400 cc (Mint, in 1974). Beginning in 1972 fiberglass gas tanks were introduced and all of the 175 cc and larger models used KTM engines. In 1974 longer travel gas forks with laid-down rear shocks for longer suspension travel, lightweight plastic fenders and frames of high grade chrome-moly steel were introduced. In 1976 two distinct models appeared for the first time differentiating between Motocross use (MC5) and Enduro (Cross County). The MC5 MX series used longer travel leading-axle, magnesium slider forks to complement the high lever-ratio rear suspension configuration making all but the 125 a competitive Motocross model. Other, less-common models included the Mudlark observed trials motorcycle (made by Wassell in England), the Cafe MX (a dual purpose version of the Mudlark), the Hiro 125 (the Six Day with an Italian motor), the Woodsman (an enduro version of the Mudlark) and the K-R (Kenny Roberts) short-track racer. =KTM buyout= Production, development and distribution was taken over completely by KTM Austria in 1978. By the time Penton sold the distributorship to KTM in 1978, more than 25,000 Penton motorcycles had been sold in America. John Penton was inducted into the AMA Motorcycle Hall of Fame in 1998. The 1997 KTM Jackpiner 200 LE was a limited production run of the first 200 cc KTM enduro motorcycle. It was built to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the first Penton KTM motorcycle. It came with Penton blue plastics and John Penton’s signature on a sticker attached to the front fender.

It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on May 21, 2006. Plot The Springfield Isotopes win first place in the NL West thanks to their new acquisition of Buck “Home run King” Mitchell. During a game at Springfield Stadium, Buck's pop star wife Tabitha Vixx sings the first few bars of the American national anthem, then strips down to lingerie and launches into a lascivious performance of one of her own songs. Buck, humiliated, delivers a terrible performance at that night's game, and even accidentally lets go of the bat while swinging it which accidentally hits Sideshow Mel's fiancé, causing the crowd to boo at him. He later sees Homer and Marge kissing on the Jumbo-Vision. Later that night, Buck shows up at the Simpsons’ front door and asks for help with his marriage in exchange for season tickets. Marge doubts their ability to counsel other couples. Her doubts lead to her and Homer flirting, which Buck sees as an example of what he wants with his own wife. At the first session--taking place in the Simpsons’ living room--Buck confesses he assumed Tabitha would give up her recording career to focus on his minor league baseball career, to which she responds she will not stay in a mismatched marriage. The next session takes place at Buck and Tabitha's mansion and goes much more smoothly. As a result of his now-steady personal life, Buck's game returns to superior form. Tabitha continues her concert tour, and Homer comes to check up on her in her dressing room. There he gives her a neck rub; her loud moans and Homer's praise of the fried chicken he is eating are overheard through the door by Buck, who misinterprets them and barges in enraged and slugs Homer. Now with his marriage again on the rocks, Buck goes into another slump. Homer wants to get them back together, but Marge refuses to help. A few minutes later Tabitha knocks on the door; she tells a shocked Marge that she plans to leave Buck for good. Marge objects, insisting they stay together. During Buck's next game, Homer hijacks the Duff blimp and spells out a message to Buck, supposedly from Tabitha proclaiming her love. Buck, reinvigorated, hits the ball into the blimp itself, causing it to crash into the field; as Homer alone runs from the wreckage, Buck realizes Tabitha had no part in the message. He charges Homer, bat in hand, but Marge dissuades him by saying that Homer was just trying to help, and that marriage is hard work but worth it. Tabitha then comes on the Jumbo-Vision to tell Buck she wants to stay together. The episode closes with another Isotope player, Tito, saying he does not care about the healed marriage because bandits just kidnapped his mother.

History The first integrated circuits had features of 200 micrometres which were printed using contact lithography. This technique was popular in the 1960s until it was substituted by proximity printing, where a gap is introduced between the photomask and the substrate. Proximity printing had poorer resolution than contact printing (due to the gap allowing more diffraction to occur) but generated far less defects. The resolution was sufficient for down to 2 micrometre production. In 1978, the step-and-repeat projection system appeared. The platform gained wide acceptance due to the reduction of the mask image and is still in use today. Contact lithography is still commonly practiced today, mainly in applications requiring thick photoresist and/or double-sided alignment and exposure. Advanced 3D packaging, optical devices, and micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS) applications fall into this category. In addition, the contact platform is the same as used in imprint processes. Recently, two developments have given contact lithography potential for comeback in semiconductor lithography. First, surface plasmon resonance enhancements including the use of silver films as lenses have been demonstrated to give resolution of less than 50 and even 22 nm using wavelengths of 365 and 436 nm. The exotic dispersion relation of surface plasmon has led to the extremely short wavelength, which helps to break the diffraction limit. Second, nanoimprint lithography has already gained popularity outside the semiconductor sector (e.g., hard-drive, biotechnology) and is a candidate for sub-45 nm semiconductor lithography, driving defect reduction practices and uniformity improvement for masks in contact with the substrate. Step-and-flash imprint lithography (SFIL), a popular form of nanoimprint lithography which involves UV curing of the imprint film, essentially uses the same setup as contact lithography. Operating principle Generally, a photomask is purchased/generated, which consists of opaque Chromium patterns on a transparent glass plate. A sample (or \\"substrate\\") is coated with a thin film of UV-sensitive photoresist. The sample is then placed underneath the photomask, and pressed into \\"contact\\" against it. The sample is \\"exposed\\", during which UV light is then shone from the top side of the photomask. Photoresist lying beneath transparent glass is exposed, and becomes able to be dissolved by a developer, while photoresist lying under Chrome did not receive any UV exposure and will remain intact after developing. Thus the pattern may be transferred from the photomask to a sample, in the form of photo-sensitive resist. The pattern may then be permanently transferred into the substrate via any number of microfabrication processes, such as etching or lift-off. A single photomask may be used many times to repeatably reproduce a pattern onto different substrates. A \\"contact aligner\\"http://www.nanotech.ucsb.edu/index.php?option=com_content&view;=article&id;=127:contact- lithography&catid;=42&Itemid;=22 is generally used to perform this operation, so that previous patterns on a substrate may be aligned to the pattern one wants to expose. Upon exiting the photomask-photoresist interface, the image- forming light is subject to near-field diffraction as it propagates through the photoresist. Diffraction causes the image to lose contrast with increasing depth into the photoresist. This can be explained by the rapid decay of the highest-order evanescent waves with increasing distance from the photomask- photoresist interface. This effect can be partly mitigated by using thinner photoresist. Contrast enhancements based on plasmon resonances and lensing films have recently been disclosed. The chief advantage of contact lithography is the elimination of the need for complex projection optics between object and image. The resolution limit in today's projection optical systems originates from the finite size of the final imaging lens and its distance from the image plane. More specifically, the projection optics can only capture a limited spatial frequency spectrum from the object (photomask). Contact printing has no such resolution limit but is sensitive to the presence of defects on the mask or on the substrate. Types of contact masks There are several types of contact lithography masks. The standard binary intensity amplitude mask defines dark and light areas where light is blocked or transmitted, respectively. The dark areas are patterned films consisting of chromium or other metal. The light coupling mask has a corrugated dielectric surface. Each protrusion acts as a localized waveguide. Light is transmitted primarily through the protrusions as a result of this localized guiding effect. Since less contact area is needed, there is less potential for defects. A hybrid nanoimprint-contact mask utilizes both contact imaging and mechanical imprinting, and has been proposed to optimize imaging of both large and small features simultaneously by eliminating imprint residual layer issues. Contact masks have traditionally been fairly large (>100 mm), but it is possible that alignment tolerances may require smaller mask sizes to allow stepping between exposures. As in nanoimprint lithography, the mask needs to have roughly the same feature size as the desired image. Contact masks can be formed directly from other contact masks, or by direct writing (e.g., electron beam lithography). Resolution enhancements As noted above, thinner photoresist can help improve image contrast. Reflections from the layer underlying the photoresist also have to be taken into account when absorption and evanescent wave decay are reduced. The resolution of contact lithography has been predicted to surpass λ/20 periodicity. The pitch resolution of contact lithography can be readily enhanced by multiple exposures generating feature images between previously exposed features. This is suitable for nested array features, as in memory layouts. Surface plasmons are collective oscillations of free electrons confined to metal surfaces. They couple strongly to light, forming surface plasmon polaritons. Such excitations effectively behave as waves with very short wavelength (approaching the x-ray regime). By exciting such oscillations under the right conditions, multiple features can appear in between a pair of grooves in the contact mask. The resolution achievable by surface plasmon polariton standing waves on a thin metallic film is <10 nm with a wavelength in the 380-390 nm range using a <20 nm silver film. In addition, deep narrow slits in metallic transmission gratings have been shown to allow resonances that amplify light passing through the slits. A layer of metal film, has been proposed to act as a 'perfect lens' for amplifying the evanescent waves, resulting in enhanced image contrast. This requires tuning the permittivity to have a negative real part, e.g., silver at 436 nm wavelength. X. Jiao et al., Progress in Electromagnetics Research Symposium 2005, pp. 1-5 (2005) The use of such a lens allows imaging to be achieved with a wide tolerance of distance between mask and photoresist, while achieving extreme resolution enhancement by use of surface plasmon interference, e.g., a half-pitch of 25 nm with 436 nm wavelength. The perfect lens effect is only effective for certain conditions, but allows a resolution roughly equal to the layer thickness. Hence a sub-10 nm resolution appears feasible with this approach as well. The use of surface plasmon interference gives an edge over other lithography techniques, as the number of mask features can be much less than the number of features in the desired image, making the mask easier to fabricate and inspect. While silver is the most commonly used metal for demonstrating surface plasmons for lithography, aluminum has also been used at 365 nm wavelength. While these resolution enhancement techniques allow 10 nm features to be contemplated, other factors must be considered for practical implementation. The most fundamental limitation appears to be photoresist roughness, which becomes predominant for shorter sub-wavelength periods where only the zeroth diffraction order is expected to propagate. All the pattern details are in this case conveyed by the evanescent waves, which decay more rapidly for finer resolution. As a result, the photoresist's inherent roughness following development can become more significant than the pattern. Defect and contamination issues As with any technology that relies on surface contact, defects are a strong concern. Defects are particularly detrimental to contact lithography in two respects. First, a hard defect can widen the gap between the mask and the substrate. This can easily cause images based on evanescent waves or surface plasmon interference to disappear. Second, smaller, softer defects attached to the metal surface of the mask may not disturb the gap but can still alter the evanescent wave distribution or destroy the surface plasmon interference condition. Oxidation of the metal surface E.g., W. Cai et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. vol. 83, pp. 1705-1710 (1998) also destroys plasmon resonance conditions (as the oxide surface is not a metal).

Biography Dargah Entrance Dargah entrance Banda Nawaz was born to Syed walShareef Muhammad bin Yousuf AlHussaini in Delhi in 1321. At the age of four, his family shifted to Daulatabad in Deccan (now in Maharashtra). In 1397, he went to Gulbarga, Deccan (presently in Karnataka) at the invitation of Sultan Taj ud-Din Firuz Shah. At the age fifteen, he returned to Delhi for his education and training by Nasiruddin Chiragh Dehlavi. He was also a very enthusiastic student of Kethli, Tajuddin Bahadur and Qazi Abdul Muqtadir. After teaching at various places such as Delhi, Mewat, Gwalior, Chander, Aircha, Chatra, Chanderi, Miandhar, Baroda, Khambayat and Gulbarga in 1397 and died in Gulbarga in the year November 1422. His name as well as patronymic was Abul-Fatah and Gaisu Daraz was his title. Among the scholars and theologians he was Sheikh Abul-Fatah Sadr Uddin Muhammad Dehlavi but people called him Khwaja Banda Nawaz Gaisu Daraaz. Parentage He is a descendant of Ali. His forefathers resided in Hirat. One of them came to Delhi and settled down here. His father Syed walShareef Muhammad bin Yousuf was born here on 4, Rajab, 721 Hijri. His father Syed walShareef Yousuf bin Muhammad AlHussaini was a holy figure and devoted to Nizam Uddin Aulia. Sultan Muhammad-bin Tughlaq once transferred his capital to Daulatabad (Devgiri) and along with him went many scholars, theologians, and mystics. His parents also migrated to the place. He was four years at the time Malik-ul-Umar Syed Ibrahim Mustafa AlHashmi, his maternal uncle, was the governor of Daulatabad. In Delhi His father died when he was fifteen. He had heard a lot about Nizam Uddin Auliya and Nasir Uddin Roshan Chiragh Dehlavi from his father and maternal grand father and grew devoted to them. One day he went to perform his prayer in the Jama-Majid of Sultan Qutub Uddin, there he saw Sheikh Nasir Uddin Mahmud Chiragh Dehlavi and pledged obedience to him on 16, Rajab. Under the guidance of Nasir Uddin Chiragh Dehlavi he engaged himself in prayers and meditation and so much enjoyed them that he forbade studies and requested his teacher to allow him to do so. Nasir Uddin denied him permission and instructed him to study with attention Usool-e-Bizoori, Risals Shamsia, Kashaf, Misbah so he restarted the studies under the guidance of renowned teachers. AlHussaini left Delhi on December 17, 1398, because the city was under siege by Timur and its fall was imminent. Title Gesu-Daraaz One day he with other disciples lifted the palanquin bearing Nasir Uddin. His long hair stuck into the foot of the palki and pained him severely but he did not disentangle them for love and respect to the teacher. When Nasir Uddin learned of the episode, he was overjoyed and recited the Persian couplet: \\"Har ki murid Syed gesu daraaz shud Vallah khilaf-e-nest ki Uoo ishq baaz shud.\\" (\\"Syed Gesu Daraaz has pledged his obedience; there is nothing wrong in it because he has deeply fallen in love.\\") He thus gained the title \\"Gesu Daraaz\\". In Gulbarga Having lived for over forty years in Delhi, he moved to Gulbarga at the age of around 76. Firoz Shah Bahmani ruled over the Deccan during this period. He gave him much respect. For a long time he was engaged in religious discourses, sermons, and spiritual training of the people. He stay in Gulbarga for 22years Death Bande Nawaz died aged 101 on 16 Dhu al-Qadah 825 Hijri in Gulbarga and was buried there. His tomb is a place of Ziyaarat, Works Bande Nawaz wrote 195 books in Arabic, Persian and Urdu. His magnum opus, Tafseer Multaqat, was compiled into one book very recently. He also composed a book on the Prophet of Islam titled Miraj-al Ashiqin for the instruction of the masses in Dakhni, a South Indian branch of the Urdu language. He was the first Sufi to use this vernacular which was elaborated upon by many other Sufi saints of South India in later centuries.Mystical Dimensions of Islam By Annemarie Schimmel, Pg 351 He wrote many treatises on the works on Ibn Arabi and Suhrawardi, which made the works of these scholars accessible to Indian scholars and played a major role in influencing later mystical thought.

Later, he played with \\"Braća kozaci\\" band in the area of Subotica and Horgoš. From 1948 to 1951, he worked in Radio Titograd in Montenegro, where he perfected his tamburitza play. From its foundation in 1951 to the end of his working career he worked in Radio Novi Sad and was a member of its Grand Tamburitza Orchestra. He was spending nights playing with his 8-men band in kafanas of Novi Sad, especially on Petrovaradin Fortress, of which he became one of icons. During his career, he held concerts across the world, including 36 performances in Paris Olympia. Allegedly, he had several offers from United States and Soviet Union to move there and work as a tamburitza teacher, but he never wanted to leave Novi Sad, where he died in 1988. Janika participated in several documentary and feature films. Songs \\"Osam tamburaša s Petrovaradina\\" (Eight tambouritza-players from Petrovaradin) and \\"Primaši\\" were dedicated to him. During his career, he worked with many renowned musicians, including Zvonko Bogdan and Júlia Biszák. Statue of Janika Balaž in Novi Sad After his death, the city of Novi Sad raised a monument (authored by sculptor Lászlo Szilágyi), standing on a square opposite the Petrovaradin fortress across the Danube.

It is located in Carteret County. It was populated with local Native Americans prior to the arrival of European settlers. It is also the location of the state ferry transportation system dock where travel can be made across Pamlico Sound to the island and village of Ocracoke in Hyde County.Visit North Carolina web site - Cedar Island to Ocracoke Ferry Retrieved January 18, 2016. Roads There are only two main roads on Cedar Island. Northbound Route 12 is the only way to drive to Cedar Island without using a ferry connection. Southbound North Carolina Highway 12 continues from the ferry terminal across Cedar island to meet with U.S. Route 70 on the mainland near the community of Sea Level, North Carolina. Motorists traveling north on N.C. 12 board the ferry to Ocracoke Island from Cedar Island. Amenities In 2005, the population of Cedar Island was about 350. Many residents are fishermen, though fishing is declining in the area. The other major employer is the North Carolina Ferry System. There are three churches on the island: Methodist, Free Will Baptist, and Primitive Baptist. The Methodist and Free Will Baptist maintain regular meetings and Sunday services. There are a few local businesses. Cedar Island is about long, extending from the \\"Lola\\" village, down the bay, on the southeast end near the Core Sound and Lewis Creek, up to the Ferry Station at the north side of the island, bordering Pamlico Sound. The main village of Cedar Island, formerly known as \\"Roe\\" is located along the north central portion of the island. There is a fisherman's harbor in this area. Cedar Island has sandy beaches backed up against stands of juniper (mistaken by early settlers for cedars) and pine. More than half of Cedar Island belongs to the (Federal) Cedar Island Wildlife Refuge.U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service - Cedar Island National Wildlife Refuge, North Carolina. Retrieved January 18, 2016. The refuge is open for hiking and has a headquarters and information kiosk at the south end of the island, near the end of Lola Road. There are boat ramps for public use. Climate The climate of Cedar Island is cooler than inland areas in the summer and warmer in the winter, and it is occasionally hit by hurricanes in the fall. Temperatures do not often fall below freezing in the winter, nor do they often rise above 90 degrees in the summer.

'Ecoregions', Te Ara - the Encyclopedia of New Zealand, updated 21-Sep-2007 It is east of the town of Taupo, next to the northeastern shore of Lake Taupo. Formed about 65,000 years ago, Mount Tauhara was not a violently explosive vent, instead slowly oozing a viscous dacitic lava. It is the largest mass of dacite within the Taupo volcano, whose material is 98% rhyolitic.Volcanic Hazards Working Group of the Civil Defence Scientific Advisory Committee, which includes scientists from the Institute of Geological and Nuclear Sciences and the Universities, Number seven \\"Taupo Volcanic Centre\\" Little evidence of its volcanic past remains today; the peak is covered in dense native bush. There is a steep walking track to the top of Mount Tauhara, starting at Mountain Road. On a clear day, the summit offers excellent views over the Volcanic Plateau, encompassing the entirety of Lake Taupo in the southwest. The hike is relatively strenuous and takes about an hour and a half each way. The track is not well groomed; being slightly overgrown in some places. However, there is a pristine spring near the top perfect for drinking and the view at the summit is spectacular. This is the Māori legend about Mt Tauhara: :The warrior mountains of Taranaki, Pūtauaki, Tongariro and Tauhara were deeply in love with Pīhanga the mountain that stands above Turangi at the southern end of Lake Taupo. A battle erupted to win Pīhanga's favour and the victor was Tongariro. At their defeat, the other mountains decided to leave Tongariro's domain, travelling as far away as they could in the course of one night. Taranaki fled west towards the setting sun, and Pūtauaki and Tauhara fled north towards the sunrise. Pūtauaki moved fast and is now located near Whakatane and is also known as Mt Edgecumbe. But Tauhara was sad and with a heavy heart he traveled reluctantly. When overtaken by dawn he had only reached the north eastern shore of Lake Taupo. Here he stands to this day looking mournfully across the lake towards his lost love, Pīhanga.Te Ahukaramū Charles Royal.

Though a leading supporter of observation and experiment, in what we now call science, few of his theories have survived. Life Woodward was born on 1 May 1665 or perhaps 1668, in a village, possibly Wirksworth, in Derbyshire. His family may have been from Gloucestershire; his mother's maiden surname was Burdett.ODNB entry: Retrieved 14 October 2011. Subscription required. At the age of 16 he went to London to be apprenticed to a linen draper, but he later studied medicine with Dr Peter Barwick, physician to Charles II. As a leading physician who had never been to university, Woodward was a prominent figure on the \\"modern\\" side in the Quarrel of the Ancients and the Moderns in early 18th-century England, on the medical and other fronts.Levine, Chapter 1 ff. In 1692 Woodward was appointed Gresham Professor of Physic and in 1693 elected a fellow of the Royal Society. In 1695 he was made M. D. by Archbishop Tenison and also by Cambridge. In 1702 he became a fellow of the Royal College of Physicians. He died on 25 April 1728, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.A. R. Hall: The Abbey Scientists, p. 53, London: Roger & Robert Nicholson, 1966. Works In 1699, John Woodward published his water-culture (hydroponic) experiments with spearmint. He found that plants in less pure water sources grew better than plants in distilled water. While still a student, he became interested in botany and natural history, and his attention during visits to Gloucestershire was drawn to the fossils found there. He began to form the great collection, for which he is known. He published An Essay toward a Natural History of the Earth and Terrestrial Bodies, especially Minerals, &c.; in 1695 (2nd ed. 1702, 3rd ed. 1723), followed by Brief Instructions for making Observations in all Parts of the World (1696). He later wrote An Attempt towards a Natural History of the Fossils of England (2 vols., 1728 and 1729). In these works he showed that the stony surface of the earth was divided into strata, and that the enclosed fossils were originally generated at sea; but his views on the method of rock formation remained unsupported. They were satirized by John Arbuthnot, who ridiculed what he saw as Woodward's classicist method and personal venality. Nonetheless, Woodward accurately described his rocks, minerals and fossils in his elaborate Catalogue. Woodward's The State of Physick and of Diseases... Particularly of the Smallpox (1718) arose from a long-running dispute over smallpox with John Freind. Both accused the other of killing their patients (in the modern view a judgement few doctors of that period can escape). Woodward claimed that his experimental evidence showed that smallpox arose from an excess of \\"bilious salts\\", whereas Freind saw the causes of the disease as unknowable.Levine, p. 12 (quote) and Chapter 1. Dr Woodward's shield A notable shield bought by John Conyers from a London ironmonger was sold to Woodward after his death by one of his daughters.Levine, p. 151. The shield, now in the British Museum, is recognised as a classicising French Renaissance buckler of the mid-16th century, perhaps sold from the Royal Armouries of Charles II, but thought by Woodward and others to be Roman. Woodward published a treatise on it in 1713, provoking a satire on the \\"follies of antiquarianism\\" by Alexander Pope, written in the same year, but not printed until 1733.The Woodward Shield / Dr Woodward's Shield, British Museum Collection database. The episode is told in Joseph M. Levine (1977), Dr Woodward's Shield: History, Science and Satire in Augustan England, probably the best modern source on Woodward generally. Woodward is mentioned twice in Pope's Fourth Satire of Dr. John Donne and is a candidate for the original of \\"Mummius\\" in Pope's The Dunciad. Bequest Woodward's will directed that his personal estate and effects be sold, and land to the yearly value of £150 purchased and conveyed to the University of Cambridge. A lecturer was to be chosen and paid £100 a year to read at least four lectures a year on a subject treated in his Natural History of the Earth. This created the Woodwardian professorship of geology. He also bequeathed his collection of English fossils to the university, to be under the care of the geology lecturer. This formed the nucleus of the Cambridge Woodwardian Museum, whose specimens have since been moved to the Sedgwick Museum of Earth Sciences.

ECI systems often work in tandem with other technologies such as enterprise content management, document management, groupware, and records management. It takes a decentralized approach in order to manage content from various resources. ECI implementations exist on a tier above the organization’s existing software and provide wide-ranging search, indexing, and access functions. Functions ECI systems, in particular, and Unified Information Access systems in general, attempt to address the growing trend of the recognition that so-called “unstructured content,” such as a series of documents, can be important and can contribute to business development. Their other important function lies in their ability to increase the efficiency which with organizations can retrieve data by providing a single channel to access a wide variety of storage locations.Bergman, p. 4. Enterprise content integration aims to answer a number of needs in today's organizations: # Migrating content (documents and images) from one system to another # Synchronizing part or all the content between two or more content repositories # Searching for documents across all content repositories # Offering a single point of access to all documents and content of the organization # Publishing or pushing this content to other systems (enterprise portals, web sites) Features ECI functions through the use of a metadata catalog that contains records regarding data throughout the enterprise in order to enable users to seek, browse, locate, and retrieve the necessary information. ECI metadata catalogs are able to collect data from a wide array of sources, including digital asset management systems, file and web servers, and individual users’ PCs. Vendors sometimes refer to this sort of decentralized content management as a virtual repository or a virtual file system. In addition to gathering data for the metadata catalog, some ECI systems are able to connect to the resources offered by a computer system directly through an interface such as an API. These types of connections are often referred to as adapters, connectors, or content bridges by ECI vendors. ECI systems can also offer automated aggregation, packaging, and distribution of indexed content through administrator-configurable channels, which allows flexible reporting and powerful analytic capabilities across a wide array of data sources. ECI administrators can design the system by specifying rules for the way indexed content should be packaged as well as how and to whom the content should be delivered. To accomplish these goals, some ECI systems are able to integrate with other computer systems such as publishing systems and format converters, often through web service interfaces.Rosenblatt, p. 9-14. Vendors A number of vendors have provided ECI solutions through the history of the technology. One of the first was Context Media (now owned by Oracle);Oracle Buys Context Media. http://www.informationweek.com/news/global- cio/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=166404237. Accessed 14 November 2010. their Interchange Platform (now known as Interchange Suite 3.0) provided several cutting-edge features, including a dashboard interface for monitoring the flow of content and the creation of metadata, a component that allowed the definition of relationships among collected data, and a packaging and distribution function. Venetica Corporation, founded in 1993, also pioneered ECI solutions with its flagship VeniceBridge product.Venetica Corporation. http://biz.yahoo.com/ic/106/106574.html Venetica was acquired in 2004 by IBMIBM Completes Acquisition of Venetica. http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/7327.wss and its ECI technology is now sold as IBM Content Integrator, which provides out-of-the-box connectors for the industry's most popular content management systems, as well as several features for federation and developer services. Agari Mediaware was another company among those in the first wave of ECI solution providers. However, the company filed for bankruptcy in July 2003. This was likely due to the poor market reception of the product; it was viewed by many implementers as an architecture rather than a complete solution, and most companies desired a solution that could be quickly put into place and enabled with a minimum of additional effort.Rosenblatt, p. 10-11. Other vendors of ECI systems include Day Software, EntropySoft, and SeeUnity, all of which offer a variety of connectors to various content management systems. A number of search-based applications vendors sell ECI systems, such as Aspire (Search Technologies), CloudView (Exalead), Lookeen Server, and Documentum. Footnotes References *Bergman, M.K.

Biography  He was born to a noble Protestant family that originally operated mills in South Bohemia, but moved to Kutna Hora, then Prague, where they occupied several official positions. His father died when he was only three, and he was commended to the care of the local schools, where he received a thorough classical education. It is uncertain where he learned painting, although he probably studied at the Royal Court, where he would have worked with Aegidius Sadeler.Biography from Allgemeine Deutsche Biographie @ German Wikisource. During this time, the Thirty Years' War had begun and Prague was taken by Catholic forces. Protestants were tolerated at first, but a major conversion effort was initiated in 1627 and, the following year, he fled with his mother to Saxony. He eventually made his way to Italy, spent a few years in Venice studying the works of Veronese, Tintoretto and Titian, then went to Rome in 1634. While there, he joined the Bentvueghels (a Dutch painters' association) under the pseudonym \\"Slagzwaart\\" (Broadsword). By this time, he had already established himself as a portrait painter. After about a year he went back to Saxony and finally returned to Prague in 1638, where he converted to Catholicism and sued to regain his property; possibly with the assistance of an influential Jesuit, as he had begun to accept commissions from that order. He opened a studio in 1645 and joined the artists' guild, serving as its chairman from 1651 to 1661. In addition to his portraits, he painted altarpieces and other decorations at several churches, including the Church of Our Lady before Týn, the Church of Saint Procopius, Žižkov and St. Wenceslas Church in Zderaz. Numerous streets have been named after him; in Vinohrady, Brno, Ostrava, Olomouc, Ústí nad Labem, Jihlava, Česká Lípa, Litoměřice, Vysoké Mýto, Hořice, Lysá nad Labem, Řevnice, Žatec and Plzeň. He is also the subject of two theatrical works (both called Karel Škréta). The first is a comedy, written in 1841 by . The second is a comic opera, based on Svoboda's play, written in 1883 by Karel Bendl, to a libretto by Eliška Krásnohorská. Although his art plays a role in the plots (especially at the climax), they feature romantic and political intrigues that end in murder.

Life Bulkeley was the eldest son of Sir Richard Bulkeley, of Beaumaris and Anglesey by his first wife Margaret née Savage. He was appointed Constable of Beaumaris Castle in 1561 and elected first Mayor of Beaumaris in 1562. In 1563, he was elected Member of Parliament for Anglesey, a position he obtained through the influence of his father. He was appointed High Sheriff of Anglesey for 1570. His father's sudden death gave rise to much scandal: he was on very bad terms with his stepmother Agnes Needham and accused her of poisoning his father. While Agnes had undoubtedly been unfaithful to her husband, she was acquitted of murder. Bulkeley was knighted in Whitehall, London in 1577, and became embroiled in various power struggles in Wales including with the Earl of Leicester and Owen Wood of Rhosmor. Wood accused him of oppressing the townspeople of Beaumaris, and being involved with the 1586 Babington plot. Bulkeley was exonerated by the Privy Council on these charges, but was censured in the Star Chamber for molesting Wood. He is known for being a courtier of Queen Elizabeth, and entertained her in Lewisham — see Honor Oak. She appointed him one of the Council of the Marches of Wales in 1602. In 1604 Bulkeley was elected MP for Anglesey again, and was re-elected in 1614.W R Williams The Parliamentary History of the Principality of Wales He was one of the Council of the Marches of Wales again in 1617. In 1618, he founded the family seat at Baron Hill. Bulkeley was buried at Beaumaris 28 June 1621, aged 88 and was succeeded by his son Richard. Family Bulkeley married twice: firstly Catherine (who died 1573), the daughter of Sir William Davenport Kt. of Brome Hall, Cheshire, and secondly on 18 February 1576 Mary, the daughter of William Burgh, 2nd Baron Burgh of Gainsborough, de jure 6th Baron Strabolgi and his wife Lady Katherine Clinton, daughter of Edward Clinton, 1st Earl of Lincoln. His son, Thomas, was created Viscount Bulkeley in 1644, in recognition of his support for the Royalist cause. Three successive viscounts carried the forename Richard. Bulkeley's younger half- brother was Lancelot Bulkeley, later Archbishop of Dublin. Of his daughters, Catherine married Sir Edwin Sandys [uncle], and Penelope married Sir Edwin Sandys [nephew].

In its outset, it only had the one platform, and goods sidings including the Ambrosia milk- processing factory. After a time, a second (northbound) platform was added, but due to space constraints was sited on the other side of the A377 road bridge. A small booking office was located on the platform, but was only staffed during the few minutes prior to a train's arrival. In 1990, the goods yard was the destination of a weekly fertilizer train.Mitchell, David (1994). British Railways Past and Present - Devon. Peterborough: Past and Present Publishing. . p. 66 Although the second platform has been removed, the loop serving it was still in place but disused. By June 2012, the loop had been removed and the track \\"plain lined\\". A bridge over a river to the south of the station shows that many structures were built to accommodate double track, but between Copplestone and Umberleigh the line has always been single track and those structures have never been used. Services Six trains a day in each direction stop at Lapford and four on Saturdays and Sundays on the Barnstaple to Exmouth.

It relates to the tendency of investors to sell assets that have increased in value, while keeping assets that have dropped in value. Hersh Shefrin and Meir Statman identified and named the effect in their 1985 paper, which found that people dislike losing significantly more than they enjoy winning. The disposition effect has been described as \\"[o]ne of the most robust facts about the trading of individual investors\\" because investors will hold stocks that have lost value yet sell stocks that have gained value.\\" In 1979, Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky traced the cause of the disposition effect to the so-called \\"prospect theory\\". The prospect theory proposes that when an individual is presented with two equal choices, one having possible gains and the other with possible losses, the individual is more likely to opt for the former choice even though both would yield the same economic result. The disposition effect can be minimized by a mental approach called \\"hedonic framing\\". Overview Nicholas Barberis and Wei Xiong have described the disposition effect as \\"one of the most robust facts about the trading of individual investors.” The effect, they note, “has been documented in all the available large databases of individual investor trading activity and has been linked to important pricing phenomena such as post-earnings announcement drift and stock-level momentum. Disposition effects have also been uncovered in other settings—in the real estate market, for example, and in the exercise of executive stock options.\\" Barberis has noted that the disposition effect is not a rational sort of conduct because of the reality of stock market momentum, meaning “that stocks that have done well over the past six months tend to keep doing well over the next six months; and that stocks that have done poorly over the past six months tend to keep doing poorly over the next six months.” This being the case, the rational act would be “to hold on to stocks that have recently risen in value; and to sell stocks that have recently fallen in value. But individual investors tend to do exactly the opposite.” Alexander Joshi has summed up the disposition effect as the disposition that investors have to hold on to losing positions longer than winning positions, saying that \\"investors hate losses and will gamble to avoid experiencing them, so they exhibit risk-seeking behaviour by holding losers. Conversely investors will want to lock in gains, so they exhibit risk-averse behaviour by selling winners.” Dacey and Zielonka showed that the greater the level of stock prices volatility, the more prone the investor was to sell a loser, contrary to the disposition effect. This result explains the panic selling of stocks during a market collapse. Shefrin and Statman study The effect was identified and named by Hersh Shefrin and Meir Statman in 1985. In their study, Shefrin and Statman noted that \\"people dislike incurring losses much more than they enjoy making gains, and people are willing to gamble in the domain of losses.\\" Consequently, \\"investors will hold onto stocks that have lost value...and will be eager to sell stocks that have risen in value.\\" The researchers coined the term \\"disposition effect\\" to describe this tendency of holding on to losing stocks too long and to sell off well-performing stocks too readily. Shefrin colloquially described this as a \\"predisposition toward get-evenitis.\\" John R. Nofsinger has called this sort of investment behavior as a product of the desire to avoid regret and seek pride. Prospect theory Researchers have traced the cause of the disposition effect to so-called \\"prospect theory\\", which was first identified and named by Daniel Kahneman and Amos Tversky in 1979. Kahneman and Tversky stated that, \\"losses have more emotional impact than an equivalent amount of gains,\\" and that people consequently base their decisions not on perceived losses but on perceived gains. What this means is that, if presented with two equal choices, one described in terms of possible gains and the other described in terms of possible losses, they would opt for the former choice, even though both would yield the same economic end result. For example, even though the net result of receiving $50 would be the same as the net result of gaining $100 and then losing $50, people would tend to take a more favorable view of the former than of the latter scenario. In Kahneman and Tversky's study, participants were presented with two situations. In the first, they had $1,000 and had to select one of two choices. Under Choice A, they would have a 50% chance of gaining $1,000, and a 50% chance of gaining $0; under Choice B, they would have a 100% chance of gaining $500. In the second situation, they had $2,000 and had to select either Choice A (a 50% chance of losing $1,000, and 50% of losing $0) or Choice B (a 100% chance of losing $500). An overwhelming majority of participants chose “B” in the first scenario and \\"A\\" in the second. This suggested that \\"people are willing to settle for a reasonable level of gains (even if they have a reasonable chance of earning more), but are willing to engage in risk-seeking behaviors where they can limit their losses. In other words, losses are weighted more heavily than an equivalent amount of gains.” This phenomenon is called the “asymmetric value function,\\" which means, in short, that \\"a loss creates a greater feeling of pain compared to the joy created by an equivalent gain.\\" The prospect theory can explain such phenomena as people who prefer not to deposit their money in a bank, even though they would earn interest, or people who choose not to work overtime because they would have to pay higher taxes. It also plainly underlies the disposition effect. In both situations presented to participants in Kahneman and Tversky's study, the participants sought, in risk-averse fashion, to cash in on guaranteed gains. This behavior plainly explains why investors act too soon to realize stockmarket gains. Avoiding the disposition effect The disposition effect can be minimized by means of a mental approach called \\"hedonic framing\\". For example, individuals can try to force themselves to think of a single large gain as a number of smaller gains, to think of a number of smaller losses as a single large loss, to think of the combination of a major gain and a minor loss as a net minor gain, and, in the case of a combined major loss and minor gain, to think of the two separately. In a similar manner, investors show a reversed disposition effect when they are framed to think of their investment as progress towards a specific investment goal rather than a generic investment.

Viscount in Jersey is to act as mace-bearer Armed When the mace was still in actual use as a weapon, it was deemed fit for close-protection, and hence a mace-bearer could be a bodyguard. Thus in French and Dutch, a massier (armed with a masse d'armes 'weapon-mace') could be a member of a formally so-styled guard corps, as in the court of the Dukes of Brabant. In Spain, a macero were originally an armed guard protecting the King of Castile; they were called macero due to the weapon they wielded, a maza (i.e., a mace). Otherwise, a normally more domestic servant could double (arming trusted household staff was not unusual) as macebearer, as in the case of the prophet Mohammed's first muezzin, Bilal ibn Ribah Ceremonial As for ceremonial maces, which symbolise the power or status of a monarch, institution or high dignitary, the duty to carry them in procession or other formal occasions may either be occasional and vested in an office otherwise named, or give its name to the office, either as a sinecure or in conjunction with other duties (sometimes indeed as an alternative title, as with some university officers, e.g. at St Andrews, the Bedelis is the chief mace bearer and at Oxford the bedels). His main day-to-day duties may be rather that of a general assistant, like say a driver's. In the Anglo-Saxon tradition, there usually is one post of mace-bearer per mace, and rarely more than one mace in use at the same time per master, or only in specific different contexts. Spanish macero bearing a tabard with the coat of arms of the city of Madrid. In French, the above-mentioned title massier is nowadays used for a mere huissier (a lowly post, door-keeper or usher) who occasionally carries a 'masse' when taking part in formal ceremonies, rather like a staff of office, as the mace is not given the same reverence as in the Anglo-Saxon tradition, indeed there may be several ones carried at the same time by staff of the same master, without any symbolism or tradition concerning the individual maces. In Spain, the macero mentioned above evolved to become the symbol of civil authority, usually associated with extra-royal institutions such as municipalities, local authorities, etc. When these institutions celebrate a formal ceremony, the macero will head any parade or surround the figures of authority. Similar to the French case, albeit they always wield a 'maza' (a mace), the mace itself does not bear the ceremonial reverence it does in the Anglo-Saxon tradition. Typically, the maceros are dressed in characteristic 15th century garment, and wear a tabard with the coat of arms of the institution they represent. A swordbearer is similar to a mace-bearer but carries a ceremonial sword rather than a ceremonial mace.

The Murerplan of 1576 Zürich has been continuously inhabited since Roman times. The vicus of Turicum was established in AD 90, at the site of an existing Gaulish (Helvetic) settlement. Gallo-Roman culture appears to have persisted beyond the collapse of the Western empire in the 5th century, and it is not until the Carolingian period. A royal castle was built at the site of the Lindenhof, and monasteries are established at Grossmünster and Fraumünster. Political power lay with these abbeys during Medieval times, until the guild revolt in the 14th century which led to the joining of the Swiss Confederacy. Zürich was the focus of the Swiss Reformation led by Huldrych Zwingli, and it came to riches with silk industry in Early Modern times. Early history Numerous lake-side settlements from the Neolithic and Bronze Age have been found, such as those in the Zürich Pressehaus and Zürich Mozartstrasse. The settlements were found in the 1800s, submerged in Lake Zürich. Located on the then swamp land between the Limmat and Lake Zürich around Sechseläutzenplatz on small islands and peninsulas in Zürich, Prehistoric pile dwellings around Lake Zürich were set on piles to protect against occasional flooding by the Linth and Jona. Zürich–Enge Alpenquai is located on Lake Zürich lakeshore in Enge, a locality of the municipality of Zürich. It was neighbored by the settlements at Kleiner Hafner and Grosser Hafner on a then peninsula respectively island in the effluence of the Limmat, within an area of about in the city of Zürich. As well as being part of the 56 Swiss sites of the UNESCO Worl Heritage Site Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps, the settlement is also listed in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance as a Class object. In 2004, traces of a previously unknown pre-Roman Celtic (La Tène culture) settlement were discovered, the center of which lay on the Lindenhof hill respectively the area around the Münsterhof square besides the Limmat. The Celtic Helvetians had a settlement when they were succeeded by the Romans, who established a custom station here for goods going to and coming from Italy. At the later Vicus Turicum, probably in the first 1st century BC or even much earlier, the Celts settled at the Lindenhof Oppidium. In 1890, so-called Potin lumps were found, whose largest weights at the Prehistoric pile dwelling settlement Alpenquai. The pieces consist of a large number of fused Celtic coins, which are mixed with charcoal remnants. Some of the 18,000 coins originate from the Eastern Gaul, others are of the Zürich type, that were assigned to the local Helvetii, which date to around 100 BC.Keltisches Geld in Zürich: Der spektakuläre «Potinklumpen».

A female who died in about 200 BC found buried in a carved tree trunk during a construction project at the Kern school complex in March 2017 in Aussersihl. Archaeologists revealed that she was approximately 40 years old when she died and likely carried out little physical labor when she was alive. A sheepskin coat, a belt chain, a fancy wool dress, a scarf and a pendant made of glass and amber beads were also discovered with the woman. The Roman Vicus Turicum first belonged to the province of Gallia Belgica, and to Germania superior from AD 90. Following Constantine's reform of the Empire in 318, the border between the praetorian prefectures of Gaul and Italy was just east of Turicum crossing the Linth between Lake Zürich and Walensee. Roman Turicum was not fortified, but there was a small garrison at the tax-collecting point, set up not exactly on the border, but downstream of Lake Zürich, where the goods entering Gaul were loaded onto larger ships. South of the castle, at the location of the St. Peter church, there was a temple to Jupiter. The earliest record of the town's name is preserved on a 2nd-century tombstone found in the 18th century on Lindenhof, referring to the Roman castle as \\"STA(tio) TUR(i)CEN(sis)\\". The area was Christianised along with the rest of the Roman Empire, during the 4th century. According to legend, saints Felix and Regula were executed at the location of the Wasserkirche in 286. The Alamanni settled in the Swiss plateau from the 5th century, but the Roman castle persisted into the 7th century. The earliest manuscript mention of the settlement, as castellum turegum, describes the mission of Columban in 610. An 8th-century list of toponyms from Ravenna mentions Ziurichi. There is a legendary account of an Alamannic duke Uotila residing on, and giving his name to, the Uetliberg. Holy Roman Empire Louis the German's act founding the Fraumünster abbey. Zürich was part of Frankish-ruled Alemannia from 746, following the blood court at Cannstatt, lying in the Turgowe (Thurgau) dominated by Konstanz. A Carolingian castle, built on the site of the now ruined Roman castle by the grandson of Charlemagne, Louis the German, is mentioned in 835 (\\"in castro Turicino iuxta fluvium Lindemaci\\"). Louis also founded the Fraumünster abbey on 21 July 853 for his daughter Hildegard. He endowed the Benedictine convent with the lands of Zürich, Uri, and the Albis forest, and granted the convent immunity, placing it under his direct authority. In the wake of this, during the 9th century, Zürich gradually acquired the characteristics of a medieval city. It was now the center of the separate county of Zürichgau, detached from the older county of Thurgau. The early city was dominated by the Fraumünster convent. In 1045, King Henry III granted the convent the right to hold markets, collect tolls, and mint coins, and thus effectively made the abbess the ruler of the city. The Frankish kings had special rights over their tenants, were the protectors of the two churches, and had jurisdiction over the free community. In. 870 the sovereign placed his powers over all four in the hands of a single official (the Reichsvogt), and the union was still further strengthened by the wall built round the four settlements in the 10th century as a safeguard against Saracen marauders and feudal barons. Zürich became reichsunmittelbar (direct control of the emperor) in 1218 with the extinction of the main line of the Zähringer family. A city wall was built during the 1230s, enclosing 38 hectares (about 94 acres). The Bahnhofstrasse marks the course of the western moat, Hirschengraben marks the eastern moat. The earliest citizens' stone houses at the Rennweg date to this period, using the dilapidated Carolingian castle as a quarry. Emperor Frederick II promoted the abbess of the Fraumünster to the rank of a duchess in 1234. The abbess assigned the mayor, and she frequently delegated the minting of coins to citizens of the city. The Reichsvogtei passed to the counts of Lenzburg (1063–1173), and then to the dukes of Zahringen (extinct 1218). Meanwhile, the abbess of the Benedictine Frau Münster had been acquiring extensive rights and privileges over all the inhabitants, though she never obtained the criminal jurisdiction. The town flourished greatly in the 12th and 13th centuries, the silk trade being introduced from Italy. In 1218 the Reichsvogtei passed back into the hands of the king, who appointed one of the burghers as his deputy, the town thus becoming a free imperial city under the nominal rule of a distant sovereign. The abbess in 1234 became a princess of the empire, but power rapidly passed from her to the council which she had originally named to look after police, but which came to be elected by the burghers, though the abess was still the lady of Zürich. This council (all powerful since 1304) was made up of the representatives of certain knightly and rich mercantile families (the patricians), who excluded the craftsmen from all share in the government, though it was to these last that the town was largely indebted for its rising wealth and importance. Predigerkirche was built in 1231 AD as a Romanesque church of the then Dominican Predigerkloster nearby the Neumarkt and the city's hospital. As the other convents in Zürich, it was abolished after the Reformation in Switzerland. In October 1291 the town made an alliance with Uri and Schwyz, and in 1292 failed in a desperate attempt to seize the Habsburg town of Winterthur. After that Zürich began to display strong Austrian leanings, which characterize much of its later history. In 1315 the men of Zürich fought against the Swiss Confederates at the Battle of Morgarten. The Codex Manesse, a major source of medieval German poetry, was written and illustrated in the early 14th century in Zürich. In the later medieval period, the political power of the convent slowly waned. The beginning of self- government came with the establishment of the Zunftordnung (guild laws) in 1336 by Rudolf Brun, who also became the first independent mayor, i.e. not assigned by the abbess. From this time, the city increasingly came under the domination of the Zünfte, a process only fully completed in the 16th century with the suspension of the monasteries following the Reformation. Under the new constitution (the main features of which lasted till 1798) the Little Council was made up of the burgomaster and thirteen members from the Constafel (which included the old patricians and the wealthiest burghers) and the thirteen masters of the craft guilds, each of the twenty-six holding office for six months. The Great Council of 200 (really 212) members consisted of the Little Council, plus 78 representatives each of the Constafel and of the guilds, besides 3 members named by the burgomaster. The office of burgomaster was created and given to Brun for life. Out of this change arose a quarrel with one of the branches of the Habsburg family, in consequence of which Brun was induced to throw in the lot of Zürich with the Swiss Confederation (May 1351). The double position of Zürich as a free imperial city and as a member of the Everlasting League was soon found to be embarrassing to both parties. In 1373 and again in 1393 the powers of the Constafel were limited and the majority in the executive secured to the craftsmen, who could then aspire to the burgomastership. Meanwhile, the town had been extending its rule far beyond its walls, a process which began in the 14th, and attained its height in the 15th century (1362–1467). =Old Swiss Confederacy= Citizens of Zürich on 1 May 1351 swear allegiance to representatives of Uri, Schwyz, Unterwalden and Lucerne, being read the Federal Charter (Luzerner Schilling). Zürich joined the Swiss confederation (which at that point was a loose confederation of de facto independent states) as the fifth member in 1351. Zürich was expelled from the confederation in 1440 due to a war with the other member states over the territory of Toggenburg (the Old Zürich War). Zürich was defeated in 1446, and re-admitted to the confederation in 1450. During the later half of the 15th century, Zürich managed to substantially increase the territory under its control, gaining the Thurgau (1460), Winterthur (1467), Stein am Rhein (1459/84) and Eglisau (1496). Zürich's position in the Confederacy was improved further with its role in the Burgundy Wars under Hans Waldmann. From 1468 to 1519, Zürich was the Vorort of the Federal Diet. This thirst for territorial aggrandizement brought about the first civil war in the Confederation (the \\"Old Zürich War,\\" 1436-50), in which, at the Battle of St. Jakob an der Sihl (1443), under the walls of Zürich, the men of Zürich were completely beaten and their burgomaster Stissi slain. The purchase of the town of Winterthur from the Habsburgs (1467) marks the culmination of the territorial power of the city. It was to the men of Zürich and their leader Hans Waldmann that the victory of Morat (1476) was due in the Burgundian War; and Zürich took a leading part in the Italian campaign of 1512–15, the burgomaster Schmid naming the new duke of Milan (1512). No doubt her trade connections with Italy led her to pursue a southern policy, traces of which are seen as early as 1331 in an attack on the Val Leventina and in 1478, when Zürich men were in the van at the fight of Giornico, won by a handful of Confederates over 12,000 Milanese troops. In 1400 the town obtained from the King Wenceslaus the Reichsvogtei, which carried with it complete immunity from the empire and the right of criminal jurisdiction. As early as 1393 the chief power had practically fallen into the hands of the Great Council, and in 1498 this change was formally recognized.

Illustration from the chronicle of Wernher Schodeler, c 1515. This transfer of all power to the guilds had been one of the aims of the burgomaster Hans Waldmann (1483–89), who wished to make Zürich a great commercial centre. He also introduced many financial and moral reforms, and subordinated the interests of the country districts to those of the town. He practically ruled the Swiss Confederation, and under him Zürich became the real capital of the League. But such great changes excited opposition, and he was overthrown and executed. His main ideas were embodied, however, in the constitution of 1498, by which the patricians became the first of the guilds, and which remained in force till 1798; some special rights were also given to the subjects in country districts. It was the prominent part taken by Zürich in adopting and propagating (against the strenuous opposition of the Constafel) the principles of the Reformation (the Fraumünster Abbey being suppressed in 1524) which finally secured for it the lead in the Confederation. The Augustiner and Prediger monasteries and Oetenbach nunnery and Rüti Abbey nearby Rapperswil were also disestablished in 1524. The aftermath of the Reformation in Zürich resulted also in the abolishment of the Zürich convent, the worship in the churches were discontinued, and the buildings and income of the monasteries were assigned to an according Amt, a bailiwick of administratively function of the city's government (Rat). =Reformation= The forces of Zürich are defeated in the battle of Kappel (1548 etching). Zwingli started the Swiss reformation at the time when he was the main preacher in Zürich at the Grossmünster. He started his preaching there by preaching systematically through Matthew which was a huge difference from almost every other priest that preached through the liturgical cycle of readings issued by the Church. 1727 thaler of Zürich, with the city on the reverse. He lived and preached in Zürich from 1484 until his death in 1531 at the defeat of Zürich in the second war of Kappel. Zwingli's Zürich Bible first appeared in 1531 and continued to be revised until the present day. Katharina von Zimmern (1478-1547), the last abbess of the Fraumünster Abbey, supported the peaceful introduction of the reformation in Zürich. =Early Modern history= Zürcher Zeitung, 12 January 1780 An important source for Zürich under Heinrich Bullinger is the Wickiana, a collection of curious documents from 1560 to 1587. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the patriciate and council of Zürich adopted an increasingly aristocratic and isolationist attitude. A sign of this was the second ring of impressive city ramparts was built in 1642 under the impression of the Thirty Years' War. The funds required for this ambitious project were imposed on the subject territories without consultation, resulting in revolts that were crushed by force. From 1648, the city changed its official status from Reichsstadt to Republik, thus likening itself to city republics like Venice and Genova. In the 17th and 18th centuries, a distinct tendency becomes observable in the town government to limit power to the actual holders. Thus the country districts were consulted for the last time in 1620 and 1640; and a similar breach of the charters of 1489 and 1531 (by which the consent of these districts was required for the conclusion of important alliances, war and peace, and might be asked for as to other matters) occasioned disturbances in 1777. The council of 200 came to be largely chosen by a small committee of the members of the guilds actually sitting in the council by the constitution of 1713 it consisted of 50 members of the Little Council (named for a fixed term by the Great Council), 18 members named by the Constafel, and 144 selected by the 12 guilds, these 162 (forming the majority) being co-opted for life by those members of the two councils who belonged to the gild to which the deceased member himself had belonged. Early in the 18th century a determined effort was made to crush by means of heavy duties the flourishing rival silk trade in Winterthur. It was reckoned that about 1650 the number of privileged burghers was 9000, while their rule extended over 170,000 persons. The first symptoms of active discontent appeared later among the dwellers by the lake, who founded in 1794 a club at Stäfa and claimed the restoration of the liberties of 1489 and 1531, a movement which was put down by force of arms in 1795. The old system of government perished in Zürich, as elsewhere in Switzerland, with the French invasion in the spring of 1798, and under the Helvetic constitution the country districts obtained political liberty.derived from Free Public Domain: Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition Modern history Zürich seen from the \\"Waid\\" around 1884 Limmatquai and Quaianlagen: Bellevueplatz and Bürkliplatz, Quaibrücke, Münsterbrücke and Münsterhof, and Rathausbrücke–Weinplatz, aerial photography by Eduard Spelterini in the probably mid-1890s. =Napoleonic era= Plan of Zürich in 1705 (Henricus Vogelius), showing the extent of the ramparts Zürich lost much of its power in the Helvetic Republic, with territory lost to the Aargau, the Thurgau and the Canton of Linth. In 1799, the city became even a battlefield of the French Revolutionary Wars of the Second Coalition, at the First Battle of Zürich in June and the Second Battle of Zürich in September. Gottfried Keller became an intellectual influence on the Radical \\"free-thinking\\" side in the formation of Switzerland as a federal state. The environs of Zürich are famous in military history on account of the two battles of 1799 (French Revolutionary Wars). In the first battle (4 June) the French under General André Masséna, on the defensive, were attacked by the Austrians under the Archduke Charles, Massena retiring behind the Limmat before the engagement had reached a decisive stage. The second and far more important battle took place on 25 and 26 September. Massena, having forced the passage of the Limmat, attacked and totally defeated the Russians and their Austrian allies under Korsakov's command. =19th century= In 1839, the city had to yield to the demands of its rural subjects, following the Züriputsch of 6 September. Most of the ramparts built in the 17th centuries were torn down, without ever having been sieged, to allay rural concerns over the city's hegemony. The Limmatquai was built in several stages between 1823 and 1859 along the right side of the Limmat. From 1847, the Spanisch-Brötli-Bahn, the first railway on Swiss territory, connected Zürich with Baden, putting the Zürich Hauptbahnhof at the origin of the Swiss rail network. The present building of the Hauptbahnhof dates to 1871. The emergence of the Sechseläuten as the city's (more properly, the Zünfte's) most prominent traditional holiday dates to this period. The Ötenbach monastery, founded 1285, fell victim to the increasingly grand city planning in 1902, with the entire Lindenhof hill it was built on removed to make way for the new Uraniastrasse and administration buildings. It had been serving as a prison, and the inmates were moved to the newly completed cantonal prison in Regensdorf. But under the cantonal constitution of 1814 matters were worse still, for the town (10,000 inhabitants) had 130 representatives in the Great Council, while the country districts (200,000 inhabitants) had only 82. A great meeting at Uster on 22 November 1830 demanded that two-thirds of the members in the Great Council should be chosen by the country districts. In 1831 a new constitution was drawn up on these lines, the town getting 71 representatives as against 141 allotted to the country districts, though it was not till 1837-38 that the town finally lost the last relics of the privileges which it had so long enjoyed as compared with the country districts. From 1803 to 1814 Zürich was one of the six directorial cantons, its chief magistrate becoming for a year the chief magistrate of the Confederation, while in 1815 it was one of the three cantons, the government of which acted for two years as the Federal government when the diet was not sitting. In 1833 Zürich tried hard to secure a revision of the Federal constitution and a strong central government. The town was the Federal capital for 1839–40, and consequently the victory of the Conservative party there in 1839 (due to indignation at the nomination by the Radical government to a theological chair in the university of David Strauss, the author of the famous Life of Jesus) caused a great stir throughout Switzerland. But when in 1845 the Radicals regained power at Zürich, which was again the Federal capital for 1845–46, that town took the lead in opposing the Sonderbund cantons. It of course voted in favor of the Federal constitutions of 1848 and of 1874, while the cantonal constitution of 1869 was remarkably advanced for the time. The enormous immigration from the country districts into the town from the \\"thirties\\" onwards created an industrial class which, though \\"settled\\" in the town, did not possess the privileges of burghership, and consequently had no share in the municipal government. First of all in 1860 the town schools, opened to \\"settlers\\" only on paying high fees, were made accessible to all, next in 1875 ten years' residence ipso facto conferred the right of burghership. The Quaianlagen and Quaibrücke are important milestones in the development of the modern city of Zürich, as by the construction of the new lake front, Zürich was transformed from the medieval small town on the Limmat and Sihl to an attractive modern city on the Lake Zürich lake shore, unter the guidance of the city engineer Arnold Bürkli. The town and canton continued to be on the Liberal, or Radical, or even Socialistic side, while from 1848 to 1907 they claimed 7 of the 37 members of the Federal executive or Bundesrat, these 7 having filled the presidential chair of the Confederation in twelve years, no canton surpassing this record. From 1833 onwards the walls and fortifications of Zürich were little by little pulled down, thus affording scope for the extension and beautification of the town. In 1915 the tenant organization Mieterverband was founded in Zürich. = Merger of municipalities = Kilchberg, Adliswil, Stallikon, Uitikon, Schlieren, Oberengstringen, Regensdorf, Rümlang, Opfikon, Wallisellen, Dübendorf, Fällanden, Maur and Zollikon. In 1893, the city was extended (grosse Eingemeindung) to include the (former) villages of Wollishofen, Enge, Leimbach, Wiedikon, Wipkingen, Fluntern and Hottingen, and the then-recently built-up areas of Aussersihl (formerly part of Wiedikon, a municipality since 1787), Oberstrass, Unterstrass, Riesbach and Hirslanden. In 1934, the city borders were again extended, to the inclusion of the former villages, by that time de facto suburbs, of Albisrieden, Altstetten, Höngg, Affoltern, Seebach, Oerlikon, Schwamendingen and Witikon (kleine Eingemeindung). There were no changes between 1934 and 2013, but occurred in all two further mergers (Eingemeindungen) of municipalities in the canton of Zürich. As per 1 January 2014 Bertschikon bei Attikon and Wiesendangen merged to Wiesendangen,Bertschikon and Wiesendangen merged to Wiesendangen on 1 January 2014. and on 1 January 2015 Bauma and Sternenberg merged to Bauma.Bauma and Sternenberg merged to Bauma on 1 January 2015. Therefore, the Canton of Zürich comprises now of 169 municipalities. =1940s to present= Zürich was accidentally bombed during World War II. An economic boom set in after World War II, lasting into the 1960s. The further, for that time extremely high subventions, but lacking of alternative governmental cultural programs for the youth in Zürich, occurred in 1980 to the so-called Opernhauskrawalle youth protests – Züri brännt, meaning Zürich is burning, documented in the Swiss documentary film Züri brännt (movie). The most prominent politician involved was Emilie Lieberherr, then member of the city's executive (Stadtrat) authorities. In 1982, communal elections resulted in the first conservative majority in 53 years (president Thomas Wagner 1982-1990), but in the early 1980s, Emilie Lieberherr and Ursula Koch where the first female politicians in Zürich's exekutive authority Stadtrat, both representing the social-democratic SP political party. From 1990, there has again been a leftist majority (presidents Josef Estermann 1990, Elmar Ledergerber 2002, Corine Mauch 2009, all of the Social Democratic Party). The introduction of liberal laws (Gastgewerbegesetz 1997) favoured the development of Zürich's role as regional center of nightlife; also during the 1990s, a liberalisation of zoning laws (Bau- und Zonenordnung 1992; Stadtforum 1996) led to a renewal of construction activity (Technopark 1991–93, Steinfels-Areal 1993, Zürich West 1998), Growing suburbanization since the 1960s had resulted in congestions due to commuting, partly eased with the Zürich S-Bahn, introduced 1990. Population declined during the 1980s to 1990s, but began to increase again in the 2000s, paired with significant gentrification of central areas. Demographic history Population of Zürich, 1830 to 2010. Note that there are discontinuities in 1893 and in 1934 due to the widening of the city borders (Eingemeindung). Zürich during its period of territorial expansion and prosperity during the late 14th to early 15th century increased in population to an estimated 7,000 inhabitants. This figure decreased rapidly as a result of the Old Zürich War, to some 5,000, comparable to the population of Berne, Schaffhausen or Lucerne. Population grew slowly but steadily during the 16th to 18th centuries, reaching 10,000 by 1800. Population then increased rapidly during the 19th century, due to industrialization, and the increased availability of building space after the destruction of the city walls in the 1830s, reaching 28,000 by 1888.Verzeichnis der Bürger der Stadt Zürich (1889). Counting the population within the modern city borders, the figures are 17'200 in 1800, 56,700 in 1871, 150,700 in 1900, and 251,000 in 1930. Population grew rapidly during 1945-1965, peaking at 440,000. After 1965, population declined due to suburbanization, to below 360,000 in the 1990s. After 2000, there has again been population growth, surpassing the 400,000 mark in 2014. 1962: 440,180 (maximum); 1980: 370,618; 1989: 355,901 (minimum); 1990: 356,352; 1995: 360,826; 2000: 360,980; 2005: 366,809; 2010: 385,468; January 2014: 400,028 (31.7% foreigners) stadt-zuerich.ch References See also *Fortifications of Zürich *Reformation in Zürich *Staatsarchiv Zürich *Timeline of Zürich *History of Switzerland Bibliography Zurich Zurich ","title":"History of Zürich"},{"id":"3919317","text":"The scarlet eggplant is a fruiting plant of the genus Solanum, related to the tomato and eggplant.

Roslavets was a convinced modernist and cosmopolitan thinker; his music was officially suppressed from 1930 onwards. Among his works are five symphonic poems (three of them are lost), two violin concertos, five string quartets, two viola sonatas, two cello sonatas, six violin sonatas, and five piano trios.  Life  There are three autobiographies by Roslavets that differ considerably from one another. In one of them, published 1924, the composer deliberately misrepresented his biographyLobanova 1997, 25ff. in order to prevent the attacks by the \\"Proletarian Musician\\" faction. There are differing accounts of Roslavets' birthplace, some indicating that he was born in Dushatynhttp://home.online.nl/ovar/roslavetz.htm (Nikolai Andreevich Roslavetz. Internet Edition compiled by Onno van Rijen) to a peasant family, while he actually was born in 1881 into the family of a railway clerk (of Ukrainian origin, according to Detlef Gojowy) posted in Konotop and Kursk, where Roslavets began to study violin, piano, theory of music and harmony in Arkady Abaza's musical classes.Lobanova 1997, 25–30 In 1902 Roslavets was accepted as a student at the Moscow Conservatory where he studied violin under Jan Hřímalý, free composition under Sergei Vasilenko, counterpoint, fugue and musical form under Mikhail Ippolitov-Ivanov and Alexander Ilyinsky. He graduated in 1912, with a silver medal for his cantata Heaven and Earth after Byron's verse drama. =Futurism= In the 1910s Roslavets' compositions were published in Russian Futurist journals, and futurist artists designed some covers for his music. After 1917 the composer became one of the most prominent public figures of \\"leftist art\\" in Russia, together with Arthur Lourié, Kazimir Malevich, Vsevolod Meyerhold and others. Roslavets taught violin and composition in Elets, Kharkiv (then known as Kharkov, where he was director of the Musical Institute)Lobanova 1997, 44 and Moscow. He had a position in the State Publishing House, edited the journal Muzykalnaya Kultura and was one of the leaders of the Association for Contemporary Music. =Musicology= As a musicologist, Roslavets fought for professionalism, the best in Russian, Western classical and New Music; criticizing vulgar identifications of music with ideology (exemplified in his article ‘On pseudo-proletarian music’). He wrote the first Russian article about Arnold Schoenberg's Pierrot Lunaire.Nikolaj Roslawez. \\"Pierrot lunaire von Arnold Schönberg. Übersetzung, Einleitung (Roslawez und Schönberg) und Kommentar von Marina Lobanova\\", Dissonanz 61/1999, pp. 22–27 This led to him being harshly attacked in the 1920s by the \\"proletarian musician\\" movement, especially by the representatives of the \\"RAPM\\" Russian Association of Proletarian Musicians and \\"Prokoll\\" (Production Collective of the Students at the Moscow Conservatory). Roslavets was accused of being a \\"counter-revolutionary\\" and \\"bourgeois\\" artist, \\"alien to the proletariat\\", as well as \\"formalist\\", a \\"class enemy\\" and in the late 1920s and early 1930s, a \\"Trotskyist\\", \\"saboteur\\"; etc.Lobanova 1997, pp. 60–72. =Political persecutions= In 1928 Roslavets' cantata October was played in the concert in Moscow celebrating the 10th anniversary of the Revolution. In 1930 Roslavets was accused of being a \\"protector\\" of the Association of the Moscow Authors which according to the group \\"Proletarian Musician\\" was promoting \\"light music\\" and \\"spreading of the counter-revolutionary literature\\". The \\"Roslavets case\\" was led by Viktor Bely, Alexandr Davidenko, V. Klemens, Yuri Keldysh, Semion Korev, Zara Levina, Georgi Polyanovsky, Alexey Sergeev and Boris Shekhter. It resulted in a professional prohibition of employment. In 1930 Roslavets was banned from obtaining a position as a political editor for two years. In order to save his life, Roslavets had to publicly repent for his former \\"political mistakes\\".Lobanova 1997, pp. 72–86. During 1932–33 he worked at the Musical Theater in Tashkent, now the capital of Uzbekistan. In 1933 the composer returned to Moscow, where he earned a meager living by teaching and taking occasional jobs. A victim of the political purges, Roslavets could get no official position for the remainder of his life. Roslavets was not admitted to the Composers' Union, instead he became a member of the Musical Fund. Punitive measures against him had been planned in 1938, and the former \\"proletarian musicians\\" had already spread disinformation about him; however Roslavets suffered a severe stroke in 1939 and was a disabled until his death following a second stroke in 1944.Lobanova 1997, pp. 87–95. His last publication, a song, appeared in 1942.Gojowy 1980, p. 329. He is buried in Vagan'kov cemetery in Moscow, and the authorities have now granted permission to mark his grave.Music of the Repressed Russian Avant-garde, 1900–1929 By Larry Sitsky, pg.41 Style While still a student, Roslavets had been engaged in vigorous artistic debates provoked by Russian Futurism, and was close to artists such as Kasimir Malevich, Aristarkh Lentulov, Vasily Kamensky, David Burlyuk and others. Deeply influenced by the later works of Alexander Scriabin and his mystic chord, Roslavets' quest for a personal language began not later than in 1907; it led to his propounding a \\"new system of sound organisation\\" based on \\"synthetic chords\\" that contain both the horizontal and vertical sound- material for a work (a concept close to that of Schoenberg's twelve-tone serialism). Following an article of Vyacheslav Karatygin, published in February 1915, Roslavets was sometimes referred to as \\"the Russian Schoenberg,\\" but in 1914 Nikolay Myaskovsky had already stressed the original nature of Roslavets' style. In an article published in 1925 the critic Yevgeni Braudo pointed out that this was no more helpful than calling Schoenberg \\"the German Debussy.\\" Although in the 1920s Roslavets criticized Scriabin because of his \\"oversimplification\\", the \\"new system of sound organisation\\" was first of all inspired by Scriabin's ideas and concepts as these were transmitted by Leonid Sabaneyev, a close friend of both Scriabin and Roslavets.Lobanova 1983; 1997, pp. 132–88; 2001; 2004, S. 226–232 1983; 1997; 2001 Though the \\"new system of sound organisation\\" regulates the whole twelve-tone chromatic scale, most of Roslavets’ \\"synthetic chords\\" consist of six to nine tones. In the 1920s Roslavets developed his system, expanding it to encompass counterpoint, rhythm, and musical form while elaborating new principles of teaching. In Roslavets' earlier romances and chamber instrumental compositions those sets were already elaborated side by side with expanded tonality and free atonality. The mature forms of this \\"new system of sound organization\\" are typical for the pieces composed between 1913 and 1917, such as Sad Landscapes (1913), Three Compositions for Voice and Piano (1913), String Quartet No. 1 (1913), Four Compositions for Voice and Piano (1913–14), and the Piano Sonatas Nos. 1 (1914) and 2 (1916, reconstructed by Eduard Babasian), etc.Lobanova 1983; 1997; 2001 After the Bolshevik revolution, Roslavets made an important contribution to the \\"revolutionary propaganda in music\\" in such compositions as the cantata October (1927) and numerous songs. However, his symphonic poem Komsomoliya (1928), demonstrates an extraordinary mastery, a very complex and highly modern compositional technique, far from the simplification typical for \\"propaganda works\\".Lobanova 1997, pp. 189–95, 208–11. In Tashkent, he turned for a while to working with folk material, producing among other works the first Uzbek ballet, Pakhta (Cotton). The works of his last years in Moscow show a simplification of his characteristic language to admit an expanded conception of tonality (for instance in the 24 Preludes for violin and piano), but are still highly professional.Lobanova 1997, pp. 231–34. Among Roslavets' later compositions, the Chamber symphony (1934–35) demonstrates one of the peaks of his \\"new system of sound organisation\\" in its later phase. Posthumous reputation After Roslavets's death his apartment was ransacked by a group of former \\"Proletarian Musicians\\" who confiscated many manuscripts. Roslavets's widow succeeded in hiding many manuscripts; afterwards she handed them over to TsGALI (Central state archive for literature and art, Moscow; now called RGALI, or Russian state archive for literature and art). Some manuscripts were kept by Roslavets's pupil, P. Teplov; now they are in the State Central Glinka-Museum for Musical Culture. In 1967 the composer's niece Efrosinya Roslavets undertook the first steps to rehabilitate her uncle. It has been found that the composer never submitted to the politically repressive measures. This important step, that the refusal to play Roslavets's compositions was justified for the reason that Roslavets belonged \\"to the arrested peoples’ enemies,\\" did not improve the situation; Roslavets's oeuvre was suppressed. In 1967 the employee of the Glinka-Museum, Georgi Kirkor, refused Efrosinya Roslavets access to the museum's materials; Kirkor declared Nikolai Roslavets \\"to be alien to the people\\" and accused the composer of \\"relations with the world of Zionism\\".E.Roslavets' letter to M. Lobanova from 22.06.1987; cited in: Lobanova 1997, p. 48. This dangerous accusation was caused by the fact that Leonid Sabaneyev, a close friend of Roslavets, had promoted Jewish music; the ASM had also promoted Jewish composers. For thirty years, Roslavets's name, expunged from the musical dictionaries, was hardly mentioned in Soviet musical literature. His name reappeared in a Soviet musical dictionary in 1978 in a negative context. Typical of the highly negative official attitude towards Roslavets were sentences like those: \\"Roslavets is our enemy,\\" \\"he is a composer whose music is not worth the paper on which it is written down,\\" \\"Roslavets's tomb should be destroyed.\\"Lobanova 1997, pp. 11–12. In the West, Detlef Gojowy (1934–2008) had been promoting Roslavets. For his activities Gojowy was constantly ideologically attacked on behalf of the officials of the Soviet Composers' Union, in particular personally by Tikhon Khrennikov, and the magazine \\"Soviet Music.\\" Until 1989, Gojowy was treated as a \\"militant anti-communist\\" and a persona non grata. The copies of his articles which the journalist sent to his Soviet colleagues were confiscated by the Soviet customs; Gojowy himself was not allowed to get a Soviet visa.Gojowy 2008, pp. 11–12. =Revival= On December, 27th 1980 a concert took place at Mark Milman's club for Chamber music; a section of this concert was devoted to Roslavets's music. According to Edison Denisov, the leaders of the Composers' Union of the Soviet Union banned a concert entirely devoted to the composer. After the first publication about Roslavets's original theoretical concept, based on archival materials (Lobanova 1983) had appeared, M. Lobanova's lecture on Roslavets's musical-theoretical system, declared in the program of the international conference \\"Musica nel nostro tempo\\" (Milan) was forbidden in 1984: leading functionaries of the Composers' Union of the Soviet Union had accused the researcher of \\"illegal contacts to the West.\\" After that, dismissal by Lobanova from the Moscow conservatory was attempted as well as deprivation of her scientific degree and rights for teaching; soon, they tried to use an application of retaliatory psychiatry with the dissident diagnosis against Lobanova.Gojowy D.

Mainz 1991, S. 9–22 In 1989 Efrosinja Roslavets requested the Moscow composer organisation, that had just proclaimed itself to be independent from Tikhon Khrennikov's Composers' Union of the Soviet Union, to reconstruct and publish Roslavets's works and to restore Roslavets's grave.Lobanova M.

Nikolai Andreyevich Roslavets i kultura ego vremeni (St. Petersburg: Petroglif, 2011), pp. 11–21. In 1990, with the assistance of the head of the Moscow composer organisation, Georgi Dmitriev, Roslavets's grave was identified and restored. Later Roslavets's grave was destroyed again, and all protests remain till now unsuccessful.Lobanova M. Nikolai Andreyevich Roslavets i kultura ego vremeni (St. Petersburg: Petroglif, 2011), p. 13.

Note that the first parliament of the United Kingdom was held in 1801; parliaments between 1707 and 1800 were either parliaments of Great Britain or of Ireland). For Acts passed up until 1707 see List of Acts of the Parliament of England and List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland. For Acts passed from 1707 to 1800 see List of Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain. See also the List of Acts of the Parliament of Ireland. For Acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the List of Acts of the Scottish Parliament from 1999, the List of Acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the List of Acts and Measures of the National Assembly for Wales; see also the List of Acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland. The number shown after each Act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \\"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\\", meaning the 67th Act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign. Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \\"41 Geo. 3\\" rather than \\"41 Geo. III\\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \\"41 Geo. 3\\". Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.  1900–1909  = 1900 = 63 & 64 Vict. * Agricultural Holdings Act 1900 c. 50 * Ancient Monuments Protection Act 1900 c. 34 * Appropriation Act 1900 c. 57 * Army (Annual) Act 1900 c. 5 * Beer Retailers' and Spirit Grocers' Retail Licences (Ireland) Act 1900 c. 30 * Burial Act 1900 c. 15 * Census (Great Britain) Act 1900 c. 4 * Census (Ireland) Act 1900 c. 6 * Charitable Loan Societies (Ireland) Act 1900 c. 25 * Colonial Solicitors Act 1900 c. 14 * Colonial Stock Act 1900 c. 62 * Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act 1900 c. 12 (note that the short title as given in the Act itself omits the year) * Companies Act 1900 c. 48 * Consolidated Fund (No. 1) Act 1900 c. 1 * Consolidated Fund (No. 2) Act 1900 c. 3 * County Councils (Elections) Amendment Act 1900 c. 13 * County Courts (Investment) Act 1900 c. 47 * County Surveyors (Ireland) Act 1900 c. 18 * District Councillors and Guardians (Term of Office) Act 1900 c. 16 * Ecclesiastical Assessments (Scotland) Act 1900 c. 20 * Electoral Disabilities (Military Service) Removal Act 1900 c. 8 * Elementary Education Act 1900 c. 53 * Elementary School Teachers Superannuation (Isle of Man) Act 1900 c. 38 * Elementary School Teachers Superannuation (Jersey) Act 1900 c. 40 * Executors (Scotland) Act 1900 c. 55 * Expiring Laws Continuance Act 1900 c. 37 * Exportation of Arms Act 1900 c. 44 * Finance Act 1900 c. 7 * Housing of the Working Classes Act 1900 c. 59 * Inebriates Amendment (Scotland) Act 1900 c. 28 * Intermediate Education (Ireland) Act 1900 c. 43 * Isle of Man (Customs) Act 1900 c. 31 * Land Charges Act 1900 c. 26 * Land Registry (New Buildings) Act 1900 c. 19 * Local Government (Ireland) Act 1900 c. 63 * Local Government (Ireland) (No. 2) Act 1900 c. 41 * London County Council Electors Qualification Act 1900 c. 29 * Lunacy Board (Scotland) Salaries and Clerks Act 1900 c. 54 * Members of Local Authorities Relief Act 1900 c. 46 * Merchant Shipping (Liability of Shipowners and others) Act 1900 c. 32 * Military Lands Act 1900 c. 56 * Mines (Prohibition of Child Labour Underground) Act 1900 c. 21 * Money-lenders Act 1900 c. 51 * Naval Reserve Act 1900 c. 52 * Naval Reserve (Mobilisation) Act 1900 c. 17 * Oil in Tobacco Act 1900 c. 35 * Police Reservists (Allowances) Act 1900 c. 9 * Poor Relief (Ireland) Act 1900 c. 45 * Poor Removal Act 1900 c. 23 * Public Health (Ireland) Act 1900 c. 10 * Public Works Loans Act 1900 c. 36 * Railway Employment (Prevention of Accidents) Act 1900 c. 27 * Reserve Forces Act 1900 c. 42 * Supplemental War Loan Act 1900 c. 61 * Tithe Rentcharge (Ireland) Act 1900 c. 58 * Town Councils (Scotland) Act 1900 c. 49 * Tramways (Ireland) Act 1900 c. 60 * Uganda Railway Act 1900 c. 11 * Veterinary Surgeons Amendment Act 1900 c. 24 * Volunteer Act 1900 c. 39 * War Loan Act 1900 c. 2 * Wild Animals in Captivity Protection Act 1900 c. 33 * Workmen's Compensation Act 1900 c. 22 64 Vict.

Note that the first parliament of the United Kingdom was held in 1801; parliaments between 1707 and 1800 were either parliaments of Great Britain or of Ireland). For Acts passed up until 1707 see List of Acts of the Parliament of England and List of Acts of the Parliament of Scotland. For Acts passed from 1707 to 1800 see List of Acts of the Parliament of Great Britain. See also the List of Acts of the Parliament of Ireland. For Acts of the devolved parliaments and assemblies in the United Kingdom, see the List of Acts of the Scottish Parliament from 1999, the List of Acts of the Northern Ireland Assembly, and the List of Acts and Measures of the National Assembly for Wales; see also the List of Acts of the Parliament of Northern Ireland. The number shown after each Act's title is its chapter number. Acts passed before 1963 are cited using this number, preceded by the year(s) of the reign during which the relevant parliamentary session was held; thus the Union with Ireland Act 1800 is cited as \\"39 & 40 Geo. 3 c. 67\\", meaning the 67th Act passed during the session that started in the 39th year of the reign of George III and which finished in the 40th year of that reign. Note that the modern convention is to use Arabic numerals in citations (thus \\"41 Geo. 3\\" rather than \\"41 Geo. III\\"). Acts of the last session of the Parliament of Great Britain and the first session of the Parliament of the United Kingdom are both cited as \\"41 Geo. 3\\". Acts passed from 1963 onwards are simply cited by calendar year and chapter number.  1920 - 1929  =1920 (10 & 11 Geo. 5)= Public General Acts * Administration of Justice Act 1920 c. 81 * Agriculture

Lyndon word is a nonempty string that is strictly smaller in lexicographic order than all of its rotations. Lyndon words are named after mathematician Roger Lyndon, who investigated them in 1954, calling them standard lexicographic sequences.. Anatoly Shirshov introduced Lyndon words in 1953 calling them regular words.. Lyndon words are a special case of Hall words; almost all properties of Lyndon words are shared by Hall words. Definitions Several equivalent definitions exist. A k-ary Lyndon word of length n > 0 is an n-character string over an alphabet of size k, and which is the unique minimum element in the lexicographical ordering in the multiset of all its rotations. Being the singularly smallest rotation implies that a Lyndon word differs from any of its non-trivial rotations, and is therefore aperiodic.; . Alternately, a word w is a Lyndon word if and only if it is nonempty and lexicographically strictly smaller than any of its proper suffixes, that is w < v for all nonempty words v such that w = uv and u is nonempty. Another characterisation is the following: A Lyndon word has the property that it is nonempty and, whenever it is split into two nonempty substrings, the left substring is always lexicographically less than the right substring. That is, if w is a Lyndon word, and w = uv is any factorization into two substrings, with u and v understood to be non-empty, then u < v. This definition implies that a string w of length ≥ 2 is a Lyndon word if and only if there exist Lyndon words u and v such that u < v and w = uv. Although there may be more than one choice of u and v with this property, there is a particular choice, called the standard factorization, in which v is as long as possible.. Enumeration The Lyndon words over the two-symbol binary alphabet {0,1}, sorted by length and then lexicographically within each length class, form an infinite sequence that begins :0, 1, 01, 001, 011, 0001, 0011, 0111, 00001, 00011, 00101, 00111, 01011, 01111, ... The first string that does not belong to this sequence, \\"00\\", is omitted because it is periodic (it consists of two repetitions of the substring \\"0\\"); the second omitted string, \\"10\\", is aperiodic but is not minimal in its permutation class as it can be cyclically permuted to the smaller string \\"01\\". The empty string also meets the definition of a Lyndon word of length zero. The numbers of binary Lyndon words of each length, starting with length zero, form the integer sequence :1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 18, 30, 56, 99, 186, 335, ... Lyndon words correspond to aperiodic necklace class representatives and can thus be counted with Moreau's necklace-counting function. provides details of these counts for Lyndon words and several related concepts. Generation provides an efficient algorithm for listing the Lyndon words of length at most n with a given alphabet size s in lexicographic order. If w is one of the words in the sequence, then the next word after w can be found by the following steps: #Repeat the symbols from w to form a new word x of length exactly n, where the ith symbol of x is the same as the symbol at position (i mod length(w)) of w. #As long as the final symbol of x is the last symbol in the sorted ordering of the alphabet, remove it, producing a shorter word. #Replace the final remaining symbol of x by its successor in the sorted ordering of the alphabet. The worst-case time to generate the successor of a word w by this procedure is O(n). However, if the words being generated are stored in an array of length n, and the construction of x from w is performed by adding symbols onto the end of w rather than by making a new copy of w, then the average time to generate the successor of w (assuming each word is equally likely) is constant. Therefore, the sequence of all Lyndon words of length at most n can be generated in time proportional to the length of the sequence.. A constant fraction of the words in this sequence have length exactly n, so the same procedure can be used to efficiently generate words of length exactly n or words whose length divides n, by filtering out the generated words that do not fit these criteria. Standard factorization According to the Chen–Fox–Lyndon theorem, every string may be formed in a unique way by concatenating a sequence of Lyndon words, in such a way that the words in the sequence are nonincreasing lexicographically.. write that although this is commonly credited to , and follows from results in that paper, it was not stated explicitly until . It was formulated explicitly by , see . The final Lyndon word in this sequence is the lexicographically smallest suffix of the given string.. A factorization into a nonincreasing sequence of Lyndon words (the so-called Lyndon factorization) can be constructed in linear time. Lyndon factorizations may be used as part of a bijective variant of the Burrows–Wheeler transform for data compression,; . and in algorithms for digital geometry.. Such factorizations can be written (uniquely) as finite binary trees, with the leaves labelled by the alphabet, with each rightward branch given by the final Lyndon word in the sequence. Amy Glen, \\"Combinatorics of Lyndon Words\\" (2012) Such trees are sometimes called standard bracketings and can be taken as factorization of the elements of a free group or as the basis elements for a free Lie algebra. These trees are a special case of Hall trees (as Lyndon words are a special case of Hall words), and so likewise, the Hall words provide a standard order, called the commutator collecting process for groups, and basis for Lie algebras. Guy Melançon, (1992) \\"Combinatorics of Hall trees and Hall words\\", Journal of Combinatoric Theory, 59A(2) pp. 285–308. Guy Melançon and Christophe Reutenauer (1989), \\"Lyndon words, free algebras and shuffles\\", Canadian Journal of Mathematics. 41, No. 4, pp. 577-591. Christophe Hohlweg and Christophe Reutenauer, \\"Lyndon words, permutations and trees\\", (2003) LaCIM Indeed, they provide an explicit construction for the commutators appearing in the Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem needed for the construction of universal enveloping algebras. Every Lyndon word can be understood as a permutation, the suffix standard permutation. =Duval algorithm= developed an algorithm for finding the standard factorization that runs in linear time and constant space. It iterates over a string trying to find as long a Lyndon word as possible. When it finds one, it adds it to the result list and proceeds to search the remaining part of the string. The resulting list of strings is the standard factorization of the given string. More formal description of the algorithm follows. Given a string S of length N, one should proceed with the following steps: #Let m be the index of the symbol-candidate to be appended to the already collected symbols. Initially, m = 1 (indices of symbols in a string start from zero). #Let k be the index of the symbol we would compare others to. Initially, k = 0. #While k and m are less than N, compare S[k] (the k-th symbol of the string S) to S[m]. There are three possible outcomes: ##S[k] is equal to S[m]: append S[m] to the current collected symbols. Increment k and m. ##S[k] is less than S[m]: if we append S[m] to the current collected symbols, we'll get a Lyndon word. But we can't add it to the result list yet because it may be just a part of a larger Lyndon word. Thus, just increment m and set k to 0 so the next symbol would be compared to the first one in the string. ##S[k] is greater than S[m]: if we append S[m] to the current collected symbols, it will be neither a Lyndon word nor a possible beginning of one. Thus, add the first m-k collected symbols to the result list, remove them from the string, set m to 1 and k to 0 so that they point to the second and the first symbol of the string respectively. #When m > N, it is essentially the same as encountering minus infinity, thus, add the first m-k collected symbols to the result list after removing them from the string, set m to 1 and k to 0, and return to the previous step. #Add S to the result list. Connection to de Bruijn sequences If one concatenates together, in lexicographic order, all the Lyndon words that have length dividing a given number n, the result is a de Bruijn sequence, a circular sequence of symbols such that each possible length-n sequence appears exactly once as one of its contiguous subsequences. For example, the concatenation of the binary Lyndon words whose length divides four is : 0 0001 0011 01 0111 1 This construction, together with the efficient generation of Lyndon words, provides an efficient method for constructing a particular de Bruijn sequence in linear time and logarithmic space.According to , the sequence generated in this way was first described (with a different generation method) by , and the connection between it and Lyndon words was observed by . Additional properties and applications Lyndon words have an application to the description of free Lie algebras, in constructing a basis for the homogeneous part of a given degree; this was Lyndon's original motivation for introducing these words.. Lyndon words may be understood as a special case of Hall sets. For prime p, the number of irreducible monic polynomials of degree d over the field \\\\mathbb{F}_p is the same as the number of Lyndon words of length d in an alphabet of p symbols; they can be placed into explicit correspondence.Solomon W. Golomb (1969) \\"Irreducible polynomials, synchronizing codes, primitive necklaces and cyclotomic algebra\\", Proc. Conf Combinatorial Mathematics and its Applications, pp.358--370 (University of North Carolina). A theorem of Radford states that a shuffle algebra over a field of characteristic 0 can be viewed as a polynomial algebra over the Lyndon words. More precisely, let A be an alphabet, let k be a field of characteristic 0 (or, more general, a commutative ℚ-algebra), and let R be the free noncommutative k-algebra . The words over A can then be identified with the \\"noncommutative monomials\\" (i.e., products of the xa) in R; namely, we identify a word (a1,a2,...,an) with the monomial xa1xa2...xan. Thus, the words over A form a k-vector space basis of R. Then, a shuffle product is defined on R; this is a k-bilinear, associative and commutative product, which is denoted by ш, and which on the words can be recursively defined by :1 ш v = v for any word v; :u ш 1 = u for any word u; :ua ш vb = (u ш vb)a + (ua ш v)b for any a,b ∈ A and any words u and v. The shuffle algebra on the alphabet A is defined to be the additive group R endowed with ш as multiplication. Radford's theorem now states that the Lyndon words are algebraically independent elements of this shuffle algebra, and generate it; thus, the shuffle algebra is isomorphic to a polynomial ring over k, with the indeterminates corresponding to the Lyndon words.

The Buddha's hands are in the bhūmisparśa mudrā (Earth-touching position). Haw Phra Kaew temple, Viang Chan, Laos The iconography of Gautama Buddha in Laos and Thailand recall specific episodes during his travels and teachings that are familiar to the Buddhists according to an iconography with specific rules. The Buddha is always represented with certain physical attributes, and in specified dress and specified poses. Each pose, and particularly the position and gestures of the Buddha's hands, has a defined meaning which is familiar to Buddhists. In other Buddhist countries, different but related iconography is used, for example the mudras in Indian art. Certain ones of these are considered particularly auspicious for those born on particular days of the week. Introduction The Reclining Buddha For Buddhists, the correct depiction of the Buddha is not an anabolistic matter; Buddhists believe that a properly rendered Buddha image is a hypostasis: an actual spiritual emanation of the Buddha, which possesses supernatural qualities. Although the Buddha is not a god, Buddhists seek to communicate with the supernatural world through Buddha images, making offerings to them and praying before them. Leela Buddha image (Wat Doi Suthep, Chiang Mai, Thailand) Buddha images are not intended to be naturalistic representations of what Gautama Buddha looked like. There are no contemporary images of him, and the oldest Buddha images date from 500 to 600 years after his lifetime. But Buddhists believe that Buddha images represent an ideal reality of the Buddha, and that every Buddha image stands at the end of a succession of images reaching back to the Buddha himself. When creating a Buddha image, the artist is expected to be in a spiritual and mental state (samādhi) that will enable him to visualise this ideal reality. There is no requirement that every Buddha image be identical, and in fact there is a wide variety of artistic styles and national traditions in representing the Buddha. There are, however, certain rules of representation that must be adhered to. Development The current range of postures in which the Buddha may be shown, and the gestures which may be depicted, evolved over the first millennium of the Buddhist era (roughly 500 BCE to 500 CE), mainly in India, the original homeland of Buddhism. The tradition of images that reached South-East Asia had been changed in the later 5th century CE, apparently first at Sarnath in India. The new \\"Sarnath image type\\" or \\"Gupta period Buddhist image\\" differs from earlier Buddha images, such as those in Greco-Buddhist art, in a number of respects: the gaze is lowered, the clinging robes disclose no male genital bulge, the robe lacks folds, and there are different body proportions.Brown, Robert L., pp. 318-319, \\"The Importance of Gupta-period Sculpture in Southeast Asian Art History\\", in Early Interactions Between South and Southeast Asia: Reflections on Cross-cultural Exchange, Editors Pierre-Yves Manguin, A. Mani, Geoff Wade, 2011, Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, , 9789814311168, google books In the early part of this period, the Buddha was usually shown giving a general gesture of benediction, with the right hand held at shoulder-height with the palm facing forward and the fingers together and slightly bent. By the end of the Gupta Empire (about 550 CE), the canon of representation had become more varied, with the seated meditative position (dhyāna mudrā - see below) becoming common, particularly in Sri Lanka. By the 7th century CE the canon was largely as it is seen today. Statue of the Buddha with his hand upraised in the abhāya mudrā position. Walking in the Leela attitude, he is draped with monastic robes, with the right shoulder bare. (Phutthamonthon, Thailand) As Buddhism spread from India to other countries, variations in the depiction of the Buddha evolved. This article describes the canon of Buddha representation in Thailand and Laos. This canon was not formalised until the 19th century, as part of the general project of \\"modernisation\\" that followed the Buddhist world's encounter with Western civilisation. A key figure in this process was the Siamese royal prince and Buddhist monk Paramanuchit Chinorot, a son of King Rama I, who in 1814 was appointed administrator of the Wat Pho royal temple in Bangkok. At the request of King Rama III, Paramanuchit described and represented 40 different postures of the Buddha in an illustrated treatise called Pathama Sambodhikatha. Some of these, such as \\"Buddha threading a needle,\\" were new, although justified through reference to the literary accounts of the Buddha's life. Paramanuchit's illustrations were later rendered as bronze miniatures, which can be seen today at Wat Phra Kaew in Bangkok and serve as templates for the creation of modern Buddhist imagery. Attributes of the Buddha Reclining Buddha (Wat Xieng Thong, Luang Phrabāng, Laos) The Dīgha Nikāya, a Pāli text of the 1st century BCE, gives a list of 32 physical attributes of the Buddha. Some of these are poetic or fanciful (\\"legs like an antelope's,\\" \\"ankles like rounded shells\\"), while others are more specific: feet with level tread, projecting heels, long and slender fingers and toes, a tuft of hair between the eyebrows. Although it is not required that Buddha images reflect all of these attributes, many of them have acquired canonical status. Most curiously, the Buddha is said to have had a protuberance on the top of his skull, the usnīsa. This is sometimes shown as a spire or spike, and sometimes only as a small bump. The Buddha always has a serene expression or a faint smile. The Buddha is also always depicted with very long earlobes. This is attributed to his earlier life as a prince, weighed down by material possession, but has since come to symbolize wisdom.Why do statues of Buddha have long earlobes? What's the difference between fat Buddha and regular Buddha? (2007) Straight Dope Posture and dress The Buddha may be depicted in one of four postures: *Sitting: If seated, the Buddha may be shown in one of three different positions :In the \\"heroic posture\\" (vīrāsana), with the legs folded over each other :In the \\"adamantine posture\\" (vajrāsana; also known as \\"lotus position\\"), with the legs crossed so that the soles of both feet are turned up :In the position of a person sitting in a chair (pralambanāsana) *Standing: If standing, the Buddha may be shown either with his feet together, or with one foot forward *Walking *Reclining: The reclining posture may represent the Buddha resting or sleeping, but more usually represents the mahāparinabbāna: the Buddha's final state of enlightenment before his death Bunleua Sulilat's Buddha Park. The Buddha is nearly always depicted wearing a monastic robe, of the type worn by Buddhist monks today. The robe may be shown as worn in the \\"covering mode\\" (draped over both shoulders) or in the \\"open mode\\" (leaving the right shoulder and breast uncovered). The robe is a representation of the Buddha's humility. (Gautama was originally a prince, who renounced the world to seek enlightenment, and his original robe was made from the shroud of a corpse.) The robe is sometimes shown as diaphanous, transparent or billowing mysteriously, suggesting the spiritual power emanating from the Buddha. Buddha images are often draped with real robes, which are renewed periodically, usually at major festivals. The Buddha may also be shown wearing royal attire, but this is uncommon. Hand gestures Statue of \\"the Buddha meditating.\\" The Buddha's hands are in the dhyāna mudrā position (Wat Xieng Thong, Luang Phrabāng, Laos) The most important aspect of the iconography of the Buddha is gestures made with the hands, known as mudrā. These gestures have meanings which are known throughout the Buddhist world, and when combined with the postures described above, give a complete representation, usually associated with a particular incident in the life of the Buddha. The six mudrā associated with the Buddha are: *Touching the earth (Bhūmiśparṣa mudrā) (มารวิชัย; pang maa-rá-wí-chai): the right arm rests on the right thigh with the fingers pointing downwards, but not always touching the earth (as can be seen in the image at the top of this page). The left hand rests in the dhyāna mudrā position in the Buddha's lap. This mudrā is called in Pāḷi and Sanskrit \\"calling the earth to witness (to his fulfilment of the perfections, pāramī). In Thai it is known as \\"Buddha subduing Māra\\" (the demon who tried to prevent him attaining enlightenment by various means). This is by far the most commonly depicted mudrā. *Meditation (Dhyāna mudrā) :th:ปางสมาธิ pang sà-măa-tí: the hands are shown lying flat in the Buddha's lap, palms upward. This mudrā is associated with a seated Buddha. It shows that the Buddha is disciplining his mind through mental concentration, a necessary step to achieving enlightenment. *Charity (Varana mudrā) :th:ปางประทานพร pang bprà-taan pon: the right arm is shown pendent (extended downwards), with the open palm turned to the front and the fingers extended. This mudrā is usually associated with a standing Buddha. This position can signify either that the Buddha is granting blessings or receiving charitable offerings. *Fearlessness (Abhāya mudrā) :th:ปางประทานอภัย pang bprà-taan à-pai: either one or both arms are shown bent at the elbow and the wrist, with the palm facing outwards and the fingers pointing upwards. It shows the Buddha either displaying fearlessness in the face of adversity, or enjoining others to do so. Right hand raised is also called \\"calming animals\\" :th:ปางโปรดสัตว์ pang pròht sàt; both hands raised is also called \\"forbidding the relatives\\" :th:ปางห้ามญาติ pang ham yat. These 'mudrā are usually associated with a standing Buddha, but seated representations are not uncommon. Statue of \\"the Buddha preaching on reason,\\" with the Buddha's hands in the double abhāya mudrā position (Luang Phrabāng, Laos) *Reasoning and exposition (Vitarka mudrā): the arm and hand are positioned in the same manner as in the abhāya mudrā, except that the thumb and forefinger are brought together. The gesture can be made with either the right or left hand (usually the right), but not both. This mudra signifies an appeal to reason, or the giving of instruction. Since the Buddha is appealing to reason, the gesture is often interpreted as an appeal for peace. *Setting the wheel in motion (Dharmachakrā mudrā): the hands are held in front of the chest, with both hands in the vitarka mudrā position, with the fingers of the left hand resting in the palm of the right hand. This is a less common mudrā since it refers to a particular episode in the Buddha's life: his first sermon, when he \\"set the wheel (of his life's work) in motion.\\" It can be used for both seated and standing images. Over the centuries combinations and variations of these six mudrā have evolved. For example, the \\"double abhāya mudrā\\", with both hands held up in the abhāya mudrā position, became common in Thailand and Laos in the 16th century, and is now one of the most common representations of the Buddha in south-east Asian countries. It is sometimes interpreted as \\"Buddha teaching on reason.\\" As artists wished to depict more of the specific incidents in the life of the Buddha, new, secondary mudrās evolved, such as \\"Buddha holding an alms bowl\\", \\"Buddha receiving a mango\\" and Buddha performing various miracles. Many of these originated in Burma and then spread to other parts of the Buddhist world.  Attitudes of Buddha icons in Thai art  There are acceptably 80 attitudes (; Paang, Paang Phra Phutta Roupe) existed in Thai art. However, only fews could be commonly founded throughout most temples and amongst those displayed individually. The list below consists of several common paang of Buddha in Thai art.translated from :th:ปางพระพุทธรูป on Thai Wikipedia * Leela attitude: walking attitude of Buddha, believed to be pioneered in the Sukhothai period; according to Thai beliefs, it depicts the Buddha episode of walking down to earth from the heaven. * Maravijaya attitude: sitting attitude of Buddha with one hand lying down to the ground and the other on his lap * Mediation attitude: mediating Buddha, the most founded one * Nirvana Attitude: known as the reclining buddha * Naga Prok attitude: the seated mediating Buddha with Nāga covering himself See also *Budai and its entry for Phra Sangkadchai/Phra Sangkachai, pot- bellied figures sometimes confused with the Buddha, as well as with each other *Buddha images in Thailand (provides historical perspective) *Lao Buddhist sculpture *Easily confused Buddhist representations *U Thong Style, 12th to 15th century Thailand References Sources *Gestures of the Buddha, K.I.Matics, Chulalongkorn University Press, Bangkok 2004 *Untitled booklet, Khochone Keomanivong et al., Ho Phra Kaeo Museum, Viang Chan, Laos (undated) External links *The Life of the Buddha in 80 Scenes from the Ananda Temple, Bagan, Myanmar *Images of Buddha - worldwide submitted photos *Buddhist iconography in Thailand *Thai Buddha Images for the Days of the Week Category:Buddhist art Category:Buddhist iconography Category:Laotian art Category:Thai Buddhist art and architecture Category:Buddhism in Laos Category:Cultural depictions of Gautama Buddha Category:Buddha statues in Thailand ","title":"Iconography of Gautama Buddha in Laos and Thailand"},{"id":"3919375","text":"HMS Tenedos (Pennant number initially FA4 and later H04) was an Admiralty 'S' class destroyer. Laid down on 6 December 1917, she was constructed by Hawthorn Leslie of Tyne, and was completed in 1918. She was commissioned in 1919 and served throughout the interwar period. Construction and design Tenedos was ordered from the Tyneside shipbuilding company Hawthorn Leslie on 23 June 1917, as part of the Twelfth War Programme, one of 36 destroyers ordered on that date, including four Admiralty S-class destroyers ordered from Leslies. Tenedos was long overall and between perpendiculars, with a beam of and a draught of . Displacement was standard and full load. Three Yarrow boilers fed steam at to two sets of Brown-Curtiss single-reduction steam turbines rated at at 360 rpm which in turn drove two propeller shafts. This gave a speed of . of oil could be carried, giving a range of at . The ship had a crew of 90 officers and men. Three 4 inch (102 mm) guns were carried, together with a single 2-pounder (40 mm) \\"pom-pom\\" anti-aircraft gun. Torpedo armament was four 21 inch (533 mm) torpedo tubes in two twin rotating mounts and two 18 inch tubes at the break of the ship's forecastle for snap shots at close range. Later ships of the class had the 18 inch tubes left off, while they were removed from the ships that were fitted to them between the wars. Tenedos was laid down at Leslie's Hebburn shipyard on 6 December 1917, launched on 21 October 1918 and completed in July 1919. Service Tenedos commissioned later in 1919, joining the 4th Destroyer Flotilla of the Atlantic Fleet. On 7 February 1936, the Daunt Rock lightship broke free from her moorings near Cork Harbour. Attempts by Tenedos to take the drifting lightship under tow were unsuccessful, and the crew of the lightship were eventually rescued by the Ballycotton lifeboat. Tenedos was transferred to the China Station (as the Royal Navy's forces in the West Pacific, Singapore and China were known), going into reserve at Singapore in March 1938. In August 1939, Tenedos, along with sister ships , and , formed a local defence flotilla at Hong Kong. On 24 August 1939 Tenedos and Scout left Hong Kong for Singapore. When the two destroyers arrived at Singapore on 28 August, they were quickly converted to minelayers, which involved removal of one 4 inch gun and the torpedo tubes to accommodate 40 mines. The two destroyers laid a defensive minefield of 544 mines off Singapore between 4 and 8 September 1939, after which Scout was returned to normal destroyer configuration, while Tenedos continued on minelaying duties, with two more minefields being laid off Singapore by October 1939. Two merchant ships, and , were sunk by these minefields in October–November 1939. Tenedos then had her normal destroyer armament refitted. On 23 March 1940, the Royal Navy formed Malaya Force, with the intention of preventing German merchant ships from leaving harbours in the Dutch East Indies. Tenedos, along with was assigned to patrol off Sabang, where five German ships were trapped. The German merchant ships were seized by the Dutch following the German invasion of the Netherlands in May 1940. Tenedos was still based at Singapore on 2 December when the battleship and the battlecruiser arrived. On 5 December, Repulse left Singapore for a visit to Darwin, Australia, with Tenedos and , but they were recalled on 6 December when two large Japanese convoys were spotted by an RAF aircraft. Early on 8 December Japanese bombers attacked Singapore, and later that day, Force Z, comprising Price of Wales and Repulse, escorted by the destroyers , , Vampire and Tenedos set out to attack the Japanese invasion fleets. At about 18:30 hr on 9 December, Tenedos, now short of fuel, was released from Force Z, and set out to return to Singapore, with orders to make radio contact with base at 08:00 the next morning telling Singapore of the planned course of Force Z, while the main fleet maintained radio silence. Force Z made two major course changes after Tenedos left, turning south for Singapore at 20:15 on 9 December and then, at 00:52 on 10 December, heading towards Kuantan on the East coast of Malaya to investigate reports of Japanese landings. The predicted course broadcast by Tenedos therefore did not match Force Z's actual course, preventing any attempts to provide air cover over Force Z. Tenedos was attacked by 9 Mitsubishi G3M bombers searching for Force Z between 09:50 and 10:20 on 10 December but was undamaged. Force Z itself came under heavy Japanese air attack from 11:13, with both Prince of Wales and Repulse sunk by Japanese bombs and torpedoes by 13:20 hr. After the loss of the capital ships Tenedos, along with other British and Allied warships at Singapore, was employed in escorting shipping between Singapore and the Sunda Strait. Tenedos and the Australian cruiser left Singapore, threatened by advancing Japanese forces, for Batavia on 2 February. On 3 February, the two ships rescued survivors from the merchant ship Norah Muller, which had been sunk by Japanese bombers in the Bangka Strait, Tenedos picking up 13 and Hobart 57. In late February 1942, Japanese forces prepared to invade Java. Vice Admiral Conrad Helfrich, commander of Allied naval forces in the Dutch East Indies, ordered Tenedos, together with the cruisers Hobart, and and the destroyer Scout, forming the Allied Western Force, to sail from Batavia towards Bangka Island and Belitung in search of Japanese forces, while most of the rest of the available forces in the region were sent to reinforce Rear Admiral Karel Doorman's squadron. When Doorman's force was defeated at the Battle of the Java Sea on 27 February, the Western Force, including Tenedos, escaped through the Sunda Strait to Ceylon (now Sri Lanka), picking up refugees from Padang on 1 March, and reaching Colombo between 5 and 6 March. In April 1942, the Japanese launched a raid into the Indian Ocean by its fast carrier forces. A RCAF Catalina flying boat spotted the Japanese fleet 350 miles south-east of Ceylon on 4 April and radioed a sighting report before being shot down. Thus warned, all shipping in Colombo and Trincomalee harbours was ordered to leave port and disperse to avoid the impending Japanese attack. Tenedos, however, was under repair in Colombo harbour and unable to leave, and was sunk with the loss of 33 officers and men by Japanese bombers when they attacked on 5 April. The wreck was removed in February 1944 by HM salvage vessel Salviking.http://www.historicalrfa.org/rfa-salviking-ships-details Notes References Bibliography    External links * Naval-History.net - HMS Tenedos Category:S-class destroyers (1917) of the Royal Navy Category:Ships built on the River Tyne Category:1918 ships Category:World War I destroyers of the United Kingdom Category:World War II destroyers of the United Kingdom Category:World War II shipwrecks in the Indian Ocean Category:Destroyers sunk by aircraft Category:Maritime incidents in April 1942 Category:Ships sunk by Japanese aircraft ","title":"HMS Tenedos (H04)"},{"id":"3919379","text":"The Nature's Best DVD is a DVD release of sixty music videos to songs from the three Nature's Best compilation albums.

It lies east of the Rhymney River, and is historically part of Monmouthshire. On 1 April 1938 the Cardiff Extension Act 1937 incorporated it into the county borough of Cardiff, although it remained part of Monmouthshire, and England until the Local Government Act 1972 made Monmouthshire a part of Wales. Description Rumney Library This is a predominantly residential area with a variety of social and private housing. There are many shopping outlets on Newport Road as well as local shops at the top of Rumney Hill and on Wentloog Road, Countisbury Avenue in Llanrumney also. New industrial and business estates have been developed alongside existing ones on Lamby Way providing employment opportunities. Within the older sectors of the Rumney area are places of interest, such as the historic Rumney Pottery which is still in use today and also the remains of the old Rumney Castle which was a major stronghold on the South Wales coast. The remains of the castle were excavated in the late 70s and early 80s. An old quarry which is now being used as a children's park is situated off Ty Mawr Road (Ty Mawr – Welsh language for \\"Big House\\") The Church in Wales parish church of St Augustine, dating from the 12th century, is located on the north side of Church Road. Schools in the area include Eastern High School and St Illtyd's Catholic High School. Transport The area is on Cardiff Bus' 44/45 routes between Cardiff Central bus station and St Mellons and the 49/50 routes to Llanrumney. It is also served by the 30 service to Newport bus station. Governance Rumney is both an electoral ward, and a community of the City of Cardiff. There is no community council for the area. The electoral ward of Rumney lies within the parliamentary constituency of Cardiff South and Penarth.

A commercial treaty is a formal agreement between states for the purpose of establishing mutual rights and regulating conditions of trade. It is a bilateral act whereby definite arrangements are entered into by each contracting party towards the other—not mere concessions. Examples For example, the Methuen Treaty was a commercial treaty between Portugal and England. Another example, between the close of the Napoleonic wars of 1815 and the year 1860, the tariff system of Great Britain was changed from elaborate protection to practically complete free trade. An attempt had indeed been made in 1786 to modify the rigidly protective legislation of the 18th century. In that year Pitt concluded a commercial treaty with France, providing for large reductions of duties in both countries. But the treaty was swept away with the outbreak of the wars with France, and accordingly the old system was still in force in 1815. The first important step, and in some respects the decisive step, towards modifying it was taken in 1824, under the policy of Huskisson. In that year, and again in 1825, great reductions were made in the duties on raw materials, especially on wool, raw silk, flax and iron, while considerable reductions were also made in the duties on manufactured goods. The most sharply contested of the changes was in regard to silks, which had been completely prohibited, and were now admitted at a duty of 30 per cent. A considerable breach was thus made in the protective system; and some further changes in the same direction were made in the next decade, especially under Lord Althorp in 1833. But in the decade from 1830 to 1840 the Corn Laws were the chief subject of contention. The great increase in population since the middle of the 18th century had made England a corn-importing country, especially with the rapid growth of manufactures in the early years of the 19th century. The first systematic Corn Laws imposing duties on grain had been passed in 1773. From 1816 onwards a series of measures were passed, all designed to maintain the high price of grain. The Act of 1816 prohibited the importation of wheat when the price was less than 80 shillings a quarter (=$2.50 a bushel). In 1822 the prohibitive point was lowered to 70 shillings. In 1828 the sliding scale was introduced, under which the duty went up and down as the price of grain went down and up; and it was against this form of the Corn Law that the great agitation led by Cobden and Bright was directed after 1830. For a long time the anti-Corn-Law agitation seemed to have no effect, although conducted with extraordinary skill and enthusiasm. In 1842, however, Sir Robert Peel made the first important concession, by modifying the sliding scale, his opponent, Lord John Russell, having proposed in the previous year a fixed duty of 8 shillings a quarter. In view of the bad harvest of 1845-46, and the famine in Ireland. In 1846, Peel surrendered, and proposed in 1846 the admission of grain with only a fixed duty of one shilling a quarter as a registration fee. This change was carried, but Peel, being able to carry only a fraction of his party with him, was compelled shortly afterwards to resign. The Corn Laws had great political strength, serving as they did the interests of the landowners, whose hold on parliament was still very strong; but the general economic situation in Great Britain, from the rapid growth of the manufacturing population and the imperative need of more food, made the abolition inevitable. After having been maintained till the middle of the century, apparently with irresistible support, they suddenly collapsed under the strain of a season of exceptionally short crops. Both their continued maintenance and their final sudden abolition are in some respects divergent from the general course of British tariff history.

The first eight were originally published in the United Kingdom by Orbit Books between April1999 and May2005. The remaining three titles were self-published by Millar, between March2013 and January2019. The series has been generally positively received, and has produced one World Fantasy Award winner. Overview The stories take place in a mythical, Middle-earth-type World that includes Humans, Orcs, Elves, and a variety of magical creatures. Thraxas, the eponymous protagonist, is a middle-aged private investigator in the city-state of Turai, a kingdom of middling influence and power. In the pre-series timeline he had been a failed sorcery student, an able soldier, and a far-travelled mercenary. He also used to work at the Palace of Turai, but was booted out for his drunken behavior. As the series begins, Thraxas is still an excellent swordsman and competent fighter, and has retained some minor magical ability. Mainly though, he just gambles, drinks a lot of beer, and consumes a lot of food. He is always broke and has to live in the poor, rough part of the city, above the tavern of his old friend Gurd, a barbarian. Thraxas is overweight, somewhat bad-tempered, and a keen gambler at the chariot races. In between his other pursuits, he tries to support himself as a detective-for-hire. Thraxas is usually helped in his cases by his young friend Makri, an escapee from the Orcish gladiator pits, and the best fighter ever seen in Turai. Makri is part Human, part Orc, and part Elf, and she often suffers prejudice from all three races. She works as a waitress at Gurd's tavern, wearing a skimpy chainmail bikini to entice the rough-and-tumble working class customers into leaving better tips. Her exotic good looks and lithe physique have earned her quite a few admirers, but she also has intellectual aspirations, studying at a Turanian College. Later in the series the bulk of the action shifts away from Turai, as the city is conquered by an Orcish army and most characters, including Thraxas and Makri, are forced to flee. Following the fall of Turai, Thraxas tentatively regains part of his previous status when he is given official responsibilities in the effort to retake the city. This development however has little effect on his behavior. The stories narrated in first person by Thraxas happen in real time and are in chronological order. They are also linked by the presence of many of the same characters throughout the series. Typically, Thraxas finds himself entangled in dangerous but realistic situations that involve political intrigue and all kinds of conspiracies. Through luck and pluck, as well as a well-honed sense of humor, he somehow manages to pull through against heavy odds.

English-language e-book editions were released by Orbit Books-affiliated publisher Hachette Digital in September2008. Series books have also been published in several other countries and languages. After the eighth novel, Orbit did not want to publish additional installments. In addition, Millar's agent could not come to an agreement regarding rights of future Thraxas titles with Baen Books. Baen was also republishing the series in omnibus form, two titles at a time ; it stopped publication after the second omnibus volume. Despite the difficulties with publishers, Millar stated that he planned to continue with the series. In September2012 he blogged that he had nearly finished a 9thbook, Thraxas and the Ice Dragon. It was eventually released in March2013 almost eight years after the previous volume as an e-book through BookBaby, a self-publishing company. Millar released the tenth book, Thraxas and the Oracle, via the same channel and format in February2015; at that time all titles were available in e-book format only. The series was eventually reprinted between February and October2017, in single-title or two-title editions . They were released through CreateSpace, a print on demand self-publishing subsidiary of Amazon. all republished titles were listed in Amazon websites as part of The Collected Thraxas edition. In January2019, four years after the release of the tenth book the eleventh installment, Thraxas of Turai, was simultaneously self- published in and e-book editions. =Select editions= {class=\\"wikitable floatleft\\" style=\\"width:auto; margin:auto;\\" +Baen Omnibus Edition (US discontinued) !!!Title!!Date!!Length!!Media!!Notes!!ISBN } {class=\\"wikitable floatleft\\" style=\\"width:auto; margin:auto;\\" +The Collected Thraxas (selections) !!!Title!!Date!!Length!!Media!!Notes!!ISBN -class=\\"sortbottom\\" colspan=\\"7\\" style=\\"background:#F2F2F2;\\"Print-on-demand edition, self- published via CreateSpace. } Reception Locus reviewer Jonathan Strahan praised the first novel in the series as \\"an entertaining addition to the fantasy PI bookshelf,\\" further stating, \\"Scott is careful to balance the various requirements of humorous fantasy and PI crime fiction.\\" A favorable review of the second omnibus Death and Thraxas maintained, \\"he strength of novels lies in their humor and quirky characters.\\" In an also-favorable2005 review of Thraxas and the Sorcerers in the science fiction magazine Chronicle, frequent series reviewer Don D'Ammassa stated, \\"he first few volumes in the series were pretty frothy, but I've actually become more fond of the character with the recent A mini-review by Jon Courtenay Grimwood of Thraxas at War appeared in The Guardian (London) in July2003.

They are also employed in Paris as street messengers, light porters, etc. In Commonwealth countries, a commissionaire may refer to an employee of a Corps of Commissionaires who carries out security or reception duties. Law and taxation In European civil law jurisdictions (e.g., France, Germany), a commissionaire is a person who acts in his or her own name for the account of a principal. The principal is contractually bound to deliver (through the commissionaire) the goods sold to the customer; the commissionaire is contractually bound to the principal to remit the price received to the principal. In addition, the commissionaire is contractually bound to the customer to deliver the goods sold on the terms agreed. No relationship is created between the customer and the principal. The commissionaire is remunerated by commission, and paid by the principal. The commissionaire does not take title to the goods. A civil law commissionaire arrangement creates agency in common law countries, such as Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. For tax purposes in civil law jurisdictions, a commissionaire is not generally viewed as a dependent agent by virtue of the commissionaire status. Thus, the activities and place of business of a commissionaire are not attributed to the principal. Use of a commissionaire arrangement has historically been considered to prevent a seller of goods (the principal) from having a permanent establishment in the commissionaire's country if the principal has no other presence in that country. However, this view was unsuccessfully challenged by tax authorities in France, Norway and Italy.Though the French Administrative Court of Appeal in Paris held in Zimmer Ltd on 2 February 2007 that the French commissionaire of the UK principal constituted a French permanent establishment of that company, on 31 March 2010, the Conseil d'Etat, held in cases no. 304715 and 308525 that Zimmer SAS did not create a permanent establishment for Zimmer Ltd. under the commissionaire agreement. The Oslo, Norway administrative court (a first level court) found similarly on 16 December 2009, but the decision was overturned by the Supreme Court of Norway (Dell Products vs. Staten v/Skatt øst, Norges Høyesterett, HR-2011-2245-A (sak nr. 2011/755), 2 December 2011). In March 2012 the Italian Supreme court also found that a commissionaire under civil Law does not constitute a Permanent Establishment for tax purposes (Boston Scientific, Corte di Cassazione, Mar. 9, 2012 (hearing of Feb. 29, 2012), Tax Chamber, Section V, Case No. 3769).

Created as a daughter-house of Newminster Abbey, it existed from 1149 until its dissolution in 1536, during the reign of King Henry VIII. A monk here, William de Remmyngton went on to become Chancellor of the University of Oxford in 1372–3. The last two abbots of Sawley were both put to death. Thomas Bolton was executed as a consequence of his resistance to the dissolution and William Trafford, the last Abbot, was executed in Lancaster on 10 March 1537 alongside John Paslew, the last Abbot of Whalley Abbey, for alleged involvement in the Pilgrimage of Grace. The ruins of Sawley Abbey, which are now controlled by English Heritage, are open to the public. Although not an extensive ruin, there are boards on the site that give information regarding the history of the abbey and its former inhabitants.

The slang term flophouse is roughly the equivalent of common lodging-houses. The nearest modern equivalent is a hostel. There was no statutory definition of the class of houses in England intended to be included in the expression common lodging-house, but the definition used above was adopted to include those houses which, under the Public Health Act 1875 and other legislation, must be registered and inspected. The provisions of the Public Health Act were that every urban and rural district council must keep registers showing the names and residences of the keepers of all common lodging-houses in their districts, the location of every such house, and the number of lodgers authorized by them. The scandalous condition of the common lodging houses in London, which were frequently the resort of criminals and prostitutes, prompted the Common Lodging Houses Acts 1851 and 1853. These regulations, however proved ineffectual and the requirement that residents vacate the premises between 10 a.m. and late afternoon hit poor and sick residents hard, as they were obliged to walk the streets in the intervening period in all weathers.Fiona Rule (2008) The Worst Street in London: 51, 56, 70-75\\\\. Hersham, Ian Allan Even tighter control was imposed when regulation of common lodging houses was transferred from the police to the London County Council in 1894, resulting in the imposition of higher standards and regular inspection of the premises by council officials. The new regulations required the landlords to limewash the walls and ceilings twice a year and the mixed sex accommodation, which was frequently a cover for a brothel, was abolished. Proper beds and bedding had also to be provided instead of mattresses on the floor and worse.Fiona Rule (2008) The Worst Street in London: 161-62\\\\. Hersham, Ian Allan United States New York, circa 1910 Children within a Common lodging-house, Christmas 1910 Urban reformer Jacob Riis was not only an advocate for improving the condition of people living in cheap lodging houses; he had lived in them as a young man, an experience he described in his slum memoir, How the Other Half Lives (1890). Riis states that most lodging house residents were unskilled day laborers whose low wages meant they could not afford other housing. Lodging house residents worked at \\"menial tasks involved with building industrial plants and street railroads, paving streets, laying pipe and wire for gas and electric systems, and erecting new buildings\\" and working at \\"docks, warehouses, and factories\\".

Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994. http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft6j49p0wf/ The demand for casual workers fluctuated a great deal from the 1890s to the 1930s; as such, lodging houses provided an inexpensive place for these mobile workers to live. The peak demand for city lodging houses was in the winter, when there was little rural work. To cope with this surge in demand, lodging \\"house keepers doubled up people in rooms and set more cots out into the hallways.\\" Black workers had difficulties getting housing due to the \\"color line\\" restrictions of racial segregation. While most of the lodging house residents were men, some women lived there, often in a separate room. Groth, Paul. Living Downtown: The History of Residential Hotels in the United States. Chapter Five – Outsiders and Cheap Lodging Houses. Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994. http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft6j49p0wf/ A wide range of lodging house prices were available, depending on how much privacy and common areas they offered, ranging from private rooms, semi-private cubicles (nicknamed \\"cribs\\" or \\"cages\\"- a reference to the chicken wire that topped the cubicles- they had seven foot walls around a 5 foot by 7 foot space), and the cheapest \\"flophouse\\" style lodgings.

Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994. http://ark.cdlib.org/ark:/13030/ft6j49p0wf/ Most lodging houses had no dining area or restaurant facilities, unless it was in an old hotel. A difference between rooming houses and cheap lodging houses is that rooming houses charged by the week, whereas lodging houses charged for each day, only rarely making weekly tenure available. In major cities, five story or higher rooming houses were common; in smaller cities, three or four stories was the norm. The fairly expensive, 40 cents-per-night lodging house usually had a mattress, chair and clothes hook. The most expensive lodging houses had a little dresser and a basin for water with taps.

Not all lodging houses were heated, but if heat was available, it would be from hot stoves placed in the hallways. The residents faced \\"vermin, general filth, and horrific smells\\", along with \\"[l]ice, other bedbugs, and mice\\". The lowest form of lodging house was the flophouse, which typically did not offer beds, providing instead \\"mattresses or piles of rags with a blanket\\", hammocks, or simply floor space (with the expectation that renters had their own bedroll).Groth, Paul.

Another effort was municipal lodging houses, such as the building opened in New York City in 1896. Groth, Paul. Living Downtown: The History of Residential Hotels in the United States.

The Salvation Army opened its first mission in 1890s, soon rising to 44 locations across the US where low cost beds and food were available.

It became an autonomous school in 1994 and was one of the pioneer autonomous schools in Singapore. History The school was founded in 1960 as a girls' primary school. In 1964, it became a girls' secondary school, and began admitting boys in 1965. The school has occupied several sites. Formally situated at Stevens Road and Anderson Road, Anderson Secondary School moved to Ang Mo Kio Street 44 in 1984. In December 1993, it moved to its current location, Ang Mo Kio Street 53. Anderson Secondary School have been used from time to time for educational experiments. In 1994 it was declared an autonomous school for consistent academic performance, and in 1996 it was one of the first schools to use the Students-and-Teachers Workbench project. In 1997 it was chosen as an IT demo school. The school received the School Distinction Award by the Ministry of Education in 2004. = Programme for Rebuilding and Improving Existing Schools = From 2003 to 2006 the school underwent a Programme for Rebuilding and IMproving Existing school upgrading project. The school raised funds for a student activity hub, a heritage centre and a multi-purpose studio, upgraded the lecture theatre and classrooms and added a five-storey building. The final stage of the upgrading process took place in 2005. Some facilities, such as the school hall, cookery rooms and the football field, were ready in July 2006. A facility called the \\"Inspire Town\\" was opened in 2005. This is a room where innovation and creativity is encouraged amongst pupils. Two classrooms were converted into a black box theater for use by drama students. In 2008, an indoor sports hall was opened. = Uniform and Attire = Girls wear a white blouse and a kelly blue tunic knee-length pinafore. Lower secondary boys wear a pair of short trousers while upper secondary boys wear a pair of white long trousers. Students wear the school badge, with their name tag directly below it.

Early history In the early centuries of the history of the Christian Church the election or appointment of a suffragan bishop was confirmed and approved by the metropolitan and his suffragans assembled in synod. By the 4th Canon of the First Council of Nicaea (325 AD), however, it was decreed that the right of confirmation should belong to the metropolitan bishop of each province, a rule confirmed by the 12th Canon of the Council of Laodicaea. For the appointment of a metropolitan no papal confirmation was required either in the West or East; but the practice which grew up, from the 6th century onwards, of the popes presenting the pallium, at first honoris causa, to newly appointed metropolitans gradually came to symbolize the licence to exercise metropolitan jurisdiction. By the 8th and 9th centuries, the papal right of confirmation by this means was strenuously asserted; yet as late as the 13th century, there were instances of metropolitans exercising their functions without receiving the pallium, and it was not until after this date that the present rule and practice of the Roman Catholic Church was definitively established.Hinschius, Paul. System des katholischen Kirchenrechts. 6 vol. The canonical right of the metropolitan to confirm the election of his suffragans was still affirmed by Gratian; but from the time of Pope Alexander III (1159–1181) the canon lawyers, under the influence of the False Decretals, began to claim this right for the pope.Febronius (Johann Nikolaus von Hontheim). De statu ecclesiae. 2nd ed, 1765. Confirmation and the papacy From the 13th century onwards, it was effectively exercised, though the all but universal practice of the popes of reserving and providing to vacant bishoprics, initiated by Pope Clement V, obscured the issue, since in the case of papal nominations no confirmation was required. The question, however, was raised, in connection with that of the papal reservations and provisions, at the councils of Constance and Basel. The former shelved it in the interests of peace; but the latter once more formulated the principle that elections in the churches were to be free and their result confirmed according to the provisions of the common law (juxta juris communis dispositionem), i.e. by the immediate superior to whom the right of confirmation belonged. In Roman Catholic countries the complete control of the papacy over the election and appointment of bishops has since the Protestant Reformation become firmly established, in spite of the efforts of Gallicans and Febronians to reassert what they held to be the more Catholic usage. Confirmation in Anglican churches In England, where the abuse of provisors had been most acutely felt, the matter was dealt with during the vacancy of the Holy See between the deposition of Antipope John XXIII at Constance (May 1415) and the election of Pope Martin V (November 1417). During the interval the only possible way of appointing a bishop was by the ancient method of canonical election and confirmation. Shortly after the deposition of John XXIII, Henry V of England assented to an ordinance that during the voidance of the Holy See bishops elect should be confirmed by their metropolitans;Rotuli Parliamentorum, iv. p. 71 but the ordinance was not recorded on the Statute Roll. Three bishops only, namely: John Chandler (or Cjaaundeler), Bishop of Salisbury; Edmund Lacey, Bishop of Hereford; and John Wakering, Bishop of Norwich, were confirmed by Henry Chichele, Archbishop of Canterbury during the papal vacancy. When Martin V was elected pope in 1417 he resumed the practice of providing bishops, and from this time until the English Reformation the canonical election and confirmation of a bishop in England was a rare exception. With the independence of the Church of England the role of the papacy in appointing bishops was abolished, but the confirmation became almost formal in character. By 25 Hen. VIII. c. 20, 5. 4 it is provided that after an episcopal election a royal mandate shall issue to the archbishop of the province requiring him to confirm the said election or, in case of an archbishop-elect, to one archbishop and two bishops, or to four bishops, requiring and commanding them with all speed and celerity to confirm it. This practice still prevails in the case of dioceses which have chapters to elect. The confirmation has usually been performed by the archbishop's vicar-general and, in the southern province, at the church of St Mary-le-Bow, London (as the permanent home of the Arches Court); but since 1901 it has also been performed variously at: Church House, Westminster; at Lambeth Palace; at the Archbishop's Faculty Office (1 The Sanctuary, Westminster); and at St Paul's — in consequence of the disorder in the proceedings at St Mary-le-Bow on the confirmation there of Arthur Winnington-Ingram as Bishop of London. All objectors are cited to appear on pain of contumacy after the old form; but although the knowledge that opposition might be offered has been a safeguard against improper nominations, e.g. in the case of Samuel Clarke the Arian, confirmation has never been refused since the Reformation. In 1628, Dr. Rives, acting for the vicar-general, declined to receive objections made to Richard Montagu's election to the See of Chichester on the ground that they were not made in legal form. An informal protest against the confirmation of James Prince Lee as Bishop of Manchester in 1848 was almost immediately followed by another in due form against that of Renn Hampden, Bishop-elect of Hereford. The vicar- general refused to receive the objections and an application to the Queen's bench for a mandamus was unsuccessful, the judges being divided two against two.

Company history  MOMO was founded by gentleman racer Gianpiero Moretti in 1964. MOMO are the initials for Moretti-Monza. Monza is a town in the Province of Milan. That year, Moretti produced a racing steering wheel for his own race car. This was the first steering wheel produced by the brand. Compared to the other racing steering wheels available on the market at that time, Momo featured thicker grip, the other racers noticed the convenience of that steering wheel and wanted to obtain the same for their vehicles. So, steering wheels by this brand gained fame throughout the racing community and among the Formula One drivers. So, John Surtees, one of Formula One’s drivers, requested the same steering wheel for his single- seater Ferrari. That same year, he won a Formula One race - the first significant victory of the Momo brand. In 1969 MOMO opened production plant in Tregnago, Province of Verona. Due to increasing United States federal government safety regulations and the wide adoption of airbags in passenger vehicles internationally, MOMO was sold in 1996 to Breed Technologies, a steering wheel airbag manufacturer. Breed Technologies was acquired by private equity firm Carlyle Group and merged with other OEM automotive businesses they owned to form Key Safety Systems in 2003. Key Safety Systems sold the MOMO brand name to an Italian private equity group in 2006, but most of the manufacturing plants and technologies previously owned by MOMO were retained by Key Safety Systems.

More than twenty minutes long, it may also be considered a \\"tone poem\\". The work is dedicated \\"To my friend Leo F. Schuster\\".  History  The subtitle \\"Alassio\\" refers to the town on the Italian Riviera where Elgar and his family stayed. He strolled around during the visit, and his general location within the Province of Savona came to provide him with sources of inspiration. He later recalled: :Then in a flash, it all came to me – the conflict of the armies on that very spot long ago, where I now stood – the contrast of the ruin and the shepherd – and then, all of a sudden, I came back to reality. In that time I had composed the overture – the rest was merely writing it down. The première of the work was given by the Hallé Orchestra on 16 March 1904, the third day of an \\"Elgar Festival\\" at the Royal Opera House in Covent Garden. It was to have been conducted by Hans Richter, but as Elgar did not have the score ready in time for Richter to study it before the performance, Elgar conducted the orchestra himself. Frank Schuster was with the Elgars at the première. Theodore Thomas led the U.S. premiere with the Chicago Symphony Orchestra on November 4, 1904.Elgar’s In the South (Alassio). Chicago Symphony Orchestra's Rosenthal Archives. Retrieved 2018-08-08.  Description  In the piece, the central serenade is played by a solo viola (Excerpt). However, in July of the same year, Elgar took this section from the piece and fitted it to a poem by Shelley as a song under the title In Moonlight. Later he made several instrumental versions titled \\"Canto Popolare\\", including an arrangement for violin and piano made in collaboration with violinist Isabella Jaeger, wife of Elgar's friend August Jaeger.

The main descending theme is echoed throughout the sections of the orchestra all through the piece. The viola solo is of particular note due partly to its length, being on such an underused instrument, but also because of the contrast it creates with the rest of the piece which is very bold. There are large legato passages between the strings and horns, and the rest of the brass add tremendous excitement in the middle of the piece with loud chords separated by large intervals.  Instrumentation  The work is written for a full symphony orchestra consisting of 3 flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, cor anglais, 2 clarinets, bass clarinet, 2 bassoons, contrabassoon, 4 horns, 3 trumpets, 3 trombones, tuba, 3 timpani, percussion (bass drum, cymbals, side drum, triangle and glockenspiel), harp and the string section.

It lies approximately 8 km north of the city centre and to the east of its nearest neighbour Johnsonville. It has a long history of early settlement and originally was farmed including being the early source of Wellington's milk. Newlands is located in a valley and covers two ridgelines, the side of one of which overlooks Wellington Harbour and up to the Hutt Valley. History The area that modern Newlands occupies was originally known as Papararangi which is Te Reo Māori for \\"cluster of hills\\". A 40 ha area was sold during the 1840-41 land ballots run by the New Zealand Company. There are two theories to the suburb's name. The first is that it was named after Thomas Newland who arrived in New Zealand from London in 1875 aboard the ship “Avalanche” and ran a business making glue and oil in neighboring Johnsonville before becoming Manager of the Manure Department of the Wellington Meat Export Company's Works in 1892. Thomas Newland was close friends of Walter Futter who owned land in Newlands. The second theory is that it was simply the \\"New Land\\" near Johnsonville. The area was mostly used as a pig and dairy farm, providing Wellington most of their town milk supply from the 1920s to the 1950s. Dairy farms were run by Bill Miles of Newlands Dairy Limited who purchased James Purchase’s farm in Glanmire Rd and ran 100 cows, also Pearce and Tristram. After the Second World War Miles subdivided for housing; initially in Wakely Road, then in Miles Crescent, Lyndfield Lane, Black Rock Road and Glanmire Road. Ernest Hoskings grazed his dairy herd in Johnsonville, Newlands and Horokiwi. Newlands was the location of the 1923 \\"Newlands Baby Farmers\\", where Daniel Cooper was found guilty and executed for murder, performing illegal abortions and baby farming. A war memorial was erected after World War I; the original memorial was replaced after World War II because of road widening. Facilities Newlands has recently (2013) had a revamped shopping centre with a new supermarket, and a new community centre. It is close to services and a mall located in its near neighbour Johnsonville. =Community Centre= The Newlands Community Centre was opened in 2009 and is home to a drop in centre, Newlands Toy Library and many community groups. =Volunteer Fire Brigade= Newlands Volunteer Fire Brigade was established in 1965 on Newlands Road and has 22 members and one appliance; a 2010 Iveco Eurocargo 6/1 light pumping appliance. =Parks and reserves= Newlands has a number of parks and reserves, including: *Newlands Park *Pinkerton Park *Seton Nossiter Park *Waihinahina park *Gilberd Bush Reserve *Edgecombe Street play area *Kenmore Street Play Area *Lyndfield Lane play area *Cheyne Walk play area *Salford Street Play Area Transport Newlands has good access to Wellington's CBD and to Lower Hutt by a road connection to Ngauranga Gorge; and to Johnsonville and the main motorway to Kapiti and north via Stewart Drive, constructed in the 1960s.

English election law  Corrupt practices were created in United Kingdom common law through the Corrupt Practices Prevention Act 1854, although statutes for the prevention of specific offences had been passed in 1416, 1695,See Corrupt Practices Act 1695 1809, 1827, 1829, and 1842. The Act was modified, amended or extended by later legislation, for example the Corrupt and Illegal Practices Prevention Act 1883. = Offences = Corrupt practices are now defined by the Representation of the People Act 1983 and include: * personation, defined as pretending to be another person (whether living, dead or fictitious) in order to vote in their nameSection 60 * applying for a postal vote in the name of another person, or diverting the delivery of a postal vote formSection 62A * giving false information in the papers nominating a candidateSection 65A * incurring unlawful expenses in connection with an election campaign,Section 75 or making a false declaration regarding election expensesSection 82 * bribing voters to vote or not to vote (with money, or other valuable items)Section 113 * treating, defined as giving or offering food, drink or entertainment to a voter in order to influence their voteSection 114 * exerting undue influence on a voter through threats (including threats of \\"spiritual injury\\" as well as physical injury, damage or harm), whether to influence their vote or as a result of their votingSection 115 The result of an election can be challenged on the grounds that corrupt practices have taken place by the presentation of an election petition to the courts within the period of 21 days after the date of the election.Sections 120 to 135A If the election court which hears the petition determines that a corrupt practice has taken place, it issues a report finding the relevant individuals guilty.Sections 139 to 145 A candidate may be reported as personally guilty if they were directly involved with the corrupt practice, or if it was committed with their knowledge or consent. A candidate may also be reported as \\"guilty by his agents\\" where his election agent or those working on his campaign commit corrupt practices.Section 158 = Punishment = The punishments for corrupt practices fall into two broad categories: non-criminal sanctions, and criminal punishments. The reporting, by an election court, of a person as guilty of a corrupt practice renders them immediately liable to the non-criminal sanctions, and they may additionally be prosecuted and subjected to the criminal punishments (but if they are prosecuted and acquitted, then the non-criminal sanctions are revokedSection 174(1))). Where the election was not challenged by a petition at the time, but suspected corrupt practices are subsequently identified, a criminal prosecution can be instigated (but only within one year of the election concernedSection 176), and anyone found guilty is subject to both criminal punishment and the non-criminal sanctions.  Non-criminal sanctions  The successful election of a candidate found guilty (whether personally or by his agents) of a corrupt practice is void,Section 159 and anyone found personally guilty of a corrupt practice is prohibited from holding any elected office (and for some offences, also from voting in any election) for a period of five years.Section 160 In addition, if the offender is a solicitor, barrister, advocate or member of another regulated profession (such as a medical doctor) then the offence is also reported to the appropriate regulatory body which is empowered to deal with it as if it were professional misconduct, and thus could result in suspension or being struck off their professional register.Section 162 If an election court finds that someone with a licence for the sale of alcohol allows bribery or treating to take place on his premises, they can also report the matter to the licensing authority which may consider it grounds to refuse to renew the licence.Section 163  Criminal punishment  Conviction of a corrupt practice in the criminal courts can result in imprisonment for up to two years (depending on the offence) or an unlimited fine.Section 168 = Recent cases = One of the most high-profile cases of corrupt practices in recent years was that of the local government elections in the Bordesley Green and Aston wards of Birmingham in June 2004. The election court, presided over by Richard Mawrey QC, found that there had been extensive abuse of the postal vote system, resulting in the outcome of the election being changed. He accordingly reported that extensive corrupt practices had been committed, found six individuals personally guilty (although one was subsequently cleared by the Court of Appeal), and voided the elections. Following the 1997 General Election, Fiona Jones, who had been elected as Member of Parliament for Newark, and her election agent were initially tried and convicted of making false declaration regarding election expenses. However, the conviction was overturned on appeal.

The term was made up by Fred Lakin, after Deutsch made the following comment at a talk on visual programming by Scott Kim and Warren Robinett: \\"Well, this is all fine and well, but the problem with visual programming languages is that you can’t have more than 50 visual primitives on the screen at the same time.

However, criticisms of the limit include that it is not clear whether a similar limit also exists in textual programming languages; and that the limit could be overcome by applying modularity to visual programming as is commonly done in textual programming.

Common methods include hot water extraction, dry-cleaning, and vacuuming. Ohio Suction Carpet Cleaner cart and crew, Toledo, Ohio  Hot water extraction  Although there is an actual steam cleaning industrial process, in the context of carpet cleaning, \\"steam cleaning\\" is often mistaken for hot water soil extraction cleaning, which is professionally known as HWE. The hot water soil extraction cleaning method uses equipment that sprays heated water and detergent on the carpet and simultaneously, the water and detergent is extracted, along with any dislodged and dissolved dirt. Many experts recommend hot water extraction as the most effective carpet cleaning method. Actual steam could damage man-made carpet fibers and change the characteristics as they are usually set using heat. Woven carpets can shrink but most carpets are not woven and are in fact tuffed on a laminate backing, velvet-piled carpets and Berber carpets may become fuzzy which is known as pile burst. Most problems can be avoided by professional experienced cleaners. Hot water extraction equipment may be a portable unit that plugs into an electrical outlet, or a truck mount carpet cleaner requiring long hoses from the truck or trailer. Truck-mounted equipment may be used where electricity is unavailable, but may be unsuited to premises distant from a driveway or road, and require hoses to pass through windows to reach the upper floors of a building. The hoses needed for truck-mount and professional portable carpet cleaning may present a trip hazard, and allow pets or children to escape through doors left ajar. Heated or air conditioned air can also be wasted when doors are left open for hoses. Truck-mounted carpet cleaning equipment minimizes the noise in the room being cleaned, but may cause noise and air pollution offensive to neighbors, and could violate anti-idling bylaws in some jurisdictions. However, truck-mounted cleaning is much faster than portable equipment, and the extra heat will dissolve more spots and stains, and more vacuum suction power will reduce drying times. A Rug Doctor rental carpet cleaning machine A common process of hot water extraction begins with preconditioning. Alkaline agents such as ammonia solution for synthetic carpets, or acidic solution (such as vinegar solution) for woollen carpets, are sprayed into the carpet, then agitated with a grooming brush or an automatic scrubbing machine. Next, a pressurized manual or automatic cleaning tool (known as a wand) passes over the surface to rinse out all pre- conditioner, residue, and particulates. If an alkaline detergent is used on a woollen carpet, use of a mild acetic acid solution will restore neutral fiber pH. The acidic rinse thus neutralizes the alkaline residues, and can contribute to softening cleaned fabrics. Extraction is, by far, the most important step in the hot water extraction process. Since the hot-water extraction method uses much more water than other methods like bonnet or shampoo cleaning, proper extraction and air flow are critical to avoid drying issues such as mold growth & browning of wool fibres. Drying time may also be decreased by extra use of fans, de-humidifiers, and/or outdoor ventilation. Older surfaces, such as double jute-backed carpets and loose rugs with natural foundation yarns, could shrink after a wet treatment, leading to suppositions that wet-cleaning could also remove wrinkles. However, this notion is antiquated and this method could also occasionally tear seams or uproot strips. Newer carpets, such as with synthetic backing and foundation yarns, do not shrink, and they smooth easily; in such carpets, wrinkles indicate an underlying problem, such as delamination where the secondary backing becomes unstuck from the primary backing, that may need a certified carpet inspector to determine. Wet-cleaning systems naturally require drying time, which may lead to concerns about very slow drying, the risk of soiling returning during drying as the moisture evaporates bringing the soils from deeper within the pile to the surface, as well as odors, bacteria, fungi, molds, and mildews. Carpet cleaning specialists try to find a balance between rapid drying (attributable to lower flow rate through the cleaning jets of a spray system) and the need to remove the most soil (attributable to higher flow rate). Pretreatments similar to those in dry-cleaning and \\"very low moisture\\" systems are employed, but require a longer dwell time of 15 to 20 minutes, because of lower amounts of carpet agitation. Ideal pretreatments should rinse easily and leave dry, powdery, or crystalline residue that can be flushed without contributing to re-soiling.  Dry-cleaning  Many dry carpet-cleaning systems rely on specialized machines. These systems are mostly \\"very low moisture\\" (VLM) systems, relying on dry compounds complemented by application cleaning solutions, and are growing significantly in market share due in part to their very rapid drying time, a significant factor for 24-hour commercial installations. Dry-cleaning and \\"very low moisture\\" systems are also often faster and less labor-intensive than wet-extraction systems. Heavily soiled areas require the application of manual spotting, pretreatments, preconditioners, and/or \\"traffic-lane cleaners\\", (commonly sprayed onto carpet prior to the primary use of the dry-cleaning system) which are detergents or emulsifiers which break the binding of different soils to carpet fibers over a short period of time. For example, one chemical may dissolve the greasy films that bind soils to the carpet, and thus prevent effective soil removal through vacuuming. The solution may add a solvent like d-limonene, petroleum byproducts, glycol ethers, or butyl agents. The amount of time the pretreatment dwells in the carpet should be less than 15 minutes, due to the thorough carpet brushing common to these \\"very low moisture\\" systems, which provides added agitation to ensure the pretreatment works fully through the carpet. The benefit of dry carpet cleaning, over wet solutions, is that dry chemical compounds don't attract dirt, like dried shampoo. While dry carpet cleaning is more expensive and more time consuming to clean than bonnet or extraction, dry cleaning formulas put less stress on the carpets themselves. = Dry compound = A 98% biodegradable or others,Heinrich Waldhoff, Rudiger Spilker, Handbook Of Detergents, Part C: P. 26, CRC Press, 30 November 2004 slightly moist absorbent cleaning compound may be spread evenly over carpet and brushed or scrubbed in. For small areas, a household hand brush can work such a compound into carpet pile; working like \\"tiny sponges\\", the attracted cleaning solution dissolve dirt, dirt and grime is attracted/absorbed to the compound, after a short drying time (the cleaning solution which is attracted to the compound must evaporate), it will be removed with a vacuum cleaner, the drier the better, leaving carpet immediately clean and dry. But it's very difficult to remove all residues, the residues can cause allergies and biological compounds may cause discolourations on carpets. For commercial applications, a specially designed cylindrical counter-rotating brushing system is used, without a vacuum cleaner. Machine scrubbing is more typical, in that hand scrubbing generally cleans only the top third of carpet. = Encapsulation = In the 1990s, new polymers began literally encapsulating (crystallizing) soil particles into dry residues on contact. In the conventional cleaning process surfactant molecules attach themselves to oily soil particles, suspending them (emulsification) so that they can be easily rinsed away. Surfactant (detergent) molecules and emulsified soils which escape being rinsed away, remain in the fibre and continue to attract soiling. Encapsulators are specialty detergent polymers which become part of the detergent system. As drying occurs (20-30 min. drytime), after cleaning, these encapsulators bind the detergent molecules and residual soils in a brittle, crystalline structure. Detergent and soil particles can no longer attract other soils and are easily removed by dry vacuuming. In addition to binding the detergent and soil residues the encapsulation chemistry coats the clean fibre with the same brittle film. This reduces the fibre’s affinity for oily and particulate soils. As this brittle film \\"breaks away\\" and more soil is removed, the appearance of the fibre improves as opposed to soiling more rapidly. Products which also employ fluorochemical technology, display dramatically extended anti re-soiling time periods. Cleaning solution is applied by rotary machine, brush applicator, or compression sprayer. Dry residue is vacuumable immediately (20-30 min. drytime), either separately or from a built-in unit of the cleaning-system machine. = Bonnet = After a cleaning product is deposited onto the surface as mist, a round buffer or \\"bonnet\\" scrubs the mixture with a rotating motion. This industry machine resembles a floor buffer, with an absorbent spin or oscillating pad that attracts soil and is rinsed or replaced repeatedly. The bonnet method is not strictly dry-cleaning. To reduce pile distortion, the absorbent bonnet should be kept well-lubricated with cleaning solution. It is not recommended to dunk the bonnet in a bucket of cleaning solution and then wring it out with a mop- bucket wringer, as this will make the bonnet too wet. It is important to change or turn the bonnet early, as bonnets can become filled with soil in just a few hundred square feet. Once loaded with soil, the bonnet will not hold any more; instead, it simply moves the soil from one area to another. An overly wet bonnet also deposits residues that attract soils when they are dry, creating the need to clean more often. It is recommended for robust and not for high floor carpet, it swirls the floor. It distorts pile and grinds dirt deeper in carpet fiber, and also has an abrasive effect.servicesmag.org An Effective Alternative to Bonnet Cleaning When there is a large amount of foreign material in the carpet, extraction with a wet process may be needed. Normally, the spin-bonnet method may not be as capable of sanitizing carpet fibers due to the lack of hot water, for this a special thermo machine is needed, here the buffing machine is equipped with a heating, to heat up the bonnet, but a post-cleaning application of an antimicrobial agent is used to make up for this. A small amount of water is required with spin-bonnet carpet cleaning. It only cleans the top of the carpet 1/8 inch but it is very fast for wide areas. However, bonnet cleaning is not the best mechanism for completely removing the chemical that is pre-sprayed onto a carpet. It is recommended that only surfactant free or encapsulating products are used. = Shampoo = Wet shampoo cleaning with rotary machines, followed by thorough wet vacuuming, was widespread until about the 1970s, but industry perception of shampoo cleaning changed with the advent of encapsulation. Hot-water extraction, also regarded as preferable by all manufacturers, had not been introduced either. Wet shampoos were once formulated from coconut oil soaps; wet shampoo residues can be foamy or sticky, and steam cleaning often reveals dirt unextracted by shampoos. Since no rinse is performed, the powerful residue can continue to collect dirt after cleaning, leading to the misconception that carpet cleaning can lead to the carpet getting \\"dirtier faster\\" after the cleaning. The best method is truckmounted hot water extraction. When wet-shampoo chemistry standards converted from coconut oil soaps to synthetic detergents as a base, the shampoos dried to a powder, and loosened dirt would attach to the powder components, requiring vacuuming by the consumer the day after cleaning. = Dry foam carpet cleaning = Dry foam cleaningUri Zoller, Handbook of Detergents, Part E: P. 241, CRC Press, 29 October 2008 involves applying a cleaning foam blanket to the surface area of a carpet immediately after a dry clean. The foam is left to stand for 10 minutes to allow chemical agents to affect the carpet. This method is typically used to remove grease from the surface; some foams have color brighteners, protectants and anti-soiling agents. It is not a completely dry method since the foam is 90% air and 10% liquid. A dry foam machine consists of a pressure tank in which a solution of water and shampoo is added. This method is used for water-sensitive carpets, needle felt, and other carpet types whose construction inhibits sufficient water extraction. = Vacuum wash = Vacuum washingClean Middleeast Issue # 6, Vol: 2 2014 employs a washhead that sprays water without detergent and immediately removes it by suction, creating a swirl of water. This ensures high cleaning performance, extracting the dirt from the carpet to a depth of half an inch. By immediately reabsorbing the wash water, the drying time is greatly shortened. This method is suitable for intermediate and basic cleaning. Because it does not require cleaning products, it leaves no detergent residue. Vacuum washing has long been in use in Europe, mostly in larger train and bus companies, schools, and historic preservation. The system works on all surfaces which are water resistant (carpet, upholstered furniture, wooden floors, stone, plastics). A great advantage is that this system works without brushes or pads so there is no abrasion on the pile.  Household processes  Other household carpet- cleaning processes are much older than industry standardization, and have varying degrees of effectiveness as supplements to the more thorough cleaning methods accepted in the industry. = Vacuum = Vacuum cleaners use air pumps to create partial vacuums to suck up dust and dirt, usually from floors and carpets. Filtering systems or cyclones collect dirt for later disposal but don't necessarily improve the machines ability to remove dirt from the surface being cleaned. Modern carpet cleaning equipment use rotary vacuum heads and spray jets to deep clean the carpet through hundreds of multi-directional cleaning passes. Some add steam and agitation. Models include upright (dirty- air and clean-air), canister and backpack, wet-dry and pneumatic, and other varieties. Robotic vacuum cleaners have recently become available. = Stain removal = Tea leaves and cut grass were formerly common for floor cleaning, to collect dust from carpets, albeit with risks of stains. Ink was removed with lemon or with oxalic acid and hartshorn; oil with white bread or with pipe clay; grease fats with turpentine; ox gall and naphtha were also general cleaners. Ammonia and chloroform were recommended for acid discoloration. Benzine and alum were suggested for removing insects; diatomaceous earth and material similar to cat litter are still common for removing infestations. Candle wax is removed by placing a towel over the affected carpet area and applying steam from a clothes iron until the wax absorbs into the towel. Some traditional methods of stain removal remain successful and ecological. Caution should be used when treating natural fibers such as wool. The longer the stain material remains in the carpet, the higher the chance of permanent color change, even if all the original stain material is removed. At times pets urinate on the carpet and this results in a bad odor especially when it is hot and humid. The carpet or rug is usually taken outside and immersed in water to remove such stains. Immediately blotting (not rubbing) the stain material as soon as possible will help reduce the chances of permanent color change. Artificial food coloring stains are generally considered permanent stains. These may be removed by professional cleaners or deep cleaning rental machines with heat-transfer stain-reducing chemicals, but carry risks of burning the carpet. Stain removal products can be combined with anti-allergen treatments to kill house dust mites. = Other = Carpet rods, rattan rugbeaters, carpet-beating machines, brooms, brushes, dustpans, and shaking and hanging were all carpet-cleaning methods of the 19th century; brooms particularly carry risks of wear.

Bronze statue of Kui Xing, late Ming Dynasty. Kui Xing (), originally called 奎星 (also kuí xīng), also known as 大魁夫子 \\"Great Master Kui\\" or 大魁星君 \\"Great Kui the Star Lord\\", is a character in Chinese mythology, the god of examinations, and an associate or servant of the god of literature, Wen Chang. The name 'Kui Xing' literally means \\"Chief Star(s)\\", and anciently referred to the 'spoon' of the Big Dipper. The Chun Qiu Yun Dou Shu defines the ‘Kui Xing' as \\"The four stars in the first section of the dipper\\". The 'handle' was referred to as the 杓 shao, or ladle/spoon. Kui Xing's original name, 奎星, is the original name of the star in the Big Dipper located furthest from the 'handle' - Dubhe. Folk beliefs ao (depicted as a fish), on Xiao Family Temple in Xinwupu, Yangxin County, Hubei In Daoist tradition, Kui Xing is said to have been \\"bent and hunchbacked, as if he were an actual calligraphy character\\", and came to be viewed as a saint of human fortune, particularly with regard to imperial examinations. Late Ming Dynasty scholar Gu Yan-Wu, often referred to as Gu Ting-Lin, wrote of Kui Xing in his Record of Historical Knowledge: \\"The date of the beginning of modern people's veneration of Kui Xing is unknown. Since Kui (奎) was taken to be the master of composition, therefore the people established shrines to venerate him. Being unable to sculpt an image of the star (奎), his name was thus changed to [the homophonous character] 魁. Again being unable to directly construct an image of 魁, the character was split into its constituent radicals [鬼 Gui - Ghost/Spirit and 斗 Dou - Ladle/Gourd] and illustrated as such.\\" Gu's statement suggests the name change was a creative measure designed to facilitate Kui Xing's veneration. As his form developed, people depicted Kui Xing's right foot standing on a character 鰲 (ao), a giant turtle, in reference to a traditional saying, 獨佔鰲頭, \\"to stand lonely on the ao's head\\", meaning coming in first in examinations), his left foot support a ladle, a writing brush in his hand, and his body full of vigor and life. Stylized calligraphy of Confucian adages often compose his torso. Artists have also depicted the ao on which Kui Xing stands as a giant fish (see the image of a temple in Xinwupu, Hubei), or as a realistic-looking turtle (e.g., the statue near Bijiacheng - the \\"Brush-rest wall\\" - in Changde, Hunan笔架城及“魁星点斗”雕像落成 (Statue of \\"Kui Xing pointing the dipper\\" near Bijiacheng, in Changde, Hunan)).

History Alfred Nicholas Memorial Gardens Lake at the gardens Built during the late 1920s and 1930s, the property was named after the English National Forest of Beech trees in the county of Buckinghamshire, near the location of Nicholas's United Kingdom Aspro factory. The architect was Harry Norris, who had toured Europe and America in 1929 for G J Coles to research the latest elements in chain-store design and construction before he finalised the plans for Coles store No. 12, the Bourke Street store, in Melbourne. Nicholas and Norris were neighbours in Melbourne, and Norris was engaged to design a house with the brief that it was to have “fresh air, sunshine and an outlook of command, yet under control”. Nicholas visited the Chelsea Flower Show in 1929, obtained many plants and engaged a Cornishman, Percival Trevaskis, to do the landscaping. Norris’s design was for a three- storey mansion in the Art Deco Streamline Moderne style. The house was completed in 1933. The lines are said to be reminiscent of an ocean liner. The zig-zag motif was used as decoration on the decorative wrought-iron work and the balcony balustrades. The exterior of the house was of reinforced concrete, painted white and decorated with Australian motifs of koalas and possums in moulded relief panels. A contemporary journal article cited in a 1980s pamphlet stated that the house included a “private theaterette with talkie equipment”, an “electric pipe-organ” in the music room, orchid houses, a dairy with “prize Jersey cows”, and the gardens included artificial waterfalls, a lake and floodlighting at night. Nicholas died in 1937 and was survived by his widow, Isabel and two children.John M. Wall Nicholas, Alfred Michael (1881 - 1937) Entry in Australian Dictionary of Biography online (written 1988) In 1941, during World War II, the house was loaned as a children’s hospital. After the war from 1948-50 it was redecorated by Nicholas’s widow. Mrs Nicholas moved from the house to Toorak in Melbourne in 1954. Two additional wings called the Garden and Forest wings were constructed during the 1950s and 1960s. From 1955, the Nicholas Institute used the house as a research facility. The gardens, having been named the ‘Alfred Nicholas Memorial Gardens’, were donated to the Shire of Sherbrooke in 1965 and were transferred to the Forest Commission of Victoria in 1973. In 1981 the house was sold and operated as a small hotel for about a decade. Redevelopment The hotel was last operated by Adrian Zencha (Aman Resorts) in 1991. A group of investors commenced works in 2005 but ceased those works in 2008. The property was purchased in 2010 by investor Adam Garrisson (Oriental Pacific Group)Marc Pallisco Sherbrooke's Burnham Beeches Estate sold at RealEstateSource.co.au, 10 May 2010 and chef and restaurateur Shannon Bennett. The pair have proposed to utilise the buildings and grounds to create a \\"sustainable resort\\" with hotel, spa, wellness centre, villas, café, bakery, function areas and restaurant. The proposal is ambitious with much residential accommodation included, and is therefore proving to be contentious because of the possible adverse impact on existing residents and the overall very special nature of the Sherbrooke/Dandenongs region; there are also concerns over health and safety issues such as traffic management and bushfire response. The proposal was rejected pending further information at the Yarra Ranges Council meeting of 11 August 2015.

They may be multi-storied with a bullock turning a water wheel to raise the well water to the first or second floor. They are most common in western India and are also found in the other more arid regions of the Indian subcontinent, extending into Pakistan.

Stepwells are examples of the many types of storage and irrigation tanks that were developed in India, mainly to cope with seasonal fluctuations in water availability. A basic difference between stepwells on the one hand, and tanks and wells on the other, is that stepwells make it easier for people to reach the groundwater and to maintain and manage the well. The builders dug deep trenches into the earth for dependable, year- round groundwater. They lined the walls of these trenches with blocks of stone, without mortar, and created stairs leading down to the water. The majority of surviving stepwells originally served a leisure purpose as well as providing water. This was because the base of the well provided relief from the daytime heat, and this was increased if the well was covered. Stepwells also served as a place for social gatherings and religious ceremonies. Usually, women were more associated with these wells because they were the ones who collected the water. Also, it was they who prayed and offered gifts to the goddess of the well for her blessings. This led to the building of some significant ornamental and architectural features, often associated with dwellings and in urban areas. It also ensured their survival as monuments. Stepwells usually consist of two parts: a vertical shaft from which water is drawn and the surrounding inclined subterranean passageways, chambers and steps which provide access to the well. The galleries and chambers surrounding these wells were often carved profusely with elaborate detail and became cool, quiet retreats during the hot summers.  Names  A number of distinct names, sometimes local, exist for stepwells. In Hindi-speaking regions, they include names based on baudi (including bawdi (), bawri, baoli, bavadi, and bavdi). In Gujarati and Marwari language, they are usually called vav or vaav (). Other names include kalyani or pushkarani (Kannada), baoli () and barav ().  History  The 18th-century Baoli Ghaus Ali Shah, in Farrukhnagar, Haryana Agrasen Ki Baoli in New Delhi The stepwell may have originated to ensure water during periods of drought. The earliest archaeological evidence of wells provided with steps to reach them is found at Dholavira while the site also has water tanks or reservoirs which are also provided with flights of steps. Mohenjo Daro's great bath is also provided with steps on opposite directions. Ashokan inscriptions mention construction of step wells along major indian roads at a distance of every 8 kos for the convenience of travellers, but Ashoka states that it was a well established practice which predated him and was done by former kings as well.. The first rock-cut stepwells in India date from 200-400 AD. The earliest example of a bath-like pond reached by steps is found at Uperkot caves in Junagadh. These caves are dated to the 4th century. Navghan Kuvo, a well with the circular staircase in the vicinity, is another example. It was possibly built in Western Satrap (200-400 AD) or Maitraka (600-700 AD) period, though some place it as late as the 11th century. The nearby Adi Kadi ni Vav was constructed either in the second half of the 10th century or the 15th century. The stepwells at Dhank in Rajkot district are dated to 550-625 AD. The stepped ponds at Bhinmal (850-950 AD) are followed by it.Livingston & Beach, page xxiii The stepwells were constructed in the southwestern region of Gujarat around 600 AD; from there they spread north to Rajasthan and subsequently to the north and west India. Initially used as an art form by Hindus, the construction of these stepwells hit its peak during Muslim rule from the 11th to 16th century. One of the earliest existing example of stepwells was built in the 11th century in Gujarat, the Mata Bhavani's Stepwell. A long flight of steps leads to the water below a sequence of multi-story open pavilions positioned along the east/west axis. The elaborate ornamentation of the columns, brackets and beams are a prime example of how stepwells were used as a form of art. The Mughal emperors did not disrupt the culture that was practiced in these stepwells and encouraged the building of stepwells. The authorities during the British Raj found the hygiene of the stepwells less than desirable and installed pipe and pump systems to replace their purpose. Significance The stepwell ensures the availability of water during periods of drought. The stepwells had social, cultural and religious significance. These stepwells were proven to be well- built sturdy structures, after withstanding earthquakes. Details Many stepwells have ornamentation and details as elaborate as those of Hindu temples. Proportions in relationship to the human body were used in their design, as they were in many other structures in Indian architecture. In India A number of surviving stepwells can be found across India, including in Rajasthan, Gujarat, Delhi, Madhya Pradesh, Maharashtra, and North Karnataka (Karnataka). In 2016 a collaborative mapping project, Stepwell Atlas,Stepwell Atlas started to map GPS coordinates and collate information on stepwells. Over 2800 stepwells have so far been mapped. In his book Delhi Heritage: Top 10 Baolis, Vikramjit Singh Rooprai mentions that Delhi alone has 32 stepwells. Out of these, 16 are lost, but their locations can be traced. Of the remaining 16, only 14 are accessible to public and the water level in these keeps varying, while 3 are now permanently dry. Significant stepwells include: The Rani ki vav, Patan, Gujarat Adalaj ni Vav at Adalaj, Gandhinagar, Gujarat Toor Ji Ki Bawari, stepped well, Jodhpur Stepped well, Hampi Jachcha Ki Baori in Hindaun, Rajasthan * Agrasen ki Baoli, New Delhi * Rajon ki baoli, New Delhi * Chand Baori in Abhaneri near Jaipur, Rajasthan * Rani ki vav at Patan, Gujarat * Adalaj ni Vav at Adalaj, Gandhinagar, Gujarat * Dada Harir Stepwell, Ahmedbad * Navghan Kuvo and Adi Kadi vav, Uparkot Fort, Junagadh * Toor Ji Ki Baori, Jodhpur * Birkha Bawari, Jodhpur * Shahi Baoli, Lucknow * Raniji ki Baori in Bundi, Rajasthan; Bundi has over 60 baolis in and around the town. * Panna Meena ka Kund, Amer, India * Udoji ki Baori, Mandholi, Rajasthan *Kalyani, Hulikere *Bhoga Nandeeshwara Temple, Karnataka *Sree Peralassery Temple, Kerala In Pakistan Stepwells from Mughal periods still exist in Pakistan. Some are in preserved conditions while others are not. * Rohtas Fort, near Jhelum * Wan Bhachran, near Mianwali * Losar Baoli, near Islamabad * Losar Baoli, Sher Shah Park Wah Cantt * Makli Baoli, near Thatta Stepped ponds Shravanabelagola stepped pond, Karnataka Stepped ponds are very similar to stepwells in terms of purpose but it is important to recognize the difference between these two types of structures. Generally, stepped ponds accompany nearby temples while stepwells are more isolated. Additionally, stepwells are dark and barely visible from the surface, while stepped ponds are illuminated by the light from the sun. Also, stepwells are quite linear in design compared to the rectangular shape of stepped ponds. Influence Candi Tikus, a 14th century bathing place and step well in Majapahit empire capital city, Trowulan Archaeological Park, East Java, Indonesia Stepwells influenced many other structures in Indian architecture, especially those that incorporate water into their design. For example, the Aram Bagh in Agra was the first Mughal garden in India. It was designed by the Mughal emperor Babur and reflected his notion of paradise not only through water and landscaping but also through symmetry by including a reflecting pool in the design. He was inspired by stepwells and felt that one would complement the garden of his palace. Many other Mughal gardens include reflecting pools to enhance the landscape or serving as an elegant entrance. Other notable gardens in India which incorporate water into their design include: * Humayun's Tomb, Nizamuddin East, Delhi * Taj Mahal, Agra * Mehtab Bagh, Agra * Safdarjung's Tomb * Shalimar Bagh (Srinagar), Jammu and Kashmir * Nishat Gardens, Jammu and Kashmir * Yadvindra Gardens, Pinjore * Khusro Bagh, Allahabad * Roshanara Bagh See also * Check dam * Ghat * History of stepwells in Gujarat * Johad * Liman * Subak (irrigation) * Taanka * Tube well * Water well Notes References *Rima Hooja: \\"Channeling Nature: Hydraulics, Traditional Knowledge Systems, And Water Resource Management in India – A Historical Perspective\\".

In the , Forest Lake had a population of 22,904 people. It was the first Master Planned Community within the City of Brisbane.  Geography  Forest Lake was considered instrumental in the creation of affordable housing within Australia. The development was the first modern-day community to contain small lot product, a first during its time. The master-planned community contained retail, commercial, educational, residential, retirement, and recreational uses. The entire community is linked by an extensive network of pedestrian and cycle paths, which are integrated into the large open-spaced network. Forest Lake lies within the Brisbane City Council municipality and is approximately from the Brisbane central business district. It adjoins the suburbs of Doolandella, Inala, Richlands and Heathwood. It successfully mixes wildlife with residential development. The Forest Lake Shopping Centre (formerly Forest Lake Village Shopping Centre) is located in Forest Lake. =Villages= The Forest Lake development consists of a series of neighborhoods known as villages. Each village was marketed separately and features an entry statement. These villages are; Woodvale Village, Parkland Village, Homestead Village, Lavender Court, Banksia Village, Pine Village, Lakeside Village, Settlers Village, The Chase, The Woods, Brooklands, Hillbrook Village, The Point, Greentree Pocket, Jetty Walk, Centennial Park, College Park, Creekwood, Creekwood Pocket, Chain of Ponds, Jubilee Crossing, The Cascades, Sanctuary Pocket, Sanctuary Point and The Peninsula. There is also a retirement village called The Terraces and an apartment precinct adjoining the Forest Lake Shopping Centre called Prima on Grand. =The Lake= Panorama of Forest Lake The centrepiece of Forest Lake is an $8.9 million, 10.9 hectare man-made recreational lake, with a perimeter of . $1.8 million was spent on the dam wall, outlet structure and boulevard embankment. It has an average depth of 2.6 with a 300 to 600 mm around the safety ledge, deepening to 4 metres in the centre. The volume of the lake is 310,000 cubic metres or 269 Olympic sized swimming pools. Surrounding the lake is 3.5 kilometres of pedestrian and cycleways and 8 hectares of adjacent parkland. It was completed and opened in 1994. History A homestead was built by Henry Farley in the late 1870s on a site that is now Homestead Park (). It was a substantial building of two-stories and timber construction. In 1881 the homestead and surrounding property were purchased by Michael' Stumpy' Durack. The surrounding area became part of \\"Archerfield Station\\". In the 1930s it was destroyed by fire, although it has been said that termites caused a great deal of damage to the structure beforehand. During World War II, there was a command post of the Darra Ordnance Ammunition Depot in the area now Forest Lake. This depot was the largest ordnance depot in the South West Pacific Area. On 31 August 2005 the Richlands-Inala History Group erected an honour stone in Homestead Park, the site of the command post, commemorating the ammunition depot and the American army camps in Inala and Wacol nearby. In the 1970s the property was acquired by Hancock Plywoods. Any timber that was of value was harvested by the company and in 1986 Hancock Plywoods decided to sell the property. With 2,170 acres and located only 18 km at its closest point to Brisbane CBD the land had considerable potential, but at that time the Brisbane market was quite depressed. Viv Hancock, Chairman of Hancock Plywoods interviewed the marketing managers and directors of the major real estate companies including, Richard Ellis Ray White, Jones Lang Wooten, LJ Hookers, Raine & Horne and several others to discuss the marketing of the property. Every company was asked to give the owner their realistic estimate on the price, the property can achieve in a sale either by auction or tender. All the companies except one, advised that the property has a market value of between $5 million to $6 million for the following reasons: * The property was poorly located close to the then Immigration Department's \\"Wacol Refugee Centre\\". * The property is adjoining Inala, a low cost housing area, then dubbed a \\"Vietnamese Getto\\" as many of the Vietnamese refugees from Wacol choose to settle nearby to visit relatives. * The property was relatively isolated from the more affluent western Brisbane suburbs of Indooroopilly, Chapel Hill, Kenmore, and Fig Tree Pocket as well as the growing new suburbs of Mount Ommaney, Jindalee and Westlake. Another main barrier was the very busy Ipswich Road which carries a high volume of trucking and commercial traffic. * The cost of infrastructure also made any development not viable according to all the agencies. * The concept put forward by all the agencies except one, was that the most suitable development on the property was the creation of 10-20 acres hobby farms or acreages as they is no requirement for the provision of sewerage and water. The development cost merely consist of the provision of roads and power which is relative cheap. They estimated that each 10acre property would be worth only $50,000 to $60,000 per allotment. * The development of Redbank Plains Shopping Centre by AV Jennings commercial had established the Redbank area as the regional centre leaving this property trapped in the \\"middle of nowhere\\" between Redbank Plains and Mount Ommaney and the western suburbs. With the prices of 700m2 suburban land in Redbanks Plains selling below $50,000 per allotment, any subdivision in the subject property would not be viable. One company however saw the property differently. Raine and Horne Commercial headed by Tony Atkinson and special consultant Oliver Tham saw a different picture of what is possible and came up with a different vision for the property and a value of $20million for the property. They saw the potential for an entirely new self- contained suburb on the property: * The property is located only 18 km as the crow flies from Brisbane CBD and remained one of the last major land bank in Brisbane for the creation of a New Master Planned Community. At that time the growth of Brisbane was stretched north as far as 50 km to Caboolture and as far as 35 km to the south to Beenleigh. By it sheer proximity to Brisbane, it is ideal for a new suburb. * At that time the Brisbane City Council advised the owners that there is a depression on the property that made is a suitable property for a landfill and offered to pay up to $5 million for the property, to use it as a much needed landfill. Oliver Tham advised the owner that \\"what the council sees as a landfill, he sees the potential of a lake or even a golf course\\" and without the smell. * The Logan Motorway was then being planned by engineers Crooks Mitchell Peacock and Steward and the future motorway will make the property, one of the most strategic suburb with access to Brisbane via the Centenary Highway and an easy drive to the Gold Coast via the planned Logan Motorway. This will allow motorist from the western suburbs to avoid the then very congested Pacific Motorway or Logan Road, as it was then called. * The net migration into Queensland required the creation of new housing stock in South East Queensland. As a result, Viv Hancock commissioned Raine and Horne represented by Oliver Tham to work with Lloyd Hancock, a consulting partner with Price Waterhouse at that time, (and a future Queenslander of the year), his youngest son to develop a viable development concept so that the property can be sold for the highest value. He intimated that he would be happy with anything more than $10 million as all the other parties said it was worth $5 million. Some of the highlights concerning the property planning and marketing and its success included: * Former cricketer, town planner John Maclean was appointed to master plan a new suburb known as \\"Woodlands\\" at that time. * The plan consisted of a new residential suburb of nearly 7,000 home allotments in a mix of residential land sizes with some medium density homes and some areas set aside for retirement living and a commercial shopping centre. * The plans will show connectivity to the western suburbs with the continuation of Centenary Highway with an overpass over Ipswich Road * The point of difference between the then \\"Woodlands\\" and other suburbs is the setting aside of approximately 20-25% of its original land area for green and blue spaces making it potentially a most livable suburb. * In several meetings with the engineers for Logan Motorway, it was agreed that a couple of ingress and egress roads should be drawn in to link the new suburb to the Motorway. (The two access points is now the Centenary highway link and Progress Road link) to allow the property to be seen to be well serviced and strategically located. * The plan was to show a viable and realistic potential new suburb. While there was no intention to formally seek approvals for the development due to time constraints. There would not have been enough time to seek the full rezoning or approvals to sell the property. At that time the Mayor of Brisbane was Sallyanne Atkinson who happens to be the sister-in-law of the Managing Director of Raine and Horne, Tony Aitkinson. In several meetings the team was able to get her support for the creation of a new suburb to accommodate the future growth of Brisbane as well as the creating a high quality and affordable new residential precinct. She instructed her chief town planner, Barry Alexander to provide a letter to support the development of a new suburb on the property. This gave any buyers a level of comfort that their application for a new suburb will be viewed favourably. * The \\"Woodlands\\" Masterplan set the template for the first Master Planned Community within the municipality of Brisbane, Queensland. Due to the cost of the planning exercise, there was less budget for marketing the property. One solution was to tap into media editorials and creating some newsworthy articles of the vision. At that time Lloyd Hancock who worked with Price Waterhouse and Oliver Tham work extensively to market the property locally and overseas. Many Japanese companies were contacted as at that time as they were investing heavily in Queensland. Some companies particularly clients of Japanese construction giant, Kumagai Gumi expressed interest to participate in a major residential development and see the potential for 10%-15% of the development to be used for \\"Corporate Retirees\\" as part of a \\"Silver City\\" concept for retiring Japanese to enjoy a higher quality of retirement life overseas for several months in a year. (The process of educating the Japanese market on the concept of having second homes in Australia led to the concept of the Multi Function Polis in North Adelaide several years later.) Many other Asian companies including, Far East of Singapore, Mbf group, Sime Darby, Lipland, YTL in Malaysia and many others in Hong Kong as well, and many other countries were approached on the development. To complement the marketing apart from advertising, the group decided to generated several news worthy articles to generate interest. They used the media to write editorials about the project to create interest as at that time there was not a great appetite for major projects of this scale in Australia. During an early media interview, a reporters were told that one of the catalysts to make the development viable, was to include a small component of homes to cater for the Japanese corporate retirement market. A dwelling by a golf course or lake could be a great \\"golden handshake\\" for those taking early retirement. It was said that the population of Forest Lake could be as high as 50,000 people and the component of overseas retirees as well as Japanese would be no more than 10%. However the information was sensationalised with a front-page article was published by the Brisbane Courier Mail, with Lloyd Hancock sporting an Akubra with the caption \\"Young Tycoon want to build retirement village for 5,000 Japanese\\". The news went \\"viral\\" and every newspaper and media source from radio and television weighed in on the controversy. RSL heavyweights and sometimes \\"rednecks\\" or nationalist which they prefer to be known, like Bruce Ruxton from Sydney suddenly became more famous overnight in his vocal tirade against the concept of Japanese retiring in Queensland The pent-up emotions of some misinformed RSL members gave the media a lot to write about and very soon the entire Asian media weighed-in on the subject. Helicopters were flying over the property on behalf of local and foreign media. Many thought that the project was to be a \\"fenced off, Japanese only retirement village\\" when in reality that was never the intention. There were many debates on television all over Australia, Asia and beyond, including a debates on migration by Jana Wendt on A Current Affair. In the real estate business there is no bad publicity, the extreme exposure brought in buyers far and wide and the price of $20million was achieved and the property was sold. The buyers was Girvans Limited and from there even English group Beezer Investments Plc became a partner. Eventually Delfin through the ANZ Bank got involved in the development when Girvans went into problems in the New Zealand and Sydney investment market. The project was renamed \\"Forest Lake\\" and Delphin which eventually became Delfin Lend Lease became the principal developer. Maha Sinnathamby the now famous developer of Greater Springfield also tried very hard to buy the property however when he was not successful. He was told by one of the consultants, \\"Look Maha, it does not matter if you cannot buy this property, find something further down the road that is twice the size and half the price and when this property is done, you will be sitting on a gold mine\\". Nearly 10 years later Maha Sinnathamby advised that he secured a property three times the size and one third the price and the result is the most successful Master Planned community in Australia, Greater Springfield. The Forest Lake concept was expanded to Springfield Lakes and Delphin Lendlease transferred its expertise by participating as a development partner in Springfield Lakes. In 1990, construction of the master planned community commenced by Delfin Lend Lease. In 1991, Forest Lake was officially launched by the then Premier of Queensland, Wayne Goss. The development lasted until 2006, when the last block of land was sold. Forest Lake State School opened on 1 January 1994. Forest Lake College (College Avenue Campus) opened in 1994. By 1998 the suburb had 10,100 residents. > The master planned community which was created by Delfin Lend Lease was so > successful, that in the latter years of the development, up to 40% of new > homes sold were purchased by existing residents. (David Keir, Project > Director 1996-2000). Grand Avenue State School opened on 1 January 1999. Forest Lake State High School opened on 1 January 2001. As the first Master Planned Community within the City of Brisbane, Forest Lake won numerous awards for its design and Delfin, the developer of Forest Lake, was absorbed into Lend Lease in 2001. Now operating as Delfin Lend Lease, they are developing the adjacent Springfield Lakes Master Planned Community. Forest Lake College (Alpine Place Campus) opened on 2002. Mary McConnel School opened on 28 January 2003. Forest Lake had a population of 20,900 residents, as of February 2006. In 2011, Forest Lake College was renamed St John's Anglican College. In 2011, the lake experienced a blue-green algae (cyanobacterial) bloom, causing some concern to local residents. A local councillor advised people to not enter the water due to the high toxicity levels from the algae bloom. The algae bloom occurred again in 2017. In the Forest Lake had a population of 22,426 people. In the , Forest Lake had a population of 22,904 people.

This liquid–liquid phase transition would be a first order, discontinuous transition between low and high density liquids (labelled 1 and 2). This is analogous to polymorphism of crystalline materials, where different stable crystalline states (solid 1, 2 in diagram) of the same substance can exist (e.g. diamond and graphite are two polymorphs of carbon). Like the ordinary liquid–gas transition, the liquid–liquid transition is expected to end in a liquid-liquid critical point. At temperatures beyond these critical points there is a continuous range of fluid states, i.e. the distinction between liquids and gasses is lost. If crystallisation is avoided the liquid–liquid transition can be extended into the metastable supercooled liquid regime. Lennard-Jones type potential, which exhibits the ordinary liquid–gas critical point. The red line is a double well type potential, which is proposed for polyamorphous systems. The grey line, is a representative of the soft core square well potentials, which in atomisitc simulations exhibit liquid–liquid transitions and a second critical point. The numbers 1 and 2 correspond to the 1st and second minima in the potentials. Polyamorphism is the ability of a substance to exist in several different amorphous modifications. It is analogous to the polymorphism of crystalline materials. Many amorphous substances can exist with different amorphous characteristics (e.g. polymers). However, polyamorphism requires two distinct amorphous states with a clear, discontinuous (first-order) phase transition between them. When such a transition occurs between two stable liquid states, a polyamorphic transition may also be referred to as a liquid–liquid phase transition. Overview Even though amorphous materials exhibit no long-range periodic atomic ordering, there is still significant and varied local structure at inter-atomic length scales (see structure of liquids and glasses). Different local structures can produce amorphous phases of the same chemical composition with different physical properties such as density. In several cases sharp transitions have been observed between two different density amorphous states of the same material. Amorphous ice is one important example (see also examples below). Several of these transitions (including water) are expected to end in a second critical point. Liquid–liquid transitions Polyamorphism may apply to all amorphous states, i.e. glasses, other amorphous solids, supercooled liquids, ordinary liquids or fluids. A liquid–liquid transition however, is one that occurs only in the liquid state (red line in the phase diagram, top right). In this article liquid–liquid transitions are defined as transitions between two liquids of the same chemical substance. Elsewhere the term liquid–liquid transition may also refer to the more common transitions between liquid mixtures of different chemical composition. The stable liquid state unlike most glasses and amorphous solids, is a thermodynamically stable equilibrium state. Thus new liquid–liquid or fluid-fluid transitions in the stable liquid (or fluid) states are more easily analysed than transitions in amorphous solids where arguments are complicated by the non-equilibrium, non-ergodic nature of the amorphous state. =Rapoport's theory= Liquid–liquid transitions were originally considered by Rapoport in 1967 in order to explain high pressure melting curve maxima of some liquid metals. Rapoport's theory requires the existence of a melting curve maximum in polyamorphic systems. =Double well potentials= One physical explanation for polyamorphism is the existence of a double well inter-atomic pair potential (see lower right diagram). It is well known that the ordinary liquid–gas critical point appears when the inter-atomic pair potential contains a minimum. At lower energies (temperatures) particles trapped in this minimum condense into the liquid state. At higher temperatures however, these particles can escape the well and the sharp definition between liquid and gas is lost. Molecular modelling has shown that addition of a second well produces an additional transition between two different liquids (or fluids) with a second critical point. Examples of polyamorphism Polyamorphism has been experimentally observed or theoretically suggested in silicon, liquid phosphorus, triphenyl phosphate, mannitol, and in some other molecular network-forming substances. =Water and structural analogues= The most famous case of polyamorphism is amorphous ice. Pressurizing conventional hexagonal ice crystals to about 1.6 GPa at liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) converts them to the high-density amorphous ice. Upon releasing the pressure, this phase is stable and has density of 1.17 g/cm3 at 77 K and 1 bar. Consequent warming to 127 K at ambient pressure transforms this phase to a low-density amorphous ice (0.94 g/cm3 at 1 bar). Yet, if the high-density amorphous ice is warmed up to 165 K not at low pressures but keeping the 1.6 GPa compression, and then cooled back to 77 K, then another amorphous ice is produced, which has even higher density of 1.25 g/cm3 at 1 bar. All those amorphous forms have very different vibrational lattice spectra and intermolecular distances. A similar abrupt liquid- amorphous phase transition is predicted in liquid silicon when cooled under high pressures. This observation is based on first principles molecular dynamics computer simulations, and might be expected intuitively since tetrahedral amorphous carbon, silicon, and germanium are known to be structurally analogous to water. =Oxide liquids and glasses= Yttria- alumina melts are another system reported to exhibit polyamorphism. Observation of a liquid–liquid phase transition in the supercooled liquid has been reported. Though this is disputed in the literature. Polyamorphism has also been reported in Yttria-Alumina glasses. Yttria-Alumina melts quenched from about 1900 °C at a rate ~400 °C/s, can form glasses containing a second co-existing phase. This happens for certain Y/Al ratios (about 20–40 mol% Y2O3). The two phases have the same average composition but different density, molecular structure and hardness. However whether the second phase is glassy or crystalline is also debated. Continuous changes in density were observed upon cooling silicon dioxide or germanium dioxide. Although continuous density changes do not constitute a first order transition, they may be indicative of an underlying abrupt transition. =Organic materials= Polyamorphism has also been observed in organic compounds, such as liquid triphenyl phosphite at temperatures between 210 K and 226 K and n-butanol at temperatures between 120 K and 140 K. Polyamorphism is also an important area in pharmaceutical science. The amorphous form of a drug typically has much better aqueous solubility (compared to the analogous crystalline form) but the actual local structure in an amorphous pharmaceutical can be different, depending on the method used to form the amorphous phase. Mannitol is the first pharmaceutical substance featuring polyamorphism. In addition to the regular amorphous phase, a second amorphous phase can be prepared at room temperature and pressure. This new phase has substantially lower energy, lower density and higher glass transition temperature. Since mannitol is widely used in pharmaceutical tablet formulations, mannitol polyamorphism offers a powerful tool to engineer the property and behavior of tablets.

Characteristics The Czech Warmblood is a robust, powerful horse bred with strong bones. The breed has a strong neck on an elegant body, a broad, long back, and good hooves, though they are sometimes flat. The mane and tail are very thick. The Czech Warmblood is a relatively long-lived, unpretentious and relentless horse. The breed is willing and teachable with a very good temperament. Most are black, chestnut, bay or dark bay. Breed history The Czech Warmblood was in existence by the time of the Austro-Hungarian Empire (1876–1918). In the 19th century the breed was influenced by Spanish and Italian horses, and later by breeds such as the Furioso, Gidran, Nonius and Przedswit (horse) breeds. German Warmblood horses also played a part. The most famous and successful line is the Bystrý. The founder was Stallion 469, foaled in 1919. The line is characterized by a robustness, shorter and a less solid run, steeper and a shorter fetlock. They are mainly bay horses. The stud farm in Kladruby plays a major role in the breeding of the Czech Warmblood. In the pedigree book, many other breeds are mentioned, for example Thoroughbred, Selle Français, Arabian and Anglo-Arabian. Uses Czech Warmbloods are suited to all horse sports. They are good at dressage and horse racing and are also capable of lighter farm and forest work, hunting and jumping. In 2013 the population was reported as about 22,000.

Sealaska’s primary economic drivers are natural resources, land management, environmental services and seafood. Shareholders At incorporation, Sealaska enrolled 15,782 Alaska Natives, each of whom received 100 shares of Sealaska stock. Approximately 1,800 additional Alaska Natives have since received Sealaska stock through inheritance of shares or gifting. As an ANCSA corporation, Sealaska has no publicly traded stock and its shares cannot legally be sold. Sealaska shareholders voted on June 23, 2007 to enroll qualified descendants of original shareholders by issuing them 100 shares of life estate stock in Sealaska. However, unlike shares of original shareholders, the new shares would expire on the descendant's death and could not be willed or gifted. To be eligible, descendants must be children or grandchildren of original Sealaska shareholders, must be of at least one-quarter Alaska Native descent, and must not be a member of any other regional corporation unless through inheritance or gift. Sealaska is one of the few ANCSA Regional Corporations to elect to enroll descendants and allot them shares. Sealaska has established a Permanent Fund, comprising investments in stocks, bonds, real estate and private equity funds, as a source of shareholder dividends. Sealaska reinvests a significant portion of its earnings back into its community-oriented subsidiaries, as well as offers its own opportunities for young shareholders. Program offerings include things like scholarships for both full- and part- time students, wellness and culture camps, summer internships, and the Board Youth Advisor position. Lands From ANCSA section 14, Sealaska owns approximately of surface estate and of subsurface estate in Southeast Alaska. Despite having the most shareholders of any regional corporation, it received the least amount of land in the 44 million acre settlement. Sealaska received a second conveyance of land, approximately 65,000 acres, as a result of advocacy in Congress. Sealaska's current land holdings in Southeast Alaska are roughly 1.6 percent of the traditional homelands that the Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian people inhabited for more than 10,000 years. There are also five traditional communities that were left out of the original ANCSA conveyance. Sealaska is working to get these communities the land due to them.

Some of these exotic populations have become very large, with densities of 10,000 per square metre being reported from the St. Johns River in Florida.Pererea G. & Walls J. G. (1996).

Ecology This is primarily a burrowing species that tends to be most active at night. = Habitat = Although normally a freshwater snail, this species is very tolerant of brackish water, and has been recorded in waters with a salinity of 32.5 ppt (1,024 specific gravity salinity). It is however a warm-climate species. It appears to prefer a temperature range of 18 to 25 °C or of 18 to 32 °C. Research has been conducted to determine the snail's lethal high water temperature, which is about 50 °C (120 degrees Fahrenheit). This information is helpful in the disinfection of fishing gear and research equipment, which otherwise may inadvertently spread the snails to uninfested waters.Mitchell A., USDA-ARS, personal communication. In: Benson A. J.. (2008). Melanoides tuberculatus. USGS Nonindigenous Aquatic Species Database, Gainesville, FL. Revision Date: 4/24/2006. This species is resistant to low oxygen levels.

Females can be recognized by their greenish coloured gonads while males have reddish gonads. Under good conditions, females will produce fertilised eggs that are transferred to a brood pouch where they remain until they hatch (parthenogenesis and viviparity). Melanoides tuberculata has 1–64 embryos in its brood pouch. Snails will begin reproducing at a size as small as 5 mm or 10 mm in length and broods may contain over seventy offspring (iteroparity). The size of the shell of the parent at peak release of juveniles is 20.0 mm. The size of juveniles at birth is 1.2-2.2 mm.

(1996). Aquarium Atlas (vol. 1) p. 899, Voyageur Press, . Among aquarists, these snails are known as Malayan livebearing snails or Malayan/Malaysian trumpet snails (often abbreviated to MTS).

It is in the north-east of the city, near Burslem. Smallthorne borders Bradeley and Chell in the north, Norton-in-the- Moors in the east, Sneyd Green in the south, and Burslem in the west. History =Administration= Although all of Smallthorne falls comfortably within Stoke-on-Trent North parliamentary constituency, for local government purposes it was split between two different electoral wards: Burslem North and East Valley. The part of Smallthorne that falls within East Valley is sometimes referred to as New Ford and has an active Residents Association of the same name. The Burslem North part of Smallthorne also has an active Community Group called A Better Smallthorne and Julie Walton is the current chair. In 2011 Smallthorne was united and became a single ward and in 2015 one Councillor was elected who was Candi Chetwynd, the Labour Party candidate, she took over from Matt Wilcox. For 115 years Smallthorne was administratively separate from Stoke-on-Trent. From 1807 to 1894, Smallthorne (and Ford Green), along with Bemersley, Norton, Norton Green, and Milton, was part of the Norton-in-the-Moors Parish. An Act of Parliament, entitled 'An Act for separating the Chapelries and Chapels of Newcastle-under-Lyme, Burslem, Whitmore, Bucknall-cum-Bagnall and Norton-in-the-Moors, from the Rectory and Parish Church of Stoke-upon-Trent, and for making them five district rectories', was passed in 1807. For Poor Law purposes, the parish became part of Leek Union in 1834. A visitor in the 1850s observed that \\"the whole parish is a cold and hilly country, abounding in coal, which is got at various depths, in beds from four to seven feet thick\\". Smallthorne was from 1894 to 1922 part of the Smallthorne Urban District. In 1922 the urban district was wound up, with the bulk of it becoming part of the county borough of Stoke-on- Trent. The building that once served as the council HQ is still in existence and can be found near Smallthorne Cemetery. The HQ acted as a clinic then became a public library before that closed in the early 1990s. It now serves as an undertakers' premises. The Smallthorne Urban District Council crest can be seen on this building still but bears the words Smallthorne Burial Board. One interesting side effect of the fact that the Potteries' six towns and Smallthorne were administratively separate was the duplication of many street names. This led to significant confusion after unification. Thus, in the early 1950s a large number of streets had to be renamed. In Smallthorne twenty streets were given new names, including Ford Green Road (formerly Leek Road), Coseley Street (formerly Edward Street) and Preston Street (formerly Wedgwood Street). The actual date for the name changes in Smallthorne can be found in several documents and is shown to be 27 August 1951 =Industry= Today, there is virtually no sign of heavy industry in Smallthorne but this is a relatively recent development. The district used to be criss-crossed by a canal and numerous mineral lines servicing five collieries – Cornhill, Holden Lane, Intake, Norton and Pinfold; the Ford Green Ironworks; a forge; and a chain, cable and anchor works. These lines joined the main Biddulph Valley Line near Ford Green Hall. The Foxley, a branch of the Caldon Canal, itself a branch of the Trent and Mersey Canal, fell into complete disuse with the arrival of the railways and its remains have almost all been obliterated over time. The Biddulph Valley Line, later part of the North Staffordshire Railway, was opened in 1859 and a passenger station called 'Ford Green and Smallthorne' began service in 1864. Passenger services between Stoke and Biddulph ceased in 1927 but some special excursion trains continued until 1962. With the decline of the heavy industries all along the route, the line was gradually downgraded until the last section between Ford Green and Milton Junction closed in 1977 (when Norton Colliery closed). Until the late 1970s Smallthorne was a coal mining area. In the mid 1960s there were three large collieries, Norton (Ford Green), Sneyd (Burslem) and Hanley Deep Pit, within a mile or less of 'Smallthorne Bank' (the main shopping area today) and a number of others were within an easy commuting distance. One of the many workingmen's clubs scattered throughout the surrounding district is still called the Norton Miners Welfare Institute and Cricket Club and is located off Community Drive in Smallthorne. = St. Saviours Church = St Saviour's Church In 1850 fewer than 2000 people lived in Smallthorne and the area was part of the rural parish of Norton in the Moors. People worked in the mines owned by Lord Norton or the ironworks owned by Robert Heath. St Bartholomew's, Norton was too small to serve the growing population and Lord Norton donated a land and money for a church. He also donated land for a church school, endowed the Minister with £80 a year and, in 1851, gave a site valued at £400 for a vicarage. The new church building at Smallthorne was still too small. In 1885 Robert Heath added the South Aisle and North transept at a cost of £1000. By the early 1990s, the church building was nearly 150 years old and showing its age. The church council and congregation took the opportunity to carry out extensive restoration work. =Primitive Methodism= One of the Smallthorne streets off Ford Green Road is called 'Primitive Street'. For a hundred years or more, it contained two complete rows of unspectacular terraced housing. Those houses are now demolished and the area has been partially redeveloped. The street's significance lies in its name. 'Primitive Street' is named after Primitive Methodism, which, in the mid nineteenth century, was an influential Protestant Christian movement. There was a Primitive Methodist Chapel close by in Sangster Lane, as well as Victoria Methodist (recently demolished after a fire) and Salem Methodist. There were numerous such chapels throughout the North Staffordshire coalfield until, in 1932, the three main Methodist groups in Britain, the Wesleyans, Primitive Methodists and United Methodists came together to form the present Methodist Church. In recent years many have closed and now only one, Salem Methodist, remains in Smallthorne. Built in 1874, it was restored in 2010 after funds were raised and grants received to enable the building to meet the laws for disability access.http://www.midlandsheritage.co.uk/churches-chapels-etc/6905-salem- methodist-church-smallthorne-stoke-trent.html Primitive Methodism was founded by two Stoke-on-Trent Christian converts: Bucknall-born Hugh Bourne (1772–1852) and Burslem-born William Clowes (1780–1851). Bourne, and his supporters, were originally known as 'Camp Meeting Methodists' because they organised large open-air meetings for preaching, prayer and the public declaration of sin. From a vantage point on Chetwynd Street, outside Smallthorne Primary School, you can see three important places in the early history of the movement: Mow Cop, the site of the first two Camp Meetings on Sunday 31 May 1807 and 19 July; Norton-in-the-Moors, the location of the third Camp Meeting on 23 August 1807; and Chatterley Whitfield Colliery winding gear and spoil heap behind which can be found the small former mining village of Bemersley, where Hugh Bourne lived and died. In 1907 the Primitive Methodists celebrated their centenary with a new Camp Meeting at Mow Cop that attracted around 100,000 people. Primitive Methodists were popularly nicknamed 'Ranters' because of their tendency to sing hymns in the street. Before the age of state education, many of Smallthorne's children would have received their elementary education from 'Ranters' in Primitive Methodist Sunday Schools. = St Mary's Church = A chapel was opened at St Mary's Roman Catholic school in Queen Street (now Brierley Street), Smallthorne, in 1875. It was served from St. Peter's, Cobridge, until 1895 when it was transferred to the new Burslem mission. A mission including Burslem, Smallthorne, and Wolstanton was formed out of the Cobridge mission in 1895 with the assistant priest from Cobridge as resident priest. Smallthorne became a separate parish in 1923 there has been a resident priest since then and the Roman Catholic population of the parish has remained at about 600 since the late 1920s A then new building was built in 1905, it was situated between Queen Street (now Brierley Street) and Lord Street although the terraces above and below were probably not there until after 1909. There is a date stone on the Brierley Street side of the building showing 1905. The other boundaries were Camp Road to the south west and what would be Edward Street (now Coseley Street) to the north east. The last marriage at the Smallthorne site was in 1968 with the new site at Norton opening in 1969. The new St Mary’s with a separate Church and School is situated on Ford Green Road at Norton opposite Spragg House Lane. Demographics Smallthorne has a large elderly population, twice the City's average. Nearly a third of its residents live in council housing and there is an even larger proportion in terraced housing (Source: 2001 Census). According to the Council’s Neighbourhood Area Profile (July 2006), Smallthorne \\"is typified by large areas of owned terraced housing and significant areas of semi-detached council-housing\\". The average gross household income of Smallthorne residents is lower than the City's average but there are ten other neighbourhoods in the City that are poorer (Source: CACI Ltd). Social housing in the area is usually very sought after and private house prices are buoyant. Steve Johnston (July 2006) \\"Neighbourhood Area Profile: Smallthorne NA23\\", Knowledge Management, Stoke on Trent City Council; Present day Ford Green Road The hub of the community is around the junction of Ford Green Road, known locally as 'Smallthorne Bank', and Community Drive. Here can be found a community hall, an NHS health centre, a chemist, a sub-post office, a number of other shops, a restaurant, an Oatcake shop and take-aways. Smallthorne's community hall was one of only twelve council-owned, community-run halls in the city. Today, many of these Halls are social enterprises owned by local Trusts. In addition to its community hall, Smallthorne has two churches [Saint Saviours Church of England Parish and Salem Methodist Chapel – part of the Stoke-on-Trent (Burslem) Circuit of the Methodist Church] and two primary schools (Smallthorne and New Ford). Both primary schools are 'feeder schools' for Haywood Engineering College in Burslem, with a significant minority of pupils choosing to attend Excel Academy in Sneyd Green or St. Margaret Ward's Catholic High School and Performing Arts College in Tunstall. There are six public houses in Smallthorne The Forrester's Arms (Last Orders), The White Hart (The Barrel), The Kings Head (nickname Scrimmies), the Green Star, The Ford (historically The Railway Hotel) was converted to flats and the Swan Inn which was recently converted into two maisonettes (170 and 170A Ford Green Road) and three Workingmen's Clubs (Norton Miners Institute, the Pioneer WMC and Institute on Chetwynd Street and the Victory WMC and Institute on Hanley Road – a member of the Working Men's Club and Institute Union). Smallthorne once had an abundance of public houses many of which have been demolished or converted. Landmarks Ford Green Hall Ford Green Hall is a farmhouse originally built in 1624. It stands on land adjacent to the B5051 minor road in the east of Smallthorne. It is the only timber-framed yeoman farmer's house still surviving in Stoke-on-Trent. Originally, it stood in of farmland, but this has been gradually encroached upon over the years so that now it is surrounded by comparatively small grounds. Beyond its grounds there is now housing, a busy minor road, and a nature reserve. The house functions as a 17th-century period historic house museum, managed by Stoke-on-Trent City Council. Ford Green Hall has now been transferred to Ford Green Hall Ltd, a charitable organisation. Led by volunteers and members of the local community, the company’s profits will be used to run and improve the museum. Ford Green Hall is continuing to work closely with Stoke-on-Trent City Council and its museums. stokemuseums.org.uk Ford Green Hall is one of three listed buildings in Smallthorne. The others are Ford Green Farm built in the mid 18th century and St. Saviours Church. =Green Star public house and Esperanto= The Green Star A Lord Mayor of Stoke-on-Trent in the 1950s, Horace Barks was a strong advocate of Esperanto (gaining the nickname Mr Esperanto). When 'The Green Star', a Smallthorne pub, was being built Barks requested that the brewery add the words 'la verda stelo' (the pub's name in Esperanto) onto the side of the building (the green star is a symbol of Esperanto). The brewer agreed. Green Star Public House, Esperanto Way, Smallthorne, Stoke-on-Trent The Green Star can still be found on the corner of Esperanto Way, a stone's throw from Zamenhof Grove (named for the creator of Esperanto) though from some time in 2005 the sign saying 'la verda stelo' is no longer displayed. The office and administrative centre of 'Esperanto-Asocio de Britio' (Esperanto Association of Britain) is just outside Stoke-on-Trent in the Wedgwood Memorial College, Barlaston. Horace Barks helped set up the first courses there in 1960.

(Cricket Wireless). It was headquartered in San Diego, California. Leap Wireless and Cricket Wireless are both subsidiaries of AT&T.; Leap was founded in 1999 and was built on the premise of unlimited services with no contracts and no credit checks, providing access to wireless services to customers who couldn’t otherwise afford it, didn't want the long-term commitment of a one- or two- year contract, or had a moral or religious objection to a credit check. A credit check is normally required for contract plans offered by telecommunications companies. Leap has all-digital CDMA 1X, EV-DO and LTE networks that have expanded significantly in the past few years. On July 12, 2013, AT&T; agreed to buy Leap Wireless for $1.2 billion. On March 13, 2014, the Federal Communications Commission approved the merger between AT&T; and Leap Wireless. On the same day Leap announced the completion of the acquisition by AT&T.; Cricket Wireless Cricket Communications, Inc. d.b.a. Cricket Wireless or simply Cricket, founded in 1999, was a subsidiary of Leap Wireless International, Inc. prior to Leap's acquisition by AT&T.; It provides prepaid wireless services in the United States. Jump Mobile Jump Mobile was a subsidiary of Leap Wireless International, Inc. The pre-paid wireless service was not an MVNO, as it used its parent company’s CDMA 1xEV-DO network to provide pre-paid wireless services to its customers. Jump Mobile launched in its first market in 2005, and discontinued services and operations in 2010. Jump Mobile offered prepaid mobile phone services to customers in 25 U.S. states. Leap Wireless retired the Jump Mobile brand on February 26, 2010, and migrated all customers to its Cricket Wireless \\"Pay Go\\" service. Leap Wireless was subsequently acquired by AT&T.; Jump Mobile's features allowed customers unlimited incoming calls from any country, and outgoing calls within the coverage area for a per-minute charge, and unlimited text messaging service within the United States. International text messages and calls were available for additional charges. Through the Cricket/Leap Wireless Network, coverage was about half of the continental United States, with broadband coverage in several metropolitan areas.http://www.mycricket.com/cricketcoveragemaps/ - National Coverage Tab on Page The pre-paid service included voicemail, caller ID, call waiting, three-way calling, directory assistance, ringtones, games, and wallpapers. The terms and conditions for Jump Mobile required customers to maintain paid credit on their accounts. If all funds and minutes expired, after a sixty-day grace period service lapsed and customers lost their telephone numbers. The company offered both \\"service credit\\" and \\"Airtime To Go\\"; the former expired within a fixed period that began when the credit was applied and that varied based on the amount. \\"Airtime to Go\\" had the same range of expiration periods (from 15 to 100 days) but the countdown to expiration didn't begin until the airtime was activated. History *Leap Wireless was founded in 1999, spun off as an independently traded company from San Diego-based Qualcomm. Leap was started with the idea to provide affordable wireless services to a wide range of customers, without credit checks or long- term commitments. Under that principle, it founded Cricket Communications in 1999 and launched in Chattanooga, Tennessee that year. During this time, Leap also operated all-digital wireless service in Mexico and Chile under partnership with other companies. In May 2000 Leap Wireless sold its Chilean wireless operator Smartcom PCS to Endesa. *In March 2002, Leap sold its 20 percent stake in Mexican Wireless carrier Pegaso PCS to Telefónica Moviles. *On September 4, 2007, MetroPCS announced a proposal that MetroPCS and Leap Wireless could merge into a single wireless company. The proposal was withdrawn less than two months later on November 1, 2007. However, due to LEAP's current financial situation, some analysts still believe that a merger will take place. *On September 10, 2007, Leap's Chief Financial Officer Amin Khalifa, resigned. On November 9, 2007 Leap announced that it would restate its financial statements for fiscal years 2004, 2005 and 2006 and for the first and second quarters of 2007. *On December 28, 2007, filed restatements of its earnings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.

London, The Geologists' Association 1993 In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Premier enjoyed a series of exploration successes, notably the discovery of the Qadirpur gas field in Pakistan in 1990, the Fife and Angus fields in the UK Continental Shelf and the Yetagun gas field in Myanmar in 1992, as well as the offshore extension to Wytch Farm. The Yetagun transaction involved Premier entering into a deal directly with the Myanmar government. In 1995, Premier acquired Pict Petroleum. As a consequence, Amerada Hess which had a substantial stake in Pict came to hold 25% of Premier's enlarged equity. From this point, Premier was participating in numerous North Sea oil and gas fields, including Fife, Fergus, Galahad and Scott. In 1996 the Company diverted its attention to the Far east acquiring Sumatra Gulf Oil Limited, which had interests in Indonesia, and in 1997 went further buying Texaco's interests in Myanmar. In 1998, Premier and Shell brought together their exploration and production interests in Pakistan to form a joint venture company, PSP (Premier & Shell Pakistan). In May 2001, Premier announced an asset swap with Shell which dismantled the partnership and, in September 2001, the formation of a new joint venture with Kufpec called Premier Kufpec Pakistan (PKP). Premier and Kufpec unwound the PKP joint venture in July 2007. Petronas, the Malaysian oil company, decided to invest significant cash in the Company in 1999 buying a 25% stake.The Petronas stable A restructuring took place in 2002 which saw Petronas and Amerada Hess each give up their 25% holdings in Premier Oil in return for taking various Premier assets. Petronas received the Group's interest in Myanmar as well as stakes in Indonesian interests. Amerada Hess received a 23% stake in a key Natuna oil field in Indonesia.Premier worth exploring on bid hopes In 2004 the Company acquired a 75% stake in an oil interest in Vietnam. In April 2014, Premier rejected two secret bid approaches from Ophir Energy which wanted to combine both firms into an oil exploration group for around £3 billion. Premier Oil's board unanimously rejected the bid. In June 2014, the company received final approval from the UK Department of Energy and Climate Change for the development of the Catcher area oil and gas block in the North Sea, of which the company owns 50% and has operating rights. Oil was expected to be flowing by mid-2017. In January 2016, its shares were suspended pending an announcement, regarding potential acquisition of assets by Premier which might be regarded as a reverse takeover. Trading recommenced on 1 February 2016, with the company announcing that it had agreed to acquire the whole of E.ON's UK North Sea assets for a net consideration of $120 million. In July 2017, Premier Oil's shares rose nearly 40 percent on news it discovered potentially more than 1 billion barrels of oil off the coast of Mexico in the Zama-1 formation, a project in which it holds a 25 percent interest in the block alongside Talos Energy and Sierra Oil and Gas.

The main office is located in Blain in Perry County, Pennsylvania in the United States. Tuscarora State Forest contains in several tracts and is located in Cumberland, Franklin, Huntingdon, Juniata, Mifflin, and Perry counties. History Tuscarora State Forest was formed as a direct result of the depletion of the forests of Pennsylvania that took place during the mid-to-late 19th century. Conservationists like Dr. Joseph Rothrock became concerned that the forests would not regrow if they were not managed properly. Lumber and iron companies had harvested the old-growth forests for various reasons. They clear cut the forests and left behind nothing but dried tree tops and rotting stumps. The sparks of passing steam locomotives ignited wildfires that prevented the formation of second growth forests. The conservationists feared that the forest would never regrow if there was not a change in the philosophy of forest management. They called for the state to purchase land from the lumber and iron companies, and these companies were more than willing to sell their land since they had already depleted the natural resources of the forests. The changes began to take place in 1895 when Dr. Rothrock was appointed the first commissioner of the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters, the forerunner of today's Pennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources. The Pennsylvania General Assembly passed a piece of legislation in 1897 that authorized the purchase of \\"unseated lands for forest reservations.\\" This was the beginning of the State Forest system. The forest is named for Tuscarora Mountain, which is within the state forest boundaries. The mountain was named for the Tuscarora, a tribe that joined the Iroquois Nation around 1714 following the Tuscarora War in North Carolina. Tuscarora State Forest was originally part of the Rothrock Forest Reserve. It was merged with the Pennypacker and McClure reserves to form what is now Tuscarora State Forest. Much of the land was acquired from lumber and iron companies who had used the old-growth forest of hemlock, chestnut and oak to produce lumber and charcoal to fire the many iron furnaces that dotted the Pennsylvania landscape. Dr. Joseph Rothrock was an early pioneer in Pennsylvania forestry. In his position as commissioner of the Pennsylvania Department of Forests and Waters, he led the statewide effort to acquire lands that had been clear cut and left barren. Land was purchased from the lumber companies at minimal cost to the state, just a few dollars per acre. The newly purchased land was largely barren. This was due to the widespread wildfires that swept over the hills and through the valleys when the sparks cast off by passing steam trains would ignite fires in the dried tree tops that were left behind by the lumbermen. The founding of the Civilian Conservation Corps by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression was vital in creating the thriving second growth forests that make up Tuscarora State Forest today. The young men of the CCC cleared the forests and streams of dried brush. They lived in one of six camps spread throughout Tuscarora State Forest. In addition to clearing brush they also built roads, bridges and trails in the forests and constructed many of the recreational facilities still in use today at several state parks in the Tuscarora State Forest area.

His Gothic name was Hildefuns. In the Ethiopian Orthodox Tewahedo Church he is known as Saint Dexius (ደቅስዮስ Daqsəyos) based on the Ge'ez translation of the legends about his life. Although his writings were less influential outside of Hispania, Ildefonsus was canonised and remained a potent force in the peninsula for centuries.Collins, Visigothic Spain, 147. Spanish and (to a lesser extent) Portuguese missionaries spread his words worldwide. Life Ildefonsus was born to a prominent Visigothic family in Toledo during the reign of Witteric.Jocelyn N. Hillgarth, \\"Popular Religion in Visigothic Spain,\\" in James, p. 45. Civil wars racked the Visigothic kingdom during most of Ildefonsus' life. His uncle Eugenius, who later became Toledo's bishop, began educating the devout youth. Ildefonsus began his religious career circa 632 when Bishop Eladius of Toledo ordained him as a deacon. However, Ildefonse defied his family's plans for his clerical career by becoming a monk at the Agali monastery outside the city. While he was still a simple monk, he founded and endowed a monastery of nuns. Poncelet, Albert. \\"St. Ildephonsus.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 7. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 9 Mar. 2015 In 650 Ildefonsus was elected its abbot of Agali. In that capacity, he attended two synods of the Iberian church, the 8th and 9th Councils of Toledo. When his uncle Bishop Eugenius II died in 657, Ildefonsus was elected his successor as bishop of Toledo. King Recceswinth compelled him to accept the position, as Ildefonsus later complained to his protege and successor, Bishop Quiricus of Barcelona. Legends At the end of the eighth century Cixila, Archbishop of Toledo, embellished the biography of his predecessor. He relates that Ildephonsus was praying one day before the relics of Saint Leocadia when the martyr arose from her tomb and thanked the saint for the devotion he showed towards the Mother of God. It was reported that on 18 December 665 he experienced a vision of the Blessed Virgin when she appeared to him in person and presented him with a priestly vestment, to reward him for his zeal in honouring her. As Bishop Ildefonsus and the congregation sang Marian hymns, light engulfed the church, causing most worshippers to flee. The bishop, remaining with a few deacons, saw Mary descend and sit on the episcopal throne. She praised Ildefonsus for his devotion, and vested him with a special chasuble from her son's treasury, which she instructed the bishop to wear only during Marian festivals. In part because of the vision, Rome later elevated Toledo's status to the metropolitan see of Carthaginiensis, with the most authority in the Iberian Peninsula.Collins, Visigothic Spain, 168. Death and legacy Ildefonsus died after a decade in office and was buried at his (and the city's) basilica, Toledo's Church of Santa Leocadia. Another Council of Toledo decreed that henceforth 18 December would be celebrated as a Marian feast day, to commemorate his vision, although some sources claim that feast day was added to the calendar during the 10th Council (where Ildefonsus had served as a reporter), along with the Feast of the Annunciation on 25 March. Even during the Muslim occupation, when the basilica was converted into a mosque, the area where the vision occurred remained sacred and dedicated to the Virgin Mary. Pilgrims travelled to Toledo to see the stone where Mary stepped during Ildefonsus' vision. During later wars, the saint's remains were transferred Zamora, where they remain at the Church of Sts. Peter and Ildefonso. Quiricus, the dedicatee of Ildefonsus' De perpetua virginitate, succeeded him as bishop. His later successor, Julian, included Ildefonsus among the biographies added in his own continuation to the De viris illustribus. Another successor, Cixila, wrote a hagiographical life of Ildefonsus. During the 13th century, the Dominican Rodrigo de Cerrato included Ildefonsus among his vignettes of illustrious men. Ildefonsus is considered a patron saint of Toledo, Zamora, and several smaller towns. His feast day is 23 January, the date of his death. In Olula del Río (Almería), festivities begin with a bonfire and fireworks the previous night, and continue with a traditional procession of the saint's image with bread being tossed onto onlookers. Iberian missionaries spread the cult of San Ildefonso worldwide, including the San Ildefonso Peninsula and municipalities San Ildefonso, Bulacan and San Ildefonso, Ilocos Sur in the Philippines, San Ildefonso Ixtahuacán in Guatemala, San Ildefonso, San Vicente in El Salavador and San Ildefonso Pueblo, New Mexico. Theology and writings Holy Image of Ildephonsus (St. Ildefonsus Church, San Ildefonso, Bulacan, Philippines) Some consider Ildefonsus the source of common Spanish allusions to Mary as \\"the Virgin\\" rather than \\"Our Lady\\" per French or \\"the Lady\\" in Italian practice. Ildefonsus' most important work was his De perpetua virginitate Mariae contra tres infideles, which imitated an earlier work by Jerome, and became the center of Spanish Marian theology.M. C. Díaz y Díaz, \\"Literary Aspects of the Visigothic Liturgy,\\" translated by Robert Richman, Salvador Starling, Jocelyn N. Hillgarth, and Edward James, in James, p. 67. The three heretics reflected the Marian teaching of Eligius, with whom Ildefonsus disagreed theologically. Ildefonsus utilises Isidore's \\"synonymous method\\" (or Synonyma Ciceronis) for theological purposes, wherein he repeats every phrase several times in different, although purportedly identical, ways.Collins, Visigothic Spain, 163. The identifications reveal the arguments in a rhetorically strong way, and lexicographers study the synonyms Ildefonsus used. Ildefonsus also probably wrote the Visigothic Mass of Ascension, which explains how the benefits received from Christ are richer than the wonders he performed, such as \\"ascending unaided to the clouds\\".M. C. Díaz y Díaz, \\"Literary Aspects of the Visigothic Liturgy,\\" translated by Robert Richman, Salvador Starling, Jocelyn N. Hillgarth, and Edward James, in James, p. 69. Theologically, Ildefonsus regarded the Nicene Creed as sufficientem scientiam salutarem (sufficient knowledge for salvation) and as a foedus (compact) between believer and God.Jocelyn N. Hillgarth, \\"Popular Religion in Visigothic Spain,\\" in James, p. 26. Like Isidore of Seville before him, Ildefonsus regarded the creed as forming \\"two pacts\\" between God and believer: one renouncing the devil, and another the statement of belief itself.Jocelyn N. Hillgarth, \\"Popular Religion in Visigothic Spain,\\" in James, p. 27. Ildefonsus encouraged frequent Communion, implying that normal practice was infrequent, and insisted upon preparation, which may have discouraged many.Jocelyn N. Hillgarth, \\"Popular Religion in Visigothic Spain,\\" in James, p. 28. Ildefonsus' De viris illustribus is a continuation, in thirteen parts, of a work of Isidore bearing the same name. The book contains no biblical quotations,Jocelyn N. Hillgarth, \\"Popular Religion in Visigothic Spain,\\" in James, p. 33 n1. but expands the biographies of famous writers to include illustrious leaders in the Church and government, including Isidore himself (though Ildefonsus appears ignorant of Braulio of Zaragoza's better biography of Isidore).Collins, Visigothic Spain, 165. Ildefonsus' edition emphasised the monastic backgrounds of Toledo's earlier bishops (adding seven biographies). Nonetheless, modern editors note his pastoral concern and emphasis on praedicatio (preaching).Jocelyn N. Hillgarth, \\"Popular Religion in Visigothic Spain,\\" in James, p. 19 n1. Ildefonsus' continuation became an important historical source concerning Toledo during the 6th and 7th centuries. Ildefonsus also prepared an anthology of Isidore's works, excluding the Epistula ad Leudefredum.Roger E. Reynolds, \\"The 'Isidorean' Epistula ad Leudefredum: Its Origins, Early Manuscript Tradition, and Editions,\\" in James, p. 258. In his De cognitione baptismi, Ildefonsus explained the biblical origins of the sacrament, as well as Hispanic baptismal practices and important prayers. The work relied on St. Augustine's narrative concerning the psalms, as well as St. Gregory the Great's moral teachings, and St. Isidore's Etymologies. With respect to the latter, Ildefonsus dared to disagree with Isidore concerning Masses for the dead who had not had their last rites.Jocelyn N. Hillgarth, \\"Popular Religion in Visigothic Spain,\\" in James, p. 53 and n4. Julian of Toledo in his Prognosticum followed Ildefonsus in arguing that such could still be effective. Ildefonsus also wrote De progressu spiritualis deserti elaborating on the same themes, analogizing baptism as a personal equivalent to the Israelites crossing the Red Sea, and the beginning of a personal spiritual journey. Several of Ildefonsus's letters to Quiricus of Barcelona survive. Julian of Toledo in the Elogium Ildefonsi mentions two lost works by Ildefonsus: Liber Prosopopoeia Imbecillitatis Propriae and Opusculum de proprietate personarum Patris, et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. The former treatise (on his own imbecility) was probably a confessional monologue or dialogue, and Valerius of Bierzo may have used it as a model.Collins, \\"The 'Autobiographical' Works of Valerius of Bierzo,\\" 432. The latter deals with monothelitism, a heresy of the time.Collins, \\"Julian of Toledo,\\" 8 and n34. See also * Saint Ildefonsus, patron saint archive Notes Sources *Collins, Roger.

The sponsor receives updates from the child, typically including photos and translated letters, which help create the feeling of a personal relationship with the child. The donated funds are generally not spent specifically on the sponsored child, but pooled with other contributions to fund a variety of education, health, security, infrastructure, or other projects in the child's community or country.https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-22472455 One estimate is that over 9 million sponsors give over US $5 billion to child sponsorship programs.http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2013/june/want-to-change-world- sponsor-child.html Other sources state the amount of child sponsorship funding is closer to US $3 billion per year.https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-22472455  History  Save the Children was the first child sponsorship organization, beginning individual child sponsorship in 1920 to help children following World War I.

Finally, our results also show modest effects of child sponsorship on childbearing in adulthood.\\" Criticisms Critics have argued that child sponsorship could alienate the relatively privileged sponsored children from their peers and may perpetuate harmful stereotypes about third-world citizens being helpless. They also claim that child sponsorship causes cultural confusion and unrealistic aspirations on the part of the recipient, and that child sponsorship is expensive to administer.Simply...Why you should not sponsor a child , New Internationalist, April 1989.

Constructed between 1904 and 1928, it was one of the first municipal \\"cottage estates\\" in the world. It is now a conservation area and is featured in the annual London Open City architecture weekend held third weekend in September. When first built by the London County Council (LCC) it was known as the White Hart Lane Estate. Context The Conservation Area comprises the oldest parts of the estate, built by the London County Council between 1904 and 1913. It is one of the first \\"garden suburbs\\" in the world and is characterised by good quality and practical buildings that show an inventive use of materials and vernacular motifs typical of the Arts and Crafts Movement. Along with Hampstead Garden Suburb, Tower Gardens is one of the most important estates of its type in London. The estate consists of 954 houses arranged in 24 streets, each with its own architectural style. Their appearance was influenced by the Garden City Movement founded by Sir Ebenezer Howard. The properties are mostly two-up, two-down with some three bed houses and also flats in Topham Square. The houses remain cheap by London standards. The curiously named streets belie the area's history. Most appear to be named after someone who once owned the land, from Siward, Earl of Northumberland, in the time of Edward the Confessor, through to Thomas Smith in 1792. A project by Risley Avenue School in conjunction with Bruce Castle Museum identified the streets as named after the 'Lord's of Tottenham'.  Architecture  The terraced houses in N17 are small and were not expensively built but they have many small architectural features which differ with every street. They are predominantly brick, tile and pebble dash cottages in a style that owes something to the Arts and Crafts movement of the time. Construction was under the architect W. E. Riley, a member of the Art Workers Guild. The façades change all over the estate and in places terraces of four houses were designed to look like country mansions. Features of interest include the gables, gable dormers, impressive chimneys, long roofs, low eaves, porches and two story projecting bays. Images can be found in the Conway Library's online collection. Earlier houses are small and have front doors opening into the single reception room. When they were built they would have had outside toilets. Tin baths were a common feature due to the lack of bathrooms. Later houses benefited from new legislation and have front doors opening onto a hall with stairs and often a second reception room. = Influence of the Garden Suburb = Whilst the design of the estate was influenced by the Garden City Movement, the grid layout of the lower half of the estate was not entirely in the tradition of the garden suburbs, nor was the density of housing. However some houses were set back behind small greens and a large green area was provided for recreation including tennis and bowls. The trees lining the streets are protected and provide a boulevard feel, particularly Risley Avenue, privet hedges to the front fascia of the properties within the conservation area are protected.

He also gained notability as a newspaper editor and journalist, as a State Superintendent of Education in Kansas, as an officer in the Union Army, and as an Official in his Christian denomination. Birth and family John Morgan Walden was born in Lebanon, Ohio, the son of Jesse and Matilda (née Morgan) Walden. The family moved to Hamilton County, Ohio in 1832. John was of Virginian ancestry, his great-grandfather Walden having moved from Culpeper County, Virginia to Kentucky in 1770, and his grandfather Benjamin to Ohio in 1802. After the death of his mother in 1833. John went to live with relatives near Cincinnati. John married Martha Young of Cheviot, Ohio July 3, 1859. They had five children. Education and early life Walden attended a local school in Cincinnati until 1844, when he went to work. Becoming a wandering laborer, he found employment as a carpenter. He became interested in the writings of Thomas Paine, whereby Walden became a skeptic. He read Sir Walter Scott and Oliver Goldsmith. His own early romantic stories were published under the pen name \\"Ned Law\\" in the Hamilton, Ohio Telegraph from 1849 until 1853. After attending Farmers' College in College Hill, Ohio in 1849, Walden taught school for a year in Miami County, Ohio. It was there that he was converted by a Methodist Circuit Rider. Returning to Farmers' College, Walden graduated in 1852. He then continued to teach there for two years. Journalism career and Kansas In 1854 John went to Fairfield, Illinois, where he published the Independent Press. In his editorials he opposed the liquor traffic and so- called \\"squatter sovereignty.\\" Illinoisans starved him out by refusing to support his paper, and in 1855 he returned to Ohio, where he became a reporter with the Cincinnati Commercial. John became deeply interested in the Kansas troubles while reporting from the Democratic National Convention of 1856. Indeed, he went to Kansas, where he established the Quindaro Chindowan, a Free-Soil paper in the Free State port-of-entry town of Quindaro. He was a delegate to five Free-State conventions, including the Leavenworth Constitutional Convention of 1858. That same year he campaigned over half the Territory, opposing the Lecompton Constitution. John Morgan Walden served in the Kansas Territorial Legislature in 1857. He also was the State Superintendent of Education for a time. Ordained ministry John returned again to Ohio, where on September 8, 1858 he was admitted on trial to the Cincinnati Annual Conference of the M.E. Church. His first two years of ministry were spent on various circuits. In 1860 he was admitted to the Conference in full connection and sent to the York Street Church in Cincinnati. While he was there the American Civil War began. Rev. Walden became very active in the war effort, raising two regiments to defend the city against threatening attacks. He joined the Union Army, where he achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel. Rev. Walden served with the Ladies' Home Mission in Cincinnati (1862–64). In the post-war years, he helped many African Americans through his work as corresponding secretary of the Western Freedman's Aid Commission and also with the Methodist Freedman's Aid Society. In 1867 Walden was appointed Presiding Elder of the East Cincinnati District. In 1868 he was elected Publishing Agent of the Western Methodist Book Concern, also in Cincinnati. His penchant for statistics and organization, his business ability, and his sympathetic cooperation with the preachers made the Concern a financial success under his stewardship. Episcopal ministry John Morgan Walden was elected a Bishop by the 1884 General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church. During his service he presided at some time or other over every Conference in the U.S.A. He also inspected missions in Mexico, South America, Europe, China and Japan. He did much to shape the missionary policy of his Church. Walden was a delegate to the Ecumenical Conferences in London in 1881, in Washington in 1891 and in Toronto in 1911. With respect to church organization, he insisted on strict adherence to the written law of the church. Otherwise, he was more liberal in his views. Legacy and honors *In recognition of his work for African Americans, in 1900 Central Tennessee College in Nashville was renamed in his honor as Walden University (Tennessee). Death and burial Walden died on January 21, 1914 at Daytona Beach, Florida, and is buried in Spring Grove Cemetery in Cincinnati, Ohio. He was survived by his wife and three of their five children.

Football career A local lad, and recruited from the North Melbourne Colts, Foote played his first match with the North Melbourne Football Club in 1941 at just 16 years of age. He was able to kick equally well with both feet, and his ability to play close to the ground meant that he was not only a brilliant ball player, but was also had an outstanding ability to control the ball in packs. He was an excellent mark. He was famous for his baulking and dodging skills (skills which he claimed to have honed \\"by walking through the crowded city footpaths, dodging and weaving through the oncoming people\\"Ross, 1996, p.212. This \\"legend\\" was confirmed as fact by John Dugdale when interviewed by Paul Sheahan in 2006 (Sheahan, 2006).) and his courageous style of play. He would torment his opponents by running straight towards them, holding the ball out to them — and, then, doing a blind turn around them, and continuing on his way. His favourite ploy was, having taken a mark, to walk back and pretend to be preparing to do a drop kick, the man on the mark would jump into the air as Foote approached and, he would continue running towards the man on the mark, bounce the ball, and run straight past him, giving him the opportunity to deliver the ball much further up the ground. Considered by many to be the most handsome footballer of his era, Foote had a propensity for ostentatiously displaying his extensive range of gracious football talents; and he was renowned for his habit of, regardless of where he had received the ball, running and bouncing the ball (often across the entire width of the Arden Street ground), so that he could run goalwards in full display along the boundary closest to the Ladies' Stand! Sixth round 1947 Les Foote was responsible for one of the greatest comebacks ever seen in the last quarter of an AFL/VFL football match. In the sixth round of the home-and-home season (24 May 1947), playing at the Arden Street Oval against Essendon, North Melbourne was 44 points behind at three-quarter time: North 7.8 (50) v Essendon 14.10 (94). Coming into the match, North Melbourne were on the bottom of the ladder and had lost the two preceding matches. In the fourth round (10 May 1947), North Melbourne had been thrashed by Fitzroy by 101 points, and did not kick a goal until the last quarter, while in the fifth round (17 May 1947), North Melbourne had been beaten by Footscray by 41 points after trailing all day. Foote placed himself into the ruck at three quarter time. He dominated the ruck, and North Melbourne were so dominant during the last quarter that the ball was at Essendon's end of the ground only once, and North scored 8.4 (52) to Essendon's zero to win the match by 8 points: North 15.12 (102) d. Essendon 14.10 (94). To put the magnitude of this astounding win into some sort of perspective, the team that North Melbourne thrashed in the last quarter of that match went on to play in the Grand Final that year, losing by a single point when Carlton's Fred Stafford goaled with 40 seconds left to play. Further, to get some perspective of Foote's astonishing performance as a ruckman on that day, at 182 cm he was dominating the four ruckmen Essendon had selected to play that day; namely, Ivan Goodingham (191 cm ), Perc Bushby (189 cm ), Bob McClure (188 cm ), and Jack Cassin (183 cm ). This record stood unbeaten for 45 years. First Grand Final Foote was the first man to captain North Melbourne into a VFL Grand Final in 1950, having played a career-best game against Geelong in the previous week's Preliminary Final, in which he almost single-handedly converted a seven-goal (42-point) deficit into a 17-point win for North Melbourne. Essendon had already beaten North Melbourne in the Second Semi-Final 11.14 (80) to 11.11 (77) when, in driving rain, and with 30 seconds remaining, and with North Melbourne three points in front, North Melbourne's Jock McCorkell unexpectedly punched a ball that was already rolling out over the boundary line back into play just before it crossed the line, Essendon's John Coleman pounced on the ball, and passed it to Ron McEwin in the goal square. McEwin kicked the goal, and Essendon won by three points. North Melbourne's disappointment with such a narrow and unexpected loss was compounded by the fact that North Melbourne's champion full-forward Jock Spencer had earlier had what had seemed to be a legitimate spectacular aerial mark (i.e., a \\"speckie\\") disallowed in controversial circumstances. Although Essendon had only lost one match during the season, many thought that North Melbourne, having lost such a close match two weeks before, and having played so well against Geelong, really had a good chance of winning the Grand Final against Essendon. However, in an unexpectedly one- sided match, with a rain lashed third quarter, North Melbourne \\"went the knuckle\\", rather than playing football, and they specifically targeted the Essendon star players Dick Reynolds, Ron McEwin, Bill Snell, Bert Harper, Ted Leehane, and John Coleman.See Mapleston (1996), pp. 162–164, and Ross (1996), p.189. Essendon won the 1950 Grand Final 13.14 (92) to 7.12 (54) in front of a crowd of 87,601. Coaching Foote took up a captain-coach position with the Berrigan Football Club in New South Wales. He coached them for two years before returning to the VFL in 1954 as captain-coach St Kilda. In 1954, having returned to the highest, toughest, and fastest level of Australian Rules football, and at the (in those days) advanced age of 30, Foote won St Kilda's best and fairest in front of the 1958 Brownlow Medalist Neil Roberts, the 8 times Victorian representative Keith Drinan, and 4 times Victorian representative and 1958 All-Australian player Jim Ross (the three won seven bests and fairests between them). In 1976 he was non-playing coach of VFA Club Box Hill. Awards He won three best and fairest awards with North Melbourne (1945, 1949, and 1950). He won the St Kilda best and fairest award in 1954.

Between 2003 and 2010, Macdonald held a range of ministerial responsibilities in the Carr, Iemma, Rees, and Keneally ministries. Macdonald, who joined the Labor Party in 1972, had his membership of the party terminated in 2013 for bringing the party into disrepute. After the Independent Commission Against Corruption found that he acted in a corrupt manner, Macdonald was charged with the offence of misconduct in public office for corruptly issuing lucrative mining licences at Doyles Creek in the Hunter Valley, found guilty by a Supreme Court jury in March 2017, and sentenced in June 2017 for a period of ten years, with a minimum custodial period of seven years. Macdonald appealed against the verdict and, on 25 February 2019, his conviction was quashed by the NSW Court of Criminal Appeal who ordered a retrial. He was granted bail and released from custody on the same day. Early career and background Raised as one of five children by his mother in a single parent household, Macdonald graduated from La Trobe University with a Bachelor of Arts (honours) in history and worked for the Australian Council of Overseas Aid, and a range of Commonwealth and State government agencies before his election to parliament in 1988. At the time of entering Parliament, he was a farmer near Carcoar in the Central West of New South Wales. Political career Elected to the Legislative Council in 1998, Macdonald was appointed Minister for Agriculture and Fisheries in 2003 and then the Primary Industries portfolio and a range of other portfolios in the first and second Iemma and Rees ministries including Natural Resources, Mineral Resources, State Development, and Energy. However, granted extraordinary powers by Labor State Conference on 17 November 2009, Rees sacked Macdonald (along with others) from the ministry because of Macdonald's efforts to destabilise Rees in his position. Macdonald then played a large part in the sacking of Rees in favour of Keneally. Macdonald was previously a member of the New South Wales Socialist Left faction, but was formally expelled in December 2009 for his role in Rees's downfall. Keneally restored Macdonald to the ministry following her election as Premier, making him the Minister for Major Events, Mineral and Forest Resources, State and Regional Development and Central Coast. Macdonald was plagued by scandal surrounding a trip to Dubai made in 2008, which led him to resign from the ministry on 4 June 2010 on the same day as the resignation of Minister Graham West. Macdonald's Dubai trip was investigated by the Independent Commission Against Corruption (ICAC) after a government report found he misused public funds. On 7 June 2010 Macdonald resigned from parliament with immediate effect. He was replaced by Luke Foley, the Assistant General Secretary of the New South Wales Labor Party. In July 2012 Macdonald was suspended by the Australian Labor Party for \\"conduct contrary to the principles of the party\\". His membership was subsequently terminated in mid-2013 for bringing the party in disrepute. =ICAC inquiries into alleged corrupt behaviour= In November 2011 the ICAC commenced an inquiry that heard allegations that Macdonald, while Minister, accepted sexual favours in return for introducing businessman to executives of state-owned energy companies. It was also alleged that property developer Ron Medich acted as a broker for Macdonald and was seeking to do business with government agencies where Macdonald had influence as a Minister. Appearing before the Commission to give evidence in relation to the allegations, Macdonald claimed that he was under the influence of alcohol and suffering the effects of depression at the time of the alleged incident. In November 2012, the ICAC began a series of investigative hearings relating to Macdonald and the property and mining interests of Eddie Obeid, a former Labor minister and \\"power broker\\". This inquiry concerned, among other issues, the circumstances surrounding a decision made in 2008 by Macdonald as the Minister for Primary Industries and Minister for Mineral Resources, to open a mining area in the Bylong Valley for coal exploration. These circumstances include whether Macdonald's decision was influenced by Obeid. The witnesses list for the inquiry included former NSW Premiers Morris Iemma and Nathan Rees. On 31 July 2013 the Commission found that Macdonald engaged in corrupt conduct by exercising his ministerial influence to arrange a meeting between Ron Medich and Country Energy managing director Craig Murray on 15 July 2009, and, prior to the meeting, by soliciting the services of a woman as a reward for arranging the meeting. The Commission also found that Macdonald acted contrary to his public duty as a minister of the Crown by arranging for the creation of the Mount Penny tenement to benefit members of the Obeid family, and that he acted contrary to his public duty as a minister of the Crown by providing members of the Obeid family with confidential information that was to their benefit. Further, the Commission found that Macdonald acted corruptly by deciding to reopen the expressions of interest process for mining exploration licences in order to favour Travers Duncan, and by providing him with confidential information. The Commission recommended that the above matters be referred to the Director of Public Prosecutions (DPP) with respect to prosecuting Macdonald. On reviewing the evidence before the Commission of the financial benefits accrued to the Obeid family, the ICAC provided relevant information to the NSW Crime Commission for such action as it deems appropriate, and the ICAC also disseminated relevant information to the Australian Taxation Office for appropriate action. Macdonald vowed to launch a court challenge against the corruption findings made against him by the Independent Commission Against Corruption. One month later, the ICAC made further findings that Macdonald engaged in corrupt conduct by acting contrary to his duty as a minister of the Crown in granting consent to Doyles Creek Mining Pty Ltd to apply for a coal exploration licence at Doyles Creek and by granting the exploration licence to the company, both grants being substantially for the purpose of benefiting John Maitland, a former official of the Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union. The Commission found that, but for that purpose, Macdonald would not have made those grants. In January 2014, the Premier, Barry O'Farrell, announced that the Liberal/National government would introduce legislation into Parliament to cancel the exploration licences for Doyles Creek, Mount Penny and Glendon Brook. The Commission also made findings of corrupt conduct by Obeid and his son, Moses Obeid, John Maitland, and others. Criminal charges and findings In November 2014 the ICAC announced that Macdonald will be prosecuted by the DPP for the offence of misconduct in public office for corruptly issuing of lucrative mining licences at Doyles Creek in the Hunter Valley. Macdonald was also prosecuted \\"for two counts of being an accessory before the fact to misconduct in public office, in relation to aiding, abetting, counselling and procuring the commission of the two offences by Mr Macdonald\\"; and for giving false and misleading evidence to the ICAC. In December 2015, the Supreme Court heard that Macdonald was unable to secure Legal Aid funding to pay for legal representation in his criminal trial. The Judge commented that a Dietrich application was a \\"potential collateral challenge to the trial date.\\" It was estimated that Macdonald's defence legal costs would be between 250,000 and 1.5 million. In March 2017 a criminal trial before a Supreme Court jury found that Macdonald was guilty of misconduct in public office. Sentenced on 2 June, Macdonald is serving a ten-year sentence, of which seven years are without parole. Immediately following his sentencing, Macdonald's lawyers advised that he would appeal against his conviction. The NSW Court of Criminal Appeal handed down its findings on 25 February 2019 and quashed Macdonald and Maitland's convictions, ordering a retrial. Both men were released from custody on the same day and granted bail. In handing down its findings the Court found that: Prior to his sentencing, the NSW Parliament passed legislation to remove parliamentary pensions from former politicians convicted of serious criminal offences. In late May 2017 Macdonald was also committed to stand trial on conspiracy charges with Obeid, relating to Macdonald's granting of a coal exploration licence involving the Mount Penny tenement; due to commence in March 2019.

Important elements of a change request are an ID, the customer (ID), the deadline (if applicable), an indication whether the change is required or optional, the change type (often chosen from a domain-specific ontology) and a change abstract, which is a piece of narrative (Keller, 2005). An example of a change request can be found in Figure 1 on the right. Change requests typically originate from one of five sources: # problem reports that identify bugs that must be fixed, which forms the most common source # system enhancement requests from users # events in the development of other systems # changes in underlying structure and or standards (e.g. in software development this could be a new operating system) # demands from senior management (Dennis, Wixom & Tegarden, 2002).

Universal Robina Corporation (URC) is one of the largest food and beverage companies in the Philippines. It is based in Quezon City, and has production sites in China, Myanmar, Thailand, Vietnam, Malaysia and Indonesia, exclusive distributor presence in Laos and Cambodia, as well as sales offices in Hong Kong and Singapore. History and profile The precursor to Universal Robina Corporation (URC) was founded in 1954 by John Gokongwei, Jr. Gokongwei decided to construct a corn milling plant to produce glucose and cornstarch, Universal Corn Products (UCP). Later, to diversify by producing and marketing his own branded consumer foods, in 1961 Consolidated Food Corporation was established. Their first product was Blend 45, the first locally manufactured coffee blend, dubbed as the “Pinoy coffee”. This became the largest-selling coffee brand in the market, even beating market leaders Café Puro and Nescafé. After coffee, came Nips chocolate candies, a panned chocolate similar to M&M;'s, was a staple of Filipino childhood. In 1963, Robina Farms began operations beginning with poultry products. This was also the beginning of the vertical integration of the Gokongwei businesses, as the farms would be able to purchase feeds from UCP in the future. Later that decade, Robichem Laboratories would be put up, to cater to the veterinary needs of the farms businesses. Robina Farms expanded as it entered the hogs business in the latter part of the 70s. 1966 saw the establishment of Universal Robina Corporation, which pioneered the savory snacks industry in the Philippines with its Jack 'n Jill snacks - Potato Chips, Chiz Curls (puffed corn snack) and Chippy (corn chips). Other snack products would follow, like Jack 'n Jill Pretzels (pretzels), Piattos (fabricated potato chips), and Maxx (hard candy), followed by Magic Flakes, and different flavors Magic Creams cracker sandwich; lastly they added such confectionery item X.O. Butter Caramel Candy, and more. In the early 1970s, the Gokongwei family entered the commodities business through the formation of Continental Milling Corporation, for flour milling and production. The late 1980s brought the acquisition of three sugar mills and refineries, under URC Sugar. These two businesses provided stable cash flows, and allowed for further vertical integration in the supply chain. In line with this strategy, the late 1990s saw the entry of URC into the plastics business, through URC Packaging. In 2005, the present structure of the group was adopted, organized under Universal Robina Corporation, divided into three focused groups: * the Branded Consumer Foods Group, composed of BCFG Domestic (including packaging) and URC International, for the production and sale of snacks, beverage, and grocery products, * the Agro-Industrial Group, composed of Universal Corn Products, Robina Farms, and Robichem, for the production and sale of animal feeds, day- old chicks, hogs, and veterinary medicine, * and the Commodity Foods Group, with the Sugar and Flour divisions, for the production of flour and sugar, and for sugar milling and refining services. URC is a core subsidiary of JG Summit Holdings, Inc. (JGSHI) which is one of the largest business conglomerates listed in the Philippine Stock Exchange. URC owned the Philippine Basketball Association franchise Great Taste Coffee Makers which played from the inaugural 1975 season to 1992 when the company sold the team to Sta. Lucia Realty. The Coffee Makers won 6 PBA championships.

Born in Tondo, Manila, she gained fame in her very first lead role in the 1939 film Giliw Ko. She was discovered by LVN Pictures President Doña Sisang de Leon, who insisted in casting her over the objections of the film's director, who felt she was too young for the part. It was the film's director, Carlos Vander Tolosa, who gave her the screen name Mila del Sol for \\"causing the sun (sol) to appear as if by miracle (milagro) over his otherwise overcast set whenever she was called in to do her scenes.\\" Film production shut down during the Japanese occupation and was restored only in 1945. Del Sol returned to LVN and starred in its production of Manuel Conde's Orasang Ginto, the first post-war Filipino film. She starred in other LVN films of the 1940s, including Ibong Adarna (1949) and Villa Hermosa. Del Sol retired from films to raise a family in the 1950s, but staged a comeback in 1960 with two films released that year, Pakipot and Tatlong Magdalena. The following year, she starred in an international production, Espionage Far East, and later starred in a long- running television series. She began her career as an entrepreneur in 1964, and focused on philanthropic work from the 1970s onward. Pope Francis imparted the Apostolic Blessing upon del Sol on the occasion of her 90th birthday. In December 2014, the Congress of the Philippines passed Resolution No. 165, honoring Mila del Sol “for her contributions to the movie industry and to Philippine society in general”. The Resolution said in part that “Ms. Mila del Sol proved that poverty should not be a hindrance but an inspiration to improve one's status in life” and that “her businesses and various foundations that employ and extend benefits to those who are in need and have less in life are proofs of Ms. Mila del Sol's unwavering commitment to contribute to the improvement of Philippine society.\\" Early life Del Sol was born in Tondo, Manila at the Mary Johnston Hospital Her father, Amado C. Rivera, worked at the internal revenue service during the day, and was a waiter at night. He served as a guerilla in the Philippines during World War II. Her mother, Lorenza Villarba, stayed at home to raise eight children. Del Sol attended Malate Primary School, San Andres Elementary, and Intramuros Intermediate School. She could not go to high school, since she had to start working, at the age of 12. She later attended Hollywood High School in the 1950s, after the birth of her third child. She took some courses at Los Angeles City College and Ateneo de Manila University. Career in Film & Television =1938-1942= Del Sol appeared in three films in 1938 (including Ang Maya opposite Fernando Poe, Sr.), but got her big break as a principal character in the 1939 classic Giliw Ko, for which she was honored by then Philippine President Manuel L. Quezon. This was the first movie of the storied film production company. She made twelve other films for LVN during this period, including Hali (1940), an early example of the Sarong genre, and Sawing Gantimpala (1940), which was based on a song written for del Sol by Aurora Quezon. =1946-1952= LVN stopped film production during World War II, when the Philippines was occupied by Japan. Del Sol volunteered for the Red Cross, and frequented Prisoner of War camps along with other \\"Blue Ladies\\" of the Philippine film industry. LVN's first post-war film, Orasang Ginto again starred del Sol. She made more than twenty other films during this period including Garrison 13 (1946), which recounted atrocities committed by the Imperial Japanese Army in the Philippines during the war. =1960 onwards= Del Sol migrated to the United States, and lived there and in Europe for much of the 1950s. She returned to the Philippines in the 1960s, when she made two more films, and starred in the hit television series Problema Mo Na Yan. She continued her work as an actress well into her 80s, most recently as a lead in the television series Rosalka. =Actors and directors= Del Sol acted opposite all the male leads of her period, including Teddy Benavídez, Fred Cortes, Armando Goyena, Fernando Poe, Sr., José Padilla, Jr., Ely Ramos, Jaime de la Rosa, Rogelio de la Rosa, and Leopoldo Salcedo. She was directed by Lamberto V. Avellana, Emmanuel Borlaza, Manuel Conde, Ramon A. Estella, Gregorio Fernandes, Gerardo de León, José Nepomuceno, Vicente Salumbides, Manuel Silos, and Carlos Vander Tolosa. =Awards= * The Cinema's Living Treasure Citation, 1994, The Metropolitan Manila Authority and The Metro Manila Film Festival * Nagtatanging Gawad Urian, 2013, Manunuri ng Pelikulang Pilipino * House Resolution No. 165 Honoring Clarita Villarba Rivera, Also Known As Mila Del Sol, For Her Contributions To The Movie Industry That Enriched The Philippine Culture, And To Philippine Society In General, 2014, Philippine Congress Business and philanthropy In 1964, del Sol founded Superior Maintenance Services, which has employed over 100,000 people, and continues to be managed by her grandchildren.

The ancient parish of Deptford straddled the counties of Surrey and Kentwww.visionofbritain.org.uk and so there was some doubt over the county in which the manor of Hatcham was situated. In 1636, the matter was settled by placing it entirely within Surrey.www.archaeologydataservice.ac.ukJohn Bartholomew, Gazetteer of the British Isles (1887)'Parishes: Hatcham (Parish of Deptford St Paul)', A History of the County of Surrey: Volume 4 (1912) Hatcham became part of Deptford St Paul when the parish was divided in 1730. It has lent its name to the subsequently created ecclesiastical parishes of All Saints' Hatcham Park, St Catherine's and St James' Hatcham, which include parts of the historic county of Kent. In the Domesday Book it is recorded as Hacheham. The name means \\"home of a man named Hæcci\\" and derives from an Old English personal name.Mills, A., Dictionary of London Place Names, (2001), Oxford It is described as a manor containing land for three ploughs, nine villagers and two smallholders, of meadowland and woodland for 3 pigs. Hatcham formed part of the Brixton Hundred of Surrey in medieval times. The manor was bought by the Haberdashers' Company in 1614, which later demolished the former manor house (during the 1840s) for redevelopment and the foundation of its schools.Lewisham London Borough Council - Hatcham Hatcham has been included within the Metropolitan Police District since 1830. In 1855 it was included in the area of responsibility of the Metropolitan Board of Works, in the Greenwich District. It became part of the County of London in 1889 and the Metropolitan Borough of Deptford in 1900. Although the place name has largely fallen out of common parlance, its use is retained by several organisations including the Hatcham Liberal Club on Queen's Road and in the names of Haberdashers' Aske's Hatcham Boys' and Girls' Grammar Schools, founded in 1876.

ASI Series. Vol. 9. On February 5 and 17, 1999, he held the position of interim prime minister of the Republic of Moldova. President Petru Lucinschi delegated him as a candidate for the position of prime minister, but he did not get the support of the parliament, he withdrew his candidacy. On December 21, 1999, by the Decree no. 1263 (art. 3) of the President of the Republic of Moldova, Petru Lucinschi, was declared that Serafim Urechean, in his capacity as general mayor of Chișinău municipality, would become a member of the ex officio Government. He held the position of member of the government by the time of adoption of the Law no. 806-XV of February 5, 2002 for amending and completing the Statute of Chișinău municipality, when he was suspended of being a member of the Government of the Republic of Moldova. Serafim Urechean was very proactive in the political life. In 2001 he became the President of the Social-Political Movement Independents' Alliance of Moldova, in 2003 he became the co-president of the Party Our Moldova Alliance (in 2005 – 2011 he became the president), and in 2004 – 2005 he was the leader of the Electoral Bloc Democratic Moldova. At the parliamentary elections of March 6, 2005, Electoral Bloc Democratic Moldova, led by the Chișinău mayor Serafim Urechean, accumulated 28.53% of the votes of the participants and got 34 mandates out of 101. In accordance with article 70 of the Constitution of Moldova, \\"the MP position is not compliant with the any other remunerated function, except the didactic and scientific activity\\". On April 18, 2005, in the last day of the one-month term given for the validation of the mandate, provided to decide whether to accept or reject the position for which was elected, Serafim Urechean decided to resign as mayor of Chișinău in favour of the deputy in the Parliament of the Republic Moldova. On April 21, 2011, he was appointed for the position of the chairman of the Court of Accounts of the Republic of Moldova. At the local elections in Chișinău held in 2015, Serafim Urechean was a candidate for the position of mayor from the part of the Liberal Democratic Party of Moldova. However, when he appeared on the talk shows during the election campaign, Urechean has stated: \\"I am not a member of any party, nor of the LDPM. By definition I cannot be, because I am going to chair an apolitical structure. If I become a mayor, I will remain apolitical. I am not going to join any party; I will be mayor of all the citizens of the Chișinău.\\" During two months of election campaign he resigned from the position of the chairman of the Court of Accounts. Following the elections on June 14, 2015, Serafim Urechean has got only 2.97% of the vote.

It lies on the A39 almost exactly equidistant from Bridgwater to the east and Minehead to the west. The village includes a 17th-century coaching inn, and a post office and stores. This part of the village, formerly known as Putsham, also contains the village hall, which was extended to celebrate the coronation of Queen Elizabeth II. History The village was listed in the Domesday Book of 1086 as Clive, probably meaning cliff. The parish of Kilve was part of the Williton and Freemanners Hundred. =Oil extraction= Oil retort At the far end of the car park are the remains of a red brick retort, built in 1924, when it was discovered that the shale found in the cliffs was rich in oil. The beach is part of the Blue Anchor to Lilstock Coast SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest). Along this coast the cliffs are layered with compressed strata of oil-bearing shale and blue, yellow and brown lias embedded with fossils. In 1924 Dr Forbes-Leslie founded the Shaline Company to exploit them. This retort house is thought to be the first structure erected here for the conversion of shale to oil but the company was unable to raise sufficient capital and this is now all that remains of the anticipated Somerset oil boom. Governance The parish council has responsibility for local issues, including setting an annual precept (local rate) to cover the council’s operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny. The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police, district council officers, and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime, security, and traffic. The parish council's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities, as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance, repair, and improvement of highways, drainage, footpaths, public transport, and street cleaning. Conservation matters (including trees and listed buildings) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council. The village falls within the non- metropolitan district of Somerset West and Taunton, which was established on 1 April 2019. It was previously in the district of West Somerset, which was formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, and part of Williton Rural District before that. The district council is responsible for local planning and building control, local roads, council housing, environmental health, markets and fairs, refuse collection and recycling, cemeteries and crematoria, leisure services, parks, and tourism. Somerset County Council is responsible for running the largest and most expensive local services such as education, social services, libraries, main roads, public transport, policing and fire services, trading standards, waste disposal and strategic planning. It is also part of the Bridgwater and West Somerset county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP) by the first past the post system of election. Geography An aerial view of Kilve. The village actually consists of three settlements. One of these is up Pardlestone Lane, which meanders steeply southwards through mossy cottages, and a few more modern bungalows nestle into the hillside. Berta Lawrence, in her book Quantock Country, suggests that the name Pardlestone derives from the old alternative 'Parleston', where a tiny settlement here belonged to a Saxon called Parlo. \\"But,\\" she writes, \\"there are local inhabitants who tell of a mythical Frenchman called Pardel and an equally mythical Pardel's Stone stuck somewhere up this lane.\\" A further settlement lies along the ridge to the east of the village, with a steep and narrow lane running down to join Sea Lane at Meadow House, which was once the Rectory. From halfway down this lane there is a panoramic view of the coastline as far as North Hill in Minehead and across the channel to South Wales and the Brecon Beacons. In the foreground lie the Church of St Mary, the ruins of a medieval chantry and one old barn still standing, though dilapidated, with traditional round stone pillars. Alongside the chantry are two houses and a tea-garden. Lane End was built in traditional cob construction by the distinguished Arts and Crafts architect Norman Jewson as a summer house for himself. The wavecut beach A path leads down from the chantry through fields now used as a car-park to the beach which William Wordsworth, the Romantic poet, who lived for a brief period with his sister Dorothy at Alfoxton House, described as \\"Kilve's delightful shore\\". The beach is on the West Somerset Coast Path. Kilve Pill, where the stream from Holford runs into the sea, was once a tiny port, used for importing culm, an inferior type of coal which was used in the lime burning process. It was also the site for \\"glatting\\" which was the hunting of conger eels by dogs. On the shore a Saint Keyne serpent can be seen, which a local legend says is a snake turned to stone, but is in reality an ammonite. It is just possible to make out the remains of a stone jetty and the ruins of a lime kiln nearby. Here the limestone was burnt to provide farmers with the lime to spread on their fields. The limestone carrier Laurina was wrecked at Kilve in 1876. The Pill was long associated with smuggling and legend has it that barrels of spirits hidden in the chantry were deliberately set fire to as the revenue men appeared on the scene. Legend also has it that the smugglers' ponies were taught to respond to the commands \\"whoa\\" and \\"gee up\\" in the reverse sense of the words. Along the whole length of the stream from Holford to the shore at Kilve there were a number of working mills. Farmers appear to have used water- power in the same way as modern ones use the power from engines. The old mill in the village, now a private house, still retains its overshot wheel, but the others have long since vanished. Landmarks =Kilve Court= Kilve Court South of the village is Kilve Court Residential and Outdoor Learning Centre, which runs a wide range of courses for young people including Adventurous Activity Courses set in the centre's extensive grounds and Academic Enrichment Courses, designed to help gifted and talented children to develop their skills in subjects such as Art, Drama, English and Maths. Kilve Court is one of the few centres in the country to run instructive Creative Writing for ages up to and including 16, with published authors, such as Beth Webb, directing courses. The main part of the building was constructed between 1702 and 1705, in the reign of Queen Anne, by Henry Sweating, and incorporating an earlier dwelling, although alterations were made in the 1920s by Clough Williams- Ellis. Somerset County Council acquired the house in 1964 and it was opened in 1965 with residential places for 26 children and four members of staff. Since that date there have been a number of extensions and the house, together with a hutted camp site on the hill above, can now accommodate a total of 166. Kilve Court is a major employer in the village. Religious sites Church of St Mary The Church of St Mary dates back to the 14th century. In the vestry is one remaining carved arch of the ancient screen. The tower has recently had a considerable amount of restorative work done on it, and is now rendered and painted a shade of off-white, as the whole church was until the early years of the 20th century. Since 1969 it has been designated a Grade II* listed building. Ruin of the Chantry Kilve Chantry was founded in 1329, when a brotherhood of five monks was employed to say Mass for their founder, Simon de Furneaux. The Roll of Incumbents shows that several successive chantry priests were incumbents of Kilve parish. The chantry seems to have fallen into a ruin long before the dissolution of the monasteries, and for centuries it served as a barn for the adjacent farm. The building stayed in use for many years, possibly by smugglers, until a fire in 1848. It is now listed on English Heritage's Heritage at Risk register as \\"very bad\\" with a priority rating of \\"A\\", the highest possible.http://www.english- heritage.org.uk/server/show/conBar.7966 Blue Ben Kilve is said to have once been home to a dragon called Blue Ben. The skull of a fossilised Ichthyosaur on display in the local museum is sometimes pointed out as belonging to Blue Ben.

It was opened in 1840, following the donation of the land by local philanthropist Joseph Strutt, and to designs by John Claudius Loudon. It was the first publicly owned, landscaped, urban, recreational park in England. After many years of neglect, the Arboretum was extensively refurbished in the early 21st century with the aid of a Heritage Lottery Fund grant of almost £5 million. It is listed as Grade II* on the English Heritage Register of Parks and Gardens of Special Historic Interest in England.Arboretum , Derby.gov.uk, accessed 30 November 2008 History Derby Arboretum opened in 1840 and is often described as \\"Britain's first public park\\". Although green spaces and common lands had existed previously, as had private parkland and gardens, the park in Derby was the first to be deliberately planned as a place of public recreation in an urban setting. The Arboretum was donated to the town in 1840 by Joseph Strutt, a former mayor of Derby and member of a prominent local family of industrialists. A noted philanthropist, Strutt was grateful to the working people of Derby for the part they had played in helping him and his family amass their fortune, and wanted to convey his thanks by providing a much needed recreational facility for a rapidly expanding and urbanising area. Strutt commissioned John Claudius Loudon to design the park, and Loudon adapted Strutt's original plans for a botanical garden and pleasure grounds to his own vision, incorporating landscaped walkways. Work on the Arboretum commenced in July 1839, and was completed in time for the grand opening which took place on 16 September 1840. The occasion was marked by a parade from the Market Place in the centre of Derby to the new park. The park initially charged for admission, in order to pay for its upkeep. However, admission was free on Sundays and on Wednesdays (which had been adopted as half day closing in Derby). This meant that the working classes, who had limited leisure time and probably lacked the means to pay admission, could gain free access to the Arboretum when they actually had the time to do so; in effect, the park was paid for by those who had time and money to spare to enjoy the facilities. Free admission times continued to be extended until charging was finally abolished in 1882. In 1859 the Arboretum was one of a number of parks visited by Frederick Law Olmsted while on a research tour of Europe, and it is thought that he may have incorporated features of Loudon's work into his design for Central Park in New York. A scene from Ken Russell's 1969 Oscar-winning film Women in Love was shot at the Arboretum. The scene had a brass band playing on the Aslin-designed bandstand whilst Oliver Reed, Alan Bates and Glenda Jackson acted in front of it. The Easter Pavilion had received a coat of paint for the occasion; this was the last work on the building until 2005 when it was fully restored.  Notable landmarks  Andrew Handyside Over the years the Arboretum has incorporated a variety of buildings, statues and ornaments. Perhaps the best known locally is the Florentine Boar statue, which was originally placed on the site in 1806, when the land was Joseph Strutt's private garden. Strutt had commissioned William John Coffee, a Crown Derby sculptor, to make an earthenware copy of the bronze statue which he had seen when he once visited the Mercato Nuovo (New Market) in central Florence. The earthenware boar remained in place after the creation of the Arboretum until it was damaged (actually decapitated) during a German air raid on Derby on 15 January 1941.Derby Arboretum , bygonederbyshire.co.ukFlorentine Boar, derbyarboretum.co.ukDestruction of the Victorian Bandstand and Florentine Boar, derbyarboretum.co.uk However, a claim was reported in January 2002 that a Derby resident had, as a child, accidentally broken off the boar's head while climbing on the statue. The current statue is a bronze replacement dedicated in 2005.The Arboretum Today , derbyarboretum.co.uk Other past and present features of the Arboretum include: * The original \\"Grand Entrance\\" from Grove Street and adjacent lodge. * An elaborate entrance from Arboretum Square, incorporating a statue of Joseph Strutt, completed in 1852. * An entrance lodge on the Rose Hill Street side. * A Victorian bandstand, destroyed along with the Boar in 1941. * An iron and glass building (later nicknamed the Crystal Palace after the building in London) designed by Henry Duesbury was erected at the Rose Hill Street end of the 1845 extension. This was demolished in the 1890s. * The fountain, originally built in 1846 and recently restored. * Two bowling greens, home of the Arboretum and Joseph Strutt Bowls Clubs. * Arboretum Field, an extension to the original area of the park added in 1845. At one time major football matches were played here, notably Derby Junction's victory over Blackburn Rovers in the quarter-finals of the FA Cup in 1888. There are still football pitches here today.  The Arboretum today  The new bronze copy of the Florentine Boar, by Alex Paxton. This statue replaces the one destroyed in 1941 In recent decades, vandalism and lack of investment had left the Arboretum in a state of seemingly terminal decline, however this process has been reversed in the light of the recent injection of Lottery money and a determination locally to return this important historic landmark to its former status. Ornaments and buildings have been restored and new ones added. After a long running local campaign, a new bronze replica of the Florentine Boar statue, produced at cost by a local engineer, Alex Paxton, was finally put in place in November 2005. Other new features include the Heart of the Park building, incorporating community rooms, a café, public toilets and changing rooms for the adjacent sports facilities (basketball courts, cricket net and two astroturf five-a-side football pitches). The Rose Hill Recreation Ground is an extensive modern playground catering for all age groups of children that has been created within the park.

Etymology The species epithet angustifolium is a combination of the Latin words meaning 'narrow', and meaning 'leaf'. It shares this epithet with other species of plants including Epilobium angustifolium. Description Pinus banksiana Vaccinium angustifolium is a low spreading deciduous shrub growing tall. Its rhizomes can lay dormant up to 100 years, and when given the adequate amount of sun light, soil moisture and oxygen content they will sprout. The leaves are glossy blue-green in summer, turning a variety of reds in the fall. The leaf shape is broad to elliptical. Buds are brownish red in stem axils. The flowers are white, bell-shaped, long. The fruit is a small sweet dark blue to black berry, full of antioxidants and flavonoids. This plant grows best in wooded areas, old abandoned farmyards or open areas with well-drained acidic soils. In some areas it produces natural blueberry barrens, where it is practically the only species covering large areas. There may be several buds on a healthy stem and each bud can open up and have several blossoms. A blueberry field that has full plant coverage can have as many as 150 million blossoms per acre. The Vaccinium angustifolium plant is fire-tolerant and its numbers often increase in an area following a forest fire. Traditionally, blueberry growers burn their fields every few years to get rid of shrubs and fertilize the soil. In Acadian French, a blueberry field is known as a (from 'burnt') because of that technique, which is still in use. Distribution and habitat The lowbush blueberry is native to Canada, Maine, and Massachusetts and also grown commercially there, mainly harvested from managed wild patches. It is also a favorite of recreational berry pickers, black bears, coyotes, racoons, foxes, porcupines, white-tailed deer and birds. To help keep the unwanted individuals out of the blueberry fields and from damaging or eating the crop growers will fence their fields and connect power or use an automated surround sound speaker system called a bird squawker. This bird squawker is set up on a timer system to send out predator bird sounds during the day and at night the system can be programmed to discourage night time crop feeders. While eating blueberries black bears roll around and damage the surrounding crop. They forage on the berries from daylight to dark. Its leaves are also popular among caterpillars. It is a larval host to the pale tiger moth, the peppered moth,https://bugguide.net/node/view/19107 the chain-dotted geometer, the saw-wing moth, the blueberry gray moth, the mousy angle moth,https://bugguide.net/node/view/554947 Caloptilia vacciniella, Andromeda underwing, the shadowy arches, the two-spot dart,https://bugguide.net/node/view/22844 the dingy cutworm moth, the speckled cutworm,https://bugguide.net/node/view/43460 the decorated owlet, the pirate looper, Norman's dart, the gray swordgrass moth, the pink-edged sulphur butterfly, the pawpaw sphinx moth, and the blueberry leaftier moth.  Pollination  During the harvest year blueberry growers rent honey bee hives to put in their fields for pollination. These hives are placed in the fields at a density range of anywhere from 1-8 hives per acre. The hives are placed in the fields at 10-20% bloom allowing the bees to have enough forage in the field rather than going elsewhere to forage. Hives are left in blueberry fields for 2 weeks on average, allowing the bees to pollinate the variety of clones in the field, all of which bloom at different times during the two-week period. Some growers also use bumble bees as well in hopes of maximum pollination. Bumble bees will fly in colder and wetter weather conditions than the honey bee will, and they also pollinate in a different way then the honey bee. Bumble bees are able to sonicate the flowers, which releases pollen from deep inside the poricidal anthers. This is known as buzz-pollination. Blueberry growers also rely on many wild bees for pollination, including solitary bees like Andrena carlini and Colletes inaequalis.  Production  A tractor harvesting blueberries at a farm in New Brunswick, Canada In 2006, production of wild blueberries in Quebec has reached 70 million pounds (31.8 million kg). From this, 55 million pounds (2.2 million kg) were produced from the specially equipped blueberry farm (), and 15 million pounds (6.8 kg) were collected in the forest. The vast majority of blueberries, or 67.5 million pounds (30.7 million kg), has been marketed under various processed forms, and particularly in the form of frozen wild blueberries. In 2016, the production of wild blueberries was the highest ever in Quebec reaching 115 million pounds. The production reached 60 million pounds in Nova Scotia in 2016. The plant's rough acreage in Nova Scotia is 46 thousand. The wild blueberry is the number 1 fruit crop in acreage export sales, and value. Nova Scotia's provincial production has hit over 60 million pounds. Harvesting of wild blueberries begins in August and continues until late September. Pruning Native Americans regularly burned away trees and shrubs in parts of eastern Maine in order to stimulate blueberry production. Modern farmers use various methods of burning or mowing to accomplish this. There are a number of methods growers use to stimulate blueberry production on their land, such as burning the land or using a flail mower, bush hog, lawn mower, etc. to cut the plants off as close to the ground as possible without scalping the land. These procedures are used to promote the spreading of rhizomes under the soil. Some growers use a sickle bar mower in the fall after the crop has been harvested to mow the plants off, leaving roughly 1 to 2 inches of stem so the growers can then burn the remainder of the plants in the spring, using less fuel for the fire.  Products  Blueberry frozen yogurt Roughly 90% of wild low bush blueberries are sold IQF (Individual Quick Frozen). Some berries are fresh packed during harvest season and sold at farm markets and grocery stores. There is 100% pure wild blueberry juice on the market. The fruit can be used to make a wide variety of food products such as blueberry smoothies, a blueberry sauce for waffles, blueberry grunt, blueberry lemon loaf, blueberry crisp, blueberry muffins, blueberry jam, blueberry martinis, and can be used for a topping on cereal or yogurt. Nova Scotia wild blueberries are exported to the United States, Japan, Germany, United Kingdom and other countries.  Nutrition  Wild blueberries are a good source of Vitamin C and dietary fiber. They contain no fat, sodium or cholesterol and are only 80 calories per cup of berries. Recent studies have shown that the pigments in the skin of the berries can provide health benefits to the consumer. These pigments are called anthocyanins which contain antioxidants. The antioxidants in the berry help to fight compounds called free radicals which can cause cancer, heart disease, other diseases and premature aging. In a study by the USDA wild blueberries were found to have the highest level of antioxidants out of 40 fruits and vegetables. Tannins, which are found in wild blueberries and cranberries, can prevent the bacteria that cause urinary tract infections from attaching to the wall of the bladder and urinary tract, thus allowing them to pass through the body without causing any harm. thumb  State fruits  Giant blueberry person in Oxford, Nova Scotia The lowbush blueberry is the state fruit of Maine and the wild low bush blueberry is also the Nova Scotian Provincial Berry.

A writ of detainer was a form for the beginning of a personal action against a person already lodged within the walls of a prison; it was superseded by the Judgments Act 1838. In the United States, a detainer in the context of criminal law is a request filed by a criminal justice agency with the institution in which a prisoner is incarcerated, asking the institution either to hold the prisoner for the agency or to notify the agency when release of the prisoner is imminent.Carchman v. Nash 473 U.S. 716, 719 (1985) The Supreme Court of the United States has held that the Interstate Agreement on Detainers Act (1970)18 USC Appx allows for a trial of any untried indictment, information, or complaint within 180 days.Carchman 473 U.S. at 720. However, the prisoner needs to enter a request for final disposition to begin the clock.18 USC Appx Article III U.S. Marshals are given the power to issue writs of detainers in 28 U.S.C. 566(c), which is how the federal government interacts with the states to retrieve those being held in state prisons. In Carchman v. Nash, the Supreme Court held that a probation revocation (or parole revocation) is not an \\"untried indictment, information or complaint\\" and therefore is not controlled by the Interstate Agreement on Detainer Act's 180-day provision.Carchman 473 U.S. at 726. It also made it clear that a case that where a sentence has already been imposed against the prisoner is not under the 180-day restriction.Id. at 727. Unfortunately, this often creates loopholes, where a proceeding still needs to go on in the case with the detainer, but the defendant has already pleaded guilty, and is not eligible to receive a final disposition in the case until his original period of incarceration is over. This creates a situation that is the opposite of what the Interstate Agreement was intended to do: Most states have also enacted laws that create Interstate Commissions, which is usually an agency that creates its own policies and regulations regarding detainers transferring prisoners and probationers across state lines. While the Interstate Agreement on Detainers controls untried cases, Interstate Commission can control whether a person on probation or parole can come to their state to reside.Wis. Stat. 304.16; Wis. Adm. Code DOC 328.09 Under the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 (IIRIRA), federal U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents can issue a detainer requesting a state or local jurisdiction to hold a suspected non-citizen for an additional 48 hours beyond their scheduled release. Although the detainer lapses after 48 hours, and there is no longer legal authority to detain the prisoner, this is frequently disregarded, and attorneys across the United States report that non-citizens are frequently held much longer.http://immigrationpolicy.org/just- facts/immigration-detainers-comprehensive-look In the 2014 case Miranda- Olivares v. Clackamas County, United States magistrate judge Janice M. Stewart of the United States District Court for the District of Oregon ruled that immigration detainers violate detainees' Fourth Amendment rights and are merely requests that are not legally binding. In July 2017, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court unanimously held that the commonwealth's law enforcement could not hold a prisoner solely on the authority of an ICE detainer..

Early life and family Chithambara College Krishnakumar was born on 2 January 1960. He was the son of Sathasivam and Rajaluxmy (Seethalakshmi) from Valvettithurai in northern Ceylon. Sathasivam owned the Kumar Achchakam printing press in Nelliady. Rajaluxmy was a supporter of the Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi and took part in the 1961 satyagraha. Krishnakumar had one brother and two sisters. He was educated at Chithambara College, Valvettithurai and Velautham Maha Vidyalayam. V. Prabhakaran and Mahattaya were also educated at Chithambara College. Prabhakaran was also a close relative and friend of Krishnakumar. LTTE Krishnakumar was involved in helping Tamil refugees who fled to the Jaffna peninsula following the 1977 anti-Tamil riots. Deeply affected by the suffering of the refugees, Krishnakumar joined the militant Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) in 1978. He was given the nom de guerre Kittu. He then travelled, along with LTTE leader Prabhakaran, to Madras, India. LTTE member Seelan (Charles Lucas Anthony), a close associate of Prabhakaran, was killed in a confrontation with the Sri Lanka Army in Meesalai on 15 July 1983. On 20 July 1983 the Sri Lankan government banned all reporting about the LTTE. In response, the LTTE planned to ambush an army military convoy. On 23 July 1983, at around 11.30 pm, the LTTE ambushed the Four Four Bravo military patrol in Thirunelveli near Jaffna. Thirteen soldiers were killed on the spot, two died later and a number of LTTE cadres were also killed. LTTE members involved in the ambush included Prabhakaran, Kittu, Appaiah, Chellakili, Iyer, Pulendran, Santos and Victor. The ambush precipitated the Black July anti-Tamil riots in which between 400 and 3,000 Tamils were killed by Sinhalese mobs. Kittu then became the LTTE's Jaffna regional commander. Unusually, Kittu would personally lead LTT's operations against the Sri Lankan military. Kittu is credited with instilling discipline amongst the LTTE cadres. He would punish harshly LTTE cadres who violated their code of ethics and civilians who committed minor offences. He established kangaroo courts in Jaffna peninsula to create a state of fear amongst the population. In April 1986 the LTTE banned rival militant organisation Tamil Eelam Liberation Organization (TELO) and set about killing its leader Sri Sabaratnam. Sabaratnam went on the run, fleeing from TELO's main base in Kalviyankadu to Neervely, then to Kopay and finally to Kondavil. The LTTE found out that he was in Kondavil and they, led by Kittu, cordoned off the area and started a house-to-house search, using loud hailers to warn local residents not to shelter Sabaratnam. On 6 May 1986 the LTTE discovered Sabaratnam in a tobacco field and Kittu shot him in the leg to prevent him escaping. Sabaratnam pleaded with Kittu for his life but Kittu shot him using a machine gun. Sabaratnam's bullet ridden body was displayed at Kondavil bus stand before being handed over to his family. Kittu's ruthless side was tempered by respect for enemies whom he considered to be brave. During the 1986 siege of Jaffna fort, Kittu met with Captain Jayanath Kotelawala, whom he considered to be brave, several times and arranged for firewood and mangoes to be provided for soldiers trapped inside the fort. Kittu met Vijaya Kumaranatunga, Sinhalese actor and leftist politician, in Jaffna in October 1986. Kittu led the LTTE's delegation in the short lived peace talks with the Sri Lankan government in Kankesanthurai in December 1986. On 13 March 1987 Kittu was travelling in a jeep to meet his girlfriend Cynthia, a medical student at the University of Jaffna, when, on Second Cross Street, Jaffna a gunman fired at the jeep and threw a grenade inside it. Two of Kittu's bodyguards were killed and a third injured seriously. Kittu's right leg was seriously damaged and had to be amputated. As a result his military career came to an end. The LTTE blamed rival militant groups Eelam People's Revolutionary Liberation Front and TELO for the attempted assassination and quickly \\"rounded up\\" members of these groups. Kittu then re-located to Madras where took charge of the LTTE's propaganda office. During the LTTE-India conflict in Sri Lanka Kittu met with Research and Analysis Wing agents for talks aimed at bringing peace and implementing the Indo-Lanka Accord. Kittu sent LTTE cadre Johny back to Sri Lanka to get instructions from Prabhakaran who was operating from the Vanni jungles. However, Johny was ambushed by the Indian Peace Keeping Force and killed. The LTTE-India talks collapsed and in August 1988 twelve LTTE offices in Tamil Nadu were closed and 154 LTTE activists, including Kittu, were arrested. The LTTE activists threatened to launch a hunger strike as they were being detained without charge. Kittu was released in October 1988 and deported back to Indian held Jaffna. He then travelled to the Vanni, leaving his girlfriend Cynthia in Jaffna. In 1989, when peace negotiations were being carried out between the LTTE and Sri Lankan government, Prabhakaran decided to send Kittu to London for treatment to his amputated leg. Kittu was flown from the Vanni to Colombo in a Sri Lankan military helicopter. He was taken to the British High Commission where he received a visa to travel to the UK. However, before leaving Sri Lanka, Kittu married Cynthia, who had travelled from Jaffna to Colombo, on 25 October 1989 at the hotel where the LTTE peace talk delegation were staying. Kittu then travelled to the UK, joined later by Cynthia. Whilst in the UK Kittu took charge of the LTTE's international secretariat in London. It's alleged that Kittu threatened and extorted money from the growing number of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees in the UK. This led to numerous complaints being lodged with UK officials and eventually immigration officials started the process for deporting Kittu. Pre-empting this, Kittu travelled to Paris and then onto Switzerland where he applied for asylum. Next, he travelled to Sweden and then to Vienna where he received orders from Prabhakaran to return to the Vanni. Kittu then flew to Singapore. His movements thereafter remain unclear but it is believed he travelled to Thailand where he boarded the MV Yahata. Earlier, whilst in Karachi, the Yahata had been loaded with a huge cargo of weapons by the Pakistan Navy on the orders of the Inter-Services Intelligence. The Yahata left Phuket with the cargo of weapons and several LTTE cadres, including Kittu, on board. Whilst at sea the ship changed its name to MV Ahat. There are differing accounts of the events which then occurred. According to one account the Indian Navy and Indian Coast Guard intercepted the 400 tonne Ahat on 13 January 1993 south-east of Madras, sailing without navigation lights en route to Madras. According to second account an Indian Coast Guard Dornier aircraft, whilst on a routine surveillance flight between Point Calimere and Point Pedro, spotted the 280 tonne Ahat on 6 January 1993. The Indian Navy kept the ship under surveillance, noting that it was sailing suspiciously towards the Indian coast, frequently changing course. On 12 January 1993 the Indian had confirmation that the Ahat belonged to the LTTE and carried several LTTE cadres. The Indian navy launched Operation Zabardast and on 14 January 1993 two coast guard ships, the CGS Vivek and INS Kirpan, intercepted the Ahat and escorted it towards the Indian coast. According to a third account, the Ahat was intercepted by the Indian navy on 13 January 1993. Three days later, 700 km south-east of Madras, the LTTE allowed the crew to leave the Ahat after which they blew up the ship. According to a fourth account, which was supported by the LTTE, the Ahat was intercepted by the Indian navy on 13 January 1993 in international waters about 290 miles east of Hambantota. According to the official Indian military version, the Ahat was spotted on 6 January 1993 in Indian exclusive economic zone waters, acting suspiciously and changing course frequently. The Indian coast guard and navy shadowed the Ahat and on making radio contact, found out that the ship was carrying arms, ammunition and explosives for the LTTE. After being surrounded by the Indian navy, the crew set the ship, which was about 12 nautical miles off Madras, on fire. Nine crew members jumped overboard and were rescued by the navy. The remaining crew and LTTE cadres were given an opportunity to surrender but according to the Indians, Kittu threatened to blow the ship up if the Indian tried to board it. Attempts to stop the fire and prevent it from sinking were delayed by the presence on board of explosives and hostile crew. On 16 January 1993 LTTE radio announced that ten senior LTTE cadres, including Kittu, had committed suicide. Three days of mourning, starting 18 January 1993, were announced.

To persistently or habitually keep a disorderly house is an offence against the common law, punishable by fine or imprisonment. The usual charge for keeping a brothel where prostitution can be proven, for instance, is under section 33A of the Sexual Offences Act 1956, \\"Keeping a Brothel for Prostitution\\", and the penalty is up to six months if proceeding summarily or seven years if by indictment. (The definition of a brothel in English law has been held to be \\"a place where people of opposite sexes are allowed to resort for illicit intercourse, whether…common prostitutes or not\\"Winter v Woolfe [1931] KB 549. and thus prostitution need not form part of the picture; a soapland is, in the eyes of the law of England, a brothel without prostitution.) Brothel-keeping can, however, also be charged as \\"Keeping a Disorderly House\\" (contrary to the common law rather than any written statute), and is then punishable by an unlimited fine, and unlimited imprisonment. The \\"operator\\" of a crack palace or opium den can also be charged with keeping a disorderly house, as can the owner/operator of an illegal gambling establishment, as well as the owner of a speakeasy, \\"blind tiger\\", or \\"boozecan\\" (illegal bar or pub). Modern vice laws, regulating such things as drinking, gambling, dancing, and drugs, have resulted in calls for the offence of keeping a disorderly house to be abolished. As brothel-keeping is one of the most common causes for the charge of keeping a disorderly house, \\"disorderly house\\" has become something of a euphemism for brothel in the English legal community; brothel or \\"disorderly house\\"-related statutory offences can be found under sections 33 to 36 of the Sexual Offences Act 1956. These are, however, not to be confused with the common-law offence of Keeping A Disorderly House.

Eufemiusz Czaplic was born into an old Polish noble family Czaplic (Kierdeja coat of arms) and began military service in the Polish army, but entered Russian service with a rank of second major on 26 October 1783. During the Russo-Turkish War of 1787–92, he served on the staff of Prince Potemkin and took part in the battles of Ochakov, Bendery and Akkerman. He received the Order of St. Vladimir of 4th degree with bow for the capture of Izmail, where he commanded the chasseurs. In 1792 he became Lieutenant Colonel and was transferred to the Smolensk Dragoon Regiment of General Mikhail Kakhovsky. During the Kościuszko's Uprising of 1794 Czaplic was sent by Baron Igelström to carry out peace negotiations with the Poles, but was wounded and captured at Warsaw. He was soon released and participated in the Persian Campaign of 1796, where he commanded Grebensk and Semeiny Cossack regiments. His regiments captured Derbent and Baku, for which Czaplic was promoted to the rank of Colonel on 13 June 1796. Upon his accession to the throne, Emperor Paul I recalled the army back to Russia and had Czaplic dismissed from the military on 27 February 1798. However, on 27 March 1801, the fourth day after his assumption of the throne, Emperor Alexander I returned Czaplic to service with the rank of Major General and on 11 November 1803 appointed him to the Imperial Retinue. During the 1805 Campaign he commanded the vanguard of Prince Pyotr Bagration Corps and participated in actions at Lambach, Amstetten (receiving the Order of St. George of 3rd degree, 24 January 1806) and Schöngrabern. After the Battle of Austerlitz he protected the retreat of the Russian Army. He became chief of the Pavlograd Hussar Regiment on 23 July 1806, and commander of the cavalry brigade on 23 October 1806. Czaplic participated in the Prussian campaign and distinguished himself at the Golymin, Allenstein, and served as commandant of Königsberg for two weeks. From October 1809 to July 1810 Czaplic commanded the 7th Division, and in November 1810, took command of the Reserve Cavalry Corps. He led the 4th Cavalry Division from February to March 1811 and in May 1811 the 8th Cavalry Division. He was appointed commander of the 3rd Reserve Cavalry Corps of the 2nd Reserve Army of Observation on 7 April 1812. He defeated Saxon troops at Kobryn and Slonim and took into captivity one General, 66 officers and 2300 soldiers with 4 standard and 8 cannon. For that and other engagements, in September 1812 he was appointed commander of the infantry corps of the 3rd Army and acted against Lithuanian Guards of general Konopka. On 12 November 1812 he was promoted to lieutenant general and led the advance-guard of Admiral Pavel Chichagov's army to the Berezina River, and fought the French at Borisov on 26 November 1812, where he was lightly wounded in the head. He captured Vilnius on 28 November 1812. In 1813, Czaplic served at Toruń, was given command of cavalry of the army of Poland, and fought at the Leipzig. In 1814, he participated in the siege of Hamburg and assumed command of the 3rd Corps of the Army of Poland on 18 April 1814. In 1817, Czaplic rose to command the 3rd Hussar Division. He was relieved of command on 27 February 1823. During his career, he also received the Prussian Order of the Red Eagle, the French Order of Légion d'honneur, the Russian Order of Alexander Nevsky, the Order of St. Anna of 1st degree with diamonds, the Order of St. Vladimir of 2nd degree and a golden sword with diamonds.

In present-day use, however, apologetics is no longer treated as part of dogmatic theology but has attained the rank of an independent science, being generally regarded as the introduction to and foundation of dogmatic theology. The term dogmatic theology became more widely used following the Protestant Reformation and was used to designate the articles of faith that the Church had officially formulated. An example of dogmatic theology is the doctrinal statements or dogmas that were formulated by the early church councils who sought to resolve theological problems and to take a stance against a heretical teaching. These creeds or dogmas that came out of the church councils were considered to be authoritative and binding on all Christians because the church officially affirmed them. One of the purposes of dogmatic theology is to formulate and communicate doctrine that is considered essential to Christianity and which if denied would constitute heresy. Definition Dogmatic theology may be defined as the scientificDogmatics in Outline (1949) by Karl Barth exposition of the entire theoretical doctrine concerning God and God's external activity, based on the dogmas of the Church. Dogmatic theology emphasizes the importance of propositional truth over experiential, sensory perceptions. The Roman Catholic Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith is charged with ensuring fidelity to Catholic teaching regarding theology and doctrine among all members of the Church – especially in disputes or unsolved issues involving theology and the faith, and in dealing with individuals (especially clergy, religious, and catechists, where orthodoxy is a special concern, but also laypeople) whose teachings or statements have been judged erroneous at the local level. In 1989, the Congregation's International Theological Commission prepared a document on doctrinal theology called \\"The Interpretation of Dogma\\". This happened when Pope Benedict XVI was Prefect of the Congregation and thus President of the Commission. Origin of the term The term \\"dogmatic theology\\" is thought to have first appeared in 1659 in the title of a book by L. Reinhard. A. M. Fairbairn holds that it was the fame of Petau which gave currency to the new coinage \\"dogmatic theology\\"; and though the same or related phrases had been used repeatedly by writers of less influence since Reinhard and Andreas Essenius, F. Buddeus (Institutiones theol. dogmat., 1723; Compendium, 1728) is held to have given the expression its supremacy. Noel Alexandre, the Gallican theologian, possibly introduced it in the Roman Catholic Church (1693; Theologia dogmatica et moralis). Both Roman Catholic and Protestant authorities agree that the expression was connected with the new habit of distinguishing dogmatics from Christian ethics or moral theology, though Albert Schweizer denies this of Reinhard. In another direction dogmas and dogmatic theology were also contrasted with truths of reason and natural theology.

The first formal school (Durbar School), established by Jung Bahadur Rana in 1853, was intended for the elite. The birth of Nepalese democracy in 1951 opened its classrooms to a more diverse population. Education in Nepal from the primary school to the university level has been modeled from the very inception on the Indian system, which is in turn the legacy of the old British Raj. Nepal's 1971 education plan hastened its development in the country. In 1951 Nepal had 10,000 students in 300 schools and an adult literacy rate of five percent. There were 49,000 schools in 2010, and by 2015 the overall adult literacy rate was 63.9 percent (males 76.4 percent and females 53.1 percent). It has already been more than half decade that public schools started imparting the education in the country. Administration Schoolchildren in Kathmandu The Ministry of Education is responsible for managing educational activities in Nepal. The Minister of Education (assisted by the state or assistant minister) is the political leader of the ministry. The ministry, as a part of the government, is headed by the Secretary of Education and consists of a central national office and other offices at the regional and district levels. The central office is primarily responsible for policy development, planning, monitoring, and evaluation. The ministry has established directorates in each of the five development regions and education offices in each of Nepal's 76 districts to bring educational administration to the people. These decentralized offices are responsible for overseeing local informal and school-level educational activities. Regional directorates are primarily responsible for coordinating, monitoring and evaluating educational activities, and the district education offices provide services. The National Center for Educational Development (NCED) is Nepal's teacher-training body. It has 34 educational training centers (ETCs) to provide pedagogical support for teachers. Nepal has two primary types of schools: community and institutional. Community (public) schools receive government grants, and institutional (private) schools are self-funded. Institutional schools are non-profit trusts or companies. With one exception, all universities and academies are publicly managed and supported by public funding. Public universities also provide affiliation to private colleges. Academies of higher education are typically single-college institutes, and universities have constituent and affiliated colleges across Nepal. Structure Teacher and schoolchildren in Pokhara Primary education in Nepal called Basic Education consists of grades one through eight. Secondary levels are grades nine to twelve. Pre-primary education is available in some areas, and students usually begin grade one at age five. A Basic Level Examination (BLE), previously known as District Level Examination (DLE), is given on grade eight while a national Secondary Education Exam (SEE), previously known as School Leaving Certificate (SLC), is examination is conducted at the end of grade 10, while completing the Grade 12 examination leads to the School Leaver's Certificate. The National Examinations Board (NEB) supervises all BLE, SEE and 12th grade exams. University education leads successfully to the degrees of bachelor, master and doctor (Ph.D). Depending upon the educational stream and degree subject, a bachelor's degree may require as much as three to five years of study, but two years is the typical duration. Some universities offer M.Phil. and post-graduate diplomas. Vocational education begins after lower secondary education, and students can follow a two-year curriculum leading to a Technical School Leaving Certificate. Universities also offer professional and technical degrees. In addition to the formal track, one-year programs focusing on skills development are also available. The District Level Examination is given in grade eight. The new educational system has two levels: basic (grades one through eight) and secondary (grades nine through twelve). Crises and illiteracy Although the Jhapa District with 99.33% literate in 2014 {{site web url= https://moe.gov.np/category/reports.html many children in remote villages do not have access to education past the primary level. Sociologists have identified the Chepang people the \\"poorest of the poor\\" in Nepal.Beine, Caughley and Shrestha. 2012. Chepang Then and Now: Life and Change Among the Chepang of Nepal. Blurb Books. Students often leave primary schools after they learn to read and write, but without additional education these skills may be forgotten. The April 2015 earthquake and 2015 blockade destroyed schools and severely impacted the nation's ability to keep its remaining schools open. Textbooks secondhanded textbook at their home Government schools use Janak textbooks, and private schools use reference books such as Green, Koseli, Ekta, Read More, Reliant, Asia, and Vidyarthi. Government schools perform poorly in the SLC exam, presently SEE exam, due to the lack of skilled teachers, textbooks, and the Ministry of Education's neglect of textbook reform. Tertiary Education =Universities= Nepal's first college was Tri-Chandra College, founded in 1918. Until 1985, Tribhuvan University was the country's only university. During the early 1980s, the government developed the concept of a multi-university system in which each school would have its own nature, content, and function. The first new university was Mahendra Sanskrit University. It was followed by Kathmandu University (the first private university) in 1990 and Purbanchal and Pokhara Universities in 1995 and 1996, respectively. =Medical colleges= Medical colleges, mostly private, exist throughout Nepal. Local students are admitted after an entrance exam, and foreign students are admitted after an interview. To be eligible for admission to MBBS courses in Nepal's medical colleges, students must pass the higher secondary examination in science or its equivalent. Medical education is regulated by the Medical Council of Nepal. In addition to accrediting the country's medical colleges, the council conducts the licensing examination for new doctors, makes policies related to curriculum, admission, terms and examinations and makes registration recommendations. =Engineering colleges= Engineering colleges also exist throughout Nepal, with most admitting local students through an entrance exam. Like the country's medical colleges, foreign students are admitted after an interview. To be eligible for admission to Nepalese engineering colleges, candidates are encouraged to pass the Intermediate in Science or have a diploma in engineering (or its equivalent). The Institute of Engineering of Tribhuvan University is the country's oldest engineering school. It has four colleges, and 13 private engineering colleges are affiliated with it. The IOE's central campus (Pulchowk Campus) as well as Kathmandu university school of engineering are considered to be the best engineering college in Nepal. Pulchowk offers bachelor's, master's and Ph.D. degrees in engineering. More than 16,000 students from around the world take the school's entrance examination. Nepal Engineering College (NEC) in Changunarayan is the country's first private engineering college to offer bachelor's- and master's-level courses. Popular engineering fields in Nepal are architecture, civil engineering, computer engineering, electronics and communications, electrical and electronics, energy and rural engineering. The B.E. architecture courses take five years to complete, and other bachelor's-degree courses take four years. Study abroad Nepal ranks 11th in countries of origin for international students in the United States. According to \\"Open Doors 2009\\", the annual report on international academic mobility published by the Institute of International Education with support from the Bureau of Educational and Cultural Affairs of the United States Department of State, the number of Nepali students enrolled in U.S. institutions of higher education increased from 8,936 in the 2007–08 academic year to 11,581 in 2008–09 (a 29.6-percent increase). In the 2006–07 academic year, Nepal ranked 13th among countries of origin of international students. According to Terry J. White, counselor for public affairs at the U.S. Embassy in Kathmandu, \\"America's nearly 3,000 accredited schools of higher education continue to attract new students in what is becoming a highly competitive international 'market' around the world.\\" The U.S. is the preferred destination for students from Nepal who want to study abroad because of the quality and prestige associated with an American degree. Another contributing factor is access to comprehensive, accurate information about study in the U.S. through EducationUSA offices in Nepal and increased activity by United States colleges and universities to attract students from Nepal. However, \\"a culture of disrespect\\" for humble Nepalese by U.S. Embassy staff has been reported by a co-founder of Nepali/American NGO, Possible Health.

This class of multiple unit was constructed using the Mark 1 bodyshell and was slam-door. Service history Each unit was formed of four coaches, in the formation BDTS – MBS – TC – DTS. The initial set numbers were 201-312, later prefixed by the class number 302. In March 1959, a Class 302 worked the first electric train between Colchester and Clacton. They were among the first 25 kV units delivered to the Eastern Region and, although ordered for the LT&S; electrification, a route they were long associated with, they were used initially on the Liverpool Street to Hertford East, Bishops Stortford and Enfield Town lines when they were electrified in November 1960. The 302s also stepped in when the AC electrification was extended to Chelmsford in 1961 and when the Class 305 units were having problems on the then new north-east London electric services. Some formations (those on the Enfield Town services) were temporarily reduced to three cars for this work. Between November 1961 and June 1962, the class suffered traction motor insulation trouble which meant the motors had to be re-wound. The first 20 units remained on the GE main line for the bulk of their lives, with the remainder operating on the LT&S; from Fenchurch Street from 1962. Like all the Eastern Region AC EMUs of the period, they were equipped to operate on both 25 kV AC and the reduced 6.25 kV voltage in the inner London areas where headroom for the overhead wires was reduced. On the LT&S; the changeover point was just east of Barking station on both Upminster and Tilbury routes. Trailer coaches were originally fitted with Gresley bogies which were replaced on Driving Trailer (DT) and Trailer Standard Open (TSO) which was formerly Composite Trailer and B5 Bogies on Battery Driving Trailer which became Battery Composite Trailer, the refurbishment moved first class accommodation to a position over the Westinghouse CM38 main compressor which was noisy and caused vibration. The Motor Coach retained its Gresley derived bogies after refurbishment. The Battery Driving Trailer and Driving Trailer were fitted with drop head buckeye couplers with screw coupler in the Guards Van, retractable buffers are also fitted only on outer ends of the Battery Driving Trailer/Driving Trailer. Originally the vehicles were insulated with blue asbestos which was removed and sealed during refurbishments in the early 1980s. Between 1962 and 1972, unit 302 312 was the first electric train fitted with Thyristor control equipment. Unit 302 244 was involved in an accident in 1972 with a lorry at a level crossing at Low Street railway station in Tilbury, after which it was decided to scrap the leading carriage. This was replaced with a carriage originally belonging to a Manchester-Bury Line Class 504. Following the privatisation of British Rail, ownership of the units passed to Eversholt Rail Group with all units being leased by LTS Rail. The class was fully withdrawn from service in 1999, due to the age of the units, with some being 40 years old. They were replaced by Class 310 units, Class 312 units and Class 317 units, the latter of which were on loan from WAGN. Electrical equipment 302 203 at on a Pitsea service in 1993 Electrical equipment was supplied by English Electric with the majority of equipment being interchangeable with Class 308 units. Electrically there were three main systems, Control which operated at 110 volts DC, provided by nickel iron alkaline secondary cells, auxiliary 250 volts AC from the tertiary winding of the main transformer which provided power to the battery charger which was also rectified to power the main compressor, and finally power circuits derived from secondary winding of the main transformer at 1,500 volts AC. The primary winding of the transformer was designed to operate on either 6.25 kV or 25 kV with voltage sensing equipment fitted to ensure the correct arrangement of primary windings for a given voltage. An incorrect voltage selection device was fitted to both the Class 302 and Class 308 stock so that if the primary winding was connected for 6.25 kV when supplied with 25 kV the air blast circuit breaker (ABB) manufactured by ABB Asea Brown Boveri would remain closed but the pantograph would be lowered. Should this happen the transformer would require changing and overhaul as well as possibly other equipment due to flashover damage. The transformer was also protected by a Buchholz relay which monitored any gas build-up within the cooling/insulating oil, as the acetylene (ethyne) gas generated is highly explosive. All Class 302 and 308 stock were fitted with Stone Faiveley pantographs for current collection from the overhead line. A particular oddity of Eastern/Anglian region EMU stock was the fitting of fibre glass snow shields between the pantograph and the supporting insulators. One member of the class, 302 302, was experimentally fitted with thyristor control in the early 1970s. After the experiment it was converted back to the original tap changer control, although the guard's van remained slightly different internally. Class 302/9 - non-passenger conversions 302990 in Royal Mail red at Ilford in 1989 The sub-classification 302/9 was used for six non- passenger carrying conversions. Units 302990-992 were reduced to three-car length and converted for use as Royal Mail parcels units, with the addition of bodyside roller shutter doors, and repainted in Royal Mail red livery. Units 302996-998 were also reduced to three-car length and used as departmental sandite rail treatment units, later being reclassified as Class 937. Preservation Two driving trailers, 75033 and 75250, which belonged to units 302 201 and 302 227, are preserved at Mangapps Farm Railway Museum near Burnham-on-Crouch, Essex. These units have been repainted into BR overall blue with yellow ends and are still in very good condition, with the destination scrolls still in working order, the seats still in British Rail colours and the Network South East maps still in very good condition. The rest of the fleet has been scrapped since withdrawal in late 1999.

Online ethnography has by far the wider use. As modifications of the term ethnography, cyber-ethnography, online ethnography and virtual ethnography (as well as many other methodological neologisms) designate particular variations regarding the conduct of online fieldwork that adapts ethnographic methodology. There is no canonical approach to cyber-ethnography that prescribes how ethnography is adapted to the online setting. Instead individual researchers are left to specify their own adaptations. Netnography is another form of online ethnography or cyber-ethnography with more specific sets of guidelines and rules, and a common multidisciplinary base of literature and scholars. This article is not about a particular neologism, but the general application of ethnographic methods to online fieldwork as practiced by anthropologists, sociologists, and other scholars.  Introduction  Traditional ethnography study observes the interactions between individuals who are co-located. Ethnographies of online cultures and communities extend ethnographic study to settings where interactions are technologically mediated, not face-to-face. Cyber-ethnography therefore addresses limitations in the traditional notion of a field site as a localized space. It also understands that online communities can create a shared culture through digitally mediated interactions. Although the assertion that ethnographic fieldwork can be meaningfully applied to computer-mediated interactions has been contested,Clifford, J. (1997). Spatial Practices: Fieldwork, Travel, and the Discipline of Anthropology. In A. Gupta & J. Ferguson (Eds.) Anthropological Locations: Boundaries and Grounds of a Field Science. Berkeley, CA: University of California Press, 185-222. it is increasingly becoming accepted. Like other early internet researchers, early cyber-ethnographers such as Sandy Stone and Sherry Turkle observed that participants in online role-playing communities enact social performances that can diverge dramatically from their offline personas.Robinson, L., & Schulz, J., \\"New fieldsites, new methods: New ethnographic opportunities,\\" Ch. 8 In The Handbook of Emergent Technologies in Social Research. This led to the idea that online identities can be segmented from offline ones. Cyber-ethnography was seen as a new kind of methodology that might uncover how the internet would radically change society. However, as the internet reached the mainstream and cyber-ethnographers sought legitimacy, cyber-ethnography was reframed as adaptation of traditional methods into a new context. Understanding the degree to which divergent performances in online and offline settings reflect a segmentation of identity or a continuous identity performed differently in different contexts remains an important consideration for cyber ethnographers. Many other aspects of online, computer-mediated, or virtual, interaction and community formation are distinct from their in-person, real life, or face-to-face counterparts. Of central importance is that many interactions in online communities are textual. While these textual artifacts resemble the traces of interaction, they constitute the interactions of interest to the cyberethnographer. They are a different kind of interaction in which body language and other kinds of social cues are absent or translated into signs and text. The character and level of access available to researchers of online communities are also particular to cyber-ethnography. Whereas face-to-face interactions are ephemeral as they occur, online social interactions are often automatically saved and archived, creating permanent accurate records. Also, distinctions between private and public spaces are often unclear in online communities. cyber-ethnography attempts to adapt participant-observation procedures such as making cultural entrée, collecting and analyzing data, and conducting ethical research to these computer-mediated contingencies. Cyber-ethnography has significantly developed with the emergence of new technologies. Almost since their inception, some researchers have acted as lurkers and conducted purely observational studies of online cultures and communities rather than as participant observers in an online community.Del Fresno, Miguel (2011) Netnografía. Investigación, análisis e intervención social. Editorial UOC, 1ª edición, Barcelona, España This approach has been criticized by scholars who argue that researchers should fully participate as members of the online community.Bell, D. (2001). An introduction to cyberculture. New York: RoutledgeMiller, D., and Slater, D. (2000). The Internet: An ethnographic approach. Oxford; New York: Berg. These scholars value the traditional ethnographic standards of participant observation, prolonged engagement, and deep immersion. Cyber-ethnography, like traditional ethnography often aims to produce a thick description that can help an outsider understand the meaning of behavior in a culture or community. This focus on participation and immersion makes these approaches quite distinct from qualitative internet research methods like online interviews, and online content analysis. Ethnographic methods are also quite different from quantitative Internet research methods like web usage mining or social network analysis. However some researchers complementary research methods along with cyber-ethnography in order to triangulate their findings. The range of methodologies Ethnographers have approached the study of the Internet in a range of different ways. A variety of terms refer to various formulations of methodological approaches to cyber-ethnography. Many of these seek to maintain their own dialog with the established tradition of ethnography. Each formulates its relation to the established anthropological tradition in different (and sometimes inconsistent) ways. Some think that ethnographies conducted online involve a distinctive methodological approach. Others think that cyber-ethnography is not a distinctive form of ethnography although researching the Internet ethnographically forces us to reflect on fundamental assumptions and concepts of ethnography. Methods choices need to be directly adapted to the kind of questions a researcher seeks to answer. The main advantage of cyber-ethnography reside in the scope and scale of the available data. Other advantages include seeking input directly from participants. For example, posting raw fieldnotes on a blog and allowing participants to leave comments can provide transparency. Cyber-ethnography also allows for a variety of data collection types and including audiovisual formats, on various platforms such as websites, social networks and forums. = Offline participant observation = It is important for cyber- ethnographers to consider whether online interactions are sufficient for them to develop a deep understanding the community. It is not clear whether identity performances in online environments should be thought of as disjoint from offline identities or if they are continuous with offline identities. When researchers feel that understanding the relationship between the online and offline identities of members is necessary, they may seek to meet with informants face-to-face. Urban ethnographer Jeffrey Lane suggests that it may increasingly be necessary to weave online and offline identities of informants together in order to create an accurate portrayal of urban street life. He borrows media scholar danah boyd’s concept of “networked publics,” which are “simultaneously (1) the space constructed through networked technologies and (2) the imagined collective that emerges as a result of the intersection of people, technology, and practice,” to frame his argument. Interactions that take place offline may appear one way to a participant observer but are further contextualized when examining online forms of communication between the same parties involved in the offline interaction. In the same way, information that is transmitted online can significantly influence activities that take place offline. For instance, one of Lane’s informants encounters a video on Twitter suggesting that there are violent incidents taking place in the area. In response, he sends a text blast to all of his contacts to be cautious that evening. In order to preserve the construction of a networked public, researchers should take into consideration both online and offline identities and activities of individuals. Lane also acknowledges that not all scholars may agree with his argument, but they will eventually have to face the issue as advancements in technology continue to increase. However, other cyber-ethnographers have argued that difference between online and offline selves is similar to the different identity performances that occur in other contexts. This perspective views identity issues in cyber-ethnography as consistent with those of traditional ethnography. Researchers should thus consider how community members relate their online and offline selves. If it is normal for community members to bring together their online and offline identities and meet face-to-face then it makes sense that the ethnographer should observe or participate in these offline interactions in order to fully understand the community as was done by Sherry Turkle. This finding has been supported by Sara Ross in her work on legal anthropology in urban settings such as Toronto, Canada. However, many cyber-ethnographers including Hine and Walstrom believe that participant observation in the offline setting can be biased by asymmetry between the researcher and the member. This is because community members rely on computer mediated communication they may be at a disadvantage to a researcher who understands their online interactions, but also employ face-to-face communication. As it is often the case that researchers are interested in understanding the interactions in the online context and that comparing online and offline identity is not important, credible ethnographic studies can be done in online-only contexts. = Limitations = One of the main disadvantages of online ethnography is the need for the ethnographer to possess certain technology-based skills. Some studies might only require elementary computer skills, but others may require advanced knowledge of technologies and tools such as web-based applications, analytical tools, and computer programming. The development of such technologies tends to grow faster than the methodology literature thus \\"there is little consensus on how [to] best collect and analyze new media data\\". The temporal nature of online data can also be an issue. Cyber-ethnographers might ask, \\"What is data of the present?\\" Robinson (2011) states that in cases such as YouTube videos and subsequent comments, \\"the present cyber-reality may be interpreted as a continual accumulation of all past input by members or participants\\". Cyber-ethnographers also needs to also think of his/her own identify and how \\"[it] might become part of a feedback loop with those he/she is studying\\" and whether or not it eschews the data collected and the integrity of the study. Thus, there is a need for cyber-ethnographers to be particularly flexible and reflexive in their practice of ethnography. Another limitation of cyber-ethnography is that it complicates matters of privacy. Although researchers have always had to take people who were not originally part of an ethnographic study into consideration, cyber-ethnography allows researchers to actually see “identifiable records of these connections and interactions.” As a result, researchers may have to take extra precaution in asking informants’ for their permission to participate in their research, as well as in concealing the identities of said informants.  Ethics  To the extent that cyber-ethnography is similar to ethnography in a localized space, it will raise similar ethical considerations. However, the nature of the online space does raise new ethical issues, including those related to informed consent of human subjects, protections of privacy or anonymity of research subjects, and whether cyber-ethnography might be a form of \\"electronic eavesdropping.\\" In spite of these differences, the American Anthropological Association has yet to include any specific recommendations regarding cyber-ethnography in its Code of Ethics.http://www.aaanet.org/issues/policy-advocacy/upload/2009-AAA-Ethics- Code.pdf Thus, there are significant ethical issues around the use of digital tools, data collection from cyberspace, and whether cyberethnographers respect privacy in cyberspace.Murthy, D. (2011) \\"Emergent digital ethnographic methods for social research,\\" Ch. 7 In The Handbook of Emergent Technologies in Social Research. That a website is not password-protected against a researcher does not necessarily imply that it is open space where the right to anonymity and privacy dissolve. Thus, Robinson (2011) insists, \\"if our identities in cyberspace are extensions of our off-line identities, they must be afforded the same ethical consideration as they would be given in the off-line world\\". Institutional review boards (IRBs) may not be equipped for ethical dilemmas presented by cyber-ethnography. Researchers need to make their intentions clear and define properly what data will be collected. When researchers \\"lurk\\" by covertly observing and gathering data, they do not gain participants' knowledge and consent. This conflicts with the traditional ethnographic practice of informed consent, in which participants have the right to learn about the study at hand and make an informed decision on whether or not to participate. Cyber-ethnographers face the challenge of informing participants of their presence and research activities without jeopardizing their ability to collect valid data. Scholars recommend including note in the researcher's posts that identifies their research interest and links to more information. However, this practice is only possible in some online spaces, such as forums, but not in others. Another issue is that the technological innovations and possibility for new research outpace the creation of clear and adapted ethical guidelines. Nonetheless, some guidelines do exist and are regularly updated by the Association of Internet Researchers (AoIR). Another ethical constraint and a possible disadvantage to cyber-ethnography is the intricate anonymization of the data. Protecting participant anonymity often conflicts with the preservation of the participants' words. Although, consent might be obtained from participants to collect, use and publish textual data, the simple use of pseudonyms is in most cases not enough to guarantee the anonymity of the data. Indeed, searching for direct quotes in a Google search is often sufficient to identify participants. anyone can potentially have access to search results revealing the author and their identity. To mitigate this issue, many scholars choose to paraphrase textual data to avoid source identification. Thus, \\"ethical concerns must be reexamined in light of new technologies for both subjects and researchers alike\\".

The film revisits the themes of fate, conscience, and circumstance that the Coen brothers had explored in the films Blood Simple (1984), Raising Arizona (1987), and Fargo (1996). No Country for Old Men premiered in competition at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival on May 19. Critics praised the Coens' direction and screenplay and Bardem's performance, and the film won 76 awards from 109 nominations across multiple organizations; it won four awards at the 80th Academy Awards—Best Picture, Best Director(s), Best Supporting Actor (Bardem) and Best Adapted Screenplay—three British Academy Film Awards (BAFTAs), including Best Director(s), and two Golden Globes. The American Film Institute listed it as an AFI Movie of the Year, and the National Board of Review selected the film as the best of 2007. More critics included No Country for Old Men on their 2007 top ten lists than any other film, and many regard it as the Coen brothers' best film. , various sources had recognized it as one of the best films of its decade. The Guardians John Patterson wrote: \\"the Coens' technical abilities, and their feel for a landscape-based Western classicism reminiscent of Anthony Mann and Sam Peckinpah, are matched by few living directors\\", and Peter Travers of Rolling Stone said that it is \\"a new career peak for the Coen brothers\\" and \\"as entertaining as hell\\". In 2016, it was voted the 10th best film of the 21st century as picked by 177 film critics from around the world.  Plot  In Texas, 1980, hitman Anton Chigurh strangles a deputy sheriff to escape custody and uses a captive bolt pistol to kill a driver and steal his car. He spares the life of a gas station owner who accepts a challenge and successfully guesses the result of Chigurh's coin flip. Hunting pronghorns in the desert, Llewelyn Moss comes across the aftermath of a drug deal gone bad. He finds several dead men and dogs, a wounded Mexican man begging for water, a stash of drugs in the vehicle and two million dollars in a briefcase. He takes the money and returns home. That night, Moss returns to the scene with water. He is pursued by two men in a truck and escapes. At home, he sends his wife, Carla Jean, to stay with her mother, then drives to a motel in Del Rio, where he hides the briefcase in his room's air duct. Chigurh, hired to recover the money, arrives to search Moss's home, where he uses his bolt pistol to blow the lock out of the door. Investigating the break in, Terrell County Sheriff Ed Tom Bell observes the blown-out lock. Following an electronic tracking device hidden in the money, Chigurh goes to Moss's motel room and kills a group of Mexicans who are waiting to ambush Moss with his shotgun. Moss has rented a second room adjacent to the Mexicans' room with access to the duct where the money is hidden. He retrieves the briefcase just before Chigurh opens the duct. Moving to a hotel in the border town of Eagle Pass, Moss discovers the tracking device, but Chigurh has already found him. Their firefight spills onto the streets, killing a bystander, and both are wounded. Moss flees across to Mexico, stashing the case of money in weeds along the Rio Grande. Finding Moss severely injured, a passing norteño band takes him to a hospital. Carson Wells, another hired operative, fails to persuade Moss to accept protection in return for the money. Chigurh cleans and stitches his own wounds with stolen supplies and sneaks up on Wells at his hotel. After Wells unsuccessfully attempts to barter for his life, Chigurh kills him in his hotel room. Moss telephones the room and Chigurh answers; Chigurh vows to kill Carla Jean unless Moss gives up the money. Moss retrieves the case from the bank of the Rio Grande and arranges to meet Carla Jean at a motel in El Paso, where he plans to give her the money and hide her from danger. Carla Jean is approached by Sheriff Bell, who promises to protect Moss. Carla Jean's mother unwittingly reveals Moss's location to a group of Mexicans who had been tailing them. Bell reaches the motel rendezvous at El Paso, only to hear gunshots and spot a pickup truck speeding from the motel. As Bell enters the parking lot, he sees Moss lying dead. When Carla Jean arrives, she chokes up upon finding out her husband is dead. That night, Bell returns to the crime scene and finds the lock blown out. Chigurh hides behind the door after retrieving the money. Bell enters Moss's room and sees that the vent has been removed. Later, Bell visits his uncle Ellis, an ex-lawman, and tells him he plans to retire because he feels \\"overmatched\\" by the recent violence. Ellis rebuts that the region has always been violent. Weeks later, Carla Jean returns from her mother's funeral to find Chigurh waiting in her bedroom, per his threat to Moss. She refuses his offer of a coin toss for her life, stating that he cannot pass blame to luck: the choice is his. Chigurh checks his boots as he leaves the house. As he drives through the neighborhood, a car crashes into his at an intersection and Chigurh is injured. He bribes two young witnesses for their silence and flees. Now retired, Bell shares two dreams with his wife. In the first, he lost some money his father had given him. In the other, he and his father were riding through a snowy mountain pass; his father had gone ahead to make a fire in the darkness and wait for Bell.  Cast  * Tommy Lee Jones as Ed Tom Bell * Javier Bardem as Anton Chigurh * Josh Brolin as Llewelyn Moss * Woody Harrelson as Carson Wells * Kelly Macdonald as Carla Jean Moss * Garret Dillahunt as Wendell * Tess Harper as Loretta Bell * Barry Corbin as Ellis * Stephen Root as Man who hires Wells * Rodger Boyce as El Paso Sheriff * Beth Grant as Carla Jean's mother * Ana Reeder as Poolside Woman * Josh Blaylock as Boy on Bike The role of Llewelyn Moss was originally offered to Heath Ledger, but he turned it down to spend time with his newborn daughter Matilda. Garret Dillahunt was also in the running for the role of Llewelyn Moss, auditioning five times for the role, but instead was offered the part of Wendell, Ed Tom Bell's deputy. Josh Brolin was not the Coens' first choice, and enlisted the help of Quentin Tarantino and Robert Rodriguez to make an audition reel. His agent eventually secured a meeting with the Coens and he was given the part. Javier Bardem nearly withdrew from the role of Anton Chigurh due to issues with scheduling. English actor Mark Strong was put on standby to take over, but the scheduling issues were resolved and Bardem took on the role.  Production  Producer Scott Rudin bought the film rights to McCarthy's novel and suggested an adaptation to the Coen brothers, who at the time were attempting to adapt the novel To the White Sea by James Dickey. By August 2005, the Coens agreed to write and direct the film, having identified with how it provided a sense of place and also how it played with genre conventions. Joel Coen said that the book's unconventional approach \\"was familiar, congenial to us; we're naturally attracted to subverting genre. We liked the fact that the bad guys never really meet the good guys, that McCarthy did not follow through on formula expectations.\\" Ethan Coen explained that the \\"pitiless quality\\" was a \\"hallmark of the book, which has an unforgiving landscape and characters but is also about finding some kind of beauty without being sentimental.\\" The adaptation was the second of McCarthy's work, following All the Pretty Horses in 2000. = Writing = The Coens' script was mostly faithful to the source material. On their writing process, Ethan said, \\"One of us types into the computer while the other holds the spine of the book open flat.\\" Still, they pruned where necessary. A teenage runaway who appeared late in the book and some backstory related to Bell were both removed. Also changed from the original was Carla Jean Moss's reaction when finally faced with the imposing figure of Chigurh. As explained by Kelly Macdonald, \\"the ending of the book is different. She reacts more in the way I react. She kind of falls apart. In the film she's been through so much and she can't lose any more. It's just she's got this quiet acceptance of it.\\" In the book, there is also some attention paid to the daughter, Deborah, whom the Bells lost and who haunts the protagonist in his thoughts. Richard Corliss of Time stated that \\"the Coen brothers have adapted literary works before. Miller's Crossing was a sly, unacknowledged blend of two Dashiell Hammett's tales, Red Harvest and The Glass Key; and O Brother Where Art Thou? transferred The Odyssey [of Homer] to the American south in the 1930s. But No Country for Old Men is their first film taken, pretty straightforwardly, from a [contemporary] prime American novel.\\" The writing is also notable for its minimal use of dialogue. Josh Brolin discussed his initial nervousness with having so little dialogue to work with: > I mean it was a fear, for sure, because dialogue, that's what you kind of > rest upon as an actor, you know? ... Drama and all the stuff is all dialogue > motivated. You have to figure out different ways to convey ideas. You don't > want to overcompensate because the fear is that you're going to be boring if > nothing's going on. You start doing this and this and taking off your hat > and putting it on again or some bullshit that doesn't need to be there. So > yeah, I was a little afraid of that in the beginning. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone praised the novel adaptation. \\"Not since Robert Altman merged with the short stories of Raymond Carver in Short Cuts have filmmakers and author fused with such devastating impact as the Coens and McCarthy. Good and evil are tackled with a rigorous fix on the complexity involved.\\" Director Joel Coen justified his interest in the McCarthy novel. \\"There's something about it – there were echoes of it in No Country for Old Men that were quite interesting for us\\", he said, \\"because it was the idea of the physical work that somebody does that helps reveal who they are and is part of the fiber of the story. Because you only saw this person in this movie making things and doing things in order to survive and to make this journey, and the fact that you were thrown back on that, as opposed to any dialogue, was interesting to us.\\" Coen stated that this is the brothers' \\"first adaptation\\". He further explained why they chose the novel: \\"Why not start with Cormac? Why not start with the best?\\" He further described this McCarthy book in particular as \\"unlike his other novels ... it is much pulpier.\\" Coen stated that they have not changed much in the adaptation. \\"It really is just compression,\\" he said. \\"We didn't create new situations.\\" He further assured that he and his brother Ethan had never met McCarthy when they were writing the script, but first met him during the shooting of the film. He believed that the author liked the film, while his brother Ethan said, \\"he didn't yell at us. We were actually sitting in a movie theater/screening room with him when he saw it ... and I heard him chuckle a couple of times, so I took that as a seal of approval, I don't know, maybe presumptuously.\\"  Title  The title is taken from the opening line of 20th-century Irish poet William Butler Yeats' poem \\"Sailing to Byzantium\\": : That is no country for old men. The young : In one another's arms, birds in the trees : – Those dying generations – at their song, : The salmon-falls, the mackerel-crowded seas, : Fish, flesh, or fowl, commend all summer long : Whatever is begotten, born, and dies. : Caught in that sensual music all neglect : Monuments of unageing intellect Richard Gillmore relates the Yeats poem to the Coens' film. \\"The lament that can be heard in these lines,\\" he says, \\"is for no longer belonging to the country of the young. It is also a lament for the way the young neglect the wisdom of the past and, presumably, of the old ... Yeats chooses Byzantium because it was a great early Christian city in which Plato's Academy, for a time, was still allowed to function. The historical period of Byzantium was a time of culmination that was also a time of transition. In his book of mystical writings, A Vision, Yeats says, 'I think that in early Byzantium, maybe never before or since in recorded history, religious, aesthetic, and practical life were one, that architect and artificers ... spoke to the multitude and the few alike.' The idea of a balance and a coherence in a society's religious, aesthetic, and practical life is Yeats's ideal ... It is an ideal rarely realized in this world and maybe not even in ancient Byzantium. Certainly within the context of the movie No Country for Old Men, one has the sense, especially from Bell as the chronicler of the times, that things are out of alignment, that balance and harmony are gone from the land and from the people.\\"  Differences from the novel  Craig Kennedy adds that \\"one key difference is that of focus. The novel belongs to Sheriff Bell. Each chapter begins with Bell's narration, which dovetails and counterpoints the action of the main story. Though the film opens with Bell speaking, much of what he says in the book is condensed and it turns up in other forms. Also, Bell has an entire backstory in the book that doesn't make it into the film. The result is a movie that is more simplified thematically, but one that gives more of the characters an opportunity to shine.\\" Jay Ellis elaborates on Chigurh's encounter with the man behind the counter at the gas station. \\"Where McCarthy gives us Chigurh's question as, 'What's the most you ever saw lost on a coin toss?', he says, 'the film elides the word 'saw', but the Coens of course tend to the visual. Where the book describes the setting as 'almost dark', the film clearly depicts high noon: no shadows are notable in the establishing shot of the gas station, and the sunlight is bright even if behind cloud cover. The light through two windows and a door comes evenly through three walls in the interior shots. But this difference increases our sense of the man's desperation later, when he claims he needs to close and he closes at 'near dark'; it is darker, as it were, in the cave of this man's ignorance than it is outside in the bright light of truth.\\"Spurgeon, Sara L. (2011), Part 2, Chapter 5: \\"Levels of Ellipsis in No Country for Old Men\\", p. 102, by Ellis, Jay. = Filming = The project was a co-production between Miramax Films and Paramount's classics-based division in a 50/50 partnership, and production was scheduled for May 2006 in New Mexico and Texas. With a total budget of $25 million (at least half spent in New Mexico), production was slated for the New Mexico cities of Santa Fe, Albuquerque, and Las Vegas (which doubled as the border towns of Eagle Pass and Del Rio, Texas), with other scenes shot around Marfa and Sanderson in West Texas. The U.S.-Mexico border crossing bridge was actually a freeway overpass in Las Vegas, with a border checkpoint set built at the intersection of Interstate 25 and New Mexico State Highway 65. The Mexican town square was filmed in Piedras Negras, Coahuila. In advance of shooting, cinematographer Roger Deakins saw that \\"the big challenge\\" of his ninth collaboration with the Coen brothers was \\"making it very realistic, to match the story ... I'm imagining doing it very edgy and dark, and quite sparse. Not so stylized.\\" \\"Everything's storyboarded before we start shooting,\\" Deakins said in Entertainment Weekly. \\"In No Country, there's maybe only a dozen shots that are not in the final film. It's that order of planning. And we only shot 250,000 feet, whereas most productions of that size might shoot 700,000 or a million feet of film. It's quite precise, the way they approach everything. ... We never use a zoom,\\" he said. \\"I don't even carry a zoom lens with me, unless it's for something very specific.\\" The famous coin-tossing scene between Chigurh and the old gas station clerk is a good example; the camera tracks in so slowly that the audience isn't even aware of the move. \\"When the camera itself moves forward, the audience is moving, too. You're actually getting closer to somebody or something. It has, to me, a much more powerful effect, because it's a three-dimensional move. A zoom is more like a focusing of attention. You're just standing in the same place and concentrating on one smaller element in the frame. Emotionally, that's a very different effect.\\" In a later interview, he mentioned the \\"awkward dilemma [that] No Country certainly contains scenes of some very realistically staged fictional violence, but ... without this violent depiction of evil there would not be the emotional 'pay off' at the end of the film when Ed Tom bemoans the fact that God has not entered his life.\\"Chapman King; Wallach; Welsh (2009), p. 224. = Directing = In an interview with The Guardian, Ethan said, \\"Hard men in the south-west shooting each other – that's definitely Sam Peckinpah's thing. We were aware of those similarities, certainly.\\" They discuss choreographing and directing the film's violent scenes in the Sydney Morning Herald: \\"'That stuff is such fun to do', the brothers chime in at the mention of their penchant for blood-letting. 'Even Javier would come in by the end of the movie, rub his hands together and say, 'OK, who am I killing today?' adds Joel. 'It's fun to figure out', says Ethan. 'It's fun working out how to choreograph it, how to shoot it, how to engage audiences watching it.'\\" Director Joel Coen described the process of film making: \\"I can almost set my watch by how I'm going to feel at different stages of the process. It's always identical, whether the movie ends up working or not. I think when you watch the dailies, the film that you shoot every day, you're very excited by it and very optimistic about how it's going to work. And when you see it the first time you put the film together, the roughest cut, is when you want to go home and open up your veins and get in a warm tub and just go away. And then it gradually, maybe, works its way back, somewhere toward that spot you were at before.\\" David Denby of The New Yorker criticized the way the Coens \\"disposed of\\" Llewelyn Moss. \\"The Coens, however faithful to the book\\", he said, \\"cannot be forgiven for disposing of Llewelyn so casually. After watching this foolhardy but physically gifted and decent guy escape so many traps, we have a great deal invested in him emotionally, and yet he's eliminated, off-camera, by some unknown Mexicans. He doesn't get the dignity of a death scene. The Coens have suppressed their natural jauntiness. They have become orderly, disciplined masters of chaos, but one still has the feeling that, out there on the road from nowhere to nowhere, they are rooting for it rather than against it.\\" Josh Brolin discussed the Coens' directing style in an interview, saying that the brothers \\"only really say what needs to be said. They don't sit there as directors and manipulate you and go into page after page to try to get you to a certain place. They may come in and say one word or two words, so that was nice to be around in order to feed the other thing. 'What should I do right now? I'll just watch Ethan go humming to himself and pacing. Maybe that's what I should do, too. In an interview with Logan Hill of New York magazine, Brolin said, \\"We had a load of fun making it. Maybe it was because we both [Brolin and Javier Bardem] thought we'd be fired. With the Coens, there's zero compliments, really zero anything. No 'nice work.' Nothing. And then—I'm doing this scene with Woody Harrelson. Woody can't remember his lines, he stumbles his way through it, and then both Coens are like, 'Oh my God! Fantastic!'\\" David Gritten of The Daily Telegraph wonders: \\"Are the Coens finally growing up?\\" He adds: \\"If [the film] feels pessimistic, Joel insists that's not the Coens' responsibility: 'I don't think the movie is more or less so than the novel. We tried to give it the same feeling.' The brothers do concede, however, that it's a dark piece of storytelling. 'It's refreshing for us to do different kinds of things,' says Ethan, 'and we'd just done a couple of comedies.'\\" = Musical score and sound = The Coens minimized the score used in the film, leaving large sections devoid of music. The concept was Ethan's, who persuaded a skeptical Joel to go with the idea. There is some music in the movie, scored by the Coens' longtime composer, Carter Burwell, but after finding that \\"most musical instruments didn't fit with the minimalist sound sculpture he had in mind ... he used singing bowls, standing metal bells traditionally employed in Buddhist meditation practice that produce a sustained tone when rubbed.\\" The movie contains a \\"mere\\" 16 minutes of music, with several of those in the end credits. The music in the trailer was called \\"Diabolic Clockwork\\" by Two Steps from Hell. Sound editing and effects were provided by another longtime Coens collaborator, Skip Lievsay, who used a mixture of emphatic sounds (gun shots) and ambient noise (engine noise, prairie winds) in the mix. The Foley for the captive bolt pistol used by Chigurh was created using a pneumatic nail gun. Anthony Lane of The New Yorker states that \\"there is barely any music, sensual or otherwise, and Carter Burwell's score is little more than a fitful murmur\\", and Douglas McFarland states that \\"perhaps [the film's] salient formal characteristic is the absence, with one telling exception, of a musical soundtrack, creating a mood conducive to thoughtful and unornamented speculation in what is otherwise a fierce and destructive landscape.\\"Conard, Mark T. (2009), Part 2, Chapter: No Country for Old Men As Moral Philosophy, p. 163, by McFarland, Douglas. Jay Ellis, however, disagrees. \\"[McFarland] missed the extremely quiet but audible fade in a few tones from a keyboard beginning when Chigurh flips the coin for the gas station man\\", he said. \\"This ambient music (by long-time Coens collaborator Carter Burwell) grows imperceptibly in volume so that it is easily missed as an element of the mis- en-scene. But it is there, telling our unconscious that something different is occurring with the toss; this becomes certain when it ends as Chigurh uncovers the coin on the counter. The deepest danger has passed as soon as Chigurh finds (and Javier Bardem's acting confirms this) and reveals to the man that he has won.\\"Spurgeon, Sara L. (2011), Part 2, Chapter 5: Levels of Ellipsis in No Country for Old Men, p. 100, by Ellis, Jay. In order to achieve such sound effect, Burwell \\"tuned the music's swelling hum to the 60-hertz frequency of a refrigerator.\\" Dennis Lim of The New York Times stressed that \\"there is virtually no music on the soundtrack of this tense, methodical thriller. Long passages are entirely wordless. In some of the most gripping sequences what you hear mostly is a suffocating silence.\\" Skip Lievsay, the film's sound editor called this approach \\"quite a remarkable experiment,\\" and added that \\"suspense thrillers in Hollywood are traditionally done almost entirely with music. The idea here was to remove the safety net that lets the audience feel like they know what's going to happen. I think it makes the movie much more suspenseful. You're not guided by the score and so you lose that comfort zone.\\" James Roman observes the effect of sound in the scene where Chigurh pulls in for gas at the Texaco rest stop. \\"[The] scene evokes an eerie portrayal of innocence confronting evil,\\" he says, \\"with the subtle images richly nuanced by sound. As the scene opens in a long shot, the screen is filled with the remote location of the rest stop with the sound of the Texaco sign mildly squeaking in a light breeze. The sound and image of a crinkled cashew wrapper tossed on the counter adds to the tension as the paper twists and turns. The intimacy and potential horror that it suggests is never elevated to a level of kitschy drama as the tension rises from the mere sense of quiet and doom that prevails.\\"Roman, James (2009), Chapter 9: \\"The New Millennium, 2000–2008\\", p. 379. Jeffrey Overstreet adds that \\"the scenes in which Chigurh stalks Moss are as suspenseful as anything the Coens have ever staged. And that has as much to do with what we hear as what we see. No Country for Old Men lacks a traditional soundtrack, but don't say it doesn't have music. The blip-blip-blip of a transponder becomes as frightening as the famous theme from Jaws. The sound of footsteps on the hardwood floors of a hotel hallway are as ominous as the drums of war. When the leather of a briefcase squeaks against the metal of a ventilation shaft, you'll cringe, and the distant echo of a telephone ringing in a hotel lobby will jangle your nerves.\\"  Style  While No Country for Old Men is a \\"doggedly faithful\\" adaptation of McCarthy's 2005 novel and its themes, the film also revisits themes which the Coens had explored in their earlier movies Blood Simple and Fargo. The three films share common themes, such as pessimism and nihilism. The novel's motifs of chance, free-will, and predestination are familiar territory for the Coen brothers, who presented similar threads and tapestries of \\"fate [and] circumstance\\" in earlier works including Raising Arizona, which featured another hitman, albeit less serious in tone.\\"Both book and movie offer glimpses of a huge, mysterious pattern that we and the characters can't quite see – that only God could see, if He hadn't given up and gone home.\\" Numerous critics cited the importance of chance to both the novel and the film, focusing on Chigurh's fate-deciding coin flipping, but noted that the nature of the film medium made it difficult to include the \\"self-reflective qualities of McCarthy's novel.\\" Still, the Coens open the film with a voice- over narration by Tommy Lee Jones (who plays Sheriff Ed Tom Bell) set against the barren Texas country landscape where he makes his home. His ruminations on a teenager he sent to the chair explain that, although the newspapers described the boy's murder of his 14-year-old girlfriend as a crime of passion, \\"he told me there weren't nothin' passionate about it. Said he'd been fixin' to kill someone for as long as he could remember. Said if I let him out of there, he'd kill somebody again. Said he was goin' to hell. Reckoned he'd be there in about 15 minutes.\\"Coen, Joel and Ethan, Adapted screenplay for No Country for Old Men. Chicago Sun-Times critic Roger Ebert praised the narration. \\"These words sounded verbatim to me from No Country for Old Men, the novel by Cormac McCarthy\\", he said. \\"But I find they are not quite. And their impact has been improved upon in the delivery. When I get the DVD of this film, I will listen to that stretch of narration several times; Jones delivers it with a vocal precision and contained emotion that is extraordinary, and it sets up the entire film.\\" In The Village Voice, Scott Foundas writes that \\"Like McCarthy, the Coens are markedly less interested in who (if anyone) gets away with the loot than in the primal forces that urge the characters forward ... In the end, everyone in No Country for Old Men is both hunter and hunted, members of some endangered species trying to forestall their extinction.\\"Foundas, Scott. \\"Badlands\\". Village Voice, November 6, 2007. Roger Ebert writes that \\"the movie demonstrates how pitiful ordinary human feelings are in the face of implacable injustice.\\" New York Times critic A. O. Scott observes that Chigurh, Moss, and Bell each \\"occupy the screen one at a time, almost never appearing in the frame together, even as their fates become ever more intimately entwined.\\" Variety critic Todd McCarthy describes Chigurh's modus operandi: \\"Death walks hand in hand with Chigurh wherever he goes, unless he decides otherwise ... [I]f everything you've done in your life has led you to him, he may explain to his about-to-be victims, your time might just have come. 'You don't have to do this,' the innocent invariably insist to a man whose murderous code dictates otherwise. Occasionally, however, he will allow someone to decide his own fate by coin toss, notably in a tense early scene in an old filling station marbled with nervous humor.\\" Jim Emerson describes how the Coens introduced Chigurh in one of the first scenes when he strangles the deputy who arrested him: \\"A killer rises: Our first blurred sight of Chigurh's face ... As he moves forward, into focus, to make his first kill, we still don't get a good look at him because his head rises above the top of the frame. His victim, the deputy, never sees what's coming, and Chigurh, chillingly, doesn't even bother to look at his face while he garrotes him.\\" Critic Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian stated that \\"the savoury, serio- comic tang of the Coens' film-making style is recognisably present, as is their predilection for the weirdness of hotels and motels\\". But he added that they \\"have found something that has heightened and deepened their identity as film-makers: a real sense of seriousness, a sense that their offbeat Americana and gruesome and surreal comic contortions can really be more than the sum of their parts\\". Geoff Andrew of Time Out London said that the Coens \\"find a cinematic equivalent to McCarthy's language: his narrative ellipses, play with point of view, and structural concerns such as the exploration of the similarities and differences between Moss, Chigurh and Bell. Certain virtuoso sequences feel near-abstract in their focus on objects, sounds, light, colour or camera angle rather than on human presence ... Notwithstanding much marvellous deadpan humour, this is one of their darkest efforts.\\" Arne De Boever believes that there is a \\"close affinity, and intimacy even, between the sheriff and Chigurh in No Country for Old Men [which is developed] in a number of scenes. There is, to begin with, the sheriff's voice at the beginning of the film, which accompanies the images of Chigurh's arrest. This initial weaving together of the figures of Chigurh and the sheriff is further developed later on in the film, when the sheriff visits Llewelyn Moss' trailer home in search for Moss and his wife, Carla Jean. Chigurh has visited the trailer only minutes before, and the Coen brothers have the sheriff sit down in the same exact spot where Chigurh had been sitting (which is almost the exact same spot where, the evening before, Moss joined his wife on the couch). Like Chigurh, the sheriff sees himself reflected in the dark glass of Moss' television, their mirror images perfectly overlapping if one were to superimpose these two shots. When the sheriff pours himself a glass of milk from the bottle that stands sweating on the living room table—a sign that the sheriff and his colleague, deputy Wendell (Garret Dillahunt), only just missed their man—this mirroring of images goes beyond the level of reflection, and Chigurh enters into the sheriff's constitution, thus further undermining any easy opposition of Chigurh and the sheriff, and instead exposing a certain affinity, intimacy, or similarity even between both.\\" = Depicted violence = In an interview with Charlie Rose, co-director Joel Coen acknowledged that \\"there's a lot of violence in the book,\\" and considered the violence depicted in the film as \\"very important to the story\\". He further added that \\"we couldn't conceive it, sort of soft pedaling that in the movie, and really doing a thing resembling the book ... it's about a character confronting a very arbitrary violent brutal world, and you have to see that.\\" Los Angeles Times critic Kenneth Turan commented on the violence depicted in the film: \\"The Coen brothers dropped the mask. They've put violence on screen before, lots of it, but not like this. Not anything like this. No Country for Old Men doesn't celebrate or smile at violence; it despairs of it.\\" However, Turan explained that \\"no one should see No Country for Old Men underestimating the intensity of its violence. But it's also clear that the Coen brothers and McCarthy are not interested in violence for its own sake, but for what it says about the world we live in ... As the film begins, a confident deputy says I got it under control, and in moments he is dead. He didn't have anywhere near the mastery he imagined. And in this despairing vision, neither does anyone else.\\" NPR critic Bob Mondello adds that \\"despite working with a plot about implacable malice, the Coen Brothers don't ever overdo. You could even say they know the value of understatement: At one point they garner chills simply by having a character check the soles of his boots as he steps from a doorway into the sunlight. By that time, blood has pooled often enough in No Country for Old Men that they don't have to show you what he's checking for.\\" Critic Stephanie Zacharek of Salon states that \\"this adaptation of Cormac McCarthy's novel touches on brutal themes, but never really gets its hands dirty. The movie's violence isn't pulpy and visceral, the kind of thing that hits like a fist; it's brutal, and rather relentless, but there are still several layers of comfortable distance between it and us. At one point a character lifts his cowboy boot, daintily, so it won't be mussed by the pool of blood gathering at his feet ... The Coens have often used cruel violence to make their points – that's nothing new – but putting that violence to work in the service of allegedly deep themes isn't the same as actually getting your hands dirty. No Country for Old Men feels less like a breathing, thinking movie than an exercise. That may be partly because it's an adaptation of a book by a contemporary author who's usually spoken of in hushed, respectful, hat-in-hand tones, as if he were a schoolmarm who'd finally brought some sense and order to a lawless town.\\" Ryan P. Doom explains how the violence devolves as the film progresses. \\"The savagery of American violence,\\" he says, \\"begins with Chigurh's introduction: a quick one-two punch of strangulation and a bloody cattle gun. The strangulation in particular demonstrates the level of the Coens' capability to create realistic carnage-to allow the audience to understand the horror that violence delivers. ... .Chigurh kills a total of 12 (possibly more) people, and, curiously enough, the violence devolves as the film progresses. During the first half of the film, the Coens never shy from unleashing Chigurh ... The devolution of violence starts with Chigurh's shootout with Moss in the motel. Aside from the truck owner who is shot in the head after Moss flags him down, both the motel clerk and Wells's death occur offscreen. Wells's death in particular demonstrates that murder means nothing. Calm beyond comfort, the camera pans away when Chigurh shoots Wells with a silenced shotgun as the phone rings. He answers. It is Moss, and while they talk, blood oozes across the room toward Chigurh's feet. Not moving, he places his feet up on the bed and continues the conversation as the blood continues to spread across the floor. By the time he keeps his promise of visiting Carla Jean, the resolution and the violence appear incomplete. Though we're not shown Carla Jean's death, when Chigurh exits and checks the bottom of his socks [boots] for blood, it's a clear indication that his brand of violence has struck again.\\"Doom, Ryan P. (2009), Chapter 12: \\"The Unrelenting Country: 'No Country for Old Men (2007)'\\", p. 153. = Similarities to earlier Coen brothers films = Richard Gillmore states that \\"the previous Coen brothers movie that has the most in common with No Country for Old Men is, in fact, Fargo (1996). In Fargo there is an older, wiser police chief, Marge Gunderson (Frances McDormand) just as there is in No Country for Old Men. In both movies, a local police officer is confronted with some grisly murders committed by men who are not from his or her town. In both movies, greed lies behind the plots. Both movies feature as a central character a cold-blooded killer who does not seem quite human and whom the police officer seeks to apprehend.\\" Joel Coen seems to agree. In an interview with David Gritten of The Daily Telegraph, Gritten states that \\"overall [the film] seems to belong in a rarefied category of Coen films occupied only by Fargo (1996), which ... is also a crime story with a decent small-town sheriff as its central character. Joel sighs. 'I know. There are parallels.' He shakes his head. 'These things really should seem obvious to us.'\\" In addition, Ethan Coen states that \\"we're not conscious of it, [and] to the extent that we are, we try to avoid it. The similarity to Fargo did occur to us, not that it was a good or a bad thing. That's the only thing that comes to mind as being reminiscent of our own movies, [and] it is by accident.\\" Richard Corliss of Time magazine adds that \\"there's also Tommy Lee Jones playing a cop as righteous as Marge in Fargo\\", while Paul Arendt of the BBC stated that the film transplants the \\"despairing nihilism and tar-black humour of Fargo to the arid plains of Blood Simple.\\" Some critics have also identified similarities between No Country for Old Men and the Coens' previous film Raising Arizona, namely the commonalities shared by Anton Chigurh and the fellow bounty hunter Leonard Smalls.  Genre  Although Paul Arendt of the BBC finds that \\"No Country ... can be enjoyed as a straightforward genre thriller\\" with \\"suspense sequences ... that rival the best of Hitchcock\\", in other respects the film can be described as a western, and the question remains unsettled. For Richard Gillmore, it \\"is, and is not, a western. It takes place in the West and its main protagonists are what you might call westerners. On the other hand, the plot revolves around a drug deal that has gone bad; it involves four-wheel- drive vehicles, semiautomatic weapons, and executives in high-rise buildings, none of which would seem to belong in a western.\\" William J. Devlin finesses the point, calling the film a \\"neo-western\\", distinguishing it from the classic western by the way it \\"demonstrates a decline, or decay, of the traditional western ideal ... The moral framework of the West ... that contained ... innocent and wholesome heroes who fought for what is right, is fading. The villains, or the criminals, act in such a way that the traditional hero cannot make sense of their criminal behavior.\\"McMahon; Csaki (2010), Part 3, Chapter: No Country for Old Men: The Decline of Ethics and the West(ern), pp. 221–240, by Devlin, William J. Deborah Biancott sees a \\"western gothic ..., a struggle for and with God, an examination of a humanity haunted by its past and condemned to the horrors of its future. ... [I]t's a tale of unrepentant evil, the frightening but compelling bad guy who lives by a moral code that is unrecognizable and alien. The wanderer, the psychopath, Anton Chigurh, is a man who's supernaturally invincible.\\"Chapter 43: \\"Cormac McCarthy's No Country for Old Men: Western Gothic\\", pp. 465–466, by Biancott, Deborah in Even the directors have weighed in. Joel Coen found the film \\"interesting in a genre way; but it was also interesting to us because it subverts the genre expectations.\\"Monaco, Paul (2010), Chapter 16: \\"Hollywood Enters The Twenty-First Century\\", p. 329. He did not consider the film a western because \\"when we think about westerns we think about horses and six- guns, saloons and hitching posts.\\" But co-director Ethan said that the film \\"is sort of a western,\\" before adding \\"and sort of not.\\" Gillmore, though, thinks that it is \\"a mixing of the two great American movie genres, the western and film noir,\\" which \\"reflect the two sides of the American psyche. On the one hand, there is a western in which the westerner is faced with overwhelming odds, but between his perseverance and his skill, he overcomes the odds and triumphs. ... In film noir, on the other hand, the hero is smart (more or less) and wily and there are many obstacles to overcome, the odds are against him, and, in fact, he fails to overcome them. ... This genre reflects the pessimism and fatalism of the American psyche. With No Country for Old Men, the Coens combine these two genres into one movie. It is a western with a tragic, existential, film noir ending.\\"  Themes and analysis  One of the themes in the story involves the tension between destiny and self- determination. According to Richard Gillmore, the main characters are torn between a sense of inevitability, \\"that the world goes on its way and that it does not have much to do with human desires and concerns\\", and the notion that our futures are inextricably connected to our own past actions.Conard, Mark T. (2009), The Philosophy of the Coen Brothers, Part 1, Chapter: \\"No Country for Old Men: The Coens' Tragic Western\\", by Gillmore, Richard. Enda McCaffrey details a character who refuses to acknowledge his own agency, noting that Anton Chigurh (Javier Bardem) ignores repeated reminders that he doesn't have to behave as he does and suggesting that by relegating the lives of Carla and the gas station clerk to a coin toss, he hands \\"responsibility over to 'fate' in an act of bad faith that prevents him from taking responsibility for his own ethical choices.\\"Boule'; McCaffrey. (2011), Chapter 8: Crimes of Passion, Freedom and a Clash of Sartrean Moralities in the Coen Brothers' No Country for Old Men, by McCaffrey, Enda, p. 131-138 Llewelyn Moss (Josh Brolin) wavers between immoral behavior such as taking money that doesn't belong to him, refusing to involve the police and placing his family in grave danger, and moral acts of courage such as returning to the scene of the shootout to give a dying man water, separating himself from his family and refusing the advances of a comely woman at a motel demonstrating a flexibility of principle, as well as desire to escape consequences and a fierce will to survive at all costs. Anton Chigurh is the most amoral, killing those who stand in his way and ruling that a coin toss decides others' fate. The third man, Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, believes himself to be moral, but feels overmatched, however stalwart he might personally be, against the depravity that surrounds and threatens to overwhelm him. Not only behavior, but position alters. One of the themes developed in the story is the shifting identity of hunter and hunted. Scott Foundas stresses that everyone in the film plays both roles, while Judie Newman focuses on the moments of transition, when hunter Llewelyn Moss and investigator Wells become themselves targets.Newman, Judie (2007), Chapter 6: 'Southern apes: McCarthy's neotenous killers', p. 142. The story contrasts old narratives of the \\"Wild West\\" with modern crimes, suggesting that the heroes of old can at best hope to escape from rather than to triumph over evil. William J. Devlin explores the narrative of Sheriff Ed Tom Bell, an aging Western hero, symbolic of an older tradition, who does not serve an underpopulated \\"Wild West\\", but an evolved landscape with new breeds of crime which baffle him.McMahon; Csaki (2010), Part 3, Chapter: No Country for Old Men: The Decline of Ethics and the West(ern), p. 221-240, by Devlin, William J. William Luhr focuses on the perspective of the retiring lawman played by Tommy Lee Jones at the beginning of the film, who is withdrawing from an evil which he cannot understand or address, reflecting the film's millennial worldview with \\"no hope for a viable future, only the remote possibility of individual detachment from it all.\\"Luhr, William (2012), p. 211  Release  = Theatrical release and box office = Javier Bardem (left) with the Coen brothers at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival. No Country for Old Men premiered in competition at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival on May 19. Stephen Robb of the BBC covered the film opening at Cannes. \\"With no sign yet of an undisputed classic in competition at this 60th Cannes,\\" he said, \\"No Country for Old Men may have emerged as a frontrunner for the trophy Joel and Ethan Coen collected for Barton Fink in 1991. 'We are very fortunate in that our films have sort of found a home here,' says Joel. 'From the point of view of getting the movies out to an audience, this has always been a very congenial platform.' It commercially opened in limited release in 28 theaters in the United States on November 9, 2007, grossing $1,226,333 over the opening weekend, and opened in the United Kingdom (limited release) and Ireland on January 18, 2008. It became the biggest box-office hit for the Coen brothers to date, grossing more than $170 million worldwide, until it was surpassed by True Grit in 2010. The reception to the film's first press screening in Cannes was positive. Screen Internationals jury of critics, assembled for its daily Cannes publication, all gave the film three or four marks out of four. The magazine's review said the film fell short of 'the greatness that sometimes seems within its grasp'. But it added that the film was 'guaranteed to attract a healthy audience on the basis of the track record of those involved, respect for the novel and critical support.'\\" The film commercially opened in limited release in 28 theaters in the United States on November 9, 2007, grossing $1,226,333 over the opening weekend. The film expanded to a wide release in 860 theaters in the United States on November 21, 2007, grossing $7,776,773 over the first weekend. The film subsequently increased the number of theaters to 2,037. It was the 5th highest ranking film at the US box office in the weekend ending December 16, 2007. The film opened in Australia on December 26, 2007, and in the United Kingdom (limited release) and Ireland on January 18, 2008. As of February 13, 2009, the film had grossed $74,283,000 domestically (United States). No Country for Old Men became the biggest box-office hit for the Coens to date, until it was surpassed by True Grit in 2010. No Country for Old Men is the third-lowest-grossing Oscar winner, only surpassing Crash (2005) and The Hurt Locker (2009). \\"The final balance sheet was a $74 million gross\\" domestically. Miramax employed its typical 'gradual-release' strategy: it was \\"released in November, ... was initially given a limited release, ... and ... benefited from the nomination and the win, with weekend grosses picking up after each.\\" By contrast, the previous year's winner, The Departed was a \\"Best Picture winner with the time series chart that is typical of Hollywood blockbusters – a big opening weekend followed by a steady decline.\\" = Home media = Buena Vista Home Entertainment released the film on DVD and in the high definition Blu-ray format on March 11, 2008 in the US. The only extras are three behind-the-scenes featurettes. The release topped the home video rental charts upon release and remained in the top 10 positions for the first 5 weeks. Website Blu-ray.com reviewed the Blu-ray edition of the film, and gave the video quality an almost full mark. It stated that \\"with its AVC MPEG-4 video on BD-50, the picture quality of No Country for Old Men stands on the highest rung of the home video ladder. Color vibrancy, black level, resolution and contrast are reference quality ... Every line and wrinkle in Bell's face is resolved and Chigurh sports a pageboy haircut in which every strand of hair appears individually distinguishable. No other film brings its characters to life so vividly solely on the merits of visual technicalities ... Watch the nighttime shoot-out between Moss and Chigurh outside the hotel ... As bullets slam through the windshield of Moss's getaway car, watch as every crack and bullet hole in the glass is extraordinarily defined.\\" The audio quality earned an almost full mark, where the \\"24-bit 48 kHz lossless PCM serves voices well, and excels in more treble-prone sounds ... Perhaps the most audibly dynamic sequence is the dawn chase scene after Moss returns with water. Close your eyes and listen to Moss's breathing and footsteps as he runs, the truck in pursuit as it labors over rocks and shrubs, the crack of the rifle and hissing of bullets as they rip through the air and hit the ground ... the entire sequence and the film overall sounds very convincing.\\" Kenneth S. Brown of website High-Def Digest stated that \\"the Blu-ray edition of the film ... is magnificent ... and includes all of the 480i/p special features that appear on the standard DVD. However, to my disappointment, the slim supplemental package doesn't include a much needed directors' commentary from the Coens. It would have been fascinating to listen to the brothers dissect the differences between the original novel and the Oscar-winning film. It may not have a compelling supplemental package, but it does have a striking video transfer and an excellent PCM audio track.\\" The Region 2 DVD (Paramount) was released on June 2, 2008. The film was released on Blu-ray Disc in the UK on September 8, 2008. A 3-disc special edition with a digital copy was released on DVD and Blu-ray on April 7, 2009. It was presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen and Dolby Digital 5.1 (English, Spanish). This release included over five hours of new bonus features although it lacks deleted scenes and audio commentary. Some of the bonus material/features on the disc include documentaries about the production and working with the Coens, a featurette made by Brolin, the featurette \\"Diary of a Country Sheriff\\" which considers the lead characters and the subtext they form, a Q&A; discussion with the crew hosted by Spike Jonze, and a variety of interviews with the cast and the Coens from EW.com Just a Minute, ABC Popcorn with Peter Travers, and an installment of Charlie Rose.  Reception  Javier Bardem received critical acclaim for his role as Anton Chigurh. On the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 93% based on reviews from 284 critics, with an average rating of 8.74/10. The website's critical consensus reads, \\"Bolstered by powerful lead performances from Javier Bardem, Josh Brolin, and Tommy Lee Jones, No Country for Old Men finds the Coen brothers spinning cinematic gold out of Cormac McCarthy's grim, darkly funny novel.\\" The film also holds a rating of 91/100 on Metacritic, based on 37 reviews, indicating \\"universal acclaim\\". Upon release, the film was widely discussed as a possible candidate for several Oscars, before going on to receive eight nominations, and eventually winning four in 2008. Javier Bardem, in particular, has received considerable praise for his performance in the film. Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian called it \\"the best of the [Coens'] career so far\\". Rob Mackie of The Guardian also said that \\"what makes this such a stand-out is hard to put your finger on – it just feels like an absorbing and tense two hours where everyone is absolutely on top of their job and a comfortable fit in their roles.\\" Geoff Andrew of Time Out London expressed that \\"the film exerts a grip from start to end\\". Richard Corliss of Time magazine chose the film as the best of the year and said that \\"after two decades of being brilliant on the movie margins, the Coens are ready for their closeup, and maybe their Oscar\\". Paul Arendt of the BBC gave the film a full mark and said that it \\"doesn't require a defense: it is a magnificent return to form\\". A. O. Scott of The New York Times stated that \\"for formalists – those moviegoers sent into raptures by tight editing, nimble camera work and faultless sound design – it's pure heaven.\\" Both Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton from the ABC show At The Movies gave the film five stars, making No Country for Old Men the only film to receive such a rating from the hosts in 2007. Both praised the film for its visual language and suspense, David commenting that \\"Hitchcock wouldn't have done the suspense better\\". Occasional disapproval was voiced, with some critics noting the absence of a \\"central character\\" and \\"climactic scene\\"; its \\"disappointing finish\\" and \\"dependen[ce] on an arbitrarily manipulated plot\\"; or a general lack of \\"soul\\" and sense of \\"hopelessness\\". Sukhdev Sandhu of The Daily Telegraph argued that \\"Chigurh never develops as a character ... with material as strong as this, one would think they could do better than impute to him a sprawling inscrutability, a mystery that is merely pathological.\\" He further accused it of being full of \\"pseudo profundities in which [the Coen brothers] have always specialised.\\" In The Washington Post, Stephen Hunter criticized Chigurh's weapons as unintentionally humorous and lamented, \\"It's all chase, which means that it offers almost zero in character development. Each of the figures is given, a la standard thriller operating procedure, a single moral or psychological attribute and then acts in accordance to that principle and nothing else, without doubts, contradictions or ambivalence.\\" = Accolades = No Country for Old Men was nominated for eight Academy Awards and won four, including Best Picture. Additionally, Javier Bardem won Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role; the Coen brothers won Achievement in Directing (Best Director) and Best Adapted Screenplay. Other nominations included Best Film Editing (the Coen brothers as Roderick Jaynes), Best Cinematography (Roger Deakins), Best Sound Editing and Best Sound Mixing. Javier Bardem became the first Spanish actor to win an Oscar. \\"Thank you to the Coens for being crazy enough to think I could do that and put one of the most horrible hair cuts in history on my head,\\" Bardem said in his acceptance speech at the 80th Academy Awards. He dedicated the award to Spain and to his mother, actress Pilar Bardem, who accompanied him to the ceremony. While accepting the award for Best Director at the 80th Academy Awards, Joel Coen said that \\"Ethan and I have been making stories with movie cameras since we were kids\\", recalling a Super 8 film they made titled \\"Henry Kissinger: Man on the Go\\". \\"Honestly,\\" he said, \\"what we do now doesn't feel that much different from what we were doing then. We're very thankful to all of you out there for continuing to let us play in our corner of the sandbox.\\" It was only the second time in Oscar history that two individuals shared the directing honor (Robert Wise and Jerome Robbins were the first, winning for 1961's West Side Story). The film was nominated for four Golden Globe Awards, winning two at the 65th Golden Globe Awards. Javier Bardem won Best Performance by an Actor in a Supporting Role in a Motion Picture and the Coen brothers won Best Screenplay – Motion Picture. The film was also nominated for Best Motion Picture – Drama, and Best Director (Ethan Coen and Joel Coen). Earlier in 2007 it was nominated for the Palme d'Or at the Cannes Film Festival. The Screen Actors Guild gave a nomination nod to the cast for its \\"Outstanding Performance\\". The film won top honors at the Directors Guild of America Awards for Joel and Ethan Coen. The film was nominated for nine BAFTAs in 2008 and won in three categories; Joel and Ethan Coen winning the award for Best Director, Roger Deakins winning for Best Cinematography and Javier Bardem winning for Best Supporting Actor. It has also been awarded the David di Donatello for Best Foreign Film. No Country for Old Men received recognition from numerous North American critics' associations (New York Film Critics Circle, Toronto Film Critics Association, Washington D.C. Area Film Critics Association, National Board of Review, New York Film Critics Online, Chicago Film Critics Association, Boston Society of Film Critics, Austin Film Critics Association, and San Diego Film Critics Society). The American Film Institute listed it as an AFI Movie of the Year for 2007, and the Australian Film Critics Association and Houston Film Critics Society both voted it best film of 2007. The film appeared on more critics' top ten lists (354) than any other film of 2007, and was more critics' No. 1 film (90) than any other.  Disputes  In September 2008, Tommy Lee Jones sued Paramount for bonuses and improper expense deductions. The matter was resolved in April 2010, with the company forced to pay Jones a $17.5 million box office bonus after a determination that his deal was misdrafted by studio attorneys, who settled with Paramount for $2.6 million over that error.

He is of Chinese descent. He studied at the Colegio San Andrés (Anglo-Peruvian School). He was also a commissioner on the Truth and Reconciliation Commission that investigated abuses by the Shining Path, Túpac Amaru Revolutionary Movement, and the Military of Peru during the 1980s and 1990s. He was a Congressman representing Lima for the 2011–2016 term. From 1953 to 1957 he studied at the Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería and received an architecture degree. He started his professional career in his family's import business. Clerical activity From 1979 on Lay was an important pastor in Alianza Cristiana y Misionera Church, whose largest temples he designed, thanks to his profession. Later, in October 1987, he founded the Iglesia Bíblica Emmanuel in Lima, capital of Peru. Since then, this Christian church has developed successfully, and Pastor Lay has got a top position among the Christian leaders and pastors in Perú. This church works with young people, families and is a well-known missionary church. Lay is the president of Unión Nacional de Iglesias Cristianas Evangélicas del Perú - UNICEP. He is also a member of the Fraternidad Internacional de Pastores Cristianos - FIPAC. After the downfall of Alberto Fujimori's dictatorial regime in 2001, Lay was active in the National Anti-corruption Initiative and Commission of Truth and National Reconciliation. Humberto Lay is a well-respected leader in the Christian evangelical world in Peru and abroad. Iglesia Biblica Emmanuel, which he founded in October 1987, is one of the most important churches in Peru and has many churches in several cities of Peru. Lay left his position as main pastor at that church when he entered political life, and left his position to Ps. Saúl Gutiérrez, who is since then the main pastor. Political career In November 2005, Lay founded the National Restoration party, a rally of socially conservative evangelicals, which he has chaired ever since. Although Humberto Lay Sun ran unsuccessfully for president in the 2006 elections on the National Restoration ticket, obtaining 4.38% of the valid votes, the top political leaders in Peru have taken in count as he represents an important electoral base of evangelical Christians in Peru. For the 2011 general elections, Lay integrated his National Restoration into the Alliance for the Great Change of Pedro Pablo Kuczynski and was elected Congressman for this group, as the only member of his party, and as the eldest lawmaker in the 2011–2016 congressional period.

Originally classed as AM4 units, they later became Class 304 under the TOPS numbering system, and could be found in operation over most of the West Coast Main Line. The units conformed to the 1959-design for alternating current (AC) electrical multiple units, and were externally very similar to the Class 305, Class 308 and the 1,200 V direct current (DC) Class 504 units. No units survived into preservation, and all units were eventually scrapped. Description The first fifteen units were delivered to Longsight Depot, Manchester from April 1960 as four-car sets, and were originally numbered 001-015. Built by British Rail's Wolverton Works, these units were an aesthetic improvement over the AM2 (Class 302) units previously built at York and Doncaster; they featured a new design cab end with a raked back upper area, following a Design Panel recommendation, and emerged in Multiple Unit Green livery, lined out with yellow. The units followed the two-car 1,200 V DC Class 504 units off the production line at Wolverton, a class which shared many design features with the first AM4 units. The units were arranged into four-car sets, consisting of: a Driving Trailer Brake Open vehicle with 82 second class seats (saloon) and a Guard's compartment; a Trailer Composite with 19 first class seats (compartment) and 60 second class seats (saloon), and two toilets; a Motor Brake with 96 second class seats (compartment) and a Guard's compartment; a Driving Trailer with 82 second class seats (saloon), two toilets, and battery equipment. One result of the Motor Brake vehicle having a compartment design was that the window layout on all vehicles was designed to suit, having a narrow window either side of each door. The units were tested on the Styal line prior to the start of electric services between Crewe and Manchester. A further twenty units followed in 1961, numbered 016-035 and intended for the Crewe-Liverpool service which commenced on New Year's Day 1962, although as this local service only required three or four units daily they were principally used elsewhere, for services around Manchester and Birmingham. These units differed from the first batch by having a slightly different body design, with wide saloon windows replacing the narrow compartment-style windows. The Motor Brake vehicles had a different internal layout, with 72 second class seats in saloon layout. This improved layout was adopted for the final batch of AM4s, as well as later batches of AM5 (Class 305) units and AM8 (Class 308) units. Some of this second batch were loaned temporarily to the Eastern Region for use between Liverpool Street and Shenfield/Southend-on-Sea during the conversion of this route from 1,500 V DC to 6.25 kV/25 kV AC, while Class 306 and Class 307 units were being rebuilt. Some of the second batch of 304s were also used on the services from Liverpool Street to Hertford East and Bishops Stortford in the mid-1960s. The third and final batch of AM4 was another ten units, numbered 036-045, which were almost identical to the second batch and intended for use on the Crewe-Stafford section. Surprisingly, the AM4s were the only AC units of the 1959 design to wear the lined-out version of Multiple Unit Green livery, with Classes 305 and 308 emerging in comparatively drab plain green. This pleasant appearance was lost, however, when repainted into all-over Rail Blue. The units spent their whole careers operating between Crewe and Altrincham via Stockport or Styal and Manchester, Crewe and Liverpool, Crewe and Birmingham, and Birmingham - Rugby - Northampton. Units were occasionally operated to London Euston (notably at the very beginning of electric services, before all the AM10 units were delivered) or Preston, but only rarely. Because of their operation on much of the West Coast main line, the units attained substantial mileage at their 75 mph maximum speed each day on their workings, unlike those employed on suburban services elsewhere. Refurbishment In the early 1980s, a refurbishment programme was carried out on the units. This included the removal and scrapping of the Trailer Composite vehicles, reducing the units to three-car formation, and the conversion of the Motor Brake vehicles of the first batch (Class 304/1) to saloon layout, reducing seating capacity to 72. Unlike other EMU refurbishment programmes, the work carried out on Class 304 units did not include the fitting of inter-vehicle gangways, or the complete replacement of internal fittings. This meant that original 1960s seats and trim remained in most vehicles, retaining something of their original character. The units were also repainted into blue and grey livery. The loss of one vehicle meant that the power-to-weight ratio of the units increased, thereby improving their performance. Decline In the 1980s the units gradually received the Class '304' TOPS prefix to their unit numbers, and by 1992 several later series units had even received Regional Railways livery. By this time, however, more recently refurbished units had become available, displaced from the London, Tilbury and Southend Railway by Class 317s, and with the imminent arrival of brand new Class 323s, the Class 304s began to be withdrawn. The end came in March 1996 when 304002 and 304033 ran a series of farewell specials in Birmingham. Known amongst enthusiasts as \\"Dinosaurs\\", due to their advancing age, Class 304s followed their namesakes to extinction. Preservation attempts 304021 was purchased for preservation in 1998 and was stored in sidings in Crewe. During this time, many windows were smashed, which, as a consequence of the cost of replacing them, led to the abandonment of the project. The long period of storage was due to the difficulty in finding a home on a preserved railway for EMU coaching stock, and so it became the last of its class to be scrapped in November 2000.

Under the pre-1973 British Rail numbering system, the class was known as AM5. When TOPS was introduced, the class became Class 305. Sub classes Class 305 had three sub classes: *305/1 3-car units, standard class accommodation only, built in 1960 *305/2 4-car units, first and standard class accommodation, built in 1959 *305/9 3-car unit, non-passenger departmental conversion, converted 1984 Operations 305/1 units were generally deployed on inner suburban services on the Lea Valley lines out of London Liverpool Street to Chingford, Enfield Town and Hertford East. They mainly worked the Chingford and Enfield branches, where their average scheduled speed was . However, they were also used on the Great Eastern lines out of London Liverpool Street and occasionally worked out of their ‘normal’ operating area when coupled to a 305/2 unit or any of the compatible EMUs in use at the time. These units were distinguished by their lower backed seating. 305/1 units were replaced from 1980 onwards by British Rail Class 315 units. They were not generally used elsewhere, but a small number of units, are believed to have operated around Manchester for a brief period in the mid 1990s. All examples of the sub class were scrapped. 305/2 units were generally deployed on outer suburban services on the Lea Valley Line out of London Liverpool Street to Bishops Stortford (the extent of electrification until 1987), where their average scheduled speed was . Like the 305/1 units, they could occasionally be seen on other services out of Liverpool Street and were sometimes coupled to other compatible EMUs for multiple working.

The unit was later used in East Anglia as part of the Great Eastern electrification and was deployed at Ipswich, Harwich and Cambridge. The 305/2s were refurbished in the mid-late 1980s. As with the 308s, this involved moving first class to a driving trailer, new interior panels, new seats and fluorescent lights. The 305/2s were initially replaced on the Lea Valley Line by British Rail Class 310 units during the late 1980s/early 1990s. Most of the 305/2s were overhauled at Doncaster, painted in Regional Railways livery and shortened to 3-car sets, before moving to the Manchester area, taking over services previously diagrammed by Class 304 units. A handful were further repainted into Greater Manchester PTE livery, some regaining their TSO trailer and receiving additional luggage racks dedicated to the new Manchester Airport services. Once class 323 units were in service, the 305s were gradually withdrawn, but a few retained on Hadfield services until track alignment was performed in 1997, allowing the longer bodied Class 323's to negotiate the sharp curves at Dinting station. The surviving units also occasionally turned up on other local services around Manchester, with the last 305 to work out of Stoke-on- Trent believed to be 305506 on 22 May 2000 on the 20:57 to Manchester. 5 (305501-502, 508, 517 and 519) moved to Glasgow Shields depot retaining their 4-car configuration, finishing their working lives running the route from Edinburgh Waverley to North Berwick.

The commissioners were authorized to determine the distribution of revenues of the Church of England, and they made extensive changes in how revenues were distributed. The modern successor body thereof are the Church Commissioners. History Their appointment was one of the results of the vigorous movements for the reform of public institutions which followed the Reform Act of 1832. In 1835 two commissions were appointed to consider the state of the several dioceses of England and Wales, with reference to the amount of their revenues and the more equal distribution of episcopal duties, and the prevention of the necessity of attaching by commendam to bishoprics certain benefices with cure of souls; and to consider also the state of the several cathedral and collegiate churches in England and Wales, with a view to the suggestion of such measures as might render them conducive to the efficiency of the established church, and to provide for the best mode of providing for the cure of souls, with special reference to the residence of the clergy on their respective benefices. And it was enacted by an act of 1835 that during the existence of the commission the profits of dignities and benefices without cure of souls becoming vacant should be paid over to the treasurer of Queen Anne's Bounty. In consequence of the recommendation of these commissioners, a permanent commission was appointed by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners Act 1836 for the purpose of preparing and laying before the king in council such schemes as should appear to them to be best adapted for carrying into effect the alterations suggested in the report of the original commission and recited in the act. The new commission was constituted a corporation with power to purchase and hold lands for the purposes of the act, notwithstanding the statutes of mortmain. The first members of the commission were the Archbishop of Canterbury, the Archbishop of York, and three bishops, the Lord Chancellor and the principal officers of state, and three laymen named in the act. The constitution of the commission was amended by the Ecclesiastical Commissioners Act 1840 and subsequent acts, and now consists of the two archbishops, all the bishops, the deans of Canterbury, St Paul, and Westminster, the Lord Chancellor, the Lord President of the Council, the First Lord of the Treasury, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, the Home Secretary, the Lord Chief Justice, the Master of the Rolls, two judges of the admiralty division, and certain laymen appointed by the crown and by the archbishop of Canterbury. The lay commissioners are required to be members of the Church of England, and to subscribe a declaration to that effect. The crown also appoints two laymen as church estates commissioners, and the archbishop of Canterbury one. These three are the joint treasurers of the commission, and constitute, along with two members appointed by the commission; the church estates committee, charged with all business relating to the sale, purchase, exchange, letting or management of any lands, tithes or hereditaments. The commission has power to make inquiries and examine witnesses on oath. Five commissioners are a quorum for the transaction of business, provided two of them are church estates commissioners; two ecclesiastical commissioners at least must be present at any proceeding under the common seal, and if only two are present they can demand its postponement to a subsequent meeting. The schemes of the commission having, after due notice to persons affected thereby, been laid before the king in council, may be ratified by orders, specifying the times when they shall take effect, and such orders when published in the London Gazette have the same force and effect as acts of parliament. The recommendations of the commission recited in the act of 1836 are too numerous to be given here. They include an extensive rearrangement of the dioceses, equalization of episcopal income, providing residences, etc. By the act of 1840 the fourth report of the original commissioners, dealing chiefly with cathedral and collegiate churches, was carried into effect, a large number of canonries being suspended, and sinecure benefices and dignities suppressed. The emoluments of these suppressed or suspended offices, and the surplus income of the episcopal sees, constitute the fund at the disposal of the commissioners. By an act of 1860, on the avoidance of any bishopric or archbishopric, all the land and emoluments of the see, except the patronage and lands attached to houses of residence, become, by order in council, vested in the commissioners, who may, however, reassign to the see so much of the land as may be sufficient to secure the net annual income named for it by statute or order. All the profits and emoluments of the suspended canonries, etc., pass over to the commissioners, as well as the separate estates of those deaneries and canonries which are not suspended. Out of this fund the expenses of the commission are to be paid, and the residue is to be devoted to increasing the efficiency of the church by the augmentation of the smaller bishoprics and of poor livings, the endowment of new churches, and employment of additional ministers. The substitution of one central corporation for the many local and independent corporations of the church, so far at least as the management of property is concerned, was a constitutional change of great importance, and the effect of it undoubtedly was to correct the anomalous distribution of ecclesiastical revenues by equalising incomes and abolishing sinecures. At the same time it was regarded as having made a serious breach in the legal theory of ecclesiastical property. The important principle, says Crippe, on which the inviolability of the church establishment depends, that the church generally possesses no property as a corporation, or which is applicable to general purposes, but that such particular ecclesiastical corporation, whether aggregate or sole, has its property separate, distinct and inalienable, according to the intention of the original endowment, was given up without an effort to defend it.

Biography  Playfair was born in Benvie near Dundee, where his father was the parish minister. He was the brother of William Playfair the engineer, and the mathematician John Playfair. His son, William Henry Playfair (1790–1857), was also a celebrated architect, responsible for many of the buildings in Edinburgh’s New Town. James Playfair's works include Melville Castle in Midlothian, Kirriemuir and the Glens Old Parish Church, Kirriemuir (1786-88). His most famous building is Cairness House (1791–1797), in Aberdeenshire, which used revolutionary forms of neoclassicism, and is unique in British architecture of the period. Cairness House shows the influence of the French architects Étienne-Louis Boullée and Claude Nicholas Ledoux, and is also notable for having the earliest complete Egyptian room in Britain. On his death in 1794, most of Playfair’s papers were bought by his close friend Sir John Soane and are now housed at Sir John Soane's Museum in London.

In games that use a paper doll inventory management system, the sprites or 3D models of equipment, such as clothing or armour, can be placed on top of an image of the player character. This is similar to how the paper cut-outs of real-world paper dolls are used. The innovative and very successful Dungeon Master popularized the paper doll interface. Using a paper doll inventory system is either done by dragging equipment in place, or by selecting them from a list. In games with multiple main characters, the different player characters are usually shown posing the same way. In some cases, there are multiple poses for the characters. For example, there may one unique pose when a one-handed weapon is equipped, and another when a two- handed weapon is equipped. Typically, the paper dolls are a separate part of the inventory management. Sometimes, however, the in-game character sprite or model itself acts as a paper doll on which equipment can be put; an example of this would be Ultima IX: Ascension. Use The paper doll-approach of inventory management is useful when a game makes a distinction between different parts of a character's body in combat. It has also been cited to feel more realistic to place armour manually on one's character. On the other hand, a paper doll inventory requires a large interface, as it has to show the entire character.

Although periods of great upheaval occurred from the time of the Norman Conquest to the beginning of the 20th century, the line of connection is almost entirely unbroken. Perhaps the most revolutionary changes occurred in the 17th century as a result of the Civil War and, later, the Glorious Revolution of 1688; though even then there was no real breach of continuity. The primitive financial institutions of early England centred round the king's household. In other words, the royal preceded the national economy in importance. Revenue dues collected by the king's agents, rents, or rather returns of produce from land, and special levies for emergencies formed the main elements of the royal income which gradually acquired greater regularity and consistency. There is, however, little or no evidence of what modern governments recognise as financial organisation until the 11th century. The influence exercised from Normandy, which so powerfully affected the English rulers at this time, tended towards the creation of records of revenue claims as well as a central treasury. Following the Glorious Revolution, control of finance passed more and more to Parliament, which together with the decline of the importance of land rents as a source of income from about the time of the Wars of the Roses led to different forms of taxation. Systematising finance With the union of England and Normandy under William the Conqueror, the idea of settled administrative methods became fixed and of special importance in the financial sphere. The systematizing spirit, so characteristic of both the Norman and Angevin kings, produced the great institution of the Exchequer with its judicial and administrative sections and its elaborate forms of account and control. But even before this, the Domesday Book, now recognized as having a purely fiscal object (in Maitland's words a tax book, a geld book), shows the movement towards careful observation of all sources of revenue. It is clear that William I of England initiated a policy which was followed by his successors despite the serious difficulties during the anarchy that subsisted during Stephen's reign. The obscure question as to the real origin of the special contrivances employed by the Exchequer is, strictly speaking, irrelevant to the financial inquirer, who may be content to hold that, other than the existence of a few Old English analogies, the system, as it appears in the 12th century, is a product peculiar to the conceptions of fiscal organization formed by Norman subtlety. Indeed, its importance lies in the manner in which the institution held together, focussing as it did on the revenues and expenditure of the kingdom. The picture presented by the Dialogue of the Exchequer (c. 1176) is that of a comprehensive system which secured the receipt of royal income by providing a thorough audit of accounts, employing processes adapted to the circumstances of the time. It is, in fact, through the description of financial institutions that it is possible to ascertain the forms of revenue held by the crown. Thus, the ingenuity expended on the Exchequer's administrative machinery had as its aim the increase of the king's resources, a subject in which all politically involved churchmen and lawyers were deeply involved. The history of the English fiscal system affords the best known example of continuous financial development in terms of both institutions and methods. Although periods of great upheaval occurred from the time of the Norman Conquest to the beginning of the 20th century, the line of connection is almost entirely unbroken. Perhaps the most revolutionary changes occurred in the 17th century as a result of the Civil War and, later, the Glorious Revolution of 1688; though even then there was no real breach of continuity. Royal and feudal prerogative In order to understand the character of English finance in the Middle Ages, it is essential to constantly bear in mind the identification of the king with the state. Although feudalism was, in one aspect, a powerful instrument for the division of political authority, the particular form in which the Conqueror introduced it to England nevertheless enabled the fiscal rights of the crown to be established more strictly than was possible under previous conditions. First, the actual property of the crown was better administered as each royal manor became subject to the new system of accounting. Secondly, the king's various claims or dues took on a more decidedly feudal character, thus receiving stricter legal definition and, thirdly, the higher judicial organizations assisted the expansion of court fees while, above all, the increased authority of the state made the casual receipts (for such they were) from trade more profitable. Sources of revenue in the High Middle Ages Broadly, the sources of revenue fall under the following heads: #The royal demesne (i.e. estates managed by the crown), which was distributed throughout England, derived in part from the possessions of the old English kings. These were increased by confiscations following the rebellions during the reigns of the early Norman kings and by the doctrine of escheat which stated that untenanted land reverted to the king (terra regis) under his allodial right. Over fourteen hundred manors appear as royal demesne in the Domesday Book. The royal forests, placed under special forest laws, yielded little revenue except in the form of offender penalties. Rural tenants who held by socage at first paid rent in the form of produce from the land, but this was gradually substituted by cash payments. As the royal demesne was favourable to the growth of towns, the rents derived from urban tenants became a valuable part of the demesne's yield. The revenues of the towns were frequently farmed-out which resulted in the crown receiving from the firma burgi (\\"farm of the burgh\\") a fixed and secure annual payment. #The \\"feudal incidents\\" were feudal rights of the king as the overlord of his tenants-in- chief, which included the claim to knight-service, the three regular feudal aids and payments of feudal relief on succession to a fief, as well as the profits from wardships and marriages, together with escheats forfeitures. The yields from these sources varied with the power of the king and were kept within bounds by the resistance of tenants as shown in the demands of Magna Carta(1215). #The administration of justice was a lucrative prerogative of the crown. Suitors had to pay not only for the hearing of their cases but also fees for obtaining writs. Additionally, amercements and compositions increased receipts from this source. #Vacant religious offices. As much of the kingdom's land (and therefore its wealth) was held by the church under tenure from the king, the opportunity afforded by keeping sees, abbacies and priories vacant (sede vacante) enabled the king to redirect their revenues to himself, under a doctrine akin to a temporary escheat. #Exchequer of the Jews. Until their expulsion in the 13th century, Jews were a highly profitable source of royal revenue. Being under the absolute control of the crown, due to their obligation to obtain royal licence in order to trade as money-lenders in the kingdom, they could be taxed at will either by taking percentages of their property (e.g. in one instance, one-fourth), or by exacting levies for offences, actual or alleged. The establishment of a dedicated Exchequer of the Jews is an indication of their fiscal value. #Direct taxation formed an extraordinary or occasional source of revenue. The Danegeld was succeeded by the carucage, and scutage developed from the commutation of the feudal tenure of knight-service from actual military service into cash payments. #Customs and dues claimed at the ports which were small in amount but which nevertheless contained the germ of the fully developed customs system of later years. The history of the English financial system consists mainly of the different flows over time of the above exchequer receipts. For example, a sheriff was bound to account twice yearly at the Exchequer for the royal revenues of his county (the \\"county farm\\" or corpus comitatisLit: \\"body of the count, or earl\\"). During the century and a half that lay between the Norman Conquest and the granting of Magna Carta, this system operated well. Nevertheless, the character of the ruler affected the vigour of administration, both fiscal and general. For instance, the relatively popular Henry I and Henry II secured far better fiscal results than the unpopular and divisive kings Stephen and John, even though the collection of rents and profits from the royal demesne together with feudal and other dues continued as the mainstay of the revenue. However, indications of change are to be found, and the substitution of the carucage (or plough tax) for the Danegeld marks an advance towards direct taxation of land through its produce. Moreover, the introduction of scutage is not only further evidence of the same tendency, but also a step toward the development of a money-based economy to replace the earlier system of payments-in-kind. The tallage (or special levies) imposed on towns in the king's demesne at times of need appear to have been a doubtful exercise of the royal prerogative, albeit belonging scientifically to the same class as the Danegeld and scutage. Perhaps the most important advance made in this period was the beginning of taxation on movable goods, first applied in the Saladin tithe of 1189 later expanding into a general system. In the reign of King John (1199–1216), the loss of Normandy and his concessions to the demands of the feudal barons set out in Magna Carta rendered financial re-adjustment inevitable. During the long reign of King Henry III(1216–1272), the enforcement by the barons of their privileges granted by Magna Carta acted on the fiscal system by checking the king's arbitrary use of tallages and, as a consequence, encouraged regular assessments of a tax on movables, which became more prevalent over time. The developing concept of necessity to obtain consent of tax-payers before imposition operated to encourage the establishment of bodies representing the various social classes. Indeed, the action of constitutional on fiscal development led to the transition from feudal to parliamentary taxation in its earliest forms. Direct taxation Almost at the beginning of the age of parliamentary taxation, one of the older sources of revenue ceased, popular opinion having forced King Edward I to issue in 1290 the Edict of Expulsion which required the Jews to leave the kingdom. It is probable however that owing to the exactions practised on them, Jewish usurers had become progressively less profitable to the Exchequer. Certainly, the kingdom's general resources had so increased that their contribution became less important. The first effects of parliamentary influence on the fiscal system were the abandonment of tallages on towns and the decline of scutage. Taxes on movables were assessed more systematically so that instead of using varying charges, ranging from one-fourth to one-fortieth, on different classes of goods, the tax was imposed at fixed rates of one-fifteenth on counties and one-tenth on towns (the \\"fifteenth and tenth\\" tax). Commissioners were appointed for each county to ensure stricter assessment and were supplied with special instructions as to taxable and exempt goods. This tax remained in force from 1290 to 1334, albeit the proportions imposed varied over time (e.g. an eighth and a fifth were granted to the king by parliament in 1297, and a tenth and a sixth in 1322). A more general influence was the growing national economy which led to greater activity on the part of the king as administrator which, in turn, increased the state's need for revenue. Although constitutionally the king was expected to live off his revenues, the force of events made this increasingly impracticable. Therefore, from being uncertain and indirect, taxation, especially that on movables, became certain and direct, absorbing older forms over time. Under medieval conditions, the collection of a general property tax presented serious difficulties in that, unsurprisingly, each local and borough authority tried to keep assessments as low as possible. England in the 14th century was not ripe for a system that was found hard to make effective even in more advanced societies. Hence, from 1334 onward, the following method of apportionment was employed, i.e. a fifteenth and tenth was taken as affording a definite sum measured by the yield on the ancient valuation. As this gave between £38,000 and £39,000 in the aggregate, the fifteenth and tenth became for the future practically a fiscal expression for a sum of about £39,000, the total to be divided or apportioned between the several counties, cities and boroughs according to their former payments. This settlement, which remained in force for centuries and affected all later direct taxes, had the great advantages of certainty and adaptability. The inhabitants of any particular town knew their total liability and could distribute it amongst themselves in the manner most convenient to themselves. From the royal standpoint, the arrangement was also satisfactory, for the fifteenth and tenth could be multiplied (e.g. in 1352 three-tenths and fifteenths were voted for three years), and supplied a stable revenue for the service of the kingdom. Moreover, the power of regulating the policy of the crown by the bestowal or refusal of grants was naturally agreeable to parliament. Thus, all sections of the nation united in support of the system established in 1334, just before the opening of the Hundred Years' War, in connection with which it was particularly serviceable. =Poll tax= Akin to the above--at any rate in its nature as a direct impost--was the poll or capitation tax. Financial pressure at the close of Edward III's reign (1377) led to the adoption of a tax of fourpence per head on all persons in the kingdom (mendicants and persons under fourteen years being excepted). This \\"tallage of groats\\", which seems to be derived by analogy from the hearth money for Peter's Pence, was followed by the graduated poll taxes of 1379 and 1380, the former ranging in scale from ten marks (£6 13s. 4d.) imposed on royal dukes and viscounts, to six marks on earls, bishops and abbots down to three on barons and to the groat or fourpence on all other persons over sixteen years of age. It proved to be unproductive, only half the estimated yield of £50,000 being obtained. Indeed, the tax of 1380 varied within narrower limits--from twenty shillings to fourpence (or sixty groats to three), with the proviso that the strong should aid the weak. However, this particular tax is chiefly memorable as the occasion that may have been the real causes of the great Peasants' Revolt of 1381. This unlucky association sealed the fate of the poll tax as a fiscal expedient. It was abandoned, with one exception, for nearly three hundred years, its occasional employment in the 17th century not resulting in its permanent revival. Apart from special circumstances, it is plain that the fifteenth and tenth was better suited than the poll tax for the purpose of English finance. The machinery for collection was ready for the former, while special agents had to gather the latter, even from the poorest classes. In fact, the episode of the poll taxes may be regarded as a fortunately unsuccessful attempt to relieve the propertied classes at the expense of the peasants and poorer burghers. Failure in this respect helped in the maintenance of the settlement of direct taxation devised in 1334. Indirect taxation Parallel with the evolution of direct taxation, but decidedly lagging behind, is the progress of indirect taxation. As already mentioned, the right of levying dues on goods entering or leaving English ports belonged from very early times to the king. Whether this power was, in its origin, due to the protection afforded to traders and thus a kind of insurance, or the result of the royal prerogative of pre-emption is immaterial for finance. What is established is that the prisage of wine or levy of one cask in ten, and the taking of one-fifteenth or one-tenth of other commodities was in force. Attempts to impose additional dues were forbidden by Article 41 of Magna Carta which recognized the ancient and just customs. One of the earliest effects of parliamentary influence is manifested in the establishment of duties on wool, woolfells and leather by the first parliament of Edward I. After efforts by the king to gather increased duties, the Confirmation of the Charter (1297) forbade any increases on the amounts fixed in 1275, which were henceforth known as the ancient customs. Another attempt was made to obtain a higher scale of duties by arrangement with merchants. Foreign traders consented to the royal proposals, which comprised duties on wine, wool, hides and wax, plus a general tax of 1¼% on all imports and exports. Thus, in addition to the old custom of half a mark (6s. 8d.) per sack of wool and each three hundred woolfells, as well as one mark (13s. 4d.) per last or load of leather, foreign merchants paid an extra duty (or surtax) of 50% and also 2s. per tun of wine, the so-called butlerage. The privileges laid down in the Carta Mercatoria (1303) were probably granted conditionally on the acceptance of these enhanced dues. English merchants, however, successfully resisted them so that the old prisage of wine remained unchanged, at least for them. Despite parliamentary opposition on the ground that they amounted to an infringement of the Great Charter, the new customs remained in force. After being suspended in 1311, they were revived in 1322, confirmed by royal authority in 1328, and finally sanctioned by parliament in the Statute of the Staple (1353). They therefore formed part of the permanent crown revenues from the ports and, together with other, older, customs, became the basis for further development. Just as the old direct taxes were supplemented by, and then absorbed into, the general taxation on movables, so customs, in the strict sense, were followed by subsidies or parliamentary grants. One great source of English wealth in the 14th century was the export of a peculiarly fine wool. Thus, the political circumstances of Edward III's time suggested its manipulation for purposes of both policy and revenue. Sometimes in order to influence the towns of Flanders, the export of wool was absolutely prohibited; at others, varying export duties were imposed not only on wool, but also skins and leather. In the reign's early years, these were settled in agreement with merchant classes. These subsidies were first imposed in 1340, being henceforward granted despite frequent complaints. Thus, in 1348, Parliament objected to an export duty of £2 per sack on wool on the ground that it was in fact a tax on landowners who, as a consequence, received lower prices for their wool. Bargains between the king and merchants were forbidden and were therefore brought under parliamentary control by statutes passed in 1362 and 1371. In 1347, besides special duties on wool, imposts on wine and general goods were increased by agreement at a charge of 2s. per tun on the former and 2½% on the latter. Indeed, between 1371 and 1376, these were established as grants under the names Tunnage and Poundage, older dues being left intact. The clergy The clergy occupied a peculiar position in that it still claimed the privilege of self-taxation so that convocation rather than Parliament voted the tenths imposed on its property. In some instances, far heavier charges (e.g. one third in 1296) were decreed by the king, despite which such taxation became less productive during the 14th century. However, by the close of the reign of Richard II, the results of the transition from feudalism to a parliamentary constitution were almost complete. As regards finance, the most important of these were: #The disappearance or reduction of unimportant feudal dues. The fact that this change occurred at a relatively early date is of special significance for English development. #The royal demesne, though it had not yet suffered the losses that later grants were to inflict, had also lost some of its value. #In compensation, direct taxation on property became a ready means of supplying the growing requirements of the administration, the mode of levy being reduced to a well-recognized form, unsatisfactory experiments such as the poll tax having been withdrawn. #The growth of import and export duties through the old and new customs plus subsidies furnished a large part of the requisite funds. In fact, in a little over three hundred years and without violence, the constituent parts of public income had been completely altered in relative value and organization. Further forms of tax raising The Lancastrian era, extending over two-thirds of the 15th century (1399–1471), is noticeable for introducing new forms of direct taxation. The standard tax, the fifteenth and tenth, was failing to meet changing conditions in that, as towns decayed, further allowances had to be given amounting to over 15% (£6,000), which, with other deductions, lowered the yield from fifteenths and tenths to £31,000. To supplement this, a 5% land tax affecting only large land owners was introduced in 1404, a lower rate of 1⅔% being applied to the less wealthy in 1411. A house tax made its appearance in 1428 while taxes on knights' fees and other freeholds were also tried. In 1435 and 1450, a graduated income tax was employed. The minimum rate, 2½%, applied to incomes under £100 (or under £20 in the tax of 1450) rising to 10% on higher incomes, thus evidencing the need for greater revenue. At this time, such methods showed a disposition to adopt foreign models, particularly those of France and Italy. As to indirect taxation, receipts at first seemed to decline so that subsidies were granted for specified fixed terms, albeit that the victory of Agincourt gained a life grant for Henry V. After the enthronement of Edward IV, however, the tenth was literally taken up and voted (1472) by Parliament as a special military provision only. However, it failed to raise the necessary revenue, thus forcing the King to fall back on older forms of grant. Extra taxes on aliens were levied under both Lancastrian and Yorkist rulers but with little profit. The most original contribution of Edward IV's reign to fiscal policy was that of benevolences or payments by wealthy subjects of sums requested by the king. Voluntary in form, these were, in fact, compulsory, and later became one of the great grievances against which Parliament had to struggle. Broader financial issues marked the Tudor period as the era of national monarchies arrived, necessitating the maintenance of greater military and naval forces, as well as more costly machineries of administration. Both external and fiscal policy were affected by the set of ideas that developed into mercantilism while the state of finance reflected the monarch's personal character, particularly in the 16th century, so that decided contrasts could be found. For example, Henry VII carried his desire to replenish the royal treasury depleted by the Wars of the Roses to the point of establishing a \\"reign of fiscal terror\\",Starkey, David. Henry, Virtuous Prince. London, 2008, chapter 16. Biography of Henry VII & VIII through the rigid enforcement of feudal incidents rather than appeals for parliamentary aids, and the establishment of a system of \\"Chamber Finance\\" Richardson, W.C., Tudor Chamber Administration 1485-1547, Baton Rouge Louisiana, 1952 run by the staff of his Privy Chamber mirroring the functioning of the slow and inefficient Exchequer. He was followed by the lavish prodigality of Henry VIII while Elizabeth's financial policy was very different from that of either. In addition, the desire for a vigorous foreign policy, the hope of encouraging native industry and the sentiment of retaliation against the trade regulations of other countries interfered with the strict aim of earlier times, namely the obtaining of the largest possible yields. The whole public economy was regarded as existing only for the furtherance of national power. It is this more complex policy together with new influences such as the discovery of America, the Renaissance and the Reformation that gives special interest to the financial problems of the sixteenth century. The first head of public income at the disposal of the sovereign was that of the crown lands. Although these were diminished over time by grants to the King's relatives and favourites, they were simultaneously built up via resumptions and forfeitures. On the whole, though, losses and gains were thought to be in balance by the close of the 14th century. Crown lands were, however, an inelastic form of revenue, and their great impoverishment--begun in the 15th century by the Lancastrian kings, (in particular, Henry VI)--was caused through expenditure pressures, profligacy and wholesale plunder by officials. Edward IV failed to capitalise on the many forfeited estates reverting to the crown during the Wars of the Roses of the 15th century, so that the main opportunity for aggrandizement was afforded by the dissolution of the monasteries and guilds under Henry VIII. As a result, the great mass of property passing into royal possession was in part assigned to nobles and officials, the remainder being distributed during his children's reigns. Thus, the dwindling importance of land and rents to the public revenue continued. Similarly, feudal dues also became subordinate notwithstanding occasional attempts rigorously to enforce them. The degree of personal monarchy exercised by the Tudors, depending as it did on popular support, therefore tended to encourage the collection of dues other than taxation. Similarly restrained was the use of the old right of purveyance, finally abolished in 1660. In the 16th century, the obtaining of additional revenue from crown lands and the royal prerogative was exploited to the full. These were now, however, far less profitable, the prevailing political and social conditions increasingly pointing to the need for direct taxation to become the principal source of revenue raising. Among the many calls for further revenue, the chief included the need to maintain the ever-expanding machinery of state and price rises caused by growing supplies of precious metals, the effects of which extended into the 17th century. One form of direct taxation remained from Edward III's reign. Fifteenths and tenths continued to be voted in while attempts to introduce new methods failed. In 1488 a military grant framed on the model of the abortive tax of 1472 yielded only a little over one third of the estimate (£27,000 out of £75,000), the unsatisfactory result preventing further experiments during Henry VII's reign. The foreign policy of Henry VIII, particularly his French expedition with its enormous outlay, accounts for the graduated capitation tax of 1513, which, despite anticipation, yielded even less than the tax of 1488 (£50,000 instead of £160,000). But these failures cleared the way for a more effective form of direct impost, a general tax (1514) on land and goods which was at first modest: 2½%. However, it was soon raised to 4s. in the pound on land and 2s. 8d. in the pound on goods, a scale evidently devised with reference to the older fifteenth and tenth, which henceforth became subordinate. The subsidy became the established mode of grant under both Tudors and Stuarts, though by degrees it underwent a change similar to that of its predecessor. Under the taxing statutes, elaborate provisions were made for its assessment and collection in order to secure the greatest possible return. However, old habits proved too strong and the subsidy \\"slipped into the same groove as that of the fifteenth and tenth, in practice becoming a grant of about the same amount as the yield of the preceding subsidy\\" (Dowell). As a result, each subsidy was approximately £100,000 in the middle of the 16th century, but had fallen to only £80,000 by its close. The parallel vote of the clergy in convocation (which, after 1533, was confirmed by Parliament) amounted to £20,000. Usually, Parliament voted a number of fifteenths and tenths plus subsidies, e.g. Elizabeth's first Parliament voted her two fifteenths and tenths plus a subsidy, or, taking the usual values, £160,000. At times of war, such as the attempted invasion by the Spanish Armada, however, votes were enlarged by granting further fifteenths, tenths and subsidies. The history of the subsidy is instructive as regards its tendency to become inelastic over time, approximating to a fixed sum only. Thus, it followed the path of later medieval taxation forming the--albeit undesigned--model for subsequent land and property taxes. Under the Tudors, port duties--the subsidies on wool, hides and leather, plus tunnage at 3s., and poundage at 5%--were granted to each sovereign for life. These, together with the hereditary customs, supplied considerable revenue for crown's use and no better indication of the increased power and popularity of the monarchy can be found than during this era, the contrast with the suspicious, grudging attitudes of the Plantagenet and Lancastrian parliaments signifying a change in the national sentiment. However, increasing the duty on Malmsey wine (1490) had a retaliatory rather than a fiscal aim, being directed against the Venetians who had previously imposed restrictions on English trade. For the same reason, increases were later imposed on French wine in particular. Although restrictions on imports and exports as well as hostile measures against foreign merchants were matters of economic rather than financial policy, they had the indirect effect of increasing the control exercised at the ports. However, the loss of Calais (1558) dislocated the system of the staple by cutting off a vital centre of customs revenue. It may also have contributed to the changed method of valuing duty. Thus, in 1558, fixed valuations were, for the first time, substituted and set down in a book of rates. More stringent reforms and regulations followed, in particular against smuggling and fraud by corrupt officials. Despite such reforms, however, the cost of collection remained unduly high throughout the Tudor period. As in the 14th century, the subsidy had followed both old and new customs. Similarly in the 16th century, impositions levied by royal prerogative also supplemented the parliamentary subsidy, although their principal employment occurred during the following century. A further, significant indication of the future of indirect taxation was furnished by grants of monopolies to inventors, producers and traders. When these affected important commodities, they operated in the same way as taxes farmed out to collectors and, although crown profits therefrom were small, they effectively enhanced prices and excited discontent, promise of redress finally taking place after the hostile debate of 1601. It may fairly be said that one of the greatest struggles between the Stuart kings and Parliament centred round financial policy. It is beyond dispute that taxation was one sphere of conflict and, from the accession of James I (1603) to the start of the Civil War (1642), the legal basis of indirect taxation was tested for port duties in the Case of Impositions (the John Bates case), whilst that of direct taxation was considered in the even more famous Ship Money case, forever associated with John Hampden. Similarly, Parliament also debated impositions, monopolies, votes of subsidies and the proper application of funds therefrom as well as other related matters. Despite this, however, the overall system showed signs of expanding and adapting to the growing needs of the state. The direct grants of the parliaments of James I far exceeded those of earlier reigns--for example, in 1606 fifteenths and tenths, three lay and four clerical subsidies--although efforts to extend other sources of revenue by exercising the royal prerogative naturally reacted on this spirit of liberality. The last fifteenth and tenth was voted in 1624, from which date this old-established form disappeared leaving the subsidy only. In spite of Charles I's high-handed policy, five subsidies were voted after the Petition of Right had been accepted, and even the Long Parliament made similar grants. At or near the outbreak of the Civil War, it also granted the king a graduated capitation tax. Other modes of direct taxation were used without parliamentary sanction. The collection of antiquated feudal dues was enforced through the special courts (particularly the Star Chamber) with a rigour long unknown. James had tried the French device of a tariff of honours and he and his son both employed the benevolence until the Petition of Right made such a levy illegal. But by far the most serious innovation was the collection of Ship Money, a course forced on Charles by his determination to rule without Parliament. These writs embodied the ultimate expression of the ingenuity of the King's advisers in the invention of means to enable him to do so. The first writs secured over £100,000, and were followed by five further issues (1634–1639) bringing in an average return of £200,000 or about three lay subsidies. Like the benevolence, Ship Money was declared to be illegal (1641). The contest respecting monopolies settled by Elizabeth's withdrawal was revived under James, finally being stopped by the Statute of Monopolies (1624) which declared such grants to be utterly void. Certain exceptions (as in the case of the soapboiles) permitted the raising of revenue by what was, in fact, a rudimentary excise and plans for a general excise were also discussed, especially as a substitute for feudal dues, though these were not reduced in practice. In the early part of the 17th century, customs steadily increased from £127,000 in 1604 to nearly £500,000 in 1641 due to the growth of English trade, the adoption of new books of rates--1608 and 1635--the fixing of higher valuations and also the inclusion of new commodities, in particular, wine, currants (the subject of controversy in Bates' case) tobacco and sugar. One development was the adoption of the farming system on a larger scale, an evident imitation from France. Distinctions were made between the great, the petty and the sugar farms, and opportunities for gain were afforded to the relevant officials. Constitutionally, the life grant of subsidies, voted in accordance with Tudor usage to James, was withheld from Charles by Parliament because of his overbearing policies. However, between 1628 and 1640, all customs revenue was raised by the use of the prerogative only, an avenue that was finally closed by The Tunnage and Poundage Act 1641 which made such extra-parliamentary customs illegal. In short, financial progress from the Conquest to the crisis of the Great Rebellion was marked by an almost complete shift of revenue- raising methods. The King had ceased to maintain himself and the royal demesne and the prerogative rights included in feudalism had become totally subordinate, being replaced by direct and indirect taxation. The Civil War and the Commonwealth A new departure in English financial history occurred during the Civil War and the Commonwealth when most feudal systems were abandoned. Thus, this period, together with the Interregnum (1649–1660) may be regarded as marking a new watershed. At the beginning of the struggle, both sides were forced to rely on voluntary contributions. Plate and ornaments were melted down whilst useful commodities were furnished by the adherents of both king and parliament respectively. However, despite the voting in of subsidies and a poll tax, imports were levied only with difficulty so that new methods of collection became necessary. Therefore, in marked contrast to the lax management of former subsidies, direct taxation was, from now on, assessed monthly at a rate fixed from time to time and gathered under strict regulations, thus becoming more systematic and equitable than previously. Despite its origin, this assessment became the model for a later property tax. Its yield for the whole period exceeded £32,000,000 thus proving its importance. Minor contrivances, e.g. the weekly meal tax, indicate various parliamentary difficulties, but were otherwise unimportant. Owing to its control of the sea and the principal ports, Parliament was also able to command customs revenue where it again remodelled duties, abolishing the wool subsidy and readjusting general customs by a new book of rates. A more extensive tariff was adopted in 1656, and various restrictions in harmony with mercantilist ideas of the time were enforced, French wines, silk and wool being exempted from 1649 to 1656. Far more revolutionary in its effects was the introduction of the excise or inland duties on goods, a step which Elizabeth, James I and Charles I had hesitated to take. Beginning (1643) with duties on ale, beer and spirits, it was soon extended to meat, salt and various textiles. Meat and domestic salt were relieved in 1647, and the taxation became definitely established under the administration of commissioners appointed for the purpose. Powers to allow collection by farmers were granted, a bid for both excise and customs amounting to £1,100,000 in 1657. Confiscations of church and royalist lands, feudal charges and special collections helped to make up the total of £83,000,000 raised during the nineteen years of the revolution. Another change was the removal of the Exchequer to Oxford, which nevertheless left the real fiscal machinery at the disposal of those committees that directed the affairs of Parliament. Under Cromwell the Exchequer was re-established (1654) in a form suited for such financial change, the office of Treasurer being placed in the hands of commissioners. The Restoration and beyond A complete reconstruction of the revenue system became necessary during the Restoration. The feudal tenures and dues, with the prerogative rights of purveyance and pre-emption, could not be restored and careful inquiry showed that whilst, before the Civil War, the king's annual revenue amounted to just under £900,000, the needs of the restored monarchy would now be about £1,200,000 per annum. The commons therefore set about raising such a sum, an hereditary excise on beer and ale being voted in as compensation for the loss of old, feudal dues, whilst temporary excises on spirits, vinegar, coffee, chocolate and tea were put in place. All differences between old and new customs and subsidies had disappeared under the Commonwealth. The General or Great Statute (1660) provided a scale of duties, 5% on imports and exports, with special duties on wines and woollen cloths accompanied by a new book of rates. A house tax levied after the French pattern on each hearth, was introduced and established in 1662. Poll taxes were used as an extraordinary resource, as were the last subsidies, voted in 1663, and then forever abandoned. Licences on retailers and fees on law proceedings were further aids to revenue, which, in the later years of Charles II, and in the short reign of his successor, was kept up to the level of increasing expenditure, but only with difficulty. The Commonwealth assessments were revived on several occasions, indirect taxation being made more rigorous by the imposition of extra duties on brandy, tobacco and sugar as well as French linens and silks. One major development was the placing of customs (1670) and excise (1683) in the hands of special commissioners, as opposed to the former system of farming them out to private collectors. This more modern approach was further evidenced by the greater care taken with customs' administration. Amongst expert officials Dudley North, was the most distinguished commissioner of customs. In this period, too, the beginning of the public debt as in the appropriation of bankers' deposits may be found. The Revolution of 1688 may be regarded in both constitutional and financial terms as the completion of the work of the Long Parliament. In the latter respect its chief effects were: #The transfer of the administration of finances from the king's nominees to officials under parliamentary control #The consequent application of revenue to the purposes designated by parliamentary appropriation #The rapid expansion of various forms of revenue, particularly indirect taxation #The rise and growth of the national debt, combined with the creation of an effective banking system. (The greater part of the 18th century was occupied with the working out of these results.) The government of William III faced the expense of war whilst simultaneously needing to allay discontent at home. As a preliminary to settling the necessary revenue, a return was prepared, showing tax receipts of £1,100,000 and £1,800,000 during peace and wartime respectively. Parliament believed that £1,200,000 per annum would suffice for the kingdom's ordinary requirements but nevertheless introduced the Civil List, assigning £600,000 for certain fixed payments, leaving the remainder for other state needs. As \\"hearth money\\" had proved extremely unpopular, it was abolished, despite its yield of £170,000. Additionally, further excise duties were voted in for the duration of William and Mary's lifetimes, plus further customs duties, albeit that the latter were for a limited term only. However, these revenues were still totally insufficient to meet the pressures of war and new taxes were therefore created, older forms being revived. A series of poll and capitation taxes was imposed between 1689 and 1698 which were thereafter abandoned, being as unpopular as 'hearth money'. In 1688, monthly assessment were introduced, followed by income tax, followed by twelve-monthly assessments in 1690 and 1691. The way was thus prepared for the property tax of 1692, imposing a rate of 4s. in the pound on real estate, offices and personal property. However, the old difficulties of collection turned it mainly into a land tax, by which name it became generally known. The 4s. rate brought in £1,922,712, a return which declined in later years. To meet the shortfall, therefore, a fixed quota of nearly half a million (a 1s. rate) was adopted in 1697, the amount being apportioned in specified sums to towns and counties, its framework remaining substantially the same until 1798, the year of Pitt's redemption scheme. In 1696, houses were taxed at 2s. each, higher rates being applied to extra windows. Thus, the beginning of the window tax, licences on pedlars and a temporary tax on company stocks completed these imposts. Following Holland's example, stamp duties were adopted in 1694, being extended in 1698 and large amounts were added to the excise. Breweries and distilleries were placed under charge and important commodities such as salt, coal, malt, leather and glass were included as taxable articles, the two latter being later removed. Similarly, customs rates were also increased. In 1698 the general 5% duty was raised to 10%. French goods became liable to surtaxes, first at 25%, then 50%, whilst goods from other countries were charged at a lesser amount. Moreover, spirits, wines, tea and coffee were taxed at special rates. Kingdom of England Exchequer note-5 Pounds (1697), issued during the reign of William III The expansion of the fiscal system may be best realised from the fact that, during the comparatively short reign of William III (1689–1702), the land tax produced £19,200,000, customs raising £13,296,000, and excise £13,650,000, or approximately £46 million when added together. In the last year of the reign, returns from these taxes were respectively--land tax (at 2s.), £990,000, customs £1,540,000, excise £986,000, or a total exceeding £3.5 million. The removal of regular export duty applied to domestic woollen manufactures and corn only, both cases additionally being due to special reasons of policy. Quite as remarkable as the growth of revenue was the sudden appearance of public loans. In earlier periods, a ruler accumulated treasure (Henry VII left £1,800,000) or pledged jewels or customs revenue or, occasionally, his friends to repay his loans. Edward III's dealings with Florentine bankers are well known, but it was only after the Revolution that the two conditions essential for a permanent, public debt were realized: #The responsibility of the government to the people #An effective market for floating capital. At the close of war in 1697, a debt of £21.5 million had been incurred, of which over £16 million was still owed at William III's death. Connected with the public debt at that time was the foundation of the Bank of England which increasingly became the agent for dealing with the state's revenue and expenditure, although the Exchequer continued to exist until 1834 as a real, albeit antiquated, institution. Thus it is clear that, by the end of the 17th century, new influences dating from the Civil War brought into being all elements of the modern financial system. Expenditure, revenue, borrowing and loans essentially developed into their present-day form. Increases in amounts plus procedural refinements combined with improved views on public policy were the only changes that occurred thereafter. Broadly speaking, the 18th and 19th centuries exhibit several distinct financial periods. During the 90 years from the death of William III (1702) to the outbreak of the Revolutionary War with France (1793), there were four wars covering nearly 35 years. The long, peaceful administration of Walpole can be contrasted with the shorter intervals of peace following each contest. From the beginning of the war with the French Republic to the Battle of Waterloo there was an almost unbroken twenty years of war. The following forty years' peace ended with the Crimean War (1854–56), whilst a further forty years' peace ended with the Second Boer War (1899–1902). During this time, the older form of mercantilism gave way to protectionism which, in turn, led to the gradual adoption of free trade. During each period of war, taxation (particularly indirect taxation) and debt increased. Financial reform was synonymous with peace and, among the great financial ministers, Walpole, the younger Pitt, Peel and Gladstone were conspicuous, while Huskisson's services in the kindred field of economic policy deserve special notice. By taking the several great heads of revenue in order, it is comparatively easy to understand the nature of the progress made in subsequent years. #The land tax, established on a definite basis in 1692, was the great 18th century form of direct taxation. Varying in rate from 1s. (in 1731) to 4s. (in most war years), Pitt, in 1798, converted it into a redeemable charge on the lands of each parish, thus reducing it from £1,911,000 in 1798 to £730,000 in 1907–1908. Moreover, major increases in other heads impaired its fiscal value. #Excise duty grew rapidly in the 18th century. Most articles of common consumption were permanently taxed, although Adam Smith unreservedly condemned those on soap, salt, candles and leather. In 1739, excise duties brought in £3 million, a sum that subsequently rose to £10 million, continued expansion being due both to the wider area covered and the country's increasing consumption. #Customs were equally serviceable, increased duties being even more considerable. The general 10% rate of 1698 became 15% in 1704, a fourth 5% was imposed in 1748 and, in 1759, general duties were raised to 25%. Coincidentally, customs duties on special articles such as tea were also increased. Indeed, the American War of Independence produced a further 10% increase plus special extra duties on tobacco and sugar. Indeed, by 1784 customs revenue had risen to over £3 million. However, two further matters must be taken into account: #The extreme rigour of duties and prohibitions aimed chiefly against French trade; and #The absence of care in estimating the point of maximum productiveness for each duty. Swift's famous saying that, in the arithmetic of customs, two and two sometimes made only one, is well exemplified in England at this time. Smugglers were responsible for the loss of much of the country's foreign trade revenue despite the fact that efforts at reform were not altogether wanting. Walpole made several useful adjustments by abolishing general duties on exports plus several on imported raw materials such as silk, beaver, indigo and colonial timber. His most ambitious scheme for the warehousing of wine and tobacco in order to relieve exporters failed, however, because of the popular belief that it was the forerunner of a general excise. Nevertheless, his reduction of land tax together with his earlier funding plan deserve notice, as does his determination to preserve peace, which was also assisted by his fiscal reforms. Pitt's administration from 1783 to 1792 marks another period of improvement. The consolidation of the customs laws (1787), the reduction of tea duty to nearly one-tenth of its former amount, the conclusion of a liberal commercial treaty with France and the attempted trade arrangement with Ireland tend to show that Pitt would have anticipated many of the free trade measures of later years had it been his lot to enjoy ten more years of peaceful administration. One financial problem which excited interest and even alarm, however, was the rapidly increasing public debt. Each war gave rise to greater additions whilst intervals of peace showed little diminution, its amount rising from £16 million in 1702 to £53 million at the time of the Treaty of Utrecht (1713). In 1748 it reached £78 million and, at the close of the Seven Years' War, it stood at £137 million, only to exceed £238 million by the time the American colonies became independent. Apprehension of national bankruptcy led to the adoption of the device of a sinking fund but, in this instance, Pitt's usual sagacity failed him. The influence of Richard Price's theory induced the policy of assigning special sums for debt reduction without regard to the fundamental need to maintain a real surplus. Income tax The revolutionary and Napoleonic wars mark an important stage in English finance. The national resources were strained to the utmost, and the whip and spur of taxation was used on all classes. In the earlier years of struggle, the expedient of borrowing enabled the government to avoid the more oppressive forms of charge but, as time passed, every possible expedient was brought into play. The class of taxes organized during peacetime had been those on houses, carriages, servants, horses, plate, etc., these being raised by successive steps of 10% each until, in 1798, their total charge was increased threefold-- four or fivefold for the rich--under the plan of a \\"triple assessment\\". The comparative failure of this scheme (which did not produce the estimated yield of £4.5 million) prepared the way for the most important development of all-- the introduction of income tax in 1798. Though a development of the triple assessment, income tax was also connected with the permanent settlement of land tax as a redeemable charge. Indeed, it is possible to trace the progress of direct taxation from the scutage of Norman times through to the fifteenth and tenth, the Tudor subsidies, the Commonwealth monthly assessments and the 18th century land tax, to the income tax as applied by Pitt which, after an interval of disuse, was revived by Peel in 1842. However, its immediate yield was rather less than was expected--£6 million out of £7.5 million. Nevertheless, by altering the mode of assessment from that of a general declaration to returns under several schedules, the tax became, at first 5%, and afterwards at 10%, the most valuable part of the revenue. In 1815 it contributed 22% of total receipts--i.e. £14,600 million out of £67 million-- and, had it been employed at the beginning of the war, it would almost certainly have obviated much of the government's financial difficulties. The window tax, which continued throughout the 18th century, had been supplemented during the American War by a tax on inhabited houses (one of Adam Smith's suggestions). Again, probate duty had been gradually raised during the 18th century, the legacy duty being introduced in 1780, which was moderate and did not affect land. Though direct and quasi-direct taxes had been dramatically increased, their growth was eclipsed by that of excise and customs. With each succeeding year of war, further articles attracted duty whilst tax rates were raised. The maxim, said to have guided financiers in other countries, to the effect that wherever you see an object, tax it, fairly expressed the guiding policy of the early 19th century. Eatables, liquors, the materials of industry, manufactures, and commercial transactions had in to pay toll in almost all their forms. For example, salt attracted 15s. per bushel, sugar 30s. per cwt., beer 10s. per barrel (with 4s. 5d. per bushel on malt plus a hop duty), tea 96% ad valorem. Timber, cotton, raw silk, hemp and bar iron were also taxed as were leather, soap, glass, candles, paper and starch. Despite the need for revenue, many customs duties were framed on protection thereby producing relatively small returns. For example, import duty on salt in 1815 produced £547, as against £1,616,124 from excise; pill-boxes brought in 18s. 10d., saltpetre 2d., with 1d. for the war duties. The course of war taxation was marked by varied experiments. Duties were raised, lowered and raised again, or given some new form in an effort to raise more revenue. Some duties, i.e. that on gloves, were abandoned as unproductive but the conclusion is irresistible in that the financial system generally suffered from over- complication and absence of principle. In the period of his peace administration, Pitt was prepared to follow the teaching of The Wealth of Nations. However, the strain of war forced him and his successors to employ whatever heads of taxation were likely to bring in funds without violating popular prejudices. Along with taxation, debt increased. For the first ten years additions averaged £27,000,000 per annum, bringing the total to over £500,000,000. By the close of the war in 1815, the total reached over £875 million, somewhat smaller annual increases resulting from the adoption of more effective taxes, particularly income tax. Increasing trade levels also helped and the import of articles such as tea advanced in proportion with the growing population. Thus, tea duty of 96% yielded no less than £3,591,000 in 1815. It is, however, true that by that time, the tax system had reached its limit. Further extension (except by direct property confiscation) was hardly possible so that the war closed victoriously at the moment when prolongation seemed unendurable. A particular aspect of the English financial system is its relation to the organization of the finance of territories connected with the English crown. The Exchequer may be plausibly held to have been derived from Normandy, and wherever territory came under English rule the methods familiar at home seem to have been adopted. With the loss of the French possessions the older cases of the kind disappeared. Ireland, however, had its own exchequer, and Scotland remained a distinct kingdom. The 18th century introduced a remarkable change. One of the aims of the union with Scotland was to secure freedom of commerce throughout Great Britain, and the two revenue systems were amalgamated. Scotland was assigned a very moderate share of the land tax (under one-fortieth), and was exempted from certain stamp duties. The attempt to apply selected forms of taxation custom duties (1764), stamp duties (1765), and finally the effort to collect the tea duty (1773) to the American colonies are indications of a movement towards what would now be called imperialist finance. The complete plan of federation for the British empire, outlined by Adam Smith, is avowedly actuated by financial considerations. Notwithstanding the failure of this movement in the case of the colonies, the close of the century saw it successful in respect to Ireland, though separate financial departments were retained till after the close of the Napoleonic War and some fiscal differences still remain. By the consolidation of the English and Irish exchequers and the passage from war to peace, the years between 1815 and 1820 may be said to mark a distinct step in the financial development of the country. The connected change in the Bank of England by the resumption of special payments supports this view. Moreover, the political conditions in their influence on finance were undergoing a revolution. The landed interest, though powerful at the moment, had henceforth to face the rivalry of the wealthy manufacturing communities of the north of England, and it may be added that the influence of theoretic discussion was likely to be felt in the treatment of the financial policy of the nation. Canons as to the proper system of administration, taxation and borrowing come to be noticed by statesmen and officials. These influences may be followed out in their working by observing the chief lines of adjustment and modification that followed the conclusion of peace. Relieved from the extraordinary outlay of the preceding years, the government felt bound to propose reductions. With commendable prudence it was resolved to retain the income-tax at 5% (one-half of the former rate), and to join with this reduction the removal of some war duties on malt and spirits. Popular feeling against direct taxation was so strong that the income-tax had to be surrendered in toto, a course which seriously embarrassed the finances of the following years. For over twenty five years the income-tax remained in abeyance, to the great detriment of the revenue system. Its revival by Peel (1842), intended as a temporary expedient, proved its services as a permanent tax; it has continued and expanded considerably since. Both the excise and customs at the close of the war were marked by some of the worst defects of a vicious kind of taxation. The former had the evil effect of restricting the progress of industry and hampering invention. The raw materials and the auxiliary substances of industry were in many cases raised in price. The duties on salt and glass specially illustrated the bad results of the excise. New processes were hindered and routine made compulsory. The customs duties were still more restrictive of trade; as they practically excluded foreign manufactures, and were both costly and in many instances unproductive of revenue. As George Richardson Porter showed in Progress of the Nation (1851), the really profitable customs taxes were few in number. Less than a score of articles contributed more than 95% the revenue from import duties. The duties on transactions, levied chiefly by stamps, were ill-graded and lacking in comprehensiveness. From the standpoint of equity the ground for criticism was equally plain. The great weight of taxation fell on the poorer classes. The owners of land escaped giving any return for the property that they held under the state, and other persons were not taxed in proportion to their abilities, which had been long recognized as the proper criterion. The grievance as to distribution has been modified, if not removed, by the great development of: #The income-tax #The death or inheritance duties. Beginning at the rate of 7d. per pound (1842–1854), the income-tax was raised to 1s. 4d. for the Crimean War, and then continued at varying rates reduced to 2d. in 1874, it rose to 5d., then in 1894 to 8d., and by 1909 appeared to be fixed as a minimum at 1s., or 5% on income from property. The yield per penny on has risen almost uninterruptedly. From £710,000 in 1842, it now exceeds £2,800,000, though the exemptions and abatements are much more extensive. In fact, all incomes of £3 per week are absolutely free (£160 per annum is the precise exemption limit), and an income of £400 derived from personal exertion pays less than 5½d. per pound, or 2¼%. The great productiveness of the tax is equally remarkable. From £5,600,000 in 1843 (with a rate of 7d.) the return rose to £32,380,000 in 1907–1908, having been at the maximum of £38,800,000 in 1902–1903, with a tax rate of 6¼%. The income-tax thus supplies about one- fifth of the total revenue, or one-fourth of that obtained by taxation. Several fundamental questions of finance are connected with the taxation of income and have been dealt with by English practice. Small incomes claim lenient treatment; and, as mentioned above, this leniency means in England complete freedom. Again, earned incomes appear to represent lower ability to pay than unearned ones. Long refused on practical grounds (as by Gladstone and Lowe), the concession of an abatement of 25% on earned incomes of £2,000 and under was granted in 1907. The question whether savings should be exempt from taxation as income has (with the exception of life insurance premiums) been decided in the negative. Allowances for depreciation and cost of repairs are partially recognized. Far more important than these special problems is the general one of increased tax rates on large incomes. Up to 1908-1909 the tax above the abatement limit of £700 remained strictly proportional but opinion showed a decided tendency in favour of extra rates or a supertax on incomes above an assigned amount (e.g. £5,000), and this was included in the budget of 1909–1910. Estate duty In close relation with the income-tax is the estate duty, with its adjuncts of legacy and succession duties. After Pitt's failure to carry the succession duty in 1796, no change was made until Gladstone's introduction in 1853 of a duty on land and settled property parallel to the legacy duty on free personality. Apart from certain minor alterations, the really vital change was the extension in 1894 of the old probate duty into a comprehensive impost applicable to all the possessions of a deceased person. This Inheritance Tax (to give it its scientific title) operates as a complementary property tax, and is thus an addition to the contribution from incomes derived from large properties. By graduation the charges on large estates in 1908-1909 (before the proposal for further increase in 1909-1910) came to 10% on £1,000,000, and reached the maximum of 15% at £3,500,000. From the several forms of the inheritance taxes the national revenue gained £14,500,000, with £4½ million as a supplementary yield for local finance. The expansion of direct taxation is evident on comparing 1840 with 1908. In the former year the probate and legacy duties brought in about one million pounds; the other direct taxes; even including the house duty, did not raise the total to £3,000,000. In 1908 the direct taxation of property and income supplied £51,500,000, or one-third of the total receipts as against less than one- twentieth in 1840. But though this wider employment of direct taxation a characteristic of European finance generally reduced the relative position of the taxation of commodities, there was a growth in the absolute amount obtained from this category of duties. There were also considerable alterations, the result of changes in the views respecting fiscal policy. At the close of World War I the excise duties were at first retained, and even in some cases increased. After some years, reforms began. The following articles amongst others were freed from charge: salt (1825); leather and candles (1830); glass (1845); soap (1853); and paper (1860). The guiding principles were: #The removal of raw materials from the list of goods liable to excise #The limitation of the excise to a small number of productive articles #The placing of the greater part (practically nearly the whole) of this form of taxation on alcoholic drinks Apart from breweries and distilleries, the excise had little field for its work. The large revenue of £35,700,000 in 1907-1908 was derived one-half from spirits (£17,700,000), over one-third from beer, while most of the remainder was obtained from business taxation in the form of licences, the raising of which was one of the features of the budget in 1909. As a feeder of the revenue the excise might be regarded as, equal to the income-tax, but less to be relied on in times of depression. Valuable as were the reforms of the excise after 1820, they were insignificant as compared with the changes in the customs. The particular circumstances of English political life have led to perhaps undue emphasis being placed on this particular branch of financial development. Between 1820 and 1860 the customs system was transformed from a highly complicated arrangement of duties, pressing with severity on nearly all foreign imports, into a simple and easily understood set of charges on certain specially selected commodities. All favours or preferences to home or colonial producers disappeared. Expressed in financial terms, all duties were imposed for revenue only, and estimated in reference to their productiveness. An assimilation between the excise and customs rates necessarily followed. The stages of the development under the guidance of Huskisson, Peel, and Gladstone are commonly regarded as part of the movement for Free Trade but the financial working of the alteration is understood only by remembering that the duties removed by tens or by hundreds were quite trivial in yield, and did not involve any serious loss to the revenue. Perhaps the most remarkable feature of the English customs of the 19th century was the steadiness of the receipts. In spite of trade depressions, discussion was likely to be felt in the treatment of the financial policy of the nation. Canons as to the proper system of administration, taxation and borrowing come to be noticed by statesmen and officials. The exemption of raw materials and food; the absence of duties on imported, as on home manufactures; the selection of a small number of articles for duty; the rather rigorous treatment of spirits and tobacco, were the salient marks of the English fiscal system which grew up in the 19th century. The part of the system most criticised was the very narrow list of dutiable articles. Why, it was asked, should a choice be made of certain objects for the purpose of imposing heavy taxation on them? The answer has been that they were taken as typical of consumption in general and were easily supervised for taxation. Moreover, the sumptuary element is introduced by the policy of putting exceptionally heavy duties on spirits and tobacco, with lighter charges on the less expensive wines and beers. Facility of collection and distribution of taxation over a larger class appear to be the grounds for the inclusion of the tea and coffee duties, which are further supported by the need for obtaining a contribution of, roughly speaking, over half the tax revenue by duties on commodities. The last consideration led, at the beginning of the 20th century, to the sugar tax and the temporary duties on imported corn and exported coal. As a support to the great divisions of income-tax, death duties, excise and customs, the stamps, fees and miscellaneous taxes are of decided service. A return of £9,000,000 was secured by stamp duties. So-called non-tax revenue largely increased, owing to the extension of the postal and telegraphic services. The real gain was not so great, as out of gross receipts of £22,000,000 over £17,500,000 is absorbed in expenses, while the carriage of ordinary letters seems to be the only profitable part of these services. Crown lands and rights (such as vintage charges) were of even less financial value.

Born in the Sheepshead Bay section of Brooklyn, New York, to a New York City employee, he had a relatively conventional political life in his youth, though he was among those who protested the execution of Caryl Chessman. He graduated from Pace University, where he majored in politics and philosophy, and worked for a while for the City of New York welfare department. In 1965, he left New York for San Francisco, where he met the poet Allen Ginsberg at the City Lights Bookstore. Within a few days, he was volunteering at the Vietnam Day Committee in Berkeley, California. It was there he met Jerry Rubin and Abbie Hoffman, with whom he co-founded the Youth International Party or Yippies. He also met Bobby Seale and other Black Panther Party members there and became a full-time political activist. Rubin once said that Albert was a better educator than most of the professors. Among the many activities he participated in with the Yippies were throwing money off the balcony at the New York Stock Exchange, the Exorcism of the Pentagon, and the 1968 Presidential campaign of a pig named Pigasus. He was arrested at the disturbances outside the 1968 Democratic National Convention and was named as an unindicted co-conspirator in the Chicago Seven case. His wife, Judy Gumbo Albert, claimed, according to his New York Times obituary, this was because he was working as a correspondent for the Berkeley Barb. Later, he would work closely with the Berkeley Tribe underground newspaper and lived at the Tribe's commune when he was not traveling for political engagements. In 1970, he ran for sheriff of Alameda County, California, in revenge for \\"getting my balls sprayed with hot, painful chemicals as a welcome-to-prison health measure\\" after being arrested in 1969. Although he lost to the incumbent, Frank Madigan, Albert garnered 65,000 votes, in an ironic twist, in a race with the sheriff who had supervised his earlier incarceration during the Vietnam Day Committee anti-draft protests in downtown Oakland. After the Weather Underground helped Timothy Leary escape from a California prison, where he had been imprisoned for possessing L.S.D., Albert helped arrange for Leary to stay with Eldridge Cleaver in Algeria. In 1971, he was subpoenaed before several grand juries investigating the political bombing of the U. S. Capitol by the Weather Underground in March 1971, as well as a conspiracy by the Piggy Bank Six to bomb several branches of First National City Bank in Manhattan the previous year. He was not charged in either case. In the early 1970s, he and his wife sued the FBI for planting an illegal wiretap in his house. They won a $20,000 settlement and, in 1978, two FBI supervisors were fired for this action. In 1984, he and his wife moved to Portland, Oregon. They co-edited an anthology, The Sixties Papers: Documents of a Rebellious Decade, that collected material that originated in the Civil Rights Movement, Students for a Democratic Society, the anti-war movement, the counterculture, and the women's movement. His memoir, Who the Hell is Stew Albert?, was published by Red Hen Press in 2005. He ran the Yippie Reading Room until he died of liver cancer brought on by hepatitis in 2006. Two days before his death, he posted on his blog, \\"My politics haven't changed.\\" In the film Steal This Movie! Albert is played by Donal Logue.

The term \\"philomatic\\" (in French, philomathique) is no longer in use. The philomatic societies were influential in the nineteenth century. The most remarkable was the Philomatic Society of Paris (Société Philomathique de Paris). Société Philomathique de Paris This Society was created on 10 December 1788 by Augustin-François de Silvestre, Alexandre Brogniard, Audirac, Broval, Petit and Riche. It was defined by J.-André Thomas, one of its members, as: \\"La Société Philomathique de Paris est une société scientifique et philosophique pluridisciplinaire, de haut niveau. On en devient membre par cooptation, puis par vote de substitution, car le nombre de ses adhérents est limité. Elle est républicaine, non secrète, entièrement ouverte à la connaissance, farouchement indépendante; elle cultive l'authenticité, la tolérance, la liberté.\\" \\"The Philomatic Society of Paris is a high-level multidisciplinary scientific and philosophical society. One becomes a member by co-option, then by substitution vote as the number of members is limited. The Society is republican, non-secret, and fully open to knowledge, fiercely independent; it promotes authenticity, tolerance and freedom.\\" Many great scientists belonged to the Société: Lavoisier, Laplace, Lacroix, Cuvier, Gay-Lussac, Ampère, Cauchy, Fresnel, Pasteur, Becquerel, De Broglie. Since 1944, the Société has had eleven Nobel Prizes awarded to scientists among its members, and seventeen to emeritus members (including Dirac, Heisenberg, Morgan, and Planck). The Société declined in importance after World War II. Although the Société still exists, it is poorly known and not very influential, partly due to lack of funds.

The Association philomathique d'Alsace et de Lorraine (Strasbourg) and the Académie philomatique ancienne also existed.

Pará The Philomathic Society of Pará was a Brazilian scientific association, founded on October 6, 1866, in Belém, by the naturalist Domingos Soares Ferreira Penna, dedicated to studying the Natural History of the Amazon. It was the embryo from which the Paraense Museum (now the Goeldi Museum) originated. Philomates Association thumb The institution was founded in Lucca, Italy, in 1826, disbanded and founded again in 2005 with the name of Philomates Association (A.F.) The foundation bill was registered in Rome. A.F. rules are collected in the statute and in the internal regulation of the association itself. The Philomates Association, also known as the Philomatich Academy, is the largest philomatic association, with more than 20.000 members worldwide. One of the oldest scientific and philosophical institutions in the world, it has played a prominent role in the history of Western civilisation. It is headed by the technical manager (tetrarch) of Rome, known as First Tetrarch, who has supreme power over the Academy. Its principal doctrines are summarised in the philomatical principles. It promotes research, art and social commitment: their goal is the valorization and the diffusion of culture in every form, through a full collaboration of all members, through their skills and knowledge by using the meritocratic method. Every member, such as manager, artist, freelancer, student, researcher or professor, is engaged in the achievement of the association's projects, depending on personal commitment and technical skills. On 28 December 2005, thanks to the involvement of qualified members of Italian and foreign economic, political and cultural environments and the main western European countries, it took place some preliminary meetings in order to verify the viability of an association which allowed to deepen and discuss the main topics (such as politic, economic, social) familiar to all knowledge branches: like science, philosophy, economics, history, psychology, medicine and so on. The perception of founders was from its origins that a debate between people of different backgrounds and professional proficiency but with the same level of responsibility, could contribute more effectively to improve the ordinary knowledge of issues by studying and discussing to spot new solutions. The second point shared by founders and still now essential to the spirit which is at the bottom of the Philomates Association activity is the deep conviction that the fastest way to solve world's problem is based on good international relationships, good multilateral organizations functioning and on the so- called government \\"intermediate bodies\\". The first Philomates Society's meeting was in Rome at the beginning of 2006 and it was established a working plan for the next seven years (indeed this is the length of the presidential term of office). Since then the association carried on its own activity on a seven-year program basis, monitored yearly by the executive council in charge. Initially the association was made of a narrow number of members, four territorial representatives and three national sections. Afterwards the number increased little by little, taking more and more into account the number of the represented countries. Several national groups have structures strictly depending on the managing board, according to the local needs. For the groups of the main non-Italian cities it is also expected a national level activity and a secretariat. The current First Tetrarch, Alexander, was elected on 23 September 2015 by philomatic conclave. References * Ferri, Mario Guimarães & Motonhama, Shozo. História das Ciências no Brasil.

Historic background During the last ten years the rights of local communities have been constantly violated. This was confirmed by the 400 mayors representing different localities, members of the National Mayors' League, representatives of the Federation of Local and Regional Powers and Association of Gagauz Mayors who gathered to openly oppose the intentions of the Communist governing to destroy the current local public administration system. Participants to the Mayors' Assembly of the Republic of Moldova addressed an appeal to the President of the country, Chair of the Parliament and Prime Minister. They also reserved themselves the right to ask the Council of Europe to monitor the actions undertaken by the Communist governing in the field of local public administration. An initiative group was formed including councilors, mayors, and citizens, which set up a socio- political organization aimed to represent the interests of independent mayors and councilors. It was to become a socio-political movement of the citizens associated regardless of nationality and religion, united by patriotic principles, dignity and human rights. On October 13, 2001 the Founding Congress of the Independents' Alliance of the Republic of Moldova gathered 400 delegates from all the administrative territorial units of the Republic. The congress elected Serafim Urechean, Mayor of the Chişinău Municipality, as the Chair of the Alliance. The Congress decided not to embrace any classical political platform, but rather decided the Alliance to become a democratically oriented socio-political movement, whose immediate goal would be to run in the upcoming elections within a broad democratic coalition. Immediately after the Founding Congress, in November - December 2001 the Independents' Alliance of the Republic of Moldova embarked on establishing primary organizations in the territories. The party established ten primary organizations in two counties, 2 primary organizations in Gagauz-Yeri, five organizations in districts and ten in the Chişinău municipality. Further, Chairs and Deputy Chairs of the county, territorial and local organizations were elected. Those structures would represent the party governing body in the time period between conferences and general assemblies. In addition, the Congress elected Revision and Control Commissions for Alliances' structures at all the levels. The first Congress of the Independents' Alliance of the Republic of Moldova convened on January 19, 2002 in Chişinău and brought together 1,048 delegates from all over the Republic. At issue was the socio-political situation in the Republic of Moldova as well as Alliance's priorities for the future. The Congress adopted the Manifest \\"Independents' Alliance of Moldova - Moldova's pro- European project\\". Further the Congress elected Alliance's governing bodies, approved party symbol and anthem. On July 19, 2003 IARM decided to suspend its activity and join the Party Alliance Our Moldova.

Location  The village is about north-east of the City of Lichfield and 1 mile south-west of Alrewas, consisting of two discrete areas, the older Fradley Village (signposted locally as simply \\"Fradley\\") and the newer Fradley South area which began development in the early 2000s and continues to be developed as of 2020. It is also located from Burton-On-Trent and from Rugeley.  History  Fradley first appeared in 12th-century records as 'Frodeleye', or 'Frod's lea'.http://www.fradleyandstreethaypc.org/fradley Until 1 April 2009 it had been part of the larger parish of Alrewas and Fradley. The parish council is a joint one with Streethay. Following the completion of the Stirling Centre near Fradley South in 2009, comprising retail units, offices and food outlets, Fradley was formally re-categorised as a 'key rural settlement'. Village amenities Fradley has its own village hall which was completed in the early 2000s and an additional community hall on adjacent land. The village church, St. Stephen's Church, was built in 1861 on the corner of Church Lane and Old Hall Lane. A Victorian schoolhouse, which had stood beside the church since 1875, was demolished in 2008 to make room for modern classrooms at St. Stephen's Primary School. Fradley is close to the A38 road Ryknild Street (which became a dual-carriageway in 1958) and is served by bus services to Lichfield and Burton upon Trent. A railway line passes close to the eastern side of the village but no station exists in Fradley, the nearest passenger station is now Lichfield Trent Valley railway station serving the West Coast Main Line, the London-Crewe line and acting as the terminus for the Cross-City Line. From 1849 until 1965, Alrewas railway station on the South Staffordshire Line was the closest passenger station to Fradley but was closed on 18 January 1965 by the British Railways Board. The Coventry Canal runs through the village and merges with the Trent and Mersey Canal at nearby Fradley Junction. Several bridges cross the Coventry Canal in Fradley, including Bell Bridge which carries the A38. Fradley has a small Post Office/newsagent located in Church Lane and there are several retail units at the Stirling Centre near Fradley South - including two take-away restaurants, a Co-operative Food convenience store, a cafe, a hair salon and a gym. The Fradley Arms Hotel is located adjacent to the southbound carriageway of the A38, next door to the Premier Inn Lichfield and a new public house is planned for a site near Fradley Park. Currently, more new houses are being built adjacent to the Stirling Centre - this estate is nominally called Sheasby Park. This will be a large addition to the village and will introduce 700 new houses to the wider Fradley South development. Fradley Aerodrome/RAF Lichfield Construction on the Fradley Aerodrome (known as RAF Lichfield) started in 1939 and in August 1940 the Royal Air Force moved in, along with Hawker Hurricane, Airspeed Oxford and Avro Anson aircraft. Spitfire arrived in 1941 and Vickers Wellington aircraft followed in 1942. Alongside RAF personnel training in the Wellingtons, there were a large number of Australians and some Canadians and Czechs. The RAF left in 1958 and the whole site was sold by the Air Ministry in 1962. St. Stephen's Church is home to the war graves of a number of Australian aircrew and one German Luftwaffe pilot who lost their lives during World War II. In 2000 a memorial to all who served at RAF Lichfield was constructed in Fradley. Fradley Park In 1998 major redevelopment started on the former airfield, with the construction of factories, warehouses and 750 new houses. Today Fradley Park, a 300-acre warehousing and distribution development, covers most of the former airfield. Tenants of Fradley Park include Tesco, Faurecia, Hellman Worldwide Logistics, NTN Bearings (UK), Newell Rubbermaid, Caterpillar Logistics, Swish UK Zytek and Palletways Birmingham. Fradley Junction Fradley was first mentioned in 1768 when the Engineer James Brindley won the contract to build the canal from Coventry, to link with the Trent and Mersey Canal at Fradley. It was not until 1783 that this canal was completed, meeting the Trent and Mersey at Fradley Junction.  Bown Pond  Bown Pond is a man-made area of water to the south west of Fradley village. The pond was excavated for clay and gravel during the construction of the Coventry canal in 1782. The materials were manufactured into bricks at the brickyard at Hilliard’s Cross. The Bown Pond was originally round and was one of several such pits in the area around Fradley Junction which have since been filled. The pond is named after Josiah Bown, a tenant farmer on the Bridge farm estate, who is said to have drowned in the pond in 1820 on his way back from the Bull’s Head Inn, Rikneld Street.Canals - The Making of a Nation: A Journey Into the Heart of Industrial Britain IBSN 1849901082 When the area was taken over by the Air Ministry in 1939 for the development of RAF Lichfield this small lake became a popular meeting place for Australian airman who were based at the station. In the 1940s Bown Pond had a small stock of fish, mainly carp, an annual children’s fishing competition took place until the mid fifties when the pond became choked with weed. After RAF Lichfield was decommissioned in 1958 the pond was left untended until the early 2000s. Landscaping works in 2003 cleared and re- shaped the pond to its current kidney shape. It was re-purposed as a balancing pond for the adjacent housing development to mitigate against surface water flooding. The island in the middle of the pond was also cleared revealing the remains of a small diving platform that had been constructed on the island during WW2. The remains of this are still visible today. The area around the pond is collectively known as Bown Pond, much of the area now forms part of the Fradley South and Sheasby Park housing developments. The Sterling Centre shops and leisure facilities are on the site which was previously Bown Pond Lane. The lane ran from Common Lane at Bown Pond and joined onto Gorse Lane, following the route which eventually became runway 17 at RAF Lichfield. During the construction of the second phase of the Fradley South Housing development the pond has been further landscaped and is popular with dog walkers.

They were a common shrine element of Hindu and Buddhist architecture in the Khmer Empire. They were later adapted by Buddhist builders in Thailand, especially during the Ayutthaya Kingdom (1350–1767) and Rattanakosin Kingdom (1782–1932). In Thailand it appears only with the most important Buddhist temples. Etymology The term prang is a compound of the Sanskrit terms pra- ('forward, in front') and aṅga (limb of the body), with the contacting vowels united by sandhi. Structure Prang tower took form of a multi-tiered structure with receding size as it ascends. The receding size of almost identical roof structures of the stepped pyramidal tower, creates a perspective illusion as if the tower is taller than it actually is. The form of the tower is a reminiscent of Indic shikhara of Hindu temple, although slightly different in design. On each cardinal points, a prang usually has richly adorned tympanum and lintel above doorways or blind doors. The prang took plan of multi corners rectangular, which on top of each roof steps are adorned with antefixes, which mostly took theme of multi-headed Nāgas, Garuda or deities. History =Khmer temples= Meru. Originally the Khmer prang temples were for the worship of the Hindu gods, such as Shiva and Vishnu. The space within the prang tower, the cella, was relatively small for two reasons: # The rituals which were held in them were reserved for a small elite (in the capital of the Khmer only the god king could enter the shrine). # The technology of the Khmer could not yet make large airy halls. (Ringis, 1990) The cella was entered via a small porch, usually aligned to the east, which was called the Mandapa. Over the cubic cella rose the central tower, the bud- shaped prang, modeled after the cosmic mountain Meru, crowned by a top stone in form of a lotus bud. The Khmer prangs resembled north Indian temples' shikhara and rekha (temple towers) elements. The early 10th century and the late 12th century prangs in Thailand were influenced by the Khmer architects of the great temple complexes of Angkor Wat and Angkor Thom. =Thai temples= Wat Chaiwatthanaram, an example of Thai style prang The first prangs in Thailand were built in Phimai and Khao Phnom Rung and Lopburi between the early 10th century and the late 12th century, when the Khmer kingdom was dominant. After the Khmer Empire collapsed, the Thai building masters of the Sukhothai Kingdom adapted the Prang form. They extended and developed it. The building material was no more separate small sandstone blocks, instead the Thais built the Prang in brick or laterite covered with stucco. And the cella could be reached only by stairs. An example for this is the Prang of the Wat Mahathat in Phitsanulok. Later developments of the Prang suggested the cella only. The entrance door became a niche, in which was placed the Buddharupa (Buddha statue), which had originally taken the central position inside. For reasons of symmetry the niche was repeated on all four sides. On its pinnacle was a Trishul, the \\"weapon of Indra\\". A \\"more modern\\" Prang is a slim construction, like an ear of corn, which lets its Khmer origin be only suspected. The best example is Wat Arun, the landmark of Bangkok. Also Wat Phra Kaeo has six thin Prangs arranged in a row. Another example is the four Prangs arranged in all four directions around Wat Pho in Bangkok, and the five Prangs in Wat Pichayart in Thonburi.

Introduced in 1940 and withdrawn by 1980, they spent the whole of their working lives on the electrified railway lines north of Liverpool. The trains were designed to replace older electric trains built by the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway on the lines from Liverpool Exchange station to Southport and Ormskirk. These lines were electrified with a direct current (DC) third rail. The Class 502s entered service between 1940 and 1943. They were DC-only and operated as both three-car and two-car sets, which could be coupled together to form five-car or six-car sets for use on the busier services. Design A very modern design for the time, they were equipped with air- operated sliding doors. They were similar to (but somewhat larger than) the Class 503s operating in Wirral, being both longer and wider, allowing 3+2 seating on the Southport 502s compared to 2+2 seating on the Wirral 503s. In addition the 502s had distinctive large resistance cooling grids mounted on top of the cab roof of the motor units. Virtually all electric suburban passenger trains in Great Britain now follow the basic layout pioneered by the Class 502s and 503s, with two sets of double-leaf air operated sliding doors on each side of each carriage. Build Unlike the Wirral Class 503s, which were built by contractors familiar with this type of layout on London Underground trains, the 502s which followed shortly afterwards were built by the LMS's own workshops in Derby. The 502s had conventional railway buffers at the end of each set, as they did a considerable amount of interworking with steam and later diesel services, whereas the 503s in Wirral had automatic Buckeye couplers and no buffers, as they did very little inter-running with services from outside. The Class 502s were considerably more powerful than their Wirral counterparts, having four traction motors. Interiors The interiors of the Class 502s contained varnished wood, tungsten lighting and deep-sprung seating. Apart from the construction differences with the Class 503s, both types of train were given heavy overhauls at Horwich works, and the common red/black/grey seat moquette, and grey paint used on the interiors, plus other common details, gave them a considerable air of similarity. Route changes Liverpool Exchange station closed in 1977, being replaced by new underground stations at Moorfields and Liverpool Central as part of the Northern Line of the Merseyrail network. The electrification was also extended to Kirkby, on the Wigan line, to the north-east of the city and Garston, to the south-east, using Class 502s. The units struggled to cope with the challenging gradients in the new underground sections, which are as steep as 1 in 30 in places, and their reliability suffered. Depots The principal depot was in Southport, on the Preston / Manchester lines at Meols Cop. In the mid-20th century there was a triangle, and the works were situated in the middle. The Preston line closed in the mid-1960s, and the electrified lines from Southport to Meols Cop remained for a further six years, to enable the Merseyrail 502 stock to reach the depot under their own power. Meols Cop closed in 1970. Servicing was then continued at Birkenhead North depot. Hall Road also had a maintenance depot, which conducted minor repairs, and sidings to the north of station; and at the side of the depot. Stabling points were also situated outside Southport Chapel Street station and at Bank Hall, to the west of the four live running tracks. The Bank Hall stabling point fell into disuse prior to the Loop and Link extensions of the 1970s and was replaced by Kirkdale depot in 1976. Numbering British Railways numbers were: * Driving Motor Brake Second, M28311M-M28369M * Trailer Second, M29545M-M29594M * Trailer Second (built as Trailer Composite), M29812M-M29820M * Driving Trailer Composite, M29866M-M29899M Formation These formed, notionally, 34 3-car units Motor-Trailer-Driving Trailer, and 25 2-car units Motor-Trailer. The 2-car units only had a driving cab at one end and could not be operated on their own, only coupled to one of the 3-car units, which was an unusual feature of this stock. It was normal to form the main 5-car sets with the motor cars at the outer ends of the formation, and the trailer coupled to the driving trailer in the centre. The 6-car sets were formed with motor cars at the outer ends of the formation with the driving trailers coupled together in the centre. There were a number of different formations used, but 5-car sets were usual on the main Southport and Ormskirk routes, with a couple of the busiest peak trains being 6-car, formed of two three-car units coupled together. The Crossens shuttle was a 3-car unit, or a specially formed Motor- Driving Trailer 2-car unit. As initially built there was considerable overprovision of first class accommodation, which usually ran virtually empty on these routes. This is an issue seen on some other suburban routes as well. Composite trailers 29812 to 29817 were converted to all-second in 1950 and renumbered. The remaining 3 composite trailers (29818 to 29820) and 29814 were converted to driving composites trailers, with a new cab constructed to match the original 1939 to 1941 design. These conversions allowed more three car units to be formed allowing for greater operational flexibility. The leading saloon of the driving composite trailers was downrated to second class non- smoking in the late 1960s. This saloon was the first class non-smoking section. An additional full width partition, with door, was built across the middle saloon so that approximately one third of this saloon (cab end) became the non-smoking first class section. First class provision was finally withdrawn on these routes in the early 1970s. Livery The units were painted various colours over the years. When initially built in 1939 they were the standard LMS maroon red. After railway nationalisation in the late 1940s units were repainted in light malachite green and further repainting from the 1950s to the standard BR dark green for EMUs. Towards the end of their green days, the units gained yellow warning panels on cab ends. When BR changed their liveries in the mid-1960s the units were repainted plain Rail Blue, continuing with the small yellow warning panel and eventually gaining full yellow ends, the white 'double arrow' British Rail symbol was carried on the DMBS only, continuing the tradition of the green livery of only carrying the BRITISH RAILWAYS symbols on motor coaches. First class lining and '1' numerals appeared on the bodyside next to the middle saloon of driving trailer composites, this was removed when the units were downrated to all second on 3 May 1971 and 'Merseyrail' branding appeared on the centre lower body panels of all coaches with the formation of the passenger transport executive shortly after. Towards the end of their life, in the late 1970s, they were repainted again in their first two-tone livery, the standard blue and grey, in which scheme they were withdrawn. Following withdrawal, two reinstated departmental units were repainted with wasp stripes on the cab ends. Withdrawal and preservation =Withdrawal= Units had begun being withdrawn from 1950. From 1978, new Class 507 units began to arrive on the network and the 502s, which by now were considered life-expired, were gradually withdrawn. The final regular passenger service was on 1 September 1980, with a farewell tour five days later. The last set was withdrawn in November 1980. Two DMBS cars were reinstated in 1981 for departmental duties, and allocated to Hall Road. The departmental units were renumbered from M28354 and M28357 to ADB977017 and ADB977018, respectively, and kept at Kirkdale until 1986. Compared to the similar 503s on the Wirral lines, the Southport 502s appeared run-down and distinctly down-at-heel by the end of their life, with dented panels and peeling paint, even some of the opening quarter light windows were replaced by plain glass, whereas the Wirral units appeared tidy and well-presented to the end. All of the cars, except for one two-car set, were scrapped. =Preservation= A two-car set (driving motor 28361 and driving trailer 29896) was claimed for preservation by the National Railway Museum. For many years the unit was kept at the Steamport centre in Southport, where it was restored to original LMS condition, complete with maroon livery. It operated occasional special services on the Merseyrail electric network for several years in the 1980s. However, when Steamport closed, the NRM were unable to find an alternative location to display it, and relocated the unit to remote storage at MoD Kineton. In early 2007, it was suggested that the NRM are considering disposing of this unit as it no longer features as part of its long term plans. In response, a new preservation group (The Friends of the 502) was formed, with the aim of taking over responsibility for the unit's upkeep. In May 2009 the unit was moved by road to a private site in Tebay, Cumbria. In March 2012, following re-development of the site, the unit was moved to the base of the Merseyside Transport Trust in Burscough, Lancashire. This move means that the unit is under cover for the first time in 15 years.

Design There were eight three-car units, ordered in 1938 by the LNER and built in 1950, but they did not enter service until June 1954. Similar in design to the Class 306 EMUs (prior to their conversion to operation), and built on the same production lines (making a total of 100 units of basically similar design), they were equipped with air-operated sliding doors. Formation Each unit was formed of a Driving Motor Brake Third (seating 52); a Trailer Composite (seating 24 first class and 38 third class passengers); and a Driving Trailer Third (seating 60). Third class was redesignated Second across the whole of BR on 3 June 1956, while the first class seating of these units was declassified to second in early 1960. The eight 3-car sets were formed into 6-car trains at peak hours. The frequency of the Glossop/Hadfield service at peak times was every 30 minutes, and the round trip took nearly 90 minutes, requiring six of the eight units in service each weekday. With one spare unit, and one away for works overhaul at a time, there was no scope to use the units for other tasks. Electrical equipment The EMUs were equipped with a single diamond-shaped pantograph, mounted over the driver's cab and adjacent guard's compartment at the outer end of the driving motor carriage. This gave a ready identification feature, because (following the withdrawal of the Manchester-Altrincham units in May 1971), all other overhead-line EMUs operating in the Manchester area had the motor coach (and thus the pantograph) in the middle of the unit. Unlike the similar Class 306, the eight Class 506 units remained solely equipped for 1,500 V DC operation for their entire lives. This made them unable to operate on any lines away from the Woodhead route when other lines changed to ac operation, and even there they rarely operated east of Hadfield due to low gearing and the risk of overheating, although trials were conducted in 1969 to assess the possibility of use through the Woodhead Tunnel. ;Motors Each power car had four 185 hp GEC traction motorsIan Allan ABC of British Railways Locomotives, winter 1962/3 edition, page 332 giving a total of 740 hp per 3-car set. Numbering A Class 506 (left) at in 1967. British Railways numbers were: * Motor Open Brake Second ** M59401-M59408 (8 cars 1954, Met-Cam) * Trailer Open Second (built as Trailer Composite, declassified early 1960) ** M59501-M59508 (8 cars 1954, Met-Cam) * Driving Trailer Open Second ** M59601-M59608 (8 cars 1954, BRCW) Being built against an LNER order, the numbers were in the former LNER series. To distinguish these from other similarly-numbered carriages, BR used letter prefixes and suffixes, but these varied. At the time that they were delivered, the numbers were in fact unique; but from 1959, new Diesel multiple-units were delivered carrying similar numbers, in the BR series. The Manchester-Glossop- Hadfield EMU number prefixes and suffixes may be summarised thus: *as new — prefix \\"E\\" to denote allocation to the Eastern Region, i.e. E59401 etc. *by 21 September 1957 — suffix \\"E\\" added to denote former LNER number series, i.e. E59401E etc. *1 February 1958 — prefix altered to \\"M\\" following transfer of route to London Midland Region, i.e. M59401E etc. *circa 1968 — suffix altered to \\"M\\" implying transfer to former LMS number series, i.e. M59401M etc. The \\"E\\" suffix seems to have been dropped a few years prior to the change to \\"M\\"; photographs exist from the 1964–1968 period showing unsuffixed numbers, including M59404, M59405 and M59408. No unit numbers were carried, however the cars were normally formed so that the last two digits corresponded, i.e. 59401-59501-59601 etc., and the units were known locally as 01, 02, etc. On the few occasions that units were reformed, one car would be renumbered to correspond with the others in its new unit; thus 59406 became 59408 in December 1983 (59506, 59606 and the real 59408 being withdrawn); while 59401 (crudely renumbered 59402) was formed with 59502 and 59602 about September 1984 (59501, 59601 and the real 59402 being stored out of service). There is a suggestion that the motor coaches would originally have been numbered 29401-8, but this may be a typo - the initial digit \\"2\\" would imply the North Eastern Area of the former LNER, while \\"5\\" denotes the Great Central Section. Classification Originally, no special class code was allotted, the units being known as \\"Manchester-Glossop-Hadfield\\" stock. The class were officially numbered 506 under the TOPS system, however they never carried 506xxx numbers in service. The individual coach types were in the Eastern Region carriage diagram book as Dia. 363F (Driving Motor), 366 (Trailer) and 365F (Driving Trailer). Under TOPS, design codes EB2.05.0A, EH2.04.0A and EE2.04.0A respectively were allotted. Accidents and incidents On 21 May 1970 the 22:45 Manchester Piccadilly to Hadfield was on the up fast line passing Audenshaw Junction near Guide Bridge when the middle and rear cars were diverted onto the up slow line due to the points being changed underneath the train. The middle car turned on its side as a result and was dragged for 90 yards before coming to rest against an overbridge. Two passengers were killed and 13 injured. Withdrawal A Class 506 at Manchester Piccadilly in 1984, shortly before withdrawal. In 1981 the Woodhead line was closed east of Hadfield. In December 1984 the remaining section was converted to the standard 25 kV AC overhead system and the Class 506 EMUs were withdrawn following the last run on 7 December. Following withdrawal, unit 59404-59504-59604 was set aside for preservation, but the rest were all sent to Vic Berry in Leicester for scrap, being cut up in April 1985. They were replaced by Class 303s transferred from Glasgow (themselves since withdrawn). The Manchester-Hadfield line is now operated by Class 323 EMUs. Preservation While one complete unit was scheduled for preservation by West Yorkshire Transport Museum - being originally based at Dinting Railway Museum, then moved to the former BR depot at Bradford (Hammerton Street), and finally to Butterley - it deteriorated severely; two cars, and most of the third, were scrapped in August 1995 by Booth, Rotherham. All that remains is a severed driving end of a motor open brake second, M59404, which is preserved at the Electric Railway Museum, Warwickshire.

The word is the Scots variant of fee. The English had in 1660 abolished these tenures, with An Act taking away the Court of Wards..., since 1948 known as the Tenures Abolition Act 1660. History Prior to 1832, only the vassals of the crown had votes in parliamentary elections for the Scots counties. This favoured subinfeudation as opposed to outright sale of land. This was changed by the Scottish Reform Act 1832, which increased the franchise of males in Scotland from 4,500 to 64,447. In Orkney and Shetland islands, land is still largely possessed as udal property, a holding derived or handed down from the time when these islands belonged to Norway. Such lands could previously be converted into feus at the will of the proprietor and held from the Crown or the Marquess of Zetland. At one time the system of conveyancing by which the transfer of feus was effected was curious and complicated, requiring the presence of parties on the land itself and the symbolic transfer of the property (for example, by throwing a shoe onto the earth of the property transferred)For a similar action, see Book of Ruth 4:17 (KJV): \\"Now this was the manner in former time in Israel concerning redeeming and concerning changing, for to confirm all things; a man plucked off his shoe, and gave it to his neighbour: and this was a testimony in Israel. together with the registration of various documents. However, legislation since the middle of the 19th century has changed all that. Various reforms were attempted before feu was eventually abolished by the Abolition of Feudal Tenure etc. (Scotland) Act 2000. In feu holding, there is a substantial annual payment in money or in kind in return for the enjoyment of the land. The Crown is the first overlord or superior, and land is held of it by crown vassals; they in their turn may feu their land to others, who become their vassals, whilst they themselves are mediate overlords or superiors; this process of sub-infeudation may be repeated to an indefinite extent. The Conveyancing (Scotland) Act 1874 rendered any clause in a disposition against subinfeudation null and void.Full text of the act: Casualties, which are a feature of land held in feu, are certain payments made to the superior, contingent on the happening of certain events. The most important was the payment of an amount equal to one year's feu-duty by a new holder, whether heir or purchaser of the feu. The Conveyancing Act of 1874 abolished casualties in all feus after that date, and power was given to redeem this burden on feus already existing. If the vassal does not pay the feu-duty for two years, the superior, among other remedies, may obtain by legal process a decree of irritancy, whereupon tinsel or forfeiture of the feu follows. Other Types of Scots feudal tenure There have been other forms of tenure: #Booking is a conveyance peculiar to the burgh of Paisley but does not differ essentially from feu. #Burgage is the system by which land is held in Royal Burghs. #Blench holding is by a nominal payment, as of a penny Scots, or a red rose, often only to be rendered upon demand. #Mortification, an ecclesiastical or other charitable holding in which tenure is granted ad manum mortuum, that is, inalienably and in forfeiture of all the normal superiors' casualties #Ward, the original military holding, was abolished in 1747 (20 G. II. c. 20), as an effect of the rising of 1745.

She was the largest of a class of six similar vessels ordered by the 'Secret Committee' of the East India Company. Nemesis, together with her sister ships Phlegethon, Pluto, Proserpine, Ariadne, and Medusa, was built by John Laird’s yard at Birkenhead.Marshall, Adrian G., Nemesis: The First Iron Warship and her World, The History Press, 2016, Launched in 1839, the Nemesis was deployed to China – arriving late-1839 – and used to great effect in the First Opium War and Captain William Hutcheon Hall and later in 1842 by Captain Richard Collinson. The Chinese referred to her as the \\"devil ship\\".  Construction  Although commissioned by the Secret Committee of the East India Company (EIC) in 1839, the vessel did not appear in the EIC's list of ships, leading The Times to comment: > \\"...this vessel is provided with an Admiralty letter of license or letter of > marque. If so, it can only be against the Chinese; and for the purpose of > smuggling opium she is admirably adapted.\\"The Times, 30March 1840 Nemesis was a gunboat built by British shipbuilding company John Laird's Birkenhead Iron Works in three months.Hall, William Hutcheon; Bernard, William Dallas (1845). Narrative of the Voyages and Services of the Nemesis from 1840 to 1843 (2nd ed.). Henry Colburn. p. 3. She had a length of , a beam of , a draught of when full of coal and less than 5 ft when laden with less, and a burthen of 660 tons. She was powered by two sixty horsepower Forrester engines.Headrick, Daniel R. (1981). The Tools of Empire: Technology and European Imperialism in the Nineteenth Century. Oxford University Press, New York. p. 47. . She was armed with two pivot-mounted 32-pounder and four 6-pounder guns. The steam- and sail-powered ship was particularly effective in China because her shallow draught of only five feet allowed her to travel up rivers to pursue and engage other vessels and targets. Her watertight bulkheads were the first to be used in a warship. They enabled her to survive the hull damage she sustained during sea trials and en route to China in 1840.Headrick 1981, pp. 48–49 That year, Nemesis became the first iron ship to sail around the Cape of Good Hope, aided by techniques developed the year before by Sir George Airy, the Astronomer Royal, to adjust a compass for the effect of an iron hull. The adjustments were not particularly effective, with the result that the ship's compass performed poorly throughout its career.  China  The Illustrated London News print of Nemesis during the First Opium War Nemesis and other British ships engaging Chinese junks in the Second Battle of Chuenpi, 7 January 1841 Nemesis arrived off the coast of China in late 1840, although when she set sail from Liverpool it was publicly intimated that she was bound for Odessa to keep the voyage a secret. A British officer wrote that the outbreak of the First Opium War \\"was considered an extremely favourable opportunity for testing the advantages or otherwise of iron steam- vessels.\\"Hall & Bernard 1845, p. 1 She first saw action in the Second Battle of Chuenpi on 7January 1841 against the Chinese fleet at the Bocca Tigris forts. In the Battle of First Bar (27 February), Nemesis sank Cambridge, an old, but re-armed East Indiaman that the Chinese had purchased. Due to Nemesiss shallow draught, Nemesis was able to move through shallow water during the Broadway expedition on 13–15 March and aided in the capture of Canton on 18 March. Based in Chusan, she also saw action at Taisam in February 1842, in a successful skirmish associated with repulse of a much larger Chinese attack on Ningbo.  Later career  After the First Opium War, Nemesis was tasked with the suppression of pirates in Indonesia and the Philippines. She then operated from Bombay, chiefly to Karachi.British Library: Nemesis. In May 1846 she attacked a flotilla of Sooloo pirate prows in the Brunei river, Borneo. Around the end of 1846 as a result of mob rioting in Canton which had started in July, she was posted by Sir John Davis to cover the East India Company's factory there. She was then withdrawn before February 1847, despite protests from traders. In early 1853, she helped the company's steamer Zenobia expel Burmese troops from Bassein province. She sailed from Shanghai on 1 February 1854, bound for Belfast. Laird Brothers displayed a model of the H.E.I.C. \\"Nemesis\\" (1839) at the 1893 Chicago Exhibition.  In fiction  James Clavell's novel Tai-Pan refers to a groundbreaking iron ship called Nemesis taking part in the First Opium War. However, the fictionalized vessel is a Royal Navy ship that arrived to assist in the shallow Chinese rivers that would be traversed to gain access to inland China. Flood of Fire, by Amitav Ghosh, contains a brief account of Nemesis in her role during the early battles of the First Opium War. In the book Storm and Silence by Robert Thier, it is mentioned as belonging to the East India Company's owner, a fictional character Lord Dalgliesh, the antagonist of the five-novel series, made popular through Wattpad.

He was the most prominent and best-known king of the Mahameghavahana dynasty, which is also known as the Chedi dynasty by some scholars based on a misreading of his father's name (Cheta-raja). The primary source for Kharavela is his rock-cut Hathigumpha inscription. The inscription is undated, and only four of its 17 lines are completely legible. Scholars have interpreted it differently, leading to speculation about his reign. The inscription credits the king with welfare activities, patronage of the arts, repair works, and mighty military victories which make historians agree that Kharavela was one of Kalinga's strongest rulers. He is believed to have been a follower of Hinduism, although the Hathigumpha inscription describes him as a devotee of all religions.  Background  = Sources = The Hathigumpha cave, one of the Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves Much of the available information about Kharavela comes from the undated, partially-damaged Hathigumpha inscription and several minor inscriptions found in the Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves in present-day Odisha. The Hathigumpha inscription records Kharavela's life until his 38th year, including 13 years of his reign. The inscription is badly damaged; of its 17 lines, only four are completely legible. It is open to a number of interpretations, and has given rise to speculation by various scholars. = Date = The kingdom of Kalinga was annexed by Ashoka's Maurya Empire c. 262-261 BCE. It seems to have regained independence soon after Ashoka's death, and Kharavela was born in an independent Kalinga. Although Bhagwan Lal Indraji and other scholars believe that the 16th line of the Hathigumpha inscription (which describes the 13th year of Kharavela's reign) contains a reference to the 165th year after the Mauryan era, the interpretation is controversial. Indraji says that the calculation of 165 years begins with the eighth year of Ashoka's reign, when the Kalinga war resulted in the Mauryan conquest of the kingdom. Based on this, Indraji concludes that Kharavela was born in 127 BCE and became king in 103. According to Sudhakar Chattopadhyaya, the 16th line does not mention Maurya kala (\\"Maurya era\\") but reads Mukhya kala (\\"the main era\\"). Chattopadhyaya relies on the description of Kharavela's fifth regnal year in the Hathigumpha inscription, which he says implies that Kharavela flourished ti-vasa-sata years after the Nandaraja. Hem Chandra Raychaudhuri identifies Nandaraja with Mahapadma Nanda or one of his sons. The expression ti-vasa-sata can mean 103 or 300 years; Chattopadhyaya does not consider 103 plausible, since it would contradict Ashoka's records. Based on this, he places Kharavela in the second half of the first century BCE or the first half of the first century CE. Alain Daniélou places Kharavela between 180 BCE and 130 BCE, identifying him as a contemporary of Satakarni and Pushyamitra Shunga. According to Rama Shankar Tripathi, Kharavela reigned during the third quarter of the first century BCE. = Dynasty = Kharavela's Hathigumpha inscription The first line of the Hathigumpha inscription calls Kharavela \\"Chetaraja-vasa-vadhanena\\" (चेतराज वस वधनेन, \\"the one who extended the family of the Cheta King\\"). Although \\"Chetaraja\\" probably refers to Kharavela's father and his immediate predecessor, this is uncertain. The word \\"Cheta\\" has a small crack in the stone above the letter ta (त), giving the impression of medial i. The crack misled scholars such as R. D. Banerji and D. C. Sircar to decipher the word as \\"Cheti\\" (चेति), and the conjectural reading led them to speculate that the dynasty might have descended from the one that ruled the Chedi mahajanapada. The Hathigumpha inscription also contains a word that has been interpreted as Aira or Aila. According to a small inscription found in the Mancapuri Cave, Kharavela's successor Kudepasiri also styled himself as Aira Maharaja Kalingadhipati Mahameghavahana (Devanagari: ऐर महाराजा कलिंगाधिपतिना महामेघवाहन). Early readings of that inscription by scholars such as James Prinsep and R. L. Mitra interpreted Aira as the name of the king in the Hathigumpha inscription. Indraji was the first scholar to assert that the king's name was Kharavela. According to scholars such as N. K. Sahu and B. M. Barua, Aira is the Prakrit form of the Sanskrit word Arya (\\"noble\\"), a self- designation used by the ancient Indo-Aryan peoples. Others believe that it refers to the Aila dynasty, an ancient dynasty mentioned in Hindu mythology; Kharavela's family might have claimed descent from this dynasty. = Ancestry = The Hathigumpha inscription describes Kharavela as a descendant of Mahameghavahana. It does not directly mention the relationship between Mahameghavahana and Kharavela, or the number of kings between them. Indraji interpreted the inscription to create the following hypothetical family tree: = Name = Suniti Kumar Chatterji interpreted \\"Kharavela\\" as a name of Dravidian origin, possibly derived from the words kar (\\"black and terrible\\") and vel (\\"lance\\"). Richard N. Frye, however, did not find Chatterji's etymology satisfactory. According to Braj Nath Puri, it is difficult to suggest a Dravidian cultural origin for Kharavela's dynasty or connect it to South India with certainty. N. K. Sahu also doubts this theory, saying that Kharavela and his successor Kudepasiri use the epithet \\"Aira\\" (which Sahu identifies with Sanskrit Arya).  Early life  According to the Hathigumpha inscription, Kharavela spent his first 15 years on sports and amusements. He was formally appointed the heir-apparent prince (yuvaraja) at age 16, and remained in that office for nine years. Kharavela mastered several branches of learning during that time, including royal correspondence, currency, finance, and civil and religious law.  Reign  Kharavela was crowned king of Kalinga at age 24. The Hathigumpha inscription describes the first 13 years of his reign as follows: = Later years = Kharavela's empire is believed to have disintegrated soon after his death. Only two of his successors - Vakradeva (a.k.a. Kudepasiri or Vakadepa) and Vadukha - left inscriptions. According to Bhagwan Lal, Vakradeva was probably Kharavela's son and successor. Vakradeva's inscription is found in Udayagiri, and he has the same epithets as Kharavela: Kalingadhipati (Lord of Kalinga) and Mahameghavahana (having an elephant as his carrier). Vaduka seems to be a son of Vakradeva.  Extent of the kingdom  Kharavela's inscriptions call him a Chakravartin (universal) emperor. Although his achievements were exaggerated in his inscriptions, he was one of Kalinga's strongest rulers; Kharavela's kingdom certainly included the present-day Puri and Cuttack districts of Odisha. It also included parts of present-day Visakhapatnam and Ganjam districts. According to Dietmar Rothermund and Hermann Kulke, Kharavela's empire included \\"large parts of eastern and central India\\".  Religion  The Hathigumpha inscription begins with a variation of the salute to arihants and siddhas. This is similar to the Jain Pancha-Namaskara Mantra, in which three more entities are invoked in addition to the arihants and siddhas. The inscription mentions that Kharavela brought back an idol of Agrajina to Kalinga. Many historians identify Agrajina with Rishabha, the first Jain tirthankara. Although Kharavela is believed to have been a follower of Jainism, he does not appear in Jain records. The inscription notes that he was a devotee of all religions (sava-pāsanḍa pūjako) and repaired temples dedicated to a variety of gods (sava-de[vāya]tana-sakāra- kārako); it is difficult to know to what extent Kharavela was a devout Jain. According to Helmuth von Glasenapp, he was probably a free-thinker who patronized all his subjects (including Jains).  Literature  According to Odia scholar Subrat Kumar Prusty, Kharavela's first-century BCE Hatigumpha inscription is evidence of past Odia cultural, political, ritual and social status.

The film stars Nana Patekar along with John Abraham in lead roles. It released on 24 February 2006, received positive response from critics, and was a moderate success at the box office. It a loose remake of the 2002 Hollywood film Changing Lanes. Plot Taxi No. 9 2 11 focuses on Raghav Shastri (Nana Patekar), a cab driver in Mumbai who lies to his wife about his job, pretending to be an insurance salesman. One day, he gives Jai Mittal (John Abraham), the spoilt son of a late businessman, a ride. Jai is fighting for ownership rights of his late father's estate. The cab gets into an accident with Jai escaping as he's in hurry. Jai loses the key to the vault containing his father's will in the back of Raghav's taxi. Raghav decides to hide it from Jai, who, in search for his lost item, goes to Raghav's house and tells his wife what he really does for a living. She leaves him, taking their son. Raghav decides to take revenge. Raghav and Jai vow to kill each other in their fight for their properties. When Raghav fails to kill Jai he targets Jai's girlfriend, Rupali (Sameera Reddy). As Raghav chases Rupali she is saved by Jai by hair's breadth. Jai lets Rupali escape and he attacks Raghav. They have a dirty car fight but both survive. Raghav goes to Jai's place. Jai returns to his apartment from a second court hearing regarding his father's estate in defeat, because he doesn't have his father's will. He discovers the will, torn to pieces and pasted on the wall of his apartment. Jai becomes depressed and lonely after his friends leave him. Rupali dumps him, too. Losing everything that used to be precious, Jai realises the hard-hitting life and starts respecting his father and his work. On the other side Raghav is caught again by police and taken to police station where his wife tells him his real character and problem within himself. Soon, he realises his mistake. Jai, having realised the value of close ones, then bails Raghav out of jail. Raghav insists they have a drink and they go to Jai's house for one. They find out that they share the same birthday. Raghav gives back his will, which he had hidden in the sofa, and says that he had never destroyed it -- the torn will on the wall is a fake. Raghav then goes to the railway station to stop his wife and son from leaving him, but arrives a little too late. He goes back home where he sees a birthday cake on the table. He feels that he is hallucinating, but gets a pleasant shock when he sees his wife and son standing there, singing him a birthday song (and finds out that it was Jai who brought them back). Jai confronts Arjun Bajaj (Shivaji Satam), the friend and custodian of the property of Jai's father, whom he tells that he has realised the value of life and does not want his father's property and takes a leave. Just as he drives out, his car collides with another car driven by a Woman(Priyanka Chopra), though initially both seem to be angry at each, later Jai apologizes and asks for her number, promising to pay for damages. The movie ends as both smile at each other and drive away; indicating a new romantic beginning.

Its name comes from piołun, which means wormwood in Polish. It is becoming popular due to the recent absinthe revival but has been well known before absinthe. It differs from absinthe because it is macerated and rarely distilled (see the recipe below), whereas absinthe is additionally distilled. Piołunówka is not simply an amateur's version of absinthe but can be perceived as its predecessor. For centuries wormwood-based elixirs have been used as digestive aids and disease preventatives. Piołunowka from Nisskosher company  Thujone  Piołunowka has much higher levels of thujone than absinthe because it is not distilled. Many people produce it today to try to feel the \\"absinthe effect\\" because of its higher thujone levels, although it is not well known how thujone plays a role in these purported effects and in fact is a known poison. In Poland Piołunówka is considered a cure for problems with digestive tract and is believed to enhance appetite. Therefore, traditionally it is consumed in small amounts.nalewki.rolnicy.com, About piołónówka, retrieved 26.03.2015  Availability  Piołunówka is typically hard to find outside of Poland. While wormwood is available at many herb stores, it is not always of sufficient quality for making piołunówka.  Ingredients  Apart from fresh wormwood usually some other ingredients are used such as: peppercorns, black tea, raisins, honey, geranium leaves and hypericum flowers. All herbs used should be freshly picked, not dried (apart from tea). The alcohol used is plain vodka or spirit. It can be easily produced at home, as it is generally speaking an alcohol in which herbs and other ingredients were soaked over a period of about 2 weeks and then filtered. It does not require aging.nalewki.rolnicy.com, About piołónówka, retrieved 26.03.2015zioladobrenawszystko.pl, Nalewka piołunówka, retrieved 23.03.2015  History  The recipe dates back to at least the 16th century, as Piołunówka is described in Stefan Falimierz' 1534 opus On Herbs and Their Potency (O ziolach y o moczy ich).. As such, it has traditionally been made in noble manors, though the recipes might have varied in their ingredients and preparations. The last widely available piołunówka was distilled in Lwów by J. A. Baczewski distillery up to 1939. The modern version appeared with the same label released by Polmos in Stargard Gdański who discontinued the production in the 1990s.

Population: History It was founded on October 16, 1967, after an oil field had been discovered on a small forest clearing in the middle of the taiga marshland in 1961. The main and the only big enterprise in the city, Yuganskneftegaz, was founded in February 1966. The name 'Yugansk' comes from the indigenous Khanty name of a small river near the city, neft' means oil in Russian, and gaz is natural gas. The economy of the city remains petroleum-based, and was a major center for the Russian oil enterprise YUKOS, which owned Yuganskneftegaz. In fact, the \\"Yu\\" in \\"YUKOS\\" comes from the \\"yu\\" in \\"Nefteyugansk\\" and therefore from \\"Yuganskneftegaz\\". The other three letters come from the oil-refining factory \\"Kuibyshev-Org-Sintez\\", situated in Samara. On June 26, 1998, city mayor Vladimir Petukhov was shot dead on the way to his office. Before his murder, Petukhov had been on a hunger strike demanding that the chairmen of municipal and district tax offices be dismissed from their positions and a criminal case against Yukos be filed on counts of tax evasion. Petukhov's widow later on called for an investigation into Mikhail Khodorkovsky's role in events.

The projection principle is used in the derivation of phrases under the auspices of the principles and parameters theory. Details Under the projection principle, the properties of lexical items must be preserved while generating the phrase structure of a sentence. The principle, as formulated by Chomsky in Knowledge of Language: Its Nature, Origin and Use (1986), states that \\"lexical structure must be represented categorically at every syntactic level\\" (Chomsky 1986: 84). Chomsky further defined the projection principle as \\"representations at each level of syntax(MF, D, S) are projected from the lexicon in that they observe the subcategorisation properties of lexical items.\\" This refers to the fact that every individual piece of a syntactic structure is part of a particular category (i.e. “John” is a member of the category Noun and “run” is a member of the category Verb). The Projection Principle requires that reference to these categories surfaces at every level of a syntactic phrase structure. This requires a knowledge of arguments and internal structures. “John” may be a noun, but nouns are always dominated by a determiner phrase (DP). The verb “run” does not select for the noun “John”, but rather it selects for the DP “John”. The Projection Principle simply states that when notating the syntactic structure of a sentence such as “John runs fast.”, we must specify at every level what lexical category each piece of the sentence belongs to Two common ways of notating the syntactic structure of a sentence under X-Bar Theory include bracketing and tree drawing. The bracketing for the sentence \\"john runs fast\\", generated in line with X-bar Theory, is as follows: [CP[C'[C e][TP[DP[D'[D e][NP[N'[N John ][T'[T_EPP [V run] [T -s [VP[VP D'[D ][NP[N'[N ][V'[ ][AP[A'[A fast The tree structure that this bracketing generates can be seen in the figure below. thumb With the visual aid of the tree, the projection principle can more clearly be seen. Looking at the word John (in either position) and following it up through the structure We see N (noun), followed by N' (pronounced \\"N Bar\\": an obligatory representation of the category resulting from the projection principle and X-bar Theory), followed by NP (Noun Phrase). All three of these levels are seen because the projection principle requires that the category of John, Noun, be represented throughout the structure. The verb run has an obligatory argument, its subject (a DP agent), which must appear in the sentence. The following subcategorization frame for the verb run specifies its properties. The subcategorization frame of run is as follows: :run Verb, [DP agent __ ] An adverb such as fast has its own subcategorization frame: fast Adverb, [VP_] It is out of this frame that a sentence like the following can be generated: :John runs fast. If either of these subcategorization frames are violated, so is the projection principle, and the utterance would be ill- formed: :*Runs fast. :*John fast. Before the projection principle was proposed, phrase structures were generated in separation from the properties of lexical entries. These were hypothesized to enter the slots in pre- generated structures waiting to be filled by the lexical material. According to more recent theories, phrase structures are not generated by phrase structure rules, but are \\"projected\\" from the lexical entries. The projection principle therefore obviates the need for phrase structure rules in the generative component. In 1982, Noam Chomsky proposed the extended projection principle as an addendum to the projection principle. Locality of Selection Locality of Selection states that properties of lexical items must be satisfied locally within their domain. The local domain is characterized by being the smallest XP with a subject (WP). The properties of the constituent are chosen by the constituent head. A constituent will be incorrect if the lexical requirements are not satisfied. Locality of Selection ensures that when the projection principle occurs, it is satisfied locally (This explains why in the above example; N, N', and NP appear immediately above John). We see examples of this with certain verbs. With a verb such as “hit” you need a DP that it selects for: *Mary hit Mary hit [DP the ball] In a local domain there are three main levels. The head (X) of the local domain is at the bottom which projects up to and X bar level and then to the XP level. Each head can select for a complement. The X bar level can select for a specifier and the XP level can select for an adjunct. This makes up the basic structure of a local domain. The components of the tree are organized hierarchically. Along with this, the adjunct (YP), specifier (WP) and complement (ZP) are all optional and only used when required thumb An important thing to acknowledge is that adjuncts are distinct from specifiers and complements in that you can essentially add unlimited adjuncts. An adjunct must be adjoined to the local XP that it is modifying and cannot be referring to another XP in the sentence. Heads can only take a select few number of complements and a complement must be adjacent to its head. There is a direct relationship between the head and its complement: in other words, a head subcategorises for a complement. A subcategorization frame helps you determine what kind of complement it is. This does not mean, however, that a head must take a complement since there can be zero complements. A head determines the properties of the phrase through projection. Locality, then, shows the local relationship in which the head projects an X-bar level and an XP -phrasal level. X-bar theory derives a hierarchical vertical structure where XP dominates X’ and X’ dominates X. But the linearity in which complements, specifiers and adjuncts attach can be changed based on the language. Head-initial languages will have the head precede the complement, like in English. Head-final languages, like Japanese and Korean, have the head following the complement. In this way, X-bar theory allows for variation across languages with some having an SOV (subject, object, verb) order while others have an SVO order. Along with this, there are also some language universals that are seen repeatedly in a variety of different languages around the world. When a phrase or head is in a relationship that is non-local to what selects for it, we see a violation of locality of selection. The underlying structure will need to satisfy selection requirements and locality of selection. But, we also see selection requirements being met through movement. This is especially noticeable when a DP raises to Spec TP through the Extended Projection Principle (EPP). Extended Projection Principle The Extended Projection Principle (EPP) refers to the highest Tense Phrase containing a subject. Before the EPP can be satisfied, you must ensure that LOS is satisfied. Once all of the projection principles of LOS are satisfied, EPP is activated when there is movement from one part of the tree to another. This movement allows for the TP to contain a subject. When generating the tree we must first ensure that all areas of the LOS are correctly projected. This is the tree we would generate to ensure that LOS has been completely satisfied. However, in this tree the EPP is not satisfied as there is no subject present in the TP position. thumb In order to satisfy the EPP we must move the DP John into spec TP, to allow for the TP subject to be filled By moving the DP we are altering the sentence making it John will Run. The EPP will now be satisfied as the DP John is now in the subject position of the TP. thumb See also * Extended Projection Principle * Constituent * X-bar Theory * Phrase Structure Rules * Subcategorization References Category:Grammar Category:Noam Chomsky ","title":"Projection principle"},{"id":"3920403","text":"Judgment summons, in English law, a summons issued under the Debtors' Act 1869,Regnal 32 & 33 Vic., c. 62 on the application of a creditor who has obtained a judgment for the payment of a sum of money by instalments or otherwise, where the order for payment has not been complied with. The judgment summons cites the defendant to appear personally in court, and be examined on oath as to the means he has, or has had, since the date of the order or judgment made against him, to pay the same, and to show cause why he should not be committed to prison for his default. An order of commitment obtained in a judgment summons remains in force for a year only, and the extreme term of imprisonment is six weeks, dating from the time of lodging in prison. When a debtor has once been imprisoned, although for a period of less than six weeks, no second order of commitment can be made against him in respect of the same debt. But if the judgment be for payment by instalments a power of committal arises on default of payment for each instalment. However, if an order of commitment has never been executed, or becomes inoperative through lapse of time, a fresh commitment may be made. Imprisonment does not operate as a satisfaction or extinguishment of a debt, or deprive a person of a right of execution against the land or goods of the person imprisoned in the same manner as there had been no imprisonment. In this regard the judgement summons procedure may be seen as a more extreme—because of the threat of imprisonment—version of the procedure under the Civil Procedure RulesCPR Part 71 procedure to obtain information from judgment debtors.

The Hathigumpha Inscription consists of seventeen lines in a Central-Western form of Prakrit incised in a deep-cut Brahmi script on the overhanging brow of a natural cavern called Hathigumpha in the southern side of the Udayagiri hill, near Bhubaneswar in Odisha. It faces straight towards the Rock Edicts of Ashoka at Dhauli, situated at a distance of about six miles. It is said to be one of the earliest biographical sketches of a king in India. The inscription is dated 13th year of Kharavela's reign, which has been dated variously by scholars from the 2nd century BCE to the 1st century CE. Paleographically, the inscription dates from mid-1st century BCE to early 1st century CE. Background The Hathigumpha Inscription is the main source of information about Kalinga ruler Kharavela. This inscription, consisting of seventeen lines has been incised in deep cut Brahmi script of the 1st century CE, on the overhanging brow of a natural cavern called Hathigumpha, in the southern side of the Udayagiri hill. It faces straight towards the Rock Edicts of Ashoka at Dhauli situated at a distance of about six miles. It was introduced to the Western world by A. Stirling in 1820, who published an eye copy of it in Asiatic Researches, XV, as well as in his book An Account, Geographical, Statistical and Historical of Orissa or Cuttack and by James Prinsep, who deciphered the inscription. Prinsep's reading along with the facsimile prepared by Kittoe was Published in the Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal, VI (1837), where he erroneously attributed this inscription to a king named Aira. Towards the end of 1871, a plaster-cast of the inscription was prepared by H. Locke, which is now preserved in the Indian Museum, Calcutta. Alexander Cunningham published this inscription in 1877 in the Corpus Inscriptionum Indicarum Vol. I, and in 1880 R.L. Mitra published a slightly modified version in his Antiquities of Orissa, Vol. II. Bhagwan Lal Indraji is credited with the first authentic reading, which he presented before the Sixth International Congress of Orientalists, 1885. Pandit Indraji was the first scholar to declare that the king eulogised in the Hathigumpha inscription was named Kharavela.

The Rathika and Bhojaka chiefs with their crown cast off, their umbrella and royal insignia thrown aside, and their Jewelry and wealth confiscated, were, made to pay obeisance at the feet (of His Majesty). * And in the fifth year, (His Majesty) caused the aqueducts that had been excavated by king Nanda three hundred years before, to flow into [Kalinga] Nagri through Tanasuli. * And in the seventh year of his reign (the Queen) of Vajiraghara, blessed with a son attained motherhood. * In the 8th year of his reign, he attacked Rajagriha in Magadha and forced a Yavana king to retreat to Mathura: Actual, fairly damaged portion, and the disputed reading 𑀫𑀥𑀼𑀭𑀁𑀅𑀧𑀬𑀢𑁄𑀬𑀯𑀦𑀭𑀸𑀚𑀸𑀤𑀺𑀫𑀺𑀢 \\"Madhuraṁ apayāto Yavana-rāj[ā] D[i]mi[ta]\\" (\\"The Yavana king Demetrius retreated to Mathura\\"). This reading is considered as \\"extremely doubtful\\". :The name of the Yavana king is not clear, but it contains three letters, and the middle letter can be read as ma or mi. R. D. Banerji and K.P. Jayaswal read the name of the Yavana king as \\"Dimita\\", and identify him with Demetrius I of Bactria. However, according to Ramaprasad Chanda, this identification results in \\"chronological impossibilities\\". According to Sailendra Nath Sen, the Yavana ruler was certainly not Demerius; he might have been a later Indo-Greek ruler of eastern Punjab. Numismatist P.L. Gupta interprets the name as \\"Vimaka\\", and identifies him with Vima Kadphises.Kusâna Coins and History, D.K. Printworld, 1994, p.184, note 5; reprint of a 1985 article However, Vima Kadphises was a Kushana, not Yavana, king. It is otherwise unknown for a Kushan emperor to have been referred to as a Yavana, and for Vima Kadphises to be referred to as \\"Vimaka\\". Also, there are palaeographic problems with dating the Hathigumpha inscription to Vima Kadphises' period. * In the 12th year of his reign, he attacked the king of Uttarapatha. Then brought back the holy idols of Kalinga's Jain Gods (The Blessed Tirthankars) which earlier Magadha rulers had carried away with them after Kalinga War in Past. Tirthankar's idol was brought back with its crown and endowment and the jewels plundered by king Nanda from the Kalinga royal palace, along with the treasures of Anga and Magadha were regained. * He then attacks the kingdom of Magadha, and in Pataliputra, the capital of the Shunga Empire, makes king \\"Bahasatimita\\" (thought to be the Shunga King Brhaspatimitra, or Pushyamitra himself) bow at his feet.

Joseph Isaac Spadafora Whitaker (19 March 1850 in Palermo – 3 November 1936 in Rome) was a Sicilian-English ornithologist, archaeologist and sportsman. He is a member of the Whitaker family. He is mainly known for his work on the birds of Tunisia, and for being involved in the foundation of the Sicilian football club US Città di Palermo. Biography  Whitaker's family came from Huddersfield in west Yorkshire.Whitaker Family He inherited the Ingham Marsala wine business through his paternal grandmother Mary Ingham whose brother Benjamin(1784-1861) went into business in Palermo. The Inghams were from Ossett in Yorkshire - there is an Ossett website which gives a detailed biography of the Ingham Marsala Wine co. =Inheritance of the Vineyard Empire= He inherited vast vineyards and his great grandfather Ingham's banking empire. Choosing Palermo over the more provincial Marsala, he built the Villa Malfitano, an Italian Art Nouveau mansion near Zisa Castle on the Via Dante after his marriage to Tina Scalia. Tina was the daughter of General Alfonso Scalia who landed in Sicily with Giuseppe Garibaldi during the years leading up to the Risorgimento. They had two daughters; the elder of which married General Antonio Di Giorgio(1868-1932) an Italian Minister of War who fought in the 1st and 2nd wars in Abyssinia. Thus the family was firmly established in the upper echelons of Italian Society. In these years, the Belle Époque age, the house was the venue for lavish parties attended by British and Italian royalty and celebrated European society. Tina Whitaker knew Richard Wagner, Benito Mussolini, the Kaiser and Edward VII, Empress Eugenie and Queen Mary. Attracted by homosexual company, she unwittingly found herself in a circle involved in the Irish Crown Jewels scandal. Whitaker himself was founder and president of the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals at Palermo, and also he was a major figure in the foundation of US Città di Palermo in the later 1880s, becoming the first president of the football club. =Birds= In 1891 already a very keen ornithologist Whitaker joined the British Ornithologists' Union. Collecting expeditions to Tunisia followed. These extended over a period of ten years (1894–1904). Notebooks kept at the time contain information on the natural history of the birds as well as other fauna and also the flora of Tunisia. The Tunisian bird and bird nest and egg collection was housed in a villa in the grounds of his home \\"Malfitano\\" alongside a very complete collection of Sicilian birds and collections made on his behalf by Edward Dobson in Morocco. To these were added specimens of birds from the Mediterranean littoral. Some of Whitaker's collection of Tunisian birds are in the Natural History Museum, London. The Sicilian birds are divided between the Royal Scottish Museum (bird skins) and the Ulster Museum (bird mounts, eggs and nests). =Gallery of Birds in the Whitaker Collection= Image:Egyptian Nightjar.jpgEgyptian nightjar Image:Baillon's Crake.jpgBaillon's crake Image:Great BustardLg1438.jpegGreat bustard Image:Glossy Ibis Lg1300.jpegGlossy ibis Image:Eurasian WryneckLg670.jpegEurasian wryneck Image:Eurasian Thic- kneeLg1285.jpegEurasian thick-knee Image:Egyptian VultureLg1605.jpegEgyptian vulture Image:White-winged snowfinch Lg741.jpegWhite-winged snowfinch Image:Spotted Sandgrouse.jpegSpotted sandgrouse Image:Wall Creeper.jpegWallcreeper Image:White-winged Tern.jpegWhite-winged tern Image:Short-toed Snake Eagle.jpegShort-toed snake eagle Image:Rustic Bunting.jpegDusky thrush Image:Rosy Starling.jpegRosy starling Image:Rock Partridge.jpegRock partridge Image:Rock Bunting.jpegRock bunting Image:Greater Spotted Eagle.jpegGreater spotted eagle Image:Grey-headed Woodpecker.jpegGrey-headed woodpecker Image:Red-footed Falcon.jpegRed-footed falcon Image:Red Crossbill.jpegRed crossbill Image:Pallid Harrier.jpegPallid harrier Image:Middle-spotted Woodpecker.jpegMiddle spotted woodpecker Image:Long-tailed Tit.jpegLong-tailed tit Image:Little Crake.jpegLittle crake Image:Cirl Bunting.jpegCirl bunting Image:Black Woodpecker.jpegBlack woodpecker =Archaeology= Whitaker devoted the last years of his life to archaeology, purchasing the island of Motya near Trapani the site of a Phoenician town founded in the eighth century BC. He wrote a book on his excavations in 1921. The site may be explored (online) using the Motya link. Works *Sulla migrazione degli uccelli, specialmente in Sicilia.

It can have a specific religious content, but also more recently has been associated with modern composers who use meditation techniques in their process of composition, or who compose such music with no particular religious group as a focus. The concept also includes music performed as an act of meditation. History Modern meditation music in the 20th century began when composers such as John Cage, Stuart Dempster, Pauline Oliveros, Terry Riley, La Monte Young and Lawrence Ball began to combine meditation techniques and concepts, and music. Specific works include Tony Scott's Music for Zen Meditation (1964), Karlheinz Stockhausen's Inori (1974), Mantra (1970), Hymnen (1966–67), Stimmung (1968), and Aus den sieben Tagen (1968), Olivier Messiaen's Quartet for the End of Time (1941), and Ben Johnston, whose Visions and Spells (a realization of Vigil (1976)), requires a meditation period prior to performance. R. Murray Schafer's concepts of clairaudience (clean hearing) as well as the ones found in his The Tuning of the World (1977) are meditative . Stockhausen describes Aus den sieben Tagen as \\"intuitive music\\" and in the piece \\"Es\\" from this cycle the performers are instructed to play only when not thinking or in a state of nonthinking (Von Gunden asserts that this is contradictory and should be \\"think about your playing\\"). John Cage was influenced by Zen and pieces such as Imaginary Landscape No. 4 for twelve radios are \\"meditations that measure the passing of time\\" . Christian meditation music Some Christian faiths, particularly the Catholic Church, reject meditation practice from outside their traditions, particularly new-age music (; ; ; ). However, the Olivier Messiaen piece referenced above is explicitly Christian, and Messiaen himself was a practicing Catholic and a church organist.

The town lies at the southern tip of the Drakensberg on the Langkloofspruit, a tributary of the Kraai River which, in turn is a tributary of the Orange River at an elevation of 1 790 meter (5 873 foot) above sealevel. Barkly East is characterized by rugged mountains and green valleys. Snow falls in winter, and the hamlet of Rhodes is 60 km or an hour's drive from Barkly East on the R396. Both are within the boundaries of the Senqu Local Municipality. It has been one of the few areas in South Africa where winter sports are pursued, and in summer fly fishing for Rainbow trout and indigenous Smallmouth yellowfish, trail running, mountain biking, ancient rock-art, tennis and the magnificent scenery draw tourists to the district. A recent development is the mountainous terrain attracting off- road bikers who revel in traversing the numerous passes in the area. Even more recent is the opening of the winter fly fishing season on Wild Trout Association waters around Barkly East, Lady Grey, Rhodes and Wartrail. Xhosa and Afrikaans are spoken by most of the inhabitants, while English and some Sotho are also spoken. The primary economic base of the district is sheep- farming, the pasturage being excellent. History Like Barkly West, the town is named after Sir Henry Barkly, governor of the Cape Colony from 1870 to 1877. On 14 December 1874 the then-Governor, Sir Henry Barkly proclaimed that a town could split from Wodehouse. Among the first families that settled in Barkly East were the Nels, Bothas, Oliviers, Murrays, Smits, Sephtons, Giddys, Isteds, Orpens, Nortons, Greyvensteins, Stapelbergs, Vorsters and the Jouberts and Cloetes of Constantia. But it was a Mr HS Nel who was the first white person that settled in this area. The area is well known for excellent trout fishing. A variety of caves contain rock paintings by the San that date back hundreds of years, and visitors interested in San art can stay at cottages on local farms. The Cloete-Joubert Hospital The Provincial hospital in Barkly East is a living monument for Mr. Piet Joubert by his wife who was a Cloete and daughter of one of the wealthiest cattle farmers in South Africa, CWP Cloete of Glen Almond. The Joubert couple had no children, and after her death she intended to donate her money to a hospital. But Mr. Greyvenstein, who was her lawyer, persuaded her to keep the Cloete money in the area. As such, a small hospital was planned. The total cost of the hospital was £100 000 of which £80 000 came from the Joubert couple. The hospital was opened by the minister Sauer and by Dollie Cloete (the granddaughter of CWP Cloete by his first wife). Geography =Climate= Barkly East has a subtropical highland climate (Cwb, according to the Köppen climate classification), with mild summers and chilly, dry winters, with occasional snowfalls. It borders on a cold semi-arid climate (BSk). The average annual precipitation is , with most rainfall occurring during summer.

He was the youngest child of Giles Vanbrugh, a London cloth merchant and later a sugar merchant in Chester, and his wife Elizabeth, née Carleton, herself youngest child of Sir Dudley Carleton and Lucy, née Croft. Vanbrugh's brothers included Captain Charles Vanbrugh RN MP and Sir John Vanbrugh, architect and dramatist. Philip Vanbrugh married Mary Griffith in Arnold, Nottinghamshire on 24 July 1715 and they had one known child, Philippia, born 1716, la belle consulesse, who married Burrington Goldsworthy of Down House, Dorset, British consul at Leghorn, Italy and later at Cadiz. Their son, Lieutenant-General Philip Goldsworthy, became a favoured equerry to King George III and from 1772 his unmarried sister, Martha Caroline was sub-governess, under Lady Charlotte Finch, of the 15 royal children.Princes in the Making, a study of royal education, Morris Marples, Faber & Faber 1965  Career  The Battle of Cape Passaro. Vanbrugh commanded a ship at the battle. Philip Vanbrugh entered the navy, and after some years of service, was on 27 November 1710 appointed to command the 28-gun . In 1716 he was in command of the 32-gun , and was sent to Gibraltar.

Like many of the ships in that fleet Breda had suffered badly from worms attacking the hull, and she was broken up in 1730.

The Brut line would grow to include aftershave, balms, and deodorant. Packaged in a green glass bottle with a silver-coloured medallion, it is still sold as of 2020. History In 1968, a budget range was marketed as Brut 33 because it contained 33% of the fragrance of the original product. Packaged in cheaper plastic bottles, it was described by the company as a \\"lighter fragrance.\\" Fabergé was taken over by Unilever in 1989, and transferred to the Chesebrough-Pond's division in 1989. There the Brut 33 range took over the name Brut. The Fabergé version became \\"Brut Classic by Fabergé\\" and retained its distinctive packaging. In 2003, the rights to the brand were purchased for some regions by Idelle Laboratories, a division of Helen of Troy Limited. Apart from some regions, Unilever sells Brut around the world with big markets in the United Kingdom, France and Far East. Australia produces its own Brut aftershave which is purported to have a slightly different scent. In Brazil, there is a Brut branded lather shaving cream in tube with the classic Brut fragrance. Called \\"The Essence of Man\\" in its advertising, Brut is marketed in the United States as representing traditional masculine strength of character. Sponsorship of the NHRA and of driver Ron Capps highlights fatherhood, teamwork, and courage as hallmarks of the user. It is sold in drugstores. Celebrity endorsements The star of the 1970s United Kingdom advertising campaign was boxer Henry Cooper who used the slogan \\"splash it all over\\". Motor Cycle World Champion Barry Sheene, athlete David Hemery, show-jumper Harvey Smith and footballer Kevin Keegan also appeared in the campaigns. In Germany the brand was endorsed in the 1970s by famous football player Franz Beckenbauer. The footballer Paul Gascoigne also starred in an advertising campaign although he was later dropped amid domestic violence allegations made by his ex-wife. In 1973, Allan Moffat drove a Brut 33 sponsored Ford Mustang in the Australian Touring Car Championship followed by a Brut 33 sponsored XB Ford Falcon GT in 1974. Popular culture When he acted out the role of James Bond, Roger Moore once used an aerosol version similar to this deodorant for self-defence in Live and Let Die by touching the ignited end of a cigar he was smoking to the aerosol spray and thus improvising a crude flamethrower, since the propellant chemicals are flammable. In 2015, Jim Harbaugh was quoted saying \\"I've been a Brut man since I was 10 years old.\\" Also Elvis Presley used Brut.https://celebrityfragranceguide.com/what-cologne-does-he-wear/elvis- presley Acquisitions In 2006, after acquiring partial ownership of the Brut copyright and patents, Idelle Laboratories launched Brut Revolution, an \\"ozonic\\" variant on the core fragrance. \\"As Different As You Are\\" is the theme of the fragrance, which is housed in a blue and silver bottle, breaking with the traditional green of the original. Fragrances Apart from Brut original, the range has grown in recent years with new fragrances such as Oceans, Identity, Revolution, Instinct, Musk, and Passion. The whole range is available in roll-on, spray, after shave, splash-on, shower gel, and Eau de Toilette.

For example, knowledge gained while learning to recognize cars could apply when trying to recognize trucks. This area of research bears some relation to the long history of psychological literature on transfer of learning, although formal ties between the two fields are limited. From the practical standpoint, reusing or transferring information from previously learned tasks for the learning of new tasks has the potential to significantly improve the sample efficiency of a reinforcement learning agent. History In 1993, Lorien Pratt published a paper on transfer in machine learning, formulating the discriminability-based transfer (DBT) algorithm. In 1997, the journal Machine Learning published a special issue devoted to transfer learning, and by 1998, the field had advanced to include multi-task learning,Caruana, R., \\"Multitask Learning\\", pp. 95-134 in along with a more formal analysis of its theoretical foundations.Baxter, J., \\"Theoretical Models of Learning to Learn\\", pp. 71-95 Learning to Learn, edited by Pratt and Sebastian Thrun, is a 1998 review of the subject. Transfer learning has also been applied in cognitive science, with the journal Connection Science publishing a special issue on reuse of neural networks through transfer in 1996. Andrew Ng said in his NIPS 2016 tutorial Nuts and bolts of building AI applications using Deep Learning, slides that TL will be the next driver of ML commercial success after supervised learning to highlight the importance of TL.  Definition  The definition of transfer learning is given in terms of domains and tasks. A domain \\\\mathcal{D} consists of: a feature space \\\\mathcal{X} and a marginal probability distribution P(X), where X = \\\\\\\\{x_1,...,x_n\\\\\\\\} \\\\in \\\\mathcal{X}. Given a specific domain, \\\\mathcal{D} = \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathcal{X}, P(X)\\\\\\\\}, a task consists of two components: a label space \\\\mathcal{Y} and an objective predictive function f:\\\\mathcal{X} \\\\rightarrow \\\\mathcal{Y} . The function f is used to predict the corresponding label f(x) of a new instance x. This task, denoted by \\\\mathcal{T} = \\\\\\\\{\\\\mathcal{Y}, f(x)\\\\\\\\}, is learned from the training data consisting of pairs \\\\\\\\{x_i, y_i\\\\\\\\}, where x_i \\\\in X and y_i \\\\in \\\\mathcal{Y}. 50px Material was copied from this source, which is available under a Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International License.

In 2020 it was discovered that, due to their similar physical natures, transfer learning is possible between Electromyographic (EMG) signals from the muscles when classifying the behaviours of Electroencephalographic (EEG) brainwaves from the gesture recognition domain to the mental state recognition domain. It was also noted that this relationship worked vice versa, showing that EEG can likewise be used to classify EMG in addition. The experiments noted that the accuracy of neural networks and convolutional neural networks were improved through transfer learning both at the first epoch (prior to any learning, ie. compared to standard random weight distribution) and at the asymptote (the end of the learning process). That is, algorithms are improved by exposure to another domain.

Several places still bear the name: the township of North Bergen; Bergen Square, Old Bergen Road, Bergen Avenue, Bergen Junction, Bergen Hill and Bergen Arches in Jersey City; Bergen Point in Bayonne; and Bergenline Avenue and Bergen Turnpike in North Hudson. New Netherland The name Bergen was originally given to the peninsula between the Hudson River and Hackensack River by the European settlers to New Netherland. There are various opinions as to the origin. Some believe it comes from the Dutch word bergen, which in the Germanic languages of northern Europe means hills, and could describe the most distinct geological feature of the region, The Palisades.Indigenous Population A more farfetched interpretation is that it comes from the Dutch word bergen, meaning to save or to recover, inspired by the settlers return after they had fled attacks by the native population after the Peach Tree War in 1655. Others say it is so called for the town of Bergen, North Holland in the Netherlands or (less likely) Bergen op Zoom, also in the Netherlands or the city of Bergen in Norway.http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~njhudson/genhistory_hudson_bergen_2.html. Another theory is that the Dutch residents named their city after an early Scandinavian settler of New Amsterdam, Hans Hansen Bergen, who arrived in Manhattan in 1633 as a ship's carpenter. Bergen initially settled on Pearl Street in Lower Manhattan and later owned extensive plantations elsewhere on the island, none of which were in Bergen Township.The Bergen Family, or the Descendants of Hans Hansen Bergen, Teunis Bergen, 1866 From Bergen, Norway, he was one of the few Scandinavian settlers of New Amsterdam.Hans Hansen Bergen, Genealogical and Personal Memorial of Mercer County, New Jersey, Francis Bazley Lee, 1907 Previous European settlements in present-day Hudson County included a small town called Communipaw (at the current Liberty Science Center) and other settlements that were all within Pavonia, which included only the lands surrounding of Harsimus Island (Harsimus), Aressick (Paulus Hook) and Hobocan Hacking (Hoebuck), all of which had been burned to the ground twice after an unprovoked massacre of Native Americans in 1643 at Communipaw and a series of raids and reprisals between the Netherlanders and the Lenape that followed, in what is known as Kieft's War and the Peach Tree War. In late 1654 a series of land grants were made for farms for lands at Achter Col behind Kill Van Kull.History of New Netherland, E.B. Callaghan (c)1855 In 1658, Peter Stuyvesant, Director-General of New Netherland, negotiated a deal with the Lenape, and re-purchased the area, naming it Bergen, \\"by the great rock above Wiehacken,\\" then taking in the sweep of land on the peninsula west of the Hudson and east of the Hackensack River extending down to the Kill Van Kull at Bergen Point and Constable Hook.History of the County of Hudson, New Jersey, from Its Earliest Settlement to the Present Time, p. 62, accessed March 29, 2007 Bergen was founded by settlers who wished to return to the west bank of Hudson's River and located the village at what is today's Bergen Square. Its semi-independent government was granted on September 5, 1661, by Stuyvesant, as part of his efforts regain a foothold on the North River's western shore and expand beyond New Amsterdam on the southern tip of Manhattan, under the condition that a garrison be built. It is the first permanent European settlement and oldest municipality in what would become the state of New Jersey.Jersey City: America's Golden Door, accessed March 19, 2007. \\"Jersey City, the second largest city in New Jersey, is the site of the first permanent European community in the state.\\" It became and remained the seat of government for the province until 1709, when the British moved it to Hackensack, which was seen as more centrally located.JERSEY CITY HISTORY OF FORMS OF GOVERNMENT FROM EARLY DUTCH DAYS TO THE PRESENT TIME, accessed March 19, 2007.\\"Until 1709, Bergen Village (around Bergen Square, Jersey City) was the county seat and the sessions of the court were held there, but after this date, the village of Hackensack was designated as being more centrally located and more easily reached by the majority of the inhabitants, and hence was chosen as the county seat of Bergen County (which it remains) and the courts were moved there.\\"  Colonial America  In 1664, a negotiated surrender gave control of New Netherland to the English and on September 22, 1668, the original town charter was confirmed by Philip Carteret, the first English provincial Governor of New Jersey.\\"The Story of New Jersey's Civil Boundaries: 1606-1968\\", John P. Snyder, Bureau of Geology and Topography; Trenton, New Jersey; 1969. p. 145. The Treaty of Westminster finalized the Dutch capitulation in 1674, and the area officially became part of the proprietary colony of East Jersey. In 1675, it was divided in four administrative districts, or counties: Essex, Middlesex, Monmouth, and Bergen. On March 7, 1683, the garrison/village at Bergen and surrounding areas became a town within Bergen County. In 1710, when Bergen County, by royal decree of Queen Anne of Great Britain, was enlarged to include what had been part of Essex County, the village of Hackensack (in the newly formed Township of New Barbadoes) was seen as being more easily reached by the majority of Bergen County's inhabitants, and hence was chosen as the county seat (as it remains today). Bergen was re-established by royal charter on January 4, 1714. Bergen Township was created by the New Jersey Legislature's Township Act of 1798 on February 21, 1798, as one of the first group of 104 townships formed in New Jersey. Bergen County was thus split into two parts: Bergen Township to the south, and Hackensack Township to the north. As originally constituted, Bergen Township included the area between the Hudson River on the east, the Hackensack River to the west, south to Constable Hook and north to the present-day southern border of Bergen County. Secession and dissolution During its 200-year history the township was diminished in size through various secessions until it finally dissolved. On January 28, 1820, Jersey City was formed within Bergen Township, and in 1838, was reincorporated as a city independent of Bergen Township. On February 22, 1840, the New Jersey Legislature created Hudson County from southern portions of Bergen County. The new county included the entirety of the original Bergen Township (including Jersey City) and the portions of Lodi Township south of today's Paterson Plank Road, an area known as New Barbadoes Neck. Portions of the township were taken to form Van Vorst Township (April 12, 1841, annexed by Jersey City on March 18, 1851), North Bergen Township (April 10, 1843), Bergen town (March 24, 1855, ultimately annexed by Jersey City on May 2, 1870) and Bayonne Township (April 1, 1861). The remaining portions of the township were absorbed by Bergen town, in a sort of reverse takeover, and the township was dissolved on March 11, 1862. North Bergen was incorporated as a township on April 10, 1843, by an act of the New Jersey Legislature, from Bergen Township. Portions of the township have been taken to form Hoboken Township (April 9, 1849, now the city of Hoboken), Hudson Town (April 12, 1852, later part of Hudson City), Hudson City (April 11, 1855, later annexed by Jersey City), Guttenberg (formed within the township on March 9, 1859, and set off as an independent municipality on April 1, 1878), Weehawken (March 15, 1859), Union Township and West Hoboken Township (both created on February 28, 1861), Union Hill town (March 29, 1864) and Secaucus (March 12, 1900).

The company and its products are remembered today by the Norman Cycles Club Norman Motor Cycles Club at Willesborough Windmill, in Willesborough, Ashford. The Norman museum is in the Windmill's barn and displays some of the company's mopeds and bicycles. History The company was founded shortly after World War I as the Kent Plating & Enamelling Co by brothers Charles and Fred Norman, making frames in a garden shed off Jemmett Road, Ashford. In the 1920s they moved to larger premises in Victoria Road, Ashford, and progressed to producing cycles. In 1935 they had a factory built in Beaver Road, Ashford, and the company was renamed Norman Cycles Limited. In 1938 it produced an autocycle (a heavier- duty bicycle with a small engine - later commonly known as a moped). In addition to cycles the company went on to produce mopeds and light motorbikes (with motors supplied by manufacturers including Villiers, British Anzani; Sachs engines were used for the Norman Nippy moped). The company produced many thousands of cycles and motorbikes. Weekly production was said to peak at 5,000 bikes, 600 mopeds and 120 motorbikes. It exported to Commonwealth countries using the Rambler trademark. The company had sporting success. By 1950 Norman Cycles had been acquired by Tube Investments, which used the Raleigh name for cycles. The Ashford factory closed in 1961. Although products bearing the Norman name continued to be made (Nottingham for cycles and Smethwick for mopeds and motorbikes), the heyday had passed and the name ceased in sales literature after 1963. In tribute, a road close to the site of the 1935 factory is named Norman Road.

The corps was first formed in 1865 and began operations in March 1866. It was inspired by the Liverpool Salvage Corps which had been formed in 1842, to reduce the loss and damage caused by fires, to help mitigate the effects of fire and of fire-fighting and to salvage both premises and goods affected by fire. History The London Salvage Corps (LSC) had been around for as long as London's first properly organised fire brigade. The London Fire Engine Establishment had been created and maintained by the principal fire insurance offices of London. The London Fire Engine Establishment, established in 1833 under the command of Superintendent James Braidwood, had undertaken salvage work as part of its normal everyday fire extinguishing duties. Following Braidwood's death at the great Tooley Street fire in 1861, and the arrival of Captain Eyre Massey Shaw, a new fire brigade for London was required. It was created in 1866 and called the Metropolitan Fire Brigade, still with Captain Shaw as its first Chief Officer. However, the Metropolitan Fire Brigade Act 1865 was vague enough to enable the Metropolitan Board of Works, who controlled the new brigade at the time, to refuse responsibility for any salvage work without payment. The amount sought by the Metropolitan Board of Works for this service exceeded that for which an independent salvage corps could be maintained by the fire offices themselves. Therefore, it was decided at a meeting of the London Fire Engine Establishment on 22 December 1865 to establish a salvage corps independent of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade. The London Salvage Corps was founded by John Brookes Johnston of the Royal Insurance Company.John Brookes Johnston (1818–1896), Modern English Biography, Frederic Boase, volume 5 The London Salvage Corps commenced operations during January 1866. The original subscribers to the London Salvage Corps were the Alliance, Atlas, Globe, Imperial, London, Protector, Royal Exchange, Sun, Union and Westminster fire offices, but membership varied subsequently. The London Salvage Corps was maintained, and overseen by the fire offices of London. The staff of the corps, when formed, consisted of 64 salvagemen and officers. Since that time, owing to the many improvements that had taken place in the system of dealing with salvage, and the increase in the work to be done, the corps was strengthened, and the staff increased to 112 by the early 1970s. The various stations of the LSC were strategically placed, and \\"the Metropolis has been mapped out so that when a fire takes place it may be attended to at the earliest possible moment.\\" The early working staff (like its fire brigade counterparts) were mainly recruited from the navy. They consisted of the chief (salvage) officer and a superintendent, foreman and crew of men at each salvage station. The stations of the corps were initially connected by telegraph but were later connected by telephone with the fire brigade stations from whence the calls were received. In addition to the station staff, there were also salvage staff constantly employed during the daytime in inspecting docks, wharves, goods and London warehouses, with regular reports made weekly to the Insurance Committee.  Headquarters and station locations *No. 1 Station (B District) - headquarters situated at Watling Street - protected the City of London enclosed by Euston Road, Tottenham Court Road, City Road and the river Thames *No. 2 Station (C District) - located on Commercial Road - covered whole of the eastern and north-eastern portion of London to the north of the Thames *No. 3 Station (D District), opposite the headquarters of the Metropolitan Fire Brigade Station in Southwark Bridge Road, protected the whole of south London *No. 4 station (A District), on Shaftesbury Avenue, covered the West End and Kensington This station transferred to the London Fire Brigade and became their Soho Fire Station. Following wartime Bomb damage, it remained in use until 1983. *No. 5 station, in Upper Street, Islington, protected the parish of Islington A new headquarters was constructed for the London Salvage Corps at Aldersgate Street in 1960. Following the disbanding of the service in the 1980s, it transferred to the London Fire Brigade. The building was subsequently demolished and the site is now an office building =Advances in the Salvage Corps= The last horse drawn salvage tender was withdrawn in 1923, two years after the last of the London Fire Brigade's horses were retired from service at Kensington fire station. By May 1936 the LSC fleet consisted of seven Leyland 3-tonners that had been in operation since 1923. It also had a 30-cwt and a 5-cwt. van; the larger used for carrying extra waterproof clothes and other gear, whilst the smaller vehicle could be used for taking first-aid gear to smaller outbreaks and thus save the expense of turning out a major tender. One of the LSC tenders, which carried a crew of two, was equipped with a portable pump used for pumping out basements which had been flooded. =Services at fires= Services at fires formed the most important feature of the work. Much depended upon the method of dealing with the salvage. If, for instance, the upper part of a large Manchester goods warehouse was on fire, it would be of very little advantage to the offices interested in the risk if the men were set to work removing stock from the ground floor. The best method would be to cover up with tarpaulin all goods there, and prevent the water from collecting on the lower floors. The most important work of the corps was to prevent damage to goods – the damage from fire was left almost entirely to the fire brigade. The \\"traps\\", which immediately on receipt of an alarm proceeded to the scene of the fire with their crew of men, carried every kind of apparatus for the saving of goods from destruction by fire or damage by water, as well as limelight apparatus for use in working after the fire had been extinguished – thus enabling the men to note the position of dangerous walls etc. They also carried portable coal-gas apparatus, which could be employed in the interior of buildings when the ordinary means of illumination had failed, and ambulance appliances for emergencies. Prior to the outbreak of the Secord World War the London Salvage Corps turned out on average seven times a day. The estimated cost of the eight principal fires in London for the first quarter of 1934 was £325,000. In its report to the insurance companies the LSC stated, \\"It is evident that the loss in material damage, trade and unemployment would have been much greater but for these activities.\\" The London Salvage Corps attended the massive Crystal Palace fire in 1936. Taken from the fire report, they sent three motor tenders and one motor car, 22 men and the LSC Chief Officer. Although not in the same numbers as their fire brigade counterparts, salvagemen also died in the line of duty. =Watching and working salvage= When a fire took place, a man was left behind in charge of the salvage if the property was insured. If there was uncertainty over whether the property was insured, but it appeared probable that it was, a man was left until the information was obtained later. The duty, if an important one, was divided into a day and night duty. This enabled an experienced man to be sent on day duty to meet the surveyor, and to carry out his instructions regarding the working out of the salvage; and a junior man at night. The day man, if working out salvage, would employ a number of men called strangers, over whom he acted as a kind of foreman. The working out might take the form of dividing up damaged goods into lots ready for a sale to be held by the surveyor, or of sifting over the debris to find remains of certain articles claimed for. If, for instance, a large fire occurred at a pianoforte manufacturers, and the debris was all in one common heap, the London Salvage Corps might have to arrange certain quantities of pegs and wires in order to give an idea of the number of pianos before the fire. The watching continued until the loss was settled, when the charge of the premises was given over to the assured. Scandal During the 1930s the service was accused of participating in a criminal arson scandal. At the trial of Leopold Harris in 1934, he testified that he had had nearly every Salvage Corps officer \\"in his pocket\\". Harris was later sentenced to 14 years in jail. Captain Brymore Eric Miles, chief of the insurance companies' salvage corps was sentenced to four years in jail for \\"corruption and conspiring to pervert the administration of justice.\\" The arson ring took £500,000 in false insurance claims.Salvage Corps History Closure In the early 1980s meetings took place between the insurance office representatives, central government and the London Fire Brigade with a view to incorporating the services undertaken by the corps into the London Fire Brigade. Regardless of the loss of salvage skills an agreement was reached and the corps was disbanded in April 1984.Salvage Corps history. All of the LSC equipment, vehicles and Headquarters premises were offered to the London Fire Brigade, some of which was accepted and used. Due to reasons of age, recruiting conditions and staffing costs, very few of the salvagemen undertook retraining and were absorbed into the London Fire Brigade. Those remaining were offered early retirement (depending on their age and service) and the rest were made redundant.

It was the first building to be fully air-conditioned in Southeast Asia. Located a short distance from the Istana, it was the last remaining office building in facing brick in the central area. Initially built for a bank, it continues to function as a banking hall (albeit for a different bank) today, although it is better known as the site of a bombing attack in 1965 at the height of Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation. History The building was built in 1949, and designed by Reginal Eyre of the architectural firm Palmer and Turner. It was named after Malcolm MacDonald, the then Governor-General of Malaya. One of the first high-rise buildings in Orchard Road, the MacDonald House housed mainly British, American and Australian companies. It also house EMI's recording studios, used by local bands during the 'pop yeh-yeh' period. Before the building was vacated in the early 2000s, the building housed HSBC on the first few floors of the building. In an incident known as the MacDonald House bombing, three Indonesian saboteurs placed a bomb on the mezzanine floor on 10 March 1965, killing three and wounding 33. This was one of a number of terrorist attacks in Singapore during the Indonesian Confrontation in support of President Sukarno's opposition to the merger of Singapore, Malaya, Sabah and Sarawak to form the Federation of Malaysia. At the time of the bombing, the building also housed the Australian High Commission and the Japanese Consulate. After years of remaining vacant, the building was put up for sale by tender on 5 April 2002, with a net lettable area of about over ten stories. While the sale was on-going, the building was gazetted as a national monument on 10 February 2003, with the exterior façade coming under protection. The successful bidder, Tinifia Investment, paid S$36 million for the freehold building in 2003, and closed the building for extensive interior renovations costing another S$12 million, including the upgrading of the ceilings, floors, lobby and lifts, and the introduction of car parking facilities with the addition of a mechanical parking system for 30 cars. The building re-opened in April 2005 with full occupancy. McCann Worldgroup occupies the fifth to eighth floors while a beauty/spa operator, Expressions International, takes up the top two floors. The flagship Orchard Road Branch of Citibank Singapore opened on 23 June 2005, occupying of space spread over the building's lower four floors which house the largest wealth management centre in Asia . Architecture Palmer and Turner came to Johor Bahru in 1939 and then to Singapore in 1940 from Shanghai via Hong Kong. The firm was established by Colonel P.O.G. Wakeham in Singapore shortly after World War II. It was probably the longest established and one of the best known architectural firms in Southeast Asia, having been formed in Shanghai circa 1882. The MacDonald House is one of Palmer and Turner's first buildings in Singapore, and was built for The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. It was the first large office building of the post-war period. The building was built in a Neo- Georgian style. It is a reinforced concrete framed structure and clad in light red brickwork of fine detail, the last major building of its kind in downtown Singapore. It was the first building to be fully air-conditioned in Southeast Asia. In addition to the ground banking hall, seven floors of staff flats occupied the building. An open well runs through the building, allowing natural light into the inner offices. There are six skylights in the ceiling of the banking hall which thus needs no artificial lighting during the day.

It tried to resist the regime by denouncing it for violating Polish and international laws including the Constitution of the People's Republic of Poland and International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  History  The declaration, issued and presented to the press on March 26, 1977, was signed by 18 people, among them Andrzej Czuma and gen. Mieczysław Boruta-Spiechowicz (Ret.) It explained that the aims of the ROPCiO were to preserve and defend the civil and human rights. In fact the real aim was to fight the Communist regime of the Polish United Workers' Party by legal means. The declaration was issued only three days after the Polish parliament had ratified the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. ROPCiO focused on preparation of open letters of protest to the communist government, organizing legal and financial support for the families of political prisoners and providing members of the anti-Communist opposition with brochures explaining their rights. Among such secretly-published books were also so- called handbooks to arrest, that is instructions on how to behave when arrested by the militia or the Urząd Bezpieczeństwa. ROPCiO also organized a net of legal advisors and published several magazines, mostly underground. On September 16, 1978 a part of ROPCiO members led by Leszek Moczulski left the movement and established the ZINO movement, which later broke down onto the Confederation of Independent Poland, Movement of Young Poland and Movement of Free Democrats. The remainder of ROPCiO gradually melted into the structures of the Solidarity after its forming.

Her deeply personal writings reflect the human cost of Soviet totalitarianism, and she devoted much of her career to defending dissidents such as Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov. The daughter of the celebrated children's writer Korney Chukovsky, she was wife of scientist Matvei Bronstein, and a close associate and chronicler of the poet Anna Akhmatova. She was the first recipient in 1990 of the new Andrei Sakharov Prize For Writer's Civic Courage. Early life Chukovskaya was born in 1907 in Helsingfors (present-day Helsinki) in the Grand Duchy of Finland, then a part of the Russian Empire. Her father was Kornei Chukovsky, a poet who was a children's writer. She grew up in St. Petersburg, the former capital of the empire torn by war and revolution. Chukovsky noted that his daughter would muse on the problem of social justice while she was still a little girl. But Lydia's greatest passion was literature, especially poetry. Their house was frequently visited by leading literary figures, such as Alexander Blok, Nikolay Gumilyov and Akhmatova. The city was also home to the country's finest artists — Lydia saw Feodor Chaliapin perform at the opera, for instance, and also met the painter Ilya Repin. Chukovskaya got into trouble with the Bolshevik authorities at an early age, when one of her friends used her father's typewriter to print an anti- Bolshevik leaflet. She was exiled to the city of Saratov for a short period, but the experience did not make her particularly political. Indeed, upon her return from exile, she returned to Leningrad's literary world, joining the state publishing house Detgiz in 1927 as an editor of children's books. Her mentor there was Samuil Marshak, perhaps her father's biggest rival in Russian children's literature. Her first literary work, a short story entitled Leningrad-Odessa, was published around this time, under the pseudonym \\"A. Uglov\\". Chukovskaya fell in love with a young physicist of Jewish origin, Matvei Bronstein, and the two soon married. In the late 1930s, Joseph Stalin's Great Terror enveloped the land. Chukovskaya's employer Detgiz came under attack for being too \\"bourgeois\\", and a number of its authors were arrested and executed. Matvei Bronstein also became one of Stalin's many victims. He was arrested in 1937 on a false charge and, unknown to his wife, was tried and executed in February 1938. Chukovskaya too would have been arrested, had she not been away from Leningrad at the time. Later life and career Matvei Bronstein, Lydia's husband For several years, her life was to remain nomadic and precarious. She was separated from her daughter Yelena, and kept in the dark about her husband's fate. In 1939–40, while she waited in vain for news, Chukovskaya wrote Sofia Petrovna, a harrowing story about life during the Great Purges. But it was a while before this story would achieve widespread recognition. Out of favour with the authorities, yet principled and uncompromising, Chukovskaya was unable to hold down any kind of steady employment. But gradually, she started to get published again: an introduction to the works of Taras Shevchenko, another one for the diaries of Miklouho- Maclay. By the time of Stalin's death in 1953, Chukovskaya had become a respected figure within the literary establishment, as one of the editors of the cultural monthly Literaturnaya Moskva. During the late 1950s, Sofia Petrovna finally made its way through soviet literary circles, in manuscript form through samizdat. Khrushchev's Thaw set in, and the book was about to be published in 1963, but was stopped at the last moment for containing \\"ideological distortions\\". Indomitable as ever, Chukovskaya sued the publisher for full royalties and won. The book was eventually published in Paris in 1965, but without the author's permission and under the somewhat inaccurate title The Deserted House. There were also some unauthorized alterations to the text. The following year, a New York City publisher published it again, this time with the original title and text restored. Chukovskaya was a lifelong friend of Anna Akhmatova, and her next major work Spusk pod Vodu (Descent Into Water) described, in diary form, the precarious experiences of Akhmatova and Mikhail Zoshchenko. This book too was banned from publication in her native land. In 1964, Chukovskaya spoke out against the persecution of the young Joseph Brodsky; she would do so again for Solzhenitsyn and Andrei Sakharov. She wrote a series of letters in support of Solzhenitsyn; these were published in Munich in 1970. In supporting Soviet dissidents, Chukovskaya lost her own right to publish inside USSR. Although the KGB monitored her closely, it is thought that the Soviet state refrained from meting out harsher punishment, because of her reputation in the West but also because of her father's indisputable stature in Soviet culture. Her relationship with Akhmatova was the subject of two more books. Throughout her life, Chukovskaya also wrote poems of an intensely personal nature, touching upon her life, her lost husband, and the tragedy of her people. In her old age, she shared her time between Moscow and her father's dacha in Peredelkino, a village that was the home to many writers including Boris Pasternak. She died in Peredelkino in February 1996. Sofia Petrovna became legally available for Soviet readers only in February 1988 when it was published in the magazine Neva. This publication made possible publications of the other Lydia Chukovskaya's works as Chukovskaya explicitly forbade any publications of her fiction in the Soviet Union before an official publication of Sofia Petrovna.

When the editor of the magazine told Artwick that subscribers were interested in purchasing such a program, Artwick founded Sublogic Corporation to commercialize his ideas. At first the new company sold flight simulators through mail order, but that changed in January 1979 with the release of Flight Simulator (FS) for the Apple II. They soon followed this up with versions for other systems and from there it evolved into a long-running series of computer flight simulators. Sublogic flight simulators  =First generation (Apple II and TRS-80)= :− January 1979 for Apple II :− January 1980 for TRS-80 =Second generation (Tandy Color Computer 3, Apple II, Commodore 64, and Atari 8-bit)= :− December 1983 for Apple II :− June 1984 for Commodore 64 :− October 1984 for Atari 8-bit family :− Sometime in 1987 for CoCo 3 =Third generation (Amiga, Atari ST, and Macintosh)= :− March 1986 for Apple Macintosh :− November 1986 for Amiga and Atari ST In 1984 Amiga Corporation asked Artwick to port Flight Simulator for its forthcoming computer, but Commodore's purchase of Amiga temporarily ended the relationship. Sublogic instead finished a Macintosh version, released by Microsoft, then resumed work on the Amiga and Atari ST versions. Although still called Flight Simulator II, the Amiga and Atari ST versions compare favorably with Microsoft Flight Simulator 3.0. Notable features included a windowing system allowing multiple simultaneous 3d views - including exterior views of the aircraft itself - and (on the Amiga and Atari ST) modem play. Info gave the Amiga version five out of five, describing it as the \\"finest incarnation\\". Praising the \\"superb\\" graphics, the magazine advised to \\"BEGIN your game collection with this one!\\" Microsoft Flight Simulator =Flight Simulator 1.0= :− Released in November 1982 =Flight Simulator 2.0= FS 2.0 – Scenery coverage includes the entire United States. :− Released in 1984 In 1984, Microsoft released their version 2 for IBM PCs. This version made small improvements to the original version, including the graphics and a more precise simulation in general. It added joystick and mouse input, as well as support for RGB monitors (4-color CGA graphics), the IBM PCjr, and (in later versions) Hercules graphics, and LCD displays for laptops. The new simulator expanded the scenery coverage to include a model of the entire United States, although the airports were limited to the same areas as in Flight Simulator 1. Over the next year or two, compatibility with Sublogic Scenery Disks was provided, gradually covering the whole U.S. (including Hawaii), Japan, and part of Europe. =Flight Simulator 3.0= FS 3.0 – Many more buildings and additional aircraft. For the first time, users had an option to view the aircraft from the outside. A Cessna Skylane flying over Chicago is shown here. :− Released in mid-1988 Microsoft Flight Simulator 3 improved the flight experience by adding additional aircraft and airports to the simulated area found in Flight Simulator 2, as well as improved high-res (EGA) graphics, and other features lifted from the Amiga/ST versions. The three simulated aircraft were the Gates Learjet 25, Cessna Skylane, and Sopwith Camel. Flight Simulator 3 also allowed the user to customize the display; multiple windows, each displaying one of several views, could be positioned and sized on the screen. The supported views included the instrument and control panel, a map view, and various external camera angles. This version included a program to convert the old series of Sublogic Scenery Disks into scenery files (known as SCN files), which could then be copied to the FS3 directory, allowing the user to expand the FS world. =Flight Simulator 4.0= FS 4.0 – Now with dynamic scenery, more detailed roads, bridges, and buildings. Allowed users to design their own aircraft. :− Released in late 1989 Version 4 followed in 1989, and brought several improvements over Flight Simulator 3. These included improved aircraft models, random weather patterns, a new sailplane, and dynamic scenery (non- interactive air and ground traffic on and near airports moving along static prerecorded paths). The basic version of FS4 was available for Macintosh computers in 1991. Like FS3, this version included an upgraded converter for the old Sublogic Scenery Disks into SCN files. A large series of add-on products were produced for FS4 between 1989 and 1993. First from Microsoft & the Bruce Artwick Organization (BAO) came the Aircraft and Scenery Designer (ASD) integration module. This allowed FS4 users to build custom scenery units known as SC1 files which could be used within FS4 and traded with other users. Also, with the provided Aircraft Designer Module, the user could select one of two basic type aircraft frames (prop or jet) and customize flight envelope details and visual aspects. ASD provided additional aircraft including a Boeing 747 with a custom dash/cockpit (which required running in 640 × 350 resolution). Mallard Software and BAO released the Sound, Graphics, and Aircraft Upgrade (SGA), which added digital and synth sound capability (on compatible hardware) to FS4. A variety of high resolution modes also became available for specific types of higher end video cards and chipsets, thus supplying running resolutions up to 800 × 600. As with ASD, the SGA upgrade also came with some additional aircraft designed by BAO, including an Ultra- light. Another addition was known as the Aircraft Adventure Factory (AAF), which had two components. The first, the Aircraft Factory, was a Windows-based program allowing custom design aircraft shapes to be used within FS4 utilizing a CAD-type interface, supported by various sub menu and listing options. Once the shape was created and colors assigned to the various pieces, it could be tied to an existing saved flight model as was designed in the Aircraft Designer module. The other component of AAF was the Adventure module. Using a simple language, a user could design and compile a script that could access such things as aircraft position, airspeed, altitude, and aircraft flight characteristics. Other add-on products (most published by Mallard Software) included: The Scenery Enhancement Edition (SEE4), which further enhanced SC1 files and allowed for AF objects to be used as static objects within SEE4; Pilots Power Tools (PPT), which greatly eased the management of the many aircraft and scenery files available; and finally, a variety of new primary scenery areas created by MicroScene, including Hawaii (MS-1), Tahiti (MS-2), Grand Canyon (MS-3), and Japan (MS-4). Scenery files produced by Sublogic could also be used with FS4, including Sublogic's final USA East and West scenery collections. =Flight Simulator 5.0= :− Released in late 1993 Flight Simulator 5.0 is the first version of the series to use textures. This allowed FS5 to achieve a much higher degree of realism than the previous flat- shaded simulators. This also made all add-on scenery and aircraft for the previous versions obsolete, as they would look out of place. The bundled scenery was expanded (now including parts of Europe). Improvements were made to the included aircraft models, the weather system's realism, and artificial intelligence. The coordinate system introduced in Flight Simulator 1 was revamped, and the scenery format was migrated from the old SCN/SC1 to the new and more complex BGL format. More noticeable improvements included the use of digital audio for sound effects, custom cockpits for each aircraft (previous versions had one cockpit that was slightly modified to fit various aircraft), and better graphics. It took about a year for add-on developers to get to grips with the new engine, but when they did they were not only able to release scenery, but also tools like Flightshop that made it feasible for users to design new objects. =Flight Simulator 5.1= :− Released in 1995 In 1995, Flight Simulator 5.1 was introduced, adding the ability to handle scenery libraries including wide use of satellite imagery, faster performance, and a barrage of weather effects: storms, 3D clouds, and fog became true-to- life elements in the Flight Simulator world. This edition was also the first version that was released on CD-ROM and the last for DOS. This was released in June 1995. In the fall of 1995, with the release of the Flightshop program, nearly any aircraft could be built. The French program \\"Airport\\" was also available for free which allowed users to build airports (FS5.1 only had 250 Worldwide) and other designers were doing custom aircraft cockpit panels. This all made for a huge amount of \\"freeware\\" to be released to be downloaded and added to the FS5.1 simulator. Forums such as CompuServe, Avsim, and Flightsim.com acted as libraries for uploads and discussion. In November 1995, Microsoft acquired the Bruce Artwick Organization (BAO), Ltd from Bruce Artwick. Employees were moved to Redmond, WA and development of Microsoft Flight Simulator continued. =Flight Simulator for Windows 95= FS95 (6.0) – More scenery and aircraft. Notice the texture mapped runway, aircraft, and sky, and high density of 3-D buildings. :− Released in mid-1996 With the release of Windows 95, a new version (6.0) was developed for that platform. Although this was more or less just a port from the DOS version (FS5.1), it did feature a vastly improved frame-rate, better haze, and additional aircraft, including the Extra 300 aerobatic aircraft. Instead of using the version number in the title, Microsoft instead called it \\"Flight Simulator for Windows 95\\" to advertise the change in operating system. It is often abbreviated as \\"FS95\\" or \\"FSW95\\". This was the first version released after the purchase of BAO by Microsoft, and after having physically relocated development of the BAO development staff to Microsoft's primary campus in Redmond, Washington. The BAO team was integrated with other non-BAO Microsoft staff, such as project management, testing, and artwork. Additional scenery included major airports outside Europe and the US for the first time. =Flight Simulator 98= :− Released on September 16, 1997 \\"New games continue to hit the shelves every day. Now available: Flight Simulator '98...\\" Flight Simulator 98 (version 6.1), abbreviated as FS98, is generally regarded as a \\"service release\\", offering minor improvements, with a few notable exceptions: The simulator now also featured a helicopter (the Bell 206BIII JetRanger), as well as a generally improved interface for adding additional aircraft, sceneries, and sounds. Other new \\"out of the box\\" aircraft included a revised Cessna 182 with a photorealistic instrument panel and updated flight model. The primary rationale for updating the 182 was Cessna's return to manufacturing that model in the late 1990s. The Learjet Model 45 business jet was also included, replacing the aging Learjet 35 from earlier versions. The Dynamic Scenery models were also vastly improved. One of the most noticeable improvements in this version was the ability to have independent panels and sounds for every aircraft. A major expansion of the in- box scenery was also included in this release, including approximately 45 detailed cities (many located outside the United States, some of which had been included in separate scenery enhancement packs), as well as an increase in the modeled airports to over 3000 worldwide, compared with the approximately 300 in earlier versions. This major increase in scenery production was attributable partially to inclusion of the content from previous standalone scenery packs, as well as new contributions by MicroScene, a company in San Ramon, California who had developed several scenery expansions released by Microsoft. This release also included support for the Microsoft Sidewinder Pro Force Feedback joystick, which allowed the player to receive some sensory input from simulated trim forces on the aircraft controls. This was the first version to take advantage of 3D-graphic cards, through Microsoft's DirectX technology. With such combination of hardware and software, FS98 not only achieved better performance, but also implemented better haze/visibility effects, \\"virtual cockpit\\" views, texture filtering, and sunrise/sunset effects. By November 1997, Flight Simulator 98 had shipped one million units, following its September launch.https://web.archive.org/web/20000304120510/http://headline.gamespot.com/news/97_11/20_fltsim/index.html It received a \\"Gold\\" award from the Verband der Unterhaltungssoftware Deutschland (VUD) in August 1998, for sales of at least 100,000 units across Germany, Austria, and Switzerland. The VUD raised it to \\"Platinum\\" status, indicating 200,000 sales, by November. =Flight Simulator 2000= :− Released in late 1999 Flight Simulator 2000 (version 7.0), abbreviated as FS2000, was released as a major improvement over the previous versions, and was also offered in two versions: One version for \\"normal\\" users, and one \\"pro\\" version with additional aircraft. Although many users had high expectations when this version arrived, many were disappointed when they found out that the simulator demanded high-end hardware; the minimum requirements were only a Pentium 166 MHz computer, although 400-500 MHz computer was deemed necessary to have an even framerate. However, even on a high-end system, stuttering framerate was a problem, especially when performing sharp turns in graphically dense areas. Also, the visual damage effects introduced in FS5 were disabled, and continued to be unavailable in versions after FS2000. While the visual damage effects were still in the game, Microsoft disabled them through the game's configuration files. Users can re-enable the damage effects through modifications. FS2000 also introduced computer controlled aircraft in some airports. This version also introduced 3D elevation, making it possible to adjust the elevation for the scenery grids, thus making most of the previous scenery obsolete (as it didn't support this feature). A GPS was also added, enabling an even more realistic operation of the simulator. FS2000 also upgraded its dynamic scenery, with more detailed models and AI that allowed aircraft to yield to other aircraft to avoid incursions while taxiing. FS2000 included an improved weather system, which featured precipitation for the first time in the form of either snow or rain, as well as other new features such as the ability to download real-world weather. New aircraft in FS2000 included the supersonic Aerospatiale-BAC Concorde (prominently featured on both editions' box covers) and the Boeing 777 which had recently entered service at the time. An often overlooked, but highly significant milestone in Flight Simulator 2000, was the addition of over 17,000 new airports, for a total exceeding 20,000 worldwide, as well as worldwide navigational aid coverage. This greatly expanded the utility of the product in simulating long international flights as well as instrument-based flight relying on radio navigation aids. Some of these airports, along with additional objects such as radio towers and other \\"hazard\\" structures, were built from publicly available U.S. government databases. Others, particularly the larger commercial airports with detailed apron and taxiway structures, were built from detailed information in Jeppesen's proprietary database, one of the primary commercial suppliers of worldwide aviation navigation data. In combination, these new data sources in Flight Simulator allowed the franchise to claim the inclusion of virtually every documented airport and navigational aid in the world, as well as allowing implementation of the new GPS feature. As was the case with FS98, scenery development using these new data sources in FS2000 was outsourced to MicroScene in San Ramon, working with the core development team at Microsoft. Microsoft Flight Simulator 2000 was the last of the Flight Simulator series to support the Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0 operating systems. =Flight Simulator 2002= :− Released in October 2001 Flight Simulator 2002 (version 8.0), abbreviated as FS2002, improved vastly over previous versions. In addition to improved graphics, FS2002 introduced air traffic control (ATC) and artificial intelligence (AI) aircraft enabling users to fly alongside computer-controlled aircraft and communicate with airports. An option for a target framerate was added, enabling a cap on the framerate to reduce stutter while performing texture loading and other maintenance tasks. In addition, the 3D Virtual Cockpit feature from FS98 was re-added in a vastly improved form, creating in effect a view of the cockpit from the viewpoint of a real pilot. The external view also featured an inertia effect, inducing an illusion of movement in a realistic physical environment. The simulation runs smoother than Flight Simulator 2000, even on comparable hardware. A free copy of Fighter Ace 2 was also included with the software. =Flight Simulator 2004: A Century of Flight= :− Released in July 2003 Flight Simulator 2004: A Century of Flight (version 9.0), also known as FS9 or FS2004, was shipped with several historical aircraft such as the Wright Flyer, Ford Tri-Motor, and the Douglas DC-3 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the Wright Brothers' first flight. The program included an improved weather engine that provided true three-dimensional clouds and true localized weather conditions for the first time. The engine also allowed users to download weather information from actual weather stations, allowing the simulator to synchronize the weather with the real world. Other enhancements from the previous version included better ATC communications, GPS equipment, interactive virtual cockpits, and more variety in autogen such as barns, street lights, silos, etc. Flight Simulator 2004 is also the last version to include and feature Meigs Field as its default airport. The airport was closed on March 30, 2003, and the airport was removed in the subsequent releases. It is also the last version to support Windows 98/9x series of operating systems. =Flight Simulator X= :− Released in October 2006 Flight Simulator X (version 10.0), abbreviated as FSX, is the tenth edition in the Flight Simulator franchise. It features new aircraft, improved multiplayer support, including the ability for two players to fly a single plane, and players to occupy a control tower available in the Deluxe Edition, and improved scenery with higher resolution ground textures. FSX includes fewer aircraft than FS2004, but incorporates new aircraft such as the Airbus A321, Maule Orion, Boeing 737-800 (replacing the aging Boeing 737-400), and Bombardier CRJ700. The expansion pack, named Acceleration, was released later, which includes new missions, aircraft, and other updates. The Deluxe edition of Flight Simulator X includes the Software Development Kit (SDK), which contains an object placer, allowing the game's autogen and full scenery library to be used in missions or add-on scenery. Finally, the ability to operate the control surfaces of aircraft with the mouse was reintroduced after it was removed in FS2002. Previous versions did not allow great circle navigation at latitudes higher than 60 degrees (north or south), and at around 75-80 degrees north–south it became impossible to \\"fly\\" closer to the poles, whichever compass heading was followed. This problem is solved in FSX. Users may now navigate through any great circle as well as \\"fly\\" across both the Arctic and Antarctic. This version also adds the option to have a transparent panel. FSX is the first of the series to be released exclusively on DVD-ROM due to space constraints. This is also the first in the series that calls for the preparing process known as activating. Through the internet or a phone a hardware number is generated, and a corresponding code is then used to lock the DVD to one single computer only. It also requires a significantly more powerful computer to run smoothly, even on low graphical settings. Users have reported that the game is \\"CPU-bound\\" - a powerful processor is generally more helpful in increasing performance than a powerful graphics card. Meigs Field in Chicago was removed following its sudden destruction in 2003, while Kai Tak Airport in Hong Kong, which had closed in 1998, remained. FSX is the last version of Microsoft Flight Simulator to support Windows XP, Vista, 7, 8, and 8.1 as Microsoft Flight Simulator (2020) only works on Windows 10. Flight Simulator X: Acceleration :− Released in October 2007 Microsoft released their first expansion pack for Flight Simulator in years, called Flight Simulator X: Acceleration, to the US market on October 23, 2007, and released to the Australian market on November 1, 2007. Unlike the base game, which is rated E, Acceleration is rated E10+ in the US. Acceleration introduces new features, including multiplayer air racing, new missions, and three all-new aircraft, the F/A-18A Hornet, EH-101 helicopter, and P-51D Mustang. In many product reviews, users complained of multiple bugs in the initial release of the pack. One of the bugs, that occurs only in the Standard Edition, is the Maule Air Orion aircraft used in the mission has missing gauges and other problems, as it is a Deluxe Version-only aircraft. The new scenery enhancements cover Berlin, Istanbul, Cape Canaveral, and Edwards Air Force Base, providing high accuracy both in the underlying photo texture (60 cm/pixel) and in the detail given to the 3D objects. Flight Simulator X: Acceleration can take advantage of Windows Vista, Windows 7, and DirectX 10 as well. The expansion pack includes code from both service packs, thus installing them is unnecessary. Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition (Dovetail Games) :− Released in December 2014 On 9 July 2014, Dovetail Games announced a licensing agreement with Microsoft to distribute Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition and to develop further products based on Microsoft's technology for the entertainment market. Dovetail released Microsoft Flight Simulator X: Steam Edition on 18 December 2014. It is a re- release of Flight Simulator X: Gold Edition, which includes the Deluxe and Acceleration packs and both Service Packs. It includes \\"all standard Steam functionality\\", and replaces the GameSpy multiplayer system with Steam's multiplayer system. While FSX: Steam Edition remains on sale, Dovetail also released a new flight simulation franchise, Flight Sim World. The company originally planned to bring this game to market in 2015. However, the program became available in 2017. In April 2018, Flight Sim World development was closed, and sales ended in May 2018. =Flight Simulator (2020)= :− Released in August 2020 The latest entry to the series was first revealed in June 2019, at Microsoft's E3 2019 conference. Soon after the announcement, Microsoft Studios made available to the public its Microsoft Flight Simulator Insider Program webpage, where participants could subscribe to news, offer feedback, access a private forum, and be eligible to participate in Alpha and Beta releases of the game. Flight Simulator (2020) features significantly more scenery detail, accurately modelling virtually every part of the world. The simulation also includes vastly more sophisticated aircraft, with nearly complete simulations of aircraft systems, overhead panels and flight management computers (FMCs) in commercial jet airliners; features which were highly incomplete in previous versions. The new Flight Simulator is powered by satellite data and Azure AI. It features high fidelity shadow generation and reflections on aircraft surfaces, busy airports with animated vehicles and people, complex cloud formations, defined shorelines and water bodies, realistic precipitation effects on the aircraft's windshield, and very detailed terrain generation with a vast amount of autogenerated scenery. The official website for the game states: \\"Microsoft Flight Simulator is the next generation of one of the most beloved simulation franchises. From light planes to wide-body jets, fly highly detailed and stunning aircraft in an incredibly realistic world. Create your flight plan and fly anywhere on the planet. Enjoy flying day or night and face realistic, challenging weather conditions.\\" The game was released for Windows on August 18, 2020, through Xbox Game Pass and Steam on PC. A release date for the Xbox console is still forthcoming. Microsoft Flight :− Released in February 2012 On August 17, 2010, Microsoft announced a new flight simulator, Microsoft Flight, designed to replace the Microsoft Flight Simulator series. New to Flight is Games for Windows – Live integration, replacing the GameSpy client which was used in previous installments. An add-on market place was implemented as well, offering some additional scenery packs and aircraft as downloadable content (DLC). The new version was aimed at current flight simulator fans, as well as novice players. However, Flight has a different internal architecture and operational philosophy, and is not compatible with the previous Flight Simulator series. Some users and critics such as Flying Magazine were disappointed with the product, the main issue being that the product is a game, rather than a simulator, to attract a casual audience rather than enthusiasts who would want a more realistic experience. On July 25, 2012, Microsoft announced it had cancelled further development of Microsoft Flight, stating that this was part of \\"the natural ebb and flow\\" of application management. The company stated it will continue to support the community and offer Flight as a free download, but closed down all further development of the product on 26 July 2012. Products based on the Flight Simulator X codebase =Lockheed Martin Prepar3D= In 2009, Lockheed Martin announced that they had negotiated with Microsoft to purchase the intellectual property and including source code for Microsoft ESP which was the commercial-use version of Flight Simulator X SP2. In 2010 Lockheed announced that the new product based upon the ESP source code would be called Prepar3D. Lockheed has hired members of the original ACES Studios team to continue development of the product. Most Flight Simulator X addons as well as the default FSX aircraft work in Prepar3D without any adjustment since Prepar3D is kept backward compatible. The first version was released on 1 November 2010. =Dovetail Games Flight Sim World= In May 2017, Dovetail Games announced Flight Sim World, based on the codebase of Flight Simulator X, and released later that month. Only a year later, on April 23, 2018, Dovetail announced end of development of Flight Sim World and the end of sales effective May 15, 2018.

Heron identifies the gastraphetes as the forerunner of the later catapult, which places its invention some unknown time prior to c. 420 BC.; Unlike later Roman and medieval crossbows, spanning the weapon was not done by pulling up the string, but by pushing down an elaborate slider mechanism.  Description  Crossbowman cocking the gastraphetes A fairly detailed description and drawing of the gastraphetes appears in Heron's Belopoeica (Ancient Greek Βελοποιικά, English translation: On arrow-making), drawn from the account by the 3rd-century BC engineer Ctesibius. The weapon was powered by a composite bow. It was cocked by resting the stomach in a concavity at the rear of the stock and pressing it down. In this way considerably more energy can be summoned up than by using only one arm of the archer as in the hand- bow. There are no attestations through pictures or archaeological finds, but the description by Heron is detailed enough to have allowed modern reconstructions to be made. According to some authors, the dimensions of the gastraphetes may have involved some kind of prop. In his Greek and Roman Artillery: Historical Development (1969), E. W. Marsden believed that the gastraphetes required a base for mounting it before firing. A larger version of the gastraphetes were the oxybeles, which were used in siege warfare. These were later supplanted by the early ballistae that later also developed into smaller versions supplanting also the gastraphetes.  Date  The design of the gastraphetes according to Heron of Alexandria (click for details) According to a long dominant view expressed by E. W. Marsden, the gastraphetes was invented in 399 BC by a team of Greek craftsmen assembled by the tyrant Dionysius I of Syracuse. However, recent scholarship has pointed out that the historian Diodorus Siculus (fl. 1st century BC) actually did not mention the gastraphetes, but was referring to the invention of the \\"katapeltikon\\", a mechanical arrow firing catapult.Diodorus Siculus 14.42.1 Since Heron states in his Belopoeica that stand-mounted mechanical artillery such as the katapeltikon was inspired by the earlier hand-held gastraphetes, the invention of handheld crossbows into Greek warfare must have thus occurred some unknown time before 399 BC. The terminus ante quem may be more precisely defined as being before 421 BC, since another Greek author, Biton (fl. 2nd century BC), whose reliability has been positively reevaluated by recent scholarship,; credits two advanced forms of the gastraphetes to a certain Zopyros. This Zopyros was probably a Pythagorean engineer from southern Italy.Peter Kingsley: \\"Ancient Philosophy, Mystery and Magic\\", Clarendon Press, Oxford 1995, p.150ff.Lewis established a lower date of no later than the mid-4th century (). Same de Camp (). He may have designed his stand-mounted bow- machines on the occasion of the sieges of Cumae and Miletus between 421 BC and 401 BC, thus marking the date by which the archetypical gastraphetes must have already been known.Biton 65.1–67.4 & 61.12–65.1;  Other ancient crossbows  Gallo-Roman crossbow Besides the gastraphetes, the ancient world knew a variety of mechanical hand-held weapons similar to the later medieval crossbow. The exact terminology is a subject of continuing scholarly debate. *Greek and Roman authors like Vegetius (fl. 4th century AD) note repeatedly the use of arrow firing weapons such as arcuballista and manuballista respectively cheiroballistra. While most scholars agree that one or more of these terms refer to handheld mechanical weapons, there is disagreement about whether these were flexion bows or torsion powered like the recent Xanten find.Romanhideout.com: Manuballista found near Xanten *The Roman commander Arrian (c. 86 – after 146 AD) records in his Tactica Roman cavalry training for firing some mechanical handheld weapon from horseback.Arrian Tact. 43.1; ; *Sculptural reliefs from Roman Gaul depict the use of crossbows in hunting scenes. Dating to the 1st–2nd century AD, the specimens are remarkably similar to the later medieval crossbow, including the typical nut lock. From their reflexible shape they were composite bows.Dictionnaire des antiquites grecques et romaines: Arcuballista, Manuballista  References  ;Notes ;Bibliography    ;Further reading *Diels, H.; Schramm, E.

History The company was started in 1896 by James George Accles as Accles Ltd, based at Holford Mill in Perry Barr in Birmingham as a producer of cold-drawn steel tubing, with the aim of supplying it to the bicycle industry. Accles, employed by Colt 1867–1886, designed the Accles machine gun circa 1888; this was a modified Gatling gun.History of Accles & Shelvoke from company website This company was liquidated in 1898 and Accles' secretary, Charles Barlow, took over, the company becoming the Accles Tube Syndicate, and being renamed Accles and Pollock in 1901, after financial backing was provided by Mr. Tom Pollock. In 1902 the company moved to nearby Oldbury, and always listed itself as being in 'Oldbury, Birmingham'. Here they produced the first tubular box spanners in 1905, and the first tubular sections for aircraft and the first tubular furniture in 1907.Accles and Pollock, Tube Manufacturers, Oldbury Black Country History accessed 11 April 2012 In 1909 two acres of land were acquired in Rounds Green, Oldbury which became Paddock Works. In 1913 they started manufacturing tubular steel shafts for golf clubs, having patented a process for producing seamless tapered tubes, but these were banned by the Royal and Ancient Golf Club, and so these could not be sold in Britain, although their use was permitted in America. The Accles & Pollock tube brand is currently owned by Tyco. Bicycles Accles and Pollock was a leading British bicycle tubing manufacturer. Many leading bike builders in the UK during the 1930s, 40s and 50s preferred to use their tubesets as they were air hardening, which become stronger when brazed, unlike the manganese based Reynolds tube which is weakened by heating.

He was deputy chief executive of Vodafone until July 2006. Horn-Smith joined Vodafone at its foundation in 1984 and held a number of senior posts including chief operating officer, managing director Vodafone International and deputy group CEO. Considered a principal architect in the development of Vodafone's global strategy, during his career with the company he was closely involved in many of Vodafone's major international transactions, including the formation of Vodafone AirTouch in 1999. This merger (of the UK and US businesses) created one of the top 25 companies in the world by market capitalisation. The subsequent acquisition of Mannesmann in 2000, almost doubled the size of Vodafone making it the world's largest mobile telecommunications company and the largest FTSE100 quoted stock. In 1996 he was appointed to the board and in 2005 became deputy chief executive. Horn-Smith was instrumental in the foundation of many of Vodafone's largest subsidiary businesses today (such as those in Turkey, Ireland, Netherlands, South Africa, and Egypt. Early life, education and honours Born in London, Horn-Smith, attended King's Norton Grammar School in Birmingham. He received a bachelor's degree in Economics from the University of London in 1970, and a master's degree in Business Administration with Finance and Marketing from the University of Bath in 1979.

It premiered on January 30, 2006, on the A&E; Network and was re- broadcast several times throughout 2006. The film stars Jeffrey Nordling, Colin Glazer, Brennan Elliott, Ty Olsson, Jacqueline Ann Steuart, Laura Mennell, Barry W. Levy, Biski Gugushe, Dominic Rains, and others. The film was rated PG-13 for some violence and emotional depiction of the hijack situation.  Plot  On the morning of September 11, 2001, First officer LeRoy Homer Jr. gets dressed in his F.A.A. official uniform, kisses his wife and leaves for work. Passengers board United Airlines Flight 93 at Newark Liberty International Airport, including Tom Burnett, Jeremy Glick, Todd Beamer, Mark Bingham, Lauren Grandcolas, Donald Greene, Nicole Miller, and Honor Elizabeth Wainio. Four al-Qaeda terrorists Ziad Jarrah, Saeed al-Ghamdi, Ahmed al- Haznawi and Ahmed al-Nami, also board the flight. The plane takes off, bound for San Francisco, California. In the air, the hijackers make their move; after a passenger is fatally stabbed and the \\"bomb\\" is revealed causing mass panic among passengers, the hijackers stab a flight attendant knocking her unconscious before wrestling their way into the cockpit and attack the pilots. Struggling with the hijackers, Homer courageously sends out a mayday call before he and Captain Jason Dahl are knocked unconscious. Flight 77 crashes into the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia. Aboard United 93, the passengers learn from family members via airphone of the attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon; they decide to take action organizing a revolt against the hijackers. Their plan is empowered with the knowledge that passenger Don Greene has experience in flying. Learning that passenger Donald Freeman Greene had experience in flying, the group pin their hopes on him being able at least to control the plane. After passengers arm themselves, pray, and make final phone calls to loved ones, Todd Beamer says, \\"Let's Roll!\\". They start their counter-attack, running down the aisle with a food cart. Jarrah shakes the plane violently to throw the passengers off balance, but nonetheless they continue their assault, overpowering Ahmed al-Nami, who is outside the cockpit. After boiling water is thrown at him, al-Nami is killed by Mark Bingham with a blow to the head with the hot water container. Seeing the passengers getting nearer, al-Ghamdi, Ziad and al-Haznawi prepare to crash the plane, knowing they'll never reach their intended target. The passengers manage to breach the cockpit with the food cart. As the passengers wrestle with al-Haznawi and al-Ghamdi to get in the cockpit, al-Haznawi and al-Ghamdi tell Jarrah to simply crash the plane, rather than to carry on with the rest of their mission. Meanwhile, down below, a farmer is fixing his tractor when he hears the engines of Flight 93 getting closer. He then takes cover as the Boeing 757 rolls over on its side, dangerously flying over the barn at a low altitude. Jarrah puts the plane into a nosedive as the passengers finally gain entrance into the cockpit. The plane inverts, crashing into a field in Shanksville, Pennsylvania, and killing everyone on board. Air Traffic Control can be seen and heard desperately calling for any response from Flight 93. Emergency workers then come by to investigate the crash area (denoted by the crater). Soon, time passes and the crater disappears.

It is in the monotypic genus Photocorynus. The known mature male individuals are 6.2–7.3 millimeters (0.25-0.3 inches), smaller than any other mature fish and vertebrate; the females, however, reach a significantly larger size of up to 50.5 millimeters (2 inches). (However, numerous fish species have both sexes reaching maturity below 20 millimeters (0.8 inches).) Like most other deepsea anglerfishes, Photocorynus spiniceps lures its prey into striking range using a bioluminescent sac at the end of an illicium, the highly modified first ray of the dorsal fin, and swallows the prey whole with the help of a distending jaw and a similarly distending stomach. Its prey can sometimes be as big as their own bodies. The male spends its life fused to its much larger female counterpart, therefore effectively turning her into a hermaphrodite. While the female takes care of swimming and eating, the male, with a large proportion of its body consisting of testes, is charged with the task of aiding reproduction.

Nevertheless, Paraguayan president and commander-in-chief of the army Francisco Solano López was aware of the landing the Allies had made in the rear of his army.Hooker, T.D., 2008, The Paraguayan War, Nottingham: Foundry Books, Taking advantage of the Allies' slow march, he sent Colonel Bernardino Caballero and 5,000 men with 12 guns, to stop the enemy at a narrow passage over a stream called Ytororó. Caballero deployed his troops so that Caxias would have to cross the only passage at disposal (a bridge) under heavy fire. The battle started by late morning and was characterized by attacks and counterattacks for control of the bridge. By nightfall, after a fierce fight, the bridge was taken by Brazilian volunteer battalions led personally by Marshal Caxias shouting \\"Follow me, those of you who are Brazilians\\", and the Allies could advance towards Villeta.

According to José Bernardino Bormann, on the 5th of December, the Marshal Duke of Caxias arrives to inspect the camp, the troops and their willingness to venture. Asked by Duque de Caxias concerning occupation of the bridge over the stream and its surroundings Itororó, General Argolo Ferrao said that was not possible due to lack of sufficient cavalry and even mules to help pull artillery. Although with unpleasant news about the occupation of the stream, Duque de Caxias decided to move forward and occupy the desired position by sending squads Niederauer John Nephew and two infantry battalions, with a promise to increase the strength and firepower with more infantry and artillery when they got animals to carry greater load. The path leading to the edge of the stream was tortuous, with a dense vegetation that hindered the movement of the units, however, when John Niederauer Nephew arrived, the Paraguayans were already entrenched on the other side of the river.

A hand-painting map of battle of Ytororó On the Paraguayan side, Colonel Serrano strengthened the defense of the land occupied, knowing that the fight on the bridge would be difficult, swelling the number of soldiers on the bridge with only the troops that were closer. The struggle depend more on dexterity of his men than the number of fighters on the river. In addition, a word-of-fire had been placed strategically next to the bridge to eliminate any soldier who exceed the other side.

First stage Members of the Greek delegation to the February 1921 London Conference. From right: Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Nikolaos Kalogeropulos, extraordinary envoy Kaftantzoglou, Colonel Ptolemaios Sarigiannis, staff officer in the Army of Asia Minor, and the naval advisor, Commander Bouboulis (BNF/). To salvage the Treaty of Sèvres, a diplomatic conference was held in London between 21 February and 12 March 1921. Triple Entente forced the nationalists to agree with the Constantinople government. Bekir Sami (Kunduh), representative of Ankara, insisted that the delegate from Istanbul could not enter the negotiations, and rejected the use of Sèvres as the basis of the talks. Sêvres had been negotiated with the Ottoman Empire, not with the recently liberated Turkey. Second stage Another meeting in London was held in March 1922. The Allies, without considering the extent of Ankara's successes, hoped to impose modified Sevres as a peace settlement on Ankara. The Entente foreign ministers proposed Ankara to establish an Armenian state in eastern Anatolia, removing Turkish troops from the Straits area. Also stipulated was the Turkish abandonment to the Greeks of Smyrna and eastern Thrace, including Adrianople. In return, the Allies offered to raise the Sèvres limits on the Turkish army to 85,000 men, eliminating the European financial controls over the Turkish government, but retaining the Capitulations and Public Debt Commission. These proposals were completely at odds with the National Pact of the last Ottoman Parliament, making it easy for the Ankara Assembly to reject them.

The film also stars Chow Yun-fat as Wisely, the protagonist in Ni's Wisely Series who appears as a supporting character in the Dr Yuen Series, while Ni himself serves as the film's narrator and also making a brief appearance as himself. Plot In this movie, Dr. Yuen (Chin Siu-ho) in the jungle of Thailand attempts to rescue a beautiful girl from being sacrificed to the \\"Worm Tribe\\" she belongs to. As a result, Yuen is damned with seven \\"Blood Curses\\" which burst through his leg periodically. When the seventh bursts, he will die, but Betsy, the beauty he saved, stops the curse with an antidote that lasts only one year, so on the advice of Wisely (Chow Yun-fat) he heads back to Thailand to find a permanent cure. Action ensues as Yuen and cohorts battle the evil sorcerer of the Worm Tribe, a hideous bloodthirsty baby-like creature, and \\"Old Ancestor,\\" a skeleton with glowing blue eyes that transforms into a monster that is a cross between Rodan and Alien. Alternative versions This film has at least three different endings for each of its official releases: *In the original theatrical release, after the monster-killing climax, there's another by-the-pool-party scene (same pool as seen in the beginning of the film, but is supposed to be another party) in which Maggie Cheung's character makes up with Dr. Yuen.

Instead it is replaced with a two-shot of her and her lover, while the end credits roll partly over its freeze-frame, partly over black. Also, in that video release, the native girl's nude scenes were partly censored with the explicit body parts blacked out to make the film more \\"family-oriented\\". *In the DVD-edition, the second-to-last scene in the original theatrical release is cut out, whilst the final scene is retained, but with the end credits rolling over.

Released in an era before the availability of the CD-ROM format, the titles make up for the limited storage available at the time by using print to attempt to tell a rich story. In essence, the designers endeavored to blend aspects of paper gamebooks with the complexity of a role-playing video game. Versions of the games were released for MS-DOS and for the Apple II series of computers. Games Star Saga: One - Beyond The Boundary, released in 1988, was the first in a short- lived series of science fiction adventure/role-playing games by Masterplay Publishing. Loosely based on the Rekon pen & paper role-playing system, the game series was designed by Andrew C. Greenberg (co-creator of Wizardry), Rick Dutton, Walter Freitag, and Michael Massimilla. In this first title, players leave their homeworlds setting out to explore the vast unknowns of space. Per the official game text: :In 2815 A.D., the majority of the human race is afraid of space. They are cloistered in the Nine Worlds (Earth and eight colonized planets) in a region called the Galactic Fringe. Even though space travel has been practical since the invention of the dual-axis hyperdrive in 2257, humankind's attempt to colonize \\"Beyond the Boundary\\" came to an abrupt halt in 2490. The \\"Space Plague,\\" a gargantuan epidemic caused by an organism of alien origin, killed more than half the humanoid population of the galaxy, threatened the extinction of civilization, and forever changed mankind's attitude towards space. :Now, a Space Patrol enforces the \\"Boundary,\\" that one-way border around the Nine Worlds in order to prevent anything like the \\"Space Plague\\" from ever happening again. Now, anyone may leave the area enclosed by the Boundary, but they may not return. :Thus far, the Boundary has proven effective in keeping ships from entering the Nine Worlds for three centuries, keeping humanity safe from the unknown. Of course, this does provide for a bit of stagnation, as well. After all, no new discoveries, no new challenges, and countless lost opportunities hardly seem compatible with a growing standard of living. Finally, there are those who sense that something is amiss... The second title, Star Saga: Two - The Clathran Menace was the sequel, released in 1989. In this title, a gigantic armada of alien ships scours the galaxy, seeking to eliminate any and all sentient life. Players must quickly explore the accessible reaches of space, hoping to uncover technology with which to oppose this threat. The game background text describes this as: :The ominous approach of the survey line of Clathran battle and colony ships was sweeping through the galaxy, identifying, classifying, and exterminating all in its path. Known collectively as the \\"Clathran Menace\\", it meant many things to many people. To most of the human race, it meant nothing, as they were being purposely kept in the dark by their \\"superiors\\", so as not to cause any undue panic. What good was it to evacuate a city in the face of impending disaster if the only road out of town wasn't finished? :To Professor Lee Dambroke, Dean of the Department of Xenobiology on the university world of Harvard, the \\"Clathran Menace\\" was a matter of science and knowledge; the line must be breached and stopped, or the darkness of ignorance and stagnation would fall over the galaxy for all eternity. :To Laran Darkwatch, mystic Disciple of the Final Church of Man, it was a question of faith; faith in the ultimate triumph of good over evil, faith in the Founders of the Final Church, and faith in their vision of mankind's place in the Cosmos. :To M.J. Turner, the top pilot in the Space Patrol, or the whole galaxy for that matter, it was a question of pride; pride in the abilities of mankind to overcome all obstacles in pursuit of its ultimate destiny ... to rule the stars. :All were impressive goals, solid tenets upon which to build a society and a glittering future. Or were they merely brittle conceits, ready to crumble at the first pressure from the \\"Clathran Menace\\"? Although Star Saga was to be released as a trilogy, Masterplay went out of business before the third game was released, leaving only Star Saga: One - Beyond the Boundary and Star Saga: Two - The Clathran Menace. Description As well as the computer software (which acts as a \\"game master\\" or moderator for the game), Star Saga ships with a large color fold-out map, six colored tokens that players use to move around the map, and thirteen booklets containing a total of 888 numbered passages of text. Due to the high volume of text, the oversized game box weighs in at over 3 pounds. The second title expands the number of booklets to fourteen, with over 50,000 individual paragraphs. At the beginning of the game, up to six players choose which character to play as from six sealed character profiles. Both single and multiplayer hotseat options are available, with players interacting both directly (e.g., by trading goods) and indirectly with one another over the course of the game. Each character has a different background story and motivating goals, and players are encouraged to keep these secret from each other. All players begin with a non-upgraded starship which can move between points on the galactic map. When playing Star Saga, each player physically plots his or her moves on the map, then enters these movements and other desired actions into the Star Saga computer program. In response to the entered commands, the program determines the results, updates the character's statistics and inventory, and directs the player to read one or more text passages from the accompanying booklets. Upon reading the section(s), the player discovers the consequences of his or her actions, as well as any new information which has been gleaned. In some cases, the actual results of a turn will be quite different from those planned, due to events such as interception by hostile forces. Although the large amount of reading slows gameplay, the text is broken out into multiple booklets so that players can (usually) be simultaneously reading from separate sources. Over a number of turns, each player slowly progresses through the game, discovering what lies at each unlabeled planet on the map and otherwise uncovering the mysteries of the galaxy. The game master software, while lacking any sort of graphical display, is nonetheless relatively advanced for the time period. The software carefully maintains the game state, keeping players honest and preventing them from attempting invalid moves. Between plotting turns, players can use the software to view information about their current status, such as their hand-held items or the contents of their ship's cargo holds. If one player is not available for a play session (since a game cannot generally be played in one sitting), his or her character can be placed in \\"suspended animation\\" while the remaining players continue to play. Although the central game plot is itself somewhat linear (particularly in the second title), players are generally free to move back and forth between worlds, trade various goods as desired, and otherwise explore the game's various sub-plots. Additionally, certain elements (e.g., which planet is which on the map) are randomized between games, in order to increase replay value. Reception Star Saga was hailed as being completely new and different from games which came before. The Computer Gaming World review of the first title summarizes this sentiment as \\"Star Saga: One - Beyond the Boundary is probably the most unique and well-written role-playing experience yet to appear in a computer game\\". The same reviewer noted that it was easy to lose track of time playing \\"just one more turn\\" due to the deep experiences provided by the game. In 1989 the magazine gave Star Saga One a Special Award for Literary Achievement. Compute! was less favorable, describing the game as \\"far more a social event than a computer game\\". The magazine stated that \\"it's lackluster without interaction\\" with other players, and described the user interface as \\"almost crude by today's standards\\". Star Saga One: Beyond the Boundary was reviewed in 1989 in Dragon #142 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \\"The Role of Computers\\" column. The reviewers gave the game 3 out of 5 stars. Tony Watson reviewed Star Saga: One - Beyond the Boundary in Space Gamer/Fantasy Gamer No. 84. Watson commented that \\"Through imaginative writing, an appreciation of SF, and an appropriate sense of humor (and Will McLean's illustrations help too), the designers have made the paragraph system work. Star Saga: One is simply a lot of fun .\\" The second game is described as being more difficult than the first, due to frequent conflicts with the Clathran \\"Survey Line\\" which inexorably moves across the galaxy. It's also more linear, in that players are prevented from undertaking certain activities due to current game conditions. Nonetheless, the Computer Gaming World review concludes, \\"Despite the few faults, Star Saga Two is a wonderfully written and produced game that can really glue you to the computer.\\" The editors of Game Player's PC Strategy Guide gave Star Saga Two their 1989 \\"Best PC Science Fiction Game\\" award. They wrote, \\"Although darker and more sinister in tone than its predecessor, Star Saga: Two is still a rollicking, all-stops-out space opera\\". In 1990 Masterplay sold the series to Cinemaware because of poor sales. The company attributing the lack of success to its decision to develop the game for the Apple; Greenberg stated \\"We followed the 'Apple II Forever' hype into oblivion\\". He has nonetheless said that, of the various games he worked on, Star Saga was the one he is the most proud of, much more so than his commercially more successful Wizardry games.

Engraving by William Skillman (fl.1660-1685) from painting by Johann Spilberg II (1619-1690) Clarendon House, viewed from St James's Street. 1798 engraving by Nathaniel Smith and John Thomas Smith of London, copied from an earlier print in collection of Thomas Allen Esq. Published in Smith's \\"Antiquities of London\\" 1798 Clarendon House was a town mansion which stood on Piccadilly in London, England, from the 1660s to the 1680s. It was built for the powerful politician Edward Hyde, 1st Earl of Clarendon, and was the grandest private London residence of its era. History After the restoration of the English monarchy in 1660, new houses began to spring up in the West End to accommodate Charles II's courtiers. Piccadilly was little more than a country lane, but the land to the north of it was just beginning to be used for housing; the next several decades would see the development of the whole of this area, which was to become London's leading aristocratic residential district, Mayfair. Two other celebrated mansions were built close to Hyde's at around the same time. To the east Sir John Denham was building the house that later became Burlington House, and to the west Lord Berkeley was building Berkeley House, later Devonshire House. Lord Clarendon acquired the site for his house by royal grant in 1664. Ironically in view of later events he always maintained that he had been reluctant to build such an ostentatious house, but was unable to rent any suitable mansion. Clarendon House was built between that year and 1667 to designs by Roger Pratt. It was set well back from the street behind a courtyard. The central section had nine bays and the two side wings were each three bays wide. The house was built on the double pile plan, meaning that it was two rooms deep, and had two main storeys of roughly equal height. There was a raised basement below and a tall attic storey with dormer windows above. The roof was flat and balustraded and topped with a cupola. The style was typical of the English fashion of the day, clearly influenced by classical principles, symmetrical and pedimented, but lacking any classical orders. Little is known about the interior layout beyond what can be surmised from the exterior, from Pratt's other works, and from the conventions of the time. It probably had a large top lit central staircase hall and a series of state apartments. It had 101 hearths. Clarendon House was praised both by contemporaries and by later architectural critics. John Evelyn thought it was \\"the best contriv'd, the most useful, graceful and magnificent house in England\\". Three hundred years later, John Summerson wrote: \\"Clarendon House was among the first great classical houses to be built in London and easily the most striking of them.\\" It was to prove an influential model for future English houses, but its impact was felt much more in the design of country houses than London mansions. Belton House in Lincolnshire, which is sometimes said to be the exemplar of the English country house, was closely based on Clarendon House. In 1667, the same year that his house was finished, Clarendon fell from favour. His image had not been helped by the grandeur of his mansion, which is believed to have cost around £40,000. Among the many allegations against him it was charged that he has appropriated stone intended for repairs to St. Paul's Cathedral after the Great Fire to build his house. That same year, on 14 June 1667, Samuel Pepys recorded in his diary: \\"...some rude people have been... at my Lord Clarendon's where they cut down the trees before his house and broke his windows.\\" In response to the allegations, the King abandoned his former favourite. In 1667, Clarendon fled to France, where he died in 1674. In 1675, his heirs sold Clarendon House to Christopher Monck, 2nd Duke of Albemarle, for £26,000, and in 1683, Albemarle resold it to a consortium of investors led by Sir Thomas Bond. Bond demolished it and built Dover Street, Albemarle Street, and Bond Street on the site. Albemarle Street ran right through the centre of the site of the house, which had faced directly down St. James's Street. The building of the house and the resentment it caused are major elements in The Piccadilly Plot, the seventh of the Thomas Chaloner series of mystery novels by Susanna Gregory.

The novel focuses on the life and exploits of Sophie Fevvers, a woman who is – or so she would have people believe – a Cockney virgin, hatched from an egg laid by unknown parents and ready to develop fully fledged wings. At the time of the story, she has become a celebrated aerialiste, and she captivates the young journalist Jack Walser, who runs away with the circus and falls into a world that his journalistic exploits had not prepared him to encounter. Nights at the Circus incorporates multiple categories of fiction, including postmodernism, magical realism, and postfeminism. As in her previous works, Carter plays with many literary aspects and dissects the traditional fairy tale structure. In 2006, the novel was adapted for the stage by Tom Morris and Emma Rice for Kneehigh Theatre Company. It was performed at the Lyric Hammersmith, London, Bristol Old Vic, Bristol and then toured. Plot summary =London= Nights at the Circus begins with American journalist Jack Walser interviewing Sophie Fevvers in her London dressing room, following her performance in the circus which employs her. Fevvers claims to have been left as a baby in a basket on the doorstep of a brothel. Until she reached puberty she appeared to be an ordinary child, with the exception of a raised lump on each shoulder; as she begins menstruating, however, she also sprouted complete wings. As a child, she posed as a living statue of Cupid in the reception room of the brothel, but as an adolescent, she is now transformed into the image of the \\"Winged Victory\\" holding a sword belonging to Ma Nelson, the madam of the brothel. This stage of Fevvers' life comes to an abrupt end when Ma Nelson slips in the street and falls into the path of a carriage. The house and its contents are inherited by her pious brother who plans to convert it to a house for fallen women, but Ma Nelson's employees burn the place down and go their separate ways. Fevvers continues her story, although doubt is cast on the veracity of her narrative voice throughout. She and Lizzie, she tells Walser, next move in with Lizzie's sister and help run the family ice cream parlour. However, when the family falls on hard times Fevvers accepts an invitation from the fearsome Madame Schreck. This lady puts Fevvers on display in her exclusive combination of freak show and brothel, along with several other women with unique appearances. After some time Madame Schreck sells Fevvers to a customer, \\"Christian Rosencreutz\\", who wishes to sacrifice a winged 'virgo intacta' in order to procure his own immortality. Fevvers narrowly escapes and returns to Lizzie's sister's home. Soon after their reunion, she joins Colonel Kearney's circus as an aerialiste and achieves enormous fame. The London section concludes with Walser telling his chief at the London office that he is going to follow Fevvers, joining the circus on its grand imperial tour. =Petersburg= The Petersburg section begins as Walser, living in Clown Alley, types up his first impressions of the city. The reader learns that Walser approached Colonel Kearney who, taking advice from his fortune telling pig Sybil, offered him a position as a clown in the circus. The reader, and Walser, are introduced to the other members of the circus and Walser saves Mignon from being eaten by a tigress. In the next scene the chief clown Buffo and his troupe invoke chaos at their dinner table. Walser ducks out of the meleé only to find Mignon waiting outside for him, as she has nowhere else to go after her husband and lover have both abandoned her. Not sure what to do with the abandoned woman, he takes her to Fevvers's hotel room. Fevvers assumes that Walser is sleeping with Mignon but, though jealous, takes care of the girl. On recognising the beauty of Mignon's singing voice Fevvers introduces her to the Princess of Abyssinia. The Princess, a silent tiger tamer, incorporates Mignon into her act with the dancing cats and Walser is recruited as partner to the redundant tigress. During rehearsals, the acrobatic Charivari family tries to kill Fevvers and the Colonel reluctantly kicks them out of the circus. Buffo the Great loses his mind during that night's performance and tries to kill Walser. The Princess has to shoot one of her tigresses when she becomes jealous of Mignon for dancing with her tiger mate during the tiger waltz. After her performance, Fevvers goes to a date at a mansion belonging to the Grand Duke. Here, she almost falls victim to his amorous advances but narrowly escapes into a Fabergé egg, reaching the circus train as it is about to pull out of the station. This last scene is deliberately bewildering, developing the sense of doubt cast upon the reader in Fevvers' early narrative and laying the foundations for the fantastic occurrences of the final section. =Siberia= The Siberian section opens with the entire circus crossing the continent to Asia. The train is attacked by a band of runaway outlaws who think that Fevvers can help them make contact with the Tsar, who will then allow them to return home to their villages. As the train is now destroyed, the entire circus, other than Walser, is marched to the convicts' encampment; Walser is rescued by a group of escaped murderesses and their former guards, who have become their lovers and helped them to escape. As Walser has amnesia, the band of women leaves him for an approaching rescue party but he flees into the woods before they reach him and is taken under the wing of a village shaman. Fevvers and the rest of the party are being held captive by the convicts. Fevvers tells the convict leader that she cannot help them as everything that they have heard about her is a lie. Depressed, the convicts sink into drunken mourning. Lizzie convinces the clowns to put on a show for the convicts, during which a blizzard comes, blowing the clowns and the convicts away with it into the night. The remnants of the circus begin to walk in the direction in which they hope civilization lies. They come across a run-down music school and take shelter with its owner, the Maestro. A brief encounter with Walser, now thoroughly part of the shaman's village, convinces Fevvers and Lizzie to leave the safety of the Maestro's school to search for Walser. Colonel Kearney leaves the group to continue his quest for civilization so as to build another, and more successful, circus. Mignon, the Princess and Samson remain with the Maestro at his music school. Fevvers finds Walser and the story ends with them together at the moment that the new century dawns and Fevvers' victorious cry \\"to think I really fooled you\\". Setting Nights at the Circus spans Europe and Asia as it carries the reader along with Colonel Kearney's circus on its Grand Imperial Tour. The characters begin in London and move on to Petersburg and then Siberia where they find themselves stranded for the remainder of the novel. While in London, the characters are primarily in Fevvers's dressing room above the Alhambra Music Hall but the action that takes place in Fevvers's autobiography spans across much of London and its environs. In Petersburg, the action takes place in three key locations: Clown Alley, Fevvers's hotel room, and the circus itself. The final section begins with the entire circus on a train traversing the Siberian wilderness separating Europe and Asia, but the chief action and culmination of the story takes place in the cold and wintry forests of Transbaikalia. Characters *Fevvers, christened Sophie – the self-defined winged aerialiste who acts as the focal point for the circus' success. She is six feet two inches tall, curvaceous, peroxide blonde, and the largest personality within the story *Jack Walser – a California native that stowed away on a departing ship at a young age. He became a journalist and interviewed Fevvers before running away with the circus to try to discover the truth of her story. *Lizzie – Fevvers' adoptive mother, a former prostitute, and political activist/revolutionary who may have occult powers *Ma Nelson – the well-loved proprietor of the bordello where Fevvers grew up *Madame Schreck – The owner of a female freak show that also functioned as a whorehouse of sorts. *Toussaint – The male servant of Madame Schreck who was born without a mouth *Christian Rosencreutz – a rich religious maniac who believes Fevvers is a fallen angel and attempts to sacrifice her *Colonel Kearney – The extravagant capitalist and owner of the circus *Little Ivan – the son of Olga Alexandrovna; attempts to run away with the circus but is prevented from doing so by Walser *Sybil – Colonel Kearney's pet pig, intelligent and clairvoyant, whom he unquestioningly relies on to make nearly all of his business decisions *Princess of Abyssinia – The tiger tamer and piano player who falls in love with Mignon *Monsieur Lamarck – Mignon’s abusive alcoholic husband and the monkey trainer of the circus. *Mignon – initially a circus hanger-on who transmutes into a beautiful singer who dances the waltz with tigers and falls in love with the Princess *Samson – The strong man of the circus and Mignon's lover before she falls in love with the Princess *The Professor – the head monkey who tricks Colonel Kearney into allowing the chimps to leave the circus *Buffo the Great – The leader of the clowns *The Charivaris – A family of trapeze artists and tightrope walkers who try to kill Fevvers out of jealousy and from then on carry a curse, doomed to never perform well again *The Grand Duke – A member of the Russian aristocracy who unsettles and scares Fevvers with automata and insinuation to the point where she almost loses control of her own narrative *Countess P. – a cruel and rich woman who kills her husband, gets away with it, but feels bad about the crime nonetheless. She builds a panopticon in Transbaikalia and tries to reform other murderesses but only succeeds in turning both the prisoners and the guards against her *Olga Alexandrovna – a prisoner of the panopticon and the first to instigate contact with one of the guards. She is also the mother of little Ivan and finds Walser after the train wreck *The Shaman – the spiritual leader of the village who takes Walser under his wing when he suffers from amnesia *The Maestro – The master of a music school in Transbaikalia that has no students. He eventually provides shelter for what is left of the circus after they escape from the convict camp Themes =Time= The concept of time is hazy throughout this novel, beginning when Walser finds himself transfixed by Fevvers' narrative and hears the clock striking midnight three times within one night. This blurred sense of time represents the difference between narrative time and story time. Fevvers' hold on Walser reveals the true power of narrative and its influence on an audience. Initially, it is through her narrative that Fevvers wields power over Walser. Carter emphasizes that the women in the novel are able to step outside of conventional nineteenth century gender roles, but only through the use of enchantment. Indeed, as Fevvers and Lizzie reveal in the Envoi, they had previously tricked Walser and purposefully played with his perception of time using Ma Nelson's clock. [pg. 292] During their narratives, they support an illusion of time coming to a standstill but only retain control in this magical or illusory sense. =Postmodernism= Nights at the Circus can be categorized as a postmodern novel for its complexity of language and the inclusion of magical elements. The story itself is as intricate as the structure of the novel. The mystery surrounding Fevvers and the reality or otherwise of her wings drives the story and is reminiscent of many ambiguous postmodern pieces. The novel's turn-of-the-century setting is fitting, as modernism is generally acknowledged as encompassing the literature, music, arts and movements that occurred before 1914. As the characters make the transition into a new century, they begin to embrace new ideas and ways of life. This transition towards the new is reflected in every aspect of the novel, as the story itself is a new and unique concept. Walser's initial skepticism regarding Fevvers' wings is reflective of postmodern thought. The women in the novel embody postmodern thought in their questioning of patriarchal social norms. =Post-feminism= Despite Angela Carter's reputation for feminist rhetoric, many feminists remain disappointed with this novel, arguing that it in fact promotes post-feminism. Many argue that the seemingly crude language used to describe women throughout the novel is anti- feminist. The fact that women are depicted as strong, forward thinkers that can remain outside of restrictive gender roles is reflective of post-feminist thought, in which women are not seen as victims and traditional feminism is no longer relevant within a modern society. This claim is backed by the fact that Carter's novel was penned and published during the 1980s, when post-feminism was really beginning to emerge. =Feminism= The argument for feminism may equally be justified through elements of the novel. Fevvers' wings might be a symbol of liberation, enabling her to escape an oppressive patriarchal society and progress into a twentieth century of feminist freedom. The women in the novel may ultimately represent suffragists and the entire Women's suffrage movement of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Fevvers, Lizzie and the rest of the female characters represent the idea of the New Woman and a new way of thinking entirely. Even the innocent and vulnerable Mignon is able to escape her abusive husband and past life of oppression for an empowering existence outside of social norms. =Magical realism= Like many of Carter's earlier works, Nights at the Circus contains elements of magical realism. In this novel, Carter combines the mythical with the realistic, creating a playful, whirlwind adventure for the reader that is often as chaotic and lively as a real circus. In adding this magical, playful element to the novel, Carter is able to infuse the story with underlying political and social messages. The whimsy in her novel is a tool that enables Carter to address pertinent social issues such as patriarchy and individual rights. Furthermore, in the two main characters, Fevvers and Walser, she illustrates the contrast between the magical and the believable. Fevvers' status as half swan and half woman remains questionable and surreal while Walser's role as the pragmatic journalist looking for the facts grounds the story in reality. Through magical realism, Carter is able to address everyday concerns through an engaging and playful form. =Order versus chaos= Though the syntax in this novel is often as intricate and bustling as a circus itself, the novel itself is carefully structured. The story alternates back and forth from order to chaos, often when the narrative voice switches between Fevvers and Walser. While Fevvers remains hypnotizing in her narrative, she is also disorganized and bounces back and forth in time during her tales. Walser, on the other hand, is pragmatic and grounds the reader in reality as he searches for the facts. Fevvers represents the chaotic element of life while Walser represents the orderly. Together, they are an embodiment of our world and how order and chaos cannot exist without the other as a balancing force. Fevvers represents the indulgences that Walser will never allow himself to have and similarly, he is the force that grounds Fevvers, who is constantly trying to escape reality and the roles and rules of her society. =Individualism= This novel itself is a proponent for individualism, as it is a fantastically inventive fusion of various genres. Many of the characters defy the conventional gender and social roles of their century and remain true to their individual selves. The women in the novel do not stick to their oppressive nineteenth century gender roles nor do the animals stick to their standard roles. Carter puts a magical twist on most aspects of her book, making it difficult for any object or person to remain conventional. Just as Mignon eventually discovers her strengths and escapes her abusive past, Walser finds himself through his journey in examining the phenomenon that is the aerialiste. Additionally, Fevvers' image as half swan and half human is ambiguous throughout the novel and Walser's quest for the truth behind her famous wings further emphasizes the value of true identity and self-reliance over facades and the dependence upon any external forces. Lizzie and the other women in the brothel support the concept of individualism, as they remain self-reliant and look down upon marriage as a social impediment. =Appearance versus reality= The idea of appearance versus reality is found throughout the whole story. The truth about Fevvers' wings is the crux of this concept in the novel, although further doubts are raised by Fevvers' final celebratory cry. The reader is left questioning whether the real deception relates to Fevvers' wings or to her much-lauded virginity. Though Fevvers appears human, she claims to in fact carry the wings of her avian ancestors. Similarly, though the women in the brothel work as prostitutes, they are simultaneously self-sufficient, forward thinking women whom Lizzie compares to suffragists. Nothing is as it seems in this novel, as even the animals are endowed with magical features and are taken out of their conventional boxes. Through these magical elements, Carter is able to test the reader's perception of reality and challenges all to question their surroundings. =Class and wealth= The issue of social class is also apparent in Nights at the Circus. Fevvers, Lizzie and even Walser are in a no man's land of celebrity and performance, outside traditional class structures, and Fevvers' recent wealth is rendered tawdry through its ostentation. The remaining characters, such as the prostitutes and circus performers, have no such pretensions and firmly inhabit a lower tier of society. Carter draws particular attention to the class dynamics in Chapter Five of Book Two where she describes the poor living conditions of the clowns in the circus. It is apparent that only wealth wields much power, because while Fevvers has many opportunities in London, once she is stranded in Siberia she loses all access to power and not even her previous celebrity can help her. Similarly, Walser loses his social power when he becomes a clown in the travelling circus. Plot structure, form, and perspective Nights at the Circus utilizes several different types of narrative techniques throughout its three very different parts. =London section= The story opens with a third person narrative set in 1899 London. However, this narrator is biased and deceives the reader. The narrator has an omniscient perspective towards Walser but, as regards Fevvers and Lizzie, the narrator can only give hard facts that could have been picked up from any newspaper at the time. The narration can more or less, though third person, be seen as presenting only Walser's perspective. However, the reader is also given a very biased autobiography from Fevvers in a first person past narrative using dialogue. Here, the London section uses the form of the two narratives to confuse the reader over who the true narrator is. Even though it is obvious that the main narrator is not Fevvers, she nonetheless controls the pace and direction of the entire section; she steals the power of narration from the narrator and uses it to focus on herself while the narrator is left to merely comment on the information she presents. This formal trick is used to present Fevvers' ability to dominate an audience and hold the center of attention. =Petersburg section= The narration of the Petersburg section is very similar to the narration of the London section in that is a third person narrative that is omniscient towards Walser. However, in this section the characters of the circus are introduced as well. Whereas in the London section, all past information is constructed by Fevvers and is contained within her story, in Petersburg the reader is given information about the characters from the actual narrator. Thus, the narration is used to show that even though Fevvers is present throughout the Petersburg section, she is not the focus. Rather, the narrator concentrates on the circus and the characters that make it up. =Siberia section= The exact style of narration in Petersburg is also used in Siberia with one exception: the first person perspective of Fevvers is also presented. Fevvers' internal dialogue is used to remove much, though not all, of the mystique surrounding her. Fevvers' perspective not only reveals her inner, human confusions, but shifts the readers focus from what she says to what she thinks. Still, by presenting only Fevvers' first person perspective, a unique treatment is applied to her that no other character receives, thereby distinguishing her in a similar manner to how her wings set her apart from the rest of the cast. Allusions =Biblical allusions= There are numerous biblical references throughout the novel. In one such instance, Carter references the fallen angel, Lucifer in describing Fevvers' first attempt at flight. > “Like Lucifer, I fell. Down, down, down I tumbled being with a bump on the > Persian rug below me…” [pg. 30] The reference to Lucifer, often described as the embodiment of evil in Christian texts, suggests that Fevvers herself is a fallen angel, rebelliously resisting the patriarchal doctrine of the nineteenth century. Like Lucifer who led the revolution against God during \\"The War of the Heavens\\", Fevvers may serve as a symbol for women’s suffrage and the fight for women’s rights in general. In addition, Rosencreutz, an obsessive customer of Madame Shreck’s, refers to Fevvers as Azrael, Flora, Venus and Gabriel. > “Azrael, Azrail, Ashriel, Azriel, Azarail, Gabriel; dark angel of many > names. Welcome to me, from your home in the third heaven. See, I welcome you > with roses no less paradoxically vernal that your presence, who like > Perseophone, comes from the Land of the Dead to herald new life!” [pg. 75] > “Flora; Azrael; Venus Pandemos! These are but a few of the many names with > which I might honour my goddess…” [pg. 77] To Rosencreutz, Fevvers is far beyond any being he has ever come across. He is amazed by her existence, as he considers her neither woman nor bird. To him, she is no longer an entity, but rather a showpiece to be revealed. Rosencreutz believes Fevvers to be the fountain of youth and consequently wishes to offer her as sacrifice. His treatment of Fevvers reflects his overall view of women as only having value for their essence and aesthetics rather than their actual being. =Allusions to people= > “She was prepared to make certain exceptions for exigent French dwarves” refers to the painter Toulouse-Lautrec, who painted posters of the Parisian night life and exotic performers, and is mentioned as one of the hordes of Parisian admirers. =Allusions to other works= Büchner's Woyzeck: The story of Mignon's poor father killing her mother because she slept around with soldiers is a reference to Büchner's play Woyzeck which contemplated what it meant to be human and the plight of the lowest classes of society. Hesse's Demian: Fevvers continually refers to Walser's need to break out of his shell and into self-realization and individuality. This image is borrowed from Hesse's novel Demian which presents the conflict between good and evil and its relationship to the individual. In addition, Hesse draws from the philosophies of Nietzsche, Freud, and Jung to present a theory of the subjectivism contained within the individual and man's ability to become human by breaking out of the shell that is the limitations forced upon him by society. Ibsen's A Doll's House: There are numerous references in the novel that refer back to Ibsen's play, the most obvious references are usually to the title. Shakespeare: many references are made to scenes, interactions, or characters from various plays. Twelfth Night Malvolio and Macbeth Lady Macbeth are both presented as parallels to characters within the novel, referencing either their modes of dress or attitude. Poe's Annabel Lee: Herr M. alludes to this poem when he explains to his customers why he can only summon female ghosts: > “Because, he implied [...]he himself, once, long ago, in a kingdom by the > sea... Her highborn kinsmen arrived, in due course, and took her away [...]” > [pg. 160] Herman Melville: Carter also references Ishmael (Moby-Dick), the protagonist and sole narrator of Herman Melville's 1851 novel, Moby-Dick in describing the journalist Walser. > “Call him Ishmael; but Ishmael with an expense account, and, besides, a > thatch of unruly flaxen hair, a ruddy, pleasant, square-jawed face and eyes > the cool grey of skepticism.” [pg. 10] This comparison to both the biblical Ishmael and Melville's main character presents Walser as an outsider travelling the Earth. Additionally, like Melville's renowned narrator, Walser considers himself the sole narrator, hoping to expose Fevvers for the fake that he initially believes her to be. In a further parallel, Walser soon withdraws into the background and becomes a mere commentator as Fevvers and Lizzie take the reins as the narrators of their own mesmerizing tale. Lewis Carroll: Many of the remarkable occurrences and exaggerated or absurd characters reflect Carroll's Alice books (Alice in Wonderland, Through the Looking Glass), and the journey of the Hunting of the Snark. Walser himself quotes Alice after realizing that his watch stopped precisely at midnight: \\"Curiouser and curiouser\\" Fairy Tales: Traditional fairy tales are invoked throughout the story, most of which only briefly resemble their original context. Carter often inverts the sex of the characters typically changing the protagonist to a female. For example, Fevvers often acts as Walser's Prince Charming, rescuing him from several situations where he was hopeless without her. Historical context The turn- of-the-century setting dictates much of the novel's content and its personas. The female characters, in particular, encompass a transition between one century and the next and from one time period's ideals to another's. Specifically, Lizzie's character is not only a protector of the aerialiste, Fevvers, but of women's rights. She considers marriage a personal and social impediment and takes it upon herself to ensure that Fevvers does not fall into the trappings of a patriarchal society. Lizzie herself is a symbol of the nineteenth century's suffrage movement. The women of Ma Nelson's brothel similarly defy the female mold of previous centuries as Lizzie refers to them as suffragists in Chapter Two of Book One. The duality of prostitutes and suffragists again depicts the females as novel, forward-thinking women. Jack Walser's character also encompasses nineteenth-century thought in his pragmatic approach to life, while the many members of the circus represent a transition towards a new century with different ideals as they struggle to find themselves, leaving their dark circus pasts behind. Literary significance and reception Though it was one of the later books of her career, Nights at the Circus was the first to bring Angela Carter widespread acclaim, winning that year's James Tait Black Memorial Prize for fiction. Carter's penultimate novel was met with mixed reviews, some uncomfortable with the underlying politically driven content, while others praised it for its playfulness and originality. Many critics viewed Fevvers as a winged version of the New Woman, able to escape the trappings of a patriarchal nineteenth century and move on into the twentieth century of feminist liberation. However, some feminists were disappointed with the novel, criticizing it for upholding a post-feminist stance. Since Angela Carter's death in 1992, both the novel and her reputation have reached even greater levels of popularity. Since then, the novel has made its way onto many academic syllabi and was adapted for the stage by Tom Morris and Emma Rice in 2006. Nights at the Circus inspired British musician Bishi's first album, which has the same title. On November 5, 2019, the BBC News listed Nights at the Circus on its list of the 100 most influential novels.

Since 1 April 2013, the college has been under the control of the Police Service of Scotland. In addition to probationer training, the college provides training in various specialist areas, such as Road Policing, Criminal Investigation, and training for newly promoted officers. The motto of the college is, BI GLIC - BI GLIC, which is the cry of the Oystercatcher which translates from Gaelic as ' Be Wise, Be Circumspect '. Oystercatchers can be found throughout the grounds of the college. The College Crest depicts two Oystercatchers surrounding the crest of the Scottish Police Service which is in itself surrounded by two books to signify learning. History Tulliallan Castle, a 160-year-old mixture of Gothic and Italian style architecture set amid some of parkland just north of where the Kincardine Bridge spans the River Forth, is the home of the Scottish Police College. The castle was built for George Keith Elphinstone (Admiral Lord Keith, one time senior officer of Lord Nelson), from money received from prize ships. Construction was carried out by a labour force said to include French prisoners of war. During the Second World War Tulliallan Castle was used by the Free Polish Army as its headquarters in Scotland. Prior to the Second World War there was no central training for police officers in Scotland, but immediately thereafter it was decided that probationer constables from all forces should be trained centrally and that some training for more senior officers should also be provided. The result was Tulliallan, purchased in 1950 by the then Scottish Home Department for £9,100. The building was modernised and renovated and the first courses for inspectors and sergeants began in 1954. Divisions =Probationer Training Division= The Police Scotland probationer training program takes a total of 2 years to complete . All new recruits to the Police Service of Scotland undergo an Initial Training Course at the college which lasts 11 weeks and culminates in a Passing out Parade. During this course recruits undergo training in various areas of policing including Police And The Community,Crime, Evidence, General Police Duties, Roads Policing, and Investigative Skills.SPC Prospectus In addition to classroom based activity, recruits also undergo Officer Safety Training, teaching them the skills of unarmed combat, baton techniques, handcuff techniques, and the use of PAVA Spray. Recruits also undergo intensive physical training, in various forms including circuits, bleep tests, forest runs, and are required to pass the Scottish Police Fitness Test. Probationer intakes at the Scottish Police College run every 3 months, beginning at the end of March, June, September and December each year. Following Passing Out, officers are on probation for two years. During this time Probationary Officers attend local training centres to undertake further assessment and fitness testing. =Roads Policing Division= A Driver Training unit was formed at the college in 1964. It was later known as the Traffic Division, and more recently the Roads Policing Division. The change in name reflects the new name adopted by the Police Service for this aspect of policing.SPC Prospectus The Roads Policing Division is responsible for training all officers of Police Scotland's Roads Policing Units, the division offers a number of courses, including, * Basic Road Patrol Officer Course * Advanced Police Driver Training * Pursuit Management * Police Motorcyclist Training * Tachograph Examination Training * Vehicle Examiner Training * Forensic Collision Investigators =Crime Management Division= In 1981 Detective Training also came to Tulliallan, this now falls within the remit of Crime Management Division, which amongst other things, is primarily focused in the training of Detective Officers. Some of the courses covered by this division include; *Initial Detective Training *Advanced Detective Training *Senior Investigating Officers Course *Drug Squad Training *Child Protection Training *Crime Scene Management *Family Liaison Officer Training Scottish Police College Website =Leadership and Management Division= Leadership and Management Division are responsible for the training of newly promoted officers, as well as officers undergoing training for promotion. Facilities The college benefits from custom built Scenario Training Rooms, which have been built to replicate common places in which police officers may find themselves. The college has the following Scenario Rooms; *Bank *Shop (fully stocked with groceries etc.) *Bedsit *Pub *Court Room The college also has a lecture theatre that seats 202 students. Police Scotland The Scottish Police College has been the headquarters of Police Scotland since 1 April 2013. Scottish Police Memorial The Flag of the Scottish Police Memorial Trust The Scottish Police Memorial, a memorial to all police officers who have lost their lives on duty in Scotland, is located within the grounds of the college, near to the entrance facing the main buildings. It is sheltered by established trees and is landscaped, affording both presence and privacy. The memorial comprises three large marble stones, which carry the names of all police officers known to have lost their lives on duty in Scotland, the first being in 1812. The stones sit in an area that has been transformed into a landscaped garden, with seating and shrubbery, affording privacy to visitors. A flagpole at the entrance to the area adjoins the main road through the college, and flies the specially commissioned memorial flag.http://www.spmt.scot/ References  External links  *Current official website 2015/2016 * *Virtual Tour of the Scottish Police College *Scottish Police Services Authority Police College Category:Education in Fife Category:Organisations based in Fife Category:Police training colleges in the United Kingdom ","title":"Scottish Police College"},{"id":"3921236","text":"The is a series of cabover microvans and kei trucks produced by the Japanese automaker Honda from 1977 to 2021, designed for the Japanese domestic market (JDM). \\"Acty\\" is short for \\"Activity\\". The Acty’s primary competitors are the Subaru Sambar, Suzuki Carry/Every, Daihatsu Hijet, Mazda Scrum, Nissan NT100/NV100 Clipper and the Mitsubishi Minicab. History The Acty range is designed to be economical, agile work vehicles, and generally lack luxury options, although air conditioning and power steering are available along with various trim, decoration, and customization options. The first generation was produced from 1977 to 1988 (model series TA, TB, TC, VD, VH), the second generation's years were 1988-1999 (model series HA1, HA2, HH1, HH2 with the E05A engine; HA3, HA4, HA5, HH3, HH4 with the EN07A engine - the Street continued in production until 2011) and the third generation's years were 1999-2009 (model series HA6, HA7, HH5, HH6 with E07Z engine) with the van still in production. The fourth generation was introduced, as a truck only, at the 41st Tokyo Motor Show in 2009 on December 17, showing the HA8 series and continuing to use the E07Z engine. Since the merger of the Subaru Sambar and Daihatsu Hijet, the Acty truck has become the only remaining Kei truck not to have a front-engine, rear-wheel-drive layout.  First generation The first Acty trucks were introduced July 27, 1977, and replaced several Keitoras Honda had previously offered, such as the Honda TN360 (most recently sold as the TN7) and the Honda T360. On 1 September 1975, the Japanese Government revised the rules on Road Trucking Vehicle Law that regulated the dimensions and engine size of vehicles in this class. As a result, the first Acty trucks and vans were available with a \\"midship\\" mounted 545 cc 2-cylinder SOHC water- cooled engine, known as the EH engine, which produces at 5500 rpm and of torque at 4000 rpm. This was about 50% larger than the engine used in the preceding TN7. Export models, with less emissions equipment, claim at the same engine speed. 1983 Acty (second facelift) 1985 Honda Street (late 1st gen) The van was introduced November 1979, although a truck-based panel van with a boxy rear was available from the beginning (TB). To save money, the van uses the same taillights as the truck and also has side doors with center mounted handles, meaning that the same pressing can be used for either side of the car. The Acty was exported to a number of markets, including Great Britain, where it is considered to have created an entire new category. The Suzuki Carry/Bedford Rascal was GM's response to the Acty in the British market.Wren, p. 76 An upper trim level of the Acty van intended mainly for passenger usage went on sale 1 February 1981 and was called the Honda Street ; it was produced for two generations of the Acty van. Available with a standard or an all-new high roof design, the high roof was also made available for the Acty van (SDX only). The name was discontinued in 2001 after the Honda Vamos name had been reintroduced as a replacement trim level for the Street, on a shared platform of the Acty van. In March 1983 the four-wheel drive Acty/Street was added. This model receives 12-inch wheels for increased ground clearance and has an engine with an improved cylinder head, increasing power to at 5300 rpm and torque to at 3500 rpm. This was also the first Acty/Street to receive a five- speed manual gearbox, initially only available on the 4WD models. A larger, was also part of the 4WD's equipment. In June 1982 the series received a facelift, with wraparound turn signals. At this time the Hondamatic version was added, as was the \\"Big Cab\\" version, with a passenger compartment stretched by . While the Acty has round headlamps, the Street received square units after the facelift. Starting with model year 1985, the Acty/Street was exclusive to a chain of Japanese Honda dealerships established for small and commercial vehicles, called Honda Primo. =Export versions= The Acty was also sold in a few export markets, such as the United Kingdom and Australia. Subsequent models were marketed almost entirely in the Japanese domestic market only. As a bit of an oddity, the Acty was sold during 1982 in Australia, but was made unavailable inside of Sydney due to concerns by Honda that the vehicle was underpowered for the hilly terrain.  Second generation The second generation Acty was launched in March 1988 with the introduction of the Honda E05 engine, with an additional cylinder added, making it a 547 cc 3-cylinder with SOHC. The engine is rated at 5500 rpm and of torque at 5,000 rpm. The first models were the Acty truck and van, with the commercial grade Acty van appearing a month later. The 4WD models (HA-4) were no longer available with an automatic transmission. There was also an \\"Acty Attack\\" version of the truck, intended for farmers in particular this model has a differential lock in the rear and features Ultra-Low forward and reverse gears (UL/UR). The other models of STD, SDX, SDX2 and TOWN had slight variations with the TOWN and SDX2 adding a color coded (white) bumper and tachometer. The TOWN features tweed seats with a brown interior (as opposed to \\"vinyl\\" like seats on STD models). The only other notable options were a light for rear work area and radio. 1992 Honda Acty van (first facelift) The original Actys have distinct round headlights while the Street has large, rectangular headlamps. The truck and van originally shared the same taillights. After the March 1990 facelift the Acty received the same headlights as the Street, while all models grew longer by as the result of altered kei car regulations. At this time the Street also received the taillights from the contemporary Honda Today (which were also used for the third generation Acty van). The 1990 changeover also meant that the 547 cc engine was replaced with the larger 656 cc Honda E07A engine (with fuel injection added in 1996). The carburetted version of this engine produced at 5,300 rpm and of torque at 4,500 rpm. The Street could reach a top speed of , while the four-wheel drive version only could attain . Post-1996 Honda Acty truck (final facelift) In October 1993 the Honda Street's front design was changed yet again, receiving larger, more square headlamp units. A PGM-FI version in \\"Fox\\" and \\"Xi\\" equipment levels was also introduced to the Street at this time. This version produces . The front end changes were applied to the Acty as well, beginning in January 1994. The Acty and the Street were further modified in January 1996 when the turn signals were changed from amber to clear. At this time, the fuel injected Acty SDX-Hi was also introduced - only with two-wheel drive and a five-speed manual - with the same engine as the Street Xi (the Fox was dropped, replaced by the carburetted Street V). Production of the Acty continued until the arrival of the third generation in 1999, although the Honda Street continued to be built until 2001 as it was only partially replaced by the pricier Honda Vamos.  Third generation The third generation Acty truck was introduced on 27 May 1999. The van went on sale one month later. On September 30, 1996, the Japanese Government amended the Enforcement Regulations Vehicle Law, Ministerial Ordinance No. 53, which addressed safety requirements for front passengers, but did not allow for larger overall dimensions. Honda pushed the driving position back while keeping the engine in its traditional location underneath the vehicle. The new design retained the mid-engined, rear-wheel-drive layout although it was now of a \\"semi-bonneted\\" design. Meeting the increased safety requirements was a major focus during development. The base price of the pickup model is ¥777,000 (approximately $7,920 USD), with the van starting at ¥1,060,500 (approximately $10,810 USD) as of December 2008. Four-wheel drive is available as an option on all vans, and all but one model of pickup truck, making the Acty one of a handful of mid-engine, AWD vehicles that are not designed as supercars. 1999 Honda Acty van (3rd generation) The 656 cc engine is of an LEV design, with low emissions and high gas mileage. Fuel economy was further increased by the use of electric power steering. Max power in 1999 was at 5,000 rpm. The engine was since upgraded to the current 660 cc 12-valve inline-three E07Z gasoline engine making at 7,000 rpm and of torque at 4,000 rpm (4WD models). Currently, the maximum payload is . The truck was available as a basic standard model, SDX (Super Deluxe) and more comfortable Town versions. There was also the Acty Attack, a spartanly equipped four-wheel drive version with a differential lock, particularly intended for farmers. The van was available as a two-seater Pro-B (with division) or as the somewhat more comfortable Pro-A. There were also four-seater SDX and Town versions. The Acty van (and the related Vamos Hobio) kept using the taillights of the 1988 facelift version of the Honda Today. The \\"Street\\" name was discontinued in favor of the Honda Vamos, based on the Acty van. In December 2009 the Acty truck was replaced by the new fourth generation model, but the bonneted Acty van continued to be produced with the third generation bodywork. On 12 July 2018, the Acty van was discontinued and it was replaced by the N-Van.  Fourth generation (truck) Fourth generation On 17 December 2009, the fourth generation Acty truck was introduced. As for the Daihatsu Hijet and Suzuki Carry competitors, this model has become delinked from the van as a result of differing safety requirements for commercial vehicles and passenger-type vans. It continues to use the predecessor and van's E07Z engine, although now with . The chassis codes are HA8 (2WD) or HA9 (4WD). The wheelbase was shortened dramatically, returning to the as used on the second generation Acty, in order to increase cabin space and to shrink the turning circle. In June 2012 the Acty underwent some light modifications so as to meet new upcoming standards on lighting. On November 2018 Honda has renewed the \\"Spirit Color Style,\\" a special-purpose vehicle commemorating the 55th anniversary of T360, the origin of Honda's four-wheeled vehicle, based on the \\"TOWN\\" type, in the light commercial vehicle \\"ACTY TRUCK\\" released on Friday, November 9th.\\"Spirit Color Style,\\" a special- purpose vehicle - Honda(11/13/2019) Discontinuation The Acty will be discontinued in 2021 due to the new emission regulations, mandatory of crash mitigation brakes that must be installed sequentially, thus increasing development costs. In popular culture In the Shuichi Shigeno manga and anime Initial D, as well as the Arcade Stage games, The Honda Acty is often seen in the background. Youtube series The Midnight Garage commonly uses a modified Honda Acty as a parts hauler for their other project cars A Honda Acty van was used as the 'Sooty Mobile' in the UK Children's TV show, The Sooty Show, during the 1980's and could be seen in various outdoor episodes. The van was subsequently passed on to a neighbour of Matthew Corbett (then the presenter of the show) and used for road trips across Europe, before being rediscovered in a garage after 20 years.

G. Wodehouse, first published in the United Kingdom on 27 July 1928 by Herbert Jenkins, London, and in the United States on 28 September 1928 by Doubleday, Doran, New York. Immediately prior to publication it appeared as a serial, in London Calling magazine (UK) from 3 March to 28 July 1928 and in Liberty magazine (US) between 16 June and 22 September 1928.McIlvaine (1990), pp. 54–55, A39. Overview The action is mostly set at Rudge Hall, home to miser Lester Carmody, and at Healthward Ho, a health farm run by \\"Chimp\\" Twist, along with his cohorts \\"Soapy\\" and \\"Dolly\\" Molloy, who all previously appeared in Sam the Sudden (1925), and returned in Money in the Bank (1946). Hugo Carmody, Lester's nephew, and his friend Ronnie Fish also appear at Blandings Castle, home of Ronnie's uncle Lord Emsworth, in Summer Lightning (1929) and Heavy Weather (1933). Plot summary As well as Lester and Hugo, John Carroll, another nephew of Lester's, also lives at Rudge Hall; he is the manager of the estate. A diffident fellow, he is in love with Pat Wyvern, the daughter of the irascible Colonel Meredith Wyvern. Pat likes John but deplores his lack of backbone. In any case, the Colonel would not hear of their marrying because he is at daggers-drawn with Lester due to an incident involving an explosion. Lester, who is a devoted trencherman, despite his miserliness, has enrolled on a fitness course at Healthward Ho. Hugo travels over there with the aim of touching his uncle for £500 to start a nightclub with his friend Ronnie Fish. Predictably he is rebuffed. John travels up to London to meet Pat, who has just returned from France. Hugo hitches a ride. They all go out to a nightclub, The Mustard Spoon, where they are joined by Ronnie and by Soapy and Dolly Molloy, whom Hugo has just met at a boxing match. Soapy and Dolly are a pair of fraudsters, and partners in crime to Chimp. They are a married couple, but are pretending to be father and daughter. John proposes to Pat, but she rejects him. The club is raided by the police and they flee. They all end up at Rudge Hall, where Soapy tries to sell Lester some oil stocks. It emerges, to Soapy's dismay, that Lester is not the wealthy landowner he thought he was; in fact he is broke. Dolly comes up with the idea of stealing Lester's family heirlooms and claiming the insurance (the heirlooms do not legally belong to Lester, so cannot be sold). She describes the scheme as “Money for Nothing”. Lester initially attempts to steal the heirlooms himself, with disastrous results, so they rope in Chimp. Chimp is caught in the act by Hugo, but gets away. In order to get rid of Hugo, and stop him foiling their scheme again, Lester gives him and Ronnie £500 to start their nightclub (we learn in Summer Lightning that the venture is a failure). Chimp is persuaded to have another go, and this time the burglary goes smoothly, or so it seems. But Chimp has been seen and recognised by the butler, Sturgis, who informs John. John travels to Healthward Ho to confront Chimp. Dolly goes with him and puts knock-out drops into his drink when they arrive. Chimp locks John up in a room with bars on the window, but eventually John turns the tables on the conspirators, and learns to his horror that Lester is in on the plot. He dashes back to Rudge Hall and confronts his uncle. As a penance, Lester agrees to make it up with Wyvern. In the meantime, Pat, thinking that John has run off with Dolly, has accepted Hugo's proposal of marriage. When she learns of John's heroism she realises the error of her ways and sweetness and light reign. Background The setting of the novel was inspired by Hunstanton Hall, Hunstanton.

Biography Wallace was born in Brooklyn, New York, the second of nine children of working class Jewish immigrants from Austria. Pursuing a dancing career, she was in her teens when she saw a casting call advertisement in the newspaper and landed a role in the 1928 Earl Carroll Broadway theatre production of Vanities that was billed as having the \\"most beautiful girls in the world\\". She adopted the surname \\"Wallace\\" as her stage name and went on to appear in six similar risqué productions that featured scanty costumes for the female performers and full nudity for the first time on Broadway. Beryl Wallace and producer Earl Carroll began a personal relationship that would take them to Hollywood where she would perform in film and at his Earl Carroll Theatre. The theatre-supper club's facade was adorned by what at the time was one of Hollywood's most famous landmarks: a -high neon facial portrait of Beryl Wallace of which a recreation can be seen today at Universal CityWalk, at Universal City, as part of the collection of historic neon signs from the Museum of Neon Art. Beryl Wallace made her film debut in 1934 in an uncredited role in the Paramount Pictures film production of Carroll's Broadway play Murder at the Vanities. She went on to appear in a number of small roles until 1937, when she co- starred in the Monogram Pictures \\"B\\" Western film production of Romance of the Rockies with Tom Keene. This led to another co-starring role in the 1938 film, Air Devils. In the early 1940s she continued appearing in bit parts, but also had good secondary roles in Republic Pictures \\"B\\" Westerns starring the likes of Roy Rogers and Richard Dix. While acting in twenty-two films over a ten- year period, Wallace's primary job was as a star entertainer at Earl Carroll's theatre. During World War II, Wallace sang weekly on two 15-minute radio shows and on Monday evenings hosted a half-hour entertainment show on NBC radio called Furlough Fun. In addition to helping entertain soldiers at the Masquers Club, on Sunday afternoons she was a volunteer dancer at the Hollywood Canteen. Death On June 17, 1948, while en route from Los Angeles to New York City, Beryl Wallace and Earl Carroll died in the crash of United Airlines Flight 624 in Aristes, Pennsylvania. They were interred together in the Garden of Memory at Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery, Glendale, California.

The track, released August 22, 1989, was the album's first single and depicts negativity towards the stereotypical egotistic lifestyle of a typical rock star and was considered to be disavowing of drugs. \\"Knock Me Down\\" peaked at number six on the Billboard Modern Rock Tracks. Recording The band recorded basic tracks during March and early April 1989 at Hully Gully studios in Silver Lake. \\"Knock Me Down\\" originated during these sessions, and was formed from jam sessions without any input from returning producer Michael Beinhorn. According to Flea, the Hully Gully sessions bore fruit: \\"We played hard and fast more than at any other time in our career, I think. A lot of chops were going down ... we played constantly, got to know each other, and came up with a record.\\"Apter, 2004, p. 185. Kiedis and Flea recognized that Frusciante's presence had become a significant influence on the band's new material as the Hully Gully sessions were proving to be extremely productive; Flea recalled that \\"Frusciante was an immense new element to the sound of our band and a big opening up for us.\\" Composition \\"Knock Me Down\\" became one of the most radical shifts in style for the band.Apter, 2004, pp. 184–190. The introspective lyrics, which analyze the death of Hillel Slovak and the devastating effect drugs can have, were a new approach for Kiedis, who primarily wrote of sexual intercourse and a hedonistic lifestyle. The vocalist did not, however, want the track to be associated with \\"anti-drug\\" sentiments, claiming, \\"[the song] is about letting your friends know that you need help and then being willing to accept the help of others when you need it, whether it's from drugs or a number of other personal problems.\\"Apter, 2004, p. 191. According to music journalist Jeff Apter, the song \\"Knock Me Down\\" was \\"clearly the most important track the band had ever laid down; it proved that these Peppers were more than knuckleheads with socks hanging off their cocks.\\" Musically, the track integrates the Chili Peppers' typical punk influences, but asserts heavier emphasis on melody and harmonics that lead into more alternative territory. \\"Knock Me Down\\" was originally recorded to be a duet between vocalist Anthony Kiedis and guitarist John Frusciante, but the song was remixed before being released as a single; the new mix accidentally highlighted the guitarist's voice instead of Kiedis'.Apter, 2004, p. 196. The original, longer version of this song is featured on the bonus Mother's Milk CD, which contains additional verses and an extended bridge. In this version, Kiedis' vocals are mixed to appear more prominent. In 1988, former guitarist Hillel Slovak died of a heroin overdose. The song serves as a tribute to Slovak; according to Kiedis, \\"It was a song that described what it was like to be a drug addict, to have that ego and to think you were impenetrable and impervious to the forces of nature and life. But it was also a love song for Hillel.\\"Kiedis, 2004. p. 231 The guitar riff of the song \\"Knock Me Down\\" was based on the song \\"Miss You\\" by The Rolling Stones. \\"Knock Me Down\\" is a playable track on Guitar Hero: On Tour.  Live performances  \\"Knock Me Down\\" was performed 32 times during the Mother's Milk tour but has not been performed since 1990. Group photographer Tony Woolliscroft once requested it at a private studio rehearsal many years later. Frusciante launched into the opening chords, but Kiedis refused to sing it.

It was the last of Preston's two albums for the Beatles' Apple label, after which he moved to A&M; Records. The album was co-produced by George Harrison and Preston. Harrison's songs \\"All Things Must Pass\\" and \\"My Sweet Lord\\" were issued here for the first time, two months before his own recordings appeared on his triple album All Things Must Pass. Released as a single, Preston's \\"My Sweet Lord\\" peaked at number 90 on the US Billboard Hot 100 chart in February 1971 but the album failed to chart in Britain or America. Despite its lack of commercial success, Encouraging Words is considered by some commentators to be among the best Apple albums released by an artist other than the Beatles or one of the band members. The album was reissued in 1993 and 2010 with Preston's non-album single \\"All That I've Got (I'm Gonna Give It to You)\\" among the bonus tracks. Background and songs As on the previous year's That's the Way God Planned It, Billy Preston worked closely with George Harrison on the album. With the Beatles' career essentially over, after John Lennon had privately announced his departure from the band in September 1969, Harrison dedicated himself to projects by his Apple signings such as Preston, Doris Troy and devotees from the London Radha Krishna Temple. On Encouraging Words, he co-produced with Preston and contributed as a musician, backing vocalist and songwriter. Typically of Preston's approach to developing his songs over time, some of the album's tracks were first recorded during the sessions for That's the Way God Planned It. \\"Let the Music Play\\" and \\"Use What You Got\\" dated from his time on Capitol Records, the label to which he was signed until, shortly after Preston played on the Beatles' Let It Be sessions in January 1969, Harrison organized for his transferral to the Beatles' Apple label. \\"You've Been Acting Strange\\", written by Ronnie Lee Williams, was a song that Preston rehearsed with the Beatles during the same sessions. Encouraging Words also contains \\"I've Got a Feeling\\", a Lennon–McCartney song from Let It Be, which remained unreleased until May 1970. Harrison let Preston record his composition \\"All Things Must Pass\\", which the Beatles had also rehearsed in January 1969. \\"Sing One for the Lord\\", written by Harrison and Preston, was one of the first recordings the pair made together, in February 1969. In a 1971 interview, Preston said of their respective cross- denominational approach: \\"The names change: his is Krishna; mine is Christ. The spiritual promotion praising God, chanting, spreading it, turning people onto it – these are the things we have in common.\\" Harrison also let Preston record \\"My Sweet Lord\\", the writing for which began, with input from Preston, when they were in Copenhagen in December 1969 during Delaney & Bonnie and Friends' European tour. Originally titled \\"Drop Out\\", the song \\"Encouraging Words\\" contains lyrics in which Preston urges: \\"Be kind, be cool, and be careful / Have hope, keep the faith, baby, and be grateful.\\" In the same 1971 interview, Preston said: \\"My message is to change the image of most entertainers as 'stars', singing lollipop shit. I want to give people something that they'll really remember, to help their lives ... and what I'm talking about is God – a good, solid message that makes you think.\\" The majority of the songs were written by Preston alone, with occasional input from gospel singers Jesse Kirkland and Joe Greene. Recording Following the completion of That's the Way God Planned It in July 1969, Harrison and Preston were due to begin work on further recordings in November, starting with a new single. When Preston's return to Britain was delayed by problems in obtaining a work permit, Harrison used the available time to join his friend Eric Clapton on the Delaney & Bonnie tour. The sessions with Preston instead began in London in mid to late December. Encouraging Words retained some of the all- star personnel from its predecessor − again featuring Clapton as well as Harrison on guitar − augmented by the likes of Ringo Starr, Klaus Voormann and various members of Delaney & Bonnie's band. Studio records state that Clapton played guitar on \\"Encouraging Words\\", along with Delaney Bramlett; on \\"Right Now\\", recorded in December 1969, and chosen to open the album; and \\"Use What You Got\\", which Harrison decided to remake rather than use the version that Preston had recorded for Capitol in 1968. In the same way, a new version of \\"Let the Music Play\\" was taped, at Olympic Studios in January 1970. Other contributors to the sessions included members of the Temptations' and Sam and Dave's backing bands, since both of these American soul acts happened to be touring in the UK at the time. When the Edwin Hawkins Singers arrived in London in January, they too recorded with Preston, adding gospel vocals to \\"My Sweet Lord\\" and \\"Sing One for the Lord\\". According to author Simon Leng, the album represents a more sympathetic setting for Preston's music than had been the case on That's the Way God Planned It, and is a more successful blend of soul and rock. In late April 1970, Harrison arrived in New York, where he was said to be working on Preston's album. It is possible that orchestral strings were overdubbed onto \\"All Things Must Pass\\" and \\"Little Girl\\" at this point, after which Harrison collaborated briefly with Bob Dylan. Mixing was completed on Encouraging Words by May. That same month, with Preston as one of the many backing musicians, Harrison began recording his All Things Must Pass triple album, which included his versions of \\"My Sweet Lord\\" and \\"All Things Must Pass\\". Release and reception Encouraging Words was released in Britain on September 11, 1970 (with the Apple catalogue number SAPCOR 14) and in America on November 9 (as ST 3370). To tie in with the album's release, \\"My Sweet Lord\\" was issued as a single in some European countries. In early December, by which point Harrison's version was dominating the airwaves, the single was released in the US, with \\"Little Girl\\" on the B-side. The single peaked at number 90 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart of February 27, 1971. In Billboards album review, the writer welcomed Harrison's production and songwriting contributions. The reviewer continued: \\"Preston's got that church feeling, and gospel backgrounds ring out behind his jazzy, soulful and high revival treatments of the Beatles' 'I Got a Feeling,' 'Right Now' and 'Little Girl.' Preston is a complete musician with a classy concept of gospel-rock.\\" Although it failed to achieve commercial success, Encouraging Words came to be viewed as one of Preston's best albums by his fans, and one of the best non-Beatle Apple releases. In 1974, by which time Preston had had several major chart hits as an A&M; Records artist, Harrison was attempting to acquire the rights to Preston's Apple albums and reissue them. In an interview for the NME that year, Preston attributed his lack of success on the Beatles' label largely to the \\"internal dissension at Apple\\" and said that he and Harrison were \\"convinced that some of those Apple cuts were among the best I've ever done\\". Available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). In the 2010 BBC Radio program Billy Preston: That's the Way God Planned It, former Yes keyboardist Rick Wakeman, the show's presenter, lamented that Preston's solo career tended to be overshadowed by his work as a sideman for better-known acts such as the Beatles and the Rolling Stones. With reference to That's the Way God Planned It and Encouraging Words, Wakeman said: \\"It's very frustrating when people only remember Billy as a session man, because these two largely overlooked albums are absolute gems – a perfect combination of gospel and funk.\\" Apple historian and Record Collector journalist Andy Davis describes the two albums as \\"warm powerful soul records that blend gospel, funk and R&B;, shot through with elements of rock\\", and he highlights Encouraging Words as \\"one of the finest titles in the Apple Records catalogue\\". The 1993 and 2010 CD releases of Encouraging Words included Preston's rare Apple A-side \\"All That I've Got (I'm Gonna Give It to You)\\", recorded in December 1969. Released in January 1970, the song was co-written with soul singer Doris Troy, whose self-titled Apple album was originally released on the same day as Encouraging Words.

Its most notable product, Mennen Speed Stick, with its fougère perfume and green wide stick, was the US market leader among deodorants and antiperspirants for men for many years. It was also noted for its Lady Speed Stick deodorant and Teen Spirit deodorant, which was the leader in teenage girls' deodorants during the early 1990s. In France, the Mennen branding is owned by L'Oréal through its Mennen-LASCAD subsidiary, for a line of men's grooming products.L'Oréal France: Mennen contact beaute-test.com: Les produits de la marque Mennen  History  The Mennen Company was founded in 1878 by Gerhard Heinrich Mennen, an immigrant to America from Germany. His first product was talcum-based powder, an innovation at the time. The company was originally located in Newark, New Jersey, US moving to Morristown, New Jersey in 1953, where it manufactured and sold over-the-counter pharmaceuticals and personal products such as the Skin Bracer, Speed Stick, and Baby Magic products. Lady Speed Stick was a foray into the women's market, and was a huge success due to its shape, which fit a woman's hand, and fragrances. Gerhard's grandson, G. Mennen Williams, served as Governor of Michigan from 1949-1961 and as Assistant Secretary of State for African Affairs under Presidents John F. Kennedy and Lyndon B. Johnson from 1961-1966. The company was led by several generations of the Mennen family before being sold to Colgate- Palmolive Company in 1992. Today none of the Mennen family is involved in the company or its current parent. The former headquarters building, in Morris Twp., New Jersey, is in the process of being demolished. Next to it remains the Mennen Arena, a multi-purpose sports facility often used for hockey and public ice skating. At Harpers Ferry National Historical Park, there is a giant advertisement painted on the rock face of Maryland Heights. While faded and indistinct today, it reads \\"Mennen's Borated Talcum Toilet Powder\\" and was painted between 1903 and 1906.Harpers Ferry National Historical Park FAQ  Today  Today, the name Mennen is being phased out in some regions and products in many countries are becoming known simply as Speed Stick or Lady Speed Stick. In North America, both products, as well as Skin Bracer and Afta are still being marketed as being \\"by Mennen,\\" where the name is still well- known and holds positive connotations. The Baby Magic line was sold to Playtex, who has since sold the brand to Naterra; Colgate-Palmolive retained the Baby Magic branding (as Baby Magic Mennen) for the Latin American market.Baby Magic Mennen  References  External links * Colgate- Palmolive * Mennen France Category:Colgate-Palmolive brands Category:L'Oréal Category:Companies established in 1878 ","title":"Mennen"},{"id":"3921319","title":"Aeroplane (Red Hot Chili Peppers song)"},{"id":"3921324","text":"In mathematics, in the area of combinatorics and quantum calculus, the q-derivative, or Jackson derivative, is a q-analog of the ordinary derivative, introduced by Frank Hilton Jackson. It is the inverse of Jackson's q-integration. For other forms of q-derivative, see (). Definition The q-derivative of a function f(x) is defined asF. H. Jackson (1908), On q-functions and a certain difference operator, Trans. Roy. Soc. Edin., 46, 253-281.Victor Kac, Pokman Cheung, Quantum Calculus, Universitext, Springer- Verlag, 2002. Ernst, T.

The q-derivative is also known as the Jackson derivative. Formally, in terms of Lagrange's shift operator in logarithmic variables, it amounts to the operator :D_q= \\\\frac{1}{x} ~ \\\\frac{q^{d~~~ \\\\over d (\\\\ln x)} -1}{q-1} ~, which goes to the plain derivative \\\\to \\\\frac{d}{dx} as q \\\\to 1. It is manifestly linear, :\\\\displaystyle D_q (f(x)+g(x)) = D_q f(x) + D_q g(x)~. It has product rule analogous to the ordinary derivative product rule, with two equivalent forms :\\\\displaystyle D_q (f(x)g(x)) = g(x)D_q f(x) + f(qx)D_q g(x) = g(qx)D_q f(x) + f(x)D_q g(x). Similarly, it satisfies a quotient rule, :\\\\displaystyle D_q (f(x)/g(x)) = \\\\frac{g(x)D_q f(x) - f(x)D_q g(x)}{g(qx)g(x)},\\\\quad g(x)g(qx) eq 0. There is also a rule similar to the chain rule for ordinary derivatives. Let g(x) = c x^k. Then :\\\\displaystyle D_q f(g(x)) = D_{q^k}(f)(g(x))D_q(g)(x). The eigenfunction of the q-derivative is the q-exponential eq(x). Relationship to ordinary derivatives Q-differentiation resembles ordinary differentiation, with curious differences. For example, the q-derivative of the monomial is: :\\\\left(\\\\frac{d}{dz}\\\\right)_q z^n = \\\\frac{1-q^n}{1-q} z^{n-1} = [n]_q z^{n-1} where [n]_q is the q-bracket of n. Note that \\\\lim_{q\\\\to 1}[n]_q = n so the ordinary derivative is regained in this limit. The n-th q-derivative of a function may be given as: :(D^n_q f)(0)= \\\\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!} \\\\frac{(q;q)_n}{(1-q)^n}= \\\\frac{f^{(n)}(0)}{n!} [n]_q! provided that the ordinary n-th derivative of f exists at x = 0. Here, (q;q)_n is the q-Pochhammer symbol, and [n]_q! is the q-factorial. If f(x) is analytic we can apply the Taylor formula to the definition of D_q(f(x)) to get :\\\\displaystyle D_q(f(x)) = \\\\sum_{k=0}^{\\\\infty}\\\\frac{(q-1)^k}{(k+1)!} x^k f^{(k+1)}(x). A q-analog of the Taylor expansion of a function about zero follows: :f(z)=\\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty f^{(n)}(0)\\\\,\\\\frac{z^n}{n!} = \\\\sum_{n=0}^\\\\infty (D^n_q f)(0)\\\\,\\\\frac{z^n}{[n]_q!}.

He also became a social reformer in the United States of America by working on state boards and commissions in such areas as workmen's compensation and retirement benefits. Alexander was the son of Alexander M. and M. (Jelenkiewicz) A. Alexander. He studied mechanics, metallurgy, and electrical engineering at the Austrian universities of Vienna, 1889, the Leoben, 1891, and the University of Gratz, 1892. Following the completion of his engineering education, Alexander was employed by Austria's largest steel-making company. In 1893, he joined Weston Electrical Instrument Company as an engineer and a technical designer. In the following year, he was recruited by Westinghouse Electric and Manufacturing Co., and he emigrated to the United States. After five years with the Westinghouse Corp., he joined the Siemens and Halske Electric Co., a German corporation with operations in North America. In the year 1900, the General Electric Company hired him as its chief engineer in charge of design, which was a position that he held until 1918. Thereafter, he served as GE's consulting engineer on economic issues until 1922. While with General Electric, Alexander began turning his attention to industrial education. He created and directed the General Electric Education and Personnel Department in Lynn, Massachusetts. In 1907, he set up a partnership between G.E. and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in which G.E. provided both apprenticeships and in-house technical courses for newly graduated M.I.T. engineers. Alexander also served on the Old Age Pension Commission of Massachusetts and on the Massachusetts Workman's Compensation Commission. He became a charter member of the National Association of Corporate schools, the American Management Association, the National Society for the Promotion of Industrial Education, and of the American Institute of Electrical Engineers (AIEE). Alexander was an early participant, along with Wesley Mitchell and Malcolm Rorty, in the National Bureau of Economic Research. He also created the National Industrial Conference Board (now known as The Conference Board) along with Frederick P. Fish, Frank A. Vanderlip, and Loyall Osborne. References * Noble, David F.

The ski jumping portion took place at Canada Olympic Park, while the cross-country portion took place at Canmore Nordic Centre. The Calgary Games saw two substantial changes in the Nordic combined program. A team event was added, marking the first time that more than one medal would be awarded in Nordic combined. The combined events also changed their format, replacing the points-based system used in previous years with the Gundersen method, in which ski jumping points totals were translated to time gaps for a pursuit cross-country race. This change ensured that the first competitor across the finish line in the cross-country race was the overall Olympic champion.

About the film The film is the first attempt to document the Glastonbury Festival, which in 1971 was in its second year. Glastonbury Fayre is notable for being photographed by Nicolas Roeg and being one of the first films produced by David Puttnam. The film is a mix of performances from the likes of Arthur Brown and Fairport Convention, as well as scenes of festival-goers enjoying the festival. It does not feature any footage of David Bowie, who played at dawn, but he is on the soundtrack. An album of performances from the festival, Glastonbury Fayre, was also released in 1972 and has since become a rare collectors' item; however, it features no performances in common with the film. The film received a VHS release during the 1990s but has since been deleted. A DVD of the film was released with the CD edition of the Akarma reissue of the album. A four-minute clip of the film featured on the extras of the 2005 Glastonbury Anthems DVD. An 87-minute DVD of Glastonbury Fayre is available.

He is thought to have founded the dynasty of Mitanni, but no contemporary inscriptions from his time are known to exist. He may have lived around 1500 BC. His offsprings included Suttarna I and Barattarna, who was noted for his participation in the battle of Megiddo between 1479 and 1426 BCE. Late Bronze Age literary and ritual Ugarit texts described him as a warrior hero raised among the \\"shades of the earth\\" in the gathering of Didanu. It is suggested that these references indicated the king's nomadic ancestry as they possibly alluded to an affinity with the Amorite tribe. The Epic of Kirta from the clay tablets of Ugarit tells the story of the near-extinction of the royal house of Keret, though it was written much later and by a country hostile to the descendants of the king. The text goes thus. All of his children died and his wife \\"departed.\\" In a dream, the creator god, El, instructs him to appeal for help from the rain god, Baal, and then launch an expedition to find a new wife. He journeys and on the way comes to the shrine of the mother goddess Asherah. He promises to give the goddess an offering of a golden statue if he finds a wife. Kirta finds a wife and has several children, but forgets his promise to Asherah. Asherah punishes Kirta with a debilitating illness, but El once again comes to the rescue. His other children are happy to have him back on the throne, but his eldest son, Yassib, had gained popularity while Kirta was ill and attempts to overtake the throne. Kirta curses Yassib, and there the text ends. Mitanni's rise under Kirta might have been facilitated by the disappearance of the Babylonian kingdom. One of the earliest references that mentioned his kingdom was a Theban stele of Amenemhat, an Egyptian astronomer. Some scholars argue that the texts containing Kirta were popular literary narratives that served as anti-royal critique.

These buildings are often former monastic properties which became parish churches after the English Reformation or civic parish churches built at a time of great wealth. Greater Churches Network The Greater Churches Network was founded in 1991 as a self-help organisation within the Church of England. It aimed to provide help and mutual support to its member churches in dealing with the special problems of running a \\"cathedral-like\\" church with the organisation and financial structure of a parish church. The group met every two years in conference to share ideas. These Greater Churches were defined as \\"non-cathedral churches which, by virtue of their great age, size, historical, architectural, or ecclesiastical importance, display many of the characteristics of a cathedral\\", and those which \\" fulfil a role which is additional to that of a normal parish church\\".About us at greaterchurches.org At its disbanding in 2019 there were 55 churches within the Greater Churches Network. Several of these buildings are former monastic properties that were converted to parish church use after the English Reformation. Others are large parish churches built at a time of great wealth. What they share in common are the requirements to offer facilities to many visitors, host special services, offer community access and fund the specialist maintenance and repair of these large buildings, most of which are Grade I listed.  Refounding  In May 2019, a meeting of the Greater Churches Network took a decision to rename the group as the Major Churches Network, and to adopt a new constitution. The Greater Churches Network was therefore formally closed, and the new Major Churches Network was formed, and its inaugural general meeting took place. The change was made in response to an important study commissioned into Major Parish Churches under the auspices of the Church Buildings Council, the official body with overall responsibility for the Church of England parish churches and chapels, together with Historic England and the National Lottery Heritage Fund. This resulted in the appointment of a “Cathedrals and Major Churches Officer” within the CBC, and the identification of around 300 churches in England which met certain agreed criteria. These define a “Major Parish Church” as having exceptional significance, being physically very large (over 1000m2 footprint), listed as Grade I, II* (or exceptionally II), open to visitors daily, having a role or roles beyond those of a typical parish church, and making a considerable civic, cultural, and economic contribution to their community.

On 1 April 2013, Tulliallan Castle became the headquarters of Police Scotland (the newly created national police service for Scotland), but in 2014 the service's headquarters temporarily relocated to nearby Stirling in the former Central Scotland Police HQ. 14th- century castle An earlier structure about northwest, Old Tulliallan Castle, was built by 1304, when it was ordered to be strengthened by Edward I of England, it then passed into the ownership of William Douglas, 1st Earl of Douglas, and was granted by the Douglases to the Edmonstones, and thence to a junior branch of the Blackadders, and finally to the Bruces of Carnock. A fortified house with a keep and rib-vaulted ground floor, it was abandoned in the seventeenth century. 19th-century castle The castle was built in 1812–1820 for Admiral Lord Keith, one time senior officer of Lord Nelson, from money received from prize ships. The labour force said to include French prisoners of war. During the Second World War it was used by the Polish Armed Forces in the West as their headquarters in Scotland. Prior to the Second World War there was no central training for police officers in Scotland. After the war it was decided to centralise all police training and Tulliallan was the result. Tulliallan, from the Gaelic Tulach-Aluin ('beautiful knoll') was purchased in 1950 by the then Scottish Home Department for £9,100. The building was modernised and renovated and the first courses for inspectors and sergeants began in 1954. Over the years the site has been heavily modified to provide accommodation, catering, training, and teaching facilities for the Scottish Police College. The building is now used as the administrative head of the Scottish Police College and also serves as the official residence of the Chief Constable of Police Scotland.

As the Ottoman Empire became to move into the early modern period, “vacant timars, instead of being reassigned, were often added to the itltizam system”, paving the way for a fundamental change in the Ottoman fiscal system into a monetized system, and allowing various power- brokers to involve themselves in the Ottoman bureaucracy that had previously been limited to the kul.Darling, Linda T. \\"Public finances: the role of the Ottoman centre.\\" The Cambridge History of Turkey: 118-32. This served to both open up the echelons of power to those previously excluded, while also serving to move power away from the sultan and into a larger group of nobles who now held more permanent grasps on power, and the ability to perpetuate their wealth. History In the Ottoman fiscal organization, mukata’a lands stand in opposition to the timar system, where plots of land were assigned to sipahis, who held the right to tax the peasants (reaya) on that land a portion of their crops every growing season, as compensation for the sipahis’ service in the Sultan's army.Tezcan, Baki. The Second Ottoman Empire: Political and Social Transformation in the Early Modern World. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2012. 14-37 Whereas timars could be reassigned at any time, with promotions to more lucrative positions often entailing transfer to another province, mukata’a were under the control of their lease-holder for the length of the contract, eventually extending to life-terms. The other important distinction between the two was unlike in timar, mukata’a revenues were collected in bullion, at least by the state, providing much-needed sources of currency to the Treasury.Inalcik, Halil. \\"Military and Fiscal Transformations in the Ottoman Empire.\\" Archivum Ottomanicum 6 (1980): 283-337. Reprinted in Studies in Ottoman Social and Economic History, London, Variorum, 1985. Role in the Ottoman Transformation The move away from timar farming, and to privatized revenue collection, took place against the backdrop of massive upheaval in the 17th and early 18th Century Ottoman Empire. Previously, the timar system had been supported by the unrelenting Ottoman advance into newly conquered territories, which served to open up new territories to be assigned, as well as provided spoils of war to pay troops, which encouraged continual campaigning. However, the slowing and eventual end of Ottoman territorial expansion put this era of easy land to an end. Around the same time, warfare and the Ottoman army faced drastic changes, with the sipahi cavalrymen, and their tax levies replaced with salaried infantry equipped with firearms. In 1695, malikane mukata’a, or life-term tax farms, were introduced, granting buyers the right to revenues on the parcel until the death of the holder, and freeing them from local oversight in exchange for incentivizing long-term growth.Salzmann, Ariel . \\"An Ancien Regime Revisited: \\"Privatization\\" and Political Economy in the Eighteenth-Century Ottoman Empire .\\" Politics and Society 21, no. 4 (December 1993): 393-423. As the shift to mukata’a began to gain traction, a new class in Ottoman society began to emerge. With the privatization of annual revenue collection, wealthy officials, or those with the access to information that could make them wealthy in the new investing market for mukata’a, had the ability to turn corners of the Empire into their own private fiefdoms, exerting control through a network of agents. However, Ariel Salzmann identifies this phenomenon not as a loss of control for the center, but instead “rationalized state control in a politically effective form.” Malikane mukata’a contracts, thus, became a way to extend the definition of the center, allowing the wealthy across the empire to become part of the center, and “curb the power of local officials who often usurped the state’s prerogatives over taxation”. With the inclusion of elite from every corner of the empire, financed by Jewish, Greek and Armenian bankers, a new Ottoman ruling class emerged, with an openness to any with the wealth or savvy to buy into the system.Lewis, Bernard. “Ottoman Land Tenure and Taxation in Syria.” Studia Islamic. (1979), pp. 109–124 References Category:Government of the Ottoman Empire ","title":"Muqata'ah"},{"id":"3921541","text":"The OpenAjax Alliance is an industry group devoted to the set of technologies and Web programming techniques known as Ajax. OpenAjax Alliance membership consists of vendors, open source projects, and companies using Ajax who work with Ajax-based Web technologies. The organization was formed by Ajax companies and open source projects to address issues that require coordination among the many organizations that create and/or use Ajax products and technologies. The alliance does not collect dues nor maintain a staff, and thus all of its activities are the result of voluntary contributions from its 100+ member organizations. The organization's target customer is the Web developer or IT professional who wants to use Ajax technologies to deliver Web applications with rich user interfaces. The alliance's technical focus is interoperability across Ajax products and technologies. Interoperability enables customers to integrate Ajax technologies from different Ajax technology providers. OpenAjax Alliance engages in educational and communications activities, such as Web pages and white papers posted on its Web site, a wiki, email lists, and press releases. History and Termination of Formal Operations  In late 2005, with leadership from IBM, companies brainstormed about how to ensure that Ajax fulfills its potential as the industry standard application platform based on open technologies. These early discussions came to a climax on Feb. 1, 2006, with the announcement of the \\"OpenAjax Initiative\\", whose 15 original companies included BEA, Borland, the Dojo Foundation, Eclipse Foundation, Google, IBM, Laszlo Systems, Mozilla Corporation, Novell, Openwave Systems, Oracle, Red Hat, Yahoo, Zend and Zimbra.http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/19187.wss Between February 1 and May 15, 2006, an additional 15 organizations joined \\"OpenAjax\\", and the (then) 30 companies held a two-day kickoff meeting in San Francisco to lay out the blue-print. At the meeting, the group decided to establish the OpenAjax Alliance, defined its mission, agreed on an interim organizational process, and established its activities.http://www.infoworld.com/article/06/05/22/78577_HNajaxforge_1.html The participating companies then defined a governance model via a Members Agreement, and began execution on its marketing/educational and technical activities. The Web site and white paper went live in September 2006.http://www.marketwire.com/mw/release_html_b1?release_id=164720 The alliance elected its first Steering Committee in October 2006.http://www.openajax.org/blog/?p=6 The first technical product from the alliance was the OpenAjax Hub, with a draft specification and reference open source implementation completed by December 2006 and integrated a dozen Ajax toolkits on a trial basis as part of the alliance's first OpenAjax InteropFest.http://www.openajax.org/member/wiki/InteropFest_2007_March As of May 2008, the organization has 100+ member organizations, including companies such as IBM, Microsoft, Google, Adobe, and Sun, along with Ajax suppliers such as Dojo Foundation, Laszlo Systems, Nexaweb, Tibco and Zimbra, and a small number of individual members. In October 2012, the Open Ajax Alliance formally terminated its operations.http://openajax.org/pipermail/steeringcommittee/2012q4/001023.html Members The list of members of OpenAjax Alliance has been growing steadily. For the list of members, refer to the OpenAjax Alliance home page or the members wiki page. Among the members are organizations that fall into some of the following categories: * Ajax toolkit developers (open source and commercial) * Web browsers (desktop and mobile) * Enterprise products companies * Organizations that use Ajax to deliver solutions to their users * Other community-oriented organizations, such as open source projects or standards organizations, that have a strong interest in Ajax  How OpenAjax Alliance is organized  = Steering Committee = The members of the OpenAjax Alliance elect representatives from seven companies to positions on the OpenAjax Alliance Steering Committee. The Steering Committee manages the affairs of the OpenAjax Alliance on behalf of its member organizations. Among other things, the Steering Committee has final approval on the creation of working groups and specifications. = Working Groups = The formal materials produced by OpenAjax Alliance are developed within Working Groups. The following two working groups have been formally chartered in accordance with process documents that the members have adopted. * The Interoperability Working Group is responsible for technical activities in the area of Ajax interoperability, with a focus on client-side runtime issues. The key products coming out of this group will include the specifications that provide the detailed definition of OpenAjax Conformance, such as the specification for the OpenAjax Hub (versions 1.0 and 1.1) and management of the OpenAjax Registry. * The Marketing Working Group is responsible for the OpenAjax Alliance's communications, educational and promotional activities, promote adoption of open and interoperable Ajax-based Web technologies. The group produces the alliance's white papers, oversees the development of its website, and drives the strategy, high-level definition and industry rollout of the term OpenAjax Conformance. * The IDE Working Group develops metadata standards that are planned to enable arbitrary Ajax runtime libraries to integrate into arbitrary Ajax developer tools (i.e., IDEs - integrated development environments). The IDE Working Group's metadata standard, OpenAjax Metadata Specification, is also intended to provide an industry standard for mashup widgets. The metadata standard attempts to be an \\"intermediary\\" standard which is designed to align closely with popular proprietary formats so that it is possible to transcode to and from the OpenAjax format, and therefore it is not necessary that everyone in the industry support the metadata formats. = Task Forces = The OpenAjax Alliance establishes task forces to investigate areas of new activity. The task forces are informal groups of members who perform research and then produce recommendations for future alliance activities. There are four task forces: * The Security Task Force identifies Ajax security issues and investigating what activities should be pursued by the alliance, * The Mobile Ajax Task Force investigates what OpenAjax Alliance can do to accelerate adoption and developer success in delivering Ajax applications to mobile devices * The Gadgets Task Force collaborates with the IDE Working Group to ensure that OpenAjax Metadata Specification addresses the needs of the mashup community for an industry standard for mashup widgets. * The Runtime Advocacy Task Force creates via an open wiki that plans to produce a prioritized feature request list from the Ajax community for what is most important to the Ajax industry from future Web browsers.  Specifications and open source  Although the OpenAjax Alliance does not intend to become a formal standards body, the alliance does engage in standards-related activities when such activities appear necessary in order to achieve objectives for greater interoperability, vendor choice and promoting innovation. As a result, the OpenAjax Alliance will sometimes develop its own formal specifications and/or open source to fill what it sees as critical industry gaps. In these cases, the expected outcome in the long term is to turn over such work at an appropriate point to a formal standards organization or open-source project. Members of the OpenAjax Alliance may participate in standards activities within other standards bodies and open source projects to help accelerate the coordinated advancement of OpenAjax technologies and products.  OpenAjax Conformance  A cornerstone of OpenAjax Alliance activities is the definition of OpenAjax Conformance. OpenAjax Conformance is shorthand for the set of conformance requirements that the OpenAjax Alliance places on Ajax technologies, products and applications. By using Ajax products that support OpenAjax Conformance, OpenAjax claims that IT managers and Web developers would notice the following benefits: * Seamless integration of multiple Ajax products and technologies within the same Web application, particularly with applications that use mashup techniques * Greater certainty about product choices, where OpenAjax Conformance plays a similar role in the Ajax community as the Good Housekeeping Seal does with consumer products * Lower training costs, lower development costs, and faster delivery of Web 2.0 innovations due to industry adoption of common approaches that build from OpenAjax standards * Interchangeability of OpenAjax Conformant products, such that customers can choose among multiple vendors To be OpenAjax Conformant, an Ajax product must: * Support the OpenAjax Hub * Register its library and JavaScript global objects with the OpenAjax Registry * Support all relevant Conformance Requirements defined within the OpenAjax Alliance's collection of specifications  OpenAjax hub  The OpenAjax hub is a small set of JavaScript technologies that addresses critical Ajax runtime interoperability requirements. Version 1.0 of the OpenAjax Hub has the following features: * Ajax library loading * A publish/subscribe-based event hub (topic bus) OpenAjax Hub 2.0 is planned to extend the publish/subscribe features to support secure mashup workflows and client-server communications. For mashups, Hub 2.0 supports the isolation of mashup widgets into secure sandboxes and provides a mediated message bus. The Alliance develops the OpenAjax Hub Specification and provides an open-source reference implementation. OpenAjax Registry The vision for the OpenAjax Registry is that, if finished, it will provide a centralized, industry-wide global object registration authority that would help to prevent JavaScript object collision within complex Ajax applications. The OpenAjax Registry is still under development.  Marketing and communication  The OpenAjax Alliance engages in various promotional, educational and communication activities. Its Web site provides a standard vocabulary for industry terms such as \\"Ajax\\" and \\"OpenAjax\\" and includes whitepapers and block diagrams on Ajax technologies and associated best practices, with a focus on cross-vendor interoperability. Representatives speak about OpenAjax at conferences and other industry events. The OpenAjax Alliance Web site provides a central point of information about the OpenAjax vision, explaining how to adopt Ajax successfully so that IT developers will feel safe about their technology and vendor choices.

He was police chief there from 1982 until his retirement in 2005. Childhood Born on June 24, 1943 in Houston, Texas, Greenberg was the son of a Russian Jewish immigrant father and an African- American mother. Of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry on his father's side, he converted to his father's religion of Judaism at the age of 26. Education Greenberg received his bachelor's degree in anthropology from San Francisco State University in 1967, and earned master's degrees in public administration and city planning from University of California, Berkeley in 1969 and 1975. He was also a graduate of the FBI Academy. Teaching career He taught sociology as an assistant professor at California State University, political science at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and criminal justice at Florida International University. Law enforcement career He served as the Undersheriff of the Chatham County Sheriff's Department in Savannah, Georgia, and he was a major with the city's police department. In Florida, he was Chief of Police at Opa-locka and Chief Deputy Sheriff of Orange County, rising to Deputy Director of the Florida Department of Law Enforcement. He arrived in Charleston as Chief of Police in 1982. In the words of Charleston's The Post and Courier reporter David Slade, he \\"turned the... Police Department into a national model. In the process, he became a celebrity and a source of pride for the city ....\\" Greenberg told his cops that their job was not to punish (that was up to the courts), but to make arrests, and in order to do that they had to be on good terms with the citizens. So he put his cops out on the streets, not in cars. They walked, rode bicycles and horses, and were accessible to \\"normal people,\\" who might not want to call or visit headquarters. He also required that every cop earn a bachelor's degree, whereas when he arrived at the department not all had even graduated from high school. He added a K-9 bomb and drug-sniffing unit, a harbor patrol, and a crime lab to the police department. He had a team of officers remove graffiti the moment it appeared, sending a message that the city belonged to the police, not the vandals. It worked, and Greenberg became a media celebrity. The Los Angeles Times headlined its profile, \\"Black Police Chief Skates Past Skeptics.\\" Charleston's population increased 64% during the time Greenberg was chief, while crime decreased 11 percent. Greenberg retired in 2005 after over 23 years of service. This followed a controversial 2005 incident in which a motorist charged that he hit her car door after she told him that she had called the police department to report his erratic driving. Health reasons, such as high blood pressure, were cited as the cause for his behavior for several years, which included poking a news reporter in the chest while on video in 2003 (he later apologized, saying \\"I'm not proud ... It was not my finest hour\\"), calling an anti-war demonstrator a \\"crazy fat lady\\" in 2003 (he later said, \\"I was wrong. She's not fat. She's obese. She's grossly obese. If she doesn't like that, she can do something about it, like the Atkins diet that I was on.\\"), and being involved in five traffic accidents while in his police vehicle over a 6-year period. During one of these accidents, in 2005, he hit a car while turning the wrong way down a one-way street. Death Greenberg died on September 24, 2014, in Charleston, South Carolina after a long illness. Awards Greenberg was named Justice Professional of the Year in 1991 by the Southern Criminal Justice Foundation, received the Foundation for Improvement of Justice 1989 Achievement Award and the Free Spirit Award from the Freedom Forum in 1994 for distinguished success in fighting crime. Author Greenberg was the author of Let's Take Back Our Streets, 1989, written with Arthur Gordon, a consulting editor of Guideposts. In the book he told about moves he made to take back the streets in his adopted city from criminals, and what he thought other law officers could do to accomplish that. He also authored a number of police-related articles, and has appeared as a guest columnist for several newspapers, most notably the Detroit News He was the subject of an article in Readers Digest. TV Greenberg explained his tactics and strategies on television programs such as 60 Minutes, Larry King Live, The Phil Donahue Show, The Today Show, Both Sides with Jesse Jackson, and The MacNeil/Lehrer Newshour. Film Greenberg appeared in Shalom Y'all, a 2002 documentary about Jews in the American South which also featured author and singer Kinky Friedman.

Letters of the Great Kings of the Ancient Near East..  Later Battles  After his invasion of Assyria, Shaushtatar turned his army westward across the Euphrates, along the way gathering beneath his sway all the northern Syrian states as he brought his army to the Mediterranean coast. He succeeded in extending the boundaries of Mitanni to include the areas of Alalakh, Nuzi, Assur, and Kizzuwatna. He was looking to extend Mitanni's power further south, perhaps into Palestine. However, much of southern Syria still lay within the Egyptian sphere of influence, which had long been a threat to Mitanni. There was a consequence into Shaushtatar's expansion into Palestine: war with Egypt. Despite Mitanni's advantage that Palestine had a significant Hurrian population at the time, the war would be difficult to win.

From 1857 until 1921 the suburb was its own town with its own council, the East Ballarat Town Council. The suburb covers a large area east of the City of Ballarat. It is the oldest area in Ballarat and was the site of many goldmines, as well as the Eureka Rebellion. The population of Ballarat East at the was 5,628. Although amalgamation between Ballarat and Ballarat East occurred nearly a century ago the former town retains much of its shambolic character, particularly its windy, unplanned roads which arose organically amongst the many gold mines.Bate, W. Life after gold: twentieth century Ballarat. Carlton, Melbourne University Press, 1993. Much of the suburb is subject to heritage overlays because of its local significance, with many dwellings dating between the 1860s and 1940s. History The old Ballarat East public library, located across the road from its original location, level two of Ballarat East Fire Station. In the 1840s, the Yuille cousins, who were the first colonists to own the region of Ballarat, operated their farm from the rich alluvial plain at the base of Black Hill and South of the Yarrowee River. According to historian Weston Bate, the soil was often considered the best in Victoria.Bate, Weston. Lucky City: The First Generation at Ballarat 1851-1901 (1978) This area later became known as Black Hill Flats. The discovery of gold in 1851 led to heavy immigration. Although mining started at Golden Point, within a year the focus shifted to Black Hill Flats.http://bih.federation.edu.au/index.php/Black_Hill_Flat In 1854, in their resistance of an arbitrary tax, gold miners in the area came into armed conflict with the authorities in what became known as the Eureka Rebellion. Main Street developed into the principal commercial area of the Ballarat district. In the 1850s and 1860s the shops were mostly tents and timber buildings. The latter were largely destroyed by a series of fires during the 1860s, resulting in the commercial area shifting to Ballarat West, specifically Sturt and Lydiard Streets. Humffray Street North, then known as Black Hill Road, was prone to flooding in the 1860s due to the extensive mining operations at Black Hill and Black Hill Flats, which had levelled the terrain South of the Yarrowee River.http://bih.federation.edu.au/index.php/Black_Hill_Flat The Ballarat East goldfields, which consisted of three distinct areas known as Ballarat East, Ballarat West and Nerrina, produced over 1.9 million ounces of gold from vein systems and over 16 million ounces from adjacent alluvial deposits. At the turn of the 20th century, these alluvial goldfields were the richest ever opened. As these surface deposits were exhausted the quartz reefs at deep levels were exploited and several mines worked at depths exceeding 600 metres. =Ballarat East municipality and township (1857-1921)= Ballarat East Town Hall in 1862 (demolished in the 1960s). Ballarat East was one of the first areas of Ballarat to gain municipal status when it began in 1857. This occurred after a commission was appointed to investigate the grievances of the rebellious miners in 1855. In 1859 the newly formed Ballarat East Town Council acquisitioned land in what was to become the Barkly Street civic area and on 26 December 1861 the foundation stone was laid for the Ballarat East Town Hall which was built in a Renaissance Revival architecture style and set in formal gardens. It was completed the following year along with the Ballarat East Free Library next doorhttp://vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au/places/heritage/59 and the Ballarat East Fire Station, a new headquarters for the fire brigade formed in 1856) was erected a few years later in 1864.http://vhd.heritage.vic.gov.au/places/heritage/1441 The East Ballarat Town Council was amalgamated with Ballarat West Town Council in 1921 to become the City of Ballarat, which exists today. Ballarat East became a suburb of the expanded city. =Heritage infrastructure= The windows of the old Eastern Station Hotel, which still sport its old name. The building is now a bar and backpackers hostel. Remnants of the old town still remain, despite much destruction. In 1927 the Ballarat Teachers College moved to the old town hall, however during the great depression the building was mostly unused and was finally demolished in 1946. This was despite years of speculation of its use, finally being used as a girls' school. The gates to the hall's gardens still stand at 41 Barkly Street. Old Ballarat East Post Office, which opened on 1 December 1857, was replaced by the Bakery Hill office in 1992. The old post office building is situated at 21 Main Road. Old Ballarat East railway station was built in the 1860s shortly after Ballarat West's station, which still dominates the landscape. The old eastern station became an important junction for branch lines before it closed in the 1960s. Subsequently the station and its platforms were demolished, however the old goods shed still stands across from the train crossing on Humffray Street North. The crossing itself has been upgraded, but the original gates and tower were not removed. The old Eastern Station Hotel still stands at 81 Humffray Street North. Local identity and heritage protection Ballarat East Fire Station, the oldest continually operating fire station in the Southern Hemisphere. It is the site of the first operational telephone, made by Henry Sutton. Residents of old Ballarat East were known for their determined, working class spirit arising from its traditional poverty. In large part the poverty of the area discouraged the kinds of development experienced in other suburbs of Ballarat, especially in the 1970s and 1980s. As a result, much of the residential and business architecture of Ballarat East still exists from the 1860s through to early 1940s, with tree lined streets and grassy verges (nature strips), as well as bluestone canals.Mapping Ballarat's Historic Urban Landscape, report, 2013. There are numerous heritage overlays placed on much of the East, including the Humffray Street Heritage Precinct near Black Hill where 66% of dwellings are declared to be of local heritage significance or contributory significance.http://eheritage.metadata.net/record/VIC-118183 Ballarat Heritage Precinct Statements of Significance 2006 (revised August 2014), City of Ballarat. According to the council's heritage survey, \\"[t]he particular mining character of this area is important to Ballarat as it retains the atmosphere of an early mining settlement more strongly than elsewhere\\". Ballarat station as viewed from Ebden Street in Ballarat East. According to historian Weston Bate in his 1978 work the Lucky City: the first generation of Ballarat: While mining has not been undertaken in the East for some time, the extensive mining that occurred in the 1800s still impacts residents. For example, poorly conceived mine shafts that were not registered at the time have been known to reopen leaving holes in the ground. This is particularly true of properties around Black Hill as well as on the Hill itself, where walkers should not stray from established paths.Ballarat Heritage Precinct Statements of Significance 2006 (revised August 2014), City of Ballarat.http://www.thecourier.com.au/story/63936/black-hill-mine-shaft- secured-after-rescue/ Mullock piles, containing mine tailings, were once dispersed in order to flatten land for residential dwellings. This has led to elevated arsenic levels in the soil which necessitates residents in certain areas growing fruit and vegetables in elevated garden beds.http://ballarateast.net/meeting-2012/be-history/ Some lots on Morres Street North are still vacant because of the contamination.Ballarat Heritage Precinct Statements of Significance 2006 (revised August 2014), City of Ballarat. Facilities =Parks and commons= Ballarat East is home to many parks, commons, and reserves, as well as a golf course and historic oval. The parks include: Eastern Oval, once the only such park, Ballarat Wildlife Park, McKenzie Reserve, Len T. Fraser Reserve, Pennywright Park, Railway Reserve and Webb Avenue Park. =Sporting= At its furthest west point, East Ballarat is home to the historic Eastern Oval, with its Edwardian grandstands. The Oval hosts Australian rules football and cricket matches, and is the home of the Ballarat Cricket Association. The stadium is also home to the East Point Football Club of the Ballarat Football League and also the Golden Point Cricket Club and has also been mooted as a potential Australian Football League venue. The recreational facility also includes netball courts, as well as the lawn bowls club, Ballarat East Bowling Club, and other club facilities. Golfers play at the course of the Mount Xavier Golf Club on Fortune Street. =Ballarat Community Garden= Created in 2004, the community garden is located on the corner of Queen Street and Dyte Parade - near the old site of the old railway station - and is managed by the Ballarat City Council.http://ballaratcommunitygarden.org.au/about-bcg/ Members have access to their own 3x3 metre bed, as well as sheds, toilets and chook yard. An annual Harvest Festival in autumn is held where locals can buy plants and produce.http://www.thecourier.com.au/story/2939555/ballarat-community-garden- to-hold-annual-harvest-festival/ =Transport= The main form of transport is the automobile, as well as V/Line train for commuters to Melbourne. The suburb has several key collector roads. The largest road is Victoria Street (named for Queen Victoria), a dual carriageway which forms the main eastern entrance to Ballarat. In the north is Humffray Street (named for local politician John Basson Humffray), which forms a major east-west route. In the west is Main Road and Barkly Street (named for the Victorian Governor, Sir Henry Barkly). Along the south is another major east-west route, Eureka Street. Buses provide the only means of public transport and several services are available. Route 8 (Eureka) and 9 (Canadian) travel along Eureka Street, while Route 7 (Brown Hill) service runs along Humffray and Victoria Streets. Route 10 (Buninyong) services part of the western edge along Main Road. Although the Ballarat- Melbourne railway runs the length of the suburb, the local railway station, once an important interchange, located near the Humffray Street level crossing, was closed in the 1960s and has been largely demolished. Ballarat railway station is located near the eastern boundary of Ballarat East and provides regular services to Ararat (The Overland to Adelaide), Maryborough, and Melbourne Southern Cross.

History The location of the European factories along the Hooghly in 1749. is opposing French Goretty and Danish Serampor. Palace of the governor of Banquibazar in the 1720s Bankipur was famous as the principal settlement of the Ostend Company, the one great effort made by the Austrian Empire to secure a foothold in India. The Ostend Company was formed in 1722–1723, and with a capital of less than a million sterling founded two settlements, one at Coblom (Covelong) on the Madras coast between the English Madras and the Dutch Sadras, and the other on the Hugli between the English Calcutta and the Dutch Chinsura. Both English and Dutch were offended and in 1727, in order to obtain the European guarantee for the Pragmatic Sanction, the court of Vienna resolved to sacrifice the Company and suspended its charter. It became bankrupt in 1784 and ceased to exist in 1793. But in the meantime in 1733 the English and Dutch stirred up the Muslim general at Hugli to pick a quarrel. He attacked Bankipur and the garrison of only fourteen persons set sail for Europe. Thus imperial Austrian interests disappeared from India.

Its denizens spoke a variety of the Brittonic language known as Cumbric. The Hen Ogledd was distinct from the parts of northern Britain inhabited by the Picts, Anglo-Saxons, and Scoti as well as from Wales, although the people of the Hen Ogledd were the same Brittonic stock as the Picts, Welsh and Cornish, and the region loomed large in Welsh literature and tradition for centuries after its kingdoms had disappeared. The major kingdoms of the Hen Ogledd were Elmet in western Yorkshire; Gododdin in Lothian and the Scottish Borders; Rheged, centred in Galloway; and Kingdom of Strathclyde, situated around the Firth of Clyde. Smaller kingdoms or districts included Aeron, Calchfynydd, Eidyn, Lleuddiniawn, and Manaw Gododdin; the last three were evidently parts of Gododdin. The Angle kingdoms of Deira and Bernicia both had Brittonic-derived names, suggesting they may have been Brittonic kingdoms in origin. All the kingdoms of the Old North except Strathclyde were conquered by Anglo-Saxons and Picts by about 800; Strathclyde was incorporated into the rising Middle Irish-speaking Kingdom of Scotland in the 11th century. The legacy of the Hen Ogledd remained strong in Wales. Welsh tradition included genealogies of the Gwŷr y Gogledd, or Men of the North, and several important Welsh dynasties traced their lineage to them. A number of important early Welsh texts were attributed to the Men of the North, such as Taliesin, Aneirin, Myrddin Wyllt, and the Cynfeirdd poets. Heroes of the north such as Urien, Owain mab Urien, and Coel Hen and his descendants feature in Welsh poetry and the Welsh Triads. Background Almost nothing is reliably known of Central Britain before c. 550\\\\. There had never been a period of long-term, effective Roman control north of the Tyne–Solway line, and south of that line effective Roman control ended long before the traditionally given date of departure of the Roman military from Roman Britain in 407. It was noted in the writings of Ammianus Marcellinus and others that there was ever-decreasing Roman control from about AD 100 onward, and in the years after 360 there was widespread disorder and the large-scale permanent abandonment of territory by the Romans. By 550, the region was controlled by native Brittonic-speaking peoples except for the eastern coastal areas, which were controlled by the Anglian peoples of Bernicia and Deira. To the north were the Picts (now also accepted as Brittonic speakers prior to Gaelicisation) with the Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata to the northwest. All of these peoples would play a role in the history of the Old North. =Historical context= From a historical perspective, wars were frequently internecine, and Britons were aggressors as well as defenders, as was also true of the Angles, Picts, and Gaels. However, those Welsh stories of the Old North that tell of Briton fighting Anglian have a counterpart, told from the opposite side. The story of the demise of the kingdoms of the Old North is the story of the rise of the Kingdom of Northumbria from two coastal kingdoms to become the premier power in Britain north of the Humber and south of the Firth of Clyde and the Firth of Forth. 220px 220px The interests of kingdoms of this era were not restricted to their immediate vicinity. Alliances were not made only within the same ethnic groups, nor were enmities restricted to nearby different ethnic groups. An alliance of Britons fought against another alliance of Britons at the Battle of Arfderydd. Áedán mac Gabráin of Dál Riata appears in the Bonedd Gwŷr y Gogledd, a genealogy among the pedigrees of the Men of the North.Bromwich 2006, pp. 256–257 The Historia Brittonum states that Oswiu, king of Northumbria, married a Briton who may have had some Pictish ancestry. A marriage between the Northumbrian and Pictish royal families would produce the Pictish king Talorgan I. Áedán mac Gabráin fought as an ally of the Britons against the Northumbrians. Cadwallon ap Cadfan of the Kingdom of Gwynedd allied with Penda of Mercia to defeat Edwin of Northumbria. Conquest and defeat did not necessarily mean the extirpation of one culture and its replacement by another. The Brittonic region of northwestern England was absorbed by Anglian Northumbria in the 7th century, yet it would re-emerge 300 years later as South Cumbria, joined with North Cumbria (Strathclyde) into a single state. =Societal context= The organisation of the Men of the North was tribal, based on kinship groups of extended families, owing allegiance to a dominant \\"royal\\" family, sometimes indirectly through client relationships, and receiving protection in return. For Celtic peoples, this organisation was still in effect hundreds of years later, as shown in the Irish Brehon law, the Welsh Laws of Hywel Dda, and the Scottish Laws of the Brets and Scots. The Germanic Anglo-Saxon law had culturally different origins, but with many similarities to Celtic law. Like Celtic law, it was based on cultural tradition, without any perceivable debt to the Roman occupation of Britain.\\"Anglo-Saxon law\\" is a modern neologism for the Saxon Law of Wessex, the Anglian Law of Mercia, and the Danelaw, all of which were sufficiently similar to merit inclusion within this umbrella term. The laws of Anglian Northumbria were supplanted by the Danelaw, but were certainly similar to these. The origins of English law have been much studied. For example, the 12th century Tractatus de legibus et consuetudinibus regni Angliae (Treatise on the laws and customs of the Kingdom of England) is the book of authority on English common law, and scholars have held that it owes a debt to Norman law and to Germanic law, and not to Roman law. A primary royal court () would be maintained as a \\"capital\\", but it was not the bureaucratic administrative centre of modern society, nor the settlement or civitas of Roman rule. As the ruler and protector of his kingdom, the king would maintain multiple courts throughout his territory, travelling among them to exercise his authority and to address the needs of his clients, such as in the dispensing of justice. This ancient method of dispensing justice survived throughout England as a part of royal procedure until the reforms of Henry II (reigned 1154–1189) modernised the administration of law. Language Modern scholarship uses the term \\"Cumbric\\" for the Brittonic language spoken in the Hen Ogledd. It appears to have been very closely related to Old Welsh, with some local variances, and more distantly related to Cornish, Breton and the pre-Gaelic form of Pictish. There are no surviving texts written in the dialect; evidence for it comes from placenames, proper names in a few early inscriptions and later non-Cumbric sources, two terms in the Leges inter Brettos et Scottos, and the corpus of poetry by the cynfeirdd, the \\"early poets\\", nearly all of which deals with the north.Koch 2006, p. 516. The cynfeirdd poetry is the largest source of information, and it is generally accepted that some part of the corpus was first composed in the Old North. However, it survives entirely in later manuscripts created in Wales, and it is unknown how faithful they are to the originals. Still, the texts do contain discernible variances that distinguish the speech from contemporary Welsh. In particular, these texts contain a number of archaisms – features that appear to have once been common in all Brittonic varieties, but which later vanished from Welsh and the Southwestern Brittonic languages. In general, however, the differences appear to be slight, and the distinction between Cumbric and Old Welsh is largely geographical rather than linguistic.Koch 2006, p. 517. Cumbric gradually disappeared as the area was conquered by the Anglo-Saxons, and later the Scots and Norse, though it survived in the Kingdom of Strathclyde, centred at Alt Clut in what is now Dumbarton in Scotland. Kenneth H. Jackson suggested that it re-emerged in Cumbria in the 10th century, as Strathclyde established hegemony over that area. It is unknown when Cumbric finally became extinct, but the series of counting systems of Celtic origin recorded in Northern England since the 18th century have been proposed as evidence of a survival of elements of Cumbric; though the view has been largely rejected on linguistic grounds, with evidence pointing to the fact that it was imported to England after the Old English era.A Dictionary of English Folklore, Jacqueline Simpson, Stephen Roud, Oxford University Press, 2000, , 9780192100191, Shepeherd's score, pp. 271Margaret L. Faull, Local Historian 15:1 (1982), 21–3 Welsh interest One of the traditional stories relating to the creation of Wales is derived from the arrival in Wales of Cunedda and his sons as \\"Men of the North\\". Cunedda himself is held to be the progenitor of the royal dynasty of the Kingdom of Gwynedd, one of the largest and most powerful of the medieval Welsh kingdoms, and an ongoing participant in the history of the Old North. Cunedda, incidentally, is represented as a descendant of one of Maximus' generals, Paternus, who Maximus appointed as commander at Alt Clut. However, the relationship between Wales and the Old North is more substantial than this one event, amounting to a self-perception that the Welsh and the Men of the North are one people. The modern Welsh term for themselves, Cymry, derives from this ancient relationship. It is not originally an ethnic or cultural term, and in the modern sense refers only to the Welsh of Wales and the Brittonic-speaking Men of the North. However, it is the reflex of old kombrogoi, which meant simply \\"fellow-countrymen, Celts\\", and it is worth noting in passing that its Breton counterpart kenvroiz still has this original meaning \\"compatriots\\". The word began to be used as an endonym by the northern Britons during the early 7th century (and possibly earlier), and was used throughout the Middle Ages to describe both the Kingdom of Strathclyde (the successor state to Ystrad Clud, known as North Cumbria, which flourished c. 900–1100) and western England north of the Ribble Estuary (South Cumbria). Before this, and for some centuries after, the traditional as well as the more literary term was Brythoniaid, recaIling the still older time when all Celts in the island remained a unity. Cymry survives today in the native name for Wales (Cymru, land of the Cymry), and in the English county name Cumbria, both meaning \\"homeland\\", \\"mother country\\". Many of the traditional sources of information about the Old North are believed to have come to Wales from the Old North, and bards such as Aneirin (the reputed author of Y Gododdin) are thought to have been court poets in the Old North. These stories and bards are held to be no less Welsh than the stories and bards who were actually from Wales. Nature of the sources A listing of passages from the literary and historical sources, particularly relevant to the Old North, can be found in Sir Edward Anwyl's article Wales and the Britons of the North. A somewhat dated introduction to the study of old Welsh poetry can be found in his 1904 article Prolegomena to the Study of Old Welsh Poetry. =Literary sources= * The bardic poetry attributed to Taliesin, Aneirin, and Llywarch Hen. * The genealogical tracts of the Harleian genealogies, the Bonedd Gwŷr y Gogledd, and the genealogies of Jesus College MS 20. * The Triads of the Island of Britain (note that most of the triads published in the notorious third volume of The Myvyrian Archaiology of Wales are known to be the forgeries of Iolo Morganwg, and are not considered valid sources of historical information)., Notes on the Historical Triads, in The History of Wales The standard scholarly edition is Trioedd Ynys Prydein by Rachel Bromwich.Rachel Bromwich (ed.), Trioedd Ynys Prydein (University of Wales Press, revised edition 1991) . * The other elegies () and songs of praise (), as well as certain mythological stories, that have been preserved. Stories praising a patron and the construction of flattering genealogies are neither unbiased nor reliable sources of historically accurate information. However, while they may exaggerate and make apocryphal assertions, they do not falsify or change the historical facts that were known to the bards' listeners, as that would bring ridicule and disrepute to both the bards and their patrons. In addition, the existence of stories of defeat and tragedy, as well as stories of victory, lends additional credibility to their value as sources of history. Within that context, the stories contain useful information, much of it incidental, about an era of British history where very little is reliably known. =Historical sources= * The Historia Brittonum attributed to Nennius * The Annales Cambriae * The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle * The Ecclesiastical History of the English People by Bede * The Annals of Tigernach These sources are not without deficiencies. Both the authors and their later transcribers sometimes displayed a partisanship that promoted their own interests, portraying their own agendas in a positive light, always on the side of justice and moral rectitude. Facts in opposition to those agendas are sometimes omitted, and apocryphal entries are sometimes added. While Bede was a Northumbrian partisan and spoke with prejudice against the native Britons, his Ecclesiastical History of the English People is highly regarded for its effort towards an accurate telling of history, and for its use of reliable sources. When passing along \\"traditional\\" information that lacks a historical foundation, Bede takes care to note it as such.For a recent view of Bede's treatment of Britons in his work, see W. Trent Foley and N.J. Higham, \\"Bede on the Britons.\\" Early Medieval Europe 17.2 (2009): pp. 154–85. The De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae by Gildas (c. 516–570) is occasionally relevant in that it mentions early people and places also mentioned in the literary and historical sources. The work was intended to preach Christianity to Gildas' contemporaries and was not meant to be a history. It is one of the few contemporary accounts of his era to have survived. = Place names = Cumbric place names in Scotland south of the Forth and Clyde, and in Cumberland and neighbouring counties, indicate areas of Hen Ogledd inhabited by Britons in the early Middle Ages. Isolated locations of later British presence are also indicated by place names of Old English and Old Norse origin. In Yorkshire, the names of Walden, Walton and Walburn, from Old English walas \\"Britons or Welshmen\\", indicate Britons encountered by the Anglo-Saxons, and the name of Birkby, from Old Norse Breta \\"Britons\\", indicates a place where the Vikings met Britons. =Dubious and fraudulent sources= The Historia Regum Britanniae of Geoffrey of Monmouth is disparaged as pseudohistory, though it looms large as a source for the largely fictional chivalric romance stories known collectively as the Matter of Britain. The lack of historical value attributed to the Historia lies only partly in the fact that it contains so many fictions and falsifications of history; the fact that historical accuracy clearly was not a consideration in its creation makes any references to actual people and places no more than a literary convenience. The Iolo Manuscripts are a collection of manuscripts presented in the early 19th century by Edward Williams, who is better known as Iolo Morganwg. Containing various tales, anecdotal material and elaborate genealogies that connect virtually everyone of note with everyone else of note (and with many connections to Arthur and Iolo's native region of Morgannwg), they were at first accepted as genuine, but have since been shown to be an assortment of forged or doctored manuscripts, transcriptions, and fantasies, mainly invented by Iolo himself. A list of works tainted by their reliance on the material presented by Iolo (sometimes without attribution) would be quite long. Kingdoms and regions =Major kingdoms= Places in the Old North that are mentioned as kingdoms in the literary and historical sources include: * Alt Clut or Ystrad Clud – a kingdom centred at what is now Dumbarton in Scotland. Later known as the Kingdom of Strathclyde, it was one of the best attested of the northern British kingdoms. It was also the last surviving, as it operated as an independent realm into the 11th century before it was finally absorbed by the Kingdom of Scotland.Koch 2006, p. 1819. * Elmet – centred in western Yorkshire in northern England. It was located south of the other northern British kingdoms, and well east of present-day Wales, but managed to survive into the early 7th century.Koch 2006, pp. 670–671. * Gododdin – a kingdom in what is now southeastern Scotland and northeastern England, the area previously noted as the territory of the Votadini. They are the subjects of the poem Y Gododdin, which memorialises a disastrous raid by an army raised by the Gododdin on the Angles of Bernicia.Koch 2006, pp. 823–826. * Rheged – a major kingdom that evidently included parts of present-day Cumbria, though its full extent is unknown. It may have covered a vast area at one point, as it is very closely associated with its king Urien, whose name is tied to places all over northwestern Britain.Koch 2006, pp. 1498–1499. =Minor kingdoms and other regions= Several regions are mentioned in the sources, assumed to be notable regions within one of the kingdoms if not separate kingdoms themselves: * Aeron – a minor kingdom mentioned in sources such as Y Gododdin, its location is uncertain, but several scholars have suggested that it was in the Ayrshire region of southwest Scotland.Koch 2006, pp. 354–355; 904.Bromwich 1978, pp. 12–13; 157.Morris-Jones, pp. 75–77.Williams 1968, p. xlvii. It is frequently associated with Urien Rheged, and may have been part of his realm.Koch 2006, p. 1499. * Calchfynydd (\\"Chalkmountain\\") – almost nothing is known about this area, though it was likely somewhere in the Hen Ogledd, as an evident ruler, Cadrawd Calchfynydd, is listed in the Bonedd Gwŷr y Gogledd. William Forbes Skene suggested an identification with Kelso (formerly Calchow) in the Scottish Borders.Bromwich 2006, p. 325. * Eidyn – this was the area around the modern city of Edinburgh, then known as Din Eidyn (Fort of Eidyn). It was closely associated with the Gododdin kingdom.Koch 2006, pp. 623–625. Kenneth H. Jackson argued strongly that Eidyn referred exclusively to Edinburgh,Jackson 1969, pp. 77–78 but other scholars have taken it as a designation for the wider area.Williams 1972, p. 64.Chadwick, p. 107. The name may survive today in toponyms such as Edinburgh, Dunedin, and Carriden (from Caer Eidyn), located fifteen miles to the west.Dumville, p. 297. Din Eidyn was besieged by the Angles in 638 and was under their control for most of the next three centuries. * Manaw Gododdin – the coastal area south of the Firth of Forth, and part of the territory of the Gododdin. The name survives in Slamannan Moor and the village of Slamannan, in Stirlingshire. This is derived from Sliabh Manann, the 'Moor of Manann'. It also appears in the name of Dalmeny, some 5 miles northwest of Edinburgh, and formerly known as Dumanyn, assumed to be derived from Dun Manann. The name also survives north of the Forth in Pictish Manaw as the name of the burgh of Clackmannan and the eponymous county of Clackmannanshire,, Celtic Britain, The Picts and the Scots. derived from Clach Manann, the 'stone of Manann', referring to a monument stone located there. * Novant – a kingdom mentioned in Y Gododdin, presumably related to the Iron Age Novantae tribe of southwestern Scotland.Koch 2006, pp. 824–825.Koch 1997, pp. lxxxii–lxxxiii. * Regio Dunutinga – a minor kingdom or region in North Yorkshire mentioned in the Life of Wilfrid. It was evidently named for a ruler named Dunaut, perhaps the Dunaut ap Pabo known from the genealogies.Koch 2006, p. 458. Its name may survive in the modern town of Dent, Cumbria.Koch 2006, p. 904. Kingdoms that were not part of the Old North but are part of its history include: * Dál Riata – Though this was a Gaelic kingdom, the family of Áedán mac Gabráin of Dál Riata appears in the Bonedd Gwŷr y Gogledd * Northumbria and its predecessor states, Bernicia and Deira * Pictish kingdom =Possible kingdoms= The following names appear in historical and literary sources, but it is unknown whether or not they refer to British kingdoms and regions of the Hen Ogledd. * Bryneich – this is the British name for the Anglo-Saxon kingdom of Bernicia. There was probably a pre-Saxon British kingdom in this area, but this is uncertain.Koch 2006, pp. 302–304. * Deifr or Dewr – this was the British name for Anglo-Saxon Deira, a region between the River Tees and the Humber. The name is of British origin, but as with Bryneich it is unknown if it represented an earlier British kingdom.Koch 2006, pp. 584–585.

The reservoir is formed by the impoundment of the waters of two forks of Coats Run, a small tributary of the North Fork of the Cherry River. There have been attempts to rename the lake in honor of Carl E. Gainer, a politician from nearby Richwood. These efforts, however, have had limited success with local residents and the United States Forest Service. In times of drought when the Cherry River becomes too shallow, the lake can be used to supply Richwood's municipal water system. Recreation The lake is popular among fisherman, as it has an abundant supply of panfish and bass within its waters. The West Virginia Division of Natural Resources also stocks the lake with trout several times per year. The area surrounding the lake includes a primitive 33-site campground and access to the Cranberry Backcountry. The Cranberry River, a popular trout stream, can be accessed via a somewhat-steep two-mile (3 km) hike along Fisherman's Trail. There are several other hiking trails of varying degrees of difficulty in proximity to Summit Lake, including one that circumnavigates the entire body of water. Some of these trails are used for cross-country skiing during winter months. Low-horsepower motor boats and row boats are permitted on the lake. Swimming is prohibited except during the annual Scenic Mountain Triathlon.

It is generally caused by phytoplasma or virus infections, though it may also be because of environmental factors that result in an imbalance in plant hormones. Phyllody causes the affected plant to become partially or entirely sterile, as it is unable to normally produce flowers. The condition is also known as phyllomorphy or frondescence; though the latter may sometimes refer more generically to foliage, leafiness, or the process of leaf growth. Phyllody is usually differentiated from floral virescence, wherein the flowers merely turn green in color but otherwise retain their normal structure. However, floral virescence and phyllody (along with witch's broom and other growth abnormalities), commonly occur together as symptoms of the same diseases. The term chloranthy is also often used for phyllody (particularly flowers exhibiting complete phyllody, such that it resembles leaf buds more than flowers), though in some cases it may refer to floral virescence. History In the late 18th century, the German poet and philosopher Johann Wolfgang von Goethe noted strange-looking rose flowers where the flower organs were replaced by leafy or stem-like structures. This led him to hypothesize that plant organs arising from the stem are simply modifications of the same basic leaf organ. During growth, these organs naturally differentiate into specialized or generalized structures like petals or leaves. However, if certain factors interfere during the early growth stages, these organs can develop into something other than the original \\"plan of construction\\". He called this abnormal growth \\"metamorphosis\\" and it is the main topic of his essay Versuch die Metamorphose der Pflanzen zu erklären (1790), better known in English as the Metamorphosis of Plants. Goethe's hypothesis was poorly received by other scientists during his time, but it is now known to be essentially correct. The concepts he discusses while describing metamorphosis is now known as homology, the basis of the modern science of comparative anatomy and a discovery that is usually credited to the English biologist Sir Richard Owen. In 1832, the German-American botanist George Engelmann described the same condition in his work De Antholysi Prodromus. He gave it the name \\"frondescence\\". Nineteen years later, the Belgian botanist Charles Jacques Édouard Morren also investigated the phenomenon in his book Lobelia (1851). Morren called the condition \\"phyllomorphy\\", and unlike Engelmann, Morren explicitly distinguished phyllomorphy (wherein the floral parts are replaced by leaf-like structures) from virescence (wherein the affected parts, not necessarily floral, turn green but retain the original form or structure). The term \\"phyllody\\" was coined by the English botanist Maxwell T. Masters in his book on plant abnormalities, Vegetable Teratology (1869). The term is derived from Scientific Latin phyllodium, which is itself derived from Ancient Greek φυλλώδης (phullodes, 'leaf-like'). Like Morren, Masters also distinguished phyllody from virescence. He acknowledged \\"frondescence\\" and \\"phyllomorphy\\" as synonyms of phyllody. Description Phyllody is characterized by the partial or complete replacement of floral organs with true leaves. Phyllody can affect bracts, the calyx (sepals), corolla (petals), the gynoecium (carpels/pistils), and the androecium (stamens). Phyllody may be partial, affecting only some sets of floral organs or even only half of a set of floral organs (e.g. only three petals out of six in a single flower); or it can be complete, with all the floral organs replaced by leaves. Vegetable Teratology (1869), showing a Petunia flower with stamens partially replaced by \\"stalked\\" leaves. The stalks are actually the retained filaments of the stamens, while the anthers have been replaced by small leaves. Phyllody of the bracts is common among plants which bear catkin (amentaceous) inflorescences. They are very common among members of the genus Plantago, for example, as well as the common hop (Humulus lupulus). Involucral bracts of the flowers of members of the family Asteraceae like dahlias and dandelions, may also be affected. Sepals that exhibit phyllody are usually hard to detect due to fact that most sepals already resemble leaves. Close examination, however, can reveal differences in venation in normal sepals and sepals that exhibit phyllody. The full development of perfect leaves from sepals is more common among flowers that have united sepals (monosepalous) than in flowers with separated sepals (polysepalous). Phyllody of the petals can be expressed more mildly as a simple change in shape and color (in which case, it's more accurately virescence), or it can be expressed as fully formed leaves. It is more common among flowers which exhibit corollas of distinct petals (polypetalous) than in flowers in which the petals are fused into a single tube or bowl-like structure (monopetalous). Phyllody of the stamens is rare. In fact, the stamens are the least likely of the floral organs to be affected by phyllody. This is thought to be because the stamens are the most highly differentiated organs in flowers. In contrast, phyllody of the carpels is much more common than the corresponding changes in stamens. Usually, phyllody affects the proximal parts of the carpel (the ovary) more than the distal parts (the style and stigma). The ovule itself may be exposed on the edges or on the inner surface of the carpel if the ovary becomes leaf-like. If the ovule is affected by phyllody, it develops separately from the rest of the carpel. The best known example of phyllody of the carpels is found in the Japanese cherry (Prunus serrulata), in which one or both of the carpels can become leaf-like (although the distal half of the style and the stigma are usually unaffected). Incidentally, some Japanese cherry cultivars also exhibit \\"doubling\\" of the petals due to petalody, where a second corolla develops instead of stamens. Causes =Biotic= In many cultivated plants, phyllody is caused by infections of plant pathogens and/or infestations of ectoparasites. Aside from exhibiting phyllody, they may also exhibit other symptoms like virescence, witch's brooms, chlorosis, and stunted growth. Examples of these biotic factors include: *Phytoplasmas - specialized prokaryotic microorganisms that cause more than 200 distinct plant diseases. They resemble other bacteria but lack cell walls and are filamentous or pleomorphic in form. They are obligate parasites of plant phloem tissue and are spread by insect vectors. They are the most common cause of phyllody. Evidence suggests that phytoplasmas downregulate a gene involved in petal formation, instead causing leaves or leaflike structures to form. Examples of commercially important phytoplasma diseases are aster yellows, apple proliferation, clover phyllody, and Sesamum phyllody. *Viruses, like the rose rosette disease (RRD) *Fungi, like the smut fungus Sphacelotheca reiliana of corn and the rust fungus Atelocauda koae which infects Acacia koa *Water molds, like Sclerophthora macrospora which infects more than 140 kinds of cereals including rice, corn, and wheat. The disease is more commonly known as \\"crazy top\\" because its most striking symptom is phyllody of the ears and tassels. *Insect damage In addition to causing phyllody itself, insects and other ectoparasites also serve as disease vectors that can spread phyllody to other nearby plants. The most common of these insect vectors are leafhoppers, an example of which is Hishimonus phycitis, which transmits the phytoplasma-caused little leaf phyllody in eggplants. The broken-backed bug (Taylorilygus apicalis) is another insect vector of a phytoplasma-caused phyllody in species of Parthenium. Other ectoparasite vectors include eriophyid mites, like the rose leaf curl mite (Phyllocoptes fructiplilus) which is known to be the primary vector of the rose rosette disease; and the chrysanthemum rust mite (Paraphytoptus chrysanthemi) which transmits phytoplasma-caused phyllody in species of chrysanthemums. =Abiotic= Environmental abiotic factors like hot weather or water stress that result in an imbalance in plant hormones during flowering can cause phyllody. These can usually be differentiated from phyllody caused by biotic factors by the simultaneous presence of healthy and abnormal flowers. When conditions normalize, the plants resume normal flowering. The susceptibility of plants to environmentally caused phyllody can be genetic. =Artificial= Phyllody can be artificially induced by applying cytokinins (CK), plant hormones responsible for cell division, as well as apical dominance and axillary bud growth. Conversely, it can be subsequently suppressed with the application of gibberellins (GA), plant hormones responsible for stem elongation, flowering, and sex expression. Related floral teratology Other related floral development abnormalities are: *Petalody - The transformation of floral organs (usually the stamens) into petals. *Pistillody - The transformation of floral organs into pistils. *Sepalody - The transformation of floral organs into sepals or sepal-like bodies. *Staminody - The transformation of floral organs into stamens. Phyllody in plant breeding Phyllody in the green rose (Rosa chinensis 'Viridiflora')In some cases, the occurrence of phyllody has been utilized in plant breeding. One of the most well known examples is the green rose (Rosa chinensis 'Viridiflora'), an ancient Chinese rose cultivar which exhibits green leafy bracts in tight flower-like clusters. In green rose, artificial selection has enabled phyllody to be expressed as a stable mutation.

This is the film from which all other copies will be made. It is known as raw stock prior to exposure. The size of a roll varies depending on the film gauge and whether or not a new roll, re-can, or short end was used. One hundred or 400 foot rolls are common in 16mm, while 400 or 1,000 foot (ft) rolls are used in 35mm work. While these are the most common sizes, other lengths such as 200, 800, or 1,200 ft may be commercially available from film stock manufacturers, usually by special order. Rolls of 100 and 200 ft are generally wound on spools for daylight- loading, while longer lengths are only wound around a plastic core. Core-wound stock has no exposure protection outside its packaging, and therefore must be loaded into a camera magazine within a darkroom or changing bag/tent in order to prevent the film being fogged.  Value  Original camera negative is of great value, as if lost or damaged it cannot be re-created without re-shooting the scene, something which is often impossible. It also contains the highest- quality version of the original image available, before any analog resolution and dynamic range loss from copying. For these reasons, original camera negative is handled with great care, and only by specialized trained people in dedicated film laboratories. Procedures in the laboratory After the film is processed by the film lab, camera rolls are assembled into lab rolls of 1,200 to 1,500 ft. Work prints may be made for viewing dailies or editing the picture on film. Once film editing is finalized, a negative cutter will conform the negative using the Keykode on the edge of the film as a reference, cutting the original camera negative and incorporating any opticals (titles, dissolves, fades, and special effects), and cementing it together into several rolls. The edited original negative is then copied to create a safety positive which can be used as a backup to create a usable negative. At this point, an answer print will be created from the original camera negative, and upon its approval, interpositives (IPs) and internegatives (INs) are created, from which the release prints are made. Generally speaking, the original camera negative is considered too important and delicate to be used for any processes more than necessary, as each pass through a lab process carries the risk of further degrading the quality of the negative by scratching the emulsion. Once an answer print is approved, the interpositives and internegatives are regarded as the earliest generation of the finished and graded film, and are almost always used for transfers to video or new film restorations. The original camera negatives is usually regarded as a last resort in the event that all of the intermediate elements have been compromised or lost. The more popular a film is, the higher the likelihood that the original negative is in a worse shape, due to the need to return to the original camera negative to strike new interpositives to replace the exhausted ones, and thus create more internegatives and release prints. Before 1969, 35mm prints were struck directly from the original negative, often running into hundreds of copies, and causing further wear on the original.  Digital cameras  Physical film stock is still occasionally used in film-making, particularly in prestige productions where the director and cinematographer have the power to require the extra cost, but as of 2016, it is becoming increasingly rare. In modern cinematography, the camera is usually a digital camera, and no physical negative exists. However, the concept of \\"camera original material\\" is still used to describe camera image data. Camera original material that has not yet been ingested, duplicated, and archived is in a similar precarious state to original camera negative in a film process. One of the jobs of the digital imaging technician is to ensure that digital camera original material is backed up as soon as possible.

The Court rejected a constitutional challenge of the criminalization of marijuana. Background The decision involves two cases. The first was where David Malmo-Levine, a \\"marijuana/freedom activist\\", ran an organization in East Vancouver called the \\"Harm Reduction Club\\", which attempts to reduce the harm associated with marijuana use by educating users and the public about the drug and provide the drug at cost. In December 1996 the police raided the Harm Reduction Club and seized 316 grams of marijuana charging Malmo-Levine with possession for the purpose of trafficking. The second case involved the 1993 arrest of Victor Caine for possession of marijuana. Caine was in his van by the ocean when two RCMP officers approached him. He was stopped and a 0.5 gram were found in his possession. Both Caine and Malmo-Levine challenged the constitutionality of the criminalization of marijuana under the Narcotics Control Act. Malmo- Levine's argument focused on whether there should be a requirement of harm for criminal law. He argued that the constitutional power to enact criminal law under section 91(27) of the Constitution Act, 1867 is limited to conduct that causes harm. He further argued that the \\"harm principle\\" should be a principle of fundamental justice under section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Opinion of the Court Gonthier and Binnie JJ., writing the majority, rejected all the arguments for the requirements of harm under section 91(27) of the Constitution Act, 1867 and section 7 of the Charter. They held that Parliament need not establish harm but only a reasonable apprehension of harm. Gonthier and Binnie looked towards R v Hauser, which held that narcotics were a new matter not considered in 1867 and so falls under the peace, order and good government power. They suggest that this case was likely wrong as narcotics is clearly a matter of criminal law. The criminal law power, they state, includes the protection of vulnerable groups. Thus the government is able to control activities for the protection of drug users and society.

History  The station was opened by the Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway on 23 August 1848 as Gretna. The Glasgow and South Western Railway renamed the station as Gretna Green in April 1852. On 6 December 1965, the station was closed and the station building was sold. In 1975, the site of the station became the eastern end of the single line section to , as part of the route rationalisation carried out by British Rail following the electrification of the West Coast Main Line. The station was reopened in September 1993 by British Rail, with just one platform on the northern side of the line to the west of the previous station, coinciding with the western end of the points marking the end of the single track section from Annan. The second platform came into use when the line to Annan was restored to double track in August 2008. The Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway station was one of three serving Gretna, the others being: * Gretna built by the Caledonian Railway in 1847, closing in 1951. * Gretna built by Border Union Railway in 1861, closing in 1915.

It is located on the Glasgow South Western Line northwest of . The station is owned by Network Rail and managed by Abellio ScotRail, which provides nearly all passenger train services with Northern running two to Newcastle. Until the early 1980s, the goods yard at Annan station was still in regular use. The station was also used to dispatch fresh fish to London until the mid to late 1980s. Shortly after leaving Annan station on a westbound service to Dumfries, the line crosses a viaduct over the River Annan and adjoining flood plains. Also just to the west of Annan is a disused junction and dismantled line heading south to the Cochran's Boiler plant at Newbie.(BIB Cochran)  History  Siding round the back of the station Opened by the Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway, then run by the Glasgow and South Western Railway, it became part of the London, Midland and Scottish Railway during the Grouping of 1923. The station then passed on to the Scottish Region of British Railways on nationalisation in 1948. In 1975, the section of line eastwards to Gretna Junction was singled by British Rail as part of the West Coast Main Line electrification and re-signalling scheme, with control shared between the power box at Carlisle and the signal box at the station. However the second track was re-instated in 2008 by Network Rail to help deal with increased traffic levels (mainly train loads of imported coal from the deep water terminal at Hunterston to power stations in the East Midlands & West Yorkshire). When sectorisation was introduced in the 1980s, the station was served by ScotRail until the privatisation of British Rail.  Annan Shawhill railway station  At one point in its history, Annan was served by two railway stations (1870–1931). station was on the long-disused Solway Junction Railway which ran from Kirtlebridge on the current West Coast Main Line through the east side of Annan, across the Solway Firth and on to Maryport in Cumbria. =Newbie Junction Halt= Newbie Junction Halt railway station was located to the west of the Annan Viaduct and briefly (1898 to 1904) served only workers employed at the Cochran & Co. boiler factory and the Newbie Brick and Tile works with trains calling in the mornings and evenings only.

It is located on the Glasgow South Western Line. The station is owned by Network Rail and managed by Abellio ScotRail who provide nearly all passenger train services. It is staffed on a part-time basis throughout the week. Train services are provided by Abellio ScotRail and Northern.  History  Opened by the Glasgow, Dumfries and Carlisle Railway in 1848, the line serving it was extended northwards to Kilmarnock and Glasgow two years later (the GD&CR; became part of the Glasgow and South Western Railway at the same time). It subsequently became the junction for branches to Castle Douglas and Stranraer (opened between 1859 and 1861), (opened in 1863 and taken over in 1865 by the Caledonian Railway) and latterly to Moniaive (Cairn Valley Railway, opened in 1905). All of these later lines have now closed (the Port Road to Stranraer being the last to go in June 1965), leaving only the original G&SWR; main line open to serve the town. The Beeching Axe cutting the Castle Douglas and Dumfries Railway and Portpatrick and Wigtownshire Railway has resulted in adverse mileage to connect Stranraer with a longer line via Kilmarnock and Ayr. The journey by railway and ferry via Stranraer to Larne Harbour or since the line closed to the Port of Belfast is much longer. Historic Scotland have designated the station and separately the adjacent station hotel as category B listed buildings. Carnation built an evaporated milk factory in Dumfries that opened in 1935, eventually constructing three units producing tin cans, evaporated milk and latterly Coffeemate. The original factory had private siding access to the station's goods yard, which gave access for milk trains to the facility, in both delivering raw product as well as distribution to London. Milk trains stopped in the mid-1970s. The United States parent company was bought by Nestle in 1985, after which a decline in the facility began. CoffeeMate production ceased in 2000, after which the site was fully redeveloped as an industrial estate. In fiction The station features in the novel The Thirty-Nine Steps (1915) by John Buchan. Richard Hannay, fleeing from German secret agents, travels from London St Pancras to Galloway, changing trains at Dumfries. In 1939, T.S.

The author's disillusionment and pessimistic attitude is obvious throughout. Similarly to many other works by Bykaw, parallels to existentialism can be drawn, e.g., the focus on choice and moral scruples. It depicts the absence of liberty and the powerlessness of an individual within a totalitarian system. As Vasil Bykaŭ was declared a persona non grata during Alexander Lukashenko's regime, the stories were published in Russian literary magazines 'Druzhba Narodov' (nr 7,8,11, 1999) and 'Zvezda' (nr 5, 1999), the first book format being the translation (of most of the stories) into Estonian, entitled Valgevene tragöödia ('The Tragedy of Belarus'), in 2001.

It is bounded on the west by the Ohio River, and Rabbit Hash, on the south by Big Bone Creek, which empties into the river at Big Bone Landing. The northern extent is along Hathaway Road, and the eastern portion extends not further than U.S. 42, and is approached from that direction by Beaver Road (Route 338) coming from either Richwood or Walton. Big Bone took its name from a nearby prehistoric mineral lick of the same name. Geographical features of interest include Big Bone Lick State Park and the now disappeared Big Bone Island. History A post office called Bigbone was established in 1890, and remained in operation until 1941. The area was named after the extraordinarily large bones, including mammoths and mastodons, found in the swamps around the salt lick frequented by animals, who need salt in their diets. The fossil deposits were a well known feature in the geographical region. Geography Big Bone Lick, now the site of Big Bone Lick State Park, is a well-known landmark in the immediate area of Big Bone. The salt lick, or lick, as it is more generally known locally, was long known to the original inhabitants of the area. It was discovered by people of European descent about 1735, the first recorded instance being one Charles Lemoyne de Longueil, a French Captain, in 1739. Robert Smith, an Indian trader, was another early subject that understood the importance of the bones and site. Other notable visitors were Daniel Boone, William Clark, William Henry Harrison, Christopher Columbus Graham, Mary Draper Ingles, Constantine S. Rafinesque, and many others. Big Bone Creek enters the Ohio River at mile 516.8 below Pittsburgh. The mouth is at the division of Boone and Gallatin Counties, Kentucky, near the site of Big Bone Island. It is navigable for several miles, and flows through Big Bone Lick State Park. =Big Bone Island= Big Bone Island was a small, natural island composed of sand and gravel in the Ohio River near the mouth of Big Bone Creek at Big Bone. It is just south of the Boone County line in Gallatin County, Kentucky. Of note is that the county line \\"runs down the center of the creek\\". It plays a part in local lore and history of the area and was a popular fishing and camping location. The island has disappeared due mostly to the raising of the river caused by the placement of the Markland Dam, but also due to slabs of floating river ice which destroyed much of the vegetation and carried away most of the soil. In January 1978, the Ohio River rapidly rose from 29.6 feet on January 25 to 53.9 feet on January 30, during what has been described as \\"one of the most severe winter months in southwestern Ohio history.\\" This caused an enormous ice jam, which eventually broke, sending \\"a wall of ice and water\\" downstream. It has been stated that the decisions and actions of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers on January 27, 1978 at the Markland Dam caused the ice jam to break. This was characterized as being perhaps the worst disaster in modernity on the Ohio River, and caused significant damage, with entire docks, barges and boats crammed against or forced through the Markland dam, and many boats and barges sunk. The ice literally \\"shaved off\\" Big Bone Island at the time. Sometime in the 1970s, the island disappeared entirely.

It was honored with a NAB Marconi award in 2013 for Country Station of the Year and again in 2014 as Major Market Station of the Year. The station has also won the Billboard/Airplay Monitor Radio Awards award for Best Country Station three times. History =Early Years= The station signed on at 92.5 FM in August 1962 as KLVL-FM, Houston's first Spanish language FM station, \\"La Voz Latina\\".Broadcasting Yearbook 1977 page C-210 In 1969, the station's original owner, Felix Morales, sold station for $175,000 in cash to Sudbrink Broadcasting. The callsign was changed to KFMZ, its transmitter facilities located on the top of the Pasadena State Bank building (demolished in July 2019), operating with 15 kilowatts effective radiated power. Due to complaints from KFMK, the calls were changed to KYED (on air moniker was \\"Keyed\\"), airing paid religious programming during the day and oldies at night. =Beautiful \\"Kind 92\\" KYND= After upgrading to a powerful 100,000-watt signal atop the new Shell Plaza in 1971 to cover the entire Houston market, the station changed its call letters to KYND (\\"Kind 92\\") and adopted the syndicated Beautiful Music format of Stereo Radio Productions. Soon after this upgrade, Sudbrink sold KYND for over $2 million, over a tenfold return on his original investment. KYND grew to be the dominant beautiful music outlet in Houston, and in 1976 became the first FM radio station to top the Houston radio ratings. In the late summer of 1982, KYND moved from 92.5 MHz to 92.9 MHz to accommodate the incoming 92.1 FM in Seabrook, Texas.http://houstonradiohistory.blogspot.com/search?q=kynd =93Q= On July 2, 1982, The New 79Q was launched on 790 AM KULF with a Top 40 format. The morning show was composed of John Lander and the Q-Morning Zoo, and proved to be an instant success. The station acquired the KKBQ callsign on August 13, 1982. The station's owners decided to add the Top 40 format to KYND (92.9 FM). The beautiful music format on 92.9 was beginning to see a decline in ratings as younger listeners thought of the format as \\"elevator music.\\" On December 29, 1982, at 6:00 a.m., \\"Houston's Stereo Combination\\" (a term coined by morning host John Lander since 790 AM was in AM stereo, originally the Kahn ISB and later the Motorola C-QUAM format) was born as KYND became The New 93KBQ, simulcasting part of the day on KKBQ (AM). The first song played was \\"Eye of the Tiger\\" by Survivor. The same song was used for the launch of WHTZ in New York City on August 2, 1983. The FM acquired the KKBQ-FM callsign two months later in February 1983. Later on, the station rebranded, first as \\"93FM\\", and finally to the more famous \\"93Q\\", in 1986. Incidentally, in the formats' early years on FM, listeners were heard during call-ins erroneously referring to the station as \\"Q93\\" or \\"93Q\\". For a time, the AM station ran the morning show live from the FM. The rest of the day the two stations ran the same playlist, but slightly delayed on the AM side, which ran identical IDs, promos, and jock announcements customized for the AM. (At the time, the Federal Communications Commission did not allow AM and FM stations to fully simulcast in medium and larger cities.) This practice continued until the late 1980s, when it became a full-time simulcast, after the FCC relaxed its simulcasting rules. The simulcast would continue until January 16, 1998, when the AM flipped to adult standards. Growth The Q Morning Zoo gained increased exposure in 1985. The show incorporated comedy bits with a Top-40 playlist. On October 5, 1985, John Lander and the Morning Zoo began broadcasting a syndicated weekend show on 100 radio stations around the country. The show was also selected as one of Continental Airlines's inflight music channels. In fall 1985, the Arbitron ratings listed KKBQ as the number two station in the Houston market. The following year, radio personality John Carrillo (known on-air as John Rio), left the Q Morning Zoo and moved to Houston station KSRR. KKBQ sued Carrillo to prevent him from using his character, Mr. Leonard. Carrillo countersued the station, and the lawsuit ended in a settlement allowing Carrillo to use the character on air, and allowing KKBQ deejays to also use the character. In 1987, KKBQ won the Houston Association of Radio Broadcasters' Award for Local/Retail Station Promotion. Rivalry with KRBE In mid-1985, KRBE dropped its Adult Contemporary format and flipped back to top 40/CHR as \\"Hottest Hits 104 KRBE\\"; then, soon after, morphed to \\"Power 104\\", and went head to head with KKBQ throughout the remainder of the 1980s. In mid-1987, KRBE took a lean towards dance and began weekend mixshows called \\"The Friday and Saturday Night Power Mix\\". To counter, KKBQ began its own weekend mixshow, Club 93Q. In January 1988, KRBE retaliated by going on location with The Saturday Night Power Mix to a nightclub with the house DJ mixing live on the air. KKBQ scrambled for the next five months to find a club to host a live mixshow. On May 29, 1988, KKBQ launched its first ever weekly live broadcast, called 93Q Live On the Cutting Edge from Club 6400.\\" The music skewed towards an 18+ crowd and eschewed Top 40 hits; true to the show's name, it was a mix of industrial, EBM, new wave, gothic rock, synthpop and Hi-NRG dance. Ironically, a good amount of the music on 93Q Live On The Cutting Edge had actually been heard previously on KRBE's Saturday Night Power Mix. KKBQ beat KRBE at its own game, and the Club 6400 shows set the standard for future mixshows on radio stations throughout Houston. The Club 6400 shows became so popular among Houston's youthful set that the term \\"6400 music\\" became a collective reference for the types of music played at the club, and the reference, to this day, is still understood by many Houstonians in their late 30s to early 50s. =Flip to Country= By the winter of 1990, Arbitron ratings showed that KKBQ had lost market share in Houston, falling to ninth (from second in the Fall of 1988). The drop continued; by the Spring of 1991, the station was 13th in the Arbitron ratings. In an attempt to stem the ratings drop, the station declined to renew John Lander's contract as lead morning show personality. On March 11, 1991, KKBQ introduced its new Morning Zoo, starring veteran deejay Cleveland Wheeler, who had pioneered the Zoo format while working for WRBQ-FM in Tampa Bay, Florida. Along with his cohosts Nancy Alexander and T.R. Benker, Wheeler planned to introduce a more positive and energetic show, focusing on local comedy routines rather than nationally syndicated comedy, and he vowed to stop playing rap music. The Morning Zoo was officially cancelled on August 17, 1991. At the same time, KKBQ quietly dropped its nine-year-old format and replaced it with a \\"rock hits\\" playlist. Featuring music by artists such as Depeche Mode, 38 Special, Tom Petty and Bryan Adams, the new format was designed to appeal to older listeners. By this time, country music had become the most popular radio format in the United States, reaching almost 40% of the U.S. adult population each week. Between 1990 and 1992, country record and concert revenues had doubled. To improve the station's ratings woes, management decided to change course and flip to the growing format. At Midnight on September 19, 1991, after playing \\"Wind of Change\\" by The Scorpions, KKBQ began stunting with ocean wave sounds. At 6 a.m. that day, KKBQ flipped to a new \\"easy country\\" format. The \\"easy country\\" format was a country music version of adult contemporary, aimed at an older audience. The first song played in its entirety on this new version of the station was George Strait's \\"You Look So Good in Love\\". Final Hour of 93Q 93Q Becomes 92.9 Easy Country With the exception of Danny Garcia, all of the other deejays were let go, as the station thought they were more \\"young, CHR type jocks\\". The format change did not help their ratings, as KKBQ sank to 17th in the Houston market in 1992. On September 11, 1992, the station moved away from the easy country format to target a younger audience.http://www.americanradiohistory.com/Archive- RandR/1990s/1992/RR-1992-09-18.pdf Now known as \\"93Q Country\\", the station became \\"surprisingly successful playing youthful country acts and adopting an on-air personality that is up-tempo and more like Top 40 radio\\". Despite the new format, 93Q recycled some of the jingles, laser sound effects, stingers, and music beds from the CHR days. The new morning show team was Steven Craig, formerly of WYTZ-Chicago and Nancy Alexander, a hold-over from the CHR days. Harley Colt handled middays, while afternoon drive time was taken over by Cactus Jack Talley (better known as Jack Da Wack of both WEZB-New Orleans and WHTZ-New York City), and Charlie \\"Shotgun\\" Walker handled nights. By 1994, the station had become the number one country station in Houston in the coveted 18-34 age group and was the number two station overall in the area. Later that year, they were named the Country Music Radio Station of the Year by Billboard Magazine and Airplay Monitor. In spring 1995, KKBQ pulled ahead of local rival KILT-FM in the Arbitron ratings for the first time. That year, they were again named Country Station of the Year by Billboard Magazine, and their program director Dene Hallam was named program director of the year. The following year, the station was named Major Market Radio Station of the Year by the Country Music Association, beating out KILT. They repeated their win as Best Station of the Year at the Billboard/Airplay Monitor Radio Awards in 1997, again beating local rival KILT. In 2006, KKBQ was nominated for a Country Music Association Award for Station of the Year - Major Market. In 2013, KKBQ won the NAB's Marconi Award for Country Station of the Year.http://www.nab.org/documents/newsRoom/RadioShow2013/Marconi/091913_Marconi_Country_Station.htm In 2014, the station picked up another Marconi from the NAB, being named Major Market Station of the Year.http://www.nab.org/documents/newsRoom/RadioShow2014/Marconi/091114_Marconi_MajorMarket_Station.htm The station dropped the -FM suffix to its call sign and became the current KKBQ on April 21, 2016. Ownership changes Evergreen Media Corporation purchased KKBQ from the Pacific and Southern Company (a subsidiary of Gannett Corporation) in April 1997, as Gannett was divesting itself of all of its radio stations. At that time, Arbitron ranked KKBQ as the seventh most popular station in Houston. It was estimated that KKBQ was priced around $100 million, making it the single highest-priced radio station sold in Houston to that point. Shortly after the acquisition, Evergreen merged with Chancellor Broadcasting to become Chancellor Media Corporation. In October 1999, Clear Channel Communications purchased Chancellor (then known as AMFM, Inc.), thus gaining control of KKBQ. As part of a required divestiture to meet federal ownership regulations, Clear Channel sold KKBQ to Cox Radio in March 2000. Cox vowed to have KKBQ run fewer advertisements.

It was the result of a coup d'état organized by the Portuguese Republican Party. By 1910, the Kingdom of Portugal was in deep crisis: British pressure on Portugal's colonies, the royal family's expenses, the assassination of the King and his heir in 1908, changing religious and social views, instability of the two political parties (Progressive and Regenerador), the dictatorship of João Franco, and the regime's apparent inability to adapt to modern times all led to widespread resentment against the Monarchy. The proponents of the republic, particularly the Republican Party, found ways to take advantage of the situation. The Republican Party presented itself as the only one that had a programme that was capable of returning to the country its lost status and place Portugal on the way of progress.A este propósito ver citado na secção \\"O Partido Republicano Português\\" deste artigo. After a reluctance of the military to combat the nearly two thousand soldiers and sailors that rebelled between 3 and 4 October 1910, the Republic was proclaimed at 9 o'clock a.m of the next day from the balcony of the Lisbon City Hall in Lisbon. After the revolution, a provisional government led by Teófilo Braga directed the fate of the country until the approval of the Constitution in 1911 that marked the beginning of the First Republic. Among other things, with the establishment of the republic, national symbols were changed: the national anthem and the flag. The revolution produced some civil and religious liberties, although there was no advance in women's rights and in workers rights, unlike what happened in other European countries. Background =1890 British Ultimatum and 31 January rebellion= The Pink Map project: Portugal's claim of sovereignty over the lands between Portuguese Angola and Portuguese Mozambique. On 11 January 1890 the British government of Lord Salisbury sent the Portuguese government an ultimatum in the form of a \\"memorandum\\", demanding the retreat of the Portuguese military forces led by Serpa Pinto from the territory between the colonies of Angola and Mozambique (in the current Zimbabwe and Zambia), an area claimed by Portugal under the Pink Map. The swift compliance by the government to the British demands was seen as a national humiliation by a broad cross-section of the population and the elite. This ramified deep dissatisfaction with the new king, Carlos I of Portugal, the royal family and the institution of the monarchy, all of which were seen as responsible for the alleged process of \\"national decline\\". The situation was aggravated by the severe financial crisis that occurred between 1890 and 1891, when the money sent from emigrants in Brazil decreased by 80% with the so-called crisis of encilhamento following the proclamation of the republic in Brazil two months previously, an event that was followed with apprehension by the monarchic government and with jubilation by the defenders of the republic in Portugal. The republicans knew how to take advantage of the dissatisfaction, initiating an increase of their social support base that would climax in the demise of the regime. Commemorative plaque on 31 de Janeiro Street, in Porto. On 14 January, the progressive government fell and the leader of the Regenerador Party, António de Serpa Pimentel, was chosen to form the new government. The progressivists then began to attack the king, voting for republican candidates in the March election of that year, questioning the colonial agreement then signed with the British. Feeding an atmosphere of near insurrection, on 23 March 1890, António José de Almeida, at the time a student in the University of Coimbra and, later on, President of the Republic, published an article entitled \\"Bragança, o último\\", considered slanderous against the king and led to Almeida's imprisonment. On 1 April 1890, the explorer Silva Porto self- immolated wrapped in a Portuguese flag in Kuito, Angola, after failed negotiations with the locals, under orders of Paiva Couceiro, which he attributed to the ultimatum. The death of the well-known explorer of the African continent generated a wave of national sentiment, and his funeral was followed by a crowd in Porto. On 11 April, Guerra Junqueiro's poetic work Finis Patriae, a satire criticising the King, went on sale. In the city of Porto, on 31 January 1891, a military uprising against the monarchy took place, constituted mainly by sergeants and enlisted ranks. The rebels, who used the nationalist anthem A Portuguesa as their marching song, took the Paços do Concelho, from whose balcony, the republican journalist and politician Augusto Manuel Alves da Veiga proclaimed the establishment of the republic in Portugal and hoisted a red and green flag belonging to the Federal Democratic Centre. The movement was, shortly afterwards, suppressed by a military detachment of the municipal guard that remained loyal to the government, resulting in 40 injured and 12 casualties. The captured rebels were judged. 250 received sentences of between 18 months and 15 years of exile in Africa. A Portuguesa was forbidden. Despite its failure, the rebellion of 31 January 1891 was the first large threat felt by the monarchic regime and a sign of what would come almost two decades later. =The Portuguese Republican Party= The revolutionary movement of 5 October 1910 occurred following the ideological and political action that, since its creation in 1876, the Portuguese Republican Party (PRP) had been developing with the objective of overthrowing the monarchic regime. By making the national renewal dependent on the end of the monarchy, the Republican Party managed to define itself as distinct from the Portuguese Socialist Party, which defended a collaboration with the regime in exchange for the rights of the working class and attracted the sympathy of the dissatisfied sections of society. Disagreements within the party became more connected with matters of political than ideological strategy. The ideological direction of the Portuguese republicanism had been traced much earlier by the works of José Félix Henriques Nogueira, little changed through the years, except in terms of later adaptation to the everyday realities of the country. The works of Teófilo Braga contributed to this task by trying to concretise the decentralising and federalist ideas, abandoning the socialist quality in favour of democratic aspects. This change also aimed to attract the small and medium bourgeoisie, which turned into one of the main bases of republican support. In the election of 13 October 1878 the PRP elected its first member of parliament, José Joaquim Rodrigues de Freitas, for Porto. There was also an intention to give the overthrow of the monarchy overtones of unification, nationalism and being above the particular interests of individual social classes.\\"Ser republicano, por 1890, 1900 e 1910, queria dizer ser contra a Monarquia, contra a Igreja e os Jesuítas, contra a corrupção política e os partidos monárquicos. [...] A tendência geral era para se conceder à palavra República algo de carismático e místico, e para acreditar que bastaria a sua proclamação para libertar o País de toda a injustiça e de todos os males\\". A. H. de Oliveira Marques (coord.). \\"Portugal – Da Monarquia para a República\\" in Nova História de Portugal, Volume XI, Lisboa, Editorial Presença, 1991, p. 372. cit in Artur Ferreira Coimbra. Paiva Couceiro e a Contra-Revolução Monárquica (1910–1919). Braga, Universidade do Minho, 2000. pp. 13–14. This panacea that would cure, once and for all, all the ills of the nation, elevating it to glory, emphasised two fundamental tendencies: nationalism and colonialism. From this combination came the final desertion of Iberian Federalism, patent in the first republican theses by José Félix Henriques Nogueira, identifying the monarchy as antipatriotism and the yielding to foreign interests. Another strong component of republican ideology was emphasised by anti-clericalism, due to the theorisation of Teófilo Braga, who identified religion as an obstacle to progress and responsible for the scientific retardation of Portugal, in opposition to republicanism, which was linked by him to science, progress and well-being.Teófilo Braga, em carta escrita na sua juventude, prefigura já um implacável anticlericalismo: \\"O padre há-de ser sempre uma sombra que se não dissipa nem à força de muita luz; envolve-nos, deixa-nos na solidão de nós mesmos, no tédio do vazio, quando a alegria transpira e ri lá fora por toda a parte; torna-nos pouco a pouco a vida um remorso, a esperança um nada impalpável, porque só no-la prometem para além da campa\\" cit. in Eudóxio César Azedo Gneco, also known as Azedo Gneco, one of the main leaders of the Portuguese Socialist Party, giving a speech at a republican gathering in Lisbon (1 May 1907) Ideological issues were not, ultimately, fundamental to the republican strategy: for the majority of sympathisers, who didn't even know the texts of the main manifestos, it was enough to be against the monarchy, against the Church and against the political corruption of traditional parties. This lack of ideological preoccupation doesn't mean that the party didn't bother to spread its principles. The most effective action of dissemination was the propaganda made through its rallies and popular demonstrations and bulletins such as A Voz Pública (The Public Voice) in Porto, O Século (The Age, from 1880) O Mundo (The World, from 1900) and A Luta (The Struggle, from 1906) in Lisbon. The republican propaganda managed to take advantage of some historical facts with popular repercussions. The celebrations of the third centenary of the death of Luís de Camões (Portugal's Shakespeare) in 1580, and the British ultimatum in 1890, for example, were capitalised on to present the republicans as the true representatives of the purest national sentiments and popular aspirations. The third centenary of Camões was commemorated with great celebrations: a civic entourage that went through the streets of Lisbon, in the middle of great popular enthusiasm and, also, the transfer of the remains of Camões and Vasco da Gama to Jerónimos Monastery. The atmosphere of the national celebration that characterised the commemorations complemented the patriotic exaltation. The idea of the Camões commemorations came from the Lisbon Geographic Society, but the execution was entrusted to a commission constituted by, amongst others, Teófilo Braga, Ramalho Ortigão, Jaime Batalha Reis, Magalhães Lima and Pinheiro Chagas, leading figures of the Republican Party. Besides Rodrigues de Freitas, Manuel de Arriaga, José Elias Garcia, Zófimo Consiglieri Pedroso, José Maria Latino Coelho, Bernardino Pereira Pinheiro, Eduardo de Abreu, Francisco Teixeira de Queirós, José Jacinto Nunes, and Francisco Gomes da Silva were also elected members of parliament, representing the PRP in various legislative sessions between 1884 and 1894. From this date to 1900 there was no republican parliamentary representation. In this phase, while separated from parliament, the party committed itself to its internal organisation. After a period of great repression of PRP, the republican movement could reenter the legislative race in 1900, electing four parliament members: Afonso Costa, Alexandre Braga, António José de Almeida and João de Meneses. =1908 Lisbon regicide= thumb Anonymous reconstruction of the regicide published in the French press. On 1 February 1908, while returning to Lisbon from the Ducal Palace in Vila Viçosa in Alentejo, where they had spent time hunting during the hunting season in the winter, the King dom Carlos I and his heir- apparent and his eldest son, Luís Filipe, Prince Royal of Portugal were assassinated in Lisbon's Commerce Square. The attack occurred after a progressive decline of the Portuguese political system, effective since the Regeneration, due in part by the political erosion originated from the system of rotating governments (which saw the Progressive Party and Regenerator Party alternating in government). The king, as arbiter of the system, a role attributed to him by the Constitution, had designated João Franco as the president of the Council of Ministers (government chief). João Franco, dissident of the Regenerator Party, convinced the king to dissolve the parliament so that he could implement a series of measures with the aim to moralise Portuguese politics. This decision irritated not only the republican but also the monarchical opposition, led by political rivals of Franco who accused him of governing in dictatorship. The events were aggravated by the issues of the advanced payments to the Royal House and the signing of the decree of 30 January 1908 that foresaw the banishment to the colonies, without judgement, of those involved in a failed republican coup occurred two days previously, the Municipal Library Elevator Coup. The Royal Family was in the Ducal Palace of Vila Viçosa, but the events led the king to bring forward his return to Lisbon, taking a train from the station of Vila Viçosa on the morning of 1 February. The royal escort arrived in Barreiro in the evening where, to cross the Tagus, it took a steam boat to Terreiro do Paço in Lisbon, at around 5pm. Despite the atmosphere of great tension, the king chose to continue in an open carriage, with a reduced escort, to demonstrate normality. While greeting the crowds present in the square, the carriage was struck by several shots. One of the carbine bullets hit the king's neck, killing him immediately. More shooting followed, and the prince was hit by another shot. The queen defended herself with the bouquet of flowers offered by the people, which she used to hit one of the attackers who had climbed onto the carriage. The prince D. Manuel was also struck on an arm. Two of the attackers, Manuel Buíça, primary school teacher, and Alfredo Luís da Costa, commerce employee and editor, were killed in the scene. Others managed to escape. The carriage entered the Navy Arsenal, where the deaths of the king and his heir were verified. After the attack, João Franco's government was dismissed and a rigorous investigation was launched which found, two years later, that the attack had been committed by members of the secret organisation Carbonária. The investigation process finished on 5 October 1910. However, more suspects were subsequently found to have direct involvement, some of whom had gone into hiding in Brazil and France and at least two had been killed by the Carbonária itself. Europe was shocked by the attack, since King Carlos was highly regarded by other European heads of state.\\"O atentado horrorizará a Europa e o mundo. O facto de não ser um acto isolado de um anarquista ou de um par de fanáticos, mas um conluio organizado, chocará particularmente a comunidade internacional. Imagens das campas dos regicidas cobertas de flores são publicadas na imprensa inglesa com o título \\"Lisbon's Shame\\" (A vergonha de Lisboa).\\" In NOBRE, Eduardo. \\"O regicídio de 1908\\" in revista Única, 2004, p. 40. The Lisbon regicide hastened the end of the monarchy by placing D. Manuel II on the throne and throwing the monarchical parties against one another. =The agony of the monarchy= Due to his young age (18 years) and the tragic and bloody way in which he reached power, Manuel II of Portugal obtained an initial sympathy from the public. The young king began his rule by nominating a consensus government presided by admiral Francisco Joaquim Ferreira do Amaral. This government of pacification, as it became known, despite achieving a temporary calm, only lasted for a short amount of time.. The political situation degraded again quickly, leading to having seven different governments in the space of two years. The monarchical parties rose against each other once more and fragmented into splinter groups, while the Republican Party continued to gain ground. In the election of 5 April 1908, the last legislative elections to occur during the monarchy, seven members were elected to parliament, among which were Estêvão de Vasconcelos, Feio Terenas and Manuel de Brito Camacho. In the election of 28 August 1910 the party had a resounding success, electing 14 members to parliament, 10 for Lisbon. Meanwhile, in spite of the evident electoral success of the republican movement, the most revolutionary sector of the party called for armed struggle as the best means to achieve power in a short amount of time. It was this faction that came victorious from the party congress that took place in Setúbal between 23 and 25 April 1909. The directorate, composed by the moderate Teófilo Braga, Basílio Teles, Eusébio Leão, José Cupertino Ribeiro and José Relvas, received from the congress the imperative mandate to start the revolution. The logistic role for the preparation of plot was assigned to the most radical elements. The civil committee was formed by Afonso Costa, João Pinheiro Chagas and António José de Almeida, while the admiral Carlos Cândido dos Reis was the leader of the military committee. António José de Almeida was assigned the role of organising the secret societies such as the Carbonária – in whose leadership was integrated the naval commissary António Machado Santos —, the freemasons and the Junta Liberal, led by Miguel Bombarda. This eminent doctor played an important part in the dissemination of republican propaganda among the bourgeoisie, which brought many sympathisers to the republican cause. The period between the congress of 1909 and the emergence of the revolution was marked by great instability and political and social unrest, with several threats of uprising risking the revolution due to the impatience of the navy, led by Machado Santos, who was ready for action. The uprising On 3 October 1910 the republican uprising foreshadowed by the political unrest finally took place. Although many of those involved in the republican cause avoided participation in the uprising, making it seem like the revolt had failed, it eventually succeeded thanks to the government's inability to gather enough troops to control the nearly two hundred armed revolutionaries that resisted in the Rotunda. =Movements of the first revolutionaries= Teixeira de Sousa In summer of 1910 Lisbon was teeming with rumours and many times the President of the Council of Ministers (Prime Minister) Teixeira de Sousa was warned of imminent coups d'état. The revolution was not an exception: the coup was expected by the government, who on 3 October gave orders for all the garrison troops of the city to be on guard. After a dinner offered in honour of D. Manuel II by Brazilian president Hermes da Fonseca, then on a state visit to Portugal, the monarch retreated to the Palace of Necessidades while his uncle and sworn heir to the throne, prince D. Afonso, went on to the Citadel of Cascais. After the murder of Miguel Bombarda, shot by one of his patients, the republican leaders assembled with urgency on the night of the 3rd. Some officials were against the meeting due to the strong military presence, but Admiral Cândido dos Reis insisted for it to take place, saying \\"A Revolução não será adiada: sigam-me, se quiserem. Havendo um só que cumpra o seu dever, esse único serei eu.\\" (\\"The Revolution will not be delayed: follow me, if you want. If there is one that fulfills their duty, this one will be me.\\"). Rotunda Square. Machado Santos had already got into action and did not attend the assembly. Instead, he went to the military quarters of the 16th Infantry Regiment where a revolutionary corporal had triggered a rebellion involving the majority of the garrison. A commander and a captain were killed when they made an attempt to control it. Entering a barracks with dozens of members of the Carbonária, the naval officer went on with about 100 soldiers that entered the 1st Artillery Regiment, where Captain Afonso Palla and a few sergeants and civilians, had already taken the administration building and captured all officers that refused to join them.\\"Quartel de Compolide\\" in Da Conspiração ao 5 de Outubro de 1910 With the arrival of Machado Santos two columns were formed which were placed under the leadership of captains Sá Cardoso and Palla. The first went to meet the 2nd Infantry Regiment and the 2nd Caçadores Regiment, also sympathisers of the rebellion, to go on to Alcântara where it was to support the naval barracks. The original route intersected with a Municipal Guard outpost which forced the column to follow a different route. After a few confrontations with the police and civilians, it finally found the column led by Palla. Together, the columns advanced to Rotunda, where they entrenched at around 5am. The stationed force was composed of around 200 to 300 men of the 1st Artillery Regiment, 50 to 60 men of the 16th Infantry Regiment and around 200 civilians. The captains Sá Cardoso and Palla and the naval commissary Machado Santos were among the 9 officers in command. Meanwhile, Lieutenant Ladislau Parreira and some officers and civilians entered the barracks of the Naval Corps of Alcântara at 1am, managing to take arms, provoke a revolt and capture the commanders, one of whom was wounded. The aim of this action was to prevent the exit of the cavalry unit of the Municipal Guard, an aim that was achieved.\\"Quartel do Corpo de Marinheiros de Alcântara\\" in Da Conspiração ao 5 de Outubro de 1910 For this end, they required the support of 3 warships anchored in the Tagus. By this time, Lieutenant Mendes Cabeçadas had already taken command of the mutinied crew of the NRP Adamastor while the mutinied crew of the São Rafael waited for an officer to command it. At about 7am Ladislau Parreira, having been informed by civilians of the situation, sent the Second-Lieutenant Tito de Morais to take command of the São Rafael, with orders for both ships to support the garrison of the barracks. When it became known that on the ship D. Carlos I the crew had begun a mutiny but the officers had entrenched, Lieutenant Carlos da Maia and a few sailors left the São Rafael. After some gunfire from which a lieutenant and a ship commander became wounded, the officers gave up control of the D. Carlos I, yielding it to the hands of the republicans. Portuguese cruiser Dom Carlos I painted by Giovanni Battista Castagneto That was the last unit to join the rebels, which included by then part of the 1st Artillery Regiment, 16th Infantry Regiment, the naval corps and the three warships. Navy members had joined in large numbers as expected, but many military sections considered sympathizers with the cause hadn't joined. Even so, the republican forces included about 400 men in Rotunda, 1000 to 1500 in Alcântara counting the naval crews, as well as having managed to take hold of the city's artillery, with most of the ammunition, to which was added the naval artillery. Rotunda and Alcântara were occupied, but concrete plans for the revolution had not yet been decided and the main leaders hadn't yet appeared. In spite of this, the beginning of the events did not occur favorably for the rebels. The three cannon shots – the accorded signal for the civilians and military to advance – did not take place. Only a shot was heard and the Admiral Cândido dos Reis, expecting the signal to take command of the warships, was informed that everything had failed, which prompted him to retire to his sister's house. The next morning his dead body was found in Arroios. In desperation, he had committed suicide by a shot to the head. Meanwhile, in Rotunda, the apparent calm in the city was so discouraging to the rebels that officers preferred to give up. Sá Cardoso, Palla and other officers retired to their houses, but Machado Santos stayed and assumed command. This decision proved fundamental to the success of the revolution. =The government forces= The military garrison of Lisbon was composed by four infantry regiments, two cavalry regiments and two Caçadores (light infantry) battalions, with a theoretical total of 6982 men. However, in practice, there were other useful units in military outposts used for lookout and general police duties, especially in the industrial district of Barreiro due to the bout of strikes and syndicalist activity that had been ongoing since September . Ever since the previous year the government forces had a plan of action, drawn up by order of the military commander of Lisbon, General Manuel Rafael Gorjão Henriques. When, on the evening of the 3rd, the President of the Council of Ministers Teixeira de Sousa informed him of the imminence of a revolt, a prevention order was soon sent to the garrisons in the city. The units of Artillery 3 and Light Infantry 6 were called from Santarém, while Infantry 15 was called from Tomar. As soon as news of the revolt was received, the plan was put into practice: the 1st Infantry, 2nd Infantry, 2nd Caçadores and 2nd Cavalry regiments and the artillery battery of Queluz, went to the Palace of Necessidades to protect the king, while the 5th Infantry and the 5th Caçadores moved to Rossio Square, with the mission to protect the military headquarters. As for the police force and municipal guards, they were distributed through the city as set out in the plan, intended to protect strategic points such as Rossio Railway Station, the gas factory, the Imprensa Nacional-Casa da Moeda (the Portuguese mint), the postal building, the Carmo barracks, the ammunition depot in Beirolas and the residence of the President of the Council of Ministers, where the government had assembled. Little is known of the Fiscal Guard (a total of 1397 men), only that a few soldiers were with the troops in Rossio. The civil police (total of 1200 men) stayed in the squads. This inaction decreased the effective government forces by approximately 2600 men.David Ferreira, \\"Outubro de 1910, 5 de\\" in Joel Serrão (dir.) Dicionário de História de Portugal. Porto, Livraria Figueirinhas, 1985, vol. IV, pp. 500–504 =The fighting= Rebels of the Carbonária on Rotunda square. The fact that some units of the monarchical side sympathised with the republicans, combined with the abandonment by the rebels of the original plan of action, opting instead for entrenchment in Rotunda and Alcântara, led to a situation of impasse throughout 4 October, with all manner of rumours about victories and defeats spreading through the city. As soon as news of the concentration of rebels in Rotunda were received, the military command of the city organised a detachment to break them up. The column, under the command of Colonel Alfredo Albuquerque, was formed by units that had been removed from the protection of the Palace of Necessidades: 2nd Infantry, 2nd Cavalry and the mobile battery of Queluz. The latter included the colonial war hero Henrique Mitchell de Paiva Couceiro. The column advanced until near the prison, where it assumed combat positions. However, before these were completed, the column was attacked by rebels. The attack was repelled but resulted in a few wounded men, several dead pack animals and the scattering of about half the infantry. Paiva Couceiro responded with cannons and the infantry that remained during 45 minutes, ordering an attack that was carried out by around 30 soldiers, but which was beaten with some casualties. Continuing the gunfire, he ordered a new attack, but only 20 soldiers followed the order. Thinking that he had found the right time to assault the barracks of Artillery 1, Paiva Couceiro requested reinforcement to the division's command. However, he received the perplexing order to retreat. While in transit through Lisboa, the Brazilian president Hermes da Fonseca witnessed the revolution from the (pictured). Meanwhile, a column had been formed with the intention to attack simultaneously the rebels in Rotunda, a plan that was never carried out because of the order to retreat. The column reached Rossio in the evening without having joined combat. This inaction was not caused by the incompetence of its commander, General António Carvalhal, as would become clear the next day, when he was named chief of the Military Division for the republican government: he had changed sides. Reinforcements from other parts of the country, expected by the government throughout 4 October, never arrived. Only the units already mentioned and called for the preventive measures received orders to advance. Since the beginning of the revolution, members of the Carbonária had disconnected the telegraph lines, thus cutting communication with units outside Lisbon. In addition, the rebels had cut off the railway tracks, which meant that even if the troops followed the orders to advance on Lisbon, they would never arrive on time. Reinforcements from the Setúbal peninsula were also unlikely to arrive, since the Tagus river was controlled by rebel ships. Towards the end of the day the situation was difficult for the monarchical forces: the rebel ships were docked beside the Terreiro do Paço Square and the cruiser São Rafael opened fire on the ministries buildings in the bewildered sight of the Brazilian diplomatic corps aboard battleship São Paulo, whose passenger list included the elected president Hermes da Fonseca. This attack undermined the morale of the pro- government forces in Rossio. =The king's departure from Lisbon= King Manuel II of Portugal After the dinner with Hermes da Fonseca, D. Manuel II had returned to the Palace of Necessidades, keeping the company of a few officers. They were playing bridge when the rebels began an attack on the building. The king attempted some phone calls but, finding that the lines had been cut, managed only to inform the Queen Mother, who was in Pena National Palace, about the situation. Soon afterwards, groups of units that were loyal to the king arrived at the scene and managed to defeat the attacks of the revolutionaries. At 9 o'clock the king received a phone call from the president of the Council, advising him to find refuge in Mafra or Sintra, since the rebels were threatening to bomb the Palace of Necessidades. D.Manuel II refused to leave, saying to those present: \\"Go if you want, I'm staying. Since the constitution doesn't appoint me any role other than of letting myself be killed, I will abide by it.\\" With the arrival of the mobile battery from Queluz, the pieces were arranged in the palace gardens so that they could bombard the quarters of the revolutionary sailors, which were located at no more than 100 metres from the palace. However, before they had time to start, the commander of the battery received the order to cancel the bombing and join the forces that were leaving the palace, integrated into the column that would attack the rebel forces of the 1st Artillery in the Rotunda. At around midday the cruisers Adamastor and São Rafael, which had anchored in front of the sailors' quarters, started the bombardment of the Palace of Necessidades, an action which served to demoralise the present monarchical forces. The king took refuge in a small house in the palace's park, where he could ring Teixeira de Sousa, since the revolutionaries had only cut the special state telephone lines and not the general network. The king ordered the prime minister to send the battery from Queluz to the palace to prevent a naval landing, but the prime minister replied that the main action was happening in Rotunda and all the troops that were there were needed. Taking into account that the available troops were not sufficient to defeat the rebels in Rotunda, the prime minister made it obvious to the king that it would be more convenient to retire to Sintra or Mafra so that the stationed forces of the palace could reinforce the troops in Rotunda. At two o'clock the vehicles with D. Manuel II and his advisors set out to Mafra, where the Infantry School would provide enough forces to protect the monarch. While approaching Benfica the king dismissed the municipal guard squad that escorted him so that they could join the fight against the rebels. The escort arrived in Mafra at around four o'clock in the afternoon, but then discovered a problem: due to the holidays, the Infantry School contained only 100 soldiers, as opposed to the 800 that were expected, and the person in charge, Colonel Pinto da Rocha, admitted to not having the means to protect the king. In the meantime, Counsellor João de Azevedo Coutinho arrived and advised the king to call to Mafra the queens D. Amélia and D. Maria Pia (respectively, the king's mother and grandmother), who were in the palaces of Pena and Vila in Sintra, and to prepare to continue on to Porto, where they would organise a resistance. In Lisbon, the king's departure did not bring a large advantage to the government since the majority of the troops now available to engage the rebel forces did not follow the orders to march to Rossio Square to prevent the concentration of rebel artillery in Alcântara. =The triumph of the revolution= Rotunda Square on 5 October 1910. Proclamation of the Portuguese Republic by José Relvas Act of the Proclamation of the Portuguese Republic On the night of 4 October morale was low amongst the monarchical troops stationed in Rossio Square, due to the constant danger of being bombarded by the naval forces and not even Couceiro's batteries, strategically placed there, could bring them comfort. In the headquarters there were discussions about the best position to bomb the Rotunda. At 3am, Paiva Couceiro departed with a mobile battery, escorted by a municipal guard squad, and positioned himself in Castro Guimarães Garden, in Torel, waiting for daybreak. When the forces in Rotunda began to fire on Rossio, revealing their position, Paiva Couceiro opened fire, causing casualties and sowing confusion amongst the rebels. The bombardment continued with advantage towards the monarchical side, but at eight in the morning Paiva Couceiro received orders to stop fighting, as there would be an armistice of an hour. Meanwhile, in Rossio, after Paiva de Couceiro's departure with the battery, the morale of the monarchical troops, which considered themselves helpless, deteriorated even more due to the threats of bombardment by the naval forces. Infantry 5 and some members of Light Infantry 5 insisted that they would not oppose a naval landing. Confronted with this fraternisation with the enemy, the commanders of these formations went to the headquarters, where they were surprised with the news of the armistice. The new German representative, who had arrived two days earlier, had taken rooms in Hotel Avenida Palace, which housed many foreigners. The proximity of the building to the combat zone represented a great danger which prompted the diplomat to intervene. He addressed himself to the General Gorjão Henriques to request a cease-fire that would enable him to evacuate foreign citizens. Without notifying the government, and perhaps hoping to buy time for the arrival of the reinforcements, the general agreed. The German diplomat, accompanied by a man with a white flag, went to the Rotunda to discuss the armistice with the revolutionaries. The latter, however, at the sight of the white flag, mistakenly thought that the king's forces were surrendering, prompting them to join with crowds a celebration of the new republic. In the square, Machado Santos initially refused to accept the armistice, but eventually accepted it after the insistence of the diplomat. Then, seeing the massive popular support for the revolution in the streets, he recklessly went to the headquarters, accompanied by many of the people and several officers who left the position in the Rotunda. The situation in Rossio, with the pouring of the populace onto the streets, was very confusing but advantageous to the republicans, given the obvious public support. Machado Santos spoke to General Gorjão Henriques and invited him to keep the role of division commander, but he refused. António Carvalhal, known to be a republican sympathiser, then received command. Soon afterwards, at 9 o'clock in the morning, the Republic was proclaimed by José Relvas from the balcony of the Lisbon City Hall. A provisional government was then nominated, presided by members of the Portuguese Republican Party, with the mandate to govern the nation until a new constitution was approved. The revolution caused dozens of casualties. The exact number is unknown, but it is recognised that as of 6 October 37 people killed in the revolution were registered in the morgue. Several injured turned up at the hospitals, some of whom later died. For example, out of 78 injured victims checked into Hospital de São José, 14 died in the following days. =The royal family's exile= The Praia dos Pescadores in Ericeira, location of the departure of King Manuel II after 5 October 1910 revolution. In Mafra, on the morning of 5 October, the king was looking for a way to reach Porto, an action that would be very difficult to carry out due to the almost non-existence of an escort and the innumerable revolutionary hubs spread throughout the country. At around midday the President of the Municipal Chamber of Mafra received a message from the new civil governor ordering the switching to a republican flag. Soon afterwards the commander of the Infantry School also received a telegram from his new commander informing him of the current political situation. The position of the royal family was becoming unsustainable. The solution appeared when news arrived that the royal yacht Amélia had anchored nearby, in Ericeira. By 2am the yacht had collected from Cascais Citadel the king's uncle and heir to the throne, D. Afonso, and knowing that the king was in Mafra, had moved to Ericeira, as it was the closest anchorage. D. Manuel II, knowing that with the proclamation of the Republic he would be imprisoned, decided to go to Porto. The royal family and some company departed for Ericeira where, by means of two fishing ships and in the presence of curious civilians, they embarked on the royal yacht. Once on board, the king wrote to the prime minister: After ensuring that the letter would reach its destination, the king announced that he wanted to go to Porto. He met with an advisory council, the officers on board and part of the escort. Amélia's Captain João Agnelo Velez Caldeira Castelo Branco and Chief Officer João Jorge Moreira de Sá opposed the opinion of the monarch, claiming that if Porto turned them away, they would not have enough fuel to reach a different anchorage. Despite the insistence of D. Manuel II, the Chief Officer argued that they carried on board the whole royal family, so his main duty was to protect their lives. In the end, the chosen port was Gibraltar. Once there, the king found out that Porto had also joined the republican cause. D. Manuel sent orders that the ship, being legally the Portuguese State's property, be returned to Lisbon. The deposed king would live out the rest of his life in exile. The first steps of the Republic =Performance of the Provisional Government= Portuguese Provisional Government, 1910 On 6 October 1910, newspaper Diário do Governo announced: \\"To the Portuguese people —Constitution of the Provisional Government of the Republic — Today, 5 October 1910, at eleven o'clock in the morning, was proclaimed the Portuguese Republic in the grand hall of the Palaces of Lisbon Municipality, after the end of the National Revolution movement. The Provisional Government was constituted immediately: Presidency, Dr Joaquim Teófilo Braga. Interior, Dr. António José de Almeida. Justice, Dr. Afonso Costa. Treasury, Basílio Teles. War, António Xavier Correia Barreto. Navy, Amaro Justiniano de Azevedo Gomes. Foreign (Relations), Dr. Bernardino Luís Machado Guimarães. Public Works, Dr. António Luís Gomes.\\"Diário do Governo de 6 de outubro de 1910, cit. in David Ferreira, \\"Governo Provisório Republicano\\" in Dicionário de História de Portugal, direcção de Joel Serrão. Porto, Livraria Figueirinhas, 1985, vol. III, p. 142. By decree on 8 October, the Provisional Government determined the new names of the ministries, with the most important changes being made to the ministries of the Kingdom, Treasure and Public Works, which were renamed ministries of Interior, Finances and Development. However, Basílio Teles refused the position and, on the 12th, it was given to José Relvas.Teófilo Braga, em entrevista ao jornal Dia de 2 de abril de 1913, referiu: \\"Esse sujeito [José Relvas], logo nos primeiros dias da revolução apresentou-se-nos no conselho de ministros e disse: 'Como o Basílio Teles não vem para as finanças, eu queria ficar no lugar dele.' Eu fiquei mesmo parado, a olhar para o Bernardino [Machado], pasmado do impudor. [...] Mas o homem depois tornou-se a impor [...], e ficou ministro das Finanças\\" in Carlos Consiglieri (org). Teófilo Braga e os republicanos. Lisboa, Vega, 1987 On 22 November, Brito Camacho entered government after the departure of António Luís Gomes, appointed Portuguese ambassador in Rio de Janeiro. During its time of power, the Provisional Government took a series of important measures that had long- lasting effects. To calm tempers and make reparations with the victims of the monarchy, a broad amnesty was granted for crimes against the security of the State, against religion, of disobedience, of forbidden weaponry usage, etc. The Catholic Church resented the measures taken by the Provisional Government. Among these were the expulsion of the Society of Jesus and other religious orders of the Regular clergy, the closure of convents, the prohibition of religious teaching in schools, the abolition of the religious oath in civil ceremonies and a secularisation of the State by the separation of Church and State. Divorce was institutionalised, as were the legality of civil marriage, the equality of the marriage rights of men and women, the legal regulation of \\"natural children\\"; the protection of childhood and old age, the reformulation of the Press laws, the elimination of royal and noble ranks and titles and the acknowledgment of right to strike action. The Provisional Government also opted for the dissolution of the then municipal guards of Lisbon and Porto, creating instead a new public body of defence an order, the National Republican Guard. For the colonies, new legislation was created in order to grant autonomy to overseas territories, an essential condition for their development. The national symbols were modified – the flag and the national anthem —, a new monetary unit was adopted – the escudo, equivalent to a thousand réis – and even the Portuguese orthography was simplified and appropriately regulated through the Orthographic Reform of 1911. The Provisional Government enjoyed extensive power until the official launch of the National Constituting Assembly on 19 June 1911, following the election of 28 May of the same year. At that time, the president of the Provisional Government, Teófilo Braga, handed over to the National Constituting Assembly the powers he had received on 5 October 1910. Nevertheless, the Assembly approved with acclaim the proposal presented by their president, Anselmo Braamcamp Freire to the congress: \\"The National Constituting Assembly confirms, until future deliberation, the functions of the Executive Power to the Provisional Government of the Republic\\". Two months later, with the approval of the Political Constitution of the Portuguese Republic and the election of the first constitutional president of the Republic – Manuel de Arriaga – on 24 August, the Provisional Government presented its resignation, which was accepted by the president of the republic on 3 September 1911, marking the end of a government term of more than 10 months and the beginning of the First Portuguese Republic. =Modification of national symbols= With the establishment of the Republic, the national symbols were modified. By a Provisional Government decree dated 15 October 1910, a committee was appointed to design the new symbols. The modification of national symbols, according to historian Nuno Severiano Teixeira, emerged from the difficulty that republicans faced with representing the Republic: The flag Flag of the Portuguese Republic. In relation to the flag, there were two inclinations: one of keeping the blue and white colours, traditional of Portuguese flags, and another of using \\"more republican\\" colours: green and red. The committee's proposal suffered several alterations, with the final design being rectangular, with the first two-fifths closest to the flagpole to be green, and the three remaining fifths, red. Green was chosen because it was considered the \\"colour of hope\\", while red was chosen as a \\"combative, hot, virile\\" colour. The project of the flag was approved by the Provisional Government by vote on 19 November 1910. On 1 December was celebrated the Feast of the Flag in front of the Municipal Chamber of Lisbon. The National Constituting Assembly promulgated the adoption of the flag on 19 June 1911. The national anthem On 19 June 1911 the National Constitutional Assembly proclaimed A Portuguesa as the national anthem, replacing the old anthem Hymno da Carta in use since May 1834, and its status as national symbol was included in the new constitution. A Portuguesa was composed in 1890, with music by Alfredo Keil and lyrics by Henrique Lopes de Mendonça, in response to the 1890 British Ultimatum. Because of its patriotic character, it had been used, with slight modifications, by the rebels of the 1891 uprising in a failed attempt at a coup d'état to establish a republic in Portugal, an event which caused the anthem to be forbidden by the monarchic authorities. Hymno da Carta (1834–1910) File:Hino da Carta.ogg A Portuguesa (1910–present) File:A Portuguesa.ogg The anthem was later modified; the official version used today in national civil and military ceremonies and during visits of foreign heads of state was approved on 4 September 1957. The bust The official bust of the Republic was chosen through a national competition promoted by Lisbon's city council in 1911, in which nine sculptors participated. The winning entry was that of Francisco dos Santos and is currently exposed in the Municipal Chamber. The original piece is found in Casa Pia, an institution from which the sculptor was alumnus. There is another bust that was adopted as the face of the Republic, designed by José Simões de Almeida (sobrinho) in 1908. The original is found in the Municipal Chamber of Figueiró dos Vinhos. The model for this bust was Ilda Pulga, a young shop employee from Chiado. According to journalist António Valdemar, who, when he became president of the National Academy of Art asked the sculptor João Duarte to restore the original bust: The bust shows Republic wearing a Phrygian cap, influence of the French Revolution. Simões' bust was soon adopted by Freemasonry and used in the funerals of Miguel Bombarda and Cândido dos Reis, but when the final contest took place, despite its relative popularity, it was second place to the bust by Francisco dos Santos. =Anticlericalism= Republican leaders adopted a severe and highly controversial policy of anti-clericalism.Wheeler, Douglas L., Republican Portugal:A Political History, 1910–1926, p. 67, Univ of Wisconsin Press, 1998 At home, the policy polarised society and lost the republic potential supporters, and abroad it offended American and European states which had their citizens engaged in religious work there, adding substantially to the republic's bad press.Wheeler, Douglas L., Republican Portugal:A Political History, 1910–1926, p. 68, Univ of Wisconsin Press, 1998 The persecution of the church was so overt and severe that it drove the irreligious and nominally religious to a new religiosity and gained the support of Protestant diplomats such as the British, who, seeing their citizens' religious institutions in a grave dispute over their rights and property, threatened to deny recognition of the young republic.Wheeler, Douglas L., Republican Portugal:A Political History, 1910–1926, p. 70, Univ of Wisconsin Press, 1998 The revolution and the republic which it spawned were essentially anticlerical and had a \\"hostile\\" approach to the issue of church and state separation, like that of the French Revolution, the Spanish Constitution of 1931 and the Mexican Constitution of 1917. Secularism began to be discussed in Portugal back in the 19th century, during the Casino Conferences in 1871, promoted by Antero de Quental. The republican movement associated the Catholic Church with the monarchy, and opposed its influence in Portuguese society. The secularisation of the Republic constituted one of the main actions to be taken in the political agenda of the Portuguese Republican Party and the Freemasonry. Monarchists in a last-ditch effort sought to outflank the republicans by enacting anticlerical measures of their own, even enacting a severe restriction on the Jesuits on the day before the revolution. Soon after the establishment of the Republic, on 8 October 1910, Minister for Justice Afonso Costa reinstated Marquess of Pombal's laws against the Jesuits, and Joaquim António de Aguiar's laws in relation to religious orders. The Church's property and assets were expropriated by the State. The religious oath and other religious elements found in the statutes of the University of Coimbra were abolished, and matriculations into first year of the Theology Faculty were cancelled, as were places in the Canon law course, suppressing the teaching of Christian doctrine. Religious holidays turned into working days, keeping however the Sunday as a resting day for labour reasons. As well as that, the Armed forces were forbidden from participating in religious solemn events. Divorce and family laws were approved which considered marriage as a \\"purely civil contract\\" Bishops were persecuted, expelled or suspended from their activities in the course of the secularisation. All but one were driven from their dioceses.Jedin, Hubert, Gabriel Adriányi, John Dolan, The Church in the Modern Age, p. 612, Continuum International Publishing Group, 1981 the property of clerics was seized by the state, wearing of the cassock was banned, all minor seminaries were closed and all but five major seminaries. A law of 22 February 1918 permitted only two seminaries in the country, but they had not been given their property back. Religious orders were expelled from the country, including 31 orders comprising members in 164 houses (in 1917 some orders were permitted to form again). Religious education was prohibited in both primary and secondary school. In response to the several anticlerical decrees, Portuguese bishops launched a collective pastoral defending the Church's doctrine, but its reading was prohibited by the government. In spite of this, some prelates continued to publicise the text, among which was the bishop of Porto, António Barroso. This resulted in him being called to Lisbon by Afonso Costa, where he was stripped from his ecclesiastic functions. The secularisation peaked with the Law of Separation of the State and the Church on 20 April 1911, with a large acceptance by the revolutionaries. The law was only promulgated by the Assembly in 1914, but its implementation was immediate after the publishing of the decree. The Portuguese Church tried to respond, classifying the law as \\"injustice, oppression, spoliation and mockery\\", but without success. Afonso Costa even predicted the eradication of Catholicism in the space of three generations. The application of the law began on 1 July 1911, with the creation of a \\"Central Commission\\". As one commentator put it, \\"ultimately the Church was to survive the official vendetta against organized religion\\".Gallagher, Tom, Portugal:A Twentieth-Century Interpretation, p. 22, Manchester University Press ND, 1983 On 24 May 1911, Pope Pius X issued the encyclical Iamdudum which condemned the anticlericals for their deprivation of religious civil liberties and the \\"incredible series of excesses and crimes which has been enacted in Portugal for the oppression of the Church.\\"IAMDUDUM: ON THE LAW OF SEPARATION IN PORTUGAL Papal Encyclicals Online =International recognition= Bernardino Machado was Minister of Foreign Affairs in the Provisional government. A major concern of the new republican government was recognition by other nations. In 1910, the vast majority of European states were monarchies. Only France, Switzerland and San Marino were republics. For this reason, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the Provisional Government, Bernardino Machado, directed his agenda exercising extreme prudence, leading him, on 9 October 1910, to communicate to diplomatic representatives in Portugal that the Provisional Government would honour all the international commitments assumed by the previous regime. Since marshal Hermes da Fonseca personally witnessed the full process of transition of the regime, having arrived in Portugal on an official visit when the country was still a monarchy and left when it was a republic, it is not unusual that Brazil was the first country to recognise de jure the new Portuguese political regime. On 22 October the Brazilian government declared that \\"Brazil will do all that is possible for the happiness of the noble Portuguese Nation and its Government, and for the prosperity of the new Republic\\". The next day would be Argentina's turn; on the 29 it was Nicaragua; on the 31, Uruguay; on 16 and 19 November, Guatemala and Costa Rica; Peru and Chile on 5 and 19 November; Venezuela on 23 February 1911; Panama on 17 March. In June 1911 the United States declared support. Less than a month after the revolution, on 10 November 1910, the British government recognised de facto the Portuguese Republic, manifesting \\"the liveliest wish of His Britannic Majesty to maintain friendly relations\\" with Portugal. An identical position was taken by the Spanish, French and Italian governments. However, de jure recognition of the new regime only emerged after the approval of the Constitution and the election of the President of the Republic. The French Republic was the first to do it on 24 August 1911, day of the election of the first president of the Portuguese Republic. Only on 11 September did the United Kingdom recognise the Republic, accompanied by Germany, the Austro-Hungarian Empire, Denmark, Spain, Italy and Sweden. On 12 September, they were followed by Belgium, the Netherlands and Norway; on 13 September, China and Japan; on 15 September, Greece; on 30 September, Russia; on 23 October, Romania; on 23 November, Turkey; on 21 December, Monaco; and on 28 February 1912, Siam. Owing to the tensions created between the young Republic and the Catholic Church, interaction with the Holy See was suspended, and the Holy See did not recognise the Portuguese Republic until 29 June 1919.

The team was founded by Steve Neal and former driver of Vic Lee Motorsport, Ray Bellm when they acquired its assets in 1993 following its owner's conviction for drug trafficking and subsequent liquidation. For the following season, Bellm, having bought a majority stake in the Silverstone-based motorsport equipment retailer, Grand Prix Racewear, also acquired a McLaren F1 GTR and went his own way. As well as racing cars the Team also designs and builds their race cars ensuring a high level of execution and attention to detail. Currently the team operates as a Honda 'Factory' entry in the British Touring Car Championship operating under the 'Halfords Yuasa Racing' name racing two Honda Civic Type Rs. In addition to the British Touring Car Championship, the team also raced two Minis in the Mini Challenge with Matt Neal's sons, William and Henry Neal, as the drivers. In June 2016, it was announced that Rimstock (wheel manufacturing) had been sold to investment company Safanad. Super Touring years =Independent entry (1992–2000)= BMW M3 and 318is (1992–1993) Entered as Rimstock Racing, competing in both a BMW M3 and a 318is, Matt Neal ran his BMW entry as an Independent during the Manufacturer dominated Super Touring period of the BTCC. In 1992, he managed to finish twice in the points, scoring five points for the team. 1993, saw the first success for the team when Neal won the TOCA Challenge for Privateers (Independent Driver's Championship). Ford Mondeo (1995–1997) After a one-year break, the team returned with Matt Neal racing a year-old Ford Mondeo. Despite this, Neal still won the 1995 Total Cup for Privateers and managed to score the team's best finish to date when they finished fourth at Snetterton. 1996 saw a two car line up for Neal and Robb Gravett. Nissan Primera (1997–2000) Team Dynamics started the 1997 season with their tried and tested Mondeo, however a mid season change to a Nissan Primera was needed after two poor seasons. The poor form continued through 1998 until the start of the 1999 British Touring Car Championship season when Neal once again won the Michelin Cup for Independents for the team. The team was also able to take the first ever outright race win for an independent team during the first round's second race at Donington Park. The team went on to score three further outright podium finishes to achieve their best championship position to date, finishing sixth overall. The team's new found form continued into 2000 with another Independent's Championship for Neal with one race win and four podiums pushing the team to fourth in the Touring Teams Championship. Modern years =British Rally Championship= Team Dynamics sponsored British Rally driver Jonny Milner, who won back to back titles in 2002 and 2003 at the wheel of a Dynamics prepared Toyota Corolla. For 2004, Milner switched to a Subaru Impreza again built by the West Midlands-based outfit. =Independent entry (2003–2009)= Vauxhall Astra (2003) A brief spell away from the BTCC was ended when the team entered a Vauxhall Astra Coupé for Gareth Howell during the final four rounds of the 2003 season. Honda Civic Type-R (2004) They entered as Computeach Racing with Halfords in 2004 running two Honda Civic Type-Rs, purchased from the departing Honda works team, for Neal and Dan Eaves, achieving four race wins and several podium positions. Honda Integra Type R (2005–2006) For 2005, under the guise of Team Halfords, they developed a Honda Integra from its basic road-going form, winning the overall drivers title for Matt Neal, making him the first driver to win the overall title with an independent team. Eaves won 4 races for them, and Gareth Howell returned in a 3rd car towards the end of the year to take one win at Silverstone. The team also won both the Teams and Independent Teams championships. Eaves was surprisingly not retained for the 2006 season, the team instead signed Gordon Shedden alongside Neal, who went on to retain his title. The team entered a 3rd Integra at the beginning of the season, although it did not appear until the seventh meeting of the year at Snetterton, once again driven by Gareth Howell. Team Dynamics successfully defended both the Teams and Independent Teams championships. Honda Civic (eighth generation) (2007–2009) In 2007, Matt Neal was again paired with Gordon Shedden. However, they were driving newly developed Honda Civics, required to meet the new Super 2000 regulations all teams must meet to be eligible for championship points. Entering as neither Manufacturer or Independent, the new car scored four wins and several podiums for both drivers, allowing Shedden and Neal to finish third and fourth respectively. The team was unable to defend its title, finishing third overall. For the 2008 season, Neal left the team to drive for the Vauxhall works team, leaving Dynamics in search of a second driver. In November the team confirmed that Tom Chilton would partner Shedden for 2008. Again entering as neither Manufacturer or Independent, the new car scored four wins as it had the previous year. However Shedden was only able to finish seventh with Chilton three places behind him. The team again finished third overall. Halfords withdrew their sponsorship in 2009. After one year with the team Chilton was dropped and replaced by veteran racer David Pinkney. After the opening rounds at Brands Hatch, James Thompson joined Team Dynamics, replacing Shedden. Thompson enjoyed three victories with the team but could not complete the season because of prior commitments in the WTCC and Danish Touring Car Championship. His final races with the team were at Knockhill in August 2009. Having been invited by Team Dynamics to run the Civic at the 2009 Goodwood Festival of Speed and completing a testing session at Rockingham, ex- British Grand Prix winner Johnny Herbert took Thompson's seat for the final rounds of the 2009 season. A mixed season saw the team only manage fifth in the teams championship after only three wins. =Constructor entry (2010–present)= Honda Civic (eighth generation) (2010–2011) For 2010, Team Dynamics were supported by Honda UK and ran under the Honda Racing Team banner, with Matt Neal and Gordon Shedden returning as drivers. A season long battle with Silverline Chevrolet driver Jason Plato saw Dynamics two driver finish runners up, with Neal second and Shedden third. However, the team was able to win both the Manufacturers/Constructors and Teams championships, after scoring ten wins which was more than any other team. Their dominance continued into 2011, as the team fitted its Super 2000 Civic with a NGTC 2.0 litre turbocharged engine. This combination allowed the team's drivers to finish first and second in the drivers championship with 13 wins between them. The team also successfully defended both the Manufacturers/Constructors and Teams championships, giving them a clean sheet over all the silverware. Honda Civic (ninth generation) (2012–) 2012 saw the team move in a new direction, being the first manufacturer team to enter a car built fully to the Next Generation Touring Car specification. Neal and Shedden would again partner each other in the newly named Honda Yuasa Racing Team after a sponsorship deal with Yuasa. After the first four rounds of the season, Shedden leads the team in second place with Neal right behind him. The NGTC Civic, was the first NGTC car to win a BTCC race when it took the race two win at Brands Hatch. At the end of the season the team took all titles they were eligible for, with Shedden winning the drivers' championship for the first time, the team winning the team's championship for the third time in a row and Honda winning the manufacturers' title. The team returned for the 2013 British Touring Car Championship season and retained Shedden and Neal as their drivers.

The outstanding physical feature in the basin, and occupying the centre, is the large Kalahari Desert. The perennial river bifurcation of Selinda Spillway (or Magweggana River), on the Cuando River, connects the Kalahari basin to the Zambezi Basin.Is this Harry and Meghan's honeymoon hotel?. The Telegraph. 29 may 2018. The city Windhoek is situated in the Kalahari Basin. General characteristics of the basin The Okavango River is the chief stream in the basin. It is formed by the confluence of the Cubango and Cuito rivers, which originate on the Bihé Plateau of central Angola and flow southeast. The Cubango is joined just above its confluence with the Cuito by the Omatako River, which flows northeast from its origin in the Damaraland region of central Namibia. The Okavango continues through the Caprivi Strip of Namibia into Botswana, where it splits into a number of distributaries to form the Okavango Delta, a large inland delta that becomes a seasonally flooded grassland. After the Okavango Delta, the waters of the basin enter a zone of strong evaporation, already within the Kalahari desert depression.Kalahari and Okavango Delta. Earth Observatory - Nasa. August 6, 2008. A series of salt pans lie in the lowest points of the basin, including the Nwako Pan south of the Okavango Delta and the vast Makgadikgadi Pan southeast of the Delta. At times of high flow, the Okavango spills into the Nwako Pan via the Xudum and Nhabe distributaries to replenish Lake Ngami, a saline lake, and into Lake Xau and the western end of the Makgadikgadi Pan via the Boteti distributary. The Mopipi Dam was built on the Boteti to provide water to the Orapa diamond mine.Okavango Delta. UNESCO World Heritage Centre. 2019. The Selinda Spillway, also known as the Magweqana, Magwekwana or Magweggana, is a distributary channel that connects the Okavango Delta to the Cuando River, a tributary of the Zambezi. In periods of very high water in the Okavango, the water flows eastward towards the Cuando-Linyanti-System. The last time this happened was in August 2009 after 30 years of falling dry. In times of high water in the Kwando, the water can flow west from the Cuando towards the Okavango Delta, but often evaporates before it reaches the delta.Thomas, David.; Shaw, Paul A.. The Kalahari Environment. Cambridge University Press, Feb 21, 1991 Other streams in the basin include the Eiseb, an intermittent stream that originates in Namibia's Herreroland and flows east into the Okavango Delta, and the Nata River, which originates in western Zimbabwe to flow into the eastern end of the Makgadikgadi Pan. =Ecology= Despite its aridity, the Kalahari Basin supports a variety of fauna and flora on soils known as Kalahari sands. The native flora includes acacia trees, African Rosewood and a large number of herbs and grasses.Martin Leipold, 2008] Some of the areas within the Kalahari are seasonal wetlands, such as the Makgadikgadi Pans of Botswana. This area, for example, supports numerous halophilic species and, in the rainy season tens of thousands of flamingos visit these pans.C. Michael Hogan, 2008 Water resource management The source of the Okavango Delta’s waters in Angola and Namibia remain unaffected by any upstream dams or significant water abstraction and the three riparian states have established a protocol under the Permanent Okavango River Basin Water Commission (OKACOM) for the sustainable management of the entire river system.

URL accessed on November 1, 2009.Gracie Seminars >> Carlson Gracie Bio. URL accessed on November 1, 2009. was a practitioner of Brazilian jiu-jitsu. A member of the Gracie family, he was the eldest son of Carlos Gracie, and nephew to Hélio Gracie, founders of the Gracie jiu-jitsu.  Career  Carlson was an early pioneer in mixed martial arts, founding one the most successful teams of the era, which spawned many champions. In 2000, following a financial dispute, many of Carlson Gracie's students would split from him to form another MMA team, the Brazilian Top Team. The so-called creontes by Carlson Gracie. Carlson fought a total of eighteen vale tudo fights, with only one loss to Luta Livre fighter Euclides Pereira in a fight that was held in Bahia. His first fight was on March 17, 1953 against capoeira practitioner Luiz \\"Cirandinha\\" Aguiar, apprentice of Mestre Sinhozinho. Carlson won by submission due to mounted strikes after a tough fight. His second match was a draw against another capoeirista, Wilson \\"Passarito\\" Oliveira, in May 1953. Carlson had a rematch with Passarito in March 1954 in the longest fight of his career, which he won in the fifth 30 minute round. Most notable are his four matches with Valdemar Santana, who had defeated his uncle Hélio Gracie in a fabled match in May 1955. He beat Santana in the first fight avenging his family. In October 1955 Carlson fought Santana to a draw in a jiu-jitsu match. In 1956 and 1957 Carlson won two fights and in 1959 they fought to a draw. Carlson Gracie trained many top competitors such as Anselmo Montenegro, Cássio Cardoso, Ricardo De La Riva, Allan Goes, Murilo Bustamante, Henrique Nogueira (Chocolate), Mario Sperry, Wallid Ismail, Pablo Popovitch, Vauvenargues \\"Marinho\\" Vicentini, Kevin Christopher, Andre Madiz, Andre Pederneiras, Julio Fernandez, Ricardo Liborio, Marcus Soares, Rodrigo Medeiros, Ricardo \\"Rey\\" Diogo, Marcelo Alonso, Mario Sukata and was also responsible for introducing and mastering Vitor Belfort into Gracie jiu-jitsu. Carlson Gracie also trained Stephan Bonnar, a finalist in the UFC reality show The Ultimate Fighter 1. He was in Bonnar's corner during his fight against eventual The Ultimate Fighter winner Forrest Griffin. He is the author of a book on the subject of Jiu Jitsu titled Brazilian jiu-jitsu: For Experts Only, which includes his student Julio \\"Foca\\" Fernandez. The oldest son of Carlos Gracie, who founded Gracie jiu- jitsu in Rio de Janeiro during the 1920s, Carlson reigned as world champion for thirty years covering the '50s, '60s and '70s. Carlson catapulted to fame at the age of 23 when he avenged the defeat of his uncle Helio Gracie. A former student of Helio's, Waldemar Santana, had defeated the much older Helio during a match in 1955. That match lasted four hours. Carlson's rematch with Santana in 1956 was a much shorter affair: four rounds of vicious vale-tudo combat came to draw. After teaching at his uncle's academy for several years, he opened his own, where over the past thirty years many of the greatest names in jiu-jitsu and Mixed Martial Artists have trained as members of the famed Carlson Gracie Arrebentacao Team. Carlson's influence on no-holds-barred fighting is extensive as well, for the style of jiu-jitsu he taught at his academy was distinct from that being taught by Helio. While Helio's brand of jiu-jitsu emphasized defensive techniques aiming to allow the smaller and weaker to defeat the stronger opponent, Carlson and his brothers Carley Gracie and Rolls Gracie favored a much more active, 'warrior style' of jiu-jitsu that encouraged physical prowess and barraging your opponent with a series of attacks. Death Carlson Gracie died on February 1, 2006, in Chicago, Illinois, of heart failure, apparently the result of complications of kidney stones (and possibly his pre-existing diabetes), following a hospitalization of several days. At the time of his death he was a ninth degree red belt and was referred to as Grandmaster.

Robot calibration is the process of identifying certain parameters in the kinematic structure of an industrial robot, such as the relative position of robot links. Depending on the type of errors modeled, the calibration can be classified in three different ways. Level-1 calibration only models differences between actual and reported joint displacement values, (also known as mastering). Level-2 calibration, also known as kinematic calibration, concerns the entire geometric robot calibration which includes angle offsets and joint lengths. Level-3 calibration, also called a non-kinematic calibration, models errors other than geometric defaults such as stiffness, joint compliance, and friction. Often Level-1 and Level-2 calibration are sufficient for most practical needs. Parametric robot calibration is the process of determining the actual values of kinematic and dynamic parameters of an industrial robot (IR). Kinematic parameters describe the relative position and orientation of links and joints in the robot while the dynamic parameters describe arm and joint masses and internal friction. Non-parametric robot calibration circumvents the parameter identification. Used with serial robots, it is based on the direct compensation of mapped errors in the workspace. Used with parallel robots, non-parametric calibration can be performed by the transformation of the configuration space. Robot calibration can remarkably improve the accuracy of robots programmed offline. A calibrated robot has a higher absolute as well as relative positioning accuracy compared to an uncalibrated one; i.e., the real position of the robot end effector corresponds better to the position calculated from the mathematical model of the robot. Absolute positioning accuracy is particularly relevant in connection with robot exchangeability and off-line programming of precision applications. Besides the calibration of the robot, the calibration of its tools and the workpieces it works with (the so-called cell calibration) can minimize occurring inaccuracies and improve process security. Accuracy criteria and error sources The international standard ISO 9283 sets different performance criteria for industrial robots and suggests test procedures in order to obtain appropriate parameter values. The most important criteria, and also the most commonly used, are pose accuracy (AP) and pose repeatability (RP). Repeatability is particularly important when the robot is moved towards the command positions manually (\\"Teach-In\\"). If the robot program is generated by a 3D simulation (off-line programming), absolute accuracy is vital, too. Both are generally influenced negatively by kinematic factors. Here especially the joint offsets and deviations in lengths and angles between the individual robot links take effect. Measurement systems There exist different possibilities for pose measurement with industrial robots, e.g. touching reference parts, using supersonic distance sensors, laser interferometry, theodolites, calipers or laser triangulation. Furthermore, there are camera systems which can be attached in the robot’s cell or at the IR mounting plate and acquire the pose of a reference object. Measurement and calibration systems are made by such companies as Bluewrist, Dynalog, RoboDK, FARO Technologies, Creaform, Leica, Metris, Metronor, Wiest, Teconsult and Automated Precision,Inc.. Mathematical principles Objective function and optimization problem The robot errors gathered by pose measurements can be minimized by numerical optimization. For kinematic calibration, a complete kinematical model of the geometric structure must be developed, whose parameters can then be calculated by mathematical optimization. The common system behaviour can be described with the vector model function as well as input and output vectors (see figure). The variables k, l, m, n and their derivates describe the dimensions of the single vector spaces. Minimization of the residual error r for identification of the optimal parameter vector p follows from the difference between both output vectors using the Euclidean norm. For solving the kinematical optimization problems least-squares descent methods are convenient, e.g. a modified quasi-Newton method. This procedure supplies corrected kinematical parameters for the measured machine, which then, for example, can be used to update the system variables in the controller to adapt the used robot model to the real kinematics. Results Positioning accuracy of a Tricept robot before and after calibration The positioning accuracy of industrial robots varies by manufacturer, age, and robot type. Using kinematic calibration, these errors can be reduced to less than a millimeter in most cases. An example of this is shown in the figure to the right. Accuracy of 6-axis industrial robots can improved by a factor of 10. Accuracy of parallel robots after calibration can be as low as a tenth of a millimeter. Sample applications In-line measurement cell for car body inspection In the industry, there is a general trend towards substitution of machine tools and special machines by industrial robots for certain manufacturing tasks whose accuracy demands can be fulfilled by calibrated robots. Through simulation and off-line programming, it is possible to easily accomplish complex programming tasks, such as robot machining. However, contrary to the teach programming method, good accuracy as well as repeatability is required. In the figure, a current example is shown: In-line measurement in automotive manufacturing, where the common \\"measurement tunnel\\" used for 100% inspection with many expensive sensors are partly replaced by industrial robots that carry only one sensor each. This way the total costs of a measurement cell can be reduced significantly. The station can also be re-used after a model change by simple re-programming without mechanical adaptations. Further examples for precision applications are robot- guided hemming in car body manufacturing, assembly of mobile phones, drilling, riveting and milling in the aerospace industry, and increasingly in medical applications.

Most of the meetings took place in the vicinity of Bern, Switzerland, and the lead negotiators were Waffen-SS General Karl Wolff and American agent Allen Dulles. The meetings provoked Soviet suspicion that the Americans were seeking to sign a separate peace with the Germans and led to heated correspondence between Joseph Stalin and Franklin Roosevelt, an early episode of the emerging Cold War. Roosevelt denied that there were any negotiations for surrender taking place in Switzerland. Dulles, however, appears to have made a verbal agreement to protect SS General Wolff from prosecution at the Nuremberg Trials as they worked out details of surrender. Although Switzerland was neutral during World War II, the Swiss intelligence officer Max Waibel and the school director Max Husmann arranged for the meetings. Prime Minister Winston Churchill was following the discussion closely, and said he believed that \\"misunderstandings\\" with the Soviets were resolved with Roosevelt's death on 12 April. Churchill referred to the negotiations as Operation Crossword, apparently because he found them puzzling. ch 65 In spite of warnings from other officials that he was violating the Casablanca agreement that called for all dealings with Axis members to be on terms of unconditional surrender, Dulles worked supportively with Wolff, determined to end the war before the communists reached Trieste. President Harry Truman officially closed down talks with the Germans in Switzerland, and made sure that a Russian general was represented at the talks in Caserta, Italy that finalized the surrender of the entire force. Nonetheless, fallout from the incident seems to have discouraged full Soviet participation in the founding United Nations conference later that month. Events On 23 February 1945, Dulles accepted Wolff's offer to explore terms of a local surrender. In an 8 March meeting in Lucerne organized by Swiss intelligence officer Max Waibel, Wolff offered the following plan: Army Group C goes into Germany, while Allied Forces Commander Harold Alexander advances in the direction of the South. On 12 March the U.S. ambassador in the USSR, W. Averell Harriman, notified Vyacheslav Molotov of the possibility of Wolff's arrival in Lugano to conduct negotiations on the German army's surrender in Italy. On the same day, Molotov replied that the Soviet government would not object to talks between American and British officers and the German general, provided that representatives of Soviet Military Command could also take part in them. However, on 16 March the Soviet side was informed that its representatives would not be allowed to take part in negotiations with Wolff in any case. Meanwhile, on 15 and 19 March, Wolff discussed details of how an actual surrender would proceed with American general Lyman Lemnitzer and British general Terence Airey. On 22 March Molotov, in his letter to the American ambassador, wrote that > for two weeks, in Bern, behind the back of the Soviet Union, negotiations > between representatives of the German Military Command on one side and > representatives of American and British Command on the other side are > conducted. The Soviet government considers this absolutely inadmissible.\\" This led to Roosevelt's letter to Stalin on 25 March and Stalin's reply on 29 March. British Aid To Partisans in Northern Italy, April - May 1945. The Western Allies' protection of Karl Wolff threatened to bring them into conflict with the Partisans. Wolff and his forces were being considered to help implement Operation Unthinkable, a secret plan to invade the Soviet Union which Winston Churchill advocated during this period. Wolff was later proven to be complicit in the murder of 300,000 Jews. On 26 April, the SS general was captured by Italian partisans, but was rescued by Dulles' Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and Swiss intelligence. The actual surrender in Italy was signed on 29 April 1945 agreeing to a cessation of hostilities on 2 May. Wolff justified his actions to Berlin officials by explaining that the agreement had pre-empted \\"a Communist uprising\\" in northern Italy. Wolff and his officers were not interned at this time, but instead celebrated the resolution at Gestapo headquarters in Bolzano for several days with Allied commanders. The Americans had to periodically repel partisans who attempted to seize the Germans. Victory in Europe Day occurred on 8 May. Aftermath Operation Sunrise was documented in Seventeen Moments of Spring, a Soviet historical TV series, where it was called \\"Operation Sunrise Crossword\\".  References  * Bradley F.

He came to power after the murder of his father Abdallah II on 27 July 903. He immediately had all his brothers and uncles executed to eliminate any possible rivals. While this massacre secured his position in the short term, the Aghlabid dynasty lost any remaining prestige it had in the eyes of the people. Later Fatimid sources paint Ziyadat Allah in an extremely negative light, claiming that he had orchestrated his father's murder, and depicting him as a decadent and undignified ruler. Among his indulgences include the drinking of alcohol and hiding whoopee cushions (made of inflated animal bladders) for unsuspecting guests to sit on, which amused Ziyadat Allah and his friends to no end. Fatimid sources claim that Ziyadat Allah's shameful and unscrupulous behavior drove his subjects to side with the proto-Fatimid state led by the missionary Abu Abdallah al-Shi'i, whose piety and asceticism is portrayed positively. Abu Abdallah, backed by the Kutama Berber tribe, took advantage of the instability following Ziyadat Allah's accession to capture the city of Sétif in October/November of 904. In 905, an Aghlabid force was sent west, towards Kutama territory, to restore order, but was ambushed and routed by Kutama horsemen a day after leaving Constantine. Another campaign was planned for 906, but in March the Aghlabid troops mutinied in Kairouan, where they released all the prisoners from the city's jails. Abu Abdallah al-Shi'i then went on the offensive again, capturing the cities of Tubna and Bilizma. While Ibn Idhari says that both cities fell at the end of Dhu al-Hijjah in 293 AH, Mohamed Talbi places the date of Bilizma's surrender in the middle of 294 AH, i.e. the spring of 907 CE. By 907, Ziyadat Allah had begun to seriously consider the possibility of a Kutama invasion of central Ifriqiya: he had relocated from Tunis to the palace city of Raqqada (near Kairouan), which he had fortified with a wall made of rammed earth and unbaked clay bricks. In early 907, an Aghlabid force once again marched against Abu Abdallah, following the southern Roman road through the strongly fortified city of Baghaya. This time, however, they made it deep into Kutama territory. The Aghlabid troops, reinforced with Berber volunteers from the Aurès Mountains, destroyed the mountain stronghold of Dar Malul, but when they encountered a band of Kutama cavalry, they panicked and retreated to Baghaya, where they took up a defensive position. With its 1172-meter-long stone walls with 25 towers, built in 539 under Justinian's governor Solomon and still partially standing today, Baghaya was considered practically impenetrable. However, in May or June of 907, some local notables who had secretly aligned themselves with Abu Abdallah opened the city's gates to his forces, and they took the city without a fight. The fall of such an important stronghold as Baghaya unleashed panic at the Aghlabid court in Raqqada. Ziyadat Allah's vizier, Ibn al-Sa'igh, advised fleeing to Egypt, and Ziyadat Allah quickly bought five hundred camels in preparation. However, he soon changed his mind, and had an official proclamation read from every mosque in Aghlabid Ifriqiya — propaganda. This speech downplayed the Aghlabids' losses in battle, saying that Ziyadat Allah would lead an army in person to defeat the \\"corrupters of religion\\". At the same time, a letter circulated, supposedly from the Abbasid caliph al-Muktafi and promising to send aid, while enjoining the people of Ifriqiya to support Ziyadat Allah \\"against the enemies of God\\". At the same time, Ziyadat Allah raised a volunteer army, personally handing out gold pieces to volunteers while seated on his throne under the parade pavilion (qubbat al-arḍ), although many simply left after being paid. Ziyadat Allah, however, did not take command of this army, which mustered at al-Aribus at the end of October 907. That task was left to the prince Ibrahim ibn Abi al- Aghlab, who was ordered to remain in al-Aribus, on the northern Roman road, while Ziyadat Allah headed back to Tunis. They expected Abu Abdallah to approach via this route when they inevitably attacked Kairouan. Abu Abdallah, however, came from the south, capturing several cities in early 908 and forcing the Aghlabids under Ibrahim to march south. The two armies met at Dar Madyan, a place which was probably between Sbeitla and Kasserine, and fought an indecisive battle. Ibrahim returned to al-Aribus, while Abu Abdallah and the Kutama continued eastward, capturing Qastiliya (the region around the Chott el-Djerid) before withdrawing. The decisive final battle took place at al-Aribus on Saturday, 18 March 909. The fighting lasted until the asr prayer (late afternoon), when a unit of 575 Kutama warriors, having circled around the battlefield in a deep streambed, attacked the Aghlabid army in the flank. The Aghlabid army then fled. Its commander, Ibrahim ibn Abi al-Aghlab, headed back towards Kairouan with what remained of his army. The next day, Sunday 19 March, al-Aribus offered an unconditional surrender to the Kutama, who then massacred its inhabitants and looted the city. News of the defeat reached Raqqada that same day. Ziyadat Allah immediately made plans to flee, having clothes, jewels, weapons, furniture, and money loaded onto camels, while a thousand Saqaliba bodyguards hid 1,000 dinars each in their belts in case the camel caravan got attacked. The emir ordered several last-minute executions of important prisoners; he also had the bureau of finances (dīwān al-kharāj) burned down along with all the documents inside. After sundown, Ziyadat Allah fled with many of his courtiers by torchlight for Qalshana, south of Kairouan and the first stop on the road to Egypt. A notable exception was the vizier Ibn al-Sa'igh, who Ziyadat Allah suspected of secretly negotiating with Abu Abdallah; Ibn al-Sa'igh instead departed for Sousse, where he planned to then take a boat to Sicily. In the chaotic departure from Raqqada, a group of servants with 30 camels loaded up with money followed Ibn Sa'igh by mistake; the money ended up being confiscated by Abu Abdallah in Sousse. Ziyadat himself managed to escape to the Near East, but was unable to secure any help from the Abbasids to regain his emirate. He died in 916 in Palestine.

During the Second World War the airfield was occupied by both the Royal Air Force and the United States Army Air Forces. It was given the USAAF designation Station 105. During the Cold War, Chelveston housed some flying units; however, its main role was that of a readiness station to receive USAF units from the United States in case of an emergency. In the mid-1970s, the majority of the airfield was sold by the Ministry of Defence to private landholders, with the exception of a military housing area occupied by U.S. servicemembers assigned to RAF Alconbury and RAF Molesworth. Origins Construction of Chelveston began in 1940 with short grass runways and three hangars grouped together. The airfield opened in August 1941 as a RAF station. It was first used for the Central Gunnery School, then the Airborne Forces Experimental Establishment took over with its gliders. However, the grass landing strips were deemed unsuitable for heavy 4-engine bombers, so concrete runways were constructed along with taxiways and hardstands. The airfield was upgraded to Class A airfield standards before being used by the U.S. Eighth Air Force as a heavy bomber airfield. United States Army Air Forces use Visitors on the control tower at Chelveston, 1944 USAAF Station Units assigned to RAF Chelveston were: * 442d Sub-Depot * 18th Weather Squadron * 2d Station Complement Squadron * 1059th Military Police Company * 1632nd Ordnance Supply & Maintenance Company * 876th Chemical Company (Air Operations) * 2030th Engineer Fire Fighting Platoon * 5th Mobile Training Unit * 309th Medical Dispensary = 60th Troop Carrier Group = In early 1942, Chelveston was turned over to the American Eighth Air Force. The first USAAF unit to occupy Chelveston was the 60th Troop Carrier Group. The 60th consisted of the 10th, 11th, 12th and 26th squadrons, equipped with 53 C-47 aircraft. The 60th arrived in early July, but its stay was brief, moving to RAF Aldermaston at the end of the month. After its training in the UK, the unit moved on to the 12th Air Force for operations in the Mediterranean theater. =301st Bombardment Group (Heavy)= King George VI passes a B-17 Flying Fortress (AAF Serial Number 41-24352) nicknamed \\"Holey Joe\\" as he meets personnel of the 301st Bomb Group during a royal visit to Chelveston on 14 November 1942. On 9 August 1942, the 301st Bombardment Group (Heavy) took up residence on the station. The 301st was assigned to the 1st Combat Wing at Brampton Grange. Its operational squadrons were the 32d, 352d, 353d, 354th and 415th Bomb Squadrons, each equipped with Boeing B-17F Flying Fortresses. The unit was the second heavy USAAF bomber group to arrive in England. It flew its first operational mission on 5 September 1942 to the Rouen marshalling yards in northern France. During its stay at Chelveston, the unit attacked submarine pens, airfields, railroads, bridges, and other targets on the Continent, primarily in France. The 301st BG was allocated to Operation Torch, and on 26 November 1942 it departed for the Twelfth Air Force, being moved to Tafaraoui Airfield, Algeria. =305th Bombardment Group (Heavy)= Emblem of the 305th Bombardment Group The next group to use Chelveston was the 305th Bombardment Group (Heavy), moving in from RAF Grafton Underwood in December 1942. The 305th Bomb Group was one of the most decorated USAAF bomb groups in the European Theater. The 305th BG was assigned to the 40th Combat Wing at RAF Thurleigh. The group tail code was a \\"Triangle G\\". Its operational squadrons (and fuselage codes) were the 364th(WF), 365th (XK), 366th (KY) and 422d (JJ) Bomb Squadrons, each initially equipped with B-17Fs, then upgraded to the B-17G in 1944.

Bomber crew and ground crew of the 305th Bomb Group with their B-17 Flying Fortress after the first daylight raid on Nazi Germany Colonel Curtis LeMay officially congratulates a bomber crew of the 305th Bomb Group in front of their B-17 Flying Fortress. During the winter of 1942/43, the 305th was commanded by Colonel Curtis LeMay and pioneered many of the techniques of daylight bombing used by the USAAF over Nazi-controlled Europe. These fundamental procedures and techniques were later adapted to the Boeing B-29 Superfortress which fought the war to its conclusion in the Pacific. The 305th BG bombed the navy yards at Wilhelmshaven on 27 January 1943 when heavy bombers of Eighth AF made their first penetration into Germany. Through mid–1943, the group attacked strategic targets as submarine pens, docks, harbours, shipyards, motor works, and marshalling yards in France, Germany, and the Low Countries. The 305th BG received the Distinguished Unit Citation for a mission on April 1943 when an industrial target in Paris was bombed with precision in spite of pressing enemy fighter attacks and heavy flak. During the second half of 1943, the unit began deeper penetration into enemy territory to strike heavy industry. Significant objectives included aluminum, magnesium, and nitrate works in Norway, industries in Berlin, oil plants at Merseburg, aircraft factories at Anklam, shipping at Gdynia, and ball-bearing works at Schweinfurt. First Lieutenant William R Lawley Jr and 1st Lt Edward S Michael, pilots in the 364th Bomb Squadron, each received the Medal of Honor for similar performances on 20 February and 11 April 1944, respectively. In each case a B-17 was severely damaged by fighters after it had bombed a target in Germany, crew members were wounded, and the pilot himself was critically injured; recovering in time to pull his aircraft out of a steep dive, and realising that the wounded men would be unable to bail out, each pilot flew his plane back to England and made a successful crash landing. A second Distinguished Unit Citation was awarded to the 305th for withstanding severe opposition to bomb aircraft factories in central Germany on 11 January 1944. The unit participated in the intensive campaign of heavy bombers against the German aircraft industry during Big Week, 20–25 February 1944. In addition to bombardment of strategic targets, the 305th BG often flew tactical interdictory missions and supported infantry units. Prior to the Normandy invasion in June 1944, it helped to neutralize enemy installations such as V-weapon sites, airfields, and repair shops. On D-Day, 6 June, the unit bombed enemy strongholds near the battle area. During the Battle of Normandy the 305th attacked enemy positions in advance of ground forces at Saint-Lô in July 1944 and struck antiaircraft batteries to cover the airborne invasion of the Netherlands in September. The 422nd Bomb Squadron became a specialist unit in the summer of 1943, taking part in experimental night bombing missions with the B-17 and carrying out leaflet dropping sorties in the darkness. In 1944, the squadron extended its activities to pathfinder techniques using the H2X airborne radar. The 305th took part in the Battle of the Bulge, December 1944 − January 1945, by bombing military installations in the battle zone, and supported the airborne assault across the Rhine in March 1945. After V-E Day, the 305th moved to St Trond Airfield, in Belgium in July 1945 and Chelveston was returned to the RAF in October 1945. The 305th Bomb Group became part of the United States Air Forces in Europe, performing occupation duty at Lechfeld Air Base, Germany, December 1945 - 25 December 1946. The group was inactivated in Germany on 25 December 1946. Postwar era In the immediate aftermath of World War II, Chevelston was placed into 'care and maintenance' status by the RAF and became a satellite field for No. 25 Maintenance Unit RAF. 20th Century Fox film crews shot the opening sequence of the film Twelve O'Clock High at Chelveston. In these scenes, an American AAF veteran played by Dean Jagger returns to \\"Archbury\\" (Chelveston), the home station for his bomb group. The airfield is mostly deserted, except for the occasional cow, but the control tower, huts and hangars still remain as ruined yet evocative reminders of what was once his home away from home.  United States Air Force use With the Korean War and the growing threat of the Soviet Union, the US and UK agreed to an expanded US military presence in the United Kingdom. On 1 December 1952, Chelveston returned to American control. =Strategic Air Command= In 1952 RAF Chelveston was allocated to the United States Air Force. The USAF planned to use Chelveston as an advanced \\"Reflex\\" base for forward deployment of the new Boeing B-47 Stratojet medium range nuclear bomber. Strategic Air Command wanted to disperse its nuclear bomber force and have about half of its B-47s stationed at forward bases in Western Europe and North Africa. Because the borders of the Soviet Union and Warsaw Pact controlled areas were within the range of the B-47, the \\"Reflex\\" deployments would base the bombers for 90-day rotations of crews and aircraft.bruntingthorpe.com history United States Air Forces in Europe (USAFE), however, managed the initial reconstruction of the airfield, through the 7503d Air Services Wing.AFHRA Document 00462847 WING/7503/AIR SUPPORT The base was reconstructed, and a completely new jet runway (11,000') was constructed on the airfield to accommodate intercontinental bombers. Wartime buildings in disrepair were replaced with new facilities. Starting in November 1955 Chelveston was transferred to the SAC 7530th Air Base Squadron, 7th Air Division as a standby facility.AFHRA Document 00411998 7523d Air Base Squadron The Boeing B-47 Stratojet was a familiar sight at Chelveston as wings deployed on 90-day rotations. Two of the SAC B-47 Wings which deployed to Chelveston were the 301st Bombardment Wing from Lockbourne AFB, Ohio, and the 305th Bombardment Wing from MacDill Air Force Base, Florida, direct descendants of the two World War II B-17 Bombardment groups assigned to the airfield. In 1958 the church of St James in Thrapston received the pews which had previously been installed in the Chelveston chapel. =United States Air Forces in Europe= Emblem of the 42d Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron 1960 photo of Douglas RB-66C-DT Destroyer, AF Serial No. 54-470 of the 42d TRS/10th TRW at RAF Chelveston. This aircraft was used during the Vietnam War and was eventually scrapped at Kadena AB, Okinawa in 1973. Following French President General de Gaulle's requirement for all foreign nuclear forces to leave France, there was a major readjustment of USAF deployments in Western Europe, and the B-47 deployments ended. On 1 September 1959, jurisdiction of Chelveston was transferred from SAC to USAFE. Control of the base was assigned to the 10th Tactical Reconnaissance Wing at RAF Alconbury, which had been moved from West Germany to England. The 10th TRW could not accommodate all four squadrons of the wing at Alconbury, so one was based at Chelveston, which became its satellite. The mission was changed to support Douglas RB-66C Destroyer Reconnaissance aircraft of the 42d Tactical Reconnaissance Squadron. The first B-66s arrived at the base on 26 August and by mid-18 September all were present. The squadron's activities consisted of specialized electronic reconnaissance and electronic countermeasures. The 42nd TRS remained at Chelveston for almost three years until the summer of 1962. At that time, it was decided to forward deploy the squadron to the then-unused Toul-Rosières Air Base, France. After the B-66s departed the base was returned to reserve status. The RAF used Chelveston for Civil Defence exercises. Mostly though, the station was maintained by a small RAF skeleton support staff. In August 1968, the station was put on alert during the Czechoslovakian Crisis, but no units were deployed there. U.S. servicemen were encouraged and assisted to pursue hobbies and use the station workshops. Chelveston and Alconbury servicemen often built and raced stock-cars, and especially in the 1960s were famous around English race tracks for their building and racing skills and for their access to American-built V-8 engines.  Draw-down and closure  In the early 1970s due to budget cutbacks, the MOD decided to close Chelveston. The concrete runways, taxiways and hardstands were broken up and removed in 1977, with large quantities of aggregate being supplied to various construction projects in the Northamptonshire and Bedfordshire markets. The ground station , with large numbers of nissen huts and other building erected during World War II and during the 1950s were also all demolished, including the removal of streets and other infrastructure. Although unused since the early 1960s, most of these structures were in relatively good condition at the time of their removal. Other parts of the base were sold to private agricultural interests, with the exception of some housing units retained by the USAF for families of personnel assigned to RAF Molesworth and a small school. These homes may have been sold by the MOD in recent years, due to the reduced number of American military personnel in the areas. The large J-Type hangar was retained by the 10th TRW at RAF Alconbury for storage of War Reserve Material (WRM) assets until the late 1980s. It was demolished after the closure of the Alconbury flightline. An RAF high frequency signals facility was established on the former airfield site in 1977, operated by RAF No. 81 Signals Unit and with a large array of antennas (part of UK STCICS). The site incorporated a microwave relay mast linking the site with the MOD in London and RAF Strike Command in High Wycombe. One mast was of 600W power that transmitted RAF VOLMET on 5.450 MHz USB and 11.253 MHz USB. The station closed in December 2003 when the RAF's high frequency communications system was replaced by the Defence High Frequency Communications Service.  Post military use  2005 sign offering the remainder of RAF Chelveston for saleIn late 2005, RAF Chelveston were sold by Defence Estates to a businessman who is in the process of developing it into Chelveston Renewable Energy Park. In May 2007 a new memorial to the men that served at the RAF station during the Second World War was unveiled in their memory by some of their comrades. Almost nothing of the former airfield remains, although some evidence of the wartime airfield can still be seen in aerial imagery. * The imprint of the 11,000' postwar jet runway (03/21), is clearly visible in aerial imagery. Numerous small pieces of concrete in the grass can also be seen along the outlines of the former SAC runway. The World War II runways, taxiways, hardstands and perimeter track, much of which was abandoned but still in existence during Chelveston's postwar use by SAC and USAFE were also completely removed and no evidence of them can be seen. The 1977 removal of these facilities was very complete and thorough. The postwar SAC taxiway was reduced from 100' wide to approximately 20 ft to create an access road for the RAF signals facility. The EOR taxiway turnoff on the 03 runway end can still be seen as an imprint in the grass. * The foundation of the J-type hangar, used by RAF Alconbury for storage can be seen. A large pile of rubble is piled in the southeast corner and what the concrete foundation and remaining taxiway ends of concrete have various objects being piled on them. * One of the foundations of a former T.2 hangar is also visible, just to the southwest being an intact wartime building along the access road. * The foundation of the wartime control tower can be seen as a disturbance on the grass at * Remains of the bomb dump are at * A wartime building is intact at ; additional foundations are just to the southwest of the USAF housing area at See also *List of former Royal Air Force stations *Yielden References =Citations= =Bibliography= * Freeman, Roger A.

Intrapreneurship is known as the practice of a corporate management style that integrates risk-taking and innovation approaches, as well as the reward and motivational techniques, that are more traditionally thought of as being the province of entrepreneurship. Definition Pinchot (1985) defined intrapreneurs as \\"dreamers who do. Those who take responsibility for creating an innovation of any kind within an organization.\\"Pinchot, G. 1984. Who is the Intrapreneur? In: Intrapreneuring: Why You Don't Have to Leave the Corporation to Become an Entrepreneur. New York: Harper & Row. pp. 28 – 48 In 1992, The American Heritage Dictionary acknowledged the popular use of a new word, intrapreneur, to mean \\"A person within a large corporation who takes direct responsibility for turning an idea into a profitable finished product through assertive risk-taking and innovation\\".https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=intrapreneur&submit.x;=38&submit.y;=27 Dictionary.com defines an intrapreneur as \\"an employee of a large corporation who is given freedom and financial support to create new products, services, systems, etc., and does not have to follow the corporation's usual routines or protocols.\\" Koch (2014) goes further, claiming that intrapreneurs are the \\"secret weapon\\" of the business world.Koch, C., 2014. Rise of the intrapreneur. Director Magazine. Available at: http://www.director.co.uk/the- rise-of-the-intrapreneur-expert-1-april-2014/ [Accessed April 9, 2015]. Based on these definitions, being an intrapreneur is considered to be beneficial for both intrapreneurs and large organizations. Companies support intrapreneurs with finance and access to corporate resources, while intrapreneurs create innovation for companies.Pinchot, G. 1984. Who is the Intrapreneur? In: Intrapreneuring: Why You Don't Have to Leave the Corporation to Become an Entrepreneur. New York: Harper & Row. pp. 28 – 48 The intrapreneur is not to be confused with the \\"innerpreneur\\", a person who aims at personal fulfilment more than at economic gains when creating a business. For innerpreneurs the primary motivation is the need to implement their vision of something the world needs, something that aligns with their values. History The first written use of the terms ‘intrapreneur’, ‘intrapreneuring,’ and ‘intrapreneurship’ date from a 1978 white paper, Intra-Corporate Entrepreneurship, by Gifford Pinchot III and Elizabeth S. Pinchot.Pinchot, Gifford & Pinchot, Elizabeth (Fall 1978) Intra-Corporate Entrepreneurship Tarrytown School for Entrepreneurs Later Norman Macrae, who read the white paper, credited the term to Gifford Pinchot III in the April 17, 1982 issue of The Economist.Macrae, Norman (April 17, 1982) Intrapreneurial Now The Economist The first formal academic case study of corporate entrepreneurship or intrapreneurship was published in June 1982, as a Master's in Management thesis, by Howard Edward Haller, on the intrapreneurial creation of PR1ME Leasing within PR1ME Computer Inc. (from 1977 to 1981). This academic research was later published as a case study by VDM Verlag as Intrapreneurship Success: A Prime Example. The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language included the term 'intrapreneur' in its 3rd 1992 Edition,Intrapreneur The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language. 3rd ed. Boston: Houghton with Pinchot as the originator of the concept. The term \\"intrapreneurship\\" was used in the popular media first in February 1985 by TIME magazine article \\"Here Come the Intrapreneurs\\" and then the same year in another major popular publication was in a quote by Steve Jobs, Apple Computer's Chairman, in an interview in the September 1985 Newsweek article,? (September 30, 1985) [Jobs talks about his Rise and Fall] Newsweek Magazine which quotes him as saying, \\"The Macintosh team was what is commonly known as intrapreneurship; only a few years before the term was coined -- a group of people going, in essence, back to the garage, but in a large company.\\" Employee intrapreneur \\"Intrapreneurship refers to employee initiatives in organizations to undertake something new, without being asked to do so.\\" Intrapreneurship Conceptualizing entrepreneurial employee behaviour. http://www.entrepreneurship-sme.eu/pdf- ez/H200802.pdf Hence, the intrapreneur focuses on innovation and creativity, and transforms an idea into a profitable venture, while operating within the organizational environment. Thus, intrapreneurs are Inside entrepreneurs who follow the goal of the organization. Intrapreneurship is an example of motivation through job design, either formally or informally. (See also Corporate Social Entrepreneurship: intrapreneurship within the firm which is driven to produce social capital in addition to economic capital.) Employees, such as marketing executivesKotler, P., Marketing Management: Analysis, Planning and Control, 13th edition, Prentice-Hall, Englewood Cliffs, N.J. 2009. or perhaps those engaged in a special project within a larger firm, are encouraged to behave as entrepreneurs, even though they have the resources, capabilities and security of the larger firm to draw upon. Capturing a little of the dynamic nature of entrepreneurial management (trying things until successful, learning from failures, attempting to conserve resources, etc.) adds to the potential of an otherwise static organization, without exposing those employees to the risks or accountability normally associated with entrepreneurial failure. Another characteristic of intrapreneurs is their courage and flexibility to think outside of the box, which allows them to work on ideas that may change strategic direction. Even though many managers are afraid of radical changes, they are often the only way to help companies grow. This is exemplified by Wipro in India, a small vegetable company that ended up being a software outsourcing powerhouse. Another example is Tony Hsieh of Zappos, who started as a commercial footwear vendor and became the CEO of Zappos, which has expanded into an online customer experience company. According to Pinchot,Pinchot, G. 1984. Who is the Intrapreneur? In: Intrapreneuring: Why You Don't Have to Leave the Corporation to Become an Entrepreneur. New York: Harper & Row. pp. 28 – 48. intrapreneurs are both employees and leaders of a large organizations that act similar to entrepreneurs in terms of e.g. self-motivation, creativity and pro-activity. Pinchot claims that while intrapreneurs must be leaders, they differ very much from managers. Strong leadership skills are needed to strengthen teams and to persuade others to follow and execute their ideas. Leadership skills are also important to support rapid decision making under uncertainty. Managers, on the contrary, consider more risks than uncertainty and often work within established patterns. Moreover, traditional managers get their authority from the above; intrapreneurs, by contrast, start without the recognition of the same degree of power. Intrapreneurs are able to search for opportunities and shape them into high-potential innovations through teamwork and with access to corporate resources. This assumes the right conditions of good leadership, communication and the appropriate environment to support creativity, these are essential for entrepreneurial outcomes to take place (Timmons and Spinelli, 2003). The win-win situation of intrapreneurial motivation leading to corporate benefits are considered idealistic by some. According to Smedley (2013), only a few companies know how to encourage intrapreneurs. Some examples are listed below.  Examples  One of the most well-known examples of intrapreneurship is the \\"Skunk Works\\" group at Lockheed Martin. The group was originally named after a reference in a cartoon, and was first brought together in 1943 to build the P-80 fighter jet. Because the project was to eventually become a part of the war effort, the project was internally protected and secretive. Kelly Johnson, later famous for Kelly's 14 rules of intrapreneurship,http://www.jamesshuggins.com/h/u-2a/u-2_kellys_rules.htm was the director of this group. Another example could be 3M, who encourage many projects within the company. They give certain freedom to employees to create their own projects, and they even give them funds to use for these projects. (In the days of its founders, HP used to have similar policies and just such an innovation-friendly atmosphere and intrapreneurial reputation.) Besides 3M, Intel also has a tradition of implementing intrapreneurship. Google is also known to be intrapreneur friendly, allowing their employees to spend up to 20% of their time to pursue projects of their choice. Other companies such as Xerox, Virgin, Siemens and Microsoft are also looking for unique solutions to promote Corporate Entrepreneuship, CE, in their own businesses, e.g. by developing separate research and development departments. Siemens-Nixdorf took a different approach, designing a 2-year corporate program to turn 300 managers into intrapreneurs, skilled in spotting new business opportunities with notable potential.Altringer, B., 2013. A New Model for Innovation in Big Companies. Harvard Business Review. Available at: https://hbr.org/2013/11/a-new-model-for-innovation-in-big-companies/ [Accessed March 1, 2015]. Kanter and Richardson's (1991) case study research \\"Engines of Progress\\" describes how Ohio-Bell encouraged intrapreneurial behaviour through the development of a system of innovation called \\"Enter-Prize\\". Ostensibly, the program was about generating innovation but the design was cultural rather than financial. CISCO lead an Innovation Everywhere Challenge to build a corporate culture of Innovation in 2016. They offered $50,000 cash ($25,000 Seed, $25,000 Reward) and 3 Months paid time off to the winners. The three ideas presented included virtual reality videoconferencing, disability hiring programs, and digital media productivity suite.https://newsroom.cisco.com/documents/10157/14740/790057-WhitePaper-060816-FINAL.pdf  Challenges  The biggest challenge for intrapreneurs is dealing with the \\"Corporate Immune System\\".Pinchot, G. 1984. Who is the Intrapreneur? In: Intrapreneuring: Why You Don't Have to Leave the Corporation to Become an Entrepreneur. New York: Harper & Row. pp. 28 – 48. This expression means that corporate organizational structures such as bureaucracy, hierarchy, rules etc. do not support intrapreneurial culture and behaviour. Many companies struggle with applying the concept of intrapreneurship into their daily routines due to high levels of defined tasks and schedules that deter opportunities for serendipity and for new ideas to be recognised.Schleisinger, L. & Kiefer, C. (2014). Act Like An Entrepreneur Inside Your Organization. Harvard Business Review. [online]. 14 July 2014. Available at: https://hbr.org/2014/07/act- like-an-entrepreneur-inside-your-organization. Accessed 25 February 2015 Issues around a highly defined schedule and lack of necessary time and space for idea creation are also highlighted in an article by Sushain Pandit (2015).3 Tenets of Intrapreneur’s Theory of Creativity: https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/3-tenets-intrapreneurs-theory-creativity- sushain-pandit. Accessed 26 December 2015 Kawasaki (2006) also highlights the lack of rewards for entrepreneurial behaviour as a demotivating factor to search for new ideas.Kawasaki, G. (2006). How to Change the World: The Art of Intrapreneurship. [online] Available at: https://guykawasaki.com/the_art_of_intr/. Accessed 13 February 2017. Failure, or fear of failure, is another reason for organisations not becoming more entrepreneurial. Wladawsky-Berger (2010) found that firms act to protect resources by avoiding risk and penalizing failure.Wladawsky-Berger, I. (2010). Entrepreneurship and Innovation in Large Companies. [online]. Available at: in http://blog.irvingwb.com/blog/2010/10/entrepreneurship-andinnovation-in-large- companies.html. Accessed 25 February 2015. This resonates with the framework proposed by Ahuja and Lampert (2001) that explains why companies fail to develop breakthrough inventions.Ahuja, G. & Lampert, C.M. 2001. Entrepreneurship in the large corporation: A longitudinal study of how established firms create breakthrough inventions. Strategic Management Journal, 22, pp.521–543. According to the framework, there is a tendency in large firms to favour familiar and mature technologies, and also search for new ideas that are similar to existing solutions. The authors propose investing in developing novel and emerging technologies, because this will increase the likelihood of breakthrough inventions. However their model lacks how to build upon the ideas. On the contrary, Ireland et al. (2009) present a model that conceptualises the CE strategy. Their model considers three main elements: entrepreneurial vision, organisational structure and behaviour, all of which influence and complement each other.Ireland, R.D., Covin, J.G. & Kuratko, D.F. 2009. Conceptualizing Corporate Entrepreneurship Strategy. Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 33 (1), pp.19–46. The authors claim that these factors have to be adapted at three levels: at the organisational level, at the level of top-managers and at the level of other employees. It means that an effective CE strategy cannot be dictated by top-managers, only instigated by them. In doing so, they have to create CE strategy from interactions between entrepreneurial vision, pro-entrepreneurial architecture and entrepreneurial behaviour. Jones and Butler (1992) stated that due to organisational size, age and complex functions, entrepreneurship and management are often separated.Johnson, L. (2010). Risk-takers rarely fit corporate culture. Financial Times. [online]. 1 June 2010. Available at: http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/2909d95a-6daa-11df-b5c900144feabdc0.html#axzz3RC9D0wdi. Accessed 8 February 2015. Their different levels of tolerance for risks (i.e. managers tend to avoid risks, while entrepreneurs work under uncertain conditions) generally result in managers penalizing failure. In addition, the lack of rewards and bureaucracy lead to outside entrepreneurship. Consequently, intrapreneurs often quit their jobs and set up their own businesses.Clarke, C. (2013). Masters in Management: Seeds of innovation. Financial Times. [online]. 15 September 2013. Available at: http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/619ad1dc124f-11e3-8336-00144feabdc0.html#axzz3R4XmBRmy. Accessed 8 February 2015 Behrens and Patzelt (2015) claims that this could be prevented by choosing managers with failure experience in their previous positions.Behrens, J. & Patzelt, H. 2015. Corporate Entrepreneurship Managers’ Project Terminations: Integrating Portfolio-Level, Individual-Level, and Firm- Level Effects. Entrepreneurship Theory and Practice, 12, pp. 1-28. Smedley (2013) also suggests that creating structure for new ideas depends on managers personal experience and attitude. He gives an example of SAP, a company who claims to celebrate failure.Smedley, T. (2013). Intrapreneurs’ come to the rescue. Financial Times. [online]. 13 March 2014.

However, Sinha & Srivastava Sinha, N. & Srivastava, K.B.L., 2013. Association of Personality, Work Values and Socio-cultural Factors with Intrapreneurial Orientation. Journal of Entrepreneurship, 22(1), pp.97–113 may have a solution. Sinha & Srivastava's Sinha, N. & Srivastava, K.B.L., 2013. Association of Personality, Work Values and Socio-cultural Factors with Intrapreneurial Orientation. Journal of Entrepreneurship, 22(1), pp.97–113 study evaluates personality factors such as extroversion; work values such as the need for intellectual stimulation and creativity; and, socio-cultural factors such as individualism and power distance and the relationship between these factors and an organisation's Intrapreneurial Orientation (the extent to which employees act in an entrepreneurial manner within their place of employment). The results of the study indicate a strong association between these personality factors and an organisation's Intrapreneurial Orientation. In practical terms, this implies that organisations can influence their Intrapreneurial Orientation through selection at recruitment and through ongoing training and development.  Why is Intrapreneurship a contemporary issue and how do practitioners apply the knowledge?  Intrapreneurship is a contemporary issue with pressing relevance for corporate managers. Antoncic and HisrichAntoncic, B. & Hisrich, R.D., 2001. Construct Refinement and Cross- Cultural. Journal of Business Venturing, 16(99), pp.495–527. conclude that intrapreneurship has a positive impact on organisational growth and profitability. Organisations that build structures and embed values to support intrapreneurship are consequently more likely to have a high Intrapreneurial Orientation and are more likely to grow than organisations with a low Intrapreneurial Orientation. Intrapreneurial organisations are more innovative, they continually renew and this proactive approach leads to new business venturing. Their findings indicate that intrapreneurship could be particularly beneficial for transition economies. Antoncic & HisrichAntoncic, B. & Hisrich, R.D., 2001. Construct Refinement and Cross-Cultural. Journal of Business Venturing, 16(99), pp.495–527. find that good quality open communications together with a formal structure and supported by environmental scanning and management support will help an organisation become more intrapreneurial.

In general, the academic approach to intrapreneurship is predominantly based on the company wide re-organisation required to foster intrapreneurship.(Kanter & Richardson, 1991; Thornberry, 2003) By contrast, the corporate view is often that innovation is the means, rather than the end. This is described in Capozzi et al.Capozzi, M.M., Gregg, B. & Howe, A., 2010. Innovation and commercialization, 2010. McKinsey & Company website. Available at: http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/innovation/innovation_and_commercial ization_2010_mckinsey_global_survey_results [Accessed March 2, 2015]. where the driver for innovation is identified as the strategic need to grow the core business. Thus, there is often a difference in the vocabulary used with academics preferring intrapreneurship and practitioners talking of innovation.Anthony, S., Duncan, D. & Siren, P.M.A., 2014.

The Minimum Viable Innovation System (MVIS) is an attempt to take the essence of academic models and demonstrate how organisations can implement a MVIS within 90 days  How to develop Intrapreneurs?  As collaboration increases, the capability to collaborate leads finally to organizational learning as part of non-routine work processes. Many firms not only empower managers but also enable employees to become more innovative and flexible even in the course of their daily activities and routine tasks. Through empowerment, employees become owners of their tasks. Described on a larger picture is the concept of identity building. In other words, employees require opportunities to make informed choices. They must accept personal responsibility for their actions and their consequences as traditional entrepreneurs across markets would do. For creating sustained value through building intrapreneurship into the organization, a strong management commitment is essential. The management of the firm is eventually responsible for providing the conditions that facilitate individual intrapreneurial attitude with the aim of opening the employee's minds (see also culture of open innovation).Fasnacht, D. 2009. Developing Intrapreneurs In: Open Innovation in the Financial Services. Hamburg: Springer. pp. 163-168. Many, including George Kliavkoff (President MGM), believe a strong culture of intrapreneurs comes from three key concepts being: an executive mandate, a creative structure, and patient capital. Executive mandate means that you have top-down support for innovation within the organization.

The painting is dated 1838 and is housed at Emory & Henry College in Emory, VA. John Emory (April 11, 1789 – 1835) was an American bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church, elected in 1832. He is the namesake for Emory University and Emory & Henry College, both Methodist- affiliated American universities. Early life and family John was born at Spaniard's Neck, Queen Anne's County, Maryland. His parents were Methodists, his father a jurist who designed him for the law. His mother, however, who had been converted under Garrettson, devoted John at birth to the ministry. His eldest son Robert, born in 1814, became a professor of Latin and Greek at Dickinson College in 1836 and later its president. In 1841 he published a biography of his father, Life of the Rev. John Emory. He was educated by tutors at Easton and Lancaster, Pennsylvania, and in Washington College, Chestertown, Maryland. He experienced \\"saving grace\\" at a Quarterly Meeting in 1806. He studied law in 1805 in the office of Judge R.T. Earle, Centreville, Maryland, and was admitted to the bar in 1808. But his attention soon turned to the pulpit, against his father's protests, and he entered the Traveling Ministry of the Philadelphia Annual Conference of the M.E. Church in 1810. Ministry Emory became well known, and his services were much in demand throughout the Middle States. He was elected a Member of the General Conference of 1816, and then to each succeeding General Conference (with one exception) through 1832 (when he was elected to the Episcopacy). He was sent as a delegate to the British Wesleyan Conference in 1820. He was appointed Book Agent and Editor for the M.E. Church in 1824, with offices in New York City. While a bishop, he continued his interest in the Book Concern, and during his management thereof was successful in paying-off all its debts, returning it to a solid foundation. He was especially active in promoting the improvement of the literature of the M. E. Church. For example, he founded the \\"Methodist Quarterly Review,\\" nearly all the original articles in the first two volumes being from his own pen. He was prominent in the founding of the New York University and of Wesleyan University, and was one of the principal organizers of Dickinson College as a Methodist school. He was an able debater. In 1817 in a pamphlet controversy, he used his literary weapons, not unsuccessfully, against Bishop White of the Protestant Episcopal Church. In the controversy of 1828 which led to the founding of the Methodist Protestant Church he was the chief defender of existing M.E. polity. He was of a logical turn of mind, and had command of a pure, clear, and vigorous style. As a Bishop he was largely influential in giving the Methodist Episcopal Book of Discipline its present form. College and university namesakes Bishop Emory died in an 1835 carriage accident near his Maryland home. The next year, Methodists chartered both Emory College (later University) at Oxford, Georgia and Emory & Henry College in southwestern Virginia. (The co-eponym for the latter is Patrick Henry.) Both maintain their Methodist associations. Bishop Emory is buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Baltimore near the graves of Bishops Francis Asbury and Beverly Waugh. Emory United Methodist Church in New Oxford, PA, erected in 1887, was named for him after he helped to establish the Emory Sunday School during the church's early years - between 1832 and 1835.

According to doctrine of the Latter Day Saint movement, the plan of salvation (also known as the plan of happiness and the plan of redemption) is a plan that God created to save, redeem, and exalt humankind, through the atonement of Jesus Christ. The elements of this plan are drawn from various sources, including the Bible,See for example , ,, , , , , , , , and Book of Mormon, Doctrine & Covenants, Pearl of Great Price, and numerous statements made by the leadership of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). The first appearance of the graphical representation of the plan of salvation is in the 1952 missionary manual entitled A Systematic Program for Teaching the Gospel.https://rsc.byu.edu/archived/go-ye-all-world/missionary- training-and-practices/5-missionary-materials-and-methods#_edn69  Summary  =Pre-mortal existence= In the 1840s, Joseph Smith stated that the human spirit existed with God before the creation of Earth. Thus, Latter-day Saints believe in a pre-mortal existence, in which people are literally the spirit children of God, though Smith is explicitly quoted in the King Follett Sermon as saying that \\"God never had the power to create the spirit of man.\\" Latter- day Saints often point to Jeremiah 1:5 as one example of evidence in the Bible for a pre-earth existence.In this section Jeremiah the prophet is told that the Lord knew him before He formed him in the belly and before he came out of the womb and was sanctified and ordained to be a prophet at that time. This teaching is primarily based, however, upon revealed doctrine by Smith and his successors to the presidency of the church. Prior to the existence of spirits, some element of the human spirit, called intelligence, existed eternally in the same sense that God existed eternally, but in a less progressed form of energy or matter. This may explain the church's teaching that man and God are co-eternal (carefully distinguishing \\"co-eternal\\" from \\"equal\\", which is not a part of Mormon doctrine). Within Latter-day beliefs, Jesus Christ is looked upon as the creator of the Earth under God the Father's direction, while God the Father is the creator of all men, women, and creatures of the Earth. During this pre-mortal existence, God the Father presented the following plan to His children: Human beings would be born on Earth. There they would receive a physical body necessary to exaltation and a fullness of joy. On earth, they would be tested through trials of their faith, and be subject to mortality. A \\"veil\\" would be set in place to obscure humankind's memory of its divine origins, thus allowing for \\"walking by faith\\" and for greater freedom of choice by enabling individuals to make their own decisions. Latter-day Saints believe that only those who live good lives, prove themselves obedient to Heavenly Father's commandments, receive the ordinances of salvation, and repent of their sins will be able to return to Heavenly Father's presence (The Celestial Kingdom). However, because each person's experience in mortality is unique, every individual will be judged in accordance with the opportunities, knowledge, and blessings they had while living on Earth. Integral to this plan was freedom of choice, which God the Father considered an inviolable right of all his children; every individual would have opportunities to make certain choices that would determine the course of their life on Earth and in the hereafter. No human would ever have their freedom taken away in an attempt to force righteous behavior. People would be free to do evil and good, both to themselves and to those around them. Because such freedom would make it possible for God the Father's children to break commandments and sin, a Savior would be needed to offer them freedom from the just consequences of their sins and allow them to repent: this figure would have to overcome both sin and death, making it possible for obedient and repentant individuals to return to Heavenly Father's presence through a plan of mercy. The pre-mortal Jesus Christ, then known as Jehovah, volunteered to be this Savior, agreeing to take upon himself infinite suffering for every sin, mistake, and all pain and suffering ever to be experienced throughout all time by all of God's children. He also agreed to die and be resurrected, thus making it possible for all individuals (obedient or not) to be resurrected. The Holy Spirit would be sent to encourage righteous behavior and guide human beings towards Jesus Christ and Heavenly Father, but would never interfere with freedom. Also part of the plan was a foreordination of prophets and teachers who would have gifts and callings among men to teach and re-teach correct principles so that freedom could be used wisely.Jeremiah 1:5; the Pearl of Great Price Abraham 3:23 Heavenly Father stressed the important role parents would have to teach their children the path of righteousness and happiness,Deuteronomy 6:7 and the blessing of the holy scriptures that would give a foundation of gospel knowledge, including the knowledge of the saving role of Jesus Christ and the importance of ordinances and covenants in the gospel. As the plan was explained, God's spirit children also understood that full gospel truth could be lost on the earth as men and women could choose against living by the truth at any point, and could devise other beliefs and ways to live that would be appealing to the natural mind. Yet they also understood that there would be opportunities before the final judgment for every child of God to hear of Jesus Christ and to either accept him or reject him. Latter-day Saints believe that this plan ordained by God the Father was not contrived arbitrarily, but was designed based on eternal truths to allow for the greatest possible progress toward a fullness of joy, happiness and love for the greatest number of His spirit children. He loves each of them unconditionally and desires that they progress, knowing that this leads to greater happiness and a potential fullness of joy.  War in Heaven After God the Father presented this plan, Lucifer volunteered to save mankind by taking away man's agency. Nobody would be able to fail the test and so, Lucifer claimed, everyone would be able to return to the presence of Heavenly Father. As recompense for the implementation of his plan, Lucifer demanded that the power and the glory which God the Father possessed be transferred to him, effectively making him \\"God.\\" However, as Lucifer alone would have complete freedom of choice under his plan, no other spirit could achieve exaltation. God the Father rejected Lucifer's plan. Enraged, Lucifer chose to rebel against God the Father and rallied to him \\"a third part\\" of God the Father's children who also preferred Lucifer's plan. The two factions warred, and Lucifer and his followers were cast out of Heaven; Lucifer became Satan, and those who followed him became fallen (also referred to as sons of perdition), and his servants.Revelations 12:7-9 They were denied the right to have their own physical bodies (and, consequently, the ability to procreate) but were not affected by the \\"veil\\". Latter-day Saints believe that Satan and his servants have since sought to undo or counteract God the Father's plan by tempting mortal individuals to evil actions, gaining power over them and their bodies, and by attempting to restrict their freedom of choice by whatever means possible. =Spirit world= Latter-day Saint beliefs include the belief in a spirit world between death and the resurrection. They believe that the \\"veil of forgetfulness\\" will be removed before they are judged thereafter, and that the spirits of all of mankind continue to prepare for judgment day and their eventual resurrection where they will receive a reward according to their faith and works. They believe that righteous individuals continue to proclaim the gospel of Jesus Christ in the Spirit World, teaching others and offering them the opportunity to accept Jesus Christ as their Saviour and follow God the Father's plan. =Final Judgment= The Latter-day Saints believe that the Final Judgment of mankind will occur after the final resurrection, and that Jesus Christ is ultimately the Judge of all men. Joseph Smith taught: Another description of the benevolence of the final judgment was presented by President George Q. Cannon of the First Presidency of the LDS Church in 1884: Salvation Unlike Nicene Christianity, Latter-day Saints believe that the scriptures teach of multiple types or levels of salvation: *Immortality is explained as a gift freely given to everyone, made possible by Jesus' death and resurrection.See The church teaches that \\"The spirit and the body shall be reunited again in its perfect form...even as we now are at this time. ...This restoration shall come to all, both old and young, both bond and free, both male and female, both the wicked and the righteous; and even there shall not so much as a hair of their heads be lost; but every thing shall be restored to its perfect frame.\\" *After everyone has been resurrected, all will be judged by God with Jesus Christ as our advocate. As part of this judgment, each person is assigned to one of three heavenly kingdoms (sometimes called Degrees of Glory): the Celestial Kingdom,See the Terrestrial Kingdom, and the Telestial Kingdom.See also 1 Corinthians 15:40 and 2 Corinthians 12:2 The kingdom within heaven for which each person has qualified is conditional upon acceptance of, and true faith in, Jesus Christ as the Savior and Redeemer of mankind - this is demonstrated through baptism and obedience to the laws and ordinances of the gospel, including repentance. *In order to achieve \\"eternal life\\", the highest quality and happiest of the degrees of salvation, one must enter into the Celestial Kingdom. Each level of salvation as explained above relies upon Christ's grace through His infinite atonement, and is conditional upon each person's eventual acceptance of Jesus Christ as their personal Savior from the consequence of sin and spiritual death. Through His physical and spiritual suffering in the Garden of Gethsemane and on the cross, He makes it possible for each person to be made clean from the metaphorical stains of human imperfections, and justifies and sanctifies each righteous person for admission into the glory that they have merited as they come unto Him with \\"full purpose of heart.\\"2 Nephi 9 & 31 *Outer Darkness is reserved for those people who, after gaining a full knowledge of the Gospel, willfully deny and contend against the Holy Ghost. (Satan, his followers from the premortal life, and those who were born on earth but chose to become sons of perdition.) These individuals who inherit no glory are called sons of perdition. Although resurrected, and thus immortal, they willfully rebelled and rejected the right to salvation.Doxey, Roy W, Doctrine and Covenants Speaks, 1970, Ch. 2 Practical applications Latter-day Saints believe following the plan of salvation entails obedience to God's commandments. This includes: active faith through emulation of Jesus Christ and adherence to His teachings; worship of God the Father, and of Jesus as the Messiah/Christ and Son of God; constant repentance and abandonment of sinful practices; teaching the Gospel of Jesus Christ to others to aid in their eternal progress; enjoyment of and gratitude for the blessings available to human beings throughout their mortal existences; and resistance to the influence of Satan and his servants. = Good works = Latter-day Saints believe that loving kindness, compassion and mercy toward other human beings are integral to the plan, and are an essential part of the growth that human beings experience in this life. Charitable work and relief aid are similarly vital; Latter-day Saints are encouraged to fast for two meals once a month and donate (at least) the cost of those meals as \\"fast offerings\\" for support and aid of local members suffering from financial difficulties. Money is also donated to sectarian, non-denominational and secular relief agencies worldwide, and many Latter-day Saints volunteer at soup kitchens, homeless shelters and blood drives, among other things. Latter- day Saints youth organizations frequently include community service among their regular activities in an effort to encourage application of the Christian principles inherent in the plan of salvation. = Accountability = It is important to note that, as part of the plan, those who are incapable of understanding the consequences of their actions, or who cannot control themselves, or otherwise cannot exercise free will are not held accountable for their actions. They are considered innocents. Thus children who die before they reach \\"the age of accountability\\" (in practice, eight years of age) are automatically saved; because they could not understand God's laws or make choices accordingly, they could not truly sin. Similarly, individuals with severe mental handicaps may be considered innocent. = Agency and theodicy = Additionally, the concept of free will in the plan of salvation (usually referred to as \\"agency\\" or \\"moral agency\\" by Latter-day Saints) is the basis of Latter-day Saint theodicy. God will not force anyone to obey His laws. Latter-Day Saints believe that, were God to automatically protect the righteous in every instance, people would be universally frustrated in their attempts to sin, thus effectively removing any true opportunity to exercise agency. An individual's sinful act may have tragic consequences for others, but Heavenly Father will still not deny any individual their freedom to choose good or evil. Latter-day Saints understand that, as a consequence, \\"bad things\\" may happen to \\"good people.\\" A good person may, for example, be killed by another individual who chose to drive recklessly or while intoxicated; infectious diseases may be spread by a lack of attention to detail in sterilization procedures; bad people may choose to steal the possessions or oppress good people; etc. In the end, it is all seen as part of the Divine plan in which all humanity is given the chance to decide their own courses of action in mortality and in the hereafter. Hypothesized influence of Emanuel Swedenborg The \\"three degrees of glory\\" is a New Testament doctrine, central to the teachings of Paul (1st Corinthians 15:40-41). However, historian D. Michael Quinn in his book Early Mormonism and the Magic World View, has speculated that various parts of the plan of salvation were taken by Joseph Smith from Emanuel Swedenborg's book Heaven and Hell. In the book, Swedenborg wrote that \\"There are three heavens\\" that are \\"entirely distinct from each other.\\"D. Michael Quinn, Early Mormonism and the Magic World View, Signature Books, Salt Lake City, 1998, p. 217. He called the highest heaven \\"the Celestial Kingdom,\\" and stated that the inhabitants of the three heavens corresponded to the \\"sun, moon and stars.\\" Swedenborg's book also mentions a veil, spirit prison and celestial marriage. Quinn further argues that the book was available to Smith, and that he was familiar with it. One account claims that Smith told Latter Day Saint convert from Swedenborgism Edward Hunter that \\"Emanuel Swedenborg had a view of the world to come, but for daily food he perished.\\"D. Michael Quinn, Early Mormonism and the Magic World View, Signature Books, Salt Lake City, 1998, p. 218. Additionally, Quinn asserts that the book was in the Palmyra public library beginning in 1817, and that \\"[n]ine miles from Smith's farm, in 1826 the Canandaigua newspaper also advertised Swedenborg's book for sale. The bookstore offered Swedenborg's publications for as little as 37 cents.\\" Historian Richard Bushman argues that it was more likely that both Swedenborg and Smith were influenced by New Testament scriptures that refer to \\"celestial\\" and \\"terrestrial\\" bodies that are compared to the sun, moon, and stars, noting fundamental differences between Smith's and Swedenborg's versions of heaven.Bushman, Richard Lyman, (2005).

Tongi Shahid Memorial School compound is mass burial site of the genocide in Liberation War of Bangladesh. History Mir Jumla II (1660–1663) built a fort to protect the northern entry of Dhaka during his reign as a Mughal subadar (1660–1663). The subadar also built a bridge over the river Turag. Mir Jumla constructed a road, now a part of the Dhaka-Mymensingh highway, that connected Tongi with Bag-e-Badshahi. It served as an axis of urban growth in the 19th and 20th centuries as sites for establishment of new urban settlements - Gulshan (formed in 1961), Banani (in 1964), Baridhara (in 1972) and Uttara (in 1965) - were picked off the highlands along that axis road.

It lies within the jurisdiction Gazipur District, which is a part of the Dhaka Division. Geologically, the Tongi area comprises the southern extension of the Madhupur tract, a long narrow tract of tectonically elevated area of older sediments only a few metres above the surrounding rivers the Turag. Locally, the Tract is subdivided into the Bhawal Garh terrace which is a part of an inlier, an elevated area surrounded by lowlands by very young riverine sediments occupying the surrounding valleys. The older sediment sequence consists of sandstone of the Dupi Tila Formation overlain by Madhupur Clay, which in turn is overlain by alluvium. The elevation of the Tract varies from 2 to 14 m above mean sea level and it has shallow bedrock which forms a firm substrate for supporting large structures. Demography Many of the people who live in Tongi commute to Dhaka each day, mainly by bus. Many people are also employed at factories in Export Processing Zones, areas given special tax and tariff exemptions by the government in order to stimulate industry.

History Marienaltar by Tilman Riemenschneider, ca. 1510) The Celts who founded the town between 200 and 100 B.C. also farmed the surrounding plateaus and valleys. In 1349, Creglingen received its town charter from Emperor Karl IV (Charles IV). Attractions Creglingen is known for the Herrgottskirche outside of the town. It contains a masterwork of late-Gothic sculpture by Tilman Riemenschneider, the Marienaltar. The church is a pilgrimage chapel, established following a reported discovery of an undamaged communion wafer by a peasant ploughing his field in 1384. This wafer was thought to be the cause of miracles and people flocked to the site. The local lords, Konrad and Gottfried von Hohenlohe-Brauneck, had a Gothic chapel built in 1386–96. At the pilgrimage's peak around 1500 a number of altars were ordered that remain in the church today. The central altar by Riemenschneider was built on the spot where the wafer was reportedly found. The figures are made from the wood of linden trees, the surrounding frames from pine trees. At a total height of 11 meters the altar dominated the small church. Although Reformation reached the area in 1530, its iconoclasm spared the local church. The altar wings of the main altar were closed, however, as the depicted Assumption of Mary was offensive to the Protestant congregations. Its good state of preservation is owed to the fact that the wings of the altar remained closed and the whole was covered by funeral wreaths until 1832.

Introduced in 1999, it is based on the 9.3×64mm Brenneke case, necked up to accept a diameter bullet. The case is also shortened by about 4 mm to fit a standard length rifle action. It was developed as an evolution of Jeff Cooper's \\"Super Scout\\" medium rifle concept, which was in turn an extension of his original scout rifle concept. Cooper used a version of Steyr's Scout rifle chambered in .350 Remington Magnum to hunt large and dangerous game, originally calling it a \\"Super Scout\\". After taking a lion at close range with the weapon, he switched to calling that rifle his \\"Lion Scout\\". An additional motivation for development of the new cartridge was that authorities in certain areas of the world dictate a minimum caliber of round which may be used in hunting dangerous game such as cape buffalo and lion. In general the minimum is either .366 or .375 caliber, so to make the cartridge accepted in almost all African countries, the newly designed cartridge uses a 375 caliber bore. When Steyr initially discussed the new round with Cooper, they intended to call it the .375 Steyr. Cooper said they should instead call it a .376, to avoid confusion with the .375 H&H; Magnum. Cooper subsequently referred to the Scout Rifle in .376 Steyr caliber as the \\"Dragoon\\" or \\"Dragoon Scout,\\" this marking being on the one that Steyr sent him. This designation has been dropped, and is not on production units. With a higher felt recoil, the .376 Steyr is the largest practical cartridge for use in such a short, lightweight weapon as the Scout.

NSLs do not require prior approval from a judge. The Stored Communications Act, Fair Credit Reporting Act, and Right to Financial Privacy Act authorize the United States government to seek such information that is \\"relevant\\" to authorized national security investigations. By law, NSLs can request only non-content information, for example, transactional records and phone numbers dialed, but never the content of telephone calls or e-mails.USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005: A Legal Analysis Congressional Research Service's report for Congress, Brian T. Yeh, Charles Doyle, December 21, 2006. NSLs typically contain a nondisclosure requirement forbidding the recipient of an NSL from disclosing that the FBI had requested the information. The nondisclosure provision must be authorized by the Director of the FBI, and only after he or she certifies \\"that otherwise there may result a danger to the national security of the United States; interference with a criminal, counterterrorism, or counterintelligence investigation; interference with diplomatic relations; or danger to the life or physical safety of any person.\\" Moreover, a recipient of the NSL may still challenge the nondisclosure provision in federal court. The constitutionality of such nondisclosure provisions has been repeatedly challenged. The requirement was initially ruled to be unconstitutional as an infringement of free speech in the Doe v. Gonzales case, but that decision was later vacated in 2008 by the Second Circuit Court of Appeals after it held the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act gave the recipient of an NSL that included a nondisclosure provision the right to challenge the nondisclosure provision in federal court. In March 2013, a judge in the Northern District of California held the nondisclosure provision in an NSL was unconstitutional. But on August 24, 2015, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals vacated the district court's decision and remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings. On remand, the district court held the \\"NSLs were issued in full compliance with the procedural and substantive requirements suggested by the Second Circuit in John Doe, Inc. v.

On appeal, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the district court ruling, holding that NSLs are constitutional and held, \\"the nondisclosure requirement does not run afoul of the First Amendment.\\" Under Seal v. Jefferson B. Sessions, III, Attorney General, Nos. 16-16067, 16-16081, and 16-16082, July 17, 2017.  History  The oldest NSL provisions were created in 1978 as a little-used investigative tool in terrorism and espionage investigations to obtain financial records. Under the Right to Financial Privacy Act (RFPA), part of the Financial Institutions Regulatory and Interest Rate Control Act of 1978, the FBI could obtain the records only if the FBI could first demonstrate the person was a foreign power or an agent of a foreign power. Compliance by the recipient of the NSL was voluntary, and states' consumer privacy laws often allowed financial institutions to reject the requests.Andrew E. Nieland, National Security Letters and the Amended Patriot Act, 92 Cornell L. Rev. 1201, 1207 (2007) In 1986, Congress amended RFPA to allow the government to request disclosure of the requested information. In 1986, Congress passed the Electronic Communications Privacy Act (ECPA), part of the Stored Communications Act), which created provisions similar to the RFPA that allowed the FBI to issue NSLs. Still, neither RFPA or ECPA act included penalties for not complying with the NSL. A 1993 amendment removed the restriction regarding \\"foreign powers\\" and allowed the use of NSLs to request information concerning persons who are not the direct subject of the investigation. In 2001, section 505 of the USA PATRIOT Act expanded the use of the NSLs. In March 2006, the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act allowed for judicial review of an NSL. A federal judge could repeal or modify an NSL if the court found the request for information was \\"unreasonable, oppressive, or otherwise unlawful.\\" The nondisclosure provision the government could include in an NSL was also weakened. The court could repeal the nondisclosure provision if it found it had been made in bad faith. Other amendments allowed the recipient of an NSL to inform their attorney about the request and the government had to rely on the courts to enforce compliance with an NSL.  Patriot Act  Section 505 of the USA PATRIOT Act (2001) allowed the use of the NSLs when seeking information \\"relevant\\" in authorized national security investigations to protect against international terrorism or clandestine intelligence activities. The act also provided the Department of Defense when conducting a law enforcement investigation, counterintelligence inquiry, or security determination. The Central Intelligence Agency has also allegedly issued NSLs. The Patriot Act reauthorization statutes passed during the 109th Congress added potential penalties for failure to comply with an NSL or disclosing an NSL if the NSL included a nondisclosure provision.  Contentious aspects  Two contentious aspects of NSLs are the nondisclosure provision and judicial oversight when the FBI issues an NSL. When the Director of the FBI (or his designee) authorizes the inclusion of a nondisclosure provision in an NSL, the recipient may face criminal prosecution if it reveals the contents of the NSL or that it was received. The purpose of a nondisclosure provision is to prevent the recipient of an NSL from compromising both the current FBI investigation involving a specific person as well as future investigations (see 18 U.S.C. 2709), either of which could fetter the Government's efforts to address threats to national security.My National Security Letter, The Washington Post, 2007 Mar 23 An NSL recipient (later revealed to be Nicholas MerrillJohn Doe’ Who Fought FBI Spying Freed From Gag Order After 6 Years Kim Zetter, Wired.com, 2010 8 10) writing in The Washington Post said, > [L]iving under the gag order has been stressful and surreal. Under the > threat of criminal prosecution, I must hide all aspects of my involvement in > the case ... from my colleagues, my family and my friends. When I meet with > my attorneys I cannot tell my girlfriend where I am going or where I have > been. Like other administrative subpoenas, NSLs do not require judicial approval. For NSLs, that is because the U.S. Supreme Court has held the types of information the FBI obtains with NSLs provide no constitutionally protected reasonable expectation of privacy. Because a person has already provided the information to a third party, e.g., their telephone company, they no longer have a reasonable expectation of privacy to the information, and therefore there is no Fourth Amendment requirement to obtain a judge's approval to obtain the information.Smith v. Maryland, 442 U.S. 735 (1979); Fourth Amendment, U.S. Const. Nonetheless, the recipient of the NSL may still challenge the nondisclosure provision in federal court.18 U.S.C. § 3511 The media reported in 2007 that a government audit found the FBI had violated the rules more than 1,000 times in an audit of 10% of its national investigations between 2002 and 2007. Twenty such incidents involved requests by agents for information not permitted under the law. A subsequent report in 2014 by the Justice Department Office of Inspector General concluded the FBI had corrected its practices and that NSLs complied with federal statutes. According to 2,500 pages of documents the FBI provided to the Electronic Frontier Foundation in response to a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit, the FBI had used NSLs to obtain information about individuals who were the subject of an FBI terrorism or counterintelligence investigation and information from telecommunications companies about individuals with whom the subject of the investigation had communicated. According to a September 9, 2007, New York Times report, > In many cases, the target of a[n FBI] national security letter whose records > are being sought is not necessarily the actual subject of a terrorism > investigation. Under the USA PATRIOT Act, the FBI must assert only that the > records gathered through the letter are considered relevant to a terrorism > [or counterintelligence] investigation. In April 2008, the American Civil Liberties Union alleged that the military was using the FBI to skirt legal restrictions on domestic surveillance to obtain private records of Americans' Internet service providers, financial institutions, and telephone companies. The ACLU based its allegation on a review of more than 1,000 documents provided by the Defense Department. The Department of Justice Office of Inspector General later determined the Department of Defense (not the FBI) had lawfully obtained the information under the National Security Act of 1947, not through NSLs.  Doe v. Ashcroft  Letter in Doe v. Ashcroft case The lack of judicial oversight and the Supreme Court ruling in Smith v. Maryland was the core of Doe v. Ashcroft, a test case brought by the ACLU concerning the use of NSLs. The lawsuit was file on behalf of \\"John Doe\\" plaintiff Nicholas Merrill, founder of Calyx Internet Access, who had received an NSL. The action challenged the constitutionality of NSLs, specifically the nondisclosure provision. At the district court, Judge of the Southern District of New York held in September 2004 that NSLs violated the Fourth Amendment (\\"it has the effect of authorizing coercive searches effectively immune from any judicial process\\") and First Amendment. However, Judge Marrero stayed his ruling while the case proceeded to the court of appeals. Because of the New York district court ruling, while the case was still on appeal, Congress amended the USA PATRIOT Act to provide for more judicial review of NSLs and clarified the NSL nondisclosure provision. Based on the U.S. Supreme Court rulings, there is still no requirement to seek judicial approval for the FBI issuing an NSL. The government appealed Judge Marrero's decision to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, which heard arguments in May 2006. In March 2008, the Second Circuit ruled that nondisclosure provisions were permissible only when the FBI certified that disclosure may result in certain statutorily enumerated harms (see, e.g., 18 U.S.C. 2709), and held the nondisclosure provision to a strict scrutiny standard. The Second Circuit then returned the case to the district court based on amendments to the USA PATRIOT Act that Congress had enacted while the case had been on appeal. Letter in the Doe v. Gonzales case Another effect of Doe v. Ashcroft was increased congressional oversight. The amendments to the USA PATRIOT Act mentioned above included requirements for semiannual reporting to Congress. Although the reports are classified, a nonclassified accounting of how many NSLs are issued is also required. On April 28, 2006, the Department of Justice reported to the House and Senate that in calendar year 2005, \\"The Government made requests for certain information concerning 3,501 United States persons pursuant to NSLs. During this period, the total number of NSL requests ... for information concerning U.S. persons totaled 9,254.\\"Report of Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act , United States Department of Justice In 2010, the FBI agreed to lift partially the nondisclosure provision to allow Merrill to reveal his identity. On August 28, 2015, Judge Marrero rescinded the nondisclosure provision associated with the NSL Merrill had received, thereby allowing him to speak about the contents of the NSL. On November 30, 2015, the unredacted court ruling was published in full.

Publication history Doctor Spectro first appeared in Captain Atom #79 and was created by Steve Ditko and Joe Gill. Fictional character biography =Charlton Comics= After inventing a series of prisms that could alter human emotions, a scientist was kidnapped by a gang of criminals and forced to use his invention to commit a bank robbery. When the scientist refused to help, the criminals pushed him into his experimental machinery. The strange energies of the machine reacted with the prisms, giving the scientist the ability to control emotions directly. The energy also affected his mind, causing the scientist to embark on a crime spree as Doctor Spectro. The superhero Captain Atom confronted Doctor Spectro, who was disintegrated when he came into contact with a high tension wire.Captain Atom #79 Doctor Spectro managed to survive and returned to fight Captain Atom.Captain Atom #81 (July 1966) =DC Comics= Doctor Spectro became part of the DC Universe after DC Comics purchased the rights to Captain Atom and other characters. He appeared in issues #9 and 10 of Crisis on Infinite Earths (December 1985 and January 1986, respectively). Post-Crisis, Doctor Spectro was re-introduced in Captain Atom Vol. 3, #5 (July 1987), in a story written by Cary Bates and drawn by Pat Broderick. In the new version Doctor Spectro was really Tom Emery. A newspaper reporter discovered that \\"Doctor Spectro\\" was the creation of General Wade Eiling to act as a fake supervillain whose exploits were used to provide a cover story for the Captain Atom project. Once Captain Atom went missing, Doctor Spectro reverted to the life of a small-time super-crook. Doctor Spectro has made guest appearances in other DC titles, including Underworld Unleashed (November 1995), JLA #34 (October 1999), Action Comics #760 (December 1999), JSA #28 (November 2001), and Superman/Batman #3 (December 2003). In the Green Arrow comics, the Green Arrow family often claim that Doctor Spectro has the worst supervillain costume. In Green Arrow #26, Green Arrow confronts saboteurs at a construction site saying: \\"What are you doing?! When a guy twice your size in a costume tells you to stop doing something--you stop! Unless it’s the Riddler. Or that moron Doctor Spectro. Cause they’re just…sad\\". In #46, Speedy quips to a villain: \\"Dude, that is one sorry outfit. You make Doctor Spectro look cool. You know how hard that is?\\" In the recent novelized version of Infinite Crisis, Doctor Spectro was killed by Superboy-Prime alongside the hero Gunfire. This was a scene notably not shown in the illustrated Infinite Crisis mini-series, and occurred at the same time that the death of Blood Pack was shown. Powers and abilities Doctor Spectro uses his special light powers to control people's emotions. In other media In the Justice League Unlimited episode \\"Dead Reckoning\\", Doctor Spectro is seen as one of the latest recruits in the Secret Society. Doctor Spectro appears at the beginning of the second volume of the comic book tie-in of Batman: The Brave and the Bold. He teams up with Crazy Quilt and Rainbow Raider to defeat Batman and Blue Beetle.Batman: The Brave and The Bold Volume 2 #14.

The 21st century has witnessed an increase in scholarly interest in the integrated use of archaeology as an additional research component in arriving at a better understanding of the historical Jesus by illuminating the socio-economic and political background of his age.Jonathan L. Reed, \\"Archaeological contributions to the study of Jesus and the Gospels\\" in The Historical Jesus in Context edited by Amy-Jill Levine et al. Princeton Univ Press 2006 pages 40-47Archaeology and the Galilean Jesus: a re-examination of the evidence by Jonathan L. Reed 2002 pages xi-xii\\"Jesus Research and Archaeology: A New Perspective\\" by James H. Charlesworth in Jesus and archaeology edited by James H. Charlesworth 2006 pages 11-15 James Charlesworth states that few modern scholars now want to overlook the archaeological discoveries that clarify the nature of life in Galilee and Judea during the time of Jesus. Jonathan Reed states that chief contribution of archaeology to the study of the historical Jesus is the reconstruction of his social world. An example archaeological item that Reed mentions is the 1961 discovery of the Pilate Stone, which mentions the Roman prefect Pontius Pilate, by whose order Jesus was crucified.Archaeology and the Galilean Jesus: a re-examination of the evidence by Jonathan L. Reed 2002 page 18Historical Dictionary of Jesus by Daniel J. Harrington 2010 page 32Studying the historical Jesus: evaluations of the state of current research by Bruce Chilton, Craig A. Evans 1998 page 465 Reed also states that archaeological finding related to coinage can shed light on historical critical analysis. As an example, he refers to coins with the \\"\\"Divi filius\\" inscription. Although Roman Emperor Augustus called himself \\"Divi filius\\", and not \\"Dei filius\\" (Son of God), the line between being god and god-like was at times less than clear to the population at large, and the Roman court seems to have been aware of the necessity of keeping the ambiguity.Experiencing Rome: culture, identity and power in the Roman Empire by Janet Huskinson 1999 page 81 Later, Tiberius who was emperor at the time of Jesus came to be accepted as the son of divus Augustus.Early Christian literature by Helen Rhee 2005 pages 159-161 Reed discusses this coinage in the context of (known as Render unto Caesar...) in which Jesus asks his disciples to look at a coin: \\"Whose portrait is this? And whose inscription?\\" and then advises them to \\"Render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's, and unto God the things that are God's.\\" Reed states that \\"the answer becomes much more subversive when one knows that Roman coinage proclaimed Caesar to be God\\". David Gowler states that an interdisciplinary scholarly study of archeology, textual analysis and historical context can shed light on Jesus and his teachings.What are they saying about the historical Jesus? by David B. Gowler 2007 page 102 An example is the archeological studies at Capernaum. Despite the frequent references to Capernaum in the New Testament, little is said about it there.\\"Jesus and Capernaum: Archeological and Gospel Stratigraohy\\" in Archaeology and the Galilean Jesus: a re-examination of the evidence' by Jonathan L. Reed 2002 page 139-156 However, recent archeological evidence show that unlike earlier assumptions, Capernaum was poor and small, without even a forum or agora.Jesus and archaeology edited by James H. Charlesworth 2006 page 127 This archaeological discovery thus resonates well with the scholarly view that Jesus advocated reciprocal sharing among the destitute in that area of Galilee. Other archeological findings support the wealth of the ruling priests in Judea at the beginning of the first century.Who Was Jesus? by Paul Copan and Craig A.

The first unit to be re-engined was D6123, a further 19 machines were re-engined in 1965–1967 at Glasgow Works and mostly Inverurie Works, along with other modifications including the fitting of four-character headcode displays in the nose ends (D6123 retained its original front ends and so did not receive a headcode panel).xp64mag.co.uk After rebuilding, they returned to service from Eastfield depot in Glasgow. The allocation of all twenty locomotives in August 1967 was Eastfield. Withdrawal Although these offered more power and much improved reliability over the original Class 21s, they did not survive much longer, due to their small class size and the use of a non-standard high-speed diesel engine. D6108 was withdrawn in May 1969 and scrapped by McWilliams of Shettleston in 1971, while the other 19 were withdrawn between April and December 1971 and scrapped at BR's Glasgow Works in 1971–72.

While EBM (electronic body music) has a minimal structure and clean production, electro-industrial tends to have a grittier, complex and layered sound. The style was pioneered by Skinny Puppy, Front Line Assembly, Numb and other groups, either from Canada or the Benelux. In the early 1990s, the style spawned the dark electro genre, and in the mid-/late-1990s, the aggrotech offshoot.Interview with Axel Machens, Vendetta Music, April 23, 2007. Access date: December 23, 2008. The fan base for the style is linked to the rivethead subculture. Characteristics After the EBM movement faded in the early 1990s, electro-industrial increasingly attained popularity in the international club scene. In contrast to the straight EBM style, electro- industrial groups use harsher beats and raspy, distorted, or digitized vocals. In contrast to industrial rock, electro-industrial groups mostly avoided guitars, other than Skinny Puppy, who used E-Guitar Elements since the mid 80s in songs like Testure or Dig It. and Numb on songs like God Is Dead.

They laid the foundations of the dark electro movement in the early 1990s, and were the first artist on the German label Celtic Circle Productions.

Aggrotech typically employs aggressive beats, prominent lead synth lines, and lyrics of a dark nature.

She was later recommissioned and placed into service during the Spanish–American War. Construction The first U.S. Navy ship to be so named, Sangamon was built by the shipbuilding firm Reaney, Son & Archbold under the name Conestoga in the summer of 1862; renamed Sangamon on September 9, 1862; launched on October 27, 1862; and commissioned on February 9, 1863 at Chester, Pennsylvania, Commodore Pierce Crosby in command. =Assigned to the North Atlantic blockade= The monitor was assigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron and soon began efficient but unspectacular operations in Hampton Roads, Virginia and in the many roughly parallel rivers which empty into Chesapeake Bay. Sangamon was one of the vital ships of the Navy which guaranteed the Army control of the waters which border and penetrate the bitterly contested land which separated Washington, D.C. and Richmond, Virginia. After repairs at Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on 21 February 1864, she was towed by to Port Royal, South Carolina for duty with the South Atlantic Blockading Squadron. After Union blockade duty off Charleston, South Carolina, she returned to Hampton Roads in the summer to support General Ulysses S. Grant's drive on Richmond, Virginia. =Varied river duties= Sangamon performed widely varied duties. She conducted reconnaissance expeditions up the river to obtain information, and often dueled Confederate forces hidden along the banks. She guarded Union troop concentrations and served as part of the Union naval force which patrolled the upper James to prevent the Confederate flotilla from threatening Union transports. Officers of the Sangamon in the James River, 1865 In March–April 1865, during the final thrust on Richmond, Virginia, she assisted in clearing the river of Confederate torpedoes (mines) and countering the threat of Confederate ironclads so that Union shipping could proceed safely to the Confederate capital. One of her final wartime assignments Sangamon was required to perform, was to accompany the tugboat flotilla towing the previously captured and unfinished Confederate casemate ironclad to her final destination at the Norfolk Naval Shipyard on May 3, 1865. The overall expedition was led by Sangamons skipper at the time, Lieutenant Commander R. Chandler.Official Records of the Union and Confederate Navies in the War of the Rebellion, Series I, Vol. 12, p. 98, 1901 Post–Civil War operations After the war ended, Sangamon was decommissioned at Philadelphia and placed in reserve. Renamed Jason on 10 June 1869, no record has been found of any subsequent active service until she was recommissioned on 13 May 1898 for service during the Spanish–American War. The old monitor was stationed at Fisher's Island, Long Island, New York where she provided the New York City area with some degree of naval protection against the perceived threat of a raid by Spanish cruisers. Final decommissioning In 1899, she returned to Philadelphia and was placed in reserve at League Island, where she remained until sold in April 1904.

Birth and family Pierce was born on 3 February 1811 in Greene County, Georgia. He was the son of the Rev. Lovick Pierce, a pastor and a chaplain in the War of 1812. Rev. Pierce was the brother of Rev. Reddick Pierce. Both brothers were well known within the southern Methodist circuit; though, Lovick and his son George were perhaps the more famous. The elder brother Reddick had a daughter, Sarah, who in turn (after marrying an Alexander McKinnon) had a son, which she name Robert George Pierce McKinnon. Robert George Pierce McKinnon, named after his mother's cousin, in turn was a Methodist minister (and subsequently, baptist, as employment demands dictated); though, his fame was localized within the area of Eastman, Georgia. Education and career Pierce first studied law, but was converted to the Christian faith at the age of sixteen in a revival at Franklin College in Athens, Georgia (the founding college of the University of Georgia), from which he later graduated. While at Franklin College, he was a member of the Phi Kappa Literary Society. He joined the Traveling Ministry of the Georgia Annual Regional Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church in 1831, the only college graduate at the time. He was ordained by Bishop James Osgood Andrew. Pierce served as a pastor and a presiding elder in the Church. After eight years he was elected President of the Georgia Female College in Macon (now Wesleyan College), the first four-year college in the world chartered to offer undergraduate education exclusively to women. In 1848 he became the President of Emory College (later, University), its first President to have been educated in Georgia. Both schools were founded by the Methodist Episcopal Church. Pierce served as president of Emory until his election as a Bishop in 1854. Pierce was a delegate to the historic General Conference of 1844 which met in New York City. He tried in vain to be a moderating influence in the debate that erupted over slavery. In the end, the next year in Louisville he reluctantly helped to organize the Methodist Episcopal Church, South which resulted from the schism of 1844. He was likewise initially resistant to Georgia's secession prior to the Civil War, but later supported the Confederacy and maintained friendships with Robert Toombs and Alexander Stephens. He advocated for the repeal of Georgia's slave laws in 1863. However, scholarly works such as \\"The Southern Methodist Church and the Proslavery Argument\\", published in The Journal of Southern History, vol 32, No. 3. (August 1966), pp. 325–41. note that Pierce's reforms were mild. In 1863 Pierce delivered a speech before the Georgia Legislature in which he argued for slavery and supported the secession of states and the Confederate cause, stating \\"The triumph of our arms is the triumph of right and truth and justice. The defeat of our enemies us the defeat of wrong and malice and outrage. Our Confederacy has committed herself to no iniquitous policy, no unholy alliances, no unwarrantable plans...\\"Purifoy p. 340 Pierce was widely popular throughout the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. After resigning Emory's presidency to become Bishop, he maintained a close affiliation with the college, serving in later years as a trustee and helping to raise capital funds for the school. Death and legacy Pierce died on 3 September 1884 near Sparta, Georgia, where he was buried. Wesleyan College has named two chapels in his honor. The original Pierce Chapel was an integral part of daily life at Wesleyan's former downtown Macon campus before the college was destroyed in a 1963 fire. In 2015, Wesleyan dedicated a new Pierce Chapel at its present suburban campus. Pierce Avenue, a major road in Macon and part of Georgia State Route 247, is also named for George Foster Pierce.

The physics involved in actually triggering an earthquake is complex. Most earthquake-generating zones are in a state of being close to failure. If such a zone were to be left completely alone, it would generate significant earthquakes spontaneously. Remote earthquakes, however, are in a position to disturb this critical state, either by shifting the stresses statically, or by dynamic change caused by passing seismic waves. The first type of triggering may be due to static changes in the critical state. For example, after the magnitude 7.3 Landers earthquake struck California in 1992, it is said that \\"the earthquake map of California lit up like a Christmas tree\\".\\"When the magnitude 7.3 Landers earthquake struck in 1992 in the desert north of Palm Springs, the earthquake map of the state of California lit up like a Christmas tree.\\" The Very Long Reach of Very Large Earthquakes This event reinforced the idea of remotely triggered earthquakes, and pushed the hypothesis into the scientific mainstream. Following the very large 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake, it was established that remote earthquakes had been triggered as far away as Alaska. There is scientific evidence for a \\"long reach\\", mainly in the form of discrete element modelling used in the mining industry. If rock is modeled as discrete elements in a critical state, a single disturbance can influence a wide area. A smaller-scale example is when a small excavation in a valley triggers a landslide and brings down a whole mountainside.

Biography Stone was born in the town Hertford, in the county of Hertfordshire, England. In 1620, he left Hertford to study at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, from where he graduated in 1624. He was ordained on July 8, 1626 at Peterborough and a year later became curate at Stisted, Essex. In 1633, Samuel Stone and Thomas Hooker sailed across the Atlantic on a ship named the Griffin. They arrived in Boston on the 4th of September of the same year, and a few weeks later, Samuel Stone became a Teacher of the Cambridge Church under Hooker, who was the preacher.See Calvin's Institutes for the distinctions between these two functions in Reformed thinking and practice. In 1644, he became a Freeman. In 1636, Stone and Hooker led their congregation from New Towne (now Cambridge, Massachusetts) and established a new colony at House of Hope (a Dutch fort and trading post), making peace with the local Indians and renaming the town they called Saukiog as Hartford, after Stone's birthplace - they thus became the town's founding fathers. Personal life Stone was twice married. By his second wife, Elizabeth Allyn, whom he wed in 1641, he had four (4?) surviving children—a son Samuel and four daughters, Elizabeth, Rebecca, Mary and Sarah. He published “A Congregational Church, a Catholike Visible Church” in London in 1642, in answer to Samuel Hudson's \\"Visible Catholick Church\\", and left two works in manuscript: a catechism and a confutation of the Antinomians.

An artist, he wrote a significant travel guide to Bali, and eventually produced a whole series of travel guide books. In the late 1960s he trekked from Europe to Asia. He was especially intrigued by Bali, where he earned a living by selling his paintings of the Indonesian island to tourists. He was frustrated, however, by the lack of easily available information on Bali's colourful culture and people. Where did their beliefs originate? How did their art develop? Hoefer searched for a guidebook that would provide this information, as well as describe its tourist sites.

Construction At the time of the Memphis bridge construction, it was a significant technological challenge and is considered to be chief engineer George S. Morison's crowning achievement. No other bridges had ever been attempted on the Lower Mississippi River. The bridge is built entirely of open-hearth steel, a newly developed material at the time of construction. The structure features a main span and two additional spans. Its height above the water was the highest clearance of any U.S. bridge of that era. The construction of the piers went nearly below the water's surface. Though some sources claim two cantilevered roadways were added to the bridge in the 1930s, one on each side,American Society of Civil Engineers: Morison's Memphis Bridge they probably confuse this bridge with the neighboring Harahan Bridge, which had two cantilevered roadways from 1917 until the Memphis & Arkansas Bridge opened in 1949. (The former roadway on the north side of the Harahan Bridge is now designated as Big River Crossing, having been refitted to carry pedestrian and bicycle traffic across the Mississippi River in 2016.) While the Frisco Bridge has not featured cantilevered roadways, pedestrians, buggies, and some automobiles used its main deck before the Harahan Bridge opened (the bridge was closed to such traffic while a train was crossing). Construction for the Kansas City, Fort Scott and Memphis Railway, later acquired by the \\"Frisco,\\" began in 1888 and was completed May 12, 1892. In the end the project created a bridge that was the farthest south on the Mississippi River, featured the longest truss span in the United States and cost nearly 3 million dollars. A testament to its design and construction, the bridge is still used by BNSF Railway and is being renovated as part of a system-wide BNSF infrastructure improvement program. The west approach to the bridge, which was made of 52 spans totaling in length, was replaced by a new 27-span bridge. This project was completed in 2017.The bridge is listed as a Historic Civil Engineering Landmark.

It served in the Eastern Theater, primarily in West Virginia and then in the Shenandoah Valley region of Virginia. Organization and service The 8th Ohio Cavalry Regiment was formed on January 4, 1864, from among members of the former 44th Ohio Infantry, under the command of Col. Samuel A. Gilbert. Organized and mustered into service in March 1864 at Camp Dennison in Cincinnati, it first served in West Virginia and was attached to 1st Brigade, 2nd Cavalry Division, Army of West Virginia. It saw considerable service during the Valley Campaigns of 1864 under Philip H. Sheridan, fighting in several key battles that led to the defeat of the Confederate Army of the Valley.Dyer, p. 1478. In a predawn raid on 3 Oct. 1864, Confederate Captain John McNeill led approximately 50 Confederate rangers against roughly 100 Union troopers of the 8th Ohio Cavalry Regiment guarding a Meems Bottom bridge at Mt. Jackson, Virginia, a strategic crossing of the Valley Turnpike over the North Fork of the Shenandoah River. The attack lasted just fifteen minutes with most of the detachment of the 8th Ohio Cavalry were captured but McNeill, one the best-known and feared Confederate partisan raiders as leader of McNeill's Rangers, was mortally wounded. He was taken to a nearby house on Rude's Hill, where he was left for a period of time until his identity was subsequently discovered by Union General Sheridan's troops. He was secreted away from Rude's Hill by a small band of Confederates when the Federals had temporarily left, thinking he was too incapacitated to move and thus did not need a guard. McNeill was moved to Harrisonburg in Confederate hands, where he died on November 10 Most of the regiment was captured by the Confederates during an engagement at Beverly, West Virginia, on January 11, 1865, and those men were mustered out as prisoners of war in June 1865 and returned to Ohio. The remainder (4 companies that were on detached duty in Clarksburg, West Virginia) mustered out at the end of July.Reid, p. 807. During its term of service, the regiment (both as 44th Ohio Infantry and 8th Ohio Cavalry) lost 3 officers and 53 enlisted men killed and mortally wounded, and 1 officer and 113 enlisted men by disease (for a total of 210).CWSS References * Stevens, Larry. 8th Ohio Cavalry, 1995. * 8th Ohio Regiment - Unit Bibliography, U.S. Army Military History Institute, 1995. * Civil War Soldiers and Sailors System Notes Further reading * Dyer, Frederick H., A Compendium of the War of the Rebellion, Vol. 2, Dayton: Morningside Press, 1979, p. 1478. *Reid, Whitelaw, Ohio in the War: Her Statesmen, Her Generals and Soldiers...., Vol. 2, Cincinnati, OH: Wilstach, Baldwin, 1872, pp. 804, 807. * St. John, Volney. \\"Men's Souls Were Tried,\\" National Tribune Scrapbook II, pp. 30, 32.

Family background  Casimir was born in Ansbach, as the son of Frederick I, Margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach and his wife Princess Sofia Jagiellon, a daughter of King Casimir IV Jagiellon of Poland. From 1498, Casimir's father Frederick granted him the position of stadtholder of the margraviate during his extensive travels. He ruled under the guidance of experienced advisors. In 1515, Casimir and his younger brother George deposed their father, who had greatly burdened the finances of the margraviate with his lavish lifestyle. Casimir then locked up his father at his residence at Plassenburg Castle, in a tower room from which his father could not escape for 12 years. He took up the rule of the Margraviate of Brandenburg-Kulmbach while his brother George ruled the Margraviate of Brandenburg-Ansbach. However, since his younger brother often stayed at the Hungarian royal court, Casimir ruled Brandenburg-Ansbach on his behalf. The overthrow of his father outraged Casimir's other brothers and led to far-reaching political countermeasures. When Elector Joachim I of Brandenburg visited Kulmbach during his journey to Augsburg, and wanted to plead for the release of Casimir's father, he was denied access to Plassenburg Castle. The Elector's brother, Albert of Brandenburg, then turned against him and sided with Emperor Charles V, and was rewarded with a cardinal's hat. The dispute was resolved when an agreement was reached in 1522, in which the demands of the other brothers of Casimir were met. Margrave Casimir died at Buda in 1527. At that point, his brother George took up the regency of Brandenburg-Kulmbach until Casimir's eldest son, Albert II Alcibiades, came of age in 1541.  Life  = Involvement in the Swabian League = Casimir was a vassal of Emperor Maximilian I and fought in 1499 alongside his father and Margrave Christopher I of Baden as the commander of the Swabian League against the Old Swiss Confederacy and led the negotiations that resulted in the Peace of Basel. In subsequent years, he continued to be active as a military leader and diplomat in Habsburg service. He participated in 1506 in Schwäbisch Hall against the Swabian League and in 1509 in the Diet at Worms. In 1513, he was imperial commissioner at the assembly of the Swabian League at Nördlingen dealing with a breach of the peace by Götz von Berlichingen. Casimir and Duke William IV of Bavaria jointly oversaw the conduct of the war. In 1519, he took part in federal measures against Ulrich of Württemberg; in May 1519, he commanded 700 knights advancing to Ehningen.Johann Heilmann: Kriegsgeschichte von Bayern, Franken, Pfalz und Schwaben von 1506 bis 1651, vol. 1. Munich, 1868, p. 10 = Disputes with the city of Nuremberg = Among the traditional arguments of the Burgraves and Margraves with the Imperial City of Nuremberg was a dispute in 1502 over the protection of the fair in Affalterbach. The City Council claimed to have to right to protect the enclave of Affalterbach itself and Casimir tried to prevent this. The situation developed in a political power game. Strong forces from Nuremberg had arrived in Affalterbach early. Casimir changed course and attacked suburbs of Nuremberg itself. The Nuremberg had to retreat from Affalterbach with heavy losses and surrender their banners, which were put on display in the church in Schwabach. This conflict has been immortalized in folk songs. Casimir was later embroiled in border disputes with Nuremberg. = Franconian war = Casimir had been a leader of the Swabian League since 1499. In 1522, however, he cancelled his membership, when it became apparent that the Imperial City of Nuremberg, traditionally an enemy of the Burgrave of Nuremberg, and later the Margraves of Nuremberg, intended to start a war against Thomas von Absberg and his allies. The Franconian War broke out in 1523, and several castles of the robber barons were destroyed. The war was documented by Hans Wandereisen in a series of woodcuts. = Peasants' War = Map of the spread of the riots during the German Peasants' War in 1525 The first actions of the German Peasants' War in 1525 were incursions into the neighboring Bishopric of Würzburg under Bishop Conrad II of Thüngen and into the Bishopric of Bamberg under Bishop Weigand of Redwitz. In the spring of 1525 Casimir and the neighboring princes met in Neustadt an der Aisch to discuss a common response to the riots that threatened to spill over from Swabia into the Odenwald. The discussions were attended by Casimir and the two bishops and the Prince Bishop of Eichstätt and by Count Albert of Hohenlohe- Neuenstein, George of Waldburg and the counts of Limburg, Wertheim, Henneberg and Castell. The proceedings were derailed by mistrust, caused by cheating at the boundaries of their principalities. Casimir opposed the Reformation, unlike his brother George, who supported it. The assault of the peasants and the Black Company overwhelmed the Bishopric of Würzburg. The bishop fled and the defenders retreated to the Fortress Marienberg in Würzburg. Under considerable financial and personal efforts, Casimir prepared to repel the incursions into his territory. He summoned his subjects to arms and hired mercenaries. The Margrave had the duty to protect the free imperial city of Rothenburg ob der Tauber. At Rothenburg, Casimir won his first victory over the peasants, and left the city with a rich booty. Shortly afterwards, however, the city council bowed for the citizens, who came to an arrangement with the peasants. The riots spread from Rothenburg into Casimir's territory, into the districts of Crailsheim, Lobenhausen-Anhausen, Werdeck-Gerabronn and Bamberg-Wiesenbach. Casimir withdrew to Ansbach and dug in. He tried to raise new troops in Upper Franconia, but they revolted. So Casimir was limited to using Bohemian mercenaries to defend his most fortified castles. The unorganized peasant armies were defeated in the Würzburg area by a coalition of the Swabian League and other allies of the bishop of Würzburg. Their resistance and morale collapsed due to their massive losses. Casimir, whose actions had earned him the nickname \\"Bloodhound\\", gained the upper hand. Rebel villages, most of whom surrendered without resistance, where pillaged and looted. Casimir also devastated villages in his own territory: he had entire villages burned down, and rebels were executed. Reportedly, he had 300 people killed in Feuchtwangen alone. In Kitzingen, he wanted to set an example: he promised the bailiff Louis von Hutten that the lives of the residents would be spared. After they surrendered, however, he punished them hard by chopping off their right hand index and middle fingers (the \\"oath fingers\\") and blinded them and sent them into exile. His \\"captain\\" Augistin stabbed the eyes of 58 people who had said they \\"wanted to see no more Margrave\\" before the rebellion. This act was even at the time seen as monstrous atrocities.Peter Blickle: Gemeindereformation: die Menschen des 16. Jahrhunderts auf dem Weg zum Heil (1987), page 82 He also punished Rothenburg and wrung territorial concessions from the city. Contemporary reports claim that the market squares of Rothenburg and Schweinfurt were dyed red by the blood of the beheaded rebels. Since Casimir was described as the imperial henchman, it can be assumed that he acted in accordance with the wishes of the Emperor or the Swabian League. He sent his brother John Albert to Bayreuth to punish the city for its lack of support when he was raising troops. He only ceased his punishments when it emerged in November 1526 that innocent people were affected as well. = Follower of the Habsburgs = By participating as Imperial Commissioner in the diets in Augsburg in December 1525 and in Speyer in August 1526, Casimir once again proved his loyalty to the Habsburg imperial family. At the coronation of the future German Emperor Ferdinand I as King of Bohemia in 1527, Casimir, who was seriously marked by disease, joined a military campaign in Hungary against John Zápolya. Because his brother George the Pious also joined, Casimir returned to appoint a stadtholder for their Franconian possessions and to raise additional troops. In July 1527, he reached the Hungarian border. The forts on the Danube surrendered to him, and he moved on to Buda. On 27 September 1527, he died of dysentery in Buda, in the presence of his brother George and King Ferdinand, to whom he entrusted the care of his five-year-old son Albert II Alcibiades. George ruled Brandenburg-Kulmbach while Albert was a minor. Theodore Hirsch concludes his biography with the statement that because of the atrocities Casimir committed, so far no biographer had written a balanced description of his life.  Marriage and issue  On 25 August 1518, Casimir married Susanna of Bavaria, the daughter of Duke Albert IV of Bavaria and Kunigunde of Austria. Emperor Maximilian I, the maternal uncle of the bride, also participated in the glamorous wedding in 1518, during the Diet of Augsburg. Casimir's close ties to the imperial family were visible again at the coronation of Emperor Charles V, where he was given the honor of being the First Cutter at the coronation dinner. Casimir and Susanna had five children: * Marie of Brandenburg- Kulmbach, married in 1557, Elector Palatine Frederick III (1515–1576). They were the parents of Louis VI, Elector Palatine. * Catherine of Brandenburg- Kulmbach (1520–1521) * Albert II Alcibiades, Margrave of Brandenburg-Kulmbach (1522–1557) * Kunigunde of Brandenburg-Kulmbach (1524–1558), married in 1551, Charles II, Margrave of Baden-Durlach (1529–1577). * Frederick of Brandenburg- Kulmbach (1525) Ancestry  References and sources  * Theodolinde von Paschwitz, Markgraf Kasimir.

Alma was featured as a recurring character from 1981 to 1982; however, she was reintroduced as a regular in 1988. She remained in the show for a further 13 years, featuring in high-profile storylines such as a problematic marriage to the long-running character Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs), kidnapping, and a supermarket siege. Barrie decided to leave the soap in 2001, and Alma was killed-off in a controversial cervical cancer storyline. Storylines Alma is first introduced in 1981 as the wife of cafe owner, Jim Sedgewick (Michael O'Hagan). The marriage is a disaster and when Alma falls pregnant a year later, she has an abortion rather than bring a child into their loveless home. Alma takes over Jim's Café after they divorce in 1982. She emigrates to Florida for a while with a pools winner named Phillip but when he squanders the money, Alma returns to Weatherfield. The character properly begins to make an impact when she takes a more active role in the management of the café in late 1988. This is the beginning of a long-running working relationship with Gail Tilsley (Helen Worth), who becomes Alma's business partner in 1989, until Alma sells her share to Roy Cropper (David Neilson) in 1996. Alma has a tempestuous on-off relationship with Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs). They date but he dumps her and marries Jackie Ingram (Shirin Taylor) in 1990. Alma then dates Mike's enemy, Ken Barlow (William Roache), but she is seduced by Mike after he decides he wants her back and her relationship with Ken dissolves. Alma and Mike marry in 1992. Alma is often the motherly, sympathetic, liberal- minded character in many storylines, particularly off-setting her husband Mike's often harsh and high-minded attitudes. Mike's patronising and chauvinistic mannerisms alienate Alma at times; she occasionally rebels, buying herself a 1979 MG Midget convertible and seeking employment against his wishes. Alma considers straying briefly with Stephen Reid (Todd Boyce) - son of Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls) and Gail's half-brother - in 1996. She makes a pass at him but is rebuffed and is hurt further when Mike responds with nonchalance to the incident. She is then caught up in the plight of Don Brennan (Geoffrey Hinsliff). Alma feels sympathy for Don after Mike sells him a garage business at a knowingly inflated price and then watches him go bankrupt. Don eventually has a breakdown, becoming obsessed with revenge on Mike. After attempting to frame Mike for arson and insurance fraud, he kidnaps Alma, driving her into the river in his taxi; both survive. His last act is to steal Alma's car and drive into the viaduct at the end of Coronation Street, killing himself. Alma and Mike separate in 1999 when Alma discovers that Mike has cheated on her; they eventually divorce and Alma moves in with Audrey. After finding employment at Freshco supermarket, Alma excels in the job and is promoted. She is involved in an armed siege there in 2000, coincidentally along with Mike and Ken amongst others, in which one gunman is shot dead by the police. Following this, Alma grows close to Frank, a security guard at Freshco. They consider moving away to be together but their happiness is cut short as in May 2001, Alma discovers that due to a missed smear test and a further misdiagnosis, she has inoperable terminal cervical cancer. Frank cannot face watching her die and leaves. Alma is supported by her friends, however, and opts to die at home with the people she loves. The cancer claims her life within weeks; Alma passes away at Audrey's home in Grasmere Drive on 17 June 2001, aged 55, with Mike and her friends surrounding her. Creation =Casting= Alma was introduced in 1981 as a recurring/guest character, the wife of café proprietor Jim Sedgewick. The role saw the return to mainstream television for actress Amanda Barrie, who was previously best known to viewers as Cleopatra in the 1964 comedy film Carry On Cleo. Barrie played Alma in a recurring role for several years, and then, after six years away from the show, she was asked to return as a regular character, Alma taking over control of the café she was given in her divorce settlement from Jim. Barrie has recalled that her first scene was opposite a Coronation Street \\"legend\\", Elsie Tanner, played by Pat Phoenix: \\"She came for a job at the café and I had to tell her she couldn't have one. That was quite scary. It was my first episode but I didn't think the Street took me to its heart because I wasn't called for another eight years. By that time, Jim had gone - I never actually met him!\\" After Alma's reintroduction as a regular, the British press labelled her as \\"the next Elsie Tanner\\", a comparison that Barrie refuted: \\"I think they always do that. There was only one Elsie Tanner, and I think they will go on looking.\\" Barrie has revealed that it was thanks to her mother that she was given a permanent role in Coronation Street. According to the actress, she \\"bombarded\\" Granada studio with calls pretending to be a series of fans requesting that Alma be brought back, even speaking directly with producer Bill Podmore. Development =Relationships= The character went into a business partnership with Gail Tilsey (Helen Worth), formed a close friendship with Audrey Roberts (Sue Nicholls), and had several romantic relationships most notably with Mike Baldwin (Johnny Briggs). Alma and Mike's romance stemmed back to 1989 and they wed on-screen in 1992, the marriage lasting seven years. It has been suggested in a 2006 ITV documentary that Mike, an antagonistic womanising character, met his match in Alma. William Roache who plays Ken Barlow has stated that of all Mike's many women in the serial, he always felt that Alma was Mike's true love, the one that was right and good for him. Briggs has stated that he always enjoyed watching the scenes between Mike and Alma, because Alma knew how to handle Mike. Barrie has discussed the way she approached playing the romance between Mike and Alma, suggesting that as Alma she treated Mike in the same way that she [Barrie] treated Briggs off- set, poking fun at him. Barrie has suggested that she and her co-star Sue Nicholls who plays Audrey Roberts share a friendship that emulates the screen friendship between their two characters. She commented, \\"Sue Nicholls, who plays Audrey Roberts, is one of my best friends in the Street. We're all so close that we instinctively know how each other is feeling on any given day and we even know how the others will play each scene. If I'm reading a script I can actually hear Sue's voice saying her part, and what expression she will use.\\" =Kidnapping= One of the character's most notable storylines was her kidnapping by Don Brennan (Geoffrey Hinsliff), who attempted to kill Alma by driving her into the River Irwell in a bid for revenge on Mike Baldwin. The events were screened in an hour long special in 1997. The episode ended on a cliffhanger and viewers were left guessing as to whether Alma and Don had survived the crash. Both characters survived, but the storyline marked the exit of Don, who had been written out of the soap. More than 15 million viewers watched the episode. =Departure= It was announced that Barrie had decided to leave the programme. She stated, \\"I thought it was about time I bowed out in the hope that there's one more show in me. I want to endlessly thank Granada and Coronation Street. I've had a very happy time and I feel blessed and proud to have been in the show. But everything has its time. I feel it's time to hand over to the youngsters in the show, who I think are so brilliant [...] I thought it was about time I bowed out. This is something I've been thinking about for ages but couldn't face up to the emotion of leaving or tear myself away.\\" Executive producer Jane Macnaught commented, \\"We are sorry to see Amanda go and wish her well for the future. She has been a much-loved character and we truly appreciate her loyalty and commitment to the show. I respect her decision and appreciate that she feels she has to move on. We will now work on an exciting exit for the character.\\" Producers opted to kill off Alma in the serial with terminal cervical cancer, which had already spread to her other organs before detection. A source reported to The Mirror, \\"we believe Alma's sad death has every ingredient to make it one of the all- time Coronation Street greats.\\" As a precursor to the storyline, Alma had begun a romance with a security guard Frank O'Connor (Eamon Boland) and both had decided to leave Weatherfield to begin a new life together. Discussing the storyline, the source said, \\"Alma agrees to go and live with Frank. They decide to make a new start together somewhere in the country and begin excitedly telling their plans to people back home. Alma has had her fair share of ups and downs with men in the past and she sees Frank a dependable chap to see out her days with. There's even a surprise farewell party planned at the Rovers. But just as it looks as if they are off into the wide blue yonder the devastating news hits Alma.\\" In the scripts, Alma was faced with a choice, leave Weatherfield, or remain and die with her friends. The source added, \\"Alma is wrestling with her innermost thoughts about what to do for the best. She is agonising about starting a new life away from Weatherfield with Frank and his children Joe and Danny. But it is Audrey who tells her that she should stay amongst her friends who will be able to nurse her when the time comes. After a lot of hard thinking Alma realises that she will be better off staying with the people who have known and loved her. So she makes the emotional decision to remain with her friends until she dies. We have had some tear- jerking episodes in the past, and Alma's farewell will have to rank as one of the most sorrowful in Corrie's history.\\" An estimated 15 million viewers tuned in to see Alma's death on-screen. It was reported that a power surge occurred at the episode's climax as there was a 1000 megawatt demand on the National Grid as more than 400,000 kettles were switched on by viewers after the episode. A National Grid spokesman said \\"Soaps normally average between 400 and 600 megawatts, so it was a considerable increase.\\" Cancer Research UK was critical of the cervical cancer\\"c storyline. They suggested that the writers tried to write the disease around the plot rather than the other way around, leading to unrealistic depiction of cancer. A spokesman for Coronation Street responded in defence of the storyline, saying that Alma's cancer progressed so quickly as she had missed a smear test, and the storyline did have a positive impact on female viewers, resulting in a significant increase in smear testing in the UK. However, a British Medical Journal paper in 2003 warned that the storyline could have unduly worried audiences and placed a burden on the National Health Service (NHS).

Col. L. F. R. Fell, who was one of the designers). It was the joint production of Davey Paxman & Co, Shell Refining & Marketing Co and Lt-Col L. F. R. Fell, built for them by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway at Derby. Sir Harry Ricardo was also involved. By the time it emerged in 1950, nationalisation had taken place and it carried British Railways livery. The locomotive had six diesel engines, four of them used for traction. There were two auxiliary engines, both of which were AEC 6-cylinder units, and these drove the pressure-chargers for the main engines and the purpose of this arrangement was to enable the main engines to deliver very high torque at low crankshaft speed. Design The design for 10100, a collaboration between Fell Developments Ltd and H. G. Ivatt of the LMS, aimed to address several of the weaknesses perceived of diesel powered rail traction. Weight was reduced by using several small engines, meaning that both the engines and their supporting structure could be lighter. This was also expected to save time in maintenance as an individual diesel engine could be exchanged more easily and with lighter equipment. Transmission Using differential gearing to transmit the power, it was built as a 4-8-4 with the coupling rods connecting the centre four pairs of driving wheels. The coupling rods between the innermost axles were later removed, but as the four axles were driven by a single gearbox, it remained a 4-8-4. At it was the most powerful of BR's non-steam locomotives at the time. From 1951 it worked the expresses from Manchester to London, proving some 25% more powerful than 5XP 4-6-0s.Bentley, C. (1997) British Railways Operating History: Volume 1, The Peak District, Carnarvon: XPress Publishing While the mechanical transmission made it much lighter than the diesel-electric locomotives, its complicated mechanism made it difficult to maintain (a working model of the transmission is on display at the National Railway Museum, York). The locomotive had four main engines. Each engine was connected to the gearbox via a hydraulic coupling, which could be filled with oil to transmit power or drained to disconnect that engine from the transmission. One-way clutches prevented rotation of the input shafts when the couplings were drained. The engine outputs were combined in pairs by two sets of differential gearing, and the output shafts from these two gearsets were then combined by a third differential gearset to drive the main output shaft. The effect of this arrangement was that the gear ratio between an engine and the output shaft depended on how many engines were driving the transmission. Gear ratio selection was accomplished not by \\"changing gear\\" in the conventional sense, but by filling or draining the hydraulic couplings to connect or disconnect the engines from the transmission. With only one hydraulic coupling filled with oil and the other three engines disconnected and their respective input shafts to the transmission locked by the one-way clutches, the single engine drove the output shaft through an effective gear ratio of 4:1. With two engines driving, the effective gear ratio was 2:1; with three engines, 1.33:1; and with all four engines, unity. In other words, the effective gear ratio of the transmission was the inverse of the number of engines driving it. Unlike the transmission of a car, there was no overall torque-multiplication effect from selecting a lower gear. The 4:1 mechanical advantage afforded to the single engine driving in first gear was cancelled out by the fact that there was only one engine operating, so the maximum output torque from the transmission was the same as was available in top gear with all four engines operating. The same argument applies to second and third gears. The transmission of this locomotive, therefore, unlike almost all other locomotive transmissions, did not provide any means of matching the torque characteristics of the engine(s) to the requirements of the locomotive; it did not provide for an increased torque output at low speeds for starting and hill climbing. It served only to match the output speed of the engine(s) to the requirements of the locomotive. The requirement for high starting torque was met in the Fell not by the transmission characteristics but by altering the torque characteristics of the engines themselves. Normally a diesel engine aspires charge at a mass flow rate proportional to its rotational speed; the faster it rotates, the more charge it can aspire, and this leads to a power output curve which rises more or less linearly with rotational speed until various limiting factors become significant. The Fell Diesel south of Belper on a Manchester-London express In the Fell locomotive, however, the four main drive engines received their charge from Roots blowers driven by two further auxiliary engines which were governed such that when the traction power demand was more than minimal, they operated at essentially a constant speed. Since a Roots blower is a positive-displacement device, this meant that the mass flow rate at which charge was delivered to the main engines depended not on the speed of the main engines but on that of the auxiliary engines, so the power output of the main engines was essentially defined by the speed of the auxiliary engines. Since the speed of the auxiliary engines was held constant, the main engines had a power curve which was constant with rotational speed; since power is the product of torque and rotational speed, the main engines were endowed with a torque curve inversely proportional to speed, producing maximum torque at a low speed and reducing as the speed increased. Thus was provided the necessary increased low-speed torque output for starting and hill climbing.Technical details of the locomotive Withdrawal In July 1952, 10100's gearbox was severely damaged after a loose bolt fell through the geartrain, and the locomotive was out of service for over a year. British Railways subsequently lost interest in the project, and an improved version of the locomotive under development was abandoned. 10100 remained in service until 16 October 1958, when its steam heating boiler caught fire at . It was returned to Derby Works, where it was slowly stripped of parts before being scrapped in July 1960.Derby Through the Diesel Years 1947 - 1972  See also  * Paxman Hi-Dyne engine References  Further reading   External links *Photo of 'The Fell Locomotive - 10100' *Richard Carr's Paxman History Pages *Photo of Lt.

The two \\"Bulgarian Empires\\" are not treated as separate entities, but rather as one state restored after a period of Byzantine rule over its territory. First Bulgarian Empire Kanasubigi Omurtag (814–831) Not long after the Slavic incursion, Moesia was once again invaded, this time by the Bulgars under Khan Asparukh. Their horde was a remnant of Old Great Bulgaria, an extinct tribal confederacy situated north of the Black Sea in what are now parts of Ukraine and Russia. Asparukh attacked Byzantine territories in Moesia and conquered the Slavic tribes there in 680. A peace treaty with the Byzantine Empire was signed in 681, marking the foundation of the First Bulgarian Empire on the territory both north and south of the lower course of the Danube River as an alliance between the ruling Bulgars and the numerous Slavs in the area, becoming the oldest still existing Slavic state. The minority Bulgars formed a close-knit ruling caste. It is usually described as having lasted between 681A Concise History of Bulgaria, R. J.

During Krum’s reign in the early 9th century, Bulgarian territory doubled in size, spreading from the middle Danube to the Dnieper and from Odrin to the Tatra Mountains. His able and energetic rule brought law and order to Bulgaria and developed the rudiments of state organization.Krum, Encyclopædia Britannica OnlineТокушев, Д. \\"История на българската средновековна държава и право\\", Сиби, С. 2009 Bulgaria gradually reached its cultural and territorial apogee in the 9th century and early 10th century under Prince Boris I and Emperor Simeon the Great, when its early Christianization in 864 allowed it to develop into the cultural and literary center of Slavic Europe, as well as one of the largest states in Europe, thus the period is considered the Golden Age of medieval Bulgarian culture. Major events included the development of the Cyrillic script at the Preslav Literary School, declared official in 893, and the establishment of the liturgy in Old Church Slavonic, also called Old Bulgarian. Second Bulgarian Empire The medieval Bulgarian state was restored as the Second Bulgarian Empire after a successful uprising of two nobles from Tarnovo, Asen and Peter, in 1185, and existed until it was conquered during the Ottoman invasion of the Balkans in the late 14th century, with the date of its subjugation usually given as 1396, although some fringe views place it at 1422.http://liternet.bg/publish13/p_pavlov/konstantin_II_asen.htm Until 1256, the Second Bulgarian Empire was the dominant power in the Balkans, defeating the Byzantine Empire in several major battles. In 1205, Emperor Kaloyan defeated the newly established Latin Empire in the Battle of Adrianople. His nephew Ivan Asen II defeated the Despotate of Epiros and made Bulgaria a regional power again. During his reign, Bulgaria spread from the Adriatic to the Black Sea and the economy flourished. Under Ivan Asen II in the first half of the 13th century the country gradually recovered much of its former power, though this did not last long due to internal problems and foreign invasions. Bulgarian artists and architects created their own distinctive style. Until the 14th century, during the period known as the Second Golden Age of Bulgarian culture, literature, art and architecture flourished. The capital city Tarnovo, which was considered a \\"New Constantinople\\", became the country's main cultural hub and the centre of the Eastern Orthodox world.Obolensky, p. 246 The Empire became tributary to the Golden Horde, a successor state of the Mongol Empire in the 13th to 14th centuries.Peter Jackson, The Mongols and the West, p. 204Denis Sinor, \\"The Mongols in the West\\", Journal of Asian History v. 33 n. 1 (1999). After the death of Emperor Ivan Alexander in 1371 Bulgaria was split into three countries and in the following decades fell under the domination of the Ottomans. In 1393 after siege Tarnovo was conquered by the Ottoman Empire and in 1396 Vidin (Бъдин) kingdom was defeated. After the Ottoman conquest, many Bulgarian clerics and scholars emigrated to Serbia, Wallachia, Moldavia, and Russian principalities, where they introduced Bulgarian culture, books, and hesychastic ideas.

Zeng Jing, a failed degree candidate heavily influenced by the seventeenth-century scholar Lü Liuliang, in October 1728 attempted to incite the descendant of Yue Fei, Yue Zhongqi (岳仲琪), Governor-general of Shaanxi-Sichuan, to rebellion. He gave a long list of accusations against Yongzheng, including the murder of the Kangxi Emperor and the killing of his brothers. This triggered a series of investigations which captured the attention of Yongzheng, who was eager to make his ascent to the throne seem legitimate. Highly concerned with the implications of the case, Yongzheng had Zeng Jing brought to Beijing for trial. But instead of imposing an immediate death sentence, the emperor began an intensive, written conversation with Zeng Jing. Zeng Jing eventually wrote a confession of error and received pardon for his crimes. The emperor then decided to circulate the relevant documents, including the original note, nationwide as a civics lesson for his subjects. However, Yongzheng's sudden death in 1735 caused a turn of events as the Qianlong Emperor, Yongzheng's successor, sensitive to the potentially defamatory material that was making its rounds across the country, went against his father's wishes in recalling and destroying his father's response, the Dayi Juemi Lu (大義覺迷錄; literally: \\"Records of great righteousness resolving confusion\\"), as well as executing Zeng.

The company had more than 20 principal operations and manufacturing facilities worldwide with products sold in more than 100 countries. Its major markets include the United States, Europe, Latin America and Asia-Pacific. The company was named after Jude the Apostle, the patron saint of lost causes. St. Jude Medical was founded in 1976 and went public in 1977, and the company has been listed in the Fortune 500 every year since 2010. The company was acquired by Abbott Laboratories in January 2017.https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-04-28/abbott-agrees-to-buy- st-jude-medical- for-25-billionhttps://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2016-04-28/abbott-st-jude- combination-why-it-makes-sense Michael T. Rousseau served as the company's president and chief executive officer from 2016 until its acquisition by Abbott History =Early history= St. Jude Medical was founded in 1976 to further develop bi-leaflet artificial heart valves, which were originally created in 1972 at the University of Minnesota. St. Jude Medical's bi-leaflet valve was developed in large part by Dr. Demetre Nicoloff of the University of Minnesota and St. Jude Medical employee Don Hanson. Company founder Manny Villafana took St. Jude Medical public In February 1977. In October of that year, Dr. Nicoloff implanted the company's first artificial heart valve in a human patient. St. Jude Medical's new heart valve was coated in pyrolytic carbon, which helped the valve prevent blood clotting. St. Jude Medical founding chief operating officer LaVerne Rees became chief executive officer in 1981. Shortly after his appointment as St. Jude Medical CEO, Rees directed the company to begin development of its own carbon coating. This decision led to a legal battle with CarboMedics, the sole supplier of carbon coating for the company's heart valves. The St. Jude Medical board reassigned Rees in late 1984 after the legal dispute continued. In 1985, Lawrence Lehmkuhl replaced Rees as president and CEO of St. Jude Medical. Lehmkuhl had previously served as a division president at American Hospital Supply Corporation. Shortly after the appointment, St. Jude Medical settled its lawsuit with CarboMedics. The two companies also entered into an agreement that allowed St. Jude Medical to continue developing and producing limited quantities of its own carbon coating. In 1986, the first St. Jude Medical heart valve created with the company’s own carbon coating technology was implanted into a human in Germany. Later that year, St. Jude Medical expanded into tissue heart valves with its acquisition of BioImplant. =1990s= The company established its International Division, located in Brussels, Belgium, in 1990. In April 1991, St. Jude Medical engaged in a joint venture with Hancock Jaffe Laboratories to create Heart Valve Company. The joint venture was formed to design and market new tissue heart valves for the American market. The first Heart Valve Company tissue heart valve was implanted in a human patient in 1994. In March 1993, Ronald Matricaria, a former president of Eli Lilly & Company's North American division, replaced Lehmkuhl as president and CEO of St. Jude Medical. Lehmkuhl, who had presided over a ninefold increase in annual sales during his tenure as CEO, was named chairman of the St. Jude Medical board. Matricaria pushed for increasing diversification and expanded St. Jude Medical's acquisition hunt. In June 1994, the company announced that it would acquire the Pacesetter, Inc., the heart pacemaker division of Siemens AG, for $500 million. At the time of its acquisition by St. Jude Medical, Pacesetter was the second largest pacemaker manufacturer worldwide. In January 1996, St. Jude Medical further diversified its business when it acquired Minnetonka, Minnesota-based Daig Corporation for $425 million. Daig Corporation manufactured cardiac catheters for diagnostic and therapeutic uses. Also in January of that year, St. Jude Medical became the sole owner of Heart Valve Company when it purchased Hancock Jaffe Laboratories' 50% share in the joint venture. St. Jude Medical acquired Biocor Industria, a Brazilian manufacturer of tissue heart valves, in September 1996. In 1997, St. Jude Medical acquired Ventritex, a Sunnyvale, California-based manufacturer of implantable cardioverter-defibrillators for $352 million. At the time of its acquisition, Ventritex was the third-largest manufacturer of defibrillators. In February 1999, St. Jude Medical acquired Tyco International's Angio-Seal business. Angio-Seal manufactured collagen-based plugs to close arterial holes made during arterial catheter procedures. Matricaria stepped down as St. Jude Medical CEO in March 1999. He was replaced by Terry Shepherd, who had served as president of St. Jude Medical's heart valve business since 1994. Matricaria retained chairmanship of the St. Jude Medical board. =2000s= In 2004, St. Jude Medical CEO Terry Shepherd retired. The company's stock had increased 277% during his tenure as CEO. St. Jude Medical COO Daniel Starks was appointed to replace Shepherd as the company's CEO. Starks had previously served as chief executive officer of Daig Corporation from 1986-1996, when St. Jude Medical acquired the company. Starks had been retained by St. Jude Medical and had served as company chief operating officer since 2001. In January 2005, St. Jude Medical acquired Saint Paul, Minnesota-based Endocardial Solutions for $272 million. Endocardial Solutions manufactured diagnostic and therapeutic devices used to treat atrial fibrillation. Later that year the company acquired Plano, Texas-based Advanced Neuromodulation Systems for $1.3 billion. At the time of its acquisition, Advanced Neuromodulation Systems was the second-largest supplier of devices that use electrotherapy to treat chronic pain and nerve disorders. In 2008, St. Jude Medical acquired MediGuide, an Israeli company that developed technology that uses tiny sensors to locate medical devices inside of a patient's body and increase the amount of information available to a doctor during medical procedures. =2010s= St. Jude Medical acquired AGA Medical for $1.3 billion in October 2010. AGA Medical was a Plymouth, Minnesota-based company that manufactured products that treat heart defects, including plugs and patches that fix holes and other cardiac defects. In 2010 the company also acquired LightLab Imaging, a company that developed optical coherence tomography technology that helps doctors treat heart disease. In 2010, St. Jude Medical invested in an option to acquire CardioMEMS Inc., a medical device company that developed a wireless sensing and communication technology to monitor pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) in heart failure patients. CardioMEMS Inc. was acquired by St. Jude Medical in May 2014. In August 2012, St. Jude Medical reorganized its business operations. The company folded its four product divisions into two operating units: the implantable electronic systems division; and the cardiovascular and ablation technologies division. The company also centralized other functions including the marketing, information technology and legal departments. St. Jude Medical's reorganization coincided with layoffs of about 5% of the company's global workforce. In 2013, St. Jude Medical acquired Endosense, a Swiss company that developed a catheter that measures the force a doctor places on a patient's heart wall during a catheter ablation procedure. St. Jude Medical paid $330 million for the company. In June 2013, St. Jude Medical entered into a series of agreements under which the company made a $40 million equity investment in Spinal Modulation, Inc. In May 2015, the company completed the acquisition of Spinal Modulation, developer of the Axium Neurostimulator System. St. Jude Medical acquired Nanostim Inc., a Sunnyvale, California-based privately owned developer of miniaturized, leadless pacemakers, for $123.5 million in October 2013. The acquisition followed the approval of Nanostim's leadless pacemaker by the European Union. St. Jude Medical had secured the exclusive right to acquire Nanostim with a May 2011 investment in the start-up. St. Jude Medical continued the restructuring it started in 2014 with its consolidation of the company's two operating units—the implantable electronic systems and the cardiovascular and ablation technologies units—into single research and development division. The company also consolidated its worldwide manufacturing and supply chain operations into a second division. In July 2015, the company announced its intention to acquire heart-device manufacturer Thoratec Corporation for $3.4 billion. The acquisition was completed in October 2015.\\"St. Jude Medical Completes Acquisition of Thoratec\\". Business Wire. October 8, 2015. In September 2015, St. Jude Medical announced that Daniel Starks would retire as chairman, president, and chief executive officer. On January 1, 2016, Michael T. Rousseau succeeded Starks as president, CEO and a member of the St. Jude Medical Board of Directors. Starks would remain executive chairman of the board of directors. In late April 2016, Abbott Laboratories announced it would acquire St. Jude Medical for $25 billion ($46.75 in cash & 0.8708 shares of Abbott common stock, equating to an approximate value of $85 per share). On January 5, 2017, Abbott announced that it had completed its $25 billion acquisition of St. Jude Medical. =Acquisition history= The following is an illustration of the company's major mergers and acquisitions and historical predecessors (this is not a comprehensive list): Operations St. Jude Medical manufactures implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICD); pacemakers; electrophysiology catheters; vascular closure products; cardiac mapping and visualization systems; optical coherence tomography (OCT) imaging systems; structural heart repair products; and neurostimulation devices. The company's operations are divided into two divisions: research and development; and manufacturing and supply chain. St. Jude Medical also operates six technology centers located in Brussels, Belgium, Beijing, China, Tokyo, Japan, Austin, Texas, St. Paul, Minnesota and Sylmar, California. These centers offer training to physicians and allow them to simulate patient procedures using St. Jude Medical devices and technologies. Products The company also manufactures implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (ICDs) and implanted cardiac resynchronization devices (CRT-Ds). The ICDs and CRT-Ds use quadripolar lead technology, which utilizes four electrodes on a single lead to pace multiple locations on the left side of the heart. In 2013, the company began marketing the Ilumen Optis device, which is a diagnostic and assessment tool for patients with coronary artery disease. The device uses fractional flow reserve for measuring intra- arterial pressure and optical coherence tomography technology, which allows doctors to visually examine inside a patient's arteries. Technology =MediGuide= St. Jude Medical produces MediGuide, a cardiac navigation and visualization technology that provides real-time fluoroscopic images. The system also gives doctors the ability to locate devices that are implanted with MediGuide-enabled sensors. MediGuide reduces the duration of a patients' radiation exposure during cardiovascular procedures. =Nanostim= In October 2013, the company acquired and began developing Nanostim leadless pacemakers. Nanostim technology consists of a miniaturized pacemaker implanted by a percutaneous, catheter-based procedure and placed into the heart. They are designed without the requirement for a lead, the thin wires inserted through a vein which connect the generator to the heart, or surgical pocket. =CardioMEMS= In June 2014, St. Jude Medical acquired and began developing CardioMEMS HF System, a wireless pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) monitoring technology. The wireless monitoring technology is used to assess cardiac performance via measurement of PAP and can be placed into the pulmonary artery. Controversies In December 2010, St. Jude Medical voluntarily stopped selling its Riata and Riata ST line of defibrillator leads over concerns that the leads were susceptible to insulation abrasion. The Food and Drug Administration issued a recall of the leads in November 2011. In May 2013, Population Health Research Institute (PHRI), an academic health science research institute, conducted an independent analysis of data received from ongoing prospective registries that monitor the performance of the Durata and Riata ST ICD leads. The results of the analysis found that the insulated leads had a 99.8 percent rate of freedom from all-cause insulation abrasion at 5 years. In January 2013, the Food and Drug Administration sent St. Jude Medical a warning letter detailing concerns regarding processes at the company's Sylmar, California facility. The letter was sent following inspections of the plant in September and October 2012. The letter did not raise any safety concerns about St. Jude Medical products. That same month the company sent the Food and Drug Administration a 34-page letter detailing the company's efforts to correct problems found during the October inspection. In 2014 a security vulnerability in St. Jude's pacemakers was reported by MedSec Holdings Ltd and confirmed by the FDA.

It lies to the east of Derry and to the west of Limavady on the main A2 coast road between Limavady and Derry, overlooking Lough Foyle. It is designated as a Large Village and in the 2001 Census it had a population of 1,229 people, an increase of almost 20% compared to 1991. It is situated within Causeway Coast and Glens district. History The village lies mostly within the townlands of Gresteel More and Gresteel Beg. The name \\"Greysteel\\" may be a part-translation of the Irish Glas-stiall, meaning \\"grey strip (of land)\\",Placenames NI: Gresteel Beg and the Placenames Database of Ireland gives this as the Irish name of the village. An older English name for the area was \\"Glasteele\\". =The Troubles= During the Troubles, nine people were killed in the Greysteel area: *On 14 November 1976, Jim Loughrey was shot dead by loyalists at his home. *On 30 October 1993, members of the Ulster Defence Association carried out a mass shooting at the Rising Sun public house, killing eight civilians. This became known as the Greysteel massacre. Features Until relatively recently, the village had limited local facilities, with a modest sized general shop, a few other retail units, a primary school, a Gaelic club with playing fields and several public houses. However, the recent construction of the Vale Centre, developed by Greysteel Community Enterprise, a local development group, includes a range of commercial/industrial units and playing fields and has improved the situation. A range of activities is available in the Centre, including an after school club, adult learning centre and sports facilities. Commercial facilities in the Centre, provide an opportunity for small business start-ups and a further 10 units are currently under construction. The village has grown considerably during the Post War period, mostly through new public sector housing up to the 1970s, and subsequently through considerable private housing development. Places of interest *Nearby Faughanvale Old church dates back to the medieval period and is dedicated to Saint Canice. Transport The village is adequately served in terms of public transport and City of Derry Airport is located 4 km to the west. Sport *Faughanvale GAC is the local Gaelic Athletic Association club.  2001 Census  Greysteel is classified as a village by the NI Statistics and Research Agency (NISRA) (i.e. with a population between 1,000 and 2,250 people). On Census day (29 April 2001) there were 1,229 people living in Greysteel. Of these: *25.4% were aged under 16 years and 11.7% were aged 60 and over *50.2% of the population were male and 49.8% were female *96.6% were from a Catholic background and 2.9% were from a Protestant background *0.8% of people aged 16–74 were unemployed.

He was a younger son of Sir John Osborn, 2nd Baronet. Naval career Osborn joined the Royal Navy as a volunteer in 1710. He was promoted lieutenant in 1717, and his first command was HMS Squirrel in 1728. On 14 May 1729, Osborn was appointed the first commodore-governor of Newfoundland, when Lord Vere Beauclerk, the naval commander of Newfoundland had declined. He visited all of the notable places on the island and divided it into six districts. Within each of the districts he appointed magistrates and constables. He served as Port Admiral at Portsmouth from 1756 to 1757. In 1757, he was promoted Admiral of the Blue and appointed Commander-in-Chief, Mediterranean Fleet. =Battle of Cartagena= In late 1757 Osborn besieged the neutral port of Cartagena in Spain where a French squadron designed to go to the relief of Louisbourg had taken shelter. While there he attacked a small French squadron under Michel- Ange Duquesne de Menneville which was coming to the aid of the trapped force. Two French ships were captured, including Duquesne's flagship and it indirectly led to the successful British capture of Louisbourg later that year. The battle helped to restore the Royal Navy's reputation following the failed attempt to relieve Minorca two years earlier which had led to Admiral Byng's execution. On 1 January 1763, he received the honorific post of Vice- Admiral of Great Britain. He entered Parliament in late 1758 for Bedfordshire in a by-election, sitting until 1761.

Description The trail is built on part of the abandoned right-of-way of the City and Suburban Railway. On the southern end, the trail begins at the end of Rhode Island Avenue, where it intersects with Farragut Street in Hyattsville. It then travels along the west side of the railroad tracks into the town of Riverdale Park, to the Riverdale Park Railroad station before moving away from the railroad through the \\"Riverdale Park Station\\" mixed-use development. It then crosses into the town of College Park and follows the right-of-way alongside and through the median of existing sections of Rhode Island Avenue to Calvert Street, where it becomes a sidepath alongside the avenue. At Rossborough lane, the trail resumes and, across Campus Drive, it is shared by the Paint Branch Trail of the Anacostia Tributary Trail System for a short distance. The trail is on-road between Pierce Avenue and Berwyn House Road before resuming. The last piece of trail passes through the Berwyn Neighborhood Playground on its way to the northern trailhead at Greenbelt Road. Note, the north end from Paducah St/Edgewood Rd to Greenbelt Rd in College Park is no longer considered part of the Trolley Trail, as it is a fully on-road bike lane. Similarly, the south end dedicated trail extension, from Farragut St to Charles Armentrout Drive in Hyattsville, is planned to connect with the Anacostia River Trail and the Northwest Branch Trail, is not yet a functional section of the trail as there is no on-road sharrow signage. History The right of way was originally Route 82 of the streetcar system of Washington, DC. The section used by the trail was built by the City and Suburban Railway in 1899. The full line stretched from New York Avenue and 15th St NW in Washington, DC to Berwyn at Greenbelt Road, where a turn table was built and was extended to Laurel, Maryland in 1902. City and Suburban operated cars on the line until 1926 when it was absorbed by the Washington Railway and Electric Company which in 1933 became part of Capital Transit and in 1955 DC Transit. During that time the line was shortened, running only to Beltsville by 1948 and only to Berwyn by 1956. In 1956, Congress decided to replace the streetcars with buses and on September 7, 1958 the last streetcar ran the route. The first section of the trail, a long stretch north from Campus Drive (formerly known as Paint Branch Parkway) to Greenbelt Road in College Park, opened in 2002. A second long section north to Paducah Road - no longer considered part of the trail - opened in 2005. In 2007, a third section south of the existing trail from Calvert Road to Albion Road in Riverdale Park opened. This part was originally called the College Park Trolley Trail. Then in 2008 a plan was formed to extend the trail south to Riverdale and Hyattsville and rebrand it as the Rhode Island Avenue Trolley Trail. In 2012 work on the southern extension began with a five block long section from Madison to Hamilton in Hyattsville which was built as part of the EYA Arts District development. In 2014 that section was extended south to Farragut and north to Queensberry road by M-NCPPC. By 2016, that segment was extended north to Tuckerman Street. In November 2017, the first of the Riverdale Station sections, from Albion Road to 47th Street and from Tuckerman to just south of Van Buren opened. In November 2018, the short section from 47th Street to Woodberry Street in Hyattsville was completed and opened. A small section from Woodberry to just south of Van Buren is yet to be built. During the construction of the southern portion, parts of the northern portion were improved. In 2011, a new trail crossing at Campus Drive was constructed. In 2013, the trail gap between Calvert Road and Campus Drive was closed when a segment was built as a sidepath along Rhode Island Avenue. In early 2017, a section of the sound barrier south of Campus Drive was removed to allow the trail to pass straight through rather than divert around the barrier. The final sections, from Farragut Street to Charles Armentrout Drive in Hyattsville, as well as the Greenbelt Rd-University Boulevard pedestrian- crossing extension in College Park, are still in the planning phase. In late 2017, wayfinding signage kiosks and a formal website were created.

They had been designed by Oliver Bulleid for the Southern Railway and were authorised in February 1947 but did not appear until after nationalisation. The diesel engine and transmission were supplied by English Electric, but the Bulleid influence was obvious. The box-like body style closely resembled Bulleid's electric locomotives and was quite different from the usual English Electric style, typified by British Rail Class D16/1 which in turn was stongly influenced by contemporary american design. Unusually for pioneer British diesels, 10201 and 10202 were originally specified (prior to alteration of gear ratios to improve tractive effort when operating as mixed-traffic units) with a top speed of rather than the of 10203, pre-dating the three-figure maximum speeds of the Deltic and Class 50 designs by some years. Percy Bollen's bogie design and the power train of 10203 were taken almost unmodified for the first ten production British Rail Class 40s but with a more traditional English Electric design of body with prominent noses and louvred side panels. Operation 10203 at Wolverton, in 1957 The original locomotives, numbered 10201 and 10202, worked services on the Southern Region of British Railways.

All three locomotives were non-standard with regards to spare parts and servicing and they were withdrawn at the end of 1963. After spending some time on the scrap line at Derby Litchurch Lane Works they were eventually scrapped at Cashmore's at Great Bridge in 1968.

He was also a writer and one of the founders of the Bulgarian Literature Society (BLS; now known as the Bulgarian Academy of Sciences) in 1869.History of Bulgarian Academy of Sciences Education He was born in Shumen, where a village now bears his given nameMap of Vasil Drumev village in a craftsman family. Originally, he was taught in his native town by Sava Dobroplodni and Sava Filaretov, but afterwards attended the Odessa Seminary. He was influenced by the revolutionary Georgi Sava Rakovski and joined Rakovski's First Bulgarian Legion in Belgrade in 1861, where he distinguished himself in the fight against the Turkish garrison. Drumev kept close ties with Vasil Levski, Stefan Karadzha and some other Bulgarian revolutionaries. After the Legion disbanded in 1862, Kliment emigrated in Russia, where he continued his education at the Kiev seminary. In 1869 he settled in Brăila. In 1873 he was ordained priest, and in the ensuing year he was ordained a bishop under the name Clement Branitski. He later became deputy of the metropolitan bishop in Tulcha. After the Liberation of Bulgaria in 1878, Drumev worked as rector of the Peter-Paul seminary near Lyaskovets. In 1884 he was chosen to be metropolitan bishop of Turnovo. Government career Drumev also took part in the socio-political life in the Principality - he was a deputy in the Constituent assembly in 1879 and in the First Grand National Assembly that year. Drumev was a supporter of Russia and opposed openly the foreign policy of the Regency (1886–1887), the first Stefan Stambolov regime (1887–1894) and Prince Ferdinand's regime, which led to repressive measures against him. Although a fairly reluctant political figure, in 1879 Kliment agreed to become Prime Minister on a caretaker basis until elections could be held to fill the vacancy following the collapse of the government of Todor Burmov.Richard J. Crampton, Bulgaria 1878–1918 A History, New York: Columbia University Press, 1983, p. 43 Kliment government was largely inactive, serving only to continue the policies of Burmov until a successor could be appointed. He served a very brief second term in 1886 after the 9 August coup d'état in an attempt to co-ordinate opposition to the enforced abdication of Alexander of Bulgaria, although before long Stefan Stambolov and Petko Karavelov had taken over.S.G. Evans, A Short History of Bulgaria, London, Lawrence and Wishart, 1960, p. 135 Indeed, Turnovski's involvement in the plot even led to Stambolov declaring him an outlaw briefly. A loyal supporter of the old monarchy, Kliment refused to celebrate the arrival of the new monarch Ferdinand I of Bulgaria, and refused to lead prayers for his arrival in Sofia.Crampton, op cit, p. 133 Stambolov moved against Kliment and expelled him from Sofia, whilst depriving him of much of his power.Crampton, op cit, p. 134 A strong supporter of Russia, he remained a harsh critic of the new King, although ultimately even his own flock turned against him and he was detained by the government. He was eventually released and publicly made peace with Ferdinand.Crampton, op cit, pp. 163-4 With Russia trusting Kliment, in summer 1895 he headed the Bulgarian parliamentary delegation in Saint Petersburg which had to reconcile Bulgaria with Russia, which terminated their official relations in November 1886. His mission was successful. But when he saw that Ferdinand was still not changing his attitude towards Russia, Kliment took pity on his own actions, because they helped Ferdinand to be recognized as a legal Bulgarian ruler.Crampton, op, cit, pp. 167-8 Writer As a writer, Kliment was father of Bulgarian fiction. He wrote the first original short story in Bulgarian, A Woeful Family (1860). Some of his important works include Student and benefactors or what is another's is another's (1864) and the drama Ivanko, the killer of Asen I (1872).

Lee was born in Ban Houei Kouang, Muong Mok, Xieng Khouang, Laos. In 1961, his family was displaced by the civil war and they joined other Hmong refugees in the city of Vientiane. He excelled in a Lao school system run by the French, and had hopes of attending college in France. In 1965, after winning a Colombo Plan scholarship, he traveled to Australia instead to finish high school Lee confesses that he was taken aback by a country and a schooling system so different from the French model under which he had been previously educated. Sports were emphasized and valued, he says, perhaps even more than academic skill. Nonetheless, upon finishing high school in 1969, Lee enrolled at the University of New South Wales. \\"I chose social work because every time I came home, there were all these poor, starving refugees with nowhere to go, and no food,\\" said Lee in a 2005 interview. \\"I thought I might be able to do something for them, but . . . after I did two years of social work, it’s all about . . . case work, working on advising people on how to sort out their personal problems. And I thought, ‘How can I do this in Laos? There are thousands of starving people! I can’t just give advice—and nobody would employ me.\\" As a result, Lee pleaded with his brother-in-law and his uncle Touby Lyfoung to help him stay in Australia to earn a master's degree in community development. Lee finished his thesis in the fall of 1974, but decided to stay in Australia to participate in his graduation ceremony. In May 1975, officers of the Hmong army and their families were airlifted out of Long Tieng, the main Hmong military base in northern Laos. Thousands of Hmong people, including members of Lee's family, fled to Thailand, most of them were placed in the Ban Vinai Refugee Camp. He was suddenly a man without a country. While applying for asylum, seeking to get information about his family, and trying to persuade the Australian government to accept Hmong refugees, Lee met William Geddes, an anthropologist teaching at Sydney University. Lee took issue with some of Geddes' observations about the Hmong (Geddes referred to them as the \\"Miao\\") in his book \\"Migrants of the Mountains,\\" but rather than taking umbrage, Geddes encouraged Lee to pursue a Ph.D. in anthropology and write his own study on the Hmong. Now an Australian citizen, Lee holds degrees in social work and a Ph.D. in social anthropology/community development. His research has included diverse refugee populations, but he is best known for his research and publications about the Hmong diaspora. In December 2007, Lee concluded a one-year term (October 2006 through December 2007) as a visiting scholar at the Center for Hmong Studies at Concordia University, St. Paul. He was the recipient of the Center for Hmong Studies first Eagle Award, given out at each of its biennial International Conferences on Hmong Studies, in recognition of a scholar who has devoted his or her life's work to the study of the Hmong and who has spoken out courageously on difficult, even controversial issues related to the field. Along with scholarly writing, Lee has also published several works of fiction including the novel, Dust of Life: A True Ban Vinai Love Story. His poetry has appeared in the Paj Ntaub Voice Hmong literary journal.

Weeks, johnweeks.com, 2008 Mayor E.H. Crump met with officials from the Rock Island Railroad on February 5, 1912, to discuss the possibility of a new bridge. The Iron Mountain Railroad and the Cotton Belt Railroad joined and formed the Memphis and Arkansas Bridge and Terminal Company. The plan drew wide support from the Memphis business community, and political leaders were urged to present a bill to Congress for approval of the ambitious project. This plan estimated the cost at $2.6 million and would include $400,000 for wagonways along each side.\\"Harahan built to meet Traffic needs\\", Commercial Appeal, 1/22/98, Perre Magness Initially, developers of the Rock Island Railroad were not interested in providing vehicular access to their bridge. Newly elected Congressman Kenneth McKellar from Memphis threatened to block the bridge permit if wagonways were not included. This bill also met with opposition in the form of Democratic party leader Oscar Underwood of Alabama. Congressman Underwood's campaign manager, Edward Campbell, was attorney for the Kansas City, Memphis and Birmingham Railroad, which was the owner of the \\"Great Bridge.\\" The KCM&B; Railroad did not want a competing bridge to undermine its monopoly on the Mississippi river crossing.

Harahan Construction The first work was to build of track from an existing line in the Arkansas flood plains to bring materials in place for construction. When this track was complete, 60 cars of timber waited for delivery. This material was used in building barges used for construction and moving materials into place. The first three months of construction were used to build 15 barges, and a total of 21 barges were needed to complete construction.\\"New Harahan Bridge Across the Mississippi River at Memphis\\", Rock Island Employees Magazine, March 1915, B.M. Case, Resident Engineer The next phase of the project involved building massive willow mats. These mats were constructed on the river. When completed, they measured 200 feet x 300 feet. They were floated to the location of the piers (held in place by barges) and sunk to the bottom of the river with rip-rap and stone. The purpose of the willow mats was to reduce scouring, keeping the river bed in place as the pneumatic caissons were dug into the river bed.\\"New Harahan Bridge Across the Mississippi River at Memphis\\", Rock Island Employees Magazine, March 1915, B.M. Case, Resident Engineer The Harahan Bridge was to be located north of the Frisco Bridge. Use of pneumatic caissons had been used on the Frisco and other major bridges; this did not eliminate the dangers involved. The Harahan pneumatic caissons were constructed on shore out of wood. The walls were thick, with heavy caulking and tar to make them airtight. The caisson was 40 feet wide x 90 feet long x 60 feet tall. In reality, it was a large wooden box, open at the bottom. The chamber at the bottom of the caisson had a 7-foot ceiling for the sandhogs to work.Modjeski, Ralph, (1917-4-16). \\"Harahan Bridge at Memphis Tn: Final Report\\" Hanging in the air above the middle of the stream - drawing of the construction of Harahan Bridge, c. 1917 Digging the river bottoms to sink the caissons into the river bed was difficult and dangerous work. All the material inside the walls of the caisson had to be removed to the surface. The caisson was built with excavation shafts for removing dirt and clay. The pressure was increased to match the water pressure, keeping the river water out of the work area. When the pressure was high enough, the excavation shafts were opened and air pressure would remove the light weight river bottom in a \\"blow off.\\" This eased the process greatly and saved a tremendous amount of time and effort for the sand hogs. It did, however, make a spectacular sight as a fountain of river bottom erupted from the caisson, it also left quite a mess on the top of it and any barges nearby.Modjeski, Ralph, (1917-4-16). \\"Harahan Bridge at Memphis Tn: Final Report\\" As the caissons were being sunk into the riverbed, the piers were being built on top of them, adding weight and driving the caisson deeper into the river bottom. The piers were masonry blocks of granite backed with concrete. The piers of the Harahan were located directly upstream of the piers of the Frisco Bridge to keep the navigation channels open to river traffic. Pier IV was moved toward the river relative to the Frisco Pier IV. This enabled the engineers to design two suspended spans and three cantilevered arms identically.Modjeski, Ralph, (1917-4-16). \\"Harahan Bridge at Memphis Tn: Final Report\\" With the caissons sunk and the substructure complete, work began on the steel superstructure. The longest span between Pier I and Pier II was the first to be built. This span would be built without falsework, employing two cantilevered arms and a suspended arm. The next span to be complete was between Pier II and Pier III, using temporary falsework wood support timbers driven into the river bottom to hold the fixed span in place until it was complete. The span between Pier III and Pier IV was started concurrently. Span II to III was finished on December 22, 1915. On December 24, 1915, the river rose too quickly and washed away the false work. Span II to III was not damaged, although it moved . Span III to IV was completely washed out, forcing a delay in the construction and a redesign on the span. On July 14, 1916, the first train crossed the bridge. The celebration that had been planned was cancelled due to the war in Europe. The wagonways were not opened until September 17, 1917. The delay was due to construction problems with a wooden viaduct in Arkansas.\\"Harahan built to meet Traffic needs\\", Commercial Appeal, 1/22/98, Perre Magness The wagonways are still on the bridge, and the Arkansas approach has road stubs leading towards I-55. ()  Big River Crossing  One of the former roadways on the north side of the bridge is now used to carry pedestrian and bicycle traffic across the Mississippi River. The bridge is a vital part of a larger project that connects Main Street in Memphis to Broadway in West Memphis, Arkansas. In 2016, it was announced that an anonymous donor had pledged $5 million to illuminate the bridge. The Harahan Bridge became the second illuminated bridge in Memphis, the only one to be illuminated by LED (although plans are in the works to re-light the Hernando Desoto Bridge upstream with LED's).

It had been ordered by the London, Midland and Scottish Railway in 1946 but did not appear until after the 1948 nationalisation of the railways. Design was by George Ivatt and the locomotive was intended as a possible replacement for steam locomotives on secondary and branch lines. The single-cab layout (long bonnet forward) gave the driver a poor view of the road ahead. The view was no worse than a steam locomotive's, so it would have been considered acceptable at the time. During its brief time on the Southern Region between 1952 and 1954, 10800 gained the nickname 'The Wonder Engine', from the locomotive department's daily query, 'I wonder if it will go today'. Description Due to having been ordered by the LMS before the creation of British Railways (BR), 10800 became the first BR mixed-traffic Diesel-Electric locomotive when it was delivered in 1950. Operationally it was successful enough for BR to order two classes of 54 similar locomotives in 1955 although these, destined to become BR Class 15 and BR Class 16, used the improved YHXL engine.

Brush named the locomotive Hawk. DC transmission in diesel-electric locomotives was reaching its limits, at least for single-generator locomotives. The brushgear and commutator of a DC generator became prone to flashover for engine powers greater than around 2,700 bhp. The most straightforward solution, rather than redesigning the DC generator, was to adopt an AC alternator instead, which could use a much simpler slipring connection to its field rotor rather than a commutator. Although the advantages of AC transmission were obvious, the best means to implement suitable traction motors was not. Should these be the familiar DC motors (requiring AC–DC rectification)? Or should AC traction motors be developed, and if so, how would their speed be controlled? High-power solid- state electronics was in an early state at this time, although Brush were keen to become leaders in the field. A more powerful engine would be required, to give a realistic trial, and Brush already had a suitable one on hand, as a spare from the development of Falcon. This was a Maybach MD655 of 1,400 bhp. The Maybach was also a high-speed diesel engine, running at 1,500 rpm rather than the Paxman's 1,250 rpm. The Paxman was itself considered a high-speed engine, running significantly faster than the English Electric or Sulzer medium-speed (< 1,000 rpm) engines which had been adopted for high-powered British Railways locomotives. The new 100Hz AC generator was rated at , a conversion efficiency of 91%. The output was at 1,325V / 600A. New AC traction motors were used, with squirrel cage motors supplied by thyristor variable- frequency drives. Brush's experience with AC transmission, gained with Hawk, would be put to use a few years later with the development of the 4,000 bhp single-engined AC transmission HS4000 Kestrel. Hawk was used until 1968, after which its control equipment was becoming irrelevantly obsolete and was superseded by the direct experience from Kestrel. During the 1972 miners' strike the engine and generator were removed as a standby generator for the Brush Falcon works. After this, parts began to be stripped until it was finally scrapped around 1976.

The initial 21 of these were conducted between 1923 and 1940. They are labeled with Roman numerals, from Fleet Problem I through Fleet Problem XXI. A 22nd Fleet Problem exercise, scheduled for 1941, was canceled because of World War II. After this, Fleet Problems underwent a prolonged hiatus, with other names being used to describe such naval exercise. However, the term was revived in 2015 or 2016 under Admiral Scott H. Swift, and Fleet Problem XXIII was held by the Pacific Fleet, with Fleet Problems XXIV through XXVIII occurring over the following years. The fleet problems were usually once-a-year exercises in which U.S. naval forces would engage in mock battles. One or more of the forces would play the part of a European or Asian navy. They were the culmination of the Navy's annual training maneuvers. Fleet Problems =Fleet Problem I= Fleet Problem I was held in February and March 1923 and was staged off the coast of Panama. The attacking Black force, using battleships to represent aircraft carriers, tested the defenses of the Panama Canal. A single plane launched from —representing a carrier air group—dropped 10 miniature bombs and theoretically \\"destroyed\\" the spillway of the Gatun Dam. =Fleet Problems II, III, IV= Fleet Problems II, III, and IV were held concurrently in January and February 1924 took place in the Caribbean and simulated actions that might occur in the Pacific. Fleet Problem II Fleet Problem II simulated the first leg of a westward advance across the Pacific. Fleet Problem III This exercise focused on a defense of the Panama Canal from the Caribbean side. The Blue force was defending the canal from an attack from the Caribbean by the Black force, operating from an advance base in the Azores. It was to practice amphibious landing techniques and the rapidity of transiting a fleet through the canal from the Pacific side. In the exercise, a Black force special operations action resulted in the \\"sinking\\" of Blue force battleship in the Culebra Cut which would have blocked the canal. Fleet Problem IV This problem simulated the movement from a main base in the western Pacific to the Japanese home islands—represented in that case by islands, cities, and countries surrounding the Caribbean. =Fleet Problem V= Fleet Problem V was held in March and April 1925 and simulated an attack on Hawaii.McCue, p. 14 The Black force, the aggressor, was given the United States' first aircraft carrier, along with two seaplane tenders and other ships outfitted with aircraft, while the defending Blue force had no carriers. In addition, aircraft aboard the battleship could not be launched for lack of a working catapult. Langleys positive performance helped speed the completion of aircraft carriers and . One aspect of Fleet Problem V was conducted near Guadalupe Island off Baja California and involved attacking a lightly held position and refueling at sea. =Fleet Problem VI= Held off the west coast of Central America in early 1926. =Fleet Problem VII= This fleet problem was held March 1927 and involved defense of the Panama Canal.Wildenberg, pp. 144–48 The highlight of the exercise was ’s successful air raid on the Panama Canal. =Fleet Problem VIII= Held in April 1928 between California and Hawaii and pitted Orange, a cruiser force from Pearl Harbor, versus Blue, the Battle Force. It also involved a convoy search and anti-submarine operations. =Fleet Problem IX= This scenario in January 1929 studied the effects of an attack upon the Panama Canal and conducted the operations necessary to carry out such an eventuality, and pitted the Battle Fleet (less submarines and Lexington) against a combination of forces including the Scouting Force (augmented by Lexington), the Control Forces, Train Squadron 1, and 15th Naval District and local army defense forces. In a daring move, Saratoga was detached from the fleet with only a single cruiser as escort to make a wide sweep to the south and \\"attack\\" the Panama Canal, which was defended by the Scouting Fleet and Saratogas sister ship, Lexington. She successfully launched her strike on 26 January and, despite being \\"sunk\\" three times later in the day, proved the versatility of a carrier-based fast task force. =Fleet Problem X= Held in 1930 in Caribbean waters. This time, however, Saratoga and Langley were \\"disabled\\" by a surprise attack from Lexington, showing how quickly air power could swing the balance in a naval action. =Fleet Problem XI= Held in April 1930 in the Caribbean. =Fleet Problem XII= USS Los Angeles moored to USS Patoka, along with other ships off Panama during Fleet Problem XII. Held in 1931 in waters west of Central America and Panama. Black, attacking from the west, was to land forces and establish bases in Central America and destroy the Panama Canal, while Blue defended with an aviation-heavy fleet. Blue's two carrier groups, centered on Saratoga and Lexington, attacked the invasion fleets but failed to stop the landings and got too close to the Black fleets.Albert A. Nofi, To Train the Fleet For War: The U.S. Navy Fleet Problems, 1923–1940 (Newport, R.I.: Naval War College Press, 2010) =Fleet Problem XIII= Fleet Problem XIII began in March 1932, one month after Army/Navy Grand Joint Exercise 4. Blue, based in Hawaii, was to sail east and invade three \\"enemy\\" ports on the North American Pacific coastline to try and gain a foothold for future operations. Blue had nine battleships, one aircraft carrier, and many lesser ships. Black defended with one modern aircraft carrier and some fictional battleships, as well as a number of actual cruisers, submarines, and many other ships.Wadle, Ryan David (August 2005). \\"United States Navy Fleet Problems and the Development of Carrier Aviation, 1929–1933,\\" pp. 78–95. Texas A&M; University. Masters thesis. Blue's advance was quickly located by Black's picket line of submarines which then took heavy losses from air attack. Both sides put a priority on destroying the enemy aircraft carrier, launching air attacks almost simultaneously after a few days of probing. Significant damage was laid on both carriers, with Blue's carrier eventually \\"sunk\\" by torpedo from a Black destroyer. After-action critiques stressed the growing importance of naval aviation, and an increased need for the construction of aircraft carriers in the event of a war in the Pacific.Herts, Fleet Problem XIII & Grand Joint Exercise No. 4: Reconsidering Aircraft Carrier Doctrine Submarines operating at or near the surface were seen to be critically vulnerable to air observation and attack.MacDonald, Scot (September 1962). \\"Evolution of Aircraft Carriers: Last of the Fleet Problems,\\" pp. 34–38. Naval Aviation News. The exercise showed that one carrier was insufficient for either fleet attack or area defense, so the practice of two or more carriers operating together became policy. Admiral Harry E. Yarnell said that six to eight carriers would be required for a Pacific campaign, but no orders were placed for new carriers, as Depression-era financial difficulties caused President Herbert Hoover to limit naval expenses. =Fleet Problem XIV= Held 10–17 February 1933, Fleet Problem XIV was the first naval exercise to test simulated aircraft carrier attacks against the west coast of the United States. Pacific cities had for decades vied for permanent stationing of U.S. military assets, and vulnerabilities exposed through the exercises were used by metropolitan navy boosters to leverage their cases. In spite of early Navy plans for San Francisco to be home port for the main west coast fleet, these plans had failed to materialize with San Diego incrementally gaining the majority of navy investments. Fleet Problem XIV occurred the month before Franklin D. Roosevelt, a former Assistant Secretary of the Navy, took the office of the presidency. The results of the exercise between the U.S. Navy's Black and Blue fleets, were mixed. The simulated attacks had certainly been mitigated by the defensive Blue fleet, however the Black fleet had scored key victories with strikes on San Pedro and San Francisco, California. =Fleet Problem XV= Held in May 1934 in Hawaii, this was a three-phase exercise which encompassed an attack upon and defense of the Panama Canal, the capture of advanced bases, and a major fleet engagement. =Fleet Problem XVI= Held in May 1935 in the northern Pacific off the coast of Alaska and in waters surrounding the Hawaiian Islands, this operation was divided into five distinct phases which were thought to be aspects of some real naval campaign of the future in which the U.S. would take the strategic offensive. =Fleet Problem XVII= This problem took place off the west coast of the U.S., Central America, and the Panama Canal Zone in the spring of 1936. It was a five-phase exercise devoted to preparing the fleet for anti-submarine operations, testing communications systems, and training of aircraft patrol squadrons for extended fleet operations, and pitted the Battle Force against the submarine-augmented Scouting Force. =Fleet Problem XVIII= This exercise was held in May 1937 in Alaskan waters and in the vicinity of the Hawaiian Islands and Midway, practicing the tactics of seizing advanced base sites—a technique later to be polished to a high degree into close support and amphibious warfare doctrines. =Fleet Problem XIX= , foreground; , middle distance; and , background, lie at anchor off Honolulu, Hawaii, 8 April 1938 during Fleet Problem XIX. This operation in April and May 1938 gave the navy added experience in search tactics; in the use of submarines, destroyers, and aircraft in scouting and attack; in the dispositions of the fleet; and in the conduct of a major fleet battle. In addition, the exercise again dealt with the matter of seizing advanced fleet bases and defending them against minor opposition. Fleet Problem XIX also tested the capabilities of the Hawaiian Defense Force, augmenting it with fleet units to help to defend the islands against the United States Fleet as a whole. The last phase of the exercise exercised the fleet in operations against a defended coastline. =Fleet Problem XX= Took place in February 1939 in the Caribbean and Atlantic, and observed in person by President Franklin Roosevelt. The exercise simulated the defense of the East Coast of the United States and Latin America by the Black team from the invading White team. Participating in the maneuvers were 134 ships, 600 planes, and over 52,000 officers and men. =Fleet Problem XXI= An eight-phase operation for the defense of the Hawaiian area in April 1940. A diary entry written by James M. Gregory aboard the USS Astoria (CA-34) in 1940 reads, \\"April 2, Tue. Standing 8–12 watches in engine room. Underway 8:53 A.M. for Fleet Problem XXI.

It sits in a large promontory of hills north of downtown Los Angeles, next to Major League Baseball's Dodger Stadium.The name Chavez Ravine can be used to mean either the actual ravine itself in a narrow sense or sometimes in a broader sense the entire promontory and surrounding ravines, and (by metonymy) is also used to refer to the stadium. Dodger Stadium was constructed by knocking down the ridge which separated the nearby Sulfur and Cemetery Ravines and filling those two ravines in. Palo Verde Elementary School was buried in the process. Chavez Ravine was named for Julian Chavez, a Los Angeles councilman in the 19th century who originally purchased the land in the Elysian Park area. Cemetery Ravine is marked to the right of the map. Calvary Cemetery is marked \\"Campo\\" by an icon of a church, where the ravine ended at modern Broadway; Cathedral High School was later built over the cemetery. The map, \\"Zanja Madre, 1868\\" shows Cemetery Ravine on its right side. History =1800s= A memorial plaque marking the location of the first Jewish site in Los Angeles, in Chavez Ravine. Chavez Ravine was named for Julian Chavez, the first recorded land owner in the ravine. He was born in New Mexico and moved to Los Angeles in the early 1830s. He quickly became a local leader. In 1844, Chavez purchased 83 acres of the long, narrow valley northwest of the city. There are no records of what Chavez did on his land, but during the 1850s and 1880s there were smallpox epidemics; Chavez Canyon was the location of a \\"pest house\\" which cared for Chinese-Americans and Mexican-Americans suffering from the disease. In addition to the notable Mexican-American presence, there was also a notable early Jewish-American presence in the neighborhood beginning in the 1850s. The First Jewish site in Los Angeles was a Jewish cemetery located in Chavez Ravine, which opened in 1855 and was owned by the Hebrew Benevolent Society of Los Angeles, a Jewish charity which was also the first charity in Los Angeles. The Hebrew Benevolent Society purchased a 3 acre plot of barren land for the cemetery for $1 from the city. The Hebrew Benevolent Society of Los Angeles was founded in 1854 for the purpose of \\"…procuring a piece of ground suitable for the purpose of a burying ground for the deceased of their own faith, and also to appropriate a portion of their time and means to the holy cause of benevolence…,\\". The Hebrew Benevolent Society of Los Angeles received the deed to land from the Los Angeles City Council on April 9, 1855. With this land they established the first Jewish cemetery in Los Angeles at Lilac Terrace and Lookout Drive in Chavez Ravine. The site is now the current site of Dodger Stadium and the Los Angeles Fire Department's Frank Hotchkin Memorialized Training Center. The land was very rugged which prevented further development of the area at the time. However the area did provide an important watershed and part was used by the Los Angeles Water Company for a canal bringing water from what is now Griffith Park and storing it in a reservoir (today called Buena Vista Reservoir) in Reservoir Ravine. Some of Chavez Canyon and the surrounding hills became Elysian Park in 1886. That same year, two brick manufacturers moved into Chavez Ravine and began blasting operations in the hillsides. =1900s= In 1902, because of poor environmental conditions due to the unchecked expansion of the oil industry in the Chavez Ravine area, it was proposed by Congregation B'nai B'rith to secure a new plot of land in what is now East LA, and to move the buried remains to the new site, with a continued provision for burial of indigent people, this became the Home of Peace Cemetery in East Los Angeles. By the early 1900s, in the hills above and around the ravine, a semi-rural Mexican-American community had grown up. Eventually, three distinct neighborhoods formed: Bishop, La Loma and Palo Verde, mostly on the ridges between the neighboring ravines. In 1913 a progressive lawyer named Marshall Stimson subsidized the movement of around 250 Mexican-Americans to these communities from the floodplain of the nearby Los Angeles River. There was a local grocery store, a local church, and Palo Verde Elementary. There was a nearby brick factory which caused local problems from the smoke and dust released. In 1926 the residents of Chavez Ravine organized to shut the company down. On August 20, 1926, the Los Angeles City Council unanimously adopted an ordinance prohibiting the blasting and zoned the area around Chavez Ravine for residential use. =1940s= Chavez Ravine was made up of the three mostly Mexican-American communities of La Loma, Palo Verde, and Bishop. In the 1940s, the area was a poor, though cohesive, Mexican-American community. Many families lived there because of housing discrimination in other parts of Los Angeles. With the population of Los Angeles expanding, Chavez Ravine was viewed as a prime, underutilized location. The city began to label the area as \\"blighted\\" and thus ripe for redevelopment. Through a vote, the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles, with the assistance of federal funds from the Housing Act of 1949, was designated the task to construct public housing, in large part to address the severe post-World War II housing shortage. Prominent architects Richard Neutra and Robert Alexander developed a plan for \\"Elysian Park Heights.\\" The city had already relocated many of the residents of Chavez Ravine when the entire project came to a halt. =1950s= The land for Dodger Stadium was purchased from some local owners/inhabitants in the early 1950s by the City of Los Angeles, using eminent domain, with funds from the Federal Housing Act of 1949. The city had planned to develop the Elysian Park Heights public housing project, which was to include two dozen 13-story buildings and more than 160 two-story townhouses, in addition to newly-rebuilt playgrounds and schools. Los Angeles-based author Mike Davis, in his controversial, often polemical, history of the city, City of Quartz, discussed the process of gradually convincing Chavez Ravine homeowners to sell. Davis asserted that with nearly all of the original Spanish-speaking homeowners initially unwilling to do so, \\"developers\\", representing the city and its public housing authority, resorted to offering immediate cash payments, distributed through their Spanish- speaking agents. Once the first sales had been completed, it is said that remaining homeowners were offered lesser amounts of money, allegedly to create a sense of community panic that people would not receive fair compensation, or that they would be left as one of the few holdouts. Some residents continued to resist, despite the pressure being placed upon them by the \\"developers,\\" resulting in the Battle of Chavez Ravine, an unsuccessful ten-year struggle by a small number of remaining residents of Chavez Ravine to maintain control of their property, after the substantial majority of the area had been transferred to public ownership. Before construction of the Elysian Park Heights project could begin, the local political climate changed greatly when Norris Poulson was elected mayor of Los Angeles in 1953. Poulson opposed the provision of public housing, claiming that it was \\"un-American\\", and support for projects like Elysian Park Heights faded. Following protracted negotiations, the City of Los Angeles was able to repurchase the Chavez Ravine property from the Federal Housing Authority at a drastically reduced price, with the stipulation that the land be used for a public purpose. Following the \\"baseball referendum\\", promoted by the Taxpayers Committee for Yes on Baseball, which was approved by Los Angeles voters on June 3, 1958, the City made the controversial decision to trade of land at Chavez Ravine to the Brooklyn Dodgers and team's owner Walter O'Malley in exchange for land around the minor league park, Wrigley Field, with the aim of providing incentives for migration to Los Angeles. From their arrival in Los Angeles in 1958 until 1961, the Dodgers played their home games at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum; Dodger Stadium officially opened in 1962. An overlay of modern and older municipal map information to show the relationship between the community of Palo Verde/Chavez Ravine, larger Echo Park; and current position of Dodger Stadium. =Later years= During the years when the expansion Los Angeles Angels were tenants of the Dodgers (1962 through 1965), the Angels referred to the stadium as \\"Chavez Ravine Stadium\\" or simply \\"Chavez Ravine\\". Los Angeles City Council designated the property as \\"Dodgertown\\" in October 2008. The United States Postal Service assigned postal code \\"Dodgertown, CA 90090\\" in April 2009. A number of structures from Chavez Ravine were spared demolition and sold by the developers of Dodger Stadium to nearby Universal Studios for one dollar apiece. Universal moved the structures to its back lot where they subsequently appeared in various Universal productions, most notably the 1962 film To Kill a Mockingbird. The house of Atticus Finch, for example, was an erstwhile Chavez Ravine home. However, according to the film's art director, Henry Bumstead, as cited in an article in Andrew Horton's \\"Henry Bumstead and the World of Hollywood Art Direction\\", the houses used on the Mockingbird set were actually purchased by the studio after they had been condemned and slated for demolition to make way for new freeway construction. =Today= Most of Chavez Ravine remains in Elysian Park where the Chavez Ravine Arboretum still stands. The arboretum was founded in 1893 by the Los Angeles Horticultural Society where trees were added to through to the 1920s. Most of the Arboretum's original trees are still standing and many are the oldest and largest of their kind in California and even the United States. Further south in the ravine is Barlow Respiratory Hospital which was founded in 1902 and continues to treat patients today. At the open end of the ravine immediately adjacent to Dodger Stadium is the Naval and Marine Corps Reserve Center which was built in 1937 but is today a training facility, Frank Hotchkin Memorial Training Center, for the Los Angeles City Fire Department. References in the arts Chavez Ravine is mentioned in The Mescaleros' song \\"All in a Day\\" in their 2003 album Streetcore. Chavez Ravine, 1949: A Los Angeles Story (1999) collects interviews and photos by Don Normark documenting the Ravine's culture at the time. Chávez Ravine is an album recorded by Ry Cooder in 2005, as a soundtrack to a PBS documentary directed by Jordan Mechner. The film makes use of the Normark photos in telling the story of how a Mexican American community was destroyed to make way for a low-income public housing project.Woo, Elaine (11 June 2014) \\"Don Normark, who photographed Chavez Ravine residents, dies at 86\\" Los Angeles Times The Provisional City (2000) recounts the postwar history of housing in Los Angeles by Dana Cuff, and devotes a section of the book to the politics of transforming Chavez Ravine into a modern housing development designed by Richard Neutra and Robert Alexander, and the demise of that utopian plan. \\"Chávez Ravine: A Record by Ry Cooder\\" is the twelfth studio album by Ry Cooder.

The 1952 crime drama film Without Warning! has several scenes that take place in Chavez Ravine. During Dave Dameshek's \\"Number One Sports\\" segment on The Adam Carolla Show, Dodger Stadium was often humorously referred to as Chavez Ravine.

The series ran for three seasons; it premiered on September 22, 2004, during UPN's last two years, and ended on May 22, 2007, after a season on UPN's successor, The CW. The series balances murder mystery, high school and college drama, featuring social commentary with sarcasm and off-beat humor in a style often compared to film noir. Set in the fictional town of Neptune, Veronica Mars starred Kristen Bell as the title character, a student who progressed from high school to college during the series while moonlighting as a private investigator under the wing of her detective father. Episodes have a distinct structure: Veronica solves a different \\"case of the week\\" while continually trying to solve a season-long mystery. The first two seasons of the series have a season-long mystery arc, in which the conflict is introduced in the first episode of the season and resolved in the finale. The third season takes on a different format, focusing on smaller mystery arcs that last the course of several episodes. The first season's run of 22 episodes garnered an average of 2.5 million viewers per episode in the United States. The second season decreased to an average of 2.3 million viewers; however, it included the series' highest rated episode with 3.6 million viewers. The third and final season saw an increase to an average of 2.5 million viewers. (Registration required) Veronica Mars appeared on a number of fall television best lists, and garnered a number of awards and nominations. At the 2007 CW Upfront, Ostroff announced that Veronica Mars was not part of the new primetime lineup, and in June 2007, TV Guide writer Michael Ausiello confirmed that the cancellation of Veronica Mars was official. In September 2018, an eight- episode fourth season was confirmed by Hulu, which was released on July 19, 2019.  Series overview   Episodes  = Season 1 (2004–05) = The first season revolves around Veronica Mars (Kristen Bell), a high school student and private investigator in the fictional coastal Southern California town of Neptune. As the daughter of well-respected County Sheriff Keith Mars (Enrico Colantoni), the biggest problem in Veronica's life was getting dumped by her boyfriend, Duncan Kane (Teddy Dunn). But when her best friend Lilly Kane (Amanda Seyfried) is murdered, Veronica's life falls apart. Veronica's father accuses Lilly's father, popular software billionaire Jake Kane (Kyle Secor), of being involved in the murder. This provokes Neptune's wrath, and Keith is ousted and replaced by the new sheriff Don Lamb (Michael Muhney) in a recall election. Veronica's mother, Lianne Mars (Corinne Bohrer), develops a drinking problem and leaves town. When Veronica's \\"09er\\" friends—wealthy students from the fictional 90909 ZIP Code—force her to choose between them and her father, Veronica decides to work part-time in her father's newly opened private investigation agency, Mars Investigations. She helps her father solve cases and conducts her own investigations on behalf of friends and acquaintances at school. Veronica discovers new evidence which suggests that Abel Koontz (Christian Clemenson), the man imprisoned after confessing to Lilly's murder, is innocent. As Veronica delves deeper into the murder case, she also works on other investigations, seeks her mother's whereabouts and deals with the aftermath of being drugged and raped during an \\"09er\\" party. Veronica, no longer part of the school's wealthy in-crowd, makes some new friends: Wallace Fennel (Percy Daggs III), Neptune High basketball star; Eli \\"Weevil\\" Navarro (Francis Capra), leader of the PCHers, a Latino biker gang named after the Pacific Coast Highway; and Cindy \\"Mac\\" Mackenzie (Tina Majorino), Neptune High's resident computer genius. Using her friends' resources, as well as those provided by her father and his contacts, Veronica gains a reputation for sleuthing and finds her skills in increasingly high demand at her school. Things get more complicated when Veronica falls into a relationship with Lilly's ex-boyfriend Logan Echolls (Jason Dohring), who for a time held Veronica partly responsible for Lilly's death and went out of his way to harass her. = Season 2 (2005–06) = The second season adds three regular cast members: new character Jackie Cook (Tessa Thompson), and first season recurring characters Dick Casablancas (Ryan Hansen) and Cassidy \\"Beaver\\" Casablancas (Kyle Gallner). The season begins with the introduction of two new cases: When a school bus full of Neptune High students plunges off a cliff, killing almost everyone on board, Veronica makes it her mission to discover why the bus crashed. Meanwhile, Logan is accused of killing PCH biker gang member Felix Toombs after drunkenly picking a fight with Weevil and the PCHers. Partway through the season, Weevil becomes convinced of Logan's innocence and they team up to find the real killer. Veronica's life returns to much the way it was before Lilly's death: having broken up with Logan during the summer, she reunites with Duncan and is somewhat accepted by the \\"09ers\\". However, her private-eye sideline and tough persona keep her from being truly assimilated back into the rich crowd. \\"09ers\\" Dick and Cassidy deal with a gold-digging stepmother, Kendall Casablancas (Charisma Carpenter), with whom they are left when their father flees the country while under investigation for real estate fraud. Wallace discovers that his biological father is alive and takes a romantic interest in Jackie. The mystery involving Logan and Weevil was the producers' attempt to give Bell some time off after the taxing first season. Thomas later considered the mystery arcs of the second season to have had \\"way too many suspects, way too many red herrings\\", necessitating a change for the third season. As Thomas had conceived the show as a one-year mystery, he decided to introduce and eliminate several characters in order to create an \\"equally fascinating mystery\\" for the series' second season. Thomas needed \\"new blood\\" since he felt unable to bring back the Kanes and the Echolls and \\"have them all involved in a new mystery\\". Teddy Dunn, who portrayed Duncan Kane, left the series midway through the season because Thomas felt that the Logan-Veronica-Duncan love triangle had run its course. He needed to put \\"other guys in her life\\" to keep the series fresh and attributed Dunn's removal to fan interest dominating the Logan-Veronica relationship, saying \\"it became clear that one suitor won out\\". = Season 3 (2006–07) = The third season introduces two new series regulars, Parker Lee (Julie Gonzalo) and Stosh \\"Piz\\" Piznarski (Chris Lowell). Piz was created so that Veronica could have a male friend of middle-class status rather than of upper-class, and his campus radio show serves as a narrative device to capture the mood of the university. Don Lamb and Mac, recurring characters in the first two seasons, are upgraded to series regulars. The season begins with Veronica, Logan, Wallace, Mac and Dick as freshmen at Hearst College. Piz and Parker are introduced as the respective roommates of Wallace and Mac. The first mystery is established when Parker becomes the latest victim of the Hearst serial rapist, a storyline begun in a second season episode. Veronica sets out to catch the rapist, partially motivated by guilt from failing to help Parker. The next mystery, a murder, commences in the same episode the rapist is discovered. During the season, Keith begins an affair with a married client, Wallace struggles to balance academics and sports, Mac begins dating again after previous failed relationships, and Dick has a breakdown and appeals to Logan for help. The season also chronicles Veronica and Logan's failing attempts to maintain their relationship in the face of Veronica's mistrust. The couple breaks up several times throughout the season, and Logan begins dating Parker while Veronica goes out with Piz. Keith is challenged in the sheriff's election by longtime rival P.I. Vinnie Van Lowe (Ken Marino), and faces charges after he destroys evidence incriminating Veronica. The third season was initially planned to include three separate mysteries that would be introduced and resolved in a series of non-overlapping story arcs. Dawn Ostroff pointed out that the original format may confuse viewers, and the new format would allow new viewers to start watching at any point in the season. Inspired by the improvised thriller Bubble, Thomas started laying \\"subtle\\" motives for the second mystery during the first one, so that fans would have \\"a theory on whodunit\\" when it occurred. The first mystery took place over the first nine episodes. Originally, the second mystery was to be seven episodes long and the third mystery was to occur over the last six episodes of the season. When The CW ordered a 20-episode season instead of the usual 22 episodes, the second mystery arc was shortened from seven episodes to six, and the third mystery was changed from a six episode arc to a five-episode arc. After an eight-week hiatus for the series was announced, the final mystery was changed to five stand-alone episodes designed to be friendlier to new viewers. For the third mystery, Thomas had wanted to present a new situation where Wallace and Mac could be fully involved, \\"key players [with] really interesting stuff to do\\". This was a departure from previous seasons where \\"nice characters\\" had always been absent from the big mystery because no one was going to believe them to be a suspect. = Film (2014) = = Season 4 (2019) = References  External links  * Veronica Mars at Hulu  * Mars Investigations Category:Lists of American comedy-drama television series episodes Category:Lists of American teen comedy television series episodes Category:Lists of American teen drama television series episodes it:Veronica Mars#Episodi ","title":"List of Veronica Mars episodes"},{"id":"3922654","text":"Anti-Canadianism is hostility towards the government, culture, or people of Canada.

Established in 1994, its mission is to support Hmong writers and artists by providing a community forum to foster Hmong writing and art, thus nurturing the continual growth and celebration of Hmong heritage. The purpose is to blend the old with new documentation techniques to reflect the artistic soul of the Hmong community. Paj Ntaub Voice’s project goals include: Building a body of Hmong writers and artists, promoting writing by Hmong writers as well as writing about the Hmong, and creating a community forum to engage in discussions on issues that affect the Hmong, and to celebrate and affirm Hmong writers in public readings. History The first issue of Paj Ntaub Voice was published in Summer 1994. Its headquarters is in Saint Paul, Minnesota. It initially began as a youth project of Hmong American Partnership before its organizers began to form a new organization, the Center for Hmong Arts And Talent in Saint Paul. In 2003, the Paj Ntaub Voice editors and staff left the Center for Hmong Arts and Talent and became a program under the newly formed Hmong American Institute for Learning. In October 2002, the Minnesota Historical Society Press published an anthology collecting both original and previously published examples of work from contributors to the Paj Ntaub Voice called Bamboo Among the Oaks, which, despite initial skepticism quickly sold out its first printing within a year. It continues to be taught in several classrooms across the country. The Paj Ntaub Voice has changed formats over the years. Originally it appeared as a 12-page collection of tabloid-sized photocopies, but eventually grew into a saddle-stitched journal with cardstock covers during the later years at Hmong American Partnership. In 1999, when the Paj Ntaub Voice became a project under the Center for Hmong Arts and Talent, the journal became a full-sized, perfect bound magazine with a glossy full- color cover. In 2003, the Hmong American Institute for Learning introduced the Paj Ntaub Voice in a new, perfect-bound, digest-sized format. Staff An average of 15 to 25 writers appear in each issue.

His plays include Susana y los Jóvenes and Ante varias esfinges, both dating from the 1950s. In 1955, Ibarguengoitia received a Rockefeller grant to study in New York City; five years later he received the Mexico City literary award. He died in Avianca Flight 011 en route to Frankfurt via Paris, Madrid, and Caracas to Bogotá that crashed on November 27, 1983. Work Often, in his fiction, he took real-life scandals and subjected them to whimsical, sardonic treatment. Thus, Los Relámpagos de Agosto (1964) uses cartoonish mayhem to debunk the Mexican Revolution's heroic myths; improbably it won for its author the Premio Casa de las Américas, despite or because of the consternation which its flippancy caused. For Las Muertas (1977) he turned to the most outrageous criminals of his native state: the brothel-keepers Delfina and María de Jesús González, whose decade-long careers as serial killers emerged in 1964. Ibarguengoitia himself met a tragic end, on what became one of the blackest days in Latin American artistic history: departing from his then home in Paris, he perished along with Peruvian poet Manuel Scorza, Uruguayan critic Ángel Rama, Argentinian academic Marta Traba, and 177 others in the crash of Avianca Flight 011 on 27 November 1983. La ley de Herodes (1967) is a collection of short stories, most of which are clearly based on details from his own life. He describes, among many other events, the misadventures of getting a mortgage in Mexico and his experiences at Columbia University's International House. Like his novels, these stories combine farce, sexual peccadilloes, and humor. \\"Estas ruinas que ves\\" is a farce based on realistic details of academic life that are still visible in early 21st century Guanajuato: the clanging of church bells disconcerting a speaker, cutting the ribbon at museum openings, the set of cultural movers and shakers who have known each other since kindergarten. \\"Maten al leon\\" although set on an imaginary island is a novel mirroring the Latino-american dictatorships; its details are comic but the end is dark. Ibarguengoitia was also known for his weekly columns in the Mexico City newspaper Excelsior which have been collected in a half dozen paperback volumes. His novels are also available in paperback. The writer has been quoted as saying he never meant to make anyone laugh, that he thought laughter was useless and a pointless waste of time. He is buried in Antillon Park in Guanajuato where a talavera plaque marks his remains. In translation, it says simply, \\"Here lies Jorge Ibarguengoitia in the park of his great-grandfather who fought against the French.\\" Bibliography =Drama= * La lucha con el ángel (1955). * Clotilde en su casa, como Un adulterio exquisito (1955).

The architectural design is a continuous cantilevered cable-stayed steel through arch, with bedstead endposts. Memphians also call the bridge the \\"New Bridge\\", as it is newer than the Memphis & Arkansas Bridge (carrying Interstate 55) downstream, and the \\"M Bridge\\", due to its distinctive shape. It is of similar construction to the Sherman Minton Bridge between Louisville, Kentucky, and New Albany, Indiana. History Preliminary planning for the river crossing began in 1960 as part of Interstate 40 alignment studies for the Memphis - Little Rock corridor, which was constructed in segments between 1963 and 1968. Before the Hernando de Soto Bridge was completed, traffic going across the river was carried across the Mississippi River by the Interstate 55/US Highway 64/70/79/61 Memphis & Arkansas Bridge crossing, located southwest. Construction of the Hernando de Soto Bridge began in May 1967. The double-arch bridge was opened to automobile traffic on August 2, 1973. It was seismically retrofitted in 2006. The bridge is named for 16th century Spanish explorer Hernando de Soto who explored this stretch of the Mississippi River, and died south of Memphis. Bridge illumination At night, the bridge is illuminated by 200 sodium vapor lights along its \\"M\\" shape structure. The bridge was first illuminated on September 5, 1986, after $373,000 of private funds had been raised to fund the cost and installation of the lights. Due to some river traffic having issues with the lights at night reflecting on the water, the city installed a remote switch to toggle the lights on and off briefly while the vessel passes under the bridge. During the 2011 Mississippi River floods, the bridge became dark for about 2 months because the transformers that supply the electricity for the lights were removed to prevent damage to them by flood waters. The bridge was re-lit in a ceremony which occurred on June 21, 2011. It was announced after the opening of the Big River Crossing along the Harahan Bridge to the south that the existing sodium vapor lights along the Hernando Desoto Bridge would be replaced with a new LED lighting display, thus making the Hernando Desoto Bridge the second bridge over the Mississippi River to be lit as such after the Harahan. The new display can be lit in sync with the Harahan Bridge and display various color patterns dependent upon special occasions or requests. Both displays have been created under an initiative called \\"Mighty Lights.\\" The $14 million privately funded project is expected to begin June 4 and be unveiled October 27, nearly exactly 2 years after the opening/initial illumination of the Big River Crossing. Seismic retrofit project Since 2000, the bridge has been under a seismic retrofitting project, allowing it to withstand a 7.7 magnitude earthquake, the similar magnitude of earthquakes during the 1811–12 New Madrid earthquakes. The retrofit project is also a means to protect the bridge as it is located within of the New Madrid Seismic Zone, serves as a major cargo route, and traffic thoroughfare across the river. Work is being completed as funds are available. As part of this project, the main span, approaches, and ramps for the downtown exit are being retrofitted. A bridge about west of the main span was rebuilt with earthquake considerations. As the main span (the \\"M\\" portion) is located entirely within Tennessee, the funding formula is split 60%/40% between TDOT and AHTD. To date, $175 million has been spent with another $80 million expected. Incidents On August 23, 2007, an inspector discovered that a bridge pier on the approach bridge west of the river had settled overnight, and the bridge was subsequently closed to perform a precautionary inspection. The bridge was reopened later that day.

The origin of the name remains obscure.  History  The hill-top oppida originally inhabited by Ligures at the time of Massilia's foundation about 600 BC, which were strung out between the fords of the Rhône and Durance and the approaches to the Alpine passes, were not bound together by any uniting force; according to Strabo the older Greeks called these people Ligyes, and their territory Ligystike. Celtic cultural encroachments from the mid-3rd century BC are revealed in the archaeological record,Fernand Benoît, \\"The Celtic oppidum of Entremont, Provence\\" in Rupert Leo Scott Bruce-Mitford, ed. Recent archaeological excavations in Europe (London, 1975), pp. 227ff. and by the time of Strabo some authorities considered them a \\"mixed race\\" of Galli and Ligurians (hence Celtoligyes). They joined Bellovesus' migrations towards Italy, together with the Aeduii, Bituriges, Ambarri, Arverni, Aulerci, Carnutes and Senones.Livius, Ab Urbe condita 5.34–35.3. In 154 BC the Hellenic inhabitants of Massilia, who had been connected with the Romans by ties of friendship since the Second Punic War, appealed for aid against the Oxybii, who controlled the Argens valley and Decietes (or Deciates). These people, called by Livy \\"transalpine Ligurians\\", were perhaps two smaller tribes included under the general name of Salyes. They were defeated by the Roman consul Quintus Opimius. In 125–124 hostilities broke out once more between the Romans and the Salyes from the same cause. The successful operations of Marcus Fulvius Flaccus were continued by Gaius Sextius Calvinus (123–122), who definitely subdued the Salyes, destroyed their chief town at the site of Entremont, north of Marseille, which reverted to rural occupation, and founded near its ruins the colony of Aquae Sextiae (Aix- en-Provence). Part of their territory was handed over to the Massaliotes. Their king, Tutomotulus (or Teutomalius), took refuge with the Allobroges. From this time the Salyes practically disappear from history. In addition to the capital of the Salyes at Entremont, where two major routes crossed, the inland route from the fords of the Durance to the Alpine valleys and the natural coastal route linking Italy and Hispania, among other important Roman towns in their territory may be mentioned Tarusco or Tarasco (Tarascon), Arelate (Arles), Glanum (Saint-Rémy-de-Provence) and Ernaginum (Saint-Gabriel, now part of Tarascon).

Overview In the 1910s the North Eastern Railway made plans to electrify its York-Newcastle main line and this locomotive was built for hauling passenger trains. It had an electrically-heated boiler to generate steam for train heating. The wheels were arranged as in a 4-6-4 steam locomotive and the driving wheels were diameter. Each of the three driving axles was powered by a pair of traction motors. Electric locomotives of this design were common in continental Europe and the United States, but this was the only example on a British railway. After grouping in 1923 the London and North Eastern Railway dropped the electrification project so (apart from some trials on the Shildon line) the locomotive was never used. It survived into British Railways ownership but was withdrawn in August 1950, and scrapped on 15 December 1950. In common with other LNER electric locomotives, no classification was given to this locomotive until 4 October 1945, when no. 13 was classified EE1 (Electric Express 1).

They were of steeplecab design. Both locomotives passed to the London and North Eastern Railway in 1923 and then to British Railways in 1948, but both were withdrawn before TOPS. History As built, with the original bow collector The North Eastern Railway was an enthusiastic and relatively early adopter of electric traction for railways. As part of a 1902 scheme to electrify the suburban railway networks in the Tyneside area, the NER's Chief Mechanical Engineer, Wilson Worsdell, also wished to electrify a , horseshoe-shaped freight line that went from Trafalgar Yard in Manors to Newcastle Quayside Yard. Passing through three tunnels, this line had gradients as steep as 1:27 (3.70 %) and a number of sharp curves: it presented a formidable challenge for steam traction. Working conditions inside the tunnels were atrocious because the locomotives had to work exceptionally hard to manage the gradients which meant they produced vast quantities of choking fumes that could not disperse from the tunnels; the sparks they produced were a constant fire risk to the flammable packing materials in the yards. Electrification was the obvious answer. The specification for new electric locomotives demanded that they be able to start a train of 150 tons on the steepest gradient, while on the level they were expected to be able to haul at . The end-to-end journey on the branch was to be completed in 4.5 minutes. No. 26500 at Heaton Locomotive Depot 13 June 1954 In 1900 General Electric (GE) and Thomson-Houston designed and built a locomotive of the steeplecab type for the Milan-Varese railway in Italy, electrified at 650 V DC using the third rail system. That railway opened in 1901, and the locomotive design proved successful. The North Eastern Railway's ES1s were derived from that American design, although they were designed from the start for both third rail and overhead operation: the Newcastle Quay branch used both systems—third rail in the tunnels, and overhead lines on the rest of the line. A contract was signed with the British Thomson-Houston company on 15 December 1902, for delivery by the end of the following year. British Thomson-Houston sub-contracted the mechanical parts to Brush Electrical Engineering Co. The electrified line was operational from 5 June 1905 and in the following year both locomotives performed exceptionally well. In 1906 they were fitted with electric heaters, the men having complained they were too cold on wintry mornings. A few years later, the bow collectors originally fitted on their bonnets were removed and a pantograph installed on the roof instead. With few other changes, they remained in operation until the line was de-electrified and they were replaced with diesel locomotives on 29 February 1964. The line was closed five years later. Early photographs show the locomotives with \\"CLASS ELECTRIC 1\\" painted on the bufferbeams but this does not appear in official records. In common with other LNER electric locomotives, no classification was given to these locomotives until 4 October 1945, when nos. 1 & 2 were classified ES1 (Electric Shunting 1). No. 1 exchanged numbers with class D3 steam locomotive no. 4075 on 30 September 1944, but after the steam locomotive was again renumbered (to no. 2000), the electric locomotive was able to resume its original number on 24 October 1944. On 14 June 1946, nos. 1 & 2 were renumbered to 6480/1; and under British Railways, they became nos. 26500/1 in April 1948. Preservation From 1968 ES1 (number 26500 under British Rail's number scheme) was transferred to Leicester Railway Museum. After that closed, in 1977 it was taken into the National Collection of the National Railway Museum, and is currently on display at Locomotion, Shildon.

The founder of the family was Jean de Beaune (d. c. 1489), treasurer of Louis XI, who narrowly escaped death for conspiracy under Charles VIII.Un cahier de travail de l'inquisiteur Jean de Beaune His son, , baron de Semblançay, vicomte de Tours, became general of finances before 1497, and from 1518 was superintendent of finances. Convicted of peculation in connection with the supplies for the army in Italy, Jacques de Beaune was executed at Montfaucon on 9 August 1527. His eldest son, Martin de Beaune, who became archbishop of Tours in 1520, died in the same year as his father. Another son, Guillaume de Beaune, general of finances under his father, and banished from 1527 to 1535, was the father of Renaud de Beaune (1527–1606), archbishop of Bourges (1581) and archbishop of Sens (1595). His efforts at pacification during the wars of religion culminated in the conversion of Henry IV, and it was he who presided at the ceremony of the king's abjuration of Protestantism on 25 July 1593. Renaud was one of the most famous orators of his time, and records of some of his speeches still exist, as well as his Reformation de l'université de Paris (1605 and 1667).

With San Teodoro it forms the West Central (Centro Ovest) municipio. Geography Sampierdarena lies on the coast about west of the centre of Genoa. In 2000 the population was 67,741. History Sampierdarena was an ancient fishing village, named after the church of San Pietro d'Arena (\\"St. Peter of the Sand\\"). During the Italian Renaissance it became a residential area, with great palaces being built such as the Palazzo Imperiale Scassi, designed by Domenico and Giovanni Ponzello according to the style of Galeazzo Alessi and for this reason believed in the past to be a work of Alessi himself and the Palazzo Spinola di San Pietro (whose designer is unknown), one of those drawn by the painter Peter Paul Rubens in the book Palazzi di Genova, published in Antwerp in 1622.

Ansaldo & C. was one of the leading companies of the area involved in shipbuilding and armaments, before it was finally taken over by Finmeccanica in 1993. In 1926 the comune of Sampierdarena was absorbed by Greater Genoa, becoming in 1969 a delegazione, and in 1978 a circoscrizione of the city. At present it is part of the Genoa's city Municipio II (Centro Ovest), together with the neighbourhood of San Teodoro.

The Language of Law and the Foundations of American Constitutionalism, p. 172 (2010). Jacob was the leading legal writer of his era, according to the Yale Law Library.Greenwood, Ryan. \\"The Taussig Collection: Giles Jacob\\" (January 8, 2014). The literary works of Giles Jacob did not fare as well as his legal ones, and he feuded with the poet Alexander Pope both publicly and in literary form. Pope named Jacob as one of the dunces in his 1728 Dunciad, referring to Jacob as \\"the blunderbuss of the law\\". Jacob is remembered well for his legal writing, though not so much for his poetry and plays. Early life Giles was born in Romsey, Hampshire, and was baptized on 22 November 1686.Kilburn, Matthew. \\"Giles Jacob\\" in Matthew, H.C.G. and Brian Harrison, eds. The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography. vol. 29, 546–7. London: Oxford UP, 2004. Among eight children, Giles was the only son of Henry and Susannah Jacob. Henry Jacob was a maltster who lived until 1735. Giles Jacob's legal training included employment by Thomas Freke, and then as a secretary to Sir William Blathwayt.Rudolph, Julia. Common Law and Enlightenment in England, 1689-1750, p. 65 (Boydell Press, 2013). Working for Blathwayt, he engaged in litigation and dispensation, probably in manorial courts. Writing career Jacob's first book, The Compleat Court-Keeper (1713), gives detailed and practical instructions for how to administer estate matters. He combined this with a chronological summary of statute law, and the combination was financially successful. Jacob always had an interest in contemporary poetry and the literary life, and in 1714 he wrote a farce called Love in a Wood, or, The Country Squire. This play was never produced. He persisted, however, and in 1717 he wrote a satire of Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock in the form of The Rape of the Smock. The poem was low and bawdy, and the next year he wrote a serious work titled Tractatus de hermaphroditis about the legal status of intersex people, published by Edmund Curll in 1718 (along with the first English-language publication of Ioannes Henricus Meibomius's A treatise of the use of flogging in venereal affairs). Title page from an 1811 edition of Jacob's The New Law Dictionary. In 1719, two works appeared by Jacob, both very successful. The first was Lex constitutionis, which was a thoroughly researched compendium of statute law, common law, and criminal law, schematized according to which powers of the executive branch of the government were involved. While the work's fame and usefulness were surpassed in a few years, Jacob's book was a well regarded analysis. The same year, he produced the first volume of the Poetical Register, with a second volume in 1720. This work provided biographies of contemporary authors as well as earlier ones. According to the literary editor Stephen Jones:Baker, David and Jones, Stephen. Biographia Dramatica: pt.1. Authors and Actors: A-H, p. lxxii (Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme & Brown, 1812). > [H]e is generally accurate and faithful, and affords much information to > those who have occasion to consult him. It cannot be denied that he > possessed very small abilities; but he was fully equal to a task where > plodding industry, and not genius, must be deemed the essential > qualification. In the Poetical Register, Jacob criticized the play Three Hours After Marriage (1717), which had been written by John Gay with anonymous assistance from John Arbuthnot and Alexander Pope.Griffith, Reginald. Alexander Pope: A Bibliography, Volume 1, Issue 1, p. 59 (Univ. f Texas, 1922). Jacob wrote that its scenes \\"trespass[ed] on Female Modesty\\". He subsequently criticized that play for \\"obscenity and false Pretence\\". Jacob had admired Pope, had been on good terms with him, and had submitted the biographical entry of Pope (in the Poetical Register) to Pope himself for correction. Jacob likely did not realize that Three Hours After Marriage had been anonymously co-authored by Pope. In The Dunciad of 1728, Pope pounced: > Jacob, the scourge of grammar, mark with awe, Nor less revere him, > blunderbuss of law. Pope explained Jacob's offense as follows: \\"he very grossly and unprovoked abused in that book [the Poetical Register] the author’s friend, Mr. Gay\\".Lounsbury, Thomas.The Text of Shakespeare: Its History from the Publication of the Quartos and Folios Down to and Including the Publication of the Editions of Pope and Theobald, Volume 3, p. 324 (C. Scribner's sons, 1908). The play Three Hours After Marriage was panned by most critics as obscene, and literary historian Thomas Lounsbury has explained that no one criticized the play \\"without incurring [from Pope] an enmity that never died out\\". In 1725, Jacob wrote The Student's Companion and regarded it as his favorite of the books he had written. It was a guide to studying law, with practical tips, reviews, and indexes. In 1729, his most famous work, nine years in the making, appeared: A New Law Dictionary. It combined a dictionary of legal practice with an abridgment of statute law, and it reached its fifth edition by the time of Jacob's death. As late as 1807, \\"Jacob's Law Dictionary\\" was still a very profitable copyright. His last work was Every Man his Own Lawyer, which outsold even the law dictionary. It was a self-help book for average citizens who might be involved in litigation. Jacob's legal writings were of a practical and descriptive sort, often compared unfavorably to the analytic and theoretical treatises by authors like William Blackstone. But, according to historian Julia Rudolph, authors like Jacob had a different purpose, in that they \\"were dealing with the problem of knowledge management or 'information overload,' and in response to this problem the learning of the law was systematized, alphabetized, and organized.\\"Rudolph, Julia. \\"That 'Blunderbuss of Law': Giles Jacob, Abridgment, and Print Culture\\", Studies in Eighteenth-Century Culture, Volume 37, pp. 197-215 (2008). Jacob's most successful non-legal writing was of a similarly practical and descriptive sort. Personal life Jacob married Jane Dexter in 1733, and they had at least one daughter, also named Jane. He and his family moved to Staines, Middlesex, where he died on 8 May 1744.

It is lightweight and resistant to oxidation and heat, however it suffers from low ductility. The density of γ-TiAl is about 4.0 g/cm³. It finds use in several applications including aircraft, jet engines, sporting equipment and automobiles. The development of TiAl based alloys began circa 1970. The alloys have been used in these applications only since about 2000. Titanium aluminide has three major intermetallic compounds: gamma TiAl, alpha 2-Ti3Al and TiAl3. Among the three, gamma TiAl has received the most interest and applications. Applications of gamma-TiAl Pole figures displaying crystallographic texture of gamma-TiAl in a rolled sheet of alpha2-gamma alloy, as measured by high energy X-rays. Gamma TiAl has excellent mechanical properties and oxidation and corrosion resistance at elevated temperatures (over 600 degrees Celsius), which makes it a possible replacement for traditional Ni based superalloy components in aircraft turbine engines. TiAl-based alloys have potential to increase the thrust-to-weight ratio in aircraft engines. This is especially the case with the engine's low- pressure turbine blades and the high-pressure compressor blades. These are traditionally made of Ni-based superalloy, which is nearly twice as dense as TiAl-based alloys. Some gamma titanium aluminide alloys retain strength and oxidation resistance to 1000 °C, which is 400 °C higher than the operating temperature limit of conventional titanium alloys. General Electric uses gamma TiAl for the low-pressure turbine blades on its GEnx engine, which powers the Boeing 787 and Boeing 747-8 aircraft. This was the first large-scale use of this material on a commercial jet engine when it entered service in 2011. The TiAl LPT blades are cast by Precision Castparts Corp. and Avio s.p.a.. Machining of the Stage 6, and Stage 7 LPT blades is performed by Moeller Manufacturing.Moeller Manufacturing, Aerospace Division, in Wixom, Michigan, USA An alternate pathway for production of the gamma TiAl blades for the GEnx and GE9x engines using additive manufacturing is being explored. In 2019 a new 55g lightweight version of the Omega Seamaster wristwatch was made, using gamma titanium aluminide for the case, backcase and crown, and a titanium dial and mechanism in Ti 6/4 (grade 5). The retail price of this watch at £37,240 was nine times that of the basic Seamaster and comparable to the top of the range platinum-cased version with a moonphase complication.

It is the receptor of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). The GnRHR is expressed on the surface of pituitary gonadotrope cells as well as lymphocytes, breast, ovary, and prostate. This receptor is a 60 kDa G protein-coupled receptor and resides primarily in the pituitary and is responsible for eliciting the actions of GnRH after its release from the hypothalamus. Upon activation, the LHRHr stimulates tyrosine phosphatase and elicits the release of LH from the pituitary. Evidence exists showing the presence of GnRH and its receptor in extrapituitary tissues as well as a role in progression of some cancers. Function Following binding of GnRH, the GnRHR associates with G-proteins that activate a phosphatidylinositol (PtdIns)-calcium second messenger system. Activation of the GnRHR ultimately causes the release of follicle stimulating hormone (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). Genes There are two major forms of the GNRHR, each encoded by a separate gene (GNRHR and GNRHR2). Alternative splicing of the GNRHR gene, GNRHR, results in multiple transcript variants encoding different isoforms. More than 18 transcription initiation sites in the 5' region and multiple polyA signals in the 3' region have been identified for GNRHR. Regulation The GnRHR responds to GnRH as well as to synthetic GnRH agonists. Agonists stimulate the receptor, however prolonged exposure leads to a downregulation effect resulting in hypogonadism, an effect that is often medically utilized. GnRH antagonists block the receptor and inhibit gonadotropin release. GnRHRs are further regulated by the presence of sex hormones as well as activin and inhibin. Ligands =Agonists= Peptides * Azagly-nafarelin * Buserelin * Deslorelin * Fertirelin * GnRH * Gonadorelin * Goserelin * Histrelin * Lecirelin * Leuprorelin * Nafarelin * Peforelin * Triptorelin =Antagonists= Peptides * Abarelix * Cetrorelix * Degarelix * Ganirelix * Ozarelix Non-peptides * Elagolix * Linzagolix * Opigolix * Relugolix * Sufugolix =Pharmacoperones= Current research is looking into pharmacoperones, or chemical chaparones that promote the shuttling of mature Gonadotropin- releasing hormone receptor (GNRHR) protein to the cell surface, leading to a functional protein. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor function has been shown to be deleteriously effected by point mutations in its gene. Some of these mutations, when expressed, cause the receptor to remain in the cytosol. An approach to rescue receptor function utilizes pharmacoperones or molecular chaperones, which are typically small molecules that rescue misfolded proteins to the cell surface. These interact with the receptor to restore cognate receptor function devoid of antagonist or agonist activity. This approach, when effective, should increase therapeutic reach. Pharmacoperones have been identified that restore function of Gonadotropin-releasing hormone receptor. Clinical implications Defects in the GnRHR are a cause of hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH). Normal puberty begins between ages 8 and 14 in girls and between 9 and 14 in boys. Puberty, however, for some children can come much sooner or much later or in many cases never occurs and thereby contributes to the estimated 35-70 million infertile couples worldwide. Among children, the abnormally early or late onset of puberty exerts intense emotional and social stress that too often goes untreated. The timely onset of puberty is regulated by many factors and one factor that is often referred to as the master regulator of puberty and reproduction is GnRH. This peptide hormone is produced in the hypothalamus but gets secreted and acts upon GnRHRs in the anterior pituitary to exert its effects on reproductive maturation. Understanding how GnRHR functions has been key to developing clinical strategies to treat reproductive-related disorders.

In the early books of the Serrano Legacy, the government is headed by a monarchy. As the story progresses, the abdication of the King after the Cloning Scandal caused the Council (equivalent of the House of Lords in the United Kingdom) to appoint an elected official to govern. Political makeup The council is made up of members of the Ruling Families. These families have many business interests throughout known space, and political decisions are closely linked to business needs. Non-members of the Ruling Families have little to no control over the choice of leaders and the everyday running of their government. It is likely that the Ruling Families were initially a business arrangement which became a form of government as business relationships grew and merged. Their government is run according to a set of bylaws and there is no constitution or other set framework in place. Make up of military forces The Military Forces of the Familias Regnant is made up of two distinct forces: =Regular Space Service= The \\"Regs are the professional section of the Familias Military Forces, primarily made up of space capable vessels crewed by highly experienced crews. They also have planet combat elements and are responsible for the enforcement of law and order in Familias Space. The RSS was initially created from the private militias of the 14 ruling families. Known founding member families are the Serrano and Livadhi families. Unlike most senior fleet families, the Serranos have no patron due to the occupants of Altiplano led by the Suiza family over- throwing them and in this process killing them (the Suiza/modern Altiplan(an) version of the history has the Founders dying in the plague which was part of the cause of the initial revolt). The true version of the story was never determined during the storyline. Prior to this amalgamation each militia owed loyalty only to its patron's family. Notable characters in the Regular Space Service * Commander Heris Serrano * Lieutenant Esmay Suiza * Commander/Admiral Minor Arash Livadhi * Admiral Vida Serrano * Ensign Barin Serrano While Heris is captain of the yacht, and captain of the various vessels she commands after her return to the RSS, there is no rank of captain in the RSS. The rank structure is equivalent to the US Navy, with the apparent exception being that starting with O-4, there is a change in the structure. Moon, a former US Marine, uses the Marine, Army, and Air Force rank of major after the rank of lieutenant. She then continues the naval ranks so that an O-5 would be a lieutenant commander, and an O-6 would be a commander. The last rank before \\"flag rank\\" is commander. This is the equivalent of a captain in the US Navy, or a colonel in the other services. It appears, in this series, that \\"captain\\" is used only to refer to the captain of a vessel, of any rank, which is the tradition in the Navy. The flag ranks, in the novels, appear to be admiral minor, admiral major, and grand admiral (which may be a position instead of a formal rank). While Garrivay calls himself \\"commodore\\",Novel Winning Colors the subsequent conversation with Captain Serrano makes clear that this is a position, not a rank. =Royal Aeronautical Space Service= Is a non-professional space force with officers primarily taken from families of the chair holders. They have a reputation as being arrogant and unprofessional, existing primarily to live a life of luxury. While this holds true of the officer class, it appears, taken from Esmay Suiza's thoughts in the beginning of Rules of Engagement, that Royal Security may also be a part of the Royal Aero-Space Service. Known as the Royal Ass to the members of the RSS. Other political elements in the Familias world The Familias is only one form of government in existence in the galaxy. Other known groups are: * The Benignity of the Compassionate Hand * The Bloodhorde * The New Texas Militia * The Lone Star Confederation * The Guernesi Republic * The Baltic Confederation The Benignity of the Compassionate Hand is a dictatorial government bordering Familias space. The government is predominantly driven by profit, and failure is usually punished by death. The view from the Familias is that The Benignity is a criminal enterprise governed by criminals who have become the official government. There exists an uneasy peace between the Benignity and the Familias, punctuated by minor skirmishes and border disputes. They are organized in a manner reminiscent of the Mafia. Another major influence on Benignity policy is the \\"Church\\" which appears to have been a descendant of the Catholic (and perhaps Orthodox) Church. However, the Church's role in the Benignity social and political structure indicates that it is a very changed role from that of the 21st century church's. The Benignity is also known as the \\"Black Scratch, or more officially the \\"Benignity, or the \\"Compassionate Hand. The Bloodhorde is a coalition of pirates operating at the edge of Familias Space. Predominantly from Aethar's World, their government is based on tribal lines similar to the Vikings. The New Texas Godfearing Militia is one of several groups of fanatics descended from old Earth radicals who believe women must be controlled and kept in their place for a godly society to prosper, as in literally kept \\"barefoot and pregnant\\". They attacked the Familias Regnant by stealing ordnance and piracy against their ships and the ships of other systems. On one such raid they captured and decided to keep Lord Thornbuckle's daughter Brun and use her as breeding stock. The Lone Star Confederation was settled by people from the old earth, many from the state of Texas, though other colonists were from other parts of North America, presumably with them primarily being from the U.S. and Canada. The Lone Star Confederation is one of the trading partners of the Familias Regnant, and they have no relation, other than in name, to the New Texas Militia. In fact, one of their Rangers was dispatched to the Familias Regnant after the kidnapping of Lord Thornbuckle's daughter to clear up any confusion between their states over their connection to the New Texas Militia. The Guernesi Republic is a very advanced state bordering the Familias Regnant known for its medical and other advanced technology. They were involved in the clone crises that brought down the king and their agents helped in the retrieval of Lord Thornbuckle's daughter Brun from the New Texas Militia. The Baltic Confederation is only mentioned in passing. Its organization, beliefs, form of government etc. are unknown.

He began his career in Moscow, but had his greatest influence in London. He was noted for groundbreaking productions of plays by Chekhov and Shakespeare. Life and career =Early years= Komisarjevsky was born in Venice, the son of Fyodor Komissarzhevsky and his second wife, Lithuanian Princess Marie Kursevich.Borovsky, p. 80 Fyodor was the principal tenor of the Imperial Opera in Saint Petersburg and the teacher of the influential theatre director Konstantin Stanislavsky. The actress Vera Komissarzhevskaya was Theodore's elder half-sister.Marshall, Norman, \\"Komisarjevsky, Theodore (1882–1954)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004, retrieved 18 January 2015 He was educated at Saint Petersburg University and the Imperial Institute of Architecture.\\"Obituary – Mr Komisarjevsky – Civilization and the Stage\\", The Times, 19 April 1954, p. 8 In 1907 Komisarjevsky directed his first production, for his half-sister's theatre in Moscow. (She died in 1910, aged 45.) In the same year he founded a drama school in Moscow, adding a studio- theatre in her memory in 1914. During the rest of the Imperial era, and later under the Soviet régime, Komisarjevsky worked as a producer and director in Moscow until 1919, when, fearing arrest by the secret police, he escaped to Paris. On the advice of his fellow émigré Serge Diaghilev he went from there to London. Sir Thomas Beecham appointed him to direct the opera Prince Igor at Covent Garden, described by The Times as \\"outstanding … [a] magnificent production\\". Further operatic work followed in Paris and New York. Greatly disapproving of the short rehearsal time allotted to some of his operatic work, he became known for his insistence on adequate preparation. In June 1921 the tenor Vladimir Rosing presented a season of \\"Opera Intime\\" at the Aeolian Hall in London, directed by Komisarjevsky and conducted by Adrian Boult.Boult, p. 48 The operas given were The Queen of Spades, The Barber of Seville, Bastien und Bastienne and Pagliacci.Untitled news item, The Observer, 26 June 1921, p. 8 The Times commented that the staging gave an \\"irritating sense of amateurishness\\";\\"The Queen of Spades\\", The Times, 27 June 1921, p. 8 The Observer judged that Komisarjevsky had been \\"very ingenious\\" in adapting the operas for the small stage.\\"Music of the Week\\", The Observer, 3 July 1921, p. 10 =London and Chekhov= In 1921 Komsarjevsky earned good notices for his production of Chekhov's Uncle Vanya for the Stage Society, in Constance Garnett's translation. He was praised for capturing the authentic Russian atmosphere of the play as English directors had failed to do.\\"Uncle Vanya\\", The Times, 29 November 1921, p. 8 For the next five years he produced and sometimes designed productions in London with success, and he became more widely known in 1925 and 1926 when he collaborated with Philip Ridgeway, the proprietor of the small Barnes Theatre in a western suburb of London, in a succession of Russian plays. He assembled a company including John Gielgud, Charles Laughton, Jean Forbes-Robertson, Jeanne de Casalis and Martita Hunt. His productions of Chekhov in particular changed how British actors, audiences and critics understood the dramatist's works. The critic J T Grein wrote in 1926: In 1932 Komisarjevsky became a British national. In the same year he worked for the first time at the Shakespeare Memorial Theatre in Stratford- upon-Avon. Critics thought his production of The Merchant of Venice spectacular but distracting from Shakespeare's text.\\"Stratford-On-Avon\\", The Times, 26 July 1932, p. 10 The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography (ODNB) refers to his Shakespeare productions as \\"unorthodox and provocative, sometimes brilliant, sometimes merely wayward\\", and comments that he showed little respect for the texts or for Shakespeare's poetry. Nonetheless the ODNB judges them valuable for showing up conventional productions as routine and humdrum. Komisarjevsky, though bald, short and \\"no Adonis\\", as one of his many conquests described him, was a persistent and successful womaniser.Borovsky, p. 339 Edith Evans, one who did not succumb to his charms, dubbed him \\"Come- and-seduce-me\\".Borovsky, p. 340 His first marriage, to Elfriede de Jarosy, ended in divorce.

He devoted his time more to lecturing and teaching than to production. One theatrical venture was in Canada, where he directed Cymbeline in 1950 for the Montreal Festival of Music and Drama.\\"French Theatre In Montreal\\", The Times, 30 May 1950, p. 3 In the last year of his life the Arts Theatre in London invited him to direct there, but his health did not permit it. In 1946 Komisarjevsky made his debut with the New York City Opera, staging Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin. With that company, he went on to direct Andrea Chénier, Don Giovanni, Aïda (with Camilla Williams, Suzy Morris, Ramón Vinay, and Lawrence Winters, with George Balanchine as choreographer), L'amour des trois oranges (in a production \\"devised by\\" Komisarjevsky; he became ill before the opening), and, in 1952, Wozzeck (with Marko Rothmüller and Patricia Neway). Komisarjevsky died at his home in Darien, Connecticut, on 17 April 1954, survived by his third wife, the dancer Ernestine Stodelle (1905–2008).Borovsky, p. 457 It is not known how many children he left from his various affairs, but the ODNB records two sons and one daughter. Legacy Komisarjevsky wrote several books. Those published in English include Myself and the Theatre (1930), The Costume of the Theatre (1931) and The Theatre and a changing Civilization (1935). His books in Russian include Theatrical Preludes; The Costume, and The Art of the Actor. Komisarjevsky left a lasting legacy in London in the shape of theatre and cinema interiors he designed, including the Phoenix Theatre in Charing Cross Road, the Tooting Granada, the first cinema to be awarded Grade I-listed building status, the Woolwich Granada, and six other auditoria for the same chain.\\"Komisarjevsky, Theodore\\", Who Was Who, Oxford University Press, 2014, retrieved 28 January 2015 File:Gala Bingo (former Granada Cinema), Tooting 32.jpgTooting Granada File:Granada Tooting.JPGTooting Granada File:2015 London-Woolwich, interior former Granada Cinema27.jpgWoolwich Granada File:2015 London-Woolwich, interior former Granada Cinema25.jpgWoolwich, staircase Notes References External links * Komisarjevsky in Encyclopædia Britannica * Komisarjevsky in Krugosvet Encyclopedia * Komisarjevsky in St Petersburg Encyclopedia Category:1882 births Category:1954 deaths Category:People from Venice Category:Russian and Soviet theatre directors Category:British theatre directors Category:British opera directors Category:Imperial Russian emigrants to the United Kingdom Category:Imperial Russian emigrants to the United States Category:Imperial Russian emigrants to Italy ","title":"Theodore Komisarjevsky"},{"id":"3922845","text":"Snezhnogorsk () is the name of several urban localities in Russia: *Snezhnogorsk, Murmansk Oblast, a town under the administrative jurisdiction of the closed administrative-territorial formation of Alexandrovsk in Murmansk Oblast *Snezhnogorsk, Krasnoyarsk Krai, a work settlement under the administrative jurisdiction of Tsentralny City District of the krai city of Norilsk in Krasnoyarsk Krai ","title":"Snezhnogorsk"},{"id":"3922846","text":"Discovery Holding Company was an American company headquartered in Meridian, Colorado.

Situated on the upper reaches of the Tiber river, the town is the birthplace of the painters Piero della Francesca, Raffaellino del Colle (a pupil of Raphael), Matteo di Giovanni, Santi di Tito and Angiolo Tricca. It was also the birthplace of the Italian mathematician Luca Pacioli, and of Matteo Cioni, who translated Piero della Francesca's treatise about perspective in painting (De prospectiva pingendi) into Latin. Today, the economy of the town is based on agriculture, industrial manufacturing, food processing and pharmaceuticals. It is the home of Buitoni pasta, founded by Giulia Buitoni in 1827. History According to tradition the founding of the town came about through two 9th-century pilgrims to the Holy Land, Arcanus and Giles, who returned to the region and built a chapel dedicated to Saint Leonard—whose ruins now lie underneath the current Cathedral of Sansepolcro—where they established a monastic way of life. They had brought a stone from the Church of the Holy Sepulcher in Jerusalem (thus, San Sepolcro) with them from that shrine which led to the name of the monastery, as it became a popular pilgrimage site. It soon grew to become the Benedictine Abbey of Sansepolcro (the Badia). The monastery was declared an abbey nullius. The first historical mentions of Sansepolcro date to 1012, referring to the construction of the monastery, around which a commune began to develop due to its being declared a market town by the Emperor Conrad II, Holy Roman Emperor. The abbey chose to affiliate itself with the monks of the Camaldolese Order, based in the area, in the following century. During the conflicts between the Guelfs and Ghibellines, the town's factions were headed by prominent local families, including the Pichi, Bercordati, Graziani and Bacci.Marilyn Aronberg Lavin, Piero della Francesca 2002:14. Due to its central location on the local trade routes, in the 13th century control of the town was contested and seized by various forces of the region, passing from Uguccione della Faggiola, Lord of Pisa, to Guido Tarlati, Bishop of Arezzo, and his brother, Pier Saccone Tarlati di Pietramala, who ruled it from Città di Castello, and then to the rule of the Papal States. The local dialect in fact derives from the Citta' di Castello one and the Casentino valley one that arrived later. In 1367 Pope Urban V gave the town and its surrounding contrada to the Malatesta family, whose heirs ruled it until control was assumed by the Republic of Florence in the 15th century with the approval of Pope Eugene IV. It was raised to the rank of a city a century later by Pope Leo X. During World War II, the town was saved from destruction by the efforts of Tony Clarke, a British Royal Horse Artillery officer who halted the Allied artillery attack in order to save Piero della Francesca's fresco Resurrection.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-16306893 Main sights The main church is the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist built in Gothic- Romanesque style in 1012-49\\\\. Other churches of note are San Francesco and San Lorenzo. The latter church has a Deposition by Rosso Fiorentino. The English writer Aldous Huxley described the Resurrection by Piero della Francesca, which is in the Museo Civico, as \\"the greatest painting in the world\\".

He debuted in 1st Issue Special #8, (Nov. 1975), and was created by Mike Grell as a foil for Travis Morgan the Warlord. This should not be confused with the Deimos who is one of the Children of Ares. Fictional character biography Initially Deimos used advanced New Atlantean science to achieve his ends, later he became an adept of black magic. Deimos was a high priest of the kingdom of Thera who used knowledge hidden in the legendary Scrolls of Blood to ascend to the throne of that city-state. Not content with a single city-state, he plotted to conquer all of Skartaris only to be foiled by Travis Morgan—now known as the Warlord. =Mask of Life= Deimos was killed by Morgan after kidnapping the hero's paramour, Tara. However, he was soon resurrected by one of his lackeys using the Mask of Life. Deimos initially pretended to be a sorcerer, but his power actually came from access to New Atlantean technology. After being resurrected by the Mask of Life, Deimos became immortal and could transform himself into a serpent or dragon. He could also summon demons from an unknown dimension to do his bidding. The vengeful Deimos kidnapped and cloned Morgan's son Joshua to do battle with his father. Morgan slew both the Joshua clone and Deimos. =Evil One= Deimos was resurrected several more times before striking a bargain with the Evil One. The Evil One brought the would-be conqueror to life a final time, but stripped him of his powers. Eventually, Morgan and Deimos entered combat for the last time, and Deimos was beheaded and his head thrown to a wolf pack. =Convergence= In the 2015 crossover story Convergence, the heroes of various key cities from Earth's multiverse and throughout history are transported to the planet Telos by a godlike incarnation of Brainiac and forced to engage in deadly combat. The heroes of Earth-2 soon encounter the hidden city of Skartaris underneath, and make an alliance with Deimos to overthrow Brainiac's envoy, a being named Telos, but are later betrayed when Deimos reveals he has captured the various time travellers of the Multiverse and uses their power to defeat Brainiac and instigate a crisis that will remould the multiverse in his image. He is challenged by heroes from all worlds and nearly defeats them all, but is killed the cosmic power of Parallax-era Hal Jordan. The release of chronal energies threatens to destroy the entire Multiverse, with no ensuing reboot. Ultimately a new Waverider is able to summon Brainiac back, who helps Parallax and the pre-2011 incarnation of Superman to travel back in time to DC's original large-scale reboot crossover, Crisis on Infinite Earths, and alter its outcome, thus recreating an infinitely varied Multiverse. Powers and abilities Deimos had no inherent powers, but relied on New Atlantean technology at his disposal, pretending to be a sorcerer while using it. When he died and was brought back to life by the Mask of Life, he became immortal, could transform into a dragon or serpent, and summon demons. The Evil One has taken these abilities away from him when he resurrected him. In other media =Television= * Deimos appeared in an episode of Justice League Unlimited entitled \\"Chaos at the Earth's Core\\" voiced by Douglas Dunning. He is seen trying to conquer Skartaris. During his campaign, he was supplied futuristic weapons by Secret Society members Metallo and Silver Banshee in exchange for a huge Kryptonite rock. During a battle with Warlord, he met his apparent demise when he plummeted down a ledge. =Toys= * In 1982, several of the characters from the \\"Warlord\\" series received action figures in a line called \\"Lost World of the Warlord\\" from Remco. Deimos was one of the figures (along with Warlord, Machiste, Rostov, and Hercules). * In 2011, Deimos received an action figure in Mattel's Justice League Unlimited line, in a multi-pack alongside Warlord and Supergirl.

Located in the tri-state area of Illinois, Kentucky, and Missouri, it connects Cairo, Illinois at its northern terminus to Bird's Point, Missouri at its southern terminus. The bridge was most recently closed for renovation from March 16, 2015 to October 13, 2015. The bridge measures 5,175.5 feet (1,577.5 meters) in length with a main span of 700.9 feet (213.6 meters) and a width of 20 feet (6.1 meters). At its apex, the bridge stands 114 feet (35 meters) above the river with a 675-foot (206-meter) navigation channel and a river depth of 279 feet (85 meters). History At the start of the Civil War in 1861, this area was the southern extreme of American land in which slavery was prohibited (other than the disjoint portion of California). On April 15, 1865, the morning after the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, the steamboat Sultana was docked near Fort Defiance where 12,000 Union troops were stationed. Less than two weeks later the steamboat, carrying in excess of 2,000 released Union prisoners of war, exploded near Memphis en route back to Cairo, remaining the deadliest ship disaster in American history. In 1876, famed novelist Mark Twain described this vicinity as a \\"dismal swamp\\" in his classic novel The Adventures of Tom Sawyer. The bridge originated as a toll bridge in 1929, constructed by the American Bridge Company and the Missouri Valley Bridge & Iron Co..Map of Missouri Showing State Road System , January 1, 1930 Traveling downstream, the Cairo Mississippi River Bridge is the southernmost crossing of the Mississippi River prior to its confluence with the Ohio River and lies just 2000 feet west of the mouth of the Ohio. Shortly after its completion, a second structure was opened in 1937 connecting Kentucky to Illinois now known as the Cairo Ohio River Bridge, its western terminus only 1000 feet from the Cairo Mississippi River Bridge. In 1954 the toll was removed. In the years since the construction of the two bridges, the town of Cairo has experienced an 81% population decline (1930 to 2010), the most dramatic decrease of any principal city in the United States. The bridges initially played a part in the town's demise as the ferry and railroad industries were severely impacted. In 1978, the Cairo I-57 Bridge was completed less than five miles upstream, bypassing Cairo and contributing to its further decline. File:Cairo IL Mississippi R Bridge P6190061.jpgEastern approach File:CairoMississippiRiverBridge.jpgView from the north end Aviation incident Legend has it that in 1956, a student pilot from southern Missouri's Malden Air Base was alone in a T-28 Trojan aircraft when he decided to fly under the bridge. He had allegedly been planning this maneuver for some time, scouting it from the air and the ground. The story goes that the pilot flew under the bridge, pulled into a loop, and narrowly missed the bridge when he flew under the structure a second time, skimming the water and damaging the wings and roughly 12 inches of the outer tips of the propellers. He returned to the air base where he allegedly attributed the damage to a \\"rough running engine,\\" his eventual confession leading to his removal from the flight training program. Deterioration and repair The bridge would be completely reconstructed in 1983. Since that time, only one significant incident has taken place on the water below. On May 18, 1996, a towboat moving 21 barges upstream bumped a bridge pier damaging the lead barge but not the bridge itself. The structure was further rehabilitated in 2005. On November 29, 2010, in an attempt to slow the deterioration of the aging structure, the Illinois Department of Transportation (IDOT) reduced the bridge's weight limit to 15 tons. At that time, roughly 3,500 vehicles traversed the span daily, of which nearly one quarter were tractor-trailers. The signs were largely ignored by truck drivers, accumulating nearly $70,000 of traffic fines in less than three months. In January 2011, the bridge was finally shut down for the entire year, engineers identifying 25 of 108 deck beams suffering significant rust and degradation. The closure caused a 17-mile detour for motorists. Three months later, the area was inundated with water during the 2011 Mississippi River flood. On May 10, the river crested at 47.8 feet in Memphis, topping 46 feet around the Cairo Mississippi River Bridge by May 20. Any depth greater than 43 feet necessitates a closure, but the bridge was already shut down due to the ongoing repairs. The bridge was finally reopened in March 2012. On February 24, 2015, it was announced that the 86-year-old structure needed $3 million in significant joint and beam repairs and general rehabilitation. It was thus closed on March 16, 2015 by IDOT. It was scheduled to be closed for a period of one year until March 18, 2016, but reopened far ahead of schedule on October 13, 2015. On October 10, 2019, a weight limit of 33 tons was imposed on the aging structure, effective October 24, 2019.

Commercial samples usually are amber to red/brown, due to weak bromine contamination. It is decomposed by water and alcohols. Chemical properties Boron tribromide is commercially available and is a strong Lewis acid. It is an excellent demethylating or dealkylating agent for the cleavage of ethers, also with subsequent cyclization, often in the production of pharmaceuticals. The mechanism of dealkylation of tertiary alkyl ethers proceeds via the formation of a complex between the boron center and the ether oxygen followed by the elimination of an alkyl bromide to yield a dibromo(organo)borane. :ROR + BBr3 → RO+(−BBr3)R → ROBBr2 \\\\+ RBr Aryl methyl ethers (as well as activated primary alkyl ethers), on the other hand are dealkylated through a bimolecular mechanism involving two BBr3-ether adducts. :RO+(−BBr3)CH3 \\\\+ RO+(−BBr3)CH3→ RO(−BBr3) + CH3Br + RO+(BBr2)CH3 The dibromo(organo)borane can then undergo hydrolysis to give a hydroxyl group, boric acid, and hydrogen bromide as products. :ROBBr2 \\\\+ 3H2O → ROH + B(OH)3 \\\\+ 2HBr It also finds applications in olefin polymerization and in Friedel- Crafts chemistry as a Lewis acid catalyst. The electronics industry uses boron tribromide as a boron source in pre-deposition processes for doping in the manufacture of semiconductors. Boron tribromide also mediates the dealkylation of aryl alkyl ethers, for example demethylation of 3,4-dimethoxystyrene into 3,4-dihydroxystyrene. Synthesis The reaction of boron carbide with bromine at temperatures above 300 °C leads to the formation of boron tribromide. The product can be purified by vacuum distillation. History The first synthesis was done by M. Poggiale in 1846 by reacting boron trioxide with carbon and bromine at high temperatures: :B2O3 \\\\+ 3 C + 3 Br2 → 2 BBr3 \\\\+ 3 CO An improvement of this method was developed by F. Wöhler and Deville in 1857. By starting from amorphous boron the reaction temperatures are lower and no carbon monoxide is produced: :2 B + 3 Br2 → 2 BBr3 Applications Boron tribromide is used in organic synthesis, pharmaceutical manufacturing, image processing, semiconductor doping, semiconductor plasma etching, and photovoltaic manufacturing.

Laing, Self and Others (Penguin 1969) p. 41 Often described as part of the \\"antipsychiatry\\" movement, Laing struggled to see things in terms of existentialism, emphasising the difference between \\"being\\" or \\"being in this world\\" and being alive. \\"An issue essential to an existential analysis of action is to what extent and in what ways the agent is disclosed or concealed...in and through action.\\"Laing, Self p. 126 Being in the existentialist sense means being an object for others, and having others as objects, in other words carrying a model in our heads of all the significant others in our lives. This model provided the motivation for many of our thoughts and actions, and without it we \\"cease to be\\" in a very real sense. It is this need for others, in order to \\"be\\", which makes us afraid to contradict a family nexus, risking family exclusion. However \\"to a number of people the phantasy system of the nexus is a lousy hell, not an enchanting spell, and they want out...But within the phantasy of the nexus, to leave is an act of ingratitude, or cruelty, or suicide, or murder...Herein is the risk of defeat and madness.\\"Laing, Self p. 42-3 The distortion involved in not going against the nexus can force wrong thinking - leading to \\"not being in reality\\", which Laing saw as the essence of schizophrenia; and for Laing \\"one of the most important questions, therefore, is whether such mistrust of her 'feelings' and the testimony of others arises from persistent inconsistencies within an original nexus.\\"Laing, Self p. 105 The closed nexus and the double bind Laing and his colleagues suggested that a family nexus included both immediate family, and extra-familial people closely associated with the family and its world-view.R D Laing and A Esterson, ‘’Sanity, Madness and the Family’’ (Penguin 1990) p. 21 Laing argued that a closed nexus would use its energy so as to unconsciously block out any threats to its identity, keeping all interchanges at a boring, repetitive level.R D Laing, ‘’Self and Others’’ (Penguin 1971) p. 161 Building on Kleinian accounts of social phantasy systems, and the sense of unquestioned reality they can generate, Laing argued that within such systems patterns of communication were multi-layered and deceptive.R D Laing, ‘’Self and Others’’ (Penguin 1971) p. 38 and p. 161 He also used W. R. Bion's account of how a group's basic assumptions could radiate \\"long silences, sighs of boredom, movements of discomfort...the hostility of the individuals was being contributed to the group anonymously\\".W. R. Bion, Experiences in Groups (London 1980) p. 185 and p. 50 As his associate Joseph Berke put it, in such a nexus \\"a unique pattern of communication could be made out. People did not talk to each other, but at each other, and tangentially, not directly....what people said was often contradicted by the way they said it (tone of voice and/or facial and bodily movements).\\"Mary Barnes and Joseph Berke, Mary Barnes: Two Accounts of a Journey Through Madness (Penguin 1974) p. 91-2 Further light was shed on such interactions by Gregory Bateson's concept of the double bind - \\"a situation in which contradictory demands are being put upon a child (or patient) in such a way that there is no avenue of escape or challenge\\".Patrick Casement, Further Learning from the Patient (London 1990) p. 178n Laing considered that the concept allowed a completely new understanding of what a familial environment could entail:R D Laing, ‘’Self and Others’’ (Penguin 1971) p. 148 \\"this paradigm of an insoluble 'can't win' situation, specifically destructive of self-identity\\" greatly illuminated the way the subject's \\"disturbed pattern of communication...[was] a reflection of, and reaction to, the disturbed and disturbing pattern characterizing his or her family of origin.\\"R D Laing, The Politics of Experience (Penguin 1984) p. 94-5 In such a light, he considered that \\"mental illness\\" might be the outcome of a problematic configuration of a family nexus more than a necessary result of the nexus itself: in the words of Charles Rycroft, the psychotic is \\"the overt casualty of a deeply concealed family tragedy...the end-result of complex and skew[ed] interactions within his family.\\"Charles Rycroft, \\"Psychosis\\", in Richard Gregory ed, The Oxford Companion to the Mind (Oxford 1987) p. 658 As Laing was careful to point out, however, it was not \\"a matter of laying the blame at anyone's door. The untenable position, the 'can't win' double-bind, the situation of checkmate, is by definition not obvious to the protagonists...The man at the bottom of the heap may be being crushed and suffocated to death without anyone noticing, much less intending it\\".R D Laing, The Politics of Experience (Penguin 1984) p. 95 Collier's criticism Andrew Collier has commented on Laing's dilemma, which Laing himself seemed never to properly identify.Andrew Collier, R. D. Laing: the Philosophy and Politics of Psychotherapy (1977) In much of his writing Laing assumed an uncorrupted natural state for the human mind, and tended to condemn society for causing mental illness, in rather (early) Marxist terms. He saw schizophrenia as a possible healing process, a way of working through things, back to normality. Collier suggests that there is no uncorrupted state, no normality; rather that as social animals we all need to incorporate others into a nexus in order to \\"be\\". We must all perhaps be \\"mad\\" to some extent if we are to function in society, rather than as loners, but we must be uniformly mad. The nature of the madman's \\"must\\", however, remains unestablished. Therapy Psychotherapy today comes in many forms, following different schools of thought. Psychoanalysis emphasises childhood experience, and left-over feelings, though Freud did point to the role of society in his later works like Civilization and its Discontents. Family therapy concentrates on bringing families together and encouraging them to work out their interactions, but it might (depending on its theoretical orientation) offer little or no support to the victim of family nexus, who may then be punished for anything he dares to reveal or hint at, and (lacking a support network) submit to silent intimidation in family therapy, rather than risk exclusion and the \\"ceasing to be\\" that follows. The alert family therapist will however \\"avoid taking the family's side...Or the scapegoat's. You mustn't take anyone's side because then you'd be joining in the blaming...You've got to treat the family as a system, without blaming anyone...you need to make them all feel supported.\\"Robin Skynner/John Cleese, Families and how to survive them (London 1994) p. 106 See also References Category:Psychosis Category:Family Category:Anti-psychiatry ","title":"Family nexus"},{"id":"3922937","text":"The Beni-Amer, also known as Beni-Amir (sometimes simply as Amer or Nabtab), are a population inhabiting northeast Africa. They are considered by some to comprise a subgroup of the Beja people. They live in eastern Sudan and Eritrea. They are mostly Muslim and constitute the largest tribal confederation in Eritrea. Demographics and distribution Some 300,000 people in northeastern Africa belong to the Beni-Amer ethnic group. They live near the Red Sea around the borders of Eritrea and Sudan. The majority having settled permanently in Sudan or mixed into the larger pastoralist communities of Eritrea. The Beni-Amer people probably emerged in the fourteenth century AD from the intermixing of the Beja and the Tigre. The Beni-Amer occupy the borders between much of Eritrea's Barka valley, Port Sudan Tokar, and the Kassala areas of eastern Sudan.. The majority of the Beni-Amir currently speak Arabic, which is the primary language in Sudan, as well as Beja or Tigre, which belong to the Afro-Asiatic language family. History Distribution of the Beni-Amer people (approx) The Beni-Amer people became politically significant in the 16th-century when their founder Amer Kunu – the son of a Muslim holy man named Ali Nabit – joined forces with the Funj and the Ja'alin to defeat the Belew rulers of Eritrea and the surrounding region. Amer's descendants, or Beni-Amer in Arabic, became the new ruling class called Nabtabs who allied themselves with Diglal as the paramount chief ruler.SH Longrigg (2012), “Diglal”, in Encyclopaedia of Islam, Second Edition, Editors: P. Bearman et al, BRILL Academic, , Quote: \\"Diglal. The title of the hereditary ruler of the Banī ʿĀmir tribal group in the Agordat district of western Eritrea and in the eastern Sudan; he is also senior member of the aristocratic Nabtab class or caste.\\" A confederation of many subtribes accepted the new rule, and these therefrom have been the Beni-Amer people. The Beni Amer remained aligned to the Funj, and paid annual tribute to them until 1821. They became a party to the Italian colonialism when they partnered with the Italians to defeat the Sudanese Mahdiyya in the 1880s. During World War II, the Beni Amer ruling class supported the Italians. The defeat of Italy led to a regional power shake up and reduction in the military powers of the Beni Amer. Social stratification The Beni Amer people have a highly stratified social structure. The ruling caste, that consider themselves to be true descendants of Amer or Nabtab, have controlled the economic and political decisions. They constitute less than 10% of their total population. The others members of the Nabtab family belong to the Hedarab, Hadendowa, and Tigre. During the British occupation, author James C. Olson claimed the other descendants of the Nabtab line played a subservient role to the Beni Amir and were relegated to a serf caste. Major subdivisions of Tigre, which at 35%, are the second largest group in Eritrea were occupationally isolated, such as the Almada and Asfada could produce and supply milk, but Hamasein, Abhasheila and Wilinnoho were not allowed to. The Nabtabs also levied taxes and collected periodic tributes from his serfs. According to Paul, ever since Amer Kunu came to power, intermarriage between Nabtab and Tigre castes were forbidden and the caste distinctions were strictly enforced. This was successfully accomplished by the small elite, states Paul, through the \\"force of arms\\". Livelihood They lead a tribal pastoral life, with those in the northern territories raising camels, and the southerners raising cattle. In contemporary era, many have adopted a farming lifestyle and become migrant wage labor providers. References =Bibliography= *Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, ed. Count Gleichen (London, 1905); *A. H.

His new reforms, which included the establishment of a militia, limited rights for Muslims and attempts to limit the power of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church alarmed Alexander of Bulgaria, who feared the possibility of a liberal revolution.

Tsankov's second rule was seen as largely transitional and it also saw the Liberal Party splitting, with Petko Karavelov gaining a large groundswell of support. Eventually he was dismissed as Prime Minister and replaced by Karavelov in 1884.MacDermott, op cit, pp. 331-333 After his removal from office, Tsankov split off to form his own party, the Progressive Liberals.Crampton, op cit, p. 248 Although the group did not see government until 1902 and the rule of Stoyan Danev, Tsankov remained an important figure in Bulgarian politics and a constant voice in support of ever closer relations with Russia until his death.

Dacian Buri / Burridensi on the Roman Empire Map Name According to Wilhelm Tomaschek, the root bur- is well known with the Dacian Thracian names: i.e. Burus (Thrax), Bουρχέντιος (that is to say Bhūri–Kanta, a Bessian from Thrace), Burebista (the king of Dacians that is maybe related to Sanskrit bhūri \\"abundant, rich\\" and Iranian vista \\"possessor\\" ).  Historical evidence  The Dacian tribe Buredeense / Buri is attested by the ninth tabula of Europe of Ptolemy's Geography, Cassius Dio and inscriptions. Before the battle of Tapae (101) (in the first campaign of Trajan) the Dacian tribe, the Buri, sent Trajan a message to the effect that he should withdraw from Dacia and restore peaceful relations. Their message to him was inscribed on the smooth top of a very large mushroom, in Latin. This message was unusual enough to become part of a frieze on Trajan's Column. In the 6th century a deed issued by Justinian, dated 530 AD, mentions the Burs: \\"Insuper constituimus, tibique damus hic descripta armorum insignia: videlicet: scutum in septem partes divisum; in medio eius, scutum aureum, cui inest aquila dupplex, alba et nigra, quae significat Emblema Imperiale, cuius capita coronata sunt purpureo Imperiali diademate, ex parte dextra in prima divisione scutum rubrum, in cuius medio videtur turris, significans utramque Daciam, in secunda divisione scutum coeleste, cum tribus Burris, quarum duae e lateribus albae sunt, media vero aurea, quae indicat Albaniam superiorem; in tertia sectione scutum album cum uno Leone, indicante Epyrum; ex parte vero sinistra in sectione scutum coelestis coloris cum dupplici cruce aurea, exprimente secundam Pannoniam; in secunda divisione scutum rubrum, in cuius medio est caper nigri coloris, significans Macedoniam: et in tertia sectione scutum viridis coloris, et in eo duo brachia vestita, stemma aureum septem margaritis gemmatum tenentia, quae indicant Thessaliam: duo quoque emicant astra aurea, unum in media superioris scuti parte, et alterum in inferiori, quae complementum symbolicum ceterarum terrarum, et provinciarum terminant. Super dictis emblematibus apparet crux erecta triformis, significans dignitatem summi sacerdotii, corona Ducali tecta; in dextra eius parte gladius aureus absolutam in temporali authoritatem indicans: e sinistra vero pedum Pastorale, dictans authoritatem in spirituali, quae omnia cooperiuntur Pileo rubro, longo funicolo cum longis nodis et aureis fimbriis circumplexo, quo caput tuum adornabis comparens in omnibus publicis functionibus.\\"  Identity and distribution  Dacian Buri on the map of Roman operations AD 180-182. According to Shchukin (1989), Bichir (1976) the tribal union of Buri were part of the Dacian state of Burebista, besides the Daci, the Getae, and the Carpi. They allied with other tribes in the region to support the efforts by Decebal, the Dacian king, to turn back the Romans. There were two Dacian tribes Buri: one in the later Roman Dacia centered on Buridava and other located to the North West of Dacia (South of Slovakian Carpathians) in the Upper Basin of Tisza. (Note: the Germanic Buri were between the Oder and the Vistula, between Cracow and Troppau, in Silesia. They were allies of Trajan, Roman Emperor, in his war against the Dacians, and also of Marcus Aurelius in the Marcomannic Wars.) The socio-political formation of the Dacians Buri / Buridavensi that was centered on Buridava was located to the North East of Oltenia and Muntenia (modern Vâlcea and Argeş counties) and also on the other side of the Carpathians, in the regions of Sebeş and Făgăraş mountains. This tribal union is documented by the archaeological monetary findings Aninoasa Dobresti. Among other evidences, a fragment of a vase carrying the inscription BUR, discovered at Ocnița, Muntenia, Romania, indicates the name of the tribe or union of tribes, the Buridavensi Dacians. The Buri of the Upper Basin of Tisza is a part of the Buridavensi that migrated towards North West, where they neighbored the Germanic Quadi. At the new location, ancient sources also list other Dacian tribes: Piegetae, Biessi, Carpians, Arsitae, and Racatae. The material culture of a mixed Dacian-Germanic origin, known in Slovakia ever since the beginning of the first century AD (at Zemplin, for instance), could represent the population named Buri in historical sources.

Most of these broadsides took the form of petitions to various rulers and governmental bodies: kings, the Lords and Commons, lord mayors of London, the City of London's board of aldermen and the clergy of the time.

Some of her broadsides petitioned on issues of the printing trade, such as government control of printing and taxation on paper.

They are a part of the Sudanese Arabs and are also one of the three premier tribes of arabised Nubians indigenous to North Sudan, along with the Ja'alin and Danagla. The tribe inhabits the region of Dar al- Shayqiya, which stretches along the banks of the Nile River from Jabal al- Dajer to the end of Muscat's fourth waterfall and includes their tribal capital of Korti and parts of the Bayuda desert. Although speaking Sudanese Arabic today, the Shaigiya, like the Ja'alin, are known to have spoken some form of Nubian as late as the 19th century. This language, labelled as Old Shaiqi, was apparently closely related if not identical to the Nobiin dialect. Shaiqi tribesmen are among those along the Nile who have been affected by the Merowe Dam.Tide of censure for African dams  Origin and Lineage  The Shaigiya are a sub-group of Al-Dahamishiy, a branch of the larger Ja'alin tribe. They are divided into different clans each belonging to the twelve sons of Shaig (the founder).https://abeerabutalib.com/tribal-culture-in-sudan- alshayky-1 They are predominantly Sunni Muslims with small sects of Shia believers. They trace their origin to a Hejazi Arab named Shaig who came from the Arabian Peninsula in the 7th century following the Arabian conquest of Egypt.https://archive.org/stream/shaikiyaaccounto00nich/shaikiyaaccounto00nich_djvu.txt Shaig was a descendant of Abbas (an uncle of prophet Muhammad). He and his family settled in Sudan and intermixed with the local Nubians, creating this tribe. History A Shaigiya man at the time of the Egyptian invasion. The Shaigiya are first mentioned in 1529, when an Italian visitor to Upper Egypt remarked that pyramids could be found in their country. They were subjects of the Funj Sultanate, which extended as far north as Dongola. From the sixteenth century until colonization, the Shaigiya had many prominent Islamic schools which attracted students from all over Sudan. Around 1690 the tribe broke loose from the Kingdom of Funj, defeating the Abdelab governor, and were the only independent tribe in the region. The first account of the Shaigiya tribesmen was given by the Scottish traveller James Bruce in his book Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile (1790) who noticed the tribe migrated from more southern regions to its present homeland around 1772. Still the best early description came from an adventurer and historian John Lewis Burckhardt, who, mesmerized by the Shaigiya, spent some time with the tribe. His accounts of the events were published at 1819 in the \\"Travels in Nubia\\". The predatory character of the tribe speaks of change from Bruce's time, \\"My guide, in constant dread of the Shaiqiya would not allow me to light a fire although the nights were getting very cold\\".W. Burckhardt, Travels in Nubia, 1819 Evidently, the tribe was ruled by two Macs (the title given by the kings of Funj to tribal chiefs), Mac Jaweesh and Mac Zubeir. Military training of the Shaiqiya youth was brutal, and at very early age they were capable of launching spears from a horseback by astonishing precision. Their unexplainable intolerance of other tribes led to raids against their neighbours and beyond. They attacked villages and caravans as far as Wadi Halfa in the north, and Shendi in the south forcing some families of the neighbouring tribes to emigrate westwards (Danagla). Constantly attacking the town of Shendi and killing some of local Mac Nimr's uncles forced the Ja'Alin to seek help from the king of Funj, who at his political decline was too weakened and unable to help. Burckhardt who spent time in Merowe around 1807 gives us more description of the tribe They were challenged around 1811 at Dongola by the Mamelukes, but continued to dominate a considerable part of Nubia. They resisted the Turkish/Egyptian invasion in 1820, at the battle of Korti after refusing to submit and were defeated due to the use of fire-arms and cannons and retreated southwards. Mac Jaweesh along the majority of his men sought asylum in Shendi in hope to persuade the Ja'Ali chief Mac Nimr to join forces against the much stronger enemy. Mac Nimr declined the offer and the Shaiqiya were handed over to the Turks, who promised to pardon the Shaiqiya warriors and return their land if they accepted the service in Turkish ranks. After the deal was struck Shaiqiya were used during the suppression of the Ja'Alin revolt (1822) and demonstrated astonishing brutality. For their services they obtained lands of the Ja'Alin between Shendi and Khartoum (). Shaigiya fighters in 19th century In the Mahdist War of 1884/85, General Gordon's first fight was to rescue a few Shaiqiya, still serving with the invader and besieged in a fort at Al Halfaya, just north of Khartoum. The fortress at Al-Ubayyid in 1883, was held by Major Ahmed Hussein Pasha (Suarab Section) and despite Hicks Pasha's attempt to relieve him, the fortress fell to the Mahdi. (Major Hussein escaped to Egypt in 1891 and came back during the reconquest in 1898. His family still resides in Omdurman, Khartoum North and Hajar al Asal.) His grand children went far as Germany and America where they go by the name of Hussein. In April 1884, Saleh Bey (Saleh Wad el Mek), head of the tribe, and 1,400 men surrendered to the Mahdi's forces. Numbers of Shaigiya continued in the service of General Gordon and this led to the proscription of the tribe by the Mahdi. When Khartoum fell, Saleh's sons were sought out and executed by the Dervishes. On the reconquest of the Sudan by the Anglo-Egyptian army (1896/98) it was found that the Shaigiya were reduced to a few hundred families. After this the tribe thrived. They figured prominently in the Egyptian Army and later the Sudan Defence Force. General Ibrahim Abboud, decorated with the MBE for his valour at Keren in 1941, was a Shaiqi from the Onia section and later President of the Sudan in 1964. Culture Dongola horse They are known for their bravery, generosity, and enlightenment. \\"They are the one to hunt the Lion.\\" Freedom- loving and hospitable, they had schools in which all Muslim science was taught, and were rich in corn and cattle. Their fighting men, mounted on horses of the famous Dongola breed, were feared throughout the eastern Sudan. Their chiefs wore coats of mail and carried shields of hippopotamus or crocodile skin. Their arms were lance, sword or javelin. The Shaigiya are divided into twelve sections or sub tribes, each descended from one of the twelve sons of the founder, Shaig. Many jokes involve a Shaigi quarrelling with a Ja'li. Many times the Shaigi is the sharp, and Ja'li is the stubborn. They have adopted the tribal marking custom of cutting three horizontal lines on the cheeks of their children. This was done with a heated knife, but is now a dying custom. =Communication= Members of the Shaigiya tribe speak and write in Arabic. Some sections living towards the Red Sea area have a language that is akin to what the Hadendowa speak. They have an accent which bites off of the last letter of some words. A common name for a male is Al-sir, which is from the Turkish language and means leader. A common name for a female that hardly anyone uses outside of the tribe is Had-Alraid, which means the most amount of love you can give to someone or something. =Art forms= Historical photograph of Shaigiya woman in Sudan, by Richard Buchta, around 1878 There is a special instrument that can be heard in Shaigi tribal music: the tambour, or Tanbūra, a kind of lyre. The Shaigiya tribe used to make their homes from bricks made of mud and cow dung as other North African and Arab tribes had done. The roofs were made of straw to keep the houses cool. The most common time for men to put art on their bodies is the wearing of henna on their hands for a wedding. Women put henna on for their own marriage only. =Institutions= Family In the rural areas of the various sub-tribes (or Dars), extended family life features strongly. It is quite common that multiple generations will stay in one house (mother, father, grandfather, grandmother, children, aunts, uncles, cousins). Most households in the Shaigiya tribe consist of extended families. Some men have more than one wife. The head of the house is the father. If the father is not in the home then the mother is the head. If the mother is incapable, then the uncle takes over. The uncle is usually the father’s brother and must act as the father. If the uncle cannot fulfil the role, then the grandfather will take over. Religion The main religion of the Shaigiya tribe is Sunni Islam with small sects of Shia practitioners. Schooling Most children attend government school. Women are usually the teachers while the men are farming and planting. All lessons are important, but most emphasized are religion, languages, and math. Religion is considered important because children attend religious schools called a Khalwa. A Khalwa is a place where kids go to before they enter a school to learn and memorize the Quran. As everybody knows, they would have to speak a language so somebody understands them, but they also learn different languages to help them later on in life. Math might be very important because if they are selling something, then they will have to do the math so they don’t get mixed up with the money and lose it. =Social behavior= Children in the Shaigiya tribe like to play a kind of game called \\"Seega,\\" which is similar to tic-tac-toe. First they draw a big square with 9 small squares inside on the sand, two children play, each has five stones, each stone of a different color. Each tries to align their own stones in a line of 3, while the other blocks and tries to prevent his/her adversary from making a straight line. The Shaygiya greeting is similar to most other tribal Sudanese greetings or Muslim greetings. When the Shaigiya people meet someone who is older, they say, ”As-salamu alaykum ya haj” or “Marhaban ya haj”, pat their hands on the left shoulder and then shake hands. If they meet their friend, they would say ”Marhaban\\" or “Ezayakum”. Ladies hug each other and shake hands. When there is a wedding, the groom applies henna, a kind of black decoration that people usually put on their hands and feet. Henna is applied as a paste made of dried and powdered Lawsonia leaves, with added oil and water. Brides use it in a decorative manner, usually with floral decorations. If applied once, it takes on a reddish hue, twice will turn it black. Eating habits are typical almost throughout Sudan, breakfast is around 10am, lunch is at 3pm and dinner at 7pm. The main course will always be a kind of bread called “Gurrasa,\\" which is made of flour. It is usually dipped into meat curries. They have black tea with milk and sugar after every meal. When someone dies, funeral rites for the dead are carried out immediately. The families of the dead wear black or white, and the men take the corpse, wash it and cover it with large white sheet and bury it. Widows usually mourn for a stipulated four-month and ten day period. When a baby is born, the baby’s mother and the town's women ululate (zaghareed) to announce the baby's arrival, and after 7 days, the family hosts a party to give the newborn baby a name. =Social structure= Most mornings, men work in the fields tending their crops. Hunting is also popular. Wives take care of children and give food to their husbands when they are working in the field. Boys in the Shaigiya tribe help in the field after school. Girls stay at home to help their mothers and make themselves more beautiful (decorate themselves with fancy clothes and other decorations). They are not allowed to go out very much until they are 15 years old. The leader of a family always is the father, but when troubles come to the leader, the mother or the uncle of this family will lead instead. Notes References * The discovery of the source of Nile, J.

Education Born in Bethlehem, PA, a great-grandson of Count Nikolaus Ludwig von Zinzendorf und Pottendorf, founder and patron of the Moravian Church, in 1787 Schweinitz was placed in the institution of the Moravian community at Nazareth, Pennsylvania, where he remained for 11 years and was a successful and industrious student.Kellerman, W.A. (1886). Sketch of Schweinitz. Journal of Mycology 2(3):31-34. Schweinitz later entered the Theological seminary at Niesky (Saxony) in 1798. In 1805, he published the Conspectus Fungorum in Lusatiae in collaboration with his teacher, Professor J.B. Albertini. Early career In 1807 he went to Gnadenberg (in Silesia), then subsequently to Gnadau to work as a preacher in the Moravian church. A work appointment in the United States led him on a route through Denmark and Sweden, to avoid Napoleon's operations. This path allowed him to meet with some of the academics at the University of Kiel in Holstein, where he was bestowed with an honorary Ph.D. \\"in absentia, for his work as an administrator, his cultivation of natural science, and the Conspectus\\".Rogers, D.P. (1977). L. D. de Schweinitz and Early American Mycology. Mycologia 69(2): 223-45. Return to the United States After returning to the United States in 1812, he settled in Salem, North Carolina (now called Old Salem), North Carolina, working as an administrator of church estates. (He lived in what had been built as the Dr. Samuel Benjamin Vierling House which is now an exhibit building open for public tours.) The results of his mycological research in this location would later be published as Synopsis Fungorum Carolinæ Superioris in 1822. This work was edited by Christian Friedrich Schwaegrichen who, by a printer's error, was misnamed on the title page. The identity of the editor has been a source of confusion ever since. Schweinitz was elected to membership in the American Philosophical Society in 1817.Arthur, J.C., Bisby, G.R. (1918). An annotated translation of the part of Schweinitz's two papers giving the rusts of North America. Proc. Amer. Phil. Soc. 57(3):173-292. The Synopsis was published without Schweinitz's knowledge: in 1818, he had simply given a list of North Carolina fungi to a friend in Leipzig. When he unexpectedly received prints of the published work four years later, he was \\"surprised but pleased\\".Weber, Nancy Smith and Alexander H. Smith (1985). A Field Guide to Southern Mushrooms. University of Michigan Press. . p. 15. The Synopsis listed 1,373 species of fungi, and named and described 320 novel species. These new discoveries included such now widely known species as Lactarius indigo, Cantharellus cinnabarinus, and Hypomyces lactifluorum.Weber & Smith 1985. p.16. Honors and later career He was a member of various learned societies in the United States, Germany, and France. A new genus of plant was named Schweinitzia (now referred to as Monotropsis) in his honor, and the polypore Phaeolus schweinitzii is named in his honor. While a resident of Salem he was elected president of the University of North Carolina, which honor he declined because it involved relinquishing work in the Moravian church. In 1821 he returned to his native village in Pennsylvania and continued his studies until his death.Morgan, A.P. (1884). Some North American botanists. IX. Lewis David de Schweinitz. Botanical Gazette 9(2):17-19. He described Dibotryon morbosum (Schwein.) Theiss. & Syd., 1915, as well as Cantherellus (now Gomphus) floccosus in 1832. His herbarium, which comprised at the time of his death the largest private collection of plants in the United States, he bequeathed to the Academy of Natural Sciences at Philadelphia. His birthplace, the Gemeinhaus-Lewis David de Schweinitz Residence, is a National Historic Landmark in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania. Selected publications *Albertini, J. B. de, Schweinitz, L.D. de.

Another interested party was University of Massachusetts Boston, operator of the WUMB network of radio stations. WAVM entered into an agreement with WUMB to jointly own the frequency and their partnership had appealed the FCC's decision.

Taking place over one weekend in December, this is a 40-hour event, meaning that there are students working every hour of the night and day. There are normally six- seven telethon hosts, who stay up for the full forty hours. Tech crew: The tech crew in the Beacon Santa Telethon are hand selected by captains and the administration in WAVM. The tech crew is a group of highly trained individuals who coordinate the technical setup of the telethon, often getting more in-depth and intricate with the inner workings in the studio and auditorium. The group consists of 20-30 members varying on the year and is led by Trained Captains and a Head Tech.http://wavm.org/annual-beacon-santa-telethon/ Hosts: The hosts are the on-air talent during the Telethon. Several students apply to be hosts but only a select few will get the position. The selection is based on involvement in WAVM and their ability to be professional during the Telethon. The Hosts do a majority of their work before the telethon. This work includes gathering monetary donations from businesses in the area, collecting auction items, and scheduling acts to help fill the air-time.http://wavm.org/annual-beacon-santa- telethon/ This telethon earns money for the poor and needy in many ways. Each staff member must raise at least 100 dollars in donations and pledges in order to stay overnight. Every donation of 25 dollars or more goes up on the Donor Board. An auction takes place up until one hour before the end of the telethon, with hundreds of items being bid on. Along with auctions, local bands and other talents perform. Popular acts that tend to reappear The Maynard Community Band, Christmas Carol singing, and Mrs. Clause reading a story to children, Mr.Vic singing to children, Hosts vs Tech Crew, various food challenges. The Grand Finale takes place at noon on Sunday, where the hosts thank the sponsors, donors, and parent volunteers, and reveal the grand total, which they are always striving to get higher than the previous year. The Telethon raises anywhere between $28,000 and $40,000 depending on the economy for needy families of surrounding communities so that they can have a proper Christmas. Television WAVM airs original student content once to three times a week. Broadcasts often air for one hour during 6-9p.m. ET. Student Television includes Manly Cooking and Dining Divas. Manly cooking is normally hosted by 4 male talent where they either do crazy food challenges such as Ghost Pepper Pasta, and Mystery Burgers. Dining Divas is a cooking show involving four on-air female talent, where they make food such as grilled cheese, French toast, eggs, and more edible creations then Manly Cooking. Previously aired Television shows in WAVM include The Elusive Moose and Arcade. These shows have been discontinued by the students and have no further plans of being revitalized. The programs air on Channel 8 Comcast, and Channel 28 Verizon.http://wavm.org/cable-tv-828/ Radio WAVM broadcasts stereo radio from 2-9p.m. ET on 91.7 FM for five days a week during the Maynard High School, school year. The radio shows are run by students for an hour once a week. The students choose music and topics and have fun on the air. Radio shows are offered to students in the 6th-12th grades in the Maynard school systems. In addition, WAVM also offers live radio recordings of church services.http://wavm.org/church-services/ Fundraising WAVM offers a wide range of fundraising for the students in the club. Fundraising opportunities include The Mother son Luao, The Father-Daughter Dance, and selling raffle tickets. Each event is widely popular in Maynard and garners a significant amount of revenue that awards several seniors hundreds of dollars in scholarships, the scholarships are for dedicated seniors in the program. Fundraising money also goes to the general upkeep of the station and additional technical equipment.

A reviewer for Next Generation gave it one out of five stars, saying that the controls are unacceptably poor and the use of separate sprites for each of the characters' segments results in \\"gangly\\" and awkward animations. The four reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly complimented the cinematic intro but otherwise panned the game, saying that the controls were poor, the graphics were outdated, and the developers had divided their attentions between several different gameplay styles without doing a good job with any of them.

Their numbers were estimated to be 48,300 in 1993, of which 28,300 were in Côte d’Ivoire. They are a subgroup of the Grebo and speak the Krumen language. They are also called Kru, and are related to (but distinct from) the Kru people of the Liberian interior. Word Origin There has been much scholarly debate on the origin of the term, since there is little evidence of use of the term outside of the maritime environment in which the Krumen served as sailors, and the fact that many Grebo served in this capacity. Hence the belief that its root was from \\"crewmen\\" in English (a pidgin form of which was a lingua franca among them, thanks to their service as on European vessels). One theory, advanced in the 1911 Encyclopædia Britannica was that it derived from Kraoh, which is the name of one subgroup in their home area. History =Origins= The coast of eastern Liberia and western Ivory Coast were rarely visited by European vessels until the nineteenth century, and for that reason there are very few written texts that can illuminate its early history or the origin of the Krumen communities there. There has also been very little archaeological work that might illuminate events or societies of the more distant past. For that reason, oral tradition remains the most important key to the origin of the Krumen. Traditions recorded in the mid nineteenth century by James Connelly relate that the Kru communities that lived along the shore of what is today southern Liberia and the reputed core settlement of the Krumen came down to the coast from the interior \\"some three generations back-- say one hundred to one hundred fifty years...\\" from an original place he called Claho. Coming down the Poor River they \\"learned the value of salt\\" and founded the town of Bassa, the subsequently moved again to Little Kroo, and then were subsequently joined by whole communities from the interior.James Connelly,\\"Report of the Kroo People\\" Annual Report of the American Colonization Society 39 (1856) p. 38. These events likely occurred in the 1770s and are believed to be connected to more intensive European interest in trade in the region at about this time.George Brooks, The Kru Mariner in the Nineteenth Century: An Historical Compendium, (Newark, DE: LIberian Studies Association of America, 1972), pp. 76-77. The original settlers from the interior eventually established five towns, Little Kroo, Setra Kroo, Kroo-Bar, Nana Kroo and King Will's Town, that came to be regarded as their home district, though soon other offshoots developed along the coast, and particularly in Freetown, Sierra Leone.Ludlam, \\"An Account of a Tribe of People called Croomen...\\" in Report of the Directors of the African Institution 6 (1812) p. 44.Connelly, \\"Report\\", p. 38. =Seafaring= From the late eighteenth century onward, Krumen began working on European ships. By the 1790s the inhabitants of their original region were being hired as free sailors on European ships engaged in the slave trade.The earliest reference is Thomas Winterbottom, An Account of the Native Peoples in the Vicinity of Sierra Leone (London, 1803), p. 8. As the so-called \\"legitimate trade\\" replaced the slave trade in the nineteenth century and as trade along the West Africa coast increased, many Krumen signed on to the new vessels as seamen. In the process there developed Krumen communities around all the major trading factories of the coast, from Sierra Leone around to the mouth of the Congo River.Brooks, Kru Mariner. pp. 44-59. A number of Kroomen (between 20 and 30) are buried in the Seaforth Old Burial Ground in Simon's Town, South Africa, where their graves can still be seen, and Kroomen is the name used to describe them on their gravestones. They were active in the Royal Navy from 1820 to as late as 1924, e.g. landed a camp party with 12 Krumen in Elephant Bay in June of that year. Many Kroomen joined the dockyard staff, others remained on board RN ships as seamen. They were given Western names by the men on the ships, leading to names that are amusing to the Western eye, Tom Ropeman and Will Cockroach amongst them. They were clearly commonly employed, and the names bestowed were not original, since the cemetery contains for example the remains of Tom Smith Number 1, to distinguish him from another Tom Smith. Although the earliest Krumen mariners may have come from the five core towns, people from many other places and ethnicities joined the original Krumen, creating a mixed but strongly held identity, not only in their home district, but in the many trading posts and towns where they came to settle, and then people from those places also became effectively Krumen by taking on their identity and behavioral characteristics. Some scholars maintain that in fact the term Krumen and indeed even Kru originated in the maritime branch of the culture alone, being transported back to the homelands from the dispersed communities,Frederick McEvoy, \\"Understanding Ethnic Realities among the Grebo and Kru Peoples of Western Africa,\\" Africa: Journal of the International African Institute 47/1 (1977): 62-80. but others contend that the process of identity formation was more complex involving both maritime and shore communities.L. B. Breitborde, \\"City, Countryside and Kru Ethnicity,\\" Africa: Journal of the International African Institute 61/2 (1991): 186-201. Krumen sailors were organized as small companies under a headman. They would paddle in small canoes as far as a dozen miles out to see to meet ships as they arrived and negotiated their employment on the spot. Headmen often carried credentials from previous stints of employment in boxes or other containers, and negotiations were conducted rapidly. During the earlier part of the nineteenth century foreign observers often gave the Kru high praise for their honesty, courage, efficiency and willingness to do hard work. Later observers, however, had more disparaging comments to make, though either way, few ships plied African waters without many Kru sailors on board.Brooks, Kru Mariner, pp. 1-59. Although initially Krumen were interested only in sailor's work, in time some took up land based employment doing all sorts of work in the many trading factories that grew up all along the African coast from Sierra Leone to the mouth of the Congo River. They were also recruited as soldiers and common laborers, some traveling as far as India and the Malayan peninsula to the east. Krumen workers served French employers in the French attempt to dig the Panama Canal, others were employed in Jamaica.Christine Behrens,Le Croumen de la côte occidental de l'Afrique (Talence: Ministère de la Education Nationale, 1974) pp.65-82. =Culture= In the late nineteenth century reports described the Krumen are divided into small commonwealths, each with a hereditary chief whose duty is simply to represent the people in their dealings with strangers. The real government is vested in the elders, who wear as insignia iron rings on their legs. Their president, who holds religious authority as well, guards the national symbols, and his house is sanctuary for offenders until their guilt is proved. Personal property is held in common by each family. Land also is communal, but the rights of the actual cultivator cease when he fails to farm it. =Religion= The first descriptions of core group of Krumen's religion were done by missionaries notably James Connolley,Connolley, \\"Report\\" p. 39 But these accounts can also be augmented by more detailed accounts of the Grebo of nearby Cape Palmas who were linguistically and culturally related and were, by 1855 becoming Krumen themselves by going to sea and may have been as important in the overall culture as the core Krumen themselves. The central elements of the spiritual universe of this region included a figure identified by missionaries as a high, creator God, named Nyesoa, spirits or deities associated with territories called, familial spiritual guardians called ku and finally kwi or the souls of the departed who remained near by and could influence events. These spiritual entities were contacted through a class of people called deya, who underwent long and specialized training and apprenticeship to take up their office. They addressed problems both medical and spiritual using pharmaceutical and spiritual remedies.Anna M. Scott, Glimpses of Life in Africa (New York: American Tract Society, n. d. [1857]). This short pamphlet, clearly clouded by a Christian and missionary perspective nevertheless lays out quite clearly the cosmology of mid nineteenth century Grebo.J. Payne \\"Rr Rev Bishop Payne's Report on the Grebo Tribe, of Cape Palmas,\\"Annual Report of the American Colonization Society 39 (1856) pp. 36-37. The Kru languages Wilhelm Bleek classified the Kru language with the Mandingo family, and in this he was followed by R. G. Latham; S. W. Koelle, who published a Kru grammar (1854), disagreed.

She, out of the many labouring-class writers of the period, was noticeably well received. Biography Partly self-educated, she probably received a rudimentary education at either a local dame school, or at the local free school in Brackley on the south side of the Chapel. According to her father she began writing \\"tolerably\\" at the age of 10. Her father recollected, \\"She would often be scribbling, and sometimes in Rhyme,\\" but that her mother ended up discouraging the writing, requesting she find some \\"more profitable employment\\". She was fortunate enough to attain a position as kitchen maid with Susanna Jennens (\\"Parthenissa\\" in Leapor's poetry), who apparently encouraged her writing and allowed her the use of her library. Jennens wrote poetry herself and had connections to both Mary Astell and Mary Wortley Montagu. Not all employers were so accommodating and Leapor's devotion to writing led to her dismissal from a subsequent position with Sir Richard Chauncy's family, as she apparently would not stop writing even in the kitchen. In 1784 an account was published in The Gentleman's Magazine, possibly by Chauncy's son, allegedly describing Chauncy's remembrances of the poet. According to this piece, Leapor's \\"fondness for writing verses there displayed itself by her sometimes taking up her pen while the jack was standing still, and the meat scorching … He represented her as having been extremely swarthy, and quite emaciated, with a long crane-neck, and a short body, much resembling, in shape, a bass-viol.\\"Stephen Van-Hagen, \\"Mary Leapor,\\" The Literary Encyclopedia (3 March 2007). She returned home to Brackley to care for her widowed father in 1744 or 1745, and despite many responsibilities, and not being in the best of health herself, she continued to write, so that her work circulated among the inhabitants of the town. As a consequence she met Bridget Freemantle (1698–1779), the daughter of a former rector, who became both her friend and mentor. This relationship seems to have marked a turning point for Leapor and she wrote the bulk of her œuvre in a very short period. It was Freemantle who suggested that Leapor publish a volume of poetry by subscription, and she also attempted to have a play of hers, a blank-verse tragedy called The Unhappy Father, produced in London at the Covent Garden Theatre. (A second play remained unfinished.) Neither venture was immediately successful. Leapor died of measles at Brackley on 12 November 1746 at the age of 24. The Bishop's Transcripts of the Parish Records show that she was buried \\"in woollen\\" two days later in Brackley. It is not known whether she was buried at the parish church of St Peter with St James, or at the now-demolished St James's Church, which stood in Goose Green close to where Mary is believed to have lived. Some of the proceeds from the publication of Volume One of her Poems Upon Several Occasions were used to pay for a headstone, but this has now been lost. According to Mary's contemporary, Henry PurefoyNote 3 to letter #412, p. 278, Vol. II, The Purefoy Letters 1735–1753 , ed. G. Eland, Sidgwick & Jackson, 1931. the headstone read, \\"In Memory of Mary Leapor daughter of Phillip and Ann Leapor: who departed this life Nov. ye 26. 1746 Aged 24\\". The date of death given on the headstone is believed to be incorrect, as the Bishop's Transcript is the definitive record of the date of her burial. Bridget Freemantle continued her quest to publish Leapor's work. In 1748 she arranged for the posthumous publication of Poems upon Several Occasions with some 600 subscribers, for the benefit of Philip Leapor. A second volume of poetry and drama was published three years later by Samuel Richardson and edited by Isaac Hawkins Browne. Mary Delany, Stephen Duck, Elizabeth Montagu, and Sarah Scott were among the subscribers. These volumes secured Leapor's reputation as \\"one of the most interesting of the natural poets.\\"Janet Todd, ed. \\"Leapor, Mary (Molly).\\" British Women Writers: a critical reference guide. London: Routledge, 1989, p. 402. John Duncombe praised her in The Feminead (1754), and Bonnell Thornton and George Colman included her in their Poems by Eminent Ladies (1755). Leapor herself seems not to have welcomed her status as a \\"natural\\" poet \\"untainted\\" by artifice. She worked hard to acquire a literary education as best she could and embraced the neoclassical ideals of her period. At the time of her death she had accumulated 17 volumes and several volumes of plays: a considerable library for someone with a limited income. There are many grammatical errors in Leapor's work, for which Freemantle apologises in the Preface to the \\"Poems Upon Several Occasions\\", assuring readers that had Leapor lived to edit them, the poems would have been flawless. She adds that they are, nevertheless, entertaining. Commemorations The Mary Leapor window in Brackley Town Hall The Mary Leapor Memorial in the Lady Chapel of St Peter's Church Brackley After the \\"centuries of neglect\\" recognised by Prof. John Clarke (\\"Yesterday's Brackley\\", Barracuda Books, 1990) in a chapter about Mary, a window, inspired by her work and based on a design by a local resident Carolyn Hunter, was created by stained-glass artist Rachael Aldridge and installed on the first floor of the newly refurbished Town Hall in Brackley in 2018. In 2019 Carolyn commissioned the stone carver, Bernard Johnson ( http://www.bernardjohnson.co.uk ), to create a permanent memorial to Mary in Welsh (Aberllefenni) slate, which is now placed in the Lady Chapel of St Peter's Church. The text of the memorial includes a Latin aphorism ‘(Poeta Nascitur Non Fit, i. e. \\"A Poet is born not made\\") and a quotation from Mary's poem, \\"Mira's Will\\" , in which she foresaw her early death (\\"My departed Shade I trust to Heaven\\"). The stylised leaves represent laurel, which in the same poem Mary called \\"the true emblem of my rhyme\\". Work Like many writers of the period, Leapor used a pastoral-sounding pen name, \\"Mira\\". Much of her work is modelled on that of Alexander Pope, whose work she admired. Also a model was Jonathan Swift, particularly his anti-blason poetry (the de-emphasis on the female physical body in relation to nature). At times Leapor's writing reflects her own pessimistic views on life as a woman who was described as being witty, poor, infirm and unattractive. She writes \\"much of and to women, of the discrepancy of her sex and class with her poetic urge.\\"Virginia Blain, et al., eds, \\"Leapor, Mary,\\" The Feminist Companion to Literature in English (New Haven and London: Yale UP, 1990. p. 640). Her work focuses on debunking romantic myths and reiterating the importance of education for women, which she understood all too well. From Leapor's \\"strongly feminist\\" \\"An Essay on Woman,\\": > WOMAN – a pleasing but a short-lived flower, > Too soft for business and too weak for power: > A wife in bondage, or neglected maid; > Despised if ugly; if she's fair – betrayed. > In \\"An Essay on Woman,\\" Leapor describes the certain downfall women face when they get old. She is highly critical of women being judged solely on their appearance, and deplores the limited choices open to them. Like Alexander Pope, Leapor saw \\"the general condition of women as a series of contradictions\\";Richard Greene, Mary Leapor: A Study in Eighteenth-Century Women's Poetry (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993). though unlike Pope or Jonathan Swift, they weren't \\"follies to be satirized\\", but rather \\"injustices to be protested against\\". Both poets deeply influenced Leapor's work, although she counters their interpretations and understanding of women's general unhappiness. Drawing from her personal experience as a woman, she saw injustice in the social order rather than in women themselves. This is reflected in the representation of her views on beauty, the female body, marriage, family and female friendship in her work. Leapor lived in a culture where women were expected to value themselves by their beauty. A great deal of money would have been needed to achieve perfection in beauty, which required creating an artificial appearance: \\"hardware\\" was fastened about the bodies of women to straighten posture, stays squeezed their waists, and faces were \\"caked and heavily coloured\\" with cosmetics. Leapor \\"attempts to see beyond artificial appearance to what she believes is more authentic femininity\\". Her poem \\"Dorinda at her Glass\\" exemplifies this as she describes a woman who has valued herself by the image she sees in the mirror, only to be devastated when she loses her youthful beauty with age: > To her lov'd Glass repair'd the weeping Maid, > alt=And with a Sigh address'd the alter'd Shade. > Say, what art thou, that wear'st a gloomy Form, > With low'ring Forehead, like a norther Storm; > Cheeks pale and hollow, as the Face of Woe, > And Lips that with no gay Vermilion glow? Through the poem Leapor advises and warns women that beauty does not last and to improve themselves intrinsically. \\"In 'Dorinda at her Glass', 'Advice to Sophronia', and other poems, Leapor asserts that women should preserve their dignity by accepting the loss of beauty\\". Leapor herself is affected by standards of beauty, and wishes to escape her \\"plainness\\" and the vulgar comments on her appearance, and dreams of being beautiful. This wistfulness for mainstream acceptance and admiration is illustrated in her poems \\"The Visit\\" and \\"The Disappointment.\\" Leapor's most extensive examination of standards of beauty in parts of fashionable society is \\"Corydon. Phillario. Or, Mira's Picture\\". This \\"self-portrait\\" attempts to break in some contemporary standards of beauty, by picking apart her bodily flaws openly, posing a challenge to a sub-culture which expected women to tuck away their defects: > Corydon. > alt=But she has teeth -- > > Phillario. > \\\\--Consid'ring how they grow, > 'Tis no great matter if she has or no: > They look decay'd with Posset, and with Plumbs, > And seem prepar'd to quit her swelling Gums. Leapor also turned her attention to the marriage market: > (From Strephon to Celia) Now, madam, as the chat goes round, > I hear you have ten thousand pound: > But that as I a trifle hold, > Give me your person, dem your gold; > Yet for your own sake 'tis secured, > I hope – your houses too insured Celia has admitted her love and admiration for Strephon and this is his businesslike reply. He goes on almost to count all Celia's assets on his fingers. He assures her of his admiration, briefly and in highly conventional terms, then returns to the subject that really interests him: her fortune. Leapor ironically exposes the reality of the marriage market and how women are reduced to their financial worth, despite the veneer of sentiment. Today Leapor's work is celebrated for its sharp observations about life as a woman in the 18th century. She remains one of the few female labouring-class writers of the period, along with Ann Yearsley and Elizabeth Bentley. Bibliography *Poems Upon Several Occasions. Vol. I. London: J.

Broadly, this was defined as those who dwelt in the valley of the Nzoia River, on the western slopes of Mount Elgon, and along the northeast coast of Victoria Nyanza. Suggested etiologies of the name \\"Kavirondo\\" include * From local young warriors, armed with spears, bows, arrows, & clubs, who were observed to sit on their heels, which in Swahili is kaa virondo. Thus the region became Kavirondo, the inhabitants pejoratively called wa-Kavirondo: “people who sit on their heels” * From kaba-londo: In Buganda two unusual words related to royalty were combined, kabaka, the king & namu-londo, the stool used as throne on which the king is crowned. (Both putative origins may be doubtful). Origins and divisions Kavirondo is the general name of two distinct groups of ethnic groups, the Bantu speakers and the Nilotic speakers. The Bantu appear to have been the first comers. The Nilotic ethnic groups, probably an offshoot of the Acholi, appear to have crossed Lake Victoria to reach their present home, the country around Kavirondo Gulf. Of the two, the Bantu now occupy a more northerly position than their neighbors, and are practically the most northerly representatives of that race (Hobley). The Nilotic Kavirondo in their turn had their wanderings arrested by an irruption of Elgumi people (themselves probably of Nilotic origin) from the east. The Bantu Kavirondo are divided into three principal types: the Awa-Rimi, the Awa- Ware and the Awa-Kisii. Their Nilotic neighbors call the Bantu Kavirondo Jo- Mwa (singular: Ja-Mwa). The generic name for the Nilotic tribes is Jo-Luo (singular: Ja-Luo), but the Bantu Kavirondo call them Awa-Nyoro. The two groups have many characteristics in common. The Kavirondo have many tribes, divided, Sir H. H. Johnston suspects, totemically. Culture and society Bantu Kavirondo women working a field, early 20th century. A characteristic feature of the people was their traditional nakedness. Among the Nilotic Kavirondo married men who are fathers wore a small piece of goat-skin (Sembe), which though practically useless as a covering was worn according to ethnic etiquette. Even among men who have adopted European clothing this goat-skin must still be worn underneath. Contact with whites has led to the adoption of European clothing by numbers of the men (who were better travelled), but the women (who were less travelled), more conservative, remained in nudity or the scanty covering which they wore before the advent of Europeans. Among the Bantu Kavirondo married women wear a short fringe of black string in front and a tassel of banana fibre suspended from a girdle behind, this tassel having at a distance the appearance of a tail. Hence the report of early travellers as to a tailed race in Africa. The Nilotic Kavirondo women wear the tail, but dispense with the fringe in front. For dandy they wear a goat-skin slung over the shoulders. Some of the Bantu tribes practise circumcision, the Nilotic tribes do not. Patterns are tattooed on chest and stomach for ornament. Men, even husbands, are forbidden to touch the women's tails, which must be worn even should any other clothing be wrapped round the body. The Kavirondo are noted for their independent and pugnacious nature, honesty and sexual morality, traits particularly marked among the Bantu tribes. There are more women than men, and thus the Kavirondo are naturally inclined towards polygamy. Among the Bantu tribes a man has the refusal of all the younger sisters of his wife as they attain puberty. Practically no woman lives unmarried all her life, for if no suitor seeks her, she singles out a man and offers herself to him at a reduced price, an offer usually accepted, as the women are excellent agricultural laborers. The Nilotic Kavirondo incline to exogamy, endeavouring always to marry outside their clan. Girls are betrothed at six or seven, and the husband-elect continually makes small presents to his father-in-law-elect till the bride reaches womanhood. It is regarded as shameful if the girl be not found a virgin on her wedding day. She is sent back to her parents, who have to return the marriage price, and pay a fine. The wife's adultery was formerly punished with death, and the capital penalty was also inflicted on young men and girls guilty of unchastity. Among the Bantu Kavirondo the usual minimum price for a wife is forty hoes, twenty goats and one cow, paid in instalments. The Nilotic Kavirondo pay twenty sheep and two to six cows; the husband-elect can claim his bride after half payment; if a woman dies without bearing children, the amount of her purchase is returnable by her father, unless the widower consents to replace her by another sister. The women are prolific and the birth of twins is common and considered a lucky event, which is celebrated by feasting and dances. Among the Bantu Kavirondo the mother of twins must remain in her hut for seven days; among the Nilotic Kavirondo the parents and the infants must stay in the hut for a whole month. If a Bantu mother has lost two children in succession, the next child born is taken out at dawn and placed on the road, where it is left till a neighbor, usually a woman friend who has gone that way on purpose, picks it up and takes it to its mother who gives a goat in return; a somewhat similar custom prevails among the Nilotic tribes. Names are neither masculine nor feminine, and a girl often bears her father's name. The Kavirondo bury their dead. Among one of the Bantu tribes, the Awa-Kisesa, a chief is buried in the floor of his own hut in a sitting position, but at such a depth that the head protrudes. Over the head an earthenware pot is placed, and his principal wives have to remain in the hut till the flesh is eaten by ants or decomposes, when the skull is removed and buried close to the hut. Later the skeleton is unearthed, and reburied with much ceremony in the sacred burial place of the tribe. Married women of the Bantu tribes are buried in their hut lying on their right side with legs doubled up, the hut being then deserted. Among the Nilotic tribes the grave is dug beneath the verandah of the hut. Men of the Bantu tribes are buried in an open space in the midst of their huts; in the Nilotic tribes, if the first wife of the deceased be alive he is buried in her hut, if not, beneath the verandah of the hut in which he died. A child is buried near the door of its mothers hut. A sign of mourning is a cord of banana fibre worn round the neck and waist. A chief chooses, sometimes years before his death, one of his sons to succeed him, often giving a brass bracelet as insignia. A man's property is divided equally among his children. While some tribes live in isolated huts, those in the north have strongly walled villages. The walls are of mud and formerly, among the Nilotic tribes, occasionally of stone. Since colonization by the British the security of the country induced the Kavirondo to let the walls fall into disrepair. Their huts are circular with conical thatched roofs, and fairly broad verandas all round. A portion of the hut is partitioned off as a sleeping-place for goats, and the fowls sleep indoors in a large basket. Skins form the only bedsteads. In each hut are two fireplaces, about which a rigid etiquette prevails. Strangers or distant relatives are not allowed to pass beyond the first, which is near the door, and is used for cooking. At the second, which is nearly in the middle of the hut, sits the hut owner, his wives, children, brothers and sisters. Around this fireplace the family sleep. Cooking pots, water pots and earthenware grain jars are the only other furniture. The food is served in small baskets. Every full-grown man has a hut to himself, and one for each wife. The huts of the Masaba Kavirondo of west Elgon have the apex of the roof surmounted by a carved pole which Sir H. H. Johnston says is obviously a phallus. Among the Bantu Kavirondo a father does not eat with his sons, nor do brothers eat together. Among the Nilotic tribes father and sons eat together, usually in a separate hut with open sides. Women eat apart and only after the men have finished. Though a peaceful people, the Kavirondo fight well. Their weapons are spears with rather long flat blades without blood-courses and broad-bladed swords. Some use slings, and most carry shields. Bows and arrows are also used; firearms are however displacing other weapons. Kavirondo warfare was mainly defensive and intertribal, this last a form of vendetta. When a man had killed his enemy in battle he shaved his head on his return and was rubbed with medicine (generally goats dung), to defend him from the spirit of the dead man. The Awa-Wanga abandoned this custom when they obtained firearms. The young warriors were made to stab the bodies of their slain enemies. In the colonial era the Kavirondo are on the increase due to their fecundity and morality. Those who live in the low-lying lands suffer from a mild malaria, while abroad they are subject to dysentery and pneumonia. Epidemics of small- pox have occurred. Native medicine is of the simplest. They dress wounds with butter and leaves, and for inflammation of the lungs or pleurisy, pierce a hole in the chest. There are no medicine-men: the women are the doctors. Certain of the incisor teeth are pulled out. If a man retains these he will, it is thought, be killed in warfare. Among certain tribes the women also have incisor teeth extracted, otherwise misfortune would befall their husbands. For the same reason the wife scars the skin of her forehead or stomach. A Kavirondo husband, before starting on a perilous journey, cuts scars on his wife's body to ensure him good luck. Of dances, the Kavirondo have the birth dance, the death dance, that at initiation and one of a propitiatory kind in seasons of drought. Their music is plaintive and sometimes pretty, produced by a large lyre-shaped instrument. They also use various drums. The Luo women use small beads attached to pieces of brass for ear ornaments. Like the aggrey beads of West Africa these beads are not of local manufacture nor of recent introduction. They are ancient, generally blue in color, occasionally yellow or green, and are picked up in certain districts after heavy rain. The natives believe they come down with the rain. They are identical in shape and color to Ancient Egyptian beads and other beads obtained from trade with peoples from ancient cities in Balochistan, in modern Pakistan. Religion and beliefs They appears to practice a vague ancestor worship, but the northern tribes have two gods, Awafwa and Ishishemi, the spirits of good and evil. To the former, cattle and goats are sacrificed. The Kavirondo have great faith in divination from the entrails of a sheep. Nearly everybody and everything are ominous of good or evil to the Kavirondo. They have few myths or traditions; the antbear is the chief figure in their beast-legends. They believe in witchcraft and practise trial by ordeal. Economy The Kavirondo are essentially an agricultural people: both men and women work in the fields with large iron hoes. In addition to sorghum, Eleusine and maize, tobacco and hemp are both cultivated and smoked. Both sexes smoke, but the use of hemp is restricted to men and unmarried women, as it is thought to injure child- bearing women. Hemp is smoked in a hubble-bubble. The Kavirondo cultivate sesamum and make an oil from its seeds which they burn in little clay lamps of the ancient saucer type, the pattern being, in Hobley's opinion, introduced into the country by the coast people. The Kavirondo keep cattle, sheep, goats, fowls and a few dogs. Women do not eat sheep, fowls or eggs, and are not allowed to drink milk except when mixed with other things. The flesh of the wild cat and leopard is esteemed by most of the tribes. Among the Bantu Kavirondo goats and sheep are suffocated, the snout being held until the animal dies. From Eleusine a beer is made. The Kavirondo are plucky hunters, capturing the hippopotamus with ropes and traps, and attacking with spears the largest elephants. Fish, of which they are very fond, are caught by line and rod or in traps. Bee-keeping is common, and where trees are scarce the hives are placed on the roof of the hut. Traditional Kavirondo industries are salt- making, effected by burning reeds and water-plants and passing water through the ashes; the smelting of iron ore (confined to the Bantu tribes); pottery and basket-work.

He became known for his objection to Great Britain's involvement in World War II and his subsequent imprisonment for being an unregistered conscientious objector. In 1939, while working as a life model for art students, he was selected to model for Brylcreem advertisements. During the Battle of Britain he was depicted wearing an RAF uniform, despite the fact that by then he was in prison as a conscientious objector. After serving three sentences he agreed to work as an ambulance driver and then as an agricultural labourer. In the 1950s he studied sociology at the London School of Economics and psychology at the Institute of Psychiatry, following which he undertook research at the Institute of Criminology in Cambridge. During the period at Cambridge, he developed the Spiral Maze, a psychomotor test that was able to distinguish between normal boys and those who were maladjusted or delinquent. This test has also been found to be useful in assessing psychomotor impairment due to drugs. In 1970 he founded the Psychology Department at University of Hertfordshire which he headed until 1976. He was the first president of the British Society of Experimental and Clinical Hypnosis. In 1981 he published a biography of Hans Eysenck, with whom he had worked at the Institute of Psychiatry in London References External links * Tony Gibson page Daily Bleed's Anarchist Encyclopedia * Michael Heap's memoir of Tony Gibson Category:1914 births Category:2001 deaths Category:British conscientious objectors Category:British anarchists Category:British psychologists Category:Academics of the University of Hertfordshire Category:20th-century psychologists ","title":"Tony Gibson (psychologist)"},{"id":"3923094","text":"The Ja'alin, Ja'aliya, Ja'aliyin or Ja'al () are an arabised Nubian tribe in Sudan, constituting a large portion of the Sudanese Arabs. They are the largest among the Sudanese Arabs and are also one of the three prominent tribes of indigenous arabised Nubians in Northern Sudan - The others being the Shaigiya and Danagla. They trace their origin to Ibrahim Ja'al, an Abbasid noble, whose clan originally hailed from the Hejaz and married into the local Nubian population. Ja'al was a descendant of al-Abbas, an uncle of prophet Muhammad. The Ja'alin formerly occupied the country on both banks of the Nile from Khartoum to Abu Hamad.

Citation: The Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, edited by Count Gleichen (London, 1905) At the Egyptian invasion in 1811 they were the most powerful of Arab tribes in the Nile valley. They submitted at first, but in 1822 rebelled and massacred the Egyptian garrison at Shendi with the Mek Nimr, a Ja'ali King (mek) burning Ismail, Muhammad Ali Pasha's son and his cortege at a banquet. The revolt was mercilessly suppressed, and the Ja'alin were thence forward looked on with suspicion. They were almost the first of the northern tribes to join the mahdi in 1884, and it was their position to the north of Khartoum which made communication with General Gordon so difficult. The Ja'alin then became a semi-nomad agricultural people. The Anglo-Egyptian re-conquest of the Sudan began in 1896. In July 1897 Ja'alin tribal leaders refused to allow the Mahdist forces to occupy the Ja’alin town of Metemmeh, a strategic point on the Nile, 180 kilometres downstream of Omdurman. They feared the occupation would be oppressive, threatening both lives and property. After the Khalifa refused an offer from their leaders for the Ja’alin themselves to protect this stretch of the Nile from advancing Anglo-Egyptian forces, the Ja'alin leaders requested protection from General Kitchener, commander of the Anglo-Egyptian army. In response, the Mahdist forces attacked Metemmeh, killing several thousand Ja’alin, including women and children, the killings continuing in the following year. As a consequence, Ja’alin tribesmen supported the Anglo- Egyptian forces on their advance on Omdurman in 1898, including supplying an irregular force of 2,500 cavalry which helped clear the east bank of the Nile of Mahdist fighters in the days before the Battle of Omdurman. Location This group of over four million people live in cities and large towns along the banks of the Nile River, especially in the ancient town of Shendi which has historically served as their tribal capital. The area is very hot and dry, with an average yearly rainfall of about three inches. In the summer, which lasts from April through November, daytime temperatures can reach as high as . Lifestyle Some Jaaliyin still farm and raise livestock along the banks of the Nile River, but today they more commonly consist of the bulk of the Sudanese urban population, forming a large part of the merchant class. Although many have moved to cities, such as the Sudanese capital of Khartoum, they still maintain their tribal identity and solidarity. Famous for maintaining ties with their homeland, they keep in contact with their original home and return for frequent visits, especially for marriages, funerals and Muslim festivals.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed May 13, 2011 tributary of the Illinois River in the U.S. state of Illinois. Its watershed covers approximately , and contains some of the most productive agricultural land in the United States. The river itself maintains some of the highest quality streams in the state and provides habitat for 60-70 native fish species and 25-30 species of mussels. Its name, also spelled Mackinac, is derived from the Ojibwe word mikinaak meaning \\"turtle\\". Description The Mackinaw River begins near Sibley, Illinois, in Ford County. From its headwaters the river flows west through McLean County, where it provides drainage to part of the Bloomington–Normal metropolitan area, and Woodford County. It continues west and then southwestward through Tazewell County before flowing into the Illinois River just south of Pekin. The river flows through three natural divisions, including the Grand Prairie, Upper Mississippi River and Illinois Bottomlands, and Illinois and Mississippi Sand Areas. Early in its life, several thousand years ago following the Wisconsin glaciation, it cut through several moraines, which influenced the structure of the riverbed. The upper section of the watershed is marked by a series of pools and fast-flowing riffles. The character of the river downstream of the moraines is markedly different, with a relatively wide floodplain, large meanders and erosion-prone sandy banks. Its principal tributaries are Panther, Walnut and Money creeks, and the Little Mackinaw River. History People of the Hopewell culture lived in the area 1,700 to 2,100 years ago. The Kickapoo, Potawatomi, Chippewa, and Ottawa peoples also fished, hunted and lived along the river for several centuries, through the 1830s. In 1853 a group of 200 Kickapoo still lived along the river but they were expected to move to a reservation in Missouri the next year.Historical and Statistical Information Respecting the History, Condition and Prospects of the Indian Tribes of the United States Collected and Prepared Under the Direction of the Bureau of Indian Affairs, Per Act of Congress of March 3d, 1847, Henry R.

Abraham Rencher (August 12, 1798 – July 6, 1883) was a politician from the state of North Carolina. His career included: Congressman; Chargé d'affaires to Portugal; and Governor of New Mexico Territory. Biography Rencher was born near Raleigh, North Carolina on August 12, 1798 to John Grant, the county sheriff, and Ann (Nelson) Rencher. He was tutored at home, and attended the common schools and Pittsboro Academy. He graduated from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1822, studied law with Frederick Nash, was admitted to the bar in 1825, and commenced practice in Pittsboro, North Carolina. He was elected as a Jacksonian to the Twenty-first and Twenty-second Congresses, as an Anti- Jacksonian to the Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth Congresses, and as a Whig to the Twenty-fifth Congress, serving from March 4, 1829, to March 3, 1839. He declined to be a candidate for renomination in 1838. In 1840 Rencher was again elected to Congress as a Whig, and he served one term, March 4, 1841, to March 3, 1843 (the Twenty-seventh Congress). He declined to be candidate for renomination in 1842 on the grounds of ill health. Rencher served as U.S. Chargé d'affaires to Portugal from 1843 to 1847, appointed by President John Tyler. From 1857 to 1861 Rencher served as Governor of New Mexico Territory, appointed by President Buchanan. Renchler had previously declined Buchanan's suggestion to become Secretary of the Navy, lobbying instead for the Governor position. He was appointed on August 17, 1857, and arrived in Santa Fe on November 11. While in office Rencher clashed with the military and was critical of their campaign against the Indians. Rencher was successful in passing legislation requiring all children to attend school. He also lowered the territory's debt significantly. In 1859, he signed legislation defining and protecting the status of slaves as property. However, at the beginning of the Civil War Renchler remained loyal to the Union and raised regiments to defend the territory. President Abraham Lincoln did not reappoint Renchler, and he left office in August 1861. After leaving New Mexico Rencher returned to his home in Pittsboro, where he lived in retirement. He was a supporter of the Union and took no active part in the Civil War. He died in Chapel Hill, North Carolina on July 6, 1883, and was interred at St. Bartholomew's Protestant Episcopal Churchyard in Pittsboro. Family In 1836 Rencher married Louisa Mary Jones, daughter of Colonel Edward and Elizabeth Mallett Jones. They had four children.

For more than 250 years, Kazembe has been an influential kingdom or chieftainship of the Kiluba- Chibemba, speaking the Swahili language (a Bantu language with Arabic superstratum) or the language of the Eastern Luba-Lunda people of south- central Africa (also known as the Luba, Luunda, Eastern Luba-Lunda, and Luba- Lunda-Kazembe). Its position on trade routes in a well-watered, relatively fertile and well-populated area of forestry, fishery and agricultural resources drew expeditions by traders and explorers (such as Scottish missionary David LivingstoneDavid Livingstone and Horace Waller (ed.) (1874) The Last Journals of David Livingstone in Central Africa from 1865 to his Death. Two volumes, John Murray.) who called it variously Kasembe, Cazembe and Casembe. Known by the title Mwata or Mulopwe, now equivalent to 'Paramount Chief', the chieftainship with its annual Mutomboko festival stands out in the Luapula Valley and Lake Mweru in present-day Zambia, though its history in colonial times is an example of how Europeans divided traditional kingdoms and tribes without regard to the consequences.

'Mwata' was originally a title equivalent to 'General', the first of the Mwata Kazembe line were warriors. After Mutanda had been dealt with, the group continued the eastward migration under Mwata Kazembe II Kanyembo Mpemba, crossing the Luapula River at Matanda, conquering the indigenous people known as the Shila in the Luapula Valley, and setting up Luba or Lunda aristocrats as chiefs over them.THE MUTOMBOKO CEREMONY. Chiefs of Zambia. Though bringing Lunda and Luba customs and culture (such as the Luba style of ceremonial chieftainship), they adopted the language of the Bemba, a tribe that had also migrated from the Congo and to which they were allied. The kingdom prospered from the fisheries of Lake Mweru and the Mofwe Lagoon, and natural resources, including copper ore in Katanga, west of the Luapula.David Gordon (2000) “Decentralized Despots or Contingent Chiefs: Comparing Colonial Chiefs in Northern Rhodesia and the Belgian Congo.” KwaZulu-Natal History and African Studies Seminar, University of Natal, Durban. Mwata Kazembe was said by the Portuguese to be able to raise a force of 20,000 men, and his lands stretched west to the Lualaba River (the border with Mwata Yamvo's western Luba-Lunda kingdom and with the other Luba's kingdoms north of that) and east to the Luba-Bemba country.

The Kazembe kingdom in its prime in the first half of the 19th Century. The expeditions were: * 1796 Manuel Caetano Pereira, a merchant. * 1798 Francisco José de Lacerda e Almeida who came via Tete and died within a few weeks of arriving at Kazembe's, still waiting for trade negotiations to start. He left a valuable journal which was carried back to Tete by his chaplain, Father Pinto, and which was later translated into English by the explorer Sir Richard Burton. * 1802 Pedro João Baptista and Amaro José, pombeiros (slave traders). * 1831 Major José Monteiro and António Gamito, with 20 soldiers and 120 slaves as porters, sent from Sena by the Portuguese governor of that district. Gamito also wrote a journal and said, \\"We certainly never expected to find so much ceremonial, pomp, and ostentation in the potentate of a region so remote from the sea coast.\\" As trade missions, though, they were all failures. Mwata Kazembe III Lukwesa Ilunga and IV Kanyembo Keleka Mayi rebuffed Portuguese attempts to set up the alliance which would control the Atlantic-Indian Ocean trade route from beginning to end. (The Sultan of Zanzibar and Msiri later took control of that route, with Msiri rather than Kazembe as the linchpin.) =David Livingstone's visit= In 1867 the explorer and missionary David Livingstone embarked on his last expedition in Africa, one aim of which was to discover the southern extent of the Nile basin (i.e. resolving whether Lake Victoria truly was the source of the Nile or whether some other lake further south was the source). From 'Nyasaland' (Malawi) and past the southern tip of Lake Tanganyika, through country ravaged by the slave trade, he reached the northeastern shore of Lake Mweru. He continued south down the eastern shore. Mwata Kazembe VII had been alerted to his arrival and received him at his capital which was then at Kanyembo near the northeast tip of the Mofwe Lagoon: > “The court or compound of Casembe—some would call it a palace—is a square > enclosure of 300 yards by 200 yards.

Owing to such tyranny, he would have difficulty raising a thousand men. He observed that the kingdom was not now as prosperous as the Portuguese had reported. The next year he again visited Mwata, who was the first to tell him that the Chambeshi, Lake Bangweulu, the Luapula, Lake Mweru and the Luvua- Lualaba were all one system. This sent Livingstone exploring Bangweulu, then the Lualaba which he thought may flow into the Nile, and Tanganyika, then back to Bangweulu and his death five years later, still trying to discover how its rivers link up and for any evidence that it was part of the Nile rather than the Congo basin. =Arab and Swahili traders= { align=\\"right\\" style=\\"margin:1em\\" - style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\" 1870–72 VIII Chinkonkole Kafuti - style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\" 1872–83 & 1885–86IX Lukwesa Mpanga - style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\" 1883–85 & 1886–1904X Kanyembo Ntemena } In the 18th and 19th centuries Arab and Swahili traders visited Mwata Kazembe to trade in copper, ivory and slaves. Trade routes such as that from Zanzibar via Ujiji on Lake Tanganyika were well established, and the Sultan of Zanzibar's name carried weight. Livingstone was held up southeast of Lake Tanganyika by a conflict between Tippu Tip (Ahmed bin Mohamed, whom Livingstone called Tipo Tipo) and a local chief. When he reached Mwata Kazembe's he found a trader named Mohamad Bogharib had arrived a few days before seeking ivory, and Mohamad bin Saleh (also known as Mpamari), a trader who had been there for ten years, as Mwata had refused to let him leave. Despite their involvement in the slave trade, Livingstone travelled with and was helped by them; he claimed to have used his influence to get Mohamed bin Saleh released. From the 1860s the kingdom declined, as its copper and ivory trade was usurped by Msiri in Garanganza (Katanga), allied with Tippu Tip and other traders, some of whom attacked and killed Mwata Kazembe VIII. Until his death in 1890 Msiri interfered in the succession of the Mwata Kazembe rulers, and chiefs on the western side of the Luapula paid tribute to him as their Paramount Chief instead of Kazembe. Colonial history =Division between British and Belgian territories= After Msiri's death the Luapula valley was divided in 1894 between Britain – the eastern shores of the Luapula and Lake Mweru became part of North-Eastern Rhodesia, administered by the British South Africa Company (BSAC) – and King Leopold II of Belgium's misnamed Congo Free State (CFS), or rather its agent, the Compagnie du Katanga, which took over the western shores. The Belgian colonial authorities, having killed Msiri were left with a vacuum. They appointed chiefs – not ones chosen from Msiri's subordinate chiefs (who had previously been subordinate to Mwata Kazembe) – but from what the Luba-Lunda called the 'owners of the land' who had preceded them; there was considerable instability in that part of Katanga as a result. “Belgian administration in Mweru-Luapula was glossed over by a thin veneer of traditional justifications.” This included ‘creating’ a tribe from what was a clan, the Bena Ngoma. Once Belgian colonial rule was established west of the Luapula, Mwata Kazembe’s rule and territory, though not his influence, was confined to the eastern side. =British rule imposed by force= Although Mwata Kazembe X had signed a BSAC mineral concession and a British treaty brought to him by Alfred Sharpe in 1890, and allowed visits by British missionary pioneer Dan Crawford, when the BSAC tax collector Blair Watson took up residence on the Kalungwishi River in 1897, Mwata Kazembe refused to let the British flag be flown over his territory or taxes to be collected from his people, and he defeated an armed incursion by Watson's forces. Sharpe by now was governor of the British Central Africa Protectorate (Nyasaland), 1000 km away. It was he who had failed to secure Msiri's Garanganza kingdom as a British Protectorate by negotiation, and had later seen it taken from under British noses by the rival CFS through force. In 1899, in conjunction with Robert Codrington, acting BSAC Administrator of North-Eastern Rhodesia, Sharpe sent British officers with Sikh and Nyasaland troops who burnt Mwata Kazembe's capital to the ground, killing a number of his people, though Mwata himself had already escaped across the Luapula. Mwata Kazembe X made his way south and crossed back over the river to take refuge in the Johnston Falls Mission run by a Mr and Mrs Anderson of Dan Crawford's missionary society. (Ironically, two years before, Mwata Kazembe X had tried to have the Andersons' predecessor at Mambilima, H. J. Pomeroy, killed, but failed.J. Keir Howard. \\"Lammond, William 1876 to 1968.\\" On Dictionary of African Christian Biography website accessed 2 April 2007.) Dan Crawford and Alfred Sharpe had been involved in a similar situation in 1890–91 with Msiri (see that article). At that time Crawford's superior, Charles Swan, had encouraged Msiri to resist Sharpe's British treaty. A year later Msiri was killed by the Belgians, and the region was plunged into chaos. Now, the Andersons responded to Swan differently. While Mr Anderson kept Mwata Kazembe's men at Mambilima, Mrs Anderson took Mwata Kazembe alone to the British officers back at his burnt capital, saying \\"please be kind to him\\". Disarmed by this approach and the Mwata's agreement to accept their rule, the British agreed to let him come back. Mwata Kazembe X rebuilt his capital at Mwansabombwe. This did not make up for the fact that the British troops took a number of old and valuable works of art of Luba origin from the court, which they gave to Codrington. In 1920 his heirs placed them in the National Museum of Southern Rhodesia in Bulawayo, 1000 km away, where they were listed as the 'Codrington Collection'.Neville Jones (1930s). The Codrington Collection in the National Museum of Southern Rhodesia and the Bembesi Industry. Occasional Papers of National Museum of Southern Rhodesia.. They are still there.. After the punitive expedition, Mwata Kazembe X and his successors worked with the BSAC and its successors, the British District Commissioners, and to some extent it rescued his chieftainship. The Mwata Kazembes had some influence in the colonial era because the British colonial administration ruled indirectly through chiefs. =The coming of missionaries= With Dan Crawford's influence Mwata Kazembe X readily agreed to requests to establish missions in the valley, especially from the Christian Missions in Many Lands and the London Missionary Society (LMS) which had sent Livingstone to Africa. In 1900 the LMS Mbereshi Mission was established 10 km from Mwansabombwe.Bwalya S Chuba (2000) Mbeleshi in a history of the London Missionary Society, Pula Press. Here schools, a church and a hospital were established, and brick makers and builders were trained, resulting in the Luapula valley enjoying a higher standard of sun-dried and burnt brick house construction than elsewhere in the region. Other Protestant and Catholic missions established schools and hospitals in the Luapula Valley and on the lake. Though by the mid-20th century Mwata Kazembe’s realm had become overshadowed by the copper mines and industry of Elisabethville (Lubumbashi) and the Copperbelt, through their education gained mostly in mission schools, many Luba-Lunda-Kazembe people made their mark in those towns and in Lusaka, and their experience and influence there flowed back the other way. =Structure of the chieftainship= { align=\\"right\\" style=\\"margin:1em\\" - style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\" 1904–19 XI Mwonga Kapakata - style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\" 1919–36 XII Chinyanta Kasasa - style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\" 1936–41XIII Chinkonkole } Following the Luba chieftainship model, Mwata Kazembe as the Paramount Chief has senior chiefs under him, and subordinate chiefs and village headmen under them. The Senior Chiefs are Lukwesa, Kashiba, Kambwali and Kanyembo. Mwata appoints these chiefs from his family and, upon his death, one of these senior chiefs may be promoted to the paramount position. There are also chiefs in neighbouring districts who pay tribute to Mwata Kazembe. Also following Luba custom, Mwata Kazembe ruled through a council which in colonial times became a 'Superior Native Authority', named in this case the Lunda Native Authority (LNA) to which he appointed a 'cabinet' of advisers who meet under his chairmanship. The LNA was the largest and dominant native authority in the Luapula-Mweru valley. Its work had to be reported to the British District Commissioners who preferred to base themselves in the climate and environment of Kawambwa on the plateau rather than in the heat and mosquitoes of the valley where most of the population lived. It took up a whole day just for quick visit and, in the absence of problems, this allowed the Kazembe chieftainship considerable autonomy. =Functions of the chieftainship= Essentially the functions of the chieftainship are in the realm of local government, with a stronger emphasis on cultural, social and historical aspects of the life of Kazembe people wherever they may live. The Mwata and his council make regulations in areas not covered by national law or provincial regulations, of land and resource use and management, buildings and infrastructure, employment and occupations, trade and markets, hygiene and health, and traditions and customs including traditional marriage and family life. The Mwata has messengers and guards to enforce regulations, and operates a traditional court to try transgressors; he is also involved in the resolution of disputes. =Modernising the chieftaincy= { align=\\"right\\" style=\\"margin:1em\\" - style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\" 1941–50XIV Shadreck Chinyanta Nankula - style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\" 1950–57XV Brown Ngombe - style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\" 1957–61XVI Kanyembo Kapema } The Belgian Congo copper-mining town of Elisabethville developed faster than the Northern Rhodesian Copperbelt. Cut off by the Congo Pedicle, the Luapula Province was regarded as a backwater by the Northern Rhodesian government in the first part of the 20th century, so that at first Elisabethville was the most accessible city for the Kazembe, connected as it was by road to the Congolese port of Kasenga on the Luapula, and by boat from there up the river to Lake Mweru. There was migration from the British-administered side to the Belgian one. For further details, see the articles on the Congo Pedicle and Congo Pedicle road. Mwata Kazembe XIV Shadreck Chinyanta Nankula in the 1940s did much to change this situation. He developed the chieftaincy and the district, and has been called the first \\"modernizing\\" Mwata. He had been educated and employed in Elizabethville and spoke fluent French and English. He galvanised the LNA, changing its name to the Lunda National Association, and appointing to it people with an energy for change and development, like himself. The District Commissioner worried that some of these, such as Dauti Yamba were nationalists who might stir up trouble against the colonial administration, but relationships remained workable. Mwata Kazembe XIV encouraged the building of schools and clinics in Mwansabombwe and the expansion of missions such as Mbereshi. He wrote an account of the chieftainship which was edited by a White Father missionary, Edouard Labreque, and finally published in Chibemba as Ifikolwe Fyandi na Bantu Bandi (My Ancestors and My People) built the current two-storey Mwata's residence but died two days before it was complete. In the early 1950s, some problems were created across the Luapula when the Luba-Lunda there noted that Mwata Kazembe's courts dispensed justice more to their liking than the Belgians and their chiefs, and asked to be tried for transgressions by the Mwata's courts on the grounds that as Lunda, they had that right, and the local chiefs did not have the authority. But this was not granted. The modernising of the chieftainship was matched by an increase in prosperity as the Pedicle road connected the Luapula Province to the Copperbelt, and fish and labour flowed more easily to that market. Independence to the present day { align=\\"right\\" style=\\"margin:1em\\" - style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\" 1961–83XVII Paul Kanyembo Lutaba - style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\" 1983–98XVIII Munona Chinyanta - style=\\"background:#ffdead;\\" 1998– XIX Paul Mpemba Kanyembo Kapale Mpalume } In 1964 Northern Rhodesia became independent Zambia. For a time, chiefs saw their influence overshadowed by party politics and the civil administrations, though in 1985 Mwata Kazembe XVIII was appointed District Commissioner in Kawambwa and later, Provincial Political Secretary. The fish and labour economic booms in the forties, fifties and sixties gave way to recessions and stagnation from the mid- seventies onwards as fish catches declined, Copperbelt employment contracted and national problems had an effect. However, the construction in the late sixties of the 'Zambia Way', a road connecting Mansa to Nchelenge-Kashikishi through Mwansabombwe, and its surfacing and linking to Kawambwa, Samfya and Serenje over the next two decades, has funnelled trade through Mwansabombwe, the population of which has risen to around 50,000. The Mwata Kazembe chieftainship has endured and though originating in war and being surrounded by countries that have experienced much conflict, it has presided over peace on the eastern shores of the Luapula and Lake Mweru for more than a century. Mutomboko Festival In the last two decades the Mwata Kazembe chieftainship has experienced something of a cultural if not an administrative or economic resurgence, through the Mutomboko Festival, now the second largest of its kind in Zambia and a model for the strengthening of indigenous culture. It is held at the end of July and may attract 20,000 visitors, including the president of Zambia.

It is bounded N. by the Tibesti Mountains, and is in great measure occupied by lesser elevations belonging to the same system. These hills to the south and east merge into the plains of Ouaddaï and Darfur. South-west, in the direction of Lake Chad, is the Bodele basin. The drainage of the country is to the lake, but the numerous khors with which its surface is scored are mostly dry or contain water for brief periods only. A considerable part of the soil is light sand drifted about by the wind. The irrigated and fertile portions consist mainly of a number of valleys separated from each other by low and irregular limestone rocks. They furnish excellent dates. Barley is also cultivated. The northern valleys are inhabited by a settled population of Gouran stock, known as the Daza; the others are mainly visited by nomadic Berber and Arab tribes. The inhabitants own large numbers of goats and asses. A caravan route from Barca and the Kufra oasis passes through Bourku to Lake Chad. The country long remained unknown to Europeans. Gustav Nachtigal spent some time in it in the year 1871, and gave a valuable account of the region and its inhabitants in his book, Sahara and the Sudan (1879–1889). In 1899 Bourku, by agreement with Great Britain, was assigned to the French sphere of influence. The country, which had formerly been periodically raided by the Walad Sliman Arabs, was then governed by the Senussi, who had placed garrisons in the chief centres of population. From it raids were made on French territory. In 1907 a French column from Kanem entered Bourku, but after capturing Am Galakka, the principal Senussi station, retired.

The South Eastern Railway Folkestone to London boat train derailed while crossing a viaduct where a length of track had been removed during engineering works, killing ten passengers and injuring forty. In the Board of Trade report it was found that a man had been placed with a red flag away but the regulations required him to be away and the train had insufficient time to stop. Charles Dickens was travelling with Ellen Ternan and her mother on the train; they all survived the derailment. He tended the victims, some of whom died while he was with them. The experience affected Dickens greatly; he lost his voice for two weeks and afterwards was nervous when travelling by train, using alternative means when available. Dickens died five years to the day after the accident; his son said that he had never fully recovered. Derailment On 9 June 1865 the daily boat train to London left Folkestone between 2:36 pm and 2:39 pm, having taken on board passengers from the tidal cross-channel ferry from France. Tender locomotive No. 199 hauled the train, comprising a brake van, a second-class carriage, seven first-class carriages, two second-class carriages and three brake vans, carrying a total of eighty first-class and thirty-five second-class passengers. Three of the brake vans were staffed with guards, with whom the driver was able to communicate using a whistle on the engine. Just after the train passed Headcorn railway station at , the driver saw a red flag. He whistled for the brakes and reversed his engine, but the locomotive and brakesmen only managed to slow the train to around before it derailed at 3:13 pm crossing the Beult viaduct, where a length of track had been removed during engineering works. The high viaduct, with eight openings each wide, crossed over a mostly dry river bed at the time of the accident. The locomotive, tender, van and leading second-class carriage made it across and remained coupled to the first-class carriage, the other end of which rested in the dry river bed. The next seven carriages ended up likewise in the muddy river bed; the last second-class carriage remained coupled to the trailing vans, the last two of which remained on the eastern bank. There were ten fatalities and forty people injured; seven carriages were destroyed, either in the derailment or when rescuing passengers. The Board of Trade report, published on 21 June 1865, found that for the previous eight to ten weeks a team of eight men and a foreman had been renewing the timbers under the track on viaducts between Headcorn and Staplehurst railway stations. The track would be removed when no train was due. However, on 9 June the foreman, John Benge, had misread his timetable as to the schedule that day of the tidal boat train, which ran at a different time depending on the tide in the English Channel. Regulations required a man with a red flag to be away, but the labourer was only away, having counted telegraph poles that were unusually close together, and the train had insufficient time to stop. There had also been no notification to the driver about the track repairs in the area. Witnesses The accident had several witnesses. One described the derailment as \\"two terrible jolts and in an instant ... all became darkness ... and chaos\\". Another reported trapped bodies inside the wreckage, hearing \\"the groans of the dying and wounded, the shrieks of frantic ladies and the shrill cries of young children\\". Charles Dickens was with his mistress Ellen Ternan and her mother, Frances Ternan, in the first-class carriage which did not completely fall into the river bed and survived the derailment. He climbed out of the compartment through the window, rescued the Ternans and, with his flask of brandy and his hat full of water, tended to the victims, some of whom died while he was with them. Before he left with other survivors in an emergency train to London, he retrieved the manuscript of the episode of Our Mutual Friend that he was working on. Although several passengers recognised Dickens, he did not make himself known to the South Eastern Railway, possibly because he did not want publicity about his mistress. The directors of the South Eastern Railway presented him with a piece of plate as a token of their appreciation for his assistance in the aftermath of the accident. The experience affected Dickens greatly; he lost his voice for two weeks and was two and a half pages short for the sixteenth episode of Our Mutual Friend, published in August 1865. Dickens acknowledged the incident in the novel's postscript: > On Friday the Ninth of June in the present year, Mr and Mrs Boffin (in their > manuscript dress of receiving Mr and Mrs Lammle at breakfast) were on the > South-Eastern Railway with me, in a terribly destructive accident. When I > had done what I could to help others, I climbed back into my carriage — > nearly turned over a viaduct, and caught aslant upon the turn — to extricate > the worthy couple. They were much soiled, but otherwise unhurt. [...] I > remember with devout thankfulness that I can never be much nearer parting > company with my readers for ever than I was then, until there shall be > written against my life, the two words with which I have this day closed > this book: — THE END. Afterwards Dickens was nervous when travelling by train, using alternative means when available.

They are often effective in helping organizations overcome cultural bias and broaden their problem-solving capabilities. Private business, especially those heavily invested as government contractors/defense contractors such as IBM and SAIC, and US government agencies such as the CIA, have long used red teams. Red teams in the United States armed forces were used much more frequently after a 2003 Defense Science Review Board recommended them to help prevent the shortcomings that led up to the attacks of September 11, 2001. The U.S. Army then stood up a service-level red team, the Army Directed Studies Office, in 2004. This was the first service-level red team and until 2011 was the largest in the Department of Defense (DoD).  Overview  In military wargaming, the opposing force (or OPFOR) in a simulated military conflict may be referred to as a red cell (a very narrow form of red-teaming) and may also engage in red-team activity. The key theme is that the aggressor is composed of various threat actors, equipment and techniques that are at least partially unknown by the defenders. The red cell challenges the operations planning by playing the role of a thinking enemy. In United States wargaming simulations, the U.S. force is always the Blue Team and the opposing force is always the red team. When applied to intelligence work, red-teaming is sometimes called alternative analysis. When used in a computer security context, a red team or red cell is a group of hackers with varying backgrounds, that would test the assumption of an organization's digital presence and the blue team's threat response activity. Attacks are split into three main groups: cyber (digital attacks), social (attacks on people's behavior), and physical (attack on the facility or equipment of an organization or a third-party provider). A red team's goal is to perform adversary emulation and/or simulation [black-hat hackerattacker]. A red-team assessment is similar to a penetration test in many ways but is more targeted. The goal of this assessment is not to find as many vulnerabilities as possible, but to test the organization's detection and response capabilities. The red team will try to get in and access sensitive information in any way possible, as quietly as possible. . Companies including Microsoft perform regular exercises under which both red and blue teams are utilized. The use of cyber red teams provides \\"real-world attack simulations designed to assess and significantly improve the effectiveness of an entire information security programme\\". The United States Department of Defense (DoD) uses cyber red teams to conduct adversarial assessments on their own networks. These red teams are certified by the National Security Agency and accredited by the United States Strategic Command. This certification and accreditation allows these red teams to conduct the adversarial assessments on DoD operational networks, testing implemented security controls and identifying vulnerabilities of information systems. These cyber red teams are the \\"core of the cyber OPFOR\\". Benefits include challenges to preconceived notions and clarifying the problem state that planners are attempting to mitigate. More accurate understanding can be developed of how sensitive information is externalized and of exploitable patterns and instances of bias.  United States Government  = Army = In the US Army, red-teaming is defined as a \\"structured, iterative process executed by trained, educated and practiced team members that provides commanders an independent capability to continuously challenge plans, operations, concepts, organizations and capabilities in the context of the operational environment and from our partners' and adversaries' perspectives.\\" = University of Foreign Military and Cultural Studies (UFMCS)= The University of Foreign Military and Cultural Studies provides five resident courses: red team Leader (18 weeks), stop-gap red team Leader (9 weeks), red team member (6 weeks), critical thinking for red team practitioner (2 weeks), and red team mobile training (2–28 days). Most resident courses are conducted on Fort Leavenworth and target students from U.S. Army Command and General Staff College (CGSC) or equivalent intermediate and senior level school. (Students must be capable of graduate level education, have completed appropriate PME for grade, and demonstrated tactical and technical proficiency in MOS. Required military grade is E-8 through E-9, W-4 through W-5, O-3 through O-6. Required civilian grade is GS 7-15. The UFMCS Red Team Leader's Course (RTLC) is a graduate-level education of 732 academic hours (18 weeks). The course scope includes the four UFMCS pillars: introspection and self- reflection; groupthink mitigation (GTM); fostering cultural empathy; and applied critical thinking (ACT). Introspection and self-reflection includes: personality dimensions, emotional intelligence, introspective life-changing event presentation, and daily journaling. Groupthink mitigation includes: understanding groupthink causes, and techniques to mitigate. Fostering cultural empathy includes: understanding culture from the perspective of an anthropologist, encompassing cultural meaning, economics, social structure, religion, politics, and globalization. Applied critical thinking includes: how we think, cognitive biases, intuition, complexity and systems thinking, and argument deconstruction. The course includes case studies, country studies, and methods. UFMCS was formed as an outgrowth of recommendations from the Army Chief of Staff's Actionable Intelligence Task Force. UFMCS, as an element of the TRADOC (DCSINT) Intelligence Support Activity (TRISA), located at Fort Leavenworth. TRADOC is an Army-directed education, research, and training initiative for Army organizations and other joint and government agencies designed to provide a red-teaming capability. A UFMCS-trained red-teamer has proven effective in units and organizations from brigades to the Joint Staff. UFMCS curriculum is designed to improve critical thinking by teaching them how to ask better questions and challenge their assumptions they hold sacrosanct. Red-teamers provide commanders with critical decision-making expertise during planning and operations. The team's responsibilities are broad – from challenging planning assumptions, and conducting independent analysis, to examining courses of action, and identifying vulnerabilities. = Joint Enabling Capabilities Command (now US Transportation Command's JECC) = Two operational positions associated with red-teaming existed at the United States Joint Forces Command, formerly called Blue–Red Planners within the Standing Joint Force Headquarters (SJFHQs), then later called the Joint Enabling Capabilities Command, which is now under the US Transportation Command. These two positions, now called Red Team Leaders (RTLs), were designed to provide the Joint Task Force Plans and Operations Groups with insight into the adversary's political and military objectives and potential course of action (COA) in response to real or perceived Blue action. RTLs are the leads of an RT cell composed of operationally oriented experts that analyze a blue team's condition-driven COA, from an adversary-based perspective. The RT cell anticipates potential adversary responses, identifies critical blue-team vulnerabilities and potential operational miscues, and assists in war gaming and COA development early in the Joint Operations Planning Process (JOPP). RTLs, in collaboration with the Combatant Commander's staff and Centers of Excellence, provide in-depth knowledge of the local political landscape, of the adversary's history, military doctrine, training, political and military alliances and partnerships, and strategic and operational objectives. RTLs postulate what a real-world adversary's desired end-state would be, and what such an adversary may surmise the United States' or the Army's desired end- state or objectives to be. Finally, the RTLs help identify, validate, and re- scope potential critical nodes. = United States Marine Corps = The Marine Corps red-team concept commenced in March 2011 when the Commandant of the Marine Corps (CMC) General James F. Amos drafted a white paper titled, Red Teaming in the Marine Corps. In this document, Amos discussed how the concept of the red team needs to challenge the process of planning and making decisions by applying critical thinking from the tactical to strategic level. He also tasked senior leadership in the Marine Corps to transition the red- teaming from a paper concept into real practice. This meant establishing the personnel requirements at the following Marine organizations: Marine Expeditionary Force (MEF), Marine Expeditionary Brigade (MEB), CMC Strategic Initiatives Group (SIG), Marine Corps University (MCU), and MAGTF Staff Training Program (MSTP). In June 2013, the Marine Corps staffed the red-team billets outlined in the draft white paper. In the Marine Corps, all Marines designated to fill red-team positions have to complete either the six-week or nine-week red-team training courses provided by the University of Foreign Military and Cultural Studies (UFMCS). MCU was tasked to have a core of qualified red-team instructors to develop red-teaming curriculum, methodologies, and doctrine, and to teach at the Marine Corps resident Professional Military Education (PME) institutions. The Marine Corps had to provide a Marine officer to be part of the UFMCS instructor staff. LtCol Will Rasgorshek was the first Marine qualified as a red-team instructor at UFMCS teaching the various red-team courses offered at UFMCS. LtCol Brian McDermott was one of the first red-team instructors at MCU. The MCU Red Team develops curriculum, teaches, and supports major academic planning exercises at the following resident MCU institutions: Senior SNCO Academy, Expeditionary Warfare School, Marine Corps Command and Staff College, Marine Corps War College, and School of Advanced Warfighting. In addition, the MCU Red Team supports the USMC Command and Staff blended seminar, the Marine Corps annual Title X wargame, and other wargames as directed by Marine Corps Combat Development Command. In the summer of 2015, the USMC Military Occupational Specialty Manual stated that any Marine who successfully completed the UFMCS Red Team 6- or 9-week course would be authorized the additional military occupational specialty (AMOS) of 0506. In December 2015, the Marines codified the red-team concept into doctrine by incorporating red-team training and readiness requirements developed by the initial red team members at MCU, MSTP, and SIG. The five requirements currently reside in NAVMC 3500.108A, chapter 3: \\"Marine Air Ground Task Force Planner Training and Readiness Manual\\". The mission of Marine Corps red teams is to \\"provide the Commander an independent capability that offers critical reviews and alternative perspectives that challenge prevailing notions, rigorously test current Tactics, Techniques and Procedures, and counter group think in order to enhance organizational effectiveness.\\" = Federal Aviation Administration = The FAA has been implementing red teams since Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. Red teams conduct tests at about 100 US airports annually. Tests were on hiatus after September 11, 2001 and resumed in 2003 under the Transportation Security Administration, who assumed the FAA's aviation security role after 9/11. The FAA use of red-teaming revealed severe weaknesses in security at Logan International Airport in Boston, where two of the four hijacked 9/11 flights originated. Some former FAA investigators who participated on these teams feel that the FAA deliberately ignored the results of the tests and that this resulted in part in the 9/11 terrorist attack on the US. = Transportation Security Administration = The Transportation Security Administration has used red-teaming in the past. An analysis of some red-team operations discovered that undercover agents were able to fool Transportation Security Officers and bring deadly weapons through security at some major airports at least 70% of the time.http://abclocal.go.com/ktrk/story?section=news/local&id;=7848683 = Elsewhere in government = Red-teaming is normally associated with assessing vulnerabilities and limitations of systems or structures. Various watchdog agencies (including, in the United States, the Government Accountability Office and the National Nuclear Security Administration) employ red-teaming. In such contexts, it usually refers to work performed to provide an adversarial perspective, especially when this perspective includes plausible tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP), as well as realistic policy and doctrine.

This was completed in 1939 for use by Vickers-Armstrongs, who built 5,786 Wellington bombers. De Havilland Aircraft took over the factory in 1948 and built 2,816 planes of several designs. Today, the plant is the Airbus wing factory, manufacturing wings for the A320, A330/A340, A350, and A380 aircraft. Airbus wings produced in Broughton are flown out in Airbus Beluga planes with the exception of the large A380 wings which are transported by barge along the River Dee to the nearby Mostyn docks. The Beluga XL was launched in 2019. The Broughton factory was featured in the 2011 BBC Television programme How to Build a Super Jumbo Wing.

In addition to its service as a major shopping center, Kahala Mall also serves as a key stop on a number of TheBus routes. It is located on Waialae Avenue, near the point at which Interstate H1 becomes Kalanianaole Highway. History Opening in November 1954 as Waialae Shopping Center, it was renovated in 1969-1970 by Philip Lyon, Gordon and Company and became known as Kahala Mall. It once included the first F.W. Woolworth Company dime store in Hawaii. Waialae Bowl, the only bowling center within several miles of the neighborhood, at one time operated at the mall, but has since closed. On March 31, 2006, a flood hit the mall. Water affected an estimated 60 of 90 mall businesses, and knocked down two movie auditorium walls. Management Kahala Mall is managed by MMI Realty, Inc. The land under the mall is owned by Kamehameha Schools. Shops Kahala Mall is home to a number of nationally and internationally recognized businesses, including CVS/pharmacy (doing business as Longs Drugs), Whole Foods Market, Claire's, Apple Store, Banana Republic, Macy's, Ross Dress for Less, Starbucks, Jamba Juice, Gamestop, Chili's and California Pizza Kitchen. The mall also houses a movie theatre, Consolidated Theatres Kahala 8. Clientele Local senior citizen residents frequent the mall during its early morning hours in order to partake in one of the many free exercise programs that are offered. Students of all ages are regularly found in the mall during and after business hours; they are free to socialize or use laptop computers at any one of the compound's numerous gathering areas. A notable client was actor Jack Lord of Hawaii Five-O fame, who would take walks in the mall during his later years.
