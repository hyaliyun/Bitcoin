J. Madey (28 February 1943 \\\\- 5 July 2016) was a professor of Physics at the University of Hawaii at Manoa, a former director of the Free Electron Laser Laboratory at Duke University, and formerly a professor (research) at Stanford University. He is best known for his development of the free-electron laser (FEL) at Stanford University in the 1970s.New Light: What is free electron laser, Isamu Sato, International Symposium of Maxillofacial and Oral regenerative biology in Okayama (2003) Raised in Clark, New Jersey, Madey and his older brother Jules took an early interest in ham radio. In 1956, when John was 13 and Jules was 16, they began relaying communications from the south pole to families and friends in the United States. While an undergraduate at the California Institute of Technology, he had a discussion where the question came up as to whether or not it was possible to enhance the transition rate for bremsstrahlung through stimulated emission. Madey received a BS degree in Physics and a MS degree in Quantum Electronics from the California Institute of Technology in 1964 and 1965. He continued thinking about the stimulated emission question while working on his doctoral degree at Stanford, when he invented the free-electron laser. He was awarded a PhD in 1970, and appointed as Professor (Research) of Electrical Engineering in 1986. Madey's free-electron laser patent (US 5130994), filed June 25, 1991, issued July 14, 1992 Stanford University refused to patent this idea so Madey filed for a patent on his own. In the following years, he developed an innovative laser research program which was highly regarded in the scientific community. An opportunity arose for Madey to leave Stanford, taking a tenured position at the Physics Department of Duke University, which Madey accepted in 1988, moving his FEL research laboratory with him in 1989. This laboratory contained substantial equipment which required Duke to build an addition to its physics building to house the lab. In addition, while at Stanford, Madey had obtained sole ownership of two patents practiced by some of the equipment in the FEL lab. Patent litigation At Duke, Madey served for almost a decade as director of the FEL lab. During that time the lab continued to achieve success both in securing research funding and in generating scientific breakthroughs. A dispute arose, however, between Madey and Duke. Duke contends that, despite his scientific prowess, Madey had ineffectively managed the lab, resulting in a negative external review of the science and management in his lab. Madey contends that Duke sought to use the lab‚Äôs equipment for research areas outside the allocated scope of certain government funding, and that when he objected, Duke sought to remove him as lab director. Duke eventually removed Madey as director of the lab in 1997. The removal is not at issue in this appeal, however, it is the genesis of a unique patent infringement case. As a result of his removal from the directorship, Madey resigned from Duke in 1998. Duke, however, continued to operate some of the equipment in the lab. Madey then sued Duke for patent infringement of his two patents, and brought a variety of other claims. Initially, Madey suffered judicial setback, but later appeals courts found in his favor and made a historic judgment in his favor. In Madey v. Duke University, 307 F.3d 1351, 1362 (Fed. Cir. 2002)], the Federal Circuit Court of Appeals on October 3, 2002 effectively ended a 170-year-old practice of allowing scientists to freely borrow patented technologies for limited use in basic research that is not aimed at commercial use. Awards Madey was awarded the Stuart Ballantine Medal from The Franklin Institute in 1989. Madey received the 2012 Robert R. Wilson Prize for Achievement in the Physics of Particle Accelerators, from the American Physical Society \\"For the invention and first experimental demonstration of the free electron laser and important contributions to its conceptual development.\\" Madey was awarded the Willis E. Lamb Award for Laser Science and Quantum Optics in 2016.

Originally an Army officer, he later joined the Royal Flying Corps, and became a flying ace credited with six aerial victories, and ended the war as a captain with two awards of the Military Cross. In World War II he served in the Royal Air Force, winning the Distinguished Flying Cross and rising to the rank of squadron leader. Biography=Background and early life Fielding Johnson was born in Leicester, the son of Thomas Fielding Johnson Jr. (1856‚Äì1931) and Florence Lyne Paget (1856‚Äì1933). He was educated at Rugby School, and was a cadet in the school's Junior Division of the Officers' Training Corps. He was commissioned as a Second Lieutenant in the Leicestershire (\\"Prince Albert's Own\\") Yeomanry on 16 March 1913, a mounted infantry unit of the Territorial Force. World War I The Leicestershire Yeomanry were mobilised in August 1914 at the start of the First World War, and arrived in France in November as part of the North Midland Mounted Brigade. On 13 May 1915, during the Second Battle of Ypres, the regiment was on the front line of the Ypres Salient, occupying a sector of trenches about wide, north of the railway line running north-east from Ypres. Fielding Johnson was with \\"B\\" Squadron occupying the northern half of the line, with \\"C\\" Squadron to the south, and \\"A\\" Squadron in support trenches 300 yards further back. The advanced trenches were in poor condition, only deep and wide at the bottom. The parapets were of loose soil, there were few sandbags, and no dugouts or other forms of protection. Heavy shelling from 3.30 to 6.00 am caused few casualties, before the Germans attempted to launch an assault, but were repulsed. A second, heavier shelling began, until at 7.30 am the Germans attacked again, managing to capture part of \\"B\\" Squadron's trench, and advancing to within 200 yards of the support trenches by using bulletproof steel shields as protection, before digging in. Fielding Johnson and what was left of \\"B\\" Squadron joined \\"C\\" Squadron, and quickly threw up a barricade across the trench line, fighting off the enemy on their flank, and those advancing from the front. Casualties were very heavy and eventually Fielding Johnson was the only officer left. He decided to retire down the trench, cross the railway line and join the 3rd Dragoon Guards on the other side. They had great difficulty in crossing the railway, which was under fire from German machine guns, but managed by building a parapet of sandbags. Fielding Johnson eventually joined the 3rd Dragoons accompanied by a sergeant-major and 14 men, the only survivors from \\"B\\" and \\"C\\" squadrons. \\"A\\" Squadron held their position in the support trenches until noon, when they were reinforced by troops from Royal Horse Guards, the 10th Hussars, and the Essex Yeomanry, and counter-attacked, but succeeded only in driving the Germans back as far as the advanced trenches, so the dead and wounded were never recovered. That day the regiment lost 52 killed, 95 wounded and 39 missing. On 3 July 1915 Fielding Johnson was awarded the Military Cross for his \\"conspicuous gallantry\\" on that day. On 19 October 1915, he began aerial duty as an observer/gunner in 3 Squadron's Morane Parasols. On 19 January 1916, he was injured during a crash. After he recovered, he trained as a pilot. In October 1917, he was posted to 56 Squadron. In a month's action beginning 17 February 1918 and ending 18 March, while flying Royal Aircraft Factory SE.5a No. B37, he destroyed four enemy fighters, drove down another one out of control, and destroyed a reconnaissance two-seater. The latter victory was shared with fellow ace Second Lieutenant Maurice Mealing.Shores et.al, (1990), p. 154 He was awarded the bar to his Military Cross on 13 May 1918. World War II Fielding Johnson joined the Royal Air Force Volunteer Reserve prior to the outbreak of the Second World War, being granted a probationary commission as a pilot officer on 4 July 1939. His commission was confirmed and he was promoted to flying officer on 7 September 1939. Fielding Johnson served as an aerial gunner with 'A' Fight, 214 Squadron and was the oldest rear gunner in the service in 1940‚Äì41. He was promoted to flight lieutenant on 7 September 1940, and was serving as an acting-squadron leader when awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross on 22 September 1942. He was promoted to squadron leader on 1 July 1944. On October 29th 1944, he parachuted to safety behind allied lines after the Mitchell bomber he was flying in was shot down by anti-aircraft fire over Holland. At the time he was Gunnery Officer with 180 Squadron, based in Belgium with the Second Tactical Air Force at Melsbroek. He was uninjured.

The signal reaches the counties of Contra Costa, Solano, Napa, San Joaquin, West Sacramento and Yolo, and KVHS primarily serves the Diablo Valley area. History KVHS Bumper Sticker Collection through the years KVHS went on the air as an AM station in 1966...on 850 (Eagles 85)....then moved to 880AM...and later, 660 AM as a carrier current operation. The first faculty advisor was James Copeland...then Ernie Spencer and Ernie Wilson. By that time KVHS was nothing more than a PA system that was literally wired to all of the classrooms as well as carrier current to the office for PA broadcasting to the campus quad for the rock and roll \\"noon show.\\" At that time, Al Taddeo was \\"Count Clayton.\\" The station was closely affiliated with the old K-KIS 990 AM rocker for music, production supplies and publicity. In 1969, KVHS was granted an FCC license to broadcast on 90.5 FM. In the years that followed, the music formats have changed from block programming and public affairs to Contemporary and Rock, to Hard Rock, to Alternative to its current format of Active Rock. High school and adult students from all over Contra Costa County have always made up the staff of KVHS. The Faculty Advisor for 20 years was Tom Wilson, who has been involved in the radio industry since 1970. After starting out as a call-in guest on KSFO he moved on to KWUN, and also on to KQED-TV. He was also an on-air personality and the Operations Director at KWUN before becoming the Faculty Advisor at KVHS in 1978. KVHS Coverage Map In 1998, Melissa Wilson (a.k.a. Melissa McConnell of San Francisco Bay Area radio and television) took over as General Manager and Faculty Advisor of KVHS-FM. Melissa was an on-air personality and programmer for such radio stations as KYA-FM and AM, K101-FM, KEEN-AM, KDBK/KDBQ-FM (\\"Double 99FM\\"), KKIS-FM and AM, KYCY-FM, KATM-FM, as well as KWUN-AM with Tom Wilson. She transitioned KVHS from signing off the air at 10pm to 24/7/365 operation with the installation of digital automation in 1998, which is responsible for the uninterrupted on-air programming (when there is no live DJ) to date. In 2013, budget cuts were responsible for the layoff of the Faculty Advisor and the closing of the class. The decision to either move the station to another location or hire a new Faculty Advisor to restart the KVHS Radio Communications class is currently under consideration by the MDUSD School Board. Although not affiliated with the Clayton Valley Charter High School, the studios are currently still located on the campus of CVCHS, and the ownership and oversight of the radio station remains by the Mount Diablo School District (also the owner of the CVHS campus.)

Bankhead criticized the way the attacks were carried out and later wrote Captain Gustavus Fox, the Assistant Secretary of the Navy and an old shipmate, that the forts could have been taken in much less time: > Had a boat been sent in to take soundings and a few buoys placed at the > commencement of shoal waters, > the squadron could have gone in close and finished the whole matter up in a > few hours instead of two days > and saved to the Government money, tons of shot and shell which were > literally thrown away... Bankhead was later stationed on and was sent to Charleston, South Carolina, for blockade duty, where his years with the coast survey were put to good use. On May 15 Bankhead was assigned to USS Pembina and which was ordered to join the blockading force off Charleston. Pembina was assigned to this important blockading station because of her shallow draft, which was necessary for this inshore duty.Still, 1988, pp.65-66 On May 16 Pembina arrived off Charleston and Bankhead was ordered by the senior officer present, Commander John B. Marchand, to determine if the water over the bar at the entrance to the Stono River was deep enough to allow his warships to cross over.Still, 1988, p.66 Throughout the summer of 1862, Bankhead remained on blockade duty near Charleston. Bankhead was promoted to commander on July 16, 1862, and in the middle of August Pembina was ordered to New York for repairs. Flag Officer DuPont wrote a letter on Bankhead's behalf to Captain Gustavus Fox, Assistant Secretary of the Navy, requesting that he be transferred to an ironclad vessel. Bankhead was given Monitor and took command from Thomas Stevens on September 10, 1862. Command of USS Monitor Bankhead was sent to New York in the beginning of September with Pembina for needed repairs to the vessel. He was recommended by Flag Officer DuPont for command of Monitor to which Secretary Fox complied. Upon arriving in New York, Bankhead received orders to take command of Monitor. He was then sent to Hampton Roads and upon arrival relieved Commander Stevens on September 10. Shortly after the change of command, a board of survey condemned the ironclad's engines and boilers and recommended that they be extensively overhauled and on October 3, 1862, the ironclad arrived at the Washington Navy Yard for repairs. For approximately six weeks the vessel remained in Washington's Navy yard while her bottom was scraped clean of barnacles and other sea fowl while the engines and boilers were overhauled and the entire vessel cleaned and painted, and a number of improvements made, including an iron shield around the top of the turret. She was taken out of drydock on October 26. By November the ship was fully repaired and outfitted and ready to return to service at Hampton Roads.Still, 1988, p. 67 Orders were issued on December 24, 1862, for Monitor to move to Beaufort, North Carolina to join and . There the ship would join the blockade off Charleston. On Christmas Day Monitor was ready for sea, but because of stormy weather and rough seas the departure was delayed until 29 December. The actual orders were received on Christmas Day as the crew were celebrating the holiday aboard Monitor at Hampton Roads in what was described as a most merry fashion while many other celebrations were occurring along the shore. Bankhead paid the ship's cook one dollar to prepare a meal for the crew befitting the day, however it was received with mixed opinion. That day, Monitor was made ready for sea, her crew under strict orders not to discuss the impending voyage with anyone.Quarstein, 2010, p. 106 but bad weather delayed her departure until 29 December. While the design of Monitor was well-suited for river combat, her low freeboard and heavy turret made her highly unseaworthy in rough waters. Monitor put to sea on December 31, under tow from , when a heavy storm developed off Cape Hatteras, North Carolina. Using chalk and a blackboard, Bankhead wrote messages alerting Rhode Island that if Monitor needed help she would signal with a red lantern.Quarstein, 2010, p. 171 On December 31, 1862, a storm hit seas off Cape Hatteras, and Monitor, under tow by Rhode Island. Monitor was soon in trouble as the storm increased in ferocity, large waves splashing over and completely covering the deck, flooding into the vents and ports. She began rolling uncontrollably in the high seas. Sometimes she would drop into a wave with such force the entire hull would tremble. Leaks were beginning to appear everywhere. Bankhead ordered the engineers to start the Worthington pumps, which temporarily stemmed the rising waters, but soon Monitor was hit by a squall and a series of violent waves and water continued to work its way into the hull. When the Worthington pump could no longer control the flooding, a call came from the engine room that water was gaining there. Realizing the ship was in serious trouble, Bankhead signaled Rhode Island for help and hoisted the red lantern next to Monitors white running light atop the turret. He then called for volunteers and ordered the towline cut and the anchor dropped to stop the ship's rolling and pitching, with little effect,Quarstein, 2010, p. 172 making it no easier for the rescue boats to get close enough to receive her crew. Acting Master Stodder, along with crewmates John Stocking, and James Fenwick volunteered and climbed down from the turret, but eyewitnesses said that as soon as they were on the deck Fenwick and Stocking were quickly swept overboard and drowned. Stodder managed to hang onto the safety lines around the deck and finally cut through the towline with a hatchet.Mariner's Museum, Article: The Last Voyage of the USS Monitor At 11:30 p.m. Bankhead ordered the engineers to stop engines and divert all available steam to the large Adams centrifugal steam pump;Mariner's Museum, Article: Last Voyage but with reduced steam output from a boiler being fed wet coal it too was unable to stem the rapidly rising water.Quarstein, 2010, pp. 171‚Äì72;Broadwater, 2012, p. 13 After all steam pumps had failed, Bankhead ordered some of the crew to man the hand pumps and organized a bucket brigade, but to no avail.Quarstein, 2010, pp. 149-150 Despite a prolonged and desperate rescue effort, Monitor was finally overwhelmed, foundered and sank approximately southeast off Cape Hatteras with the loss of sixteen men, including four officers, some of whom remained in the turret and went down with the ironclad. A total of forty-seven men were rescued by the life boats from Rhode Island.Broadwater, 2012, p. 12Holloway, 2013, pp.7-8 Bankhead survived the ordeal and was the last man to abandon the ship, but suffered from exposure.Mariner's Museum, Article: John P. Bankhead, 2013 After his initial recovery, Bankhead filed his official report, as did the commanding officers of the Rhode Island, stating officers and men of both Monitor and Rhode Island did everything within their ability to keep Monitor from sinking. The Navy did not find it necessary to commission a board of inquiry to investigate the affair and took no action against Bankhead or any of his officers.Broadwater, 2012, p. 14 Command of USS Otsego After surviving the ordeal with the loss of Monitor during the fall and early winter months of 1863-1864, Bankhead recovered slowly. He finally requested active duty in January 1864 and on February 3 was given command of the new double ender side-wheel gunboat . The ship was commissioned in the spring and reached Hampton Roads by 24 May 1864. Otsego was assigned to the North Atlantic Blockading Squadron with her station to be the North Carolina sounds. On June 21 Bankhead was given command of Union naval forces in the sounds. His major responsibility was capturing or destroying the Confederate ironclad ram up the Roanoke River. In April Confederate troops assisted by Albemarle had seized and were now occupying Plymouth, North Carolina, a few miles up the Roanoke. On 5 May Albemarle descended the river and attacked Union gunboats in the sound in an engagement that lasted nearly three hours. The Confederate vessel, badly damaged and in need of repairs, returned to Plymouth. Throughout the summer months it was feared that she would again attempt to enter the sounds and Bankhead, with Otsego and four additional gunboats, guarded the river's mouth. Sometime in the late summer he was detached from Otsego, probably because of poor health.Still, 1988, p. 72 Command of USS Wyoming was transferred to the Asiatic Squadron, and Bankhead was promoted to captain on 25 July 1866 and remained in command until 1867, when due to poor health he requested to be relieved of duty. He died on April 27, 1867, off Aden on the Bengal steamer Simla, on his way home to the United States.Quarstein, 2010, p. 190 Bankhead ended the war still in command of Wyoming, which was stationed in the Pacific searching for See also *Union Navy *Confederate States Navy ReferencesNotesBibliography  Further reading *Bibliography of American Civil War naval history Category:1821 births Category:1867 deaths Category:United States Navy personnel of the Mexican‚ÄìAmerican War Category:People of South Carolina in the American Civil War Category:Union Navy officers Category:19th-century American naval officers ","title":"John P.

In June 2015, a new gallery in the Wheelwright Museum of the American Indian, was named for her. The first permanent museum gallery devoted to Native American jewelry, the Martha Hopkins Struever Gallery, is part of the Center for the Study of Southwestern Jewelry. Early personal life and education Struever was born in 1931 in Milan, Indiana, the only child of Lester Harper Hopkins, M.D. and Eva Montalie (Neill) Hopkins. She grew up in rural southeastern Indiana in Versailles. After obtaining her Bachelor of Science degree from Purdue University in Lafayette, Indiana in 1953, Struever attended the Tob√©-Coburn School For Fashion Careers (now the Wood Tob√© Coburn School) in New York City. On November 16, 1953 she married Richard Burnham Lanman Sr. of Hammond, Indiana with whom she had two sons: Richard Burnham Lanman, M.D. and Todd Hopkins Lanman, M.D. She was widowed when Richard Sr. died of leukemia on December 8, 1966. Martha married Edgar Allen \\"Bud\\" Cusick in 1971 and divorced in 1988. Career After being widowed, Struever began collecting and dealing in American Indian art. In 1970 she visited San Ildefonso Pueblo and purchased her first piece, a \\"gun metal sheen\\" pottery plate by Maria Montoya Martinez and her son Popovi Da. In 1976, she established the Indian Tree Gallery in Chicago, Illinois featuring historic and contemporary American Indian jewelry, pottery, Kachina dolls, weavings, and paintings. In order to bring the best Southwestern Indian artists to her Chicago gallery, she visited the Pueblo and Navajo reservations (often alone) to begin what were to become lifelong relationships with such prominent artists such as Charles Loloma, the foremost American Indian jeweler, and Dextra Quotskuyva, the pre-eminent contemporary Hopi potter. Martha helped many Indian artists gain exposure outside of Southwestern markets by sponsoring shows for them in Chicago. Martha hosted Maria Martinez at her Chicago gallery in 1977 - and arranged a special reception at the Chicago Art Institute for the then 90-year-old potter. In addition to prominent artists, a primary focus of Martha's career has been the identification and encouragement of talented new Indian potters and jewelers. Martha sponsored the first exhibitions of now-notable jewelers Gail Bird and Yazzie Johnson, Richard Chavez, Norbert Peshlaki, and Perry Shorty, as well as potters Dextra Quotskuyva, Steve Lucas and Les Namingha. On November 12, 1988, Struever married noted archaeologist Stuart M. Struever and relocated to Santa Fe, New Mexico. By 2006, she was recognized as the \\"grande dame\\" of American Indian art dealers, and received the first Lifetime Achievement Award from the Antique Tribal Art Dealers Association \\"for contributions to the understanding and preservation of tribal art\\". Over the past thirty years, Struever conducted over sixty traveling art and archaeology seminars throughout Navajo and Pueblo lands. Her seminars were enriched by her relationships with the many Indian artists whose careers she has encouraged. Struever's philanthropic work included overseeing nine Indian Art Shows in Chicago, Washington, DC, and Denver, bringing 25 artists to each event, for the benefit of the nonprofit Crow Canyon Archaeological Center. Crow Canyon was founded by her husband, Stuart Struever. She had two sons. She died on September 24, 2017. The Martha Struever Indian Art Collection is now hosted by the Turquoise and Tufa Gallery in Sante Fe, New Mexico. Publications and scholarly work Struever published reference works, authoring the two books \\"Loloma: Beauty Is His Name\\" (Wheelwright Museum, 2006) and \\"Painted Perfection: The Pottery of Dextra Quotskuyva\\" (Wheelwright Museum, 2002), as well as museum catalogues entitled \\"Nampeyo: A Gift Remembered\\" (Kendall College, Mitchell Museum, 1984), \\"Hopi Art: A Century of Continuity and Change\\" (San Francisco Museum of Craft and Folk Art, 1987), and \\"Legends of Pueblo Pottery\\" (Wheelwright Museum, 1997). She has guest curated museum exhibitions in several cities. As Struever's scholarly reputation has grown, she has become recognized as one of the foremost experts on the pottery of Nampeyo, the jewelry of Loloma and the works of other significant Southwestern Indian artists.

She was affiliated with the Washington University in St. Louis for more than 50 years from 1954 until 2007. Early years Robins was born in New Orleans, Louisiana. In 1942 and 1943, she received bachelor's and master's degrees from Radcliffe College, and in 1951 she received a doctoral degree in sociology from Harvard University. After completing her doctoral program, Robins worked as a research assistant in the Department of Psychiatry at Massachusetts General Hospital. Academic career and research In 1954, Robins became a member of the faculty at Washington University School of Medicine as a research assistant. She continued to work at Washington University for the next 50 years, being promoted to assistant professor in 1959, associate professor in 1962 and full professor (in sociology in psychiatry) in 1966. She founded and served as the director of the school's Master's Program in Psychiatric Epidemiology. During her career at Washington University, Robins was recognized as a leader in research into psychiatric epidemiology, the study of the root causes of mental disorders in a population-wide sense. She was also \\"a leader in the development of diagnostic criteria for psychiatric diagnosis.\\" The Los Angeles Times reported that Robins \\"pioneered the field of psychiatric epidemiology\\" and \\"played a key role in determining the prevalence of mental problems in the United States and the world.\\" Robins' research in the 1960s showed that abnormal behavior in childhood was an important predictor of psychiatric problems in adulthood. As an indicator of adult problems including alcoholism, divorce and incarceration, childhood antisocial behavior was found in the data to be a more accurate indicator than factors such as social class, family background, and childhood fears. Her research in the field led to new thinking in the mental health field on issues including teen suicide and drug abuse. Her major study on the subject was published in 1966 under the title, \\"Deviant Children Grown Up: A Sociological and Psychiatric Study of Sociopathic Personality.\\" This work would shape the later diagnosis of Antisocial Personality Disorder, and Robins would sit on the American Psychiatric Association's DSM committee which decided upon it.Standardising antisocial personality disorder: the social shaping of a psychiatric technology M Pickersgill, Sociology of Health & Illness Vol. 34 No. 4 2012 , pp. 544‚Äì559, doi: 10.1111/j.1467-9566.2011.01404.x Robins also conducted studies on psychiatric epidemiology among Vietnam veterans, disaster survivors and other groups. In the 1970s, the federal government funded her research into Vietnam veterans who were addicted to heroin or opium. Her research showed that many drug- addicted veterans recovered spontaneously when they returned to the United States‚Äîa finding that challenged the idea that such addiction was irreversible. Kathleen Bucholz, a professor of psychiatry at Washington University, stated that Robins' \\"particular genius\\" was in \\"developing carefully honed questions for surveys that gathered information about the origins and incidence of mental illness.\\" She wrote the diagnostic interview schedule and was one of the principal investigators for the Epidemiologic Catchment Area study that involved interviews of more than 20,000 Americans to determine the prevalence of psychiatric illness in the general population. Robins later prepared a multicultural version of her diagnostic interview schedule for international use by the World Health Organization. Robins published more than 250 papers on topics including suicide, substance abuse among adolescents and Vietnam War veterans, alcoholism, and antisocial disorders and behavior in children. In 2001, Robins retired as an active professor, but continued as a professor emerita and researcher at Washington University until 2007. Honors and awards Robins received numerous honors and awards in her career, including being named as a fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and the Society for the Study of Addiction to Alcohol and Other Drugs. She was also a recipient of the Paul Hoch Award from the American Psychopathological Association, the Nathan B. Eddy Award from the College on Problems of Drug Dependence and the Lifetime Achievement Award from the Alcohol, Tobacco and Other Drugs section of the American Public Health Association. She was also named an honorary fellow of the Royal Society of Psychiatrists and of the American Society of Psychiatrists. Robins also served on the editorial boards of numerous journals, including Criminal Behaviour and Mental Health, Epidemiologia e Psichiatria Sociale, International Journal of Methods in Psychiatric Research, Development and Psychopathology, Journal of Child Psychology and Psychiatry, Psychological Medicine, and Social and Community Psychiatry. Personal life Robins was married to Eli Robins, an influential biological psychiatrist (e.g. Feighner Criteria and DSM-III), and they had four sons. Her husband died in 1994.

The underlying principal is that the historical industrial use of landscapes or sites creates a new environment which species can use either by design as in the case of a park or revegetated area, or by colonisation. The concept has its origins in Germany, specifically at the Emscher Landscape Park in the Ruhr, (of which the Landschaftspark Duisburg-Nord is the best known example) and has been applied at the Sudgelande Park in Berlin. Another example can be found at the Deutsches Technikmuseum German Museum of Technology (Berlin), at the former locomotive workshops and goods yard (Anhalter G√ºterbahnhof) of Berlin-Anhalt Railway Company.

It was established in 1966 and covers an area of . The park's core zone, , covers the greatest part of the Valia Calda valley and the slopes of the surrounding peaks. The national park has an elevation range from and is characterized by dense forests of European black pine and common beech, rocky ridges, several peaks over , rapid streams and mountain lakes. The area belong to the wider Pindus Mountains mixed forests ecoregion and is a representative part of Pindus mountain range. Moreover, it belongs to the Natura 2000 ecological network of protected areas and is one of the three places in Greece that hosts a population of brown bears. Geography The park lies on the borders of Grevena and Ioannina regional unit, north of the town of Metsovo and near the villages of Vovousa, Perivoli and Milea. There are no settlements or any facilities inside the protected area's borders.Valia Calda refuge. Vovousa. X. Papaioanou. Several peaks reach an altitude of over ; these include Avgo, , Kakoplevri, , Flegga, , Tria Sinora, and Aftia, . The underlying rock formations are mainly serpentine and they support a specialized range of plants. Climate The park's climate is montane and varies according to elevation and aspect. Annual rainfall ranges , whereas mean monthly temperatures vary between . Biology Lilium chalcedonicum in Pindus National Park Flora The park was established in 1966 and is considered one of the most important protected areas for the maintenance of mountainous biodiversity and ecosystem integrity at the national level. Forests of European black pine (Pinus nigra) and common beech (Fagus sylvatica) cover the park's lower and middle altitudes , with several of these trees being more than 700 years old. At higher altitudes , Bosnian pine (Pinus heldreichii) woodland is dominant, while at the greatest heights , only certain types of bushes are found in the treeless alpine meadows. Additionally, the dry places and the lower parts of the valley are characterized by the domination of Buxus sempervirens, while some individuals of Abies borisii-regis are scattered among the Pinus nigra and Fagus sylvatica forests. In total, 415 types of plants and 86 species of mushroom are recorded in the area. A number of local flower types are considered endemic to the Balkans, such as Dianthus deltoides and Allium breviradum. On the other hand, many endemic plants of central and northern Greece grow also in the park, like the Centaurea vlachorum.Tsunis 1988: p. 1 Moreover, rare species of the forests of Pindus mountains, typical of the lower geological layers, are Minuartia baldaci, Bornmuellera tymphaea, Campanula hawkinsiana, Viola dukadjinica and Silene pindicola. The most important places for the gathering of rare plants are the northern slopes of the peaks of Aftia, Flegga and Kapetan Kleidi. All the above places are very steep and difficult for grazing animals and therefore natural regeneration of the forest in this area is progressing normally and many rare plants are conserved. The serpentine soil, which is dominant in the area of the Pindus National Park also favors the growing of rare endemic plant species.Natura 2000: p. 9 Fauna Fire salamander in Pindus National Park The national park is one of three areas in Greece that hosts a population of Eurasian brown bears (Ursus arctos arctos), which is considered a conservation priority species. The region itself is also called \\"bear park\\". Other large mammals that live in the park are lynxes, roe deers and wildcats, with the last two being found in the area of Flegga forest.Tsunis 1988: p. 3 Additionally wolves, beech martens, wild boars and red squirrels are present in the area all year round.Gibbons (2003): p. 43 On the other hand, the Balkan chamois (Rupicapra rupicapra balcanica), a Balkan endemic species, is found on the steep and rocky parts of the park, as well as in areas with beech forests. Its population density fluctuates between 3-5 and even 20 individuals per depending on the habitat productivity. The three small rivers crossing the area of the park have very clear water and are the well conserved habitat of the otter.Natura: p. 10 In the area of the national park up to five types of bat have been reported, with most common being niktovatis (Nyctalys noctula). Moreover, it provides shelter for than 80 species of birds, such as 10 types of rare bird species including the eastern imperial eagle, golden eagle, Levant sparrowhawk and the lanner falcon, which indicates the ornithological importance of the area.Tsunis 1988: p. 2 One of the rare birds found in the park is the shore lark (Eremophilla alpestris), found in the alpine meadows, and the great grey shrike (Lanius excubitor), which migrates in the summer from Africa. The dense and mature forests of the area host eight types of woodpecker, including the white-backed, the middle spotted, the lesser spotted and the black woodpecker. Management The mountains in Pindus National Park Since 2003, the park is under the administrative authority of the 'Northern Pindus Management Body'.Natura 200: p. 14 This authority is responsible for the ecological management of a much larger region that includes eight protected areas in Greece, also part of the Natura 2000, an initiative by the governments of the European Union that aims to protect the most seriously threatened habitats and species across Europe. The 'Northern Pindus Management Body', together with the local forest service, is responsible for regulating human activities and maintaining the ecological value of the protected area. However,until now this target remains elusive, because of a lack of expertise and of a science-based management plan. A great need therefore exists to conduct conservation-oriented research that can be translated directly into practical management proposals.Kati 2009: p. 2 The core of the national park has been declared a 'biogenetic reserve' zone by the European Council with human activities such as woodcutting, grazing, hunting, fishing and access by car prohibited. In the park's buffer zone activities are also controlled in general.Kati 2009: p. 3 The most serious danger the park faced in the past were extensive fires caused by cattle breeders to create meadows for grazing. These fires have destroyed large parts of the Pinus nigra and P. heldreichii forests. However, since 1960, no fire has occurred due to improved protection measures by opening up many forest roads. Furthermore, an observation post was established near Avgo peak. A potential threat for the national park is a state initiative to divert the Arkoudorema river for the construction of a hydroelectric power plant. This initiative will have a negative impact on the park since a great part of the existing forest area will be covered by water, resulting in the reduction of the core zone. Another danger is the high grazing pressure in the core area, while a number of small coal-producing units at the outskirts of the park have raised a lot of concern. Recreation Pindus National Park is considered as one of the least visited and least known national parks in Europe and it is not signposted from the main roads of the region.Gibbons (2003): p. 42 The area offers opportunities for hiking with its dirt roads being in good condition except in winter. The park can be best accessed from north, from the village of Perivoli, while there is also a track from the west side, near Milia.Gibbons (2003): p. 44 A climbing resort lies near Mavrovouni peak, at a height of , which is an ideal base for excursions to the park's area. According to the local legislation, the collection of any kind of organism is not allowed, while camping and staying in the park's core after the setting of the sun is prohibited. Additional restrictions include the lighting of fires, while activities such as kayaking and rafting need a special clearance from the local forestry.

During the trial of Clay Shaw, he was questioned by New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison regarding his Warren Commission testimony in which he had mentioned a man named Clay Bertrand having called him shortly after the assassination of John F. Kennedy asking him to represent Lee Harvey Oswald in Dallas, Texas. In August, 1967 Andrews was convicted on three counts of perjury for lying to a grand jury in his previous testimony. Warren Commission testimony On November 25, 1963, Andrews informed the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) that three days earlier (on the day of the assassination of President Kennedy) he received a telephone call from a Clay Bertrand who asked him whether he would be willing to represent the suspected assassin of Kennedy, Lee Harvey Oswald.Commission Exhibit No. 1931, Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 23, p. 726.Commission Exhibit No. 3094, Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 26, pp. 704-705. Andrews subsequently repeated his claim regarding the phone call in testimony before the Warren Commission in July 1964.Testimony of Dean Andrews, Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 11, pp. 331-334. Andrews described Bertrand as a \\"swinging cat\\" (what Andrews defined as a bisexual) who occasionally guaranteed fees for some of Andrews' homosexual clients.Testimony of Dean Andrews, Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 11, p. 335. Two weeks after the assassination, the FBI reported that Andrews had admitted that Bertrand was a \\"figment of his imagination\\". The FBI report stated that Andrews had been hospitalized at the time with pneumonia and was under heavy sedation. However, Andrews would later deny the FBI report, claiming that he had never suggested that Bertrand might not be real.Testimony of Dean Andrews, Warren Commission Hearings, vol. 11, p. 334. Later, Andrews would claim that Bertrand was a cover for his friend Eugene Davis. In later years, Andrews continued to maintain that he had, in fact, received the phone call asking him to defend Oswald, but claimed that he was afraid to reveal the caller's true identity.Summers, Anthony. Not in Your Lifetime, (New York: Marlowe & Company, 1998), p. 241. Trial of Clay Shaw In the spring of 1967, New Orleans District Attorney Jim Garrison ‚Äî who over the course of several months had been investigating the assassination of President Kennedy ‚Äî asserted that Clay Bertrand was actually New Orleans businessman Clay Shaw. Garrison alleged that Shaw used the alias Clay Bertrand among New Orleans' gay society.James Phelan, Scandals, Scamps, and Scoundrels, pp. 150-51. ()Garrison, Jim. On The Trail of the Assassins, (New York: Sheridan Square Press, 1988), pp. 85-86. Garrison further believed that Shaw and a group of right-wing activists, including David Ferrie and Guy Banister, were involved in a conspiracy with elements of the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) in the Kennedy assassination.Jim Garrison Interview, Playboy magazine, Eric Norden, October 1967.Garrison, Jim. On The Trail of the Assassins, (New York: Sheridan Square Press, 1988), pp. 12-13, 43, 176-178, 277, 293. Garrison arrested Shaw on March 1, 1967. Shaw was booked on conspiracy to commit murder, but denied that he had ever used the name Clay Bertrand. Shaw was eventually acquitted of the charges. Andrews contradicted his testimony before the Warren Commission when, after appearing before the Orleans Parish grand jury, Dean Andrews stated in an interview on June 28, 1967 that Bertrand was not Shaw but was Eugene Davis, his friend and client. Davis denied in an affidavit that he was Bertrand or the person who suggested that Andrews go to Dallas to help Oswald. Andrews was subsequently convicted on three counts of perjury for lying to the grand jury on August 14, 1967. On February 25, 1969, Andrews testified during the trial of Clay Shaw that the name \\"Clay Bertrand was a figment of [his] imagination\\" and that he had been \\"carrying on a farce\\" in order to prevent \\"bring[ing] a lot of heat and trouble to someone who didn't deserve it.\\" A Secret Service report issued in December 1963, two weeks after the assassination of President Kennedy, stated that Dean Andrews said that Lee Harvey Oswald had visited Andrews' office on approximately three occasions in June and July 1963, seeking legal advice from Andrews concerning his citizenship status, his wife's status and his undesirable discharge from the Marine Corps.

A single match mode in which the player must defeat their opponents in round-based matches, and a team match mode similar to The King of Fighters series in which two teams of three members must battle each other until the members of one team are all defeated. Like most fighting games, special moves are performed by inputting a specific series of directional commands and/or buttons. The game features a unique type of special moves known as \\"Bomber Moves\\" (aka \\"Super Attacks\\" in the US version), which can deliver greater damage than standard special moves in exchange of some of the player's vitality. These moves act like those from most beat 'em up games and are performed by pressing all three punch buttons. There are also \\"Super Bomber\\" moves (also called \\"Final Attacks\\" in the US version) which can only performed while the player's vitality gauge is flashing. The player can also jump unto trees or cranes to avoid attacks by pressing all three kick buttons. The player can attack an opponent who is lying on the ground, as well as do an emergency escape roll when their character is knocked to the ground. Characters Dragoon Might features a total of twelve selectable characters, as well as a non-playable final boss during the game's single-player mode. The story centers around a mythical relic known as the Dragon Medallion that will grant its collector one wish. The Medallion has been broken into thirteen fragments that has subsequently come into the possession of each main character, who must fight each other for their fragments until one of them collects all thirteen of them. ; :The lead character. A katana-wielding warrior. In his ending, he spends his time playing pachinko after collecting the Medallion, but ends up destroying the machine when he continues losing all the time. ; :The lead heroine. A shrine maiden descended from a tengu. She seeks to collect the Medallion in order to maintain world peace. She fights using a hand-held fan. ; :A ninja who serves the Sanada clan. He is the only playable character who fights barehanded. ; :A masked ninja who is also a serial killer. He wields a claw on one hand and a crescent-shaped blade on the other. ; :A stern-looking underground professional wrestler with a title \\"Reggie the Black Hole\\" who wishes to be on the front stage with his younger brother.

Shkolnaya Street (, Shkolnaya ulitsa) in Tagansky District of Moscow, Russia connects Dobrovolcheskaya Street in the west with Rogozhskaya Zastava Square in the east. The street, a protected heritage area lined with two-storey 19th century buildings, is closed to through traffic and is a de facto pedestrian zone and a weekend market place. Historically it was known as First Rogozhskaya street, the main trading street of the former Rogozhskaya Yam sloboda, and acquired its current name, one of the most common in Soviet toponymy, in 1923. History=Coachmen's sloboda Rogozhskaya sloboda of yam coachmen serving the mail route to Vladimir and Ryazan was established as an eastern suburb of Moscow in the end of the 16th century. The name of the sloboda and its streets goes back to Rogozhi (now Noginsk), the first overnight station on the Vladimirka road. In the second half of the 18th century the area experienced an influx of Old Believers, a persecuted religious minority that was allowed to practice their faith in an out-of-town Rogozhskoye Cemetery; the entrepreneurial and secretive dissidents formed a unique business community west of the coachmen's sloboda and contributed to industrialization of Eastern Moscow in the 19th century.Taplin, Phoebe (2010). Olde-worlde streets in Russia‚Äôs capital . The Moscow News, April 8, 2010. By 1848 First Rogozhskaya Street, one block south from the main Vladimirka road, was firmly established as the principal trading street of the sloboda (this is evidenced by black facade lines on contemporary maps indicating a continuous brick store front within a largely wooden neighborhoodThe 1848 topographic map of Moscow and Moscow Uezd, edited by Lieutenant General Schubert, as reproduced in Pamyatniki arhitektury Moskvy.

Most of these building also housed inns and pubs for the coachmen; wooden coaches and flammable goods stored inside their spacious back yards contributed to accidental fires that regularly swept the sloboda.Kolodny, p. 227 Advent of railroads Rogozshkaya Sloboda (left) and railroad yards in Tagansky District by 1914. The southernmost cluster of train tracks marks the site of old Nizhny Novgorod terminal The 1861 opening of a railroad terminal connecting Moscow to Nizhny Novgorod spelled the end of the coachmen's business but boosted the Old Believers' community. Railroad owners placed the terminal east of Rogozhsky Val Street (then the eastern city limit of Moscow), right across the sloboda, to save on cost of land. In 1896 passenger terminal was relocated downtown to present-day Kursky railway terminal; freight yards on the site of the old terminal operated until the 1950s. According to opera tenor Pavel Bogatyryov, a native of Rogozhskaya Sloboda whose father owned a slaughterhouse and an inn with an underground blood sport pit,Kolodny, p. 229 the coachmen and associated innkeeping business agonized until a disastrous three-day fire in 1886.Kolodny, p. 228 The sloboda was rebuilt by different owners. In 1910 the city built an electrical substation for the sprawling tramway system on the corner of First Rogozhskaya and Bolshaya Andronyevskaya,Ivanov, chapter 5 the building stands to date. Trams serving the street ran through the parallel Voronya (later Tulinskaya, now Sergia Radonezskogo) Street, the old Vladimirka; in 1952, when service through Tulinskaya was shut down to make way for car traffic, tram tracks were relocated to Shkolnaya Street.Ivanov, chapter 13 Service through Shkolnaya was shut down in 1980;Ivanov, chapter 15 lines on adjacent Rogozhsky Val and Bolshaya Andronyevskaya operate to date (November 2009). First Rogozhskaya street was renamed Shkolnaya (literally School Street) in 1923; in the same year nearby Second Rogozhskaya became Bibliotechnaya (Library Street). The 2007 Streets of Moscow reference does not cite any particular reason for the rename apart from abstract \\"cultural change\\"., p. 580. Curiously, when Moscow city limits were expanded in 1960 and the city incorporated dozens of former independent towns and villages, the number of Shkolnaya Streets in the city exploded from one to eighteen (not including nine Shkolny Lanes); pp. 399-402. in the following two decades the number shrank back to one as the former villages were razed for new highrise housing. Reconstruction In the 1970s and 1980s most of Rogozhskaya Sloboda itself was demolished and replaced with concrete highrise. The westernmost blocks of Shkolnaya Street, too, disappeared to make way for a regional Sberbank office. The rest of Shkolnaya Street, however, was earmarked to become a refurbished pedestrian \\"historical zone\\", not unlike Arbat Street on a smaller scale. Reconstruction began in 1985 and continued until 1989. Two-storey buildings on both sides of the street received a facelift, with groundfloor windows and gates imitating 19th century shopping outlets; a look at the back of these houses reveals facadist rebuilding in concrete and modern masonry. The street, however, did not become a shopping attraction; the plan to open an ethnographic museum failed; the buildings on Shkolnaya are used for offices and on weekdays the \\"pedestrian\\" street is taken over by parked cars (transit traffic through Shkolnaya is physically blocked by concrete barriers but the street is accessible through side alleys). On weekends the eastern half of Shkolnaya Street becomes a marketplace. In 2007 the city issued a permit for Moscow‚Äôs first legitimate downtown flea market to be held there.Billing, Rebeccah (2007). Calling All Bargain Hunters.

Early years Starr's mother was from Kitsumkalum of the Eagle Clan, and his father was from Lax Kw'alaams, or the town of Port Simpson of the Killerwhale clan. His predominant family crest is the Eagle on his mother‚Äôs side, while his sub crest is the Killerwhale on his father‚Äôs. Alu'-Alums or 'Crying for or longing after something or someone' Starr was given this childhood name when he was six years old by the Chief of the Tribe when his grandfather died. Thla-enak or 'It's been a long time' - his adult name was given to him by the acting Chief when Starr returned to the village after a long absence. Career Subsequent to completing a college business course in 1982, Starr purchased two adzes and three knives, his first carving tools. Tim Paul of the Nuu-chah-nulth Nation and Richard Hunt of the Kwakwaka‚Äôwakw people were among the first to influence Starr on the basic techniques of carving wood. Their ancestral styles greatly influence the artwork that he creates today. In 1984, he sat and learned carving techniques from Richard Hunt, master Kwagiulth artist at Thunderbird Park and the Royal British Columbia Museum in Victoria, British Columbia. Starr is best known for his masks reflecting the traditional pigments and form lines of his ancestry. He usually paints only a portion of his masks to deliberately reveal the fluid grain of the wood. His pieces can be found in many local and international collections. For example, the Paul and Joan Gluck Collection of Native Arts contains more than 200 art pieces collected for more than 20 years and is considered one of the largest in the world. Starr was featured in an exhibit at one of the largest historical museums in the United States, the Historical Museum of Southern Florida.Historical Museum of Southern Florida website On two separate occasions Starr has been contracted to construct a full-scale replicas of a traditional Tsimshian bighouse. For both of these projects, he was responsible for hiring and training a crew of carvers. One was for the Canadian Museum of Civilization in Gatineau, Quebec, and the other was onsite at the Port Simpson village where he grew up.

This form of carbon sequestration occurs through increased rates of photosynthesis via land-use practices such as reforestation, sustainable forest management, and genetic engineering. Methods and practices exist to enhance soil carbon sequestration in both sectors of agriculture and forestry. Additionally, in the context of industrial energy production, strategies such as Bio-energy with Carbon Capture and Storage to absorb carbon dioxide emissions from coal, petroleum, or natural gas-fired electricity generation can utilize an alternative of algal bio sequestration (see algae bioreactor). Biosequestration as a natural process has occurred in the past, and was responsible for the formation of the extensive coal and oil deposits which are now being burned. It is a key policy concept in the climate change mitigation debate. p. 609 defines biosequestration as involving greenhouse gases in general. It does not generally refer to the sequestering of carbon dioxide in oceans (see carbon sequestration and ocean acidification) or rock formations (see geological sequestration), depleted oil or gas reservoirs (see oil depletion and peak oil), deep saline aquifers, or deep coal seams (see coal mining) (for all see geosequestration) or through the use of industrial chemical carbon dioxide scrubbing. Carbon sequestration in plants After water vapour (concentrations of which have limited influence by humans) carbon dioxide is the most abundant and stable greenhouse gas in the atmosphere (methane rapidly reacts to form water vapour and carbon dioxide). Atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased from about 280 ppm in 1750 to 383 ppm in 2007, now increasing at an average rate of 2 ppm pr year. The world's oceans have previously played an important role in sequestering atmospheric carbon dioxide through solubility and the photosynthesis by phytoplankton. Considering the adverse consequences of ocean acidification, global warming, and climate change on humanity, recent research and policy mechanisms have observed bio sequestration through plant growth. Reforestation, avoided deforestation and LULUCF Reforestation and reducing deforestation can increase biosequestration in four ways. Pandani (Richea pandanifolia) near Lake Dobson, Mount Field National Park, Tasmania, Australia The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) estimates that the cutting down of forests is now contributing close to 20 per cent of the overall greenhouse gases entering the atmosphere.Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change * The IPCC web site Candell and Raupach argue that there are four primary ways in which reforestation and reducing deforestation can increase biosequestration. First, by increasing the volume of existing forest. Second, by increasing the carbon density of existing forests at a stand and landscape scale. Third, by expanding the use of forest products that will sustainably replace fossil-fuel emissions. Fourth, by reducing carbon emissions that are caused from deforestation and degradation. Land clearing reductions, the majority of the time, create biodiversity benefits in a vast expanse of land regions. Concerns, however, arise when the density and area of vegetation increases the grazing pressure could also increase in other areas, causing land degradation.\\"An analysis of greenhouse gas mitigation and carbon biosequestration opportunities from rural land use\\" CSIROAugust 2009Website12/4/2013http://www.fcrn.org.uk/sites/default/files/prdz.pdf A recent report by the Australian CSIRO found that forestry and forest-related options are the most significant and most easily achieved carbon sink making up 105 Mt per year CO2-e or about 75 per cent of the total figure attainable for the Australian state of Queensland from 2010-2050. Among the forestry options, the CSIRO report announced, forestry with the primary aim of carbon storage (called carbon forestry) has the highest attainable carbon storage capacity (77 Mt CO2-e/yr) while strategy balanced with biodiversity plantings can return 7‚Äì12 times more native vegetation for a 10%‚Äì30% reduction of carbon storage performance.CSIRO Technical Report. Economic activity, resource use, environmental performance and living standards, 1970‚Äì2050. 5 November 2015. https://www.csiro.au/~/media/Major-initiatives/Australian-National- Outlook/CSIRO-TECHNICAL-REPORT- National_Outlook_2015-DOCX.docx?la=en&hash;=447E2F6885E954B3AB11FA73F157764DFD3F6AAB Legal strategies to encourage this form of biosequestration include permanent protection of forests in National Parks or on the World Heritage List, properly funded management and bans on use of rainforest timbers and inefficient uses such as woodchipping old growth forest. As a result of lobbying by the developing country caucus (or Group of 77) in the United Nations (associated with the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) in Rio de Janeiro, the non-legally binding Forest Principles were established in 1992. These linked the problem of deforestation to third world debt and inadequate technology transfer and stated that the \\"agreed full incremental cost of achieving benefits associated with forest conservation...should be equitably shared by the international community\\" (para1(b)).United Nations. Non-Legally Binding Authoritative Statement of Principles for a Global Consensus on the Management, Conservation and Sustainable Development of all Types of Forests. A/CONF.151/6/Rev1. United Nations, Rio de Janeiro. 1992. Subsequently, the Group of 77 argued in the 1995 Intergovernmental Panel on Forests (IPF) and then the 2001 Intergovernmental Forum on Forests (IFF), for affordable access to environmentally sound technologies without the stringency of intellectual property rights; while developed states there rejected demands for a forests fund. The expert group created under the United Nations Forum on Forests (UNFF) reported in 2004, but in 2007 developed nations again vetoed language in the principles of the final text which might confirm their legal responsibility under international law to supply finance and environmentally sound technologies to the developing world.United Nations. Non-Legally Binding Instrument on All Types of Forests. United Nations 22 Oct. 2007. A/C.2/62/L.5. In December 2007, after a two-year debate on a proposal from Papua New Guinea and Costa Rica, state parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (FCCC) agreed to explore ways of reducing emissions from deforestation and to enhance forest carbon stocks in developing nations.United Nations. 2007. Reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries: approaches to stimulate action. http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/cop_13/application/pdf/cp_redd.pdf accessed 10 November 2009. The underlying idea is that developing nations should be financially compensated if they succeed in reducing their levels of deforestation (through valuing the carbon that is stored in forests); a concept termed 'avoided deforestation (AD) or, REDD if broadened to include reducing forest degradation (see Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation). Under the free market model advocated by the countries who have formed the Coalition of Rainforest Nations, developing nations with rainforests would sell carbon sink credits under a free market system to Kyoto Protocol Annex I states who have exceeded their emissions allowance. Brazil (the state with the largest area of tropical rainforest) however, opposes including avoided deforestation in a carbon trading mechanism and instead favors creation of a multilateral development assistance fund created from donations by developed states. For REDD to be successful science and regulatory infrastructure related to forests will need to increase so nations may inventory all their forest carbon, show that they can control land use at the local level and prove that their emissions are declining. Rio Branco are seen here in the striking \\"herring bone\\" deforestation patterns that cut through the rainforest. NASA, 2008. NASA Earth Observatory, 2009. Deforestation in Malaysian Borneo. Subsequent to the initial donor nation response, the UN established REDD Plus, or REDD+, expanding the original program's scope to include increasing forest cover through both reforestation and the planting of new forest cover, as well as promoting sustainable forest resource management. The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Article 4(1)(a) requires all Parties to \\"develop, periodically update, publish and make available to the Conference of the Parties\\" as well as \\"national inventories of anthropogenic emissions by sources\\" \\"removals by sinks of all greenhouse gases not controlled by the Montreal Protocol.\\" Under the UNFCCC reporting guidelines, human-induced greenhouse emissions must be reported in six sectors: energy (including stationary energy and transport); industrial processes; solvent and other product use; agriculture; waste; and land use, land use change and forestry (LULUCF).Department of the Environment and Heritage (DEH) 2006, National Greenhouse Gas Inventory 2004: Accounting for the 108% Target, Commonwealth of Australia, Canberra. The rules governing accounting and reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from LULUCF under the Kyoto Protocol are contained in several decisions of the Conference of Parties under the UNFCCC and LULUCF has been the subject of two major reports by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC).IPCC.

The Kyoto Protocol article 3.3 thus requires mandatory LULUCF accounting for afforestation (no forest for last 50 years), reforestation (no forest on 31 December 1989) and deforestation, as well as (in the first commitment period) under article 3.4 voluntary accounting for cropland management, grazing land management, revegetation and forest management (if not already accounted under article 3.3). at p. 354 Continent of Australia from space. Australia is a major producer of fossil fuels and has significant problems with deforestation. Deforestation in Haiti. NASA, 2008. As an example, the Australian National Greenhouse Gas Inventory (NGGI) prepared in compliance with these requirements indicates that the energy sector accounts for 69 per cent of Australia‚Äôs emissions, agriculture 16 per cent and LULUCF six per cent. Since 1990, however, emissions from the energy sector have increased 35 per cent (stationary energy up 43% and transport up 23%). By comparison, emissions from LULUCF have fallen by 73%.Department of the Environment and Heritage (DEH) 2006, National Greenhouse Gas Inventory: Analysis of Recent Trends and Greenhouse Indicators 1990 to 2004, Commonwealth of Australia, Canberra. However, questions have been raised by Andrew Macintosh about the veracity of the estimates of emissions from the LULUCF sector because of discrepancies between the Australian Federal and Queensland Governments‚Äô land clearing data. Data published by the Statewide Landcover and Trees Study (SLATS) in Queensland, for example, show that the total amount of land clearing in Queensland identified under SLATS between 1989/90 and 2000/01 is approximately 50 per cent higher than the amount estimated by the Australian Federal Government‚Äôs National Carbon Accounting System (NCAS) between 1990 and 2001. Satellite imaging has become crucial in obtaining data on levels of deforestation and reforestation. Landsat satellite data, for example, has been used to map tropical deforestation as part of NASA‚Äôs Landsat Pathfinder Humid Tropical Deforestation Project, a collaborative effort among scientists from the University of Maryland, the University of New Hampshire, and NASA‚Äôs Goddard Space Flight Center. The project yielded deforestation maps for the Amazon Basin, Central Africa, and Southeast Asia for three periods in the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s.Earth Observatory.

Enhanced photosynthesis Sprekelia formosissima in Tasmania, Australia.Hakea epiglottis, Cape Raoul, Tasman Peninsula, Tasmania, Australia.Biosequestration may be enhanced by improving photosynthetic efficiency by modifying RuBisCO genes in plants to increase the catalytic and/or oxygenation activity of that enzyme. One such research area involves increasing the Earth's proportion of C4 carbon fixation photosynthetic plants. C4 plants represent about 5% of Earth's plant biomass and 1% of its known plant species, but account for around 30% of terrestrial carbon fixation. In leaves of C3 plants, captured photons of solar energy undergo photosynthesis which assimilates carbon into carbohydrates (triosephosphates) in the chloroplasts of the mesophyll cells. The primary CO2 fixation step is catalysed by ribulose-1,5-bisphosphate carboxylase/oxygenase (Rubisco) which reacts with O2 leading to photorespiration that protects photosynthesis from photoinhibition but wastes 50% of potentially fixed carbon. The C4 photosynthetic pathway, however, concentrates CO2 at the site of the reaction of Rubisco, thereby reducing the biosequestration-inhibiting photorespiration. A new frontier in crop science consists of attempts to genetically engineer C3 staple food crops (such as wheat, barley, soybeans, potatoes and rice) with the \\"turbo-charged\\" photosynthetic apparatus of C4 plants. Biochar Biochar (charcoal created through the pyrolysis of biomass) is a potent and stable form of biosequestration derived from investigation of the highly fertile Terra preta soils of the Amazon Basin. Placing biochar in soils also improves water quality, increases soil fertility, raises agricultural productivity, and reduces pressure on old growth forests. As a method of generating Bio-energy with Carbon Capture and Storage Rob Flanagan and the EPRIDA biochar company have developed low-tech cooking stoves for developing nations that can burn agricultural wastes, producing 15% by weight of biochar. BEST Energies in NSW Australia have spent a decade developing an Agrichar technology that can combust 96 tonnes of dry biomass each day, generating 30-40 tonnes of biochar. A parametric study of biosequestration by Malcolm Fowles at the Open University indicated that to mitigate global warming, policies should encourage displacement of coal with biomass for base load electricity generation if the latter‚Äôs conversion efficiency rose over 30%. Biosequestering carbon from biomass is a cheaper mitigation option than geosequestration in carbon capture and storage. Agricultural and farming practices No-till farming practices occur where, in the presence of mulching, ploughing is intentionally forgone as to maintain the sequestration of carbon-rich organic matter in soil. This practice prevents soil exposure to atmospheric oxygen, leaching, and erosion. Ceasing practice of ploughing has been alleged to encourage ant predation on wood- eating termites, allow weeds to regenerate soil, and help slow water flows over land. Shepherds with their sheep. The soil stores more terrestrial carbon than the summation of both the atmospheric and vegetative carbon sinks. The greatest density of this sequestered carbon lies under grassland.Fynn, A.J., P.

Carefully planned movements of large herds of livestock mimic the processes of nature where grazing animals are kept concentrated by pack predators and forced to move on after eating, trampling, and manuring an area, returning only after it has fully recovered. This grazing method seeks to emulate what occurred during the past 40 million years as the expansion of grass-grazer ecosystems built deep, rich grassland soils, sequestering carbon, and consequently cooling the planet. Panicum virgatum switchgrass, valuable in biofuel production, soil conservation and biosequestration Dedicated biofuel and biosequestration crops, such as switchgrass (panicum virgatum), are also being developed.Biotechnology Industry Organization (2007). Industrial Biotechnology Is Revolutionizing the Production of Ethanol Transportation Fuel pp. 3-4. This requires from 0.97 to 1.34 GJ fossil energy to produce 1 tonne of switchgrass, compared with 1.99 to 2.66 GJ to produce 1 tonne of corn. Given that switchgrass contains approximately 18.8 GJ/ODT of biomass, the energy output-to-input ratio for the crop can be up to 20:1. Biosequestration can also be enhanced by species selection to produce large numbers of phytoliths. Phytoliths are microscopic spherical shells of silicon that can store carbon for thousands of years. Biosequestration and climate change policy Biosequestration could be critical to climate change mitigation until cleaner forms of power generation are established. The Nesjavellir Geothermal Power Plant in √ûingvellir, Iceland Windturbines D4 (nearest) to D1 on the Thornton BankIndustries with large amounts of CO2 emissions (such as the coal industry) are interested in biosequestration as a means of offsetting their greenhouse gas production.Tom Fearon. Australia‚Äôs ‚Äòmassive advantage‚Äô in bio- sequestration. Environmental Management News. Monday, 3 August 2009 In Australia, university researchers are engineering algae to produce biofuels (hydrogen and biodiesel oils) and investigating whether this process can be used to biosequester carbon. Algae naturally capture sunlight and use its energy to split water into hydrogen, oxygen and oil which can be extracted. Such clean energy production also can be coupled with desalination using salt- tolerant marine algae to generate fresh water and electricity.Guy Healey. Pond life fuels bio research The Australian. July 23, 2008 Many new bioenergy (biofuel) technologies, including cellulosic ethanol biorefineries (using stems and branches of most plants including crop residues such as corn stalks, wheat straw and rice straw) are being promoted because they have the added advantage of biosequestration of CO2.International Energy Agency (2006). World Energy Outlook 2006 p. 8. The Garnaut Climate Change Review recommends that a carbon price in a carbon emission trading scheme could include a financial incentive for biosequestration processes. Garnaut recommends the use of algal biosequestration (see algae bioreactor) to absorb the constant stream of carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired electricity generation and metal smelting until renewable forms of energy, such as solar and wind power, become more established contributors to the grid. Garnaut, for example, states: \\"Some algal biosequestration processes could absorb emissions from coal-fired electricity generation and metals smelting.\\"Ross Garnaut. The Garnaut Climate Change Review. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge and Melbourne 2008 . p432 The United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries (UN-REDD Programme) is a collaboration between FAO, UNDP and UNEP under which a trust fund established in July 2008 allows donors to pool resources to generate the requisite transfer flow of resources to significantly reduce global emissions from deforestation and forest degradation.United Nations Collaborative Programme on Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries *Official UN-REDD Programme Website. The UK government's Stern Review on the economics of climate change argued that curbing deforestation was a \\"highly cost-effective way of reducing greenhouse gas emissions\\". James E. Hansen argues that, \\"An effective way to achieve drawdown [of carbon dioxide] would be to burn biofuels in power plants and capture the CO2, with the biofuels derived from agricultural or urban wastes or grown on degraded lands using little or no fossil fuel inputs.\\"James Hansen. Tell Barack Obama the Truth. accessed 1o Dec 2009. Such carbon dioxide drawdown systems are referred to as Bio-energy with carbon capture and storage, or BECCS. According to a study by Biorecro and the Global CCS Institute, there is currently (as of January 2012) 550 000 tonnes /year in total BECCS capacity operating, divided between three different facilities. Under a 2009 agreement, Loy Yang Power and MBD Energy Ltd will build a pilot Fossil fuel power plant at the Latrobe Valley power station in Australia using biosequestration technology in the form of an algal synthesiser system. Captured CO2 from the waste exhaust flue gases will be injected into circulating waste water to grow oil-rich algae where sunlight and nutrients will produce heavy oil-laden slurry that can make high grade oil for energy, or stock feed.MBD Energy Ltd. MBD captures Loy Yang Carbon Emissions. Eco Investor June 2009 accessed 28 Jan 2010. Other commercial demonstration projects involving biosequestration of CO2 at point of emission have begun in Australia. Philosophical basis of biosequestration The arguments for biosequestration are often shaped in terms of economic theory, yet there is a well-recognised quality of life dimension to this debate. Biosequestration assists human beings to increase their collective and individual contributions to the essential resources of the biosphere. The policy case for biosequestration overlaps with principles of ecology, sustainability and sustainable development, as well as biosphere, biodiversity and ecosystem protection, environmental ethics, climate ethics, and natural conservation. Barriers to increased global biosequestration Lassen National Park, Kings Creek, USA. The Garnaut Climate Change Review notes many barriers to increased global biosequestration. \\"There must be changes in the accounting regimes for greenhouse gases. Investments are required in research, development and commercialisation of superior approaches to biosequestration. Adjustments are required in the regulation of land use. New institutions will need to be developed to coordinate the interests in utilisation of biosequestration opportunities across small business in rural communities. Special efforts will be required to unlock potential in rural communities in developing countries.\\" Saddler and King have argued that biosequestration and agricultural greenhouse gas emissions should not be handled within a global emissions trading scheme because of difficulties with measuring such emissions, problems in controlling them and the burden that would be placed on numerous small-scale farming operations.Saddler H and King H. Agriculture and Emissions Trading: The Impossible Dream. Australia Institute Discussion Paper 102. Australia Institute, Canberra. 2008. Collett likewise maintains that REDD credits (post-facto payments to developing countries for reducing their deforestation rates below an historical or projected reference rate), simply create a complex market approach to this global public health problem that reduces transparency and accountability when targets are not met and will not be as effective as developed nations voluntarily funding countries to keep their rainforests. The World Rainforest Movement has argued that poor developing countries could be pressured to accept reforestation projects under the Kyoto Protocol's Clean Development Mechanism in order to earn foreign exchange simply to pay off the interest on debt to the World Bank.Lohmann L. The Carbon shop: Planting New Problems. Briefing paper, Plantations Campaign, World Rainforest Movement, Moreton-in- March (UK) and Montevideo (Uruguay). 1999. p3. Tensions also exist over forest management between the sovereignty claims of nations states, arguments about common heritage of mankind and the rights of indigenous peoples and local communities; the Forest Peoples Programme (FPP) arguing the anti-deforestation programs could merely allow financial benefits to flow to national treasuries, privilege would-be corporate forest degraders who manipulate the system by periodically threatening forests, rather than local communities who conserve them. The success of such projects will also depend on the accuracy of the baseline data and the number of countries involved. Further, it has been argued that if biosequestration is to play a significant role in mitigating anthropogenic climate change then coordinated policies should set a goal of achieving global forest cover to its extent prior to the industrial revolution in the 1800s. It has also been argued that the United Nations mechanism for Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation (REDD) may increase pressure to convert or modify other ecosystems, especially savannahs and wetlands, for food or biofuel, even though those ecosystems also have high carbon sequestration potential. Globally, for example, peatlands cover only 3% of the land surface but store twice the amount of carbon as all the world's forests, whilst mangrove forests and saltmarshes are examples of relatively low-biomass ecosystems with high levels of productivity and carbon sequestration. Other researchers have argued that REDD is a critical component of an effective global biosequestration strategy that could provide significant benefits, such as the conservation of biodiversity, particularly if it moves away from focusing on protecting forests that are most cost- effective for reducing carbon emissions (such as those in Brazil where agricultural opportunity costs are relatively low, unlike Asia, which has sizeable revenues from oil palm, rubber, rice, and maize). They argue REDD could be varied to allow funding of programs to slow peat degradation in Indonesia and target protection of biodiversity in \\"hot spot\\"‚Äîareas with high species richness and relatively little remaining forest. Some purchasers, they maintain, of REDD carbon credits, such as multinational corporations or nations, might pay a premium to save imperiled eco-systems or areas with high- profile species.

It was the second home ground of Yeovil Town Football Club, after the Pen Mill Athletic Ground which they left in 1920, until the club's departure for Huish Park in 1990. The ground was most famous for having an 8-foot side to side slope, and was the scene of one of the biggest FA Cup giant killings when Yeovil beat Sunderland in the fourth Round in 1949. The site is now occupied by the car park of a Tesco Extra hypermarket. History=Early years The club had initially made an approach at the end of the 1897‚Äì98 season, for the Huish field then owned by Brutton's Brewery, but this approach was unsuccessful. Negotiations continued before the First World War for a move to this more central location in the town, with the club at the time playing at a ground adjacent to Pen Mill station. The summer of 1920 saw Yeovil & Petters United leave the Pen Mill Athletic Ground, after the purchase of the land at Huish from the brewery for ¬£1,725; a covenant was placed on the deal that the brewery had first refusal to buy back the land at the original figure. The name for the ground was borrowed from the name of a suburb of the town, Huish, from the Old English hiwisc meaning a group of houses, or a household. The new ground, at the west end of the town centre, saw its first competitive game on 28 August 1920 when the reserve team played Christchurch in the Dorset League: an attendance of 1,500 witnessed Yeovil & Petters United win 5‚Äì0. Initially the terraces were flat with the only covered accommodation in the form of a 300-seater stand that had been brought from Pen Mill; that stand was soon extended, to include dressing rooms costing ¬£733 and additional capacity, and remained in place until 1963. During the summer of 1923, tennis courts were marked out on the pitch and hired out at ¬£2 per court for the summer season. Also that summer, 750 loads of earth were brought to the ground by Bartletts Ltd. to form a terrace at the Queen Street end of the ground and the pitch was lengthened by four yards at a cost of ¬£15. In October and November, a further 100 tons of materials were given by Westlands and hauled to the ground at a cost of ¬£9 and the Club opened negotiations with the Southern Railway Company to purchase 1,000 railway sleepers, at a cost of ¬£50, to add steps to the terraces. In 1924 the Supporters Club was formed and three tea huts were purchased and installed at Huish, and on 15 November 1924, Yeovil played their first game against a Football League team in the FA Cup, beating Bournemouth and Boscombe 3‚Äì2 at Huish before a crowd of 5,500. Before the next round home tie against Bristol Rovers, additional terracing was added at the Bruttons End and toilets were installed. In October 1926 the club acquired a lighting set on extended loan from Petters United, which enabled training to take place at night on the pitch and, a month later, the covered accommodation over the terraces at the Queen Street end was opened. Greyhound racing took place around the pitch as early as 12 May 1928. The independent racing (unaffiliated to a governing body) was intermittent and organised by the Yeovil Football and Athletic Club Ltd. It is believed that the racing stopped before 1950 but was taking place in 1946. In 1931 the club acquired the freehold of the land from Brutton's Brewery and purchased further land at the end of the ground to increase accommodation. A substantial amount of money was loaned to the club at a nominal rate of interest for the period that football was played at Huish to fund the purchase, and fans were asked to play their part in wiping off the balance. The next development of Huish came in the 1934‚Äì35 season when Yeovil reached the third round of the FA Cup for the first time and were drawn against Liverpool. In the two weeks between the time of the draw and the game being played, a small stand was built in the corner at the Queen Street end to hold 100 people at a cost of ¬£250. The stand acted as the director's box and boardroom until the new main stand was built, and remained in place until 1983. At a board meeting on 7 February 1938, the first of many plans to level the pitch was discussed, but the practicality and the cost of such a scheme made this impossible. The ground's slope became infamous with the pitch sloped six feet along the halfway line and eight feet from corner to corner. On 12 January 1939, during a FA Cup third round replay against Sheffield Wednesday the game saw a new record crowd of 14,329 pack into Huish with thousands more locked outside the ground. After the game got under way, the weight of the hordes of supporters who had climbed onto the roof of the Queen Street end caused the roof to split from one end to the other but the spectators were safely removed. That same month a loudspeaker system was purchased for ¬£10 and in July the same year a quotation for ¬£514 was received to build a retaining wall and to provide a concrete terrace at the Bruttons end; costs, however, stopped this project. The last game at Huish before the ground was closed due to the Second World War was against Lovell's Athletic resulting in a 3‚Äì2 win for Yeovil on 27 January 1940. During the war Huish was, at first, used by the War Office as an ammunitions store and then by the United States Army, who offered to level the pitch if they could use the ground to play baseball, but their offer was not taken up. Post-war expansion Competitive football returned to Huish on 25 August 1945, when Swindon Town Reserves ran out 3‚Äì0 winners. The ground's most famous moment came on 29 January 1949, when Huish hosted Yeovil's greatest giant-killing as the then Southern League upset 'Bank of England' side Sunderland in the fourth round of the FA Cup. Over 35,000 applications for tickets were received but the ground could only hold half that number. A total of 17,123 spectators crammed into Huish, the largest attendance at the ground. The gates were opened at 12 noon, the main queue was six deep and over half a mile long. The final score Yeovil 2‚Äì1 Sunderland, shocked the whole football world, however, the game was almost stopped due to fog and a pitch invasion three minutes from time when the crowd thought that the referee had blown the final whistle. Five thousand jubilant fans invaded the pitch but they responded to the pleas from the players and moved back onto the terraces, and the game was concluded. An extensive ground improvement scheme was then begun in 1949. Over the next five years the top bank of clinkers, earth and railway sleepers was removed and a concrete terrace was installed. This work continued at Bruttons End. The covering at the Queen Street end was removed and that terrace was then concreted. The final part of this project was to cover the North Terrace. The cost of these extensive works was in excess of ¬£5,000, and to raise this money an appeal was made to the traders of the town and a special fund, known as the Ground Development Fund, was instituted. In 1954 a wall was built in front of the North Terrace and floodlights were installed at the ground. The first match under the lights was a friendly game against Tottenham Hotspur, on 8 March 1955: Yeovil won the match 2‚Äì0 before a crowd of 4,031. The first competitive game under the floodlights was against Bath City, on 23 March 1955. The final game of that season at Huish saw Yeovil draw 2‚Äì2 against Hastings United to win their first Southern League Championship. In 1956 further work on the North Terrace was completed when the back of the stand was closed in. The next major development of Huish took place in the summer of 1963 when the new stand was built, as the original Pen Mill stand was demolished. Plans were drawn up by James E. Fox and in March 1963 work commenced when first a tea hut and then the stand was demolished. By the first week in May building work was under way, and at the start of the 1963‚Äì64 season the dressing rooms had been completed and the stand was open but the rest of the facilities were still under construction. The new 2,000 seater Main Stand was finally completed just in time for an FA Cup tie with Crystal Palace, on 7 December 1963, when the Social Club was opened. The new stand, which had cost ¬£60,000 to build, gave the club new dressing rooms, an upstairs boardroom, and a long bar for supporters to drink in, where the club held dances and bingo nights. The bar soon became one of the hubs of the town, with the ground being on the west end of the town centre, and the additional income began to give the club payback for that investment. In the late 1960s plans were drawn up for the Yeovil inner relief road, with one plan showing the road running right through the middle of the Huish pitch. When the road was eventually built only one very small area of land, at the Queen Street end, was lost. In July 1969 after months of negotiations the Deed of Covenant was released to the Club. In the summer of 1970 a Pop Festival was organised at Huish but the event was a flop and a loss of ¬£470 was made. At the start of the seventies, scenes reminiscent of 1949 against Sunderland returned once again to Huish when Yeovil were drawn at home to Arsenal in the third round of the FA Cup. Admission charges were raised from 4s 6d to 15s for the terraces and from 6s 6d. to 30s for the stand. A wall was built in front of the main stand forming an enclosure to accommodate part of the crowd of 14,500. The big day did not arrive though, as on 2 January 1971 the game was postponed because there was a blanket of snow four inches deep on the pitch. The game was played the following Wednesday afternoon, Arsenal winning 3‚Äì0. At a Board meeting held in November 1972, the Directors once again discussed the possibility of levelling the Huish pitch; the cost would have been in the region of ¬£17,000. The following month the club received an offer of ¬£260,000 for the purchase of Huish. The second half of the 1976‚Äì77 season saw European football come to Huish when Yeovil entertained Turris and then Bari in the Anglo Italian Semi Professional Tournament, with Yeovil travelling to Italy later that summer to play two further games in the tournament. Departure and destruction Tesco Extra hypermarket is located on the site where Huish used to be. The slope that the club had refused to level during the War was by the 1980s one of the barriers to promotion to the Football League. The last decade of the ground saw the club spend over ¬£200,000 in the interest of crowd safety: the main stand underwent major surgery with the introduction of staircases and fire proofing while the terraces saw the introduction of crash barriers and segregation areas and, in the last season at Huish, the purchase of a closed circuit television system, at a cost of ¬£15,000, to assist police in crowd surveillance. Furthermore, the Main stand was starting to develop rust in its supports that gave the club the dilemma of whether to pay the high maintenance costs of keeping Huish alive, or sell up and move to another site. Gradual safety restrictions had pulled the official ground capacity down to around 10,000 in its later years. The last capacity attendance came in January 1988, when Queens Park Rangers visited for an FA Cup third round match and 9,717 spectators watched a 0‚Äì3 defeat against the First Division side. On 4 March 1985 the club opened negotiations with Bartlett Construction Limited with a view to selling Huish and moving to a new stadium at Houndstone. At that stage a value of ¬£680,000 was placed upon Huish, which, over several years of negotiations rose to a final figure of ¬£2.8m. Initially it was hoped that the building of a new stadium would commence in April 1986 but the results of a public inquiry which was held in September 1987 were not made known until February 1989. On 21 March 1989, the club finally got planning permission for an out-of-town stadium, on land previously used by the Houndstone Army Camp, and just over a year later, a home match against Telford United on 5 May 1990 marked the end of seventy years of football at Huish. The bulldozers moved in and the site became part of a Tesco supermarket, while Yeovil Town moved out to Houndstone, with the old ground's name partially retained in its Huish Park moniker. For several years after, a weathercock on top of the Tesco building's clock tower showed a metal design with small figures of footballers; this is now located on top of the scoreboard above the Copse Road Terrace at Huish Park. Some items from Huish were transferred to other grounds, such as the turnstiles which ended up at Exmouth Town, but the majority of it ended up as rubble.

Career  Martin Krippner was the eldest son of Johannes Krippner, a blacksmith, and his wife, Anna Pallier. Martin received a better education than many of his social contemporaries and studied law at Prague University. In 1842 he obtained a commission in the Habsburg army and rose to the rank of captain. Whilst stationed at Frankfurt in Germany he met Emily Longdill, a well-educated Englishwoman. They married on 12 May 1851 and had four children. Martin resigned his military commission in 1859. Emily Krippner's brother, Pynson Wilmot Longdill, had settled in New Zealand and it is believed that he encouraged the Krippners to emigrate there. The Krippner family arrived in Auckland on 22 March 1860 with Martin's brother Johannes (Hans) Krippner (and his future wife, Elizabeth Turnwald); and also the Pankratz and Scheidler families, also from Habsburg Bohemia. Martin Krippner was naturalised a British citizen on 10 April 1860 and initially settled at Orewa, where he was postmaster from August 1861 until October 1863. Krippner was not a successful farmer himself but he was very keen about New Zealand's prospects and was on good terms with Governor-General of New Zealand Sir George Grey. Krippner soon thought up a project to help landless peasants back home in Bohemia and obtained permission from the Auckland provincial government to arrange a Bohemian colony at Puhoi. He then wrote to his brothers, still in Bohemia, promising of free land for each adult immigrant with a further for each child over five years of age. The concept appealed immediately to entrepreneurial peasants from Krippner's native Mantau region. On 27 June 1863, 83 immigrants, including Martin's brother Michael Krippner, arrived at Auckland. They were transported to the mouth of the Puhoi River and taken upstream in MƒÅori canoes to the site chosen by Krippner. The central European immigrants were initially appalled by the primitive state of the entirely undeveloped land, thick with native bush. Plots were allocated and the peasants started clearing the bush. Krippner served as translator for the community for a long time and as such exercised quite a lot of influence. Soon after their arrival Krippner persuaded some of the men to join the Third Regiment of the Waikato Militia. Krippner was himself offered a commission as captain if he could get 50 men to enlist and the commission was granted on 17 October 1863. In 1864 Krippner and his Bohemian men guarded MƒÅori prisoners being held in Auckland and at the conclusion of the war, some of the Bohemians accepted grants of land at Ohaupo in the Waikato Region. Krippner also received a land grant there but did not settle on it. Krippner encouraged further Bohemian immigration in the hope that the colonial regime would reward him. Consequently, in 1866 a second group of Bohemians arrived and in 1873 a third and final bunch. Although Krippner lived at Orewa he kept a strong proprietorial interest in Puhoi and utilised his government contacts to secure money for roadworks in the area: this helped provide employment and immediate cash for the newcomers. Krippner often thought up additional economic sources of income: at his suggestion the Puhoi colonists gathered tanekaha (celery pine) bark for tanning and fungus for the Chinese export market. In 1869 Emily Krippner started a school at Puhoi and by 1873 the Puhoi Educational District was legally constituted. Due to his fluency in both English and the German Egerlander dialect of the Bohemian settlers, Martin Krippner was appointed headmaster and Emily Krippner was made assistant teacher. Martin Krippner was postmaster at Silverdale from 1 July 1873 until 31 December 1874 and whilst in Puhoi held various offices. He was chairman of the Puhoi Highway District Board in 1874, and in 1877 and 1878 served on the Rodney County Council. A post office had been established at Puhoi in 1870 and Krippner was postmaster from 1 August 1875 until 30 June 1884. By the early 1880s the Puhoi settlement was securely established and the confident settlers were more able to communicate their criticisms of Krippner's leadership. It became obvious that the Krippners, both in their 60s, were no longer capable of adequately performing their teaching duties and in 1884 the school committee petitioned to have them removed. Retirement and death The Puhoi Bohemians showed their gratitude to Krippner by building a new house for him at Warkworth. Emily Krippner died there on 15 December 1890; Martin Krippner on 31 January 1894.

To avoid vignetting, a photographer using a view camera must ensure that the area remains within the image circle (Adams 1980, 56‚Äì57; 151‚Äì52; 157‚Äì61); a tilt/shift lens or perspective-control lens used on a small- or medium-format camera usually has mechanical limitations that keep the frame area within the image circle.

The Hausa name for the ethnic group is also Damakawa. Classification Based on such a small amount of data of uncertain reliability, it is hard to classify Damakawa precisely. It is probably best placed in the Northwest Kainji branch of Benue‚ÄìCongo. The words that have been collected show similarities with both C'Lela and Kambari languages, and it may be that the Kambari words are loans or mis-rememberings. Alternative names The nearby Cicipu speakers call the Damakawa language 'Tidama'un'. In the trade language Hausa the expected name for the language would be Damakanci, given the people are called Damakawa. However Damakawa seems to be preferred by the Damakawa themselves, as far as can be ascertained.

When the Communists took over, they deposed him, not killing him so as not to make him a martyr in the people's eyes.

It is notable for being one of the few titles by Toaplan that has not received any official port to home consoles as of date. In the game, players assume the role of professional wrestlers fighting against the Mad Bull Group organization to protect wrestling from corruption. Knuckle Bash was created by most of the same staff that previously worked on several projects at Toaplan and who would later go on to work at one of its offshoots after the company declared bankruptcy in 1994. The team were originally commissioned on making a fighting game similar to Capcom's Street Fighter II: The World Warrior but the project deviated from its original plan and became a beat 'em up title instead. As of 2019, the rights to the title are owned by Tatsujin, a company founded in 2017 by former Toaplan member Masahiro Yuge and now-affiliate of Japanese arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia alongside many other Toaplan IPs.  Gameplay  Gameplay screenshot. Knuckle Bash is a side-scrolling beat 'em up game similar to Final Fight and Double Dragon, where players take control of one of the available playable characters across ten stages, each one set in a different location, and fight against an assortment of enemies and villains in order to defeat the Mad Bull Group organization.Knuckle Bash universal kit installation instructions (Arcade, US) At the beginning, players choose between one of two scenarios, both of which host their own set of stages and clearing certain scenarios unlocks an extra playable character. Unlike other titles in the same genre, the stages in the game chiefly consist of various waves of single or few strong boss-like enemies, instead of the typical long series of weaker enemies with a boss at the end of the stage. It also completely lacks weapons or objects of any sort. Similar to Streets of Rage 2, each character has a special attack of their own that deals damage to any enemy on-screen. Players can compete in a minigame reminiscent of Mortal Kombat's \\"Test Your Might\\" segments between stages.  Synopsis = Plot  The story of Knuckle Bash revolves around the Mad Bull Group, a corrupt wrestling organization that profits and taints the reputation of the sport, whose wrestlers are upon by children as role models. Three former members of the Mad Bull Group who deserted from the organization due to their actions and labeled as traitors arranged a secret meeting at a Chicago hotel in order to contact a skillful \\"Ninpow\\" master, who is also wanted by the Mad Bull Group. On their journey, the wrestlers venture into the Battle Kingdom headquarters, where another Mad Bull Group plans to desert from the organization because of their actions. After facing multiple battle against members of the Mad Bull Group, the wrestlers manage to dismantle the organization and their victorious story was widespread thereafter.  Characters  Players initially choose from three characters at the start, while two extra characters are recruited through gameplay and any of the five characters can be switched to between missions: *El Plancha ‚Äì A luchador. *Michael Sobut ‚Äì An Elvis Presley look- alike. *Jack Brow ‚Äì A street fighter. *Mr. Hayate ‚Äì A ninja master of the \\"Ninpow\\" art. *Captain ‚Äì An american football player who defects from the Mad Bull Group.  Development and release  Knuckle Bash was created by most of the same staff that previously worked on several projects at Toaplan and who would later go on to work at one of its offshoots after the company declared bankruptcy in 1994. (Translation by Gamengai. ). (Translation by Gamengai. ). (Translation by Shmuplations. ). Mangaka Junya Inoue acted as designer in the project, while the soundtrack was co-composed by Masahiro Yuge and Osamu ≈åta. According to Inoue, the game was also designed by Nanpei Kaneko, a member who previously worked on FixEight before quitting Toaplan and working as illustrator for Japanese magazines. Between 2009 and 2012 through Japanese publications such as Shooting Gameside, former Toaplan composer Tatsuya Uemura recounted the project's development process and history, stating that the team were originally commissioned by the company on making a fighting game similar to Street Fighter II: The World Warrior, however the project deviated from its original plan and became a beat 'em up title instead, although Uemura claimed he had no involvement during its development. Knuckle Bash was released in arcades worldwide by Toaplan and Atari Games in 1993. On 27 June 2018, an album containing music from the title and other Toaplan games was published exclusively in Japan by City Connection under their Clarice Disk label. Prior to launch, it was first showcased to the public at the 1993 AOU Show. As of March 2014, it has not received a conversion to home consoles.  Reception and legacy  Maurizio Miccoli of Italian magazine Computer+Videogiochi noted its combination of Final Fight-style gameplay and wrestling thematic. Nick Zverloff of Hardcore Gaming 101 stated that Knuckle Bash \\"might not be fantastic, but it gets by on being an average beat em up that is just ridiculous enough to make it enjoyable\\". Retro Gamers Nick Thorpe gave it a mixed outlook. Wireframe regarded it as \\"a rare foray into brawler territory\\" for Toaplan. A year after the game's launch, Inoue would later join Gazelle; one of Toaplan's offshoots after the company declared bankruptcy in 1994 and act as graphic artist for 1995's Pretty Soldier Sailor Moon, which was based upon Naoko Takeuchi's Sailor Moon sh≈çjo manga and anime series. A bootleg version of the game titled Knuckle Bash 2 was released in 1999, featuring many changes compared to the original release. In more recent years, the rights to the title and many other IPs from Toaplan are now owned by Tatsujin, a company named after Truxton's Japanese title that was founded in 2017 by Yuge, who are now affiliated with arcade manufacturer exA-Arcadia.

The dichroscope has been used since at least the start of the nineteenth century.

It was known as the State Public Library of the city of Santander, although on March 23, 1999, it was declared by decree as the Cantabria Central Library of Cantabria. History The State Public Library began as a school library when in 1839 it was created for the Instituto C√°ntabro para la Ense√±anza de N√°utica y del Comercio. Five years later, during the first change of name of the institute, the Provincial Library was established with funding for the lessons that were taught in the educational institution. It received content from the libraries of the convents of Santa Clara, Santa Catalina de Monte Corb√°n and San Francisco Santander and some important books from the Las Caldas del Besaya monastery. Later, the collection increased with subsidies for the purchase of books given to the Provincial Council, and donations from individuals. The Provincial Library was incorporated into Corps Archivists and Librarians in August 1898. When the library passed to the Corps Archivists and Librarians it had less than 5000 volumes; by 1960 it had 25,000. In 1960 under the agreement signed between the Municipality of Santander and the Ministry of Education, the library was merged with the City Library of Santander, moving their funds and services to the premises of this. Both libraries have served since then working in unison, sharing premises, services, personnel, etc. Since 23 March 1999, the State Public Library in Santander was declared by decree Cantabria Central Library and the official main library of Cantabria. In 2009 funds, furniture and workers moving to the building of the former General Deposit in Branch Snuff Tobacco, in an area rehabilitated by the Ministry of Culture, at the Ruiz de Alda street in an area near the port of Santander. On August 3, units of the Central Library in the Gravina road closed its doors. The new building was inaugurated on December 16 with the presence of the authorities of the region and the Minister of Culture Angeles Gonzalez-Sinde, opening its doors on January 11, 2010. Building In 1900, it was built on the sands of Malia√±o dock in the port area of Santander, the building now houses the BCC. Built on an area of 12,000 square meters and it was neo-Mudejar. Its proximity to the port facilitated the transport and storage, with half of the snuff imported into Spain was received and stored in the warehouse, distributed by coasting vessels, rail or road to the national eleven factories Tabacalera. During the civil war, there was a hiatus, turned into a prison for republican prisoners. After this period resumed its original use as a warehouse until 1986. The rehabilitation of the property is an example of industrial architecture reused to house a cultural institution and the architects in charge of the project were Alejano Eduardo de la Torre, Luciano Moreno Feu and Ricardo Miguel A. Aguilar, being the project coordinator Manuel Mart√≠n-Rabadan Caballero. Mission and functions BCC's mission is to promote reading, training, research and collect, catalog, store and disseminate bibliographic heritage and print production, sound and visual of Cantabria or make reference to it. Cantabria Central Library / State Public Library in Santander has a dual function: #It Cantabria Central Library, so it is at the head of the Library System of Cantabria. #State Public Library is, therefore, exercising the functions designated by the Regulations of the State Public Library System and Library Spanish.

Morales (born December 7, 1963) is a former freestyle BMX rider turned promoter, designer, inventor and business executive. He is the founder of DYNO Bicycles, the American Freestyle Association (AFA), Auburn Cycles, KORE Bicycle Components, Morales Bicycle Co., Carlsbad Motocross Racing (CMXR) and ASV Inventions. He is currently president and CEO of ASV Inventions, Inc.  History  Morales began riding motorcycles at the age of 7, then racing motorcycles at the age of 11. His father bought him a Yamaha YZ 80 to compete in motorcycle races. He won over 20 dirt biking trophies by 1976. He took up BMX bike racing at the age of 13 when his parents could no longer support his motorcycle racing because of a divorce. Around 1977, he got into BMX racing by competing in a local BMX race where he met fellow racer R.L. Osborn and they became good friends. R.L. Osborn's father was the founder of BMX Action magazine and became a pioneer in the sport of BMX and Freestyle BMX. Through the Osborns he met Bob Haro who would later pioneer the sport of Freestyle BMX. At age 14 Morales started his first business and named it BME which stood for Bob Morales Enterprises. BME sold BMX brand stickers and apparel as a vendor at BMX tracks and through mail order advertisements in BMX magazines. BME eventually became DYNO Design in 1983. In 1980 Bob Haro asked Morales to join him on a national tour to promote the new sport of Freestyle BMX. They traveled on tour together performing shows all over the Midwest, Eastern United States, and parts of Canada to enthusiastic crowds. In 1982 Morales began promoting Freestyle BMX competitions and formed the Amateur Skate Park Association (ASPA), which would later become the American Freestyle Association (AFA), to promote events in this fast-growing sport. At its peak in 1986 the AFA hosted a BMX Freestyle competition at Madison Square Garden in New York City with over 5,000 spectators and a large cash purse for the competitors. Morales joined friend and fellow freestyle rider Eddie Fiola and formed the founding BMX Freestyle teams for Haro Bikes (1980), Kuwahara (bicycle company) (1982), and GT Bicycles (1983). In 1982, Oakley, Inc. founder Jim Jannard asked Morales and Fiola to perform at the AMA Supercross at Anaheim Stadium in front of 40,000 spectators. Jannard also invited Morales & Fiola to perform at an Oakley, Inc. \\"Factory Pilot Nite\\", an exclusive Oakley athlete party at Oakley, Inc. headquarters which were located in Lake Forest at that time. Jannard and his company Oakley, Inc. have been a lifelong inspiration for Morales and his product designs. Morales stopped riding professionally in 1985 to concentrate on his two businesses: the American Freestyle Association (AFA) and DYNO Design which has made BMX accessories since 1983. In 1985 he sold DYNO Design (which later became DYNO Bicycles) to GT Bicycles and went to work for them as a designer. He was awarded his first patent while working at GT Bicycles for a bicycle frame design. Also in 1985 Morales appeared in the first action-sports themed television commercial for Mountain Dew soda with fellow pro freestyle BMX riders Eddie Fiola, R.L. Osborn, Ron Wilkerson and Pat Romano. Later that year Morales became a member of the Screen Actors Guild (SAG) and pursued a career in commercial acting appearing in several national commercials. Morales founded Mor Distributing in 1985 and brought in partner Todd Huffman in 1986. Mor Distributing started out as a distributor of bicycles and parts for other companies like DYNO. In 1988 Morales and Huffman created their own brands including Auburn Cycles using a unique two-piece frame design by Morales. Scootster brand scooters were also created under Mor Distributing to compete in the fast-growing scooter segment of the bicycle market at that time. They later sold the Auburn brand to GT Bicycles in 1992. GT went on to market and sell Auburn bicycles for many years. Morales formed Group B Design in 1989 to provide product and advertising design to the bicycle industry. Group B clients included HUTCH Bicycles, Iron Horse Bicycles, and Western Auto. Another patent was awarded to Morales for a bicycle frame design called the \\"A Frame\\" for Iron Horse Bicycles. Morales is credited with building the Iron Horse brand of bicycles into an internationally recognized brand. KORE Bicycle Components was founded by Morales in 1988 and he was awarded three more patents for bicycle part designs for BMX and Mountain Bikes. In 1993 several financial partners had joined KORE. In 1993 Morales formed the MORALES Bicycle Company to market and distribute bicycle frame designs that he had created for the BMX and Mountain Bike markets. Morales sold his interest in KORE to his partners in 1998. He retained ownership rights of Morales Bicycle Co. Later in 1998 he began promoting motocross races at the legendary Carlsbad Raceway and formed a racing club called CMXR (Carlsbad Motocross Racing). In early 2000 Morales founded ASV Inventions, Inc. to develop, market and distribute his inventions. ASV developed into a leading brand of motorcycle parts and accessories and Morales had been awarded several more patents for products marketed under the ASV brand. In late 2007 ASV Inventions acquired Universal Engineering, Inc. a brand of motocross parts and accessories. In 2011 Morales introduced his family to BMX racing at one of the local BMX tracks that he had raced at as a youth. Morales' middle son Dane Morales took well to racing bicycles and went on to achieve success in BMX racing on a national and international level. Morales' involvement with his young son's racing inspired him to begin designing BMX racing products for young BMX racers. In 2013 Morales re- established his former bicycle brand Auburn Cycles with the introduction of an American made BMX mini racing frame designed specifically for his son Dane to race and develop. On September 8th 2018, Morales was inducted into the National BMX Hall of Fame in a ceremony at the Olympic training center in Chula Vista, CA. Morales was inducted for his contributions to the BMX bicycle industry. Personal life Morales married Marry Sorensen on March 3, 2002. They have three sons, Maximilian, Dane & Jackson Morales. Jackson and Dane Morales race motorcycles.

She was lecturer in design at the Open University and also lectured and taught at the Department of Architecture at the University of Cambridge. Life Cooke was born in Bishop's Stortford on 2 August 1942, the only child of a brigadier in the Royal Engineers. She trained as an architect between 1961-7 at the Department of Architecture at the University of Cambridge, where she was one of a handful of women students in her year. After a short spell in architectural practice in Helsinki, notably not at the office of the Finnish architect Alvar Aalto as her father wanted, and then at Casson Condor in London, she returned to Cambridge to undertake her Ph.D. on Soviet Town Planning, which she completed in 1975. Since then, Cooke‚Äôs interests broadened to cover all aspects of Soviet avant-garde design and Soviet architecture and town planning, and particularly Russian Constructivist architecture. She wrote, was an editor and lectured extensively on these subjects. Her editorial involvement with the Architectural Design magazine published by Academy Books led to a number of publications on Russian architects and designers such as Chernikhov. Particularly well known are her publications on the Russian Avante-Garde and Constructivism in the post 1917 era. A fluent Russian speaker, Cooke was significantly instrumental in raising awareness in the West both about Russian visual culture and the sorry plight of a number of Soviet buildings, which she did through her UK chairmanship of Docomomo (the international working party for the documentation and conservation of buildings, sites and neighbourhoods of the Modern Movement). Cooke amassed a significant collection of books, posters, and ephemera over the course of her working life. The Catherine Cooke collection is now housed in Cambridge University Library. 05.07.12. In July 2012, an exhibition of items from the collection was opened in the library's public exhibition centre. 05.07.12.

The single example built was serving with the Royal Naval Air Service at the start of World War I. Design and development The H.R.E.2 was the second aircraft designed by the Royal Aircraft Factory under its Reconnaissance Experimental designation. This team was headed by Chief Engineer Fred Green, but details were by John Kenworthy, who had designed the derivatives of the B.E.3, The H stood for hydroplane (sea- or float plane), for the specification came from the Air Department of the Admiralty for the Naval Wing of the R.F.C.Flight 15 October 1954 p.575-6 It was a two-bay biplane with staggered wings of equal span and equal, constant chord. Lateral control was by wing warping. The fuselage was flat sided with a deep, rounded decking similar to that of the earlier R.E.1, though the front cockpit was much longer and more open-sided in the later aircraft. The pilot sat behind, just aft of the wing trailing edge; there was no cut-out for visibility. The elevator and tailplane were both single-piece surfaces. Though it was intended as a floatplane powered by a 100 hp (75 kW) 12-cylinder Renault engine, it initially flew as a landplane with the smaller 70 hp Renault air-cooled upright V-8 as used in the R.E.1. In this configuration the rudder was mounted above and clear of the tail plane, leaving room for the one piece elevators and having the same shape, roughly a flattened oval with its long axis parallel with the fuselage, as that of the B.E.3. The landplane version was often referred to as the R.E.2. The floats of the H.R.E.2 were fitted at the same time as the more powerful engine. They were typical of the time: a pair of main short floats were mounted to the fuselage by two pairs of struts, those at the front sloping back to around the engine bulkhead and the aft pair running vertically to the point where the front wing spar joined the fuselage. The aircraft sat tail down in the water, the rear supported by a third small double float. A triangular fin was fitted and a new teardrop-shaped rudder, cropped at the bottom, mounted on it. The elevator hinge was near the trailing edge of the rudder, giving the elevator clearance to move. The fin and rudder design was essentially repeated on the later R.E.3. The aircraft was seriously damaged in an attempted take off from Frensham Pond and then rebuilt as a landplane once again, fitted with ailerons rather than wing warping. It kept the revised fin and rudder and had a two-wheeled, single-axle undercarriage mounted on two longitudinal members that projected forwards to form \\"hockey stick\\" anti-nose-over skids like those of the B.E.1. In this form it served with the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) as aircraft no.17 and was still in service at the start of World War I. It was wrecked in a crash on 10 February 1915.

Controversy over EPA report prepared by Carlin Carlin is best known for a controversy that arose in June 2009, over the alleged suppression of a report Carlin and a coworker wrote opposing the EPA's Proposed Endangerment Finding for greenhouse gases. In June 2009, the Competitive Enterprise Institute, a Washington D.C. based think tank, and Senator James Inhofe (R-Oklahoma) claimed that the EPA had suppressed a report authored by Alan Carlin, that cast doubt on the existence of global warming and the need to regulate CO2 emissions. Senator Inhofe wrote a letter to the EPA Administrator, Lisa Jackson, requesting that the agency reopen this matter and called for a congressional investigation of the suppression.Berger, Judson. \\"GOP senator calls for inquiry on suppressed climate change report\\", ‚Äúfoxnews.com‚Äù, June 29, 2009.Benin, Steve. ‚ÄúInhoff‚Äôs new conspiracy‚Äù , ‚ÄúWashingtonMonthly.com‚Äù, June 29, 2009. The EPA Press Secretary Adora Andy, responded: \\"Claims that this individual‚Äôs opinions were not considered or studied are entirely false. . . . The individual in question is not a scientist and was not part of the working group dealing with this issue. Nevertheless the document he submitted was reviewed by his peers and agency scientists, and information from that report was submitted by his manager to those responsible for developing the proposed endangerment finding. In fact, some ideas from that document are included and addressed in the endangerment finding. Additionally, his manager has allowed his general views on the subject of climate change to be heard and considered inside and outside the EPA and presented at conferences and at an agency seminar. And this individual was granted a request to join a committee that organizes an ongoing climate seminar series, open to both agency and outside experts, where he has been able to invite speakers with a full range of views on climate science.\\"\\"CEI- Says-EPA-Censored-Warming-Study-Agency-Responds\\",Environmental Protection On Line, June 29, 2009.

After receiving Carlin‚Äôs comments, McGartland told him that he would not forward them to the office preparing the final report. 'The time for such discussion of fundamental issues has passed for this round,' he wrote on March 17. 'The administrator and the administration has decided to move forward on endangerment, and your comments do not help the legal or policy case for this decision.' A few minutes later, he instructed Carlin to 'move on to other issues and subjects.' He also told Carlin not to discuss climate change with anyone outside his immediate office.\\" Carlin also acknowledged in the article that his report had been produced under short deadline and, as critics have said since, was not fully or cleanly sourced, and there was no restriction on his contact with the media. Andy was quoted as calling \\"the accusation that Carlin had been muzzled for political reasons 'ridiculous.'

(full legal name: Neobus, Novosadska fabrika autobusa a.d. Novi Sad) was a Serbian bus manufacturer which went bankrupt in 2012. The major shareholder from 2004 was a Saudi businessman Alaa Maghrabi Mohammedali A. Neobus produced buses on its original chassis and on the chassis of other manufacturers such as Volvo, DAF Bus, Mercedes-Benz, FAP. History Neobus was established on 1 June 1952 in Novi Sad, second largest city in Serbia, as Autokaroserija. Neobus was built on the foundations of Stra≈æilovo repair workshop, which was first founded in 1947 in Novi Sad. In the time of its foundation Neobus only had 15 workers. Today, there are 183 employees with this firm. During the first years of its existence Autokaroserija's key business activity was repairing and rebuilding car chassis. In 1956 Autokaroserija started producing new chassis. From that time, Autokaroserija started closely cooperating with TAM (automobile and engine factory) Maribor, a Slovenian truck, bus and chassis manufacturer. The cooperation led to full integration of Autokaroserija with TAM in 1973. The following year, 1974 is one of the most significant years in the history of Neobus. This was the period when Autokaroserija produced its very first urban bus on Volvo chassis for the needs of Novi Sad City Public Transport Company (JGSP). The business relations started between Autokaroserija and JGSP in 1974 made JGSP Autokaroserija's most important buyer. In 1986 started the golden era for Neobus. The factory had moved to a new location in Novi Sad Industrial Zone South where a large facility was built measuring more than 20.000 square meters in surface placed on a plot of 110.000 square meters. 700 workers produced as many as 650 buses a year during this period. With the dissolution of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia there is an interruption of business relations between Autokaroserija and Slovenian TAM. Autokaroserija became an independent bus manufacturer but had many difficulties mostly due to the economic sanctions the United Nations imposed on the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. There was a loss of market share and business connections which put Autokaroserija in a very hard situation. In 1992 the name Autokaroserija was changed to Neobus. The company was limited to Serbian market which was insufficient concerning the installed capacities and the nature of the branch. Business activity started to slow down until it finally collapsed, Neobus entered bankruptcy in 1999, the year of NATO action against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. By 2001, the firm managed to get out of the bankruptcy and started producing buses again. In 2004 The Serbian Privatization Agency held an auction in which Neobus was sold to Alaa Maghrabi Mohammedali A, from Saudi Arabia. The new owner has his own transport enterprise in Saudi Arabia called Maghrabi Hajj Transport Company. The company purchased hundreds of buses from former SFRY manufacturers in 1980s which led to the acquisition of Neobus. In 2006 Neobus signed a Strategic Cooperation Agreement with Volvo, making Neobus Volvo's official bodybuilder for South Eastern Europe. VDL Bus & Coach signed an agreement with Neobus for the production of intercity buses. On 22 November 2012, Neobus was declared bankrupt. In 2013, China's Yutong Bus was in talks to purchase Neobus, but the deal never materialized. Products Neobus Citta SLF owned by transport company Lasta Beograd.

As of 2006, their population was reported as follows: * Labudalin Subdistrict (), 35,994 - seat of the city government. * Shangkuli Subdistrict (), 7,032 * Moridaga (Mo'erdaoga) Town (), 25,309 * Heishantou Town (), 1,797 * Enhe Hada Town () * Sanhe Hui Ethnic Township (), 11,497 * Shiwei () * Enhe () * Jiqian Township () * Mengwu Shiwei Sum () Demographics Ethnic composition of the county-level city of Ergun, as of 2006, was reported as follows: * Han, 64,591 * Mongol, 7,294 * Russians 2,468 * Others (Hui etc.) 10,809 Along the towns and villages of the Argun River within the boundaries of Ergun City are thousands of descendants of intermarriages between Han Chinese men and Russian women. This Russian descended population forms a large portion of the total number of Russians in China. One of the townships is Enhe, which is the only one of the settlements to be an official ethnic Russian township. There are two international border crossings in the county-level city at Shiwei and Heishantou. Ergun Wetlands The city's claim to fame is the Ergun Wetlands (formerly known as the Genhe Wetlands), a plain delta formed by the Argun River and the Genhe River, Deerbugan River and Hawuer River. The Ergun Wetlands is one of the largest wetlands in Asia, lying about 3 km to the west of Labudalin Subdistrict, the urban area and seat of government, of the county-level city. After the end of September the wetlands wither and turn dark. A panoramic view of the wetlands is afforded from a tourist scenic view overlooking the area from a hill 720 meters above sea level. The encroachment of urban development has made preservation of the wetland difficult but were bolstered by a wetland protection law in 2012.

A Jewish nationalist influenced by classical liberalism and Zionism, he first held political offices in Czernowitz city. After 1897, he was one of the noted Jewish representatives in the Austrian Parliament's upper chamber (Abgeordnetenhaus). Straucher, who was instrumental in creating the reformist Progressive Peasants' Fellowship, maintained his Abgeordnetenhaus seat throughout the remainder of Austria-Hungary's existence. From 1906, he led the Jewish National People's Party locally and helped establish the pan-Austrian Jewish National Party. He vied for political direction over the Bukovina Jews with several other groups, most notably the Zionist People's Council Party of Mayer Ebner, who became his personal rival. Straucher supported maintaining tight connections between Jews and Bukovina Germans while endorsing a personal version of Jewish autonomism and Yiddishism. He was a Habsburg loyalist up to the final stages of World War I, and then supported Bukovina's attachment to a \\"German Austria\\". Upon the region's incorporation into Greater Romania, he began cooperating with the larger Union of Romanian Jews. Forming successive alliances with the People's Party and the National Liberal Party, he also served two non-consecutive terms in the Romanian Chamber of Deputies. Despite such moves, and although he endorsed a version of Jewish assimilation, Straucher made himself known as a strong critic of Romanianization measures. Biography=Early career and 1897 election victory Born in the village of Rohozna near Sadag√≥ra (later incorporated into Czernowitz, now in Ukraine), the stepson of a merchant, Straucher graduated from the Czernowitz Gymnasium.Adunka, p.372 He studied law at Vienna University, took his doctorate from Czernowitz Law School in 1880, and became a practicing attorney (for a while, public prosecutor).Adunka, p.372. See also Hausleitner, p.75; Lichtblau & John, p.51; Stambrook, p.5 Straucher, who made himself known for supporting social policies, was elected leader of the local Kehilla in 1882 and, in 1884, deputy to the Czernowitz local council (Stadtrat or Gemeinderat).Hausleitner, p.75. See also Adunka, p.372 Although he became involved in Jewish nationalist circles, Straucher remained an independent populist, who could rally the \\"majority Orthodox proletariat\\" in political actions against the city's more assimilated Jewish elites.Stambrook, p.5, 9, 10 From early on, Straucher campaigned intensely for the Austrian authorities to recognize a separate Jewish community in the entire Duchy of Bukovina, as part of a process to grant all ethnic groups proportional representation.Adunka, p.373; Stambrook, p.10; Shanes, p.171-174 Their request was supported by Yulian Romanchuk, a representative of the Ruthenians (Ukrainians) in Galicia (the Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria), whose participation in the move followed a tradition of collaboration between Ukrainian and Jewish activists.Shanes, p.172sqq Straucher also tightened his contacts with the region's large ethnic Romanian community: as early as 1883, he spoke at a cultural meeting of Societatea AcademicƒÉ Junimea, a student club, offering his praise to the Romanian Orthodox clergy. Dionisiu O. Olinescu, \\"Scrisori din Bucovina\\", in Familia, Nr. 50/1883, p.606 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) Presenting himself in the legislative election of 1897, Straucher became a member of the Abgeordnetenhaus, which represented the Duchy as part of Cisleithania.Adunka, p.372; Hausleitner, p.75, 76; Lichtblau & John, p.51; McCagg, p.173; Rozenblit, p.37; Stourzh, p.183; Weitzmann, p.144-145 Straucher, who was reelected with a large margin during the next race, kept this office for the following decades, throughout World War I and down the end of the Habsburg Monarchy. In 1907, following the introduction of universal male suffrage, Straucher was one of four deputies for the early Jewish National Party to be elected that year, alongside Heinrich Gabel, Arthur Mahler and Adolf Stand (all of whom were elected in Galicia).Rozenblit, p.37; Shanes, p.174-178; Weitzmann, p.144-145 American historian Joshua Shanes, who researched the political climate at the time of the election, noted that the result was \\"not so grand\\", since the list had also endorsed 19 other candidates throughout Cisleithania.Shanes, p.174 As parliamentarian, he did not rally with organized factions, but was briefly member of a \\"Jewish Club\\", formed by representatives in Vienna.Adunka, p.372; Hausleitner, p.76; Lichtblau & John, p.51; McCagg, p.186; Weitzmann, p.144 In this context, Straucher represented the movement identifying itself with German-speaking Europe and Austro‚ÄìGerman liberalism, favoring secularism and the preservation of rule from Vienna.Lichtblau & John, p.50sqq. See also Hausleitner, p.75-76; Stambrook, p.10 One of statements called Bukovina Jews \\"followers of the gigantic German culture\\".Lichtblau & John, p.41 According to historians Michael John and Albert Lichtblau: \\"Since [...] there was no traditionally established, non-German elite to speak of in Bukovina and the hegemonial powers of German-Austrian domination in the areas of education and administration still played a leading role, the Jews of Bukovina oriented themselves in this direction. The positions of power of the two large national groups, the Romanians and the Ruthenians, were still too weak to cause a shift in this orientation on the part of the Jews. In their situation as a people living in a Diaspora, the Jews were forced to rely on the protection of the hegemonial powers and this seemed, as before, to emanate from Vienna.\\"Lichtblau & John, p.50 However, according to historian William O. McCagg, the \\"inimitable character\\" Straucher was elected on this anti- assimilationist platform: a critic of Zionism, he linked Jewish nationhood to a Central European homeland.McCagg, p.173-174 As McCagg notes, his public was still \\"the 'little man' who was overlooked by the elegant elders of the Jewish community\\"‚Äîan outlook he also attributes to the Galician supporters of Jewish autonomism, as well as to the Transleithanian Vilmos V√°zsonyi.McCagg, p.193 He also believes that Straucher's role was similar to that of assimilationist Josef Samuel Bloch (editor of the Oesterreichische Wochenschrift), who insisted that Jews had to prove themselves to be modern Austrian citizens.McCagg, p.184, 193, 194 Anti-antisemitism Engraving by the Austrian Jewish artist Ephraim Moses Lilien, released as propaganda for the 5th World Zionist Congress (1901). The caption reads: May our eyes behold your return in mercy to Zion For all his electoral disputes with official Zionism, Straucher's ideas were largely compatible with those of his rivals: the shared focus was on fostering \\"identity, self-confidence and pride\\"; and, although Zionism campaigned for a Jewish return to the Land of Israel, very few Bukovinan Jews actually made the trip.Stambrook, p.10 According to Lichtblau and John, Straucher came to stand for \\"an unusual mixture of German Liberalism and Jewish Nationalism‚Äîa sort of half-hearted Zionism.\\"Lichtblau & John, p.51 By the 1890s, the Jewish leader, whom Lichtblau and John designate \\"the most important political representative of the Jews of Bukovina\\", decided to end cooperation between local Jews and ethnic Germans, and concentrated on advancing the interests of his community‚Äîa gesture which broke with the tradition of Jewish politicians such as Josef Fechner representing a common German-Jewish vote. Another significant part of Benno Straucher's pre-1918 political activity was dedicated to combating antisemitism: himself exposed to antisemitic allegations voiced by his colleagues in parliament, Straucher was among those who dismissed blood libel claims made during the Hilsner Affair of 1899.Lichtblau & John, p.52. See also Adunka, p.372-373 He gave similar speeches about the growing threat of pogroms on the Austrian border, in the Russian Empire and the Kingdom of Romania.Stambrook, p.11 According to Lichtblau and John, the rise of antisemitism among Austrian German communities was a contributing factor to the rift between German and Jewish liberalism in Bukovina: \\"Naturally, those secular Jews‚Äîwhose acculturation had been a modern one, for whom religion and tradition retained little significance and for whom German [culture] had assumed almost mythological stature as a substitute for the traditional culture they had given up‚Äîwere shocked by the rise of German Nationalist anti-Semitism in the western provinces of the Monarchy, since it endangered their perspective of their own identity.\\"Lichtblau & John, p.52 Antisemitism was more latent in other local communities,Stambrook, p.12-13 but exacerbated in Bukovina German quarters. German-Jewish tensions first surfaced in the early 1890s, when German students adopted religious antisemitism, setting up the Society of Christian Germans in Bukovina (also joined by parliamentarians Arthur Skedl and Michael Kipper).Lichtblau & John, p.53. See also Hausleitner, p.69-72 In reaction, young Jewish activists such as Mayer Ebner embraced Zionism.Lichtblau & John, p.53sqq; Stourzh, p.183. See also Hausleitner, p.75-76 Their clubs were thereafter divided between those who supported immediate emigration (Aliyah) or still invested energy into creating a Bukovina Zionist party.Lichtblau & John, p.53. See also Hausleitner, p.76 In this context, Ebner reluctantly endorsed Straucher, and, in 1904, founded with him a pan-nationalist group called J√ºdischer Volksverein (\\"Jewish People's Union\\").Adunka, p.372; Hausleitner, p.75; Lichtblau & John, p.53 According to McCagg, Straucher's was by then \\"a vaguely Zionist platform\\".McCagg, p.174 Other academics agree: Jess Olson describes Straucher as \\"the Zionist Reichsabgeordneter [Member of Parliament]\\";Olson, p.34 Emanuel S. Goldmith calls him \\"the only nationally inclined Jewish representative\\" in the Viennese Parliament.Goldsmith, p.108 Lichtblau and John illustrate the split between the German and Jewish communities with a sample from one of Straucher's parliamentary speeches, which reads: \\"Why [...] are the Germans engaged in an economic and political war against the Jews? I as well have been raised and educated only as a German. Why am I inferior? [...] [In stating we are Jews and not Germans,] we are drawing the obvious conclusion! And nevertheless we remain friends of the German people because we are admirers of the prodigious German culture. We as a people want to be loyal friends of the German people and of other peoples, if and to the extent that they acknowledge our equal rights and equal worth!\\" Straucher also reacted against the claims of Viennese politicians that Bukovina was destitute and \\"semi-asiatic\\", deeming them \\"most unfair\\".Lichtblau & John, p.65 His other statements of the time are proof of Austrian patriotism, loyalism and reverence for Habsburg Emperor Franz Joseph I.Lichtblau & John, p.55 Freisinnige Verband and Progressive Peasants' Fellowship In 1900, Straucher was also elected to the Diet of Bukovina, and kept his seat to 1918. He was also trusted with directorial positions by the Bukovina savings bank, the Chamber of Commerce, Czernowitz Brewery, and, from 1905, the regional School Board. After years of playing the populist leader, he began courting the political and economic regional elite: the Jewish community was much represented among investors in the city's industry and, according to Straucher's own estimate, provided some 75% of the tax income in Czernowitz and almost 50% in all of Bukovina.Lichtblau & John, p.48-50 After 1903, he was confirmed as president of the Czernowitz Kultusgemeinde (the Kehillas representative body),Adunka, p.372; Lichtblau & John, p.51-52; Stourzh, p.183. McCagg (p.174) says 1900. and the following year came to preside over the Czernowitz city council, where his followers controlled 20 out of 50 seats (giving him a decisive say in the election of a Czernowitz mayor).Hausleitner, p.75 As a result, Czernowitz twice elected Jewish mayors, and was possibly the only \\"Austrian capital\\" to have done so. Also in 1903, Straucher built on his friendship with intellectuals from Bukovina's other main communities, the Romanian Aurel Onciul, of the Democratic Peasants' Party, and the Ukrainian Nikolai von Wassilko. The three of them set up a Freisinnige Verband (\\"Freethinkers' Alliance\\", as in Germany's Freisinnige Partei), noted for condemning the spread of antisemitism. »òtefan Purici, \\"Iancu Flondor (1865‚Äì1924). O via»õƒÉ √Æn slujba dreptƒÉ»õii\\", in the »òtefan cel Mare University of Suceava's Codrul Cosminului, Nr. 10 (2004), p.263-264 The unifying idea of this Verband was electoral reform, that is the attempt to reduce the number of seats allocated to boyars and reassign them according to Straucher's own system; all nationalities involved in the project agreed to follow their respective agenda to a greater emancipation.Gafi»õa, p.161, 162‚Äì163 More likely to interpret political events as evidence of class conflict rather than national emancipation, the Verband notably criticized the regional conservative groups (who generally sought to stump Bukovina's devolution) and the newly founded Romanian National People's Party (PPNR) of boyar Iancu Flondor (whose platform was linked to the Romanian national revival).Gafi»õa, passim Onciul, convinced that more reforms were going to benefit his fellow Romanians, negotiated separately with Flondor, hoping to create unified district committees for the Romanian factions, and even a \\"Unitary Romanian Party\\".Gafi»õa, p.161-165 The conflict between the Freisinnigen Verband and Flondor escalated when the latter used his position in the Diet to reject Straucher's proposal for electoral reform. It peaked when democrats accused Flondor of supporting antisemitism, alleging that he was the anonymous author of some virulently anti-Jewish articles in Bukowinaer Journal.Gafi»õa, p.164-166, 170 The matter was investigated by a special Diet commission, who found in favor of Flondor, and who reported that the Bukowinaer Journal editor Max Reiner had been paid 1,000 Kronen to incriminate the PPNR leader.Gafi»õa, p.166-167, 170 The attempt to defame Flondor, attributed by some to Onciul and Straucher's frustration over Flondor's \\"anti- democratic\\" stance, became known locally as Die Flondor Affair (\\"The Flondor Affair\\").Gafi»õa, p.164-166, 169 Reportedly, Straucher was personally involved in the frame-up, speaking in the Diet against Flondor and his family, and accusing Flondor of having intrigued against his PPNR colleague Gheorghe Popovici.Gafi»õa, p.166 For a while, Benno Straucher was involved with a new union formed by the 1903 \\"Freethinkers\\", which was to facilitate the adoption of radical reforms. Called the Progressive Peasants' Fellowship, it was presided over by him and Onciul, together with Skedl, Georg Graf Wassilko von Serecki and \\"Young Ukrainian\\" Stepan Smal-Stotskyi, taking the majority vote in 1904 elections for the Diet (when Georg Wassilko became Landeshauptmann).Gafi»õa, p.167-169, 174 The Fellowship tacitly approved Straucher's goal of a separate Jewish communal representation, and poured it into legislation proposals.Stambrook, p.11, 13 Jewish National People's Party creation and Yiddishist Conference In 1906, Straucher and lawyer- activist Max Diamant together created Bukovina's Jewish National People's Party.Stourzh, p.193sqq. See also Adunka, p.372; Hausleitner, p.75; Stambrook, p. 11 At an imperial level, he joined up with Austrian Zionists to set up a new Jewish National Party, which adopted the \\"work in the present\\" ideology of Ze'ev Jabotinsky, that is the focus on autonomy for the more sizable Jewish communities of East-Central Europe. Some of his efforts were dedicated to building the Kehilla-run Jewish House of Culture, a major Art Nouveau palace, decorated with his bust.Olson, p.42 Allegations about \\"Jewish\\" corruption in the Czernowitz local council, targeting Straucher's leadership, resulted in ethnic tensions. During autumn 1910, after the accuser, engineer Woitechowski, was called to order by Straucher, the city's Christians organized vigils and strikes. \\"Scrisoare din Bucovina\\", in RƒÉva»ôul, Nr. 11/1910, p.352-353 (digitized by the Babe»ô-Bolyai University Transsylvanica Online Library) By that moment, Straucher's option in favor of Jewish secularism and modernization possibly became a reevaluation of Yiddish as a national Jewish language.Lichtblau & John, p.56-57; Mendelsohn, p.191; Stambrook, p.10; Stourzh, p.194 Reportedly, his advocacy of both autonomy and Yiddishist identity was largely shaped by the \\"Folkist\\" ideology of Jewish groups in the Russian Empire.Mendelsohn, p.191 The Yiddishist view, which placed him among the first Jewish intellectuals to identify with what had been hitherto viewed as a regional dialect of German (reportedly, Straucher himself had earlier designated Yiddish as merely a \\"jargon\\"),McCagg, p.186 brought him into conflict with Jewish traditionalists, who supported instead a Hebrew revival.Lichtblau & John, p.56-57 However, Straucher did not support education in Yiddish, and favored German-language schools, for which he demanded special Jewish inspectors and teachers.Hausleitner, p.78 Notably, Straucher received support from Yiddishist scholar Nathan Birnbaum, who spoke in his favor at Jewish National Party caucuses during the 1907 Austrian elections.Olson, p.29, 42 Together with Diamant and Birnbaum, Straucher organized the first Conference for the Yiddish Language, held in Czernowitz between August 31 and September 3, 1908.Lichtblau & John, p.56-57. See also Goldsmith, p.183-221; Hausleitner, p.77-78; Olson, passim; Stourzh, p.194 The initial demand was for the proceedings to be held at the Jewish House, but the Conference was ultimately hosted by a similar institution of the local Ukrainians and the local Music Society. The reason for this failure is disputed: some attribute it to opposition from the \\"Hebraist\\" adversaries,Lichtblau & John, p.57 others suggest that Straucher was in reality unconvinced about the Conference platform, sabotaging his own Yiddishist campaign.Olson, p.34, 42 The Conference also marked an early confrontation between the liberal mainstream, into which Straucher had been received, and the modern leftist side of Jewish nationalism: Bundistn groups. According to the Bundistn, Yiddish should have been declared not just \\"a\\" Jewish national language, but rather the sole language of Jewishness. \\"Bukovina Settlement\\" and 1911 election Ethnic map of Bukovina in 1930 (Jews in yellow) Largely as a result of political restructuring at a provincial level, the Austrian authorities granted the \\"Bukovina Settlement\\" in stages between 1909 and 1911. This followed an agreement between the three ethnic groups: the Romanians (represented by Onciul and Alexandru Hurmuzaki), the Ukrainians (Georg Wassilko) and the Jews (Straucher himself), who subsequently negotiated the matter with Oktavian Freiherr Regner von Bleyleben, Bukovina's Governor.Stourzh, p.184-187. See also Colin & Rychlo, p.59 Cultural historians Amy Colin and Peter Rychlo view it as \\"one of the most progressive accords between ethnic groups in the Austro-Hungarian Empire\\", and argue: \\"Growing ethnic tensions necessitated such a treaty to protect peace in Bukovina by insuring ethnic autonomy in political decisions [...]. The fruitful cooperation [...] proved that peaceful ethnic interaction was still possible [in Bukovina] five years before the outbreak of World War I.\\"Colin & Rychlo, p.59 The agreement provided for a highly complex electoral reform which provided proportional representation to Bukovinan ethnic groups within the local Diet, but, in accordance with the wishes of mainstream Jews and in an effort to combat antisemitic agitation, did not generally award separate recognition to Jews (apart from a few separate electoral districts, they were included in the same group as Germans).Lichtblau & John, p.54; Stourzh, p.184-186. See also Hausleitner, p.76; Stambrook, p.13-14 Lichtblau and John argue that, through this measure, the Austrian monarchy marked \\"the final demarcation point [...] which linked together the Jews of Bukovina and the Germans.\\"Lichtblau & John, p.54 The formal regulation was subverted by other provisions, which, in time, separated the German and the Jewish curiae in all but name.Stambrook, p.13 Nevertheless, the failure to acknowledge Jews a separate group disappointed the Jewish National People's Party leadership, and caused Straucher to express his protests in a series of open letters.Stourzh, p.186 The 1911 election consecrated a split between Straucher's group and Zionists such as Ebner. They accused Straucher of having set up a dictatorship and of having failed to obtain Jewish representation.Hausleitner, p.76 They moved on to create the separate People's Council Party. Together, the two competing parties won 10 seats, one more than secretly predicted by the Bienerth-Schmerling cabinet in Vienna. The liberal group, rallied from 1909 around Straucher's newspaper Die Volkswehr (\\"People's Defense\\"), was soon drawn into a fierce competition with socialist Jews, including not just with the Bundistn, but also sympathizers of Poale Zion.Hausleitner, p.77, 94, 190‚Äì191, 100, 140, 174, 187, 299; Mendelsohn, p.191. See also Hrenciuc, p.162; Stambrook, p.9-11 The Kultusgemeinde was by then Straucher's prime basis of support in parliamentary elections, and, after the 1911 elections (during which he faced no opposition from Ebner's group), he was the only one among the four of his fellow candidates in the 1907 elections to maintain his seat.Weitzmann, p.144-145 Of the latter, Arthur Mahler left the Jewish nationalist movement and returned to his career as an art historian.Weitzmann, p.145 World War I and the National Jewish Council During World War I, Straucher supported Austria- Hungary's commitment to the Central Powers. Before Bukovina was turned into a battleground (see Brusilov Offensive) he, like other Jewish leaders, expressed hopes that Eastern Front victories against the Russian Empire would signify the effective emancipation of Russian Jews, as well as the end for a threat to Europe's safety.Rozenblit, p.51-52 Soon afterward, he participated in a large political debate regarding the creation of a central democratic institution for Austria-Hungary, which was intended as a replica of the American Jewish Congress, a test of Jewish autonomy and an instrument in combating antisemitism.Rozenblit, p.115-116 Speaking in 1916, he offered his full support to the initiative, and argued in favor of replacing the various other representative bodies, but the move was opposed by the non-Zionist lobby (who preferred a Kehilla-based structure of shtadlanim).Rozenblit, p.116, 125 Straucher subsequently used the Abgeordnetenhaus tribune for condemning the antisemitic violence linked with the various political changes. In spring 1918, soon after Austria signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with the Ukrainian People's Republic, granting it territories claimed by Poles, he expressed alarm that Polish nationalists were attributing the events to the Jews, organizing pogroms and planning the eviction of Jews from Galicia.Rozenblit, p.112 Straucher, like fellow Jewish nationalists Hermann Kadisch and Robert Stricker, continued to express his support for Habsburg ruler Charles I throughout those years. In 1917, he claimed Jews were \\"an upholding element [standing] unconditionally and without reservations for Austria\\";Rozenblit, p.121 a year later, he pleaded with the Austrians to stop censoring the Yiddishist press of Galicia.American Jewish Year Book 5679, p.251, 252 According to social historian Marsha L. Rozenblit, Straucher's loyalism should be contrasted with those of his Jewish political partners in the Czech lands (the Selbstwehr journal group, which was more mindful of the local independence movement).Rozenblit, p.124 Straucher was still at the Abgeordnetenhaus during late autumn 1918, as the Austrian monarchy began to crumble. On October 4, he was among the regional delegates to Vienna who voted in favor of keeping Bukovina in union with the central government.Colin & Rychlo, p.66; Hausleitner, p.90 On November 15, days after German Austria emerged as a rump state, Straucher proposed a bill comprising the demands of Jewish Austrians. These included the recognition of a separate, united and politically autonomous Jewish ethnicity, education rights, and support for \\"the creation of a Jewish national homeland in Palestine\\".American Jewish Year Book 5679, p.210 According to Rozenblit, his autonomist-democratic call was similar to the agendas of both mainstream Zionists and the Galician Poale Zion.Rozenblit, p.123. See also McCagg, p.174 On January 3, 1919, the Zionists reached an agreement with the Jewish deputies, setting up Austria's National Jewish Council, which was supposed to endorse the agenda submitted by Straucher. It sought to represent Jews as a people at the Paris Peace Conference, and negotiated with other local governments over the safety of their Jewish citizens.American Jewish Year Book 5679, p.211-212, 219 At home, the situation was degenerating, as Romanians openly demanded incorporation into the Romanian Kingdom and Ukrainians opted for the Ukrainian People's Republic. These tensions flared into riots, quelled when the Romanian Army entered the region and brought it into Romania (a union internationally sanctioned by the 1919 Treaty of Saint-Germain-en-Laye).Colin & Rychlo, p.66; Hausleitner, p.83sqq In this context, Straucher joined Ebner and the socialist Iacob Pistiner in founding another, regional, National Jewish Council, which stood for the defense of community rights.Hrenciuc, p.162. See also Hausleitner p.187-188 The new group's program was generally suspicious of union with Romania, where Jewish emancipation had not yet been enacted, and looked into other political alternatives‚Äîfor this reason, it was placed under close supervision by the new authorities.Hausleitner, p.187; Hrenciuc, p.162 Major points of contention were the Council's demand for complete educational autonomy and its request that the wartime Jewish refugees in Bohemia, whom the Romanians regarded as aliens, be readmitted into Bukovina.American Jewish Year Book 5679, p.212-213 The Council also clashed with Ion Nistor's nationalist Romanian group, the Democratic Union Party, which, using antisemitic language, spoke about a Jewish danger to the Romanian cause.Hrenciuc, p.162 At the time, other segments of Bukovina's Jewish community began criticizing Straucher for his settlements with Wassilko's Ukrainians, allegedly to the detriment of his own coreligionists.Mihai, p.85, 86 Debut in Romanian politics Shortly after the creation of Greater Romania, the Council boycotted the 1919 general election, thus refusing to send its representatives into the Parliament of Romania. Ebner voiced the mistrust of his coreligionists for the Romanian electoral law, arguing that it was meant to dilute the Jewish vote in that region.Mihai, p.81 This decision was contested by businessman Jakob Hecht, who stood as a Jewish candidate on the same platform as Nistor.Hausleitner, p.187; Hrenciuc, p.162; Mihai, p.83 Hecht's statements, which gave recognition to an unconditional union, were received with consternation by other Jewish activists, who called him a \\"traitor\\".Hrenciuc, p.162; Mihai, p.83 By 1923 however, the entire community leadership had come to accept Romania's rule over the region, and Ebner even claimed that there was never any opposition on its part. In later years, Benno Straucher stood for a platform advocating the preservation of Jewish rights in Bukovina and throughout the Jewish-Romanian community. In the early 1920s, he and his followers began a close cooperation with Wilhelm Filderman's nationwide Union of Romanian Jews (UER).Hausleitner, p.188, 296‚Äì297; Mendelsohn, p.195 The UER nevertheless failed in rallying to its cause the other representatives of Jewish nationalism, such as the Zionists following Straucher's old rival Ebner. The UER initially supported the People's Party of Alexandru Averescu (despite signs that the group was sympathetic of antisemitic causes).Mendelsohn, p.195 Standing in for the deceased Hecht, Straucher and Ebner became the Jewish Council bids for the 1920 election, with additional support from the German Council; Straucher ran in the \\"CernƒÉu»õi-city\\" circumscription, for both Chamber and Senate.Mihai, p.85 At the time, those Jewish voters who did not agree with such maneuvers rallied behind Friedrich Billig, founder of a Jewish Democratic Party. Straucher was the only one elected to the Chamber, effectively on Averescu's ticket.Hausleitner, p.188 The entire UER eventually threw its support behind the National Liberal Party: in the 1922 election, alongside Nistor, former leader of the Democratic Union Party, Straucher endorsed the National Liberal platform for Bukovina.Hausleitner, p.188; Mihai, p.86-88 His activity in Parliament focused on gathering support for a clear emancipation, as promised by the Treaty of Paris and ultimately passed into the 1923 Constitution of Romania. As noted by researcher Alina Cozma, Straucher did so not just out of Jewish nationalism, but also because he believed in equality before the law as a universal prerequisite. Alina Cozma, \\"Parlementaires juifs dans les assembl√©es l√©gislatives de la Roumanie de l'entre-deux-guerres\\", in Jean Garrigues, √âric Anceau, Fr√©d√©ric Attal, No√´lline Castagnez, No√´lle Dauphin, Sabine Jansen, Olivier Tort (eds.), Actes du 57e congr√®s de la CIHAE: Assembl√©es et parlements dans le monde, du Moyen-Age √† nos jours/Proceedings of the 57th ICHRPI Conference: Representative and Parliamentary Institutions in the World, from Middle Ages to Present Times, National Assembly of France, Paris, 2010, p.277-278 In 1923, and again in 1925, the Romanian antisemitic and (increasingly) fascist youth rebelled against the citizenship law and attacked Jewish students in Cluj and Ia»ôi. On both occasions, Straucher insistently urged the governing majority to take special measures against the \\"shameful disturbances\\".NastasƒÉ, p.9, 108, 112, 133, 137, 230‚Äì231, 329‚Äì330 In contrast with Straucher, Ebner and his Zionist faction had entered an alliance with Averescu, and, in the 1926 race, the move got Ebner elected to the Chamber.Hausleitner, p.190; Mihai, p.86, 88; Mendelsohn, p.195 Straucher ran against Ebner's colleagues (Karl Kl√ºger, Henric Streitman), which marked his split with the Bukovina Zionists.Mihai, p.86-87, 88 Final activities Taking precautions against the Ebner's goal of propagating Zionism through Jewish day schools, Straucher gave his approval to the teaching of Romanian- language classes, and therefore to a measure of assimilation, while preventing Zionists from reforming the curriculum.Hausleitner, p.189-190 In this context, he made himself known for protesting the Romanianization policies promoted by the governments in Bucharest, in particular in the educational field. During the mid-1920s, he was in correspondence with National Liberal leader Ion I. C. BrƒÉtianu and Filderman, documenting cases in which Bukovinan schools had been \\"purged\\" of Jewish teachers and administrators were being dismissed, pensioned or demoted by the Ministry of Education, as well as the state-condoned underfunding of state-run Jewish schools.Livezeanu, p.70. See also Hausleitner, p.188 He contrasted these occurrences with the traditionally elevated status of Jews in Czernowitz (then designated as CernƒÉu»õi), whom, he assessed, formed 50% of the city's population and 90% of its taxpayers.Livezeanu, p.70 At the time, the authorities had restructured the secondary education institutions into five high schools, divided by ethnicity, and Straucher's writings attest a significant reduction in attendance numbers for the Jewish Lyc√©e No. 3.Livezeanu, p.68, 69. See also Hrenciuc, p.165-166 Jewish parents were then opting in favor of sending their children to privately run day schools.Hrenciuc, p.165 Straucher did not present his candidature in 1926,Mihai, p.88-90 but his activities were still monitored by antisemitic adversaries, especially after the minority-language students in Bukovina rebelled against the baccalaureate commission. In December 1926, his name was brought up in parliamentary controversy: the antisemitic deputy A. C. Cuza alleged that Ebner was bribing the opposition Peasants' Party, with the goal of reforming legislation, and that, together with Straucher, he was \\"seizing all the land\\" in Bukovina.\\"Debate on Jewish Question...\\", p.1 Cuza's refusal to substantiate his claim sparked a lively debate in the Chamber, during which Cuza's associate, Ion Zelea Codreanu, was heard shouting at Ebner: \\"Anti-Semitism will disappear when you Jews are cleared out of the country!\\"\\"Debate on Jewish Question...\\", p.3 Straucher was reelected to Chamber in the 1927 vote. He had extended his agreement with the National Liberals and, remarkably, ran against a bloc of minorities formed nationally around the Magyar Party, the German Party and Zionist organizations.Mihai, p.90 Ebner, also reconfirmed as deputy, subsequently rallied with the National Peasants' Party.Mendelsohn, p.195-197; Mihai, p.91-93 Opposing all alliance with the UER, he formed a Jewish parliamentary club of non-UER Jewish nationalist representatives, and defined Filderman's policy of alliances with groups suspect of antisemitism as immoral.Mendelsohn, p.196-197. See also Hausleitner, p.190 In the 1928 election, with renewed support from Nistor,Hausleitner, p.296 Straucher retook his parliamentary seat‚Äîone of 6 Jewish deputies, including Filderman and Horia Carp.\\"Appendices II.

At public meetings, Kissman accused Straucher of being a governmental pawn: \\"The government [...] allows the community to collect taxes directly from the Jews, even though the government is against cultural autonomy [...], but prevents the community from being political, surely [because] those politics don't agree with the Liberals, but lets Straucher campaign politically for the Liberals.\\"NastasƒÉ, p.395 With additional backing from the National Liberals, Straucher became a Senate candidate in the 1932 election, but did not receive the vote.Mihai, p.94-95 According to McCagg, his last years were spent in a dispute with younger Yiddishist activists \\"who felt that one could only get through to the Jewish masses by using Yiddish.\\" The aging politician died in 1940, one year into World War II, and several months after the Soviet occupation of Northern Bukovina.

The Fall of Constantinople in 1453 and the subsequent fall of the successor states of the Eastern Roman Empire marked the end of Byzantine sovereignty. Since then, the Ottoman Empire ruled the Balkans and Anatolia, although there were some exceptions: the Ionian Islands were under Venetian rule, and Ottoman authority was challenged in mountainous areas, such as Agrafa, Sfakia, Souli, Himara and the Mani Peninsula. Orthodox Christians were granted some political rights under Ottoman rule, but they were considered inferior subjects.Barker, Religious Nationalism in Modern Europe, p. 118 The majority of Greeks were called rayas by the Turks, a name that referred to the large mass of subjects in the Ottoman ruling class. Meanwhile, Greek intellectuals and humanists who had migrated west before or during the Ottoman invasions began to compose orations and treatises calling for the liberation of their homeland. In 1463, Demetrius Chalcondyles called on Venice and ‚Äúall of the Latins‚Äù to aid the Greeks against the Ottomans, he composed orations and treatises calling for the liberation of Greece from what he called ‚Äúthe abominable, monstrous, and impious barbarian Turks.‚Äù In the 17th century, Greek scholar Leonardos Philaras spent much of his career in persuading Western European intellectuals to support Greek independence. However, Greece was to remain under Ottoman rule for several more centuries. In the 18th and 19th century, as revolutionary nationalism grew across Europe‚Äîincluding the Balkans (due, in large part, to the influence of the French RevolutionGoldstein, Wars and Peace Treaties, p. 20)‚Äîthe Ottoman Empire's power declined and Greek nationalism began to assert itself, with the Greek cause beginning to draw support not only from the large Greek merchant diaspora in both Western Europe and Russia but also from Western European Philhellenes.Boime, Social History of Modern Art, pp. 194‚Äì196 * Trudgill, \\"Greece and European Turkey\\", p. 241 This Greek movement for independence, was not only the first movement of national character in Eastern Europe, but also the first one in a non-Christian environment, like the Ottoman Empire.Clogg, A Concise History of Greece, p. 6 Greeks under Ottoman rule Leonardos Philaras (c. 1595 - 1673) was a Greek scholar an early supporter of Greek liberation, he spent much of his career in persuading Western European intellectuals to support Greek Independence. The Greek Revolution was not an isolated event; numerous failed attempts at regaining independence took place throughout the history of the Ottoman era. In 1603, there was an attempt in Morea to restore the Byzantine Empire. Throughout the 17th century there was great resistance to the Ottomans in the Peloponnese and elsewhere, as evidenced by revolts led by Dionysius the Philosopher in 1600 and 1611 in Epirus.Kassis, Mani's History, p. 29. The Ottoman rule of Morea was interrupted by the Morean War, as the peninsula came under Venetian rule for 30 years. Between the 1680s and the Ottoman reconquest in 1715 during the Ottoman‚ÄìVenetian War,Kassis, Mani's History, pp. 31‚Äì33. the province would remain in turmoil from then on and throughout the 17th century, as the bands of the klephts multiplied. The first great uprising was the Russian-sponsored Orlov Revolt of the 1770s, which was crushed by the Ottomans after having limited success. After the crushing of the uprising, the Muslim Albanians ravaged many regions in mainland Greece.Svoronos, History of Modern Greece, p. 59 * Vacalopoulos, History of Macedonia, p. 336 However, the Maniots continually resisted Turkish rule, enjoying virtual autonomy and defeating several Turkish incursions into their region, the most famous of which was the invasion of 1770.Kassis, Mani's History, p. 35. During the second Russo-Turkish War, the Greek community of Trieste financed a small fleet under Lambros Katsonis, which was a nuisance for the Turkish navy; during the war klephts and armatoloi rose once again.Svoronos, History of Modern Greece, p. 59 At the same time, a number of Greeks enjoyed a privileged position in the Ottoman state as members of the Ottoman bureaucracy. Greeks controlled the affairs of the Orthodox Church through the Ecumenical Patriarchate, based in Constantinople, as the higher clergy of the Orthodox Church was mostly of Greek origin. Thus, as a result of the Ottoman millet system, the predominantly Greek hierarchy of the Patriarchate enjoyed control over the Empire's Orthodox subjects (the Rum milletiGeorgiadis‚ÄìArnakis, The Greek Church of Constantinople, p. 238). Modern scholars assert that the Greek Orthodox Church played a pivotal role in the preservation of national identity, the development of Greek society and the resurgence of Greek nationalism. From the 18th century and onwards, members of prominent Greek families in Constantinople, known as Phanariotes (after the Phanar district of the city) gained considerable control over Turkish foreign policy and eventually over the bureaucracy as a whole.Paparrigopoulos, History of the Hellenic Nation, Eb, p. 108 * Svoronos, The Greek Nation, p. 89 * Trudgill, \\"Greece and European Turkey\\", p. 241 Rigas Feraios (here portrayed by Andreas Kriezis), who developed plans for a co-ordinated, pan-Balkan uprising against the Ottoman rule, is regarded as a forerunner of the Greek Revolution. Of considerable importance during the same period was the strong maritime tradition on the islands of the Aegean, together with the emergence over the 18th century of an influential merchant class, which generated the wealth necessary to found schools, libraries and pay for young Greeks to study at the universities of Western Europe.Trudgill, \\"Greece and European Turkey\\", p. 241 It was there that they came into contact with the radical ideas of the European Enlightenment, the French Revolution and romantic nationalism. They also came to realize the influence of the Greek language and civilization in the thought of the educated young people of the time.Clogg, A Concise History of Greece , pp. 25‚Äì26 Educated and influential members of the large Greek diaspora, such as Adamantios Korais and Anthimos Gazis, tried to transmit these ideas back to the Greeks, with the double aim of raising their educational level and simultaneously strengthening their national identity. This was achieved through the dissemination of books, pamphlets and other writings in Greek, in a process that has been described as the modern Greek Enlightenment (Greek: ŒîŒπŒ±œÜœâœÑŒπœÉŒºœåœÇ). The rich merchants had a very important role in this, greatly funding, aside from schools and libraries, book publications. A constantly increasing number of books were being published, especially addressed to Greek audience. The books published in the last fourth of the 18th century, were seven times as many as those published in the first. In the twenty years before the revolution, some 1,300 new titles had been published. The most influential of the writers and intellectuals who helped shape a consensus among Greeks both within and outside the Ottoman Empire was Rigas Feraios. Born in Thessaly and educated in Constantinople, Feraios wrote articles for the Greek-language newspaper Efimeris in Vienna in the 1790s. Deeply influenced by the French Revolution, he was the first who conceived and organized a comprehensive national movement aiming at the liberation of all Balkan nations‚Äîincluding the Turks of the region‚Äîand the creation of a \\"Balkan Republic\\". He published a series of revolutionary tracts and proposed republican Constitutions for the Greek and later also pan-Balkan Republic. Arrested by Austrian officials in Trieste in 1797, he was handed over to Ottoman officials and transported to Belgrade along with his co-conspirators. All of them were strangled to death and their bodies were dumped in the Danube, in June 1798.Svoronos, History of Modern Greece, p. 62 Feraios' death ultimately fanned the flames of Greek nationalism; his nationalist poem, the Thourios (war-song), was translated into a number of Western European and later Balkan languages and served as a rallying cry for Greeks against Ottoman rule:Paroulakis, The Greeks: Their Struggle for Independence, p. 32 :Greek : : : : : : :[...] : : :English :For how long, o brave young men, shall we live in fastnesses, :Alone, like lions, on the ridges in the mountains? :Shall we dwell in caves, looking out on branches, :Fleeing from the world on account of bitter serfdom? :Abandoning brothers, sisters, parents, homeland :Friends, children, and all of our kin? :[...] :Better one hour of free life, :Than forty years of slavery and prison.Clogg, A Concise History of Greece, p. 29. Klephts and armatoloi Armatolos. Water Colour by Carl Haag. In times of militarily weak central authority, the Balkan countryside became infested by groups of bandits that struck at Muslims and Christians alike, called klephts (Œ∫ŒªŒ≠œÜœÑŒµœÇ) in Greek, the equivalent of Hajduks. Defying Ottoman rule, the klephts were highly admired and held a significant place in the popular mythology.Clogg, A Concise History of Greece, pp. 9, 40‚Äì41 Responding to the klephts' attacks, the Ottomans recruited the ablest amongst these groups, contracting Christian militias, known as armatoloi (Greek: Œ±œÅŒºŒ±œÑŒøŒªŒøŒØ), to secure endangered areas, especially mountain passes. The area under their control was called armatolik,Koliopoulos, Brigands with a Cause, p. 27 the oldest known being established in Agrafa during the reign of Murad II.Vacalopoulos, The Greek Nation, 1453-1669, p. 211 Boundaries between klephts and armatoloi were not clear, as the latter would often turn into klephts to extort more benefits from the authorities, and, consequently, another klepht group would be appointed to the armatolik to confront their predecessors.Batalas, Irregular Armed Forces, p. 156 Nevertheless, klephts and armatoloi formed a provincial elite, though not a social class whose members would muster under a common goal.Batalas, Irregular Armed Forces, p. 154 As the armatoloi's position gradually turned into a hereditary one, some captains took care of their armatolik as their personal property. A great deal of power was placed in their hands and they integrated in the network of clientelist relationships that formed the Ottoman administration. Some managed to establish exclusive control in their armatolik, forcing the Porte to repeatedly, though unsuccessfully, try to eliminate them.Batalas, Irregular Armed Forces, pp. 156‚Äì157. By the time of the War of Independence powerful armatoloi could be traced in Rumeli, modern Thessaly, Epirus and southern Macedonia.Koliopoulos, Brigands with a Cause, p. 29 According to Yannis Makriyannis, klephts and armatoloi‚Äîbeing the only available major military formation on the side of the Greeks‚Äîplayed such a crucial role in the Greek revolution that he referred to them as the \\"yeast of liberty\\".Makriyannis, Memoirs, IX Filiki Eteria Lord Byron (here portrayed by Thomas Phillips) was a prominent British philhellene who died during the Greek revolution.Feraios' martyrdom was to inspire three young Greek merchants, Nikolaos Skoufas, Manolis Xanthos, and Athanasios Tsakalov. Influenced by the Italian Carbonari (organized in the fashion of Freemasonry), they founded in 1814 the secret Filiki Eteria (\\"Friendly Society\\") in Odessa, an important center of the Greek mercantile diaspora.Clogg, A Concise History of Greece, p. 31 With the support of wealthy Greek exile communities in Britain and the United States and with the aid of sympathizers in Western Europe, they planned the rebellion. The society's basic objective was a revival of the Byzantine Empire, with Constantinople as the capital, not the formation of a national state.Jelavich, History of the Balkans, pp. 204‚Äì205. In early 1820, Ioannis Kapodistrias, an official from the Ionian Islands who had become the joint foreign minister of Tsar Alexander I, was approached by the Society in order to be named leader but declined the offer; the Filikoi (members of Filiki Eteria) then turned to Alexander Ypsilantis, a Phanariote serving in the Russian army as general and adjutant to Alexander, who accepted.Clogg, A Concise History of Greece, pp. 31‚Äì32 The Filiki Eteria expanded rapidly and was soon able to recruit members in all areas of the Greek world and among all elements of the Greek society. In 1821, the Ottoman Empire mainly faced the war against Persia and most particularly the revolt by Ali Pasha in Epirus, which had forced the vali (governor) of the Morea, Hursid Pasha, and other local pashas to leave their provinces and campaign against the rebel force. At the same time, the Great Powers, allied in the \\"Concert of Europe\\" in opposition to revolutions in the aftermath of Napoleon I of France, were preoccupied with revolts in Italy and Spain. It was in this context that the Greeks judged the time ripe for their own revolt. The plan originally involved uprisings in three places, the Peloponnese, the Danubian Principalities and Constantinople. CitationsSources=Primary sources * Makriyannis, Yannis, Memoirs.

Steitz, The Gairdner 50 Foundation. Education and career Born in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, Steitz studied chemistry as an undergraduate at Lawrence University in Appleton, Wisconsin, graduating in 1962. While there he was a member of the fraternity, Delta Tau Delta, the Delta Nu chapter. In June 2010, the University renamed its chemistry building Thomas A. Steitz Hall of Science. He received a Ph.D. in biochemistry and molecular biology from Harvard University in 1966 where he worked under the direction of subsequent 1976 chemistry Nobel Prize winner William N. Lipscomb, Jr. While at Harvard, after the training task of determining the structure of the small molecule methyl ethylene phosphate, Steitz made contributions to determining the atomic structures of carboxypeptidase A and aspartate carbamoyltransferase, each the largest atomic structure determined in its time. Steitz did postdoctoral research as a Jane Coffin Childs Postdoctoral Fellow at the MRC Laboratory of Molecular Biology at the University of Cambridge during 1967‚Äì1970. Steitz started an assistant professorship at the University of California, Berkeley, but soon resigned, on the grounds that the institution would not accept his wife Joan into a faculty position because she was a woman. Both Tom and Joan Steitz joined the Yale faculty in 1970, where he continued to work on cellular and structural biology. Steitz and Peter Moore determined the atomic structure of the large 50S ribosomal subunit using X-ray crystallography, and published their findings in Science in 2000. In 2009, Steitz was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for his ribosome research. He was also a Macy Fellow at the University of G√∂ttingen during 1976‚Äì1977 and a Fairchild Scholar at the California Institute of Technology during 1984-1985.

It was established in 1998 by the Royal Academy of Engineering and the Department for International Development (DFID). EAP‚Äôs Programme EAP‚Äôs programme is focused in three key areas: infrastructure, the extractive industries (oil, gas & mining) and engineering education. Individual projects within these areas are undertaken in collaboration with strategic partners. EAP‚Äôs programme is built on two propositions: * While aid and debt relief are important, they are unlikely to offer sustainable solutions to poverty in the long-term unless they are mobilised to accelerate pro-poor economic growth, promote enterprise development and create millions of decent jobs. * Effective mobilisation of the private sector represents one of the single greatest opportunities to step-up the fight against poverty. Achieving this requires the alignment of the commercial interests of companies with the development priorities of poor people to deliver outcomes that are better for society and better for business... Major Initiatives=Procurement research EAP has been working in partnership with the Institution of Civil Engineers to demonstrate how procurement can be used to increase local content (i.e. the proportion of goods, services and labour sourced locally) in public sector infrastructure projects. Together they conducted extensive research that culminated in the publication of a report. A range of international agencies have made use of the knowledge contained in the report including the African Development Bank, OECD and the European Commission. In 2009‚Äì10 they will be developing systems to measure the impact of the improvements that we have been advocating. CoST Secretariat EAP is part of the International Secretariat of the Construction Sector Transparency Initiative (CoST) that is tackling the problem of corruption in the construction sector head on. Launched by DFID in 2008 and coordinated by PricewaterhouseCoopers, CoST is developing systems and procedures to enable the public disclosure of material project information. Improving transparency in this way will make it possible for decision-makers to be held accountable. It will also help to reduce corruption and boost growth and development. Seven pilot countries - Tanzania, Botswana, Zambia, Ethiopia, Philippines, Vietnam and the UK ‚Äì are participating in the pilot phase. EAP is providing policy and technical advice to CoST and helping to ensure that a pro-poor perspective is integrated into decision making. Health & safety in construction EAP has been working with the Institution of Engineers Tanzania to train a team of 35 Tanzanian men and women to international standards in construction health and safety and training delivery. They are also working with them to develop a training programme that is specific to the Tanzanian context and which when finished, will be recognised as a new national standard. The Tanzanian trainers will be running courses with government, industry and trade unions throughout the country in 2009. Extractive industries EAP have recently published innovative practical guidance to industry on maximising local benefits of Oil Gas & Mining projects, including an analysis of the opportunities for engineering services contractors to deliver local content (in partnership with the Overseas Development Institute) and a briefing note funded by the International Finance Corporation. They have also jointly released a guidance note with International Alert on conflict sensitive business practice for engineering contractors, particularly those working in the extractive industries. Engineering education EAP has been working with the Institute of Education (IoE) to explore the extent to which global issues are incorporated into the engineering curricula of UK universities. Their joint report captures the learning from a series of high-level roundtable meetings held in UK universities. It also makes a series of practical recommendations aimed at enabling UK universities to build on past success, overcome barriers and integrate the ‚Äòglobal dimension‚Äô into teaching. They are now working in partnership with the Engineering Subject Centre, Engineering Council UK and the Institute of Education to provide practical support to 7 UK-based universities.

Smith bought ¬£23.1m worth of shares. Ferranti then revealed it was a victim of a massive fraud (the ‚ÄòGuerin‚Äô fraud, an American businessman had sold them a worthless company) and the share price fell considerably. Smith sold the shares for ¬£11,788,204, a loss of ¬£11,353,220. Smith then brought an action for deceit. Judgment=Court of Appeal The Court of Appeal awarded ¬£1,196,010 in damages to reflect the difference between what was paid and the market value at the date of purchase. House of Lords Lord Browne-Wilkinson held that Smith New Court was entitled to the full loss of ¬£11.3m. He laid down seven principles as follows: :(1) the defendant must make reparation from all damage coming directly from the transaction :(2) foreseeability is irrelevant :(3) the full price paid can be recovered, minus any benefits he received resulting from the transaction :(4) a general rule is that benefits include market price as at the date of acquisition, but this is not to be inflexible to prevent full compensation :(5) that general rule does normally not apply when misrepresentation continues to operate after acquisition, inducing the claimant to retain the asset, or the claimant is locked into holding the property by reason of the fraud :(6) consequential loss is recoverable... :(7) ...subject to mitigation once fraud is discovered.

The special abode of Tui Fiti was a mound within a grove of large and durable trees called ifilele (Afzilia bijuga). Tui Fiti's abode is called the vao sa, a sacred part of the forest which is tapu in Fagamalo. Tui Fiti is referred to as the ali'i (high chief) of Fagamalo. There are no other ali'i chiefly titles in the village where all the matai chief titles are of orator tulafale status. Fagamalo is one of the pito nu'u sub-villages of the greater Matautu village on Savai'i island's central north coast. The missionary George Turner wrote in Samoa, a Hundred Years Ago and Long Before (1884) that Tuifiti was the name of a village god in Savai'i who appeared as a man who walked about but was never visible to the people of the place. However, he could be seen by strangers. In 1978, the Governor-General of Fiji, Ratu Sir George Cakobau, arrived in Fagamalo during a state visit to Samoa. The High Chief of Fiji had requested a visit to Tui Fiti's burial ground. Cakobau was bestowed the chiefly title of Peseta by the matai of Matautu in recognition of Samoa's ancient connection with Fiji. The matai chief title of Peseta is referred to as a manaia title, one of the highest chief titles in Matautu. The title Peseta is included in the fa'alupega genealogy in Samoan oratory for the people of Matautu.

In 1797 he entered Rotherham College as a student for the ministry. In 1801 he became the first pastor of the congregational church at Tutbury, Staffordshire. He pursued studies into puritan and nonconformist history and biography. Resigning his ministerial duties in 1830, from failing health, he lived at Birmingham, still continuing his studies, and publishing. Alexander Gordon in the Dictionary of National Biography comments that Brook was a better biographer than historian. He was a member of the educational board of Springhill College, opened August 1838. At the time of his death he was collecting materials for a history of puritans who emigrated to New England. He died at the Lozells, then outside Birmingham, on 5 January 1848, at the age of 73. He is said to have been one of the last who retained among the congregationalists the old ministerial costume of shorts and black silk stockings. Works He published: * Appeal to Facts to justify Dissenters in their Separation from the Established Church, 2nd ed. 1806, (3rd ed. 1815, with title Dissent from the Church of England justified by an Appeal to Facts). * The Lives of the Puritans . . . from the Reformation under Q.

It lies on the River Mease, about north of Tamworth, 1¬Ω miles east of Harlaston and 1 mile west of Clifton Campville where population details as taken at the 2011 census can be found. History The name of the village is believed to be Old English, with the meaning Hagenas (or Hagonas) farm. The chapel of St James the Greater at Haunton is mentioned in Domesday, and Haunton was a chapelry of the parish of St Andrew, Clifton Campville, until the reformation. The chapel then fell into disrepair. For local government purposes Haunton remained a township of Clifton, and is still in the civil parish of Clifton Campville. In 1848 the population of Haunton is given as 197. Landmarks Haunton includes a number of listed buildings, for example, the Grange, the Church of St Michael and St James and the nursing home (formerly Haunton Hall). Church and Convent The more recent history of Haunton Hall is closely linked with the Church of St Michael and St James and a community of Roman Catholic nuns. Charles Edward Mousley inherited the hall in the 1840s, and by 1845 had provided a chapel at the hall dedicated to the Immaculate Conception and available for Catholic services. By 1885 a church dedicated to St Michael had replaced the chapel for services. This church had been built with the support of the Squire of Clifton Campville, Henry John Pye, the son in law of the Anglican bishop Samuel Wilberforce. Pye had once been the Anglican rector of Clifton parish, but had since converted to Catholicism. This early church was soon extended, reusing masonry from the by then ruined Chapel of St James the Greater, and received its current name, adding the former dedication to the new. In 1902 this church was replaced by a new one, designed by Edmund Kirby, with the support of the latest tenant of Haunton Hall, Lady Frances Mostyn, mother of the future archbishop Francis Mostyn. Built of stone, in a neo-gothic style, it has a small timber bell tower, and contains stained glass from the firm of John Hardman and Company. In 1904 a group of French nuns, the Sisters of St Joseph of Bordeaux, set up a convent in Haunton Hall. This later became the St. Joseph Convent School for Girls. In 1987 the school closed and the hall is now a nursing home, with the nuns moving to a new convent. The new Convent was specially built next to the original convent and is very much smaller in order to accommodate the diminishing number of Nuns. It has now become vacant and is currently for sale.

Its activities aim to enhance safety of navigation, safety of life at sea, security of ships, safe carriage of cargo, environmental safety of ships, prevention of pollution from ships, and performance of authorisations issued by maritime administrations and customers. RS develops and continually improves its rules and guidelines in compliance with requirements of the international standards to ensure the safety at sea and pollution prevention. The RS seeks to maintain its own quality management system at the highest possible level and also to promote implementation of high technical standards in design of ships, shipbuilding and shipping industry using its unique experience in ensuring maritime safety. RS has over 100 offices worldwide providing classification, survey, certification, design appraisal and quality systems' verification services. RS is one of the leading classification societies and a member of IACS. It takes part in the work of the International Maritime Organization, the International Organisation for Standardisation and the International Labour Organization. History In Russia the first acts of state technical supervision date back to the beginning of the 18th century - the time of the intensive development of the Russian fleet. By the end of the century the Charter of Merchant Shipping had been approved regulating mandatory state registration of ships and documentation on the technical condition of a vessel. At that time, ships were classed by type and age, therefore there emerged a necessity in a more advanced system that would take into account structural features, strength, technical condition and navigation area. As soon as the end of the 19th century the first classification body was established. In 1899 the first classification rules emerged. On 31 December 1913, the charter of the classification society \\"Russian Register\\" was approved. The society was renamed several times due to the historical reasons: Russian Register, the USSR Register of Shipping, Russian Maritime Register of Shipping. The proper technical condition of the fleet is to be provided by highly qualified staff and regular scientific research. Since 1914 the research and development activities have been coordinated by the Scientific and Technical Council. RS has always been using the latest scientific and technical achievements. The USSR Register of Shipping was the first society to develop requirements for Arctic ships. The society's rules for electric welding proved the possibility of implementation of this new technology during the construction and repair of ships. Since the 1950s the USSR Register of Shipping has become the only classification society in the world to have nuclear ships in its class. Russian Maritime Register of Shipping is the legal successor of the USSR Register of Shipping. Organization and management Russian Maritime Register of Shipping (RS) is an international classification society established in 1913. In RS class there are 6 677 ships flying flags of more than 40 states. RS structure comprises the Head Office in St. Petersburg and 109 offices in Russia and abroad. Over 1500 highly qualified specialists provide the whole range of RS works and services worldwide, RS is one of the twelve classification societies who are members of the International Association of Classification Societies (IACS), which cover 90% of the world merchant fleet. RS is actively involved in the proceedings of IACS Council and working groups, covering all aspects of the classification society's operation. RS uses its scientific-research assets for elaborating and improving IACS Unified requirements. RS participated in developing the IACS Common Structural Rules.IACS Common Structural Rules Since 1973, RS has for three times been the Chairing Society of IACS Council. RS has been recognized by the European Union. As members of the RF delegations, the RS experts participate in the proceedings of the IMO, ISO and EFQM committees and sub- committees. RS is an associate member of INTERTANKO, INTERCARGO and BIMCO. RS performs classification and survey of ships and floating structures under construction and in service as well as statutory surveys as authorized by maritime administrations of a number of countries. Authorized by the maritime administration of the RF and other 37 countries, RS performs certification of safety management systems of shipping companies and ships for compliance with ISM Code. This safety standard provides for establishing safety management systems in shipping companies and for eliminating human factor from safe operation of ships. RS experts on ISM Code working in RS offices worldwide provide prompt services on certification for compliance with the ISM Code requirements.

After a playing career spent mostly at the Canberra Raiders, with a brief stint with the Adelaide Rams, he became assistant coach of Melbourne Storm under Craig Bellamy and in 2009 became a head coach in the Super League with English club the Wigan Warriors. He was previously the head coach for the South Sydney Rabbitohs in the National Rugby League. In his first year as Wigan Warriors' coach Maguire won the 2010 Super League Grand Final. In his second year he won the 2011 Challenge Cup and was then signed by the Rabbitohs. In his first year as an NRL head coach he took South Sydney deep into the 2012 finals series. In 2013, Souths finished the regular season in second place and in 2014 they won their first premiership in 43 years. Background Maguire was born in Canberra, ACT, Australia. Playing career After initially starting playing in rugby union, Maquire signed for NSWRL club the Canberra Raiders in 1991 and made his Winfield Cup d√©but for the club off the bench against Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles in a narrow 14-15 loss. Maguire did not feature again until 1994 when he came off the bench again against Penrith Panthers. He had a more consistent season the following year, making six appearances in total, most of which he started as either wing or centre. Maguire's first try came as a centre against the Parramatta Eels. In 1997 Maguire left Canberra and signed for the new Adelaide Rams club in the breakaway Australian Super League competition. He made his d√©but at fullback in the Rams inaugural game against the North Queensland Cowboys in Townsville which Adelaide lost 24-16.North Queensland Cowboys vs Adelaide Rams 1997 rugbyleagueproject.org Maguire also participated in the World Club Challenge for the Rams that year. He went on to play four more games for Adelaide and scored one try before returning to Canberra in 1998. Maguire made two appearances for Canberra in 1998 before retiring after persistent neck problems. Coaching career When Maguire retired from playing he initially left the game and taught Physical Education before signing as a strength and conditioning coach for Canberra. He later became an assistant coach for the Raiders' reserve grade under Mal Meninga. Maguire was eventually promoted to assistant coach of the Canberra first team alongside Matthew Elliott, before leaving the club in 2004 to take the assistant coaching job at Melbourne Storm under a former Raiders teammate, Craig Bellamy. Maguire was an integral part in Melbourne's stripped NRL premierships and took control of first team affairs when head coach Bellamy took up representative duties for the Blues in State of Origin. This earned him plaudits from senior coaches in the NRL and Maguire was linked with a move to Brisbane Broncos as head coach in 2008. He was heavily linked with a move to English club Wigan Warriors towards the end of the 2009 season and signed a three-year deal with the Super League side on 7 October 2009. Wigan Warriors Maguire started his Wigan coaching career with a victory against the Crusaders in his first home match of the season. He ended the Halliwell Jones hoodoo against Warrington Wolves in a thrilling match which Wigan won 22-20. He won RLW coach of the month for February. Maguire then recorded his biggest victory as a Wigan coach, beating nearest rivals St. Helens in the last ever Good Friday derby match at Knowsley Road. He and his assistant Shaun Wane helped guide Wigan to the League Leaders' Shield in 2010. This was the first time Wigan topped the table in 10 years and marked a trophy winning start to \\"Madge's\\" Wigan coaching tenure. Maguire guided Wigan to their first Super League Grand Final appearance in 7 years as the Warriors beat Leeds Rhinos in a semi-final at Headingley by a scoreline of 26-6 on 25 September 2010. Maguire was crowned Coach of the Year 2010 at the annual Super League 'Man of Steel' awards dinner.http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/rugby_league/9038552.stm Maguire managed the Wigan Warriors side to their first Super League Grand Final win in over 10 years beating their arch rivals in the 2010 Super League Grand Final victory over St. Helens at Old Trafford. The following February his Wigan side took on 2010 NRL premiers St. George Illawarra Dragons in the 2011 World Club Challenge but were defeated. In 2011 Maguire announced his resignation from Wigan, in order to replace the retiring John Lang as head coach of National Rugby League club the South Sydney Rabbitohs for the 2012 NRL season. Maguire coached Wigan to the 2011 Challenge Cup Final victory over the Leeds Rhinos at Wembley Stadium. South Sydney Rabbitohs Maguire joined the South Sydney Rabbitohs in October 2011, after the end of the NRL and Super League seasons. He had signed a contract with the club earlier in the year, to replace the retiring John Lang. The Rabbitohs performed well during the 2012 NRL season with Maguire credited for the successful move of Greg Inglis from centre to full-back. The team progressed to within one game of the 2012 NRL Grand Final. The following year, Maguire guided Souths to within one game of the 2013 NRL Grand Final but the club were defeated 30-20 by Manly-Warringah in the preliminary final. In the 2014 NRL season, Souths were tipped to be winners of the minor premiership, along with the Sydney Roosters and Manly-Warringah Sea Eagles. The first finals round saw Souths defeat Manly, then facing the Roosters in the preliminary final. Unlike the last round of the ordinary season, Souths overcome an early 12-0 deficit to score 32 unanswered points, eventually winning the match 32-22. Under Maguire's coaching this was the first time since 1971 that South Sydney had reached a grand final. Souths defeated the Canterbury-Bankstown Bulldogs 30-6 in the 2014 NRL Grand Final, securing their 21st premiership and their first since 1971. In September 2017, Maguire was terminated as coach of South Sydney despite having two years remaining on his contract.https://www.foxsports.com.au/nrl/nrl- premiership/michael-maguire-blindsided-coachs-crazy-last-48-hours-at-the- south-sydney-rabbitohs/news-story/b5bae8311a96313ad50e32bd816c7e33 Wests Tigers On 28 October 2018, Maguire was announced as Head coach of Wests Tigers for the next three years.

It is close to Greens Norton village and now consists almost entirely of Caswell House, a former family farmhouse built for the 4th Duke of Grafton in 1839. Another similar house is at Field Burcote, a hamlet north of Green's Norton. Both have three widely spaced bays with low-pitched hipped slate roofs and lower wings and are formally arranged The building and stables are Grade II listed. Research establishment=Foundation The concept of a research lab covering the Plessey company's interests in materials germinated in 1934 when its founders Allen George Clark and William Heynes were in charge. Another leading member of staff at this time was Geoffrey Charles Gaut who joined the Plessey company from Oxford University where he was awarded a degree in chemistry. He joined as Chief Chemist at Ilford where he began a lifelong involvement with electronic materials and devices. At the beginning of the Second World War in 1939 he volunteered for the RAF having qualified as a pilot with the University Air Squadron at Oxford. However, to his chagrin, his commission was cancelled through the influence of Allen Clark who believed that Gaut would have a special role to play in the war effort to develop electronics and radar. 1940s and 50s With bombing in the Ilford area in 1940, Gaut was told to relocate his laboratory in a quieter country environment where research could proceed undisturbed. Thus was founded Plessey's laboratory at Caswell, in Northamptonshire, which, as Gaut said, also kept his young scientific team concentrating and well away from any interference by senior management. Post- war the distance between Ilford and Caswell forced the introduction of local pre-production units. Over the next 20 years or so this led to the establishment of at least a further eight independent businesses locally in the Towcester area especially around Wood Burcote, just south of the town. 1960s to 1990s For the next 50 or so years the farmhouse became the home of the Allen Clark Research Centre for the now defunct company which later became part of the British GEC in 1989. The centre was officially opened under Clark's name (Clark had died in 1962) by the Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh on 20 March 1964 where the Duke unveiled a plaque by Scottish sculptor David McFall. Research was carried out there for a number of areas in which Plessey was involved including semiconductors, LED's, other solid-state devices and integrated circuits (ICs) and was the birthplace of self scanned C-MOS light sensor arrays (PJW Noble) for their company Plessey Semiconductors (also known for a time as Plessey Microelectronics) based at Cheney Manor, Swindon, (the building was demolished in c.2015). The site also had a scanning electron microscope useful for checking the surface topology of ICs under static and charged conditions. At peak, the centre employed several hundred people. After the GEC/Siemens takeover of Plessey, the Caswell site was taken over by GEC and subsequently GEC Marconi. Marconi problems later led to the sale of the site to Bookham Technology in 2002. A talented German engineer, William Oscar Heyne was employed by the company.

Fascia is a sheet of connective tissue that is found beneath the skin that attaches, stabilizes, encloses, and separates muscles and other internal organs. Everyone has fascia, as it is part of how the human body is composed. Fascia is organized by layer, and can also be classified by location or function in the body. While abdominal fascia is quite a simple part of how the human body is made up, there are other implications and involvements that abdominal fascia is a part of.  Research  In a 2016 study, abdominal superficial fascia was collected from both male and female cadavers. The elastic, collagen, and hydroxyproline components were sampled and then studied. It was found that the elastic, collagen, and hydroxyproline components were higher in upper abdomen regions compared to lower abdomen regions. This could be a reason as to why bulging of the abdomen and skin sagging occurs more in the lower regions of people, compared to the upper regions. This study that was conducted could lead to further discussions and studies in finding ways to manage obesity. In a study from January 2011, Mechanical properties of abdominal human fascia were studied according to the direction of loading and localization. Human umbilical (UF) and transversalis fascia (FT) have been studied to understand the differences in mechanical properties of the human body. The differences between the mechanical properties of both UF and FT were not significant according to localization; therefore, the mechanical properties of human abdominal fascia are not controlled by the localization. Another study from 2018, showed differences in mechanical and structural properties of human fascia and their gender differences. While the study was done on fascia from the thighs, the results which were comparing the differences between males and females, can also be applied to understanding the abdominal area of males and females. Ultimately, it was found that the fascia lata at the lateral site was thicker and longitudinally directed fibers had higher rates of distribution compared to other sites.  Further Findings  It can be involved in certain forms of breast reconstruction.

The architecture was too small and simple in the beginning and over the years it was extended and renovated. The temple now covers an area of 1,300 square meters. This temple is built according to the geography of the mountains behind the temple and the Cha River in front of the temple. In and around the temple, there are a number of historical sculptures, plaques, and patterns. Da Cheng Gate, the last gate of the temple, resembles an ancient halberd, therefore, people also refer to it as Halberd Gate. There are 3 doors in this gate, with the centre door only opening during certain important events. There are 108 nails on each door as 108 represents a lucky number in ancient China. The Temple of Guan Yu Wu Temple Situated on the right side the Confucius Temple at about 50 meters is the Wu Temple. This temple was initially built in 1603 and rebuilt in 1720 thereafter it was destroyed during the war in 1854 and was later rebuilt again in 1862. The Wu Temple is also known as the Martial arts temple. It is a shrine built in honor of Guan Yu, a general during the Three Kingdoms Period, who was also worshiped as the Sage of Martial Art in ancient China. This is the only place across China where a Confucius temple and a Martial art temple exist together. The temple is built in accordance of The temple covers an area of 1,033 square meters. The temple has an old stage, a rain pavilion, a principal hall, a back hall and a memorial archway. There are only two side doors in the temple and no front doors, the reason behind it is not to let the aura of the outside affect the aura of the inside. On top of each door are Chinese inscriptions, stating ‚Äì ‚ÄúLove your country and be loyal to your king. Do your best to help people‚Äù. Most of the temple‚Äôs sculptures depict dragons, phoenixes, birds and fish, and are made up of clay and wood. Inside the temple there is a stone stylobate, adorned with sculptures of flower and people. Four pillars on the top of the stylobate carry a heavy headpiece. During certain special festivals, local people sing, dance, or perform opera on the stylobate. Inside, there are depictions of two men standing next to their two horses, as tt is believed that these two horses belonged to Guan Yu and another soldier named Jiang Wei. There are also statues of two different Gods ‚Äì the one on the left is believed to bring luck and the one on the right keeps people safe. The carvings in the temple are from different ages of history The principal hall called ‚ÄúXie Tian Gong‚Äù, and houses statues of Guan Yu and his soldiers. There are also two memorial archways ‚Äì the Stone memorial archway and the Wooden memorial archway. Zhuo Wei Temple This temple is situated at about 800 meters from the Wu Temple, and commemorates Zhuo Wei, who served as an official in 999 AD. He petitioned the tax breaks, and change the land tax, advocated the establishment of schools, and the education of children. To honour him the local people raised money and build a shrine for him. This temple was built in 1478 and later rebuilt again in 1723 and spreads over an area of 1,600 square meters. The Temple has a stage, a hall, a dorm and a gate. The brackets of the have a honeycomb shape, which when grazed by an air current, makes noise. This noise acts as a natural resistant to birds and flies and prevents them from nesting there. This is considered an uncommon style of Chinese architecture. The temple's external wall consists of thousands of timbers linked together in a series. Hongyan Village Hongyan is a village within Gongcheng known as a \\"socialist model village\\". Major attractions within the village include its persimmon trees, ancient bridge, bamboo rafts, and traditional cuisine. There is no direct bus from the center of Gongcheng to Hongyan Village, however, taxi services exist in the region.

It is based on the idea that the same message accompanied by different meta-communication can mean something entirely different, including its opposite, as in irony.\\"Mind, Nature, and Consciousness: Gregory Bateson and the New Paradigm.\\" Stanislav Grof, M.D. The term was brought to prominence by Gregory Bateson to refer to \\"communication about communication\\", which he expanded to: \\"all exchanged cues and propositions about (a) codification and (b) relationship between the communicators\\".Communication: The Social Matrix of Psychiatry, Gregory Bateson, (Ruesch and Bateson, 1951, p. 209 Metacommunication may or may not be congruent, supportive or contradictory of that verbal communication.The Free Dictionary Metacommunication Origin of the concept Bateson is typically said to have invented the term, but in fact, he credits Benjamin Lee Whorf. Bateson suggested the term's significance in 1951, and then elaborated upon one particular variation, the message \\"this is play,\\" in 1956.Bateson, G. (1956). The message 'this is play.' In B. Schaffner (Ed.), Group processes: Transactions of the second conference (pp. 145-242) New York: Josiah Macy, Jr. Foundation. A critical fact for Bateson was that every message could have a metacommunicative element, and typically, each message held metacommunicative information about how to interpret other messages. He saw no distinction in type of message, only a distinction in function. Some metacommunicative signals are nonverbal. The term kinesics, referring to body motion communication and occasionally employed by Bateson, was first used by Ray Birdwhistell an anthropologist who wished to study how people communicate through posture, gesture, stance, and movement.Birdwhistell, R. L. (1952). Introduction to Kinesics: An Annotation System for Analysis of Body Motion and Gesture. Washington, DC: Department of State, Foreign Service Institute. Part of Birdwhistell's work involved filming people in social situations and analyzing them to show different levels of communication not clearly seen otherwise. Birdwhistell's research was influenced by Margaret Mead and Gregory Bateson; all three were participants in the Macy Conferences in Group Processes,Leeds-Hurwitz, W. (1994). Crossing disciplinary boundaries: The Macy Foundation Conferences on Cybernetics as a case study in multidisciplinary communication. Cybernetica: Journal of the International Association for Cybernetics, 3/4, 349-369. and both Birdwhistell and Bateson were part of a later multidisciplinary collaboration, The Natural History of an Interview.Leeds-Hurwitz, W. (1987). The social history of The Natural History of an Interview: A multidisciplinary investigation of social communication. Research on Language and Social Interaction, 20, 1-51. From 1952‚Äì1962, Bateson directed a research project on communication. This paid particular attention to logical paradoxes including Russell's paradox 1901 and to Bertrand Russell's, Theory of Types, Russell's solution to it. Bateson and his associates here pioneered the concept of meta-communication - something that means different (often contradictory) things at different levels. Meta- communication is thought to be a characteristic feature of complex systems.\\"Bateson on Communication and Meta-communication\\" Studies and areas of research=Meta-language and logic Frits Staal related the term to metalanguage concept that is found in logic both in Western and Indian traditions.\\"The concept of metalanguage and its Indian background\\" Staal Frits - Journal of Indian Philosophy 3: 315-354 (1975)\\"Bibliography on Indian Logic and Ontology\\" Theory and History of Ontology by Raul Corazzon Retrieved on 2011-11-06 Staal considered the term metalanguage, or its German or Polish equivalent, to have been introduced in 1933 by the logician Alfred Tarski, whom he credits with having made apparent its real significance.Journal of Indian Philosophy 3 (1975) 315-354 Russell's 1902 solution to his logical paradox\\"Bertrand Russell and the Paradoxes of Set Theory\\" Book Rags synopsis comes in large part from the so-called vicious circle principle, that no propositional function can be defined prior to specifying the function's scope of application. In other words, before a function can be defined, one must first specify exactly those objects to which the function will apply (the function's domain). For example, before defining that the predicate \\"is a prime number\\", one first needs to define the collection of objects that might possibly satisfy the predicate, namely the set, N, of natural numbers. \\"Significance of the paradox\\" Irvine, A. D., \\"Russell's Paradox\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Summer 2009 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.) It functions as a formal definition of the function of meta-communication in communication. Ivan Pavlov: Context as meta-signaling about primary signal Ivan Pavlov had learned that the ringing of the bell signaled \\"food is on the way\\" in his experiment in which dogs were trained to salivate upon hearing a bell ring. This was accomplished by ringing a bell just prior to feeding the dogs. After repeating this procedure for some time it was found that the dogs would salivate after hearing the bell - without the need for food being presented. Something that is not often discussed in context with this experiment is the fact that the dogs would not salivate unless they were wearing a special harness. When exposed to the bell ringing without wearing the harness, the dogs did not salivate. The dogs only salivated upon hearing the bell while wearing the harness. The bell ringing was direct communication of information, but the context of the communication also conveyed information. Communication Theory The concept of metacommunication has also been related to Communication Theory. Mateus (2017), influenced by Derrida's Graphematic Structure of Communication, suggested to see metacommunication as a self-differentiating redundancy. The concept here \\"describes communication as an ad infinitum process in which every communication supposes always more communication. Metacommunication is the answer to the relationship level of communication and that‚Äôs why we postulate metacommunication as a re-communicating communication\\" (Mateus, 2017). Self-referentiality in mass media In 2001 study, it was used to discuss self-referentiality in mass media covering politics and was explained as a consequence of the political public relations' presence in media themselves. \\"Spin Doctors in the United States, Great Britain, and Germany Metacommunication about Media Manipulation\\" - Frank Esser, Carsten Reinemann, David Fan. In: The International Journal of Press/Politics January 2001 vol. 6 no. 1, pp.16-45  Metamessage  In Bateson's works, metamessage was defined (1972) as a refinement of his earlier notion of \\"mood sign[al]\\"s from his works of the 1950s. Invoking Bertrand Russell's Theory of Logical Types, Bateson envisaged a potentially infinite hierarchy of messages, metamessages, meta-metamessages and so forth, each metamessage deterministically providing the full context for the interpretation of subordinate messages. Being rather technical, his definition was misunderstood, and metamessage appropriated with the same meaning as subtext, especially in the field of business communication. Additionally, Bateson's strictly hierarchical theory was criticized for not reflecting some real-world communication phenomena, where any signal (regardless of level) can be deceitful.

History The first state that governed the current area of Cenxi was Nanyue Kingdom, which was succeeded by Han Dynasty, which established Mengling County (ÁåõÈôµÁ∏£) on current area of Cenxi. During Southern Dynasties on A.D. 524, Yongye Commandery (Ê∞∏Ê•≠Á∏£) was established on current area of Cenxi, whereas during Sui Dynasty on A.D. 583, its administrative level was changed to County. Later in Tang Dynasty on A.D. 622, it was restructured to Nanyi Zhou (ÂçóÁæ©Â∑û), which was subdivided into 3 counties: Anyi (ÂÆâÁæ©), Longcheng (ÈæçÂüé) and Yicheng (Áæ©Âüé). On A.D. 757, Longcheng County was renamed to Cenxi County, which became the precursor of current name. During Northern Song Dynasty on A.D. 973, the aforementioned 3 counties were reintegrated into Cenxi County, and then this name was retained during subsequent dynasties and states. Geography Cenxi borders with Guangdong province and its downtown is 32 kilometres west of the boundary. It situates on Lingnan h√ºgelland, featured with mostly mountains, and its climate is characterised as humid subtropical. The municipality comprises a downtown core, several rural town hubs, and hundreds of rural villages. Agricultural fields and forests account for most of the landmasses. The region contains massive and diverse natural occurrence of granite resources. Administrative divisions Cenxi administers 14 towns: Towns: *Cencheng (Â≤ëÂüéÈïá), Malu (È©¨Ë∑ØÈïá), Nandu (ÂçóÊ∏°Èïá), Shuiwen (Ê∞¥Ê±∂Èïá), Dalong (Â§ßÈöÜÈïá), Limu (ÈªéÊú®Èïá), Daye (Â§ß‰∏öÈïá), Jinzhu (Á≠ãÁ´πÈïá), Chengjian (ÂüéË∞èÈïá), Guiyi (ÂΩí‰πâÈïá), Nuodong (Á≥ØÂûåÈïá), Anping (ÂÆâÂπ≥Èïá), Sanbao (‰∏âÂ†°Èïá), Botang (Ê≥¢Â°òÈïá) Demographics The total population at the point of 2006 was approximately 0.78 million, of which ethnic Han people account for 99.6% of the total population. By the records of household registration, 15.8% of the population are non-agricultural, and 84.2% are agricultural. Language Cenxi situates close to the westernmost edge of Cantonese-speaking area, and the great majority of local population speak a vernacular that is classified under the Goulou dialect (ÂãæÊºèÁâá), a Cantonese variety that is moderately related to standard Cantonese (i.e. Guangzhou dialect) in terms of vocabulary, grammar and phonetics, and remains largely mutually intelligible with most of the Cantonese varieties. Unlike other Cantonese-speaking major cities (e.g. Guangzhou and Nanning), Cenxi dialect continues to be the mother tongue of the majority of local residents and widely spoken on a daily basis, thanks to its low immigration and relatively isolated geography. Mandarin is the medium of instruction at schools, but only used when communicating with non-Cantonese aliens. Notable people LIANG Fangwu (Ê¢ÅÊñπ‰ºç/Ê¢ÅÂ§©Ê°Ç/Ê¢ÅÂ§©Êü±).

On April 29, 1996, the Dongxing Economic Development Zone was abolished, and the county-level city of Dongxing was established. Dongxing was granted authority over the towns of , , and . Refugees from Vietnam In the summer of 1978, the Friendship Bridge that connected Dongxing and Mong Cai in Vietnam became a makeshift refugee camp for thousands of ethnic Chinese fleeing Vietnam. Ethnic Chinese had lived in Northern Vietnam for decades under Communist rule, but after the North and South unified in April 1975, the Communist government saw the Chinese in the South, many of whom were successful capitalists and receiving political support financed by Beijing following the Vietnam War, as a threat to their socialist system and began persecuting the Chinese, forcing many to flee by boat. They became part of the known Boat People. This caused an exodus of over 250,000 Chinese from Vietnam to China, mainly to Dongxing. Geography Dongxing is located in the very south of Guangxi, on the northwest shores of the Gulf of Tonkin. The Beilun River marks the southwest border of Dongxing, with Vietnam on the other side of the river. The terrain is largely hilly.  Climate  Dongxing has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (K√∂ppen Cwa), with mild to warm winters and long, hot (but not especially) summers, and very humid conditions year-round. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July, while extremes have ranged from . Rain is both the heaviest and most frequent from June to September, when 70% of the annual rainfall also occurs. This is in contrast to the autumn and winter months, where only of rain falls per month. Administrative divisions Dongxing administers 3 towns: , , and .  Economy  The city is home to various natural resources, including titanium, manganese, quartz, granite, and various crystals. Major tourist attractions in the city include its beaches, mangrove forests, the Beilun River, and ethnic Vietnamese settlements on the islands of Wutou (), Wanwei (), and Shanxin ().

The painting portrays the 333 BC Battle of Issus, in which Alexander the Great secured a decisive victory over Darius III of Persia and gained crucial leverage in his campaign against the Persian Empire. The painting is widely regarded as Altdorfer's masterpiece, and is one of the most famous examples of the type of Renaissance landscape painting known as the world landscape, which here reaches an unprecedented grandeur. Duke William IV of Bavaria commissioned The Battle of Alexander at Issus in 1528 as part of a set of historical pieces that was to hang in his Munich residence. Modern commentators suggest that the painting, through its abundant use of anachronism, was intended to liken Alexander's heroic victory at Issus to the contemporary European conflict with the Ottoman Empire. In particular, the defeat of Suleiman the Magnificent at the Siege of Vienna may have been an inspiration for Altdorfer. A religious undercurrent is detectable, especially in the extraordinary sky; this was probably inspired by the prophecies of Daniel and contemporary concern within the Church about an impending apocalypse. The Battle of Alexander at Issus and four others that were part of William's initial set are in the Alte Pinakothek art museum in Munich.  Subject matter  Detail of Alexander the Great from the alt=A young, clean-shaven man in heavy armour sits astride a brown horse. His breastplate bears the face of the Medusa. Although his companions wear metal helms, only his short curly dark hair separates him from a deadly blow. In his right hand he grasps the shaft of a long spear. His determined face stares in sharp profile toward the right of the picture. Alexander III of Macedon (356‚Äì323 BC), best known as Alexander the Great, was an Ancient King of Macedon who reigned from 336 BC until his death. He is widely regarded as one of the greatest military tacticians and strategists in history,Corvisier; Childs, p. 21 and is presumed undefeated in battle.Heckel; Yardley, p. 299Polelle, p. 75 Renowned for his military leadership and charisma, he always led his armies personally and took to the front ranks of battle.Bryant, p. 280Neilburg, p. 10 By conquering the Persian Empire and unifying Greece, Egypt and Babylon, he forged the largest empire of the ancient worldSacks; Murray; Bunson, p. 14 and effected the spread of Hellenism throughout Europe and Northern Africa.Russell, pp. 211‚Äì12 Alexander embarked on his expedition to conquer the Persian Empire in the spring of 334 BC,Smith, p. 970 having pacified the warring Greek states and consolidated his military might.Bosworth, pp. 28‚Äì35 During the first months of the Macedonian passage into Persian Asia Minor, Darius III ‚Äì king of Persia ‚Äì largely ignored the presence of Alexander's 40,000 men. The Battle of the Granicus, fought in May, was Persia's first major effort to confront the invaders, but resulted in an easy victory for Alexander. Over the next year, Alexander took most of western and coastal Asia Minor by forcing the capitulation of the satrapies in his path.Hamilton, p. 63 He continued inland, travelling northeast through Phrygia before turning southeast toward Cilicia. After passing the Cilician Gates in October, Alexander was delayed by fever in Tarsus.Warry, p. 31 Darius meanwhile mustered an army of up to 100,000 (some ancient sources posit exaggerated figures of over 600,000)Romm; Mensch, p. 48 and personally directed it over the eastern slopes of the Amanus Mountains. In early November, as Alexander proceeded about the Gulf of Issus from Mallus via Issus, the two armies inadvertently passed one another on opposite sides of the mountains. This was decidedly to Darius' advantage: now at the rear of Alexander, he was able to prevent retreat and block the supply lines Alexander had established at Issus.Romm; Mensch, pp. 48‚Äì49 It was not until Alexander had encamped at Myriandrus, a seaport on the southeastern shores of the Gulf of ƒ∞skenderun, that he learned of the Persian position. He immediately retraced his route to the Pinarus River, just south of Issus, to find Darius' force assembled along the northern bank.Buckley, p. 503 The Battle of Issus ensued. The initial dispositions at the Battle of Issus. The Pinarus River separates the belligerents, and Issus is to the north. Cavalry is concentrated on the shores of the Gulf of ƒ∞skenderun (or Gulf of Issus) on both sides. Alexander devotes himself to a right approach with his Companion cavalry, having unseated the Persian foothill defence. Darius' initial response was defensive: he immediately stockaded the river bank with stakes to impede the enemy's crossing. A core vanguard of traitorous Greek mercenaries and Persian royal guard was established; as was usual for Persian kings, Darius positioned himself in the centre of this vanguard, in order that he might effectively dispatch commands to any part of his large army.Warry, p. 33 A group of Persian light infantry was soon sent to the foothills, as it was suspected that Alexander would make an approach from the right, away from the coast. A mass of cavalry commanded by Nabarsanes occupied the Persian right.Savill, p. 33 Alexander made a cautious and slow advance, intending to base his strategy on the structure of the Persian force. He led a flank of his Companion cavalry on the right, while the Thessalian cavalry were dispatched to the left, as a counter to Nabarsanes' mounted unit.Savill, p. 34 Aware of the importance of the foothills to his right, Alexander sent a band of light infantry, archers, and cavalry to displace the defence Darius had stationed there. The enterprise was successful ‚Äì those Persians not killed were forced to seek refuge higher in the mountains.Warry, p. 34 When within missile range of the enemy, Alexander gave the order to charge.Warry, p. 35 He spearheaded the assault of his heavily armed Companion cavalry, who quickly made deep cuts into the Persian left flank. The Macedonian left wing, commanded by Parmenion, was meanwhile driven back by Nabarsanes' large cavalry. The Macedonians' central phalanx crossed the river and clashed with the renegade Greek mercenaries who fronted Darius' vanguard. As the Companion cavalry pushed further into the Persian left, the danger arose that Darius would exploit the gap that had formed between Alexander and the rest of his army. When he was satisfied that the left wing was crippled and no longer a threat, Alexander remedied the situation by moving the Companions to assault the Persian centre in the flank. Unable to handle the added pressure, the Persian vanguard was forced to withdraw from the river bank, allowing the Macedonian phalanx to continue their advance and lifting the pressure on Parmenion's left wing. Upon realising that the onslaught of Alexander's Companion cavalry was unstoppable, Darius and his army fled. Many were killed in the rush, trampled by those who fled with them or collapsed with their horses.Warry, p. 36 Some escaped to regions as remote as Egypt, and others reunited with Darius in the north.Savill, p. 35 The onset of darkness ended the chase after approximately ; Alexander then recalled his army and set about burying the dead. Darius' family were left behind in the Persian camp; it is reported that Alexander treated them well and reassured them of Darius' safety.Warry, pp. 37‚Äì38 Darius' royal chariot was found discarded in a ditch, as were his bow and shield. Ancient sources present disparate casualty figures for the Battle of Issus. Plutarch and Diodorus Siculus approximate 100,000 Persian deaths, in contrast with the 450 Macedonian deaths reported by Quintus Curtius Rufus.De S√©lincourt, p. 121 In any case, it is probable that more Persians were killed as they fled than in battle;Warry, p. 37 Ptolemy I, who served with Alexander during the battle, recounts how the Macedonians crossed a ravine on the bodies of their enemies during the pursuit.Romm; Mensch, p. 54 The Macedonian conquest of Persia continued until 330 BC, when Darius was killed and Alexander took his title as king.Sacks; Murray; Bunson, p. 17 Alexander died in 323 BC, having recently returned from campaigning in the Indian subcontinent. The cause of death remains a subject of debate.Heckel, p. 84  Background = Previous work  Saint George and the Dragon (1510) Albrecht Altdorfer is regarded as one of the founders of Western landscape art.Keane, p. 165 He was a painter, etcher, architect, and engraver, and the leader of the Danube school of German art. As evidenced by such paintings as Saint George and the Dragon (1510) and Allegory (1531), much of Altdorfer's work is characterised by an attachment to sprawling landscapes that dwarf the figures within them;Clark, p. 38 The Battle of Alexander at Issus epitomises this facet of his style. With reference to St George and the Dragon in particular, art historian Mark W. Roskill comments that \\"The accessory material of landscape [in Altdorfer's work] is played with and ornamentally elaborated so that it reverberates with the sense of a sequestered and inhospitable environment\\".Roskill, p. 65 Inspired by his travels around the Austrian Alps and the Danube River,Earls, p. 81 Altdorfer painted a number of landscapes that contain no figures at all, including Landscape with a Footbridge (c. 1516) and Danube Landscape near Regensburg (c. 1522‚Äì25). These were the first \\"pure\\" landscapes since antiquity.Wood, p. 9 Most of Altdorfer's landscapes were made with a vertical format, in contrast with the modern conception of the genre. The horizontal landscape was an innovation of Altdorfer's Flemish contemporary Joachim Patinir and his followers.Wood, p. 47 alt=A miniature painting showing four brightly clothed men carrying a large banner which is painted with a complex battle scene Altdorfer also produced a great deal of religious artwork, in reflection of his devout Catholicism. His most frequent subjects were the Virgin Mary and the life and crucifixion of Christ. As in The Battle of Alexander at Issus, these paintings often feature settings of great majesty and use the sky to convey symbolic meaning. This meaning is not uniform throughout Altdorfer's corpus ‚Äì for example, the visage of the setting sun connotes loss and tragedy in Agony in the Garden, but serves as \\"the emblem of power and glory\\" in The Battle of Alexander at Issus.Silver, pp. 204‚Äì205 Larry Silver of The Art Bulletin explains that The Battle of Alexander at Issus is both similar to and in direct contrast with Altdorfer's previous work: \\"Instead of the peaceful landscape of retreat for Christian events or holy figures, this panel offers just the opposite: a battleground for one of ancient history's principal epoch-making encounters ... Yet despite its global or cosmic dimensions, the Battle of Issus still looks like Altdorfer's earlier, contemplative liminal landscapes of retreat, complete with craggy peaks, bodies of water, and distant castles.\\"Silver, p. 204 Although the Battle of Alexander is atypical of Altdorfer in its size and in that it depicts war, his Triumphal Procession ‚Äì a 1512‚Äì16 illuminated manuscript commissioned by Maximilian I of the Holy Roman Empire ‚Äì has been described as a conceptual antecedent.Wood, pp. 23, 199‚Äì202 The Procession was produced in parallel with the Triumph of Maximilian, a series of 137 woodcuts collaboratively executed by Altdorfer, Hans Springinklee, Albrecht D√ºrer, Leonhard Beck and Hans Sch√§ufelein.Cuneo, p. 99  Influences and commission  Matthias Gr√ºnewald's The Virgin and Child with the Heavenly Host (c. 1515) Altdorfer's most significant contemporary influence was Matthias Gr√ºnewald (c. 1470‚Äì1528). Art historian Horst W. Janson remarked that their paintings \\"show the same 'unruly' imagination\\".Janson, p. 393 Elements of The Battle of Alexander at Issus ‚Äì particularly the sky ‚Äì have been compared to Gr√ºnewald's Heavenly Host above the Virgin and Child, which forms part of his masterpiece, the Isenheim Altarpiece. Lucas Cranach the Elder (1472‚Äì1553), also associated with the Danube school, was another important influence for Altdorfer. According to Roskill, works by Cranach from about 1500 \\"give a prominent role to landscape settings, using them as mood-enhancing backgrounds for portraits, and for images of hermits and visionary saints\\", and seem to play a \\"preparatory role\\" for the onset of pure landscape.Roskill, pp. 64‚Äì65 Altdorfer owed much of his style, particularly in his religious artwork, to Albrecht D√ºrer (1471‚Äì1528);Wood, pp. 70‚Äì73 Larry Silver writes that Altdorfer's \\"use of convincing German landscapes in combination with celestial phenomena for his religious narrative\\" is \\"firmly tied\\" to a tradition \\"modeled by Albrecht D√ºrer.\\"Silver, p. 209 William IV, Duke of Bavaria commissioned The Battle of Alexander at Issus in 1528.Davis, p. 91 Altdorfer was approximately 50 at the time, and was living in the Free Imperial City of Regensburg.Hagen; Hagen, p. 128 As a result of over a decade of involvement with the Regensburg city council, Altdorfer was offered the position of Burgomaster on 18 September 1528. He declined; the council annals reported his reasoning as such: \\"He much desires to execute a special work in Bavaria for my Serene Highness and gracious Lord, Duke [William].\\" William probably wanted the painting for his newly built summer Lusthaus (\\"pleasure house\\") in the grounds of his palace in Munich, approximately south of Regensburg.Alte Pinakotek, p. 28 There, it was to hang alongside seven other paintings with a similar format and subject matter, including Ludwig Refinger's The Matyrdom of Marcus Curtius, Melchior Feselen's The Siege of Alesia by Caesar, and the painting of Battle of Cannae by Hans Burgkmair (1473‚Äì1531).Ansell, p. 4Hagen; Hagen, p. 131 Another eight, each portraying a famous woman from history, were later added to the set, probably at the behest of the Duke's wife, Jacobaea of Baden. Altdorfer's Susanna and the Elders (1526) was among these.Clanton, p. 142  Earlier depictions  The Alexander Mosaic, as seen in the Naples National Archaeological Museum Earlier depictions of the Battle of Issus are few. Battle of Issus, a fresco by Philoxenus of Eretria, is probably the first such. It was painted sometime around 310 BC for Cassander (c. 350‚Äì297 BC), who was one of Alexander the Great's successors.Kleiner 2009, p. 142 Alexander and Darius ‚Äì each within a lance's length of the other ‚Äì are pictured among a wild fray of mounted and downed soldiers. While Alexander maintains an aura of unshaken confidence, fear is etched in Darius' face, and his charioteer has already turned to rein his horses and escape. Roman author and natural philosopher Pliny the Elder claimed that Philoxenus' portrayal of the battle was \\"inferior to none\\". Some modern critics posit that Battle of Issus might not have been the work of Philoxenus, but of Helena of Egypt. One of the few named women painters who might have worked in Ancient Greece,Stokstad; Oppenheimer; Addiss, p. 134Summers, p. 41 she was reputed to have produced a painting of the battle of Issus which hung in the Temple of Peace during the time of Vespasian.Ptolemy Hephaestion New History (codex 190) Bibliotheca Photius The Alexander Mosaic, a floor mosaic dating from c. 100 BC, is believed to be a \\"reasonably faithful\\" copy of Battle of Issus, though an alternative view holds it might instead be a copy of a work painted by Apelles of Kos,Kinzl, p. 476 who produced several portraits of Alexander the Great.Campbell, p. 51 It measures , and consists of approximately 1.5 million tesserae (coloured tiles), each about square. The mosaicist is unknown. Since the mosaic was not rediscovered until 1831, during excavations of Pompeii's House of the Faun,McKay, p. 144 Altdorfer could never have seen it. It was later moved to the Naples National Archaeological Museum in Naples, Italy, where it currently resides.  Painting = Description  alt=A figure on a chariot pulled by three horses, with soldiers on either side of the trail The Battle of Alexander at Issus is painted on a limewood panel measuring , and portrays the moment of Alexander the Great's victory. The vertical format was dictated by the space available in the room for which the painting was commissioned ‚Äì each in William's set of eight was made to be the same size. At an unknown date, the panel was cut down on all sides, particularly at the top, so the sky was originally larger and the moon further from the corner of the scene. The scene is approached from an impossible viewpoint ‚Äì at first only feet from the fray, the perspective gradually ascends to encompass the seas and continents in the background and eventually the curvature of the Earth itself.Wood, p. 201Kleiner 2008, p. 510 Thousands of horse and foot soldiers immersed in a sea of spears and lances populate the foreground. The two armies are distinguished by their dress, anachronistic though it is: whereas Alexander's men clad themselves and their horses in full suits of heavy armour, many of Darius' wear turbans and ride naked mounts. The bodies of the many fallen soldiers lie underfoot. A front of Macedonian warriors in the centre pushes against the crumbling enemy force, who flee the battlefield on the far left. The Persian king joins his army on his chariot of three horses, and is narrowly pursued by Alexander and his uniformly attired Companion cavalry. The tract of soldiers continues down the gently sloped battlefield to the campsite and cityscape by the water, gravitating toward the mountainous rise at the scene's centre. Beyond is the Mediterranean Sea and the island of Cyprus.Hagen; Hagen, p. 132 Here, a transition in hue is made, from the browns that prevail in the lower half of the painting to the aquas that saturate the upper half. The Nile River meanders in the far distance, emptying its seven arms into the Mediterranean at the Nile Delta. South of Cyprus is the Sinai Peninsula, which forms a land bridge between Africa and Southwest Asia. The Red Sea lies beyond, eventually merging ‚Äì as the mountain ranges to its left and right do ‚Äì with the curved horizon. alt=A blazing sun above blue-tinged mountains and water A fierce sky caught in the dichotomy between the setting sun and the crescent moon dominates more than a third of the painting.Hagen; Hagen, p. 133 The rain-heavy clouds swirling ominously around each celestial entity are separated by a gulf of calmness, intensifying the contrast and infusing the heavens with an unearthly glow.Clark, p. 41 Light from the sky spills onto the landscape: while the western continent and the Nile are bathed in the sun's light, the east and the Tower of Babel are cloaked in shadow. The painting's subject is explained in the tablet suspended from the heavens. The wording, probably supplied by William's court historian Johannes Aventinus,Wood, pp. 21‚Äì22 was originally in German but was later replaced by a Latin inscription. It translates: > Alexander the Great defeating the last Darius, after 100,000 infantry and > more than 10,000 cavalrymen had been killed amongst the ranks of the > Persians. Whilst King Darius was able to flee with no more than 1,000 > horsemen, his mother, wife, and children were taken prisoner. No date is provided for the battle alongside these casualty figures. The lower left-hand corner features Altdorfer's monogram ‚Äì an 'A' within an 'A' ‚Äì and the lower edge of the tablet is inscribed with \\"ALBRECHT ALTORFER ZU REGENSPVRG FECIT\\" (\\"Albrecht Altdorfer from Regensburg made [this]\\"). Tiny inscriptions on their chariot and harness identify Darius and Alexander, respectively. Each army bears a banner that reports both its total strength and its future casualties.Hagen; Hagen, p. 130  Analysis and interpretation  Detail of soldiers from both armies. Reinhart Koselleck comments that the Persians resemble the 16th-century Turks \\"from their feet to their turbans.\\" alt=Small figures of women on the battlefield, all with long red hair and all wearing feathered toques Anachronism is a major component of The Battle of Alexander at Issus. By dressing Alexander's men in 16th-century steel armour and Darius' men in Turkish battle dress, Altdorfer draws deliberate parallels between the Macedonian campaign and the contemporary European‚ÄìOttoman conflict.Janson; Janson, p. 544 In 1529 ‚Äì the year of the painting's commissioning ‚Äì the Ottoman forces under Suleiman the Magnificent laid siege to the Austrian city of Vienna, then also the capital of the Holy Roman Empire and called 'the golden apple' by the Sultans. Although far inferior in number, the Austrian, German, Czech, and Spanish soldiers marshalled to defend Vienna were able to force the enemy into a retreat and stall the Ottoman advance on central Europe. It is probable the painting's underlying allegory was inspired by the siege of Vienna, given its similarities to Alexander's victory at Issus. Some critics go further, suggesting that the inclusion of anachronism may have been an element of Altdorfer's commission. In his Futures Past: On the Semantics of Historical Time, historian Reinhart Koselleck discusses Altdorfer's representation of time in a more philosophical light. After differentiating between the superficial anachronism found in the casualty figures on the army banners and the deeper anachronism ingrained in the painting's contemporary context, he posits that the latter type is less a superimposition of one historical event over another and more an acknowledgement of the recursive nature of history. With reference to Koselleck, Kathleen Davis argues: \\"... for [Altdorfer], 4th-century Persians look like 16th-century Turks not because he does not know the difference, but because the difference does not matter ... The Alexanderschlacht, in other words, exemplifies a premodern, untemporalized sense of time and a lack of historical consciousness ... Altdorfer's historical overlays evince an eschatological vision of history, evidence that the 16th century (and by degrees also the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries) remained locked in a static, constant temporality that proleptically saturates the future as always a repetition of the same ... In such a system there can be no event as such: anticipation and arrival are together sucked into the black hole of sacred history, which is not temporalized because its time is essentially undifferentiated ...\\"Davis, pp. 91‚Äì92 alt=A steep mountain, upon which are built fortifications alt=An island, and a cityscape featuring church towers Featured alongside the anachronism in The Battle of Alexander at Issus is a genuine lack of historicity. Altdorfer demonstrates minimal hesitance in neglecting the painting's historical integrity for the sake of its heroic style, in spite of the pains he took to research the battle. That the Persian army was up to twice the size of the Macedonian army is not clear, and the relative positioning of the soldiers as reported by ancient sources has been disregarded. According to art critic Rose-Marie Hagen, \\"The artist was faithful to the historical truth only when it suited him, when historical facts were compatible with the demands of his composition.\\" Hagen also notes the placement of women on the battlefield, attributing it to Altdorfer's \\"passion for invention\\", since the wife of Darius, his mother and his daughters were waiting for Darius back at the camp, not in the thick of battle.Quintus Curtius Rufus, III.12.24 True to form, however, Altdorfer made the aristocratic ladies \\"look like German courtly ladies, dressed for a hunting party\\" in their feathered toques: Altdorfer's primary point of reference in his research was probably Hartmann Schedel's Nuremberg Chronicle (Schedelsche Weltchronik), an illustrated world history published in Nuremberg in 1493. Schedel was a physician, humanist, historian and cartographer, and his Chronicle was one of the first books produced on the printing press. With a heavy reliance on the Bible, it recounts the seven ages of human history,Oman, p. 116 from Creation to the birth of Christ and ending with the Apocalypse.Hanawalt; Kobialka, p. 224 Altdorfer's statistics for the battle of Issus mirror those of Schedel. Furthermore, the errors in Schedel's maps of the Mediterranean and Northern Africa are also present in The Battle of Alexander at Issus: the island of Cyprus is noticeably oversized, and both the mountain rise in the painting's centre and the range adjacent to the Nile do not exist. Since the Chronicle describes Alexander's victory over the Persians in terms of its proximity to Tarsus and omits mention of Issus, it is likely that the cityscape by the sea is intended to be the former city rather than the latter. Issus in the 16th century was minor and relatively unknown, whereas Tarsus was renowned for its having been a major centre of learning and philosophy in Roman times. Tarsus was also said to be the birthplace of the Apostle Paul, which may explain the presence of the church towers in Altdorfer's portrayal. Another source may have been the writings of Quintus Curtius Rufus, a 1st-century Roman historian who presents inflated figures for the number of killed and taken prisoner and the sizes of the armies. The sky bears overt metaphorical significance and is the centrepiece of the painting's symbolism. Alexander, identified by the Egyptians and others as a god of the sun, finds his victory in the sun's rays; and the Persians are routed into the darkness beneath the crescent moon, a symbol of the Near East.Kleiner 2009, p. 511 Considered in terms of the painting's contemporary context, the sun's triumph over the moon represents Christendom's victory over the Islamism of the Ottomans. Eschatological meaning, probably inspired by prophecies in the Book of Daniel, is imbued in the heavenly setting. In particular, Daniel 7 predicts the rise and fall of four kingdoms before the Second Coming; these were thought to be Babylon, Persia, Greece, and Rome at the time of the painting's creation. Altdorfer saw the Battle of Issus as a principal indicator of the transition of power from Persia to Greece, and thus as an event of cosmic significance. The battle also marked a progression toward the end of the world ‚Äì an important theological concern in the 16th century, given that the last traces of Rome were diminishing with the papacy. As a member of the Regensburg council and a practising Catholic, Altdorfer frequently interacted with the Church and was surely aware of this trend of eschatological thought. Schedel, too, had calculated that the final age of the seven he identified was nigh. It may therefore be inferred that the sky's expression of the momentous event at Issus was intended to be of contemporary relevance as well.  Legacy  Susannah and the Elders (1526), the only other painting by Altdorfer in the Alte Pinakothek The Battle of Alexander at Issus remained part of the royal collection of the Dukes of Bavaria for centuries. By the late 18th century, it was regularly featured in public galleries at the Schleissheim Palace. The painting was one of 72 taken to Paris in 1800 by the invading armies of Napoleon I (1769‚Äì1821),Alte Pinakothek, pp. 24‚Äì29 who was a noted admirer of Alexander the Great.Clark, p. 40 The Louvre held it until 1804, when Napoleon declared himself Emperor of France and took it for his own use. When the Prussians captured the Ch√¢teau de Saint-Cloud in 1814 as part of the War of the Sixth Coalition, they supposedly found the painting hanging in Napoleon's bathroom.Wood, p. 22 The Battle of Alexander at Issus and 26 others taken in the 1800 invasion were subsequently restored to the King of Bavaria in 1815. Five of the paintings in William IV's original set of eight ‚Äì including The Battle of Alexander at Issus ‚Äì later passed from the royal collection to the Alte Pinakothek art museum in Munich, Germany, where they remain; the other three are in the National Museum of Fine Arts in Stockholm, having been looted by the Swedish army in the Thirty Years War of 1618‚Äì1648.Svanberg, pp. 70‚Äì86 Susannah and the Elders is the only other work by Altdorfer in the Alte Pinakothek. Horatius Cocles Stopping King Porsenna's Army outside Rome, by Ludwig Refinger. From the same historical cycle that The Battle of Alexander at Issus originally belonged to.Contextually, the painting forms part of the Northern Renaissance, a resurgence of classical humanism and culture in northern Europe during the 15th and 16th centuries. The Renaissance induced a new kind of social individualism which Altdorfer expressed through the heroic emphasis on Alexander and Darius, and which is reflected in the specifics of the painting's commission and by the subjects of its companion pieces: \\"During the Renaissance people no longer saw themselves solely as members of a social group, as the citizens of a town, or as sinners before God in whose eyes all were equal. They had become aware of the unique qualities that distinguished one person from another. Unlike the Middle Ages, the Renaissance celebrated the individual. Altdorfer may have painted row after row of apparently identical warriors, but the spectators themselves would identify with Alexander and Darius, figures who had names, whose significance was indicated by the cord which hung down from the tablet above them.\\" Altdorfer was not only a pioneer of landscape, but also a practitioner of early incarnations of the Romanticism and expressionism which impacted the arts so greatly in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. Kenneth Clark writes of Altdorfer and contemporaries Gr√ºnewald and Bosch, \\"They are what we now call 'expressionist' artists, a term which is not as worthless as it sounds, because, in fact, the symbols of expressionism are remarkably consistent, and we find in the work of these early 16th-century landscape painters not only the same spirit but the same shapes and iconographical motives which recur in the work of such recent expressionists as van Gogh, Max Ernst, Graham Sutherland and Walt Disney.\\"Clark, p. 36 According to art critic Pia F. Cuneo, \\"Altdorfer's construction of landscape on a cosmic scale\\" in the Battle of Alexander at Issus, and his \\"spiritual and aesthetic affinities with Romanticism and Modern art (in particular, German Expressionism)\\", \\"have been especially singled out for praise\\".Cuneo, p. 186 The Battle of Alexander at Issus is typically considered to be Altdorfer's masterpiece. Cuneo states that the painting is usually \\"considered in splendid isolation from its fifteen other companion pieces, based on the assumption that it either metonymically stands in for the entire cycle, or that its perceived aesthetic predominance merits exclusive focus.\\" German writer Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel (1772‚Äì1829) was one of many who saw the painting in the Louvre and marvelled, calling it a \\"small painted Iliad\\".

People might assume I was promoting promiscuity, and not get the point.\\" The song, which deals with incest in one stanza, \\"is a statement,\\" according to Rose, \\"but it's actually more of a question. I have known a Christian who had been sexually molested when she was younger and I had heard how this created all these emotional scars in her.\\" He went on to say, \\"In the song I talk about the bad side of sex as it's been misused in our world, and in the last verse I go back to the idea that it's given by God...sex is a wonderful thing if it follows God's rules -- which is purity before marriage, fidelity after marriage -- where sex gets God's blessing.\\" Nonetheless, because of that song, some of the band's albums were not sold at some Christian bookstores.

It was introduced in the 2009 Budget. Until 28 February 2011, there were two rates of tax, ‚Ç¨10 for each passenger flying to an airport more than 300 km (186 miles) from Dublin Airport, and ‚Ç¨2 per passenger flying to any other airport within 300 km (186 miles). As the differential rate was considered by the EU to be an interference with the internal market, this was changed to a flat rate of ‚Ç¨3 from 1 March 2011. The tax was opposed by airlines and the tourism industry. Transit passengers are excluded. Initially the ‚Ç¨10 tax was going to cover all flights over 300 km (186 miles), but this would have disadvantaged non-Dublin airports. Smaller airports are also excepted, of which only one has any scheduled flights to begin with; as are planes with fewer than 20 passenger seats. It was abolished in April 2014.

He was emeritus Regius Professor of Modern History, University of Cambridge, having occupied the chair from 1988 to 1996. He once described himself as \\"an early modernist with a prime interest in the history of England in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries.\\" Life Collinson was born in Ipswich, the son of William Cecil Collinson and Belle Hay Patrick. His father came from a Yorkshire Quaker family, and both Patrick's parents were Christian missionaries. He later wrote that his childhood home was \\"an evangelical hothouse where the second coming was expected daily\\".Alexandra Walsham, Collinson, Patrick (1929‚Äì2011), Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, January 2015. Retrieved 7 June 2015. Before he was 20, he was baptised at Bethesda Chapel in Ipswich. After a short spell at Goudhurst School for Boys and Huntingdon Grammar School, Collinson was educated at King's School, Ely, and Pembroke College, Cambridge from 1949 to 1952. He was also trained as a radar mechanic during his national service in the RAF. He became a postgraduate student at the University of London in 1952 under the supervision of the Tudor historian J. E. Neale, who handed him some notes on East Anglian Puritanism; in 1957 Collinson completed his doctorate on Elizabethan Puritanism, its 1,200-page size causing the administration to impose a word limit on future dissertations; it was published in 1967 as The Elizabethan Puritan Movement, which showed Puritanism to be a significant force within the Elizabethan Anglican Church instead of merely a radical group of individuals, becoming a standard work. Collinson was a lecturer at the University of Khartoum, and from 1961 assistant lecturer in ecclesiastical history at King's College London (where he taught Desmond Tutu). In 1960 he married Elizabeth Albinia Susan Selwyn, a nurse. He thought about becoming an Anglican minister but in the end chose not to. In 1969 Collinson emigrated to Australia to become chair of the history department of Sydney University. Although he appreciated a more open-minded approach favouring interdisciplinary studies, he opposed what he termed the \\"fungus\\" of postmodernism and so returned to England in 1976 as professor of history at the University of Kent. He was President of the Ecclesiastical History Society (1985-86). He was chair of modern history at the University of Sheffield from 1984 to 1988 before he succeeded Sir Geoffrey Elton as Cambridge Regius Professor of History , where his attempt to reform the tripos failed due to opposition from within; his inaugural lecture was entitled \\"De Republica Anglorum: Or, History with the Politics Put Back.\\" By the time of his retirement in 1996, Collinson was one of the doyens of English Reformation history. His short summation of the period, The Reformation, was published in 2003. Collinson's work laid the foundations, in many ways, for what historians of the English Reformation currently term the 'Calvinist Consensus' in the latter decades of the 16th century and during the reign of James I/VI. As such, the belief that Puritanism was anything but religiously radical in relation to English, and indeed British, culture stands as one of his great achievements as an historian. In July 2000 Collinson was awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Essex. In 2011 Boydell Press published Collinson's memoir The History of a History Man Or, the Twentieth Century Viewed from a Safe Distance: The Memoirs of Patrick Collinson as part of its Church of England Record Society Series. Collinson was the founding president of the society in 1991. Collinson's political views were left-wing; he was a republican and a supporter of the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament.

The name Takthok, literally meaning 'rock-roof' was named because both its roof as well as walls are made up of rock. It belongs to the Nyingma tradition of Tibetan Buddhism and approximately 55 lamas reside there. It is the only Nyingma monastery in Ladakh.Rizvi (1996), p. 218. The monastery was founded around the mid-16th century during the reign of Tshewang Namgyal on a mountainside around a cave in which Padmasambhava is said to have meditated in the 8th century.Rizvi (1996), p. 235. Every year on the 9th and 10th day of the sixth month of the Tibetan calendar, celebrations which include sacred dances are held. Description The main temple is very dark and gloomy with a low ceiling of rock completely covered with the residue from centuries of butterlamps having been burned there. The paintings that once adorned the walls are covered with grime and even the floor feels sticky. Further down another cave has been turned into a kitchen which has immense stoves capable of producing enough food for all the pilgrims who arrive for the annual festival (which has been shifted to the summer months to accommodate tourists).Rizvi (1996), p. 232. The Assembly Hall, or du-khang's verandah, has paintings of the Four Lords, while the walls have recent paintings of fierce protector divinities some of which adorn the verandah entrance. The du-khang also contains statues of Maitreya, Padmasambhava and his manifestation Dorje Takposal. A new temple was consecrated by the 14th Dalai Lama in 1980 just below the main gompa complex.Rizvi (1996), pp. 235-236. The wall to the left of the throne in this temple is decorated with the mural of Padmasambhava, and the one on the left has a painting of Sakyamuni. To the left of the central courtyard is the cave chapel and images of Padmasambhava and Avalokitesvara stand opposite. A small cave behind them is believed to be the place where Padmasambhava lived and meditated for three years. The monastery also has the 108 volumes of the Kanjur of Buddha's teachings.

Prior to his installation as the archbishop of the Twin Cities, Hebda had served as both the Apostolic Administrator of that archdiocese since June 2015, as well as the Coadjutor Archbishop of the Archdiocese of Newark since September 2013. Before that, he was the Bishop of the Diocese of Gaylord from 2009-2013, as well as in the Roman Curia on the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts. Besides English, he speaks Italian and knows Latin, French, and Spanish. Early life and education Hebda was born in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1959 in the community of Brookline. He attended South Hills Catholic High School (now Seton-La Salle Catholic High School), and then attended Harvard University, where he earned a BA in political science in 1980. He earned a JD from Columbia Law School at the Parker School of Foreign and Comparative Law in 1983. He entered the seminary and studied philosophy at the Saint Paul Seminary in Pittsburgh from 1984 to 1985. He lived at the Pontifical North American College in Rome and attended the Pontifical Gregorian University, where he earned a Bachelor of Sacred Theology (1985‚Äì1988) and a licentiate in Canon Law (1988‚Äì1990). Priesthood On July 1, 1989, he was ordained a priest for the Diocese of Pittsburgh, where he held the following positions: assistant priest at the Purification of the Blessed Virgin Mary Parish in Ellwood City (1989), personal secretary to Bishop Donald Wuerl and Master of Ceremonies (1990‚Äì1992), and pastor in solidum at the Prince of Peace Parish in Pittsburgh (South Side) (1992‚Äì1995), Judge of the Diocesan Tribunal (1992‚Äì1996), and Director of the Newman Center at Slippery Rock University (1995‚Äì1996). He worked in Rome at the Pontifical Council for Legislative Texts beginning on September 10, 1996. On February 16, 2000, he was named a monsignor. From 2003 he served as under-secretary of the Pontifical Council. In Rome, Hebda was also an adjunct spiritual director at the Pontifical North American College and confessor to the Missionaries of Charity. He lived at the Villa Stritch, a residence for American priests working for the Holy See. On October 16, 2009, following the announcement of his appointment as a bishop, the community at the Pontifical North American College presented him with a pectoral cross and crosier.  Episcopacy =Diocese of Gaylord Bishop = On October 7, 2009, Pope Benedict XVI named Hebda the fourth Bishop of Gaylord, Michigan. Hebda was consecrated to the episcopate and installed in the Diocese on December 1, 2009, at Saint Mary, Our Lady of Mount Carmel Cathedral. In November 2013, Hebda was elected to chair the Committee on Canonical Affairs and Church Governance of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB). Archdiocese of Newark Coadjutor Archbishop = Hebda was appointed as Coadjutor Archbishop of Newark on September 24, 2013, where Archbishop John Myers said he had asked for the appointment of someone to assist him as he approached retirement age. Hebda chose a dormitory at Seton Hall University as his residence. He defended Myers against complaints he had spent an extravagant amount on living quarters for his retirement, noting he had lived in shared quarters at the cathedral rectory in Newark for thirteen years.  Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis Apostolic Administrator = Hebda in 2017 On June 15, 2015, Pope Francis accepted the resignations of Archbishop John Clayton Nienstedt and Auxiliary Bishop Lee A. Pich√© of Archdiocese of Saint Paul and Minneapolis, who cited the provision of Canon Law that advises the resignation of a bishop who \\"become[s] less able to fulfill his office because of ill health or some other grave cause\\". The same day Pope Francis appointed Hebda its Apostolic Administrator to serve until a new archbishop would be installed, although Hebda remained as the Coadjutor Archbishop of Newark. In September Hebda met with representatives of the Minnesota chapter of the Catholic Coalition for Church Reform, a group his predecessor had not been warm to. They discussed how the laity could participate in defining the needs of the archdiocese and what it expects from its next archbishop. Hebda \\"was delighted to learn that they share my interest in engaging in a wide consultation of the faithful in assessing the needs of the archdiocese\\" and \\"I was also happy to share with them some of the preliminary plans for that consultation, and appreciated their input and offer of collaboration.\\" He organized a series of public meetings ‚Äì \\"listening sessions\\" ‚Äì throughout the diocese to allow Catholic parishioners, clergy, and employees to express their views on the appointment of a new archbishop. During his term as administrator, the Archdiocese reached agreement on a civil settlement with officials of Ramsey County on procedures to prevent child sexual abuse. It provided for judicial oversight for three years. The civil case was settled in December under a plan that allowed for more oversight of the church. Attorneys for both sides used the hearing process in the civil case to announce new steps aimed at reinforcing that agreement. \\"The Archdiocese admits that it failed to adequately respond and prevent the sexual abuse\\" of the three victims, the archdiocese said in papers filed in Ramsey County Court. \\"The Archdiocese failed to keep the safety and wellbeing of these three children ahead of protecting the interests of Curtis Wehmeyer and the Archdiocese. The actions and omissions of the Archdiocese failed to prevent the abuse that resulted in the need for protection and services for these three children.\\" In a letter to Catholics in the archdiocese Hebda wrote: \\"We are agreeing to implement the plan under a set deadline and to be held accountable for that commitment.\\" He called the settlement \\"the most public indicator that this archdiocese has earnestly embarked on a journey of self-reflection, evaluation and action\\". In his time as administrator, less than a year, he handled a number of cases of priests charged with sexual abuse of minors, both removing and reinstating them. = Archbishop = On March 24, 2016, he was named Archbishop of Saint Paul and Minneapolis, at which point his appointment as Coadjutor Archbishop of Newark ended. He was installed in the Cathedral of Saint Paul on May 13, 2016.

Description The Pe'a covers the body from waist to the knees. The word tattoo in the English language is believed to have originated from the Samoan word \\"\\". The process for the Pe'a is extremely painful, and undertaken by (master tattooists), using a set of handmade tools: pieces of bone, turtle shell and wood. The are revered masters in Samoan society. In Samoan custom, a Pe'a is only done the traditional way, with aspects of cultural ceremony and ritual, and has a strong meaning for the one who receives it. The works with two assistants, called , who are often apprentice tattooists and they stretch the skin, wipe the excess ink and blood and generally support the tattooist in their work. The process takes place with the subject lying on mats on the floor with the tattooist and assistants beside them. Family members of the person getting the tattoo are often in attendance at a respectful distance to provide words of encouragement, sometimes through song. The Pe'a can take less than a week to complete, or, in some cases, years. The ink colour is black. The tattoo starts on the back and finishes on the belly button. Overall, the design is symmetrical with a pattern consisting mainly of straight lines and larger blocks of dark cover, usually around the thighs. Some art experts have made a comparison between the distinctive Samoan tattoo patterns to other artforms including designs on tapa cloth and Lapita pottery. Traditional Samoan tattooing of the Pe'a, body tattoo, is an ordeal that is not lightly undergone. It can take many weeks to complete, is very painful and used to be a necessary prerequisite to receiving a title; this however is no longer the case. Tattooing was also a very costly procedure, the tattooer receiving in the region of 700 fine mats as payment. It was not uncommon for half a dozen boys to be tattooed at the same time, requiring the services of four or more tattooers. It was not just the men who received tattoos, but the women too, although their designs are of a much lighter nature, resembling a filigree rather than having the large areas of solid dye which are frequently seen in men's tattoos. Nor was the tattooing of women as ritualised as that of the men. Lama Better known by its Hawaiian name, , the oily kernel of the husked candlenut, known in Samoan as or , is burned and the black soot collected is used as the color base for the traditional ink used in Samoan tattooing. The modern artists utilize commercially produced inks that comply with international tattoo regulations and local health safety codes. Societal significance Samoan males with a Pe'a are called and are respected for their courage. Untattooed Samoan males are colloquially referred to as or , literally \\"naked\\". Those who begin the tattooing ordeal but do not complete it due to the pain, or more rarely the inability to adequately pay the tattooist, are called , a mark of shame. The traditional female tattoo in Samoa is the Malu. In Samoan society, the Pe'a and the Malu are viewed with cultural pride and identity as well as a hallmark of manhood and womanhood. ' is an ancient Polynesian art form which is associated with the rites of passage for men. Pe'a is also the Samoan word for the flying fox (fruit bat, Pteropus samoensis), and there are many Polynesian myths, proverbs and legends associated with this winged creature. One legend from the island of Savai'i is about Nafanua, Samoa's goddess of war, rescued by flying foxes when she was stranded on an inhospitable island. Origins In Polynesia, the origins of tattoo is varied. Samoa credit Fiti as the source of the , the Fijians credit the Samoans, and the MƒÅori of New Zealand credit the underworld. In Samoan mythology, the origin of the in Samoa is told in a myth about twin sisters Tilafaiga and Taema who swam from Fiti (as in Fitiuta, Manu'a) to Samoa with a basket of tattoo tools. As they swam they sang a song which said only women get tattooed. But as they neared the village of Falealupo on the island of Savai'i, they saw a clam underwater and dived down to get it. When they emerged, their song had changed, the lyrics now saying that only men get the tattoo and not women. This song is known in Samoa as the or . Thomas Andrew The word has many meanings in Samoa. means to strike, and in the case of tattooing, the tap tap sound of the tattooist's wooden tools. means to reach an end, a conclusion, as well as war or battle. also means rightness or balance. It also means to wring moisture from something, like wet cloth, or in the case of the pe'a process, the ink from the skin. means to strike repeatedly or perform a rhythm. For example, means 'play the ukulele.' Implements The tools of the comprise a set of serrated bone combs (), which were lashed to small tortoise shell fragments which were in turn lashed to a short wooden handle; a tapping mallet () for driving the combs into the skin; coconut shell cups () to mix and store the tattooing ink (\\"lama\\") made from burnt candlenut soot; and lengths of tapa cloth (\\"solo\\") used to wipe blood and clean tools. The tools are traditionally stored in a cylindrical wooden container called \\"tunuma\\" which are lined with tapa cloth and designed to hold the 'au vertically with the delicate combs facing the center of the cylinder to prevent damage. The \\"sausau\\" mallet was shaped from a length of hardwood approximately as long as the forearm and about the diameter of the thumb. Various sizes of \\"au\\" combs were painstakingly fashioned by filing sections of boar tusk with tiny abrasive files knapped from volcanic flint, chert, and/or basalt rock. The smallest combs, used to make dots (\\"tala\\"), are aptly called 'au fa'atala, or 'au mono. Single lines of varying widths were tapped with various sizes of 'au sogi, while the solid blocks of tattooing were accomplished with the 'au tapulu. Tattooing Guild The prestigious role of master tattooist () has been maintained through hereditary titles within two Samoan clans, the Sa Su'a (matai) family from Savai'i and the Sa Tulou'ena family of Upolu. In ancient times the masters were elevated to high social status, wealth, and legendary prestige due to their crucial roles in Samoan society. It is known that Samoan also performed tattooing for Tongan and Fijian paramount chiefly families. The late Sua Sulu'ape Paulo II was a well-known master whose life and work features in the photography of New Zealander Mark Adams. His brother Su'a Suluape Petelo, who lives and carries out Samoan tattooing at Faleasi'u village in Upolu, is one of the most respected master tattooists today. Masters from these (families), were designated in their youth and underwent extensive apprenticeships in the role of and tattooist assistants for many years, under their elder . The traditional art of tattoo in Samoa was suppressed with the arrival of English missionaries and Christianity in the 1830s. However, it was perpetuated throughout the colonial era and was continually practiced in its intact form into the modern age. This was not the case, however, in the other Polynesian islands, and the master tattooists of the Su'a Sulu'ape family have been instrumental in the revival of traditional tattooing in French Polynesia, Tonga, New Zealand, the Cook Islands, and Hawaii, where a new generation of Pacific tattooists have learned the Samoan techniques and protocols. In popular culture * An early documentation of the pe'a on film is seen in Moana (1926), directed by American Robert J. Flaherty and filmed in Safune on the island of Savai'i. The film shows the young hero Moana's friend receiving a pe'a. * The pe'a is featured in the 2007 horror film The Tattooist. * The Disney animated film Moana (2016) shows a young man receiving his first pe'a. * Contrary to some reports Dwayne \\"The Rock\\" Johnson doesn't have a pe'a, rather a contemporary sleeve filled with pe'a inspired patterns on his left arm. His grandfather, Peter Maivia, also had a pe'a on his lower body. Non- Samoans and the Pe'a It is extremely rare for non-Samoans to receive the or the . Tongan nobility of the Tu'i Kanokupolu dynasty established the practice of pe'a tattooing among Tongan aristocracy in the pre-contact era. There are stories of Tongan royalty, Tu'i Tonga Fatafehi Fakauakimanuka and King George Tupou I of Tonga, traveling to Samoa to undergo the ritual under Samoan . European beachcombers and runaway sailors were the first non-Polynesians to receive the pe'a during the early 1800s; among the earliest non-Polynesians to receive the pe'a was an American named Mickey Knight, as well as a handful of Europeans and Americans who had jumped ship, were abandoned, or visited Samoa. During the colonial era when Samoa fell under German rule, several Europeans underwent the pe'a ritual, including Englishman Arthur Pink, Erich Schultz (the last German governor of Samoa), and a number of German colonial officials. In more recent times, many (half Samoans) and other non-Samoan men have become , including Noel Messer, FuneFe'ai Carl Cooke, Rene Persoons and artist Tony Fomison, (1939‚Äì1990), one of New Zealand's foremost painters, who received a in 1979. It is also known that several women, such as Karina Persoons, received a malu from Su'a Sulu'ape Petelo. Lyrics Pese o le Tatau song It is known that the last verse was written in modern times, as it does not match the orthography of the first verses. Oral tradition maintains that this song is derived from a pre-colonial chant.

Three such houses exist in Germany, the first experimental version having been built in 1994 as the architect's home in Freiburg im Breisgau, while the other two are used as exhibition buildings for the Hansgrohe company in Offenburg and a dentist's lab in Hilpoltstein in Bavaria. The Heliotrope in Freiburg was the first building in the world to capture more energy than it uses, all of which is entirely renewable, emissions free and CO2 neutral. The structure physically rotates to track the sun, which allows it to harness the maximum natural sunlight and warmth possible. Several different energy generation modules are used in the building including a dual-axis solar photovoltaic tracking panel, a geothermal heat exchanger, a combined heat and power unit (CHP) and solar-thermal balcony railings to provide heat and warm water. These innovations in combination with the superior insulation of the residence allow the Heliotrope to capture anywhere between four and six times its energy usage depending on the time of year. The Heliotrope is also fitted with a grey-water cleansing system and built-in natural waste composting. At the same time that Freiburg‚Äôs Heliotrope was built, Hansgrohe contracted Rolf Disch Solar Architecture to design and build another Heliotrope to be used as a visitor‚Äôs center and showroom in Offenburg, Germany. A third Heliotrope was then contracted and built in Hilpoltstein, Bavaria to be used as a technical dental laboratory. Disch‚Äôs unique design accommodates different utilization from private residences to laboratories, and nevertheless maintains the structure‚Äôs positive energy balance. In addition to the original Heliotrope design, Rolf Disch has drawn plans for larger versions of the project to be built as a rotating hotel, which gives every guest a beautiful view, as well as administrative buildings and even an exhibition pavilion for the EXPO 2010 in Shanghai. PlusEnergy PlusEnergy is a coined concept developed by Rolf Disch that indicates a structure‚Äôs extreme energy efficiency so that it holds a positive energy balance, actually obtaining more energy than it uses. With the completion of his private residence, the Heliotrope, in 1994, Disch had created the first PlusEnergy house in the world. The sheer logic of a home that captures more energy than it consumes made perfect sense to Disch. His next goal in its development was thus the mass application of the concept to residential, commercial and retail space. As the concept further developed and gained financial backing as well, Disch built several more projects with PlusEnergy certifications. PlusEnergy is a simple concept that has been materialized in a technical design. ‚ÄúPlusEnergy is a fundamental environmental imperative,‚Äù Disch claims.http://www.rolfdisch.de Disch believes that passive building isn‚Äôt enough because passive homes still emit CO2 into the atmosphere. Environment and energy needs The house is designed to face the sun with its triple-pane windows (U = 0.5) during the heating months of the year and turn its highly insulated back (U = 0.12) to the sun during the warmer months when heating isn't necessary. This significantly reduces heating and cooling requirements for the building throughout the year which are provided for by a heat pump, while hot water is provided by vacuum-tube solar panels. Photovoltaic solar panels with a rated power of 6.6 kW on its roof provide five to six times more energy than the building uses, making the building energy positive (PlusEnergy). To further improve energy capture, the panels also rotate independently from the building to follow the sun, while being able to adapt its orientation in case of strong winds. Water usage and natural waste management In order to limit water usage, a gray water circuit (for washing dishes and clothes) is used. It also collects rainwater. Waste water is purified in a vegetated cascade pond outside of the edifice. Natural waste and excrement are dry composted in the structure as well. Inhabitant comfort One of the main attractions of the house, apart from its low energy needs is its rotating view. As the building turns according to the sun's position, the view changes creating a spectacular view. This feature was later developed into a rotating hotel concept. The roof deck includes a sun and viewing deck, as well as a garden terrace. The solar panels can be used for sun or rain protection while on the roof terrace. All floors are accessible from the spiral staircase reducing surface loss through hallways and corridors.

This project currently has no customers but was designed to show that the revolving design can easily be scaled up. The plans for a rotating hotel have surfaced on several occasions although the financing has not yet been available for its actualization.

Thomas published in \\"The Illustrated London News\\", on July 21, 1849 (after Aguyar's death). Andrea Aguyar, nicknamed Andrea il Moro, (?, Montevideo, Uruguay - June 30, 1849, Rome, Italy) was a former Black slave from Uruguay who became a follower of Garibaldi in both South America and Italy, and who died in defence of the revolutionary Roman Republic of 1849. In Uruguay Aguyar was born in Montevideo to black slave parents, and was a slave until his young adulthood. The abolition of slavery in Uruguay was directly linked to the outbreak of the Uruguayan Civil War in 1838. Both sides - the Liberal \\"Colorados\\" and the Conservative \\"Blancos\\" proclaimed the emancipation of slaves in 1842, in order to mobilize the former slaves to reinforce their respective military forces. During the siege of Montevideo, the newly-freed slaves, who formed a contingent 5,000 strong, and the community of foreign exiles and expatriates, were mostly responsible for the defense of the city. Among the latter Giuseppe Garibaldi - then a young Italian exile starting to make a name for himself as a daring revolutionary and guerrilla leader - headed the \\"Italian Legion\\". It was at that time that Aguyar's association with Garibaldi began. In his memoirs, Garibaldi greatly praised these freed slaves: \\"True sons of freedom. Their lances, longer than normal length, their dark black [nerissimi] faces, their robust limbs used to permanent and demanding work, their perfect discipline\\".\\"Le memorie di Garibaldi in una delle redazioni anteriori alla definitiva del 1872\\", Bologna, 1932; translated by and quoted in Lucy Riall, \\"Garibaldi, Invention of a Hero\\", London, 2007, p. 159, p. 420 note 126 Most of these freed slaves did not, however, follow Garibaldi when he returned to Europe in 1848 - which Andrea Aguyar did. In Rome Aguyar traveled with Garibaldi on the latter's 1848 return to Italy, and was likely at his side during Garibaldi's earlier phases of participation in the First Italian War of Independence at Piedmont and Lombardy, and Garibaldi's victories at Luino and Morazzone. However, Aguyar came into the public gaze mainly during the months of the Roman Republic's tenacious resistance - which turned out to be the last months of Aguyar's own life. To a considerable degree, the beleaguered Roman Republic's struggle was waged in the international press as much as on the actual battlefield. Numerous journalists were present in Rome and reporting back to their countries, a large part of them openly sympathetic to the Italian Nationalist cause. In their reports Aguyar often figured, being given special attention as a single \\"exotic\\" Black man among Europeans. \\"The Illustrated London News\\", which especially sent a reporter and an illustrator to cover the struggle in Rome, published on July 21, 1849, a drawing of Aguyar riding a horse behind Garibaldi, with the caption \\"Garibaldi and his negro servant\\". The attached report referred to Aguyar as \\"A fine fellow, his dress a red loose coat and a showy silk handkerchief tied loosely over his shoulders\\". The drawing (see above) also showed him wearing a hat with an ostrich feather, similar to the hat worn by Garibaldi himself in the same drawing Drawing reproduced and article quoted in Rial, op.cit., p. 90-91, p. 409 n. 144 In the memoirs of international volunteers who joined Garibaldi, Aguyar is mentioned as a fellow-fighter of exceptional abilities. \\"A moor [moro] of vast proportions who had followed [Garibaldi] from America, in a black cloak with a lance garnished with a red pennant\\" was the description of the Swiss volunteer Von Hofstetter. The Dutch painter Jan Koelman, also a volunteer with Garibaldi, wrote of \\"A Hercules of ebony colour, a freed slave who followed Garibaldi from Brazil (sic) and who astonished everyone in battle by throwing a lasso over enemy soldiers and pulling them off their horses\\" G. Von Hofstetter, \\"Giornale della cose di Roma nel 1851, Turin, 1851, p.29; J.P. Koelman, Memorie romane, Rome, 1963, p.245-6 ;quoted in Riall, op.cit.,p.86 , p.409, note.135 \\\\- a gaucho trick completely unfamiliar to European soldiers. More prosaically, he also used the lasso in order to collect riderless horses running around after a battle. Aguyar also appeared in hostile caricatures published by a conservative Roman paper, which depicted Garibaldi as \\"a treacherous long haired brigand, followed by a large black man\\" Garibaldi, Arte e Storia, Florence, 1982; quoted in Rial, op.cit.,p. 93, p. 409 note 147 Though illiterate, Aguyar was considered highly skillful and competent, especially an accomplished horseman. He was reputed to have saved Garibaldi's life several times, at risk to his own. In one specific episode, during battle with soldiers of the Bourbon Kingdom of the Two Sicilies at Velletri, Aguyar saved Garibaldi when the commander was thrown of his horse and was in concrete danger of being captured. Off the battlefield, Aguyar is mentioned as offering his saddle as a pillow for Garibaldi to sleep on during breaks in marching, and improvising an awning to protect him from the sun. Aguyar also took care of Guerrillo, Garibaldi's three-legged dog who was saved and adopted after being hit by a stray bullet in the Battle of San Antonio in February 1846, and whom Garibaldi eventually took with him from Uruguay to Italy. Guerrillo was mentioned as \\"always running either under Garibaldi's horse or under Aguyar's (the dog's ultimate fate is unknown). Death When the above-mentioned report and drawing appeared in The Illustrated London News, on July 21, 1849, the Roman Republic had already fallen and Aguyar - mentioned in the article as \\"now dead\\" - had fallen in its desperate last struggle. With the French forces breaking into Rome on June 30, 1849, Andrea Aguyar - appointed a Lieutenant by Garibaldi in recognition of his abilities - was mortally wounded when hit by a shell near the Church of Santa Maria in Trastevere. Reportedly, while bleeding he managed to cry out: \\"Long Live the Republics of America and Rome!\\". He was carried into the Church of Santa Maria della Scala in the same neighborhood, used at the time as a hospital, where he died. His name is often linked with that of Luciano Manara, also killed on the same day. The Italian commemorative web page \\"Andrea Aguyar, il Moro di Garibaldi\\" deplores the fact that there is no bust of Andrea Aguyar to be found among those of the fallen Garibaldian heroes placed on the Janiculum hill. However, the name \\"Andrea il Moro\\" was given to a flight of stairs (scalea) in the region between the Trastevere and Monteverde parts of Rome, not far from where he was killed.

A tally, an inscribed black silk ribbon, is tied around the base which usually bears the name of a ship or a navy. Many navies (e.g. Germany) tie the tally at the rear of the cap and let the two ends hang down to the shoulders as decorative streamers. In the Royal Navy the tally is tied off in a bow over the left ear and in the early 20th century it was customary when going on shore leave to tie a small coin in the bow to make it stand out. In wartime, as a security measure, many navies replace the name of the ship with a generic title (e.g. \\"HMS\\" = \\"His/Her Majesty's Ship\\" in the Royal Navy or \\"South African Navy\\"). The cap may be further embellished with a badge, cockade or other accessory. Visorless caps of this kind began to be worn in the mid 19th century. The more rigid type of sailor hat with a wide, flat crown is also known as square rig (this refers generally to a type of sailor uniform) cap or pork pie (not to be confused with the brimmed pork pie hat). Until after World War II it was customary in most navies to wear a removable white cover over the dark blue cap in tropical or summer conditions only. This has been retained but as the cap is now generally a formal or dress item the white cover is worn all year around. The German Navy version of the sailor cap has a raised front in contrast to the flat top favored by the Royal Navy. The sailor cap was first introduced in September 1811 as a part of the uniform of the Russian Navy (bezkozyrka, ru. –±–µ—Å–∫–æ–∑—ã—Ä–∫–∞, non-peaked hat), at the same time as an identical forage cap was adopted by the Russian Army. All ranks of the Russian navy of this period wore military style uniforms and the bezkozyrka was a useful development of the peaked cap in practical application to marine conditions. The French Navy's version of the sailor cap, with its distinctive red pompom on top, was adopted about 1848. Worn initially as an ordinary duty alternative for a formal leather hat with turned up side, the cap has survived as a dress item until the present day. The Belgian Navy adopted the same pattern of cap, but with light-blue pompom and trailing ribbons, on 29 March 1939.Liliane and Fred Funcken, pages 150 and 153 \\"L'Uniforme et les Armes des soldats de la guerre 1939-45, tome 2 Casterman 1973 Known as the \\"flat hat\\" or \\"Pancake cap\\" the U.S. Navy's version of the blue woolen sailor hat described above was first issued in 1852. Generally superseded progressively by the white cotton hat of the working uniform also known as a \\"Dixie hat\\" during World War II, the flat hat continued to be issued but seldom worn, until officially formally withdrawn from issue in April 1963. United States Navy, Bolivian, Philippine, and Venezuelan sailors currently wear a white canvas hat with an upright brim, often referred to as a \\"Dixie cup\\" in reference to its similarity to the shape of a common disposable drinking cup, or a \\"gob hat\\" or cap. This hat was also worn by Polish Navy sailors before 1939‚Äîit was called the \\"amerykanka\\" (\\"American hat\\") or \\"nejwihetka\\" (derived from the English phrase \\"Navy hat\\"). US sailors in \\"dixie cup\\" caps In the Royal Navy, round caps with a tally band were being worn in the 1850s and were officially prescribed in the \\"Uniform Regulations for Petty Officers, Seamen and Boys\\" of 1857. Part One Originally, the blue caps had a cover made from white cotton duck for summer and tropical use, but in 1930, a new cap with a permanent white duck crown was introduced, supplemented by a redesigned blue cap in the following year. A 1936 recommendation that the blue cap should be discontinued was not adopted and a regulation of April 1940 stipulated that white caps were not to be worn in \\"home waters\\" for the duration of the Second World War. Blue caps were finally abolished in 1956.Brayley 2014, Part Two Sect.2 Images File:Chinese sailors qingdao.jpgChina \\"square rig\\" or \\"pork pie\\" hat File:Norwegian navy former private hat.pngNorwegian Navy cap File:Jean-Bart seaman Bastille Day 2008.jpgFrance \\"Bachi\\" bonnet File:Czapka.marynarska.ORP.SƒòP.JPGPolish Navy cap File:US Navy 080923-N-4965F-009 Navy Region Hawaii Ceremonial Guard forms up in preparation of a burial.jpgUnited States \\"dixie cup\\" hat File:Polish destroyer's range-finder.JPGPolish sailors wearing \\"dixie cups\\" File:HMAS Hobart seaman's cap.jpgAustralian sailor in 1940 with the British pattern seaman's cap File:US Navy 090716-N-6770T-117 A Royal Thai Navy sailor stands in ranks beside his U.S. Navy counterparts from the dock landing ship USS Harpers Ferry (LSD 49), the guided-missile frigate USS Crommelin (FFG 37), and the guided-miss.jpgRoyal Thai Navy sailors with sailor cap File:US Navy 071025-N-4965F-008 Sailors aboard British Royal Navy frigate HMS Monmouth (F235) perform line handling duties as the ship moors pierside Naval Station Pearl Harbor.jpgRoyal Navy sailor with British seaman's cap File:The Royal Canadian Navy during the Second World War A3275.jpgWorld War II Royal Canadian Navy sailor, showing the British pattern blue cap File:Crew HMCS Daerwood.pngRoyal Canadian Navy sailors during World War II, with the white cap, worn in the summer or in the tropics See also * Sailor suit * Pork pie hat References Category:1810s fashion Category:19th-century fashion Category:20th-century fashion Category:Caps Category:Military uniforms Category:Russian inventions Category:Russian clothing Category:Maritime culture ","title":"Sailor cap"},{"id":"24606181","title":"Karloff Lagarde Jr."},{"id":"24606187","text":"John Aubrey Casewell (fourth ¬º 1909 ‚Äì second ¬º 1974) was a Welsh professional rugby league footballer who played in the 1920s and 1930s, and coached in the 1940s.

Biography  He was a long-time friend of La Fontaine; their mutual literary influence was very important, and it was to him that La Fontaine addressed The first book of fables (III), The Miller, his Son and the Ass. He was ordained as a priest, and in the Spring of 1647, he purchased a prebendary. He remained canon of Rheims until his death in 1708. Contrary to the popular legend, de Maucroix was not definitely a classmate of La Fontaine's at Chateau Thierry. Pierre Clarac has remarked that, at about the age of 25, while they were a part of the Knights of the Round Table (Literary Circle), who were a group of ('robins'?) who met from 1646 to discuss their works and diverse other subjects, that although being on first-name term with Pellison and Cassandre, Maucroix still used the more formal 'vous' when addressing La Fontaine.

Siting it at Kensal Rise, rather than next to Paddington itself, would provide a new station to regenerate the area. Amongst the general public there is a huge amount of support for the project and then-mayor of London Boris Johnson stated that a station would be added if it did not increase Crossrail's overall cost; in response, Kensington and Chelsea Council agreed to underwrite the projected ¬£33 million cost of a Crossrail station, which was received very well by the residents of the Borough.

Biography = Studies and initial teaching positions  Ros studied Ibero-Romance languages, sociology, literature and philosophy in Hamburg, Madrid (Spain) and Coimbra (Portugal). He received his doctorate in 1971 for the dissertation On the theory of literary narrative. He earned his habilitation in Saarbr√ºcken as an assistant of Kuno Lorenz. The title of his habilitation thesis was Philosophy as a methodological critique of meaning. In subsequent years, Ros was a visiting professor in Hamburg, Saarbr√ºcken and Campinas (Brazil).  Professor at Magdeburg University  Since 1994 he is professor for Theoretical Philosophy at the Otto-von-Guericke University Magdeburg. His main focus is concentrated on systematic and historical problems of argumentation theory with special attention to the theory of concepts (the concept of concept) as well as systematic and historical questions of philosophy of biology and psychology, with particular reference to the philosophical aspects of the mind-matter problem. Among his students, he is best known and appreciated for his conceptually accurate argumentation and teaching. In his lectures he takes particular care to examine complicated problems by clearly distinguishing between their logical-methodological and historical components.  Philosophy = Argumentation theory  Ros is known (also because of his activities as a former assistant of Kuno Lorenz) as an expert in argumentation theory and in this field he has researched the concepts of concept, of foundation, of explanation as well as of a typology of explanations (which are distinguished by the different types of causes that they provide). From 1989 to 1990, Ros published Foundation and Concept, a three volume monograph on the concept of concept that spans the history of philosophy from its beginnings in ancient Greece to contemporary Analytical Philosophy.  Epistemology and the Task of Philosophy  The term 'concept' is understood by Ros along lines suggested by Ludwig Wittgenstein's later work, that is, as a linguistic classificatory ability or habit. The epistemological starting point is that we as subjects can only acquire knowledge about parts of the world by classifying objects (entities), that is, by making use of our classificatory abilities. The problem lies in the fact that our classificatory abilities may be learned, dependent on culture, or biologically conditioned, whereby the possibility of objective justification can be called into question. From this arises the task of philosophy, which, unlike the sciences, does not use or apply our classificatory abilities to interpret reality, but rather reflects upon these very conceptual abilities, that is, investigates whether they are meaningful or reasonable.  Philosophy of mind  As an argumentation theorist, Ros especially emphasizes that within the philosophy of mind it is critical to first of all specify the problem as exactly as possible. Physical processes have to be distinguished from biological processes because the latter, in contrast to the former, when related to the activities of an organism, are purposeful and are meant as a response to a stimulus. From the concept of organism Ros progresses to the concept of the agent or acting subject, and from this to the concept of person, which is characterized by the criterion of possessing psychological phenomena. In the case of humans, an additional stage is reached, because they are also able to guide themselves by rules. In Matter and Spirit (2005), Ros presented a thorough analysis of the mind-matter problem. In 2008, he published the essay \\"Mental Causation and Mereological Explanations\\", in which he tries to solve the problem of mental causation by means of mereological explanations. In addition, he has recently published the following papers on the philosophy of mind: * 1996: \\"Philosophical aspects of mind-matter problem\\" (inaugural lecture at the Otto-von-Guericke University of Magdeburg on 26 June 1996) * 1996: \\"Observations on the relationship between neurophysiology and psychology\\" * 1997: \\"Reduction, identity and abstraction.

For him, only higher cognitive functions (such as problem solving, use of abstract concepts, etc.) qualify as mental or spiritual, while psychological phenomena must include states such as temper tantrums. Ros therefore avoids using the terms mental and spiritual. After all, the German word Geist is merely a corresponding term for the Greek concept of psyche.

She never adopted 12-tone or serial techniques, but her music shows a profound understanding of that musical language. She can be credited with the first truly athematic works composed in England. Her Cello Concerto was premiered by Jacqueline du Pr√© in 1964, and her Violin Concerto Due Canti e Finale was premiered by Yehudi Menuhin in 1977. Biography Priaulx Rainier was born in 1903 in Howick, Natal, South Africa, to a father of Huguenot descent and an English mother.Music Web International One of her sisters was a cellist. She studied the violin at the South African College of Music in Cape Town after her family moved there when she was aged 10, but moved permanently to London at the age of 17, in 1920, when she took up a scholarship to the Royal Academy of Music (RAM). She studied there with Rowsby Woof and Sir John Blackwood McEwen. She taught at Badminton School, Bristol, and also played violin in a string quartet. She had encouragement as a composer from Arnold Bax, and in 1937 studied with Nadia Boulanger in ParisClassical Music on the Web but considered herself essentially self-taught. Early career Priaulx Rainer started composing in 1924, but little came from her pen until 1937, after a long period of recuperation following a serious car accident in 1935.British Music Information CentreRoyal Academy of Music Her first acknowledged work was Three Greek Epigrams for voice and piano. Her first mature work was the String Quartet No.1 in CminorYork gate Musical Notes (1939). It was given a private performance in 1940 but not performed publicly until 1944, at Wigmore Hall. It was recorded in 1949 by the Amadeus Quartet.Snowman, Daniel, Amadeus Quartet: The Men and the Music, London, 1981 The music was used for a ballet titled Night Spell, performed by the Jos√© Lim√≥n company in the United States in 1951 and at Sadler's Wells Ballet in 1957. She often used ostinato-like repetition and alternation in her works, often of a percussive character. These characteristics are apparent in the Viola Sonata (premiered in March 1946 by Winifred Copperwheat and Antony Hopkins) and the Barbaric Dance Suite for piano (1949; premiered in November 1950 by Margaret Kitchin).The Independent, Obituary of Margaret Kitchin, 1 July 2008 There is also a Suite for clarinet and piano (1943), a Sinfonia da camera for strings (1947; commissioned by a close friend, Michael Tippett; premiered by Walter Goehr,) and a Ballet Suite (1950). Her first large-scale work for voices was Orpheus Sonnets for soprano, baritone, chorus and orchestra. In 1939 she was appointed a Professor of Composition at the RAM,Schott Music where she remained until 1961. She was elected a Fellow in 1952. Her students included Nigel Butterley,ABC Classic FMAustralian Composers Jeremy Dale Roberts,The Guardian, The God of small things, 28 May 2004Fanfare Rachel Cavalho,\\"Rachel Cavalho\\". The Canadian Encyclopedia and Christopher Small.Perfect Sound Forever She and Michael Tippett co-founded the St Ives September Festival, first presented in June 1953.Barbara Hepworth Biography Music The first of Priaulx Rainier's large orchestral works was Phalaphala (the word refers to an African chief's ceremonial horn), first heard in 1961, celebrating Sir Adrian Boult's tenth anniversary with the London Philharmonic Orchestra (1960). Peter Pears and the Purcell SingersSingers.com gave the first performance of Priaulx Rainier's Requiem (1956; tenor and unaccompanied chorus) at the Aldeburgh Festival that year. It was set to the poem Requiem, written for her by David Gascoyne in 1938‚Äì1940Salisbury Cathedral and Close in ParisObituary of David Gascoyne, The Times, 28 November 2001 and dedicated to future victims of war. Pears also commissioned Rainier's Cycle for Declamation (1954) and The Bee Oracles (1970), a setting of Edith Sitwell's poem The Bee-Keeper scored for tenor, flute, oboe, violin, cello and harpsichord. Pears first sang it publicly at the Aldeburgh Festival in 1970.Another source says it was premiered at the Wigmore Hall on 21 March 1971. The oboe quartet Quanta was commissioned by William Glock, Head of Music at the BBC, and written for Janet Craxton and the London Oboe Quartet. The title comes from the quantum theory. The Cello Concerto was written for a Prom Concert held on 3September 1964Records International where it was introduced to the world by Jacqueline du Pr√© and the BBC Symphony Orchestra under Norman Del Mar (at the same concert, duPr√© played Edward Elgar's Cello Concerto with the same orchestra under Sir Malcolm Sargent, the year before she made her famous recording of it under Sir John Barbirolli.)ArkivMusikMDT It has been claimed that duPr√© \\"loathed every second\\" of the Rainier concerto, \\"not only because of its idiom, but also because it was technically beyond her\\".Classical Music on the Web Priaulx Rainier's largest work of that period was the orchestral suite Aequora Lunae, a continuous piece in seven sections, each one descriptive of one of the Moon's seas. It was dedicated to Barbara Hepworth, whose acquaintance she made in the summer of 1949 when she stayed in St Ives, Cornwall, using a fisherman's loft as a studio. She remained a close friend of Hepworth and Ben Nicholson. She claimed that only sculptors and architects fully understood her music. Another work premiered at a Prom Concert was Plo√´rmel (1973), an evocation of one her favourite places, Plo√´rmel in the North West of France, near the mouth of the River Loire. It uses an orchestra of winds and percussion, including timpani, tubular bells, hand-bells, antique cymbals, high and low gongs, xylophone, and marimba. Her violin concerto, Due Canti e Finale, was commissioned by Yehudi Menuhin, who performed it at the 1977 Edinburgh Festival with the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra conducted by Sir Charles Groves. Menuhin described Rainier as \\"having a musical imagination of a colour and variety scarcely to be believed\\".Alison Hodge Publishers On the other hand, after hearing her music, William Walton commented that she \\"must have barbed-wire underwear\\". Concertante for Two Winds and Orchestra was written for, and dedicated to, Janet Craxton and Thea King and was premiered at the Proms in 1981. There have been infrequent performances of Priaulx Rainier's music as they are difficult for both performer and listener. Premieres of her music were not always adequate, reducing the chances of there being further performances. Her complete chamber music was recorded and broadcast by the BBC in 1976. Later life She was awarded a Doctorate in Music (Honoris Causa) by the University of Cape Town in June 1982. She was a passionate gardener and ecologist who helped design, and planted the exotic plants in, Barbara Hepworth's Sculpture Garden in StIves. Her last work, Wildlife Celebration, was commissioned by Yehudi Menuhin and performed in aid of Gerald Durrell's Wildlife Conservation Trust. Priaulx Rainier died on 10 October 1986 at Besse-en-Chandesse in France, aged 83.David Mason Greene, Greene's Biographical Encyclopaedia of Composers says she died in London. The date was the 70th birthday of David Gascoyne, the poet to whose words she had written her Requiem of 1956. Legacy Most of her music manuscripts are now housed at the J.W. Jagger Library at the University of Cape Town.3rd National Grahamstown Music Competition 2009 On 28 March 1987 a concert in celebration of her life and work was held at Wigmore Hall.

Formerly, it was one of the pioneer in tractor manufacturing. It is part of the Wacker Neuson group.  History = Founding in 1925 until stop of the tractor production in 1973 In 1925 the brothers Kramer started to develop and produce mowing machines and Tractors in Gutmadingen, Germany. These were the first ones built in Germany and a revolution in agricultural work. The company headquarters was moved to √úberlingen (Bodensee) in 1952. In the time from 1957 to 1958, a special department for industrial and construction machines was set up. It caused a sensation, when Kramer introduced in 1968 the first German wheel loader with four-wheel drive and equal sized tires. A lot other four-wheel steered machines followed this example. In 1973 an important change of direction occurred, when the company decided to close down the \\"tractor\\" manufacturing division of the business and focussed on construction machines. At this time the global tractor manufacturing business was changing with local companies suffering reduced market share as the major players consolidated and average tractor horse power increased. Many of the post war European tractor manufactures failed.  Concentration on construction equipment 1974 until 2000  In 1987 the companies focus was adjusted to the four-wheel steering based models. The same year the Kramer 312 SL was the first wheel loader with four-wheel steering which was manufactured in serial production.  2000 onwards  In 2000 the merger between Kramer-Werke GmbH and Neuson Baumaschinen GmbH took place. Within this year, the company was renamed to Neuson Kramer Baumaschinen GmbH, which was situated in Linz Since 2005 Kramer is producing telehandlers for the agricultural machinery manufacturer Claas.http://www.wab.ihk.de/index.php?id=6493 Kramer builds telehandlers for Claas As part of this cooperation Claas acquired a minority interest in Kramer.Annual Report Wacker Neuson 2012 (PDF-Datei; 5,5 MB) In March 2007 the merger between the Wacker Construction Equipment AG, Munich and the Neuson Kramer Baumaschinen AG was announced.

The complex is centred on the Grade II listed outdoor swimming pool, known as Uxbridge Lido until 2010, when the newly built centre and refurbished pool were opened. A new indoor pool was built beside the lido as part of the redevelopment works, opening in February 2010, followed a day later by the outdoor pool. The outdoor pool was built in 1935 in the \\"Moderne\\" or Art Deco style, at a cost of ¬£24,500. It was closed in 1998 and became subject to heavy vandalism. In 2007 it was announced that the pool would be restored in time to be used as a training pool for the 2012 Summer Olympics. Description The oldest parts of the complex are the unheated outdoor swimming pool, two fountains, an entrance building and a grandstand structure, all of which are Grade II listed. At opening the pool measured , and took the form of an elongated twelve-sided star in plan ‚Äì it is the only remaining example in the country. It was the second longest open-air swimming pool remaining in London. The two fountains are arranged in a line, one to the north and one to the south of the pool. These are octagonal concrete structures, each with a base and central column supporting two basins. The concrete and brick entrance building at the northern end of the complex has a single storey and has a splayed \\"U\\"-shape in plan. The short central brick bay features a pay window. The grandstand on the eastern side of the lido is built of reinforced concrete and has three levels including the open flat roofed viewing terrace. As part of the new development, the Hillingdon House Farm athletics track nearby was refurbished to become part of the new complex. The building beside the outdoor pool comprises a new pool, sports hall, health and fitness facilities, caf√© and changing rooms. History The heavily vandalised outdoor pool, photographed in 2007 The architect for the lido was G. Percy Trentham.Smith 2006, p.106 Before the opening of the pool, many residents swam in a section of the Frays River near Harefield Road, and the Colne.Cotton 1994, p.121 The construction of the buildings and pool cost ¬£24,500 at that time, and 120 local unemployed men were employed to complete the works. The opening ceremony for the pool was held on 31 August 1935, organised by Uxbridge Urban District Council. The chairman of the council, Reverend Luther Bouch, performed the opening, while Alf Price became the first superintendent.Skinner 2008, p.30 Athletes participating in the 1948 Summer Olympics in London were housed at the nearby RAF Uxbridge, and used the pool to train in.Skinner 2008, p.121 Hillingdon Council closed the pool after the 1982 season and did not open it in 1983. It was then reopened by Uxbridge Pool Action Group in 1984, following a ¬£148,000 grant from the Greater London Council. They installed solar heating panels and a huge water slide, as well as additional dry-side activities to try to improve the viability of the pool. However, it did not prove to be a viable proposition in the long-term and the Council eventually took the pool back in 1989. Lidos historian Andy Hoines wrote: \\"Subsequently the pool closed down a second time, but was reopened again by the Yiewsley Pool Trust by the time of a visit I made in 1993. The current closure after the 1998 season was prompted by damage attributed to incursions from travellers, as well as the perceived need for major expenditure to bring the facilities up to recent Health and Safety standards.\\" The pool, pavilion building, entrance building and both fountains were granted Grade II listed status in 1998. Despite the listing and the pool closing to the public, the buildings were subjected to heavy vandalism.Sherwood 2007, p.72 Restoration Entrance to the refurbished outdoor pool in 2011 In October 2000 the London Borough of Hillingdon proposed building a indoor community pool with movable booms and floors beside the outdoor pool, with a centre for performance training. Under the plans, the outdoor pool would be restored to allow for outdoor swimming, and the new development would include a health and fitness suite, restaurant, health suite and sports hall. English Heritage would oversee the project to restore the lido. Planning permission for the main swimming pool and sports centre was granted on 8 June 2005. In January 2008, the contractors Leadbitter, with a design team headed by FaulknerBrowns Architects, began work on the ¬£21m swimming pool complex that would be used by budding Olympians in the run up to the 2012 games. Sharron Davies, the former Olympic swimmer, commenced the building work in a special ceremony. The outdoor pool will be completely restored to its former glory. The athletic track was completed in April 2006, and was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II. Funding was provided by London Borough of Hillingdon (¬£22m), London Development Agency (¬£2.02m), Sport England (¬£1.5m) and the Heritage Lottery Fund (just under ¬£1m). In May 2009 a topping out ceremony was held, attended by councillors, the construction firm and members of the local residents' association. The indoor pool and sports complex opened to local residents in February 2010, and was officially opened by the Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, on 21 March 2010. The unheated outdoor pool re-opened the following day. On 8 September 2010, the 75th anniversary of the first opening of the lido was celebrated at the pool. The South Korean Olympic Team used the centre for training during the 2012 Olympic Games. References ;Citations ;Bibliography * Cotton, Carolynne. (1994) Uxbridge Past.

SEBAL maps evapotranspiration, biomass growth, water deficit and soil moisture. Its main creator is Prof. Dr. W.G.M. Bastiaanssen  Model background  The basis of SEBAL is the energy balance: the energy driving the hydrological cycle is equal to the incoming energy minus: #the energy going to heating of the soil and air, and #the energy reflected back to space. SEBAL quantifies the energy balance using satellite data as an input. Land surface characteristics such as surface albedo, leaf area index, vegetation index and surface temperature are derived from satellite imagery. In addition to satellite images, the SEBAL model requires meteorological data, such as wind speed, humidity, solar radiation and air temperature. It uses meteorological data from the moment of the recording of the satellite data to solve the 'instantaneous' energy balance, and uses extrapolation to calculate daily evapotranspiration. Using a time series of satellite and meteorological data, periodic cumulative (e.g. weekly, monthly, yearly) evapotranspiration data can be calculated. The SEBAL model uses the energy balance, as opposed to in hydrology common water balance to solve for evapotranspiration.  Applications  The energy balance applies to all scales, ranging from global to river basin to region to farm and to field level. Satellite images come in a wide variety of spatial and temporal resolutions. Evapotranspiration and biomass production are key indicators for water management and irrigation performance. The combination of the energy balance with input from remote sensing data is applied by farmers, irrigation districts, catchment management agencies and regional and national governments.

He distinguished himself at the Battle of Gettysburg and the Battle of Sayler's Creek. Subsequently, he \\"amassed a fortune in the leather industry and used that wealth in a variety of philanthropic activities. In addition, he was a prominent force in healing the wounds between the North and South and bringing peace to a fractured nation.\\" Pre-War Andrew Cowan was born in Ayrshire, Scotland on September 29, 1841, and he migrated to the United States as a boy. He married his first wife, Mary Asdit, in upper New York State where she bore a son, Albert Andrew Cowan, in August 1867 but she died the following month most likely from complications from childbirth.New York Times, August 24, 1919, p. 22.

New York Military Museum and Veterans Research Center Andrew Cowan was commissioned as the unit's first lieutenant. The battery was mustered into the service as a volunteer unit for a term of three years on November 23. The battery arrived in Washington, D. C. on December 4. Officially designated the 1st New York Battery three days later, it was assigned to BG William F. Smith's division of the Army of the Potomac in January 1862. The division joined IV Corps in March of, 1862. The division joined VI Corps in May 1862, serving in the Peninsula Campaign. By that time, Lt Cowan was in charge. He was promoted to the rank of captain during the Peninsula Campaign.New York in the War of the Rebellion, vol. 2, p. 1561, lists Cowan as promoted to captain on January 23, 1862; but Capt. Kennedy did not leave his captaincy until April 30 of that year. The 1st New York Battery served at the Battle of Yorktown and the Battle of Williamsburg under the division's senior artillerist Capt Romeyn B. Ayres. It took part in Seven Days Battles, the Battle of South Mountain at Crampton's Gap, the Battle of Antietam, and the Battle of Fredericksburg. In the Chancellorsville Campaign, the battery served in the Second Battle of Fredericksburg, covering the crossing of VI Corps into the town of Fredericksburg. It then supported the division of BG Albion Howe at the Battle of Salem Church. The battery was assigned to the Artillery Brigade of VI Corps in May 1863. In that arrangement it served in the Battle of Gettysburg. In reserve at first, on July 3, 1863, it was placed just south of the copse of trees on Cemetery Ridge, in time to resist Pickett's Charge. Cowan's guns filled a gap in the infantry line left when a regiment left the front. Cowan ordered his men to fire \\"double canister\\" on a group of Confederates trying to penetrate the federal line, and their fire broke up that threat. BG Henry J. Hunt, the army's chief of artillery, was present with them and had his horse shot out from under him.Sears, Gettysburg, p. 445. A newspaper account reported that Capt Cowan served in a gun crew at the height of the assault. A monument to the battery, executed by J. G. Hamilton, stands on the site of this action. In the autumn of 1863, the battery served in the Bristoe Campaign, especially the Battle of Rappahannock Station, and in the Mine Run Campaign. The battery served in the VI Corps Artillery Brigade in the Overland Campaign and in the earliest stage of the Siege of Petersburg. Then it served with the Army of the Shenandoah of MG Philip Sheridan from October 1864. In Sheridan's portion of the Valley Campaigns of 1864, Cowan was wounded at the Third Battle of Winchester. His battery saw particularly hard service at the Battle of Cedar Creek. Cowan served briefly in XXII Corps from December 1864 until it rejoined the Army of the Potomac on January 25, 1865. Men at the expiration of their term of service were given the chance to be discharged, but most reenlisted, permitting the battery to continue in service. In the Army of the Potomac, Capt. Cowan, who had received the brevet rank of major, took command of the Artillery Brigade when Col Charles H. Tompkins was assigned to other duties. Cowan was in charge of the VI Corps guns during the Appomattox Campaign. At the Battle of Sailor's Creek on April 6, 1865, Cowan had gathered 20 guns near the Hillsman House. They opened fire at about 5:15 PM, experiencing no counter-battery fire from the Confederates, because their guns had not accompanied the infantry. Two divisions of VI Corps attacked the Confederate rear guard, under Ltg Richard S. Ewell, at about 6:00 PM. Ewell's men attacked the VI Corps divisions as they crossed the stream. The Federals were thrown back. However, Cowan's guns stopped the Southern advance, allowing the infantry to reform and counterattack.Report of Brevet Major Andrew Cowan, War of the Rebellion, Series I, vol. 46, pt. 1, p. 1011. The Confederate line was hit in the front by VI Corps and in the flank by federal cavalry. It collapsed, and Ewell was among the southerners captured on the field. After Robert E. Lee's surrender, at which he was present, the battery returned home. It was honorably discharged and mustered out June 23, 1865, at Syracuse, New York. The 1st New York Battery lost 1 officer and 12 enlisted men killed. 1 officer and 6 enlisted men died of wounds; another 38 enlisted men died of disease or other causes. Andrew Cowan left the volunteer services as a brevet lieutenant colonel, this promotion dated April 9, 1865.New York in the War of the Rebellion, vol. 2, p. 1561. Post war=Life in Louisville After the war, Andrew Cowan married his second wife, Anna Gilbert, in New York State in 1876 and on October 24, 1876, she bore a son, Gilbert S. Cowan, in Louisville, Kentucky, where he had by then settled. He became a leather merchant and after a less than cordial welcome (\\"He was what you might call a carpetbagger.... In a postbellum Louisville dominated by ex-Confederates, Cowan was from the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong political leanings.\\") he eventually became locally prominent. His company sold retail. He also served on company boards, headed a printing company for the blind and was a park commissioner. Cowan also served on the committee that raised funds for the erection of the Statue of Liberty as the city's representative.The New York Times, July 11, 1883, p. 8. In 1900, he was a member of a Kentucky delegation that visited the White House to discuss problems in the state with President William McKinley.The New York Times, March 24, 1900, p. 3. Louisville's Parks Although John Breckinridge Castleman is usually credited with creating Louisville's park system, credit is more properly due to Cowan. He originally proposed the park system in a newspaper essay of 1887. \\"It was Cowan who successfully lobbied for the state legislation to create a Louisville Park Commission. It was Cowan who first invited Olmsted, the renowned landscape architect, to Louisville and who secretly coached the firm on how to price their work in order to win the bid.... If Castleman had his way, Olmsted never would have been hired.\\" Veteran's Affairs Cowan also was active in veterans' affairs. On July 3, 1887, Col. Cowan took a leading part in the dedication of the monument to his battery in Gettysburg. He also gave to veterans of MG George Pickett's division, the Pickett Division association, a sword that had fallen into his hands at the Battle of Gettysburg. On September 9, 1895, Cowan gave a banquet for delegates to a convention of the Grand Army of the Republic. Cowan was close with Confederate survivors in Kentucky, who named him an honorary member of their Orphan Brigade in 1912. Cowan is credited with helping create the Gettysburg Peace Memorial Association, but he did not live to see the Peace Light dedicated in 1938.\\"80th Anniversary of the Eternal Light Peace Peace Memorial,\\" Preservation and Progress 29, no. 2 (2018), 4-5. In 1915, Cowan was the father of a proposal to hold a Confederate reunion in Washington.The New York Times, October 4, 1915, p. 7. Later than year, he gave an address at the dedicate of a statue of BG Alexander S. Webb, who had commanded the Philadelphia Brigade at Gettysburg, in the Gettysburg National Military Park.The New York Times, October 13, 1915, p. 7. When the Confederate reunion was held in 1917, Col. Cowan and President Woodrow Wilson were among the participants. Cowan presented an American flag that was hung beside the Confederate bannerThe New York Times, June 6, 1917, p. 7. Col. Cowan also served a term as president of the Society of the Army of the Potomac. Andrew Cowan died in Louisville on August 23, 1919, at the age of 78.The New York Times, August 24, 1919, p. 22.

It was home of German Army Medium Transport Helicopter Regiment 35, equipped with CH-53D helicopters. The regiment was disbanded in 2004. The air base was closed on 31 December 2007 with the last personnel leaving the base on 30 June 2008. History Niedermendig Air Base (Fliegerhorst Niedermendig) was opened as a Luftwaffe airfield in 1938. Its prewar use is undetermined. After the breakout of World War II, Zerst√∂rergeschwader 26 (ZG 26), a Messerschmitt Bf 110 unit used in the Battle of France was assigned in May 1940. In September 1944, Aufkl√§rungsgruppe 123 (Scouting Group 123), equipped with Focke-Wulf Fw 189 used the airfield to monitor the advancing Allied armies moving east from France. The Luftwaffe, 1933-45 American Army units moved into the Mendig area in early March 1945 as part of the Western Allied invasion of Germany and the airfield was attacked by Ninth Air Force B-26 Marauder medium bombers and P-47 Thunderbolt fighter-bombers to deny the retreating German forces use of the facility. The airfield was taken about 14 March. Combat engineers from IX Engineer command moved in with the 830th Engineering Aviation Battalion arriving on 10 March 1945, to repair the field for use by combat aircraft. The engineers laid down a 5000' Pierced Steel Planking all-weather runway over the bomb-cratered concrete runway, and performed minimal repairs to the facility to make it operational. On 17 March, the airfield was declared ready for Allied use and was designated as Advanced Landing Ground \\"Y-62 Niedermendig\\".IX Engineering Command ETO Airfields General Construction Information Once repaired, the Ninth Air Force 36th Fighter Group moved in, the first being the 474th Fighter Group, flying P-47 Thunderbolts from the field from late March until early April. The Thunderbolts attacked German army units, bridges and other ground targets of opportunity throughout Germany. When the 36th moved out on 8 April, Niedermendig was used for combat resupply and casualty evacuation by C-47 Skytrain transports until the end of the war in May.Maurer, Maurer. Air Force Combat Units of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History, 1983. . With the end of the war, Niedermendig Air Base was closed on 11 May 1945. The ground station was taken over by Army units as part of the occupation force.Johnson, David C. (1988), U.S. Army Air Forces Continental Airfields (ETO), D-Day to V-E Day; Research Division, USAF Historical Research Center, Maxwell AFB, Alabama. United States Army forces moved out of Niedermendig in the late summer of 1945, as French forces moved into the Rhineland as part of their occupation zone of Germany. On 7 January 1957, the reconstituted German Army Aviation Corps took over Niedermendig air base from the French Armed Forces and re-established a German military presence on the facility. Dornier Do 27 light training aircraft were used for pilot training at the base. On 9 March 1959, SA3 18 Alouette II Helicopters arrived at the airfield. For more than 40 years, this helicopter was to be the training helicopter of the German Army Aviation Corps. The first German Army Aviators School was founded in Niedermendig on 1 July 1959. Its first commanding officer was Colonel Kuno Ebeling. Current use After the military drew out in 2008, the airfield was converted to civilian use, under the ICAO code EDRE. It is home to an aeroclub Sportfluggruppe Mendig e.V., and serves as the setting for several automobile-related television and film recordings, examples are DSF-Motor, Kabel 1 - Abenteuer Auto, RTL2 - Grip, VOX Automobil or SWR Rasthaus. The field's former MBB Bo105 hangars at the north- west side now host aircraft builder Roland Aircraft. From 2015 to 2017 the airfield was also the new home of the rock festival Rock am Ring until it returned to the N√ºrburgring again.

Chieu was a professor at the Higher School of Pali in Phnom Penh, and strongly objected to attempts by the French colonial authorities, beginning in the late 1930s, to romanize the Khmer writing system. Although the reforms were not intended to be applied to religious texts, he began to make vocal criticisms of the French administration. He became associated with two nationalist activists, Son Ngoc Thanh and Pach Chheoun, editor and founder of a pro-independence Khmer- language newspaper, Nagaravatta. The French authorities believed that Thanh, Chieu and Chheoun, with Japanese backing, were attempting to recruit followers for a bid for independence from the French.Kiernan, B.

Chieu was alleged to have preached anti-French sermons to Khmer troops in the colonial militia in preparation of the revolt; the manner of his arrest deeply offended many other members of the sangha. Reaction to Arrest A large demonstration against the arrests, in which many monks took part, was organised two days later in Phnom Penh by Thanh and Chheoun.

It codified previous immigration law, and added four inadmissible classes: anarchists, people with epilepsy, beggars, and importers of prostitutes. It had little impact and its provisions related to anarchists were expanded in the Immigration Act of 1918.  Background  Anarchism came to public attention in the United States with the Haymarket Affair of 1886. On May 4, a policeman was killed and several others were wounded, of which six later died, after a bomb exploded in Chicago's Haymarket Square.Fine, 779 Eight members of the recently formed International Working People's Association (IWPA) were found guilty of the bombing. The IWPA's 1883 manifesto called for the \\"destruction of the existing class rule, by all means, i.e., by energetic, relentless, revolutionary and international action\\". The idea of excluding anarchists from immigrating was first mentioned at a Congressional hearing in 1889.Hutchinson, 97 A bill introduced on July 20, 1894 sought to restrict the entry of anarchists by requiring potential immigrants to visit a U. S. consulate for a political review before immigrating.Hutchinson, 111 A substitute bill proposed a system within the United States to detect, question, and deport immigrants accused of anarchism.Hutchinson, 112 Both died in committee. On September 6, 1901, Leon F. Czolgosz, an American-born son of Polish immigrants and a self-proclaimed anarchist, assassinated President William McKinley.Fine, 780 The police responded by arresting a number of anarchists, including Emma Goldman and a group of Chicago anarchists that published Free Society, the leading English- language Communist-anarchist periodical in the U.S. at the time.Fine, 781 They were all later released because no evidence of conspiracy could be found. And there were some viewpoints in the anarchist opinion which strongly denounced Czolgosz, some calling him a \\"dangerous crank\\", despite what was to come next. Theodore Roosevelt urged the exclusion and deportation of anarchist immigrants in his first address to Congress on December 3, 1901:Hutchinson, 127  Legislation  President Theodore Roosevelt signed the Act, officially \\"An Act To regulate the immigration of aliens into the United States\\", ch. 1012, ,Van Dyne, 93 into law on March 3, 1903, the last day of the 57th United States Congress.Fine, 788Hutchinson, 133 It codified previous immigration law and added four inadmissible classes: anarchists, people with epilepsy, beggars, and importers of prostitutes.Hing, 210 It also allowed for the deportation within two years of anyone unlawfully in the country and raised the head tax on immigrants to the United States to two dollars ($2.00). It further allowed the deportation of immigrants who became a public charge within their first two years in the country. This was the first legislation in the U.S. since the Alien and Sedition Acts of 1798 that called for questioning potential immigrants about their political beliefs.Sarah Vowell, Assassination Vacation (NY: Simon and Schuster, 1999), 220, The Act barred anyone \\"who disbelieves in or who is opposed to all organized government, or who is a member of or affiliated with any organization entertaining or teaching such disbelief in or opposition to all organized government.\\"New York Times: \\"In Defense of Anarchy,\\" December 5, 1903 , accessed May 29, 2011 The law also limited the deportation of non-citizen anarchists to the first three years of their residency in the United States.  Enforcement  The impact of the law was slight. The Commissioner-General of Immigration reported that from the time the law took effect in 1903 until June 30, 1914, a total of 15 anarchists were denied entry to the U.S. He reported that four anarchists were expelled in 1913 and three in 1914.Report of the Commissioner-General of Immigration to the Secretary of Labor for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1914 (Washington, DC: Government Printing Office, 1914), 7, 104-7, 110. The years 1913 and 1914 refer to fiscal years ending on June 30. In October 1903, immediately following a speech given by Scottish anarchist John Turner at the Murray Hill Lyceum in New York, Bureau of Immigration officials arrested him and found a copy of Johann Most's Free Society and Turner's speaking schedule, which included a memorial to the Haymarket Martyrs. This was enough evidence to order his deportation. Emma Goldman organized a Free Speech League to contest the deportation. She recruited Clarence Darrow and Edgar Lee Masters to defend him.Chalberg, 85‚Äì86 After Goldman organized a meeting at Cooper Union of those opposing the deportation, a New York Times editorial argued in favor of the Act and the deportation of Turner. It referred to the people at the meeting as \\"ignorant and half-crazy dreamers\\" and declared that it was the country's \\"right - in the belief of Congress and of many, probably of most, Americans', it makes it our duty - to exclude him.\\" Darrow and Masters presented their defense of Turner before the U.S. Supreme Court. They argued that the law was unconstitutional and that Turner was merely a \\"philosophical anarchist\\" and therefore not a threat to the government. Chief Justice Melville Fuller wrote the Court's decision holding that the Bill of Rights does not apply to aliens and that Congress had the right to deny entry to anyone they deemed a threat to the country. Turner became the first person deported under the act.  Amendment  The Act was re-enacted on June 29, 1906.Tribune Almanac and Political Register: 1909, accessed May 29, 2011 Advocates for using the immigration laws to combat radicalism campaigned to expand the law's definitions of those who could be excluded or deported. Immigration officials complained about the law's limitation on deportation to the first three years of an immigrant's residency: > The anarchist of foreign birth ... remains very quiet, as a rule, until the > time limit protects him from deportation and then he is loud and boisterous > and begins his maniac cry against all forms of organized government. ... > There should be no time limit to the deportation of these criminals ... and > should one remain in hiding sufficiently long to become naturalized he > should, at the first symptoms, be shorn of his cloak and forthwith > deported.Report of the Commissioner-General of Immigration to the Secretary > of Labor for the fiscal year ending June 30, 1913 (Washington, DC: > Government Printing Office, 1914), 227, 259 The 1903 Act was amended by the Immigration Act of 1918, which expanded and elaborated the brief definition of anarchist found in the 1903 Act and enhanced the government's ability to deport adherents of anarchism.Avrich, 133  See also  *Page Act of 1875  Notes  Sources  *Paul Avrich, Sacco and Vanzetti: The Anarchist Background (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1991) *John Chalberg, Emma Goldman: American Individualist (NY: Harper Collins, 1991), *Sidney Fine, \\"Anarchism and the Assassination of McKinley\\", American Historical Review, vol.

History In 1803, the geographic township of Kildare was proclaimed, named after the town in Ireland. At that time, the land was granted as title deeds or as payment for professional services. For example, the Lord of Lavaltrie entrusted the central portion to Mr. Vondevelden to pay for his surveying fees. As for the northern portion, Major Beauchamp Colclough, Crown Commissioner and Land Agent, granted land to English soldiers in 1822. He intended to establish the Town of Kildare, but his dismissal delayed the development of the place. The first inhabitants came from Saint-Paul, Saint- Elizabeth, Lanoraie, and Berthier. Among the early settlers were also many Irish families, who cleared much land, built an English school, built a chapel, and a Protestant cemetery. In 1832, the Parish of Saint-Jacques-de- Kildare was founded, renamed a year later to Saint-Philippe-de-Kildare. It was renamed again to its present name in 1839, since the Anglican, Methodist, and Catholic pioneers all had a devotion to Ambrose of Milan. In 1847, the municipality was first incorporated, but abolished shortly after. In 1855, the Parish Municipality of Saint-Ambroise-de-Kildare was formed, with Charles Laporte as first mayor and D. Maigret as first treasury-secretary. In 1956, the parish municipality lost a part of its territory when the Municipality of Sainte-Marcelline-de-Kildare was formed. On December 6, 2014, Saint-Ambroise- de-Kildare changed from parish municipality to a (regular) municipality. Economy Average income per family is $56,807. 88.20% of residents are home owners, whereas 11.8% of residents are renters.

It is 2 miles east of the larger village of Banks and 2 miles west of the larger village of Hesketh Bank. It is administered by the West Lancashire District Council and North Meols parish council. It falls in the South Ribble parliamentary constituency. History Hundred End railway station was previously a stop on the West Lancashire Railway, fully opened in 1878, which ran between Southport and Preston, carrying both passengers and cargo from the fields of the area to be sold at town markets. Low passenger numbers later led to the railway's decline and its closure was assured by the Beeching Axe in 1964. The station house has since been demolished but the train track can be followed along a footpath that stretches towards Banks. Etymology The hamlet is called Hundred End because it was situated on the boundary between the two hundreds of West Derby and Leyland. Geography The area has similar geography to that of Banks. There is an enclosed salt marsh that is used for grazing cattle and the marshes are managed by the RSPB.Skelcher, G.

IFA and the door and window problem IFAs address a problem for large commercial ICF construction‚Äîdoor and window openings. Under previous construction methods, contractors used wood, vinyl, or light-weight steel to block out door and window openings while pouring the concrete.Kelvin Doerr, \\"Installing Wooden Window Bucks,\\" ICF Builder (April 2005): available here; \\"Vinyl Window Bucks: A Perfect Fit\\" ICF Builder (August/September 2005): available here. On residential projects, with only around 10 to 20 openings, this method sufficed. On larger construction projects, however, these methods of blocking out the openings meet problems: * some architects do not like to use organic materials such as wood in commercial construction, * concrete often shifts while consolidating, and so the dimensions of each opening must be rechecked, * the door or window frame still needed to be installed once the opening was judged plumb and true, * on commercial projects such as schools, hospitals, prisons, or barracks with hundreds of door and window openings, the work demanded for each of these processes at each opening has a serious effect on time and labor consumption. (See, for example, the breakdown of Joseph Warren Middle and High School, with almost 500 IFAs.)J. Andrew Keith and Chris Keith, \\"Integrated Framing and ICF Construction,\\" The Construction Specifier 61.12 (December 2008): 52‚Äì53. IFA design Engineers and construction industry professionals designed IFAs for large commercial projects in order to solve this door and window problem. As 14-gage galvanized hollow metal frames, IFAs are installed prior to the pouring of the concrete, are capable of being anchored into the footer, and function as the method of blocking out the opening and the frame that under previous methods would be installed later. Thus, not only do they keep the opening‚Äôs dimensions firm during concrete consolidation, they are immediately ready to receive doors and windows. Door assemblies even come with hardware preps, and most IFAs come with drywall returns for the interior side of the assembly. Several other elements of IFAs reflect their design for the large commercial ICF construction market. IFAs can meet architectural designs that include sidelights, mullions, view windows, radius frames, etc. IFAs can be used on external walls as well as internal load-bearing walls. IFAs have an optional thermal break for cold- and hot-weather climates.J. Andrew Keith and Chris Keith, \\"Integrating IFAs and ICFs,\\" Construction Canada 51.4 (July 2009): 70. IFAs can meet fire code requirements for doors in, for example, stairwells in commercial buildings. IFA jobsites Since their appearance on their first job site in Kentucky in 2006, IFAs have been used on or are specified for job sites ranging from Scarborough, ME (Walgreens), Burleson, Texas (Burleson Independent School District), and Oahu, Hawaii (Schofield Barracks). Particularly innovative IFA projects are South Warren Middle and High School (Bowling Green, Kentucky, USA), the largest ICF building in North America upon completion, at two stories at 330,000 sq. ft., and Turkey Foot Middle School (Kenton Co., Kentucky, USA), the first job site to use IFAs with the thermal-break design, and Overdale Elementary School (Hillview, Kentucky, USA), where architects adapted the IFA design for mechanical chases.

It follows the activities of several Belarusian pro- democracy youth activists in the four weeks running up to the highly controversial presidential re-election of Alexander Lukashenko on March 19, 2006. The film has won multiple festival prizes.  Plot  In the documentary, 18-year-old Franak Viaƒçorka, a youth activist with the Belarusian Popular Front, prepares with his friends for the run-up to the 2006 presidential election. Their activities range from handing out newspapers, organising rock concerts, distributing flyers, composing protest songs and interviewing the opposition candidate, Alaksandar Milinkieviƒç. Aside from the main theme of the elections, it also touches briefly on the incarceration of Franak's father, Vincuk Viaƒçorka, a professor at the banned Belarusian Humanities Lyceum, where Franak and many of his friends were students. Events come to a climax on the night of the election results, March 19. Following the suspicious landslide victory of Lukashenko, opposition activists and supporters take to the streets in protest, many of them setting up a 'tent city' in October Square in Minsk. By the night of March 23, riot police are deployed to clear the remaining protesters. Two days later on March 25, Belarusian Independence Day riot police clash violently with anti-Lukashenko demonstrators, detaining several, among them Alaksandar Milinkieviƒç. By the end of the film, Franak's father has been released from detention, the battle has temporarily been lost, but the people's spirit is unquenched. According to Franak, the end is nigh for Lukashenko.

It operates a 24/7 service for passengers between Metro Manila and northwest Luzon (the Ilocos corridor). Etymology The name of the company was derived from its founder, Inocencio Aniceto, a native of Ilocos Sur. History The company was founded as a family business of the Aniceto family, which also operates a hotel in Vigan, the \\"Aniceto Mansion Hotel\\". It has become one of the most popular means of traveling to Manila, alongside Philippine Rabbit, the former Times Transit, and the now-defunct Maura Transit (the ruins of its former terminal is just two houses away from Times' (now Dominion's) Vigan terminal, itself a block away from St Joseph's Vigan terminal). During the '80s they operated one of the country's most modern fleets, with top-of-the-line and state-of-the-art buses, as well as, in 1982, the first bus company in the country to deploy MAN Royal Commuter Service buses manufactured by Delta Motors Corporation; and being one of the first few bus companies in Northern Luzon to field Hino \\"Grandtheater\\" buses. During the 90's, financial problems put the company on hard times. The owners had to sell almost all of their buses (including newly acquired Mercedes-Benz units) to Autobus Transport Systems. The firm did not die totally. Even if most of the company's assets were sold in order to somehow gain its loses, Dr. Rodolfo Aniceto, together with his wife, did a herculean task to restore the company. The company was reborn when they acquired a new fleet of surplus buses from Japan (which includes Isuzu Super Cruisers, Hino S'elegas, Hino Blue Ribbons, and a Mitsubishi Fuso Aero Queen) and has returned to some of its old routes. In 2010, the Aniceto Bus Line acquired the \\"Wheels of Fortune Transport\\" tourist bus company, along with a few of its buses, which later became \\"Aniceto Travel Services,\\" in order to cater to the company's ever- growing charter service. In late October 2011, the company started servicing the Baguio-Vigan route for the first time. In the early months of 2017, the bus company started to deploy its newly-acquired King Long buses. Fleet Inocencio Aniceto Transportation is utilizing and maintaining Hino, Isuzu, Mitsubishi Fuso, and Hyundai buses, totalling 17 units (including those from Aniceto Travel Services). They also started using their new King Long buses.

Gnu Theatre Review in LA TImes for \\"True West\\" Theater West - Los Angeles \\"Lifetimes 10: Writers Play With the Puzzle\\" weds humor, drama and a few effortless metaphysical touches to an experience that glides before you like apparitions in a half-dream. The theme is set immediately in the opener, Alan Eisen's \\"Passing Through,\\" in which director Janet Davidson skillfully dramatizes an imaginative fantasy dealing with the fears and expectations of three embryos as they approach birth. A faintly disturbing God-like omniscience is coolly delivered by actor Tom Dahlgren as a piano player. Betty Garrett, in four interludes called \\"7 Minutes of Life,\\" including one as a baby, playfully swirls a choric motif. In \\"1932\\" by Terry Kingsley-Smith (producer Griggs directing sublime performances by Jeanne Bates and Tom Dahlgren) and Drew Katzman's \\"I'm Tired of Looking for Barrymore\\" (Aubuchon staging an uproarious Hollywood cemetery outing between Guy Raymond's carping father and Katzman's patronizing son), the production finds its sturdiest moorings.

From this version was subsequently also derived the 40.10WM civilian version, designed for law enforcement and civil protection. It is in service in the Italian Army in three versions: * VM 90T Torpedo, a tactical vehicle with a tarpaulin covered rear. * VM 90P Protetto, (Protected) fitted with a fully armored body. * Ambulanza VM 90, (Ambulance VM 90), fitted with an ambulance body.

The secure version has a full armor, with a cockpit that replaces the rear platform with tarpaulin version of Torpedo. The armored cockpit is equipped with rear door windows and holes to use the arms without exposing himself, as well as trap-gun or other weapon. The vehicle has been criticized for being unsafe for its crew, as the armor does not offer high protection, but was adopted into service anyway as a temporary solution pending the entry into service of the VBL Puma.See preamble on the data sheet of VM90P in the database of wheeled vehicles of the Italian Army The vehicle was employed in Somalia, during Operation Restore Hope, and in Iraq during Operation Antica Babilonia. Due to his evident lack of safety in war theatre, the VM 90P has never been loved by Italian military personnel; because of a vague resemblance, italian soldiers \\"lovingly\\" nicknamed it as the \\"scarrafone\\" (big ugly cockroach). At that time the deadliest incident involving this kind of armored vehicle took place: on 27 April 2006 in Nasiriya an IED exploded under a VM90P with 5 servicemen on board.

Louise Bates Ames and Frances Ilg alongside Janet Learned after Gesell's retirement from the Yale Child Study Center the previous year. Shortly afterward a Gesell Nursery School was founded adjacent to the institute and provided practical experience to those studying child development.

The CCRL has played a prominent role in Canadian social debates surrounding abortion, same-sex marriage and prostitution, where it has argued from a social conservative standpoint, in line with Catholic social teaching. The organization works closely with other Catholic organizations on social issues that matter for the Church. Media The League opposes what it views as anti-Catholicism and anti-religion in the media. It responds to criticism of Catholic teaching in the media and to comedy programs about Catholic characters which it views as blasphemous, sometimes filing complaints with the Canadian Broadcast Standards Council (CBSC) and Canadian Radio-Television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC). Court and tribunal cases CCRL has been involved in a number of cases which relate to its interpretation of Catholicism, opposing same-sex marriage in several cases in the late 90s and early 2000s, and opposing the Ontario court's decision in the \\"three-parent case\\" which determined that a child's second custodial parent could become his legal parent without a non-custodial biological parent surrendering parental status. It has also taken a socially conservative position in a case challenging Canada's restrictions on prostitution, and advocated for policies protecting discrimination and hate speech against LGBT people, and displays of graphic anti-abortion posters where not permitted, as an expression of religious belief. Lobbying CCRL does not directly campaign for candidates. It has made presentations to parliamentary committees opposing assisted suicide in the mid-90s and at present, and same-sex marriage in 2005.

Scythian king Ishpaka allied himself with the Medians in ca. 678 BCE.: \\"Assyrian records referred to the Scythians as the Ishkuza or Ashkuzai, mentioning them for the first time in the late seventh-century BCE. Led by a chief named Ishpakai, around 678 they allied with the Medes (from Media, a kingdom in what is now northern Iran) and waged war against the Assyrians\\" In the meantime, Ishpakai died in battle against Assyrian king Esarhaddon in ca. 675 BCE,: \\"About 675 the Scythian chief I≈°pakaia (cf. Greek Aspakos) was defeated and killed and his followers confined to the land south of Lake Van. and was succeeded by Bartatua. Kashtariti's alliance crumbled shortly thereafter, and the Assyrians thwarted Kashtariti's forces. In an effort to forge peace with the Assyrians, he married a daughter of Assyrian king Esarhaddon in 674: \\"around 674 BCE Scythian king Bartatua marries Assyrian princess\\" or 676 BCE.: \\"The presumed marriage of Bartatua into the Assyrian royal family, probably in 676, and his consequent legal submission to Esarhaddon were undoubtedly important events in the history of north-west Iran.\\" As a consequence, Bartatua would have had to serve as a vassal to Assyria.: \\"From the legal point of view the queries imply that Bartatua, in marrying Esarhaddon's daughter, had to take an oath of allegiance and thus legally become an Assyrian vassal, and to hold the countries ruled by himself as a fief.\\" Ultimately, although no concrete evidence for the marriage exists, it is implied by the alliance formed between Assyria and Scythia.: \\"History does not explicitly tell us whether Bartatua actually married the Assyrian royal princess, but this seems to ensue from the firm Assyro-Scythian alliance and the loyal support of Assyria by the Scythians nearly to the end of that kingdom.\\" The Scythians, aiding the Assyrians, subjugated Media between 653 and 652 BCE. As a reward for their help, the Assyrians left control of Media to the Scythians.: \\"The agreement seems to have worked; for in 653‚Äì652 the Assyrians defeated Media and left the country to be ruled by the Scythians who had aided them.\\" The Scythians maintained rule over Media until 625 BCE with the rise of Cyaxares as king of Media.: \\"Media submitted in 652 and freed itself soon after 625 when Cyaxares II ascended the Median throne.\\" Bartatua died in ca. 645 BCE, succeeded by his son, Madys.: \\"Bartatua died probably in 645, and he was succeeded by a son Madyes, supposedly by the Assyrian royal princess.\\" References=Sources  * * Category:Scythian rulers Category:645 BC deaths Category:7th-century BC Iranian people Category:Ancient history of Iran Category:7th-century BC rulers ","title":"Bartatua"},{"id":"24607636","text":"Plata v. Newsom, Docket No. 4:01-cv-01351-JST (N.D. Cal.), is a federal class action civil rights lawsuit alleging that the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation's (CDCR) medical services are inadequate and violate the Eighth Amendment, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973. As a result of the case, the CDCR's prison medical conditions were found to be in violation of the Eighth Amendment to the United States Constitution. After repeated violations of a stipulated agreement and order for injunctive relief, the CDCR was held in civil contempt and the medical health care system was placed in receivership. The case was consolidated with Coleman v. Schwarzenegger and assigned to a three-judge court on July 26, 2007 to hear motions for relief pursuant to the Prison Litigation Reform Act. An order to reduce the prison population was entered on January 12, 2010, which California claims is unconstitutional in its appeal before the Supreme Court.

Accessed October 14, 2009.  Stipulation  The plaintiffs and defendants negotiated a stipulation for injunctive relief, which the court approved by court order on June 13, 2002, requiring defendants to provide \\"only the minimum level of medical care required under the Eighth Amendment.\\"  Receivership  However, three years after approving the stipulation as an order of the court, the court conducted an evidentiary hearing that revealed the continued existence of appalling conditions arising from defendants' failure to provide adequate medical care to California inmates. As a result, the court ruled in June 2005 and issued an order on October 3, 2005 putting the CDCR's medical health care delivery system in receivership. The receivership became effect in April 2006.  Three-Judge Court  , a statute created by the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act and further amended by the Prison Litigation Reform Act, sets forth remedies with respect to prison conditions. On October 4, 2006 the Governor Schwarzenegger issued Proclamation 4278, declaring a state of emergency. Following the Governor's issuance of the State of Emergency Proclamation, the plaintiffs in Plata and Coleman filed motions to convene a three-judge court to limit the prison population. During the pending motions, the Little Hoover Commission released its report titled \\"Solving California‚Äôs Corrections Crisis: Time Is Running Out\\" and the CDCR Expert Panel on Adult Offender Recidivism Reduction Programming released its report, both advocating a reduction in prison overcrowding. On July 23, 2007 both the Plata and Coleman courts granted the plaintiff's motions and recommended that the cases be assigned to the same three-judge court. The Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit agreed and, on July 26, 2007, convened the instant three-judge district court pursuant to . = Release Order = On August 4, 2009 the three-judge court ordered that the defendants submit a plan within 45 days detailing \\"a population reduction plan that will in no more than two years reduce the population of the CDCR's adult institutions to 137.5% of their combined design capacity.\\" The panel argued that substantial numbers of those in prison could be released without affecting public safety, through such measures as parole reform, community treatment of non-violent prisoners and release of inmates who have demonstrated good behavior. The state submitted a plan on September 18, 2009 but the plan failed to meet requirements set by the release order. On October 21, 2009 the court rejected the plan, and gave the government until November 12 to submit a corrected plan or it would order the attorneys for the plaintiffs to submit a plan and order it implemented. The state submitted a revised plan on November 12, 2009, and the plan was accepted and entered as an order of the court on January 12, 2010.Order to reduce prison population , three-judge court, convened by the Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit hearing Plata v.

The Portland District is made up of some 1,100 civilian and 6 military personnel. For almost 140 years, the people of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' Portland District have played an important role in the region. In the past, District engineers constructed coastal fortifications, cleared river channels and surveyed the frontier. Future efforts will focus on resource management and a growing role in environmental protection. Portland District has responded to the needs and concerns of the people of this region for more than six generations, and will continue to do so. History (1871‚Äìpresent)=Opening the frontier The Corps' role after the Revolutionary War was to survey and build roads, railways and bridges, to improve navigation on the nation's waterways, and to map the vast, unexplored wilderness that was this nation. But the Corps' Portland District office traces its beginnings to 17 April 1871, when Maj. Henry M. Robert stepped off the steamship Oriflamme onto Portland's bustling waterfront. Robert was there to open the Corps' Portland Engineers Office‚Äîthe forerunner of Portland District. He rented a single room in the Portland First National Bank Building as office space; installed one desk, one paper case, one map case, and four office chairs; then hired a clerk for $150 a month. The goals of the local office were loftier than the actual facility: to eliminate impediments to navigation in the region's rivers and to obtain a precise knowledge of the territory. The region's network of waterways provided the means to export wheat and mining rushes, to import supplies, and to transport passengers. But boats had to be portaged around Cascade Rapids and Celilo Falls with mule-powered tramways. Drifting sandbars caused vessels to run aground and sometimes sink. Snags and debris in the rivers were constant dangers to shipping and coastal harbors were far from safe. The Corps' first river and harbor work in Oregon was in response to a petition to Congress from Portland city officials' for help dredging the river bars that impeded shipping. During the next three decades, Corps engineers surveyed local rivers and rapids, and provided dredging, snagging, rock removal and bank protection. Jetty construction provided safe water at Coos Bay, Yaquina Bay, and the mouths of the Columbia, Siuslaw, Coquille and Nehalem rivers. In 1902, construction was begun on a canal at the four waterfalls between The Dalles and Celilo ‚Äì the sole remaining block to open river navigation for the upriver from the mouth of the Columbia to the current site of the Priest Rapids Dam. Growth and large-scale resource planning We Clear The Way World War II poster for the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Fishing on the Columbia was big business by 1906--fish wheels alone were harvesting one million pounds of fish annually. As early as 1888, the Corps reported concerns about reductions in the numbers of fish and recommended establishing fish hatcheries and regulating salmon fishing. In 1918, the -wide, -deep navigation channel from Portland to the ocean was completed. Ocean-going cargo more than tripled in the next ten years. After disastrous floods affected wide areas of the U.S. in the 1920s, the federal government was directed to help with problems that affected the public interest when they were too large or too complex to be handled by states or localities. Corps' expertise in navigation projects led to related missions: flood damage reduction, shore and hurricane protection, hydropower, water supply and quality, recreation and environmental protection. Congress authorized the first big multiple-purpose project on the Columbia in 1933. Bonneville Dam construction generated thousands of needed jobs and a new era of prosperity for upstream ports, offsetting the impact of the Great Depression. It also covered the dangerous Cascade Rapids, provided fish ladders to protect the region's fish, and generated electricity for local homes and industry. World War II gave Portland District a share of the military construction program‚Äîbuilding training camps, air bases and defense installations in the Northwest. Barges hauling war supplies and ammunition through Bonneville Lock were a common sight. Inexpensive power from Bonneville to busy Portland and Vancouver shipyards and aluminum plants helped the war effort. The Flood Control Act of 1936 marked the official beginning of federal commitment to flood prevention. Flood damage reduction emphasis shifted from keeping flood waters in river channels with dikes and levees, to a system of reservoir storage projects which would contain flood waters until they could be safely released. But the Flood of 1948 was unstoppable. Raging waters inundated roads, eroded developed agricultural land, and submerged 650 blocks of downtown Portland. When a dike ruptured near the town of Vanport, the entire community found itself under water. The 20-day flood took the lives of 39 people and economic losses exceeded $100 million. It was the greatest flood disaster in the history of the Columbia River Basin. But since 1948, new dams and reservoirs have provided additional flood damage reduction. The 1964‚Äì65 flood (a 100-year flood) would have surged over Portland's sea wall and debris would have damaged every bridge crossing the Willamette except the St. Johns if the flood waters had been unregulated by storage. Construction of Corps multiple-purpose projects continued in the 1950s and 60s. When The Dalles Dam opened in 1957, its navigation lock replaced the small, outmoded Dalles-Celilo Canal. The slackwater pool behind the dam flooded rock obstructions in the old open river channel and made irrigation of the adjacent land more economical. The John Day Dam began operating in 1968. A second powerhouse was added at Bonneville in 1981 and major rehabilitation of the hydropower facilities at Bonneville, The Dalles and John Day projects were initiated in the 1990s to meet the region's demand for clean, abundant, inexpensive electricity. A new navigation lock was opened at Bonneville in 1993 to accommodate increased river traffic. The future: a balancing act Portland District encompasses nearly of land and water in Oregon and southwestern Washington. The District's future is tied to helping to balance the region's competing needs for navigation, flood damage reduction, hydropower, fish and wildlife habitat, disaster recovery, irrigation and recreation. Portland District operates navigation locks on the Columbia-Snake Inland Waterway of and maintains over of federal navigation channels and harbors. More than 30 million tons of cargo pass through District ports and locks each year. Flood damage reduction has improved since the days when the Willamette and the Columbia overflowed their banks almost yearly, laying watery waste to whole communities. Although the 1996 flood devastated many areas of Oregon and Washington, it would have been much worse if the Corps hadn't been able to store water behind their dams as it poured into the rivers from uncontrolled tributaries. District flood damage reduction projects‚Äîa $1.2 billion investment have already prevented $15.8 billion in flood damages. With 22 multiple-purpose projects, Portland District produces 60 percent of the region's hydropower to meet the growing demands of public and private utilities, cities and industry. District projects also provide opportunities for fishing, boating, swimming, picnicking, and camping. Corps reservoirs supply irrigation for local farmers and supplement municipal and industrial water needs. But as progress claims more land, habitat for fish and wildlife suffers. Portland District regulates work in water and fragile wetland areas along waterways and in wildlife habitat to preserve the environment. The Corps also controls water released from the dams to protect natural habitats during periods of fluctuating flows. The Corps has a standing mission to provide engineering support in response to major disasters, such as the California earthquakes and Hurricane Andrew. When Mount St. Helens erupted in 1980, the effects on water quality and on the natural recovery of fish, wildlife and plant species were of primary concern in the Corps' response. After the Exxon Valdez ran aground, District dredges recovered nearly 400,000 gallons of oil from the waters of Alaska's Prince William Sound. Corps teams also were able to provide expert rehabilitation support to the people of the Philippines after the 1993 eruption of Mount Pinatubo. The Water Resources Development Act of 1986 authorized the Corps to modify its existing projects for environmental improvement. Changes have ranged from the use of dredged material to create nesting sites for waterfowl, to modification of water control structures to improve downstream water quality for fisheries. Portland District environmental efforts range from large wetlands restoration projects like construction of waterfowl impoundment areas at Fern Ridge Lake, to helping save a small plant like the pink sand verbena or a small creature like the western pond turtle. The biggest challenge Portland District faces may well be that of helping fish pass through the dams safely. Since the 1950s, the Corps has spent more than $70 million researching ways to protect anadromous (migratory) fish in the Columbia-Snake River system. The District has built and funds eight fish hatcheries, and every aspect of upstream and downstream passage is being evaluated. Models of Columbia River projects, like those at the Waterways Experiment Station in Vicksburg, Miss., are helping the Corps find answers and make changes that will work for fish.

It is the sole species in the genus. The adult male has a prominent projection on the head, while the female has a much shorter horn. This structure is probably the result of sexual selection, as in similar beetles. The adult beetle is shiny iridescent rose ranging to green, with intermediates. Henry Dupont originally described the females as a separate species, named Narycius olivaceus, and Westwood later named the green color form as Narycius (Cyphonocephalus) smaragdulus.Westwood, JO (1845) Arcana Entomologica Vol.1.

The surface is matt and the elytra are minutely pitted along lines. The prothorax and scutellum have pits that are irregularly placed. The upper edges of the cephalic horn are nearly straight and parallel and the expand towards the end and the tips are inwardly curving. The prothorax is convex above and is broadest at the middle. The female has a much shorter cephalic horn and colour variants exist. The confusion arising from the sexes being treated as species was resolved only after a pair in copula was collected by the entomologist T.R.D. Bell.

Komu Vnyz's music is a blend of gothic and industrial styles, combined with the lyrics of ancient Ukrainian legends. The band name is a perestroika-time derogatory pun with the term \\"Communism\\". It is literally translated as \\"Who needs to go down\\". \\"2008. –Ü–Ω—Ç–µ—Ä–≤‚Äô—é –∑ –ö–û–ú–£ –í–ù–ò–ó –¥–ª—è –∂—É—Ä–Ω–∞–ª—É Sacratum\\" (\\"2008. An interview of Komy Vnyz for the underground magazine Sacratum\\"), Komuvnyz.com  History  Komu Vnyz got its start in the year 1988. Unknown young actor Andriy Sereda and educator Volodyslav Makarov worked together in the same theater. Sereda and Makarov joined with three more artists (Serhiy Stepanenko, Yevhen Razin, Volodyslav Maliuhin) to make Komu Vnyz. They wound up at their first festival Chervona Ruta completely by chance. It was too late to submit the sample recording to the panel of judges for the tryout, but Taras Petrynenko, after listening to their work, insisted that they participated in the event. They received second place. After releasing their first album \\"Padaya Vverkh\\" (\\"Falling Up\\"), Komu Vnyz and the rest of the Chervona Ruta winners toured in Canada, Poland, and many Ukrainian cities. From 1996 onward, Komu Vnyz came out from the precipice of financial difficulties. Playbills started to appear railings and fences in Kiev for their 1997 concert, In Kastus, named for one of their albums. In 2000 the band played at Ivan Franko theater, performing a concert dedicated to the memory of 300 young students killed under Kruty. They also headlined at the first Ukrainian gothic festival, \\"Dity Nochi\\" (\\"Children of the Night\\"), organized by Ukrainian Gothic Portal, and started to work with UGP. In 2002 the band played at the European gothic festival, Wave Gotik Treffen. In 2003, Makarov left the band. He died in January 2016. As of 2019, the band still continues their activity. Premier Minister of Ukraine, Oleksiy Honcharuk, has even visited \\"Veterans Strong Party\\" war-veteran charity concert where the band performed along with others.  Ideology  The members of Komu Vnyz joined the nationalist party Svoboda in 1995. Svoboda have praised the group, saying that \\"many Ukrainians' initiation into self-awareness [Ukr. —Å–∞–º–æ—Å–≤—ñ–¥–æ–º—ñ—Å—Ç—å, samosvidomist, a term used in Ukrainian nationalism to mean patriotism or nationalism] is from listening to Music for the Higher Spirit [a term Komu Vnyz have used to describe their music]\\". The Ukrainian division of Neo-Nazi music promoter Blood and Honour have stated that the band are \\"the pride of the Ukrainian radical scene\\" and \\"propagate [Blood and Honour's] worldview\\". In 2011, a video went viral in Russia of bandleader Sereda raising his hand in a Nazi salute and stating that \\"to be Ukrainian means to be human, and to be human means to be Ukrainian\\", also calling Ukraine \\"the homeland of the 'Aryan race'\\". He has also called Ukrainians and Russians \\"two different nations with nothing in common\\" and called Jews \\"the aggressor\\".. In 2017, the group performed at a neo-Nazi music festival alongside Die Lunikoff Verschw√∂rung, M8L8TX, Sokyra Peruna and other well-known far-right acts.

He was honoured with People's Artist of the RSFSR and Honored Artist of RSFSR. In the West he was noted for his 1965 video of the Song of the Volga Boatmen.  Early life  He was born in Golumet, Irkutsk Oblast, in 1933. When his father went missing in World War II, his mother brought him up. Between 1934 and 1942 he was at Cheremkhovo, and attended school number 25 from 1941 to 1942. Back at Golumet he attended school from 1942 to 1945, and stayed at Golumet until 1947. For a year from the age of 14 (from 1947 to 1948) he studied to be a welder in F.Z.O. and worked at a plant in Kuibysheva in the Irkutsk Oblast as a moulder and caster. From 1948 to 1950 back in Golumet again, he worked in M.T.S. as an electric welder, meanwhile beginning to perform as a singer.The original 3rd party source for the biography of L.M. Kharitonov, used by the narod.ru site and by L.M.Kharitonov's official site scan of biographical information on vinyl record cover of –†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–µ –Ω–∞—Ä–æ–¥–Ω—ã–µ –ø–µ—Å–Ω–∏ –∏ —Ä–æ–º–∞–Ω—Å—ã (translation: \\"Russian Folk Songs and Ballads\\") in Russian From 17 years old (1950/1951) he was a soloist at Irkutsk Philharmonic and finally was accepted by Moscow Conservatory from 1952 to 1955. This was very difficult because as a Siberian he did not even have a matriculation certificate, but his strong singing voice spoke for him.  Career = With the Alexandrov Ensemble 1953 to 1972  L.M. Kharitonov, 1960s From 9 November 1953 to March 1965 he was a member of the choir in the Red Song and Dance Ensemble of the Soviet Army (later the Alexandrov Ensemble). His place in the choir was always third from the right in the top row. From 1953 to 1955 he served in both the army and the choir. From 1956 to 1959, while still with the choir, he studied at Gnessin State Musical College. His first unofficial public performance as soloist was in the State Kremlin Palace on 18 March 1965. On that day two good friends of his, cosmonauts Pavel Belyaev and Alexei Leonov, travelled into space on the Voskhod 2. During this mission, Leonov became the first human to walk in space. Kharitonov's first official public performance as a soloist was on 22 April 1965. In 1967 he was awarded Honoured Artist of Russia. He continued with the Ensemble until 1972 - so he was with them for nearly 20 years. B.A. Alexandrov was proud of his soloist, and would often shake his hand or hug him publicly onstage after a performance.For example, at the end of at the Tchaikovsky Hall, Moscow, 1965 Kharitonov sometimes sang duets, but only with Ivan Bukreev. Kharitonov had only one singing teacher in his life: Evgeny Avgustovich Kanger, who taught no-one in the Ensemble but the leading soloists, including Evgeny Belyaev.  Independent career from 1972 to 2017  From 1972 to 1998 he was a soloist with the Moscow Philharmonic Society,Moscow Philharmonic Society , i.e. not the company referred to on the Moscow Philharmonic page in Wikipedia and in 1986 was awarded People's Artist of Russia. Being a soloist for the Moscow Philharmonic meant that tours were arranged; he was given bookings by them; an accompanist was provided; but he could arrange his own bookings and pay for a different accompanist outside Moscow, and could accept tours offered by his own clients. During this time, he performed frequently on radio and television. On tour, he visited the entire country and appeared several times at the State Kremlin Palace concert hall. He was considered the pride of Russia, and sang at concerts for the government and for foreign delegations. During the 1970s, ‚Äô80s and ‚Äô90s, Kharitonov went on tour abroad to many different countries, including Czechoslovakia, England, Scotland, the United States, China and Australia. In 1987, he recorded a song called Here's The Mail Troika Rushing which was called Mailtime in the film Blue's Clues. He performed this from 1996 to 2004. From 1998 to 2006 he performed at various venues on a contract basis, giving concerts in Siberia, the German Embassy and Ilya Glazunov Gallery. He was a friend of Anatoly Solovyanenko but they never sang a duet together. Kharitonov never performed in theatrical opera, but sang operatic arias in concert performances.  Worldwide recognition  Like many of the great Russian operatic singers of the Soviet era, this bass-baritone singer who was respected in Russia and who sang fully in the tradition of Chaliapin was largely unknown in the West. This is because his career was overshadowed by the Cold War. However his recordings continue to be re-released worldwide, and this may eventually serve to redress the balance, along with the recent increased exposure of Kharitonov on YouTube.  Critical commentaries on performances 1965 to 1972 = 1965 video of Cliff  Utyos (Russian: –£—Ç—ë—Å)The accepted UK English translation of the songtitle is: The Cliff on the Volga, because it is listed as such by the BBC. Kharitonov singing Cliff at the Tchaikovsky Hall, Moscow, 1965 One of Kharitonov's first solo performances, at age 32 after twelve years in the choir of the Ensemble, was a concert at the Kremlin Palace of Congresses attended by top government officials. As a chorister he was aware of the primary function of the bass part. Whether the part actually does so or not, its effect is to appear to provide a rhythmic and tonal foundation for the musical piece. In other words, particularly when the choir sings a cappella, or when there are no drums, the bass part appears to set both the rhythm and pitch, by virtue of having the heaviest sound. This understanding, and the understanding within Boris Alexandrov's arrangement, is what makes Kharitonov's performance commanding. There is no destabilising ego here. When he sings he sets the melody and dynamic, and establishes all that is to come; the choir appears to settle comfortably above his voice; the choir repeats and follows his lead. This roars to a climax, with the soloist's voice appearing to carry the weight of all Russia's revolutionary optimism. After all, this is a song about Stenka Razin: the first revolutionary; a cross between Attila the Hun and Robin Hood - and this performance made Leonid Brezhnev cry. The screenshot, left, from a concert given at Tchaikovsky Hall in Moscow during the same time period, is an indication of the stage presence which takes on the persona of Razin himself. Ultimately, this is a recording that demonstrates what a bass soloist really is: the musical foundation of a performance.Important: Before editing this critical commentary, please read the section \\"Critical Commentaries\\" on the article discussion page. The sound recording of Cliff can be heard in the 2006 BBC documentary series Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster: Surviving Disaster while brave men swim to their deaths, opening sluice gates below the reactor in the hope of preventing a nuclear explosion. = Historical commentary on 1965 performance of Cliff = This song is about the fate of the 17th-century Russian rebel, Stepan Razin, its lyrics and music written in 1864 by poet, playwright and novelist Alexander Navrotsky.Alexander Navrotsky (in Russian) Biography at the Russian Writers Biographical Dictionary (–†—É—Å—Å–∫–∏–µ –ø–∏—Å–∞—Ç–µ–ª–∏ 1800-1917. –ë–∏–æ–≥—Ä–∞—Ñ–∏—á–µ—Å–∫–∏–π —Å–ª–æ–≤–∞—Ä—å. –¢. 4. –ú., 1999) // Brief Literary Encyclopedia in 9 Volumes, Vol. 5 (–ö—Ä–∞—Ç–∫–∞—è –ª–∏—Ç–µ—Ä–∞—Ç—É—Ä–Ω–∞—è —ç–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—è –≤ 9-—Ç–∏ —Ç–æ–º–∞—Ö. \\"–°–æ–≤–µ—Ç—Å–∫–∞—è —ç–Ω—Ü–∏–∫–ª–æ–ø–µ–¥–∏—è\\", —Ç.5, –ú., 1968) The song was an anthem for revolutionaries of the late 19th and early 20th century in Russia; Lenin often sang it with his comrades-in-arms. The song is still culturally central to Russia.

Sergeev's version was hilariously rumbustuous but possibly overwhelming at close quarters for the ladies. Kharitonov's inebriate is the huge and clumsy but genial Russian Bear: the symbol of Russia beloved of Leo Tolstoy.In War and Peace (1869) The tonality is kept warm and elegant, while the vocal slide from one note to the next ‚Äî and on one occasion a whole glissando - help to create an illusion of musical drunkenness. This is a musical joke, as previously Georgi Vinogradov had taken the vocal slide from drunks and tuneless club singers, and utilised it to showcase his own disciplined vocal skill and consistent vocal quality as he slid from one register to the next.As in the song Luchina (1940s) Kharitonov, in his prime, still has a consistent vocal quality across the registers at the age of 50 years,That is, he can sing up the scale without his voice suddenly sounding different as he goes from one octave to the next. and can surprise the audience by taking a technique which had come to represent sobriety, and hand it back to the music-hall toper. So this performance demonstrates the artistry behind the charm of a comedic bass solo performance.

It is the sequel to King Matt the First, depicting the exile of the young king. The psychologist writes a picture of an angry, sensitive child prince who is crowned king after the illness and death of his parents. The young king learns through life and by individual tuition from various tutors and teachers. Matty‚Äôs learning is, at first, informal and motivated by anger and a strong imagination. However, Matty‚Äôs learning style then becomes analytical and, as time goes by, he becomes a catalyst, a facilitator and a motivator. Editions The book was first published in Polish in 1923 as Kr√≥l Maciu≈õ na wyspie bezludnej. It was not translated into English until 1990. The October 1990 English edition by Joanna Pinewood Enterprises is an unabridged translation from the original, combining two stories published as Little King Matty ...and the Desert Island (). This edition was translated by Dr Adam Czasak and edited by Kzrysztof Bahrynowski. In 2009, Tomasz Chmielik translated the book into Esperanto and held a competition for children from Lublin in Poland to design the front cover. Plot summary Little King Matty...and the Desert Island is a story about freedom, democracy, politics, travel, corruption, tyranny and reform. Matty becomes king after his father‚Äôs death: he then must learn about ‚Äúetiquette‚Äù ‚Äì what kings can do and what they cannot ‚Äì he has to learn to interpret the lies of his adult political advisors ‚Äì and diplomacy ‚Äúall about telling fibs‚Äù. His efforts to bring about reform take him to war with three neighboring kingdoms who try to partition his country. He succeeds in vanquishing them and wins by treaty. However, because his country is bankrupt, the other European countries refuse to provide him with aid to build ships so that he can make his kingdom economically sustainable. So, he goes to the land of the cannibals and witch- doctors where the child king succeeds in making a treaty that saves his kingdom, much to the annoyance of some of his political advisors and two of his vanquished neighbours. The story is romantic; the daughter of the African king, Klu Klu, falls in love with Matty and smuggles herself into his kingdom. She kills a rabid wolf with her dagger, saving Matty‚Äôs life and the people of the capital and becomes the People‚Äôs Heroine. She becomes a role model for all women in Europe and Africa. She learns faster, hunts better and is Matty‚Äôs best warrior. Matty‚Äôs reforms anger his adult enemies, who secretly encourage anarchy and invade his country again. His African warriors and Princess bravely fight alongside Matty, but he is betrayed by some of his cowardly adult citizens. His three enemies partition his country and, in the manner of Napoleon, order the child King to be banished to a deserted Island. However, before this is implemented, Matty escapes from gaol and is rescued by his African Princess and her father who renegotiates Matty‚Äôs sentence. The European kings cheat and Klu Klu‚Äôs father declares war on the whites. During a few paragraphs, there are references to Europe‚Äôs colonial atrocities in Africa and how Europe relies on Africa for goods like chocolate. Matty chooses to go into exile to protect his country. However, he escapes when a swimming postal rat from Klu Klu reaches him with urgent messages; he is kidnapped by his worst and strongest enemy and hides in a maximum security prison where he is cared for and taught by the worst criminals. Later he hides his identity and goes to a school where peer pressure prevents him from doing better, until he loses his temper. He, the victim, nearly becomes a bully. It is here that he learns that this worst enemy wants to go to war against his kingdom for a third time. As anger turns to bitterness, self-analysis saves Matty; Matty uses and learns humour to prevent him becoming maudlin. Thus, he eventually regains his self-confidence and rescues his kingdom. The book ends with Matty first becoming disillusioned, then dying.

The viewing platform offers a view over the airport operations. History The airport was first opened in 1939 as a Luftwaffe military airfield (Fliegerhorst Ober-Olm). It was seized by the United States Army in 1945, and used by the United States as a NATO facility (Finthen Army Airfield) until the end of the Cold War. In 1992, the military airfield was returned to the Federal German government, which made it available to private operators as a civil airport. A United States Army Radar station and a training facility remained at the airport. Luftwaffe use 1939-1945 Originally named Fliegerhorst Ober-Olm, the airfield was built as a Luftwaffe military airfield, which opened in 1939. It was constructed by the Reich Labor Service from 1939 to 1942 as maintained by conscript laborers of the SS special camp Hinzert from 1942 until its capture by the United States Army in 1945. During the early part of World War II, the Luftwaffe stationed several combat units at Ober-Olm during April and May 1940 in preparation for the attack in the West, those being:The Luftwaffe, 1933-45 * Jagdgeschwader 52 (JG 52), Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters * Jagdgeschwader 76 (JG 76), Messerschmitt Bf 109E fighters * Kampfgeschwader 2 (KG 2), Dornier Do 17Z light bombers From Ober-Olm JG 52 and 76 were involved in the air fighting during the Battle of France, both units moving west along with the advancing German forces.

The airfield was taken by elements of the XII Corps, 90th Division, of the Third United States Army under the command of General George S. Patton, Jr. on 22 March 1945. Combat engineers from IX Engineer command moved in with the 832d Engineering Aviation Battalion arriving on 25 March 1945, to repair the runway for use by combat aircraft. The engineers laid down a 5000' Square Mesh (SMT) all-weather runway over the existing east-west (07/25) bomb-cratered concrete runway, and laid out a second 4000' sod runway aligned 08/26. The engineers also performed minimal repairs to the facility to make it operational. On 27 March, the airfield was declared ready for Allied use and was designated as Advanced Landing Ground \\"Y-64 Ober Olm\\".IX Engineering Command ETO Airfields General Construction Information Once repaired, the Ninth Air Force 10th Reconnaissance Group moved in, with photo-reconnaissance P-38 Lightning (F-4) and P-51 Mustang (F-5) aircraft to provide forward tactical reconnaissance to Army ground units moving into central Germany.

Air Force Combat Units of World War II. Maxwell AFB, Alabama: Office of Air Force History, 1983. . In addition to the combat units, C-47 Skytrain transports used the grass runway for combat resupply and casualty evacuation (S&E;) missions constantly, moving munitions and supplies up to the battlefield and evacuating wounded to rear areas.Johnson, David C. (1988), U.S. Army Air Forces Continental Airfields (ETO), D-Day to V-E Day; Research Division, USAF Historical Research Center, Maxwell AFB, Alabama. With the end of the war, Ober Olm Airfield was closed on 20 June 1945. United States Army forces moved out of Ober Olm, as French forces moved into the Rhineland as part of their occupation zone of Germany. Postwar/Cold War use The airport was taken over by the French military in July 1945, and engineers moved in to clear the wartime wreckage and rebuild the facility. The wartime runways were removed and a new, 1,000-meter-long asphalt runway was laid down. In the spring of 1949, the French withdrew from the Rhineland (Rhineland-Palatinate after 30 August 1946) as part of the establishment of the Federal Republic of Germany (German: Bundesrepublik Deutschland, BRD) on 23 May 1949. As part of their commitment to NATO, US Armed forces returned to the Mainz area and took over the airfield, which was renamed Finthen Army Airfield. As a result of the establishment of the United States Air Force in 1947, the Army could use the airfield for helicopters, light LSO and observation aircraft only.

The battalion had 2 Attack Companies, 1 Combat Support Company and 1 Aviation Intermediate Maintenance Company (AVIM). Battalion HQ, attack and maintenance companies were located at Finthen Army Airfield. The Combat Support Company was dislocated at Bad Kreuznach and Baumholder Army Airfields. The CSC, with 41 aircraft, was the largest company in the battalion. Its mission was to support the divisional brigades, the Division Support Command, Division Artillery and the Division Command Group. The 2 attack companies, with 42x AH-1S Cobra/Tow, 6x UH-1 Utility, and 28x OH-58's observation helicopters, gave the division a mobile and flexible anti-armor capability. The OH58's and Cobras worked as teams, using Nap of the Earth flight techniques. The division's anti-armor capability was increased with the highly maneuverable asset when integrated with armor and infantry. The AVIM kept all the aircraft mechanically combat ready to perform the missions. 1973-1988 \\\\- TRANSCOM/4th Transportation Brigade/205th Aviation Company (assault support) operating 16x CH-47 cargo helicopters and 2x UH-1H's.

In the course of the war of the United States against Libya in 1986/87, the area was cordoned off because of the increased need for security fencing and militarily. Current use With the end of the Cold War and the subsequent reorganization of U.S. forces, Finthen Army Airfield began to be closed down beginning in December 1991. In September 1992 the airfield was decommissioned and the facility turned over the Federal Republic of Germany. Today however there is a small unit remaining which is being operated by the US Army 1st Military Intelligence Battalion. This TENCAP unit relocated in 2005 from Bad Aibling and is a SIGINT and IMINT gathering detachment which is operational from 2006. 1st Mil Intel Btn is under command of 66th Military Intelligence Brigade at the Lucius D.Clay Kaserne, Wiesbaden. Since the withdrawal of the US Army, the airfield has been operated by the Mainz Aviation Club beginning in 1994, and on 1 August 2008, turned over to a commercial airport operator. The airport has numerous World War II relics, the largest being the wartime German hangar. Several concrete dispersal hardstands can be found to the north side of the runway, along with the wartime parking apron. On the south side of the runway the wartime grass runway is still in use, along with the outline many dispersal pads and taxiways still visible in the grass area south of the runway.

He is now remembered for an attack on the American colonists, prompted by their indifference to episcopacy. Life The son of Edward Ewer, born at Belchamp St Paul, Essex. He was educated at Eton College, and matriculated in 1724 at King's College, Cambridge, of which he became Fellow in 1727. He took the degrees of B.A. 1728, M.A. 1733, and D.D. 1756. On leaving college he was appointed assistant-master at Eton. He afterwards become tutor to John Manners, Marquess of Granby (1721-1770), who presented him to the richly endowed rectory of Bottesford, Leicestershire in 1735: Ewer went as Lord Granby's tutor on his Grand Tour of 1739-1740. On 1 March 1738 he was appointed by patent to a canonry of Windsor, with which he subsequently held the rectory of West Ilsley, Berkshire. In 1749 he became rector of Dengie, Essex, and on 4 November 1751 was instituted prebendary of Moreton cum Whaddon in Hereford Cathedral. He was raised to the see of Llandaff on 13 September 1761. Ewer took occasion, in a sermon preached before the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts, 20 February 1767, to reproach the American colonists because they failed to see any use for bishops or episcopally ordained ministers. He then proceeded to brand them as \\"infidels and barbarians\\" living in \\"dissolute wickedness, and the most brutal profligacy of manners\\". There were replies from Charles Chauncy of Boston, in A Letter to a Friend, dated 10 December 1767, and in a Letter to Ewer himself, by William Livingston, governor of New Jersey, in 1768.

There is a debate as to whether this discipline is an art or science. In general, it can be considered as a branch of the social sciences and parallel to the field of history. History studies the past, futures studies considers the future. Futurology (colloquially called \\"futures\\" by many of the field's practitioners) seeks to understand what is likely to continue and what could plausibly change. Part of the discipline thus seeks a systematic and pattern-based understanding of past and present, and to determine the likelihood of future events and trends.

later decorated by both the British and Argentine governments for his distinguished conduct during the conflict. He went on to practise and give lectures to medical establishments on his experiences. He was a co-founder, with Denzil Connick, of the South Atlantic Medal Association formed in 1997. He was also the only person to be decorated by both sides for his work in the Falklands War. Background Jolly was educated at Stonyhurst College and subsequently studied Medicine at St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College (now Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry) in London, and qualified as a physician in 1969. While working as a houseman, a senior colleague suggested he join the Royal Naval Reserve as a Royal Navy doctor. Career He became Medical Officer to 42 Commando RM, who were deployed in Belfast along with men of the 3rd Battalion, Parachute Regiment, with whom he built a strong friendship. In 24 years of service, he completed two tours with the Fleet Air Arm as a Fleet Surgeon, Medical Officer recruitment/Officer training in the Dartmouth Training Ship , and at the Britannia Royal Naval College. Falklands War As Officer Commanding Medical Squadron of the Commando Logistic Regiment Royal Marines, Jolly was Senior Medical Officer of 3 Commando Brigade RM and commanded the field hospital at Ajax Bay. The facilities at Ajax Bay were set up in an old refrigeration plant situated next to an ammunition dump, as those were the only roofed buildings available of any size fit for purpose. Because its position was close to legitimate military targets, Brigadier Julian Thompson ordered they were not to paint a Red Cross on the building's roof to highlight the hospital, due to the terms of the Geneva Convention.https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=IovpCgAAQBAJ&lpg;=PP90&ots;=27bjvANAb7&dq;=brig%20%22julian%20thompson%22%20red%20cross%20roof%20geneva&pg;=PP90#v=onepage&q;=brig%20%22julian%20thompson%22%20red%20cross%20roof%20geneva&f;=false The conditions in the field hospital were poor and despite the dirt, poor lighting, air attacks and the presence of two unexploded bombs, only three of the 580 British soldiers and marines wounded in action were to die of their wounds and none while under the care of Jolly.\\"Falklands Combat Medics\\" Interview with Jolly and documentary narration, first broadcast by The Military History Channel on 1 April 2012 Post-war Before visiting Argentina in 1998, Jolly had sent ahead a list of Argentine casualties and asked the authorities there what had become of them.

The Argentinian award made Jolly the only serviceman to have been decorated by both sides after the conflict.

He worked for the International Red Crescent, The New York Times and Afghan state radio at various times during his career in journalism. Munadi was killed by friendly fire on September 9, 2009, in a British Special Boat Service special forces raid meant to rescue Stephen Farrell and Munadi, who were both captured by Taliban forces near Kunduz four days earlier. Biography=Early life Munadi was born in Astana, Bazarak District, in Panjshir province, Afghanistan, on November 22, 1976. Munadi, an ethnic Tajik, grew up around the family's farm in the village of Astana in the Panjshir Valley. His father fought against Soviet forces during the Soviet‚ÄìAfghan War in the 1980s. The family's home in Astana, which was used as a command post by the mujahedeen, was bombed by Soviet troops. Munadi and his brothers rebuilt the family home by hand following the bombing. Munadi attended Amir Sharali Khan Primary School. He graduated from Nadiria High School in 1991. Career Munadi was accepted into the journalism program at Kabul University in 1995. He also took a course in English while studying journalism at the university. In 1996, the Taliban seized control of the city of Kabul, forcing Munadi to temporarily abandon his undergraduate studies. He eventually received his bachelor's degree in journalism from Kabul University. Munadi worked as a press officer and liaison for the International Red Cross and Red Crescent's local office in Gulbahar, Parwan Province, during the period of Taliban control from 1997 until 2001. He coordinated communications between the office in northern Afghanistan and the ICRC main headquarters in Kabul. Munadi joined the Afghan staff of the New York Times in 2002, following the ouster of the Taliban and establishment of an interim government. Munadi worked as a local correspondent in the Kabul office for the New York Times and contributed reports to the headquarters in New York City. He also translated Dari, Pashto and English documents and reports for the newspaper. Munadi remained with the New York Times until 2006. In 2006, Munadi joined the staff of Good Morning Afghanistan (GMA), which is produced by AwaNama Productions. He was employed as a production manager for the radio show, and performed the tasks of editor, director and radio producer. He was later promoted to the editor of the show's website and radio broadcasts, and assigned stories to journalists. Munadi moved to Germany in early 2009, where he enrolled in a graduate program at University of Erfurt School of Public Policy towards a master's degree in public policy, good governance and journalism. He returned to Afghanistan from Germany twice during 2009. Kidnapping and death Munadi returned to Afghanistan from Germany during his summer break to visit his wife and two children. The New York Times contacted Munadi while he was in Afghanistan to ask him to assist its foreign correspondents in the country. On September 5, 2009, Munadi and New York Times journalist Stephen Farrell, a British‚ÄìIrish colleague, were kidnapped by the Taliban in northern Afghanistan near Kunduz. Farrell and Munadi were in the area interviewing local residents about a recent NATO airstrike on two fuel tankers (that had been kidnapped by Taliban militants) which had allegedly killed Afghan civilians. Munadi and Farrell were held by Taliban militants for four days. The Taliban treated Farrell rather well, but were increasingly threatening and abusive to Munadi while he was in captivity. The Taliban reminded Munadi of a 2007 kidnapping in which an Italian reporter, Daniele Mastrogiacomo, was freed while his Afghan translator was killed and beheaded. Munadi had called his parents at 10:30 pm on September 8 to report that he and Farrell were safe. His parents immediately left their home in Kabul to travel to Kunduz to await a possible release. British Military Intelligence discovered the house in which Munadi and Farrell were being held. On September 9, 2009, British Special Boat Service special forces raided the home to rescue the captives. Farrell was rescued, but Munadi was shot and killed in the firefight between the Taliban and British forces. It was later concluded that Munadi was shot in the front by a British soldier while he was also apparently shot by Taliban bullets while trying to get to the helicopter after the British mistook him for an enemy militant.p.55-58, The British Army in Afghanistan 2006‚Äì14, Leigh Neville, Squadron-Signal, 1998 Munadi's body was left at the scene and his parents reportedly had to collect his body themselves. Neither the New York Times nor the Munadi or Farrell families knew about the planned rescue attempt in advance. Munadi's death and the failure to retrieve his body resulted in widespread anger among Afghan journalists, claiming that Munadi's death revealed a double standard by international forces over the treatment of Western reporters versus local Afghan journalists.
