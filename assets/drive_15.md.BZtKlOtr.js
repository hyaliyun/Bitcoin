Ekel's works have been displayed Internationally: the Netherlands, France, Belgium, Spain, Mexico, Italy, Turkey, Czech Republic, Singapore, South Africa, the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia and the United States.  Biography Fendry Ekel migrated in the 80's with his family from Indonesia to Europe. He studied in Amsterdam (1992 - 1997) at Gerrit Rietveld Academie and (1998 - 1999) at Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten where he met painters Narcisse Tordoir, Luc Tuymans and Michelangelo Pistoletto as mentors. In 1999 Fendry Ekel was an Artist in Residence at Cittadellarte, Fondazione Pistoletto in Biella, Italy. Fendry Ekel's migration as teenager from Indonesia to Europe was a radical move that has given rise to a continuing fascination for investigating his surroundings. Architecture and the urban landscape is a perfect setting where abstraction and figuration meet each other in reality. It is in this setting that Ekel preferably locates the subjects of his paintings. Fendry Ekel's paintings explore the shadow side of human ambition. In his art practice Ekel is intrigued by the power of cliche, producing images intended to create an unguarded moment in seeing when cliches are twisted into an unexpected new awareness and a kind of simultaneous D√©j√† vu. His large- scale, layered works are often based on black and white photographs depicting portraits, architecture, monuments or other remnants of historic events. By appropriating these images from our collective memory, Ekel critically investigates the use of art, architecture and figuration as propaganda for ideology, confronting himself during the creative process with borderlines where ethical and aesthetic values intersect. In 2013 Fendry Ekel initiated a series of works entitled 'Investigation' paintings.http://www.arndtberlin.com/website/artist_27130_image In this series Ekel unveils layers of forgotten and untold stories, exploring the most elementary motives behind the human desire to create myths of their own time. (The Sultans Of Indonesian Art, Flash Art 282, 2012) ... Like Ashley Bickerton, who has lately emerged from a self-imposed exile in Bali, Fendry Ekel has in recent years returned to his homeland with a profoundly altered awareness of the role of memory and artifice in history and art. Having lived in the Netherlands since the age of 14 when his family emigrated from Indonesia, Ekel creates artwork and institutional structures that simultaneously craft and consume messages about ego and influence. While his studio practice falls within traditional lines of production, primarily creating well-researched and beautifully executed works on paper, Ekel‚Äôs institutional practice as co-founder of artists initiative Office: for Contemporary Art (OFCA) International in Yogyakarta, focuses on developing organizational networks and ‚Äústructural friendships.‚Äù By consciously adopting the conflicted roles of both the romanticized studio painter and art world insider/strategist, he twists clich√©s and demands we pay close attention to history and inner prejudice. Take for example the lifecycle of his iconic Young Gropius As Soldier (2007), an image that both illuminates and obscures the identity of an historic public figure by complicating the story of Walter Gropius, the director of the highly influential Bauhaus, with unsettling and questionable references to his military history in the German army. Once completed, the artist distanced himself from the creative impetus through strategic efforts as an employee of OFCA International to place the work in the public realm through exhibitions and publications, thereby legitimizing its value and ensuring its consumption. This effort is, in fact, part of the conceptual completion of the work and reflects Ekel‚Äôs efforts to ‚Äúpull the strings‚Äù of a system that demands his assimilation/loyalty and yet refuses entrance on grounds of his ‚Äúotherness.‚Äù See also * I Nyoman Masriadi ReferencesExternal links *The New York Times *HVCCA, New York *OFCA INTERNATIONAL(OFFICE For Contemporary Art, International) * *Flash Art, The Sultans Of Indonesian Art Category:1971 births Category:Living people Category:People from Jakarta Category:Indonesian painters Category:Dutch painters Category:Dutch male painters Category:Contemporary painters Category:Indonesian emigrants to the Netherlands ","title":"Fendry Ekel"},{"id":"24563060","text":"Pine Brook is an unincorporated community in Isanti County, Minnesota, United States.

Provo, UT, USA: was an American cartoonist best known for his syndicated gag panel, Life's Like That, which offered a humorous look at human nature, with a focus on American society and family life, for more than five decades.  Biography  Growing up in Nappanee, Indiana, Neher was 12 years old when he was paid $2.00 for doing a drawing of a woman hanging clothes with a new type of clothespin. While he was a student at Nappanee High School, he took the Landon School of Illustration and Cartooning correspondence course. Neher succeeded in selling a cartoon to the popular humor magazine Judge before he graduated from high school in 1922. He furthered his art study at the Chicago Academy of Fine Arts, and after graduation, he worked as an assistant to cartoonist Arch Dale, doing lettering and backgrounds on Dale's comic strip Doo-Dads. Neher recalled: > Several years of work on this strip gave me experience enough to attempt my > own strip, Otto Wall, a radio strip. A golf strip, Layon McDuff, came next, > followed by Goofey Movies, an animal strip, and Just Like Us, a kid strip, > which appeared in the first issue of Family Circle magazine and thereafter > for four years. From 1930 to 1934, I freelanced to magazines, having some 40 > markets, including Punch, the English magazine. I was the first American to > sell to Punch in 20 years. One example of his freelancing was a Mickey Mouse-themed cartoon in the September 1932 issue of Photoplay. The radio-themed cartoons of Otto Watt ran adjacent to newspaper radio program listings. Neher drew Goofey Movies for five years, along with gag cartoons for 42 magazines, including Collier's and The New Yorker, when the Bell Syndicate launched Life's Like That on October 1, 1934. It ran until 1941, disappearing from newspapers during World War II, but returning in 1945.Morehead, Toni. \\"The Nappanee Six\\". In 1951, Neher and his family moved to Boulder, Colorado, where he taught cartooning at the University of Colorado for 12 years. Retirement and death Fred Neher's Life's Like That (October 13, 1952). Caption: \\"It's from Adam's Bootery... I tried on my one millionth pair of shoes there this afternoon.\\" Neher stopped doing the Life's Like That Sunday half-page in October 1972, and he retired five years later, devoting his energy to playing golf, raising roses and growing tomatoes. When he died at age 98 in Boulder, Colorado in 2001, Owen S. Good wrote in the Rocky Mountain News: :He is survived by pot-bellied businessmen, henpecked husbands, worldly-wise goldfish and babies with thin curlicues of hair, all actors in the everyday comedies he staged on the funny pages.Rocky Mountain News, September 26, 2001. Books Neher's cartoons were reprinted in various books and publications, such as Thomas Craven's Cartoon Cavalcade (1943) and the November 1945 issue of Cartoon Digest. His 96-page book Will-yum (a recurring character from Life's Like That not related to Dave Gerard's popular Will-Yum strip for National Newspaper Syndicate) was published by Berkley Books in 1958, followed by Hi-Teens (Berkley, 1959). Archives He donated his Life's Like That cartoon originals, scrapbooks, published books, magazines and correspondence to the University of Colorado Library Archives (where they fill 36 linear feet). As he described it, \\"Univ. of Colo. ask to have all my original drawings for safe keeping... came in a truck and left me only my shorts.\\" At the Syracuse University Special Collections, the Fred Neher Papers collection contains correspondence, clippings, published material and approximately 100 original cartoons from the 1960-65 run of Life's Like That.

Foshay was an American businessman, who built a fortune buying utilities throughout the Midwest in the early 20th century.William Swanson, \\"Wilbur Foshay: Crook,\\" Twin Cities Business Magazine. September 2009. Foshay had built up three different utility company empires; selling each one in turn to fund the acquisition phase of the next. His second empire included three utility companies that served the Crookston, Bemidji, and Hallock areas in northern Minnesota (all are today served by Otter Tail Power Company). As he worked on his third and largest utility empire, Foshay built the Foshay Tower in Minneapolis, Minnesota, which opened in August 1929. In 1932 he was convicted of conducting a \\"pyramid scheme\\" with shares of his own stock. He was sentenced to 15 years in prison. President Franklin Roosevelt commuted 10 years from Foshay's sentence, but Foshay only actually served three years in Leavenworth because of \\"good behavior.\\" President Harry Truman granted Foshay a full and unconditional pardon in 1947. The remnants of this third company became the basis for Citizens Utilities. Foshay's trial Foshay's trial was a public spectacle at the time. Journalists, investors, and the general public all wanted to know how Foshay had misled them. At one point during the trial, Foshay claimed he was colorblind to explain peculiar marks in his accounting books‚Äî\\"in the red\\" and \\"in the black\\" were marked by symbols rather than ink color, when really these marks represented which entries were artificially inflated. The trial lasted six weeks. The jury deliberated, but could not reach a consensus. All the male jurors voted for conviction, but Mrs. Genevieve Clark stubbornly held out. A mistrial was declared. It was later discovered that Genevieve Clark had worked for the Foshay Company at one time, and that her husband knew Foshay personally through doing business with him. Clark was charged with contempt of court. A Supreme Court appeal failed. She was sentenced to six months in prison. Clark was publicly humiliated for her actions as a juror in the case. To avoid surrendering to authorities, she and her family disappeared. Clark, her husband and two young boys were found dead from intentional carbon monoxide poisoning.James Parsons, \\"Foshay's Folly.\\" Twin Citian. March 1966. A second trial was held, and Foshay was convicted and sentenced to 15 years in prison.

Magee played club rugby for Bective Rangers and London Irish and played international rugby for Ireland and was part of the British Isles team in their 1896 tour of South Africa. Magee was capped 27 times for Ireland, ten as captain, and won two Championships, leading Ireland to a Triple Crown win in the 1899 Home Nations Championship. Magee was one of the outstanding half backs of world rugby prior to 1914, and is credited as being a driving force in turning Ireland from a no-hope team into one that commanded respect.Godwin (1984), pg 75. Rugby career Magee came from a well known sporting family. His eldest brother Joseph Magee was also an international rugby player for Ireland, while another brother James played cricket for Ireland. His brother-in-law, Tommy Little, played rugby for Ireland between 1898 and 1901.Godwin (1984), pg 44. Magee played almost the entirety of his rugby for club team Bective Rangers, as did both his brothers. In 1898, while in London, Magee was approached by newly formed club, London Irish, to play for the first team. When Magee accepted, his presence in the team helped recruit other countrymen to join the exile club, and is seen as a major catalyst in the success of the club.London Irish ‚Äì A Brief History london- irish.com Early international career Magee first played international rugby during the 1895 Home Nations Championship in an encounter with England. Magee was selected along with his brother Joseph, but Joseph's international career ended after only two games, playing in only the first two matches of the 1895 season. Although Ireland narrowly lost the opening game, Magee scored the only points for Ireland when he scored his first international try. Magee was reselected for the next two games of the Championship, Ireland losing both narrowly in two tight matches which saw Ireland end bottom of the table for the season. British Isles tour 1896 was a turn around in fortunes for Ireland, beating England and Wales and drawing 0‚Äì0 with Scotland, giving Ireland its second Championship in three years. Magee played in all three games of the season making him a Championship winning player. Towards the end of the 1896 season, Magee was approached by Johnny Hammond to join his British Isles team on their tour of South Africa. Magee accepted, and was joined on the tour by his brother James, who was also a member of Bective Rangers. The tour was notable for the large contingent of Irish players, who had been poorly represented on previous tours. The other Irish players being Thomas Crean, Robert Johnston, Larry Bulger, Jim Sealy, Andrew Clinch, Arthur Meares and Cecil Boyd. Magee played in only fourteen of the 21 arranged games of the tour, but played in four Test games against the South African national team. In the First Test he was partnered at half back with Matthew Mullineux, but for the final three tests he was joined by Cambridge University player Sydney Pyman Bell. 1899 Home Nations Championship On his return to Britain, Magee retained his position in the Ireland national team, and from his first game in 1895 he played at centre for 26 consecutive games taking in eight Championship seasons. Magee's finest season was the 1899 Home Nations Championship, which saw him gain the captaincy of the national team in the opening game of the campaign, a home match against England. Ireland won 6‚Äì0, with Magee scoring with a penalty kick and long term Irish half back partner, Gerald Allen, scoring a try. Magee then set up two of the tries in a 9‚Äì3 victory of Scotland,Griffiths (1987), pg 3:11. leaving the encounter with Wales as the decider for the Triple Crown. The game was played at Cardiff Arms Park in front of a record crowd of 40,000, who constantly disrupted the game as the spectators spilled onto the pitch.Godwin (1984), pg 57. The game was decided by a single try by Ireland's Gerry Doran, but Magee was called into action preventing a try from one of the Welsh three-quarters in the last minute with a tackle from behind. The win gave Ireland the Triple Crown for the second time in the country's history. 1900‚Äì1904 Magee continued to captain his country over the next two seasons, but he did not experience the same success as in the 1899 campaign. A single draw against Scotland was the best result in 1900, and apart from a good win over England in 1901 and a strong three-quarters, there was little to celebrate in the Irish results. The 1902 Championship saw Magee lose the captaincy to half back John Fulton. Ireland lost their opening match against England, but after a win over Scotland, Magee was handed the captain's position for the final encounter, against Wales. Ireland were well-beaten in their biggest home defeat since the start of the Championship competition.Godwin (1984), pg 67. The 1903 Championship started with a strong win over England, but the Irish captaincy was now in the hands of Harry Corley, Magee's half back partner since the start of 1902. Magee was seen as one of the finest half backs to come out of Ireland, his playing style was of a basic left-side, right-side tradition of half back play; Corley was one of the first specialised fly-halves,Griffiths (1987), pg 3:12. pointing the new way forward in rugby play. Ireland failed to capitalise on their strong opening game, losing narrowly to Scotland and then being completely out-classed by Wales. losing 18‚Äì0. Magee was dropped for the 1904 Home Nations Championship, replaced by Robinson and Kennedy, as Corley was moved to the centre position. But the team were well beaten by both England and then Scotland, leading the Irish selectors to make eight changes in the final match at home to Wales. Magee was recalled to partner Kennedy in his final international, and the game turned out to be the match of the season.Griffiths (1987), pg 3:13. The Welsh took an early lead, but after Ireland were reduced to 14 men through an injury, the team appeared inspired and improved their game. With four tries from each side, the only difference was that Ireland managed to convert one of their tries, whereas Wales missed all theirs. Magee finished his international career with a great win, and with 27 appearances was the most capped Irish player to date.

It is the first video game in the Carnivores series of hunting games. Storyline Carnivores is set in the year 2190. During an exploration mission in unknown space, a science vessel known as FMM UV stumbled upon a planet with a climate similar to that of Earth, making it suitable for life. The new planet was code-named FMM UV-32. During the initial scouting expedition, the planet was declared inhospitable for colonization due to its unstable terrain and an unexpected abundant population of dinosaurs and other prehistoric reptiles. News articles about FMM UV-32 led an Earth corporation to purchase the rights to the planet and to create DinoHunt Corporation, which allowed customers to hunt the planet's dinosaurs. Gameplay At the start of a new game, the player is given a choice whether to create a new game or continue playing from a previous account. The aim of the game is hunting dinosaurs to accumulate trophies and earn points which will unlock better weapons and the rights to hunt more diverse species of dinosaurs. A novice hunter starts with zero points, and is only given a shotgun, crossbow and a few starter dinosaurs to hunt, each dinosaur can grant the player a different set of points required to level up. If the player is killed by a dinosaur, all points accumulated on that specific hunt are forfeited. The player must be picked up by DinoHunt to keep the points he earned. There are three tiers for a hunter, novice, advanced and expert. A hunter will become Advanced after earning 100 points, and Expert with 300. To begin a hunt, the player must choose the location, the weapon, the dinosaur and some hunting accessories which help the player but will deduct the score during that hunt. Each location is unique, with varying difficulties and terrain. The new hunter will be given three areas, with two more added for the Advanced hunter and a final area for the Expert hunter, for a total of six locations. Level locations include jungles, and deserts accompanied by pyramids and an ancient temple. Next, the player must choose a dinosaur to hunt. A new hunter will be given the choice of four dinosaurs: Parasaurolophus, Stegosaurus, Pachycephalosaurus and Allosaurus. An Advanced hunter gains the ability to hunt the Triceratops and the Velociraptor. Only an Expert hunter can hunt the Tyrannosaurus rex. Harmless creatures such as Moschops, Gallimimus and Dimorphodon are present in each level. They are worth zero points and can be killed with a single shot. The player must also choose a weapon, which can be set for kill or tranquilize for additional points. A beginning hunter can only use a shotgun or a crossbow. A sniper rifle is unlocked upon becoming an Advanced hunter. First time hunters can use the Observation Mode to familiarize themselves with dinosaur behavior and different terrain. Development and release Carnivores was developed by Action Forms, using the AtmosFear game engine. In designing the game's dinosaurs, the development team referenced bones, paintings, and the Jurassic Park films. WizardWorks published the game for Microsoft Windows, releasing it in the United States on November 30, 1998. The game was initially available through WizardWorks' website, followed by a release in retail stores in December 1998. Reception According to GameRankings, the game has a rating of 64 percent. Trent C. Ward of IGN praised its dinosaur and environment sounds, but believed that the game was \\"too damn easy,\\" stating that it was \\"a surprisingly entertaining game that just doesn't have enough options to keep players busy for the long term.\\" Greg Kasavin of GameSpot praised its sound effects, and its levels for looking \\"surprisingly authentic,\\" but noted that the game is \\"tantalizing yet not quite complete to be entirely satisfying.\\" Tom Chick of Computer Gaming World praised the dinosaurs and environments, but stated that the game can be a little tedious for players who are not into hunting games, although he noted that \\"This is clearly a game about stalking rather than action\\". Don St. Jon of GamePro was disappointed by Carnivores as an action game, but stated that it was a \\"mildly pleasant surprise\\" as a hunting game. Jon stated that the game showed \\"its budget status in some ways\\" such as the minimal weapon and level choices, as well as the repetitive appearance of the environments, but he concluded that the game's action elements \\"take it a notch above most hunting titles\\". Game Revolution praised the realistic appearance and behavior of the game's dinosaurs, as well as the large environments and the graphics, but criticized the game for \\"long periods of boredom and tedium\\". Andrew Bub of Computer Games Magazine noted that the game's story was \\"weak and more than a bit silly,\\" but he praised its graphics, sound, and the \\"challenging and surprisingly fun\\" gameplay. Michael L. House of AllGame praised the graphics and the lack of music, writing, \\"Ambient sounds definitely let you feel as if you've arrived in a prehistoric landscape.\\" House also praised the limited amount of ammunition available on each hunt, stating that it made the game \\"much more grounded in fact ‚Äì it just doesn't offer a chance for the undisciplined trigger-happy hunter to blast away at anything that moves without ever running out of ammunition.\\" Legacy Carnivores was the first installment in what would become a series. The first sequel, Carnivores 2, was released in 1999, followed by Carnivores: Ice Age in 2001 and Carnivores: Cityscape in 2002. Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter, the fifth installment in the series and an updated port of the original Carnivores game, was released in 2010. Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter HD, a sequel in the series and a modern remake of the original Carnivores game, was released in 2013. Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter Reborn, the seventh installment in the series, was released in 2015, as a sequel to Carnivores: Dinosaur Hunter.

He stopped his father's latest war against Siam at his accession, effectively ceding Lan Na to the Siamese. Likewise, he took no action when the Laotian states stopped paying tribute in 1778. The only campaigns were in Manipur, where the Burmese army was forced to put down four rebellions throughout his reign. The king is best remembered for the Maha Ganda Bell which he donated in 1779. Singu was overthrown on 6 February 1782 by his cousin Phaungka, and was executed by his uncle Bodawpaya eight days later. Early life Singu was born Min Ye Hla (), the eldest son to Prince of Myedu (later King Hsinbyushin) and his first wife at the Royal Palace in Ava on 10 May 1756. When his father became king, Min Ye Hla was granted the town of Singu in fief. He became known as Singusa or Lord of Singu by which he would be known. He was later installed as Heir Apparent, against the wish of the founder of the dynasty, Alaungpaya.Nisbet, p. 11 Accession controversy Singu ascended the throne amid controversy; as his accession ignored the wish of the dynasty founder King Alaungpaya that all his sons become king. Singu's accession was made possible by the support of his father-in-law Gen. Maha Thiha Thura, the commander-in-chief of the Burmese military. (Singu's second queen, Maha Mingala Dewi, was the general's daughter.) At his succession, he assumed the regnal name \\"Mahadhammayazadiyaza\\" (; ). At Hsinbyushin's death, Maha Thiha Thura led Burmese forces were bogged down in their latest campaign in Siam. Concerned about his own rule at home, Singu ordered a complete withdrawal of Burmese forces from Lan Na and Upper Menam valley. The withdrawal's long-term impact was that the Burmese would lose most of the old Lan Na Kingdom, which had been under Burmese suzerainty since 1558.Htin Aung, pp. 181‚Äì186 Reign Singu killed off potential rivals to the throne as soon as he came to power. He had three of his half-brothers executed in 1776,upon his ascension. He next executed his uncle Prince of Amyin, the rightful heir to the throne per Alaungpaya's wish, on 1 October 1777. He exiled other possible claimants‚Äîthe remaining three uncles, and two cousins. Prince of Badon (later King Bodawpaya) was next in line for the throne‚Äîhence Singu's next target‚Äîbut the astute prince conducted himself so as to be seen as harmless so that he escaped death. Prince of Badon was sent to Sagaing where he was kept under close supervision. Demobilization Unlike his predecessors, who were all military men, Singu was anti-war in sentiment. The country had been fighting constant wars since 1740, and manpower and resources had been severely depleted. Moreover, he did not trust army commanders who were \\"drunk with victory\\" and had become warlords in the regions. Singu witnessed how the commanders openly disobeyed his father's orders when the once-fiery king was on his deathbed (1774‚Äì1776). Reflecting the people's general wariness for war, Singu largely demobilized the armies. He even had a fallout with Maha Thiha Thura and dismissed the man who made him king. He relieved the old general of all his offices. He divorced Maha Thiha Thura's daughter in May 1777, and had her drowned in 1778.Harvey, pp. 261‚Äì263 By demobilizing, he essentially decided to give up Lan Na which had been under Burmese rule since Bayinnaung's time. Similarly, he took no action when the Laotian states of Vientiane and Luang Prabang, which had been Burmese vassals since 1765 stopped paying tribute in 1778.Tarling, p. 238 Nonetheless, his demobilization was greatly received by the war-torn country. The people had grown tired of constant conscriptions to fight in \\"ever-lasting wars\\" in remote regions they had never heard of. The only region in which Singu maintained military action was Manipur, where he inherited another war from his father. The former Manipuri king, whom the Burmese last drove out in 1770, made four attempts to oust the Burmese nominee between 1775 and 1782 from his base in Cachar. The Burmese drove him back each time but were unable to capture him. The army gained \\"barren victories\\" and lost 20,000 men partly by fever over the years. After Singu's dethronement in 1782, the Burmese withdrew from Manipur \\"perhaps because the country was now so thoroughly devastated that nothing more could be wrung out of it\\". Administration He spent much of his time at the capital and in the palace, surrounding himself with young people, as he was anti-war in temperament. There, he listened to music and poetry and spent his nights in drunken bouts in a hideout across the river. He executed or dismissed those courtiers who criticized his conduct. Dethronement and death On 6 February 1782, one of the exiled cousins, Prince of Phaungka, came back to Ava, deposed Singu and claimed himself to be king. Phaungka's reign was short. Their uncle Prince of Badon, organized a coup one week later, killed both Singu and Phaungka and became king‚Äîlater known as King Bodawpaya.

They are common in most wine regions around the world and are to be considered in the tradition of other harvest festivals. The Egyptian god Osiris was dedicated to wine, but the oldest historically documented wine festivals can be traced back to the Greek celebrations for their wine god Dionysos. The typical ingredients of a wine festival include wine drinking, grape pressing, regional foods, music and, in many areas, religious ritual. In culture Fields of grape vines The grape, and the extraction of its juice to produce wine, is more than a flavorsome food or drink.

Background He was grandson of Richard Clerke, gentleman, of Livermere One or other of the neighbouring villages of Great Livermere and Little Livermere (which is now abandoned). in Suffolk, and son of John Clerke of Wells, Somerset, by Anne, daughter and heiress of Henry Grantoft of Huntingdonshire. He was born about 1537 in Surrey. He received his education at Eton College, and was elected to King's College, Cambridge, being admitted scholar on 23 August 1554 and fellow on 24 August 1557. He proceeded B.A. in 1559, and commenced M.A. in 1562. He also studied at Paris, where he was admired for his oratory, and he was offered a salary of three hundred crowns if he would read a public lecture at Angers; but this he declined. About 1563 he was professor of rhetoric at Cambridge. When Queen Elizabeth visited the university in August 1564, he took a part in the philosophy act which was kept in her majesty's presence, and made an oration to her when she visited King's College. He was one of the proctors of the university for the academical year beginning in October 1564. Early career On the death of Roger Ascham he was recommended to succeed him as Latin secretary to the queen by Sir William Cecil, Robert Dudley, 1st Earl of Leicester, and Walter Haddon. The office, however, was granted by the Queen to John Wolley. About the same time he was accused of unsoundness in religion, but defended himself. In 1569 he was again elected proctor of the university. On this occasion he was publicly charged with unsoundness in religion and reproached for having been rejected at court. The Earl of Leicester, in a letter to the vice-chancellor and regents of the university, dated 11 May 1569, vindicated Clerke's reputation. To the parliament which assembled on 2 April 1571 he was returned as one of the members for the borough of Bramber in Sussex, and on the 19th of the month he took part in a debate on the bill against usury, his speech containing quotations from Aristotle, Plato, St. Augustine, and the psalmist. In that year he accompanied to Paris Lord Buckhurst, sent as ambassador to the French court to congratulate Charles IX on his marriage. He resided with his lordship for some time after his return to England, and he was also held in esteem by Edward de Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford, to whom he seems to have been tutor. It was in 1571 that Nicholas Sanders printed his book, De visibili Ecclesiae Monarchia. Lord Burghley and Archbishop Matthew Parker thought it ought to receive a substantial answer from a jurist, and Clerke was asked. Burghley desired some public testimony from the university respecting Clerke's conduct: the vice-chancellor and John Whitgift as Master of Trinity College, testified on 6 December 1572 to his good reputation for learning. While engaged in refuting Sanders, Clerke was accommodated with a room in the Arches by favour of Archbishop Parker, who himself assisted in preparing the reply, which was then scrutinised and corrected by Burghley before it was sent to the press, as Fidelis servi subdito infideli responsio.Fidelis servi subdito infideli responsio, una cum errorum et calumniarum examine quae continentur in septimo libro De visibili ecclesiae monarchia a Nicholao Sandero conscripto,' London, 1573. Sanders wrote a rejoinder with a related title: Responsio servi fidelis subdito infideli It was printed by John Day, and trouble was taken with the typography, but Day asked Parker for a quid pro quo in the shape of help with setting up a book shop. Ecclesiastical lawyer On 14 January 1573 Clerke became a member of the College of Advocates at Doctors' Commons, and on 3 May 1573 he was constituted dean of the arches. The queen commanded the archbishop to remove Clerke, claiming that he was too young to hold such a post. He successfully resisted the attempt to remove him, supported by the archbishop. In November 1573 he occurs in a commission from the archbishop to visit the church, city, and diocese of Canterbury. About the same time he was appointed a master in chancery. His name occurs in the high commission for causes ecclesiastical on 23 April 1576, and he became archdeacon of Wells about the beginning of 1582. Diplomat In December 1585 he and Henry Killigrew were sent to Flanders to co-operate with the Earl of Leicester, being appointed members of the council of state. On 10 March 1586 Clerke delivered an oration in Leicester's name, on his arrival in Amsterdam, and in October following he was despatched to England by Leicester on a special mission to the Queen. In 1587 he was again sent to the Low Countries, with his friends Lord Buckhurst and Sir John Norris, to allay the discontent which had been excited by the Earl of Leicester's proceedings in Holland, and to open the way for a peace with Spain. Retirement For some years his residence was at Mitcham in Surrey, and he was lord of the manor of Clapham there. He died on 12 March 1590, and was buried in the old church at Clapham. By his wife Eleanor (n√©e Haselrigge) he had a son, Sir Francis Clerke of Merton in Surrey. Works His works included a translation into Latin of The Book of the Courtier from the Italian original Il Cortegiano of Baldassare Castiglione (STC 4782). It first appeared in early 1572 as Balthasaris Castilionis Comitis De Curiali siue Aulico, prefaced with commendatory Latin epistles by Earl of Oxford, Thomas Sackville, Lord Buckhurst, and John Caius.; . It was subsequently edited by Samuel Drake, in 1713.Dictionary of National Biography, article on Drake.

He concentrated and focused his early legal career on the legal aspects of complex financial transactions for the law firm‚Äôs banking clients. He was later recruited by Drexel Burnham Lambert-Puerto Rico as a Vice President, later Senior Vice President, of their Corporate and Municipal Finance division. He was responsible for structuring and executing a variety of bond and note issues for the Government of Puerto Rico, its several dependencies, as well as for Drexel‚Äôs private clients. In 1989 Mr. Rodr√≠guez-Ema was recruited by Chase Manhattan Bank in Puerto Rico to manage the investment banking unit of its Chase Securities Puerto Rico subsidiary, thus becoming a member of Chase‚Äôs Management Committee in Puerto Rico. After the November 1992 election, the governor-elect of Puerto Rico asked him to join his fiscal and financial team as President of the Government Development Bank for Puerto Rico (GDB). The GDB (www.gdb-pur.com) is the bank and fiscal agent for the government of Puerto Rico. As such, it is chartered with the coordination, structure, execution and placement of every single financing, bond or note issue for all government agencies, government-owned corporations and its multiple dependencies, including all 78 municipalities throughout Puerto Rico. Solid and Effective Management, Leadership and Decision-Making Skills (1993-1998) As President of the GDB, Mr. Rodriguez-Ema managed a highly technical and sophisticated 400-employee institution through a 10-member executive committee of senior officers accountable to a Board of Directors that met monthly. He also presided over all the GDB‚Äôs subsidiaries (including a housing finance subsidiary and a tourism development subsidiary-Tourism Development Fund). He participated in several high-profile government Boards constantly creating and building consensus among private institutions and public stakeholders for important government-sponsored economic development policies. He was also Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Economic Development Bank for Puerto Rico (another government-owned financial institution) and Chairman of the government‚Äôs Privatization Committee. As head of the Privatization Committee he was in charge of the implementation of the government‚Äôs privatization policy, which entailed the disposition and sale of several major government-owned assets and dependencies, including, the Puerto Rico Telephone Company, the Puerto Rico Maritime Shipping Authority (Navieras) and several government-owned hotel properties, centers for diagnostic treatment and hospitals. During this time, he was responsible for the promotion, design and financing of the new Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico and the new sports facility Coliseo de Puerto Rico in San Juan, among many other major projects. He was the first Chairman of the Board of Trustees of the Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico. Private Sector Management (1999-2009) After leaving government in 1998, Mr. Rodr√≠guez-Ema joined the largest family-owned real estate development company in Puerto Rico as Director of New Business Development. Thus, he undertook the planning and execution of several major projects for the companies, including the purchase of real estate in the mainland for the planned expansion of certain family businesses. As part of the senior advisors to the Chairman he had daily meetings negotiating and building consensus among peers on the several management, operational and legal issues related to development projects, which included the construction, expansion, financing and marketing of shopping centers, office buildings and condominiums; also the purchase, design and development of raw land acquisitions, as well as dealing with the marketing and management of the second largest dairy company and processing operation in Puerto Rico. Challenging Times Require Skills and Leadership (2009-2012) In 2009, Mr. Rodr√≠guez-Ema was asked by the newly elected Governor Luis Fortu√±o to leave the private sector and come join his government as Chief of Staff. Puerto Rico‚Äôs dire economic situation and persistent recession required leaders with strong business and economic background, excellent management and organizational skills who were able to motivate, energize and drive the Governor‚Äôs cabinet in the implementation and quick execution of significant and complex fiscal, financial and social policies. As the Governor‚Äôs Chief of Staff, Mr. Rodr√≠guez-Ema was in charge of the immediate supervision of all government agencies (over 120 of them), the organization, drafting and execution of the voluminous and necessary legislation to deal with the economic crisis, the coordination of the state budget (over $28 Billion), as well as actively ushering and lobbying all budgetary and economic crisis legislation through the House and Senate. He was also the Governor‚Äôs main spokesperson on all relevant issues as well as liaison with the House Speaker and Senate President. The government downsizing and the major cuts in contracts and services in order to reduce a staggering $3 Billion deficit and avoid a bond-rating downgrade which could prove catastrophic for the economy were serious and momentous initiatives of historical proportions. In December 2012 Mr. Rodriguez-Ema formed his own strategic business consulting firm called Proventus, llc, providing clients with valuable insight and business and legal advise into the ever changing and challenging business cycles in Puerto Rico.

The name Vorw√§rts was used in East Germany by those clubs associated with the armed forces, paramilitary organizations, and police.  History  Now playing as Sportverein Vorw√§rts Cottbus, the former airforce side was part of the Bezirksliga Cottbus (IV) and the arrival of the Leipzig players contributed to a title win there and promotion to the 2.DDR-Liga (III). The team was renamed Armee-Sportklub Vorw√§rts Cottbus in 1957. They spent five seasons in third-tier play before advancing to the DDR-Liga (II) through a promotion playoff following a divisional title win in 1959. The Cottbus side missed promotion to first-division play when they finished second to Lok Stendal in 1963. In 1966, the club was again renamed, becoming Armee- Sportgemeinde Vorw√§rts Cottbus. They became a DDR-Liga fixture spending 14 seasons in second-tier play until slipping to the Bezirksliga after a 10th- place finish in 1974. Cottbus made its first appearance in play for the FDGB- Pokal (East German Cup) in 1962 and appeared in each subsequent cup tournament until 1974. However, the team was never able to make its way out of the early rounds. In 1975 the club was transferred to Kamenz, Saxony near Dresden where they would play for the next ten seasons as Armee-Sportgemeinschaft Vorw√§rts Kamenz until folding in 1985.

Tatar Internet Russian overview The first e-mail message in Tatar was probably sent and received in 1991 when employees of the Tatar-Bashkir Service of Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty started using the Internet and electronic communication on a regular basis. In 1994, a Tatar-language mailing list (TMG, standing for Tatar Mailing Group) was established and this year is commonly regarded as the birthyear of the Tatar Internet. Since approximately 2000, Tatnet has been developing explosively, with many web pages and web sites added to it annually. The existence of Tatnet continues to contribute tremendously to the cohesion and consolidation of the Tatar people, a significant achievement because Tatars are dispersed all over the world and a substantial majority of Tatars live outside their ethnic homeland, Tatarstan.

Ardgoil is an estate in Argyll & Bute, Scotland. It is part of the Argyll forest park and is within the Loch Lomond and the Trossachs National Park. The Ardgoil estate is managed as part of the Argyll forest park by Forestry Commission Scotland. The Ardgoil estate is publicly owned land with the land title held for the public by the ministers of the Scottish Parliament. In the past the Ardgoil estate was also known as the city of Glasgow's Highland estate. History Map of Ardgoil estate. The story of the Ardgoil estate begins in 1905 when another land estate in Argyll & Bute was put up for sale. In April 1905 the Ardkinglas estate was put up for sale. The estate was offered as one lot, but if not sold, it would be offered as two sections called the \\"Loch Fyne Section\\" and the \\"Loch Goil & Loch Long Section\\". There was no offer for the whole estate, and the Liberal Party politician Archibald Cameron Corbett arranged to purchase the \\"Loch Goil & Loch Long Section\\". Corbett was the Member of Parliament for Glasgow Tradeston at the time, and he made the purchase with the aim of giving it to the city of Glasgow. In July 1905, Corbett sent a letter to the Lord Provost of Glasgow at the time, Sir John Ure Primrose, informing him of the purchase. A copy of Corbett's letter is shown below.

Cameron Corbett The gift was accepted and for the moment the land was called the Ardkinglas property. The Corporation of Glasgow arranged an official inspection of the Ardkinglas property on Saturday 7 October 1905. The Ardkinglas property consisted of of mountain territory lying between Loch Long and Loch Goil. It is a triangular piece of land in length and around at its widest point. An area called Argyll's Bowling Green is part of the estate. Three farms were included in the gift and they are Beach, Coilessan and Lochgoilhead. In November 1905 Corbett contacted the Lord Provost stating that he wanted to add some more land to the gift. He proposed adding the farm of Pole near Lochgoilhead, which was in size. The additional gift was accepted and this brought the Ardkinglas property to in size. Mr Corbett said he did not want the name of the property to be in any way connected with him, so the Corporation of Glasgow decided to call the Ardkinglas property \\"Ardgoil\\". The land was legally transferred to the Corporation of Glasgow in June 1906. In December 1911, under the Private Legislation Procedure (Scotland) act 1899, the Corporation of Glasgow were given the power to allow them to appropriate estate land for afforestation, construct roads, bridges, piers and ferries for the utilisation and development of the estate. They were also given the power to sell, feu and lease the estate or portions of the estate. Private Legislation Procedure (Scotland) act 1899 (Clipping of Edinburgh Gazette 17 November 1911) Between 1928 and 1929, the Corporation of Glasgow made a feu agreement with the Forestry Commission for two sections of the Ardgoil estate to be used for afforestation purposes. These sections were to be called \\"Pole\\" and \\"Coilessan\\". The Pole section consisted of and the Coilessan section consisted of . In 1965 the Corporation of Glasgow made arrangements to transfer the Ardgoil estate into public ownership at an agreed price to the tax payer of ¬£156,450. It was to be managed by the Forestry Commission as part of the Argyll forest park. The Corporation of Glasgow included three main conditions/burdens on the sale of the Ardgoil Estate. These were: (One) The lands shall be used by the Forestry Commission for their functions under the Forestry Act 1967 and for no other purpose whatsoever unless with written consent from the Corporation of Glasgow. (Two) The feuars shall be obliged to comply with the conditions of the said Deed of Gift in so far as it is possible and practicable for them to do so to ensure that the basic objects attaching to the said Deed of Gift shall be observed. (Three) The lands will remain as part of Argyll Forest Park. In August 1967 the Ardgoil estate land title was transferred to the Secretary of State for Scotland and into public ownership. In 1999 all land titles (including the Ardgoil estate) held by the Secretary of State for Scotland were transferred to the ministers of the new Scottish Parliament. Since the Forestry Commission took over the management of the Ardgoil Estate, it has made 55 disposals of Ardgoil estate land amounting to . The most recent was in 2009 to Dunbritton Housing Association for the price of ¬£115,000. The total size of the Ardgoil Estate is .

Agnieszka Szurek, Kordian, gazeta.pl, 2008-07-01 It was published next year in Paris, anonymously, leading to speculation that it might have been written by the foremost Polish poet, Adam Mickiewicz. Still, it received little positive notice in the first years after its publication. It premiered in 1889 in Austrian-held Krak√≥w, at the theatre now named for S≈Çowacki. It had to wait until 1916 for its first performance in Russian-held Warsaw. Another notable production occurred in 1956 under Erwin Axer.theatre profiles: ERWIN AXER Other leading directors who have staged Kordian include Leon Schiller (in the 1930s) and Jerzy Grotowski (1962).Erika Fischer-Lichte, History of European drama and theatre, Routledge, 2002, , Google Print, p.333 The play has become a classic of Polish theatre repertory.Harold B. Segel, Polish romantic drama: three plays in English translation, Taylor & Francis, 1997, , Google Print, p.23 Though Kordian's title and some of S≈Çowacki's letters indicate that he had planned to write, and may actually have written drafts of, second and third parts, they were never published and, if written, were either destroyed or remain lost. Kordian has been required reading in Polish schools. In 1994 it aired on Polish TV Theatre. Plot After Kordian, a 15-year-old romantic, suffers rejection in love and survives a suicide attempt, he travels through Europe, learning the importance of money. He changes from an adolescent dreamer into a youth in quest of a purpose; in a moment of epiphany, the tragic lover transforms into an idealistic patriot. Inspired by Arnold von Winkelried, he resolves to devote his life to assassinating Russian Tsar Nicholas I (Russia having been one of Poland's three partitioners). Ultimately Kordian fails in his mission because of qualms over the ethics of assassination‚Äîbut possibly escapes with his life. This play has been translated into English for the first time by Gerard T. Kapolka. It was published by The Green Lantern Press in 2011. Analysis Kordian comprises three acts, written in rhymed Polish alexandrines. The play, inspired by the failure of the November 1830 Uprising, is a study of a Polish romantic revolutionary's psyche. Kordian ‚Äî his name was coined by S≈ÇowackiPresumably from \\"cor, cordis,\\" Latin for \\"heart.\\" ‚Äî is a typical romantic hero torn by his emotions. The play is also a polemic and a critique of romantic heroes in general, and in particular that of Mickiewicz's Dziady (Forefathers' Eve, 1823).Kathleen M. Cioffi, Alternative theatre in Poland, 1954-1989, Routledge, 1996, , Google Print, p.8 Kordian is often contrasted with the latter's hero, Konrad,Kimball King, Western Drama Through the Ages: A Student Reference Guide, Volume 1, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2007, , Google Print, p.216 as Kordian contemplates a dishonorable means to achieve victory (assassination) and fails in his task. S≈Çowacki intended to do more than merely show his disappointment with the failure of the November 1830 Uprising; he questioned whether Poland's fate was‚Äîas Mickiewicz suggested‚Äîin the hands of God, rather than being the plaything of Satan. S≈Çowacki employed old devices as well as new ones, previously not widely used in romantic dramas. He borrowed devices from Shakespeare (Kordian is often compared to Hamlet) but also emphasized fantastic elements as well as contemporary, real- world political events. Imitating Byron's ironical attitude, S≈Çowacki in the introduction to his poem treats the contemporary actors in the revolution rather flippantly. Kordian is considered a difficult piece to analyze and interpret. A common interpretation, seen by more recent scholars as unsatisfactory, is that of Kordian as a critique of romantic ideals. Cultural influences Kordian has inspired the short story \\"Gotyk\\" (Gothic) by Jacek Dukaj (published in Xavras Wy≈ºryn i inne fikcje narodowe, 2004), which is a science-fiction continuation of Kordian.

However, the case of intrauterine hematoma observed before 9 weeks of gestational age has been associated with an increased risk of miscarriage. In one study women who complied with instructions for bed rest for the duration of bleeding had a lower rate of miscarriage and a higher rate of term pregnancy than non- compliant women. The study had several limitations; results were severely confounded by inherent differences between compliant and non-compliant women. Ben-Haroush A, Yogev Y, Mashiach R, Meizner I.

The Council supervised the education of students at the Inns of Court, and initially established five professorships. Professors would lecture students at the Inns, who were required to attend a certain number of lectures to be called to the Bar. In 1872 membership of the Council was expanded to twenty and mandatory examinations for the call to the Bar were introduced. The creation of the Senate of the Inns of Court and the Bar in 1967 pushed the Council into being a subdivision of that Senate rather than an independent organisation, and representatives of the Bar Council were added to the CLE. In 1997 the Council ceased to exist, transferring its assets to the Inns of Court School of Law, its educational and training functions to the Inns of Court and Bar Educational Trust and its regulatory functions to the General Council of the Bar.

Norway (Communication No. 30/2003) was a case decided by the UN Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination in 2005. The case involved an antisemitic speech given during a march in commemoration of the Nazi leader Rudolf Hess. The Supreme Court of Norway acquitted the giver of the speech, and found that penalizing approval of Nazism would involve prohibiting Nazi organizations, which it considered would go too far and be incompatible with the right to freedom of speech. Afterwards the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination found that the acquittal by the Supreme Court of Norway was a violation of article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination. As such, the UN Committee found that the speaker's comments contained ideas of racial superiority and hatred, making the speech \\"exceptionally offensive\\" and not protected by the right to freedom of expression.  Background and case results  In 2000, a group known as the \\"Bootboys\\" organized a march in commemoration of Rudolf Hess, near Oslo. There was an antisemitic speech by the march's leader Terje Sj√∏lie, the Nazi salute was made and \\"Sieg Heil\\" shouted. Some witnesses filed a complaint with the police, and Sj√∏lie was charged with a violation of section 135a of the Norwegian Penal Code (threatening, insulting, or subjecting to hatred, persecution or contempt, any person or group of persons because of their creed, race, color or national or ethnic origin). Sj√∏lie was initially acquitted by the Halden City Court, then convicted by the Borgarting Court of Appeal. He was finally acquitted again by the Supreme Court in an 11-6 decision on 17 December 2002. The Supreme Court of Nowary found that penalizing approval of Nazism would involve prohibiting Nazi organizations, which it considered would go too far and be incompatible with the right to freedom of speech. The majority held that the speech contained derogatory and offensive remarks, but that no actual threats were made, nor any instructions to carry out any particular actions. CERD proceedings and opinion On 17 June 2003, representatives of the Jewish community and the Norwegian Antiracist Centre filed a communication before CERD. On 9 March 2005, the Committee declared the communication admissible. On 15 August 2005, it delivered the decision. The Committee reaffirmed that the prohibition of all ideas based upon racial superiority or hatred is compatible with the right to freedom of opinion and expression and concluded that the statements of Mr. Sjolie , given that they were of exceptionally/manifestly offensive character, are not protected by the due regard clause, and that accordingly his acquittal by the Supreme Court of Norway gave rise to a violation of article 4, and consequently article 6, of the Convention (Para 10.5). Significant conclusions include also that the deference to Hitler and his principles and 'footsteps' must in the Committee's view be taken as incitement at least to racial discrimination, if not to violence (Para 10.4). With the trial, the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination found that the statements in question \\"ideas based upon racial superiority or hatred,\\" and that \\"the deference to Hitler and his principles and 'footsteps' must ...be taken as incitement at least to racial discrimination, if not to violence. As such, the \\"exceptionally/manifestly offensive\\" statements were not protected by the due regard clause. It found as such, that the acquittal by the Supreme Court of Norway was a violation of article 4 of the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.  Adopted standard  The standard adopted for determining who qualifies as a 'victim' for the purposes of seeking relief was broad in the case, with the Human Rights Committee and the Committee for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination disagreeing as to the exact scope of the standard.

It educates about 800 students in age groups Preschool-12. History The Oakridge School is a coeducational, college preparatory day school. A non- profit institution governed by an elected Board of Regents, the school has been accredited by the Independent Schools Association of the Southwest (ISAS) since 1988. It holds membership in the National Association of Independent Schools (1987) and is recognized by the Texas Education Agency (1982). Oakridge formed when a group of parents, teachers, and administrators left the White Lake School of Fort Worth (K-3), which had been established in 1971 by Fort Worth businessman and city council member (1969‚Äì75) Ted Peters. The school community divided over proposed changes to the mission, specifically that students be tested for admissions and that students wear school uniforms. During the annual board of trustees meeting on February 27, 1979, parents expressed views on both sides of the issue, with board chair Nancy O'Shea and the school's new headmaster, the Episcopalian priest Father Peter C. Ensor, supporting progressive change. Controversy surrounding federally mandated busing added fuel to the fire. When the White Lake board replaced Nancy O'Shea with a new board chair and voted down proposed changes, O'Shea, Charles D. Butts, Jr., and other supporters drew up articles of incorporation for The Oakridge School within a week, as announced on March 6, 1979, at Woodhaven Country Club in east Fort Worth.O'Shea, 2019, pp.5-13 The Oakridge School opened at the Handley United Methodist Church, 2929 N. Forest Avenue, in east Fort Worth in August 1979 with 85 students and 15 faculty members under the leadership of headmaster Peter C. Ensor. Teaching assignments included one teacher per grade level (K4 thru grade 8), plus one teacher per subject for History, English, Science, Music, and Physical Education.O'Shea, 2019, p.34 In 1980, the Board's Permanent Site Committee of Bill Pruitt, Nancy O'Shea, and James Shadle negotiated the purchase of 33 acres on Pioneer Parkway from dairy farmer Bruce Boswell of Arlington, who offered flexible financing for four years because, as Boswell said, \\"You will either be successful or fail in four years.\\"O'Shea, 2019, p.39 In 1981, the Board of Regents named Andy J. Broadus its second headmaster. Broadus had served as associate headmaster at Jacksonville Country Day School in Jacksonville, Florida. Enrollment quickly grew to 154 students. The Texas Education Agency accredited Oakridge in 1982, the same year NAIS granted \\"new school status.\\" While the school gained academic traction, it sought a permanent home. Upper School classes were held at a house on Meadowbrook Drive in 1981-1982. For three years, from 1982 to 1985, Oakridge operated at the old Handley Middle School, which was razed in the early 1990s. Due to problems with the lease agreement with the Fort Worth Independent School District, and ongoing doubts as to the location of a permanent home, the Board of Regents purchased the 35 acres on the south side of Pioneer Parkway and started construction on the Early Childhood Center building in 1983. This, the first building on the Pioneer Parkway campus, was ready for students in the fall of 1984. The year 1985 was a major turning point in the history of The Oakridge School. Its first class of seniors (7 members of the first alumni class) graduated in 1985. One of these pioneer members of the Oakridge Alumni Association came from the United Kingdom (Wales), beginning a tradition of enrolling international students that continues. To date, Oakridge students have enrolled from 24 different countries. In the Fall of 1985, Oakridge opened the Upper School Building at 5900 Pioneer Parkway. With the 1986-87 school year, the school completed the move to the new campus with a new Lower School, Middle School, and Student Activity Center. In December 1987, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools (SACS) accredited Oakridge. That same month, the NAIS granted the school full and active membership. Several months later (March 1988), Independent Schools Association of the Southwest accreditation followed suit. Among all ISAS members schools, Oakridge led with the greatest enrollment increase for the 1988-89 school year. In September 1989, Oakridge started the Pre-school program for three-year-olds, making Oakridge the only ISAS school in the area with such a program. \\"It is never too soon to start laying a strong foundation,\\" remarked one parent. Headmaster Andy J. Broadus was named a Klingenstein Visiting Fellow at Columbia University's Teachers College in January 1992. By then, the school's debt had been reduced while plans were underway for expanding the Early Childhood Center (1993) and the construction of a new library and the Amon G. Carter Multipurpose Activity Center (1994). In September 1992 the National Merit Scholarship Corporation named Oakridge's first National Merit Scholar. Oakridge successfully completed its first ten- year accreditation visit in 1997 with outstanding reviews by visiting teams from ISAS and SACS. This was followed by the launch of a $6 million capital campaign for the construction of a fine arts center and information center. An extension to the Lower School was completed that summer (1998). The new Information Center opened in December 1999, followed by the John P. Flavin Fine Arts Center in May 2000. In 2006, the Boswell family‚Äîthe same family who sold 33 acres to Oakridge in 1980‚Äîannounced plans to sell 47.5 acres of property across the street on the north side of Pioneer Parkway. \\"We had always wanted the property,\\" Mr. Broadus said, but the parcel belonged to several family members and could not be sold. After a real estate agent pieced the land together, Mr. Broadus was pleasantly surprised to see a for-sale sign. \\"That had to be ours,\\" he said, especially in light of the fact that other Fort Worth sister schools had outgrown their space and had relocated to build new campuses. \\"That land meant [Oakridge] would never have to move.\\" The school acquired the additional land and set out to develop a master site plan for development into an athletic complex. By 2007, the \\"Securing the Legacy\\" campaign had exceeded the $6 million goal. That September, the new Security Center was completed, the most expensive square footage ever developed by the school, due to the high technology needs of a secure campus. Changes in leadership came in 2007 as well. Mr. Broadus, the longtime headmaster, stepped down from his role and assumed the title of president and chief fundraiser and developer for the Oakridge Athletic Complex. His associate headmaster, Jon Kellam, who had first come to Oakridge in 1993 and who had served as a soccer coach, English teacher, and Middle School head, stepped up to take over the management of the daily operations of the school. Mr. Kellam holds a master's from Texas Christian University, is an alumnus of Stanford University's Educational Leadership Institute, is a member of ISAS's Secondary Commission on Standards, and was selected as one of the 2014 Head of Schools fellows at the Klingenstein Center of Columbia University. , p.38 The 2011-12 school year saw various developments at Oakridge that impacted students across all divisions and in Academics, Arts, and Athletics. First, the new Quinn Family Kindergarten Center opened, creating four new K classrooms and almost doubling the Early Childhood Center to over 16,000 square feet. This state of the art facility was made possible by the philanthropy of William J. (Billy) and Stacey Quinn. , p. 18 The former Paradise Liquor store and gas station had been purchased and refitted for use as a 10,000 square foot Wrestling Center, with bathrooms and storage for the adjacent Duggan Track. In the realm of technology and public speaking, an Oakridge grandparent, Dr. Don Shelton, donated a short-range radio station: K-OWL AM 1670. After just a few months on the air, and streaming online, Oakridge Radio had listeners tuning in across 40 states and 13 countries., p. 16-17 The 2012-2013 school year featured another TEDx Youth Conference and two other developments: first, the Dubliners Colloquium for Upper School English students drew not only Oakridge students but those from eight other metroplex schools. Also, the Oakridge Athletic Complex opened the Tennis Complex with eight new, hard-surface courts. This allowed Tennis to be added to Middle School programs. Both the Track and Tennis courts are already serving the needs of many groups across the community, including the nearby Arlington Police Training Center. In 2018-2019 Oakridge broke ground on new baseball and softball fields at the Oakridge Athletic Complex and received recognition among several online review resources. For the third year in a row, ArlingtonToday.com readers ranked Oakridge the top private school in Arlington., p. 64 Among K-12 private schools across the nation, Niche ranked Oakridge in the top 13% nationally (296 of 2,213) and top 3.6% in DFW (14 of 382 private high schools). Oakridge continues to make such gains because, as one parent observed, Oakridge does not \\"mold\\" a certain type of student; instead, Oakridge encourages students to seek the best version of themselves. Academics The school includes students from age 3 to grade 12 in four divisions, each run by a division head. The Early Childhood Center includes pre-school, pre-Kindergarten, and Kindergarten. The Lower School includes elementary grades 1 thru 4. Middle School houses grades 5 thru 8, and Upper School incorporates the high school grades 9 thru 12. Each division head oversees the academic, arts, and athletic programs for the grade levels under their care. The school's philosophy is to admit students who are a \\"good fit\\" for its programs and who are bound for college. Parents and children are encouraged to attend admissions events and to tour campus. After the introductions are made, Oakridge staff begin to gather academic and social information on each prospective student. \\"We do admissions testing and request report cards.... We require current teacher and principal recommendations, which address not only academic progress, but also the student's ability to get along with his or her peers, teachers, and others.\\" The Student and Exchange Visitor Program (SEVP) has authorized Oakridge to host international students from such countries as Brazil, Britain, Canada, China, France, Germany, Hong Kong (pre-1997), India, Indonesia, Iran, Japan, Jordan, Kenya, Lithuania, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, the Philippines, Russia, South Korea, Spain, Taiwan, Thailand, Ukraine, and Vietnam. Each year, the school enrolls around 20 students from about a dozen countries. Each year about half the senior class leaves the Lone Star state for college to such schools as University of Southern California, Vassar College, Northwestern University, Harvard University, New York University, Boston University, University of Virginia, University of Alabama, California Institute of the Arts, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, American University, Washington & Lee University, Washington University in St. Louis, and the University of St. Andrew's. The Upper School offers 23 AP courses. Visual Art Since 1985, high school juniors and seniors have participated in the Twelve County High School Art Competition, referencing twelve counties of north Texas now sponsored by the University of North Texas Health Science Center at Fort Worth. The annual Fort Worth Stock Show art competition entails a broader range of grades (1-12) and includes both private and public schools.

The school falls under the jurisdiction of the Calgary Board of Education. The school houses unique programs that include the School of Performing and Visual Arts, and the National Sport Academy. History The school's name commemorates the original Central Collegiate Institute and Central High School first built in the early 20th century.Central Memorial High School. Calgary Board of Education. The school's history dates back as far as 1888, when the school opened its doors to 171 students (28 of which were high school students). The start of the 20th century Central High eventually became overcrowded, forcing the school board to move students to a new high school called City Hall School which was Calgary's first district high school. The name of the new school did not sit well with the students which preferred the name Central High. The school was nicknamed Sleepy Hollow High. The school was eventually renamed to James Short High. By the end of the decade James Short School could no longer accommodate Calgary's growing population, so the city's school board of governors approved a new site for a new high school named Calgary Collegiate Institute, located on the corner of 13th Avenue and 8th Street S.W. One hundred and one students attended the newly developed high school. The high schoolers were still discontent with the name, and continued the call their school Central High. By the 1920s, the name Calgary Collegiate Institute faded into history, and Central High was adopted. As the city grew in both population and physical size, the Board of Education decided to close Central High in 1965 and transfer its students to Western Canada High School, only a few blocks away. The new Central Memorial High School was opened three years later amid the growing southwest communities of Lakeview, Altadore, and North Glenmore. Before the closure of CFB Calgary in 1998, Central Memorial was also the designated public high school for dependents of military families living in private married quarters at the base. The school is part of the Action for Bright Children Society.http://www.abccalgary.com/schools.html  Performing Visual Arts  The school now houses a program formed in 2003 named The Centre for Performing and Visual Arts at Central Memorial High School. Students audition in their grade 9 year for entry into one of 8 disciplines; Theatre Arts, Band, Choral, Dance, Strings, Visual Arts, Media Design Arts, and Fashion Design Studies. From 2003 until 2009 there was also a Creative Writing program, which was cut due to low enrolment. Each student has at least 1 class with their discipline each day, with the prospect of more class time before and after school. Each specific program is taught by a team of skilled and talented teachers with high experience in their field of work. Since 2010, the graduating class of that year has the opportunity to participate in a trip to New York City in which they would take classes in their field of discipline with opportunities to explore others as well. The Music program not only goes on this trip, but also has its own trips it produces each year, with an international trip every 3 years with both the Instrumental and Vocal Programs, as well as a continental trip every other 2 years. The program's goal is to produce experienced artists and creative thinkers into the work place so as to carry on their trade or apply their experiences in the professional world. While being strict on their policy towards being in one discipline, there are occasions in which students, who make the academic and experiential standard, are allowed to be in 2 certain disciplines, such as both a performing and visual art. The program continues today to be one of the leading schools in Calgary and Alberta of the arts at a secondary level. Career and Technology Centre (CTC) The Career and Technology Centre (CTC) at Central Memorial High School provides students with access to rigorous academic and technical curriculum in preparation for further education and careers in high-skill, high-demand occupations. Working with experts, students access industry standard, high quality learning environments that extend into authentic work experience opportunities and lead to recognized post-secondary and industry credentials. Igniting student passions and interest at the CTC supports success both within and beyond their schooling experiences. Some examples of programs offered at the CTC include Auto Body, Computer Science, Cosmetology, Culinary Arts, Media Design & Communication, Energy & Environmental Innovation, Pre-Engineering, and Welding/Fabrication. http://schools.cbe.ab.ca/ct-centre/about.htm Athletics The Central Memorial Rams' athletic teams competes and participates in the Calgary Zone of the Alberta Schools Athletic Association. The school holds membership in the Calgary Senior High School Athletic Association. The Central Memorial Rams were also noted for their City Championship football playoff run where they went undefeated during the regular season and went on to win the City Championship title for the year of 2007. The National Sports Academy is also run through Central Memorial High, where renown coaches instruct young males and females in how to become great student athletes. The National Sports Academy includes sports such as Hockey, Baseball, Golf, and Lacrosse. http://www.calgaryhighschoolsports.com/ See also * Center West Campus ReferencesExternal links *Central Memorial High School *Calgary Board of Education *The Centre for Performing and Visual Arts at Central Memorial High School Category:High schools in Calgary Category:Educational institutions established in 1888 Category:1888 establishments in Canada ","title":"Central Memorial High School"},{"id":"24563749","text":"Peter Seidel Peter Seidel (December 2, 1926, Milwaukee, Wisconsin) is an American architect-planner turned writer.

When the Thracian captain stooped to look into the well, Timocleia pushed him into the well, and then hurled heavy stones into it until the captain died. She was then seized by the Thracian soldiers and brought before Alexander. She comported herself with great dignity and told him that her brother was Theagenes, the last commander of the Theban Sacred Band, who died \\"for the liberty of Greece\\" at the Battle of Chaeronea in 338 BC, defeated by Alexander's father Philip of Macedon. Alexander was so impressed with Timocleia that he ordered her and her children released and she was not punished for killing the Thracian captain. The story in the Mulierum virtutes is essentially the same, except that the captain is told that the treasure, of silver bowls, gold and some money, was at the bottom of a dry well, which he climbs down into. When Timoclea hears that he has reached the bottom, she throws down rocks on him. Alexander dismisses her without punishment but does not set her or her family free. He instead tells his officers to take special care of them and other renowned families, making sure there is no more abuse.Excerpt in Alexander the Great: A Reader, Ian Worthington, ed, pp. 70‚Äì71, Routledge, , 9781134435920; Example 24 in the Mulierum virtutes Timoclea before Alexander the Great, painting by Domenichino, c. 1615, Louvre. Plutarch's main source for the incident, as he mentions in passing elsewhere, was the account by Aristobulus of Cassandreia,Hammond, N. G.

The taking of Thebes took place in the second year of Alexander's reign, and was otherwise a very bloody affair, as the city was the leader in a Greek revolt, taking advantage of Philip's assassination, against the treaties he had enforced. Perhaps 6,000 Thebans died, and 30,000 were enslaved, and the city virtually ceased to exist for some decades. The only other act of clemency recorded is that Alexander ordered the house and descendants of the poet Pindar (died c. 443 BC) to be left alone.Martin, Thomas R., Blackwell, Christopher W., Alexander the Great: The Story of an Ancient Life, pp. 48‚Äì50, 2012, Cambridge University Press, , 9781139576536, google books In later art L√©on Davent, Etching, c.1541/45, after Francesco Primaticcio. 341 x 231 mm. Timoclea was a rare subject in art from the Renaissance onwards, never becoming a regular subject in the range of incidents showing classical and biblical female violence against men known as the Power of Women topos. But she featured in cycles on the Life of Alexander, and there was an increasing tendency in court art to depict Alexander as a proxy for the actual monarch, and to emphasize acts of generosity or mercy.Aghion I., Barbillon C., Lissarrague, F., Gods and Heroes of Classical Antiquity, Flammarion Iconographic Guides, pp. 30‚Äì31, 1996, Most depictions show her brought before Alexander, which might form part of a cycle illustrating his life.Hall, 12 This was the case in the cycle of frescos painted in the Palace of Fontainebleau in the 1540s by Francesco Primaticcio and his team. This was in the bedroom of Francois I's mistress, the Duchess of √âtampes (1508‚Äì1580), and a total of eleven compositions surviving today are known from surviving paintings or prints or drawings. The cycle showed the life of Alexander, but with little emphasis on his military career. This was one of the three subjects from the cycle etched as a print by L√©on Davent.Boorsch, Suzanne, in: Jacobson, Karen (ed), (often wrongly cat. as George Baselitz), The French Renaissance in Prints, pp. 256‚Äì257, 1994, Grunwald Center, UCLA, Unusually in this subject, but rather typically for the First School of Fontainebleau, Timoclea is naked when brought to Alexander. Here and in other depictions, the subject was given a composition similar to ones of the much more common The Continence of Scipio; the subject likewise emphasized the magnanimity of the commander. Timoclea sometimes accompanied the Continence in a series,\\"Giovanni Battista Gaulli, called Il Baciccio The Continence of Scipio, Sotheby's and is also capable of being confused with it.British Museum, Drawing Cat. 1860,0616.118, by Perino del Vaga Bernard de Montfaucon paired the two stories as his \\"Examples of the clemency and continence of conquerors\\" in a book of 1724.Supplement au livre de l'antiquit√© expliqu√©e et repr√©sent√©e en figures: tome quatri√®me: qui comprend la guerre, les ponts, les aqueducs, la navigation, les phares & les tours octogones, Chapter 4 As the Life of Alexander was a popular subject, the story of Timoclea probably would have been more a popular element if there had not been a grander and less sordid competitor in the form of The Family of Darius before Alexander, best known from Veronese's painting in London, which was normally included in cycles, and also showed Alexander being generous to women captives brought before him.Hall, 12 The most influential image of Timoclea's story, judging by copies in prints for two centuries after,British Museum search was the painting by Domenichino of c. 1615, which was in the French royal collection from the time of Louis XIV, and then the Louvre. Unlike most depictions, this shows her children prominently. A very different composition, showing only one and a half figures, with the Thracian disappearing upside down into the well, first appears in an engraving of 1629‚Äì30 by Matth√§us Merian, a book illustration for a popular German world history by Johann Ludwig Gottfried. This was later adapted in an oil painting by Elisabetta Sirani.Golahny, Amy, 1 \\"Elisabetta Sirani‚Äôs Timoclea and Visual Precedent\\", Source, 30, 2011, 37‚Äì42 PDF Later literature A play, now lost, called Timoclea at the Siege of Thebes was performed at Hampton Court Palace before Elizabeth I and the English court at Candlemas 1574, on February 2 (this was five years before the influential English translation of Plutarch by Thomas North was published). The author is unknown, and the performers were boys from the Merchant Taylor's School, London, directed by their master Richard Mulcaster.Lost Plays Database, University of Melbourne, \\"Timoclea at the Siege of Thebes\\", Anon. (1574) They were one of a number of companies of boy players active in English Renaissance theatre in London. The performance and its expenses was recorded in the accounts of the Master of the Revels, and from the number of children's gloves paid for may have included twenty four performers. It may not have been a great success, as the masque prepared to follow it, with ladies \\"with lightes being vj vertues\\" was \\"not showen for the Tediusnesse of the playe that nighte.\\" Timoclea also appears in Gynaikeion or Nine Books of Various History Concerning Women by Thomas Heywood, 1624, and as a minor character in John Lyly's play Campaspe, a comedy also performed by boy players. According to this, Timoclea and Campaspe were both captives at Alexander's conquest of Thebes, and are brought together before Alexander, where Timoclea's aristocratic dignity contrasts with Campaspe's self-description as \\"a humble handmaid to Alexander\\".\\"Campaspe\\" and \\"Sappho and Phao\\": John Lyly\\", The Revels Plays, eds.

Weisbach provided a concise account of his recollection of the sinking of the Lusitania which was published in The Irish Times in 1970 after his death. After the torpedo was fired, he was called to the periscope. He said the explosion which he saw was far more severe than could normally have been expected. He surmised then and still believed in 1966 (when being interviewed) that the liner must have been carrying a significant cargo of high-explosives.

The station is owned & operated by Bauer Radio and is part of The Breeze network of stations. It broadcasts from studios at Eastgate House in Andover. History Originally launched in May 2008 as Andover Sound by ITV regional news presenter Ian Axton (now of ITV West Country), who owned a majority 80% stake in the station with the remaining 20% owned by Tindle Radio. Andover Sound bought out Kick FM, a station serving Newbury & West Berkshire, in June 2009 - it was rebranded as Newbury Sound a month later. Both Andover and Newbury stations were sold to Celador in August 2011. On 12 March 2012, Celador announced Newbury Sound and Andover Sound would be rebranded as The Breeze, falling in line with an existing network of stations serving South Hampshire and the West of England (Bristol, Somerset and West Wiltshire). The rebrand took place on Monday 2 April 2012. In January 2012, the Newbury station was co-located to Andover Sound's studios. However, Breakfast and weekday drivetime programming is now presented from Basingstoke with networked output from Southampton broadcast during off-peak hours. Since September 2020 The Breeze in Andover and Newbury, along with other stations in the network, have been rebranded to become part of the Greatest Hits Radio network. Awards As Andover Sound, the station won various radio industry awards, including a New York Festivals News/Documentary Special accolade in July 2009 for Remembering Jamie, a half-hour programme on the sudden death of a local teenager. Andover Sound was also named as the Radio Academy South Station of the Year in December 2009.

Volunteer was a wooden- hulled motorboat built in 1906 at East Boothbay, Maine. The U.S. Navy inspected her during the summer of 1918 for possible World War I duty as a patrol vessel with the section patrol, and she was assigned the section patrol boat number SP-207. However, the Navy apparently never acquired her. The 1918 Naval Vessel Register listed Volunteer as a \\"water boat\\" and indicated that she was commissioned in the Navy on 23 August 1918. However, that information is probably erroneous for two reasons. First, the 1919 edition of the Naval Vessel Register indicated that she was \\"not taken over,\\" and she is not listed in the lists of vessels assigned to naval districts found in the 1918 and 1919 issues of the Navy Directory. Second, there was another USS Volunteer (ID-3242) during World War I, a collier which served in the Naval Overseas Transportation Service in 1918 and 1919 and was commissioned on 23 August 1918.

Its fundamental function is to raise the critical issue of Kashmir at national and international level. Its other key feature is its continuous progress in bringing all major political forces in one platform in order to pursue Kashmir cause. During the nineties, two Parliamentary Committees were established. The Kashmir Committee comprising 31 members, is one of the most important parliamentary bodies, and the slot of its chairman goes to a seasoned and respected politician. In the past, stalwarts like Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan, Chaudhry Muhammad Sarwar Khan and Ch. Hamid Nasir Chattha held this important position. Because of the importance of the issue, when the Parliament was not in position the former president Pervez Musharraf also formulated a National Kashmir Committee headed by the Kashmir veteran leader Sardar Abdul Qayyum. The first one, comprising 24 members (MNAs: 21 & Senators: 3) was headed by late Nawabzada Nasrullah Khan, MNA (December, 1993 ‚Äì November, 1996); whereas the second, with 26 members (MNAs) was led by late Chaudhry Muhammad Sarwar Khan, MNA (May, 1997 ‚Äì October, 1999). The third Parliamentary Kashmir Committee was established in June, 2004 with Ch. Hamid Nasir Chattha, MNA its chairman. The Committee comprised 49 members (MNAs: 36 & Senators: 13) and continued until November, 2007. Fourteen of its Members were Ministers also. Chairman of Kashmir Committee has been accorded status of Federal Minister in Pakistan. Current chairman of Kashmir Committee is Shehryar Khan Afridi.

He was also a political figure of some relevance at the time of the French Revolution and into the early years of the next century. Youth A son of the prosecutor, Jean-Pierre Bonneville, Nicolas de Bonneville was expelled from university during the first year of his philosophy studies after he created a scandal by refusing to support his contention that Jean-Jacques Rousseau was an atheist. Before taking up philosophy, he began, like his compatriot, , as a student of languages with an interest in philology. He was also a follower, though without sharing all of his ideas, of . As a young man, he produced German and English translations of the works of Jean le Rond d'Alembert, which financially supported him until his death. In particular, he was known for reproducing the essay on the origins of freemasonry by Thomas Paine, who became his close friend. Freemasonry Initiated into freemasonry in 1786 during a stay in England, he wrote two books on the subject, the \\"Jesuits Expelled from Masonry\\", and \\"Dagger Shattered by the Masons\\", both in 1788, in which he accuses the Jesuits of having introduced into the symbolic degrees of freemasonry, the myths of the Templars and their doctrine of revenge, based on the \\"crime\\" of their destruction, and the four vows of the Templars included in their higher degrees. Earlier, in 1787, the leading Bavarian illuminist and freemason, Johann Joachim Christoph Bode, is said to have converted the German-speaking Bonneville to a faith that combined esoteric symbolism with radical ideas of popular sovereignty bordering on direct democracy. Politics On the eve of the Convention of the Estates General, he began a passionate career in politics by publishing a newspaper, The Tribune of the People. Its proposals included the creation of a militia. During the Revolution, he was among the first to propose the storming of the Bastille. Once the prison had fallen, the first mayor of Paris, Jean Sylvain Bailly, praised his \\"zealous and courageous\\" though \\"imprudent\\" initiatives, and he commissioned him as a lieutenant colonel in the militia, with the task of overseeing the water supply of the city of Paris. Soon afterward, he became president of the District of the Carmes D√©chauss√©s, much to the fury of Jean- Paul Marat who had held that position. Society of the Friends of Truth On 13 October 1790, he founded, with Claude Fauchet, the Society of the Friends of Truth (also known as the Amis de la Verit√© or the Social Club), whose purpose was to rally the human race to \\"the doctrine of love, which is the religion of happiness.\\" The club became a forum for revolutionary and egalitarian ideas, attracting Sylvain Mar√©chal and Gracchus Babeuf into his circle. It was at the time unique for its focus on social, sexual and racial equality. The reports of the Social Club were published in the newspaper, Mouth of Iron. He also published newspapers called The Tribune of the People, The Chronicle of the Month, and The Well Informed. In addition to Fauchet, de Bonneville's collaborators included Louis-S√©bastien Mercier, Nicolas de Condorcet, Nicolas-Edme R√©tif, and Thomas Paine. Political and philosophical beliefs In a famous letter, Nicolas de Bonneville demanded freedom of the press, the abolition of Catholic worship, and the communal ownership of land. In 1791, he founded the \\"Republican Society\\", whose members included Nicolas de Condorcet and Manon Roland. He was also friend and disciple to the occultist, Louis-Claude de Saint-Martin. In his book \\"The Spirit of Religions\\", published in 1791, he sought to resolve the issue of social happiness by describing a universal religion which would have philosophers and scholars for priests. Following a disagreement with the Abbe Fauchet, he found himself alone at the Mouth of Iron. Nonetheless, the newspaper became one of the most sophisticated instruments of the Cordeliers Club, and it remained so until the cessation of its publication in the aftermath of the massacre on the Champ de Mars, 17 July 1791. Bonneville's attempts to be elected to the National Assembly and the Convention failed. Hostile to the wantonly bloody violence of the Revolution, his denunciation of the massacres of September 1792 in \\"The Chronicle of the Month\\", earned him the wrath of Marat, who denounced him as an aristocrat. Soon afterward, he was arrested, but he was not executed; instead, he was released after the fall of Maximilien Robespierre. Retrenchment Retiring for some time to √âvreux in 1800, Thomas Paine, who had lived with him and his wife since 1797, helped with the burden of translating the \\"Covenant Sea\\". The advent of Napoleon plunged him into trouble again when he hid the royalist, Antoine Joseph Barruel-Beauvert, at his home, and employed him as a proofreader. Beauvert had been proscribed following the coup of 18 Fructidor (4 September 1797). Bonneville's generous act, earning him a portrayal by Charles Nodier as \\"a frequent host of all the unfortunate of all parties\\", aroused the suspicions of authorities. He was later jailed for comparing Napoleon Bonaparte to Oliver Cromwell, in The Well Informed of 19 Brumaire Year VIII (November 1800), and, although he was freed quickly enough, he found his presses had been confiscated. Ruined, he took refuge with his father in √âvreux, and he remained under police surveillance. In 1802, Tom Paine left for the United States with Bonneville's wife, Marguerite Brazier (1767‚Äì1846), who was a disciple of Bonneville's associate, the radical feminist, Etta Palm d'Aelders, and Brazier's three sons, Benjamin, Louis, and Thomas, of whom Paine was godfather. They settled in New Rochelle, New York on Paine's farm. In his will, Paine left the bulk of his estate to Marguerite who had cared for him until he died in 1809. The inheritance included one hundred acres (40.5 ha) of his New Rochelle farm where they had been living, so she could maintain and educate her sons. The fall of Napoleon in 1814 finally allowed Bonneville to rejoin his wife in New Rochelle, where he remained for four years before returning to Paris. There, he earned a living by opening a bookshop in the Latin Quarter. During the latter years of his life, he fell into misery and madness, naturally taking a more pessimistic view on the possibilities for the happiness of mankind. His funeral expenses were paid for by Charles Nodier, Victor Hugo, and Alfred de Vigny. His son, Benjamin Bonneville, undertook a career in the U.S. Army in which he retired as a brigadier general; his life was immortalized by Washington Irving's \\"Adventures of Captain Bonneville\\". Bonneville played a crucial role in the advent of Romanticism. His own writings and inspirations make him an essential precursor of this literary movement. His translations from German of Goethe, Lessing, and Schiller also laid the groundwork for later French poets would wished to become familiar with the German stage.

Most were small publications (known as \\"minicomics\\"), which were included as bonuses with action figures. Standalone comic-book series were also published by DC, Marvel Comics, London Edition Magazines and Image Comics. Publication history=Original Mattel minicomics (1981‚Äì1983) The original action figures were packaged with minicomics, with stories about the characters. In the early comics He-Man is a wandering barbarian on Eternia, a world dealing with the aftermath of a war which devastated its civilizations and left behind fantastic machinery and weapons. The war opened a rift between dimensions, allowing the evil warlord Skeletor to travel to Eternia. Skeletor has set his sights on the ancient Castle Grayskull, a fortress of mystery and power; whoever controls Grayskull will become Master of the Universe. To prevent Skeletor from achieving his goal, He-Man has received special powers and weapons from the Sorceress and defends the castle from Skeletor. He-Man is supported by allies such as Man-At-Arms (the Eternian master of weapons) and Teela, the adopted daughter of Man-At-Arms. Skeletor finds one half of the Power Sword, the key to Castle Grayskull. He-Man received the other half from the Sorceress, and must prevent Skeletor from linking the two halves and gaining access to the castle. To distinguish these stories from the minicomics which were released as tie-ins with the TV series, fans called this first version of Eternia \\"mini-Eternia\\" and the words were combined into Mineternia in 2003 by the minicomics fansite Eternia Minor (now He-Man Tales). DC Comics inserts and limited comics series (1982) Debuting in DC Comics Presents issue #47 (dated July 1982), the series crossed over to the DC Universe in a story that was a team-up with Superman. The story continued in a Masters of the Universe insert preview titled \\"Fate is the Killer\\", which appeared in several DC Comics comic books dated November 1982. The following month, a Masters of the Universe limited series was published, written by Paul Kupperberg and pencilled by George Tuska, which lasted for three issues. International MOTU comic series (1983-1990) Original comic-book content was also created in Germany by Interpart/Condor Verlag for 18 issues, Ehapa Verlag for 21 issues (also appearing in their Micky Maus comics) and also by Mattel itself. Both the German and British comics were often translated to provide content for other countries (although some comic books from Ledafilms of Argentina and Editora Abril of Brazil, along with Italy's Pi√π and Magic Boy magazines provided some original material in their pages as well). Later Mattel minicomics (1985‚Äì1987) With the introduction of Hordak, the minicomics began to diverge from the He-Man and She-Ra animated series and Etheria became Hordak's base of operations. Years earlier, Hordak had been overthrown by his minion Skeletor and banished from Eternia. He returns, accompanied by the Evil Horde, to conquer the planet. Occasionally allying with Skeletor (but usually attempting to destroy him), Hordak is opposed by He-Man. In the mini-comic King of the Snakemen, Skeletor discovers a pool of energy buried in Snake Mountain which contains ancient emperor King Hiss. Hiss discloses that he had conquered a number of planets before invading Eternia. Large portions of the planet had fallen to the Snake Men before they were defeated by the Council of the Elders and banished to another dimension. Hiss now seeks to recover his fellow Snake Men and bring vengeance to Eternia. Details about Eternia's past are revealed in subsequent minicomics surrounding the Three Towers: Grayskull Tower, Viper Tower and Central Tower. The giant structure is raised from underground by Hiss and Skeletor and is the focus of adventures as He-Man tries to prevent all three villains from acquiring the towers' secrets. Hordak recognises the towers, and claims to have helped build Central Tower. The return of the Towers enhances the Sorceress' magic, and she helps King Randor in his search to discover what happened to his long-lost brother Keldor. Skeletor is determined to stop the search. Princess of Power minicomics (1984-1986) Included with the She- Ra dolls beginning in 1985, these differed from the cartoon series. She-Ra used the Crystal Castle as her home, and Catra (rather than Hordak) is the primary villain. Marvel Star Comics series (1986-1987) Marvel's Star Comics imprint published 13 issues in 1986. UK magazines (1986-1991) First published in the UK by London Editions Magazines, the fortnightly comic series lasted for 72 issues between 1986-1988, with an additional comic (Masters of the Universe Adventure) running for 28 issues between 1988-91. Storylines included the battle for control of Viper Tower, a team-up of the three villainous factions and the destruction and rebuilding of Eternos. The 'Secret Files of Scrollos' strip featured origin stories for many characters including Sy-Klone, Rio Blast and Modulok, and the series included the characters of Horde Prime and Scrollos. There was also a short-lived She-Ra comic title that lasted for 14 issues between 1986-87, with 3 specials including the 'Twins of Power' special featuring both He-Man and She-Ra. The later issues of both the fortnightly MOTU comic and the Adventure Magazine reprinted stories from the German MOTU comics published by Ehapa, translated into English. In September 1989 the latter comic was renamed 'He-Man Adventure' and was now based on the 'New Adventures' toy line, again reprinting stories from the German Ehapa comics until the comic was discontinued in 1991. Newspaper comic strip (1986-1991) A newspaper comic strip, He-Man and the Masters of the Universe, was produced from July 20, 1986 until 1991, written by James Shull and Chris Weber and distributed by McNaught Syndicate. While most American newspapers dropped the strip mid-run, it was translated and distributed around the world. Fifteen storylines were presented over the course of the run. The complete run (minus a small number of \\"lost strips\\") was published in 2017 by Dark Horse Comics as He-Man and the Masters of the Universe: The Newspaper Comic Strips. He-Man minicomics (1989) Four minicomics were included with the 1989 space-themed relaunch. The story was similar to the UK magazine version of He-Man's New Adventures, differing from the cartoon series. 2000s MVC and Image Comics series (2002-2005) From 2002-2005 Image Comics and MVCreations published several series of comics and one-shots that mirrored tales of the 2002 Mike Young Productions show; the comic series elaborated and added to the mythos by introducing characters that never made it in after the 39 episodes of the television series. The first issues were seen in the summer of 2002 in the form of special promotional/preview issues, with three mini-series continuing on after; 'The Shards of Darkness' in fall 2002, followed by 'Dark Reflections' and 'Rise of the Snake Men' in 2003. After delving into the back- stories of Skeletor's henchmen Beast-Man, Mer-Man, Trap-Jaw and Tri-Klops in a four issue 'Icons of Evil' series, a short-lived ongoing series, solely produced by MVC, continued on for eight issues in 2004. Along with these, a handful of special or 'pack-in' one-shots and trade paperback collected volumes were also produced. Dark Horse / DC minicomics (2011-2015) Dark Horse Comics produced the first three minicomics for inclusion in Mattel's Masters of the Universe Classics toy line, continuing the series of minicomics introduced in the 1980s Masters toys. The minicomics were written by Tim Seeley and drawn by Wellinton Alves, with covers by Eric Powell. According to Seeley, these minicomics would conclude the story originally planned to be the new direction of the 1980's action-figure line before it was cancelled. The story dealt with the Powers of Grayskull line, which included King Hiss and He-Ro, tying the toy continuity to the He-Man line and known as The New Adventures of He-Man. Seeley said that this comic line was intended to blend the He-Man continuities and select the best stories and ideas from MOTU history. DC took over the Masters of the Universe Classics minicomics in 2012, with artwork by Wellinton Alves and Axel Gimenez. Five more minicomics were published to be included with the MOTU Classics line action-figures; the first told the origin story of Keldor (Skeletor), the second dealt with He-Man and Skeletor's final battle after their intergalactic New Adventures. The third begins ushering in the Son of He-Man era (introduced as a new series concept by Lou Scheimer in the 1990s, but never produced); which then continues for two more issues, culminating in the Third Ultimate Battleground. DC Comics (2012) A Masters of the Universe comic book series was relaunched by DC Comics in June 2012, first appearing as a series of digital comics. This was quickly followed by a six issue mini-series and all new revised origin issues for He-Man, Skeletor and Hordak. After a crossover mini-series with superheroes from the DC Comics universe in 2013, an ongoing series ran for 19 issues through 2014, before being replaced by the 'He-Man The Eternity War' 15 issue series in 2015/2016. This introduced a new back-story for He-man's sister She-ra (as Despara), Skeletor (as the half-Garn son of King Miro), Hordak, and the Snakemen; moving the storyline further along, with a new Horde invasion of Eternia and He-Man taking the Eternian throne, amongst other new developments. He-Man/ThunderCats, a crossover with another heroic 1980's action figure line, ThunderCats, was also produced for 6 issues in 2016-2017. The current DC Masters of the Universe property is a 6-part crossover series with DC Comics' Injustice Storyline.

She was awarded the Bronze Star for her \\"heroic and meritorious\\" service in aiding agents of the American Office of Strategic Services (OSS) and British intelligence escape Nazi-occupied territory during the winter of 1944-1945. Biography Gulovich was born in Litmanov√°, Slovakia, in Star√° ƒΩubov≈àa in 1921. She was the blue-eyed daughter of Edmund Gulovich who was a Greek Catholic village priest and Anastasia who was an elementary school teacher. She attended the Greek Catholic Institute for Teachers in Pre≈°ov. She became a school teacher in Jarabina in 1940 and later in Hri≈àov√°. After Slovakia was occupied by Germany in 1939, Gulovich continued to teach. In early 1944, a Jewish friend asked Gulovich to hide his sister and her five-year-old son. She later recalled, \\"I never intended to hide anyone. My sister brought the woman's brother and he was crying and I'm a softie. And he said, 'Would you hide her just for a few days until she finds something else?' She never did. I was stuck with them.\\" From April through June 1944, Gulovich hid the woman and her son in the Hri≈àov√° schoolhouse where she taught, allowing them to stay in the living quarters while she slept in the classroom. Her concealment of the Jews was reported to the Slovak authorities, and a Slovak Army captain was sent to question Gulovich about her actions. Fortunately for Gulovich, the Slovak officer sent to investigate was part of the anti-fascist resistance. Gulovich later recalled, \\"Lucky for me. Otherwise we wouldn't be here.\\" The Slovak officer offered to find a new hiding place for the woman and her son if Gulovich would become a courier for the resistance. Gulovich reluctantly agreed and moved to Bansk√° Bystrica, where she was employed as a dressmaker for an underground sympathizer. Her first mission required her to smuggle a short-wave radio in a suitcase on a train. She had a close call when the Gestapo stopped the train and began methodically checking all the passengers' luggage. In a 1989 interview, she recalled the incident as follows: > There was a bunch of Wehrmacht officers sitting in a compartment and one > started flirting with me -- which I gladly returned. They said, 'Fraulein' > -- I spoke German at the time -- 'would you sit with us?' They made a seat > for me in the compartment and the officer carried my suitcase into the > compartment with him. The Gestapo came by, saluted, and went on.\\" Because of her fluency in five languages (including Russian, Hungarian, Slovak) as well as speaking a little English, Gulovich was assigned to work as a translator for the resistance. When the Slovak National Uprising began at end of August 1944, she worked in the rebel headquarters translating documents from Slovak into Russian for Soviet military intelligence. During the summer of 1944, Gulovich was introduced to American OSS agents who had been sent to assist the Slovak uprising and rescue downed American airmen. In October 1944, the Germans crushed the uprising, and Gulovich fled to the mountains where Soviets, Americans and several thousand rebel troops evaded the German Army. The OSS mission in Slovakia was led by a South Carolina cotton magnate, Holt Green, and included a dozen OSS agents, 18 airmen, and an Associated Press correspondent Joe Morton. The Americans asked Gulovich to join them as their translator and guide as they sought to escape from German-occupied territory. Gulovich agreed and helped the Americans obtain provisions, shelter and intelligence as they moved through the Slovak countryside. Gulovich later recounted how she would concoct a cover story on entering a new village: \\"I would say I was looking for my brother or we had had to evacuate ... And depending on the answers, I would know whether to keep talking or say, 'thank you,' and move on. Ironically if someone was a communist, I knew I could trust them.\\" On several occasions, Gulovich had confrontations with German soldiers, and one of the OSS agents later recalled that \\"she got by through wit and guile\\" and her ability to speak German. As the Americans sought to evade capture, an elite German intelligence unit was sent to the area to track them down. According to one historic account, \\"SS units prowled the countryside, executing whole villages of suspected partisan sympathizers and families sheltering Jews while looking for the Allied mission.\\" As the winter arrived, Gulovich and the Americans were caught in a blizzard on Mt. ƒéumbier, the highest mountain in the Low Tatra range in central Slovakia. She later recalled that \\"the wind blew so hard that it turned people over. Our eyebrows and hair changed into bunches of icicles.\\" They kept moving forward, passing 83 partisans who had been frozen stiff on the mountain. In late December 1944, Gulovich and the Americans stayed at a hunting lodge for two weeks. The group had planned to leave the lodge on Christmas Day, but stayed an extra day waiting for an overdue airdrop of provisions. On December 26, 1944, Gulovich and four others from the group (two American and two British) left the lodge seeking food and medical supplies. While they were gone, the Germans raided the hunting lodge. The Americans were captured and later executed. Gulovich and the four others who were away from the lodge avoided capture. It took the five of them nine more weeks to get to the Eastern front lines. She recalled that they never felt safe for a minute. To avoid capture, they often moved each night to new locations, including a mine and a barn, and suffered through lice and frostbite. Gulovich's foot became seriously frostbitten, but she declined to seek medical attention. She later explained her rationale for avoiding hospitals: \\"It never occurred to me to go, because I knew I would never come out. The Germans had my number. I thought, better to die on my feet than in a concentration camp.\\" Gulovich arrived in Bucharest on March 1, 1945, and was flown to OSS headquarters in Italy. She was put \\"on Army status\\" so that she could be paid for her service. She was later assigned to Prague as an interpreter, where she met Allen Dulles, an OSS officer who later became the director of the Central Intelligence Agency. To reward her for her service, Dulles and OSS chief William Donovan arranged for Gulovich to immigrate to the United States with a scholarship to Vassar College. She recalled that she felt out of place at Vassar and was astonished by the waste of food she saw there: \\"My first night there, I broke down and cried when I saw the food they were throwing out. I saw in my mind the millions of hungry, starving people -- my family included.\\" In 1946, Donovan personally awarded Gulovich with the Bronze Star at a ceremony held at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point, New York. In September 1946, the Los Angeles Times published an article about Gulovich's work with the OSS. The Times wrote: \\"Vivacious Maria Gulovich, 25, Czechoslovakian schoolteacher who arrived here yesterday, is the essence of what fictionalized women spies should look like.\\" Gulovich became an American citizen in 1952 and moved to Oxnard, California and worked for many years as a real estate agent in Ventura County, California. She was married twice and had two children, Edmund E. Peck and Lynn S. Peck, with her first husband, attorney Eugene C. Peck. She later married Hans P. Liu. She had one granddaughter, Elisabeth Maria Peck. In 1989, Gulovich and other women who had served the OSS were honored with a black-tie dinner for \\"The Ladies of the OSS\\" in Washington, D.C.. Gulovich was interviewed by a reporter for The Washington Post at the time of the event and was the subject of a feature that drew attention to her story.

Studio albums = The Best Collection I  The Best Collection I is Hurd's debut album. Recorded between the years of 1993-1995, and released along with The Best Collection II, it is considered to be one of the first heavy metal albums in Mongolian music history. It contains such hit songs as Chimeeg√ºi irekh durlal, Saikhan b√ºsg√ºi and Eejdee, which are hugely popular among Mongolian music lovers, and are frequently included in the live set. 5 songs from The Best Collection I were re-arranged and played acoustically during the 1998 Unplugged concert. Hurd released their first music video for Chono, where the band is seen playing the song near an abandoned factory. It also contains numerous battle scenes from a 1945 movie about Tsogt Taij. It is told that the band members grew quickly tired and behaved impatiently during the filming, as they were not yet familiar with the process. Mongolian traditional music instruments were used for the recording of Bakharkhal, most notably the Morin khuur. This song is among the first in a long list of patriotic songs written by Hurd. Track listing Additional personnel * S.Ishkh√º√º - keyboards * Kh.Bayarbold - technician * A.Bayarmagnai - technician \\\\----  The Best Collection II  The Best Collection II is Hurd's second studio album. It was recorded and released in conjunction with The Best Collection I, and as a result the two albums are sometimes seen together as a double album. Compared to its counterpart, the style and lyrical theme of The Best Collection II is somewhat darker (dealing with night, darkness, fear, cemetery, ...), and the songs are rather fast paced, with Khar darsan z√º√ºd being one of the fastest songs in Hurd's repertoire. The hugely successful Tsergiin bodol (\\"Soldier's Thoughts\\") is considered a classic and allowed the band to reach celebrity. The song was written by Dambyn Ganbold in 1978, while he was in military service, his fellow soldiers helping him up on the lyrics. It is told that, during a performance in an all-star concert, Hurd had a 3 song setlist that included Tsergiin bodol, but under popular demand they ended up playing the song three times in a row. Other famous songs from the album include Baga nas, Zurag shig b√ºsg√ºi and Nulimsaa tevch'ye. Hurd's 1998 Unplugged acoustic concert includes no less than 8 songs from The Best Collection II.

It is the only album where the band has changed its name to \\"Erel-Hurd\\", the album being the beginning of their 8-year partnership with Erel company. The name \\"Erel-Hurd\\" also appears on the compilation cassette Shildeg duu from that same era. Tanygaa dursana was written by D.Ganbold, who also authored the hugely successful Tsergiin bodol from The Best Collection II. The track contains some early recording of D.Ganbold singing Tsergiin bodol. S√ºns zalrakhui was not listed on the original release of the album, leading fans to give it the title √ñn√∂ ertnii uyees (”®–Ω”© —ç—Ä—Ç–Ω–∏–π “Ø–µ—ç—Å) before the release of the Black Box boxset in 2013, where the official name of the song was finally revealed.

Track listing \\\\----  Myangan Jild Gants  Myangan Jild Gants (, \\"once in a thousand years\\") is Hurd's fourth studio album. In this album, besides their usual rock ballads and heavy metal songs, Hurd has made their first attempts of writing nu metal material. That can be attested by such songs as √úg sons or Gar utas, as some of the singing is rapped and there is some use of turntables. Khelekh n' khegj√º√ºn is the fastest and also the shortest song in all of Hurd's catalog. Shine jil is an outtake from the Best Collection sessions and previously appeared on The Best Collection 3.

According to the band's comments in the Enhanced CD section, they wanted to make a softer sounding album and try out different rock music genres. For the first time, Hurd has written songs in rock and roll style. Also notable is the collaboration with hip-hop artists Ice Top, Digital and 2 Kh√º√º on Sain muu. Nutag min' √ºnertdeg features two famious mongolian wrestling champions G.√ñs√∂khbayar and D.M√∂nkh-Erdene. The band also comments that Mongold T√∂rs√∂n was specially dedicated to all the mongolians living abroad. Indeed, the overarching theme of the album is family, homeland, and national pride. In 2004, Hurd's tour supporting Mongold T√∂rs√∂n in Inner Mongolia was cancelled, as reportedly the Chinese authorities feared civil unrest.

At least one (semi-)official silver CD pressing was done in Inner Mongolia, although it is very rare and the only copy located does not have any identifying marks on it. The album was finally given an official release in 2013 in the Black Box boxset. The songs Nogoon shug√ºi and Chamaig zorino date back to at least 1998, being recorded at the concert at Top Ten nightclub in Ulaanbaatar that was immortalised on the 1999 album Unplugged.

ISSN 1368-485X Development The Drifter was first marketed by Maxair in the 1980s as both a single seat and two seats-in-tandem kitplane. The original single seater was light enough when fitted with the Rotax 277 engine to qualify for the US FAR 103 Ultralight Vehicles category, with an empty weight of . After Maxair went out of business, the design was picked up in 1997 by Lockwood Aircraft who produced kits for a number of single and two-seat versions, mostly differing by installed engine. The Lockwood versions are all wire-braced using a kingpost to support the ground wires. Over 1000 wire-braced Drifters have been completed and flown. Lockwood estimates that a builder will take 300 hours to complete a Super Drifter from the currently supplied kit. Australian developments From the 1983, Austflight ULA originally based at Ballina, New South Wales began licence production of the Drifter. In 1986, the company moved to purpose built facilities at Boonah, Queensland where they built fully assembled Drifter variants certified by Civil Aviation Safety Authority for the Australian market with powerplants including Rotax 503 to Rotax 582 and Rotax 912 engines. Further improvements led to the Strut Braced (SB) version built to CAO 101.55 class certification in December 1993. The Drifter SB was sold in the US in the 1990s by Tiger Aviation of Trenton, South Carolina. Over 500 strut braced Drifters were completed and flown. In late 1995 a joint venture called the Shanghai Fenton Light Aircraft Company (SFLAC) was established with the Shanghai Aircraft Manufacturing Factory for the manufacture of Australian versions in China. Austflight suffered financial losses due to the costs associated with certification and the joint venture agreement. In May 2002 Austflight sold the last of its assets and transferred the Drifter Type Certificate to Noosa Air Pty Ltd. Drifter Aircraft Pty Ltd of Dalby, Queensland was incorporated in 2006 to manufacture and market the Drifter and on the 1st of June 2006 was issued with a production certificate by CASA. Design Avid Aviation's Austflight A503 being used for flying training at Dalby, Queensland, Australia. All models of the Drifter are built around an aluminum tube keel, with aluminum tubing making up the keel-to-wing structure. There is no enclosed fuselage; the seats are open to the air. The conventional landing gear includes a steerable tailwheel. Most Drifter kits were delivered with a small fibreglass nose fairing. The wing is built from aluminum tubing and covered with pre-sewn Dacron sailcloth envelopes. Controls are conventional three-axis, with dual controls and center-mounted control sticks. Lockwood offers optional flaps as part of its STOL kit. The single seat Drifter and XP503 are both stressed for +6/-3g. With its large wing area the Drifter adapted well to floats and was fitted with several types, including Full Lotus floats. The glide ratio is 9:1. Operational history Drifters have been widely used in a number of roles, including recreational flying, agricultural spraying, aerial photography, flight training and banner towing, during which many Drifters have accumulated high numbers of flying hours, leading one reviewer to note: \\"its long track record has revealed no weakness in the Drifter\\". A number of Lockwood XP503s have been reported to have exceeded 3000 hours and one Drifter used for banner towing exceeded 10,000 flight hours. In reviewing the Drifter, Andre Cliche said: Bayerl et al. describe the aircraft as \\"light in weight, but aerodynamically handicapped\\", due to its high-drag cable bracing.

Christine's Robertson ancestry was large in the history of Texas, her grandfather being Elijah Sterling Clack Robertson, the founder of Salado College, and the family homestead in Salado still stands in 2018 as a historic site. Her grandfather, Sterling Robertson was a signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence and founder of The Robertson Colony of Texas, which stretched 100 miles in diameter. Her father, Huling, built most of Temple, and was instrumental in getting the M,K, and T Railroad to run through town. (Missouri, Kansas, and Texas.) He was a state senator for many years. Her mother, Mary (Mamie) founded the Betty Martin chapter of the Daughters of the American Revolution (DAR) in Temple, which is still in operation in 2018. By 1926, Percy, who used his middle name (Pamorrow) in business, had relocated to Orlando, Florida, where Turner's office was located at 19 Court Street.Orlando City Directory, 1926 In Orlando, Turner specialized in residential architecture.

Christine and Suzanne accompanied him to Camaguey and lived there until returning to Miami. Turner then joined the U.S. Army Engineer Corps, and was sent to Port of Prince, Haiti, for a while, then reassigned to Trinidad. In 1944 he was further reassigned to Hanford, Washington, where he worked on the atomic bomb in secret. He left the service at the end of the war and returned to Miami. Christine had become ill with a brain tumor and died in 1946, leaving him to raise their daughter, Suzanne, alone.

It is located in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Jefferson City. The school is named after Missouri native Augustus Tolton, the first self-identified black Catholic priest in the United States. The school's enrollment for the 2017-18 school year was 285 students.  History  Talk of opening a Catholic high school in Columbia had become a serious conversation by the time Bishop John R. Gaydos arrived in the Diocese Jefferson City in 1997. In a 2001 statement of his vision for the local Church, he called for ‚Äúa study of how to expand the possibilities for Catholic secondary education in the diocese.‚Äù Feasibility studies indicated strong support among Catholic parishioners in Columbia and surrounding communities for opening a Catholic high school. Local parishioners wanted the new high school to be built on a foundation of Catholic spirituality, college-prep academics, and leadership-development opportunities for students. They helped their parishes pay down construction debts, which allowed fund-raising for the new school to begin in earnest. The Diocese of Jefferson City provided $1.5 million in seed money through the ‚ÄúGrateful Memories ‚Ä¶ Faithful Future‚Äù capital campaign in 2006 and Bishop John Gaydos authorized the purchase of 23 acres of real estate. A fund drive to raise an additional $5 million in pledges in 2009 allowed the executive committee to secure financing for the rest of the school's cost. Bishop Gaydos authorized initial site work and excavation for the school to begin in April of that year. The first classes started in August 2011 and the building opened in November 2011. Additional funds are being raised with the hope of keeping tuition affordable for as many children as possible.

Appointment and style of command In the summer of 1915, General Sir David Henderson decided that, despite his personal preferences, a general officer with technical knowledge and recent war experience was required at the War Office to argue for the resources needed by the RFC. Being the only suitable candidate, Henderson arranged for his return to Great Britain and recommended that he be succeeded by Trenchard. Kitchener immediately approved the recommendationBoyle 1962:pp. 140-141 and on 25 August 1915, Trenchard was promoted to brigadier-general and appointed Officer Commanding the RFC in the Field.Wykeham 1971:p. 470 As the Flying Corps' field commander, Trenchard was far more personally involved in the detail of his wing commanders' and squadrons commanders' tasks than Henderson had been. Trenchard instigated tighter controls on the Flying Corps' tactical training programme, dealt with the unending challenge of providing for material shortages and required his airmen to adopt a more aggressive posture. During this time Trenchard was greatly helped by his aide-de-camp, Maurice Baring.Boyle 1962:pp. 142-147 The Battle of Loos, the Fokker Scourge and the Battle of Verdun In late September 1915, Trenchard oversaw the Flying Corps' contribution to the Battle of Loos. The improved artillery cooperation and air-to-ground wireless communications yielded good results for the British. Additionally, the Battle was significant as the first successful tactical bombing operation in the history of military aviation that was carried out by the Flying Corps. Despite this, the battle was inconclusive and Trenchard had hoped that his airmen might have achieved more.Boyle 1962:pp. 148-150 By the autumn of 1915, the Flying Corps had to contend with a new difficulty, the so- called \\"Fokker Scourge\\". The recently introduced Fokkers, with their synchronization gears which permitted a machine gun to fire through the arc of the propeller without striking its blades, outperformed the British aircraft. Trenchard struggled to maintain air superiority and the Flying Corps' losses slowly but surely exceeded the replacements, thanks in no small part to Trenchard's insistence on offensive operations and the greater tactical flexibility of the Germans.Johnson, History of Air Fighting. With the land campaign going through a period of limited activity, Trenchard scaled back the air support to land operations. Although the technological edge remained with the Germans, several modifications were made to Trenchard's aircraft such as the introduction of Lewis guns in the BE biplanesBoyle 1962:pp. 152-156 and by early 1916 the Flying Corps had received new fighter aircraft types and began to respond to Fokker attacks on more even terms.Boyle 1962:p. 163 In December 1915, Haig replaced Sir John French as Commander of the British Expeditionary Force and the Haig-Trenchard partnership resumed, this time at a higher level.Lyall 1976:p. 179 During the early stages of the Battle of Verdun in 1916, Trenchard supplied Lewis guns, bullets and bombsights to the French Air Service which was under the command of Paul-Fernaud du Peuty. Later in the battle, de Peuty switched from a defensive to an offensive air posture, at least in part due to the influence of Trenchard.Boyle 1962:pp. 168-171 In March, with the Flying Corps expanding, Trenchard was promoted to major- general.Probert 1991:p. 100 The Battle of the Somme, Bloody April and the Battle of Arras In the days before the Battle of the Somme, Trenchard ordered that reconnaissance sorties be flown and German observation kite balloons be targeted. On the eve of battle, Trenchard had mustered 105 aircraft to the rear of the Fourth Army and with the commencement of the battle, Trenchard brought his squadrons systematically into action. Low-level bombing was a major task for the participating aircraft and many were shot down. Despite the losses, by mid-August the Flying Corps had succeeded in gaining air supremacy in the skies over the Somme. However, by September 1916 the prospects of a German collapse were remote and Trenchard feared that the Flying Corps in its weakened state was vulnerable to a German recovery in the air. Trenchard appealed to the War Office and even to the Admiralty for replacements in number but these were not initially forthcoming. By mid- September the German Air Service had regained some strength and Flying Corps began to take casualties in greater numbers. The Flying Corps' decline in numbers impaired their ability to provide accurate artillery support and although in late October a naval squadron was provided from Dunkirk, the British remained weak in the air.Boyle 1962:pp. 181-198 After the conclusion of the Battle of the Somme, Trenchard's Flying Corps remained in a weakened state and all along the Front, Trenchard's aircraft were still fighting those of the German Air Service. In November 1916, Haig, on Trenchard's urging, sought a further 20 squadrons of fighters and in December, Trenchard travelled to London to appeal in person for additional fighters. With his words failing to produce the desired aircraft, Trenchard repeatedly wrote to Henderson and Brancker and when Trenchard went over Henderson's head to the President of the Air Board Lord Cowdray, Henderson severely reprimanded him.Boyle 1962:pp. 205-210 Trenchard at the Flying Corps' general headquarters, May 1917, by William Orpen While the winter weather gave some respite from the struggle in the air, the appearance of better weather in March 1917 brought a fresh offensive from the German Air Service. Trenchard was forced to cut back his offensive activity to a minimum although he continued to provide support to the British infantry as they slowly advanced to the Hindenburg Line. In April the Flying Corps supported the infantry as best it could during the Battle of Arras and engaged the Germans in a fierce air battle, known as Bloody April, in the skies overhead.Boyle 1962:pp. 212-126 Overall, from March to May, Trenchard lost 1270 aircraft and coupled with the production crisis in Great Britain this almost resulted in the destruction of the Flying Corps.Boyle 1962:p. 220 By mid-1917 William Weir's actions in getting British aircraft production working had started to bear fruit. The newly supplied S.E.5s, Bristol Fighters and de Havilland 4s enabled Trenchard to dominate the airspace along the Front before and during the Battle of Messines. Although the Flying Corps' reserves remained low, Trenchard and his staff were then able to begin planning for Haig's upcoming offensive at Ypres. Bombing raids on London In June 1917, the Gotha raid on London led to a public outcry and Trenchard was summoned to see the Prime Minister, Lloyd George. Trenchard outlined the general air situation and provided recommendations for action. Lloyd George pressed for Mannheim to be bombed forthwith which Trenchard resisted, seeing it as a tokenistic attempt at revenge. However, on his return to France, Trenchard did begin making preparations for a strategic bombing campaign against the Germans and contrary to his advice two fighter squadrons were withdrawn from the Front and assigned to daylight patrolling duties over the English Channel. The German Air Service capitalized on the Flying Corps' weakened state in France, bombing towns, trenches, ammunition dumps and depots. The British corps commanders then pressed Trenchard to make air protection his top priority which Trenchard rejected as he was focussed on bombing and reconnoitring the German rear in preparation for Haig's next offensive.Boyle 1962:pp. 221-223 After London was bombed for a second time, the Government tasked General Jan Smuts with investigating the arrangements for governing the British air services. His report was issued by August 1917 and it recommended the establishment of an independent air force which would be managed by its own government ministry. Trenchard received an advanced copy and expressed his disagreement. In Trenchard's view, the disruption that would be caused by merging the two air services and particularly by creating a separate ministry would detract from the vital task of pressing home the recently gained advantages in the air over the Western Front.Boyle 1962:pp. 223-232 From 28 September to 1 October, German Gothas and Zeppelins bombed London once more. The British Cabinet wanted immediate action and Trenchard was summoned from France again. Trenchard arrived by air on 2 October, making an emergency landing at Lympne in Kent after the flight of aircraft carrying him and his staff had been mistaken for a German air raid. On his arrival in London, Trenchard briefed the Cabinet that his first bomber airfield at Ochey near Nancy was ready and Lloyd George urged that the bombing begin as soon as possible. Trenchard's visit to the British capital also afforded him the opportunity of discussing the future of the air services with Smuts. Trenchard stated his concerns, in particular that the planning for a future air force was based upon grossly unrealistic figures for aircraft production.Boyle 1962:pp. 234-237 Strategic bombing of German industry In October, British bombers arrived at Ochey and became the first elements of the newly created 41st Wing under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Cyril Newall. Preparations for bombing missions then began in earnest and only six days later two flights of de Havilland aircraft conducted the Flying Corps' first long-range bombing mission. The Burbach iron foundry was hit, as were other buildings and railway lines. A week later Handley Page aircraft of the 41st Wing conducted the first night-time bombing raid at long range. Bombing continued into November until the winter weather commenced.Boyle 1962:pp. 239-240 In London, the propaganda value of the raids was what mattered most to the Government and Trenchard was praised as a commander and organizer of the highest order. Trenchard himself disliked conducting a campaign to satisfy political concerns even though he had the freedom to select targets. More specifically, Trenchard wished to concentrate his forces on supporting the Army rather than divide his limited number of aircraft between two unrelated bombing campaigns.Boyle 1962:p. 240 Replacement During December 1917, Trenchard remained GOC the Royal Flying Corps in the Field and spent Christmas at his old headquarters at Saint-Omer. There had been much discussion about whether Trenchard might continue as GOC whilst simultaneously holding the post of Chief of the Air Staff in the soon to be created Royal Air Force. In the end it was decided that such an arrangement was impractical and Trenchard was succeeded in France by Major- General John Salmond.Boyle 1962:pp. 255-260 NotesReferences  * * Category:Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard Category:Royal Flying Corps ","title":"Hugh Trenchard as commander of the Royal Flying Corps in France"},{"id":"24564810","text":"Yoram Bauman at the 2010 Texas Book Festival.

This initiative, known as Washington Initiative 732, would have imposed a steadily increasing tax on emissions of carbon dioxide, and used the revenue to offset other taxes. Washington relies on a sales tax for much of its revenue, making its state tax code one of the most regressive tax codes in the nation. Had it passed, its supporters asserted that it would have decreased the sales tax, eliminated the business and occupation tax on manufacturing, and expanded the state's earned-income tax credit for low-income households.

It is a part of the formal agreements between political parties on forming a coalition government. It states that if a certain political case is brought up, the coalition is considered dissolved. Use in Norway=Syse Cabinet In practice, the use has usually related to the question of Norway and the European Union. This question is a cross-cutting cleavage, splitting parties who would otherwise be more cooperating. It was first used by Jan P. Syse's Cabinet, which assumed office in 1989. It was known from the 1972 EEC referendum that the \\"European question\\" was a divisive one in Norwegian politics, and the coalition parties (Conservative, Christian Democratic, Centre) held different views. The \\"suicide paragraph\\" was a part of a 22-point declaration that was put together after the 1989 general election (not before, as had been the tradition during the 1980s). Through the paragraph, the coalition parties \\"agreed to disagree\\" on the issue. As it turned out, the suicide paragraph and the European question caused the coalition to dissolve after only one year.Narud and Str√∏m, 2007: p. 161 The strongly EU-sceptical Centre Party parted ways with the pro- EU Conservatives, and the parties have not been coalition partners since. A Labour cabinet took over, proposed and negotiated EU membership but backed down after the 1994 referendum in which the electorate rejected this. Bondevik Cabinet Labour held office until after the 1997 general election. Kjell Magne Bondevik's First Cabinet, a coalition of the Christian Democratic, Centre and Liberal parties, assumed office then, but did not have a suicide paragraph. However, when Kjell Magne Bondevik's Second Cabinet (Christian Democratic, Conservative, Liberal) assumed office in 2001, a suicide paragraph was a part of the post-election Declaration of Sem. Unlike in 1989, it was not clear that the EU was an actual forthcoming issue. However, the parties decided to keep it as a safeguard, and the paragraph now meant that the coalition would disband if the European question reached the broader political \\"agenda\\". Prime Minister Kjell Magne Bondevik represented an EU-sceptical party, and was personally prepared to resign, an action which would dissolve the cabinet. Dagbladet's commentator noted that the will to remain in coalition was strong, so the suicide paragraph actually vitalized Bondevik's Second Cabinet, securing a state of non-debate and thus a prolonged life of the coalition. The cabinet remained intact throughout the term. Stoltenberg Cabinet Long before the fall of Bondevik's Second Cabinet, a group of opposition parties (Labour, Centre, Socialist Left) had discussions on a possible Red-Green Coalition. Long before the 2005 general election it was speculated that such a coalition would need suicide paragraph as much as Bondevik's coalition. This was officially confirmed by the EU-sceptical party leaders of the Centre and Socialist Left parties after the election victory, on the day the Red-Green Coalition (Jens Stoltenberg's Second Cabinet) began drafting their First Declaration of Soria Moria. The end declaration did in fact contain a suicide paragraph, and the pro-EU Minister of Foreign Affairs Jonas Gahr St√∏re declared his adherence to the principle. On the other hand, it became clear that the Socialist Left Party had to sacrifice their scepticism towards NATO and their general anti-Americanism. The cabinet remained intact, and even won re-election in 2009.

The story focuses on high school occultist, Andromeda, who simultaneously tries to save her beloved local library from modernization and solve the various mysteries surrounding: her missing much-older boyfriend; the strange signs seemingly being sent to her from her recently deceased best friend Daisy; and her ever more prophetic tarot readings. Plot summary Andromeda Klein is a teenage girl with many problems. She is unattractive, hard of hearing, her best friend and former magick partner Daisy recently died of cancer, \\"St. Steve\\" her boyfriend has gone missing, her mother is completely overbearing and her father is a paranoid conspiracist. She makes sense of the world through her complete immersion in the world of Magick and tarot, even taking on a job at her local library, which conveniently houses an impressive collection of esoteric books on just such subjects. When a list comes in, threatening to wipe the entire collection, Andromeda immediately enlists the help of all those she can find, and begins her battle with the \\"Friends of the Library\\". Meanwhile, Andromeda begins to receive myriad messages from Daisy, beyond the grave and plies Daisy's younger brother with naked girl magazines (or \\"bagel worm agonies\\" as she mishears thanks to her partial deafness) in exchange for the remaining scraps of her dead best friend's belongings. She then uses these as part of her witchcraft in an attempt to figure out just what Daisy is trying to tell her. Rosalie van Genuchten, and the rest of Andromeda's \\"afternoon tea\\" (alcohol and drugs) party friends, sick of her pining for St. Steve, attempt to set her up with various potential suitors who Andromeda dismisses on sight. However, in this process, she picks up Byron, a short guy with unfortunate facial hair who nevertheless becomes a kind of apprentice to Andromeda's occultism, and confidant as new, exciting, but generally confusing text messages suddenly start coming in from St. Steve. The story gathers pace as Andromeda's tarot readings become increasingly literal and prophetic, sparking interest from fellow students, eager to know their futures, and more pressingly, who their boyfriends are cheating on them with. Andromeda's dreams start to feature a powerful new figure, called \\"The King of Sacramento\\", she begins to hear a voice in her head (that calls itself Huggy) and in a crescendo of increasingly elaborate and freaky spells, the mysteries of St. Steve, her tarot readings, and Daisy all become clear. Songs Portman recorded two songs \\"Andromeda Klein\\" and \\"Bethlehem\\" to promote the book which were later released as a digital download and 7 inch single through Jealous Butcher Records. Controversy Portman has reported that a planned promotional visit to a school in a Portland, Oregon area was cancelled due to \\"parental worries about the occult elements\\" in Andromeda Klein. Portman has since performed at an event related to Banned Books Week at the San Francisco Public Library.

The plot follows an unwed young mother whose life is transformed with the arrival of a travelling troupe of actors to her Irish village. The script was written by Shane Connaughton, an Oscar nominee for My Left Foot. The film was shot in his native village Redhills, in County Cavan, Ireland.The Irish Filmography 1896‚Äì1996; Red Mountain Press (Dublin); 1996. Page 204  Plot  In a small Irish village in 1957, Tara Maguire, a young resolute woman, is the talk of the town because she is having a baby out of wedlock, and refuses to name the father. During Sunday mass she goes into labour giving birth to a baby boy. Sergeant Brendan Hegarty, the local police officer of the Garda S√≠och√°na, and Mick, a local landowner, vie for Tara's hand in marriage, but she refuses them both. Mick loses his cattle and facing economical ruin commits suicide. People in town blame his death on Tara's rejection. The local priest, Father Malone, attempts to compel Tara to marry the constable before another tragedy takes place. But Tara is not in love with the solemn and older Sgt. Hegarty, a reformed alcoholic, who hides the fury of his unrequited love for Tara in his devotion for her. He carves a cradle for the baby, but Tara vehemently refuses the gift and his attentions. The beautiful and strong willed Tara lives with her sister Brigid and is determined to make it on her own. She supplements her income as a dressmaker, raising chickens in her garden and smuggling goods from the nearby border with Northern Ireland. However even in this she has to face Hegarty who discovers her secret illegal dealings while riding his bicycle at night looking for smugglers on the roads. The arrival of a shabby troupe of travelling actors called the \\"Playboys\\", stirs the town. Tara surprises Tom, one of the actors, stealing one of her chickens. He has to pay for it, but he is smitten with her beauty and her character. They flirt and spar around the village, all under the resentful eye of the constable. The Playboys are a success in the sleepy village and the tent is full when the show starts at night. One of their numbers with female dancers lifting their skirts causes a furious response from Father Malone, who has another opinion of what is wholesome entertainment. The actors are forced to switch to staging Othello. A blind woman gets so excited during a show that she suddenly regains her vision. Not only do the group of actors have to deal with discord when the time to share the dividends comes, but the recent arrival of television threatens the survival of their art. The romance between Tara and Tom grows slowly over the few days the theatrical company is in the village. Her past has made her suspicious of men, and Hegarty's intrusions provide an added obstacle. He tells her that Tom is a liar who already has a wife, which turn out not to be true. Hegarty confronts Tom and tells him that he is the father of the baby, but Tara assures him that not only she does not have any feelings for the constable but that the baby was conceived on a lonely night without deep feeling involved on her part. One of the actors is involved with the IRA and has smuggled some explosives. When the explosives are accidentally discovered by Hegarty he blames his rival. Tom is framed as an IRA man, but he breaks out of jail with Tara's help. When Gone With the Wind plays at the local cinema, the actors stage an instant, improvised knock-off of it, with Atlanta burning while Tom struggles with his lines in the role of Rhett Butler. Comically, Fred (Milo O'Shea) has to take the role of Mammy. During the show the triangle between Tara, Tom and Sergeant Hegarty comes to a boiling point. The performance is interrupted by the frantic Brigid. Hegarty, drunk, has taken the baby. He comes to the tent, drunk, but gives the baby back to Tara. There is a confrontation between Tom and the Sergeant, but the Sergeant painfully loses in a public fist fight with Tom. Even after this defeat, he trashes the tent. The next day the time for the playboys to leave has come. Hegarty, now jobless and in civilian clothes, also leaves the town for good. Tom is happily surprised when Tara decides to join the group with her baby and share a life together, perhaps in the end to take on a new life with Tom in America.

They begin an affair encumbered by Beaty's job as a call girl. They eventually fall in love, but predictably he grows increasingly uncomfortable with her line of work. In addition Emory has a bit of a dark secret from his past involving the accidental death of his then-wife. To further complicate things, Beaty has shared custody of a young son. Eventually a pair of unsavory characters from each of the lovers' pasts shows up and further endangers their love. Emory's gay friend Max (Murray Salem) arrives and wants to cut Emory in on an upcoming drug deal. He is simultaneously foppish, arrogant and abrasive. Beaty's abusive former lover, the father of her son and possibly her pimp is Alex (Paul Angelis), a strong-arm gorilla type fresh out of prison also arrives, needing a place to stay. Alex is clearly a brutish psychopath who threatens Beaty and Emory's future. Emory and Beaty's two past companions could not be more different, Max is sophisticated, articulate, stylish and outspoken. Alex is a working class English thug, quiet, simple and burning with violent rage. Beaty rebuffs Alex's desire to rekindle whatever they had and this enrages him. He does however agree to be part of Max and Emory's caper (believing it to be gun smuggling). On the day of the caper, Max, Emory and Alex end up in a car together with Max continuously taunting Alex. Alex finally has enough and shoots Max dead in the car. Emory and Alex dispose of the body and it becomes apparent that Alex is aware of Emory's intention to take Beaty and her son away. He is resigned to this and insists that Emory take some surplus cash found on Max's body. Emory drops Alex off with the smuggled drugs where Alex promises to 'take care of' (kill) the drugs' intended recipients to keep them from bothering Alex, Emory or Beaty. When Emory and Beaty first reunite, she refuses to leave the country with him, citing a concern about her son, clearly having trouble uprooting and letting go of her past even though with the proceeds from the smuggling, they will be well set up and she will never have to work at her past profession again. The end shows Emory, Beaty and her child racing to catch a plane, free of their past encumbrances.

Henry had gone to Girls' Latin School in Boston, where ‚Äúwe learned‚Ä¶ to appreciate and enjoy our important commonalities, amid our external differences of class, community, or color.‚Äù She had taught in overseas military dependents' schools, which were integrated. Henry and her husband had been in New Orleans for two months when the superintendent called to offer her a teaching position. When Henry asked if the job was in a school that would be integrated, the superintendent replied, ‚ÄúWould that make any difference to you?‚Äù She said no. On the first day of the school year in 1960, Henry's and Bridges' relentless refusal to be intimidated caused them to become renowned figures in the American civil rights struggle. As soon as Bridges got into the school, white parents went in and brought their own children out; all but one of the white teachers also refused to teach while a black child was enrolled. Only Barbara Henry was willing to teach Bridges, and for more than a year Mrs. Henry taught her alone, \\"as if she were teaching a whole class.\\" That first day, Ruby and her adult companions spent the entire day in the principal's office; the chaos of the school prevented their moving to the classroom until the second day. Ruby Bridges was initially apprehensive upon meeting Henry for the first time, recalling later that \\"I had never seen a white teacher before, but Mrs. Henry was the nicest teacher I ever had. She tried very hard to keep my mind off what was going on outside. But I couldn't forget that there were no other kids.\\" The court-ordered first day of integrated schools in New Orleans, November 14, 1960, was commemorated by Norman Rockwell in the painting The Problem We All Live With.

The coins, mostly from Mercia and Wessex, indicate that the hoard was hidden, possibly to protect it from Viking raiders, in around 868.Rogers, J.

Many of the artefacts were decorated with stylized niello animals, a feature of Anglo-Saxon art which has since become known as Trewhiddle style decoration.Laing, J. Anglo-Saxon England, vol. 5, p. 181 (1979) The Trewhiddle Ingot Another remarkable discovery was made in 2003, when a 150-year-old lump of tungsten was found at Trewhiddle Farm. This may predate the earliest known smelting of the metal (which requires extremely high temperatures) and has led to speculation that it may have been produced during a visit by Rudolf Erich Raspe to Happy-Union mine (at nearby Pentewan) in the late eighteenth century. Raspe, best known as the author or translator of the Baron Munchausen stories, was also a chemist with a particular interest in tungsten. Trewhiddle House and estate The legendary Cornish smuggler Cruel Coppinger may have been based on John Copinger, said to have purchased the Trewhiddle estate in the 1790s. In the 1840s, Trewhiddle House was home to the entomologist and botanist Francis Polkinghorne Pascoe. In the late twentieth century the house became a restaurant (the 'Trewhiddle Inn') and the estate a tourist campsite. Both house and estate have now been sold to developers and a number of 'New England-style' holiday villas have now been built. Little evidence remains of the former house other than a capped-off well and a small portion of the former walls which have been built into the landscaping.

Education John Rosewell received his early education at Berwick-upon-Tweed, Northumberland. He matriculated at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, on 2 April 1652, and subsequently moved to Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He received his B.A. degree on 16 October 1655, was elected Fellow of Corpus Christi in 1656, and received his M.A. on 17 March 1658/9. John (Johannes) Rosewell was ordained as a Deacon at Christ Church Cathedral, Oxford on 31 March 1661. He received his B.D. degree on 31 October 1667 and was incorporated at Cambridge in 1668. Early years While at Corpus Christi, in the period 1653‚Äì54, Rosewell was prescribed for \\"a very hot stomach\\" by the apothecary, Jeremiah Webbe. From 1666, he made regular contributions to the \\"New Building\\", Corpus Christi College, reaching a total of ¬£744 by February 1668. Reputation Rosewell succeeded Thomas Mountague as Head Master of Eton in 1671 and was the last \\"alien\\" (non-Etonian) to be elected to the position for many years. He was held in high esteem for his learning. Rosewell seems to have greatly increased the reputation of the school, and is styled by one of his pupils, ludimagister celeberrimus (renowned schoolmaster). A manuscript records in 1678 that \\"then it was that the foundation of its (Eton's) present grandeur was laid\\". First list of Eton School During his period as Head Master, in 1678, a list of the school was produced ‚Äî the earliest complete list extant ‚Äî giving the names of 207 boys, 78 of whom were in College. No other list is forthcoming for another forty years. It is written, not printed, on a half-sheet of parchment. The seventh form had long been abolished, the sixth being the highest. In each form, except the sixth, the names of Collegers and Oppidans are given separately. In this list also, brothers were distinguished by the style of major, minor, and minimus, and so forth, as at the present day. Resignation In 1678, Rosewell obtained a canonry at Windsor, and in 1682 resigned the headmastership. According to a rumour of the day, his resignation was caused by his falling into a fit of melancholy madness, in consequence of having killed a boy by immoderate flogging, and fancying that the King's messengers were coming to arrest him. The story does not sound very probable, and the less so as he was elected a Fellow of Eton in 1683. His successor as Head Master was Charles Roderick, Etonian and Kingsman, who had been Usher (Lower Master) from 1676. Will John Rosewell wrote his will on 24 June 1684 leaving his valuable library to Corpus Christi College, Oxford; ¬£300 for \\"the benefit and use of Eton College School\\"; ¬£200 to the Church of Windsor; ¬£50 to his \\"kinsman\\" William Rosewell (Eton Scholar and later Master of King's College School, Cambridge); ¬£40 to the town of Berwick-upon-Tweed; and ¬£20 towards the erecting and building of a Chapel for St Mary Magdalen Hall, Oxford.

The species was first named as the Bornean slow loris in 1892, but lumped into the widespread Sunda slow loris (N. coucang) in 1952. However, it was promoted to full species status ‚Äì again as the Bornean slow loris ‚Äì based on molecular analysis in 2006. In 2013, two former subspecies of the Bornean slow loris were elevated to species status, and a new species‚ÄîN. kayan‚Äîwas recognized among the Bornean population. Weighing , it is one of the smallest of the slow lorises, and can be distinguished from other slow lorises by its pale golden to red fur, the lack of markings on its head, and consistent absence of a second upper incisor. Like other slow lorises, it has a vestigial tail, round head, short ears, a curved grooming claw for grooming, and a gland that produces an oily toxin that the animal uses for defense. The Philippine slow loris is arboreal, nocturnal, and occurs in low densities, making it difficult to locate. It is also the least studied of Indonesia's slow lorises. It is found at elevations between in primary and secondary lowland forest, gardens, and plantations. Information about its diet is limited, but it is suspected to be one of the more insectivorous slow loris species, and is also known to eat gum from woody plants. The Bornean slow loris species complex ‚Äì including the Philippine slow loris ‚Äì was classified as \\"Vulnerable\\" by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 2008, is included in CITES Appendix I, which prevents international commercial trade, and is protected by Indonesian law. Prior to being divided into four distinct species in 2013, it was found in numerous protected areas within its range, making it the least threatened of the slow lorises. However, since the taxonomic split, it may face a higher risk of extinction. It is sparsely distributed throughout its range and is threatened by illegal wildlife trade, including the exotic pet trade, and habitat loss. Taxonomy and phylogeny The Bornean slow loris was first described based on specimens collected by Frank S. Bourns and Dean C. Worcester during the Menage Scientific Expedition to the Philippines and Borneo in the early 1890s. The original collection was made between 5 October and 5 November 1891 near Tataan, Tawi-Tawi Island, in the Philippines, however this type specimen is missing as of 2013. The specimens were given to Henry F. Nachtrieb, President of the Minnesota Academy of Sciences and Chairman of the Zoology Department at the University of Minnesota. Nachtrieb was the first to use the name menagensis in 1892, based on a description of the species sent to him by Worcester in 1891. Worcester's progress report included a description of the specimen and an explanation on how they had obtained it: Nachtrieb did not assign the name to a specific genus, noting that it was \\"an undescribed member of the Lemuridae\\". The following year, the English naturalist Richard Lydekker published the combination Lemur menagensis in The Zoological Record. This makes Lydekker the authority of the species name menagensis, because he was the first to use the specific name in combination with the name of a genus, although some subsequent authors credited other workers. In his influential 1953 book Primates: Comparative Anatomy and Taxonomy, the primatologist William Charles Osman Hill placed all the slow lorises in one species, N. coucang. In 1971, however, Colin Groves recognized the pygmy slow loris (N. pygmaeus) as a separate species, and divided N. coucang into four subspecies, including Nycticebus coucang menagensis. Nycticebus menagensis was elevated to the species level in 2006 when molecular analysis of DNA sequences of the D-loop and the cytochrome b gene demonstrated it to be genetically distinct from N. coucang. The genetic evidence was corroborated by both a previous study (1998) on morphology (based on craniodental measurements) that indicated distinct differences between the subspecies that were consistent with separation at the species level, and a later study (2010) of facial markings. Early in its own taxonomic history, distinguishing coloration patterns and size differences resulted in the division of Nycticebus menagensis into four subspecies: N. m. bancanus, N. m. borneanus, N. m. menagensis, and N. m. philippinus. These later became taxonomic synonyms, although in 2013 N. bancanus and N. borneanus were elevated to species status based on unique facial markings. Furthermore, a new species‚ÄîN. kayan‚Äîwas also identified within the Bornean population. The southern Philippine slow lorises (N. m. philippinus or N. philippinus) identified by Spanish zoologist √Ångel Cabrera in 1908 remains a synonym of N. menagensis, since the 2013 study was unable to find its type specimen and found no distinguishable characteristics between the two populations. The syntype for N. menagensis was collected by Lydekker in 1893 from the Philippine island of Tawi-Tawi, giving menagensis precedence over philippinus as the name of the species, under the Principle of Priority. Physical description Like all slow lorises, the tail of the Philippine slow loris is vestigial and it has a round head and short ears. It has a rhinarium (the moist, naked surface around the nostrils of the nose) and a broad, flat face with large eyes. On its front feet, the second digit is smaller than the rest; the big toe on its hind foot opposes the other toes, which enhances its gripping power. Its second toe on the hind foot has a curved grooming claw that the animal uses for scratching and grooming, while the other nails are straight. It also possesses a specialized arrangement of lower front teeth, called a toothcomb, which is also used for grooming, as with other lemuriform primates. It also has a small swelling on the ventral side of its elbow called the brachial gland, which secretes a pungent, clear oily toxin that the animal uses defensively by wiping it on its toothcomb. The body weight of this species is typically in the range of , although weights of up to have been recorded. The body length averages , and its skull length ranges between , roughly intermediate in size between the smaller pygmy slow loris and the larger Sunda slow loris. The slow lorises of Borneo are among the smallest of its genus, but this species can be distinguished from the others by its pale golden to red fur, low-contrast markings on its face and head, and the consistent lack of a second upper incisor. The rings around the eyes are either rounded or diffused-edged on top, while the bottom occasionally extends down below the zygomatic arch. The stripe between its eyes is narrow, the ears usually lack fur, the patch on the top of the head is mostly diffused, and the band of fur in front of the ears varies in width. In comparison to the other three species of slow lorises on Borneo, both N. menagensis and N. kayan have a pale body coloration, but this species has pale, very lightly-contrasting facial markings, with markedly less contrast than the dark, high-contrast face mask of N. kayan. Additionally, this species has short, unfluffed body hair, in contrast to the longer, fluffier body hair of N. kayan. Distribution N. menagensis is found primarily in coastal and lowland areas in northern and eastern Borneo, in the provinces of Brunei, Sabah, and East Kalimantan. It is also found on the southern Philippine Islands, known as the Sulu Archipelago, and may be found on other nearby islands, such as the Banggi Island off Sabah. In the Sulu Archipelago, it occurs in the Tawi-Tawi Group, in the west of the archipelago, including the islands of Tawi-Tawi, Bongao, Sanga-Sanga, Simunul, and possibly other small islands. It does not occur on the island of Jolo or further to the east, as was claimed by one erroneous report from Mindanao. The species may be extinct on some Philippine islands, but is likely to persist on the smaller islands. Because the species is so popular as a pet, zoologists Guy Musser and Lawrence Heaney suggested in 1985 that the Philippine populations may have been introduced there by humans. Of the four slow lorises living on Borneo, N. menagensis is believed to be partly sympatric with N. kayan only, with ranges that overlap in East Kalimantan and Sabah. Fossils of this species have been found in the Late Pleistocene site of Niah in Sarawak. Habitat and ecology The slow lorises of Borneo are the least studied of Indonesia's slow lorises. In a field study at the Sabangau National Park in Central Kalimantan, only 12 slow loris sightings were made over a 75-day period. All were seen in the trees at heights of . They were encountered singly, as mother and offspring, or in adult trios. Of the two trios, both were on fruiting trees, Calophyllum hosei and Syzygium cf. nigricans. In another survey conducted at Wehea Forest, East Kalimantan, only one Philippine slow loris‚Äîseen at a height of ‚Äîwas encountered in an area of more than . Other surveys confirm that the animal is difficult to locate, and occurs in low densities. The species occurs in primary and secondary lowland forest, gardens, and plantations, at elevations between . Interviews conducted with Philippines locals indicate that it is commonly seen in citrus trees (calamansi), and may be tolerant of a variety of habitats. It is nocturnal, and almost entirely arboreal. Although data on diet is limited, based on cranial size and morphology, the Philippine slow loris is suspected to be one of the more insectivorous slow loris species. It has also been observed feeding on the gum from an unidentified liana (a long-stemmed woody vine). Conservation In a 2005 report on the effect of logging on wildlife conservation in Indonesia, the authors claimed N. menagensis to be \\"common\\" throughout Borneo. However, as pointed out by Nekaris and colleagues, this assessment was based on field research data and historic museum specimens, and cannot be considered reliable, as \\"loris ‚Äòpresence‚Äô is usually not determined first-hand, and it also cannot be presumed that lorises still occur in areas from where they were once collected.\\" The species appears to be uncommon throughout its range, including a very limited distribution in the Philippines. Surveys have demonstrated that, compared to other slow loris species, the Philippine slow loris is rare, and sparsely distributed throughout its range. N. menagensis is listed in CITES Appendix I, which prevents international commercial trade; it is also protected by Indonesian law. The species is often confused with other slow lorises in animal rescue centers, as it is not well-covered in field guides. The species occurs in a number of protected areas throughout its range, including some fragmented forests. Threats to the species include the illegal local exotic pet trade and habitat loss due to burning and conversion to palm oil plantations. Additionally, uncontrolled release of pets in some areas is also a threat to the species. Prior to being split into four species in 2013, the Bornean slow loris species complex was among the least threatened of the slow lorises, and its situation was considered to be good due to its presence in a high percentage of \\"low risk\\" areas on Borneo. It was classified as \\"Vulnerable\\" by the IUCN, who consider there to have been a greater than 30% reduction in population between roughly 1984 and 2008, based on harvesting for the pet trade and extensive habitat loss. Because that species complex has been divided into four distinct species since the 2008 IUCN assessment, each of the new species likely faces a higher risk of extinction. Accordingly, each of them are expected to be listed as \\"Vulnerable\\" at the least, with some of them likely to be assigned to a higher-risk category.

Biography He was born in July 1591 in Bremen, Germany, to where his parents had fled from Belgium to escape religious persecution. He acquired great reputation for his knowledge of the oriental languages. He was also an able lawyer and divine and took his degree of doctor in the latter faculty. He studied the oriental languages under Drusius and Erpenius and after having been professor of theology and Hebrew at Harderwijk for eight years was in 1627 made professor of Hebrew at Leyden on which occasion he delivered an harangue on the dignity and utility of the Hebrew language and it was his constant endeavour to diffuse a knowledge of that language and of the Arabic and Syriac among his countrymen that they might be the better enabled to combat the objections of the Jews to the Christian religion. He translated and published several editions of the popular ‚ÄòTravels of Rabbi Benjamin ben Jonah‚Äô, one Latin-Hebrew Edition with and another one without notes, one Hebrew Edition at Bale, which his Friends ‚Äì the Buxdorffs ‚Äì sent to Joseph Scaliger who mentioned it favorably in a letter, which was included in a version of Benjamins Travels, printed in 1666 in Amsterdam, collated with a Dutch translation of the Bara, together with a text from the celebrated rabbi Manassah ben Israel. The Emperor-edition of Rabbi Benjamin of Tudela Itinerary was the bases for a popular German and French translation in the 17th and 18th Century. In 1639 l‚ÄôEmpereur was appointed advisor to the very successful Johan Maurits van Nassau, who was governor of Dutch Brazil from 1637‚Äì1644. l‚ÄôEmpereur died in June 1648 very soon after he had begun a course of theology at Leyden. Amongst his closest friends were Daniel Heinsius, the Buxtorffs and Lewis de Dieu, minister of the Eglise Wallon. For a biography of Lewis de Dieu, see Alexander Chalmers, The General Biographical Dictionary:, \\"Lewis de Dieu\\", Vol. 12, p. 65. Printed for J. Nichols, 1813. Daniel Heinsius and the Buxtorfs spoke very highly of him. He offered at one time to superintend the printing of a Talmudical dictionary in Holland and endeavoured to bring the younger Buxtorf to Leyden who had undertaken to defend the vowel points against Louis Cappel. He was also corresponding with the notable archbishop Usher. Works L'Empereur's works are: Commentarius ad codicem Babylonicum, seu Tractatus Thalmudicus de mensuris Templi (Leyden, 1630), Versio et Notae ad Paraphrasin Josephi Jachiadae in Danielem (Amsterdam, 1633), Itinerarium D.

In many of the alternative communities established in Britain in the early 1900s, \\"nudism, anarchism, vegetarianism and free love were accepted as part of a politically radical way of life\\". In the 1920s, the inhabitants of the anarchist community at Whiteway, near Stroud in Gloucestershire, \\"shocked the conservative residents of the area with their shameless nudity\\". Mainly, it had importance within individualist anarchist circles in Spain, France, Portugal and Cuba. Anarcho-naturism advocates vegetarianism, free love, nudism, hiking and an ecological world view within anarchist groups and outside them. Anarcho-naturism also promotes an ecological worldview, small ecovillages, and most prominently nudism as a way to avoid the artificiality of the industrial mass society of modernity. Naturist individualist anarchists see the individual in their biological, physical and psychological aspects and try to eliminate social determinations.  History = Early influences  An important early influence on anarchist naturism was the thought of Henry David Thoreau, Leo Tolstoy and √âlis√©e Reclus. Walden by Henry David Thoreau. Influential early eco-anarchist work Thoreau was an American author, poet, naturalist, tax resister, development critic, surveyor, historian, philosopher, and leading transcendentalist. He is best known for his book Walden, a reflection upon simple living in natural surroundings, and his essay, Civil Disobedience, an argument for individual resistance to civil government in moral opposition to an unjust state. His thought is an early influence on green anarchism, but with an emphasis on the individual experience of the natural world, influencing later naturist currents. Simple living as a rejection of a materialist lifestyle and self-sufficiency were Thoreau's goals, and the whole project was inspired by transcendentalist philosophy. \\"Many have seen in Thoreau one of the precursors of ecologism and anarcho-primitivism represented today in John Zerzan. For George Woodcock this attitude can be also motivated by certain idea of resistance to progress and of rejection of the growing materialism which is the nature of American society in the mid-19th century.\\" John Zerzan himself included the text \\"Excursions\\" (1863) by Thoreau in his edited compilation of anti-civilization writings called Against civilization: Readings and reflections from 1999.  France  For the influential French anarchist √âlis√©e Reclus, naturism \\"was at the same time a physical means of revitalization, a rapport with the body completely different from the hypocrisy and taboos which prevailed at the time, a more convivial way to see life in society, and an incentive to respect the planet. Thus naturism develops in France, in particular under the influence of √âlis√©e Reclus, at the end of the 19th century and beginning of the 20th century among anarchistic communities resulting from utopian socialism.\\" In France, later important propagandists of anarcho-naturism include Henri Zisly and √âmile Gravelle who collaborated in La Nouvelle Humanit√©, Le Naturien, Le Sauvage, L'Ordre Naturel, and La Vie Naturelle. Their ideas were important in individualist anarchist circles in France as well as Spain, where Federico Urales (pseudonym of Joan Montseny) promoted the ideas of Gravelle and Zisly in La Revista Blanca (1898-1905). Zisly's political activity, \\"primarily aimed at supporting a return to 'natural life' through writing and practical involvement, stimulated lively confrontations within and outside the anarchist environment. Zisly vividly criticized progress and civilization, which he regarded as 'absurd, ignoble, and filthy.' He openly opposed industrialization, arguing that machines were inherently authoritarian, defended nudism, advocated a non- dogmatic and non-religious adherence to the 'laws of nature,' recommended a lifestyle based on limited needs and self-sufficiency, and disagreed with vegetarianism, which he considered 'anti-scientific.'\\" Richard D. Sonn comments on the influence of naturist views in the wider French anarchist movement: =Henri Zisly= Henri Zisly (born in Paris, November 2, 1872; died in 1945)Henri Zisly page; from the Daily Bleed's Anarchist Encyclopedia was a French individualist anarchist and naturist. He participated alongside Henri Beylie and √âmile Gravelle in many journals such as La Nouvelle Humanit√© and La Vie Naturelle, which promoted anarchist-naturism. In 1902, he was one of the main initiators, alongside Georges Butaud and Sophie Za√Økowska, of the cooperative Colonie de Vaux established in Ess√¥mes-sur-Marne, in l'Aisne. Zisly's political activity, \\"primarily aimed at supporting a return to 'natural life' through writing and practical involvement, stimulated lively confrontations within and outside the anarchist environment. Zisly vividly criticized progress and civilization, which he regarded as 'absurd, ignoble, and filthy.' He openly opposed industrialization, arguing that machines were inherently authoritarian, defended nudism, advocated a non-dogmatic and non- religious adherence to the 'laws of nature,' recommended a lifestyle based on limited needs and self-sufficiency, and disagreed with vegetarianism, which he considered 'anti-scientific.'\\"  Spain  This relationship between anarchism and naturism was quite important at the end of the 1920s in Spain: Isaac Puente, an influential Spanish anarchist during the 1920s and 1930s and an important propagandist of anarcho-naturism, was a militant of both the CNT anarcho-syndicalist trade union and Iberian Anarchist Federation. He published the book El Comunismo Libertario y otras proclamas insurreccionales y naturistas (en:Libertarian Communism and other insurrectionary and naturist proclaims) in 1933, which sold around 100,000 copies, and wrote the final document for the Extraordinary Confederal Congress of Zaragoza of 1936 which established the main political line for the CNT for that year. Puente was a doctor who approached his medical practice from a naturist point of view. He saw naturism as an integral solution for the working classes, alongside Neo- Malthusianism, and believed it concerned the living being while anarchism addressed the social being. He believed capitalist societies endangered the well-being of humans from both a socioeconomic and sanitary viewpoint, and promoted anarcho-communism alongside naturism as a solution. This ecological tendency in Spanish anarchism was strong enough as to call the attention of the CNT-FAI in Spain. Daniel Gu√©rin in Anarchism: From Theory to Practice reports:  Cuba  The historian Kirwin R. Schaffer in his study of Cuban anarchism reports anarcho-naturism as \\"[a] third strand within the island's anarchist movement\\" alongside anarcho-communism and anarcho-syndicalism. Naturism offered a global alternative health and lifestyle movement. Naturists focused on redefining one's life to live simply, to eat cheap but nutritious vegetarian diets, and to raise one's own food if possible. The countryside was posited as a romantic alternative to urban living, and some naturists even promoted what they saw as the healthful benefits of nudism. Globally, the naturist movement counted anarchists, liberals, and socialists as its followers. However, in Cuba a particular \\"anarchist\\" dimension evolved led by people like Adri√°n del Valle, who spearheaded the Cuban effort to shift naturism's focus away from only individual health to naturism having a \\"social emancipatory\\" function.\\" Schaffer reports the influence that anarcho-naturism had outside naturist circles. So \\"[f]or instance, nothing inherently prevented an anarcho-syndicalist in the Havana restaurant workers' union from supporting the alternative health care programs of the anarcho-naturists and seeing those alternative practices as 'revolutionary.'\\". \\"Anarcho-naturists promoted a rural ideal, simple living, and being in harmony with Nature as ways to save the laborers from the increasingly industrialized character of Cuba. Besides promoting an early twentieth-century \\"back-to-the-land\\" movement, they used these romantic images of Nature to illustrate how far removed a capitalist industrialized Cuba had departed from an anarchist view of natural harmony.\\" The main propagandizer in Cuba of anarcho-naturism was the Catalonia born \\"Adri√°n del Valle (aka Palmiro de Lidia)...Over the following decades, Del Valle became a constant presence in not only the anarchist press that proliferated in Cuba but also mainstream literary publications...From 1912 to 1913 he edited the freethinking journal El Audaz. Then he began his largest publishing job by helping to found and edit the monthly alternative health magazine that followed the anarcho-naturist line Pro-Vida.  Other countries  Naturism also met anarchism in the United Kingdom. \\"In many of the alternative communities established in Britain in the early 1900s nudism, anarchism, vegetarianism and free love were accepted as part of a politically radical way of life. In the 1920s the inhabitants of the anarchist community at Whiteway, near Stroud in Gloucestershire, shocked the conservative residents of the area with their shameless nudity.\\" In Italy, during the IX Congress of the Italian Anarchist Federation in Carrara in 1965, a group decided to split off from this organization and created the Gruppi di Iniziativa Anarchica. In the seventies it mostly comprised \\"veteran individualist anarchists with a pacifism orientation, naturism, etc,...\\".  Criticism  American anarcho-syndicalist Sam Dolgoff shows some of the criticism that some people on the other anarchist currents at the time had for anarcho-naturist tendencies. \\"Speaking of life at the Stelton Colony of New York in the 1930s, noted with disdain that it, \\"like other colonies, was infested by vegetarians, naturists, nudists, and other cultists, who sidetracked true anarchist goals.\\" One resident \\"always went barefoot, ate raw food, mostly nuts and raisins, and refused to use a tractor, being opposed to machinery, and he didn't want to abuse horses, so he dug the earth himself.\\" Such self-proclaimed anarchists were in reality \\"ox-cart anarchists,\\" Dolgoff said, \\"who opposed organization and wanted to return to a simpler life.\\" In an interview with Paul Avrich before his death, Dolgoff also grumbled, \\"I am sick and tired of these half-assed artists and poets who object to organization and want only to play with their belly buttons\\".

Redford, Welcome All Wonders: A Composer's Journey (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Books, 1997), 41. In his early twenties, Redford began scoring documentaries and educational films, learning the craft of composing for the cinema. After moving to Los Angeles in the mid-1970s, Redford began to write scores for television, beginning as a co-composer for Starsky & Hutch. In the 1980s, when the American Federation of Musicians called a strike that caused a virtual shutdown of U.S. film and television recording, Redford used the opportunity to continue his musical education. He studied composition with Hal Johnson and conducting with Frederick Zweig, and he took a master class in film composition with Walter Scharf through the UCLA extension program. During this period, Redford wrote concert and chamber music as well. Some years later, Redford studied composition and counterpoint with operatic composer and film orchestrator Thomas Pasatieri.  Career  From 1976 to the present, Redford has been concurrently writing music for film and television, the concert hall, chamber artists, choral ensembles, and the theater.

Many of Redford's orchestral and chamber pieces are settings of poetry or sacred texts. Indeed, \\"poetry is nearly as important to me as music,\\" Redford has stated.J.A.C. Redford, Welcome All Wonders: A Composer's Journey (Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Books, 1997), 240. He has an abiding love for the marriage of music and text, most enjoying the work of poets who created a visceral rhythm with their language. Redford likes the challenge of setting such poems to music that would preserve the natural spoken rhythms of the words and reveal underlying meanings through dramatic shading and color, the tension between consonance and dissonance, counterpoint, and other musical techniques.

Wright wrote that Doctor Jonathan Sibley had reported in 1805, that this stream had been called Vazzures by French explorers. She said this was a corruption of the French word vaseaux, which meant boggy or \\"miry\\", because of the deep mud or mire in the channel bottom. Later, English-speaking traders named the stream, using the English translation.Wright, Muriel H. \\"Some Geographic Names of French Origin in Oklahoma.\\" Chronicles of Oklahoma. Volume 7, Number 2, pp. 188-193. Accessed March 5, 2016.  Historical significance  Muddy Boggy Creek was in territorial days considered a particularly defining characteristic, as there were no bridges and the waterway's sandy banks made it difficult to ford. The Pushmataha District, one of three administrative super-regions comprising the Choctaw Nation in the Indian Territory, used it or its tributaries to form boundaries between Atoka County, Jack's Fork County, Jackson County and Kiamitia County. The District's administrative and judicial capital, Mayhew, was said to be positioned \\"between the forks of the Boggies,\\" a frequent early-day reference to the lower reaches of the river in the plural form.Interview with Cass Vandergriff.

The components of the vessel and a sistership were manufactured in Brooklyn then shipped to San Francisco where the ships were assembled. San Rafael remained in service, primarily as a ferry, until the vessel was sunk in a collision with a ferry on November 30, 1901. Although San Rafael sank rapidly, quick action by the crews limited the loss of life to five persons or fewer. Subsequent litigation established negligence on the part of both captains as the cause of the collision. Design and construction San Rafael and a sistership, Saucelito were built to the same specifications in components at Greenpoint, New York, now a part of Brooklyn. The builder was Benjamin C. Terry. The components were then shipped to the west coast either by railMacMullen, Paddle-wheel days, at 32, 33, and 148. or ship.Stanton, American Steam Vessels, at 439. Terry himself traveled west to supervise the assembly of the vessels. Once complete, San Raphael was said by a newspaper, the San Francisco Call, to be \\"by far the prettiest boat that ever cleft the waters of San Francisco Bay\\".Mariner's Museum, Bard Brothers, at 40 and 42. Both vessels were built as shallow draft-steamboats, which required a light- weight hull. To strengthen the hull, these vessels were built with a \\"hog truss\\", a bridge-like structure arching fore-and-aft along both sides the vessel with the function of stiffening the hull.Hunter, Steamboats of the Western River, at 97.  Operations  San Rafael and Saucelito both ran for the San Francisco and Sausalito ferry line, and were classified as ferries, even though neither was a double-ender. They were considered to be well-fitted and very speedy. Sausalito burned 1884 at the San Quentin wharf. By 1901, San Rafael was probably the last California steamboat in operation to have been built with the hog truss.  Wreck  San Rafael sank near Alcatraz Island on November 30, 1901, following a collision in the fog with the steam ferry Sausalito. Both vessels were owned by the same company, the North Pacific Coast Railroad. San Rafael was bound across San Francisco Bay, from San Francisco to Sausalito. Both vessels were proceeding slowly and ringing fog bells. Both captains realized the other ship was near, and had ordered the engines reversed, but it was too late to prevent a collision. Sausalito struck San Rafael broadside and penetrated ten feet into the dining room, then occupied by many passengers. Prompt action by the captains of the two vessels, in lashing the ships together, kept San Rafael afloat long enough for most of the passengers and crew to evacuate to Sausalito. A boiler explosion on San Rafael was averted when a fireman went into the fireroom, then neck-deep in water, and opened a valve to bleed off the steam in the boilers. Twenty minutes after the collision, San Rafael sank in around 120 feet of water. This sinking is said to have inspired Jack London in writing the opening scenes of his novel The Sea Wolf. The captain of San Rafael, John Tayler Mackenzie, was the last person to leave the sinking vessel.Barbier, \\"Wreck of the San Rafael\\", MCHS.  Aftermath  It was hard to determine how many people had been lost. Initial rumors were that 20 or even 100 people or more had drowned. It was only until everyone had gone home and a careful count could be made that it was concluded that only five(or three ) had died. A board of inquiry found that both captains were at fault for failure to properly sound fog signals, and the licenses of both were suspended. Captain Mackenzie's license was reinstated by January 1902. He received a testimonial signed by 650 people as to his courage in the San Rafael disaster. The wreck location was not precisely known until December 14, 1901, when it was reached by a diver. Salvage efforts were begun but abandoned. In the course of these operations, the wreck was dragged along the bottom, but the precise final location was not recorded. Twenty years later, in July, 1921, the anchor line of the liner Matsonia became entangled with the wreckage of the machinery, requiring the assistance of two tugs to free the ship. Legal action against the North Pacific Coast Railway Company led to judgments against the company for negligence.The San Rafael, 141 Fed. Reporter 270 (9th Cir. 1906).

The IOC also provides financial assistance to persons and organizations in fields related to Aviation and other technology industries. History In the South Pacific theater, in the early days of World War II, a United States Army Air Forces flight surgeon, Captain James E. Crane, organized a group of American and Allied pilots under his care into a fraternal order that came to be called the International Order of Characters. At their induction into the order, each member received a private nickname known only to the other members. The private nicknames soon became public call-signs for the aviators as they recovered and returned to the war. By 1943, the IOC had grown to nearly one thousand members, but activity in the order stopped when Crane was reassigned to the United States. In the early 1950s, Dr. Crane, then a flight examiner for the Federal Aviation Administration, reactivated the IOC at the urging of former members. The reborn IOC became an education foundation that provided scholarships and grants to children of deceased or disabled pilots as well as to former members of the armed forces who studied for a degree in aviation- related fields of research. Publications The order publishes the IOC Memorial Log commemorating those friends, family, or IOC members that have died. The Memorial Log is presented at every meeting of the IOC. Conferences The IOC typically hosts two meeting a year‚Äîan aviation symposium in the spring and a meeting in the fall. These events have been held at locations throughout the world. Awards During its annual meetings, the IOC recognizes aviation personalities and aviation achievement with the following trophies. The IOC trophies are awarded on the basis of achievement in aviation, aerospace and associated fields of activity. Recipients are not required to be IOC members.

With a peak rising to above sea level, it is the highest point in Southern Jutland. The bank of the hill is long and was created during the ice age with clay pushed up the Little Belt Strait from a nearby glacier. Several major historic public meetings took place here during and after the disputes over the territory of Schleswig-Holstein. When peace returned, there was an exchange of territories between the kingdom and the Duchy of Southern Jutland. As a result, eight non-Jutland parishes in the northern part of Tyrstrup Herred, including Vejstrup Parish, were transferred to the kingdom and Skamlingsbanken thereafter fell within the borders of Denmark.  Geology  Skamlingsbanken is a lateral moraine formed at the beginning of the Wisconsin glaciation period, approximately 22,000-25,000 years ago, although other glaciers came through later from the east and south, forming Skamlingsbanken and the large hills and rugged terrain south of Kolding.The source is from a permanent exhibition, on Skamlingsbanken From H√∏jskamling the landscape falls steeply eastwards and ends up in a cove at Mosvig. To the west, the landscape drops to a level height of around above sea level and continues all the way to the Jutland ridgeway.  Flora  The area has been covered in largely beech forest for centuries, leading to the development of a rich flora. Botanically similar to South Jutland, common plants in the area between Skamlingsbanken and Gr√∏nninghoved include wax hat, low thistle and hawthorn. As a result of cattle grazing, growth on the lower part of the hill is kept in check but the top grows wild. Some areas are left to nature allowing blackthorn, hawthorn, roses, elder and other scrub growth to flourish, while others areas are maintained in order to preserve the fragile natural grasslands. The whole area is protected by the Danish Nature Conservation Act.  History  Drawing of the memorial on H√∏jskamling at Skamlingsbanken. During the 16th century, Skamlingsbanken belonged to Frederick II of Denmark as part of his hunting ground, which stretched all the way to Vejle. The area remained under crown ownership for many years, but in 1764 the monarch began to sell various areas. One area, Gr√∏nninghoved Strandskov, remained under crown ownership and is currently state forest. Over many centuries, cultural historical sites such as mounds, depressions and dykes have developed in the wild forest. After the crisis in 19th-century Schleswig-Holstein, a desire to retain and strengthen the Danish spirit and the Danish language in South Jutland arose.Border Unions homepage. Article about Skamlingsbanken. Danish language A meeting in St√¶ndersalen, Rendsburg in December 1842, caused a great stir when grocer from Haderslev, then , Lilholt and Posselt from K√∏benhoved, spoke Danish. The Germans regarded this as an insult, while Danish-minded Schleswigers saw it as a patriotic victory to be celebrated.Border Unions homepage. South Jutland's history. Danish language This resulted in a celebration held on 21 February 1843 at an inn in where farmer gave a speech and ended with the words; \\"Like our ancestors, we empty a cup of oath. We will not promise so much, that we will turn our backs to German officials, who speak German to us, nor that we within three years will hunt Duke of Nordalbingia out of the country, but we will promise and keep - within three years to gather to feast again.\\"Booklet made in 1934 by V. Sch√¶ffer as a tourist guide. With sources from P. Eliassen og Harald schr√∏der. Whereupon shouted, \\"We will meet within three months.\\" He went on to explain that the patriotic men of his district had decided to celebrate on 14 May, to commemorate the royal decree introducing the Danish language in a number of public offices. They chose Skamlingsbanken where they had secured a place to gather. The surprised and enthusiastic participants immediately created a committee which would collect the 440 silver Thaler required to purchase the hill, which was raised within a few weeks. Skamlingsbanken then officially came under the association's ownership in 1854, following confirmation by the king's signature.  The language meetings  The first meeting at Skamlingsbanken, 18 May 1843 A number of other languages meetings then followed, which later evolved into folk festivals and national meetings. The first was held on 18 May 1843 instead of 14 May, since this was a Sunday and would have conflicted with the holiday law. Beginning at sunrise the participants hoisted the Dannebrog, a huge split flag 12 Ell long and 6 ell wide (). At 11 o'clock H√∏jskamling was inaugurated and Laurids Skau became the first speaker. Drewsen spoke next and handed over a silver drinking horn to P. Hiort Lorenzen. It was made of Danish silver pieces and bore the inscription, \\"He spoke Danish, and continued to speak Danish.\\" Later on, the H√∏jskamlings banner was consecrated, with a speech by teacher A. C. Abbey from Moltrup and the rest of the day continued with songs, music, disc shooting and dancing. The celebrations ended at nightfall with bonfires and singing. The second meeting on 4 July 1844 was a protest meeting over the King's degradation of the Danish language's influence in the charter of 29 March 1844. This meeting had native language conservation as its key theme which applied to all of the Nordic countries. The previous evening, a steamer with 120 citizens from Copenhagen arrived, including N. F. S. Grundtvig, Orla Lehmann, and Me√Ør Aron Goldschmidt. The huge party began at sunrise with hoisting of the flag accompanied by cannon salutes. Then, after Kaj Hansen from had welcomed everyone, Laurids Skau made a speech. Carl Ploug was in the audience and it is probably this speech he refers to when he later writes about the peasant who says: > ... from South Jutland High, > thousands listened, staring > as scintillating starlight thoughts flew, > as words rattled like swords. The next speaker was N. F. S. Grundtvig, who ended his speech with a prophecy: > Northern Schleswig-Holstein inhabitants continued to speak Danish, it must > be after centuries of history, the main abstracts of your giant story. Hiort Lorenzen then walked on to the podium, to talk about the United States Declaration of Independence as he had chosen 4 July as the date for this Skamlingsbanken Meeting. Orla Lehmann followed on and promised the inhabitants of South Jutland to stand with them through thick and thin. Professor C. Paulsen then spoke, saying, \\"a people are only lost when it denies itself self.\\" After lunch, Carl Ploug addressed the meeting claiming that North Schleswig had the backing not only of the Danish people but the whole of Scandinavia. Kloster, a teacher from also took the podium and after him came Me√Ør Aron Goldschmidt, editor of The Corsair. who said: > I am your brother. Here is my hand. May it write for you? can it hit for > you? So command! This celebration ended with a giant bonfire consisting of three or four trees and some tar barrels. The third meeting was also a protest meeting. On 18 July 1845 it drew 8,000 people with a large contingent from Norway and Sweden. Among the speakers was Laurids Skau, Steen Steensen Blicher and , whose speech was suppressed by censors in Denmark, but was reported in Swedish magazines. The fourth meeting opened with a mood of happy expectation, since an open royal letter dated 8 July 1846, laid out Denmark's claim to the whole of Schleswig. Carl Ploug spoke at this meeting and once again the speech was censored. On 28 June 1847, the fifth meeting took place when Laurids Skau was pleased to report on the establishment of a Danish teacher training college and that the German high school in Haderslev, would henceforth teach in Danish. Master Helweg from the folk high school in R√∏dding then took the podium and pupils from the entire school sang. There were almost as many people present as there had been at the 1844 protest meeting. This proved to be the last language festival due to the start of the First Schleswig War.  Other meetings  During the 1850s a number of folk festivals took place, with the first in 1851 and the last in 1859. However, these saw fewer participants, because the main theme of the Danish language had declined in importance. Several language charters had been introduced during this period, while Danish had also become the language of schools in some parts of south Jutland. People continued to hold meetings and parties at Skamlingsbanken on different occasions and a small cafe was built in 1868 to accommodate the numerous visitors.Municipal Koldings homepage. Article about Skamlingsbanken In 1883, a large meeting of Nordic folk high school principals and high school teachers took place and in the years around 1900 many people celebrated with lectures on Midsummer day. On 4 June 1906 the poet Bj√∏rnstjerne Bj√∏rnson spoke in front of 10,000 people at H√∏jskamling saying: > I have often seen that the circle of vision, was edged by high mountains and > the sea, but I have never before seen thousands of people to the edges. Following World War I and before the official 1920 reunification of Denmark and Schleswig, a great country reunion party was held on Sunday 13 July 1919. All the choirs in Denmark showed up at the event which attracted up to 15,000 visitors. Magister Viggo Bierring first welcomed everybody, then Professor Ellinger celebrated the fallen of the war, whereupon everyone stood up and bared their heads while the royal conductor Georg H√∏eberg performed Jutland between two seas. Later, his brother, royal chamber singer Albert H√∏eberg, sang From distant countries came Queen Dagmar. The Danish atmosphere was maintained by Tenna Frederiksen, who sang I went out one summer's day and Drachmanns song about the girls of South Jutland. There was huge applause when the South Jutland choir under the photographer Gaasvig, sang several different songs from the local countryside. Despite several showers of rain throughout the day, the festival ended in high spirits with all attendees singing King of Kings. The event was subsequently held several more times, but none surpassed this festivity. One week after the reunion celebration, Danish youth associations held their annual rally on Skamlingsbanken where Jacob Appel Kloppenborg-Skrumsager and Bishop Ludwig discussed church affairs. The Danish Mission Society held their annual mission meeting in subsequent years at Skamlingsbanken on Danish Constitution Day. The Young Border Guard, founded in 1934, chose to hold their first annual meeting at Skamlingsbanken, which broke all visitor records. In addition to those carrying the 25,000 passes issued, another 5-10,000 people turned up without one. Extra trains, each with 15 carriages, were laid on to cope with the large gathering of people while additional steamers operated at full speed. The day began with a rendition of Kongesangen, with everyone standing, then later Der er et yndigt land was sung and everyone bared their head. The annual meeting was opened by Skamlingsbanken Company President, O. Juhl and conducted by director Hammerich T√∏nder. Danish people from across Jutland joined in a circle to sing under the direction of Professor Ottosen Haderslev. After a speech from the president of the border guard union, teacher Peter Marcussen from T√∏nder, joined H. P. Hansen at the podium and received long applause. He talked about the past history of Skamlingsbanken meetings and quoted Laurids Skau's words; > It is lions, and not monkeys that are jumping to take up Danish arms. He continued saying: > When I was 14 years old, I stood here and listened, and then followed the > family that took the sinking flag, before it was too late. After a speech by Professor Lauritz Weibull from Lund, Norwegian Ronald Fagen spoke in favour of genuine Scandinavism. Gunnar Gunnarsson emphasized that the idea of a Nordic border defense and \\"it will be Icelands greeting today.\\" Moderator J. Kronika expressed his opinion thus, \\"We should today unite as in the promise of 1845 on unbreakable foster-brotherhood of assertiveness by Danish law to the ultimate benefit of the northern peoples.\\" In the evening, men of the Young Border Defence sang their battle song, which was written by librarian Carl Dumreicher. Later there were other speakers including the teacher Inger Enemark, priest Birger T√∏nnesen from Oslo, and attorney Karling from Malmo. The evening ended with a bonfire and a speech by Professor William Andersen: > Here at Skamling the sea, sky and earth meet. Here all estates and tribes > met each other. Here ends the family chain.... The largest meeting to date was held on 24 June 1945, to celebrate the end of the Second World War, which drew up to 100,000 participants. A number of prominent individuals and officials have all made speeches at Skamlingsbanken, including N. F. S. Grundtvig, Laurids Skau, Orla Lehmann and Anders Fogh Rasmussen.  Memorials  There is a tall memorial column dedicated to 18 people who have contributed to the Danish cause in Schleswig-Holstein on Skamlingsbanken's highest point, the H√∏jskamling. Made of 25 granite blocks, the column was raised in 1863, although the idea was conceived in the autumn of 1845 when Staal suggested at a general meeting of millers that each of its members should donate a stone for a large granite column. The idea was shelved until the early 1850s, when a memorial committee was formed to raise money for a memorial to General B√ºlow in Fredericia. The committee collected 9,000 thaler, and there was much money left over. Among other things, these funds were used for the 25 blocks, the Flensburg Lion, the monument at Kolding church and various gravestones. After some debate, 18 names were selected and the design for the memorial completed by architect, Professor F. Meldahl. In the late summer of 1863, the stones, quarried at Str√∏mstad and provided by the widow of quarry-owner Kullgren of Uddevalla, arrived. The residents of Tyrstrup Herred volunteered 104 horses for transportation to the site, and the last stone arrived at the site on 10 October. Stonemason Kleving immediately began work on the monument which subsequently only stood for five months before its destruction on 21 March 1864 by occupying Prussian forces during the 2nd Schleswig War. The Prussians had difficulty destroying the monument, and after several unsuccessful attempts forced a local stonemason to drill blasting holes into the stone. By the evening of that day the Prussians set off a large mine, which caused the pillar to fall in a southeasterly direction. On 16 April, the stones were sold at auction. Local farm owner Raaben had two locals buy the stones, thus keeping the Prussians in the dark. These were dragged into hiding in neighboring fields. After the war, the stones were recovered, and in May 1864, the pillar was raised again. Personal names appearing on the memorial: * (1744-1812) * A.G. Fabricius (d. 1804) * (1809-1871) * (1792-1875) * (1791-1845) * Thomas Hoyer Jensen (1771-1839) * Claus Jaspersen (1777-1847) * (1807-1880) * (1816-1881) * (1794-1860) * (1795-1877) * (1788-1857) * C.H.

Restaurant Skamlingsbankens homepage. Danish language At a midsummer meeting in 1902, it was decided to create this podium and by 24 June 1903, it was ready for inauguration. Around the podium stand five groups of trees, symbolizing that the five Nordic countries are inseparable. The trees are: Beech for Denmark birch for Sweden Spruce for Norway, a tree for Finland and Rowan for Iceland. The lectern and the 4 memorials, 2020 There are other memorials in the area around Skamlingsbanken, four of which are located about from the column commemorating Pastor M. M√∏rk. Hansen, Peter Skau, N. F. S. Grundtvig and C. Flor. During a rally in 1883 for the Nordic folk high school principals and high school teachers, the idea of raising a memorial to Grundtvig arose. This subsequently happened at a private party on 4 July 1884, the 40th anniversary of Grundtvigs keynote speech at the site. At the behest of the South Jutland Central Association, a memorial was raised for C. Flor on 14 July 1912. View from Skamlingsbanken towards east, with 2008 A little further away in the woods stand two other memorials. The one dedicated to Laurids Skau, inaugurated on 18 May 1883, the 50th anniversary of the first Skamlingsbanken Meeting, bears a verse by Grundtvig: > The word sounded like thunder, rolling over the forest, > difficulty and thunderbolt, tossed gloss' of waves, > lit bonfires in the giant's arms, lighted Skamlingsbankens beacon > with the clear flames At the location where the Board of Skamlingsbanken pitched their tent at meetings, a memorial to Regenburg was raised on 2 September 1898.

The characters were created by Bill Lawrence and Kevin Biegel. It focuses on a recently divorced woman who reenters the dating world while living with her 17-year-old son and still being constantly pestered by her slacker ex-husband. A pilot episode of the show was broadcast after Modern Family on September 23, 2009. The series featured seven main cast members: a 40-year-old mother who's newly single Jules Cobb (Courteney Cox); Ellie Torres (Christa Miller) as Jules' next door neighbor and best friend; Laurie Keller (Busy Philipps), Jules' young assistant; Bobby Cobb (Brian Van Holt), Jules' unemployed ex- husband; Travis Cobb (Dan Byrd), Jules' 17-year-old son; Andy Torres (Ian Gomez), Ellie's husband; and Grayson Ellis (Josh Hopkins), Jules' newly divorced neighbor.  Main characters = Julia \\"Jules\\" Kiki Cobb-Ellis Courteney Cox plays Jules Cobb, born November 15, 1968, a recently divorced single mother exploring the honest truths about dating and aging. Jules resides in a small town in Florida and is a real estate agent who is successful in business. Though she has been out of the dating world for a while, Jules decides to find love again. She starts dating Josh, a 28-year-old in the beginning of season 1. However, she breaks up with him after he tells her he's in love with her, and she realizes she does not reciprocate those feelings. She meets her next boyfriend, Jeff while trying to sell a house to him and they date for a while until she realizes that they want different things: Jeff is looking for a long-term relationship, while Jules is not. After her break-up with Jeff, Jules sleeps with Bobby but rejects his offer to reunite romantically. Jules tells him that she does not love him like that anymore after their divorce. Jules also has an incredibly close relationship with her high school (and later college) aged son, Travis, whom she had with her ex-husband Bobby. The rest of the group finds her relationship with Travis somewhat scary and it has even been mentioned by Jules herself that professionals have deemed it 'unhealthy'. Jules and her neighbor, Grayson are attracted to each other, their friendship is innocent and flirty until the episode \\"Letting You Go\\" when they kiss and sleep together. In the next episode, Grayson and Jules explore the idea of friends with benefits, but they both realize that they want more and start secretly dating. In the Season 1 finale, they reveal the fact that they are dating to everyone, including Bobby‚Äîwho is upset initially but learns to accept their relationship. Jules and Grayson get engaged at the beginning of Season 3 and are later married on the beach at the end of the season. Jules also has a close relationship with her widower father, Chick. Relationships Ellie Torres Ellie Torres is Jules' neighbor and best friend. They have coffee together every morning and drink wine throughout the day. Jules values Ellie's opinions above everyone else's. Laurie Keller Laurie Keller is Jules' colleague and close friend. Laurie is relatively younger than Jules and usually is the ‚Äúgo to‚Äù friend whenever Ellie disapproves. Laurie competes with Ellie for Jules‚Äô attention. While Jules thinks of Laurie as a friend Laurie thinks a Jules as a mother figure. Laurie also takes part in excessive drinking like all of the gang. Grayson Ellis Grayson Ellis is Jules' neighbor, love interest and subsequent husband. Like Jules Grayson got divorced and starts dating younger partners. He becomes friends with Jules and after a series of flirting between the two he eventually falls for her. He is usually the one to calm Jules when she overreacts. Travis Cobb ''' Travis Cobb is Jules‚Äô son with Bobby Cobb, next to Ellie Jules considers Travis to be her next best friend. Jules is very protective of Travis and interferes in every aspect of his life which sometimes seems very inappropriate. Bobby Cobb Bobby Cobb is Jules ex-husband. She supported him after the divorce for a number of years until he resisted. Despite being divorced she still considers Bobby to be one of her best friends. Elisabeth \\"Ellie\\" Torres Christa Miller plays Ellie Torres, Jules' next door neighbor and best friend. Ellie is married to Andy Torres, and the two have a son, Stan. She is the sarcastic, unapologetic confidante who is often jealous of Jules' young assistant and friend, Laurie. The two have an outwardly spiteful relationship, in which they constantly exchange verbal jabs and insults; however, several episodes reveal that she has a soft spot for Laurie, whom she refers to as \\"jellybean.\\" Ellie and Jules have been friends for many years and know all of each other's embarrassing secrets and stories. Ellie quit her job as a lawyer to stay home with Stan, though enjoys a copious amount of freedom since Andy hired a nanny for her as a surprise. Ellie's marriage to Andy is a happy one: she enjoys being the queen of the household, bossing Andy and the nanny around, and spending Andy's money. Andy, in turn, absolutely adores Ellie, and she often uses this to her advantage. She has also shown attraction towards other men, including Bobby and Grayson. However, she has admitted that she loves Andy \\"so much\\" that if something happened to him, she would not know what to do. Ellie loves to gossip and make judgmental comments about others, which makes her seem mean; however, she is also fiercely loyal to her friends. The smartest and most grounded of the characters, she frequently finds she has to be the \\"adult\\" of the group, much to her annoyance. Her birthday is on Valentine's Day. Laurie Keller Busy Philipps plays Laurie Keller, Jules' younger employee. Laurie works with Jules in the same real estate office as her assistant. Laurie often encourages Jules to get out and have fun and tries to reacquaint her to the world of dating. She considers herself Jules' best friend, although Jules' actual best friend is Ellie. Laurie spent much of her youth in and out of foster homes, and early in the series she is struggling to live life as a functional adult. She sees Jules as a mentor in some ways, frequently asking her for help and advice. Laurie is known for her fun-loving, unashamedly wild personality, frequently engaging in and bragging about her one-night stands and hookups. Late in season 1, Laurie dates a rich young law student named Smith Frank. When Smith leaves to return to school, Grayson tries to cheer her up and the two end up having sex. The next morning, they both agree to keep it a secret from the rest of the group. After Jules and Grayson start dating, the secret emerges and deeply upsets Jules; however, she eventually forgives Grayson because they were not in a relationship at the time and Laurie because the bad breakup with Smith moves her to pity. Laurie's flirty relationship with Jules' son Travis, who is several years her junior, is another concept often revisited by the group. Travis has stronger feelings for Laurie than she does for him, which she finds entertaining and flattering. In the season 2 finale, Laurie manipulates Travis' feelings for her to convince him to return to Florida after he runs away to Hawaii. During season 3, Travis tries to pull away from Laurie, stating that it is difficult for him to be around her when he has such strong feelings for her, knowing she probably will never feel the same way. However, after an embarrassing scene in the season 3 finale, Laurie begins to see Travis in a more romantic way. She eventually realizes she has feelings towards Travis near the end of the fourth season, and she reveals this to him. The two share their first kiss in the season finale. As of season 5, they are officially a couple. In the season 5 finale, Laurie gives Jules some of her urine to use for a physical, as Jules had happy pills in her system at the time, and it was revealed that she is pregnant with Travis's child. Robert \\"Bobby\\" Cobb Brian Van Holt plays Bobby Cobb, Jules' ex-husband. Bobby is a classic under-achiever who'll test Jules' patience as they attempt to raise their son, Travis. He spent most of their marriage touring as a semi-pro golfer and cheated on her several times, leading to their divorce. After the divorce, he spent his time as a golf instructor and grass-cutter at Travis' high school, while hanging out with his best friend, Andy. During this time, he lived on a grounded houseboat and drove a well-worn golf cart for transportation. He also invented the game 'Penny Can' which becomes very popular, first among the group but later among a wide variety of people after Roger Frank (the father of Laurie's ex-boyfriend) purchases it for his company. Throughout the series, he has been shown to not have as many relationships as he'd like. Some of his flings included Jules' dermatologist, Travis's photography teacher, and a woman named Sam, all of which ended in disaster. He is dating a tom-boyish redhead named Lisa Riggs. He also owns a Brindle Mastif named Dog Travis or 'DT' for short. During the last season, Bobby is rarely seen, as he was encouraged by Andy to take a well-paying golf pro job in Georgia. He is of Irish, Dutch, and Scottish descent. Travis Cobb Dan Byrd plays Travis Cobb, is Jules' high-school (and later, college) aged son. He loves both of his parents although is constantly embarrassed by both of them. At school, he constantly deals with humiliation from his friends and classmates. He is generally supportive of his mother, but feels that her dating exploits cause him embarrassment. After dealing with his mom's real estate ads around town and his dad's new job as his school's lawn mower, his father helps him realize not to worry about what other people think. Travis dates Kylie, his high school girlfriend, during season 1 and loses his virginity to her. In season 2, Travis leaves for college and has an open long- distance relationship with Kylie, but he later realizes that he is dissatisfied by this because of her many other male companions. He tries to break up with her and fails when she rejects his breakup, saying \\"I like telling people that I have a college boyfriend.\\" Later in season 2, Travis begins dating an older girl, a grad student named Kirsten whom Jules is initially threatened by. Later, the relationship becomes more serious, but Kirsten receives a job offer in Chicago. Travis proposes to Kirsten so that she will stay and continue dating him, but her rejection of his proposal leads to their separation. Travis then sinks into a deep depression, in which he drops out of college and moves onto Bobby's boat. He then runs away to Hawaii, until the whole gang brings him back. In season 3, Travis re-enrolls in college, where he spends times with his friends, Kevin and Sig. Throughout the whole series, Travis and Laurie are shown to have this flirty relationship. He seems to have a crush on her whenever he's not with someone. However, after being embarrassingly rejected time after time he begins sleeping with random girls, and has a 'skank parade'. Laurie at this point is with Wade, her online soldier boyfriend who has just returned from Afghanistan, and she is outraged at Travis' behavior. Seeing this, Wade breaks up with her, and she soon begins to reveal that she does have feelings for Travis. She tells him, and after he once again confesses his feelings, they go on their first date.  Andy Torres Ian Gomez plays Andy Torres, Ellie's Cuban-American husband who is also Jules's next door neighbor. Andy is a devoted husband to Ellie and also a loving father to their son, Stan. Although he is of Latino descent, he never bothered to learn Spanish, unlike Jules, Ellie and Laurie, who speak it fluently. He loves coffee and displays deep loyalty and hero worship for Jules' ex-husband, Bobby, his best friend before and after the divorce. Andy is a business mogul and corporate hotshot at his job, but a childlike sweetheart with family and friends. His common catchphrase is \\"Come onnnnnnnn!\\" which is often his response when Ellie forbids him from doing something he wants to do, or when the others play jokes on him. During season 3, Andy expresses an interest in running for mayor and campaigns against Roger Frank, the father of Laurie's ex-boyfriend, Smith. In Season 4, he learns several weeks late that he won the election and actually is the mayor of the town. Because the position has little or no authority, no one bothered to tell him about it. Grayson Ellis Josh Hopkins plays Grayson Ellis, Jules' neighbor. He owns and operates Gray's Pub, a frequent hangout for the gang. Grayson, like Jules, is also newly divorced, but unlike Jules, he embraces his bachelorhood and single lifestyle. Grayson enjoys dating and sleeping with younger women, often rubbing it in Jules' face. Yet he is still tethered by the fact that his ex-wife, Vivian, left him because he wanted kids and she claimed that she did not; however, it is later revealed that she got engaged to another man and is pregnant‚Äîa crushing blow for Grayson. He is shown to be very vain, often looking at himself in the mirror and reminiscing about his time as a male model. Ellie refers to him as 'Dime Eyes', mentioning constantly that he has small, beady eyes. Despite this, Ellie and Grayson have a good friendship. Ellie has also been shown to be attracted to him. After a flirty friendship with Jules, Grayson's feelings for her emerge while he is dating Sara (played by Sheryl Crow). He unintentionally revealed his interest in Jules to Bobby and Andy at Thanksgiving. After dating and falling in love with Jules, Grayson proposes to her in the season 3 premiere.

Wright, Muriel H. \\"Some Geographic Names of French Origin in Oklahoma.\\" Chronicles of Oklahoma Volume7, Number 2. June, 1929. Accessed March 28, 2016. History Humans have inhabited the area since prehistoric times. According to the Encyclopedia of Oklahoma History and Culture, the earliest inhabitants were Hunter-Gatherers and Foragers, from about 10,000 to 8,000 B.C.E. Later indigenous people began farming about 1 B.C.E. along streams with suitable topography. Tribes of the Wichita Confederation moved in and established large villages during the Historic Era. The Choctaws, forced to leave their previous homeland in the Southeastern U. S., started displacing other tribes about 1830. During the 19th Century, this area became an important source for timber. Later in the century, production of coal and natural gas became economic mainstays, continuing into the 20th Century. Geography The highest peaks of the Sans Bois Mountains are above sea level. Robbers Cave State Park is in the middle of the mountains. The Poteau River drains the area, and one of its tributaries, Sans Bois Creek, was the namesake for the mountains. Although the mountains have relatively light forests, they do have deposits of coal and natural gas, which provided the basis for economic development in the late 19th and early 20th Centuries.

The organization was formed in 1981, with the goal of addressing the needs of women's basketball coaches. The mission of the WBCA is: The WBCA provides education for coaches, and promotes the coaching profession with awards for coaches and players. While many of the awards are related to basketball activities, the WBCA recognizes the need for academic as well as athletic excellence and recognizes academic excellence with their Academic Top 25 Team Honor Roll. History An organizational meeting was held at the Olympic Festival in Syracuse, N.Y. in 1981. Jill Hutchison was named the first president of the organization, before the organization even had a name. Later that year, Betty Jaynes was named the interim executive director of the organization. Jaynes was the head coach of the James Madison University women's basketball team, but she resigned her position to take on the responsibilities of the WBCA. She would serve as the Chief Executive Officer until retiring in November 2000, turning over the position to Beth Bass. Bass joined the organization as Executive Director in 1997, and assumed the role of CEO after the retirement of Jaynes, who continues to serve as a consultant to the WBCA. Membership The membership is open to virtually all, including institutions. The main membership category is \\"active\\" comprising the coaching staff of NCAA Divisions I, II, and III, as well as NAIA, USCAA, junior college and community college coaches. In addition, there are membership categories for high school, AAU and recreational league coaches, as well as coaches on professional teams. Institutions are allowed to become members. Finally, there are affiliate categories for \\"administrators\\", \\"industry professionals\\" (including media), players, and \\"fans\\" (including anyone who is a friend of women's basketball). An \\"international\\" membership category is available for individuals, regardless of category, living outside the U.S. and its territories. All members are eligible to attend the WBCA's annual convention except for high school and college players. The WBCA membership is considerably broader than that of the WBCA's men's counterpart, the National Association of Basketball Coaches: * Coaches at professional teams are ineligible for any level of NABC membership unless they have spent enough years as active members in college basketball to be eligible for \\"associate\\" membership. * The \\"active\\" NABC membership consists solely of head coaches and full-time assistants at NCAA and NAIA institutions. * Coaches at four-year institutions not affiliated with the NCAA or NAIA are ineligible for NABC membership at any level. By contrast, active WBCA membership is open even to coaches at four-year institutions unaffiliated with any national association. * Men's coaches at two-year schools are in the NABC's third-tier category of \\"activity\\" membership. By contrast, women's coaches at the same type of schools are eligible for active WBCA membership. * The NABC only offers fourth-level \\"affiliate\\" membership to directors of basketball operations, and only if they work at four-year institutions. The WBCA considers individuals in the same role at women's basketball programs eligible for active membership, and also extends this privilege to those holding the position at two-year institutions. * While certain administrators in men's basketball are eligible for \\"affiliate\\" NABC membership, eligibility is far more restrictive than the WBCA \\"administrator\\" category. * The NABC does not offer any level of membership to institutions, players, or fans. Events and initiatives The WBCA sponsors a variety of events throughout the year. The major event is the annual convention, coinciding both in timing and location with the Final Four weekend of the NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship. Other sponsored events occur throughout the year, some in conjunction with the annual convention, others at different times. Convention The main function of the convention is for business meetings, such as Board of Directors meetings, and other administrative meetings. The program also typically includes panel presentations including members and outside speakers, workshops, awards and outside exhibitors. WBCA High School All-America Game The WBCA formerly sponsored an All America game, inviting twenty of the nation's top high school female basketball players. Only seniors in high school were eligible. In addition to the twenty players invited to play in the game, an additional twenty players are named as Honorable Mention All-Americans. The invited players are divided into two teams, and played an all star game in the same city as the Final Four (although sometimes at a different venue). The game was typically scheduled for the off day between the semifinals and championship game of the NCAA Division I Women's Basketball Tournament. So You Want To Be A Coach The WBCA sponsors a program aimed at ethnically minority female basketball players who show an interest in becoming coaches. The program is organized in parallel with the annual convention, at the same locations, and includes a \\"two and a half day crash course in what the coaching profession entails\\". Supporters of the program include some of the major names in the sport such as Hall of Fame coach C. Vivian Stringer WBCA Pink Zone The major charitable initiative of the WBCA encourages coaches to raise awareness of breast cancer in various ways. Each year, a number of women's basketball games are designed Pink Zone games. One or both of the teams wear pink uniforms. The event is usually coupled with a money raising effort; the proceeds are dedicated to the Kay Yow/WBCA Cancer Fund, in partnership with The V Foundation. The NCAA participates with their \\"Calling for a Cure\\" campaign. As part of that campaign, the referees in NCAA women's basketball games use pink whistles during the designated Pink Zone dates. Awards The WBCA sponsors a number of awards, with the intention to promote the development of the game. Awards are given for overall achievements by players and coaches, as well as broadcasters, administration, and academic results. Players awardsPlayer of the Year Awards= Brittney Griner accepting Wade Trophy The State Farm Wade Trophy is awarded annually to \\"the best women's college basketball player in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I\\".

The award is named for former women's head coach Carol Eckman, a head coach best known for establishing the first National Invitational Women's Intercollegiate Basketball Tournament in 1969. In the 2015-16 season, the WBCA announced a new award recognizing the young coaches in the sport. This recognition was created to honor thirty of the up-and-coming women's basketball coaches age 30 and under in the sport at all levels of the game.‚Ä≥ Academic Awards The WBCA recognizes the need for academic as well as athletic excellence, and promotes academic excellence with its Academic Top 25 Team Honor Roll, recognizing the top 25 teams, as measured by overall GPA, in each of five divisions: # NCAA Division I # NCAA Division II # NCAA Division III # NAIA # JC/CC (Junior College/Community College) Media Awards The WBCA presents an annual scholarship award, The Robin Roberts/WBCA Broadcasting Scholarship, to a female basketball player intending to pursue graduate work and a career in sports journalism.

The full title is The Godly Man's Picture Drawn with a Scripture Pencil, or, Some Characteristic Marks of a Man who is Going to Heaven. The book is a work of English Puritan spirituality.  Purpose  The book's purpose, according to Watson, is to describe a godly person, \\"in his full lineaments... that all into whose hands this book may providentially come, may be so enamoured with piety as to embrace it heartily.\\"  Structure  The book follows a strict outline format and progressive logic, with many points made through the asking of a question, a series of in-depth answers, and several applications to be drawn from the answers. The book's heavy emphasis on application is typical of Puritan writing. The book is systematically partitioned into twelve sections and thirty subsections, with the majority of the book (169 pages) contained within the twenty-four subsections of section 4: Showing the Characteristics of a Godly Man. The sections and subsections are as follows: 1\\\\. ‚ÄòFor this shall every one that is godly pray unto thee‚Äô (Psa. 32:6) 2\\\\. Expounding the Nature of Godliness 3\\\\.

Showing the Mystic Union between Christ and the Saints  Themes = Religion as Relationship  The Puritan understanding of godliness as fundamentally relational rather than propositional runs throughout the book. Instead of being a godly Christian by what one believes about Jesus Christ in an epistemological sense, Watson describes the godly as relating to Jesus as a bridegroom to a bride. Using strongly romantic language from the Song of Solomon and other parts of the Bible, Watson speaks of \\"a conjugal union between Christ and believers\\" (239). He further states that \\"the joy that flows from the mystic union is unspeakable and full of glory\\" (241).  Radical Selflessness  A radically selfless notion of Christianity emerges in the book, wherein the believer ought to love and serve God not because of benefits from God, but because the inherent worth of God. This idea ties in with the idea of religion as relationship. As Watson puts it, \\"God is to be loved more than his mercies\\" (132).  Quotes  Watson's writing is known for its quotability due to its succession of compact but meaning-filled statements reiterating and refining key points. Some of the key quotes are as follows: *\\"A natural man‚Ä¶ may have the eye of reason open, but he does not discern the things of God in a spiritual manner‚Ä¶ he is no more able to judge sacred things than a blind man is able to judge colors\\" (20). *\\"The ship of ordinances will not carry us to heaven‚Ä¶ unless the wind of God‚Äôs Spirit blows\\" (76). *\\"God must anoint our eyes before we can see‚Ä¶ we may have excellent notion in divinity, but the Holy Spirit must enable us to know them in a spiritual manner\\" (27). *\\"Divine sorrow is excellent‚Ä¶ Repenting tears are precious God puts them in his bottle\\" (58). *\\"Sin makes up the major part of the Christian. There are more dregs than spirit in the best heart\\" (234).  References = Bibliography  * Watson, Thomas. The Godly Man's Picture. East Peoria, IL: Banner of Truth and Versa Press, Inc., 1992.

In 1852 he bought the mill, while in the same year James Wilson, the Whig Member of Parliament for Westbury, and his brother William bought Bitham Mill in the same town. In 1856, the Wilson brothers sold their mill to Laverton. For part of the middle of the 19th century he also owned Boyer's Mill, Westbury.

The Institute included a room for a school which already existed, the Westbury Boys' British School, which moved in 1874 and remained at the Laverton Institute until 1925, when it was merged into what is now Matravers School, having changed its name to the Westbury Laverton Institute School in 1907.\\"Westbury: Schools\\", in A History of the County of Wiltshire: Volume 8, Warminster, Westbury and Whorwellsdown Hundreds (Victoria County History, London, 1965), pp 188-191 In 1884, Laverton also built a new school in Bratton Road, near his Institute, and presented it to the town. This opened its doors in 1885 and was known as the Laverton Infants' School, then the Laverton County Infants' School, after being adopted by Wiltshire County Council. In 1958 it moved into premises in the churchyard, the former Church of England Junior School, and in 1968 moved to Eden Vale, becoming the Westbury Infants' School.

Although Phipps was elected, the result was declared void as a result of an election petition brought by Laverton. Mr Justice Willes found that, although Phipps himself was personally innocent of any corrupt practice, his agent, Harrop, had carried out acts of intimidation on voters.Law Times Reports relating to Magistrates, Municipal, Parichial, Ecclesiastical and Election Law, vol.5, 1870 The Judge found that Harrop, who was an agent of Phipps and a manufacturer in Westbury, \\"had told his workmen that no man should remain in his employment who voted for the Petitioner, who was his rival in trade, and that these men or some of them were obliged to leave his employment in consequence of their refusing to abstain from so voting\\".Reports of the Decisions of the Judges for the Trial of Election Petitions, full text online at archive.org A by-election was thus held in 1869, at which Laverton lost by only eleven votes, defeated by his rival's brother, Charles Paul Phipps, standing for the Conservatives.

The dam is composed of 14 buttresses and 13 arches and is 214 km (133 mi) north of Baie-Comeau in Quebec, Canada. The dam was constructed between 1959 and 1970 for the purpose of hydroelectric power production and supplies water to the Manic-5 and Manic-5-PA power houses with a combined capacity of 2,660 MW. The dam is 214 m (702 ft) tall, 1,314 m (4,311 ft) long and contains 2,200,000 m3 (2,900,000 cu yd) of concrete, making it the largest dam of its type in the world. The dam was named after Daniel Johnson, Sr., the 20th Premier of Quebec, who was responsible for starting the project while serving as a minister in Duplessis's government. Johnson died on 26 September 1968, on the day he was to preside over the scheduled inauguration of the dam. The facility is owned and operated by Hydro-Qu√©bec.  Background  A hydrological survey was conducted on the Manicouagan river in 1919. During the summers of 1919 and 1920, hydrological studies were conducted on the Manicouagan and Outardes rivers, flowing into the St. Lawrence near the town of Baie-Comeau. The combined flow was then estimated at 40 million cubic meters, making it one of the largest hydrological systems in Canada. Although harnessing of this potential was considered interesting, its distance from major load centres and the lack of roads in the area were identified as major drawbacks. In addition, building dams in the wilderness was considered too costly. After the Second World War, the discovery of large iron deposits on the North Shore and the increased forestry activity led to a rapid development of the region. The area's largest cities, Sept-√éles and Baie-Comeau, were now linked to the rest of the province by a road. At the same time, industrial development in southern Quebec required a larger electric supply. Improvements in long distance electric transmission technologies were also a consideration at the time. Significant advances in the field, including the construction of two 315-kilovolt lines, between the Bersimis complex, west of the Manicouagan system, and Montreal, (completed in 1956), lifted another obstacle. In 1955, Hydro-Qu√©bec launched a 5-year extensive assessment of the Manicouagan's suitability. These studies demonstrated the exceptional potential of the river and stressed the advantages of building a multi-dam system in order take full advantage of the terrain and water flows. The data collected at the time was so promising that Hydro-Qu√©bec did not wait for the working group to submit their final recommendations. By 1959, a decision was made and construction of a access road from Baie-Comeau was started. The original project, the Manicouagan-Outardes project, included the construction of five dams on the Manicouagan River (Manic-1, Manic-2, Manic-3, Manic-4 and Manic-5) and three on the Outardes River (Outardes-2, Outardes-3 and Outardes-4). However, a miscalculation prevented the construction of the Manic-4 dam and powerhouse because engineers realized early on that it would encroach on the Manic-3 reservoir. In 1959, the Premier of Quebec, Maurice Duplessis, wanted a U.S. firm to construct the dam but Quebec's Minister of Water Resources at the time, Daniel Johnson was against the idea. Johnson believed that the skill of a Canadian firm and workers was well suited for the construction of such a complex dam. Duplessis' successor in 1959, Paul Sauv√© agreed with Johnson and he continued to pave the way for the dam. Eventually, engineers would choose Andr√© Coyne's design for a multiple arch buttress dam as the most suitable and economical.  Construction  Construction on the dam's support facilities began in 1959 and the river diversion tunnels and foundation preparation commenced in 1960. To divert the Manicouagan River, workers blasted and dug two long and diameter tunnels through the gorge's solid granite west wall. Workers used \\"jumbo\\" drilling platforms and the tunnels progressed each shift. To facilitate the river's diversion, two cofferdams were built. The first was a concrete arch upstream from the dam site which would block the river, forcing it into the diversion tunnels. The second cofferdam was downstream and prevented water from flowing back into the construction site. Each cofferdam was built on alluvial deposits (loose soil), so they needed to be watertight, which was accomplished with either a grout curtain or deep supporting piles. Once the river was diverted, workers pumped the remaining water out between the two cofferdams in order to prepare the site for construction. Once drained, workers excavated the alluvial deposits between the cofferdams, creating a long pit that was deep at the center. This pit was then filled with concrete in the summer of 1962. To prevent seepage in the dam's foundation, a grout curtain was injected in the bedrock and a drainage network with of tunnels was constructed just downstream of the dam to collect water that might seep through. After the extensive preparatory works were complete, the first concrete for the dam was poured on October 3, 1962. Concrete was poured day and night, but was halted during the winter because of freezing temperatures. To organize the pouring, the dam was split into plots and each was raised about five or six feet at a time. Workers had about 150 days ‚Äî before seasonal flooding ‚Äî to construct the dam to a height of at least . Before flooding began, engineers planned to seal the diversion tunnels and begin filling the reservoir. To speed the pouring process, concrete was poured in casts by buckets that moved along three cableways suspended above the construction site. The deadline was met within the 150 days and a total of of concrete was poured. The dam was eventually completed in 1968.  Dedication and naming  Original dedication plaque ‚Äî Manicouagan 5, 1968. Dedication plaque of the Daniel Johnson Dam, unveiled by Johnson's successor, Jean-Jacques Bertrand on September 26, 1969. On September 25, 1968, the government-owned utility organized a ceremony to mark the completion of the Manicouagan-5 dam. Hundreds of dignitaries, politicians, utility executives, financiers, engineers and journalists were ferried by plane from Montreal, Quebec City and New York to the work-site to attend a banquet and a plaque unveiling ceremony. Among the guests were Quebec Union Nationale Premier, Daniel Johnson, Sr., his predecessor, Jean Lesage, and Ren√© L√©vesque, the former Hydraulic Resources minister responsible for the consolidation of all investor-owned utilities into Hydro-Qu√©bec. Photographs taken at the banquet show the three men were in excellent spirits, holding hands and smiling, although relations between the Liberal leader and his former cabinet minister were strained by L√©vesque's recent defection to the Mouvement Souverainet√©-Association, a precursor of the Parti Qu√©b√©cois. In his authorized biography, Hydro-Qu√©bec executive, Robert A. Boyd, recalls being woken up at 6 a.m. the next morning by his boss, Roland Giroux. \\"I've got bad news, Robert...\\", said Giroux, adding that he just found the Premier lying dead in his bed. Johnson's sudden demise sent shock waves at the work-site and across the province and the dedication ceremony was quickly canceled. On September 26, 1969, a year to the day after Johnson's death, the new Premier Jean-Jacques Bertrand accompanied by Johnson's widow and children, unveiled two plaques and officially dedicated the dam after his predecessor. Both plaques now sit side by side at the top of the complex.  Facilities = Dam  Detail of an arch of the dam. Red lines were drawn to indicate the presence of small cracks. The design was chosen for strength and economical reasons as it used less concrete or material than a gravity or embankment dam. The Daniel-Johnson dam is a tall and long multiple-arch buttress dam. Of the dam's 14 total buttresses, the two that form the center arch are apart at their base while the others are about apart. At its thickest point, the center, the dam is wide while the crest can reach about wide. Pressure from water behind the dam is transferred from the dam's arches to its buttresses and lastly into the ground or its foundation. The dam was constructed with a high-quality concrete designed to withstand constant thawing and freezing associated with its environment. To further help the structure cope with the climate, engineers placed one-inch steel reinforcing bars within the upstream and downstream faces of the dam. The concrete's strength in compression was initially 4,500 lbs. per square inch to meet an estimated 1,500 PSI within the structure. The upstream face of the dam was also coated in asphalt for protection against water. Despite the strength of the dam's concrete, two parallel inclined cracks were discovered on one of the arches shortly after construction.  Reservoir  The Manicouagan Reservoir has been nicknamed the \\"Eye of Quebec\\". Daniel-Johnson Dam is located towards the bottom of image, beginning of reservoir. The dam impounded the Manicougan River, which filled the Earth's fifth largest confirmed impact crater, the Manicouagan crater, creating Manicouagan Reservoir. Coincidentally, the reservoir itself is the fifth largest in the world as well. The reservoir has a maximum depth of , mean depth of and contains of water. While draining an area of , it has a surface area of and shoreline of . The reservoir is a well known area for Atlantic salmon, lake trout and northern pike fishing, although tall trees flooded during the impoundment have not decomposed due to a lack of oxygen, which can sometimes interfere with the sport. The priming of the reservoir also created a large artificial island in the center of the Manicouagan reservoir by merging two crescent-shaped lakes: Mouchalagane Lake on the western side and Manicouagan Lake on the eastern side. Covering an area of , Ren√©-Levasseur Island is considered to be the second largest island in the world located in a lake, in terms of area (the largest is Manitoulin Island, located within neighboring Ontario's portion of Lake Huron). The island was named after Ren√© Levasseur, the chief engineer responsible for the construction of the Daniel-Johnson dam. Levasseur died at the age of 35, only days before the dam's inauguration.  Powerhouses  The Manic-5 powerhouse (left) and Manic-5-PA exit canal (right), as seen from the crest of the dam. The dam fuels two powerhouses, the Manic-5 and Manic-5-PA. The first powerhouse consists of eight Francis turbines, capable of producing up to of power, which went online in 1970. The second powerhouse, the Manic-5-PA (PA stands for puissance additionnelle or additional power), was commissioned in 1989, and consists of four Francis turbines of in total installed capacity. The designers of the Manic-5 decided on an above ground power house that was downstream of the dam for safety and cost. The intake was built on the east side of the dam and supplies two , long diameter concrete-lined penstocks (tunnels). Just before reaching the power house and its eight turbines, each penstock splits into four branches. The power house is about downstream of the dam and utilizes two surge tanks for sudden rises in water pressure from the two penstocks. Each surge tank has an diameter expansion chamber and is about higher than the actual dam structure. The surge tanks protect the penstocks and turbines from water hammer which would occur if the turbine gates were quickly closed and water pressure suddenly increases.  Cultural and political significance  The construction of the Daniel-Johnson Dam and the Manic-Outardes complex happened in a larger social and political context of the Quiet Revolution in Quebec, a time when recently nationalized \\"Hydro- Qu√©bec rapidly becomes a symbol of the new Quebec nationalism and of the new economic strategy of the State\\", explains historian Paul-Andr√© Linteau. This newfound euphoric attitude is found in newspapers of the period. In a series of papers published in Montreal's La Presse, Renaude Lapointe calls Hydro- Qu√©bec a \\"colossus on the march\\". In this context, the construction of the complex is closely followed by the public and becomes part of the popular culture of that era. For instance, chansonnier Georges Dor penned his 1966 hit song, La Manic, which tells the story of a construction worker at the remote jobsite who describes his loneliness to his wife in words that captured the collective imagination of the Quebec public.\\"T√©l√©vision - L√† o√π le Qu√©bec s'inventait\\". Le Devoir, Paul Cauchon, 19 April 2003 Belgian-born novelist Henri Vernes was also inspired by the gigantic project and made the Manic-5 project the setting of one of his Bob Morane adventure novels. Terreur √† la Manicouagan is about an attempt by arch-villain Roman Orgonetz to breach the dam by destroying the surge chamber by remote-controlled detonation, a plan foiled by Morane and his Scottish sidekick, Bill Ballantine. Prior to writing his novel, Vernes spent some time at the worksite, at the invitation of the Quebec government and Hydro-Qu√©bec. The book was launched in 1965 at the Hydro-Qu√©bec Building in Montreal. Other notable visitors to the construction site included cartoonist Herg√©, who left an original drawing of his characters Tintin the reporter and his dog Snowy posing in front of a ligne claire depiction of the dam. A colorized version of the autographed drawing is featured at the Jean-Lesage generating station visitor's center, north of Baie-Comeau. The hydroelectric project also gave its name to Montreal's first foray into professional soccer, the short-lived Montreal Manic. The franchise competed for three seasons in the North American Soccer League in the early 1980s. In March 2000, the Canada Post Corporation issued a 46 cent stamp featuring the Dam as part of a 4-stamp Millennium Collection sheet depicting \\"engineering and technological marvels\\". Guided tours Hydro-Qu√©bec organizes free guided tours of the facility during the summer. The dam is also a tourist attraction. Since the 1960s, Hydro-Qu√©bec organizes four daily tours of the facility between June 24, Quebec's National Day, and August 31. Off- season tours can also be arranged by appointment. The two-hour tour includes a briefing on the construction and operation of the facility, a visit of the Manic-5 powerhouse and a bus ride to the base and the crest of the dam, which has a view of the Manicouagan River valley. A lookout five minutes away by car is a popular picnic spot, with a view of the dam, which is lit at night . Although picture-taking is allowed in the visitor centre and outside, cameras have been banned inside the powerhouses since a Radio-Canada television crew entered the unguarded Manic-5-PA and Robert-Bourassa powerhouses in February 2005. The incident led to the resignations of Hydro-Qu√©bec's CEO Andr√© Caill√©, and chairman of the Board Andr√© Bourbeau, less than two months later. The dam is about three hours' drive from Baie-Comeau along narrow, winding Route 389. Hydro-Qu√©bec reported 8,217 visitors in 2009.

With the upgraded facility, combat units arrived at Conflans. The first was the 10th Reconnaissance Group, which based various photo-reconnaissance aircraft at the field from 20 November 1944 until March 1945.

He was canonised on 11 October 2009 by Pope Benedict XVI.Zygmunt Szczƒôsny Feli≈Ñski bio from Patron Saint Index Early life His parents were Gerard Feli≈Ñski and Eva Wenderoff. He was born in Voiutyn (pol. Wojutyn) in Volhynia (present-day Ukraine) when it was part of the Russian empire. He was the third of six children, of whom two died at an early age. His father died when he was eleven years old. Five years later in 1838 his mother was exiled to Siberia for a nationalist conspiracy (in which she tried to work to improve the social and economic conditions of the farmers), as a result he only got to see her again as a university student. After completing high school, he studied mathematics at the University of Moscow from 1840-1844. In 1847 he went to Paris where he studied French literature at the Sorbonne and the Coll√®ge de France. In Paris he spent time living with Polish exiles, and knew Adam Mickiewicz and was a friend of Juliusz S≈Çowacki. In 1848 he participated in the Polish uprising against Prussian rule in Pozna≈Ñ.Brian Porter. Thy Kingdom Come: Patriotism, Prophecy, and the Catholic Hierarchy in Nineteenth-Century Poland.

Priesthood Commemorative plaque in Zhytomyr, where he attended the diocesan seminary Portrait of archbishop Zygmunt Szczƒôsny Feli≈Ñski Photograph and autograph of archbishop Feli≈Ñski (between 1860 and 1895) In 1851 he returned to Poland and entered the diocesan seminary of Zhytomyr. He studied at the Saint Petersburg Roman Catholic Theological Academy. He was ordained on 8 September 1855 by the Archbishop of Mohilev, Ignacy Holowi≈Ñski. He was assigned to the Dominican Fathers' parish of St Catherine of Siena in St Petersburg until 1857, when he was appointed as spiritual director of the Ecclesiastical Academy and a professor of philosophy. In 1856 he founded the charitable organization \\"Recovery for the poor\\". In 1857 he founded the Congregation of the Franciscan Sisters of the Family of Mary. Appointment He succeeded Antoni Melchior Fija≈Çkowski to the Diocese of Warsaw-Praga in 1861. Archbishop Fijalkowski and the Polish hierarchy had emphasized the political obedience of Polish people to Russian rule (there had previously been the November Uprising against the Tsar in 1830 that the Pope had condemned in his encyclical Cum Primum in which he stressed the need to obey political rulers). During the interim between Fija≈Çkowski's death and Feli≈Ñski's appointment, there had been growing patriotic unrest in Warsaw. Opposition leaders held protests within churches both on grounds of security (as it was presumed the police would not enter the church) and to calm conservative fears that they were not communists. Russia declared martial law in Poland on 14 October 1861, and the following day nationalists staged demonstrations inside Warsaw churches, two of which were broken up by Warsaw police (which led to further scandal, as the public could not accept Russian soldiers in Polish Catholic churches). The Cathedral Vicar ordered all Warsaw churches be closed in protest. On 6 January 1862, Feli≈Ñski was appointed archbishop of Warsaw by Pope Pius IX, and he was consecrated in St Petersburg by Archbishop Zyli≈Ñski. He left the Russian capital on 31 January and arrived in Warsaw on 9 February. When Feli≈Ñski was appointed archbishop, he was greeted with suspicion in Warsaw because he was approved by the Russian government. Feli≈Ñski ordered the re-opening of Warsaw churches on 16 February (he also reconsecrated Warsaw Cathedral and had all churches opened with a solemn 40-hour exposition of the Blessed Sacrament), thus fulfilling the worst fears of the nationalists; he also banned the singing of patriotic hymns, and forbade the use of church buildings for political functions. The Polish underground press attacked him: an underground Catholic magazine called 'The Voice of the Polish Chaplain' wrote about him: > under the scarlet robes and the mitre of Father Feli≈Ñski hides one of those > false prophets, against whom Christ told us to be on guard. . . . Every day > brings us all sorts of new evidence that Father Feli≈Ñski does not care for > the country at all, that his heart is divided between Petersburg and Rome, > and that he wants to make the clergy apathetic about the fate of the > Fatherland, to turn it into an ultramontane caste that would have nothing in > common with the nation.\\" He defended himself as a Polish patriot and used the label 'traitor' for anyone willing to surrender the dream of independence. He wrote: > The right of nations to independent existence is so holy and undoubted, and > the inborn love of the fatherland is so deeply embedded in the heart of > every true citizen, that no sophistry can erase these things from the mass > of the nation.... All true Poles not only want to be free and independent in > their own country, but all are convinced that they have an inaliable right > to this, and they do not doubt that sooner or later they will stand before > their desires and once again be an independent nation. Whoever does not > demand independence or doubts the possibility of its attainment is not a > Polish patriot. During his time as archbishop there were almost daily clashes between the Russian occupiers and the nationalists. The Russian government promoted the image of the archbishop as being their collaborator, thus sowing distrust among people toward him. In 1862, Pope Pius IX sent a letter to Feli≈Ñski that criticized the existing civil laws in Russia as being opposed to the teachings, the rights and the freedoms of the Catholic Church, and he called on the archbishop to work for the freedom of those who had been imprisoned for the nationalist cause in Poland. He made every effort to free the imprisoned priests. Feli≈Ñski worked for the elimination of Russian government control of the Polish Catholic church. He made regular visits to parishes and charitable organizations in the diocese, to better meet their needs. He reformed the programmes of study at the Ecclesiastical Academy of Warsaw and in diocesan seminaries, to give impetus to spiritual and intellectual development of the clergy. He encouraged priests to proclaim the gospel openly, to catechize their parishioners, to begin parochial schools and to take care that they raise a new virtuous generation. He looked after the poor and orphans, and started an orphanage in Warsaw that he put in the care of the Sisters of the Family of Mary. In January 1863 there was a major uprising in Poland against Russian rule that ended in failure, and was brutally repressed. Feli≈Ñski protested against the repression by resigning from the Council of State. He protested against the hanging of Captain Fr. Agrypin Konarski. In March 1863 Feli≈Ñski wrote to Tsar Alexander II demanding that Poland be granted political autonomy and be restored to its pre-partition boundaries (including the territories that are now part of Lithuania, Belarus and the western Ukraine). The Tsar answered this letter by arresting Feli≈Ñski and sending him into exile in the town of Yaroslavl on the Upper Volga (about 300 km to the NE of Moscow; where there were almost no Catholics). The Vatican supported Feli≈Ñski's protest. Feli≈Ñski nevertheless was opposed to the rebellion, as he later wrote in his memoirs: > In my opinion, the question of our behaviour in relation to the partitioning > governments must not be resolved wholesale, but must be divided into at > least three categories: the question of rights, the question of time, and > the question of means. Regarding justice: neither Natural law, nor religion, > nor international law, nor finally historical tradition forbids us from > attaining with arms the independence that was taken from us by force. From a > position of principle, then, no one can condemn us for rising up in arms, as > something unjust by its very nature. The question of time and circumstances > is only a question of prudence, and only from that perspective can it be > resolved....The only area, then, in which it is permissible to judge the > justice or injustice of an armed uprising aimed at regaining independence is > the means of conducting the struggle, and in this regard our historians and > publicists have not only the right, but the obligation to enlighten the > national consciousness, so as to warn patriots against adventures that would > be ruinous for the national soul. His concerns were especially reflected in other conservative Catholic voices that opposed the 1830 insurrection and 1863 rebellion on grounds of the left- wing political radicalism that many of the rebels were associated with, including atheistic ideologies. Feli≈Ñski claimed revolution attacked both religion and the established social order. The social order of those times, extending into antiquity, was the Polish nobility and Polish clergy believed they were genetically superior to peasants. Peasants were regarded as a lower species. He called on people to place their trust in the governance of Providence in world affairs: > Whoever manages to always see the finger of Providence in the course of > historical events, and trusting in the justice of God, does not doubt that > every nation will ultimately receive that which it has earned by its > behavior, will recoil with disgust at the thought of committing a crime, > even if that would be the only means of fighting an even greater injustice. Exile He spent the next 20 years in exile in Yaroslavl. He was not allowed any contact with Warsaw. During his exile he organized works of mercy to help his fellow prisoners (especially the priests among them), and collected enough funds (despite police restrictions) to construct a Catholic church that would become a new parish. The local people were struck by his spiritual attitudes and referred to him as the 'holy Polish bishop'. During his exile he wrote several works that he later published after his release. Included among them were: Spiritual Conferences, Faith and Atheism in the search for happiness, Conferences on Vocations, Under the guidance of Providence,Social Commitments in View of Christian Wisdom and Atheism, and Memories. Krak√≥w In 1883, following negotiations between the Holy See and Russia, he was released from exile and moved to Dzwiniaczka in southeastern Galicia (now –î–∑–≤–∏–Ω—è—á–∫–∞ in Ukraine) among Ukrainian and Polish cropfarmers. The Pope transferred him from Archbishop of Warsaw to Archbishop of the titular see of Tarsus. There he was chaplain of the manor house of Counts Keszycki and Koziebrodski, and he launched into intense pastoral activity. Out of his own money he built the first school and kindergarten in the village. He also built a church and convent for the Franciscan Sisters of the Family of Mary. He died in Krak√≥w on 17 September 1895 and was buried on 20 September. On 10 October his body was moved to Dzwiniaczka, and his remains were removed again in 1920 to Warsaw, where on 14 April 1921 they were moved to the crypt of the Cathedral of Saint John, where they still are today. Views on Poland Feli≈Ñski criticized Zygmunt Krasi≈Ñski's claim that Poland was a Christ among nations. Feli≈Ñski said: > Although my nation was the victim of a cruel injustice,\\" Feli≈Ñski wrote, \\"it > did not proceed to martyrdom either willingly or without sin, as did our > Savior and the martyrs following in His footsteps. Considering our national > guilt and mistakes, it would be more appropriate to call Poland, as it pays > for its sins, the Mary Magdalene of nations, not the Christ of nations. In January 1863 he presented an interpretation of Poland's contemporary history as being a punishment from God for its sins: > The mission of Poland is to develop Catholic thinking in internal life... . > Poland was great as long as these virtues lived within it, as long as there > were no examples in its history of egoism or rapaciousness... When these > national virtues fell, when decadence and egoism set in, then the flogging > and the ruin arrived. This followed from the views of other Catholic conservatives at the time who believed that God would never grant Poland independence until it repented of its sins. Feli≈Ñski believed that God would redeem Poland of its sins, and thereby give it independence, but he criticized the independence movement for failing to believe in the role of Providence and (in his view) thinking as though the governance of the world was entirely up to human will. In the view of contemporary Catholic conservatives, in whom Feli≈Ñski had an important voice, the independence movement, whether it be based on the communist or liberal ideologies that had been adopted by many Polish nationalists, was doomed to failure because of this. He believed that every nation had a special role given to it by God: > just as every member of the family has an assigned task corresponding to his > or her natural abilities, so does every nation receive a mission in > accordance with the features Providence deigned to grant it. > From the fact that we lost independent existence, it does not at all follow > that our mission has ended. The character of that mission is so spiritual, > that not by the force of arms, but by the force of sacrifices will we > accomplish that which love demands of us. If independence would become a > condition necessary for fulfilling the task that has been laid upon us, then > Providence itself would so manage the course of events that state existence > would again be returned to us, so that we may sufficiently mature in spirit.

The operation was part of a reaction to the Tet Offensive designed to put pressure on Vietcong (VC) and People's Army of Vietnam (PAVN) forces in III Corps. Background Following the successful conclusion of Operation Quyet Thang which reestablished South Vietnamese control in the areas around Saigon, II Field Force commander LTG Frederick C. Weyand expanded the security operations from around Saigon into a counteroffensive involving nearly every combat unit in III Corps to pursue VC/PAVN forces. Operation The operation commenced on 8 April. In its first week Allied troops killed 709 VC/PAVN, in the second week 892 VC/PAVN were killed and in the last week of April 792 VC/PAVN were killed. Most of these losses resulted from squad and company-size firefights or helicopter gunship, tactical air strikes or artillery fire missions. On the early morning of 12 April while the 3rd Brigade, 25th Infantry Division swept VC Base Area 355, a forested area 5km northwest of the Michelin Rubber Plantation in Binh Duong Province, VC sappers from the 271st Regiment attacked the southwestern part of the night defense position of the 3rd Battalion, 22nd Infantry Regiment. The Americans returned fire as several hundred mortar rounds began to hit the position. At 04:00, a VC battalion came out of the trees and headed for the sector held by Company B. By 04:30, the VC had breached the perimeter and was threatening to push further in. At 05:00 the VC advance was stopped air and artillery strikes and the defenders were able to organize a counterattack. The reconnaissance platoon from the 3/22nd Infantry arrived to help Company B and at 06:15 a group of M113s from the 2/22nd Infantry arrived forcing the VC to break contact and withdrew by 07:00, leaving behind 153 dead. U.S. losses were 16 killed. The 3/22nd Infantry pursued the 271st Regiment and killed another 51 VC for the loss of 7 U.S. killed. On 18 April Troop A, 1st Squadron, 4th Cavalry Regiment engaged a VC force in a bunker complex 19km east of B·∫øn C√°t. The VC used CS gas against the Americans and eventually disengaged, losing at least 57 killed. On 25 April, 2 RAR/NZ (ANZAC) and 3 RAR were deployed to the Bien Hoa-Long Khanh border (now Dong Nai Province) to join the operation in anticipation of the attack. The two 1 ATF infantry battalions were supported by their two artillery batteries - one Australian and one New Zealand, a squadron of armoured personnel carriers from 3 Cavalry Regiment (A Squadron), 1 Field Squadron Royal Australian Engineers and 161 Independent Reconnaissance Flight Army Aviation. 3 RAR was replaced by 1 RAR on 3 May. On 5 May, the two 1 ATF battalions were redeployed further north into Bien Hoa Province. Search and destroy patrols saw several contacts with VC but with the attack not happening as expected the ANZAC battalion returned to its TAOR in Phuoc Tuy Province on 10 May to prepare 2 RAR and one of the two RNZIR companies for their departures from Vietnam.http://artilleryhistory.org/moments_in_history/on_this_day/1968/documents/real_story_of_fspb_coral_v7.pdf. However for the Australians and New Zealanders subsequent actions would lead to the Battle of Coral- Balmoral.http://artilleryhistory.org/moments_in_history/on_this_day/1968/documents/real_story_of_fspb_coral_v7.pdf Aftermath The operation was a success with allied forces claiming 7,645 VC/PAVN killed, however the operation did not prevent the VC/PAVN from launching their May Offensive attacks against Saigon. The official PAVN history described the operation as \\"causing a great many difficulties for our units trying to approach their targets\\" for the May Offensive and \\"during their advance toward [Saigon] our units were forced to fight as they marched and their forces suffered attrition.\\" With improved security in the countryside South Vietnamese Civil Operations and Revolutionary Development Support teams began returning to the villages and hamlets which had been abandoned to the VC with the start of the Tet Offensive. These teams generally found that the rural population was dismayed by the Allies‚Äô failure to protect them in the Tet Offensive and yearning for effective security from the VC, who had been taxing and recruiting them during the preceding two months. The operation was immediately followed by Operation Toan Thang II in the same area with the same forces.

Born in Dunedin, New Zealand, Culling joined the Samoa Expeditionary Force following the outbreak of the First World War but was prevented from departing the country by his father, due to his age. He travelled to England in 1915 and joined the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS). From September 1916, he flew with the No. 1 Squadron, RNAS, on the Western Front. He shot down his first German aircraft in April 1917 and would be credited with a total of six aerial victories, the first New Zealander to become a flying ace during the war, by the time of his death on 8 June 1917. Early life Thomas Grey Culling was born on 31 May 1896 in Dunedin to a notable local family. His father, Thomas Shepherd Culling, was a businessman and local body politician, after whom Dunedin's Culling Park is named. His grandfather, also Thomas Culling, was a printer and paper mill director, and was one of Dunedin's early colonial settlers, arriving in the city just one year after its 1848 founding. His family moved to the Auckland suburb of Remuera in 1906, and he was educated at King's College. First World War Following the outbreak of the First World War, Culling volunteered for the Samoa Expeditionary Force, then being raised specifically for the capture of German Samoa. However, he was prevented from departing New Zealand by his father, who had contacted authorities, pointing out his age. Only men of 20 years or older were being allowed to serve aboard and Culling was still only 18. The following year, in August, Culling left New Zealand for England to join the Royal Naval Air Service. In September 1916, as a flight sub-lieutenant, he was posted to No. 1 Squadron, which at the time was serving on the Western Front. Culling was assigned to fly Sopwith Triplane No. N5444 and began to score victories in Bloody April 1917, with his first three coming that month. The second one was significant; it was part of one of the war's epic dogfights. On 22 April, Culling was the wingman of the Australian ace, Roderic Dallas. The two pilots took on a formation of fourteen German planes; using air tactics that suited the Triplane's technological advantages, the two Naval aces thwarted the pending air offensive in a 45-minute dogfight that resulted in three German aircraft being shot down. The next day, Culling shot down a two-seater plane during a patrol that encountered a flight of nine aircraft. Culling went on to shoot down three more German aircraft in May, becoming New Zealand's first \\"ace\\" of the First World War. Earlier in the month, he had received a promotion to flight lieutenant. He was killed the following month, on 8 June 1917. As part of a four-man flight dispatched to shoot down an intruder aircraft, he encountered seven German aircraft near Ypres and was shot down by Vizeflugmeister Hans Bottler of the Imperial German Navy. His body was never recovered. Shortly after his death, he was posthumously recognised with the Distinguished Service Cross for his actions in the engagements of 22‚Äì23 April 1917. The medal was presented by the Earl of Liverpool, Governor-General of New Zealand, to his father in a ceremony at Auckland the following year.

Early life and career Maria Grachvogel was born in London to a Polish father and Irish mother. She was a keen designer as a teenager, creating her first collection at the age of 14. On leaving school she initially pursued a career in the City to raise capital to start her own business, passing a London Stock Exchange examination at the age of 17. Design career Grachvogel's first fashion business was a partnership with a friend and fellow designer. After the partnership ended, she briefly returned to working in the City, but resumed designing within six months. She founded her own company in January 1991, aged 21, with a collection of nine dresses. She exhibited at London Fashion Week for the first time in 1994, and staged her first catwalk show there in 1995. Grachvogel attracted international attention when Victoria Beckham appeared as a model in her February 2000 catwalk show at London Fashion Week. Beckham appeared first in green satin hot pants, followed by a flamenco-styled crimson gown, and reappeared at the end of the show in a long off-the-shoulder red dress. Later that year Grachvogel again attracted publicity when she designed a dress hand-sewn with 2,000 diamonds worth approximately ¬£250,000 for her September show. The dress was a long black silk evening gown slashed to the thigh, with the diamonds in rows on the bodice. The diamonds were set in 18-carat gold and totalled 190 carats in weight. The dress was modelled by Jodie Kidd, and formed the finale to the show. Grachvogel launched her store in 2001, based in Sloane Street, London. Her designs include \\"Magic Pants\\", trousers without pockets or side seams designed to give the wearer a smooth silhouette. In 2011 the store moved to Culford Gardens, London.

Phoenix is headquartered in Hartford, Connecticut, and has 650 employees as of 2015.Nassau Reinsurance Group To Buy Phoenix Cos., Take Insurer Private, Keep HQ In Hartford, Companies Say Phoenix remains one of the few insurance companies to keep its headquarters in Hartford.Latest Merger Makes It Clearer Than Ever: Hartford Is No Longer the Insurance Capital. New York Times, November 21, 2003 History The Phoenix Companies comprises a number of businesses that trace their origins to the mid-19th century. 19th century In 1851, the oldest predecessor of The Phoenix Companies, The American Temperance Life Insurance Company, was founded. The American Temperance Life Insurance Company was a part-mutual, part-stock company that insured only those who abstained from alcohol and was founded by a group of prominent Hartford businessmen as well as religious and civic leaders. As the temperance movement began to wane, American Temperance Life Insurance Company changed its name to Phoenix Mutual Life Insurance Company in 1860, accepting all customers. The company's new name is in reference to the mythological Phoenix, rather than the city. In 1857, an agent from the Phoenix Companies, Sylvester M. Wait, assigned the name Phoenix, named after the company, to a small town in Southern Oregon. In 1860, another early predecessor, the Home Life Insurance Company was formed in Brooklyn, New York, and was the first life insurer authorized by the New York Insurance Department. In 1894, Home Life built its 16-story headquarters, the Home Life Insurance Company Building, on Broadway in New York City, which as one of the world's first steel-framed skyscrapers for a short time was one of the world's tallest buildings. The company's headquarters in Hartford, Connecticut 20th century In the early 20th century, the company pioneered several innovations in the marketing of insurance. In 1901, Phoenix published The Field, believed to be the first agent newsletter and in 1906 produced \\"A Prospectus and Ten Lessons Upon Life Insurance,\\" the first agent training course used by a life insurance company. In 1912, Phoenix became the first life insurance company to use direct mail advertising. In 1923, Phoenix created the first advertisement to promote the value of life insurance and then in 1926, runs advertisements for its retirement income plan in national magazines, with the tag line, \\"You don't have to be rich to retire at 55 on $200 a month.\\" Phoenix pioneered other innovations, including offering reduced life insurance premium rates for women for the first time in 1955 and selling group life and health insurance plans to small businesses in 1957. In 1967, Phoenix is the first insurer to offer discounted premiums to nonsmokers. Since 1992 Phoenix and Home Life completed a merger in 1992 to create the Phoenix Home Life Mutual Insurance Company.

Publication history Captain America was starring in the title Tales of Suspense, which was retitled Captain America with issue #100 (April 1968). The new title Captain America continued to feature artwork by Jack Kirby, as well as a short run by Jim Steranko, and work by many of the industry's top artists and writers. It was called Captain America and the Falcon from #134 (Feb. 1971) to #222 (June 1978), although the Falcon's name was not on the cover for issues #193, 200, and 216. The 1972‚Äì1975 run on the title by writer Steve Englehart and artist Sal Buscema saw the series become one of Marvel's top- sellers. In 2010, Comics Bulletin ranked Englehart and Buscema's run on Captain America fourth on its list of the \\"Top 10 1970s Marvels\\". Kirby returned to the series as writer and penciler with issue #193 (Jan. 1975) and remained through #214 (Oct. 1977). This series ‚Äî considered Captain America volume one by comics researchers and historians and ‚Äî ended with #454 (Aug. 1996). Captain America Vol. 1 should not be confused with the 1940s series Captain America Comics (1941‚Äì1949, 1954) and Captain America's Weird Tales (1949‚Äì1950). This series was almost immediately followed by the 13-issue Captain America vol. 2 (Nov. 1996 ‚Äì Nov. 1997, part of the \\"Heroes Reborn\\" crossover), and the 50-issue Captain America vol. 3 (Jan. 1998 ‚Äì Feb. 2002), and the 32-issue Captain America vol. 4 (June 2002 ‚Äì Dec. 2004), and and Captain America vol. 5 (Jan. 2005 ‚Äì Aug. 2011). and Beginning with the 600th overall issue (Aug. 2009), Captain America resumed its original numbering, as if the series numbering had continued uninterrupted after #454. As part of the aftermath of Marvel Comics' company-crossover storyline \\"Civil War\\", Steve Rogers was ostensibly killed in Captain America vol. 5, #25 (March 2007). Series writer Ed Brubaker remarked, \\"What I found is that all the really hard- core left-wing fans want Cap to be standing out on and giving speeches on the street corner against the George W. Bush administration, and all the really right-wing fans all want him to be over in the streets of Baghdad, punching out Saddam Hussein.\\" The character's co-creator, Joe Simon, said, \\"It's a hell of a time for him to go. We really need him now.\\" Artist Alex Ross designed a slightly revised Captain America costume that former sidekick Bucky Barnes began to wear as the new Captain America in vol. 5, #34 (March 2008). As of 2007, an estimated 210 million copies of \\"Captain America\\" comic books had been sold in 75 countries. The storyline of Rogers' return began in issue #600. Marvel stated in May 2011 that Rogers, following the public death of Bucky Barnes in the \\"Fear Itself\\" crossover, would resume his Captain America identity in a sixth volume of Captain America, by writer Ed Brubaker and artist Steve McNiven. The Captain America title continued from issue #620 featuring team up stories with Bucky (#620-#628), Hawkeye (#629-#632), Iron Man (#633‚Äì635), Namor (#635.1), and Black Widow (#636-#640), and the title ended its print run with issue #640.

Remain the Wahinda, a clan or class alluded to in this and a former chapter... The Wahinda (in the singular Muhinda) are, according to some Arabs, a foreign and ruling family, who coming from a distant country, probably in the neighbourhood of Somaliland, conquered the lands, and became Sultans. This opinion seems to rest upon physical peculiarities ‚Äì the superiority of the Wahinda in figure, stature, and complexion to their subjects suggesting a difference of origin. Others explain the word Muhinda to mean a cadet of royal family, and call the class Bayt el Saltanah, or the Kingly House. ... The Wahinda are found in the regions of Usui, Karagwah, Uhha, Uvinza, Uyungu, Ujiji, and Urundi, where they live in boma -- stockades‚Äîand scattered villages. Of this race are the Sultans Suwarora of the Wasui, Armanika of Karagway, Kanoni of Uhha, Kanze of Uyungu, Mzogera of Uvinza, Rusimba of Ujiji, Mwezi of Urundi, Mnyamurunde of Uyofo, Gaetawa of Uhayya, and Mutawazi of Utumbara. The Wahinda affect a milk diet which is exceedingly fattening, and anoint themselves plentifully with butter and ghee, to soften and polish the skin. They never sell [i.e. enslave] their fellow clansmen, are hospitable and civil to strangers, seldom carry arms, fear nothing from the people, and may not be slain even in battle. There the Wahinda reigh, their ministers are the Watosi, a race which has been described when treating of their headquarters Karagwah.\\" They originated from the North as shown by their physical aspect Again, the princes of Unyoro are called Wawitu, and point to the north when asked where their country Uwitu is situated, doubtfully saying, when questioned about its distance, \\"How can we tell circumstances which took place in our forefathers' times? we only think it is somewhere near your country.\\" Although, however, this very interesting people, the Wahima, delight in supposing themselves to be of European origin, they are forced to confess, on closer examination, that although they came in the first instance from the doubtful north, they came latterly from the east, as part of a powerful tribe, beyond Kidi, who excel in arms, and are so fierce no Kidi people, terrible in war as these too are described to be, can stand against them. This points, if our maps are true, to the Gallas ‚Äî for all pastorals in these people's minds are Wahuma; and if we could only reconcile ourselves to the belief that the Wawitu derived their name from Omwita, the last place they attacked on the east coast of Africa, then all would be clear: for it must be noticed the Wakama, or kings, when asked to what race they owe their origin, invariably reply, in the first place, from princes‚Äîgiving, for instance, the titles Wawitu in Unyoro, and Wahinda in Karague ‚Äî which is most likely caused by their never having been asked such a close question before, whilst the idiom of the language generally induces them to call themselves after the name applied to their country.

They are typically known as happies (a name also used for some other haplocromines) or smallmouths. The latter name refers to their small mouth compared to their close relatives, the largemouths of the genus Serranochromis. Unlike the species in that genus which mostly feed on other fish, Sargochromis mostly feed on invertebrates (especially molluscs and aquatic insects), but in some species plant material (especially seeds) is important. On occasion they will also eat small fish, and the stomachs of S. carlottae and S. codringtonii commonly contain fish scales, but whether these are already-lost scales that are picked off the bottom or they are actively bumped off large fish is unknown. Some of the species that feed heavily on aquatic snails have been used for biological pest control. Sargochromis are mouthbrooders. Depending on the exact species, they reach a maximum total length of . Sargochromis support important local fisheries, and some are also considered game fish. Although a few species have quite small distributions, they generally remain fairly common overall. All Sargochromis species are considered least concern (not threatened) by the IUCN, except the relatively poorly known S. thysi, which is considered data deficient (available information is insufficient for determining its conservation status). Species and taxonomy There are currently eight recognized species in this genus: * Sargochromis carlottae (Boulenger, 1905) (Rainbow Happy) * Sargochromis codringtonii (Boulenger, 1908) (Green Happy) * Sargochromis coulteri (Bell-Cross, 1975) (Cunene Happy) * Sargochromis giardi (Pellegrin, 1903) (Pink Happy) * Sargochromis greenwoodi (Bell-Cross, 1975) (Greenwood's Happy) * Sargochromis mellandi (Boulenger, 1905) (Snaileater) * Sargochromis mortimeri (Bell-Cross, 1975) (Mortimer's Happy) * Sargochromis thysi (Poll, 1967) A few other, possibly undescribed species are known.

Baboo Conoylal Tagore of Tagore zamindari has presented the plate to Asiatic Society of Bengal in 1838, but now it is missing from collection. The plate is made of copper and was sharp in the letters, that the plate could have been long buried in the place where it was found. There was a seal, which is an elaborately executed figure of Siva in copper cast. The character of this inscription is rather less simple than the earlier alphabets of Pala dynasty. It is strictly the Gaur character which has descended the modern written Bengali. It is much to be regretted that when the first a font of Bengali type was prepared, the letters were made after the model of the running hand or written instead of this which may be called the print hand. History In Bengal and India Copper plate inscriptions (tamarashasana), usually record grants of land or lists of royal lineages carrying the royal seal, a profusion of which have been found . These inscriptions were legal documents such as title-deeds they were etched on a cave or temple wall, were then secreted in a safe place such as within the walls or foundation of a temple, or hidden in stone caches in fields. The earliest authenticated plates were issued by the Pallava dynasty kings in the 4th century A.D. The use of copper plate inscriptions increased and for several centuries they remained the primary source of legal records. This is the first copperplate record of a grant by the Sena Dynasty. Importance of Edilpur Copperplate Edilpur Copperplate Edilpur copperplate inscriptions play an important role in the reconstruction of the history of Bengal. An account of the plate was published in the Dacca Review and Epigraphic Indica. The copperplate inscription written Sanskrit and in Gauda character dated 3rd jyaistha of 1136 samval which represents 1079 A.D. The Asiatic Society's proceeding for January 1838, an account of the Edilpur plate describes that 3 villages were given to a Brahman named Iswara Deva Sarma, of the Vatsa tribe, of the villages of Bagule Bettogata and Udyamuna situated between four equally unknown places in Banga, or Bengal in the 3rd year of Keshab Sen. The grant was given with the landlord rights, receives the power of punishing the chandrabhandas or sundarbans, a race that lived in the forest. It records the grant of the land in the village of Leliya in the Kumaratalaka mandala situated in shatata-padamavati-visaya. The copperplate of Kaesava Sana tells that the king Vallal Sena carried away the goddesses of fortune for the enemies on palanquins (Shivaka) supported by staff made of elephant tusk. It also claims that his father Lakhman Sena (1179‚Äì1205) erects pillars of victory and sacrificial posts at Benaras and Allahbad and Adon Coast of South Sea.

Factual background Carmen Szendrey-Ramos worked for First Bancorp as their general counsel in Puerto Rico. After investigating several possible ethics violations and illegal activities, Szendrey-Ramos was fired. She sued First Bancorp under Title VII alleging discrimination and retaliation and for violations of the Puerto Rico constitution. First Bancorp made a motion to dismiss the claims. Decision The district court allowed the Title VII claims to move forward, but declined to exercise supplemental jurisdiction over the Puerto Rico law claims. The court reasoned that the Puerto Rico law claims would require Szendrey-Ramos to possibly divulge client information in litigation, an action regulated by Canon 21 of the Puerto Rico Code of Professional Ethics. The court determined that the entanglement with Canon 21 created a novel and complex problem of Puerto Rico law, and that the Puerto Rico law claims would dominate the Title VII claims if supplemental jurisdiction was exercised.

History Virtus Investment Partners, formerly known as Phoenix Investment Partners, Ltd., was formed on November 1, 1995 through a reverse merger with Duff & Phelps Investment Management Co., at the time the investment management affiliate of Duff & Phelps Corporation. 1995 - 2006 From 1995 to 2001, Virtus was a majority-owned indirect subsidiary of Phoenix Life Insurance Co. During this period, the company purchased a majority interest in several boutique investment management companies to establish its multi-manager business model. In addition to Duff & Phelps Investment Management, Virtus‚Äô affiliates during this time included Kayne Anderson Rudnick Investment Management, LLC, Seneca Capital Management, and Zweig Advisers LLC, which was founded by legendary Wall Street investor Martin Zweig. On January 11, 2001, a subsidiary of Phoenix acquired the outstanding shares of Phoenix Investment Partners not already owned, and the company became an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of Phoenix. In May 2005, Phoenix Investment Partners acquired the remaining minority interest in Seneca Capital Management and in September of that year acquired the remaining minority interest in Kayne Anderson Rudnick, thereby increasing ownership of both companies to 100%. In May 2006, Phoenix Investment Partners adopted the Harris Insight Funds from Harris Investment Management, Inc. 2006 - 2009 In February 2008, Phoenix announced it would spin-off Phoenix Investment Partners as an independent asset management company through a pro-rata dividend of Phoenix Investment Partners' common stock to Phoenix's shareholders.\\"Phoenix Announces Intention to Spin Off Phoenix Investment Partners\\", phx.corporate- ir.net, Feb. 7, 2008 On October 30, 2008, Harris Bankcorp Inc., a U.S. subsidiary of Bank of Montreal, announced it would acquire $45 million in convertible preferred stock, representing a 23 percent equity position in Virtus.\\"Harris Bankcorp to Take Minority Equity Position In Virtus Investment Partners\\", bnet.com, Oct. 30, 2008. Virtus became an independent publicly traded company on December 31, 2008 upon completion of its spin-off from Phoenix. The first day of trading of VRTS was January 2, 2009, and company officials rang the opening bell at NASDAQ Market Site on January 5, 2009.\\"Virtus Gains in Debut Amid Acquisition Speculation\\", Hartford Courant via pqasb.pqarchiver.com, Jan. 3, 2009.  2010 - 2019  The years 2011 through 2018 was a period of expansion for Virtus as it established or acquired several affiliated managers, beginning in June 2011, when it established Newfleet Asset Management as a fixed income affiliate with approximately $5.2 billion of assets under management. David L. Albrycht, formerly executive managing director of Goodwin Capital Advisors, an investment management company that previously was a subsidiary of Virtus, became chief investment officer of Newfleet. In October 2012, Virtus completed the acquisition of Rampart Investment Management, a registered investment advisor specializing in options strategies. In 2013, the company established a Dublin-based UCITS, and in 2015 acquired a majority interest in ETF Issuer Solutions (ETFis), a New York City-based company that operates a platform for listing, operating, and distributing exchange-traded funds. It was renamed Virtus ETF Solutions. In December 2016, Virtus agreed to acquire multi- boutique asset manager RidgeWorth Investments from private equity firm Lightyear Capital and Ridgeworth's employees for $472 million. That transaction, which was completed in June 2017, added approximately $40 billion in assets managed by Ridgeworth's three wholly owned affiliates, Ceredex Value Advisors, Seix Investment Advisors, and Silvant Capital Management. Virtus completed a majority investment in Sustainable Growth Advisers (SGA), an investment manager headquartered in Stamford, Connecticut that specializes in high-conviction U.S. and global growth equity portfolios, in July 2018.

Traub earned his Bachelor of Arts degree from the University at Buffalo in 1973, followed by a Juris Doctor from the Golden Gate University School of Law in 1977. He was admitted to the New York Bar Association in 1978.  Career  He is admitted to practice law before the U.S. District Court Southern, Eastern and Western Districts of New York, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals, and Eastern District of Wisconsin. Traub is the founding member and managing partner, of Traub, Bonacquist, and Fox, a New York-based boutique law firm specializing in bankruptcy and business reorganization matters. In September, 2006, Marc Dreier, sole equity partner of Dreier, LLP, acquired the boutique law firm. Paul Traub became a Dreier partner and co- chair with Norman Kinel of the Bankruptcy and Business Reorganization group. On December 5, 2008, after Dreier's arrest for being involved in an alleged scheme to sell $700 million in fictitious promissory notes, Traub and the other bankruptcy lawyers resigned and restarted Traub, Bonacquist & Fox. In February, 2009, Epstein, Becker & Green, a firm specializing in government contracts, brought the seven-member Traub/Dreier bankruptcy team into their New York office. Traub represented the creditors in eToys.com bankruptcy. The dotcom company filed for chapter 11 protection toward the end of the Internet bubble on March 7, 2001.

Sketch from: ; MWS = mean water surface. In physical oceanography, undertow is the under-current that is moving offshore when waves are approaching the shore. Undertow is a natural and universal feature for almost any large body of water: it is a return flow compensating for the onshore-directed average transport of water by the waves in the zone above the wave troughs. The undertow's flow velocities are generally strongest in the surf zone, where the water is shallow and the waves are high due to shoaling. In popular usage, the word \\"undertow\\" is often misapplied to rip currents. An undertow occurs everywhere underneath shore-approaching waves, whereas rip currents are localized narrow offshore currents occurring at certain locations along the coast.  Oceanography  An \\"undertow\\" is a steady, offshore- directed compensation flow, which occurs below waves near the shore. Physically, nearshore, the wave-induced mass flux between wave crest and trough is onshore directed. This mass transport is localized in the upper part of the water column, i.e. above the wave troughs. To compensate for the amount of water being transported towards the shore, a second-order (i.e. proportional to the wave height squared), offshore-directed mean current takes place in the lower section of the water column. This flow ‚Äì the undertow ‚Äì affects the nearshore waves everywhere, unlike rip currents localized at certain positions along the shore. The term undertow is used in scientific coastal oceanography papers. The distribution of flow velocities in the undertow over the water column is important as it strongly influences the on- or offshore transport of sediment. Outside the surf zone there is a near-bed onshore-directed sediment transport induced by Stokes drift and skewed- asymmetric wave transport. In the surf zone, strong undertow generates a near- bed offshore sediment transport. These antagonistic flows may lead to sand bar formation where the flows converge near the wave breaking point, or in the wave breaking zone. Mean flow-velocity vectors in the undertow under plunging waves, as measured in a laboratory wave flume ‚Äì by . Below the wave trough, the mean velocities are directed offshore. The beach slope is 1:20; note that the vertical scale is distorted relative to the horizontal scale. Seaward mass flux An exact relation for the mass flux of a nonlinear periodic wave on an inviscid fluid layer was established by Levi-Civita in 1924. In a frame of reference according to Stokes' first definition of wave celerity, the mass flux M_w of the wave is related to the wave's kinetic energy density E_k (integrated over depth and thereafter averaged over wavelength) and phase speed c through: :M_w = \\\\frac{2E_k}{c}. Similarly, Longuet Higgins showed in 1975 that ‚Äì for the common situation of zero mass flux towards the shore (i.e. Stokes' second definition of wave celerity) ‚Äì normal-incident periodic waves produce a depth- and time-averaged undertow velocity: :\\\\bar{u} = - \\\\frac{2 E_k}{\\\\rho c h}, with h the mean water depth and \\\\rho the fluid density. The positive flow direction of \\\\bar{u} is in the wave propagation direction. For small-amplitude waves, there is equipartition of kinetic (E_k) and potential energy (E_p): :E_w = E_k + E_p \\\\approx 2 E_k \\\\approx 2 E_p, with E_w the total energy density of the wave, integrated over depth and averaged over horizontal space. Since in general the potential energy E_p is much easier to measure than the kinetic energy, the wave energy is approximately {E_w\\\\approx\\\\tfrac18\\\\rho g H^2} (with H the wave height). So :\\\\bar{u}\\\\approx -\\\\frac18 \\\\frac{g H^2}{ c h }. For irregular waves the required wave height is the root-mean-square wave height H_\\\\text{rms}\\\\approx\\\\sqrt{8}\\\\;\\\\sigma, with \\\\sigma the standard deviation of the free-surface elevation. The potential energy is E_p=\\\\tfrac12\\\\rho g \\\\sigma^2 and E_w\\\\approx\\\\rho g \\\\sigma^2. The distribution of the undertow velocity over the water depth is a topic of ongoing research. Confusion with rip currents In contrast to undertow, rip currents are responsible for the great majority of drownings close to beaches. When a swimmer enters a rip current, it starts to carry them offshore. The swimmer can exit the rip current by swimming at right angles to the flow, parallel to the shore, or by simply treading water or floating. However, drowning may occur when swimmers exhaust themselves by trying unsuccessfully to swim directly against the flow.

It is managed locally by the Association of Residents of Conjunto Palmeira (Associa√ß√£o dos Moradores do Conjunto Palmeira), known by its acronym ASMOCONP, the staff of which is mostly volunteer. Its mission is to implement programs and projects for work and income generation using solidarity economy systems primarily focused on overcoming urban and rural poverty. Its objective is to ensure micro-credits for local production and consumption with low interest rates and no requirements for registration, proof of income, or guarantor, (the neighbors guarantee the borrower's reliability). Its mission is also to provide access to banking services to residents of poorer communities who generally would not otherwise have access to them in traditional banks, based on lack of credit history or financial collateral and/or physical distance.  History  Images of Conjunto Palmeira in the 1970s The origin of the Palmeira neighborhood dates back to the 1970s. Due to redevelopment initiatives along the coast of the city enacted by the municipal government, fishing communities and other inhabitants were uprooted and forced to move inland. The inland district, known today as Conjunto Palmeira, was devoid of basic infrastructure such as water, roads, and electricity, thereby leaving the neighborhood vulnerable to floods and other natural and economic stability problems. Furthermore, the move inland left the primarily fishing-based community without a stable source of income. In 1981, the residents came together to improve their community, thereby creating ASMOCONP. In January 1998, ASMOCONP created Banco Palmas as a strategy to face unemployment, creating locally work and income opportunities for residents. As such, Banco Palmas was created as a popular finance tool operating under the principles and values of the solidarity economy. In 2000, Banco Palmas created the social currency palmas, which circulates in local commerce. In March 2003, ASMOCONP also established the Instituto Palmas de Desenvolvimento e Socioeconomia Solid√°ria (a.k.a. Instituto Palmas), a non- profit, civil society organization created from the experience of ASMOCONP. By 2003, the solidarity finances methodology of CDBs was being discussed in several municipalities as an effective instrument in income generation for the poor. One year later, in September 2004, the second CDB opened under the name Banco Par, in the municipality of Paracuru, Cear√°, 70 kilometers from Fortaleza. By 2005, two more banks were established in the state of Esp√≠rito Santo ‚Äì Banco Bem (Municipality of Vitoria) and Banco Terra (Municipality of Vila Velha). By 2008, there were 34 community banks in operation. As of February 2011, there are 52 community banks throughout 12 states in Brazil. In January 2006, Banco Popular do Brasil became a partner of the Brazilian Network of Community Development Banks as a guarantor of credit lines to the CDBs, through an agreement with the National Secretariat of Solidarity Economy (Secretaria Nacional de Economia Solidaria do MTE). The agreement allowed not only Banco Palmas, but the entire network of community banks to have access to credit and to act as banking correspondents of Banco Popular do Brasil. During that same year, Petrobras decided to support the establishment of new CDBs in two other municipalities; adding up to twelve working CDBs in Brazil by the end of 2006. Recently, the banks Caixa Econ√¥mica Federal (a.k.a. Caixa) and BNDES have become the main financial partners of Banco Palmas - Caixa offering banking correspondent services and limited credit, and BNDES offering credit and institutional development support as of 2011. Zurich Brasil has also played a substantial role in the development of the bank‚Äôs new line of insurance products, beginning with life insurance (launched in September 2010) and expanding to other programs in the coming years. From 2011, the National Program for Community Banks launched by SENAES - The National Secretary of the Solidarity Economy (Secretaria Nacional de Economia Solid√°ria) will be responsible for the continued growth of the Brazilian Network of Community Banks.  Theory  The main theory behind Banco Palmas, its actions, its achievements, and its history, is that an inherently economically poor territory (be it neighborhood, region, or municipality) does not exist. Territories become poor after repeatedly losing their own savings. Despite the level of poverty of any given territory, it is always capable of achieving economic development. Said development must be autonomous, from within, otherwise, it will not be sustainable. Example of local, neighborhood business which accepts Palmas (\\"Aceitamos Palmas,\\" meaning \\"We accept Palmas\\").  Local Currency  Formally known as \\"local social circulating currency\\" or, informally, ‚Äúlocal currency‚Äù or ‚Äúsocial currency‚Äù (moeda local or moeda social), is a currency complementary to the real (Brazilian national currency - R$) and created by each community bank. The banks provide small amount loans in real and in the local currency, which circulates only within the neighborhood. (The social currency of Banco Palmas is the ‚Äúpalma,‚Äù for example. Each community has its own with its own proper name.) One unit of local currency is equal to one real, and both currencies can be exchanged freely at any time. Incentives for local merchants and consumers exist to use the local currency by providing discounts to users. The social currency aims to make the \\"money\\" circulate in the community, thereby expanding the power of local commerce, increasing circulating wealth in the community, and generating both employment and income. The social currency, therefore, becomes an essential component in the strategies of community banks. Credits can help the economic growth of the district or county by creating new wealth. Local currencies ensure development by promoting that wealth circulates in the community itself.  Micro-Financial Services  Woman taking out money from the bank Microcredit Microcredits are given to those who normally cannot access \\"official\\" sources of funding because of bureaucracy; guarantor, income level, and asset requirements; and other banking regulations. Forms of Microcredit 1\\\\. Credit for Production, Consumption, or Service For the improvement or creation of both formal and informal small businesses. Based in neighbor guarantees (not monetary or asset guarantees) and with the preliminary approval of a Community Credit Agent (Agente Comunit√°rio de Cr√©dito), the loan must be presented to the Credit Committee which ultimately evaluates and approves the loans, made in amounts of up to R$15,000.00 in up to 12 payments. Interest rates are progressive and range from 0.5% to 3.5% monthly. 2\\\\. Credit for Productive Inclusion ‚ÄúInstant credit‚Äù allowing the creditor to benefit from the day-to-day opportunities the community market has to offer. Aimed toward families receiving government assistance through the Bolsa Familia Program (up to R$150), beauty product vendors (up to R$400), and street vendors people (up to R$200), loans are re-paid in up to four payments and interest rates range between 1.5% and 2.5% monthly. Credit recipients must present proof of trade or craft and justify the purpose of credit. On average 160 microloans are issued in Banco Palmas alone. 3\\\\. ‚ÄúCasa Produtiva‚Äù Instant credit for the purpose of home renovation, with the objective to create or improve an income generating enterprise. The maximum value of the loans is R$450, re-paid in up to six payments with an interest rate of 2.5% monthly. 4\\\\. Credit for Local Consumption Disbursed in social currency palmas in the maximum amount of R$600 payable in up to four payments with no interest.

The palmas is indexed to the real, is backed by the official country currency, and the exchange between the two currencies is legally permitted. As of 2010, 42,000 palmas were circulating in the neighborhood. Microinsurance ‚ÄúPalmas Microseguro‚Äù was launched in September 2010. It is a microinsurance policy for low income, Banco Palmas clients. At an annual cost of R$27.30, it offers up to R$3,000 life insurance policies (accidental or natural death), funeral cost coverage up to R$1,000, and a R$5,000 lottery every month for one year to clients. Those who buy more than three policies are allowed to pay in as much as six payments per year, (there is a special loan directed at these cases). On average 130 policies are sold per month. Banking Correspondent Banco Palmas has a strong role as a banking correspondent,Articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com helping the community to locally make and receive payments such as bolsa familia and pension benefits, open checking and savings accounts, as well as other banking services. This role is an important one for community banks in general because it allows basic banking access to communities who may be located very far from traditional banks, thereby making commuting difficult or impossible for elderly or disabled residents. On average 17,000 transactions per month are executed.  Instituto Palmas  Instituto Palmas In March 2003, ASMOCONP also established the Instituto Palmas de Desenvolvimento e Socioeconomia Solid√°ria (a.k.a. Instituto Palmas), a non-profit, civil society organization created from the experience of ASMOCONP in order to: * Negotiate new and manage existing financial partnerships * Assist in the implementation of community banks in other communities * Gather data about the people and operations throughout the network * Release official publications about the community bank experience in Brazil * Provide staff and community trainings throughout the network * Develop new and manage existing financial products Legally, Instituto Palmas functions as a Civil Society Organization of Public Interest (OSCIP) of Micro-credit. It acts as an umbrella organization by managing the network and providing legal support to all community banks, many of which are just ‚Äúlocal associations‚Äù with no institutional structure. As an OSCIP, Instituto Palmas can establish partnerships with the public sector and official banks, thereby generating resources and technologies for the benefit of the community banks that are part of the network.  Legal Framework  From a legal standpoint, Banco Palmas (and a majority of the Community Banks) work under the protection of the legal framework of Instituto Palmas. Instituto Palmas is a Civil Society Organization of Public Interest (OSCIP) of Microcredit. Cooperation with the Central Bank has grown in the last four years, culminating in November 2009 with the announcement of a new partnership between Banco Palmas and the Central Bureau of Solidarity Economy/ Federal Minister of Work (Secretaria Nacional de Economia Solid√°riao-SENAES/Minist√©rio do Trabalho do Governo Federal) to create an official bill for the social currencies, thereby creating a sort of ‚Äúofficial position‚Äù of the Brazilian government on local circulating monies. The process is ongoing, but the relationship with the Central Bank and the Brazilian Network of Community Banks in regard to the use of the social currency has been significantly positive.  The Brazilian Network of Community Banks  A map of the community banks in Brazil as of 2010 Banco Palmas belongs to the Brazilian Network of Community Banks (see below), The Cear√° Network of the Solidarity Socio-Economy (a Rede Cearense de Socioeconomia Solid√°ria - RCSES), and the Brazilian Forum of Solidary Economy (o F√≥rum Brasileiro de Economia Solid√°ria - FBES). Logo of the Brazilian Network of Community Banks The Brazilian Network of Community Banks currently includes 52 banks (as of March 2011) throughout Brazil, each created with the experience and support of Banco Palmas. A community bank is not a branch of a central bank, rather part of a network, following reference and common work methods defined by the Brazilian Network of Community Banks. The following is some basic information about community development banks: What are Community Development Banks? Community Development Banks provide solidarity finances services in a network of associative and communitarian nature, directed towards the generation of jobs and income, having at its base the principles of the solidarity economy. What are the main characteristics of the Community Development Banks? # The community itself decides to create the bank, becoming its manager and proprietor; # It always acts with two credit lines: one in Real currency (R$) and another one in circulating social currency; # Its credit lines stimulate the creation of local production and consumption networks, promoting the auto- development of the area; # It supports enterprises as a commercialization strategy (solidarity shops, fairs, central office for commercialization etc.); # It acts in areas characterized by a high degree of exclusion and social inequality; # It is aimed at a public characterized by a high degree of social vulnerability, in particular the beneficiaries of governmental programs; # It aims to become financially sustainable in the short term, obtaining subsidies justified by their social utility. What is the objective of a Community Development Bank? To promote the development of low income areas through the encouragement and creation of local production and consumption networks. It operates with the support of the economic initiatives of the solidarity economy and its diverse scope, such as socio-productive enterprises, service providers, support for socio-commercial initiatives (markets, solidarity fairs), and consumer organizations. What is the management structure of the Community Development Bank? CDBs are managed from within the structure of the community organizations (associations, councils, forums etc.) and other types of civil society initiatives that are recognized within the community, such as unions, NGOs, and churches. Its management involves a shared dimension with strong components of local social control, based on the mechanisms of direct democracy. How do you finance Community Development Banks? Its financing is done through access to public resources as well as a solidarity fund for community investment. This fund is formed from multiple sources: private, personal donations or those from legal entities; membership fees (from private or legal entities); commercial services provided that face no competition; and other types of services provided. Who are the main potential customers of Community Development Banks? Because of its condition as a citizen‚Äôs initiative focused on the development of the area, CDBs are aimed at a public characterized by a high degree of social vulnerability in particular, including (but not limited to) women, youth, merchants, new entrepreneurs, etc. What is the capacity of Community Development Banks? To allow the methodology to work properly, CDBs operate primarily in communities of up to 50,000 inhabitants. It is possible to have more than one functioning CDB in the same community or neighborhood. Social Projects=Bairro Escola de Trabalho (\\"Neighborhood Work School\\") Bairro Escola de Trabalho is a project of practical training, employment and income generation for youth aged 16 to 24 years old in which neighborhood businesses (commercial, service, etc.) train and employ young people in the community. More than 1,000 youth in the neighborhood and surrounding areas had participated within the first three years of the Program‚Äôs implementation. The objective of the Project is aimed toward the development of the district by involving youth living in social exclusion. It is believed that community-strengthening actions such as these have reduced rates of violence among young people from the moment they find themselves valued and integrated into the social and economic life of the community which is simultaneously responsible for the well being of the region where they live. A Bairro Escola student gaining work experience in a neighborhood commercial shop. Innovative Aspects of the Project: * Provides a wide range of vocational courses for young people; * The training is customized: Each business can receive, at maximum, two trainees at a time; * Increases the chances of post-course employment as the students are trained according to the specific needs and characteristics of the enterprises; * The process of professional training is both an opportunity for meeting and integration among the various segments of the community; * Stipends allocated to each student, thereby reducing training costs for the student and enabling the service to reach a greater number of young people. Project Components: # TRAINING/INTERNSHIP - Professional training for students in businesses known as ‚Äútraining enterprises.‚Äù # FINANCING - microcredit line up to R$3,000 granted by Banco Palmas, in partnership with Banco Popular do Brazil, to expand the ‚Äútraining enterprises,‚Äù and another credit line of up to R$15,000 for the incubation of new businesses for students who wish to start a collective productive enterprise. # INCUBATOR - New collective business incubators created by students developing new links in supply chains. Incubadora Feminina (\\"Women Incubator\\") Incubadora Feminina was created by Instituto Palmas in 2001 aimed at women living in the neighborhoods and surrounding areas. The strategy is to integrate these women into the labor market, or have them support themselves by creating self-managerial enterprises to provide them with their own income. As of 2010, Incubadora Feminina had trained 165 women, with a labor market-integration success rate of 60%. Each class defines a vocational focus including 12 months of training with a total average of 940 hours per activity.

PalmaTech PalmaTech is a space which offers various workshops and courses in the area of professional training, business management solidarity, networking and tools for the solidarity economy emphasizing the culture of cooperation. The school is responsible for managing general knowledge about Banco Palmas, including developing teaching materials, publications, and reports. Its central value is societal control over the economy and the market as an area of cooperation, collaboration, and satisfaction of human needs. Escola Popular Cooperativa Palmas \\"The People‚Äôs School of the Palmas Cooperative\\" - Palmas EPC - is a project of Instituto Palmas dedicated to encouraging neighborhood youth pursue higher education. It offers students theoretical knowledge to pass the college entrance exam, development of entrepreneurial skills, and general awareness of participation in community activities and environmental protection. Each class has six months of training, including 600 hours of classroom work. Teachers are usually former students, university students, and teachers of public schools in the district. 1,000 Youth, 10 Ideas 1,000 Youth, 10 Ideas (1,000 Jovens, 10 Id√©ias) is an annual event that collects 1,000 of the neighborhood‚Äôs youth to brainstorm ways in which they think the community can and should be improved. Of these ideas, 10 are chosen to implement in the following year. In June 2009, the community started having discussions about violence in the neighborhood, both regarding the police approach towards this problem, as well as the obvious correlation between drug use and crime. In addition, the community members recognized that the neighborhood lacked cinemas, theaters, sports fields, clubs, and any other spaces of entertainment for community used. From that discussion came the idea of creating an annual forum in which the youth could think of ideas to improve their community and, consequentially, realize them. The theme of the first year of 2009 was aimed at ways to make the neighborhood more enjoyable. The ten ideas on which the community ultimately decided were helped to be made possible by the State Government of Cear√°. In 2010, the theme was ‚Äú1,000 Youth, 10 Ideas to Include My Neighborhood in the 2014 World Cup.‚Äù Since the introduction of the program, Conjunto Palmeira has realized several important ideas from the community. Squares were remodeled, walls have been restored and decorated, training courses were planned and executed, and an art space for young people was created, ‚ÄúPalmeira das Artes.‚Äù  Social Businesses  :Small, formal or informal, businesses funded by Banco Palmas targeted to meet local demands. The projects are independent and interconnected through a solidarity network. They use the logo and performance structures of Banco Palmas. PalmaTur PalmaTur is an inn under the solidarity network of Banco Palmas which promotes alternative, urban community tourism. It was initially created by 20 neighborhood women trained by Instituto Palmas's Incubadora Feminina program to provide services in tourism and retail. Through 12 months of training with a total of 940 hours / activity, PalmaTur emerged. The idea behind PalmaTur is that there exists a Fortaleza beyond the Beira mar; the outskirts of the city too have many features worthwhile for tourists and new residents alike. The wealth from such an enterprise can be shared in a sustainable way, giving back even more to the community. The primary objectives of PalmaTur are to: # Promote Conjunto Palmeira as an alternative tourist destination in Fortaleza, strengthening the local economic development and having as a base the principles of sustainability and solidarity. # Guarantee work and income for the women of the neighborhood by including them in the formal labor pool. Palma Fashion Palma Fashion is a program created to give women suffering from drug addiction, domestic violence, and other setback the chance to learn various skills in the art of fashion in order to give them the opportunity to be their own, productive members of their society. Palma Fashion produces a diverse collection of clothing, handbags, shoes and more. Palma Limpe Palma Limpe PalmaLimpe produces cleaning materials: detergent, disinfectant, bleach, fabric softener and liquid wax, and is composed of youth from the community.

The social currency is accepted at both venues. PalmaNatus PalmaNatus was created in 2005 and works with handmade soaps and herbal products such as syrup, rosemary, and pepper.  FECOL  The Local Social Economic Forum (O F√≥rum Socioecon√¥mico Local ‚Äì FECOL) is a public space for the Conjunto Palmeira community to discuss their voices related to the socioeconomic and cultural issues of the neighborhood and surrounding areas with the underlying purpose to promote the endogenous development of the area. FECOL Among the several decisions made by FECOL in 2010, some of the most important were: * Realizing the \\"Inverse Rally‚Äù (Com√≠cio Inverso) - an event held during local election season when mayoral and council member candidates listened to people of the community speak. During the event, the candidates listened while the neighborhood reported their problems and requested solutions. After the interviews, the candidates received the \\"Platform of the Conjunto,\\" a document including a list of the neighborhood‚Äôs major problems along with accompanying solutions. * Prioritization of two goals for the next two years: : 1) land use regulation for all homes in the neighborhood, and : 2) deployment of a conventional sewer system to replace the current, saturated system. FECOL meets every Wednesday at 7 p.m. at Banco Palmas.

It lends its name from the Bow River, which runs through the city north of the road itself. It runs from downtown Calgary, where the westbound traffic continues from 6 Avenue SW and eastbound traffic becomes 9 Avenue SW, to 85 Street SW. Bow Trail, along with 17 Avenue SW, are two major thoroughfares linking downtown Calgary to the west end of the city. In the late 1960s, there were plans to extend Bow Trail along a more northerly alignment (roughly at the present-day 3 Avenue S) before linking with Memorial Drive east of downtown. Fierce opposition to freeways running through downtown Calgary scuttled the plans, and the C-Train came into favour. History Bow Trail Pedestrian Bridge Prior to it being named Bow Trail, the road west of 33 Street SW was known as Banff Coach Road. The road was rerouted with westbound expansion, with Bow Trail being rerouted on a more southerly route west of Sarcee Trail. The remainder of the road exists today, as Old Banff Coach Road. East of 33 Street SW and west of Crowchild Trail, Bow Trail conformed to Calgary's street numbering conventions, and was known as 12 Avenue SW. 12 Avenue SW continues to exist today, as a frontage road to Bow Trail. In 2004, the city of Calgary conducted a traffic volume study along Bow Trail that found the four lane road inadequate. Consequently, an additional westbound lane was added between 33 Street and Sarcee Trail by 2006. The section between Sarcee Trail and Strathcona Boulevard was widened and landscaped by 2007, while the intersection with Sarcee Trail was improved. Although an interchange with Sarcee has been proposed for many years (with the abandoned \\"Go Plan\\" of the mid-1990s at one point proposing the interchange include a link to a southern extension of Shaganappi Trail), as of 2018 none is planned; the city built one further south at Sarcee and 17th Avenue S.W. in the late 2000s instead. In 2010, construction of the west leg of the C-Train light rail transit system begun along the Bow Trail between Crowchild Trail and 33 Street West. This involved widening Bow Trail east of 33rd Street, and a slight realignment at 33rd and Bow to allow room for the tracks and a tunnel entrance. Construction was completed in December 2012. As of 2015, Bow Trail ends at 85th Street, though the road actually continues for a short way beyond as 12th Avenue S.W., an unpaved rural access road. The City's transportation plan calls for Bow to eventually be extended westward from 85th Street to link with a planned southwestern leg of the Stoney Trail ring road; as of 2015, no official time frame has been announced for construction. The eastern portion of Bow Trail (between Crowchild Trail and 14th Street N.W.) fall within the lands being considered for CalgaryNEXT, a proposed inner-city sports and recreation hub intended to consolidate the city's professional and amateur football and hockey venues (among other uses) in one location; potential rerouting of Bow Trail is among the related infrastructure concerns.

They have recorded more than 25 albums ranging from traditional new-age music and ambient meditative soundscapes to shamanic drumming with Native American flute, Celtic music and world music-influenced electronica. Career The Gordons' first album, Misty Forest Morning, was released in 1982, featuring mainly piano and acoustic guitars, with some synthesizer and sounds of nature they recorded in Sequoia National Forest, the location that was the inspiration for the name of their record label, Sequoia Records Their second album Peaceful Evening and several more albums in a similar style followed soon after, then in 1985 they branched out into electronic spacemusic with Astral Journey and Celestial Suite. In 1987 they returned to nature-inspired music with Garden of Serenity, the first of several releases in their Inner Music series of albums that featured longer meditative compositions. (A sequel, Garden of Serenity II, followed in 1998.) The early 1990s saw another of their electronic spacemusic releases with Music of the Tarot. Beginning in 1994 with Sacred Earth Drums, David & Steve Gordon branched out into world fusion music, adding African, Middle Eastern and Native American drums and percussion plus Native American flute and Incan pan pipes to the mix, along with acoustic and electric guitars, synthesizers, and continuing their use of sounds of nature as musical elements. The song titles and liner notes portrayed the story of a mythical shaman who journeys to the spirit world to find healing for his people and for the Earth. Sacred Earth Drums became the top-selling drumming album in the New Age market for both 1994 and 1995 and by 2002 had sold over 300,000 units.

Through their record label Sequoia Records, they released albums by recording artists Gary Stadler, Wendy Rule, Shajan, Christina Lux, Alquimia and Gleisberg; and several compilations of meditative and world-influenced New Age music including Musical Healing in 2001 and Perfect Balance in 2006. In 2006, the Gordon brothers released Soothing Sanctuary, ambient music with nature sounds, a re-version of the earlier release \\"Sanctuary\\" (so stated in the liner notes) with new arrangements and remastering. Also in 2006 came Shaman's Vision Journey, featuring shamanic drum beats and mantras in the languages of cultures from around the world, including Mayan, Sanskrit, Lakota and Tibetan chants. In 2007 and 2008, they released a pair of 25th anniversary retrospectives, Sound Peace, focusing on meditative selections, and Earth Drum, a collection of drum and native flute tracks packaged with a DVD of wilderness scenery from national parks around the USA set to the music of the compilation album. Earth Drum was awarded the 2009 Coalition of Visionary Retailers awards for Album of the Year and Best World Album. Also in the early 2000s, the Gordons introduced a second record label imprint, Sequoia Groove, specializing in chill-out music compilations, including the Buddha-Lounge series that charted in Billboard in 2004, Cafe de Luna, Hotel Tara, and others; and world music influenced electronica artists including Tya, and Achillea (featuring Jens Gad of Enigma). New recordings by the Gordon brothers in the chillout genre were included in several of these compilations, and in 2008 they released their first album of downtempo electronic music, Yoga Planet, followed by their second album of chillout music in 2009, Nirvana Groove. David & Steve Gordon released two albums of world drum and percussion music in 2009, an upbeat recording titled Drum Cargo: Rhythms of Fire, and an album of quiet drum beats with crystal bowls and native flutes titled Meditation Drum, that according to the liner notes is intended to encourage meditation and relaxation. In 2010 they returned to Native American flute music with the album Gratitude.

Climate  History  On 20 August 1856 Father Malsonneuve set out with four men to open a trail from Lac La Biche by way of Sugden, Ste-Lina and St-Vincent. None of these hamlets were named at the time. The trail soon became a route for the hauling of supplies to northern points on the Athabasca River. The trail wended its way passing east of the present hamlet of Mallaig. The Lac La Biche trail wends its way in a north-westerly direction past a farm owned in 1978 by W. Christensen and north to cross a creek just east of Ste-Lina. A camp was set up for travellers and to water horses before proceeding further. As white settlers traveled this part of Canada and relayed information back East of the furs and timber in the area, the population grew. Surveyors mapped out the land, and it was opened to homesteaders for a nominal fee of $10.00 with certain requirements. St. Lina was named and became a hamlet as well as Goodridge, Beaver River, Sugden, Boyne Lake, McRae and Ashmont.

The term was introduced in the Immigration Act of 1882. The restriction has remained a major cause for denial of visas and lawful permanent residency ever since; in 1992, about half of those denied immigrant and nonimmigrant visas for substantive reasons were denied due to the public charge rule. However, the administrative definition of \\"public charge\\" has been subject to major changes, notably in 1999 and 2019.  Laws regarding immigrants likely to become a public charge  The Immigration Act of 1882 found immigrants who were \\"unable to take care of himself or herself without becoming a public charge\\" unsuitable for American citizenship and therefore denied their entry.Act of August 3, 1882, ch. 376, ¬ß 2, 22 Stat. 214, 214. Quoted in In addition to LPC the act initiated a fifty cent head tax which would be used for bureaucratic processes. The act also denies entry of convicts. The Immigration Act of 1891 continued this exclusion: > [T]he following classes of aliens shall be excluded from admission into the > United States ... All idiots, insane persons, paupers or persons likely to > become a public charge, persons suffering from a loathsome or a dangerous > contagious disease, persons who have been convicted of a felony or other > infamous crime or misdemeanor involving moral turpitude, polygamists‚Ä¶Act of > Mar. 3, 1891, ch. 551, 26 Stat. 1084, 1084. Quoted in The Immigration Act of 1903 allowed the deportation of immigrants who became a public charge within their first two years in the country. In its 1915 decision in Gegiow v. Uhl, the US Supreme Court found that the public charge restriction applied exclusively to those immigrants who \\"by reason of poverty, insanity, disease or disability would become a charge upon the public.\\" The Immigration and Nationality Act (enacted in 1952, and amended in 1965) declares \\"any alien likely at any time to become a public charge\\" as inadmissible to the country and those who have received public benefits within their first five years in the United States as deportable. > Any alien who, in the opinion of the consular officer at the time of > application for a visa, or in the opinion of the Attorney General at the > time of application for admission or adjustment of status, is likely at any > time to become a public charge is excludable.Immigration and Nationality Act > (INA) ¬ß 212(a)(4), 8 U.S.C. ¬ß 1182(a)(4) (1994) Quoted in These INA restrictions often affect decisions about visas and admission to the country, but rarely serve as a cause for deportation. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 raised the standards for sponsors of immigrants, requiring them to show greater financial capacity and obligating them to reimburse the government for means-tested public benefits received by the immigrant they sponsor.  Administrative implementation  Granting of visas to the United States is carried out by consular officials under the Department of State, while awarding immigration statuses such as Lawful Permanent Resident is done by the US Citizenship and Immigration Service (USCIS), and previous by the Immigration and Naturalization Service (INS). Charles Wheeler stated that prior to 1999, \\"DOS and INS officers exercised broad powers in interpreting this provision. Unfortunately, they sometimes applied different standards and imposed inconsistent requirements.\\" Historian Douglas Baynton writes that \\"The 'public charge' provision was intended to encompass people with disabilities more generally and was left to the examining officer's discretion.\\"  1999 Guidance  In May 1999, the Immigration and Nationalization Service issued formal guidance, \\"Field Guidance on Deportability and Inadmissibility on Public Charge Ground,\\" defining a public charge as someone \\"primarily dependent on the government for subsistence, as demonstrated by either the receipt of public cash assistance for income maintenance, or institutionalization for long-term care at government expense.\\"Immigration and Nationalization Service. ‚ÄúField Guidance on Deportability and Inadmissibility on Public Charge Grounds,‚Äù 64 FR 28689 (May 26, 1999). Examples of disqualifying assistance include Supplemental Security Income (SSI), cash assistance from the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) program, and state or local cash assistance programs (often called \\"general assistance\\") for income maintenance. The guidance explicitly excluded Medicaid, food stamps, WIC, unemployment insurance, housing benefits, child care subsidies, or other non-cash benefits from qualifying immigrants as public charges.  2019 Rule  On August 12, 2019, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) formally announced a new rule restricting poorer immigrants from attaining Lawful Permanent Resident status, popularly known as a Green Card. Under the rule, slated to take effect on October 15, 2019, legal immigrants who have received public benefits such as Supplemental Security Income, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, Medicaid, and public housing assistance for more than a total of twelve months within any 36-month period may be classified as a \\"public charge\\" ineligible for permanent residency. Immigration official may investigate the health, income, wealth, education, and family of applicants for permanent residency to predict whether they will become a public charge in the future. The term \\"public charge\\" appears in the Immigration and Nationality Act, but is not defined by the law. Refugees, asylum seekers, pregnant women, children, and family members of those serving in the Armed Forces are excluded from the restrictions. The Trump administration estimates that 58% of households headed by non-citizens use a public welfare program and half use Medicaid. Kenneth T. Cuccinelli II, the acting director of USCIS stated the policy will \\"have the long-term benefit of protecting taxpayers by ensuring people who are immigrating to this country don‚Äôt become public burdens, that they can stand on their own two feet, as immigrants in years past have done.\\" The National Immigration Law Center stated that the rule \\"will have a dire humanitarian impact, forcing some families to forgo critical lifesaving health care and nutrition. The damage will be felt for decades to come.\\" The law center announced it would sue to prevent the policy from taking effect. In January 2020, the US Supreme Court ruled that the Trump administration could begin enforcing the new rules while related lawsuits processed through the federal court system,Bream, Shannon, \\"Supreme Court allows Trump administration to enforce ‚Äòpublic charge‚Äô immigration restriction\\", Fox News, January 27, 2020. and Citizenship and Immigration Services subsequently began enforcement of the public charge rule on February 24, 2020.  Conditions for denial  Individuals who have physical or mental ailments along with pregnant women are most likely to be proposed as a public charge. Immigrants who were found with physical or mental ailments were prospective for exclusion. Their ailments were seen to affect their ability to obtain employment and thus qualified them as a public charge. Unmarried pregnant women seeking to migrate into the United States was presumed a public charge on account of their condition, both in the early twentieth and early twenty-first century. These women were excluded from entry and were barred from arriving into the United States. In recent years, pregnant Mexican women visiting United States doctors present doctor's notes confirming they have prepaid their bills in order to cross the border. In addition childrearing amongst immigrant women is also presumptive causes of public charge. Although support for children was legal undocumented women were denied legal citizenship due to the public assistance that their children received. In these cases and those of physical and mental ailments would render and obligation to government however, the government sought no obligation in this manner. Immigrants who arrived with only twenty-five to forty dollars and with no source of employment were deemed liable to become a public charge. Immigrants were investigated through means of competent evidence. Competent evidence includes the following; *Health *Family assets *Financial status *Education *Skills *Age In the early 1900s, The Book of Instructions for the Medical Inspection of Immigrants listed pregnancy (regardless of marital status), and the sexually transmitted diseases syphilis and gonorrhea as grounds for exclusion. Immigrants who had legally entered the United States but subsequently acquired any ailments that compromised their ability to earn a living were sought for deportation. These individuals had to leave within one year. Funds were distributed for their deportation by the Bureau of Immigration (Immigration Fund).  Notable cases = Maria Gambacurta  In the early 1900s Maria Gambacurta, a twenty-year-old immigrant from Italy who had recently given birth, along with her US citizen child, was deported because the hospital in which they were seeking care was supported through public funds.  Isabel Gonzalez (Gonzalez v. Williams) Upon her arrival in New York City in 1902, Isabel Gonzalez was determined as liable to become a public charge as a young, pregnant, and single Puerto Rican immigrant. She was denied entry into the United States despite the arguments made on her behalf by a fianc√© and family members. Nevertheless, Gonzalez was able to argue her case to the U.S. Supreme Court. Gonzalez did not argue her condition as likely to become a public charge; rather she challenged the state of Puerto Rican immigrants in America claiming citizenship. It was found that she would be considered not an alien under immigration but she would be determined a 'noncitizen national'.  Injunction  Following the recent decision in State of New York, et al. v. DHS, et al., enjoining the DHS from enforcing the new Public Charge Rule, USCIS declared that they will not consider the new rule if petitions are filed on or after July 29, 2020, until further notice. app://www.uscis.gov/i-485  References  # Bray, Ilona M., and Carl Falstrom.

De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas suscepta ab Societate Jesu ... (Latin for \\"On the Christian Mission among the Chinese by the Society of Jesus...\\") is a book based on an Italian manuscript written by the most important founding figure of the Jesuit China mission, Matteo Ricci (1552‚Äì1610), expanded and translated into Latin by his colleague Nicolas Trigault (1577‚Äì1628). The book was first published in 1615 in Augsburg.. The book's full title is De Christiana expeditione apud sinas suscepta ab Societate Jesu. Ex P. Matthaei Riccii eiusdem Societatis commentariis Libri V: Ad S.D.N. Paulum V. In Quibus Sinensis Regni mores, leges, atque instituta, & novae illius Ecclesiae difficillima primordia accurate & summa fide describuntur (\\"The Christian Expedition among the Chinese undertaken by the Society of Jesus from the commentaries of Fr. Matteo Ricci of the same Society... in which the customs, laws, and principles of the Chinese kingdom and the most difficult first beginnings of the new Church there are accurately and with great fidelity described / authored by Fr. Nicolas Trigault, Flemish, of the same Society,\\"Binding Friendship: Ricci, China and Jesuit Cultural Learnings, John J. Burns Library, Boston College dedicated to Pope Paul V). As it indicates, the work contained an overview of the late Ming China's geography, politics, and culture, its philosophy and religions, and described the history of Christianity's inroads into China (primarily, the work of Ricci himself and his fellow Jesuits). The book articulated Ricci's approach for planting Christianity on the Chinese soil: an \\"accommodationist\\" policy, as later scholars called it, based on the premise of the essential compatibility between Christianity and Confucianism. With some evolutionary changes, this policy continued to guide Jesuit missionaries in China for the next century. The first major book published in Europe by an author who was not only fluent in Chinese and conversant in Chinese culture but also had traveled over much of the country, Ricci-Trigault's work was highly popular, and went through at least 16 editions in a number of European languages in the several decades after its first publication. History of the book The book is based primarily on \\"journals\\" written by the Italian Jesuit Matteo Ricci (1552‚Äì1610) during his 27 years of residence of China (1583‚Äì1610). After Ricci's death his papers, written in Italian, were found by his fellow Jesuits in his Beijing office. A handwritten copy was made, as well as a translation into Portuguese. In 1612, the China Mission's Superior, Niccolo Longobardi appointed another Jesuit, Nicolas Trigault (1577‚Äì1628), known for his good Latin writing skills, as the China Mission's procurator (recruitment and PR representative) in Europe. One of his important tasks was bringing Ricci's journals to Europe and publishing them in a book form after translating them into Latin as well as expanding and editing them. He sailed from Macau to India on February 9, 1613 and started to work on the manuscript already on shipboard. Other tasks interfered during the overland section of his westward journey to Europe (via the Persian Gulf, Persia, and Egypt) and his negotiations with the Jesuit leaders in Rome; but he managed to complete his work by 1615, when the book was published in Augsburg in 645 pages, plus introductory and index material. Trigault's preface was dated January 14, 1615.Gallagher (1953), p. xv. French, German, Spanish, and Italian translations followed within the next six years.Gallagher (1953), p. xvii Ricci's original Italian text was not published until the appearance of the Opere storiche del P. Matteo Ricci, S.J (Historical Works of Fr. Matteo Ricci, S.J.) in two volumes in 1911 and 1913. This edition, prepared by the Italian Jesuit historian Pietro Tacchi Venturi, contained Ricci's original text, under the title Commentarj della Cina (Commentary on China), as well as Ricci's letters from China. However, Venturi's lack of knowledge of Chinese made it necessary for Fr. Pasquale d'Elia (1890‚Äì1963) to produce another, better annotated edition of Ricci's manuscripts (known as Fonti Ricciane) some 30 years later, in the 1940s. Notes provided by d'Elia (who had been a Jesuit missionary in China himself) contained the standard (Wade-Giles) transcription and Chinese characters for the Chinese names and words that appeared in Ricci's (and Ricci-Trigault's) text in Ricci's original transcription.\\"Dicion√°rio Portugu√™s-Chin√™s : Ëë°Ê±âËæûÂÖ∏ (Pu-Han cidian): Portuguese-Chinese dictionary\\", by Michele Ruggieri, Matteo Ricci; edited by John W. Witek. Published 2001, Biblioteca Nacional. . Partial preview available on Google Books. P. 179. Excerpts from De Christiana expeditione appeared in English in Purchas his Pilgrimes in 1625, under the title \\"A discourse of the Kingdome of China, taken out of Ricius and Trigautius, containing the countrey, people, government, religion, rites, sects, characters, studies, arts, acts;and a Map of China added, drawne out of one there made with Annotations for the understanding thereof\\".Full text of \\"Hakluytus posthumus\\" on archive.org. Archive.org provides full text scan even though for some reason, the book appears on Google Books only in snippet view. A complete English translation of the Latin text, by the Jesuit Louis J. Gallagher was published in the US in 1942, with the preface and imprimatur of the Archbishop of Boston Richard Cushing. It was reprinted in 1953. The standard Ricci-Trigault's Latin edition, as well as most translations, are divided into five large sections (\\"books\\"). Book One is encyclopedic overview of the late-Ming China as seen by Ricci during his 27 years of living in the country, interacting with people of all walks of life, and reading Chinese literature. The other four books describe, in chronological order, the story of the Jesuit China missions before, during, and a few years after Ricci's \\"expedition\\" into China. China in Ricci's book While the encyclopedic scope of De Christiana expeditione... can be compared to that of The Travels of Marco Polo, or Juan Gonz√°lez de Mendoza's Historia ... del gran reyno de la China (1585), its content reveals the author's much closer familiarity with China's language, culture, and people than that of the 13th-century Venetian traveler or the 16th-century Mexican bishop, because of Ricci's personal experiences and his studies of Chinese literature. In his book, Ricci gives a brief overview of China's history and geography. He talks about its industry and agriculture, explaining the use of bamboo,Gallagher (1953), p. 15 coal mining and distribution system, tea production and drinking,Gallagher (1953), p. 16-17; \\"tea\\" is cia (Ëå∂, cha) in Ricci's transcription and the lacquer technology.Gallagher (1953), p. 17-18; ÊºÜ (qi) is cie in Ricci's transcription He describes Chinese architecture, music and theatre (he disliked the last two), and the practice, annoying to Ricci, of long banquets accompanied by theatrical performances.Gallagher (1953), pp. 21‚Äì23 He tells the reader about using seals for signature and about highly valued writing implements;Gallagher (1953), pp. 23‚Äì24 about artistically painted fans (whose role of a culture item in China he compares to that of gloves in his contemporary Europe) and about surprising similarity between Chinese and European furniture (both regions use chairs, tables, and beds, unlike most of other regions of Eurasia).Gallagher (1953), pp. 24‚Äì25 He concludes his generally appreciative description of China's material culture with the thought, \\"One may gather from what has been said that there are numerous points of advantageous contacts between ourselves and the Chinese people.\\"Gallagher (1953), p. 25 When talking about the language, Ricchi gives a brief overview of Chinese writing system, and the great distance between Literary Chinese and the spoken language as well as of the fact that the Literary Chinese was at the time shared by China, Japan, Ryukyu Islands, Korea, and Vietnam (Cochin), providing a medium for contact between the countries of the region. He comments on the variety of Chinese dialects, as well as on the existence of the Guanhua (the predecessor of modern Standard Chinese), which he thought to be universally known to the educated classes throughout the empire.Gallagher (1953), pp. 26‚Äì29. Guanhua is Quonhua in Ricci's transcription. Ricci pays a lot of attention to China's education system and the Imperial examination mechanism serving to form the scholar-bureaucrats ruling class of the empire,Gallagher (1953), p. 30-41 as well as to the system of state administration.Gallagher (1953), p. 41-59 He notes that unlike European monarchies of the day, the Ming Empire prohibited all male relatives of the emperor from occupying any official post or even from leaving their fiefs without permission,Gallagher (1953), p. 88 and greatly disapproves the use of eunuchs, \\"a meager looking class, uneducated and brought up in perpetual slavery, a dull and stolid lot\\", in the administration of the state.Gallagher (1953), p. 87 Ricci finds it \\"a source of regret that [the Chinese] do not get rid themselves\\" of the complicated and time-consuming ceremonies used to express relations between superiors and inferiors or even between friends.Gallagher (1953), p. 59-77 Ricci's view of Chinese religions Ricci's attitude to China's beliefs and religious (or civic) rites is nuanced. He disparages BuddhismGallagher (1953), pp. 98‚Äì101 and TaoismGallagher (1953), pp. 102‚Äì104, as an \\"unnatural and hideous fiction of idol worship\\"Gallagher (1953), p. 105 but views the teaching of Confucius as moral, rather than religious, in nature and perfectly compatible with or even complementary to Christianity.Gallagher (1953), pp. 93‚Äì98 Buddhism Ricci refers to Chinese Buddhism as the \\"sect... known as Sciequia [ÈáäËø¶ÁâüÂ∞º, Shijiamouni, Shakyamuni] or Omitose [ÈòøÂº•ÈôÄ‰Ωõ, Amituo Fo, AmitƒÅbha]\\", and is aware of it being brought from India, supposedly after an emperor had a prophetic dream in 65 AD. Ricci discerns in Buddhist beliefs a number of concepts that he views as influenced by Western thinking: the Buddhist concept of transmigration of souls is similar to that of Pythagoras, and even the Chinese Five elements are nothing but a \\"foolish\\" extension of the western Four elements. Furthermore, the Jesuit author notices a number of similarities between Buddhist and Christian practices: teaching of rewards and punishments in afterlife, existence of monasticism and appreciation of celibacy, close similarity between Buddhist chanting and Gregorian chant, ecclesiastical statuary and vestments, and even existence in the Buddhist doctrine of \\"a certain trinity in which three different gods are fused into one deity\\".Gallagher (1953), pp. 98‚Äì99. Ricci does not give any further details about the Buddhist counterpart of the Christian Trinity, and D.E. Mungello (1989), who mentions the Trinity comparison (p. 69), does not either. Ricci explains the similarities by hypothesizing Christian influence on Buddhism, as transmitted by Indians to Chinese in 1st century AD, in particular because of the preaching of Bartholomew the Apostle in northern India. Ricci thought that perhaps the emperor's dream in 65 AD, or just \\"reports about the truths contained in the Christian Gospel\\", called him to get Christianity into the country. However, \\"the Chinese received a false importation in place of the truth they were seeking\\". Ricci viewed Buddhist monks (\\"Osciami\\": ÂíåÂ∞ö‰ª¨, Heshangmen) as \\"vile and abject\\".Gallagher (1953), p. 101 Taoism Ricci gives a brief account of the Tausu (ÈÅìÂ£´, Daoshi), the followers of Lauzu (Laozi), and their books \\"written in rather elegant literary style\\". He mentions their three main gods, which, to him, like the \\"Buddhist trinity\\" he had mentioned, is in indication of the \\"father of lies\\" persevering at \\"his ambitious desire of divine similitude\\".Gallagher (1953), pp. 102‚Äì103. Gallagher renders Ricci's Tausu as Taufu (ÈÅìÂ§´, Daofu), but the Italian text published by d'Elia and the Latin text both have Tausu, and Samuel Purchas's 1625 English translation, Taosu. Ricci also gives the story of the \\"present reigning lord of heaven\\" Ciam (Zhang) having usurped that position from the previous Lord, Leu (Liu) and mentions \\"those who have been taken bodily into heaven\\". Elsewhere, the Ciam is described as \\"the original high priest\\" of Taoism,Gallagher (1953), pp. 102‚Äì103; Purchas (1625), p. 462 possibly referring to Zhang Daoling. Confucianism On the other hand, he feels that the teaching of Confucius is moral, rather than religious, in nature and perfectly compatible with or even complementary to Christianity. Occult practices Ricci strongly criticizes alchemy, fortune-telling, palmistry, astrology, and geomancy as \\"absurd superstitions\\" of the heathens.Gallagher (1953), pp. 82‚Äì85, 90‚Äì92. Ricci is annoyed by the \\"addiction\\" of many educated Chinese to alchemy (aiming at prolonging life or converting base metals into silver), particularly because a number of people he met came to him for a wrong reason: hoping to learn the secret of converting mercury into silver. That belief, as Ricci himself explained, was based on the observation that the Portuguese bought a lot of mercury in China, exported it and brought silver back into the country.Mungello (1989), p. 71 De Christiana expeditione apud Sinas may have been the first book to tell Europeans about feng shui (geomancy). Ricci's account tells about feng shui masters (geologi, in Latin) studying prospective construction sites or grave sites \\"with reference to the head and the tail and the feet of the particular dragons which are supposed to dwell beneath that spot\\". Ricci compared the \\"recondite science\\" of geomancy with that of astrology, viewing it as yet another superstitio absurdissima: \\"What could be more absurd than their imagining that the safety of a family, honors, and their entire existence must depend upon such trifles as a door being opened from one side or another, as rain falling into a courtyard from the right or from the left, a window opened here or there, or one roof being higher than another?\\"Gallagher (1953), pp. 84‚Äì85. Trigault's original Latin text of the passage appears in pp. 103‚Äì104 of Book One (Chapter 9) of the original Latin text by Ricci and Nicolas Trigault on Google Books.

Rahr is an American entrepreneur, investor and philanthropist. A billionaire, Rahr was founder and owner of pharmaceutical and generics wholesaler Kinray, the largest privately owned pharmaceutical distributor in the world until it was bought out by Cardinal Health in 2010. Early life and career Stewart Rahr was raised in a Jewish family in Far Rockaway section of Queens, New York. He has an older brother, Elliot. As a youth, he worked at his father's retail pharmacy store in Brooklyn and in 1963, he graduated from Poly Prep Country Day School also in Brooklyn. He graduated with a B.A. from New York University and attended New York University Law School before dropping out to take over his family's pharmacy business which then had $50,000 in sales. As the family business also served as a wholesaler for several other pharmacies, Rahr focused on the wholesaling side of the business. He expanded it into a large operation named Kinray Inc that served over 4,000 pharmacies in the Northeastern United States with revenues of over $5 billion. Rahr was able to grow the business rapidly through the stockpiling of pharmaceuticals, relying on drug price inflation to maximize his profit margin when he sold the extra inventory to retail pharmacies at a later date. This practice later became controversial due to consumer ethics issues, and pharmaceutical manufacturers now monitor their distributors to ensure that they do not hold more than one month's supply of any given drug. In 2010, Rahr sold Kinray to Cardinal Health for $1.3 billion.Dinah Wisenberg Brin, \\"Cardinal Health to Purchase Kinray\\", Wall Street Journal, November 19, 2010 He became a \\"self-made billionaire\\" in this way. In 2020, Forbes ranked Rahr No. 359 on the Forbes 400 list of the richest people in America. Philanthropy In 2012, Rahr donated $640,000 to the Israel Cancer Research Fund, the single largest source of private funds for cancer research in Israel. In late 2012, Rahr donated $100,000 to the Salvation Army for Hurricane Sandy relief efforts. He also donated $50,000 to help repair the Russian American Jewish Experience (RAJE) in Brighton Beach which was also severely damaged by Hurricane Sandy. Rahr is the largest individual donor to the Metro New York chapter of the Make-A-Wish Foundation. In 2013, Rahr donated $10 million to the Make-A-Wish Foundation, the largest contribution in its history. In November 2013, Rahr donated $15 million to the Prostate Cancer Foundation bringing his total contributions to PCF to over $25 million to help find a cure for the disease. In January 2014, Rahr sponsored the flight of 64 members of the Knesset to the memorial service at Auschwitz for Holocaust Remembrance Day.Jewish Journal: \\"Flamboyant billionaire Stewart Rahr wows Israel\\" by Felice Friedson February 3, 2014 On a visit to Israel, Rahr donated 50 ambulances to United Hatzalah, an organization dedicated to improving response time to those in medical need throughout Israel. Rahr made a $500,000 donation to the North Shore Animal League America in 2014. Personal life In 1969, he married Carol K. Rahr. They had two children, Robert and Felicia. In 2012, they announced that they were divorcing. In 2013, Rahr agreed to pay Carol $250 million as a settlement. In November 2012, Rahr was banned from the restaurant Nobu in New York. Rahr has an apartment in the Trump Park Avenue building. In 2005, Rahr purchased a house in The Hamptons for $45 million, reportedly the highest price ever paid in the state of New York for a single- family home. He sold a 32nd-floor apartment at 422 East 72nd Street in 2013. In February 2019, Rahr was identified as the straw purchaser of a portrait of President Trump. According to testimony from Michael Cohen, Rahr bought a nine-foot-tall portrait of Trump from artist William Quigley for $67,000. Trump used funds from his personal foundation to pay back Rahr for the portrait.https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/national-security/michael-cohen- testimony/2019/02/27/089664f0-39fb-11e9-a2cd-307b06d0257b_story.html References Category:American health care businesspeople Category:Jewish American philanthropists Category:Living people Category:1946 births Category:American billionaires Category:Philanthropists from New York (state) Category:People from Far Rockaway, Queens Category:New York University School of Law alumni Category:Poly Prep alumni ","title":"Stewart Rahr"},{"id":"24567708","text":"[Nidamanuru] is a Town of Vijayawada in Krishna district of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.

A classical road movie,Marrakech express at Film-Review.it it was the first installment of Salvatores' trilogia della fuga (\\"escape trilogy\\"), followed by On Tour (1990) and the Academy Award winning Mediterraneo (1991). The cast of the three movies is partly the same; most notably, Diego Abatantuono has a leading role in all of them. The plot revolves around a group of ex-high school friends that reunite in their 30s for a long journey together, and has been compared to Lawrence Kasdan's The Big Chill and Kevin Reynolds' Fandango. The soundtrack, that contributes to the nostalgic atmosphere of the movie, features original songs by blues guitarist and songwriter Roberto Ciotti as well as Italian evergreens from the 1970s such as L'anno che verr√† by Lucio Dalla and La leva calcistica del '68 by Francesco De Gregori. The screenplay was nominated for Premio Solinas. Plot Marco (Bentivoglio) is visited at home by a girl named Teresa (Marsillach) who claims to be the girlfriend of Rudy (Massimo Venturiello), an old college friend of Marco's; she also claims that Rudy is in jail in Morocco (for possession of hashish), and has sent her over to his old friends to collect the 30 million lire that are needed to bribe a judge and return him to freedom. Marco brings together two more members of the old company, Maurizio Ponchia (Abatantuono) and Paolino (Cederna), and they eventually resolve to bring the money to Rudy in Morocco. Ponchia, who is a used car dealer, provides a Mercedes offroad car for the journey. Along the way, they also go and get Cedro, a fourth friend, who has since chosen to live in isolation somewhere on the Alps (inspired by the reading of Kerouac's Desolation Angels). Marco, Ponchia, Paolino, Cedro, and Teresa thus begin their journey through France and Spain and across the Strait of Gibraltar to Marrakech. Once in Marrakech, the four men are shown around by Teresa while they are supposedly waiting for Rudy to get out of jail to meet him. Amongst other things, they experience a turkish bath and have themselves a tattoo. Meanwhile, Teresa has disappeared, and much to their dismay, they realize the money and the car are gone, too. At the time due for Rudy's coming out of jail, another Italian comes out, Salvatore (Ugo Conti) who knows nothing about Rudy or Teresa, but helps them find out the truth, that Rudy was never jailed, and actually lives in an oasis in the desert. The friends resolve to go look for Rudy, Teresa, and their money. Having lost their car, they have to adapt to travelling on a local bus and then by bike. As they try to cross the desert towards Rudy's oasis, fatigue and dehydration eventually knocks them off, but they are timely saved by Rudy himself who brings them to his place. Rudy reveals them that he needed the 30 million to install a drill and start an orange plantation. After a first reaction of anger, the friends enjoy themselves participating in the installation and first activation of the drill, which also marks the end of their journey, and the time to go back to reality. On their way back, the four friends mention reuniting the group somehow (more specifically, reuniting the futsal team); but along the way their enthusiasm fades away as they realize that these plans are not realistic. The group finally disbands as Cedro and Paolino choose to stop over at Cedro's place in the Alps, and Marco and Ponchia drive back home alone.

They then find out that the pipe has been taken by some Moroccans who use it as a pole for a soccer goal. As the Moroccans refuse to give the pipe back, it is eventually settled that it will be the trophy for those who win a soccer game.

Techniques Biophysical chemists employ various techniques used in physical chemistry to probe the structure of biological systems. These techniques include spectroscopic methods such as nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and other techniques like X-ray diffraction and cryo- electron microscopy.

Royal tours of Canada by the Canadian Royal Family have been taking place since 1786, and continue into the 21st century, either as an official tour, a working tour, a vacation, or a period of military service by a member of the royal family. Originally, official tours were events predominantly for Canadians to see and possibly meet members of their Canadian Royal Family, with the associated patriotic pomp and spectacle. However, nearing the end of the 20th century, such occasions took on the added dimension of a theme; for instance, the 2005 tour of Saskatchewan and Alberta by Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was deemed to be a vehicle for the Queen and Canadians to honour \\"The Spirit of Nation Builders.\\" The couple's tour in 2010 was themed \\"Honouring the Canadian Record of Service Past, Present and Future.\\" Official royal tours have always been vested with civic importance, providing a regionalised country with a common thread of loyalty. The first member of the royal family to visit Canada was the future King William IV, who arrived on the country's east coast in 1786 while an officer in the Royal Navy. His niece, Queen Victoria, never came to Canada, but during her reign her son, the future King Edward VII, made the first modern Canadian royal tour: partaking in official engagements, meeting politicians and the public, and reviewing troops. There had been many invitations since 1858 for the reigning monarch to tour Canada, but in 1939 King George VI was the first to do so. During that trip, the King's wife, Queen Elizabeth, initiated the tradition of the \\"royal walkabout\\", though her brother-in-law, the former King Edward VIII, had often met ordinary Canadian people in 1919; as he said: \\"Getting off the train to stretch my legs, I would start up conversations with farmers, section hands, miners, small town editors or newly arrived immigrants from Europe.\\" Royal tours can take more than a year to organize. The planning is coordinated by the Canadian Secretary to the Queen. The regions to be visited are decided by a rotational formula. Modern tours have run with a theme; for instance the visit of Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh in 2010 was intended to highlight \\"the Canadian record of service‚Äîpast, present and future\\"; themes are decided upon by the Queen's secretary together with the Minister of Canadian Heritage and the Office of the Prime Minister. 18th century=1780s St. John's, Newfoundland. Commanding Pegasus from 1786 to 1787, Prince William Henry was the first member of the Royal Family to visit Canada. As an officer in the Royal Navy, Prince William Henry (later William IV) was the first member of the Royal Family to visit Newfoundland Colony, the colony of Nova Scotia, and the Province of Quebec (later Lower and Upper Canada). William's first visit to the colonies was during his command of , a command he was given on 10 April 1786. Arriving in Newfoundland, William found himself involved in the civil and naval affairs of Newfoundland, with no permanent civil authorities, and the newly arrived Prince being the senior naval officer in the colony. During his time in Newfoundland, he presided over a court, and commissioned the construction of St. Luke's Anglican Church in New-Wes-Valley. On 21 August 1786, he celebrated his 21st birthday on his ship in the waters off Newfoundland. He eventually proceeded to the main base of the Royal Navy's North American Station, based at the Royal Naval Dockyards in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Although he received a royal reception upon his arrival to Halifax, it was later made clear he would receive no further special treatment, not already accorded to an officer of his rank in the Royal Navy. William visited the Quebec in 1787, travelling as far inland as Cornwall. While there, he encouraged the United Empire Loyalists to settle the region that later made up Upper Canada. Near Cornwall, he also received a reception from members of the First Nations communities. Following his visit to Quebec, William was stationed in the West Indies. Depressed over the departure of Horatio Nelson, who he befriended during his time in the Caribbean, he took HMS Pegasus to Halifax, without permission from the Royal Navy. William was ordered to winter in Quebec, although he would take his ship back to Britain, arriving in Portsmouth in December 1787. William received his second posting to British North America in July 1788, as the commander of . He served in North America for another year, stationed in cities including Halifax. 1790s Prince Edward with the Star of the Garter, voted to him by the Nova Scotia House of Assembly in 1798. Prince Edward, Duke of Kent and Strathearn became the second member of the Royal Family to tour the Canadian colonies, and the first to live there for an extended period of time. Stationed at Gibraltar in 1790, he requested to be transferred to the Canadian colonies, in an effort to avoid the extreme Mediterranean heat. Arriving in Quebec City in 1791, he came as the colonel for the 7th Regiment of Foot, a military unit garrisoned in Quebec. Shortly after his arrival, Edward was called upon by the Lord Dorchester, the Governor-in-Chief of the Canadas, as 40 First Nations chiefs travelled to Quebec City to complain about American border incursions. Taking advantage of Edward's princely status, the Governor- in-Chief presented the Prince to First Nations' chiefs proclaiming \\"Brothers! Here is Prince Edward, son of our king, who has just arrived with a chosen band of his warriors to protect this country,\\" and subsequently named Edward as second-in-command of British forces in the Canadas. Edward began to tour the Canadas in August 1791, departing from Quebec City to Montreal, Kingston, the Thousand Islands, and Newark-on-the-Lake. Edward returned to Quebec City in time to act as an observer for the election of the first Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada, in Charlesbourg in June 1792. Edward is credited with the first use of the term \\"Canadian\\" to mean both French and English settlers in the Canadas. Witnessing a riot breaking out between two groups at the polling station, he entreated the public in French, \\"I urge you to unanimity and concord. Let me hear no more of the odious distinction of English and French. You are all His Britannick Majesty's beloved Canadian subjects.\\" With the outbreak of the French Revolutionary War, Edward was promoted to Major-General, and ordered to proceed to the Caribbean in January 1794. As the St. Lawrence River was frozen over for the winter, he was to travel overland to Boston, before boarding a ship bound for Martinique. In doing so, he became the first member of the Royal Family to enter the newly- formed United States. Following the West Indies campaign in the spring of 1794, he sailed for Halifax aboard . Arriving on 10 May 1794, he left the city in June to tour Nova Scotia, and the newly-established colony of New Brunswick, visiting Annapolis Royal, and Saint John. He was later made the Commander-in-Chief of the Maritimes. During his time in Nova Scotia, he presided over the expansion of Halifax, and improved the city's defences, due in part to his ability to secure funds from London. He also worked to improve communications between the Canadian colonies, creating the first telegraph signal system in North America, and improving mail service between Halifax and Lower Canada. Edward departed for Britain in August 1800, although he formally maintained his position as Commander-in-Chief of the region until 1802. In 1811, Edward sought to obtain the appointment as the Governor General of the Canadas, although failed to do so. 19th century The 19th century saw the beginning of modern royal tours in the country, with travel becoming easier and faster due to technological innovations such as the steamship, and rail transports. The mid-19th century marked the final time a member of the royal family made a transatlantic crossing by sailing ship; as royal family members began to travel by steamship in the late-19th century. While travelling through Canada, multiple modes of transportation were used when touring within Canada, including rail, on foot, and various-sized water vessels. 1860 royal tour On the 14 May 1859, the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada petitioned Queen Victoria, and other members of the royal family to visit Montreal for the opening of Victoria Bridge. Unwilling to leave London in the hands of rivaling politicians, Victoria instead accepted the Canadian invitation on behalf of her son, Albert Edward, the Prince of Wales (later Edward VII). The Prince of Wales undertook a two-month tour of Newfoundland, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and the Province of Canada in 1860. The Prince of Wales' royal tour was used as the standard model for future royal tours for the next century. =Newfoundland, and Maritime colonies= Albert Edward, Prince of Wales aboard HMS Hero, in St. John's harbour, July 1860. The Prince of Wales reached St. John's, Newfoundland, on 24 July 1860, aboard HMS Hero. The welcome reception the Prince of Wales received set the pattern for other welcome receptions during the royal tour, which typically included an official address at a levee, and a formal ball held in the Prince of Wales' honour. During his time there, he attended the St. John's Regatta, and was gifted a Newfoundland dog on behalf of Newfoundlanders. Travelling from St. John's he arrived in Halifax on 2 August. While in Halifax, he visited the Prince's Lodge, the country home used by his grandfather, the Duke of Kent and Strathearn. From Halifax, the royal party boarded a train and stopped in Windsor, and Hantsport, where they boarded HMS Styx to cross the Bay of Fundy to Saint John. On 4 August, the Prince travelled through the St John River on the steamer Forest Queen to Fredericton. During his time there, he attended a royal reception, and inaugurated a park. Following his visit to Fredericton, he travelled to Pictou, Nova Scotia to board HMS Hero, returning to several communities, including Saint John, and Windsor. He landed at Charlottetown, Prince Edward Island, on 10 August, where he was welcomed by George Dundas, the Governor of Prince Edward Island, and proceeded to Government House. There, he held audience with the Executive Council of Prince Edward Island. Along with formal ball and levee, the Prince toured the countryside around Charlottetown, and visited Province House, where he received an addresses from the Executive Council. Upon his departure, he left with the Governor ¬£150 for charitable use. =Province of Canada= The Prince of Wales dedicating Victoria Bridge in Montreal, as a part of his tour of Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, and the Province of Canada in 1860. The Prince of Wales was formally welcomed into the Province of Canada by a Canadian delegation, who came aboard HMS Hero near Perc√© Rock. The Canadian welcome delegation consisted of the Governor General of the Province of Canada, Edmund Walker Head, and Joint Premiers, George-√âtienne Cartier, and John A. Macdonald. Arriving in Quebec City on 17 August, the Prince knighted Narcisse Belleau, Speaker of the Legislative Council, and Henry Smith, Speaker of the Legislative Assembly. During his time there, he also visited Montmorency Falls, and made an address at the Universit√© Laval. Following his visit to Quebec City, the Prince of Wales proceeded towards Montreal aboard HMS Hero, joined by several members of the Legislative Assembly near Trois-Rivi√®res. Arriving in Montreal, he took a specially-built open railway car to the Victoria Bridge in Pointe-Saint- Charles, and tapped in-place the final-laid stone for the bridge. During his five-day stay in Montreal, he stayed at the viceregal residence Spencerwood, and inaugurated the city's Crystal Palace, recalling the favourable impression made by Canadians at the Great Exhibition in an address to the crowd. At Ottawa, the Prince laid the foundation stone of the parliament buildings, canoed on the Ottawa River, and rode a timber slide on the Chaudi√®re Falls. Travelling towards Toronto aboard the steamer Kingston, visits were planned for Belleville, and Kingston, although anti-Catholic demonstrators from the Orange Order prevented the Prince from disembarking. In an attempt to not embroil the Prince in a controversy, Henry Pelham-Clinton, the Under-Secretary of State who joined the Prince on his tour, informed mayors that they would not disembark until the demonstrators were dispersed. Sailing further west, the Prince visited Cobourg, Rice Lake, and Peterborough, where he received a reception from the Mississaugas. He then proceeded to Port Hope, re-boarding Kingston to sail on to Toronto. During a levee in Toronto, the Prince received a delegation from Belleville and Kingston, tending apologies for the early incident. On 10 September, he took a one-day excursion to Collingwood, before returning to Toronto the following day. On his way back, he visited and received addresses from Aurora, Barrie, Bradford, and Newmarket. In Toronto, the Prince attended the Royal Canadian Yacht Club's regatta, agreeing to become its patron; and opened Allan Gardens, and Queen's Park to the public. He departed the city for London, Ontario on 12 September, visiting Guelph and Stratford on the way. From London, he travelled to Sarnia, in order to attend a gathering of 150 First Nations representatives in the Province of Canada. Following this gathering, he briefly returned to London, before travelling by railway to the Niagara Peninsula. The Prince of Wales touring Niagara Falls, Canada West, September 1860. In the peninsula, he visited Brantford, Chippewa, Fort Erie, and Queenston. The Niagara Falls were illuminated for the first time during his tour of the falls. There, he rode on the Maid of the Mist. At Queenston, he met with 160 War of 1812 veterans, dedicated a rebuilt Brock's Monument, and visited Laura Secord. From Queenston, he moved towards Niagara- on-the-Lake, St. Catherines, and Hamilton. Completing his royal tour of the Province of Canada in late-September, the Prince of Wales departed for the United States from Windsor, Ontario. Taking a month-long personal tour of the United States, he travelled under the pseudonym \\"Lord Renfrew,\\" in an attempt to not attract attention to himself. The Canadian co-premieres saw-off the Prince's during his departure from Canada, and again from the United States, travelling to Portland, Maine on 20 October 1860 to see the Prince off. 1861‚Äì1883 In 1861, Prince Alfred took a five-week tour of The Maritimes, Newfoundland, and the Province of Canada. While escorting Prince Alfred through Canada West, the Governor General of Canada used the opportunity to make sketches of American defences around the Great Lakes. From 1869 to 1870, Prince Arthur was stationed in Canada as a British Army officer in the Rifle Brigade's Montreal detachment. Arriving in Halifax, he undertook a two-month royal tour of the colony of Prince Edward Island, and the newly formed Dominion of Canada, before returning to military duty in Montreal. In the same year, the Six Nations of the Grand River conferred the title of chief to Prince Arthur. In a formal ceremony, the chief of the three \\"clans\\" of the Mohawks received The Prince, and conferred upon him the name \\"Kavakoudge,\\" meaning \\"the sun flying from east to west under the guidance of the Great Spirit.\\" Although the title of chief was bestowed as an honourary title to a number of individuals, Alfred underwent the necessary rituals to formalize the title in Mohawk society. During his 1869 royal tour, Prince Arthur met with the Chiefs of the Six Nations at the Mohawk Chapel. During his time in Canada, Prince Arthur became the first member of the royal family to attend the opening of the Canadian parliament, in February 1870. Prince Arthur, along with his regiment, was present at the Battle of Eccles Hill, a raid conducted by the American-based Fenian Brotherhood, on 25 May 1870. The Prince was awarded the Canada General Service Medal for his participation in the Fenian raids. Returning to the United Kingdom in 1870, Prince Arthur would return to Canada on two more occasions, the latter visit as the Governor General of Canada. Other members of the royal family were also in Canada as a part of their military service during the late-1870s and early-1880s. Prince Alfred was stationed at Royal Naval Dockyard, Halifax from time to time between 1878 and 1883, as Commander of the Royal Navy's North Atlantic Squadron. Prince George of Wales (later George V) was stationed in the Maritimes in 1882 as a midshipman on HMS Cumberland. During his time there, he drove the last spike into Newfoundland's first railway, the Harbour Grace Railway. =Princess as the viceregal consort (1878‚Äì1883)= In 1878, Benjamin Disraeli, the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, requested the Marquess of Lorne be appointed the next Governor General of Canada, with his wife, Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll serving as the viceregal consort of Canada. Disraeli's nomination of Lorne was largely motivated by his desire to see a member of the royal family reside in Canada for an extended period. Prior to his appointment as the Canadian Governor General, Lorne was virtually unknown to the public, with little concrete record of public service. The attraction for appointing Lorne to the office was having his spouse, Princess Louise, reside in Canada. Princess Louise accompanies the Marquess of Lorne, the Governor General of Canada during the opening the 4th Canadian Parliament, 1879. Arriving in Canada on 23 November 1878, the viceregal couple was greeted by Prince Alfred, who was serving as a Royal Navy officer, stationed in Halifax. Lorne was formally sworn in as the Governor General in Province House, Halifax, before they proceeded towards the capital, in Ottawa. Arriving in Ottawa on 2 December, the head of the Canadian ministry, John A. Macdonald, was not present at the viceregal welcome reception. Macdonald's absence from the welcome reception was depicted as a purposeful insult to the princess by the opposition Liberal Party. They proceeded to take a private trip to Niagara Falls in January 1879, before returning to Ottawa to open the 4th Canadian Parliament, on 13 February 1879. They undertook an official tour of Eastern Canada from mid-May 1879, touring Montreal during Victoria Day, awarding prizes to officer cadets of the Royal Military College of Canada in Kingston. On 9 June, they opened Terrasse Dufferin in Quebec City, and later laid the cornerstone of Porte Kent, gifted to the city from Queen Victoria. Following their tour of Quebec, they proceeded towards The Maritimes and Ontario. In Toronto, they opened the first Canadian National Exhibition, and attended the Queen's Plate. During their time in Ottawa, both Lorne and Louise worked towards the creation of a national arts association, establishing the Royal Canadian Academy of Arts in 1880. On 14 February 1880 in Ottawa, Princess Louise was injured after her horse-drawn sleigh was turned over. Hitting her head on the metal frame of the sleigh, Louise suffered from neuralgia after the incident. The public was not made aware of the event, with the aide-de- camp to the Governor General downplaying the incident to the press. She did not make another public appearance until April 1880. While recovering, she was visited by her brother Prince Leopold. Louise and Leopold privately toured Quebec, Ontario, and the American city of Chicago until 31 July 1880, when both returned to the United Kingdom. Princess Louise and the Marquess of Lorne visiting a street market in Ottawa around Christmas, c. 1880s. During Lorne's 1881 tour of the Northwest Territories, he proposed a section of the territory take its Alberta after his wife (whose full name was Louise Caroline Alberta). Similarly, Princess Louise was the one who proposed the name for Regina, from the Latin word for Queen. Louise returned to Canada until 4 June 1882, although rumors of a Fenian plot against her forced her to remain in the Citadelle of Quebec, a military installation used by the Canadian militia, and the secondary residence for the Monarch, and the Governor General. On 30 August, Lorne and Louise set out for an official tour of British Columbia, visiting Victoria, and meeting with a First Nations delegation in New Westminster. Louise remained in Victoria as Lorne continued with the official tour into the British Columbia Interior. They remained in the province until 7 December 1882, with their tour extended to counter secessionist sentiments in the province, a result of the federal government's failure to produce a transcontinental rail link by 1881. Robert Beaven, the Premier of British Columbia was said to have suggested the province secede from Canada, and establish an independent kingdom with Louise as its Queen. The resulting crisis had spurred Lorne to push the Canadian government to hasten the development of the Canadian Pacific Railway. Louise was visited by another member of the royal family, Prince George of Wales, in April 1883. Shortly before the end of his fifth year as Governor General, Lorne declined an option to serve the position for another year. His decision to turn down an additional year in office was questioned by some, with Queen Victoria suspecting that Lorne was jealous of Louise's popularity with Canadians, in contrast to his own. The Marquess and Princess Louise concluded their term in Canada with a farewell tours in Montreal, and Toronto, leaving for the United Kingdom from Quebec City on 27 October 1883. 1884‚Äì1900 In 1890, Prince Arthur conducted another tour of Canada, arriving in British Columbia from his earlier service with the British Army in the British Raj. During this tour, he travelled east towards the Maritimes, primarily by railway, before continuing on to the United Kingdom. Princess Marie Louise arrived in Canada in 1900 to tour the country, however controversy surrounding her spouse, Prince Aribert of Anhalt forced her to return to the United Kingdom shortly after her arrival. After Prince Aribert was found in bed with another man, his father, Frederick I, Duke of Anhalt, accused Marie Louise of indecency, claiming that his son was denied his conjugal rights. Marie Louise was at Rideau Hall when the Governor General gave her two telegrams instructing her to return to the United Kingdom immediately. Her marriage with Prince Aribert was annulled in December 1900, with his father using his prerogative as a reigning Duke of Anhalt to annul the marriage. Early 20th century (1901‚Äì1950)=1900s1901 royal tour= Prince George in Montreal and Quebec City. He visited most of the provinces during his 1901 royal tour. The first royal tour to take place since the death of Queen Victoria was conducted by the second son of the reigning king, Prince George, Duke of Cornwall and York (later George V), his spouse, Mary, Duchess of Cornwall and York (later Queen Mary), and the Duchesses brother, Prince Alexander of Teck (later the Earl of Athlone). The tour in Canada formed a part of a larger eight-month royal tour of the British Empire that began on 16 March 1901, with the Duke and Duchess' departure from Portsmouth, United Kingdom. The Canadian portion of the tour was originally planned to begin in British Columbia, proceeding eastward through the country. However, after South Africa was added onto the royal tour, the decision was made to begin to the royal tour in Quebec City, and conclude it in Halifax. As the period of court mourning for Queen Victoria's death had not yet expired during their time in Canada, public balls, banquets, and levees planned for the royal tour were cancelled, with only official dinners, concerts, receptions, and reviews taking place. During the tour, Prince George kept a methodical record of his activities, recording that he shook the hands of 24,855 people at official receptions; received 544 addresses; laid 21 cornerstones; gave 100 speeches; and presented 4,329 medals. The Canadian portion of the 1901 royal tour began 16 September 1901, when the arrived in Quebec City. The royal partywhich consisted of 22 people, landed at Quebec City on 16 September. During his time in Quebec City, Prince George invested Lieutenant Richard Ernest William Turner with the Victoria Cross for his conduct during the Battle of Leliefontein in a ceremony at the Plains of Abraham, and spoke to students at the Universit√© Laval. Moving west of Quebec City by railway, the group made stops to Montreal, and Ottawa. Throughout the royal tour, Prince George placed an emphasis on praising the creation, and expansion of the country during his own lifetime, giving a speech about the country's development and growth in Ottawa and Winnipeg. The royal party rides a timber slide near Ottawa during the 1901 royal tour. In Ottawa, Prince George dedicated the Alexandra Bridge in Ottawa, rode a timber slide, and watched the lacrosse final for the Minto Cup, a match he enjoyed so much he kept the ball that was used. Departing from Ottawa, they passed through Ontario, creating \\"incredible excitement seldom seen since the visit of his father in 1860.\\" The Duke and Duchess arrived in Manitoba where the former opened the new science building at the University of Manitoba, and then to Regina in the Northwest Territories. In Calgary, they met with First Nations chiefs and viewed exhibitions, before concluding their western-leg of their tour in Vancouver and Victoria. They group then turned back again towards Banff, where the Duchess went to Tunnel Mountain and Lake Louise, while the Duke went to Poplar Point. After passing back through Regina, they reunited in Toronto, welcomed by the Toronto Mendelssohn Choir, and attended concerts at Massey Hall. They proceeded to tour throughout Southern Ontario, before returning to Montreal, where the Duke opened the newly rebuilt Victoria Bridge. The Canadian tour ended with a trip through Saint John, and their departure from Halifax. Following their departure from Halifax, the global royal tour proceeded towards Newfoundland, a separate colony not associated with Canada at the time. In Newfoundland, they received nine-month old Newfoundland dog, which was later given their son, Prince Edward (later Edward VIII). =Tercentenary of Quebec City (1908)= George, Prince of Wales attending a military review for the Canadian militia, 24 July 1908 In 1908 the Canadian government asked King Edward VII to preside over the tercentenary celebrations for the founding of Quebec City. Edward VII would accept the invitation on behalf of his son, George, Prince of Wales (later George V). The Prince of Wales arrived at Quebec City aboard the Royal Navy cruiser, . Unlike his earlier tour in 1901, his royal tour in 1908 was limited to the ceremony in Quebec City, as well as a military review of the Canadian militia on the Plains of Abraham. 1910s From 1911 to 1916, Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn served as Canada's Governor General, with the Duchess of Connaught and Strathearn serving as his viceregal consort. The Duke was the first member of the royal family to serve the office of Governor General of Canada. Originally his appointment was for only two-years, although at the request of Robert Borden, the Prime Minister of Canada, his tenure would later be extended to five-years. The Duke, Duchess, and their daughter, Princess Patricia of Connaught, arrived in Quebec City on 13 October 1911 and was later sworn into office at the Parliament of Quebec. Several weeks after being sworn in, he presided over the opening of the Parliament of Canada in Ottawa. The Duke and Duchess conducted his first tour as Governor General in 1911, proceeding to Toronto, Hamilton, Kingston, and finally Montreal on 27 November 1911. Further tours with the Duke, and Princess Patricia, were undertaken in May 1912, to Winnipeg, and the Maritimes. On 28 August 1912, the Duke, Duchess, and their daughter conducted a tour of the west, visiting Sault Ste. Marie, Saskatoon, Prince Albert, Edmonton, Calgary, Banff, Vancouver, Prince Rupert, and Victoria, where they inspected personnel of the Royal Canadian Navy at Esquimalt Royal Navy Dockyard.

He served the position from 1911 to 1916. While serving as the Governor General, the Duke inaugurated the Saskatchewan Legislative Building, and laid the cornerstone for the Cathedral of St. John the Evangelist in Regina, and for the new Provincial Library at the British Columbia Parliament Buildings. The Duke returned to Banff on two occasions, in August 1914, and May 1916. In addition to Canada, he also visited Newfoundland, a separate dominion of the British Empire in 1914. In 1913, Prince Albert (later George VI) conducted his first royal tour of the Canada, as well as Newfoundland, while serving aboard the Royal Navy cruiser . In January 1913, the Duchess was hospitalized as a result of her declining health, with the viceregal family returning to London, UK, in March 1913. During this period, the Duke, continuing to serve as Governor General, received regular correspondences from Borden through telegraph. After the Duchess recovered, the family returned to Canada in October 1913. During World War I, the Duke was involved in recruitment, and raising the morale of soldiers. Princess Patricia worked for the Canadian Red Cross, and continued working for a Canadian hospital in Orpington, UK, after her father's term as Governor General ended in 1916. Several months after Centre Block on Parliament Hill was ravaged by a fire, the Duke laid the memorial cornerstone for its replacement on 1 September 1916. The Duke's tenure as Governor General ended on 16 October 1916. =1919 royal tour= Edward, Prince of Wales with two Ojibwe guides, canoe on the Nipigon River during his 1919 royal tour. After the end of World War I in November 1918, Edward, Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII) set out to develop his role as the Prince of Wales through a tour of the Empire, with his first tour occurring in the dominions of Newfoundland and Canada in 1919. Organization for the tour was undertaken by Joseph Pope, the Assistant Clerk to the Privy Council for Canada. Unlike earlier tours, the 1919 royal tour dropped the rigid formalities of earlier tours, partly due to authorities' inability to control the crowds who came to see the Prince. The informality of the tour was matched by the Prince of Wales, whose informal dress, and mannerisms had struck the right note with Canadians. Boarding on 5 August 1919, Edward proceeded towards St. John's, Newfoundland, and Charlottetown, before proceeding towards Quebec City on 21 August 1919. Proceeding towards Ontario, he laid the foundation stone of the Peace Tower on Parliament Hill, met with the League of Canadian Indians at Sault Ste. Marie, and took a three-day canoe trip down the Nipigon River to fish and hunt with two Ojibwa guides. On the 26 August, he inaugurated Warriors' Day at the Canadian National Exhibition.

He then proceeded towards Vancouver, toured the area, attended a civic reception and military ball, as well as opening the New Westminster Exhibition. While in Alberta, he was named Chief Morning Star by the Chiefs of the Nakoda First Nations. The Prince also went on to Victoria, where he laid the foundation stone of a statue of Queen Victoria on the grounds of the British Columbia Parliament Buildings. 1920s and 1930s Prince George at Rideau Hall (seated, fifth and sixth from the left, respectively), during their 1927 royal tour. In 1923, the Prince of Wales was in Canada on a visit, and work on his privately owned ranch, E. P. Ranch. Arriving at Quebec City on 12 September, he made stops in Ottawa and Winnipeg before reaching his private ranch near Calgary, known as E. P. Ranch. He made another private visit to his ranch in 1924, as well as touring as well various towns and cities; in the latter year, he stopped at Rideau Hall for various official functions and again frustrated his staff by disappearing for dancing and golf. In 1926, the brother to the Prince of Wales, Prince George (later Duke of Kent), arrived in Canada and actively took part in squash, badminton, and tennis games played in Rideau Hall's Tent Room; the Governor General, The Marquess of Willingdon, said of the Prince: \\"Such a nice boy, but shy, & as mad ib exercise as the P. of W.\\" Prince George, along with the Prince of Wales, conducted another royal tour of Canada in 1927. During the tour, the Prince of Wales and Prince George opened Union Station and the Princes' Gates in Toronto. =1939 royal tour= King's Plate in Toronto, during the 1939 royal tour. The 1939 royal tour of Canada was a cross-Canada royal tour by King George VI and Queen Elizabeth. It was one of the first visits of a reigning monarch to Canada (in 1926, Queen Marie of Romania also visited the country). This tour marked the first time that the sovereign's official Canadian birthday was marked with the monarch himself present in the country; the occasion was marked on Parliament Hill with a celebration and a Trooping of the Colour. During another Canadian tour in 1985, Queen Elizabeth, then the Queen Mother, stated in a speech: \\"It is now some 46 years since I first came to this country with the King, in those anxious days shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War. I shall always look back upon that visit with feelings of affection and happiness. I think I lost my heart to Canada and Canadians, and my feelings have not changed with the passage of time.\\" 1940s Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone, resided in Canada from June 1940 to April 1946 as the viceregal consort of Canada; accompanying her spouse, Alexander, Earl of Athlone, who was sworn in as the Governor General of Canada on 21 June 1940. Another royal relative, Alastair, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn, resided in Canada from 1940 as the aide-de-camp to the Governor General. On 23 April 1943, Alastair was found dead on the floor of his room at Rideau Hall. He had died from hypothermia. Newspapers at the time cited the cause of death as \\"natural causes.\\" Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone with the Earl of Athlone and William Lyon Mackenzie King, March 1946 In 1941, Prince George, Duke of Kent visited several Royal Canadian Air Force bases in Canada. In the same year, Edward, the Duke of Windsor (formerly Edward VIII) visited Canada to stay at his private ranch in Alberta. He entered Canada at North Portal, before proceeding towards Calgary the next day. As the visit was only few years removed from the 1936 abdication crisis, he was initially discouraged from visiting by the Canadian Prime Minister, William Lyon Mackenzie King. However, King would later send Edward a telegram welcoming him shortly after he entered the country. Edward departed Canada after spending nine days there, summoned back to the Bahamas as its governor, after a hurricane struck the islands. Edward would visit Canada on two more occasions, visiting New Brunswick in 1945, and Alberta in 1950. During his time in Alberta, Edward slept at the viceregal suite of the Palliser Hotel in Calgary; as the state of his ranch had deteriorated in the years since his last visit. In 1945, Edward sought the appointment as the Governor General of Canada, although failed to obtain it. By 1945, Alan Lascelles, the private secretary of George VI, and Shuldham Redfern, Secretary to the Governor General of Canada, were discussing the idea of the King making regular flights to Canada to open parliament and perform other constitutional and ceremonial duties. The notion was eventually forgotten. Late 20th century (1951‚Äì2000)=Elizabeth II Elizabeth II conducted 20 official tours of Canada from 1951 to 2000. She first toured Canada in 1951, as Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh. In her subsequent tours of the country, she toured it as the Queen of Canada. In addition to official tours, in the 20th century, the Queen had made nine stopovers in Canada, in order to refuel the aircraft she was travelling on. =1950s= Princess Elizabeth along with Prince Philip during their 1951 royal tour. Princess Elizabeth, Duchess of Edinburgh, and her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, made their first appearance in Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, Nova Scotia, Quebec, Ontario, Saskatchewan, British Columbia, and Alberta in 1951, on behalf of her ailing father. The National Film Board of Canada produced a documentary film Royal Journey, chronicling the 1951 royal tour. The couple toured New Brunswick; after the Princess and Duke arrived at Fredericton's Union Station on 6 November, they were there greeted by both Lieutenant Governor David Laurence MacLaren and hundreds of well-wishers, and moved on to tour the University of New Brunswick, Christ Church Cathedral, and the Legislative Assembly Building. It was then on to Saint John, where the royal couple travelled in a motorcade watched by some 60,000 people, visited a veterans' hospital, and attended a civic dinner at the Admiral Beatty Hotel, where the silver flatware designed specifically for the 1939 visit of the King was used. After an overnight on the royal train, Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh made whistle- stops in Moncton and Sackville before departing the province. In Toronto, she took in a Toronto Maple Leafs game at Maple Leaf Gardens and greeted Ontarians at numerous official functions. Aside from a brief stop-over for refuelling in Gander, Newfoundland in 1953 during which the Queen decided, after being roused from sleep at 3:20 am by their singing of \\"For She's a Jolly Good Fellow\\", to address the crowd gathered outside, opening of the 23rd Canadian Parliament, 14 October 1957. Elizabeth returned to Canada in 1957, there giving her first ever live television address, appointing her husband to her Canadian Privy Council at a meeting which she chaired, and on 14 October, opening the first session of the 23rd parliament. About 50,000 people descended on Parliament Hill to witness the arrival of the monarch. Due to the financial austerity of the times, the pageantry was muted in comparison to what would be seen at a similar event in the United Kingdom. June Callwood said in her coverage of the tour for Maclean's: \\"The Queen's role in Canada, it appeared to some observers, hinged on calculated pageantry, just enough to warm the pride of Canadians who revere tradition and stateliness above state but not so much as to antagonize those who consider royalty a blindingly off- colour bauble in an age of lean fear.\\"Callwood, June; Maclean's Magazine: June Callwood's Story of the Queen's Visit; Vol. 70; December 1957; p. 16 In Saskatchewan, the Queen inaugurated the natural gas-fired Queen Elizabeth Power Station on the South Saskatchewan River. Two years later, in 1959 the Queen returned and toured every province and territory of the country; Buckingham Palace officials and the Canadian government opted to dub this a \\"royal tour\\", as opposed to a \\"royal visit\\", to dispel any notion that the Queen was a visiting foreigner. Controversy arose in the run-up to the visit when CBC personality Joyce Davidson, while being interviewed by Dave Garroway on NBC's Today Show, said that as an \\"average Canadian\\" she was \\"pretty indifferent\\" to the Queen's forthcoming visit. Davidson was lambasted in the Canadian press and by many indignant Canadians for her comment. Regardless, the Queen toured the entire country, specifically directing that events she attended should be public, rather than closed luncheons or receptions; further, popular Canadian athletic stars were invited to royal events for the first time, so that during her tour the Queen met with Jean B√©liveau, Sam Etcheverry, Maurice Richard, Punch Imlach, and Bud Grant. One of the most important events of this trip was the official opening of the St. Lawrence Seaway, along with President Dwight D. Eisenhower, where, in Prescott, Ontario, the Queen made her first live appearance on Canadian television. During this tour, the Queen paid numerous visits to Canadian industries, and again made a visit to the United States as Canada's head of state, stopping in Chicago and Washington, D.C., with Diefenbaker as her attending minister. The Prime Minister insisted that the Queen be accompanied at all times by a Canadian Cabinet minister, being determined to make it clear to Americans that the Queen was visiting the United States as the Canadian monarch, and that \\"it is the Canadian embassy and not the British Embassy officials who are in charge\\" of the Queen's itinerary. Her speeches in Chicago, written by her Canadian ministers, stressed steadily the fact that she had come to call as Queen of Canada. In this vein, the Queen hosted the return dinner for Eisenhower at the Canadian Embassy in Washington. Yonge and Front Street, Toronto, during her 1959 royal tour. The Queen returned to New Brunswick, at the end of her pan-Canada tour. The sovereign presided over a Queen's Scout recognition ceremony in Fredericton, visited the veterans' hospital in Lancaster, and undertook a walkabout in Victoria Park, Moncton. At Pointe-du- Ch√™ne, the royal couple visited briefly with the families of fishermen who had died the previous month in a storm off Escuminac, making a donation to the New Brunswick Fisherman's Disaster Fund that was established in honour of the deceased. Unknown to all involved, the Queen was pregnant with her third child. Prime Minister Diefenbaker urged her to cut the tour short after her disclosure to him at Kingston, Ontario, but the Queen swore him to secrecy and continued the journey, leaving the public announcement of the upcoming birth until she returned to London. Once the news was released, criticism of the tour that had simmered during its progress unleashed in full: Diefenbaker was blamed for pushing the Queen to carry on a grueling continent-wide trip, and the brevity of stops necessary to complete such a journey, combined with the formality and inaccessibility of events, led to calls for a cease to that format of royal tour. The Albertan stated: \\"The fact is that royalty has no roots in Canada. And if roots must be put down, they certainly should be of a different kind than those which are historically proper for Britain.\\" Prior to the tour, the President of the Saint-Jean-Baptiste Society, with the support of the Mayor of Quebec City, requested of the tour officials that, on the evening of Saint-Jean-Baptiste Day, Her Majesty light the main bonfire in celebration. Though the Queen did lay a wreath at the James Wolfe Monument on the Plains of Abraham, the Queen's Canadian Secretary at the time, Howard Graham, left the bonfire off the itinerary, leading to complaints. Successes were also noted, especially in the Crown's assistance in entrenching the newly emerging Canadian identity; the Queen ensured that the Red Ensign (then Canada's de facto national flag) was flown on the royal yacht, and she stood to attention for the duration of each playing of \\"O Canada\\", the country's then still unofficial national anthem, sometimes even joining in the singing. =1960 to 2000= The Queen walks with John Clyne, the Chancellor of the University of British Columbia during her 1983 royal tour of Canada. Queen Elizabeth II also celebrated the centennial of the Confederation Conferences in Charlottetown on 6 October 1964. On 10 October, as she was touring the streets of Quebec City, a turbulent riot occurred and opposed anti-monarchist Quebec nationalists with the police. Since then, the event has been known as Samedi de la matraque (\\"Truncheon Saturday\\"). In 1971, the Queen was in British Columbia to celebrate the centennial of the province's entry into Confederation. She toured Alberta and Saskatchewan in July 1973, to celebrate the centennial of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, opening the new RCMP museum building in Regina, and in 1978, to open the Commonwealth Games in Edmonton.

While at the Legislative Building, the Queen issued a Royal Warrant augmenting the province's coat of arms with its present crest, supporters, compartment, motto. She also, when in Fredericton, unveiled a plaque in Wilmot Park that honoured Edward Wilmot and recounted the dedication of the park by the Queen's great-grandfather.

The scandal provoked much public and literary conjecture and irreparably tarnished King James I's court with an image of corruption and depravity. There are variations in the spelling of Helwys: Helwis, Helwiss, Helewyse, Helwysse, Yelwys, Ellowis, Elwys, Elwis, Elvis, Elwes, and Elwaies. Background Gervase Helwys was born on 1 September 1561 in Saundby, Nottinghamshire, the first child of parents John Helwys (1535‚Äì1600) and Mary Blagden of Thames Ditton. His cousin, Thomas Helwys (1575‚Äì1616), one of the joint founders, with John Smyth, of the Baptist denomination, was thrown into Newgate Prison by the king for libel, where he died in 1616. As a student Helwys studied law at Middle Temple after completing his studies at New Inn, at the University of Oxford. His uncle, Geoffrey Helwys, a successful merchant, Alderman and Sheriff of London, was also a member of the Inn. Soon after, he married Mary Brooke, daughter of Thomas Brooke of Norfolk. On 7 May 1603, Helwys was knighted by King James I. A decade later, on 6 May 1613, he was appointed by the same king as Lieutenant of the Tower of London after being recommended to the post by Henry Howard, 1st Earl of Northampton. As was common practice at the time, Helwys had to pay for the title, in this instance ¬£2,000; ¬£1,400 going to Northampton and ¬£300 to Sir Thomas Monson, Master of the Armory in the Tower and a friend of Helwys'.\\"Sir William Waad, Lieutenant of the Tower, and the Gunpowder Plot\\" by Fiona Bengtsen; Victoria, B.C.: Trafford, 2005 Whilst there, Helwys had been involved on 10 March 1614 in the \\"examination\\" of prisoner Edmond Peacham, a rector of Hinton St. George who had been charged with having written a libel against the king, at the request of the king's Attorney general, Sir Francis Bacon.\\"The letters and the life of Francis Bacon including all his occasional works: namely letters, speeches, tracts, state papers, memorials, devices and all authentic writings not already printed among his philosophical, literary, or professional works\\" by Francis Bacon; James Spedding. London: Longman, Green, Longman, and Roberts, 1861‚Äì1874. Overbury Affair Portrait of Sir Thomas Overbury by Renold Elstracke, c. 1615-1616 When his Secretary of State, the Earl of Salisbury, died in 1612, the king had the notion of governing in person as his own chief Minister of State, with his young Scottish favourite, Robert Carr carrying out many of Salisbury's former duties. But James's inability to attend closely to official business exposed the government to factionalism.Willson, pp 334‚Äì5. The Howard party, consisting of Henry Howard; Thomas Howard, 1st Earl of Suffolk; his son-in-law William Knollys, 1st Earl of Banbury; Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham, and Sir Thomas Lake, soon took control of much of the government and its patronage. Even the powerful Carr, hardly experienced for the responsibilities thrust upon him and often dependent on his intimate friend Overbury for assistance with government papers,Willson, p 349; Perry, p 105. fell into the Howard camp. He had done this after beginning an affair with the married Frances Howard, Countess of Essex, daughter of the Earl of Suffolk, whom James assisted in securing an annulment of her marriage to free her to marry Carr.Lindley, p 120. Seeing as Overbury distrusted the Howards and still had Carr's ear, he tried to prevent the marriage. To remove him from court, the Howard faction manipulated Overbury into seeming to be disrespectful to the queen. Then it was no small feat to persuade the king to offer Overbury an assignment as ambassador to the court of Tsar Michael of Russia, with the Howards being fully aware that his refusal would be seen as tantamount to treason. The plan worked and Overbury declined, sensing the urgency to remain in England and at his friend's side. On 22 April 1613, Overbury was placed in the Tower at the king's \\"request\\",Willson, p 342. eventually dying there five months later on 15 September \\"of natural causes.‚Äù In July 1615, after rumours began circulating at court, it subsequently emerged that Overbury had in fact been poisonedLindley, p 146; Barroll, Anna of Denmark, p 136. the discovery of the crime being revealed by a boy in the employment of one of the apothecaries responsible. Investigations were made and proofs were abundantly forthcoming. At a dinner in Whitehall with the king's new Secretary of State, Sir Ralph Winwood, Helwys admitted that he suspected there might have been some foul play.\\"The court of King James the First\\" by Godfrey Goodman, pp. 143 He immediately became suspect after correspondence surfaced between himself and Northampton concerning Overbury's conduct and health. In his letters to Helwys Northampton wrote with contempt of Overbury and expressed a desire that his own name should not be mentioned in connection with his imprisonment. Northampton also introduced one of the royal physicians, John Craig, to Helwys to report on the prisoner's health. Helwys also made the mistake of corresponding with Howard, the chief suspect in Overbury's poisoning. When the matter was judicially investigated, Helwys felt his political enemies trying to credit him with a direct hand in the murder. On 1 October 1615, he was arrested and forced to exchange his lodgings for a cell in the Tower. Trial and execution Engraving depicting an execution at Tower Hill c. 1641 In 1615, Helwys was put on trial, along with Monson, Richard Weston (the gaoler and ex-servant of Howard and Carr's), Mrs Anne Turner (widow of a fashionable London doctor), and a disreputable apothecary named James Franklin, in Guildhall, London for complicity in the murder of Overbury. The hearings were presided over by Sir Edward Coke, Lord Chief Justice of the King's Bench, and Sir Francis Bacon. It was ruled that \\"poisons\\" had been \\"administered\\" in the form of \\"jellies\\" and \\"tarts\\" by Weston, Turner and Franklin at the direction of Frances Howard. When Howard and Carr were tried she admitted a part in the murder, but her husband did not. Fearing what Carr might say about him in court, James repeatedly sent messages to the Tower pleading with him to admit his guilt in return for a pardon. \\"It is easy to be seen that he would threaten me with laying an aspersion upon me of being, in some sort, accessory to his crime.\\"Stewart, p 275. Carr refused and the couple were found guilty and sentenced to death. The king commuted their sentence to life imprisonment and they were eventually pardoned along with Monson. The only evidence against Helwys was that of Franklin, who asserted that the Lieutenant had been in league with Frances Howard. Through letters to Howard that were not read at the hearings, it was clear that Helwys initially had no idea that Overbury was being poisoned. He confessed later that he had entertained suspicions of this after discovering earlier attempts to poison Overbury on the part of the gaoler Weston, who had been placed in that position at the suggestion of Northampton. Considering the powerful people protecting Weston, and assuming him, indeed, to be no less than their agent, Helwys had hesitated to interfere in what seemed to him to be a matter of state. He had, however, done his utmost surreptitiously to save Overbury. It was plain both from Weston's statements and from Helwys' own, that the Lieutenant had done his very best to defeat the Turner-Essex-Northampton plot to poison his prisoner, throwing away the \\"rosalgar\\" and later \\"draughts\\", as well as substituting food for Overbury from his own kitchen for that \\"sent in\\" by Turner. He had made Weston recognise the \\"hideousness\\" of what he had done and made him promise to desist from further attempts upon the prisoner's life. Although Helwys maintained that he kept a close watch on Overbury after this event, he nevertheless suspected that the \\"thing was done\\" the moment his vigilance had been relaxed. On 18 November, ‚Äì Helwys, Weston, Turner and Franklin ‚Äì were found guilty as \\"accessories before the fact done\\" and, lacking powerful connections, were sentenced to death. On the day of his execution on the following Monday, 20 November at Tower Hill, Helwys gave an impassioned speech to the crowd in attendance protesting his innocence: > I was so far from thinking myself foul in the fact, that until these two > Gentlemen, (Doctor Felton and Doctor Whiting, the physicians for my soul) > told me how deeply I had imbrued my hands in the blood of (Overbury) making > me, by God‚Äôs law, as guilty in the concealing (of it) as if I had been a > personal actor in it. Till then... I held myself ignorant of the deed, and > my conscience so clear, that I did never ask God forgiveness...\\"The > lieutenant of the Tower his speech and repentance, at the time of his death > who was executed vpon Tower Hill, on the 20. day of Nouember, 1615 : > together with a meditation and vow of his that hee made not long before he > dyed\\" by Sir Gervase Helwys.

Eld for Na. > Butter, and are to be sold at his shop neere Saint Austines Gate (London) He did, however, beg God's forgiveness for both his guilt in the crime and for being ‚Äúmuch addicted\\" to gambling.

In contrast, a legend talks about an immigrant called Canisio from the Swiss canton Valais around the time of 1400. Before he could fetch his bride from his old homeland, she had died there and in sad remembrance he brought several plants of Edelweiss from her grave and planted them on the slopes of the Holenke. Kanisfluh is supposedly derived from the name Canisio.  Gravel mining  The R√ºf company has plans to mine gravel at the foot of the Kanisfluh. Gravel mining does not present a problem for state geologist Eva Vigl, as one would only scratch the surface and the Kansisfluh would not become destabilized. The municipality of Schnepfau, however, wants to prevent the mining of 800,000 m¬≥ of stone over the next 30 years. The state authority is reviewing if Schnepfau may put the area under nature preservation. In the discussion about the gravel mining at the foot of the Kanisfluh, the Greens argue for putting the Kanisfluh under large-scale nature preservation.

His one appearance to date is in Aldous Huxley's dystopian satire Ape and Essence. Briggs is famous for his fascinating smile.Huxley, p.17 Hollywood career Briggs writes for Lou Lublin Productions. (Huxley wrote screen versions of 19th century English novels for producers Hunt Stromberg, William Goetz, Kenneth Macgowan and Orson Welles, as well as a life of Mme. Curie for Sidney Franklin). He has just been denied a raise, a disappointment with repercussions for his love life. The industry is tightening its belt; Hollywood mogul Schmuel Gelbfisz has announced to the press that those under him may well see their salaries reduced by half. He has no automobile of his own, but uses his wife Miriam's Buick convertible. Briggs is‚Äîor was‚Äîserious about art; he deplores popular escapism as an abuse of it. He knows exactly how many tens of millions of dollars were raked in by Amanda, a vapid musical love story, three winters previously‚Äîduring the Ardennes Offensive. In early 1946 he began scripting a life of Catherine of Siena, who in 1366 had mystically married Jesus. Having to sex it up, he elaborated a character from a suitor mentioned in her letters. His script has been reworked three times by others before getting to production, but the lover-character remains; Lublin hopes to get Humphrey Bogart for the part (an unlikely prospect, as 1948 will see him starring in several films by John Huston). Brigg's relationship with Elaine began as his involvement in the Catherine script was concluding. His long avoidance of its physical consummation‚Äîi.e. of technical adultery‚Äîmirrors his disenchantment with what in Hollywood passes for the creative process. \\"When you finally get what you want,\\" he tells his friend, Huxley's narrator, \\"it's never what you thought it was going to be.\\"Huxley, p.8 Another symbol of spiritual death is the long drought (or drouth) upon southern California; this finally breaks when Briggs instinctively reads a script by a Mojave recluse (rejected by Lublin) after the Narrator reads him part of it. Romantic Identity The Goya that Briggs wanted his lover to have Briggs thinks of himself as a Romantic -- \\"as all the Romantic poets rolled into one\\", according to his fellow, the unnamed narrator of the Tallis section of Huxley's novelAldous Huxley, Ape and Essence, New York: Harper and Row, 1948; p.1 (Bantam edition, 1958)‚Äîspecifically as Keats, dying in love; as Shelley, recklessly following his heart; as Byron, the darkly towering exile; as Beddoes, the mortality-obsessed suicide. Yet of these fatal figures it is Shelley who resonates most in Brigg's life, and not for the manner of his death but for his dereliction regarding his infant son and pregnant 19-yr-old wife Harriet. (But on the bright side, cf also his poem Adona√Øs with which Huxley closes the Script, the novel's second, main and final section). It has been noted that Briggs is a reader of letters. He would in all likelihood have read Fanny Brawne's letters to Keats, published ten years before Brigg's encounter with Tallis.John Keats#Life The buttes of the south-western Mojave desert remind Briggs of one of Goya's evil landscapes, though it was the foreground matter that had compelled him to buy his lover a reproduction of the work.Huxley, p.14 Sexual Delusion Briggs has recently taken Elaine to Acapulco for an adulterous get-away. Though he 'd long put off moving their relation to that level, he is yet disappointed, claiming to have thought it was going to be what he wanted. The precise nature of the disappointment is hinted at by Huxley's narrator, who tells us Briggs is basically impotentHuxley, p.2 and hence may have been avoiding the physical act of love for these nearly two years only in order to protect himself. If that is so then his voicing of moral qualms may be dishonest: his behaviour with Rosie (below) is evidence for this; the Narrator's reference to Goya's terrifying \\"saurian rats\\", however, suggests that Briggs' impotence may have honest roots. Rosie Briggs is first made aware of Rosie when he hears her singing the popular song Now is the hour in the kitchen of the Cottonwood Ranch. The song would be a year-long hit for Huxley's compatriot the vocalist Gracie Fields, who during the war had come to the USA with her husband Mario Bianche lest he be interned as an enemy alien. Fields picked up Now is the hour in New Zealand, a place of some importance in Tallis's screenplay. Rosie appears in a fetching black sweater and tartan skirt. The narrator notes the \\"technically perfect\\" look with which she greets Briggs, and is reminded of other upwardly-mobile kittens in history and literature: of Ninon de l'Enclos, mistress of France Antarctique founder Gaspard de Coligny; of Emy Lyon, installed at Sir Harry Fetherstonhaugh's South Downs mansion; of Anna Karenina; of Morphil. That she is disquieteningly ‚Äúsimultaneously innocent and knowing‚ÄùHuxley, p.21 foretells (by seven years) the words of another, masochistic and unreliable narrator, Humbert Humbert. Completing the picture of pre-nubile predation, Rosie's cousin Katie is annoyed by her laziness.Huxley, p.23 Notes and references Category:Aldous Huxley Category:Characters in British novels of the 20th century Category:Fictional writers ","title":"Robert Briggs (character)"},{"id":"24568498","text":"The Sword and the Gavel is the autobiography of Judge William J.

Fadrique de Toledo or Fadrique √Ålvarez de Toledo y Mendoza, 1st Marquess of Valdueza (Naples, May 30, 1580 - Madrid, December 11, 1634), was a Spanish noble and admiral. He was a Knight of the Order of Santiago and Captain General of the Spanish Navy at the age of 37. Life He was born in Naples as the son of Pedro de Toledo Osorio, 5th Marquess of Villafranca, then commander in chief of the Spanish Army in the Kingdom of Naples, and Do√±a Elvira de Mendoza. He served in the Spanish fleet under command of his father and rose quickly through the ranks, as did his elder brother Garc√≠a de Toledo Osorio, 6th Marquess of Villafranca. In 1617, he became Captain General of the Ocean Sea Navy, replacing the late Admiral Luis Fajardo. He gained several victories against the Dutch, in 1621 near Gibraltar and in 1623 in the English Channel, blockading the Dutch coast. In the same year he defeated a Moorish incursion near Gibraltar. In 1625 he was appointed General of Portugal (then in a personal union with Spain), and Capit√°n General of the Army of Brazil. He sailed towards Brazil at the head of a fleet consisting of 34 Spanish ships, 22 Portuguese ships and 12,566 men (three quarters were Spanish and the rest Portuguese). There he reconquered the strategically important city of Salvador da Bahia from the Dutch on April 30, 1625. This victory would prove decisively important in the Dutch-Portuguese War to oust the Dutch from Brazil over the next two decades. In 1629 he commanded a Spanish expedition that expelled the English and French colonial settlers from the islands of Saint Kitts and Nevis. For all of his victories he was awarded the title of Marquess of Villanueva de Valdueza on January 17, 1624.

Blessed with a strong stage presence and a voice that provoked varying reactions from critics, his repertoire included such taxing dramatic parts as Tristan in Tristan und Isolde, Radames in Aida, the title role in Otello, and Canio in Pagliacci. The limitations of early microphones meant that his voice was not always recorded successfully, although the British National Opera Company website notes that playing the recordings at 80 rpm produces a more reliable result.Mullings on Divineart.com Mullings was born in Walsall. He studied singing in Birmingham and made his operatic d√©but in Coventry in 1907‚Äîin Faust by Gounod. He joined the Denhof Opera Company in 1913, was engaged by the Beecham Opera Company from 1916 to 1921, and was with the British National Opera Company from 1922 until its closure in 1929. He was the first to sing the part of Wagner's Parsifal in English, which he did at the Royal Opera House, Covent Garden, in 1919. Mullings was a noted interpreter, in England at least, of Verdi's Otello, as well as Tristan by Wagner.Mullings on Answers.com He created the role of Hadyar in Nail by Isidore de Lara, and the role of Apollo in Alkestis by Rutland Boughton.Mullings on Historicopera.com The English music critic Neville Cardus, who came to know Mullings well, wrote in one of his press reviews that: \\"Mr. Mullings acted Canio in Pagliacci far beyond the plane of conventional Italian opera of the blood and sand order. His singing is not exactly all honey, but how intensely he lived in the part! He almost persuades us that there is real tragedy about ‚Äì- that if the puppet Canio were pricked, blood and not sawdust would come forth.\\" On the other hand, the historian John Cawte Beaglehole, who as a young man in London saw Mullings perform in The Damnation of Faust by Berlioz, found him disappointing: \\"... supposed to be a great tenor; [he was] a red-faced cove who sang in a strangled ineffective stupid fashion; still, you never know, he may have been drunk.\\"Letter from John Cawte Beaglehole to his mother dated 21 February 1927 - Victoria University of Wellington website At the height of his fame, Mullings joined the staff of the Birmingham School of Music, teaching voice, and working from 1927 through to 1946. He also taught at the Royal Manchester College of Music from 1944 to 1949. Mullings died at the age of 72 in Manchester. His voice is preserved in a number of 78-rpm gramophone records which testify to the sincerity of his interpretations but highlight the limitations of his vocal technique, as hinted at politely by Cardus in the quotation cited above. Michael Scott (author of The Record of Singing, Volume 2, published by Duckworth in 1979), J.B. Steane (The Grand Tradition, Duckworth, 1971) and many other commentators have been less guarded than Cardus, noting the constricted production and distorted vowels of his recorded performances, though even Steane's 2006 Gramophone review of the reissued British National Opera Company's 1927 Columbia recording of Pagliacci noted that \\"the throatiness and discomfort [of Mullings‚Äôs Canio] in the upper range are to some extent offset by a warmly personal timbre and intense dramatic commitment.\\" References * Scott, Michael, The Record of Singing, Volume Two, 1914-1925 (Duckworth, London, 1979), pp. 169‚Äì170. * Rosenthal, Harold & Warrack, John, The Concise Oxford Dictionary of Opera, second edition (Oxford University Press, London, 1980), under \\"Mullings, Frank\\".

Scared Shrekless was based on the children's book Shrek!, by the writer William Steig, which was published on October 17, 1990. This short marks the first time Eddie Murphy does not reprise his role as Donkey and is replaced by Dean Edwards, Rupert Everett is replaced by Sean Bishop as Prince Charming, and the Ogre Babies are now voiced by Miles Christopher Bakshi and Nina Zoe Bakshi. This is the first time Duloc is seen since the original Shrek. It was produced with the working title of Shrek or Treat. Plot After Fiona and their three children scare away some teenage trick or treaters, Shrek, Donkey, Puss, the Three Little Pigs, the Big Bad Wolf, Gingy, and Pinocchio decide to tell scary stories. Shrek claims that whoever can tell the scariest story will be crowned King of Halloween. They go to the run down kingdom of Duloc where Lord Farquaad once reigned and get settled inside his abandoned castle and each take turns telling their story. Scary stories *The Bride of Gingy told by Vernon (a spoof of Bride of Frankenstein) *Boots Motel told by Murphy and Banderas (a spoof of Psycho) *The Shreksorcist told by Myers (a spoof of The Exorcist) The Bride of Gingy Gingy goes to see the Muffin Man and tells him that his girlfriend dumped him because he only thought of himself. So, he and the Muffin Man make a new girlfriend named Sugar. When they make her, Gingy decides to use a lot of sugar, thinking that she will love him forever, despite the Muffin Man's warnings. When she is baked, Gingy becomes happy with her but ends up becoming freaked out of all her love for him. After running away and pushing her in a big container of batter, he finally becomes free of her, unaware that the batter Sugar was dropped in ended up creating thousands of zombie clones of herself, surrounding Gingy and eating him. The Three Little Pigs get scared and run away with Big Bad Wolf who claims they are his ride. Shrek comments on the falsehood of Gingy's true story, saying that he cannot be there if he was eaten, and he runs off as well. Boots Motel Next, Donkey and Puss tell a story about them taking shelter from a thunderstorm at the Boots Motel (a parody of the Bates Motel from Psycho). Their story starts off well, but when Donkey tells it, it always end up with Puss getting killed, so Puss decides to change it: Donkey and Puss go to the Motel, but Donkey calls Puss his sidekick. When Puss tries to deny it, Donkey says he took a tongue bath, and gets killed by the innkeeper, but Puss retells it, saying he would fight the innkeeper but the keeper gets knocked over by Donkey, who rescues Puss. It turns out that the keeper was Prince Charming and he zaps Puss with his wand to dust, but Puss says he used his sword and leaped to safety, but Donkey says he was standing on an 'X' spot, which Charming pulls a lever to trap Puss, but Puss says he would never let that happen to him, so he says that he woke up, revealing to be all a dream. Donkey comes in and tells Puss that he's actually on the ceiling, in which the bed falls. The lights go out and when they come back on, Donkey is in the shower and about to be eaten by a giant waffle. Donkey tries to run, but gets covered in butter, wear a pink tutu, a sombrero and a coconut bra. Finally, Donkey gets Pinocchio to spray Puss with water, making him run away. Shrek suspects that that was cheating. The Shreksorcist At last, Shrek tells the final story about his experience babysitting a crazed and possessed Pinocchio. After repeatedly beating up Shrek, Pinocchio leaps from the window, despite Shrek's attempts to catch him. When Pinocchio lands on the streets, a talking cricket (Jiminy Cricket) pops out of Pinocchio's head, claiming to be his conscience and the voice in his head that made him go crazy, in which Pinocchio squashes him with his foot in retaliation. Pinocchio denies that the story is true, but when Shrek shows him a normal cricket, he screams and flees in terror. Now alone, Donkey and Shrek hear the wind moving about, and a walking suit of armour calling Donkey's name. It appears to be Farquaad's ghost, who has come to exact revenge. Scared out of his wits, Donkey admits defeat and runs away. Fiona reveals it was her and the babies who planned the ghost act and then they, along with Shrek, celebrate by egging the Seven Dwarfs.

The school was located in Moorebank until suburb borders changed. Established in 1971 and operated by the New South Wales Department of Education, the school currently caters for approximately 1,041 students from Year 7 to Year 12. This is a comprehensive and selective high school.  History  Planning for Moorebank High School began in 1971 to meet the needs of the Moorebank, and growth areas. It wasn't until May 1975 however that the school was ready to be occupied. At the beginning of term two staff and students moved into the present school premises, with B. T. O'Donnell as the founding School Principal. In June 1985, to coincide with the opening of the school tennis courts, the school was officially opened by the then Minister of Education, Rodney Cavalier. Over the years Moorebank High has built up a record of academic, sporting, performing arts and student leadership achievement. The school is a leader in the area of technology with five computing laboratories allowing learning programs to be developed for students. School musicals and Expo evenings are a feature of the school. In 2010 Moorebank High School became a partially selective high school.Quoted directly from the Moorebank High School Website  Admissions and enrolment  Total enrolment in junior years (7‚Äì10) is approximately 180 students, and around 200 in senior years (11‚Äì12). Total number of enrolment was 1,075 students in 2018. The school is partially selective, meaning it is divided into selective and comprehensive classes. Those who want to enrol in the comprehensive classes will just enrol normally, like in most other high schools. Admission into selective classes in Year 7 is determined upon results in a Statewide examination known as the Selective High Schools Test. Entry into vacant places in later stages is based on a reserve list and other criteria, mainly reports from previous years. The school also has a Support Unit through which students with intellectual disabilities receive extra support and lessons designed to equip them for active participation in the wider community upon graduation. These students are also encouraged to take part in all aspects of school life and are an integral part of the school community. Facilities School facilities include six laboratories, three industrial kitchens, two wood-work studios, two metal-work studios, a recording studio, a photographic darkroom, a dual- library, a football field, a cricket field, two cricket nets, two basketball courts, three tennis courts, a dance studio, and an indoor multiplex hall with staging.

Latvian Culture Canon It is shown every year on TV prior to the summer solstice festival of JƒÅ≈Üi, which is a national holiday in Latvia. The movie is about the struggle of two related families for the eighty-year-old aunt's inheritance through comic and romantic events.  Plot  The movie begins when old auntie Mirta (Mirta Saknƒ´te) succeeds in a lottery and wins a car which every Soviet citizen longs for ‚Äì a Zhiguli car. Because of her old age, she cannot use the car herself. And when the word spreads out about her luck, different family members all of a sudden come to her countryside house to 'be helpful' in favour to get the car after aunt's death. Mirta's nephew ƒíriks with his wife Dagnija and their son Uƒ£is decided to give up their holiday to Carpathian Mountains just to lay their hands on aunties' legacy. Not only Mirta's nephew decided to surprise her with his arrival but her ex-daughter- in-law Olita together with her new family including her new husband Viktors and their offspring LƒÅsma. The funny rivalry between two sides of the family, foolish jealousy of the near living peasants' family, who had always non- selfishly been there for auntie Mirta, is a caricature of greasy human nature. This is a slight humor of the Soviet life details as well. But aunt Mirta isn't a fool, she is still young in her heart until her very last breath, which also can be seen in her last will - to whom she left her car to, a Limousine The Colour Of Midsummer's Eve.

They are named in analogy with the Standard Model W and Z bosons. Types=Types of W‚Ä≤ bosons W‚Ä≤ bosons often arise in models with an extra SU(2) gauge group relative to the full Standard Model gauge group . is spontaneously broken to the diagonal subgroup SU(2)W which corresponds to the electroweak SU(2). More generally, we might have n copies of SU(2), which are then broken down to a diagonal SU(2)W. This gives rise to n2‚àí1 W+‚Ä≤, W‚àí‚Ä≤ and Z‚Ä≤ bosons. Such models might arise from quiver diagram, for example. In order for the W‚Ä≤ bosons to couple to weak isospin, the extra SU(2) and the Standard Model SU(2) must mix; one copy of SU(2) must break around the TeV scale (to get W‚Ä≤ bosons with a TeV mass) leaving a second SU(2) for the Standard Model. This happens in Little Higgs models that contain more than one copy of SU(2). Because the W‚Ä≤ comes from the breaking of an SU(2), it is generically accompanied by a Z‚Ä≤ boson of (almost) the same mass and with couplings related to the W‚Ä≤ couplings. Another model with W‚Ä≤ bosons but without an additional SU(2) factor is the so-called 331 model with . The symmetry breaking chain leads to a pair of W‚Ä≤¬± bosons and three Z‚Ä≤ bosons. W‚Ä≤ bosons also arise in Kaluza‚ÄìKlein theories with SU(2) in the bulk. Types of Z‚Ä≤ bosons Various models of physics beyond the Standard Model predict different kinds of Z‚Ä≤ bosons. ; Models with a new U(1) gauge symmetry: The Z‚Ä≤ is the gauge boson of the (broken) U(1) symmetry. ; E6 models: This type of model contains two Z‚Ä≤ bosons, which can mix in general. ; Topcolor and Top Seesaw Models of Dynamical Electroweak Symmetry Breaking: Both these models have Z‚Ä≤ bosons that select the formation of particular condensates. ; Little Higgs models: These models typically include an enlarged gauge sector, which is broken down to the Standard Model gauge symmetry around the TeV scale. In addition to one or more Z‚Ä≤ bosons, these models often contain W‚Ä≤ bosons. ; Kaluza‚ÄìKlein models: The Z‚Ä≤ boson are the excited modes of a neutral bulk gauge symmetry. ; Stueckelberg Extensions: The Z‚Ä≤ boson is sourced from couplings found in string theories with intersecting D-branes (see Stueckelberg action). Searches=Direct searches A W‚Ä≤-boson could be detected at hadron colliders through its decay to lepton plus neutrino or top quark plus bottom quark, after being produced in quark-antiquark annihilation. The LHC reach for W‚Ä≤ discovery is expected to be a few TeV. Direct searches for Z‚Ä≤-bosons are carried out at hadron colliders, since these give access to the highest energies available. The search looks for high-mass dilepton resonances: the Z‚Ä≤-boson would be produced by quark-antiquark annihilation and decay to an electron-positron pair or a pair of opposite-charged muons. The most stringent current limits come from the Fermilab Tevatron, and depend on the couplings of the Z‚Ä≤-boson (which control the production cross section); as of 2006, the Tevatron excludes Z‚Ä≤-bosons up to masses of about 800 GeV for \\"typical\\" cross sections predicted in various models. The above statements apply to \\"wide width\\" models. Recent classes of models have emerged that naturally provide cross section signatures that fall on the edge, or slightly below the 95% confidence level limits set by the Tevatron, and hence can produce detectable cross section signals for a Z‚Ä≤-boson in a mass range much closer to the Z pole mass than the \\"wide width\\" models discussed above. These \\"narrow width\\" models which fall into this category are those that predict a St√ºckelberg Z‚Ä≤ as well as a Z‚Ä≤ from a universal extra dimension (see the Z‚Ä≤ Hunter's Guide for links to these papers). On 7 April 2011, the CDF collaboration at the Tevatron reported an excess in proton-antiproton collision events that produce a W-boson accompanied by two hadronic jets. This could possibly be interpreted in terms of a Z‚Ä≤-boson. On 2 June 2015, the ATLAS experiment at the LHC reported evidence for W‚Ä≤-bosons at significance 3.4 sigma, still too low to claim a formal discovery. Researchers at the CMS experiment also independently reported signals that corroborate ATLAS's findings. Z‚Ä≤‚ÄìY mixings We might have gauge kinetic mixings between the U(1)‚Ä≤ of the Z‚Ä≤ boson and U(1)Y of hypercharge. This mixing leads to a tree level modification of the Peskin‚ÄìTakeuchi parameters.

She was notably one of the major sopranos at the New York City Opera during the company's early years. She also made guest appearances with a number of opera houses in North America and Europe, enjoying a particularly fruitful partnership with the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company. After retiring from the opera stage in 1966, she embarked on a second career as a voice teacher.  Biography  Born Eva Pichl√≠kov√° in Prague, Likova studied to be a ballerina before studying singing at the Prague Conservatory with Nektar de Flondor. She made her professional opera debut in 1943 as Ma≈ôenka in Bed≈ôich Smetana's The Bartered Bride at the Brno National Theatre where she was committed for two years. From 1945 through 1947 she worked as a principal artist at the Prague National Theatre. She also made a handful of appearances in European films and worked as a dramatic actress and ballet dancer during the early 1940s. In 1947 LIKOVA came to the United States on a two-year contract with the Detroit Symphony. It was she who brought Americans from the delusion that he was Antonin Dvorak's New World American composer and music that is purely American. Following reports of a communist coup in 1948, he decided to stay here for the rest of your life. She first performed in the USA as a concert singer, making her American debut on February 6, 1947 with the Detroit Symphony Orchestra under conductor Karl Krueger. In 1948 she received critical acclaim after appearing with the New York Philharmonic under the direction of Alfredo Antonini before an audience of over 14,000 at the landmark Lewisohn Stadium performing selections from Giacomo Puccini's Madama Butterfly and Ruggero Leoncavallo's Pagliacci.The New York Times 2 July 1948 p. 24 Critical review of Alfredo Antonini & Eva Likova at Lewisohn Stadium on proquest.com In 1949 made her American opera debut as Violetta in Giuseppe Verdi's La traviata at the New York City Opera (NYCO).

She returned to the NYCO as a guest artist a number of times up through 1965, with her last performance with the company being Giorgetta in Puccini's Il tabarro. Likova was active as a guest artist with opera companies throughout the United States during the 1950s and 1960s. In 1953 she made her debut with the Philadelphia Civic Grand Opera Company as Violetta to the Alfredo of Walter Fredericks and Germont of Cesare Bardelli under conductor Giuseppe Bamboschek. She later appeared with the Philadelphia Grand Opera Company as Nedda (1956), Gilda (1957), Adina in Gaetano Donizetti's L'elisir d'amore (1958), Lisette in Puccini's La rondine (1960), Marienka (1960), Musetta (1964), Mica√´la (1964), and Nedda (1966).Free Library of Philadelphia: Bound: Philadelphia Grand Opera Company 1955-1974 In 1954 she appeared as Zerbinetta in Richard Strauss's Ariadne auf naxos at the Central City Opera. In 1955 she sang Arsena in Johann Strauss II's The Gypsy Baron at the Lewisohn Stadium under conductor Julius Rudel and portrayed Euridice in Christoph Willibald Gluck's Orfeo ed Euridice at the Newport Music Festival with Martha Lipton as Orfeo. In 1956, she sang Dirc√© in the American Opera Society's production of Luigi Cherubini's M√©d√©e at Carnegie Hall with Eileen Farrell in the title role and Arnold Gamson conducting. In 1959, Likova portrayed Oscar in Un ballo in maschera, opposite Herva Nelli and Richard Tucker, for the Opera Guild of Miami. In 1961 Likova sang Violetta at the Opera Company of Boston with John Alexander as Alfredo and Igor Gorin as Germont under the baton of Sarah Caldwell. That same year she portrayed Li√π to Lucille Udovick's Turandot at the San Francisco Opera. She also gave performances at the Pittsburgh Opera and New Orleans Opera among others. She was also active as a concert singer, appearing with such orchestras as the New York Philharmonic and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra. On the international stage she appeared at the Canadian Opera Company, the Great Theatre, Warsaw, the Liceu, the Palacio de Bellas Artes, the Vienna State Opera, the Op√©ra National de Paris, and with a number of opera houses in Germany and Italy. She was also highly active in filming operatic productions for television in the early 1950s with both NBC and CBC. After the end of the 1965-1966 season, Likova retired from performing. She joined the faculty of the University of Michigan School of Music, Theatre & Dance, where she taught singing until her retirement in 1983. She later taught privately in both New York City and Philadelphia until returning to Michigan where she lived in Southfield until her death of complications of Alzheimer's disease at the age of 84.

In the late 1960s, with little financial reward or recognition for his work, he left the music industry. He appeared in the Deep Roots Music documentary in the late 1970s along with Sir Lord Comic.

The Corbaccio. Trans. and ed. Anthony K. Cassell, University of Pennsylvania Press, 1975. Plot The work is narrated in the first person and opens with a justification (it is not a real prologue) in which the author declares that he wishes his narrative to be a consolation to those who read it, such as he found thanks to God and the intercession of Our Lady. The protagonist, desperate because of the unreturned love of a widow, calls on Death, falls asleep and dreams. In his dream appears a man who declares himself to be the deceased husband of the widow, who says he has come, sent by God and through the intercession of Our Lady, to free him from the labyrinth of love into which he has fallen. The protagonist tells the story of his love to the spirit, who warns him against women who, with their lust, endanger men. The spirit then begins to tell him of his own experiences with the woman, drawing attention to all of her shortcomings. After hearing the story told by the spirit, the protagonist declares himself convinced and says that he wants to remedy his mistake. The spirit therefore invites him to revenge himself by using his skills as a writer to \\"unmask\\" the true nature of women. Still in the dream, the protagonist promises to do so and when he wakes up, in his room he finds himself healed of his troubles. The author concludes his work by warning the young against \\"female wickedness\\". Background Boccaccio is most famous as the author of The Decameron (completed c. 1351-2), another work of ambiguous interpretation regarding the dolce stil novo and the antifeminist counter argument. Regarding Il Corbaccio, whether the novel's theme of misogyny is a detailed study of the attitude or a direct misogynistic expression of the author has long been a subject of debate. Scholars who consider the text to be autobiographical base their interpretation on connecting aspects of the text to events in the author's life. The opposing view accepts the author's own reference to the work as a \\"trattato\\", or a philosophical treatment. As stated by scholar Anthony K. Cassell, \\"the formal elements of the treatise are part of a wide artistic tradition and contest autobiographical intention and interpretation.\\" The work is regarded by some scholars as late medieval in character, others as early renaissance.

In 1961 he joined ABC News where, for nearly 11 years, he served as the network's political affairs editor and, during his first year, as an evening news anchorman.\\"Britons and 'Family' Major Emmy Winners\\" (Kentucky New Era, May 15, 1972) Background A native Nebraskan, Lawrence was born in the state capital, Lincoln, and briefly attended the city's University of Nebraska. Career Lawrence dropped out of college to join hometown newspaper the Lincoln Star as a 17-year-old cub reporter. Newswires In 1935, at the age of 19, he moved to the Associated Press and, two years later, to the United Press. The first major assignment he covered for UP was the 1936‚Äì37 Flint Sit-Down Strike against General Motors and, having won plaudits for his reporting, was reassigned to Washington. New York Times At the beginning of 1941, Arthur Krock, Washington bureau chief of The New York Times, was impressed so by his assertiveness in ferreting out news that he offered Lawrence a position as one of the bureau's reporters.\\"William H. Lawrence, 56, Dies; National Editor of A. B. C. News; Specialist in Political Affairs Joined Network After 20 Years With Times\\" (The New York Times, March 3, 1972) In his twenty years with The Times, the 1940s byline, \\"By William H. Lawrence\\" and, in the 1950s and 1960‚Äì61, \\"By W. H. Lawrence\\" appeared over coverage from World War II, the Korean War and the Cold War. His battlefront reporting took him to Okinawa, Guam, Japan and Moscow, where he was assigned as a war correspondent in 1943 and, during the immediate postwar period, continued to file stories from such diverse locations as Poland, the Balkans and South America.\\"W.H. Lawrence Joins A.B.C. News Bureau\\" (The New York Times, May 30, 1961) Between 1950 and 1953, he spent months in Korea covering the war and interviewing soldiers in a series of personal human interest articles which appeared in The Times. In 1959 he served as president of the National Press Club and appeared in an episode of the United States Army television documentary series The Big Picture where he was first shown in a film clip introducing General Maxwell D. Taylor who, in June, made a speech to the Club on the occasion of his retirement as Army Chief of Staff.Edson, Peter. \\"Washington Notebook: Retiring General Taylor Still Has Some Missions\\" (The Victoria Advocate, July 5, 1959) In the following segment, The Big Picture host, Master Sergeant Stuart Queen, asked Lawrence to recount his Korean War experiences from nine years earlier, during the September 1950 Battle of Inchon and Second Battle of Seoul, as well as the individual and private face of war that he saw by remaining alongside the common fighting man.Master Sergeant Stuart Queen, host of 1950s television documentary series, The Big Picture, interviews Bill Lawrence about his coverage of the Korean War By 1959, as in the two preceding years, the great majority of Lawrence's efforts were devoted to the Washington political scene, with almost all of the stories appearing on the front page, including the final one he wrote for The Times, datelined May 26, 1961.Lawrence, W.

Eisenhower's Press Secretary and, immediately upon the end of the Eisenhower administration, filled John Daly's vacated position as vice- president in charge of ABC's low-rated news operation, offered Lawrence, whom he knew well from Lawrence's time as White House correspondent, a top-level position at the news department. His first assignment as ABC's chief news analyst was to accompany Hagerty on a European trip to cover President John F. Kennedy's first overseas visit as Chief Executive. Within the course of his first months with the network, since Hagerty would not take over Daly's other position, that of anchorman for ABC's evening news, Lawrence, on September 25, joined newscaster Al Mann and former NBC anchorman John Cameron Swayze in a new three-anchor team to replace Bill Shadel who had been serving as the ABC Evening Report anchorman since Daly's November 16, 1960 resignation, and final broadcast on December 16, after seven years in the post.\\"Daly Quits ABC Post; Hagerty Refuses Comment on Rumor He Will Get Job\\" (Reading Eagle, November 17, 1960) The anchor team, however, proved unsuccessful, and, following their last broadcast six months later, on March 22, 1962, ABC returned to the single- anchorman concept with Ron Cochran at the helm of ABC Evening Report until his replacement by 26-year-old Canadian Peter Jennings on February 1, 1965. In the aftermath of his brief stint as co-anchor, Bill Lawrence, as he was exclusively known at ABC, became preoccupied with his duties as the news department's political editor and, in the days following the November 1968 presidential election, national affairs editor.\\"Interview Justice Black on Dec. 3 Broadcast\\" (Youngstown Vindicator, November 24, 1968) The face of the network's political coverage, he frequently hosted or appeared on its Sunday morning news interview program, Issues and Answers and was continually visible during primaries, conventions and elections to the extent that his coverage of the 1964 Presidential election won him the Peabody Award for \\"Outstanding Reportorial Work\\". In 1966, almost two years before United States President Lyndon B. Johnson made his \\"I shall not seek and will not accept my party's nomination\\" speech of March 31, 1968, he was the sole major news analyst to predict that the president would not run. In 1968 Lawrence was diagnosed with pulmonary edema, which caused his lungs to fill with fluid and put a strain on his heart. His colleagues became aware of the condition when he collapsed at his desk immediately following one of the broadcasts from the 1968 Republican National Convention in Miami Beach.\\"Bill Lawrence Collapses at Convention Hall\\" (The Morning Record, August 6, 1968) Quickly recovering, he was able to continue working during his remaining three-and-a-half years and, as a sports fan, also began covering some athletic events and even personally served as the commentator for ABC's coverage of the 1969 World Series. He was also a skilled moderator of political debates and traveled around the country in such capacity.\\"ABC Editor to Moderate Chamber's Annual Program\\" (St. Petersburg Times, September 25, 1970) During ABC's coverage of the 1970 midterm elections, he served as national affairs editor alongside anchors Howard K. Smith and Frank Reynolds.\\"If elections are horse races, why shouldn't watching them be just as exciting?\\" (The Miami News, November 3, 1970) In March 1971, with the following year's presidential elections looming on the horizon, Lawrence requested a reduced workload, with a partial leave of absence, to finish his autobiography. While fulfilling occasional major assignments, such as a rare primetime interview with Supreme Court Chief Justice Warren Burger on July 5,Gent, George. \\"BURGER TO APPEAR IN TV INTERVIEW; Will Talk With Lawrence of A.B.C. News July 5\\" (The New York Times, May 26, 1971) he did not return full-time until October, when a resumption of his busy schedule covering the presidential campaign continued through February 1972 and a trip to New Hampshire as ABC's reporter detailing the crucial presidential primary race between early favorite, Senator Edmund Muskie and his strong challenger, Senator George McGovern. Five weeks earlier, around the time of his 56th birthday on January 29, Lawrence and ABC Evening News co-anchor, Howard K. Smith, filmed a few scenes for The Man, the made-for-TV-but-released-to- theaters feature-film version of Irving Wallace's bestselling 1964 eponymous novel, The Man. In this multi-plot story of an African-American political figure who, while serving as President pro tempore of the Senate, suddenly succeeds to the Presidency, the two top national newscasters play fictional versions of themselves in brief segments which show them delivering the news of and discussing the world-shaking event. The film ultimately opened in July, four-and-a-half months after Lawrence's death. Personal life and death Bill Lawrence and his first wife, Elizabeth Currie, were the parents of two children, William and Ann. Following divorce, he married Constance MacGregor, with that marriage also ending in divorce.

It was built between 1899 and 1902 for the Ashton Syndicate by Sydney Stott of Oldham. It was a sister mill to the Atlas Mill. It was sold to the Alger Mill Co. Ltd before 1920 and closed in 1942.http://www.london- gazette.co.uk/issues/35263/pages/5111 It was then used as a cigarette factory by the J.A. Pattreiouex company until 1966, and then sold to the Qualitex company for the production of artificial fibres. It was still spinning artificial fibres in the 1990s and was demolished in 1994; the site being used for a housing estate. Location Curzon Mill was built on Cedar Street, Hurst. History The Minerva Spinning Company Limited was registered in 1891 to build the Minerva Mill at Whitelands. The directors were Messrs Barlow, Marland, Coop, Newton, Pollitt and Pownall; they were later referred to as the Ashton syndicate. In 1891, they built the Rock Mill, and in 1898 built Atlas Mill. Curzon Mill built between 1899 and 1902 was their fourth mill and a sister mill to the Atlas mill. It was registered as the Curzon Mill Co. Ltd, with a capital of GBP70,000. Tudor Mill, Cedar Mill and finally the Texas Mill followed. The cotton industry peaked in 1912 when it produced 8 billion yards of cloth. The great war of 1914‚Äì1918 halted the supply of raw cotton, and the British government encouraged its colonies to build mills to spin and weave cotton. The war over, Lancashire never regained its markets. By 1920 the Ashton syndicate had sold the mill to the Alger Mill Company Limited, and the Mill was renamed the Alger Mill, and the company was known as the Alger Spinning Company Ltd. Architecture This was a Sydney Stott building. It was four storeys high built on a basement from engineering brick. The large windows were in groups of three, and there was white tile decoration. It had a Hotel-de-Ville style water tower. The six bay engine house, boiler house and chimney were to the north-west Power The steam engine was by George Saxon & Co, of Openshaw. It was 1200 hp horizontal triple expansion four cylinder engine, that ran the forty ton flywheel at 60rpm. There were two 37in diameter low pressure cylinders (LP), an intermediate (IP) of 32in and a high pressure (HP) of 20in. They had a 60in stroke. They had Corliss valves and the airpumps were driven from each crosshead. The boiler operated at 160 psi. The flywheel was 26 ft in diameter and was grooved for 28 ropes. Equipment All the mule frames and equipment was by Hetherington and Sons Ltd. There were 77,184 mule spindles spinning fine counts of twists and weft from Egyptian cotton. By 1911 it was spinning medium counts of American. Usage Curzon Mill was used for spinning fine counts of twists and weft from Egyptian cotton. In 1911 it was spinning medium counts of American cotton. Owners * The Ashton syndicate * Alger Spinning Company Ltd. * J.A. Pattreiouex, cigarette manufacturers (1942‚Äì1966) * Qualitex Yarns Notable events/media In 1904 there was a lengthy and acrimonious strike at Curzon Mill. The causes and settlement are unclear, but because of the friction and a depression in the market, the directors failed to pay a dividend to the shareholders for half-year ending 24 September 1904. Two possible causes could have been the directors employing 'non-union labour', or tension between management and the spinners and the cardroom operatives. At any rate, the trouble moved onto the street and many women were arrested and bound over to keep the peace for 'shouting'.Bolton Evening News 17-09-1904 Commenting on the settlement, the mayor, Alderman Shaw, whose efforts paved the way for a settlement said \\"Both sides have given way a little, but neither cares to admit it.\\" Rhodes family history Quoting the \\"Ashton Reporter\\" See also *Textile manufacturing ReferencesBibliography  External links * www.cottontown.org * www.spinningtheweb.org.uk * Greater Manchester County Record Office B/CTLD/44/1 Category:Textile mills in Tameside Category:Buildings and structures in Ashton-under-Lyne Category:Textile mills owned by the Lancashire Cotton Corporation Category:Demolished buildings and structures in Greater Manchester Category:Buildings and structures demolished in 1994 ","title":"Curzon Mill, Ashton-under-Lyne"},{"id":"24569585","text":"Ruth Olay (born July 1, 1924, San Francisco, California, United States) is a jazz singer with Hungarian ancestry who was born in San Francisco, the daughter of a Rabbi and a professional chorister mother. Moving to Los Angeles while still an infant, Olay became a fixture in Hollywood's nightclub scene in the late 1940s and through the 1950s and early 1960s. Career Initially a piano prodigy, her interest in music developed from exposure to her mother's professional chorus singing work. At age 16 or 17, working as secretary at Twentieth Century Fox, Olay undertook singing lessons with vocal coach Florence Russell (Dorothy Dandridge). While at work, she met one of Duke Ellington's vocalists, Ivie Anderson. Together they attended the venue where Ellington was playing and Olay was persuaded to sing. In 1942, at her mother's re-marriage party she sang and impressed a guest, the wife of songwriter Irving Gordon (Throw Mama From the Train, Unforgettable). Gordon in turn introduced Olay to jazz musician Benny Carter who became her musical mentor. She performed under the moniker Rachel Davis and, due to her dark complexion, passing as a black woman, with Carter in San Diego, and later with Jerry Fielding in Los Angeles and Beverly Hills clubs, all the while holding down a secretarial day job at Twentieth Century Fox, including work for celebrated screenwriter Preston Sturges. At the Cabaret Concert Theatre where she both waitressed and sang, she came to the attention of Bill Hitchcock of Zephyr Records. Olay's first LP on Zephyr in 1956 was promoted as coming from \\"the blues shouting tradition\\", \\"pop style\\" and \\"swinging interpretation\\".Zephyr advertisement, Billboard Magazine Sept. 29, 1956 p. 63 While gigging at the Little Club, Olay was approached by Bill Burton, who managed, among others, Jimmy Dorsey and Dick Haymes, and soon got her big break when Burton booked her an emergency gig at the Avant Garde Club in replacement of Billie Holiday, who had fallen ill. This developed into a headline run, along with Shelley Berman, Matt Dennis Trio and Lenny Bruce. A regular at the club was arranger Pete Rugolo, who A&R;'ed for Mercury Records. Her first LP on Mercury OLAY! The New Sound of Ruth Olay in 1958 was followed by a guest vocalist spot on Jack Paar's Tonight Show.Billboard Dec. 8, 1958 p. 6 She became the \\"Singing Sensation of the Jack Paar Show\\" during Paar's stint, and also appeared later on Johnny Carson's watch, the latter time backed by Duke Ellington. Subsequent appearances included Jerry Fielding's TV show, and with Merv Griffin, Jackie Gleason and Steve Allen. In 1961, Olay found time to play the role of Julie in Lewis & Youngs' production of Showboat. For the second LP Easy Living on Mercury in 1959, Olay was set up with Jerry Fielding whose credits included arranging with big bands such as those of Kay Kyser, Claude Thornhill, Jimmie Lunceford, Tommy Dorsey, Charlie Barnet, and Les Brown. LP's followed on diverse labels after Olay's departure from Mercury and she continued nightclub appearances and TV shows well into the 1960s (e.g.: Sue Rainey on KTLA June 11, 1965).Billboard June 3, 1967 p. 14 After spending some time performing in Europe where the popularity of American jazz persisted\\"Ruth Olay--still Jazzy After All These Years\\".

It originally aired on Fox in the United States on November 8, 2009. The episode follows Stewie Griffin after he sneaks backstage at a Miley Cyrus concert in Quahog, eventually discovering that she is actually an android and causing her to wreak havoc on the town. Meanwhile, Chris Griffin proves to his family that the Evil Monkey who lives in his closet is actually real, and eventually comes to realize that the monkey is actually friendly, well-spoken and intelligent, when he begins spending more time with him than his own father. First announced at the 2009 San Diego Comic-Con International, the episode was written by Cherry Chevapravatdumrong and directed by John Holmquist. It received mixed reviews from critics for its storyline and cultural references. According to Nielsen ratings, it was viewed in 7.73 million homes in its original airing. The episode aired during an \\"all-Seth MacFarlane\\" line-up, along with the live- action special Seth and Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show, and featured a guest performance by Candace Marie, along with several recurring guest voice actors for the series. \\"Hannah Banana\\" was released on DVD along with seven other episodes from the season on June 15, 2010. Plot Chris Griffin does poorly on a test at school and blames the Evil Monkey living in his closet. Lois Griffin, his mother, thinks Chris is joking. Later, Stewie Griffin, his younger brother and a self-proclaimed Hannah Montana fan, learns that Miley Cyrus is having a concert in Quahog. Tickets to the show are sold out, leaving him unable to attend the show. Brian Griffin, the family dog, makes fun of Stewie for watching Hannah Montana, but seeing him cry about not being able to attend the show persuades him to help get tickets. Chris sets up a camera in his room to capture the monkey. However, when that fails, Chris lures the monkey into a trap with free monkey food and catches it. The family is taken aback when Chris proves it is real by capturing the monkey, but are less impressed by Meg showing her own evil albeit larger monkey, accusing her of mocking Chris. However, Chris's monkey turns out not to be evil after all. The monkey then reveals that he got home from work one day and caught his wife cheating on him. He was depressed after the divorce, which cost him his job and his house. He moved into Chris's closet until he got back on his feet and has lived there for nine years. The monkey also reveals that the scary expression is the face he makes when thinking, and this whole time, he had really been trying to talk to Chris (pointing at him was his only at trying to start a conversation with him). He also explains that the reason for him trembling was due to suffering from copper deficiency. The monkey apologises to Chris for unintentionally terrorising him and wishes to start over. Chris is at first unconvinced, but when the monkey helps him write a book report, he is surprised to receive a passing grade, and the two become great friends. Chris realizes that the Monkey has spent more time with him than his dad, Peter Griffin. Brian and Stewie sneak in backstage at the concert and are confronted by Miley. Brian explains that Stewie has a \\"tumor\\" shaped head like a football, which convinces Miley to let them hang out with her. Miley and Stewie become best friends. While having ice cream with Miley, Stewie notices a signal interference on her cell phone when handing it to her. Upon spying on her, Stewie and Brian discover that she is actually an android after seeing an employee insert a USB drive on the control panel on Miley's back. They both realized that Miley was created by Walt Disney Imagineering to become the perfect teen idol that can never fail. When Brian curiously asks if she can have sex, Stewie agrees to reprogram Miley. It goes wrong and he accidentally sends Miley into a rage, forcing Stewie and Brian to run away. Peter and Chris fight, which upsets Lois. The monkey tricks Peter and Chris into coming to dinner together. Peter admits that he does not hate Chris and vows to spend more time with him. They see Brian and Stewie running away from Miley who is smashing vehicles, shops and houses. The monkey confronts her, and attempts to talk her out of her rampage, but Miley ends up kidnapping him and takes him to the top of a nearby skyscraper. Fortunately, Peter is able to recruit his neighbor, Glenn Quagmire, to shoot her down in a biplane, and a battle with Miley starts. The monkey falls out of her hands and he grips onto a narrow ledge with one hand. Miley is pummelled off the top of the skyscraper. The monkey falls off the ledge but is saved by Peter just before he hits the road. Stewie apologizes to Brian for missing his chance for sexual intercourse with Miley but then her dismembered arm falls back out of the sky in front of them and Brian tells Stewie that it's not too late to have sex with her. And then, after saying goodbye to Chris, the monkey moves out of Chris's closet to Tom Tucker's upside-down-faced son Jake Tucker's closet for a new haunt, to help Tom and Jake work through their relationship. Production and development Miley Cyrus was parodied in the episode. \\"Hannah Banana\\" was written by series regular Cherry Chevapravatdumrong and directed by John Holmquist, before the conclusion of the eighth production season. Commenting on the original development of the episode, series creator and executive producer Seth MacFarlane stated, \\" was the result of our ongoing desire to let the series stagnate, and kind of evolve things that may have run their course. There's only so many times you can do the Evil Monkey jumping out of that closet, before the joke gets old, and I think often times there's a fear to mess with what works, and change things permanently. ... We literally retired the Evil Monkey in this episode, and got a great episode out of it, which was worth it, and kind of evolved the series in a way.\\" Singer and actress Candace Marie provided the voice of Miley Cyrus. Marie received the role when her producer alerted her of the audition, and she eventually received a call from the Family Guy casting director a month later. Even though the episode mocked Cyrus, Marie did not think she would upset any of Cyrus' fans. She added that she is a fan herself, and \\"was very impressed by the way Family Guy developed the episode\\", and thought it was \\"a huge compliment for them to refer to Miley as the 'perfect popstar. After voicing Cyrus, Marie was called back to Family Guy to voice Meg Griffin's friend Beth for \\"several upcoming episodes\\". Marie described Beth as a girl that is \\"rarely addressed in conversation but loves to chime in whenever she can\\". The song in the episode sung by Cyrus was written by Chevapravatdumrong, and composed and performed by Family Guy composer Walter Murphy. The episode aired as a part of an \\"all-Seth MacFarlane\\" line-up, after the episode \\"Brian's Got a Brand New Bag\\" and the live-action special Seth and Alex's Almost Live Comedy Show. \\"Hannah Banana\\", along with the seven other episodes from Family Guys eighth season, were released on a three-disc DVD set in the United States on June 15, 2010. The sets included brief audio commentaries by Seth MacFarlane and various crew and cast members for several episodes, a collection of deleted scenes, a special mini-feature which discussed the process behind animating \\"Road to the Multiverse\\", and mini-feature entitled Family Guy Karaoke. In addition to the regular cast, series regular, writer and executive producer Danny Smith voiced the Evil Monkey. Recurring guest voice actors Chris Cox, actor Ralph Garman, writer Alec Sulkin and writer John Viener made minor appearances throughout the episode. Cultural references Rapper Kanye West was referenced in the episode. In the opening scene of the episode, Chris alerts his parents of a failing grade he received at school on a science test, causing his mother to suggest he receive help on his homework. Chris then asks his father, Peter, for help who ends up rejecting him, leading Chris to blame his bad grades on the Evil Monkey, and announces that he will prove the monkey is real. Peter then suggests that his son would have to do a better job than God when he created actresses Ellen Barkin and Kelly McGillis. Later that day, Stewie is shown watching television in the family room, with a narrator announcing a Hannah Montana marathon, as well as a concert in Quahog, Rhode Island, causing him to become excited. A scene from an episode of Hannah Montana is then shown, featuring Miley Cyrus, as well as her father, singer-songwriter Billy Ray Cyrus. Deciding to sneak into the concert, Brian agrees to dress as rapper Kanye West, and is forced to sing one of his songs by a security guard. Despondent, Brian then begins singing the theme song to 1972 NBC sitcom Sanford and Son. The scene is not shown on TV; Stewie and Brian sneak into the concert in the televised version. As the monkey begins bonding with the family, including having a conversation about actress and comedian Sarah Silverman, Chris realizes his deep hatred of the monkey. Deciding to help Chris on his homework, the monkey scraps a lame attempt by Chris to write an essay about the 1951 novel The Catcher in the Rye by American author J. D. Salinger, and instead writes an A+ essay titled, \\"The Slave Trade Allegory of Curious George\\". The two then begin their own personal bonding, and eventually decide to go fishing, leading Chris to catch the comic book superhero Aquaman, before beating him to death and eating him. In the conclusion of the episode, Miley Cyrus begins destroying downtown Quahog, causing the monkey to attempt to stop and reason with her. Not realizing that Stewie had unsuccessfully reprogrammed her, the monkey is then kidnapped, and taken to the top of a nearby skyscraper, in a parody of the 1933 film King Kong. Cyrus is then shot down by Quagmire and Peter while piloting a biplane, before the two rescue the monkey from certain death. After being shot during several passes, Miley's robotic skeleton is partially revealed making her resemble a T-800 from \\"Terminator\\". Reception In a slight improvement over the previous episode, the episode was viewed in 7.73 million homes in its original airing, according to Nielsen ratings, despite airing simultaneously with Sunday Night Football on NBC, The Amazing Race on CBS and Desperate Housewives on ABC. The episode also acquired a 4.0 rating in the 18‚Äì49 demographic, beating Seth & Alex's Almost-Live Comedy Show, The Cleveland Show and the Family Guy episode \\"Brian's Got a Brand New Bag\\", in addition to significantly edging out all three in total viewership. Reviews of the episode from television critics were mostly mixed, who found it to be \\"a thorough examination of both Miley Cyrus and the evil monkey in Chris' closet\\", but, \\"things got ridiculous\\". Television critic Ahsan Haque of IGN gave the episode an 8.5 out of ten, and called it a \\"much better episode than \\"Brian's Got a Brand New Bag\\", with some clever sight gags, an annoyingly catchy musical number, and the revelation of the Evil Monkey's true reasons for hiding in Chris' closet\\". In a simultaneous review of all four MacFarlane programs, Emily VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club gave the episode a C- stating, \\"Turning Miley Cyrus into a Small Wonder parody was fitfully amusing, but the rest of the Hannah Montana material was ridiculously non-specific, filled with the kinds of jokes everyone made about Cyrus a few years ago.\\" VanDerWerff praised the action sequence at the end of the episode, however, calling it \\"high quality stuff for the show\\". Jason Hughes of TV Squad stated of the Evil Monkey's role in the episode, \\"I don't think I ever wanted this character fully explored or seen by anyone else in the house ... The character lost some of its mystique and charm.\\" ReferencesExternal links * * Category:2009 American television episodes Category:Family Guy (season 8) episodes Category:Television episodes about androids ","title":"Hannah Banana"},{"id":"24569660","text":"The Yanga National Park is a newly formed national park, located near the township of Balranald in south- western New South Wales.

It is largely located in the Lower Murrumbidgee Floodplain (or Lowbidgee Floodplain), which is included on A Directory of Important Wetlands in Australia because of its importance as a breeding site for waterbirds when flooded. History=Establishment Yanga was formerly an important pastoral station established by William Wentworth, an explorer, in the 1830s, and later part of C. B. Fisher's pastoral empire. In July 2005, the New South Wales Government announced that it had purchased the station for the creation of a national park.

The Murrumbidgee Valley National Park was created in 2010, with the park protecting part of what is now the largest continuous tract of river red gum forest in the world. Aboriginal heritage Yanga National Park lies within the traditional tribal areas the Muthi Muthi people. The NSW National Parks & Wildlife Service has recognised the importance of aboriginal sites to the aboriginal and broader community, so have developed an Aboriginal sites register covering the park.

At the time, Yanga Station was the largest privately owned station in the southern hemisphere, covering . Yanga homestead was built around 1870, and still stands today. Before the property was purchased in 2005, the site was mostly freehold except for the of crown land of Yanga Nature Reserve. Prior to the purchase, the majority (over 90%) of the land was used for grazing. Climate Climate in Yanga National Park is classified as warm persistently dry grassland based on a modified K√∂ppen classification system. The area has a semi-arid climate with low rainfall, with average annual rainfall of approximately and hot summers, with high evaporation rates all year round. Ecology=Wetlands The Yanga National Park incorporates 12 different wetland types according to the Ramsar Convention classification system, including inland wetlands and human- made wetlands. The national park includes four significant lakes (Yanga Lake, Tala Lake, Piggery Lake, Irrigation Lake), hundreds of waterways including canals and creeks, and extensive river red gum forest along the Murrumbidgee River. Most of Yanga National Park located in the Lowbidgee Floodplain, which is considered to be of national environmental significance, and was listed as a Nationally Important Wetland within the Directory of Important Wetlands in 2000. It is one of the most significant wetland habitats for waterbirds in eastern Australia and has supported some of the largest waterbird breeding colonies in Australia and is home to the State‚Äôs largest known population of the endangered southern bell frog. Flora Seventeen vegetation classes have been identified in the Yanga National Park, with more than 300 plant species being recorded.McCosker R 2008. Yanga vegetation mapping: historical community extent and condition. Technical report to NSW Department of Environment and Climate Change,Sydney. River red gum forest/woodland, black box woodland, lignum/nitre goosefoot (Chenopodium nitrariaceum) shrubland, and spike rush (Eleocharis spp.) dominated sedgeland are identified as important vegetation classes in the area. Fauna The Yanga National Park and surrounding floodplain has provided an important refuge and habitat for a wide range of biodiversity including: * 24 reptile species including geckos, goannas, dragons, skinks, snakes and turtles. * 18 fish species, with European carp dominating most areas. * 33 mammal species, including 7 introduced species (European red fox, red deer, feral cat, brown hare, rabbit, house mouse and the destructive feral pig). =Birds= Extensive bird studies and surveys have been undertaken in the area, but the number of birds recorded during a particular study has generally depended on the amount of water in the area during the study. A total of 64 waterbird species from 14 families have been recorded in the park. There are 12 listed vulnerable species (under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999) recorded within the Yanga National Park, and includes the Australasian bittern, freckled duck and blue-billed duck. This area has been identified as one of the most significant wetland habitats for waterbirds in eastern Australia. Lignum floodways are a popular breeding habitat for a large range of waterbird species including ibis, and flooded areas of red gum forest provide habitat for nesting egrets, spoonbills and cormorants. Migratory species under the Japan‚ÄìAustralia Migratory Bird Agreement (JAMBA), the China‚ÄìAustralia Migratory Bird Agreement (CAMBA) and the Republic of Korea‚ÄìAustralia Migratory Bird Agreement (ROKAMBA) that have been recorded to regularly use wetlands within the Yanga National Park and surrounding areas include the Caspian tern, Latham‚Äôs snipe, cattle egret, and the black-tailed godwit. =Frogs= Southern bell frog (Litoria raniformis) Limited historical information is available on frogs in Yanga National Park, but historical and recent surveys have recorded a total of 12 species of frogs from three families within the park. This includes the southern bell frog (Litoria raniformis) which is listed as endangered under the Threatened Species Conservation Act. The southern bell frog was once widespread and abundant throughout south-eastern Australia, but since the early 1980s its population and distribution have been reduced to a critical level. As there is limited historical and frog information from this area, it is not known when the southern bell frog populations began to decline within the area. However, it has been identified that the southern bell frog is vulnerable to habitat loss, fragmentation and degradation, altered flooding regimes, drought, predation by introduced fish and predation by other introduced species such as feral pigs and foxes. Environmental issues and threats=Alteration to the natural flow regimes The major threat facing the condition of the wetlands in Yanga National Park is the alteration of natural flow regimes. There has been an overall reduction to flows to this area due to river regulation (dam and weir), water diversion, and alteration of flows within floodplains with levees and structures. Changes to natural flow regime over the past 30 years has reduced wetland availability, has led to a decline in extent and condition of flood dependent vegetation, and has caused a reduction in flora and fauna that require specific flow regimes and water availability. Waterbirds have specific requirements to commence and complete breeding, and changes to these conditions have led to decreases in the number of waterbirds recorded in the area. River regulation and the construction of levee banks to control floodwaters in the Nimmie-Caira system have reduced wetland availability by 60% (1975‚Äì1988) and caused total numbers of waterbirds to decline by 80% (1983‚Äì2000). Habitat loss and fragmentation Another major threat facing the condition of the wetlands in Yanga National Park is habitat loss and fragmentation. Much of this habitat loss is historical, due to the property being used for grazing, but has been exacerbated by changes to flow regime and loss of vegetation that traditionally relied on wetting. Using historical floodplain maps and satellite imagery, Kingsford investigated floodplain loss in Lowbidgee from the turn of the 20th century. They found that 37,253 hectares (41%) of wetlands have been lost to developed land within the area. While the development of floodplains for agricultural production in Yanga National Park ceased in 2005 when the property was purchased by the government, there has still been an accelerated the loss and fragmentation of floodplain. Introduced species There have been 58 introduced plant species identified in Yanga National Park. The wide spread of introduced small ground plants reflects the agricultural history of the site. The prolonged dry period in water-plant dominated areas (i.e. shallow temporary swamps) and lake beds increases the risk of exotic plant invasion. A number of surveys found that introduced fish species, in particular European carp (Cyprinus carpio), goldfish (Carassius auratus) and eastern gambusia (Gambusia holbrooki), dominate waterways within the park. Introduced fish species pose a threat to native fish species as predators, competitors, disease carriers and through modification of habitat and are thought to be a significant contributor to reductions in native fish species abundance in the Murrumbidgee catchment. Predation by European carp may also contribute to the decline in the southern bell frog population in Lowbidgee. Other introduced animals of concern include feral pigs, cats and European red foxes. These animals prey on small native animals such as lizards, frogs and ground-nesting birds. Other human impacts Prior to the gazettal of the area as a national park in 2007, numerous land management practices occurred in Yanga National Park, including grazing, clearing, logging and burning. Although all these practices have been stopped, some of them have long lasting impacts on the ecological character of the site. Management and protection=Current protection in placeEnvironmental watering= Since the purchase of the property in 2005, more than of environmental water has been delivered to Yanga wetlands by both the Australian and NSW governments through the Rivers Environmental Restoration Program. The 2010-11 environmental water deliveries, which inundated some areas that have not received water since the late 1980s, including Yanga Lake and significant areas of threatened black box woodland. This has achieved outstanding broad scale benefits for the wetlands. The water has delivered benefits to wetland vegetation, black box woodland, river red gum forests and supported populations of the nationally threatened southern bell frog, and maintained nesting sites for many waterbird species. =Legislation= Since the gazettal of Yanga National Park in 2007, the area is now covered by the National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 (NSW) and the National Parks and Wildlife Regulation 2009. The National Parks and Wildlife Act 1974 (NSW) is the legislation with the explicit intent of conserving their State's natural and cultural heritage; fostering public appreciation, understanding and enjoyment of their State's natural and cultural heritage; and managing any lands reserved for the purposes of conserving and fostering public appreciation and enjoyment of the State's natural and/or cultural heritage. Every national park is covered by a plan of management and fire management strategies. Plans of management contain information on the natural environments, Aboriginal heritage, history, and recreational opportunities in a park. As Yanga National Park is relatively new, these specific documents are still under development. Benefits of protection Changed management practices and protection of the Yanga National Park has and will protect many flora and fauna species and ecological communities. =Supports Ecological communities= There are two ecological communities within Yanga National Park which are listed as endangered under the New South Wales Threatened Species Conservation Act (1995), Myall woodland and an aquatic ecological community in the natural drainage system of the lower Murray River catchment. There is currently about 30 hectares of Myall woodland in Yanga National Park located north of Yanga Lake. The community consists of low woodland, with a tree layer of mostly weeping Myall or boree (Acacia pendula) as the dominant species. The understorey includes an open layer of chenopod shrubs and other woody plant species and an open to continuous groundcover of grasses and herbs. In the past land clearing and overgrazing by feral and domestic animals were the major threats to this ecological community within Yanga National Park. Since the purchase of the property in 2005, the threat of further land clearing has been diminished, however grazing by feral and domestic animals such as kangaroos and rabbits still poses a risk to the community. The aquatic ecological community in the natural drainage system of the lower Murray River catchment includes all native fish and aquatic invertebrates within all natural creeks, rivers and associated lagoons, billabongs and lakes of the regulated portions of the Murray River below the Hume Weir, the Murrumbidgee River below Burrinjuck Dam, and the Tumut River below Blowering Dam, as well as all their tributaries and branches. In Yanga National Park, permanent and intermittent river channels, intermittent swamps, and billabongs make up components of this ecological community. The modification of natural river flows as a result of river regulation (dams, weirs) has been identified as the main threat to this ecological community. The changed river flow regimes lead to reduced habitat quality, loss of spawning cues, and reduced opportunities for dispersal and migration. Grazing also contributes to the degradation; however, the exclusion of livestock after gazettal as a national park should ease this pressure. =Supports threatened fauna species= Twenty- one endangered or vulnerable fauna have been recorded within Yanga National Park. The endangered species include three birds, one amphibian and one reptile, while the vulnerable species include 14 birds and two mammals. The loss, fragmentation and degradation of habitats were identified as major threats for a majority of the listed species. The gazettal of the national park in 2007 will lead to a decrease in the loss of appropriate habitats. =Supports an abundance of waterbirds= Yanga National Park and the surrounding Lowbidgee floodplain has been identified as a nationally important habitat for colonially-nesting waterbirds. This includes providing habitat for threatened species such as the Australasian bittern (Botaurus poiciloptilus), black- tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), blue-billed duck (Oxyura australis) and freckled duck (Stictonetta naevosa). This area has also been identified as an important area for migratory waterbird habitat in New South Wales. There are 11 migratory species covered by the international agreements for migratory birds (JAMBA, CAMBA, and ROKAMBA) recorded in Yanga National Park and adjacent areas. Despite studies indicating that waterbird numbers have declined in this area, throughout Australia, and worldwide, the Lowbidgee floodplain and Yanga National Park still remains a significant breeding, feeding and nestling habitat contributing to sustaining the waterbird population, especially in inland Australia. Changes to management within the National Park area, including increased watering to this area and decreased destruction to wetland areas will provide ideal habitat for waterbirds into the future. =Supports threatened flora species= Two endangered and two vulnerable flora species have been recorded in Yanga National Park. Thirteen threatened plant species are known or predicted to occur in the lower Murrumbidgee region, such as lanky buttons (Leptorhynchos orientalis) and silky swainson-pea (Swainsona sericea). As there has been no systematic flora survey in Yanga National Park, more threatened flora species are likely to occur in the park.

( ; 1815 ‚Äì December 1874) was the 97th monarch of Cambodia. Her official title was Her Majesty Samdech Preah Maha Rajini Ang Mey. She was one of three female rulers in Cambodia's history, the others being Queen Soma and Queen Sisowath Kossamak. Installed on the Cambodian throne by the Vietnamese, her reign was dominated by the Siamese-Vietnamese War (1841‚Äì1845) Queen Ang Mey or Ksat Trey, also known by her Vietnamese title Ng·ªçc-V√¢n-c√¥ng-ch√∫a (Princess Ng·ªçc V√¢n), was proclaimed monarch on the death of her father by the Vietnamese faction at court with the title of \\"Ch√¢n L·∫°p qu·∫≠n ch√∫a\\" (Duchess of Cambodia) in January 1835, then deposed in August 1840 with the demoted title of \\"M·ªπ- L√¢m-qu·∫≠n-ch√∫a\\" (Duchess of M·ªπ L√¢m). She was reinstated in 1844, and again removed from the throne by the Vietnamese and taken to Hu·∫ø with her sisters in 1845. Biography=Early life Ang Mey was born in 1815 as the second daughter of Ang Chan II, king of Cambodia during the Oudong period, by his second wife, Neak Moneang Krachap. After King Ang Chan II died in 1834, there was no heir apparent to the Khmer throne. The king had no son but four daughters: Princess Baen, Mey, Peou and Sngon.Sexual Culture in the east Asia pp, 127‚Äì155 This delighted Vietnam and Siam, both of which wanted to eliminate the royal rulers in Cambodia. Although Ang Chan's surviving brothers, Ang Im and Ang Duang, immediately laid claim to the throne, the Vietnamese then occupying Cambodia did not allow them to be crowned. Instead, the Vietnamese emperor and the Cambodian courtiers chose to install Ang Chan II's eldest daughter, Princess Ang Baen, as the sovereign. However, she was passed over due to her being sympathetic to the Thai court's interests and her refusal to marry the emperor's son.Fieldnote, 2006 Ang Mey was an alternative to her sister, Baen. A Thai manuscript stated that the Vietnamese had tried to persuade Ang Mey to marry the son of emperor Gia Long in order to facilitate the incorporation of Cambodia into Vietnam, however this plan was abandoned at strong objections from Cambodian nobles.Gender in election, p. 7 Puppet queen In May 1835, Ang Mey was crowned with the title of quan-chua (ÈÉ°‰∏ª) or \\"Commandery Princess,\\" a title of princess which was lower than gong-chua (ÂÖ¨‰∏ª), bestowed by the court of Hu√©. Her three sisters were given the title huyen quan (Á∏£Âêõ), or \\"sub-prefecture ladies\\".A Comparation analysis of traditional and contemporary of female house hold p 48 by Andrey Riffaund The Vietnamese kept close guard over the Ang princesses. Queen Ang Mey had two companies of soldiers, 100 men in total, for her personal protection. The other three Cambodian princesses were each assigned thirty soldiers. Ostensibly for their safety, the guards were in reality assigned to ensure that they did not escape.Lost goddesses: the denial of female power in Cambodian history by Trudy Jacobsen, p. 112 During Ang Mey's reign, all Cambodian women were ordered to wear Vietnamese-style pyjamas instead of the khmer sampot (similar to the sarong), and had to grow their hair long in Vietnamese style.Fieldnote, 2005, 2006Violent against woman in Asian society 2003, p. 107 The market sold only Vietnamese food. Khmer classical dance had assimilated elements of Vietnamese and Chinese tradition. Cambodian officials had to don Vietnamese ceremonial garb. Wats were destroyed in order to eradicate the Khmer identity.Cambodian people by Sipar, p. 29 Places also received Vietnamese names. The area around Phnom Penh was renamed from Annam to Tran Tay, or \\"Western Commandery\\".Phnom Penh: a cultural and literary history By Milton Osborne, p. 51 The Cambodian people, not accustomed to be ruled by a Queen and despairing of the \\"Vietnamization\\" of their country, asked the Siamese to install a male ruler, Ang Duong, brother of Ang Chan II. In 1840, the elder sister of Ang Mey, Princess Baen, was discovered corresponding with her mother and uncle who were living in Battambang and planning to escape to them. The princess was imprisoned pending her trial in Phnom Penh. The Vietnamese emperor, Minh M·∫°ng, demoted Mey and the other princesses. In August 1841 they were all arrested and deported to Vietnam along with the royal regalia. Around that time, some of Ang Mey's relatives were imprisoned on the island of Poulo Condore. According to Thai and Cambodian sources, Ang Baen was drowned in the Mekong river, although Khin Sok states that Baen was tortured to death by the Vietnamese general and her body thrown in the river.Trudy Jacobsen, Lost goddesses: the denial of female power in Cambodian history, p. 113 Spurred by the death of Princess Ang Baen and the absence of their Queen Ang Mey, many Cambodian courtiers and their followers revolted against the Vietnamese rule. Seizing the opportunity Siam invaded Cambodia in an attempt to install Ang Duong on the throne as their own puppet, triggering the Siamese‚ÄìVietnamese War (1841‚Äì45). In an attempt to defuse the rebellion, Vietnamese officials in Phnom Penh called for the return of Mey to Cambodia but the emperor Ming Mang refused. Only when the Vietnamese counter- offensive gained momentum and victory seemed assured was Mey returned to Phnom Penh. Her proclamation in March 1844 intended for the provincial officials and leaders sought their support while Ang Duong issued similar appeals from Oudong for his claim to the throne.Lost goddesses: the denial of female power in Cambodian history By Trudy Jacobsen, p.114 Queen Ang Mey was reinstated as a queen and her sisters, Poeu and Sngon, as sub-prefecture rulers, in 1844. As the warring factions fought to a stalemate in 1845, the Thai and Vietnamese initiated talks to resolve the Cambodian succession. In October 1846, the Vietnamese released the daughter and other family members of Ang Duong to join him in Oudong. Vietnam and Siam forged a compromise whereby both Ang Duong and Ang Mey would rule together are co-sovereigns. However, when the simultaneous coronation was held in Bangkok and Phnom Penh in 1848, records only show Ang Duong's accession to the throne. His niece, Ang Mey, was recorded as his successor instead of co-sovereign. Later life After her reign concluded, Ang Mey lived with memories of death and dishonour for over twenty years. She did not succeed the throne after Ang Duong's death. His son and heir, Norodom, left her in the care of an old retainer when he and his court moved to Phnom Penh. At Oudong, Ang Mey carried on, although sources described her as \\"unbalanced\\" when she took merchandise by her right as queen. Her servants had to intervene to placate the merchants.River Road to China: The Search for the Source of the Mekong, 1866-73 By Milton Osborne p. 26 She later married an unknown man and had two daughters. She and her husband died in an accident in late December 1874 but were cremated at Phnom Penh in 1884. Life and reign of scandal Ang Mey was portrayed as a puppet of the Vietnamese emperor and officials in sources like The Cambodia Chronicle. Ang Duong took care to emphasize association between Mey and the Vietnamese, and blamed her rule for the loss of indentured slaves. Most chronicles of the period imply that the Cambodian courtiers acquiesced to Ang Mey as their sovereign while secretly holding out for Ang Im or Ang Duong to return as sovereign. There were even rumors that Mey was a concubine of Truong Minh Giang, the Vietnamese governor in Phnom Penh but there is no historical evidence of such a liaison.Khmer woman on the move, p. 113 Others tempered their allegation of Ang Mey's misdeeds; the once beautiful princess may have sold her country, but not her body, to the Vietnamese.River Road to China: The Search for the Source of the Mekong, 1866-73 by Milton Osborne p. 25 During the succession crisis, Ang Mey did seem to seek a peaceful solution to the factional strife in Cambodia, corresponding through Ang Duong's envoys that she wished for a return to peace and the family's reunion. This may have been at diplomatic response; the Vietnamese annals described her as an intelligent young lady at the time of her accession.Lost goddesses: the denial of female power in Cambodian history By Trudy Jacobsen p. 117 Sudden and forced relocations to Vietnam and back, the murder of her sisters, and continued changes in her status may have induced hysterical or untoward behaviour. By the end of her reign, Ang Mey reportedly was mad. Cambodian history has constructed Mey as a passive victim hardly legitimate in the eye of her own people,Phnom Penh Post, 20 December 2002 ‚Äì 2 January 2003, p 14 her reign a disaster during which Khmer territory, culture, and independence was almost lost. While it cannot be denied that the Vietnamese were in control of Cambodia during Ang Mey's reign, she inherited a country that had already been mortgaged to the Court of Hu√© by her father, Ang Chan II. Mey was crowned sovereign of a kingdom under Vietnamese overlordship. It is difficult to ascertain what course of action other than acquiescence was available to her.Lost goddesses: the denial of female power in Cambodian history by Trudy Jacobsen p. 116 References Category:19th-century Cambodian monarchs Category:Cambodian queens Category:Cambodian Buddhist monarchs Category:History of Cambodia Category:1874 deaths Category:1815 births Category:19th-century women rulers Category:19th-century Cambodian women ","title":"Ang Mey"},{"id":"24569687","text":"The International University of Management (IUM) is a private, state- recognized university based in Windhoek, Namibia.

The Irish Republican Army (IRA) mounted an attack on a train carrying British soldiers at Upton, County Cork. The action was a disaster for the IRA; three of its volunteers were killed and two wounded. Six British soldiers were wounded, three seriously. Six civilian passengers were killed and ten wounded in the crossfire. Background According to a study of the region, Cork was \\"by far the most violent county in Ireland\\" during the War of Independence and had several active guerrilla brigades.Hart 1998, p. 50‚Äì51. Of these, the Third (west Cork) was one of the most effective and it was a unit from this Brigade that carried out the Upton ambush. Up until the end of 1920, the British had been unable to move troops by train, due to a nationwide boycott by railway workers of trains carrying the British military. However, this strike was lifted in December 1920.Hopkinson 2002, p. 112. While this helped the British military's mobility, it also gave the IRA a new target: trains carrying soldiers. A week before the Upton ambush, the local IRA had made a successful attack on a train travelling from Killarney to Millstreet near Drishanbeg, killing one sergeant and wounding five more soldiers. Ambush Five days after the Drishanbeg ambush, plans were made for an attack at Upton and Innishannon railway station on a train travelling between Cork city and Bandon. The ambushers, led by Charlie Hurley, were 13 strong but had only 7 rifles, the remainder being equipped only with revolvers or semi- automatic pistols.Barry 1981, p. 93. They took up position at the station ten minutes before the train pulled in, imprisoning the station master, clearing the station and taking cover behind sacks of grain and flour taken from a store. The train was carrying around 50 British soldiers of the Essex Regiment, who were mingled with civilian passengers throughout the train's carriages. The IRA party was therefore quite heavily outnumbered and out- gunned. However they were not warned of this, as two IRA scouts, who were supposed to have been on the train and signalled to them of British numbers, never turned up. They also wrongly believed that the British troops were all in the central carriage. As a result, when the IRA opened fire on the train, there were heavy civilian casualties. The New York Times reported that \\"a shower of bullets was rained on the train, practically every compartment being swept\\".New York Times 16 February 1921 The firefight lasted for only ten minutes, but in that time six civilian passengers were killed and ten wounded in the firing between the British and IRA. Six British soldiers were also injured, three of them seriously. Two IRA volunteers were killed outright, another was fatally wounded and two more were badly wounded but survived.Hopkinson 2002 p. 112‚Äì113. Charlie Hurley, who had led the ambush, was among the wounded, being struck in the face by a bullet. IRA leader Tom Barry later wrote, \\"Through some miracle, the nine unwounded and two wounded got away across country, in small parties, with the British following close behind\\".Barry 1981, p. 94. Three civilian passengers, one unwounded and two wounded were detained by the British on suspicion of belonging to the ambush party. Aftermath The Upton ambush was part of what Tom Barry described as \\"twelve dark days\\" for the 3rd Cork Brigade of the IRA. Between 4 February and 16 February, eleven members of the Brigade were killed. One was shot dead by British troops when they raided a safehouse on the 4th, another died in an accidental shooting on the 7th, two more (the Coffey brothers) were assassinated in their beds on the 14th by Black and Tans or Auxiliaries, three died at Upton on the 15th and four were killed on the 16th when they were arrested by the Essex Regiment in Kilbrittain while digging a trench and shot dead.Barry 1981, p. 96‚Äì98. Of the eleven dead, only those at Upton were killed in combat. The Upton attack also highlighted the dangers, and particularly the risk to civilians, of attacking trains carrying troops. Only a month later at the Headford Ambush in neighbouring County Kerry, an IRA column successfully attacked a train-load of troops, but again, there were civilian casualties alongside the IRA and British Army losses. One of the three men captured by the British at Upton is reported to have given information leading to the Third Cork Brigade's main column of over 100 fighters almost being encircled at the Crossbarry Ambush. Hurley himself was killed in this action.Hopkinson 2002, p. 111. The Upton ambush was later made famous in a popular 1960s Irish ballad titled \\"The Lonely Woods of Upton\\".Begley 1999, p. 112 NotesReferences  *Begley, Diarmuid (1999).

He is an international speaker, teacher and writer, and an advocate of non-violence. Thomas was brought to Buddhism by Vietnamese Zen Buddhist teacher Thich Nhat Hanh, and was ordained in 1995 by Tetsugen Bernard Glassman of the Zen Peacemaker Order. Thomas teaches Buddhist meditation practice and dharma to the public through social projects, talks, and retreats. Since 1994, Thomas has walked on peace pilgrimages throughout Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and the United States. While walking, Thomas carries no money, and begs for food and shelter in the mendicant monk tradition. He is the author of At Hell's Gate: A Soldier's Journey from War to Peace (2004) and founder of the Zaltho Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to ending violence.  Early life  Thomas was born in November 1947 in Pennsylvania and grew up in the town of Waterford. His father was a teacher and World War II veteran, and his mother worked as a barmaid, waitress, and house cleaner. His grandfather was a World War I veteran and one of his great-grandfathers fought in the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War. Thomas experienced an abusive childhood; his mother physically abused him in his home, and his father was emotionally distant. In one incident, his mother threw him down a flight of stairs, and in another his father severely beat him. His relatives spoke glowingly about their war experiences, talking about it as a great adventure and influencing the young Thomas. When he was 11, his parents separated. Thomas began studying Korean style Karate (Hapkido) at the age of 14; His teacher worked closely with him and practiced a secular form of Zen that did not include the teachings of the Buddha. In school, Thomas was a competitive athlete and was influenced by the warrior mentality he found on the playing field.Thomas 2004, p.11Rothschild 2005: For example, chanting Kill! Kill! Kill! at the opposing team. He was influenced by Hollywood movies, which sold him on the idea of going to war. Thomas was offered an athletic scholarship to attend college, but turned it down when his father convinced him he was not ready for college and was afraid he would drop out. Thomas would often steal cars for joyriding and lived by his own rules.Thomas 2004, p.10 After graduating from high school in 1965 he joined the U.S. Army, and later with his father's permission, he volunteered to serve in Vietnam at the age of 17. Vietnam War service From September 1966 to November 1967, Thomas served as a helicopter crew chief in the Vietnam War. He began as a door gunner with the 90th Replacement Battalion in Long Binh and was next assigned to the 116th Assault Helicopter Company in Phu Loi, where he began using the M60 machine gun. On one ground patrol, Thomas and four other men in his unit were fired upon by men dressed as Buddhist monks carrying weapons beneath their robes. All five soldiers were wounded and three died. As a soldier, Thomas killed several hundred Vietnamese people.Thomas 2004: \\"At the age of seventeen I enlisted in the U.S. Army and volunteered for service in Vietnam. By taking up arms, I was directly responsible for killing several hundred people, and the killing didn't stop until I was honorably discharged and sent home with numerous medals....\\"(xi) \\"During my tour in Vietnam I was directly responsible for the deaths of many, many people. But after the horrors of basic training, and after my childhood of abuse and neglect, I didn't recognize what I was doing as killing people. The enemy was simply the enemy, not human.\\" (15) \\"My job in Vietnam was to kill people. By the time I was first injured in combat (two or three months into my tour), I had already been directly responsible for the deaths of several hundred people. And today, each day, I can still see many of their faces.\\" (20) See also: Kotler 1996 and The helicopter crews he worked on made bets among themselves on which soldiers could kill the most enemy troops.Rothschild 2005. Event occurs at 18:22-18:41: \\"When I crewed gunships, one of the things I used to do...is we would get together before we took off, we would pool our money. Those with the most confirmed kills at the end of the day would collect that money...\\". See also: Glassman 1998, p.61 Thomas survived being shot down five times. On the fifth occasion, in mid-1967, he was shot down in the Mekong Delta. The pilot and commander were killed and the gunner and Thomas were wounded. Thomas was injured in the shoulder and face, and broke his jaw, cheekbones, ribs and neck, and split his sternum.Glassman 1998, p.61. Thomas received 25 Air Medals, the equivalent of 625 combat hours, and the Distinguished Flying Cross and the Purple Heart military decorations.Thomas 2006, p.xi, 19. See also: Lindgren 2006: \\"When he returned from Vietnam in 1967, Thomas was awarded the Purple Heart and Distinguished Flying Cross.\\" Piasecki 2006: \\"awarded the Purple Heart and Distinguished Flying Cross\\". Return to U.S. Thomas was returned to the U.S. and spent nine months in physical therapy recovering from his shoulder injury at the Ireland Army Community Hospital in Fort Knox, Kentucky. He was released from the hospital and honorably discharged from the Army on August 23, 1968.Thomas 2004, pp.26-27 Thomas returned to a country that still supported the war, but many employers would not hire veterans, and he had difficulty finding a job. He carried a gun everywhere, and slept with one for protection. He tried to forget about the war, and did not speak much about it, but he could not stop thinking about it. \\"Everywhere I looked there was the war.\\" Thomas got married and enrolled at Slippery Rock University of Pennsylvania where he studied English Education, but soon found himself homeless, unemployed and addicted to drugs and alcohol. He spent several spells in jail, and tried to cope with the symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). Images of the war replayed themselves in his mind, leading to the disintegration of his marriage and the abandonment of his wife and son. PTSD made it difficult to sleep, and at night he would relive his memories of the war. For two years, Thomas lived in a burned-out car in the Strip District in Pittsburgh.Marinello 2007: \\"I was attempting to make my history disappear, make my life disappear. There isn't any one way to do this but how we wrap ourselves up in an effort to avoid the karma that we've inherited. In ignorance of the karma that I inherited, then, I continued to repeat these cycles in unawareness. I keep the cycle of war, violence, and suffering alive in unawareness thinking that I'm not, in contrary to the teachings that exist, the fundamental teachings in the Diamond Sutra, which tell me that just because I believe or think of things so, doesn't make it so.\\" He began traveling outside the U.S. in 1970, and in 1974, Thomas bought a one-way ticket from London to Iran, and later returned to the U.S. In the early 1980s, Thomas worked as a counselor for the Veteran's Outreach Center in Boston.The Hour (1982-02-25) In 1983, Thomas successfully completed drug rehabilitation in New Hampshire, and stopped carrying a gun in 1984 because he no longer felt it kept him safe. Although he had studied and taught martial arts for 27 years, he realized that martial arts was contributing to the \\"seeds of violence\\", and he stopped his involvement in 1989.Glassman 1998, p.62 Thomas later received a master's degree from Lesley College in Management and reconciled with his son. Buddhism In the beginning of the 1990s, Thomas was residing in Concord, Massachusetts. Confined to his home and afraid to go outside, Thomas experienced the symptoms of severe PTSD. When he did leave, jets flying overhead would make him think he was under attack. If he went grocery shopping, he would imagine that the canned goods were booby- trapped.Thomas 2004, p.3 To deal with these feelings, he began working with a social worker in Cambridge, who recommended visiting a retreat for Vietnam veterans run by Thich Nhat Hanh, a Vietnamese Buddhist monk. Thomas traveled to Rhinebeck, New York, to attend a retreat at the Omega Institute. Several months later, a nun invited Thomas to Plum Village Monastery in France to work directly with the Vietnamese community. Thich Nhat Hanh invited Thomas to become a monk in 1992, but Thomas refused because he was not ready. Actor and Zen Buddhist Michael O'Keefe introduced Thomas to Tetsugen Bernard Glassman in 1994.Glassman 1998, p.60 While participating in a peace pilgrimage in Auschwitz, Thomas took sixteen vows as a Zen Peacemaker from Glassman on December 6 at the Birkenau extermination camp. During the ceremony, Glassman gave Thomas two new names: Anshin (\\"Heart of Peace\\") and Angyo (\\"Peacemaker\\").Glassman 1998, p.19: The sixteen vows are as follows: \\"I vow to be oneness; I vow to be diversity; I vow to be harmony; I vow to penetrate the unknown; I vow to bear witness; I vow to heal myself and others; I vow not to kill; I vow not to steal; I vow not to be greedy; I vow not to tell lies; I vow not to be ignorant; I vow not to talk about others' errors and faults; I vow not to elevate myself by blaming others; I vow not to be stingy; I vow not to be angry; I vow not to speak ill of myself and others.\\" Less than a year later, Glassman ordained Thomas as a Zen Buddhist monk in the Japanese Soto and Rinzai Zen tradition in Yonkers, New York, on August 6, 1995. Writing Thomas began publishing essays, poetry, and books about his experience as a veteran and Buddhist after combining mindfulness meditation and writing, a practice he learned at the Veterans Writing Workshop organized by author Maxine Hong Kingston. In 1996, he wrote an essay called \\"Finding Peace after a Lifetime of War\\", which was published in a collection of works about Engaged Buddhism by Parallax Press. His poems were published in 1997 as part of the poetry collection, What book!? Buddha Poems from Beat to Hiphop, and in 2004, Shambhala Publications released his first book, At Hell's Gate: A Soldier's Journey from War to Peace. In Italy, At Hell's Gate was published by Arnoldo Mondadori Editore as Una volta ero un soldato ‚Äì Dall'orrore del Vietnam all'incontro con il Buddhismo. In 2006, selected work by Thomas was included in Kingston's Veterans of War, Veterans of Peace, a collection of stories by veterans who attended Kingston's workshops. Pilgrimages Thomas walking Thomas organizes and participates in international peace pilgrimages. Clothed in only robes and carrying no money, Thomas leads groups of Buddhists who travel between towns begging for food and lodging, a practice known as takuhatsu. This practice of generosity is rooted in the Buddhist virtue called dƒÅna, the first of the ten pƒÅramitƒÅs. Buddhists like Thomas are trying to keep the practice of dƒÅna alive, as they believe that the act of giving benefits those who give.Thomas 1999: \\"The act of giving itself is of immeasurable benefit to the giver: for it opens up the heart, diminishes for a moment one's self-absorption, and places value on the well-being of others. The simple gesture of offering a flower, or an act of service, a kind thought or a simple meal is in fact a sincere form of practice. The size or value of the gift is of almost no importance - the act of giving itself generates a thought-moment devoid of greed and full of loving kindness.\\" Since 1994, Thomas has walked on peace pilgrimages. Auschwitz to Vietnam In December 1994, Sasamori Shonin and other Japanese Nichiren Buddhist monks helped organize and lead a meeting of 200 people at Auschwitz for The Interfaith Pilgrimage for Peace and Life., an eight-month peace march from Auschwitz to Hiroshima, which was timed to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the liberation of the Auschwitz concentration camp. Thomas helped lead the peace pilgrimage that would allow him to \\"bear witness to major sites of war and violence\\" through 27 countries in Eastern Europe and Asia. The pilgrimage continued to Vienna, Croatia, Hungary, Serbia, Romania, Bulgaria, Greece, the West Bank, Gaza, Israel, Jordan, Iraq, India, Malaysia, Thailand, Cambodia, and Vietnam, where Thomas was accompanied by his son.Glassman 1998, p.64 Because of the distances to be covered, closed borders and government restrictions, the group was unable to walk on occasions and had traveled by alternative means.Thomas 2004, pp.99-109 Reflecting on the march, Thomas writes: > On the pilgrimage from Auschwitz to Vietnam, I went to practice peace, to be > peace, but I was not walking expressly for peace. If I have some > preconceived notion of what peace is, I might never be able to participate > in it. Peace is not an idea, peace is not a political movement, not a theory > or a dogma. Peace is a way of life: living mindfully in the present moment, > breathing, enjoying each breath. Peace becomes. It is fresh and new with > every moment.Thomas 2006, p.109 New York to California In 1998, Thomas and group of Zen Buddhists walked from New York to California in the tradition of mendicant monks. See also: When they arrived in a new town, they would visit local religious organizations and ask them for a place to sleep and eat. If the answer was no, they would sleep outside and go hungry. The group covered an average distance of between and a day with large packs on their backs. They encountered few problems except in the eastern U.S., particularly in the state of Ohio where they were stopped more often by the police.Thomas 2004, p.113: \\"Ohio was the most difficult state that we walked in. In the more than two weeks we spent walking there, only four churches opened their doors to us. But it wasn't the only state where we were turned away. In one town in Pennsylvania, all the churches said no in the middle of a freezing rainstorm that was turning into snow. We ended up sleeping outside in a pig barn at the fairgrounds. And it was one of the most wonderful nights we had. I was so thankful for that shelter.\\" Nevertheless, the group was helped by strangers throughout the country; some invited them into their homes. In Boulder, Colorado, the group used a truck to carry their water through the desert.Thomas 2004, pp.109-122 Germany Thomas and six others walked more than across Germany between August and October 1999; more walkers joined them en route. They held Buddhist retreats and services at sites of \\"terror, abuse, degradation, torture and killing\\", and hundreds of people participated in the events. Hungary to Germany From August to October 2002, Thomas made a pilgrimage from Budapest to the Mauthausen-Gusen concentration camp and then to the Bergen-Belsen concentration camp, following the route of the death marches made by Jews during the Holocaust. Massachusetts to Washington, D.C. From September to October 2004, Thomas and a small group walked from Concord, Massachusetts, through Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, and Delaware, to Washington, D.C.Thomas 2006 [2004], pp.155-156 Texas to California From March to June 2007, Thomas and eight Zen Buddhists walked along the U.S.-Mexico border between Brownsville, Texas and Border Field State Park, Imperial Beach, California. Support was provided by the All Souls Unitarian Universalist Church in Brownsville. See also: It took a month to walk from Brownsville to El Paso during which, the group was often stopped by law enforcement, sometimes by the county sheriff, the National Guard, or the Border Patrol. Each time they were stopped, the officers would approach the group with loaded firearms, expressing concern for their safety. Thomas used these incidents as an opportunity to practice nonviolence. When law enforcement personnel asked if they could do anything for the walkers, Thomas answered, \\"We're ok, we have plenty of water, but could you take your hands off your sidearm?\\" According to Thomas, 87% removed their hands from the gun. He would then ask if he could tell them about their pilgrimage. While passing through West Texas, the group encountered a dust storm; 68 days later, they arrived at the Pacific Ocean. Other activities For more than a decade, Thomas has participated in meditation retreats with war veterans and their families in the United States and Europe. He is often asked how to support returned service personnel. Thomas responds: > Wake up to the roots of war in you. And, allow them to be your teacher. > Because we can't do anything for them, not really, unless they ask us, > unless they want that. But, we can't hear what they're saying, we can't hear > what people are saying, unless we're willing to wake up to our conditioning. > Because it was my conditioning, it was the karma that I inherited, and then > the karma that I was creating that kept me deaf. I couldn't hear. I did not > have the gift of Avalokite≈õvara, of kanzeon, bodhisattva. I didn't have the > gift of hearing. I couldn't hear the sounds of the world.Marinello 2007: > \\"Hearing the sounds of the world\\" refers to the bodhisattva Avalokite≈õvara > or Guan Yin. Avalokitasvara can be translated as \\"he who looks down upon > sound\\", describing the cries of sentient beings who need his help. The > female form, Guanyin, is short for Guanshiyin which is also translated as > \\"observing the sounds (or cries) of the world\\". In 1993, Thomas started the Zaltho Foundation, a non-profit organization committed to ending violence, supporting socially engaged projects in schools, communities, organizations, and families. Programs include pilgrimages, talks, retreats, and outreach to veterans, prisoners, substance abusers, the homeless, and refugees. The foundation operates two Buddhist teaching centers: the Magnolia Zen Center in Mary Esther, Florida and the Clock Tower Practice Center in Maynard, Massachusetts.Thomas 2004, pp.167-168 Publications  See also *Peace Pilgrim Notes and referencesFurther reading and resources  * See also:    * Category:1947 births Category:Living people Category:American army personnel of the Vietnam War Category:American Zen Buddhist teachers Category:Engaged Buddhists Category:Buddhist writers Category:Writers from Pennsylvania Category:Soto Zen Buddhists Category:Zen Buddhist monks and priests Category:Nonviolence advocates Category:People from Concord, Massachusetts Category:Recipients of the Air Medal Category:Recipients of the Distinguished Flying Cross (United States) Category:United States Army soldiers ","title":"Claude AnShin Thomas"}]`),B={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:M},data(){return{visibleCount:3,poemsData:P}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{loadMore(){this.visibleCount+=3}}},I={class:"card-container"};function R(s,e,n,c,u,i){const m=p("PoemCard");return t(),o(h,null,[e[1]||(e[1]=a("section",null,[a("div",{class:"top-Banner"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title"},[a("div",{class:"top-Banner-Title-Text"},"üéâ your bitcoinü•≥")])])],-1)),a("section",null,[a("div",I,[(t(!0),o(h,null,y(i.visiblePoems,(r,g)=>(t(),w(m,{key:g,poem:r},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(t(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...r)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...r))},"See more")):b("",!0)])],64)}const H=d(B,[["render",R]]),F=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/15.md","filePath":"drive/15.md"}'),L={name:"drive/15.md"},N=Object.assign(L,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(t(),o("div",null,[v(H)]))}});export{F as __pageData,N as default};
