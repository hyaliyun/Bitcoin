It was constructed in 1892‚Äì93 and designed by the Exeter architect Edward G. Warren. The church has been Grade II listed since 1952. History St Edward's was built as a chapel of ease to the parish church of St Mary's in Ottery St Mary. At the time, Wiggaton and its surrounding neighbourhood had a population of around 150, with most inhabitants approximately a mile from the parish church. In 1890, Rev. M. Kelly, the vicar of Ottery St Mary, began holding services once a fortnight in Wiggaton's schoolroom. Plans were then made for the erection of a church and funds began to be raised by subscription. The church was designed by Mr. Edward G. Warren of Exeter, with Mr. F. Grace of Exmouth hired as the builder. The foundation stone was laid on 10 November 1892 by William Rennell Coleridge of Salston. The ceremony was attended by the choir of the parish church and a short service conducted by Rev. Kelly. The church, which cost ¬£400 to build, was dedicated to Edward the Confessor by the Bishop of Exeter, the Right Rev. Edward Bickersteth, on 8 March 1893. Architecture St Edward's is built of red brick, with dressings in Corsham Down stone and a slate roof, in the Early English style. It was designed to accommodate approximately 80 persons. The east end of the building is semi-octagonal, and the vestry and organ chamber are located on the south side. The east end has a central triple light window and the west gable has a bell-cote. The roof is open timbered.

From 1850 onwards, he fought in the Caucasian wars, serving with distinction and taking part in special assignments in Daghestan. This was followed by further success in the Khiva campaign of 1873, which saw Lomakin rise to the rank of major general and win various military awards. In 1879, Lomakin became commander of the Akhal-Teke expedition in Turkmenistan, following the death of General I. D. Lazarev. However, he failed in his attempt to take Geok-Tepe fortress and was replaced by General Tergukasov. Afterwards he was posted to Tiflis and gradually rose through the ranks, eventually retiring from the army in 1897 with the rank of general. He died in Tiflis in 1902.

The Wienerg√§ssle links the road with the market place, where the town hall is located.

Apart from the more distant M√ºhlstra√üe (Mill Road), it is the only road leaving the old town to the south. Approximately halfway through the length of the road, it crosses a pedestrian and bicycle tunnel, which continues to the Avenue Bridge.  History  For many years, the buildings in Neckarhalde did not have a sewage system. Building number 7, in particular, became known for its hard-to-clean privy. As described in the \\"Caterpillar hymn\\" (Raupenhymne),Die Raupen-Hymne it was necessary as the winegrowers carried the smelly solids up the mountain to use it as fertilizer on strawberries and grapevines. All T√ºbingen wine growers are colloquially called \\"Caterpillars\\", even if they do not live in Lower T√ºbingen, while the expression \\"G√¥gen\\" usually describes inhabitants of the lower city.Neckarhalde on T√úpedia.

Junctions  The Neckarhalde branches at its upper, northeastern end, the so-called Faules Eck (Lazy corner), into the Burgsteige, Wienerg√§ssle, Kronenstra√üe, M√ºnzgasse and Klosterberg. The origin of this colloquial name is uncertain. It may come from the smell of damp wood or due to the Neckar timber rafting that was transported up the Neckarhalde and for a time was temporarily stored or by the fact that there the woodworking timber traders there scolded the alleged lazy students who watched them and sometimes mocked them. Today, however, it is considered to be most likely that long ago the narrowness, especially for larger transports from the marketplace to the castle, made it less walkable and passable, so in this sense it was a \\"Bad corner\\".Helmut Eck during a guided tour on 27 April 2018. At the lower, southwestern end, the Neckarhalde splits into the Biesinger and Hirschauer roads. In the lower third branch off the avenue bridge, there is a pedestrian tunnel and footpath.  Tunnel  The Neckarhalde is next to the three tunnels through Schlossberg (Castle Hill). = Tunnel of the Ammer Valley Railway = The tunnel of the Ammertalbahn (Ammer Valley Railway) is a single-track railway tunnel through the Schlossberg, which passes under the Neckarhalde. It is 288 m (945 ft) long and was opened on 1 May 1910. Like the entire Ammertalbahn line, the tunnel is not electrified, but it should be electrified by 2022.Werner Bauknecht: Ausbau Ammertalbahn: Alle Weichen sind gestellt: Vorarbeiten ab Oktober: Mit Elektrifizierung und teils zweigleisigem Ausbau wird Mitte 2019 begonnen. =Pedestrian tunnel= South entry of the pedestrian tunnel at the apex of Neckarhalde The pedestrian tunnel ends in the lower third of Neckarhalde. Since the mid-1970s it bypasses Alleenbr√ºcke to the Haagtorplatz in the Schlossberg. Until the completion of Bundesstra√üe 28 in 1979, the tunnel was used for five years as single-lane motor vehicle traffic. Today it is for pedestrians, cyclists and the fire brigade only. Since 2007 mopeds and scooters are prohibited from using the tunnel.Alternative Routen f√ºr die RegionalStadtBahn: Drei alternative Streckenvorschl√§ge on T√úpedia.Regionalstadtbahn Neckar-Alb on www.tagblatt.de = B 296 tunnel = The B 296 tunnel (until the end of 2017 named as B 28) passes under Neckarhalde.

Sashikanth under the banner Y NOT Studios, starring Madhavan, Vijay Sethupathi, Shraddha Srinath, Kathir and Varalaxmi Sarathkumar in the lead roles. The soundtrack album and the background score is composed by Sam C. S. with lyrics written by Mohan Rajan, Muthamil, Vignesh Shivan and the composer respectively. Sam had previously worked with Pushkar and Gayathri on television commercials, before they decided to recruit him, after his work on Puriyatha Puthir, which was his debut film. The soundtrack album features 10 songs, with six instrumental compositions. The team released two singles \\"Tasakku Tasakku\\" on 5 June 2017 and \\"Yaanji\\" on 12 June 2017, before the entire album unveiled on 19 June 2017. The soundtrack received gneerally positive reception from critics.  Development  Sam composed the score based on the script instead of doing it after watching the film's final version. He used the same approach for Puriyatha Puthir. He believed this would give him more creative freedom while also helping the actors and directors understand how to depict the emotions the characters portray in a particular sequence. In an interview with Kaushik LM of The Hindu, Sam said he \\"used ethnic Indian instruments, and live orchestra\\" to compose the score. He completed 80 percent of the score before the commencement of principal photography, leading Pushkar and Gayathri to shoot the scenes according to the music he composed. After shooting for the film ended, Sam fine-tuned the score to achieve better results. Pushkar and Gayathri had initially opted against including songs in the film, but then thought lyrics might work better than music alone and changed their decision. Sam employed the vocal percussion technique of beatboxing for the track \\"Tasakku Tasakku\\" as he felt it would be better to use \\"real sounds\\" to depict the atmosphere in a bar. At Sethupathi's insistence, Vignesh Shivan was hired to write the lyrics for \\"Karuppu Vellai\\".  Release  The audio rights of the soundtrack album were acquired by Think Music. The team released the first single \\"Tasakku Tasakku\\" on 5 June 2017, rendered by Mukesh, M. L. R. Karthikeyan, Sam C. S. and Guna. Followed by the second single track, \\"Yaanji\\" on 12 June 2017, which is a melodius composition rendered by Anirudh Ravichander and Shakthisree Gopalan, with lyrics written by Mohan Rajan. The entire soundtrack album was unveiled through all streaming platforms on 19 June 2017.  Track listing   Background score  The original background score from the film, composed by Sam C. S. was released on 10 August 2017. It features 10 bonus original compositions, with six scores in the film were included in the film's soundtrack album. Notes * Tracks 11 to 16, in the OST, where already released with the soundtrack album.  Reception  Sharanya CR from The Times of India noted in her review that Sam \\"brings out the essence of the film‚Äôs plot\\" with \\"Karuppu Vellai\\", and used the term \\"stylish, yet flawless\\" to describe Anirudh's and Shakthisree Gopalan's rendition of \\"Yaanji\\". She felt \\"Pogatha Yennavittu\\" was \\"an impressive composition\\" and appreciated the \\"very peppy\\" beats in \\"Tasakku Tasakku\\", adding that it \\"can be reserved for parties\\". Sharanya concluded her review by stating that \\"the composer hits the high-note\\" with Vikram Vedha, writing further that \\"the film's narrative is sure to up the experience through music\\" with the instrumental tracks.

Kyranbek played with the Xinjiang Flying Tigers for 11 years and was an important part of their three consecutive Grand Finals from 2009 to 2011 and their first championship in the 2016‚Äì17 season. He is widely regarded as one of the most iconic player of the Xinjiang Flying Tigers, along with Shirelijan Muxtar and Xu Guochong. He was part of the Chinese squad for the 2019 FIBA Basketball World Cup.  Career  Kyranbek was promoted to the first team Xinjiang Flying Tigers and debuted in Chinese Basketball Association in the 2008‚Äì09 season. He was an important part of the team's three consecutive trips to the Grand Finals in the 2008-09, 2009‚Äì10, and 2010‚Äì11 seasons, serving as an elite perimeter defender for the team. Through the seasons, he also became an elite three point shooter. In the 2016‚Äì17 season, Shirelijan started 40 of the 50 regular season games he played, averaging 24.1 minutes, 8.1 points, and 2.6 rebounds per game. He played an important role in the first CBA championship for the Xinjiang Flying Tigers franchise. Notably, his stats were on par with the regular season MVP Ding Yanyuhang during their direct face-off in the small forward position in the Quater-Finals. After the 2019‚Äì20 season, Kyranbek was traded by Xinjiang Flying Tigers for 8 million CNY to Shanghai Sharks and signed a 3+1 regular (type-C) contract with the latter team, with the last year being a team option. His salary averages 7.5 million CNY (1.1 million USD) a year, the max value for non-max contracts. Name Kyranbek Makan is a Kyrgyz person born in Xinjiang, China. There are several alternative spellings to his name. Kyranbek is the direct transliteration of his first name from his naitve Kyrgyz language. Alternatively, some sources indirectly transliterated his name via Mandarin Chinese (ÂèØÂÖ∞ÁôΩÂÖã) as Kelanbaike. His patronym's direct translation from Kyrgyz is Makhan. The indirect transliteration via Mandarin (È©¨Âùé) is Makan. Therefore, alternative spellings of his full name include * Kyranbek Makhan, and * Kelanbaike Makan. Some sources might incorrectly mingle these two as Kyranbek Makan or Kelanbaike Makhan. Notebly, some sources rendered his first name as Korambek. This form is not an alternative spelling, but simply wrong since it has no traceable route of indirect transliteration. As a Kyrgyz name, Kyranbek Makhan uses the patronymic system and consists of the given (first) name Kyranbek and the patronym (father's name) Makhan. Therefore, Makhan is the name of Kyranbek's late father. In general, it is not acceptable to refer to him using only Makhan, even in a context which usually requires a surname (last name). One should always refer to him using the full name Kyranbek Makhan or simply his first name Kyranbek.

S. Ravikumar and Saranya Ponvannan among others portray supporting roles.  Development  Anirudh Ravichander composed the soundtrack album and background score for Remo in which he collaborates with Sivakarthikeyan for the fifth time. He joined as the film's composer in June 2015. The album consists of seven songs with one bonus track composed by Anirudh Ravichander and lyrics were written by Vignesh Shivan, Vivek, Ku. Karthik, Inno Genga and L. H. Harish Raam. The audio rights were acquired by Sony Music India. Before the album release, three singles were released from the movie, with lyrics written by Vignesh Shivan. The former two singles were rendered by Anirudh himself, while the latter was sung by Bollywood singer Arjun Kanungo, who made his debut in Tamil as singer alongside Srinidhi Venkatesh. Composer Santhosh Narayanan, also crooned one song for the film, in his first collaboration with Anirudh.  Marketing and release  The first single from the movie, titled \\"Remo Nee Kadhalan\\" was initially supposed to be released on 9 June 2016, but the song was released 23 June, at the film's first look and motion poster release event, which was telecasted live on the official YouTube channel of Sony Music South, and Anirudh gave a live stage performance of the song. The second single \\"Senjitaley\\" was launched on 1 July 2016, which performed by Anirudh Ravichander at the 5th South Indian International Movie Awards, held at the Suntec Convention and Exhibition Centre in Singapore, and was launched by actor Vikram. The third single \\"Sirrikadhey\\" was launched in a form of a promotional video song on 18 August 2016. The promo was directed by Prabhu Radhakrishnan, featuring the music composer Anirudh, singers Arjun Kanungo and Srinidhi Venkatesh and music technicians. Sivakarthikeyan and Keerthy Suresh make a cameo appearance, in the video. Another single, \\"Come Closer\\" was released on 26 August 2016, which was written and rendered by Inno Genga. The song was a reprised international version of \\"Sirikkadhey\\". The entire album was launched on 5 September 2016, by composer A. R. Rahman, and it was made available to download on the internet. Post-release, an additional song \\"Veshangalil Poiyillai\\" written by L. H. Harish Raam and composed and sang by Anirudh was released on 16 October 2016, coinciding with his birthday.  Reception  The album received mostly positive reviews from audiences and music listeners. Behindwoods rated the album 3.25/5 stating that \\"Remo's music is definitely a Cupid's arrow from Anirudh\\". Indiaglitz rated the album 3.5 out of 5, with a verdict \\"Some beats, a little melody, and a whole lot of fun, Remo is soulful jukebox. Another badge on young man's shoulder, Anirudh's Remo album shakes up the inner spirit and gets your heart lively and beating. Here we look forward to the movie even more cheerfully now!\\" Cinemaplus News gave a favourable review with a statement \\"Entertaining and engaging!\\" Top 10 Cinema rated that \\"Anirudh comes up with some energetic numbers, but in many places they sound so much stereotypical as his erstwhile numbers. Maybe for certain seasons, teen audiences would love his musical score, but he has to attempt trying with different genres\\". Moviecrow rated the album 3 out of 5, and stated \\"Anirudh delivers another fun filled album which is sure to satiate the fans and though devoid of standout experimental tracks, the feel of the album is vibrant enough to elevate the overall mood of the movie.\\" Studioflicks rated the album 3 out of 5, and stated \\"Remo songs completely belong to the usual style of Anirudh as he ritually comes up with the tunes to savour the teen groups. But it would be nicer if he can redirect towards different musical genres rather than playing the same tunes to his fans, which might get time worn after some time.\\"  Controversy  The song \\"Senjitaley\\" irked criticism for the glorification of stalking in the song. According to Sudhir Srinivasan, in an article on The Hindu, he stated about the lines from the song \\"Enakku nee easy-ah laam venaam[...]\\" which romanticises harassment. The News Minute summarised about this stating \\"The comments section on YouTube has discussions on the music and how good the song is but barely anything on how problematic it is.\\"  Track listing  The tracklist of the film was released in the form of an album preview on 1 September 2016, through the official YouTube channel of Sony Music India. The full soundtrack album was released directly through iTunes on 5 September 2016, without hosting any formal launch event. = Tamil = = Telugu = The Telugu version of the film's soundtrack was released on 1 November 2016, at an event held at Shilpakala Vedika in Hyderabad, with Samantha Akkineni, being the chief guest for the function. The event was telecasted live on YouTube, and also in Maa TV, TV9 Telugu and other channels. Unlike the original Tamil version, the Telugu album consists of six tracks, with \\"Daavuya\\" and the bonus song \\"Veshangalil Poiyillai\\" were not included in the Telugu version.  Background score  The original background score of the film was released on 21 October 2016, post- release of the film.

Gesnerus. 1980;37(1-2):145-6. He devoted much time and energy to societies devoted to the study of the history of medicine. He was a prime mover in the founding of the Faculty of the History of Medicine of the Society of Apothecaries in 1958. He was an active member of the Soci√©t√© Internationale d‚ÄôHistoire de la M√©decine, contributing to its reorganisation. He went on to become Secretary-General and then President of the International Academy of the History of Medicine. His links with American historians led to his appointment to the editorial board of the Journal of the History of Medicine and Allied Sciences. Poynter was a regular contributor to journals and author of a series of books, many of which dealt with medicine in Tudor and Stuart times. These included The Selected Writings of William Clowes (1544‚Äì1608), A Seventeenth Century Doctor and His Patients: John Symcott, William Harvey: Lectures on the Whole of Anatomy. In 1961 he published A Short History of Medicine, a brief account of the evolution of medicine aimed at a younger readership, while Medicine and Man (1971) addressed social aspects of the history of medicine.

Zipf GK. 1949 Human behavior and the principle of least effort. Cambridge, MA: Addison-Wesley This is a statistical regularity that can be found in natural languages and other natural systems and that claims to be a general rule. Brevity law was originally formulated by the linguist George Kingsley Zipf in 1945 as a negative correlation between the frequency of a word and its size. He analyzed a written corpus in American English and showed that the average lengths in terms of the average number of phonemes decreases as the frequency word increases. He completed this observation showing that, for a Latin corpus, there is a negative correlation between the number of syllables and the frequency of appearance of words. This observation says that the most frequent words in a language are the shortest, e.g. the most common words in English are: the, be (in different forms), to, of, and, a; all of them short words that contain only 1 to 3 letters. He claimed that this Law of Abbreviation is a universal structural property of language, hypothesizing that it arises as a result of individuals optimising form-meaning mappings under competing pressures to communicate accurately but also efficiently. Zipf GK. 1935 The Psychobiology of language, an introduction to dynamic philology. Boston, MA: Houghton‚ÄìMifflin Zipf GK. 1949 Human behavior and the principle of least effort. Cambridge, MA: Addison-Wesley Since then, the research on this linguistic law has continued and it has been empirically verified for almost a thousand languages of 80 different linguistic families when studying the relationship between the size of words measuring them in terms of number of characters in texts and their frequencies. Bentz C, Ferrer-i-Cancho R. 2016 Zipf‚Äôs Law of abbreviation as a language universal. Universit√§tsbibliothek T√ºbingen.

Proc. Natl Acad. Sci. USA 113, E2750-E2758 The origin of this statistical pattern seems to be related to optimization principles and derived by a mediation between two major constrains: the pressure to reduce the cost of production and the pressure to maximize transmission success. This idea is very related with the principle of least effort, which postulates that animals, people, even well-designed machines will naturally choose the path of least resistance or \\"effort\\". This principle of reducing the cost of production might also be related to principles of optimal compression of data in information theory.Kanwal J, Smith K, Culbertson J, Kirby S. 2017Zipf‚Äôs Law of abbreviation and the principle of least effort: language users optimise a miniature lexicon for efficient communication.

Personal life Everett was born on April 13, 1880 in Atlanta, Georgia. with His father, A.R. Everett of Boston, Massachusetts, founded first wholesale jewelry firm in Atlanta; his mother was Lena Goldsmith of Charleston, South Carolina. Everett married Susie Griffin of Valdosta on January 19, 1901. They resided at 1052 Dickson Place NE in Midtown Atlanta with their son, F. N. Everett. Career Everett was trained by G. L. Norman. During 1900-1902, he worked with builder Stephen Fagan Fulgham in Valdosta, Georgia, and he returned to Atlanta by 1903. Everett remained in Atlanta as a practicing architect until his death in February 1937, at the age of 56. There exist contradictions between sources about Everett possibly working together with Alexander Campbell Bruce in the firm of Bruce and Everett, about whether it was A.F.N. Everett or a different person, Arthur Greene Everett, of Boston, who worked with Bruce. This source asserts it was Arthur Green Everett. That firm for a time was known as Bruce, Everett, and Hayes, and Bruce was the senior partner. An Everett worked with Bruce by 1908. The partnership appears to have lasted through the design of three projects, built in 1906-1908. With The NRHP nomination document for the Converse-Dalton House states that \\"The only known work of that short-lived firm is the First Congregational Church on 105 Courtland Street, Atlanta.\\" But another source, the NRHP nomination document for the Kirkwood School (1906), states \\"Apart from the Kirkwood School, Bruce collaborated with Everett on only two Atlanta buildings, the St. Johns Methodist Episcopal Church (1907) and the First Congregational Church (1908).\\" Everett designed churches and apartment buildings in the Beaux-Arts style in the 1920s. For example, he designed Druid Hills Courts in 1922. Everett also designed private residences, like the Evans-Cucich House on Peachtree Battle Avenue in Atlanta's Buckhead neighborhood in the Art Deco style in 1934 for Hiram Wesley Evans. Converse-Dalton House Works of his (on his own or with others) include: *Converse-Dalton House (1902), 305 N. Patterson St., Valdosta, GA, NRHP-listed *Kirkwood School (1906), 138 Kirkwood Rd., Atlanta, GA (the portion of Atlanta in Dalton County) (Bruce, Everett and Hayes), NRHP-listed (which is also included in the Kirkwood Historic District ) *St. Nicholas Hotel, 141 Flint Ave., 300-310 Washington St., Albany, GA (Bruce & Everett), NRHP-listed *First Congregational Church (built 1910-12), Atlanta, designed with A.C. Bruce. A.F.N. Everett is noted in some sources as being architect of the First Congregational Church in Atlanta, along with A.C. Bruce, but the NRHP nomination document for the church asserts it was designed by a different Everett, namely Arthur Greene Everett, of Boston, along with A.C. Bruce. Arthur Greene Everett is an architect who lived from August 14, 1855 to October 5, 1925, who once worked with McKim, Mead and White in New York, and otherwise practiced most of his life in Boston. The church appears to have been built during 1910-12 but could have been designed earlier. *Druid Hills Courts (1922) *Evans-Cucich House (1934), Peachtree Battle Avenue, Atlanta, \\"one of the few Art Deco homes in Atlanta.\\"Gournay, Isabelle, text, photographs by Paul G.

A native of Townsend, Vermont, Twitchell taught school before joining the Union Army for the American Civil War. After service with the 4th Vermont Infantry, he joined 109th Colored Infantry and commanded a company as a captain. His command was part of the column that broke the Confederate lines at Petersburg, Virginia, and he was present at Appomattox for Lee's surrender. After service in Louisiana with the Freedmen's Bureau, Twitchell became active in Louisiana's post-war Reconstruction. He became a plantation owner and expanded his holdings to include stores, mills, hotels, and newspapers. He was elected to the state senate in 1869, where he played a key role in creating Red River Parish, over which he exercised political control because of his alliance with African American voters, who voted for anti-slavery Republicans over pro-Confederate Democrats. In 1876, an assassin armed with a rifle attempted to murder Twitchell as he traveled by boat to Coushatta, the Red River Parish seat. Twitchell was hit multiple times, and survived by pretending to be dead. Both his arms had to be amputated, and Twitchell wore artificial arms and hands for the rest of his life. The assassin targeted Twitchell as the result of efforts by Redeemer Democrats to end Louisiana's Reconstruction and prevent black voters from participating in the political process; Twitchell's death would have given Democrats control of the state senate, which would have recognized a Democratic House of Representatives and governor, ending Republican control of the state. After recovering from his wounds, Twitchell left Louisiana, which had been taken over by Democrats. In 1878, he was appointed U.S. Consul in Kingston, Ontario, Canada, where he served until his death. Twitchell died in Kingston on August 21, 1905 and was buried at Oakwood Cemetery in Townshend. Early years Twitchell was born in Townshend, Vermont on February 29, 1840, a son of Harvey Daniel Twitchell (died 1864) and the former Elizabeth Scott (died 1899). He was raised in Townsend and Montgomery, as well as Bedford, Quebec, and educated in the local schools and at Townshend's Leland Seminary. Twitchell taught school during the winters and worked on a farm and attended school during the remainder of the year. He graduated from Leland in 1860, and was the valedictorian of his class. He studied law briefly with Townshend attorney John Roberts before deciding to join the Union Army. Military service In 1861, at the outbreak of the American Civil War, Twitchell enlisted in Company I, 4th Vermont Infantry. After the regiment arrived in Washington, D.C. to perform guard duty and complete training in preparation for combat, Twitchell was assigned as his company clerk. He was promoted to corporal, sergeant, and first sergeant. He took part in the Siege of Yorktown in 1862, and was wounded three times at the Battle of Lee's Mill, but none seriously. He took part in additional fighting with the 4th Vermont, including the Battle of Savage's Station and the Seven Days Battles. In the winter of 1863, Twitchell received his commission as a first lieutenant in Company H, 109th Colored Infantry. He commanded his company as a captain and was at the Battle of the Wilderness in 1864. Left for dead as the result of a bullet which entered the corner of his left eye and emerged from behind his left ear, Twitchell surprised members of his unit when he got to his feet and began walking towards a hospital, after which an ambulance picked him up and transported him the rest of the way. Twitchell recovered, but was left with a scar that made him easily identifiable during his years in Louisiana, when he was targeted by multiple assassination attempts. In 1865, he was part of the column which broke through the Confederate defenses during the Siege of Petersburg and surrounded the remnants of the Army of Northern Virginia. He also took part in the Battle of Appomattox Court House, and was present at Lee's surrender to General Ulysses S. Grant. In May 1865, Twitchell was among several officers of the United States Colored Troops who were recommended for brevet promotions to recognize their valor and distinguished service. He was nominated for advancement to brevet major, but the United States Senate did not act on the recommendation, so it was never confirmed. Post-Civil War In the fall of 1865, Twitchell was named provost marshal and agent of the Freedmen's Bureau, a Reconstruction agency aimed at assisting the freedmen in the transition from slavery to freedom. Twitchell's initial headquarters were in Sparta, Bienville Parish. In 1866, Twitchell purchased a cotton plantation on Lake Bistineau at the junction of Bienville, Bossier, and Webster parishes. Twitchell married a Louisiana woman who refused to consider moving to Vermont, so he brought several of his northern relatives to Louisiana. In 1869, his father-in-law transferred to Twitchell the management of two plantations, which he operated successfully. In 1869, Twitchell purchased \\"Starlight\\", a plantation on the Red River. He helped found the town of Coushatta, and steadily added to his properties, including ownership of two stores, two mills, a hotel, and a newspaper. Louisiana politician When Louisiana's Reconstruction government began the work necessary to be readmitted to the Union, Twitchell was elected as a delegate to the state's 1868 constitutional convention. In 1869, he was elected to the first of two four-year terms in the state senate, having won critical African American support because of his championing of their causes and the individual friendships he had established with many freedmen in his district. He was the principal force behind the creation of Red River Parish and the establishment of Coushatta as the parish seat. When the parish police jury was elected in 1871, Twitchell was chosen as its president, making him the head of the parish government and the parish school superintendent. He appointed relatives and political supporters to key positions and was influential in improving the education of his black supporters by organizing segregated public schools in Bienville, Red River, and De Soto parishes. Among the tactics Twitchell used to protect the schools for black residents was threatening to withhold signatures on the warrants authorizing pay for teachers at all the parish schools. Twitchell's life was constantly in danger, and he was targeted several times by assassins. In 1874, Twitchell's only brother, Homer and two brothers-in-law, Clark Holland and Monroe Willis, were murdered in the Coushatta massacre. The massacre was an attempt by Democrats in Red River Parish to seize control of the local government by killing or disenfranchising Republicans, including the parish's African-American residents. Twitchell obtained federal authority to investigate, which led to the arrest of several prominent individuals, exacerbating tension between Twitchell and the pro-Confederate Democrats who were attempting to reclaim political power in Louisiana. =Assassination attempt= On May 2, 1876, an assassin armed with a rifle attempted to kill Twitchell while he was traveling by boat to Coushatta, the Red River Parish seat. He was wounded six times, which required the amputation of both arms above the elbow. His brother-in-law, George A. King, was killed in the attack. Twitchell would also have been killed, but when he pretended to be dead, the shooter stopped firing. Had the shooter succeeded, the partisan balance in the State Senate would have placed Redeemer Democrats in the majority. A Democratic senate would have ended Republican control of Louisiana by recognizing a Democratic Louisiana House of Representatives and governor, and electing a Democratic U.S. senator. Twitchell's property was abandoned or seized in court proceedings in the years after the attempted assassination. His neighbors had reportedly been jealous of his political and economic success during the downturn caused by the Panic of 1873 and were not upset to see him ruined. Two of his sisters died in Louisiana, with stress and heartbreak from the deaths of their relatives a contributing factor. Later years Twitchell wears artificial arms while posing during his service as U.S. Consul in Kingston, Ontario The surviving Twitchell family members stayed for a time in Indianapolis, Indiana, where Twitchell's surviving sister Helen T. Willis succumbed to illness and died. Twitchell and his mother returned to Vermont, the only survivors of the nine Twitchells who had moved to Louisiana. In April 1878, U.S. President Rutherford B. Hayes appointed Twitchell U.S. consul at Kingston in Ontario, Canada, a position that he held for the remainder of his life. He was retained through successive presidential administrations because the government of Canada requested that he be kept on, and at the time of his death he was the oldest U.S. consul on duty. In 1882, he declined President Chester A. Arthur's offer of appointment as Minister to Portugal, preferring the routine of his life in Kingston to ambassadorial rank. When it appeared in 1885 that the administration of President Grover Cleveland, a Democrat, would have Twitchell replaced by Twitchell's vice consul (also a Democrat), the vice consul wrote to U.S. Secretary of State Thomas F. Bayard to say he preferred that Twitchell retain the post. During the Spanish-American War, Twitchell was credited with intercepting three Spanish spies who attempted to enter the United States for the purpose of joining the U.S. Army as part of their clandestine mission, for which he was commended by the U.S. government. Twitchell was a member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, Grand Army of the Republic, Reunion Society of Vermont Officers, and Masons. He made frequent public and speech making appearances at events in Kingston including parades, in which he sometimes appeared in a Union Army captain's uniform. Death and burial On August 18, 1905, Twitchell was paralyzed by a stroke at his home in Kingston. He remained bedridden and did not regain consciousness, and died on August 21, 1905. Twitchell received a private funeral attended by family and friends in Kingston, followed by a public service with Masonic honors. After his remains were transported to Vermont, he received a funeral with Masonic honors at Townshend's Congregational church. He was interred at Oakwood Cemetery in Townshend, Vermont. Family In 1866, Twitchell married Adele Coleman (1846-1874), daughter of a Louisiana plantation owner. They were the parents of two sons, Marshall Coleman Twitchell (1871‚Äì1949), and Daniel, who died as an infant a few weeks after his mother. Adele Twitchell died of tuberculosis in 1874. In 1876, Twitchell married a childhood sweetheart, the former Henrietta Cushman Day (1843-1902) of Hampden, Massachusetts. They were the parents of a son, Emmus George Twitchell (1880-1961). Henrietta Twitchell died in Kingston and was buried at Oakwood Cemetery.

Similarly to most European cities (such as Vienna), the city walls were torn down, because the new technology and military techniques employed starting from the 19th century made them useless for defense purposes.  History  The gate, as it appears today, was built between the 16th and 17th centuries. The previous gate was quite different from today. Before it was rebuilt, on top of the gate there used to be a small church, the chiesetta di SS. Annunziata. The first evidence of the existence of this small church dates back to the 1490, and it was super portam de Bari (Latin, i.e. \\"on top of Porta Bari\\"); documents about visits to the church by archdiacons testify that the church had some issues, since it could be reached only through an uncomfortable ladder and it was located above one of the main gates of the city.pupillo-immagini, pag. 61 e nota 7 On top of the gate is a stone inscription, attributed to Saint Alphonsus Liguoripupillo- immagini, pag. 60 The inscription is a reference to the Eucharist. On top of the whole building, a monstrance is clearly visible. Originally, the monstrance was made of stone (more precisely, of Mazzaro stone, like the whole building). In 1939, for the first Diocesan eucharistic congress, the stone monstrance was removed and replaced with a steel monstrance. The gate is also known because, during the so-called Altamuran Revolution (1799), most Altamurans managed to flee from Fabrizio Ruffo and the Sanfedisti army through this gate, which wasn't then surveilled by guards.bolognese-zecher, p. 37 The gate, together with the above building, wasn't destroyed in the 19th century presumably because of its beauty or because it was inseparable from the nearby palace Palazzo De Angelis-Viti. The gate and the palace haven't been restored to their original whiteness yet (as done with Altamura Cathedral), although it is the first historical building that tourists see when they enter the city.

His son William Homes, Jr. was also a silversmith. Homes was born in the residence of his grandfather, Josiah Franklin, at the corner of Union and Hanover streets in Boston. His uncle, Benjamin Franklin, youngest son of Josiah Franklin, was then ten years old. He apprenticed circa 1729 with Rufus Greene in his shop on Newberry Street, and then circa 1737‚Äì1739 worked from him as a journeyman. Greene's records indicate that he paid Homes 82 pounds 16 shillings 9 pence for work done in the year 1738. In January 1739 \\"William Homes of Boston Goldsmith\\" ordered \\"sundries P. daybook\\" from silversmith Benjamin Greene, Rufus Greene's brother, for which he paid just over 4 pounds on May 9, 1740. Homes worked as a gold- and silversmith from 1739 to 1763 at his shop in Ann Street and later properties, and was known as the \\"honest goldsmith.\\" He married Rebecca Dawes (aunt of patriot Thomas Dawes), on April 24, 1740, with whom he had 15 children, many of whom died in infancy. In 1763 he turned over his shop to his son, devoting himself to selling general merchandise and buying and selling real estate. Homes joined the Artillery Company in 1747, and was promoted over time from First Sergeant in 1752 through Captain in 1765, and an active Son of Liberty. He also served as clerk of the market in 1753, warden in 1764, fireward from 1764 to 1770, and purchaser of grain from 1766 to 1769, surveyor of the highways from 1767 to 1769. He also apparently acted as an attorney at times. In October 1742 \\"William Homes, Goldsmith,\\" appeared in the Suffolk County Court of Common Pleas to recover a debt of 9 pounds for the mariner John Thomas, and on July 21, 1752, the Boston Gazette reported that \\"William Homes, goldsmith, was attorney for John Franklin, executor of the estate of Josiah Franklin.\\" The Gazette also mentions \\"Wiliam Holmes...Goldsmith, near the Draw-Bridge\\" on May 21, 1759. Homes left Boston in 1770, moving to one of his properties in Norton, Massachusetts. From 1773 to 1781 he was one of Norton's three selectmen as Captain William Homes, or William Homes, Esq., and was several years moderator of the annual town meetings. In 1775 Homes was the delegate from Norton and Mansfield to the second and third Massachusetts Provincial Congress, and was a member of the Bristol County Committee on correspondence and safety. He paid a fine instead of military service during the draft of 1776, probably because of his age. Homes died of dysentery while on a visit to Boston. He and his wife are buried in the Chapel burying ground on Tremont Street. His work is collected in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston and the Bennington Museum.

E. Trevelyan, was an English novelist. Early life G. E. Trevelyan was born on 17 October 1903 in Bath, Somerset, England. Her father, Edward Trevelyan, reported his occupation as \\"private means\\" on the 1911 Census, which also showed the family as employing four domestic servants. Her only brother, John Otto Trevelyan, died as an infant in 1908. She attended Princess Helena College, then located in Ealing, and was confirmed at St Peter's Church, Ealing in 1920. She attended Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford from 1923 to 1927, graduating with a second-class degree. Writing While at Lady Margaret Hall, Oxford, she won the Newdigate Prize for a 250-line poem in blank verse titled, \\"Julia, Daughter of Claudius.\\" The subject of the poem was referred to in John Addington Symonds' book, Renaissance in Italy. During excavations on the Appian Way in 1485, a perfectly preserved body of a girl around 15 was discovered. The body was removed to the Capitol, where it became the object of a cult that led the Pope to order the body to be removed and buried in secret. She told the Daily Mail, \\"I did it for a joke\\" and that she had written little poetry before the competition. The poem was published soon after by Basil Blackwell. After leaving Oxford, she moved to London, where she first lived in a women's residence hotel in Bermondsey. She later lived as a lodger in several locations in Kensington. Her first novel, Appius and Virginia, was published by Martin Secker in 1932. Taking its title from a play by John Webster, the book told of an experiment undertaken by an English spinster, Virginia Hutton, to raise an orangutan she names Appius as a human. She trains Appius to sit up, eat like a human, and spends years attempting to get him to speak, read, and write. Trevelyan takes the reader into minds of both Virginia and Appius, revealing the failure of both to understand the other in any meaningful way. In his review for The Spectator, L. A. G. Strong called it, \\"A work by a new author which is exciting both in promise and achievement. Miss Trevelyan has made brilliant debut.\\" Appius and Virginia was Trevelyan's only book to be published in the United States as well as England. Her second novel, Hot-House, published by Martin Secker in 1933. The book drew heavily on her experiences at Oxford, showing an undergraduate, Mina Cook, and her relationships while a student at the fictional \\"Queen Anne's College.\\" Reviewing the book in the Daily Mail, Compton Mackenzie wrote, \\"The whole thing is extremely well done, and by the time I had finished with it the atmosphere of damp heat had made me feel like an overfed gloxinia.\\" In 1934, Martin Secker published As It Was in the Beginning, which took place entirely in the mind of a woman laying in a care home in the last few days before her death. Trevelyan takes the reader back through the woman's life, in memories, to the moment of her birth. The Times Literary Supplement review called it, \\"a book which is almost unreadable in its intensity, but which compels one to go on reading in spite of almost physical discomfort, by the admiration one feels for the author's ingenuity and her uncanny insight into human beings.\\" Martin Secker published A War Without a Hero, her longest novel, in 1935. It was her last book with Martin Secker. Its reviews were mostly critical. In the Manchester Guardian, one reviewer wrote, \\"The use of a modern technique by which unspoken thoughts are shot on to the page in machine-gun sentences generally beginning with the verb does not suffice to make the mutual attraction of the young people credible.... Miss Trevelyan leaves one reader unconvinced.\\" Her next three novels were published by Victor Gollancz. Two Thousand Million Man-Power, published in 1937, showed the influence of John Dos Passos, as Trevelyan interwove headlines from newspaper stories, radio bulletins, and newsreels into the story of a London couple, Katherine and Robert, as they go through courtship and early marriage while dealing with financial worries, unemployment, and social standing. Reviewing the book for The Guardian, Wilfrid Gibson wrote, \\"The theme of the book is the grip of the modern machine which whirls us all in its soul-destroying revolutions.\\" Theme with Variations and William's Wife were both published in 1938. The first was Trevelyan's most experimental work, weaving the narratives of three very different Londoners, none of whom ever encounter the other and all of whom come to tragic ends. In her review for The Times Literary Supplement, Leonora Eyles wrote, \\"There is pity in this book and something of horror: it is as though the author had looked on human nature and turned away with a mixture of disgust and compassion from what she has seen. But, as always, Miss Trevelyan's genius and her sincerity make her book one that the reader cannot lay aside.\\" William's Wife followed a housemaid, Jane Atkins, from the day of her wedding to William Chirp, a greengrocer whose miserly control distorts her attitude and behavior and eventually lead her to live as a recluse gleaning her food from the waste of London markets. Writing in The Times Literary Supplement, Eyles proclaimed that, \\"Miss Trevelyan's scope of human experience makes her own of the most important novelists of our day, and there are signs in this last book that she is choosing from among more human and usual types for her characters than she has done before.\\" Her last novel, Trance by Appointment, was published by George G. Harrap and Co. in 1939. It told the story of a lower-class girl, Jean, who has visions, which lead her to working as a fortune teller and marriage to an astrologer who gradually corrupts her powers. Reviewing the book for The Listener, Edwin Muir wrote, \\"It is a sordid, pitiable little story, told with that cruel attention to detail which characterises Miss Trevelyan's art.... [I]t is very circumscribed; but every touch is genuine, and that itself gives the book distinction.\\" Trevelyan was injured in October 1940 when the flat she was living in was damaged during the Blitz. She died of her injuries at a care home in Bath in February 1941.

During his lifetime, he was well known in London antiquarian and literary circles for his talent for paleography and archiving. He was the member of many historical societies, and the founder of three more. He published numerous articles and books, during his lifetime, with more published posthumously. Black was lesser known, but equally regarded, for his prominence in London Seventh-Day Baptist circles, leading a small congregation in London, which never held more than twenty people. This circle was the subject of a newspaper article in 1869, where the reporter wrote of the contrast between the dilapidated building the services were held in, and their leader, Black, who appeared as \\"a profound scholar and most courteous gentleman\\". Early life and education William Henry Black was born on 7 May 1808, in Walworth, Surrey, to Mary and John Black of Kitmore. His mother's family, the Langleys, were the wealthy proprietors of estates in Oxfordshire and Buckinghamshire, and strongly influenced Black's religious and historical interests, as well as his future religious opinion. He was educated at a private school, and acted as the tutor of several families in Tulse Hill when he was seventeen. Antiquarian career The earliest record of Black's antiquarian interests exist in his catalogues of various libraries. He catalogued the Arundel Manuscripts, at the College of Arms in 1829 (before they were purchased by the British Library) and, as the Leathersellers' Company requested in 1831, Abraham Colfe's grammar school library. From 1831 to 1833, Black worked in Oxford, compiling a catalogue of Elias Ashmole's manuscripts, published in 1845, to much esteem. Early on in his career, he was also a contributor to the works of other antiquarians, including Sir Richard Hoare, 2nd Baronet's The History of Modern Wiltshire (11 vols; 1822‚Äì44) and Samuel Bentley's Excerpta Historica (1831). Upon the 1834 Burning of Parliament, Black boasted that he had been the earliest researcher to rush into the parliament buildings in hope of saving their valuable records. Thanks to the many literary contacts he had made while a reader at the British Museum, Black obtained a position at the Record Commission, a 19th-century royal commission into the state of the nation's archives. This position at the commission proved valuable to Black, as his antiquarian interests were occupied with the training of junior transcribers, and revision of Thomas Rymer's Foedera, a set of volumes detailing \\"all the leagues, treaties, alliances, capitulations, and confederacies, which have at any time been made between the Crown of England and any other kingdoms, princes and states\\". He also produced an original work in this time, Docquets of Letters Patent Passed Under Charles I, 1642-6, which was printed in 1837, but only published posthumously. In 1840, again thanks to his literary connections, and his reputation as a paleographer, Black acquired the position of assistant keeper at the Public Record Office, which had been established only two years earlier. His duties, here, included cataloguing the Pell Office records and preparing reports on the records of HM Treasury. This career lasted until 1853, as his vehement Sabbatarianism annoyed his employers, who required him to work on Saturdays, though his duties at the Treasury continued until 1854. Black was elected a Fellow of the Society of Antiquaries of London in 1858, and was appointed into the Society's council three times, in 1863, 1864, and 1867. He was one of the earliest members of the British Archaeological Association (est. 1843) the Camden Society, and several English local history societies, specifically: the Surrey, London and Middlesex, and Wiltshire Archaeological societies. He was also the founder of three antiquarian societies, all concerning Biblical archaeology: the Chronological Institute of London (est. 1850), the Palestine Archaeological Association, and the Anglo- Biblical Institute. By 1870, each of these had been voluntarily subsumed into the newly founded Society of Biblical Archaeology (which was, itself, later absorbed into the Royal Asiatic Society). According to Bernard Nurse of the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Black was \\"highly regarded by his contemporaries\\", and John Ashton, writing for the Dictionary of National Biography, has called him \\"a conscientious and painstaking antiquary\\". In his obituary, he was flatteringly described as being \\"richly stored with archaic learning and palaeographical knowledge, which he was always alike ready to impart to the youthful student and to give to the world at large.\\" Black was a prolific historical researcher. He issued several pamphlets on Biblical history, and the majority of issues of the Journal of the British Archaeological Association, from 1846 to 1872, contained articles by him. As a fellow of the society, several of his communications were published in the Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of London, between 1861 and 1871. His first communication to the Society concerned the will of Hans Holbein the Younger, and caused a significant stir, with his obituary in the Proceedings claiming it caused \\"a complete revolution in the history of Holbein's works\\". Black also edited three volumes of early modern English poetry, for publication by the Percy Society. Near the end of his life, Black prepared an edition of the Antonine Itinerary for the Rolls Series, which Ashton recorded \\"still await[ed] editing and publication\\" in 1886, and never ended up being published. Seventh-Day Baptism The Baptist Church of Mill Yard, Whitechapel, In 1840, Black became the afternoon preacher of a small Seventh- Day Baptist community in Mill Yard, on Leman Street, Whitechapel, following from J. B. Shepston. During this time there were only five members: himself, and the Slaters: Harriet (his third wife), Ann, Charlotte and Sophia. Here, he occupied the minister's house of 15 Mill Yard. While he served here, the congregation never grew over twenty people. At this congregation, Black was constantly involved in litigation relating to his religious matters. A member of the Liverpool Metropolitan Cathedral charged Black with crypto-Judaism, due to his emphasis in the Old Testament in his sermons, a charge which Black vigorously rebuked. In 1851, he was charged with libeling a fellow Baptist minister, and was forced to pay heavy damages. Black continued as the minister of this congregation until his death, in 1872. He was followed by his son-in- law, William Mead Jones. In 1885, this congregation moved from Mill Yard, as their premises were sold on to the LTS Railway Company. In 1869, Black's congregation was the subject of a newspaper article by C. M. Davies, where he found the building in disrepair, with a languishing fourteen-person congregation, in an \\"unlikely-looking, unsavoury place\\". Despite this, Davies records his meeting with Black as a pleasant surprise: Personal life and death William Henry Black was married three times. Black first married, at age twenty-two, to Elizabeth White. They had three daughters. In 1841, Black was remarried to Mary Anne (d. 1843), daughter of doctor Benjamin Noakes. Again, in 1844, Black was remarried to Harriot (d. 1861), daughter of William Slater, minister of Mill Yard. Theodora, Black's daughter, married William Mead Jones, who became his successor as pastor. While at his job in the Public Record Office, Black suffered a marked decline in health, and believed his vision was damaged after a sewage-related incident in the Treasury Chambers. Davies recorded that Black was a keen poet, \\"one of the irritabile genus vatum [irritable race of poets (Horace)]\\", having rebuked claims of crypto-Judaism using the medium. Black died in Mill Yard, on 12 April 1872, leaving behind less than ¬£1500 in his will.

Per historian Robert O. Collins, he was \\"a token southern minister and reliable sycophant in every government from 1954 to 1964\\". Early life Santino Deng Teng was born in 1922 at Makwan Kiir, belonging to the Dinka Paliet group in Aweil District. He was schooled at the Verona Father's Mission at Kwakjok Elementary School and St. Anthony's College in Bussere. He worked as an agriculturist and government officer in Lakes District, where he contributed to the formation of the Yirol Co-operative Society and was a member of the Yirol Council. He resigned from his government post in Lakes District to enter politics. Entry into politics He was elected to the House of Representatives in the 1953 Sudanese parliamentary election, standing as an independent candidate in the Aweil East constituency. Soon after the election he joined the National Unionist Party. He was named Minister of State without Portfolio in the Ismail al-Azhari government in January 1954, promoted by Al-Azhari to Minister of Stores and Equipment in January 1955 following the cabinet crisis of December 1954. Military rule Santino Deng Teng was re-elected to parliament in the 1958 Sudanese parliamentary election, after which he was named Minister of Animal Resources. He retained his post as Minister of Animal Resources in the cabinet of the Ibrahim Abboud military junta in November 1958. Santino Deng Teng was the sole Southerner to serve as Minister in the Abboud government. He remained in his ministerial post until 1964. North-South conflict At the time of the 1965 Round Table Conference between Northern and Southern leaders, Santino belonged to a minority group among the Southerners, the Other Shades of Opinion grouping (sponsored by Northern leaders) which favoured a decentralized Sudanese state rather than federalism. Soon thereafter became the founding president of the Sudan Unity Party. He set up a militia as self- defense against the Anyanya. He lost his parliamentary seat in the 1968 Sudanese parliamentary election, and largely withdrew from politics and public life after 1972.

For children 3 feet and below, tickets cost PHP 400 while children below 2 feet is free. Development history In early 2017, photos of the adventure park being developed then surfaced on different social media sites from people who were granted an exclusive tour and some of which falsely announced that it was going to open on April 2017. This prompted Lhuillier, the owner, to clarify in a press conference that it was untrue and they were aiming October or November 2017 as their projected opening date. The adventure park, which soft opened in February 2018, was conceptualized by Lhuillier after his visit to the San Diego Zoo in California after collecting several exotic animals and plants. It is part of the 2,000-hectare property owned by the family of Lhuillier who is the founder and chairman of the M. Lhuillier Group of Companies which owns Michel J.

It was released in 1976. Background La fedelt√† premiata was first performed in 1781. When it was revived in 1782, Haydn shortened and rearranged his opera and introduced extensive transpositions to accommodate recasting: Celia was changed from a mezzo-soprano to a soprano and Count Perrucchetto from a bass to a tenor, the Count gaining another aria in the process. The score used in Dor√°ti's album is the edition compiled by the Haydn scholar H. C. Robbins Landon, which is based on Haydn's original version. The album presents Haydn's music in its entirety, except for some minor cuts to recitativo secco marked as optional by Haydn himself. Stanley Sadie wrote that as far as he was aware, the album was the first complete recording of the opera ever made. When Dor√°ti first approached Decca and other companies to suggest recording Haydn's operas, they rejected his proposal as too risky. La fedelt√† premiata and the other works in Dor√°ti's Haydn cycle were only taped after Philips's producer, Erik Smith, had secured support from the European Broadcasting Union.Gramophone, September 1976, p. 403 Recording The album was recorded using analogue technology in June 1975 in the community theatre of √âpalinges, a village high in the hills above Lausanne, Switzerland.Haydn, Joesph: La fedelt√† premiata, cond. Antal Dor√°ti, Philips Classics CD, 432 430-2, 1993 Packaging The cover of the CD version of the album was designed under the art direction of Ton Friesen, and features photography by Hans Morren. Critical reception Joseph Haydn portrayed by John Hoppner in 1791, ten years after La fedelt·∫ö premiata's premi√®re The musicologist Stanley Sadie reviewed the album on LP in Gramophone in September 1976. After a long preamble sketching La fedelt√† premiata's storyline and acknowledging the opera's dramatic and musical limitations, he praised the album for its strong cast and committed performances. Lucia Valentini Terrani, he thought, provided \\"fine-drawn tone and firmly held line\\". Ileana Cotrubas was \\"delicious\\", her Act 1 aria \\"a joy, sweetly phrased, staccato and legato singing neatly contrasted\\". Frederica von Stade sang with power and a tight focus, \\"quite properly doing [her] mock-heroic music in genuinely heroic style\\". Alan Titus made up for his occasional hardness of tone with his skill in rapid articulation. Maurizio Mazzieri was \\"resonant and reasonably secure\\". Luigi Alva was \\"as warm and eloquent as ever\\". If there was a weak link among the cast, it was Tonny Landy - he was full-voiced and musically and dramatically intelligent, but he was also sometimes clumsy and did not always pay enough attention to his words. Dor√°ti conducted vivaciously, although he sometimes allowed his orchestra to get away with imprecision in ensembles. The audio was clear and judiciously balanced; the stereo soundstage was exploited to good effect. In sum, the album was \\"a set well worth having: warmly recommended\\". Alan Rich reviewed the album on LP in the New York Magazine on 20 June 1977. He devoted most of his critique to an attack on the opera itself. It had \\"little of the enterprise and sense of experimentation\\" of Haydn's contemporaneous symphonies. It exemplified the Esterhazy household's penchant for \\"stiff, formalized moral comedy of a rather old-fashioned sort\\". It featured \\"long stretches of pure eighteenth-century formula stuff\\". Rich conceded, though, that the opera did contain at least some interesting music and \\"some lithe, elegant, melodic writing\\", and he praised the singing of Ileana Cotrubas and Frederica von Stade as \\"sumptuous\\".New York Magazine, 20 June 1977, p. 65 Eszterh√°za. The palace's opera house was where La fedelt√† premiata was first performed in 1781 Lionel Salter reviewed the album on CD in Gramophone in June 1993. He agreed with Sadie that the opera's libretto was a poor one, but noted that \\"Haydn was unusually, and justifiably, proud of its music and of his delineation of character\\". Like H. C. Robbins Landon, Salter greatly admired the elaborate architecture of both the opera's finales. He also broadly shared Sadie's high opinion of the album's cast. Luigi Alva was \\"on top form\\", Ileana Cotrubas was \\"enchantingly frivolous\\" and Frederica von Stade was \\"pungent and brilliant\\". (It was von Stade who provided the album with its emotional climax, he thought, in \\"a beautiful and heartfelt lament\\" in Act 2.) The soloists' only peccadillos were an irritating beat in Lucia Valentini Terrani's voice and Tonny Landy's failure to invest his words with sufficient meaning. Reviewing the album together with its seven companions in Dor√°ti's box set of Haydn operas, he summed up the collection as providing a \\"very high standard of performance of music that is not only immensely demanding of the artists but extremely attractive to the listener\\".Gramophone, June 1993, pp. 99-100 The album was further discussed in The Penguin Guide to Opera on Compact Disc (1993),The Penguin Guide to Opera on Compact Disc, Penguin, 1993, p. 150 The Penguin Guide to Compact Discs and Cassettes (1994),The Penguin Guide to Compact Discs and Cassettes, Penguin, 1994, p. 530 David Wice's Illustrated History of Opera (1994) Wice, David: Illustrated History of Opera, Book Sales Incorporated, 1994, p. 183 and Clyde T.

Greenworld has, unlike Dixon's previous works on speculative evolution (After Man in 1981, The New Dinosaurs in 1988 and Man After Man in 1990), only been published in Japan, where it was released in two volumes. The book features a fictional alien planet and a diverse biosphere of alien organisms. The premise of Greenworld follows human colonisation of a planet of the same name over the course of a thousand years, chronicling mankind's disastrous impact on Greenworld's ecosystems, similar to how humans today are impacting Earth and its life. Greenworld and its creatures were designed by Dixon as a design exercise for his local science fiction group and the planet and its organisms first appeared in an 1992 episode of the Channel 4 series Equinox, followed by appearances in various other media, including the 1997 programme Natural History of an Alien. Greenworld's premise is similar to (and directly taken from) Dixon's original idea for the book Man After Man, which would have involved humans time-travelling 50 million years into the future to colonize the future ecosystem he had developed for After Man. The version of Man After Man that was eventually published, which Dixon was reluctant to be involved in, was considerably different from this idea, instead focused on future climate change through the eyes of future human descendants genetically engineered to adapt to it.  Summary  Greenworld is a hypothetical Earth- like exoplanet with a diverse and thriving biosphere. All animal-analogous organisms on Greenworld are descended from a radially symmetrical six-legged starfish-like animal. Animals on Greenworld secondarily developed bilateral symmetry (which is what is seen in most animals on Earth), developing into two major groups; ‚Äúsulcosyms‚Äù in which the plane of symmetry lies between the legs (meaning they have three pairs of limbs) and ‚Äúbrachiosyms‚Äù in which the plane of symmetry has led to the formation of one ‚Äúarm‚Äù at each of its ends (meaning two pairs of limbs and two unpaired limbs, one at the front and one at the back). In the book, humanity discovers Greenworld just as Earth finally collapses under the pressure of mankind's impact and a generation ship with ten thousand people is sent to colonize the planet. Greenworld then explores the first thousand years of human colonisation on the planet through following some key families of settlers. Over the course of this timespan, every ecological catastrophe caused by humans on Earth is repeated on Greenworld. The book is divided into several shorter chapters, each telling a short story and featuring illustrations of the local animals and their interactions and relations to humans. Illustrations also include ‚Äúexcerpts‚Äù of advertisements, science papers, field guides and recipes. By the end of the book, Greenworld and its ecosystems are in ruins, mankind having caused a mass extinction event through their actions on the planet.  Development  The fictional planet and biosphere featured in Greenworld was originally created as a design exercise by Dixon for his local science fiction group, basing it on the same biochemical processes behind the evolution of life on Earth. Before Dixon put the whole concept together as a cohesive book, parts of the project appeared in different media in which Dixon featured. In this capacity, Greenworld first appeared in the Channel 4 programme E.T, Please call Earth (part of the series Equinox) in 1992, followed by appearances in BBC's It'll Never Work?, The Radio Times and in BBC Focus in 1993 and it was one of many hypothetical alien worlds by different scientists featured on the BBC2/Discovery Channel programme Natural History of an Alien in 1997. Following the success of his previous speculative evolution books After Man (1981) and The New Dinosaurs (1988), Dixon worked on a new project dubbed Man After Man which was to involve mankind avoiding catastrophes such as overpopulation and mass starvation by inventing time travel and moving 50 million years in the future to re-establish civilization. As such Man After Man would have been set in the same world as After Man and would have focused on the man-made catastrophes destroying the ecosystem Dixon had established in the previous book. The final version of Man After Man, published as a book in 1990, was instead focused on future climate change through the eyes of future human descendants genetically engineered to adapt to it, a project Dixon was reluctant to be involved in. Dixon's original concept for Man After Man, the destruction of an established ecosystem by mankind, was instead eventually used for Greenworld, with Dixon applying it to the fictional alien world which he had created. Although Greenworld has so far only been published in Japan, Dixon has expressed interest in getting an English-language version published.

He was the owner of Serbia's first movie theatre, the Paris Cinema, located inside the eponymous Hotel Paris, at Belgrade's Terazije Square, which opened in December 1908. Unlike many of his contemporaries, Botoriƒá was convinced that film could be turned into a profitable endeavour. In 1909, he signed a contract with the French cinematographic firm Path√©, becoming their representative in Serbia and Bulgaria. In this capacity, he held exclusive Balkan premieres of Path√©'s films in his hotel. Botoriƒá also regularly produced newsreels about local events on Path√©'s behalf, with the firm providing filming equipment and a cameraman (Louis de Be√©ry), and Botoriƒá giving them a share of his admission profits. In 1911, Botoriƒá teamed up with the prominent stage actor Ilija Stanojeviƒá to establish the Union for the Production of Serbian Films (). In 1911, Botoriƒá produced The Life and Deeds of the Immortal Leader Karaƒëorƒëe, often referred to simply as Karaƒëorƒëe, Serbia's first feature film. The film was successful domestically, but failed to find a distributor abroad. The same fate befell Botoriƒá's other productions. After several further unsuccessful attempts at getting international distribution for his films, Botoriƒá left the film industry altogether. Commercial film production came to a virtual halt following the outbreak of World War I. During the Austro-Hungarian, German and Bulgarian invasion of Serbia in late 1915, Botoriƒá was taken prisoner, and died in an Austro-Hungarian internment camp the following year. Karaƒëorƒëe was considered lost for much of the 20th century, but was rediscovered in Vienna in July 2003.

Plot The musical and poetic composition ¬´O my prophetic soul¬ª on the verses of Fedor Ivanovich Tyutchev for the Reader, Pianist and String Orchestra of the composer Sergei Aleksandrovich Oskolkov served as a sound basis for the philosophical parable about the Love of the human and divine, about the cycle of life, about the decline of civilization, That the latter will be the first. The film is shot as a dream, and the use of the aesthetic series of experimental cinema only emphasizes this state. The universal sound gives him the poetry of Fyodor Tyutchev (1803‚Äì1873), deeply played by Leonid Mozgov behind the scenes. The young actors Natalya Surkova and Vladimir Zolotar, who existed in the frame, had a difficult task to show the first people not burdened with the intellectual work of subsequent generations.

Early career Peter Sheffield Briggs, the son of English parents and a native of Greenwich, Connecticut, first learned squash at The Field Club in his home town. He continued to pursue racquet sports at Middlesex School in Concord, Massachusetts where he also excelled in soccer. Briggs played #1 on the tennis team for 3 years and served as its captain in 1968 and 1969. He was considered one of the Private School Tennis League's best players. In his senior year he claimed a victory in the Class A competition over David Talbott from Deerfield (the brother of his future doubles partner Mark Talbott) in the 1969 New England Squash Tournament. He also led Middlesex to the team title in squash. As a freshman at Harvard University, he secured the top seed spot on the varsity squash team and was ranked #1 in the country. An intercollegiate champion, Briggs became Captain of the Crimson squash team and Harvard won the NCAA title that year. His squash coach at Harvard was Jack Barnaby, considered by many to be the most successful coach in Harvard history; Barnaby also coached Briggs in tennis. In January 1973, Briggs would win the singles final at the 31st Apawamis Club Invitational, nearly 15 years before he would become the head pro there. He finished his senior year, receiving a BA in Classics. Immediately after graduation, Briggs was hired to co-coach the Radcliffe tennis and squash teams with a fellow squash teammate, Dan Gordon. That same year, he also co-founded a sports apparel business named Boast with a group of fellow Ivy League athletes. A lefthander, Briggs won the Apawamis Invitational again in 1975. Adept at both squash singles and doubles, Briggs went on to win the US Squash Doubles Championship in 1976 with partner Ralph Howe. In the same year, he won the Mexican Nationals in singles, the Canadian Doubles and the U.S. Nationals in singles. Howe would be his partner for four years. At the same time that he competed on the courts, Briggs held a day job as a corporate trader at Kidder, Peabody & Co. eventually moving to Merrill Lynch. Squash won him over in 1984 and his career changed directions after almost 10 years in the financial arena. Coaching Briggs was hired as head squash coach and the assistant tennis coach at Cornell for 4 years starting in 1984. He guided his squash players to a 58-39 record. Under his leadership, the 1987-88 Cornell squash team became the first Cornell squash team to finish nationally in the top 10 (they ranked 9 at the end of their season). That same year his personal squash record expanded as he won no fewer than six professional events with four different partners and also won the US Mixed Doubles Championship with partner Joyce Davenport. His doubles partners included Mark Talbott with whom he was partnered in 1984 and 1985. To Cornell's disappointment, Briggs left in 1988 to begin coaching squash at The Apawamis Club downstate in Westchester. Under his more than three decade tenure, the squash program has regularly trained nationally ranked male and female students, many of whom have gone on to compete at or become captains of top Northeast collegiate teams including Harvard, Yale, Princeton University, Trinity College, Middlebury College and Amherst College.

It was built in the Sengoku period and is noted as the site of the death of Tokugawa Ieyasu's son Matsudaira Nobuyasu in 1579. In 2018, the site was recognized as a National Historic Site by the Japanese government together with adjacent . Futamata Castle Futamata Castle is located on a long and narrow hill at the confluence of the Tenry≈´ River with the smaller Futamata River. Surrounded its three directions by rivers, the site was a natural fortification, but was also located in a strategic location guarding the entry into southern Shinano Province. Futamata castle was originally built by the Imagawa clan in 1503 and was assigned to their vassals, the Matsui clan. In 1560, Imagawa Yoshimoto was defeated and killed at the Battle of Okehazama as was the castellan of Futamata, Matsui Munenobu (1515‚Äì1560). HIs son, Matsui Munetsune held the castle for Yoshimoto's son, Imagawa Ujizane, but the weakened clans were unable to withstand a combined attack from their former ally Takeda Shingen and Tokugawa Ieyasu in 1569. Ieyasu occupied both Hamamatsu Castle and Futamata Castle, and assigned Futamata to his ally, Udono Ujinaga. However, fearing that Udono was lukewarm towards the Takeda clan, Ieyasu soon replaced him with a fudai vassal, Nakane Masateru. In October 1572, Takeda Shingen launched a massive invasion and overran T≈çt≈çmi Province, capturing Futamata after a siege of one month. The Takeda forces defeated the Tokugawa clan at the Battle of Mikatagahara; however, due to the sudden death of Takeda Shigen in 1573, the invasion collapsed, and the Takeda armies retreated back to Kai Province. Over the next few years, his successor, Takeda Katsuyori contested Tokugawa Ieyasu for control of T≈çt≈çmi Province, but was defeated at the Battle of Nagashino by a coalition of Tokugawa Ieyasu and Oda Nobunaga. Futamata Castle remained under the control of the Takeda clan after the battle, and after a siege over six months, finally surrendered to the Tokugawa at the end of 1575. Futamata Castle was entrusted to Ieyasu's general ≈åkubo Tadayo. In 1579, Ieyasu's son and heir, Matsudaira Nobuyasu, was ordered to relocate to Futamata Castle from Hamamatsu, where after a couple of months he was ordered to commit seppuku, His mother (and Ieyasu's official wife), Lady Tsukiyama was executed as well. The official charges were that of conspiracy with the Takeda clan, but the precise reasons for this event are not entirely clear. Oda Nobunaga feared that the talented Matsudaira Nobuyasu posed a threat to his own son, Oda Nobutada, and Lady Tsukiyama was from the Imagawa clan and also had connection with the Takeda. Nobunaga's successor, Toyotomi Hideyoshi ordered that the Tokugawa relocate to the Kanto region in 1590, and gave both Futana and Hamamatsu's castles to his own general, Horio Yoshiharu. Yoshiharu reformed the castle with stone walls and a main keep, but was subsequently transferred to Izumo Province in 1600, at which time the castle was abandoned. In 1896, a shinto shrine dedicated to the war dead of the First Sino-Japanese War was constructed on the site of the northern kuruwa enclosure. It was subsequently rededicated also to the death of the Russo- Japanese War and the Pacific War. Tobayama Castle Tobayama Castle is located on the next hill from Futamata Castle, separated by the narrow Futamata River. It was originally built in 1572 by the Tokugawa forces laying siege to Futamata Castle, but was but later expanded and rebuilt by Horio Yoshiharu as a residential castle, as Futamata Castle had only limited space to build a large residence. The inner bailey of Tobayama Castle is a 100-meter-square space surrounded by stone walls with a masugata (composite gate) guarded by large stones. The two castles were operated as one by Horio Yoshiharu and Tobayama Castle was also abandoned in 1600.. Half broken stone walls remain at its inner bailey.

Along this trench the oceanic crust of the Sunda Plate beneath the Celebes Sea is being subducted beneath the Philippines Mobile Belt. It forms part of a linked set of trenches along the western side of the Philippines formed over east-dipping subduction zones, including the Manila Trench and the Negros Trench. At its northern end the rate of convergence across this boundary is about 100 mm per year. It is a relatively young structure, forming during the late Miocene to Pliocene. This age is consistent with the estimated age of the sedimentary rocks in the accretionary wedge associated with the trench and the age of adakitic arc rocks on Mindanao thought to date the onset of subduction. Seismicity Main tectonic structures around the Philippines The trench is associated with large megathrust earthquakes, including the 1918 Celebes Sea earthquake (M 8.3), the 1976 Moro Gulf earthquake (M 8.0) and the 2002 Mindanao earthquake (M 7.5). Tsunami hazard The Cotabato Trench is one of the main structure around the Philippines likely to be associated with tsunamigenic earthquakes. The tsunami generated by the 1976 earthquake caused about 4,000 deaths on Mindanao. Modelling of likely further tsunamis along the Cotabato Trench suggests that run-ups of several metres are likely for future earthquakes similar in size to the 1976 event.

Hutton was born in New York City to George and Anna Viele Hutton, and on July 20, 1766, was baptized into the Dutch Reformed Church. He moved to Albany in the 1780s, where he was probably apprenticed to silversmith John Folsom, with whom he partnered from 1787 to 1790 as FOLSOM & HUTTON. In 1791 he purchased property for his house and shop at 32 Market Street. In 1794 he engraved the Plan of the City of Albany, and in 1798 profiles of members of the House of Assembly. From February 1796 to 1817 he was in partnership with his brother, George Hutton, as I & G HUTTON, and on September 30, 1796, advertised in The Albany Gazette: \\"Three Silver Smiths, May have constant employ in a very shop, and prompt pay, by application immediately to I. & G. HUTTON, No 32, Market Street.\\" They created the seal for Union College, in Schenectady, New York, for which they were paid in November 1796. During the War of 1812, the Huttons sold silver and other items for military use, including silver accoutrements and fittings, gunpowder, regimental drums, and even pianofortes, and sheep wool. Hutton was an active citizen in Albany. In 1791 he was a member of a fire company, in 1793 was a founding member and Treasurer of Albany Mechanics Society, in 1811 served as a founding director of the Mechanics & Farmers Bank, and in 1813 was named President of the bank's board, in which he served until 1817. He was also a Director of the Albany Water Works and a founder of the Albany Female Academy. Hutton went bankrupt in 1817 due to speculation in a venture to manufacture cotton goods, and left Albany after a sheriff's sale in 1819. He was listed in census records in 1850 and 1855 as a resident of Stuyvesant, New York, and died in Stuyvesant Landing.

He excelled in primary school, completing a program intended to last two years. He studied at a boarding school for seven years after completing four grades at a local school. During a famine in 1933 he briefly dropped out of school to work as a cook, but after his teacher chided him for leaving he returned to school. He then went to a transportation school in Simferopol, and after that he worked on navy ships as an electrician.

In March 1940 Chalbash became a flight instructor at the school. World War II Due to the German invasion of the Soviet Union, the Kacha School of Pilots had to be relocated to Saratov oblast in 1941. At the start of the war Chalbash and several of his fellow flight instructors requested to be sent to the frontlines, where he was sent in December 1941. He flew in combat with the 627th Mixed Aviation Regiment until February 1943, using the I-16 and LaGG-33. He gained his first aerial victory on 31 January 1942, a hared shootdown of a Ju-88. His first solo shootdown took place over a year later on 6 May 1943, taking out an FW-190. The first award he received was the campaign medal for the defense of Moscow, but before the end of the year he received the Order of the Red Star; at the time of the award he was a deputy squadron commander in the 627th Regiment, but in February 1943 he was transferred to 49th Fighter Aviation Regiment. In that regiment he gained the majority of his aerial victories, but was recalled from the front in September to train pilots at the Lyubertsy Higher Aviation School in Moscow. By then he had become a squadron commander and was promoted to captain, and wounded twice in combat. While in Moscow he flew in May Day parades in 1944 and 1945. Aviation historian Mikhail Bykhov indicates his final tally of aerial victories consisted of 8 solo plus four shared shootdowns accumulated throughout 316 sorties; however, some sources indicate that he had as many as 11 solo and 6 shared victories. Postwar After the war Chalbash was given a choice of becoming a regimental commander in Germany or a deputy regimental commander in the Russian Far East. He chose to go to the Russian far east, where he rose to the rank of colonel and eventually commanded a fighter-interceptor regiment. He accumulated over 3000 flight hours, but he was forbidden from flying for medical reasons in 1959, so he retired from the military. After retiring he tried to return to his homeland Crimea many times; under Soviet law retired military personnel had the right to move back to the place where they enlisted and get a household registration, but this did not apply to Crimean Tatars, who had restricted movement under the special settlement regime and were rarely allowed to enter Crimea even after the abolition of the special settler status. While Chalbash was not a special settler, he was still not allowed to live in Crimea until the Crimean Tatars received the right of return. After moving to Crimea in 1992 he found it incredibly difficult to find housing, and did not get an apartment in his native Alushta until ten years later, but died shortly thereafter on 6 August 2005 and was buried in the ally of heroes.

(n.d.). Retrieved from https://www.bps.org.uk/member-microsites/division-occupational- psychology/awards-funding.  Early life  Furnham was born on 3 February 1953 of British parents. He grew up in his birthplace Port Shepstone, Union of South Africa, where he was exposed to many people of different national origins. He was the only child of his parents. His father was a newspaper printer and publisher, while his mother was a nurse. Growing up, Furnham came to discover traits of his that were not shared by his parents. He found himself to be ambitious, striving for academic and financial success at a young age. On the other hand, his parents had no such ambitions for themselves. He was opened to new and exotic experience, unlike his parents, who were not eager with exploring things outside of the Anglo-Saxon culture. His parents were satisfied with a shallow understanding of things, while Furnham would crave for a deep level of understanding. Education Adrian completed in total one undergraduate degree, three master's degrees and three doctorates. In 1970, at the age of sixteen, he began his university education at the University of Natal (Pietermaritzburg campus), completing a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1972, and an Honours Bachelor of Arts degree in 1973. His academic studies focused on history, psychology, and theology. He then went on to complete a Master of Arts in 1974, composing his thesis on \\"Cross-cultural conformity and field dependence\\". In 1975 he proceeded to complete an economics master's degree at the University of London, focusing his research, essays, and examinations on his thesis: \\"The relative contribution of verbal, vocal, and visual cues to person perception\\". Furthering his education, he completed a Master of Science at the University of Strathclyde, completing research on \\"Sex and class factors in the perception of social episodes\\". From there, in 1981 Furnham completed a doctorate at Oxford and later received a D.Sc. from London in 1991 and a D.Litt. from Natal in 1997.Permission for writing Wikipedia Page . (17 November 2019). Permission for writing Wikipedia Page .  Educators  Throughout his education, Furnham had many great educators who had a positive influence on his life, but two of them particularly notable. The first is Michael Argyle (11 August 1925 ‚Äì 6 September 2002), who was Furnham's PhD supervisor. Argyle wrote approximately 250 papers on a number of different topics including body language, religion, money, happiness, and work. At one point, he was the fourth most cited British Psychologist. According to Furnham, there are many things that are unique about Argyle. One thing that stood out to Furnham in particular is that Argyle advised his Doctorate students not too read too much about an idea initially as it would limit their creativity and thinking. A significant impact that he had on Furnham's career is that he taught him not to be afraid to explore new areas of research, and not limit himself to already existing fields. Furnham also learned from Argyle the characteristics of a good doctoral supervisor, to be cooperative with colleagues, and to work hard and play hard. The second is Hans Eysenck (/Ààa…™z…õ≈ãk/; 4 March 1916 ‚Äì 4 September 1997), who was Furnham's role model. Eysenck was the living psychologist most frequently cited in the peer-reviewed scientific journal literature in 1997. Furnham met Eysenck while doing his PhD. He was one of the first theorists to advocate a biologically based theory of personality. Furnham became an Eysenckian after reading his books and papers, and started using his psychometric tests during his PhD. In 2008, Furnham wrote a paper suggesting five reasons why Eysenck's tests have remained popular for a long time. He suggested that these reasons are: parsimony, explanation of process, experimentation, wide application, and continuous improvement and development.  Career  Adrian Furnham is currently a professor of psychology at University College London. Before his current placement, he had previously lectured at numerous institutes, including: Pembroke College, Oxford, University of New South Wales, and the University of West Indies. More so, he also taught management at both the Hong Kong University Business school as well as the Henley Management College. In 2009, he was assigned a position of adjunct professor of management at the Norwegian School of Management. Furnham has been recognized as a Chartered Occupational Psychologist. In addition to his professor roles at several universities, Furnham is an active member of many different associations. He is a Fellow of the British Psychological Society, as he was renown to be the second most productive psychologist in 1995. He is also currently the elected president of the International Society for the Study of Individual Differences, as well as the founder and director of Applied Behavioural Research Associates (ABRA); which is a consultancy in psychology. Furnham‚Äôs work was used at universities and other associations. He also proactively consulted for many international companies to assist them with top team development, create systems for performance management, psychometric testing and developing leadership skills. Following these experiences, he was elected Fellow of the Leadership Trust in 2010, Academician of the Learned Society of the Social Sciences in 2010, and British Psychological Society of Academic Contribution to Practice Award in 2011. He has written over 70 books, and many of them have been translated into different languages, including Chinese, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Polish, Russian, Portuguese, and Spanish.Corner, S. (n.d.). Adrian Furnham - Keynote Speakers. Retrieved from https://www.speakerscorner.co.uk/speaker/adrian-furnham. Alongside his books, Furnham has written newspaper pieces for Financial Times, Guardian, Telegraph, Daily Mail, Times Higher Educational Supplement, Sunday Times, and contributed to various magazines, including: The Spectator, Personnel Management, New Scientist, Across the Board, and Spotlight, in both Europe and North America. He has been a columnist in multiple management magazines such as Mastering Management and Human Resources. He is also a regular contributor to national and international radio and television channels such as BBC, CNN, and ITV.  Research  = His contributions = Furnham reports being uncertain as to what type of psychologist he is as he is interested in a multiple topics. He has been labelled an applied, differential, economic, health, occupational, and social psychologist at different times. However, he is a British Psychological Society chartered occupational and a chartered health psychologist. He believes that his personality and upbringing has resulted in his curiosity about a variety of issues within and outside the discipline, hence the diversity in his interdisciplinary work. = Themes =  Psychometric housekeeping and reviews  Furnham has an interest in documenting different scales that measure the same thing and comparing their quantities. He has done this through reviewing old and new personality tests. These are critical reviews which are comprehensive, extensively quoted, and are updated occasionally. Some examples of his extensive reviews are Tolerance of Ambiguity (co-authored by Ribchester and Marks), Belief in a Just World, and the Protestant Work Ethic.  Test development  Furnham has developed several tests throughout his career. He adapted already existing ideas to make specific tests like the Economic Locus of Control measure in 1986, and the Organisational Attributional Style Questionnaire in 1992. He developed the Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire, which is a self- report inventory that measures the sampling domain of trait emotional intelligence, along with his PhD student Dino Petrides in 2006.Trait Emotional Intelligence Questionnaire (TEIQue). (n.d.). Retrieved from http://www.eiconsortium.org/measures/teique.html. He also developed the High Flyer Trait Inventory (formerly High Flying Personality Inventory), with his colleague Ian Macrae in 2014. The High Flyer Trait Inventory is a measure of personality traits directly related to workplace behaviours, thoughts, and perceptions of oneself and others.  The relationship between tests of preference and power  To this day Furnham had been interested in the distant relationship between the two pillars differential psychology. Furnham had given his opinion on this topic to the International Society for the Study of Individual differences. He currently works on this topic with the help of his PhD students.  Self-appraisal and awareness  Beginning early on Furnham took a great interest in self-awareness and self-estimating intelligence, in which he published many studies on. The findings of his studies revealed that males tend to estimate their general intelligence 5-15 IQ points higher than females do, these sex differences occur across the generations and that sex differences are cross-culturally consistent.  Dark side  Furnham was introduced to the dark side personality by Robert Hogan. Dark side personalities are those that portray dysfunctional behaviours and beliefs towards others. For instance, Psychopaths would fall under this category. These types of people do not consider how their actions affect their reputation, and, although this may seem like deviant behaviour, it also seems to help them people climb up the corporate ladder. Dark side personality research was based on the DSM-III. Using the Hogan Development Survey in various studies, Furnham was able to collect sufficient amounts of data, which later on aided in studying misbehaviour at work. According to the HDS, mischievous people were considered to be extraverts, disagreeable, deliberate, and stable. They scored high on the excitement scale and low on the consciousness scale. Furnham has written multiple papers as well as two books on this topic.  Publications  = Books = As of 2019, he has written over 92 books and over 1200 scientific papers including:ADRIAN FURNHAM.

During his reign, the House of Celje became one of the most powerful noble houses in the territory of present-day Slovenia, and laid the basis for its expansion to neighboring Slavonia and Croatia in the next generation.Milko Kos.

He was the firstborn son of Frederick, first Count of Celje, and his wife Diemut Wallsee. Frederick had inherited the Celje Castle and the surrounding estates through his mother Catherine, daughter of the last Carinthian Count of Heunburg (Vovbre, in Slovene) and Agnes of Baden, the unsuccessful claimant to the Babenberg inheritance. The Counts of Celje owed their success to the allegiance to the Habsburgs. Like his father before him, Ulrich served as the Landeshauptmann (governor) of the Habsburg Duchy of Carniola from 1362. Ulrich served as a condottiere, a military contractor lending his services to more powerful lords. Through his services, he established particularly strong ties with the Luxembourg rulers of Bohemia and Germany, and the Hungarian branch of the Anjou dynasty. In 1354, he took part of the expedition of the Holy Emperor Charles IV to Italy. In 1354-55, he fought on the side of the Hungarian king Louis the Great against the Venetians in Dalmatia in 1354‚Äì55. Between 1359 and 1365, he took part of his expeditions to Serbia, Bulgaria and Southern Italy.ƒåepiƒç et al.: Zgodovina Slovencev. Ljubljana: Cankarjeva zalo≈æba, 1979. Pp. 216-17. The connection with the Hungarian and Polish king Louis proved fruitful. Ulrich's younger brother Hermann married Catherine of Bosnia, king Louis's sister in law, while Ulrich's son William married Anna of Poland, the daughter of Casimir the Great, the last Piast king of Poland. These marriages elevated the Counts of Celje into the circles of Central European royalty. At the same time, the settlement was convenient for Louis the Great who succeeded Casimir as King of Poland: Casimir's daughter, who might have otherwise claimed the throne for her children, was married off to Louis's loyal junior ally far away from Poland, thus neutralizing a potential challenge to his legitimacy in a problematic succession.Peter ≈†tih et al., eds, Spomini Helene Kottanner. Ljubljana, 1999 Marriage and issue Ulrich married Adelaide of Ortenburg, daughter of the powerful Carinthian count of Ortenburg. The marriage strengthened the alliance between the two houses. Only one son, William, survived into adulthood from this union. He married Anna of Poland, and had one daughter, Anna of Celje, who would become Polish queen consort by her marriage to Vladislav II.

Patterson, now United States Senator, first spoke to me about the matter and told me to see Worthington. I had a conversation with Worthington, and I said to him that I didn't see that Scott ought to be impeached, and yet there must be something in it, as the Committee who had been appointed to look into the matter reported that there were grounds for impeachment. Worthington said there was nothing in it, but that Bowen was urging it because he had a spite against scott, and that he would give me $500 if I would vote against it. The next day after the vote, H.G. Worthington paid me the $500 over Fine's, up stairs. No one else was present when Worthington handed me the money. C.D.

Dindar was originally elected in the 2017 French legislative election. Prior to her election, Dindar served as the first female elected president of the General Council of La Reunion, a position she held from 2004 to 2017. At the same time, she was leader of Droite sociale, a local political party, before joining the Union of Democrats and Independents.  Biography  Nassimah Mangrolia was born to a large family, the sixth of twelve.Annie Drouet, , T√©l√© Mag R√©union, 3 juin 2004. Her father, a Professor of the Quran, raised them in a strict religious household as members of Reunion's Zarabe community. After receiving her baccalaur√©at litt√©raire, she traveled to Mainland France to study at the universit√© de Provence Aix-Marseille I, where she received a master's degree. Upon receiving a teaching certificate, she returned to Reunion, where she taught French and History at a Lycee in Saint-Denis. In the late 1980s, Nassimah became active on issues of women's rights. She volunteered with the group Femmes actuelles de La Reunion, which she became president of in 1996. = Political career = Dindar was first elected to the Regional Council of La Reunion in 1998, on the party list of Margie Sudre. She became an assistant secretary within Rally for the Republic and, from 2002, third deputy mayor for Saint-Denis and the vice- president of the departmental council of Reunion, as the elected representative of Saint-Denis canton. As head of the Departmental Council for Reunion from 2004 to 2017, she was the first woman elected president of the council. Additionally, she was the first Muslim woman to be elected to a departmental council anywhere in France. Dindar was appointed as the Delegate General for diversity within the national office of the Union for a Popular Movement, where she engaged in outreach on behalf of the party in the Overseas department and regions. In 2005, she was named as Secretary of State for Integration in the government of Dominique de Villepin. She was awarded the Ordre national du M√©rite in 2006. During the 2007 French presidential election, Dindar, together with Val√©rie P√©cresse and B√©reng√®re Poletti issued a statement critical of Socialist Party candidate S√©gol√®ne Royal, noting her absence at meetings on preventing violence against women. Speaking to press in Reunion, she said \\"Violence does not have political colors\\" and said that meetings like these give hope to victims. Dindar stood as a candidate in the 2007 French legislative elections for R√©union's 1st constituency as a member of the \\"Presidential Majority\\" coalition. She faced the UMP candidate, deputy- mayor Ren√©-Paul Victoria. Eliminated in the first round with 5,381 votes,\\" R√©sultats des √©lections l√©gislatives 2007 La R√©union ‚Äì 1re circonscription \\", L'Express, she endorsed whichever UMP candidate was able to win a mandate. Despite this loss, Dindar was named a political advisor on diversity issues for President Nicolas Sarkozy, u-m-p.org, 12 ao√ªt 2007.. In February 2008, she was named by Jean-Louis Borloo, Minister of Ecology as one of the Overseas France representatives to the Grenelle de l'environnement. During the 2008 French cantonal elections, Dindar ran again as a candidate of the UMP, but was placed on the last place on the party list of the outgoing mayor. After coalition negotiations, right-wing representatives of the Departmental Council (led by Rene-Paul Victoria) named Jean-Louis Lagourgue as their choice for head of the Council. However, a quorum was unable to be organized in time to vote for Lagourgue as the only candidate, necessitating a candidate who could command majority support among council members. Dindar was able to use the support of the UMP, MoDem, Communist Party of R√©union and the Socialist Party to be re-elected as head of the Departmental Council. Re-elected in 2011 with two-thirds of the votes in her district, Dindar announced plans to run in the 2012 French legislative election for R√©union's 1st constituency in the National Assembly. She rejoined the Democratic Movement and supported their leader Fran√ßois Bayrou in the presidential election. Calling her candidacy \\"Centre for France\\", she beat her former opponent Ren√©-Paul Victoria by 264 votes to make it to the second round of voting. In the second round, she faced Socialist Party candidate, Ericka Bareigts, in the constituency's first election between two female candidates. Bareigts beat Dindar in the second round, 19,611 to 15,937. In the 2015 local elections, she was re-elected in the first round for Canton Saint-Denis.. Elle conserve la t√™te du conseil d√©partemental malgr√© le changement de majorit√©. She was elected as a Senator representing Reunion in the 2017 French Senate election.. Despite the law regarding dual mandates requiring officials to resign from departmental functions to accept a national position, Dindar filed an appeal with the Constitutional Council to try and extend her mandate as President of the Departmental Council. This appeal was rejected on 1 December,. 2017, and she resigned her position on 18 December.  Controversies  = Terre Rouge Affair = In June 2016, Dindar was sentenced to three years probation, a six months suspended sentence in prison and a fine of 30,000 Euro for a hiring discrimination case. She was released on appeal in March 2017. The case is still being tried in appeals. = Controversy around the Parisian Regional Office = On 6 December 2018, Nassimah Dindar was called to the local magistrate for a hearing on the management of the Paris office of the Regional Council of R√©union, which was criticized by the Regional Chamber of Accounts, an auditor of Regional finances. An investigation by Le Quotidien de La Reunion said the office was suspected of financial mismanagement, tax evasion, erratic management, and \\"hiring out of any regulatory framework\\". The judicial proceedings found that the regional office \\"seemed particularly questionable\\", according to the findings of the CRC. In 2012, the council invested over six- million Euro in a six-floor, 700m¬≤ building in the Marais. The fourth floor of the building included a private apartment used by Dindar and her associates, allegedly to avoid accommodation costs. = The Glaive Affair = In 2017, the CRC criticized the functioning of Glaive, an organization headed by Dindar and subsidized by the regional government.. A report by the Journal de l'√Æle de La R√©union affirmed that \\"Since its creation, the Glaive resembles a political machine meant to benefit the Premier and the Head of the General Council, Nassimah Dindar\\", mainly because the organization is based in Dindar's canton and has a hiring process that lacks transparency.. = SDIS Affair = In its reports of the Departmental Fire and Rescue Service, the Regional Chamber of Accounts denounced mismanagement within the local fire and rescue service on R√©union. The Chamber referred a case to the chief prosecutor Eric Truff√©ry, who opened a preliminary investigation in June 2018 around Embezzlement of public funds and undue influence issues.. The prosecutors investigation charged Nassimah Dindar for having hired employees out of compliance with labour law. She hired two members of the local fire and rescue service to work \\"in a private manner\\" as an assistant and a gardiner. On 27 December 2018, Nassimah Dindar served as a witness for a hearing at Caserne V√©rines on this issue.. = Bas-Rivi√®re Villa Affair = In October 2017, an investigative report by the Journal de l'√Æle de La R√©union found that questionable conditions around the sale and renovations of Dindar's house. Both the public prosecutor and the National Financial Prosecutor's office opened investigations following the report.. On 25 April, Dindar's home at 21 Rue de la Digue in the Bas de la Rivi√®re neighborhood in Saint-Denis was raided for three hours by investigators from the National Financial Prosecutor's office as part of their preliminary investigation. Their investigation found that Dindar had purchased her Case Creole house for about 130,000 Euro, far below its actual cost. Additionally, the PNF looked into construction and renovation work done at the house, and suspected that some contractors may have been paid by the Departmental Government or received government contracts or government jobs for friends and relatives..

The station's deep indebtedness, combined with a refusal of permission to build a mountaintop tower and move into the Albuquerque radio market, led the station to cease operations. History On October 2, 1979, the Grants Broadcasting Company was granted a construction permit to build a new radio station on 95.3 in Grants, with a transmitter southwest of the city. KYKN signed on April 16, 1980, with a country format. The Rainbow Broadcasting Corporation of Denver, owned by Michelle Z. Elliot, acquired KYKN in 1983 for $115,000. The new ownership changed the station's call letters to KLLT on October 31, though the country format remained. However, Rainbow ownership frequently changed hands. In 1984, Robert and Maxine Hedin acquired control of the company, and in 1986, Steven Humphries bought the entirety of Rainbow. By this time, KLLT, which had changed to contemporary hit radio earlier in the year, was deep in debt. Humphries agreed to buy the station for the assumption of its $175,000 in debt, and when he discovered another $125,000, he immediately filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization. Given the station's financial situation and limited facility covering Grants, the station sought a coverage and frequency upgrade as part of a program to move into Albuquerque. In February 1988, the Federal Communications Commission approved an application to move KLLT to 103.7 MHz and increase power to 50 kW. However, the United States Forest Service refused on two occasions to grant KLLT a land lease to construct the tower atop Mount Taylor that was necessary to carry out the improvements. With sales revenues continuing to decline, Humphries opted to take KLLT off the air on July 27, 1988. However, KLLT's license continued to exist after Humphries took the station silent, a fact that would prove crucial to the course of events in another proceeding. Just days later, on August 2, Humphries filed to buy Santa Fe's KNMQ. The sale application prompted a petition to deny from Fairmont Communications Corp., owners of KKOB and KKOB- FM, which alleged that Humphries had put KLLT in bankruptcy the same day he had filed to buy the Santa Fe station, and that Humphries could not own both FM stations due to impermissible signal overlap. Humphries contended that Fairmont was upset that KNMQ had lured top-rated morning show host Paul Sisneros from KKOB, and that the overlap between the two stations would only have occurred if KLLT had been moved to Mount Taylor. In late January 1989, the FCC dismissed the transfer application, primarily on the signal overlap issue; Humphries filed a petition for reconsideration, claiming that with the station in bankruptcy, it was now the property of the bankruptcy trustee, but the deal took so long to complete that the application was withdrawn altogether.

He was the co-ruler of the House of Celje together with his uncle Hermann I until 1485 and then with his cousin Hermann II until his death. William's only daughter, Anna of Celje, married the Polish King Vladislav II Jagello in order to strengthen his claim to the Polish throne. Life William was the only child of Ulrich I, Count of Celje and Adelaide of Ortenburg.Fugger Germadnik, Romanda et al. (2001): Razstava Grofje Celjski (Celje: Pokrajinski muzej Celje, 2001), p. 28. The date of his birth is unknown, but was probably in the early 1360s. After his father's death in 1368, William was raised by his uncle Hermann I of Celje. Hermann ruled in his nephew's name, and upon William's coming of age, they ruled jointly. After Hermann's death in 1385, William continued to rule with his cousin, Hermann's namesake son. This was in accordance with the family tradition which avoided splitting the estates by having male members of the family rule together. William also continued the family tradition of allegiance to the Habsburgs who had become the Celjes' liege lords in the early 1300s. It was, however, during his rule that the Counts of Celje strengthened their positions by developing family and political connections stretching far beyond their native region, thus rapidly emancipating themselves from the Habsburg tutelage. Together with his uncle Hermann I and his cousin Hermann II, William took part in the crusade against Samogitians in 1377, as part of the entourage of Duke Albert III of Austria. Like his father and grandfather before him, he served as Landeshauptmann (governor) of the Habsburg Duchy of Carniola between 1389 and 1390. In 1387, he was enfiefed with the castle and estate of Dravograd by the Habsburg duke Albert III, further expanding the Celje's possessions along the Drava River in southern Carinthia.Oro≈æen, Janko: Zgodovina Celja in okolice, Vol I. In: Celjski zbornik (Celje, 1971), p. 212. William fell ill during an expedition against the Ottomans. He died in Vienna, and was buried in the Minorite Church in Celje.https://www.dnevnik.si/1042546213  Marriage and children  In 1373, William was betrothed to Elizabeth of Gorizia, daughter of the imperial prince Meinhard, count of Gorizia and palatine count in Carinthia.Oro≈æen, Janko: Zgodovina Celja in okolice, Vol I. In: Celjski zbornik (Celje, 1971), p. 139. However, Elizabeth died young, and William eventually married the daughter of the late Polish king Casimir the Great. William's father Ulrich had been a mercenary military commander in the service of the Hungarian king Louis I. When Louis inherited the Polish crown, Casimir's daughter (and Louis's cousin) Anna was betrothed to William. The marriage took place on April 6, 1480. A daughter, Anna, was born in the marriage. She would eventually marry king Vladislav II of Poland. William died in 1392 without sons, and was succeeded by his cousin Hermann II, who became the sole ruler of the House of Celje. Family ties with the Polish monarchs  William's uncle and caretaker Hermann was the brother-in-law of the Hungarian king Louis of Anjou. In 1370, Louis succeeded his uncle Casimir the Great as King of Poland (Louis's mother Elizabeth was Casimir's sister). Casimir had died without sons, he did however have two daughters who survived into adulthood. One of them, Anna, was still alive at the time of her father's death. At the time of Louis's ascension to the Polish throne, Anna was only four, and thus in no position to threaten Louis's claim. In order to neutralize any possible future threat from her part (or by a husband or son of hers), Louis, who was now her caretaker, decided to betroth her to a loyal, faraway and relatively unimportant ally. The House of Celje could only benefit from marrying a princess of royal blood, but they were in no position to challenge Louis's kingship.Igor Grdina. Celjski knezi v Evropi (Celje, 1994), p. xii In 1380, at the age of fourteen, Anna was married to William. In 1383, Louis, too, died without a male heir. In Hungary, his older daughter Mary would be crowned as \\"king\\", while in Poland, his younger daughter Jadwiga became the queen regnant. In 1385, Jadwiga would marry the Lithuanian duke Jogaila who was crowned as Vladislav II of Poland. In 1399, queen Jadwiga died after giving birth to her only child who also died shortly after birth. Vladislav was thus left as the sole ruler of a foreign country, whose legitimacy was contested as he had attained kingship through marriage alone. In order to strengthen his position, Vladislav married William's daughter Anna, the only surviving granddaughter of the last Piast king Casimir the Great. William was thus both the son-in-law and the father-in-law of a Polish king; however, Casimir III died before his marriage to Anna of Poland, and her daughter's marriage to Vladislav II took place after his death.

She was for a time married to poet William Everson and was close friends with poet Robert Duncan, both associated with the Beat movement and the San Francisco Renaissance in nearby San Francisco. Fabilli's published work centered on her personal experiences, particularly those related to her Italian heritage and her Roman Catholic faith, and she did not consider herself to be a Beat poet. Personal history Fabilli was the daughter of farmers, Vicenzo and Giacinta (Pone) Fabilli, who had immigrated from Pacentro, Italy, to the coal-mining company town of Gardiner, New Mexico, before Fabilli's birth in 1914. The family moved several more times before buying a farm near Delano, California, where Fabilli grew up, eventually enrolling at the University of California, Berkeley. To help pay for college, she worked for the National Youth Administration (NYA) in Berkeley and then on art project for the Works Progress Administration (WPA) in Oakland. She graduated with a bachelor's degree in art and a minor in English in 1941. During World War II, Fabilli worked swing shift as a laborer in the Kaiser Shipyards in Richmond, California. When the war ended, Fabilli taught art to seventh-graders in Berkeley and to adults at the Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) in Oakland, and did clerical work for the East Bay Labor Journal before starting a career of almost 30 years teaching art and California history at the Oakland Museum. She became associate curator of the museum's history department before retiring in 1977. Fabilli married Everson on June 12, 1948, and, influenced by her religious devotion, he converted to Catholicism. In 1951 he joined the Dominican Order as a lay brother, and the marriage was annulled. Fabilli died in 2011 in Oakland. Work In addition to her books of poetry, prose, and illustrations, Fabilli illustrated Duncan's ‚ÄúHeavenly City, Earthly City‚Äù (1947), and created woodblocks for Everson's A Privacy of Speech (1949) and Triptych for the Living: Poems (1951). Everson posed for two of the saints in her collection Saints: Nine Linoleum Blocks (1960). Her book-length compilation of text and illustrations by artist Ray Boynton was completed for the Oakland Museum in 1976. Fabilli contributed poetry to anthologies and collections, including New Directions 8 (1944); Perspectives on William Everson (1992); Dark God of Eros: A William Everson Reader (2003), and Light Dark Wind Moon (2004), and to periodicals, including Occident, Circle Magazine, Talisman, Epitaph, Berkeley Miscellany, Ritual, and Experimental Review.

His nomination received widespread coverage in Yemen amidst the Yemeni Civil War (2015‚Äìpresent). Alzaki initially gained recognition for winning the 2006 Munshid Al Sharjah competition which specialized in Nasheed type of singing, hosted by the Sharjah Media Corporation and under the patronage of the Ruler of the Emirate of Sharjah. Life Alazaki was born in the village of Alzaki in Ar Rujum District of Al Mahwit Governorate in Yemen. He discovered his talent for singing during nasheed performances at his school which encouraged him to join the Sana'a Arab Cultural Capital contest as part of the Arab Capital of Culture initiative and won first place in the nasheed category. His family was initially against his singing and did not believe he had a good voice until his music teacher visited the family and convinced them to allow him to compete in the Sanaa competition. At the age of 18, Alazaki travelled at his own expense and alone to Sharjah to compete at the annual Munshid Sharjah competition, and his father noted that they had less than 24 hours before the deadline to register. Alazaki would go on to beat international competition and win the first-place position and a monetary reward of 100,000 Emirati dirham.

It is found in the southern Atlantic and Pacific Oceans and the waters around Antarctica. It is a filter feeder and opportunistic predator. Description This is a robust sea anemone with a disc diameter of . The pedal disc is well-developed and the column is short and smooth, divided into a scapus and a scapulus region. The sphincter muscle is strong and there are two siphonoglyphs. The tentacles are short and arranged in multiples of six, the outer ones being shorter than the inner. The colour is variable. Distribution and habitat Isotealia antarctica occurs in the southwestern Atlantic Ocean, the southeastern Pacific Ocean and the waters around Antarctica. This sea anemone usually lives on rocky substrates and its depth range is from . Ecology In the waters around Antarctica, Isotealia antarctica is the principal predator of the sea urchin Sterechinus neumayeri. This sea urchin habitually has fragments of red algae adhering to its spines, and often conceals itself among rooted or floating fronds of the red seaweed Phyllophora antarctica. If the sea urchin comes into contact with the tentacles of the sea anemone, it may be unable to tear itself free, however, if it is swathed in seaweed fragments or concealed among the seaweed fronds, the sea anemone's tentacles may adhere to the algal material, enabling the sea urchin to make good its escape. In Patagonia, it has been found living on the shells of gastropod molluscs, and this may be an important settlement site for the sea anemone in areas where the seabed is covered with soft sediment. Living and dead shells of Adelomelon ancilla were favoured, with six individuals of I. antarctica sharing one living A. ancilla shell in one instance, and in some instances, I. antarctica sharing a shell with another species of sea anemone, Antholoba achates. Isotealia antarctica is the most important predator of the common Antarctic nudibranch, Tritoniella belli. However, 70% of captured individuals manage to escape from the tentacles, or are regurgitated from the gastrovascular cavity of the sea anemone.

V√§rnlund had his biggest success as a playwright with his play Den heliga familjen (1932). Biography V√§rnlund grew up in the district of S√∂dermalm in Stockholm, Sweden. He found work as a typesetter and in his free time devoted himself to intense studies of literature and politics and began to write stories and articles. His writing was frequently published in the anarchist magazine Brand. V√§rnlund made several travels to Berlin in the 1920s, experiencing the postwar anxiety and atmosphere of the time. V√§rnlund had his first book, the short story collection D√∂da m√§nniskor (\\"Dead humans\\") published in 1924. By then he had already written numerous plays and works of prose. He was very productive and published several novels in the late 1920s and 1930s which generally received poor reviews. Contemporary critics had little understanding for his intense, expressionistic style. Although later V√§rnlund has been regarded as an important proletarian writer. He was the first writer to depict Stockholm from a proletarian perspective in novels such as Upproret (\\"The Upheaval\\", 1927), which along with the unusually lighthearted Det druckna kvarteret (\\"The drunken neighbourhood\\", 1928) and Man bygger ett hus (\\"A House is being built\\", 1938), is one of his best known novels. His play Den heliga familjen (The holy family) opened at the Royal Dramatic Theatre (Kungliga Dramatiska Teatern) in March 1932 under the direction of Alf Sj√∂berg.

It stands on the north side of the Afon Lledr, on the opposite side of the valley from Pont-y-Pant railway station.  History  The quarry reservoir in 2006 The quarry opened in the 1860s and was initially worked into the hillside on an outcrop of the Nod Glas Formation. As the quarry expanded, an open pit was dug down into the slate vein. In 1874, the quarry, which had been in local ownership was sold to a Mr. Blackwell, who spent a great deal to re-equip the quarry. In 1876, Blackwell contracted Issac Hughes of Rhyl to build a large reservoir in the hills above the quarry. The same year, he appointed David E. Davies as his manager. Davies went on to manage the nearby Ty'n-y-bryn quarry, and died in 1902. A mill was built to the south-east of the pit, likely in 1876 or 1877. The reservoir fed the waterwheel that powered the mill. A water turbine was installed at the mill before 1880, a notably early date for equipment of this sort in the Welsh slate industry. In 1887, a new company, the Rhiw-Goch Slate Company Limited was formed to take over the quarry. The company offered 600 shares at ¬£25 each to the public. The new company started extending the mill on the north-east side of the waterwheel, though it may never have been completed. The quarry closed in the 1890s. In 1904, the quarry re-opened and a new quarry, called Ty'n-y-fallen quarry was opened to the north-east of the mill, connected by a short tramway. This venture was unsuccessful and the quarry closed for the last time in 1908.  Geology  The quarry worked slate from the Nod Glas Formation which outcrops along the Lledr Valley. Through most of its length, the Nod Glas is black shale, but in the area around Dolwyddelan a syncline compressed the shales and it developed enough cleavage to be worked as slate.  Transport  The bridge across the Afon Lledr that connected the quarry to Pont-y-Pant railway station Within the quarry, tunnels led from the pit to the mill, with hand-worked tramways to carry the rock. A longer tramway was built to connect to Ty'n-y-fallen quarry in 1904. Construction started on a long incline from the mill down to the Dolwyddelan to Betws-y-Coed road around 1877, but it was never completed. The company had applied to Carnarvonshire Council to run a tramway from the foot of the incline across the road on a level crossing, but this was denied, and may have been why they abandoned the incline. Finished product from the mill was carted across the river to Pont-y- Pant railway station over a fine slate and timber bridge. At the station it was loaded onto LNWR trains bound for Conwy and beyond.

Likewise, she was the manager of a key decision that determined the minimum conditions of imprisonment for the mentally ill. She then joined the Prosecutor's Office during Gustavo de Greiff's administration, becoming the first female attorney delegated to the Supreme Court. She held the same position during the tenures of prosecutors Alfonso Valdivieso and Alfonso G√≥mez M√©ndez. This led to her being involved in delicate processes that aroused controversy at the time. In 2001 she resigned from his position in the Prosecutor's Office. That same year, she was appointed by the Attorney General Edgardo Maya Villaz√≥n as Delegate Attorney before the Supreme Court.

On 5 March, with the resignation of Deputy Attorney Alejandro Mart√≠nez, Morales appointed Zamora as Deputy Attorney General. That same day, the Supreme Court accepted the resignation of Morales, and Martha Luc√≠a Zamora took office as the acting Attorney General until the Court elected the new prosecutor. On 22 March 2012, the Supreme Court elected as Inspector General. He took office on 29 March, and Zamora became a new delegated prosecutor before the Supreme Court. On 31 May 2012, prosecutor Zamora took on the investigation of the young University of Los Andes students Laura Moreno and Jessy Quintero, involved in the Colmenares case, after Antonio Luis Gonz√°lez was removed by order of Attorney General Montealegre. On 2 October 2012, she also took on the investigation of student Carlos C√°rdenas for his alleged participation and knowledge in the events surrounding the strange death of Luis Andr√©s Colemares. On 22 April 2014, Attorney General Montealegre accepted Zamora's resignation as head of the delegated unit before the Court. After leaving the investigating body, she was appointed secretary general of Bogot√° by mayor Gustavo Petro. On 28 January 2016, she was elected magistrate of the Administrative Chamber of the Superior Council of Judicature.

In 1914 he attempted to organise a British expedition to the Antarctic, but this was prevented by the outbreak of the First World War. He died in the sinking of the Lusitania. Born to an English Quaker family in the north of England, Stackhouse worked as an official with a railway company, while indulging in a passion for foreign travel. A member of the Royal Geographical Society, he was a friend and associate of Robert Falcon Scott, and assisted in the preparation of Scott's Terra Nova Expedition, 1910‚Äì13. Stackhouse's aborted plan for an Antarctic expedition was originally conceived as a continuation of Scott's work. After its abandonment he revised and extended his scheme into a broad oceanographic survey, and went to America to gather support and funding for this purpose. He was lost in the Lusitania while returning to England. Life =Early life and career= Stackhouse was born on 10 August 1873, to a Quaker family in Kendal (then in the northern English county of Westmorland, now part of Cumbria). His parents were Thomas Petchell Stackhouse and Martha Stackhouse, n√©e Bowden. Robert Falcon Scott in 1909 After the family moved south to London, Stackhouse attended Sidcot, a Quaker boarding school at Winscombe in Somerset. On leaving school, he moved back to the north and embarked on a business career with the North Eastern Railway Company. He developed an abiding interest in foreign travel, became a Fellow of the Royal Geographical Society (RGS), and visited numerous countries: Egypt, Finland, Malta, Morocco, the United States, and many more. In 1900 he married Florence Hutchinson, whose uncle Sir Jonathan Hutchinson was a former president of the Royal College of Surgeons and surgeon to Queen Victoria. A daughter was born to the marriage in about 1903. At some stage in his early career, Stackhouse met and formed a close friendship with the British explorer Robert Falcon Scott. In 1909, Scott was embarking on a new quest for the South Pole, following Ernest Shackleton's near miss earlier that year. Stackhouse became an honorary secretary to Scott's Terra Nova expedition, and took charge of fund-raising in the north of England; he also committed a substantial portion of his private resources to the enterprise. Scott's records show that the pony \\"Snooker King\\", otherwise known as \\"Jehu\\", was donated to the expedition by \\"J. Foster Stackhouse and friend\\". Scott would have taken Stackhouse to the Antarctic, had the latter been available, a fact later confirmed by the expedition's second-in-command, E.R.G.R. \\"Teddy\\" Evans. =Jan Mayen, 1911= In 1911 Stackhouse organised and led a short expedition to the remote, uninhabited Arctic island of Jan Mayen. The island lies in the North Atlantic, between Iceland and the Svalbard (Spitzbergen) archipelago, at approximately 71¬∞N, 8¬∞W. The history of its early discovery is obscure; it was \\"rediscovered\\" several times in the early 17th century, and became a popular destination for whalers. The island provided a base for the Austro-Hungarian Arctic Expedition of 1882‚Äì83, and afterwards received regular short visits from explorers including, among others, Otto Nordenskj√∂ld in 1900, Jean-Baptiste Charcot in 1902 and after, and the Duchess of Bedford in 1911. Stackhouse's 1911 venture was organised in partnership with the Swedish explorer Axel Klinckowstr√∂m. Correspondence between the two indicates that the original plans had been to explore the island of Mevenklint, off the Greenland coast, but the destination was subsequently changed to Jan Mayen. The stated objectives of the expedition were to carry out meteorological observations between Iceland and Jan Mayen, and to survey the island's coastline as part of the preparation of an updated relief map. There may also have been a commercial motive; Stackhouse charged a fee of ¬£37 (about ¬£3,700 in 2018 terms ‚Äì RPI method) to non-scientist travellers, and might have been considering the possibilities for future tourism. The coast of Jan Mayen, photographed in 2007 The expedition, which sailed from Newcastle on 30 July 1911, was beset with problems from the beginning. The ship originally chartered, a wooden-hulled vessel designed for navigation in Arctic waters, was withdrawn by its owner on religious grounds; he demanded an assurance, not given, that every Sunday would be spent in port and that the crew would attend church services. The replacement was a smaller iron-hulled steam yacht, the Matador, which had a reduced capacity for coal and therefore a shorter range ‚Äì along with other shortcomings. The ship reached Iceland on 3 August, but severe weather in the following days confined its activities to a survey and exploration of the Icelandic coasts. When, finally, Matador reached Jan Mayen, the expedition was unable to land; the main work of the expedition, therefore, was the meteorological observations recorded between Iceland and the island. The Stackhouse‚ÄìKlinckowstr√∂m correspondence refers to numerous organisational problems, including the lack on departure of the requisite Bill of health, the absence of a chronometer, no heating or appropriate warm clothing on the vessel, and inadequate equipment. Notwithstanding, Stackhouse was prepared for another visit later in the year, but Klinckowstr√∂m demurred, stating that \\"no future expedition should mingle British and Continental elements, because of differences in method\\". Following the expedition, Stackhouse discussed his ideas for tourism with the Scottish Spitzbergen Syndicate, involving the possible erection of a hotel on the main island of the Spitzbergen archipelago. He proposed to \\"dump a prefabricated building and some builders on Spitzbergen\\" before going on to Jan Mayen. He later said that he had been promised an investment of ¬£5,000 for this venture (around ¬£500,000 in 2018), but these funds did not materialise and the scheme was abandoned. =Proposed British Antarctic Expedition, 1914= Discovery News reached England in January 1913 that Scott had attained the South Pole in January 1912, five weeks after the Norwegian expedition led by Roald Amundsen. Scott and four comrades had perished on their return journey from the Pole. In an interview with the Daily Mirror on 13 February 1913, Stackhouse praised Scott's heroism in staying with his ailing companions rather than seeking to save himself: \\"I am sure that if he had not felt bound to stand by that poor fellow Evans after he became helpless, he would be alive today\\". The tragedy did not, however, quell Stackhouse's enthusiasm for exploration, and in 1913 he revealed plans for his own Antarctic expedition. The main objective, he said, would be to explore the coastline between Graham Land and King Edward VII Land. He saw this venture as a solemn duty; Scott, he said, had urged him to undertake this task, which would form a continuation of Scott's own work. In the furtherance of his plans, Stackhouse bought Scott's old ship Discovery from the Hudson's Bay Company for ¬£9,500 ‚Äì a fraction of its original cost of ¬£51,000 ‚Äì and paid a deposit of ¬£1,000. Stackhouse announced that during the expedition Discovery was to be captained by Arthur Harbord, who had been second officer on the Nimrod in Shackleton's 1907‚Äì09 expedition. All officers and scientists would serve without pay. Stackhouse released several names who had volunteered for his expedition: Lieut. Richard Garsden of the Royal Indian Marine would be first officer; Lieut. R. Beatty, also from the RIM and a cousin of Admiral Beatty, would be navigating officer; Lord Congleton and the pioneer aviator William Forbes-Sempill (known as the Master of Sempill) would join the scientific staff. Stackhouse was hoping to obtain the services as boatswain of Tom Crean, who had served with Scott on both his Antarctic expeditions. Crean, however, had committed himself to Shackleton. The expedition received significant support from Sir Clements Markham, the still-influential RGS former president; according to Markham, \\"All who have at heart the continuance of the best traditions of British discovery will join in wishing all possible success to this enterprise\\". The RGS secretary, John Scott Keltie, was less impressed; he did not consider Stackhouse's plans to be viable, and withheld the Society's official endorsement. Stackhouse planned to leave Britain by 1 August 1914, but fell behind schedule; the New York Times on 18 April reported that departure had been delayed until \\"November or early next year\\", while the Adelaide Advertiser gave December 1914 as a probable starting date. However, the outbreak of the First World War in August 1914 forced Stackhouse to reconsider all his plans, and the expedition, along with several other concurrent Antarctic projects, was abruptly cancelled. Shackleton, whose plans for a transcontinental crossing were far advanced, got away on 3 August, on instructions from the British Admiralty, the day before Britain declared war on Germany. =International Oceanographic Expedition= Unable to proceed with his original plans, in August 1914 Stackhouse went to the United States, in search of new funding and support. In January 1915 he produced a prospectus for a revised scheme, which he now called the \\"International Oceanographic Expedition\\". This was vastly extended in range and scope from his original British proposals. What he now envisaged was a voyage of some 250,000 miles extending over seven years, which would chart the main oceans of the world: \\"Many thousands of islands, rocks and reefs now uncharted, or whose position is shown only approximately, will be definitely charted\\". This, Stackhouse said, would be of incalculable benefit not only to international trade, but would \\"decrease the tremendous toll of human life which the sea exacts annually\\". Among specific matters that he proposed to investigate was the circumstances of the sinking of RMS Titanic in the North Atlantic, in 1912. The expedition would carry out a full programme of scientific work, in the various fields of geology, biology, botany, and ethnology. The Antarctic coastal survey, the original \\"continuation of Scott's work\\", was now a secondary feature that would occupy the summer months. Stackhouse's ideas were received with some enthusiasm in the United States.. Science magazine stated: \\"Not since the Challenger has so great an enterprise been undertaken\\". Adept at self-promotion, Stackhouse adopted the style of \\"Commander\\", and despite his lack of scientific training, was hailed as \\"one of the world's leading oceanographers\\". The extent to which his plans received formal support from scientific bodies or government departments is uncertain, and his claims to such support may have been exaggerated for the benefit of potential donors. He asserted, optimistically, that his expedition would be under way in the summer of 1915. On 1 May, in New York, he boarded RMS Lusitania for a passage to Liverpool. On that day, New York newspapers published a warning from the German Embassy that the ship would be entering a war zone, and that \\"vessels flying the flag of Great Britain, or any of her allies, are liable to destruction in those waters\\". =Death and after= RMS Lusitania At around 2.10 pm on 7 May 1915, off the coast of Ireland, Lusitania was struck by a torpedo fired by a German U-20 submarine. In less than 20 minutes she sank; almost 1,200 passengers and crew were killed. There are several accounts of Stackhouse's activities in the moments immediately before and after the impact. According to a fellow-passenger, Harold Boulton, at the moment the torpedo struck he and Stackhouse were in the Verandah Caf√©, where Stackhouse was explaining why he thought Lusitania was safe from enemy attack. There were two loud, crashing sounds, after which water and debris came through the roof. A little later, Stackhouse was observed on deck, without a life-jacket; he had refused a place in a lifeboat, and had given his life-jacket to a little girl. He was last seen, as the ship went down, \\"standing calmly at her stern\\". Another eyewitness wrote: \\"His calm courage and confidence went a long way to stopping any panic, and in that way his assurance was of great value in saving lives. He died a splendid death\\". His body was eventually recovered from the sea; in his pockets was a scrap of paper on which he had written a quotation: \\"Let mercy be our boast, and shame our only fear\\". Among numerous tributes was that of Stackhouse's former associate Baron Klinckowstr√∂m, who wrote: \\"It was a fine death he died, the death of a true English gentleman worthy of both names. He was a man, and knew how to die as a man ought to die\\". Stackhouse was buried in a Quaker plot in County Cork. Plans for the International Oceanographic Expedition died with him; Discovery remained, unused, at her berth at London's West India Dock, the balance on her purchase price still outstanding. She was eventually reclaimed by the Hudson's Bay Company, who kept the deposit to cover the ongoing costs of maintaining the ship while waiting for Stackhouse.

He held the title of protospatharios and is often identified by this title in Arabic sources. Little is known for certain about his life, but he recounts in the Life of Christopher that he was a child in Antioch in the time of Patriarch Christopher and just before, meaning the late 950s and early 960s. He evidently found success in the imperial bureaucracy after the Byzantines conquered Antioch in 969, given his elevated title. The Life describes events in the time of Patriarch Nicholas II (1025‚Äì1030), so Ibrahim must have lived at least to the very late 1020s. The Life of Christopher is the only extant work authored by Ibrahim. It was originally composed in both Greek and Arabic, but only the Arabic version survives. On the other hand, it seems that the bulk of Ibrahim's scholarly work was devoted to Arabic translations of Greek theological texts. He is known to have translated homilies by Basil of Caesarea, Gregory of Nazianzus, Gregory of Nyssa, and John Chrysostom; a portion of the Divine Names of Pseudo-Dionysius the Areopagite; and panegyrics for the evangelists Luke and John from the Menologion of his contemporary Symeon the Metaphrast. He may also have been involved in administering imperial efforts to translate the Constantinopolitan liturgy into Syriac for use in the Greek Orthodox Church of Antioch, as indicated by a reference to \\"Abraham the king's scribe\\" in a 1056 Syriac Triodion manuscript in the British Library (BL Or. 8607).

Four of the six crew members died. The shootdown occurred exactly two months after the far better known U-2 shootdown involving Francis Gary Powers, and added to the tensions created by that incident. The plane was part of the 55th Strategic Reconnaissance Wing and took off from RAF Brize Norton airbase in the UK. It was shot down by Soviet pilot Vasily Polyakov in a MiG-19.

History  Following MDC‚ÄìT President Morgan Tsvangirai's death in February 2018, co- vice president of the party Nelson Chamisa became the party's President. Tsvangirai had instructed Chamisa to lead the party upon his death and to bring back Welshman Ncube, President of the splinter party MDC‚ÄìN, and Tendai Biti, President of the splinter party PDP, as part of the party's leadership. Chamisa agreed, despite being reluctant knowing that co-vice president and presidential contender Thokozani Khuphe would protest this outcome. Upon Chamisa's victory in the leadership contest, Khuphe announced in March that she was leaving the party and establishing a splinter party which would retain the MDC‚ÄìT name and logos, which resulted in a legal battle. In the July 2018 election, Chamisa, Ncube and Biti contested together as the MDC Alliance, while Khuphe contested as the much smaller MDC‚ÄìT (Khupe).

The film follows J√©r√¥me (Alain-Guy Giraudon), a Parisian man who has traveled to New York City in search of his lover Paul (Bob Bleecker). New York City Inferno is directed by Scandelari, who also wrote the film's screenplay based on a concept by Elliott Stein. The soundtrack is arranged by Jacques Morali, and features officially-licensed songs by the Village People. Plot In June 1977, Paul departs Paris for a week-long vacation to New York City, a trip taken in part to reflect on his strained relationship with his lover J√©r√¥me. He writes to J√©r√¥me daily, and in his last letter, states that he has decided to leave J√©r√¥me and stay in New York permanently. In December, J√©r√¥me travels to New York to search for Paul, and to determine why he has left Paris. In New York, a cab driver with whom J√©r√¥me subsequently has sex in a meat locker suggests that he visit Warehouse, a popular new BDSM gay bar in Greenwich Village. Over the course of his week-long visit, J√©r√¥me visits the locations mentioned by Paul in his letters, including the Meatpacking District, the Christopher Street Pier, a sex shop, and a tattoo parlor. At each location he cruises for sex and is introduced to the city's thriving gay scene; over the course of his trip he meets a French woman getting her first tattoo, an activist with the National Gay Task Force campaigning against Anita Bryant, and multiple paramours. J√©r√¥me visits an oracle mentioned by Paul at a market in Spanish Harlem, who performs a ritual with J√©r√¥me's semen. The oracle divines that Paul left Paris because he wished to be dominated, and that he will only return if J√©r√¥me becomes the master to Paul's new lover. He instructs J√©r√¥me to visit Warehouse that Friday; J√©r√¥me visits in leather garments, where he witnesses Paul collared and leashed to his new lover at the center of an orgy. J√©r√¥me and Paul make extended eye contact, and the film abruptly cuts to J√©r√¥me and Paul departing New York together as Paul's lover looks on. Cast * Alain-Guy Giraudon as J√©r√¥me * Bob Bleecker as Paul * John Houston as Rex * Bill Grove as Joe * David Charles as Tom * Luke Morelay as The Oracle * David Barrow as Keith * Camille O'Grady as Leather Club Performer * Dady La Flipp√©e as Tattooed Girl Rodger Gay, Keeson, Greg Christopher, Mark Lexington, Frank Bedford, Vic Sheridan, Steven Bank, Tommy Charles, and Victor Hudson are credited as additional actors. Production and release New York City Inferno was directed by Jacques Scandelari, with a screenplay by Scandelari based on a concept from Elliott Stein. The film's soundtrack was arranged by record producer Jacques Morali and features licensed music from the Village People, specifically \\"I Am What I Am\\" and \\"Macho Man\\". New York City Inferno is Scandelari's second gay pornographic film, following his 1977 film Homologues. It is one of six films funded by French gay pornography producer that were shot on location in New York City, and was filmed in and around the Meatpacking District and Greenwich Village. Principal photography on the film was completed in just four days. New York City Inferno was given an X rating by the Centre national du cin√©ma, which noted that the film's scenes contained \\"a certain element of cruelty.\\" The English language portions of the film were not subtitled in the film's initial French release, though a translation of the scene featuring J√©r√¥me and the National Gay Task Force activist was published in the French gay men's magazine Soft Men. Reception and legacy Critic has described New York City Inferno as an \\"unclassifiable work\\", comparing it to mondo cinema for its depictions of unsimulated sex, its pseudo-documentary filming style, and its unvarnished portrayal of New York City gay life prior to the 1980s HIV/AIDS epidemic. Lachaud offers specific praise for the film's \\"richness of tone and its almost experimental construction,\\" calling it a \\"radical work of art at a time when homosexuality in France was still considered a crime.\\" New York City Inferno has enjoyed contemporary success as a cult film. In 2014, it was chosen by director Jacques Audiard to be screened at .

The current Historicist main building was constructed after a fire in 1909. It is now operated as a hotel and conference centre. History S√∏rup was probably founded as a manor in the 13th century from land that had previously belonged to the small village of Si√∏thorp. The first known owner was Jacob Nielsen was the owner in 1381 and 1388. In 1398, it was sold by Peder Jensen Sparre to Torben Pedersen. The owner was in 1419 Karl Nielsen S√∏rup and in 1425 it was owned by Jacob Jep Jensen. His two sons, Jens and Per Ibsen Jepsen, inherited the estate after their father's death. In 1456, S√∏rup was acquired by Christoffer Jensen Basse. The estate then remained in the hands of the Basse family until the second half of the 17th century.. In 1584, Peder Basse married Sophie Nielsdatter Parsberg. He was from 1598 granted a number of fiefs in both Denmark and Norway. During the Kalmar War, in 1611‚Äì1613, he served in the cavalry with rank of ritmester. He was also active in the management of his estate. He obtained the Christian IV's permission to close down the rest of the village of S√∏rup and place the land directly under the manor. None of Basse's sons survived him. He passed away as the last male member of the Basse family in 1639. S√∏r√∏p was therefore passed to his daughters. Kj√∏n Jochum Grabow, whose wife Anne Steensen had inherited a stake of the estate from her mother, Margrethe Basse, had by 1642 acquired most of the stakes in the estate. Grabow had served in the Danish-Norwegian Navy during both the Torstenson War (1643‚Äì1645) and in the First and Dano-Swedish Wars, first as commander of a whole eskadre. Grabow's widow sold S√∏rup to Bolle Luxdorph in 1672. He also purchased the remaining shares in the estate from the other owners. Bolle Luxdorph was also the owner of a number of others estate. He had close ties to Peder Griffenfeld. His career in the central administration survived Griffenfeld's fall, In 1679, he was ennobled. In 1690, he fell out of facour at Christian V's court and was dismissed from all his offices. Luxdorph left S√∏rup and several other of his estates to his son-in- law, Adam Christopher Knuth. In 1714, Adam Christopher Knuth was able to merge his estate into a countship under the name Knuthenborg. Im 1743, Knith and his second wife, Ida Margrethe. established the Barony of Conradsborg for their youngest son, Conrad Ditlev Knuth. It consisted of the family's domains on Zealand: S√∏rup, Sandbygaard and Rosengaard. In 1797, Conrad Ditlev Knuth was granted royal permission to dissolve the barony and replace it by a family reust (Fideicommissum). S√∏rup was sold in public auction to Jens Dahl. Dahl improved the management of the estate. In 1813, Dahl sold S√∏rup to Heinrich Callisen. He managed to keep the estate in spite of the agricultural crisis that made many other landowners go bankrupt. In 1828, S√∏rup was acquired by Thor Muus. Muus' son, W.H. Muus, inherited S√∏rup after his father's death in 1881. He had already managed the estate since 1869. S√∏rup was in 1897 sold by W.H. Muus' widow ro count Frederik Brockenhuus-Schack. In 1918, he sold it to P. Madelung. Madelung sold it later that same year to Justus Ulrich. Today S√∏rup is today owned by S√∏rup Avlsg√•rd A/S.

Biography  Guglielmo Giannini was born in Pozzuoli, by Federico Giannini and Mary Jackson, and grew up in Naples. He practiced many different trades (from bricklayer to a clerk in a cloth shop) before coming to journalism, in modest satirical papers. Travelling around Europe, he became fond of the crime novel and began to write various scripts with this technique. Subsequently, introduced by his father, he pursued a journalistic career. He fought as a volunteer in the Italo-Turkish War (1911‚Äì1912) and participated in the First World War. At the end of the \\"Great War\\", he moved to Rome and returned to the profession of journalist. During this period he began to work also as a playwright. Contrary to Italy's entry into the Second World War (a choice dictated by the conviction that defeat was certain), he struggled for this position to continue working. In 1942, during the war conflict, his son Mario died in a plane crash in the Falconara Marittima airport. To this disgrace he dedicated the essay La folla, written after the news of his son's death, printed in 1945 and published in 1946. This tragedy contributed to rooting in him an indiscriminate hatred for the political class, and in particular for his leaders, without distinction of membership. In 1943 Giannini also directed four feature films in a year, including Grattacieli and 4 ragazze sognano, both with Paolo Stoppa as the protagonist. On 27 December 1944 Giannini founded a new weekly, \\"L'Uomo qualunque\\" (translatable as The Common Man or The Ordinary Man), which in May 1945 exceeded 800 thousand copies. Tired of the fascist dictatorship and the intrusion of politics in the lives of private citizens, but also of the return of traditional parties, Giannini, following the success of the weekly newspaper, founded an opinion movement called Common Man's Front. The movement, based on a new political pseudo-ideology, called \\"qualunquismo\\". Retrieved 5.3% of the votes in the parliamentary election of 1946, getting 30 deputies to the Constituent assembly, including Giannini himself, who became group leader in the Parliament. In 1947 Giannini, after having tried an alliance with the Christian Democracy and the Italian Social Movement, approached the communist leader Palmiro Togliatti, defined two years before as \\"worm, rogue and forger\\". Many sympathizers of the Common Man's Front, astounded by this choice, abandoned Giannini who so enounced the pact of friendship with the Italian Communist Party to make an alliance with the Italian Liberal Party. Anyway, in the parliamentary election of 1948 the FUQ- PLI alliance obtained only 3.8% of the vote; Giannini was elected to the Chamber and joined the Mixed Group. After the electoral failure, Giannini resigned as president of the Common Man's Frontin October 1948.GIANNINI RESIGNS ITALIAN PARTY POST; Common Man Front's Creator Had Aided Communists by Combating de Gasperi In 1953 Giannini was a candidate with the Christian Democracy and in 1958 with the People's Monarchist Party, but in both cases he was not elected.

She studies the health hazards of natural and industrial mineral dusts.  Early life and education  Horwell became interested in volcanoes as a child when she visited Mount Batur in Bali at the age of seven. Her undergraduate degree was in Environmental Science at the University of East Anglia, UK, where she studied environmental, earth and public health sciences. She moved to Victoria University of Wellington for her master's degree, and studied volcanology. Her research at Victoria University was based in Rotorua, an urban area where 60,000 people are exposed to geothermal emissions. Horwell designed devices to measure gas emissions around the town, collecting information on hydrogen sulphide exposures and providing advice to public health experts. She earned her doctorate at the University of Bristol, where she worked with Robert Stephen John Sparks supported by the Natural Environment Research Council. Her PhD research focused on the characteristics of crystalline silica in volcanic ash which control its toxicity. In 2003, Horwell founded the International Volcanic Health Hazard Network (IVHHN), which provides information on the health hazards and impacts of volcanic emissions to the general public and civil protection agencies. She has remained as the director of the IVHHN, and has since co-created the Hawaii Interagency Vog dashboard to provide information about volcanic smog to the general public. In 2005, Horwell joined the University of Cambridge as a NERC postdoctoral fellow. She moved to Durham University in 2007 as a Research Councils UK research fellow where she is now Professor.  Research and career  Horwell has served as an advisor to the World Health Organization, UK Cabinet Office and Public Health England. She was appointed to the Government of the United Kingdom Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies for volcanic eruptions in 2015. She is currently President-elect and founding leader of the American Geophysical Union's GeoHealth Section and serves on AGU's Council. alt= Horwell studies the health hazards of mineral dusts, and ways to support communities to protect themselves from inhaling particulate air pollution. She uses physicochemical analysis to establish whether or not mineral particles are harmful, as well as toxicological assessments to determine the respiratory hazards. These help her to understand the structure-toxicity relationships of minerals. She has studied how crystalline silica forms in volcanic systems such as lava domes using petrological techniques, including X-ray diffraction. Crystalline silica can be a pathogen, and can result in silicosis and lung cancer. Horwell is trying to establish whether the silica in volcanic ash has the potential to cause these diseases. Horwell worked with authorities in Hawaii to help local communities respond to the Kƒ´lauea vog (volcanic smog) emissions. The Interagency Vog Dashboard website was accessed over 50,000/week during the 2018 lower Puna eruption. She has worked with the Pan American Health Organization to introduce new epidemiological protocols for use in volcanic crises and supports many governmental agencies and non-governmental organizations in Indonesia, New Zealand, Singapore, Japan and Mexico in preparing for community exposures to volcanic emissions. She created the Health Interventions in Volcanic Eruptions (HIVE) project to collect evidence on respiratory protection for communities. She investigated the effectiveness of facemasks distributed by agencies during volcanic eruptions, looking to identify whether or not they could adequately filter fine-grained particles, as well as to understand the behavioural reasons why some communities may or may not wear masks, through collaborations with a range of social scientists. During this program Horwell co-developed train-the-trainer courses with the International Society for Respiratory Protection to teach people in Indonesia how to better protect themselves. Her research, with the Institute of Occupational Medicine, confirmed that N95 industry certified masks are most effective at protecting communities from inhaling volcanic ash, and that the more commonly used surgical masks offered less protection. = Awards and honours = Her awards and honours include; * 2020 European Geosciences Union Plinius medal for interdisciplinary natural hazards research * 2020 American Geophysical Union GeoHealth Section President and Founding Leader = Selected publications = Her publications include;   References  Category:Year of birth missing (living people) Category:Living people Category:Alumni of the University of East Anglia Category:Academics of Durham University Category:Women earth scientists Category:Volcanologists ","title":"Claire Horwell"},{"id":"61787158","title":"K-12 Tour"},{"id":"61787159","text":"I Am Not Alone is an Armenian-American documentary film, directed by Garin Hovannisian and released in 2019.Brian Welk, \\"‚ÄòI Am Not Alone‚Äô Trailer: Armenia‚Äôs ‚ÄòVelvet Revolution‚Äô Starts With a Step in New Documentary\\".

The idea has been advocated by some Israeli politicians since the Israeli occupation of the West Bank began in 1967, most notably with the Allon Plan and the 2020 Trump peace plan. The Jordan Valley According to B'Tselem, 65,000 Palestinians and about 11,000 Israeli settlers live in the area. According to PeaceNow, the proposal includes 30 settlements with 12,778 settlers, 18 illegal outposts, 15 Area A and B communities, including 44,175 Palestinians and 48 shepherding communities in Area C including 8,775 Palestinians. The area to be annexed is about 22% of the West Bank, 90% of which is in Area C and 20% of the land is Palestinian-owned. Proposals =Allon Plan= The Allon Plan was a plan to partition the West Bank between Israel and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, create a Druze state in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, and return most of the Sinai Peninsula to Arab control. The plan was drafted by Israeli Minister Yigal Allon shortly after the Six-Day War in June 1967. The broad aim of the plan was to annex most of the Jordan Valley from the river to the eastern slopes of the West Bank hill ridge, East Jerusalem, and the Etzion bloc, to Israel. The remaining parts of the West Bank, containing most of the Palestinian population, were to become Palestinian autonomous territory, or would return to Jordan, including a corridor to Jordan through Jericho. The Jordanian King Hussein rejected the plan. Allon died in 1980, and the following year the Israeli government passed the Golan Heights Law, effectively annexing most of the governorate.Avi Shlaim, 2001, The Iron Wall: \\"Victory in the Six-Day War marked the beginning of a new era in Israel's history ‚Äì an era of uncertainty. The victory reopened the old question about the territorial aims of Zionism...The question was what to do with these territories, and to this question there was no simple answer... On 26 July he [Allon] submitted to the cabinet a plan that was to bear his name [The Allon Plan]. It called for incorporating in Israel the following areas: a strip of land ten to fifteen kilometers wide along the Jordan River; most of the Judean desert along the Dead Sea; and a substantial area around Greater Jerusalem, including the Latrun salient. Designed to include as few Arabs as possible in the area claimed for Israel, the plan envisaged building permanent settlements and army bases in these areas. Finally, it called for opening negotiations with local leaders on turning the remaining parts of the West Bank into an autonomous region that would be economically linked to Israel. The cabinet discussed Allon's plan but neither adopted nor rejected it.\\"Kenneth W. Stein, 1999, Heroic Diplomacy: Sadat, Kissinger, Carter, Begin and the Quest for Arab-Israeli Peace: \\"Submitted to several Israeli Cabinets for approval but not officially endorsed, the Allon Plan was initially presented in July 1967. The plan‚Äôs core assumptions included defensible borders as defined by Israel, a return of the densely populated areas to a 'Jordanian-Palestinian state' with Israel retaining control of the Jordan Rift Valley and mountain ridges to the west from Nablus to Hebron. Under the plan, Israel would assert and sustain military presence over the West Bank up to the Jordan River, the West Bank would be demilitarized, the Palestinians would be provided self- administration in an autonomous or semiautonomous region, and Israel would remain in full control over a united Jerusalem, with perhaps a Jordanian status in the Muslim quarter of the Old City. Israeli leaders then ruled out the possibility of incorporating the West Bank Palestinian population into a greater Israel because it would have dramatically changed the states Jewish demographic orientation. When the Allon Plan was officially offered to the king [of Jordan] in cordial and secret talks in September 1968, Hussein rejected it because he felt it 'infringed on Jordanian sovereignty.' Nonetheless, the Allon Plan served as a basis for the Labor Party election platforms in 1974, 1977, 1981, 1984, and 1987. The concept of providing autonomy or self-administration for the Palestinians was offered by Israeli Prime Minister Begin to Sadat in December 1977 and enshrined in both the September 1978 Camp David and the September 1993 Oslo Accords.\\" Yehudit Auerbach, 1991, Journal of Conflict Resolution, \\"Attitudes to an Existence Conflict: Allon and Peres on the Palestinian Issue, 1967‚Äì1987\\": \\"The [Allon] plan called for a political settlement of the conflict between Israel and the Arab states, based on the following themes: Israel would not return to the June 4, 1967 borders; the Jordan River would be Israel's defense border; Jerusalem, the capital of Israel, would remain united; and a solution to the Palestinian problem would be found as part of a peace agreement with Jordan. This plan was never officially adopted by Israel's government, although it has never been rejected either. Moreover, it shaped, to a great extent, Israel's settlement policy in the West Bank and Gaza during the years from 1967 to 1977.\\" =Netanyahu Plan= On 10 September 2019 (a week before the September 2019 Israeli legislative election), Netanyahu announced his government's plan to annex the Jordan Valley, if it won the election. The map that Netanyahu displayed of the area to be annexed had several errors, incorrectly noting the location of several settlements and omitting Palestinian villages. Netanyahu said that he had received a green light from the United States' Donald Trump administration. The administration said that there had been no change in United States policy. The next day, there was international condemnation of the proposal from Palestinians, the Arab league, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Turkey, the UK and the UN, the latter stating \\"..that any Israeli move to impose its administration over the Palestinian territory would be illegal under international law.\\" Several Israeli politicians from across the political spectrum and Hebrew media outlets described this announcement as a political stunt for votes. Most notably, Moshe Ya'alon, a Knesset Member from the Blue and White party, said that in 2014 Netanyahu agreed in principle to evacuate Jordan Valley settlements. In 2014 Ya'alon was in Netanyahu's Likud Party, serving under Netanyahu as the Minister of Defense. In 13 August 2020, Prime Minister Netanyahu agreed to suspend the plan after signing Israel‚ÄìUnited Arab Emirates peace agreement, brokered by the United States.

The partisans in this brigade adhered to various (and often conflicting) ideologies, including both secularism and Catholicism and socialism and liberalism.. The Osoppo aimed to cooperate independently with the communist Garibaldi Brigades and to contribute to the antifascist fight against the occupying German forces. The latter had in fact established the Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral, subtracting the whole territory of Friuli- Venezia Giulia from the authority of the Italian Social Republic and establishing an harsh regime of repression and dispossession, availing of the Waffen-SS formations, cossacks and fascist republican forces.. This autonomous partisan group was led by Candido Grassi (battle name \\"Verdi\\"), Manlio Cencig (battle name \\"Mario\\"), two captains of the Royal Italian Army and Don Ascanio De Luca (already chaplain of Alpini in Montenegro and parson of Colugna, Tavagnacco, at the time). Because of the complex political-military situation of the Friulian territory and Julian March, at the middle of opposite nationalisms and secular ethnic and territorial conflicts, the Osoppo Brigades had often conflictual relationships with Garibaldi formations and they were in contrast with Slovenian-Yugoslav partisan forces. The name \\"Osoppo\\" was a symbolic reference with the history of the region during the Italian unification, when in 1848 the city of Osoppo resisted for seven months against the Austrian troops.  Eastern regions after the 8 September  = Dissolution of the Italian state = After the 8 September, the Italian divisions of the 2¬™ Armata, already involved in an harsh repression and anti- guerrilla struggle in Slovenia against the Yugoslav partisan units and the indigenous population,, with details about the policy of repression, internment and devastation executed by Italian political-military authorities in Slovenia between 1941 and 1943. broke up. In Trieste and Gorizia, general Alberto Ferrero left the command without any order.. In Fiume general Gastone Gambara (commander of the 11¬∫ Corpo d'armata) waited until 11 September, when he was reached by the first German divisions who were quickly occupying Istria and he gave them the command.. The same happened in Pula. The dissolution of many divisions and the lack of orders led to the deliver of more than 100,000 Italian soldiers deployed in the area to the Germans without any chance to draft a resistance plan.. The German occupation did not extended immediately to the whole region and, after the dissolution of the Italian administration, the Yugoslav formations, already located and active in the lands on the border since 1941,. took initiative.. The situation was particularly confused: beside the Italian disbanded troops left alone without orders and the coming German divisions, the 9th Corps of the 4th Yugoslav Army penetrated in the area shortly after the 8 September with more than 50,000 soldiers who crossed the Julian Alps and advanced through Karst Plateau and Istria, pointing towards Gorizia, Trieste, Pula and Fiume.. Moreover, since the second half of 1941, in the provinces of Gorizia, Pula, Fiume and Trieste there was already an increasing partisan activity of guerrilla-warfare and sabotage by Slovenian resistance groups.. The Yugoslav formations, kindled by a strong nationalism and by a spirit of vengeance after the occupation and the harsh repression and the Italianization on the eastern border and in Yugoslavia, did violent retaliations against the Italian minority and those considered as nationalists or fascists. The merciless attitude of Italian troops and commands during the two years of occupation in Slovenia, Croatia and Montenegro, characterized by harsh repressive measures and a high number of killings, devastations and deportations, provoked a violent Slav nationalist reaction at the arrival of the partisans in the Italian territory. It reports that, according to Yugoslav sources, deads provoked by the Italian occupation were about 500,000. Yugoslav formations, often supported by the local Slav population, began to arrest many Italian citizens on the charge of being fascists, but actually there was no distinction among the Italians. who were generally considered as \\"enemies of the people\\".. Arrests were concentrated in Pisino and, after a brief trial, prisoners were shot and threw into the Karst carves.. This event, known as Foibe massacres, occurred in September 1943 and led to the death of more than a thousand of Italians, before the conclusion of a precarious agreement of antifascist collaboration between Italian Garibaldi Brigades and Yugoslav partisans.. = Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral and repression = According to the Operation Achse as wanted by Hitler and German commanders, the province of Udine and the whole Venezia Giulia were immediately included into the Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral, with the original name used during the domination of the Habsburg Monarchy and the clear cancellation of what Italy obtained after the World War I. Those regions were put under the leadership of Carinthian Friedrich Rainer, appointed as High Commissar with full powers, in anticipation of the formal annexation of the region into the Third Reich., second part: L'Adriatische Kustenland. In his diaries, Joseph Goebbels talks about annexation project not only for the Adriatic Littoral but even also for the whole Veneto, in order to exploit it as a \\"tourist attraction area\\" for the German \\"master race\\". On 10 September 1943, provinces of Bolzano, Belluno and Trento were unified into the \\"Voralpenland\\" while the territory comprising Udine, Gorizia, Trieste, Pola, Fiume and Ljubljiana was officially established as Adriatisches Kustenland in October, after the completion of the territorial occupation by the German armed forces between 9 September and 12 October. On 2 October 1943, German troops went to the offensive and launched the Operation Wolkenbruch (\\"Cloudburst\\") with three SS divisions and two infantry divisions that repelled the 9th Corps and destroyed the houses used by Yugoslavs as support bases; the operation ended with the German victory on 15 October 1943. On 1 October 1943, Germans established the Operational Zone of the Adriatic Littoral, (OZAL) administrated by Supreme Commissar Friedrich Rainer to whom was flanked for the repression by SSGruppenf√ºhrer Odilo Globoƒçnik, previously the coordinator of German extermination camps in Poland. On 9 October 1943, the Julian provinces (Gorizia, Trieste, Pola, Fiume), as well as Friuli, were merged into the OZAL and subordinated to the German military administration, subtracting them from the Italian Social Republic (RSI). The policy of German authorities in the Adriatisches Kustenland, ruled by Rainer with dictatorial powers, included the ouster of the political-administrative influence of the RSI, the planning and actuation of measures for a subsequent annexation to the Reich, the economic exploitation, the repression of dissent and anti-fascist partisan struggle. In Carnia, German authorities established even the Cossacks of Don and Kuban led by general Krasnov and prince Zulikize, who created commands in Verzegnis and Paluzza and organized wide plunders and devastations, collaborating into the massive repression of partisans. Political authorities and military divisions of RSI participated to the repression and the fight against the Resistance formations: divisions of X MAS initially manifested unrealistic anti-Slavic defence purposes on the borderlands but then they ended (completely ousted by Rainer, who did not tolerate any fascist \\"interference\\" in the territories he administered) to dedicate themselves in the repression of Garibaldi and Osoppo Brigades,. while some members of the republican police, like Gaetano Collotti and Giuseppe Gueli, organized in Trieste violent and aggressive police apparatus against partisans and their supporters.. The Ispettorato Generale di Pubblica Sicurezza (General Inspectorate of Public Security) was formed in Trieste in May 1942 and used its repressions techniques against the Slovenian partisan resistance eeven before the 8 September 1943.  Resistance forces and creation of Osoppo Brigades  = Born of the Resistance in Friuli and Julian March = In this tough and intricate situation, characterized by inter-ethnic hatreds, spirit of vengeance, opposite nationalisms and ideological extremes, repressions, internments and roundups, the first partisan formations were formed near Udine against the Nazi Germany and collaborationist RSI, with the autonomists of Mario Cencigh, communists of Giacinto Calligaris and Mario Lizzero, militants of the Action Party led by Fermo Solari. In Venezia Giulia there were the Brigata Proletaria (\\"Proletarian Brigade\\", destroyed in Gorizia by Germans) and other communist formations were created in Tarnova, Trieste and Istria.. The two main groups of Resistance in those regions were the communists, from the working class of Eastern Veneto, and the rural populations and bourgeois, firmly anchored to the Catholic Church, both united by the anti-German hate but divided by ideologies, while the socialist and Action formations were particularly weak. On November‚ÄìDecember 1943, the Osoppo Brigades were formed with the merger between the socialist and Action formations with the catholic ones. = Organization = The purpose of Osoppo Birgades, in which converged also the Giustizia e Libert√† formations located in the region, was to fight against Germans and fascists for a democratic state within the Resistance, trying to keep an active collaboration with the Garibaldi communist units and protecting moreover the interests of the Italian population of Friuli and Venezia Giulia facing Yugoslav partisan forces. The Cappello Alpino and a green handkerchief were chosen as recognition signs. The Brigade was named after the small town of Osoppo which resisted to an Austrian siege lasted 168 days in 1848. The group decided to be autonomous on the operative field, as requested by the non-communist members during the NLC session of 25 November 1943. The Osoppo accepted instead the political direction of NLC of Udine, refused by the Garibaldi Brigades.  1944 and the Republic of Carnia  In the spring of 1944, the Brigata Osoppo, with the command headquartered in the Castello Ceconi of Pielungo (comune of Vito d'Asio), was formed by seven battalions led by Candido Grassi with Don Ascanio De Luca as political commissar. Battalions were dislocated as follows: * Two in Carnia (\\"Carnia\\", \\"Tagliamento\\") * Two in Carnic Prealps (\\"Italia D.D.\\", \\"Piave\\") * Three in Julian Prealps (\\"Julio\\", \\"Torre\\", \\"Udine\\") On 19 July 1944, the headquarter of Pielungo was put on fire by Germans and a situation of instability occurred in the command after divergences between militants of Giustizia e Libert√† and the other Osoppo members. On 21 August 1944, the Osoppo Brigade was reformed into five brigades between Carnia, Carnic and Julian Prealps and the plain. = Garibaldi-Osoppo Unified Commands = The Osoppo Brigades were coordinate, for a brief period of 1944, by the Unified Divisional Military Commands to the Garibaldi Brigades (Comandi Militari unificati di Divisione alle Brigate Garibaldine), despite having still the organizational autonomy. At the end of July, a coordination command was formed between the Osoppo of Sinistra Tagliamento and the Natisone Garibaldi Brigade. In Destra Tagliamento, instead, the Osoppo Garibaldi was formed at the end of August from the \\"Ippolito Nievo\\" unified divisions of plain and mountain while the 2¬™ divisione Osoppo Territoriale was created in September. The Unified Command was solicited also by the Allies, who did not want any political issues as hinder to the fight against nazis; despite difficulties caused by ideological differences, the Unified Command was efficient in the brief experience of the Free Republic of Carnia (August‚ÄìSeptember 1944). = Republic of Carnia = Despite contrasts, the Unified Command was established, with the bond of unanimity decisions, in a free zone of Sinistra Tagliamento and Collio, formed by Garibaldi Mario Fantini \\"Sasso\\" (Commander) and Giovanni Padoan \\"Vanni\\" (Political commissar) of Garibaldi Brigades, together with Francesco De Gregori (Deputy commander) and Alfredo Berzanti (Deputy commissar) of Osoppo. From August to September 1944 the Osoppo Division took part with the Friuli Garibaldi Division to the liberation of Carnia and the establishment of a \\"partisan republic\\"; after conflicts and little battles, partisan (almost 3,500 men) occupied a zone of 2,500 km2 with 78,900 inhabitants and 37 comuni. The council of the Free Republic of Carnia was established on 26 September in Ampezzo and tried to develop projects regarding administration, economy, justice and education. In the defence field, contrasts between Osoppo and Garibaldi Brigades of Carnia and Friuli did not allow instead the formation of a unified command.. The following repression conducted by over 40,000 men, between Germans, Social Republicans, X MAS, ethnic formations and cossacks, dismantled the Carnia Republic and caused heavy losses to defenders and civil population; nazi- fascist forces devastated the territory, made roundups and deportations; a formation of Osoppo was decimated along with the Garibaldi Brigades, but on 27 November, a chosen Osoppo group was still able to repeal an attack of German mountain troops. After new clashes in a harsh and inhospitable territory, the Osoppo Commander Candido Grassi (\\"Verdi\\") ordered the conversion of his troops into plain formations who succeeded to pass through the enemy side and take refuge into the plain..  1945 and contrasts between Osoppo and Garibaldi partisans  The Gruppo Brigata Osoppo dell'Est (Group of East Osoppo Brigade), a unified command with the Divisione Garibaldi Natisone, did not accept to pass east of the Isonzo river and to be subordinated to the Slovenian 9th Corps of the National Liberation Army of Yugoslavia led by Josip Broz Tito. On 22 November 1944, the Italian Communist Party (and not the CLNAI, the only command allowed to give orders legitimately regarding the operative deployment of partisan forces) ordered to the Italian partisans located in the zone to pass under the dependence of the Yugoslav 9th Corps in order to create (according to Palmiro Togliatti in a letter to Vincenzo Bianco, PCI representative in the 9th Corps): The disposition provided that \\"all the Italian units of the zone [the Friulian Adriatic Littoral] must operate only under the command of the 9th Army Corps of Tito\\", adding that whoever refused this order would be considered as fascist and imperialist; the command of Osoppo Brigades repealed the requested saying pai nostris fogol√¢rs in Friulan (\\"For our homes\\"). Message of the Udine prefecture about the negotiation between SS and Osoppo. Over 3,500 communist partisans of Garibaldi-Natisone division accepted but not the autonomous of Ossopo, including Elda Turchetti, a militant killed and reputed by communists as an X MAS spy. If the Osoppo members were based on principles of defence of national interests, which should have been discussed only after the end of the war, Garibaldi partisans were also very doubtful given the political positions and authoritarian methods adopted by Slovenian in their territories. Despite that, almost 1,500 Garibaldi partisans, even with hardship, were obliged to accept the strategy of PCI leaders on 24 December 1944 and they crossed the Isonzo. Their command moved toward Circhina and Zakri≈æ, in the current Slovenia. At the end of the war, Garibaldi partisans were sent to free Lubiana and not Trieste, as initially promised. = Allied missions and conflict between Osoppo and Garibaldi Brigades = Since July 1944, the American Office of Strategic Services (OSS) had begun a linking mission in Friuli with the partisan called Chicago-Texas. This mission was led by two Italian agents affiliated to PCI, Alfredo Michelagnoli and Giuseppe Gozzer.. The mission was organized accordingly to a wider agreement between OSS and PCI, providing the enrolment of \\"experienced men\\" appointed by the party, in exchange for the use of the radio of the secret service by the party in order to communicate with their leaders in the territories occupied by nazi-fascists.. However, Gozzer, although he headed a mission of the Allies, began soon the chief of staff of the Brigata Garibaldi-Friuli, generating uncertainties among the members of Special Operations Executive (SOE, one of the British secret services for the operation behind the enemy lines) already active in the zone, who did not know when consider the initiatives of Gozzer as adopted in his qualify as representative of Americans or in that of communist partisan commander. On the other hand, there was not any specific coordination between the missions of OSS and SOE and this situation generated \\"the most complete confusion\\",As written in a report of te commander of the Allaid liaison mission for Liguria and Emilia, drafted on 23 May 1945. putting in involuntary competition the missions started independently on the same territory, and provoking inefficiency and undue dangers for the Allies agents themselves.In March 1945 some German deserters, exfiltrated along with some partisans (actively sought by the Nazis) from the OSS, came across - disguised with German uniforms - in an SOE mission completely unaware of everything: the British soldiers were about to shoot them on the spot as spies and it was just time to clear up the tragic misunderstanding. Moreover, the different approach of the Allied missions did not provide to partisans a coherent figure of the Anglo-American alliance and made their military action less efficient.. The scarcity of material sent by air by the Allies (always subordinated to the needs of war on other fronts and starting from a limited availability) and the notable gap between the promises of missions and the material actually sent (beside the different promises of OSS and SOE agents), induced the local Resistance to a cynical attitude following the development of a lack of trust in the Allies, thus encouraging revolutionary propaganda and adherence to pro-Soviet tendencies.. In general, as Claudio Pavone explains, if the supplies did not reach the brigades, or few came, partisans often tended to believe that this was due to the fact that \\"the British and American armies were still instruments of two capitalist and imperialist powers and imperialist\\".. Agent Nicholson of the British service, who also supported the Garibaldi groups in negotiations with the Osoppo Brigades, assessed the work of Gozzer with extreme harshness,.In December 1944 Gozzer, a prominent figure in the partisan movement for his courage and his spirit of sacrifice, was captured by the Germans and deported to Germany, where he was later shot. stigmatizing how, in his opinion, the OSS was relying on a \\"mercenary puppet\\" completely under the control of \\"the most violent communist\\" in northern Italy. At the same time, Michelagnoli sent reports to the OSS in which he praised the Garibaldi Brigades for their \\"fighting spirit\\" and \\"sure anti-fascism\\", while he accused the Osoppo of having numerous ex-fascists and politically compromised personalities among their members, while remarking that there were no noteworthy incidents between the two formations. A different version was given by reports of another OSS mission - led by the American Major Lloyd Smith - sent to the area and controlled by a section of the service different from the one responsible for the Chicago-Texas. Lloyd Smith, in his reports, indicated Gozzer as an active communist propagandist, consciously committed to sabotaging peace attempts between various partisan groups in which Lloyd Smith himself was engaged. Lloyd Smith unsuccessfully asked his command to be given the necessary authority to impose his point of view - that it was the political one on the Allied side, considering the pacification and coordination between Osoppo and Garibaldi as useful and necessary - arriving at threaten the withdrawal of their mission. In November 1944 similar protests of the British side, relating to the same situation, came to the OSS command of Caserta. However, the head of the criticized mission, Suhling, severely rejected the accusations, turning them over Nicholson and Smith, claiming that they were the ones who gave a political connotation to their action in order to \\"unify formations of different ideological origins\\", thus contributing to interpret allied action as a \\"political pressure\\" and claiming to \\"influence if not to lead\\" the partisan organizations. Suhling concluded by proposing the removal of Smith. The tiring but largely unsuccessful attempts of pacification and unification of the Osoppo and Garibaldi Brigades conducted by British agents during the summer of 1944 failed definitively when the area was subjected to violent raids by Germans. Nicholson could only acknowledge that, among the Garibaldi, the hostility towards the Allies (due to the lack of supply launches and to the poor progress of the advance in Italy) and to the Osoppo had grown, rather than decreased. At the same time the Garibaldi had increased their political activity. Indeed, the British agents had been threatened with arrests and executions. Following these facts and threats, Nicholson himself moved to Udine, thus abandoning his sector. On the eastern side of the Tagliamento river (which constituted a true natural border with a large gravel bed about one kilometre wide) the situation was even more difficult, as this territory was openly claimed by the Yugoslav partisans. These combined a strongly hostile policy towards the Osoppo with a continuous pressure so that the Garibaldini were placed directly at their dependencies. An allied agent sent to the area, led by Major Thomas MacPherson, wrote a report to his command in which he stated that the Slovenian 9th Corps considered the major and the Osoppo as collaborators of the Germans and that, for this reason, both the British mission and the Osoppo had to be eliminated at any cost, as they were considered elements that opposed their annexation design. The Osoppo Brigades, in particular, were considered as the \\"natural enemy\\" by Slovenian partisans, who led violent propaganda against them, disarming them wherever possible, and denying them any right to recruit. At that point, the agent concluded, the Osoppo Brigades were fighting against seven enemies at once: the Germans, the Russians (serving the Germans), the RSI Fascists, the Slovenians, the Garibaldi partisans, the civil spies and the winter. In November 1944, the Garibaldi Natisone division passed under the direct dependence of Slovenians, closing each contact with the Osoppo. MacPherson, solicited also by the Allied command of Caserta tried to do a last but vain mediation. On 15 December 1944 MacPherson met the leaders of Natisone and complained how, since their passage to the 9th Corps, frequent incidents occurred between the Garibaldi and Osoppo Brigades, adding that the political divergences had to be absolutely postponed to the end of the war and that they could not be a hindrance to military operation in any case, underlying how the Allies were bound by international agreements which did not allow them to interfere in the internal politics of the freed countries. However, the appeal was vain. In his report written after the end of the war, MacPherson thought that the Garibaldi partisans had accepted the advice of a unified command with the Osoppo Brigades only in order to obtain in exchange an increase of launches of supplies by the Allies, then bagging most of them.that they preserved during the German fall attack, while the Osoppo partisans, heavily defeated, lost most of their equipment. The passage of the Natisone under Slovenian command marked the occupation of the whole area by the 9th Corpss which, according to MacPherson, declared the Italian language illegal there, imposing the use of Slovene in every sphere, and organized some annexation \\"plebiscites\\" with voting papers opened under the threat of weapons. Men of the 9th corpus also launched a violent propaganda campaign against the Osoppo Brigades, arresting and deporting some of the relays, and accusing their partisans of capitalism, fascism and collaboration with the Germans. However it was the Slovenes, in a certain sense, who collaborated with the Germans, reporting to them the Osoppo bases and movements. At the same time, both the Osoppo and the British mission were accused of being German spies.As reported by MacPherson, on 1 February 1945 an English mission patrol removed signs left by the Slovenians just 200 meters from a Cossack command serving the Germans in order to indicate them the location of the Osovians in the area. Despite these complaints, the position of the SOE was not changed in an anti-communist sense and, indeed, it was concerned to keep clear that the positions expressed by its agents were to be attributed exclusively to themselves, and not to the service. Therefore, at the beginning of February 1945, SOE informed its agents that it was not possible to intervene in any way on the Slovenes, and that the agents were required to stay out of any clash between Slovenes and non- communist partisans.. = Porz√ªs massacre = The Osoppo Brigades were involved in a massacre occurred on 7 February 1945 near the malghe of Porz√ªs (comune of Faedis, Eastern Friuli). The event, connected to the specific situation on the eastern border with the strong ideological motivations of communist Garibaldi partisans and the nationalist rancours between Slavs and Italians, was the most severe bloodshed between partisan formations during the Resistance. In Porz√ªs there was the command of the Gruppo delle Brigate Est della Divisione Osoppo (\\"Group of the Eastern Brigades of the Osoppo Divisio\\") led by Alpini commander Francesco De Gregori, known as \\"Bolla\\". His autonomous formation operated in region dominated by Garibaldi formations of Slovenian 9th Corps. The Osoppo partisans, with their continuous protests against the Yugoslav nationalist aims and the collaborationist policy of the Garibaldi, reported also by Bolla at the Udine NLC, provoked the reation of the communist members of the Committee who ordered the GAP members of the zone to attack the Osoppo headquarter. About a hundred gappisti were then sent to the place under the command of Mario Toffanin \\"Giacca\\", a highly ideological and extremist partisan who captured \\"Bolla\\" and other Osoppo commanders, including the GL member Gastone Valente \\"Enea\\". Toffanin immediately shot them and subtracted correspondences, weapons and supplies.. Later, all the other Osoppo partisan, including Guido Pasolini (elder brother of Pier Paolo), were killed excepting two who accepted to join the GAP. The massacre had judiciary consequences with a long trial which ended with severe penalties. = March and April 1945 = In March, the Osoppo brigades operated with five divisions and included: * 1¬™ Brigata Osoppo Prealpi with a Prealps battalion * 2¬™ brigata Osoppo with \\"Val But\\" and \\"Tolmezzo\\" battalions * 3¬™ brigata Osoppo with battaglione Giustizia * 5¬™ brigata Osoppo with battaglione Piave; * 1¬™ divisione Osoppo Carnia with battaglione Carnia * 2¬™ divisione Osoppo territoriale with \\"Pontebba\\" and \\"Ledra\\" battalions * 2¬™ divisione Gruppo sud with brigata Osoppo Martelli and 2¬∫ battaglione Partidor * Brigata Autonoma Rosselli * Battaglione Divisionale Guastatori * Battaglione Divisionale Monte Canin  Notable members  * Primo Cresta * Cecilia Deganutti * Renato Del Din * Paola Del Din * Francesco De Gregori * Galliano Fogar * Don Aldo Moretti * Guido Pasolini * Tarcisio Petracco * Zefferino Tom√® = Awarded = The followings are the partisans awarded with the Italian Gold Medal of Military Valour. * Giovanni Battista Berghinz * Cecilia Deganutti * Renato Del Din * Paola Del Din * Francesco De Gregori * Don Aldo Moretti * Pierino Celetto * Pietro Maset * Giuseppe De Monte * Aldo Zamorani * Luigi Antonio Tami * Giuseppe Gozzer * Terzo Drusin * Franco Martelli  See also  * Porz√ªs massacre * Porz√ªs (film) * Italian resistance movement * Christian Democracy * Italian partisan brigades * Brigate del popolo * Brigate Fiamme Verdi * Friuli * Foibe massacres * Organizzazione O  References   Bibliography     *  External links  * Category:Italian Resistance Category:Anti-fascist organisations in Italy ","title":"Brigate Osoppo"},{"id":"61787263","text":"Major General Sam Oskar Myhrman (26 December 1912 ‚Äì 3 February 1965) was a Swedish Air Force officer.

Administrative and municipal status  Municipally, Kharachoy is incorporated as Kharachoyskoye rural settlement. It is the administrative center of the municipality and the only settlement included in it.  Geography  Map of Vedensky District. Kharachoy is in the east Kharachoy is located in the gorge of the Khulkuhlau River. It is located south of the village of Vedeno. The nearest settlements to Kharachoy are Mekhkadettan-Irze in the north-west, Dyshne-Vedeno and Vedeno in the north, and Dzhani-Vedeno in the north-east. The republic of Dagestan is to the east and south-east.  History  In Kharachoy and the nearby area, ancient objects and burial grounds can be found. Kharachoy is the ancestral village of Chechen folk hero Zelimxan. According to local resident, Taimagaz Sultanova, one of the oldest residents of Chechnya (as of 2014, when she turned 109), on the night of 23 February 1944, all of the men in the village were locked into the local mosque and the other residents of the village were sent to Kazakhstan in exile. Upon the return in 1958, she said that \\"there was nothing left of our village, just land\\". In 1944, after the genocide and deportation of the Chechen and Ingush people and the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was abolished, the village of Kharachoy was renamed to Khvarshi, and settled by people from the neighboring republic of Dagestan. From 1944 to 1957, it was a part of the Vedensky District of the Dagestan ASSR. In 1958, after the Vaynakh people returned and the Chechen-Ingush ASSR was restored, the village regained its old Chechen name, Kharachoy.  Kharachoy in the Chechen Wars  On 24 October 1995, in a fight with separatists in the area of Kharachoy, Artur Voloshin, a member of the Amur Oblast Internal Affairs, took a wounded group commander out of the danger into a shelter. He then moved other crew members into the sheltered area. Even though he was seriously wounded, he remained and covered other troops with machine-gun fire. He lost his life as a result and after his death he gained the title, Hero of the Russian Federation. On 17 November 1999, a battle took place near to Kharachoy between some militants and the 31st Ulyanovsk Airborne Brigade. As a result, 12 of the 14 paratroopers were killed, and 2 were seriously injured. On 30 December 1999, a commander in the Red Banner Northern Fleet, Yuri Kuryagin, together with his platoon, fell into battle with a group of around 15 militants. During the battle, he was injured and shot in the leg, but showed courage and heroism, and refused to move to the back of the group. The next day, on 31 December 1999, the militants attacked the group again, this time with grenades and flamethrowers. There were around 100 militants during this attack. Kuryagin himself was able to kill 4 of the militants before being shot by a sniper. After his death, he gained the title, Hero of the Russian Federation.  Population  * 2002 Census: 618 * 2010 Census: 762 * 2019 estimate: 869 According to the results of the 2010 Census, the majority of residents of Kharachoy were ethnic Chechens.

His professional career was devoted to the development of the programming language APL. He was the designer and implementer of direct functions.  Personal  John Scholes was born on 24 April 1948 to Gerry and Amy Scholes. He grew up in Leamington Spa, Warwickshire, England, and attended Leamington College for Boys between 1960-1966. Between 1966-69 he attended the University of Manchester and received the B.Sc. (with Honors) degree in maths. Scholes enjoyed poetic and romantic qualities in his life. Apart from APL, he also found beauty in nature, the opera, the music of Tom Waits, the literature of James Joyce, the poetry of W.B. Yeats. He was a member of the Joyce society in Dublin. In 2013, he and his wife Flora Dowling went to Sligo to the W.B. Yeats Summer School and met the poet Seamus Heaney the summer before Heaney died. The APL side and the romantic side often met: The Depth-First Search video (below) was recorded at dawn on the summer solstice of 2014, with birdsong in the air, while he and his wife were on a 21-day Zen retreat in France led by Th√≠ch Nh·∫•t H·∫°nh. Scholes was pleased with both the technical content and the circumstances of that work.  Career  Scholes's first job was as a trainee computer programmer with International Computers Limited (ICL) (1969-70) and from there he went on to the Operations Research Department of WS Atkins in Epsom, Surrey (1971-75) and then to the Sales Support Department in Warrington, Lancashire (1976-77). Between 1977 and 1978 he worked with the European Space Agency in Madrid, Spain as a programmer for the International Ultraviolet Explorer project. He then returned to ICL Dataskil working on APL for the VME/B operating system (1978-82). In 1982, he started the Dyalog APL project for Unix machines, and in 1988 became a partner and director of the Dyalog Company. In 2004, Scholes sold his shares in the company, but continued as a consultant and, in his words, pursued his passionate interest in APL programming on various mathematical topics in general and functional programming and dfns in particular. Or \\"nerding\\", as he also called it. = Direct functions (dfns) = Kenneth E. Iverson, the inventor of APL, was dissatisfied with the way user functions were defined. In 1974, he devised \\"formal function definition\\" or \\"direct definition\\" for use in exposition. A direct definition has two or four parts, separated by colons: name : expression name : expresssion0 : proposition : expression1 Within a direct definition, denotes the left argument and the right argument. In the first instance, the result of is the result of the function; in the second instance, the result of the function is that of if evaluates to 0, or if it evaluates to 1. Assignments within a direct definition are dynamically local. Examples of using direct definition are found in the 1979 Turing Award Lecture and in books and application papers. Direct definition was too limited for use in larger systems. The ideas were further developed by multiple authors in multiple works, but the results were unwieldy. Of these, the \\"alternative APL function definition\\" of Bunda in 1987 came closest to current facilities, but is flawed in conflicts with existing symbols and in error handling which would have caused practical difficulties, and was never implemented. The main distillates from the different proposals were that (a) the function being defined is anonymous, with subsequent naming (if required) being effected by assignment; (b) the function is denoted by a symbol and thereby enables anonymous recursion. In 1996, Scholes invented direct functions or dfns (pronounced \\"dee funs\\"), a major distinguishing advance of early 21st century APL over prior versions. Dfns are a unique combination of array programming, higher-order functions, and functional programming. The ideas originated in 1989 when he read a special issue of The Computer Journal on functional programming. He then proceeded to study functional programming and became strongly motivated (\\"sick with desire\\", like Yeats) to bring these ideas to APL. He initially operated in stealth because he was concerned the changes might be judged too radical and an unnecessary complication of the language; other observers say that he operated in stealth because Dyalog colleagues were not so enamored and thought he was wasting his time and causing trouble for people. Dfns were first presented in the Dyalog Vendor Forum at the APL '96 Conference and released in Dyalog APL in early 1997. Acceptance and recognition were slow in coming. As late as 2008, in Dyalog at 25, a publication celebrating the 25th anniversary of Dyalog Ltd, dfns were barely mentioned (mentioned twice as \\"dynamic functions\\" and without elaboration). As of 2019, dfns are implemented in Dyalog APL, NARS2000, and ngn/apl. They also play a key role in efforts to exploit the computational capabilities of a GPU (graphics processing unit). Dfns are illustrated here with an example. Much more extensive explanation and examples are found in the direct functions article and in the references. Quicksort on an array works by choosing a \\"pivot\\" at random among its major cells, then catenating the sorted major cells which strictly precede the pivot, the major cells equal to the pivot, and the sorted major cells which strictly follow the pivot, as determined by a comparison function . Defined as a dop (direct operator) : Q‚Üê{1‚â•‚â¢‚çµ:‚çµ ‚ãÑ (‚àá ‚çµ‚åø‚ç®0>s)‚ç™(‚çµ‚åø‚ç®0=s)‚ç™‚àá ‚çµ‚åø‚ç®0 is a variant that catenates the three parts enclosed by the function instead of the parts per se. The three parts generated at each recursive step are apparent in the structure of the final result. Applying the function derived from to the same argument multiple times gives different results because the pivots are chosen at random. In-order traversal of the results does yield the same sorted array. Q3‚Üê{1‚â•‚â¢‚çµ:‚çµ ‚ãÑ (‚äÇ‚àá ‚çµ‚åø‚ç®0>s)‚ç™(‚äÇ‚çµ‚åø‚ç®0=s)‚ç™‚äÇ‚àá ‚çµ‚åø‚ç®0 The above formulation is not new; see for example Figure 3.7 of the classic The Design and Analysis of Computer Algorithms.

Expert assessments Saddled with Power, 2014, Oil on Canvas The large part of Igor Gubskiy's artworks is portraits. To this genre, the artist remains paradoxical faithful in modern times. The style of his artworks continues the traditions of the psychological portrait of classical and pre-avant-garde art. The artistic and technical practices of Igor Gubskiy's works refer us to the picturesque world of Diego Vel√°zquez paintings, the expressive world of Francisco Goya paintings, dramatic world of Rembrandt paintings. Igor Gubskiy thoughtfully transforms the technical findings and techniques of Nikolay Feshin and Corneliu Baba in his artworks. The art historian Roman Zvinyatskovskiy about the works that were represented at the exhibition in Malm√∂: > The people in Igor Gubskiy portraits are not fantastic figures. They are > examples of ordinary people, maybe a little bit strange, from the artist's > childhood, that made the strongest impressions on him. The artist often > selects his motives from the so-called society of the lower strata, where he > finds universal human and aesthetic values. Igor Gubsky does not seek to > emphasize this in his paintings deliberately, but nevertheless, the result > is evident. For me, Igor Gubskiy's art is \\"aristocratic democracy\\". This > term, of course, contains two words that are opposites of each other, but > this contrary characterizes the artist's art in the best way. Who's there? 2009, 100 cm —Ö 100 cm, Oil on Canvas The famous Ukrainian art critic Olesya Avramenko wrote: > Igor Gubskiy is an artist with a steady hand and a precise eye, who brings > life to his paintings with a few dynamic strokes. His works are full of life > and trembling. He is the genius master who can brilliantly translate natural > impressions into sharp, expressive, recognizable images.

Biography Bancroft grew up in Lakewood, California, from a working-class background, where his father was a housepainter and his mother worked at a grocery. He attended the California Institute for the Arts (CalArts), where his academic studies focused on trumpet and his mentors included Edward Carroll. Bancroft also developed particular interests in drumming and Ghanaian dance. He earned a BFA degree from CalArts in 2011 and an MFA degree from CalArts in 2013. One of Bancroft's earliest experiences in conducting was the direction of an ad hoc ensemble in the Requiem of Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, in a memorial concert for his father in 2010. He continued conducting studies at the Royal Conservatoire of Scotland (RCS). During his studies at the RCS, he played trumpet with the BBC Scottish Symphony Orchestra (BBC SSO), and conducted the BBC SSO, Red Note, and the Royal Scottish National Orchestra.

Variety, 10 September 2019. The film is set in a large, tower-style \\"Vertical Self-Management Center\\". Its residents, who are switched every 30 days between its many floors, are fed via a platform which, initially filled with food at the top floor, gradually descends through the tower's levels, stopping for a fixed amount of time on each. The system inevitably leads to conflict, as the residents at the top levels get to eat as much as they can, with each level getting only the leftovers from the previous ones. The film's cast includes Iv√°n Massagu√©, Antonia San Juan, Zorion Eguileor, Emilio Buale Coka and Alexandra Masangkay. The film premiered at the 2019 Toronto International Film Festival, where it won the People's Choice Award for Midnight Madness.Jessica Wong, \\"TIFF 2019: Jojo Rabbit captures TIFF People's Choice Award\\". CBC News, 15 September 2019. At TIFF, the film also secured a worldwide streaming deal with Netflix.Jeremy Kay, \\"Netflix takes world on TIFF Midnight Madness hit 'The Platform'\\". Screen Daily, 10 September 2019. It was released on the streaming service on 20 March 2020. Plot Goreng wakes in a concrete cell marked with the number 48. His cellmate, Trimagasi, explains that they are in a \\"Vertical Self-Management Center\\", a tower-style facility in which food is delivered via a platform that travels from the top, stopping for a fixed period on each floor. Those on lower levels can eat only what those above leave, and the cell is heated or cooled to fatal temperatures if anyone tries to keep any of the food. People are randomly reassigned to a new level every month. Each resident is allowed to bring one item in with them, Goreng choosing a copy of Don Quixote, and Trimagasi a self-sharpening knife. Trimagasi reveals that when assigned to level 132, he and his former cellmate cannibalized a resident who had fallen down the shaft. One day, a bloodied woman named Miharu rides down on the platform. Trimagasi explains that she descends the pit every month in search of her child. As they talk, it is revealed that Goreng volunteered to spend six months in the facility in exchange for a diploma, and Trimagasi is serving a year-long sentence for manslaughter. Over the first month, they become friends, but on the day of the room shuffle, Goreng wakes up tied to the bed. They have been reassigned to level 171, where the platform is expected to be empty of food when it arrives. Trimagasi explains that he plans to cut strips of Goreng's flesh to sustain them both. On the eighth day, Trimagasi cuts into Goreng's leg but is attacked by Miharu as she comes down the platform. She frees Goreng and he kills Trimagasi. Miharu cuts some of Trimagasi's flesh, feeding Goreng and eating some herself before continuing down. In the third month, Goreng awakes on level 33 with a woman, Imoguiri, and her dog. Goreng recognizes her as the Administration official who interviewed him before sending him to the cells. She says she was unaware of the horrible conditions and volunteered to try to fix things when she was diagnosed with terminal cancer. Imoguiri rations her food and attempts to convince those below to do so as well, but they ignore her. Goreng mentions Miharu's search for her child to Imoguiri, but Imoguiri says that children under 16 are not allowed into the facility and Miharu entered alone. Goreng awakens the following month on level 202 and finds that Imoguiri has hanged herself. Goreng eats her flesh to survive, experiencing hallucinations of her and Trimagasi instructing him to do so. At the start of the fifth month, Goreng is assigned to level 6. His new cellmate, Baharat, attempts unsuccessfully to climb to the upper level. Estimating that there are 250 levels, Goreng convinces Baharat to ride the platform down with him, rationing the food so all get a share. As they descend, they hand out portions to the prisoners, attacking those who refuse to cooperate. On the way, they encounter Miharu fighting two other inmates and try to save her, but she is killed and they are severely injured. Goreng and Baharat continue to descend, eventually reaching level 333 where the platform stops. Goreng notices a child - Miharu's daughter - hiding under the bed. He gets off the platform, followed hesitantly by Baharat, only to have the platform continue downward, leaving them behind. Despite Baharat's reluctance, they feed the girl an untouched panna cotta they had saved as a \\"message\\" for the Administrators at the top. Goreng passes out and dreams of Baharat telling him that \\"the girl is the message.\\" The next day, Goreng finds Baharat dead of his injuries and takes the child with him when the platform arrives. They descend to the bottom of the pit, where he once again sees Trimagasi, who tells him that \\"the message requires no bearer.\\" Goreng gets off the platform and walks away with Trimagasi, both turning to watch as the girl ascends.

The film script is based on a theatre script by David Desola and Pedro Rivero, to which more action and physical elements were added to make it more suitable for a film. \\"Extensive\\" rewriting was required to convert the unproduced theater script into a film script. The director said it was a \\"torturous ordeal\\", as the writers defended their artistic vision and did not want some of the changes to be made. The cement prison cells were built for the production in a Red Cross facility in a port in Bilbao. The director asked for cells that looked \\"economical, robust, [and] impregnable\\", which emphasized a sense of architectural and engineering proportion. Only two tiers of concrete cells were built; the appearance of many tiers of cells extending above and below each cell (visible from the hole in the center of each cell) was added in post-production using special effects. The director says the vertical tower of cells \\"represents the dehumanized coldness of the Vertical Self-Management Center\\". The director states that the film's lavish \\"food was treated as another character in the story, one that is aesthetically antagonistic to the architecture of the prison.\\" The luxurious displays of gourmet food were presented on \\"Versailles- worthy tableware\\" to depict \\"excessive, almost erotic, opulent desire\\" that is eventually \\"desecrated\\" once the near-empty platform reaches the abject, starving inmates on the lower levels. The director acknowledges that the film can be difficult to watch, but he says the purpose of this approach is to generate discussion and debate by viewers about the political messages. When asked about the film's brutal violence and cannibalism, the director said the prison's \\"hole is a reflection of our society, [so] it couldn‚Äôt hide the violence. It had to show how we rip each other apart\\". The film uses two actors who are cast against type; Iv√°n Massagu√© and Antonia San Juan, who are known for their comedic roles, were chosen to lighten the film's weighty subject by adding \\"humour, irony, and surrealism\\". The film was shot chronologically, as the main actor Iv√°n had to lose 12 kilos over the six-week shoot to show his physical deterioration.  Release  The film was released onto Netflix on 20 March 2020. In July 2020, Netflix revealed the film had in- fact been watched by 56 million households over its first four weeks of release, among the most-ever for one of their original films. Critical response On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 80% based on 89 reviews, with an average rating of 7.13/10. The site's critical consensus reads: \\"While it may feel muddled at times, The Platform is an inventive and captivating dystopian thriller.\\" On Metacritic, the film has a weighted average score of 73 out of 100, based on 15 critics, indicating \\"generally favorable reviews\\". Norman Wilner of Now correctly predicted that the film would win the People's Choice Award, giving it a five-N rating and writing that the film \\"has everything: low comedy, political allegory, left-field twists, crowd-pleasing surprises, spectacular violence, sadism, altruism, and yet more spectacular violence, all wrapped up in a high- concept horror film that moves the premise of Cube into a merciless vertical structure. It‚Äôs grotesque and compelling, like grindhouse [Luis] Bu√±uel. And it never blinks.\\"Norman Wilner, \\"TIFF review: The Platform (El Hoyo)\\". Now, 1 September 2019. Amy Nicholson of Variety wrote that \\"the film‚Äôs minimalist fury feels like the plays of Samuel Beckett. Massagu√© and Eguileor are up to being in a zesty Waiting for Godot. And Eguileor's nasty, delightful, occasionally tender performance feels like an audition to play a Bond villain, or perhaps the Spanish resurrection of Hannibal Lecter.\\" The film has garnered new reviews after surging popularity during the COVID-19 pandemic. Sam Jones in The Guardian suggested it was \\"the perfect parable for life in the time of the coronavirus and a visceral investigation of how a crisis can expose not only the stratification of human society but also the immutable strands of selfishness coded into our DNA.\\"  See also  * Stone Soup * Allegory of the long spoons References External links Category:2019 films Category:2010s science fiction horror films Category:Films about cannibalism Category:Films about food and drink Category:Films set in prison Category:Spanish films Category:Spanish science fiction horror films Category:Spanish-language Netflix original films Category:Dystopian films Category:Fictional buildings and structures ","title":"The Platform (film)"},{"id":"61787714","text":"Reginald Long can refer to: * Reginald Long, British screenwriter and actor * Reginald \\"Reggie\\" Long, a fictional characters from DC Comics, the second Rorschach ","title":"Reginald Long (disambiguation)"},{"id":"61787771","text":"Craig Bohmler (born April 7, 1956)Hansen, Niels-Henning. \\"En tilgang til den klassiske Musik\\".

They are sometimes referred to as \\"snorkel snails\\" due to the tubular structure found on the final whorl of their shell, which resembles a snorkel. Description The shell is subdiscoidal with a broad umbilicus. The last whorl is separate from the rest of the shell and features a tube-like snorkel structure. The operculum is multispiral. Etymology The name is derived from \\"rhion\\" meaning a promontory and \\"stoma\\" meaning hole. In anatomy, a promontory is another word for a protuberance, so Rhiostoma can be understood to mean \\"protruding hole.\\" This name refers to the snorkel on the shell which is the defining characteristic of the genus. Ecology Somwang Pathamakanthin of Thailand said about the ecology of Rhiostoma, \\"As we have kept some living animals of Rhiostoma species in our garden, we know that most of them burrow into the ground during the day and are active only when it is raining or-sometimes-during the night, when the temperature is lower and the humidity is higher. When it is extremely hot during the day, we observed that species of the large variety of Rhiostoma smithi (from the Chanthaburi province) preferred to move into water, where they stayed for days! Others have been resting under the shade of trees, under rocks and fallen wood. We have been informed that the bluish Rhiostoma from Songkhla province prefers to burrow into the soil underneath fallen wood or under stones close to the foot of limestone hills.\\"p.\\" Taxonomy Species within the genus Rhiostoma include MolluscaBase (2018).

In 1938, three years prior to the discovery of antibodies against the Rh antigen, Darrow correctly hypothesized that the disease was caused by destruction of red blood cells due to antibodies in the mother's blood. Darrow's research was inspired by her personal experiences with the disease. Biography Darrow was born in 1895. She did her undergraduate studies at Western Reserve University and graduated from Rush Medical College in Chicago, Illinois, in 1930. Five years later she had her third child, a son, with her husband Dr. Chester Darrow. Her son suffered from erythroblastosis fetalis (now known as hemolytic disease of the newborn) and died shortly after birth. Darrow began to research HDN with a dedication that her colleagues described as consuming her; she later stated that after her son's death, \\"the study of this disease has been my chief avocation\\". At the time, the disease was believed to be caused by a metabolic defect of red blood cells. In 1938, while working as a physician at the Women's and Children's Hospital in Chicago, Darrow published a review of HDN in the Archives of Pathology that drew on her personal experiences in addition to the existing literature. Darrow reasoned that given the disease's effect on red blood cells, its familial occurrence, and the tendency of women's first few pregnancies to be unaffected, the cause of HDN must involve the mother becoming immunized against some element of the fetus's red cells after they enter the mother's circulation. The maternal antibody could then cross into the fetal circulation and cause an antigen-antibody reaction resulting in destruction of red blood cells. Darrow's hypothesis about the cause of HDN is consistent with the current understanding, even though the antibodies involved in HDN had yet to be discovered when Darrow published her paper. However, the paper received little attention at the time, perhaps due to its 40-page length and its publication in a journal of pathology rather than pediatrics. While her description of the general mechanism of HDN was correct, Darrow believed the causative agent was fetal hemoglobin rather than blood group antibodies. She based this hypothesis on studies by Louis K. Diamond which showed that the parents of babies with HDN usually had compatible ABO blood types; the Rh antigen was poorly understood at the time. Darrow's belief in this hypothesis was strengthened when she had her blood type tested in 1941 and the result was Rh positive. However, this result was erroneous, and a repeat test three years later showed she was Rh negative. In 1941, Philip Levine and colleagues published a paper that confirmed Darrow's antigen-antibody theory of HDN using serologic testing. Levine's testing conclusively demonstrated the presence of Rh antibodies in HDN. A colleague of Levine's recollected that \\"bubbling with excitement yet reluctant to overturn established dogma and aware that he was venturing into uncharted seas, Levine was visibly reassured when his attention was called to Ruth Darrow's paper in the Archives of Pathology\\". In 1941, Darrow gave birth to a daughter at the Women and Children's Hospital. Her daughter, like her son, suffered from HDN. Darrow, working with her intern Josephine Chapin, devised a treatment plan based on her research. Despite the high mortality rate of HDN at the time, Darrow's daughter made a full recovery. Darrow died in 1956 in Chicago, Illinois. Selected publications * \\"Icterus gravis (erythroblastosis) neonatorum\\".

Early life  Jones was born on 1 May 1816 at Tyn-y- Cae, Penmachno, to parents Owen and Grace Jones.  Family  In 1843, Jones married Ann Owen of Bwlch Bach, Dolwyddelan. Their son Owen Jones died in 1877 of liver failure. Their youngest daughter Jeanie G. Jones was married in 1884.  Writer  Jones was a prominent poet in Eisteddfod circles and was a noted local historian. His essay on Penmachno, written in the mid 19th century, was first published in 1884 (after his death) in \\"Gweithiau Gethin\\" (The Works of Gethin). The essay refers to the first nonconformist sermon in the parish in about 1784 at Penrhyn Uchaf; it describes the buildings at Dugoed farm () (the oldest part of the farmhouse was built around 1517) and reflects on the possible sites of historical significance on the farm itself, including Tomen y Castell as a possible fort and the field Cae'r Braint (\\"Field of Honour\\") which may have contained a great Bardic circle. In 1875, he was a member of the committee organising the National Eisteddfod in Pwllheli.  Contractor and quarry owner  Tyddyn Cethin Pont Gethin under construction in 1875 The station building at Betws-y-coed Between 1861 and 1863, Jones built the Rhiwbach Tramway serving eight of the slate quarries at Blaenau Ffestiniog. He also built the Betws-y-Coed and Pont-y-Pant stations and the Pont Gethin viaduct on the Conwy Valley Line spanning the Lledr Valley, and St Mary's Church, Betws-y-Coed. Jones built the parsonage at Llandrillo, Denbighshire in 1872. In the mid 1870s, Jones opened the Bwlch Gordduant quarry in the Crimea Pass between Blaenau Ffestiniog and Dolwyddelan. This was not a great success and he sold the quarry to the owner of the Prince Llewellyn quarry in late 1876.  Death  Jones circa 1880 In early 1882, Jones was paralysed and subsequently confined to his home. He died on 29 January 1883, at Tyddyn Cethin in Penmachno (as recorded in 1871 and 1881 Wales censuses and National Probate Calendar for 1883, but currently known as Tyddyn Gethin ()) .

D. G. Hogarth of The English Historical Review wrote that the author's main concern was constituent legislation and that the work \\"is not intended to be a complete publication of either the civil or the criminal code in use.\\"Hogarth, p. 187. Part I, Volumes I-III, were published in 1905, while Part II, Volumes IV-VI, were published in 1906. Background Young worked for Embassy of the United Kingdom in the Ottoman Empire in Constantinople (now Istanbul). At the time of publication he worked for the Embassy of the United Kingdom in Spain as a second secretary. // Alternate publication: The Law Magazine and Review: A Quarterly Review of Jurisprudence. Saunders and Benning, 1906. p. 118-119 An archivist and other officials assisted him in his efforts. He had no background in Asian studies nor in law. Young used non-public material, including the archives of the UK embassy in Constantinople, to build his book. \\\\- Cited: p. 444 In regards to the embassy archival work Hogarth stated that it was done \\"under certain well- known restrictions, of course\\". Contents Each book has a table of contents, as well as an introduction written in English. There is no index. Young provided explanatory notes for each category. Volume I describes law relating to the courts and government, including immovable property. Volume II describes law relating to the military, non-Muslim millets, and public order. Volume III describes foreign affairs, maritime affairs, and public health. Hogarth wrote that the book highlights \\"the inferior position which British capital and enterprise hold in Turkey in comparison with the capital and enterprise of other nations, notably the French.\\"Hogarth, p. 188-189. Hogarth also stated \\"Whenever possible he puts in a good word for the existing r√©gime in Turkey\\" and that \\"It is obvious that (as he warns us in his preface) he has not said the whole truth in every case. Certain susceptibilities and interests have had to be considered.\\" Reception Hogarth praised the book, stating that there was no hitherto book covering its ground.Hogarth, p. 186. Hogarth concluded \\"We hope enough has been said to recommend these valuable volumes to historical students.\\"Hogarth, p. 189. He stated that it would have been nice had Ottoman Turkish original documents been included, as that while there were relatively few people who would study the originals, including them would have benefited them and the inclusion \\"unquestionably would have secured the fame of this book as a permanent and final work of reference.\\" Hogarth added that there were some minor errors, \\"but none of much importance.\\" Law Quarterly Review wrote that while the work was not likely to be read by a large audience, \\"he has made excellent use of his opportunities\\" and \\"it is a credit\\" to his publishers and to the British diplomatic staff.

William F. Downing (1860 ‚Äì August 5, 1908) was a notorious outlaw during the Wild West era in Arizona. Downing had fled from the Texas Rangers posse that was after him when he came to Arizona. In Arizona, he was involved in the killing of William S. ‚ÄúSlim‚Äù Traynor and in various train robberies including the robbery of the Train Depot in the town of Cochise. Downing was so unpopular that even members of his gang couldn't stand him. Early years Downing was born in Texas. He was in trouble with the law when he came to Arizona Territory, with a Texas Rangers posse in pursuit. Allegedly his real name was Frank Jackson, a teenager who was a member of the Sam Bass gang. Jackson had been involved in a shoot-out at Round Rock, Texas between the Bass gang and the Texas Rangers in July, 1878. Jackson was shot in one leg, but survived. The posse killed Bass, however Jackson escaped and rode through New Mexico until he reached Arizona where he assumed the name William F. Downing.\\"Burs under the Saddle, a Second Look At Books and Histories of the West. & More Burs under the Saddle, 2 Volumes; by Ramon F. Adams; Page 431\\"200 Texas Outlaws and Lawmen, 1835‚Äì1935\\"; By: Yadon, Laurence; Page: 53; Publisher: Pelican Publishing Company; Once he settled down, he sent for his wife, Linda Downing who was also a native of Texas. Downing never spoke about his relationship with the Bass gang. He and his wife settled near the small Sulphur Springs Valley mining town of Pearce. Downing worked as a cowhand at nearby ranches. He was hired to work in the Esperanza Ranch, which was known for hiring rustlers, outlaws and renegade Apaches. Though Downing became known for his quarrelsome nature, he was also known to be less quarrelsome when he was drinking whiskey. The killing of William S. ‚ÄúSlim‚Äù Traynor Ranch house in PearceConstable Burt Alvord Downing and his wife moved to the town of Willcox. Downing spent most of his time hanging around saloons and associating with the members of a gang run by Albert R. ‚ÄúBurt‚Äù Alvord, who was the town constable when he wasn't working as a ranch-hand. However, there was a particular person whom Downing did not like and that was William S. ‚ÄúSlim‚Äù Traynor. Traynor, who also went by the name of \\"Bill Traynor\\", was a native of Tennessee who at onetime had been an outlaw, mine guard and was a veteran Rough Rider campaigning in Cuba with Theodore Roosevelt. He was hired by cattle inspector Edwin Russell Hooker to look after his father, Henry Hooker, Sierra Bonita range interests. Traynor was engaged to be married to Mila Allaire, a young lady from a Willcox ranching family. He suspected Downing of stealing cattle and re-branding them. As such he made it known publicly that Downing was a rustler and that he was looking for him. On the evening of May 19, 1899, Traynor and his friend Henry C. Taylor, an off-duty bartender, walked into Tom Fulghum's \\"Elite Saloon\\" on the corner of Maley and Haskell Streets. Some witnesses say that Downing came in after Traynor, while others claim that Downing was already in the saloon. Witnesses to the events that followed stated that when Downing walked in, Traynor dropped his right hand as if going for his gun. Four shots rang out from Bill Downing's pistol and Bill Traynor lay dead on the barroom floor; shot through the head and chest. Downing was arrested and during his trial he claimed the following: \\"I accepted Taylor's invitation to take a cigar and as I answered, (Traynor) whirled around as though he went after his gun. As I stepped up to the bar, I was watching him on account of the threats he had made, and I looked outside. I thought it was a life-and-death matter and drew my gun and jerked Thomas Burts back so as not to shoot him and commenced shooting. I am not certain as to how many shots I fired.‚Äù Constable Alvord testified that he took the pistol and belt off the person of the deceased. He continued to state that he found the pistol loaded with five cartridges and one empty chamber. The pistol was in the scabbard when he took it off the deceased. No one took and checked Downing's gun. According to Constable Alvord, Traynor's body bore wounds from three bullets. One had torn through his breast and exited his shoulder; the other two had penetrated his skull. The coroner's jury found that Downing was acting in self-defense and was justified. The Southern-Pacific Cochise Depot robbery The Soto Brothers Mercantile store which originally was the John H. Norton and Company StoreThe Cochise Southern Pacific Railroad Train Depot in 2019 Constable Burt Alvord was hired by the town of Willcox to police the boisterous cowboys in the area because of his reputation of being a bad man in Tombstone. Alvord hired Bill Downing and Billy Stiles as deputies. Together with their new found legality they would be able to pursue their criminal careers without arousing the suspicion of the town folks. Among the members of the newly founded Alvord-Stiles Gang were local cowboys, such as Matt Burts, the Owen brothers and Jack Dunlap. They conspired to hold up the Southern Pacific's westbound No. 10 train that stopped at Cochise Station at Cochise Junction. In order to carry out their mission Downing burglarized the Soto Brothers Mercantile store in Willcox where they pilfered dynamite. Then, Downing and the gang burglarized a mining camp in Dos Cabezas, where they stole additional dynamite, plus explosive caps and fuse. The date set for the robbery was September 9, 1899. It was Downing's responsibility to tend to the horses. Stiles and Burts were to stop the train at Cochise Station and proceed with the robbery. They held at gun point the engineer, the fireman, the mail clerk and a Wells Fargo man. The safe inside the express car was blown up. Their first heist was successful and they seized between $2,000 and $3,000 in cash and jewelry. Constable Alvord organized a posse when news of the robbery reached Willcox. He sent the posses in all directions except the right one. Downing, Burts and Stiles stashed everything in Burt Alvord's chicken house in Willcox and then they \\"joined the posse.\\" As expected the posse did not find anything. The stolen goods were removed from the chicken house and stashed in Bill Downing's ranch near Pearce. The only member of the gang that took his share was Matt Burts who headed to the state of Oregon. The failed Fairbank train robbery Jeff MiltonThe railroad depot in Fairbank, c. 1900.The Tombstone Courthouse On February 15, 1900, the Alvord-Stiles Gang attempted a second major robbery, this time in Fairbank, Arizona. The members of the gang who participated in the holdup of the New Mexico & Arizona's northbound No. 1 on the Nogales-to-Benson line, were Jesse ‚ÄúThree-Fingered Jack‚Äù Dunlap, Tom ‚ÄúBravo Juan‚Äù Yoas, Robert Brown, and George and Lewis Owings. However, they were unaware that Jeff Milton a Wells Fargo Express messenger was aboard the train that day. Milton, an ex-Texas Ranger, had a long career in law enforcement. The gang's attempt to rob the train failed because of Milton's intervention. He fired his gun and shot Jack Dunlap despite the fact that he himself was wounded with a bullet on his left arm between the shoulder and elbow which shattered the bone and left his arm useless. The gang fled the scene and left Dunlap behind. When a posse from Tombstone arrived and found Dunlap, he decided to cooperate and told them the names of those involved in the attempted but failed robbery. Dunlap died shortly after the encounter, but not before implicating Burt Alvord, Billy Stiles and Bill Downing as the planners of the robbery. Bill Downing and some members of the gang were arrested and sent to the jail in Tombstone, since he had been implicated in the earlier Southern-Pacific Cochise Depot holdup. At the time, train robbery was a capital offense in the Arizona Territory. Downing's trial was set for December 10, 1900, in the Tombstone Courthouse in what is officially known as \\"Territory of Arizona vs. W.F. Downing, case No. 745A\\". On April 7, 1900, Stiles went to Tombstone and went to the jailhouse. He shot Deputy Marshal George Bravin in the foot, and freed the gang members who were in the jail, with the exception of Downing. During the trail some of the members of the Alvord gang turned against Downing and testified against him. Stiles and Matt Burts were among those who testified for the prosecution. However, the majority of the jurors believed that capital punishment is not justified in cases where no lives were lost. Jury foreman L.A. Smith announced before Judge George Russell Davis that even though the jurors believed that Downing was guilty of train robbery, they refused to return a guilty verdict. Even though Downing was acquitted in the robbery case, he was found guilty of interfering with the United States mail, a federal charge and was sentenced to 10 years of prison-time to be served in the Yuma Territorial Prison. Yuma Territorial Prison Yuma Territorial Prison cell with steel bunkers The Yuma Territorial Prison was a prison built by prisoners in 1875. The prison opened while Arizona was still a U.S. territory. Conditions in the prison were harsh. Some prisoners had to sleep in steel bunkbeds. Downing was assigned a number, inmate number 1733, just like any other prisoner. On April 11, 1901, he entered the Yuma prison through the sally port which is a secure, controlled entryway to the prison. Downing's leg became infected and swollen while he was in prison. This was a result of the gunshot injuries he received during a gun battle while riding with the Sam Bass gang back in Texas. The penitentiary physician, Dr. James A. Ketcherside treated the old wound. The doctor suggested that the leg be amputated, but Downings refused to accept the request. Mrs. Downing was an attractive lady who was in poor health. While her husband was incarcerated, she sold their property in Willcox and used the money to try to gain her husband's freedom from the prison in Yuma. Mrs Downing eventually found herself alone and in need of money. She was hired to work in the home of A.F. Franklin in Tucson. On April 17, 1902, she was hired as a domestic servant by Tucson civic leader and entrepreneur John Ivancovich. A day later, shortly before her husband's release from prison, she was found dead in the servant's quarters. A coroner's jury determined that she had died of heart failure and attributed it to worry and nervousness brought on by the conviction and sentence of her husband. Mrs. Downing was buried in the Old City Cemetery in Willcox a.k.a. Willcox Pioneer Cemetery. Downing served a total of seven years in prison and was finally released for good behavior. According to Thomas H. Rynning, the Yuma prison warden, Downing had been a model prisoner. Downing's last stand An alley in WillcoxThe Old City Cemetery where Bill Downing and his wife are buried Downing returned to Willcox upon his release from prison and opened a saloon which he named the Free and Easy Saloon on the corner of Maley Street. Willcox at the time had an ordinance which forbid gambling, prostitution and the serving of alcohol to women. Downing was known as a one to defy the law and he hired prostitutes who were highly skilled pickpockets. Constable Bud Snow and Ranger Speed arrested Downing for serving women at the Free and Easy. Downing had encountered Arizona Ranger William Slaughter ‚ÄúBilly‚Äù Speed before. Speed was among the jurors who acquitted Downing in the 1899, killing of William S. ‚ÄúSlim‚Äù Traynor. Despite that they became bitter enemies. Downing pleaded guilty and paid a fifty dollar fine. The very next day he was arrested again, this time he was charged with assaulting a barber. Again he pleaded guilty and paid a fine of ten dollars. The citizen's of Willcox became tired of Downing's defiance of the law and sent a citizens petition to Harry C. Wheeler, the Captain of the Arizona Rangers, requesting protection from the ‚Äúdrunk and unruly‚Äù saloon-keeper. Wheeler received word that Downing had threaten to kill any officer who interfered with him. Thus, Wheeler ordered his men to kill Downing without any hesitation. Downing had some problems with Cuco Leal, a prostitute who lived in his saloon. He went to the office of Constable Snow to complain and to ask the she be removed from his saloon. At the same time he also warned that if Ranger Speed ever stuck his head inside of the door of his saloon, he would shoot it off. He also stated that he will kill Speed when the time is right. The following day a saloon customer complained that someone had stolen some of his money. Downing jumped to the conclusion that it was Cuco Leal. He confronted and beat her. She then ran into the Ranchman's Corral Saloon, whose owner was George McKittrick, a rival of Downing. McKittrick told Leal to stay in his saloon and to stay clear of the \\"Free and Easy\\" saloon. McKittrick then went to town Justice Page and told him about the Downing-Leal situation. Page issued a warrant for Downing's arrest and handed the warrant to Constable Bud Snow. The constable went to Ranger Speed's house and asked him to join him in presenting the warrant. Speed agreed and recommended that they act in the following morning. The following morning Downing was in his saloon drinking whiskey. He decided that he would show up in Judge Page's office to discuss the Leal situation. He got up to go and at the same time left his gun behind. When he stepped out the door he noticed that Constable Snow was heading towards the saloon and he ran back inside. He did not notice that Ranger Speed was accompanying the constable. Once they reached the saloon, Constable Snow told Speed to guard the back door of the saloon which was located by an alley. Ranger Speed loaded his .30-40 Winchester and headed towards the alley door. Downing thought that the constable would come in through the front door and decided to leave the saloon through the back exit. When he went out to the alley he came face-to-face with Ranger Speed. The Ranger ordered him to surrender but, Downing made a gesture as if he was reaching for his gun, forgetting that he had left his weapon in the saloon. The Ranger then raised his Winchester and fired. The bullet from Speed's rifle entered through his right breast, punctured his right lung and exited beneath his right shoulder blade. Downing died immediately. Arizona Ranger Captain Wheeler made the following remark to the community's reaction to Downing's demise: ‚ÄúThis is the first time I have known a dead man to be without a single friend and the first time that I have known a killing to meet absolute general rejoicing in all this town and precinct.‚Äù Downing was buried in an unmarked grave in the Old City Cemetery of Willcox a.k.a. Willcox Pioneer Cemetery. The coroner's jury found that the shot fired by Ranger Speed was in the performance of his duty as an officer and that he was perfectly justified in the act, and, therefore, he was exonerated from all blame in the matter.

So, James McFadden need a Wharf built out into the bay. With San Pedro port open his port did even poorer. James McFadden asked the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers for help in 1887. They told him it would talked $1.2 million to improve the port, and rejected the request. In 1888 the McFadden brothers built their own wharf. The wharf was 1320 feet long and 60 feet wide. In 1891 they built the Santa Ana and Newport Railway railroad line from the wharf to the Santa Ana Depot, 11 miles long. A small town call Newport Landing was built near the Wharf. McFadden brothers had 100 employees and the shipping company was at last profitable. In 1896 they purchased more land in what is now Newport Beach. But port of San Pedro was bigger and closer to Los Angeles and shipping decreased. In 1899 James McFadden sold the wharf and railroad line to the Southern Pacific Transportation Company. The rail line closed in 1907. In 1902, James sold the town of Newport Landing, half the Balboa Peninsula, and surrounding swamp lands to Williams S. Collins and C. A. Hanson. Collins, President of the Associated Oil Company, saw the town as a place to make a sea resort, not a shipping port. The team made Henry E. Huntington a partner in the Newport Beach development. In 1905, the Pacific Electric street cars ran to Newport, in 1906, the line continued to Balboa Peninsula and Balboa Pavilion. In 1939 the old McFadden Wharf was removed after being damaged by a large storm in 1928. In 1940 the current Newport Municipal Pier was built. Old Landing The place of Old Landing at San Joaquin Bay was designated a California Historic Landmark (No.198) on June 20, 1935. A marker is at the spot that Newport Bay was opened to trade. Captain Samuel S. Dunnells and William A. Abbott opened the port for trade on September 10, 1870. The first ship to enter the bay was the 105-ton, flat-bottomed Sternwheel steamer SS Vaquero with cargo of l5,000 shingles and 5,000 feet of lumber from San Diego. Samuel S. Dunnells built a small Wharf called the Newport Landing. Newport Landing and Landing warehouse was near the current Pacific Coast Highway and the Newport Bay Bridge. James McFadden and Robert McFadden purchased land and ran the port from April 19, 1875 till 1899, McFadden built a long Wharf that opened in 1889. The landing was renamed Newport. The port and farm land around the port was owned by: James Irvine, Benjamin Flint, james McFadden, and Robert McFadden.  Markers Marker at the McFadden Wharf site reads: *'The original wharf at this site was completed in the winter of 1888‚Äì89 and was connected by railroad with the hinterland in the winter of 1890‚Äì91.

One of several estates that was established when Antvorskov Cavalry District was sold in public auction. it was established by General Hans Henrik von Eickstedt in 1783 and later owned by the Castenschiold/Grevenkop-Castenschiolds family from 1786 to 1995. The Neoclassical main building from the 1780s was probably designed by Andreas Kirkerup. It was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1918. History =Origins= In 1568, Sor√∏ Abbey sold thefarm Landbytorp and the village of Davidsr√∏d to Jens Hiort. In 1586, Landbytorp and Davidsr√∏ were both incorporated in the fief of Antvorskov. In 1673, Landbytorp was disjoined from the fief as a large farm owned by Povl Nielsen. His widow stayed on the farm after her husband's death but in 1691 sold it to Bertel Pedersen. In 1719, Landbytorp was again acquired by the crown and incorporated in the new Antvorskov Cavalry District. =Hans Henrik von Eickstedt= Hans Henrik von Eickstedt Antvorskov Cavalry District existed until 1774. The land was then divided into estates and sold in public auction. Landbytorp was acquired by Hans Larsen Fogh and Davidsr√∏d went to Christian Sveistrup. In 1783, Landbytorp and Davidsr√∏d were both acquired by Hans Henrik von Eickstedt who, back in 1772, had been involved in the revolt against Johann Friedrich Struensee, He merged the land into a single manor under the name Store Frederikslund. The name was a tribute to Crown Prince Frederick, the later Frederick VI. Von Eickstedt constructed a main building on his estate as well as a farm which was given the name Lille Frederikslund. After the coup d'√©tat in 1884, in which Crown Prince Frederick forced Ove H√∏egh-Guldberg to resign, von Eickstedt was also dismissed from all his offices. In compensation, he was granted the title chamberlain as well as a considerable pension. =1786-1995: Grevencop/-Castenschiold= Store Frederikslund by Ferdinand Richardt, 1861 In 1786, he sold Store Frederikslund to J√∏rgen Frederik Castenskiold. He was the second'eldest son of Johan Lorentz Castenschiold and the brother of Carl Adolph Castenschiold (1740‚Äì1820) and Joachim Castenschiold (1743‚Äì1817). He was already the owner of two other estates, H√∏rbygaard at Holb√¶k and Valbyg√•rd at Slagelse, but sold Valbygaard to Poul Christian von Stemann in 1805. He was married to Johanne Vilhelmine Grevencop and the couple had 13 children of which many died in an early age. J√∏rgen Grevenkop-Castenskiold J√∏rgen Frederik Castenschiold died at Store Frederikslund in 1819. He had in 1813 ceded the ownership of Store Frederikslund and H√∏rbygaard to his eldest surviving son, Caspar Holten Castenschiold, who on 5 May 1826, was granted royal permission to assume the name Grevencop-Castenschiold. Caspar Holten Castenschiold had in 1825 become the owner of his third estate when he purchased Hagestedgaard from a cousin. Caspar Holten Grevencop-Castenschiold's estates were after his death divided between his three surviving sons. Store Frederikslund passed to his eldest son, J√∏rgen Frederik Grevenkop-Castenbskiold, who owned it until 1874, He converted most of the copyholds to freeholds. He also improved the management of the estate and refurbished the home farm. In 1929, J√∏rgen Adolph Grevenkop-Castenskiold sold Lille Frederikslund to Viggo de Neergaard. In 1935, he ceded Store Frederikslund to his son Erik Wilhelm Grevenkop- Castenskiold. =1995-preseent: Later history= In 1995, Store Frederikslund was sold to founder of IC Group Klaus Helmersen. In 2012, he sold the estate for around DKK 200 million. Architecture A rendering by Andreas Kirkerup from 1783 Plan drawing, 1783 The Neoclassical main building dates from the 1780s and was probably designed by Andreas Kirkerup. It is part of a large, rectangular complex surrounding a cental courtyard. The two side wings have median risalits on both sides. The median risalits towards the garden feature four Tuscan order pilsters and are topped by triangular pediments. The main building was listed on the Danish registry of protected buildings and places in 1918.

Poor health brought about his return to Spain. In 1721 he left for Mexico, but pastoral duties brought him to the Philippines again in 1723 or 1725. Between 1726 and 1736 he was the teacher (doctrinero) and minister of the village of Los Ba√±os de Aguas Santas. In 1736 he went to Mexico, preparing to return to Spain on account of his health. Instead he stayed to succeed the recently deceased president of the convent of San Agust√≠n de las Cuevas. He died in his post in Mexico in 1747. Oyanguren was familiar with a large number of typologically divergent languages. Besides his native Basque, he also acquired Spanish (in which he published), Greek, Hebrew and Latin in Europe. In the Philippines, he learned besides Tagalog and Japanese, also Chinese, Vietnamese and Malay. He also learned Nahuatl in Mexico. He was one of the first linguists to distinguish suffixation from inflection. He provides unique comparisons between agglutinative languages like Basque and Japanese and an isolating language like Chinese. Oyanguren's descriptive grammars, Arte de la lengua japona (1738) and Tagalysmo elucidado y reducido (1742), both published in Mexico, were not well received at the time of publication. Copies of the first were very rare, but a modern edition has been printed (2009). Tagalysmo was his second Tagalog grammar. His first was published in Latin in 1723. Since it was not well received, he rewrote it in Spanish. Oyanguren also wrote two grammars of Basque, both now lost: Arte de la lengua Vascongada (date unknown) and El Cantabrismo elucidado (1715). His trilingual dictionary of Basque, Spanish and Tagalog is also thought to be lost. Works *Melchor Oyanguren de Santa In√©s, Otto Zwartjes (ed.). Arte de la lengua japona (1738).

This theory is prominent in the field of interpersonal communication. The theory is a model for how individuals gain compliance from others. There can be multiple goals related to the need for compliance. These goals are separated into primary and secondary categories. These goals are then translated into plans, both strategic and tactical, and finally carried out in actions. The Goals, Plans, Action theory has shown application in academic and personal relationships.  Background  The Goals, Plans, Action theory was first drafted by James Price Dillard in 1990 in his book Seeking Compliance: The Production of Interpersonal Influence Messages. Since then, several amendments to the theory have been made by Dillard and other communications scholars.  Assumptions  The Goals, Plans, Action theory makes the following assumptions: individuals are predictable, goals are based on deeper values, and their behavior is intentional. As a practical theory, the Goals, Plans, Action theory assumes that the world is knowable. Individuals will follow certain objective cognitive processes that result in their behavior. In addition, goals are the tangible product of values. The individual's attitude, beliefs, and cultural background inform their goals. Finally, individuals are deliberate in their actions: the greater the desire to accomplish their objective, the harder they will work.  Concepts  The Goals, Plans, Action theory includes the following concepts: the individual has at least one of seven primary goals along with one of five secondary goals, and plans are both thoughtful and actionable. = Primary goals = There are seven primary goals that drive plans, and ultimately lead to action. These goals are defined as primary because they are found at the beginning of the goal attainment process. They are also referred to as influence goals as they are the key ways an individual might impact another person. The primary goals are: gain assistance, give advice, share activity, change orientation, change relationship, obtain permission, and enforce rights and obligations. With each of the goals, the individual is intending to provide or obtain something to further their relationship with the other person. = Secondary goals = Secondary goals are derivative of primary goals: without a primary goal, no secondary goals exist. Secondary goals directly apply to the actions of the individual in the Goals, Plans, Action model. There are five secondary goals: identity, conversation management, relational resource, personal resource, and affect management. Identity goals are based on the individual's self-concept. Conversation management goals pertain to how the individual behaves around others. Relational resource goals depend on the individual's value of relationships. Personal resource goals focus on the physical and material well-being of the individual. Affect management goals pertain to managing emotions and feelings during a conversation. = Plans = Plans exist at two levels: strategic and tactical. Strategic plans indicate what should be accomplished. Tactical plans indicate how that will be done. The strategies are general while the tactics are specific. An example of a strategic plan might be to ask for help, while a tactical plan would be to list out your previous attempts and explain what you aren't able to do. = Action = In this theory, action can be taken through both verbal and non-verbal messages. There are four dimensions of actions: explicitness, dominance, argument, and control over outcomes. Explicitness refers to how clear the message is. The easier the message is to understand, the better the results are likely to be. Dominance refers to the amount of control the individual has over the other. The more power they have, the more likely they are to get what they want. Argument refers to the justification behind the message. The better the reasoning, the better the chances of accomplishing their goal(s). Control over outcomes refers to how much say the individual has in what happens next. The more jurisdiction they have, the more likely they are to see their intended results.  Explanations  The Goals, Plans, Action theory declares that individuals knowingly act in order to accomplish a certain outcome. The 'why' behind their behavior is known. Individuals may be acting upon multiple goals at a time, dependent on current circumstances. These goals, both primary and secondary, may conflict with one another, and may change over time. In a relationship, as the individual seeks to influence the other, they will look to familiar plans and actions first. If those plans and actions do not meet their needs, they will branch out.  Applications  = Academic relationships = The Goals, Plans, Action theory was applied to academics in Henningson et al.'s study of interactions between students and professors regarding disappointing grades. In the study, the primary goal is to ask for reconsideration of the score. Secondary goals included conversation management and relationship resource management. The students didn't want their professors to think worse of them because of the conversation, and wanted to maintain or improve their relationship with them. Planning was measured using questions about the students' strategy for their conversation with their professors. Through the study, Henningson et al. were able to prove the Goals, Plans, Action theory in the context of appealing a grade. The decision to appeal was based on thoughtful intentions, come to life through specific plans. However, the actual attempt of discussing the grade with the professor only occurred 16.8% of the time. = Personal relationships = The Goals, Plans, Action theory has also been applied to personal relationships. In a study analyzing voicemail messages after hypothetical problematic events in relationships, Samp and Solomon researched how the subjects came to their final message. The study determined that relational partners (both romantic and not) had specific intentions that drove their voicemail messages after a hypothetical problematic event. Primary goals identified in the study were to change orientation, change relationship, obtain permission, and enforce rights and obligations. Secondary goals included all five of those identified in the theory: identity, conversation management, relational resource, personal resource, and affect management. Through the study Samp and Solomon also found that goal features had a significant effect on the communication: more complex goals led more intricate, longer messages. Their conclusions help to understand how individuals gain compliance in relationships during difficult situations.  Critiques  Since the development of the theory, scholars have called into question its ability to explain human behavior. Gregory Shepherd argues that communication is not always driven by goals, but can be seen as a mere social interaction. He states that if it were, there could be no unplanned or purposeless actions. In response, Dillard and Schrader distinguish between action (purposeful) and other types of behavior (purposeless). Hairong Feng questions the simplicity of the theory, expressing that the framework is too vague for the complicated psychological activity involved in communication. However, she does find the idea of primary and secondary goals to be aligned with other theories.

Born in New York City, Rivol later moved to the West Coast; she was a resident of San Francisco in 1938. In that year she was commissioned by the Works Project Administration to create illustrations of rock art sites throughout the western United States. Her paintings and sketches, which depict Chumash and Yokuts petroglyphs and rock paintings, as well as those from other tribes, record the appearance of many sites prior to later vandalism. Many of the sites she visited were in California, but others were in Nevada and Arizona. She died in San Diego. Thirty works by Rivol are held by the National Gallery of Art, where they form part of the collection of the Index of American Design. A further fifteen are owned by the Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco; the state of Utah owns other pieces. Her sketches are held by the University of California, Berkeley.

Volunteering to serve disguised as a man under the pseudonym Khariton Korotkevich (), she soon gained a reputation as a fearless leader as a woman in her own right. She was killed by shellfire on the front line during the Siege of Port Arthur. Early life Haritina Verkhozina () was born of humble origins in the village of Nesterevaya in the Tobolsk Governorate, the daughter of peasants. She lost her mother at the age of six and, at the age of ten, left home to work, finding employment as a dishwasher at Vargashi station. It was there that she met Jakoff Korotkevich (), with whom she fell in love and soon after married. When her husband was called up at the start of the Russo-Japanese War, she initially remained at home, but soon afterwards decided to travel to Port Arthur to be with her husband, despite the perils that the journey held. She disguised herself as a man and worked as a brakeman on the Trans-Siberian Railway, travelling across the Chinese Eastern Railway to Harbin. Arriving in Dalian Bay, she met some soldiers attached to the same company as her husband and changed to women's clothes. Aiming to continue her journey, she was thwarted by the police who threatened to return her to Harbin. However, when she related her story with the officer responsible, he became sympathetic and together they hatched a plan for her to get the lines and be with her husband. She would enlist. Thus it was. As a contemporary source said, \\"she took the oath of fidelity, donned her uniform, shouldered her rifle and became a man amongst men, all for Jakoff's sake.\\" She was to become a Russian Joan of Arc for love. Service in the war right Adopting the masculine name Khariton, Korotkevich was initially not taken seriously, but soon proved to be an able fighter. Joining the 15th Regiment under Captain Gusakovsky, she was a charismatic leader, often leading her troop with courage and skill. In one bayonet charge, it is claimed she killed one Japanese soldier with her bayonet and wounded another with a bullet. She also showed compassion. A story is told of one time, while fighting, a Japanese soldier fell wounded beside her. She instantly dropped her rifle to care for him until the stretcher-bearers arrived. In addition, she also kept morale high among the troops, helping the men by mending clothes and, when she had leave, shopping for soap and tobacco for them. On , in fierce combat, Jakoff was wounded and Korotkevich accompanied him to a field hospital. She stayed with him for three weeks and only when he was out of immediate danger did she return to her unit. When she did so, she was appointed a messenger by Gusakovsky. In this capacity, she served bravely carrying critical instructions between the commander and the front line in conditions of huge risk to her life. It was during one of these missions that she tragically lost her life. Death and legacy On , the Japanese launched a massive offensive against the Russian troops. After the attack was repulsed, Gusakovsky drew up a list of requisitions, including a report of losses and a request for reserves and ammunition. He gave this to Korotkevich to take to regimental headquarters. Unfortunately, just as she was leaving the dugout, a shell fired by a Japanese howitzer landed on the emplacement. Korotkevich was killed instantly. Korotkevich was buried in a mass grave alongside eight others who died at the same time. On her grave was placed a wooden cross and the inscription, \\"Private Haritina Korotkevich, the bravest of Russian women, who fell fighting for her Czar and her country.\\" She was awarded the Cross of St. George, one of four women to be awarded the honour during the war and the only one posthumously.

Kanost (born 1956; Cheyenne, Wyoming) is a University Distinguished Professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biophysics at Kansas State University. Early life and education Kanost was born in 1956 in Cheyenne, Wyoming. His interest in general science started in grade school, in Cheyenne and continued in junior high and high school after his family moved to Broomfield, Colorado in 1968. In 1975 Kanost enrolled in Colorado State University from which he graduated in 1979 with a B.S. in zoology and entomology. In 1983 Kanost received his Ph.D. in entomology from Purdue University after being mentored by Peter Dunn there. While at Purdue, the duo studied pathogenic bacteria of Manduca sexta and how infections stimulate synthesis of hemolymph antibacterial proteins. Career Following the dissertation, Kanost became a postdoc in the Department of Biology at Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario. There he worked with Prof. G.R. Wyatt and helped him study protein synthesis stimulated by juvenile hormone and insect hemolymph proteins. In 1986, Kanost moved to the University of Arizona's Department of Biochemistry, where he worked with Prof. Michael Wells. From 1986 to 1991 Kanost was a Research Associate and later Research Assistant Professor at UA, studying lipophorin and serpins in insect hemolymph. In 1991, Kanost became Assistant Professor of Biochemistry at Kansas State University, and in 2005 he was promoted to University Distinguished Professor. He also served as head of the Department from 2002 to 2012. Research In 2005 Kanost was a member of a small research team that suggested that silencing the enzyme laccase-2 in a beetle prevents cuticle tanning, the process of hardening and pigmenting the insect's exoskeleton. The research suggests that understanding the exoskeleton's chemistry may also lead to development of new strategies for pest control or for development of lightweight and strong materials. In 2016, he led an effort to sequence and annotate the Manduca sexta genome. Personal life Since 1977, Michael Kanost is married to Jill, and is a father to four children. When he is not at his desk studying insects, Kanost is playing the cello with the Salina (Kansas) Symphony and growing tomatoes.
