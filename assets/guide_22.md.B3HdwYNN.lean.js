It was directed by Dallas Hallam and Patrick Horvath and was written by Hallam, Horvath, Karen Gorham, and Michelle Margolis. Suziey Block stars as a barista who lives a repetitive and anxious life in Los Angeles. When her beloved dog disappears, she decides to give up and move back home, but first she invites all her friends to a going-away party.  Plot  Suziey, a young barista, lives in Los Angeles with her roommate Karen. Suziey's life has become repetitive, empty, and full of anxiety. She feels threatened by passers-by when she walks down the street, and a car following her movements causes her to panic. The sudden disappearance of her beloved dog pushes her to the breaking point, and she recruits Karen to help her search for him. Unable to find him, she posts notices around the neighborhood, but they are to no avail. Depressed and longing for a more fulfilling life, like that of her roommate, she agrees to hook up with a friend at a bar. During the night, an unrevealed person takes a picture of her as she sleeps, and her friend makes an empty apology as he sneaks out the door in the morning. When Karen returns from a fun vacation with her boyfriend, Suziey tells Karen that she's been unhappy for a long time and wishes to move back home. Karen convinces Suziey to first hold a dinner party, and they invite all their friends, including Josh and Liesel, Suziey's friends from back home; Morgan, Karen's boyfriend; and Jonathan, Karen's co- worker. At the party, Suziey becomes uneasy due to the awkward attention of Jonathan, though Suziey dismisses Jonathan's concerns when he asks her if she's uncomfortable with his presence. After talking and drinking champagne throughout the night, the drunk revelers are interrupted by a power outage. The power briefly comes back on, only to flicker off again. Suziey goes to investigate and is quickly incapacitated by a masked man. When she regains consciousness, the masked man tells Suziey that he has been stalking her for a while, understands her pain, and says that they have something special, even though they do not love each other. He then states that he is going to kill all of her friends so that they can be alone together. In a nearly unbroken 20-minute shot, Suziey, who has been bound, stumbles through the house and discovers the grisly fate of each of her friends. After unsuccessfully trying several avenues of escape, she crawls through a pet door and ends up on her porch, a dead end. Cornered, she surrenders to her stalker, who cradles her head and comforts her as he forces her to share the view of the city with him.  Cast  * Suziey Block as Suziey * Joshua Grote as Josh * Karen Gorham as Karen * Liesel Kopp as Liesel * Jonathan Margolis as Jonathan * Bennet Jones as Bennet * Florence Hartigan as Jennifer  Themes  In an interview with Bloody Disgusting, co-directors Dallas Hallam and Patrick Horvath stated that horror is about amplification of common issues, which makes themes and metaphors easy to film. The protagonist, Suziey, experiences an amplification of all her problems in the climax. The Dardenne brothers were a direct influence on Hallam and Horvath, and they attempted to blend that influence with mumblecore while introducing consequences through a horror element. The events of the first hour are designed to be ambiguous; whether Suziey is paranoid or not is not answered by the film, and only her perceptions and reactions are shown. Psychological thrillers from Dario Argento and Roman Polanski influenced the display of Suziey's mental state. Isolation and vulnerability in the big city, especially from a female perspective, were major themes. The filmmakers say that they did not initially realize that the themes were focused on female issues and perspectives.  Production  Hallam and Horvath had previously collaborated on Die-ner (Get It?). The house in which they shot belongs to Karen Gorham; Dallas Hallam and his wife live in the basement. For the long shot at the end, they rehearsed for a week and performed three takes. Suziey Block was actually bound for her performance, as she found it distracting to accidentally become free of her bonds. The film was shot in twelve days, split into two six-day weeks. The film's initial budget of $6000 necessitated certain restrictions, such as Suziey Block's character working at the same job as the actress, a barista. The idea to make a slasher film came from a failed project that Hallam had worked on; after successfully pitching the idea of a slasher to Horvath, the filmmakers decided to combine this idea with their love of European art films.  Release  Entrance premiered at the Los Angeles Film Festival on June 24, 2011. It was picked up for distribution by IFC Midnight and received both a limited theatrical release and video on demand premiere on May 18, 2012.  Reception  Heather Wixson of Dread Central rated the film 3.5/5 stars and called Entrance \\"a fascinating character study.\\" Though she says that the film is not for everyone, she recommended it to fans of unconventional horror films and slow burn storytelling. Brad McHargue, also of Dread Central, rated the film 1/5 stars and wrote that the first hour is plodding and lacks character development, which fails to give the violent conclusion weight. Robert Koehler of Variety called the film \\"a textbook example of a movie that betrays its audience\\" because it \\"impulsively devolves into a manipulative slasher pic.\\" Bloody Disgusting rated the film 3.5/5 and called the film \\"pretty great flick\\" on a technical level while criticizing the storytelling. In a positive review, Scott Weinberg of Fearnet stated that the shocking climax makes waiting through the sparse character study worthwhile. Weinberg described the film as \\"not the most exciting or eventful indie horror flick\\" but called it \\"novel\\" and compared it to Ti West's filmography. Writing in Entertainment Weekly, Stephen King wrote that he \\"was really astounded by how much the filmmakers (Dallas Hallam and Patrick Horvath) did with so little\\". Terek Puckett of Shock Till You Drop stated that the first hour, intended to be character-driven and tense, fails to establish any interesting characters and is \\"quite frankly very dull\\". He described the closing shot as \\"memorable and disturbing\\", but the film itself \\"comes off as a short film that's been padded out to feature length.\\" Mark L. Miller of Ain't It Cool News wrote that the film requires patience but is a \\"horrifying experience\\" that \\"plays with the ultimate fear of being alone and twists it to the most terrifying of lengths.\\" A. A. Dowd of Time Out Chicago rated the film 2/5 stars and criticized the film as another mumblecore production fixated on the existential angst of young, white, middle class protagonists.

The thirteenth typhoon of the 2013 Pacific typhoon season, Haiyan originated from an area of low pressure several hundred kilometers east-southeast of Pohnpei in the Federated States of Micronesia on November 2\\\\. Tracking generally westward, environmental conditions favored tropical cyclogenesis and the system developed into a tropical depression the following day. After becoming a tropical storm and attaining the name Haiyan at 0000 UTC on November 4, the system began a period of rapid intensification that brought it to typhoon intensity by 1800 UTC on November 5\\\\. By November 6, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) assessed the system as a Category 5-equivalent super typhoon on the Saffir-Simpson hurricane wind scale; the storm passed over the island of Kayangel in Palau shortly after attaining this strength. Thereafter, it continued to intensify; at 1200 UTC on November 7, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) upgraded the storm's maximum ten-minute sustained winds to , the highest in relation to the cyclone. At 1800 UTC, the JTWC estimated the system's one-minute sustained winds to , unofficially making Haiyan the fourth most intense tropical cyclone ever observed. Several hours later, the eye of the cyclone made its first landfall in the Philippines at Guiuan, Eastern Samar, with an intensity of if verified, this would make Haiyan the strongest tropical cyclone to make a landfall on record, tied with Typhoon Meranti in 2016. Gradually weakening, the storm made five additional landfalls in the country before emerging over the South China Sea. Turning northwestward, the typhoon eventually struck northern Vietnam as a severe tropical storm on November 10\\\\. Haiyan was last noted as a tropical depression by the JMA the following day. Origins and intensification Haiyan becoming organized as a tropical depression on November 3 On November 2, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) began monitoring a broad low-pressure area about 425 km (265 mi) east-southeast of Pohnpei, one of the states in the Federated States of Micronesia. The system featured broken banding features alongside steadily consolidating convection. Environmental conditions ahead of the disturbance favored tropical cyclogenesis and dynamic weather forecast models predicted that a well-defined tropical cyclone would form within 72 hours. Early on November 3, the Japan Meteorological Agency (JMA) classified the system as a tropical depression. Owing to a consolidating low-level circulation center with building deep convection, the JTWC also classified the system as a tropical depression, shortly after issuing a Tropical Cyclone Formation Alert. Subsequent intensification resulted in the JMA upgrading the system to a tropical storm and assigning it the name Haiyan () at 0000 UTC on November 4. Meanwhile, the JTWC also upgraded it to a tropical storm, when the expansive system was steadily consolidating in an area of weak to moderate vertical wind shear and tracking westward along the southern periphery of a subtropical ridge. By November 5, the storm began to undergo rapid intensification as a prominent central dense overcast (CDO) with an embedded eye began developing. This intensification was fueled by high sea surface temperatures, estimated at which extended to an unusually great depth. At below the surface, temperatures were 4 to 5 ¬∞C (7 to 9 ¬∞F) above average. In light of the formation of an eye, the JTWC estimated Haiyan to have achieved typhoon status around 0000 UTC that day. The JMA followed suit 12 hours later, by which time the JTWC estimated one-minute sustained winds to have reached . A small typhoon, with a core roughly 110 km (70 mi) across, rapid intensification continued through November 6 as an 11 km (7 mi) wide pin-hole eye formed. Upper-level outflow favored further strengthening of the system and was further enhanced by a Tropical Upper Tropospheric Trough to the northeast. Intense banding features along the southern periphery of Haiyan wrapped into the system as well. Early on November 6, the JTWC estimated the system to have achieved super typhoon status. That day, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration (PAGASA) assigned the storm the local name Yolanda as it approached their area of responsibility. Intensification slowed somewhat during the day, though the JTWC estimated the storm to have attained Category 5-equivalent status on the Saffir‚ÄìSimpson hurricane wind scale around 1200 UTC. At this time, Haiyan displayed a 15 km (9 mi) wide eye surrounded by a ring of deep convection. Later, the eye of the typhoon passed over the island of Kayangel in Palau. Development continued throughout November 7, and at times, mesovortices were apparent in the typhoon's eye. Peak intensity Typhoon Haiyan at peak intensity on November 7 Around 1200 UTC on November 7, Haiyan attained its peak intensity with ten-minute sustained winds of and a barometric pressure of 895 mbar (hPa; 26.43 inHg). This made it the second- most intense tropical cyclone in the Northwest Pacific Ocean on record, based on wind speeds alone, along with Bess in 1982 and Megi in 2010, only after Tip in 1979. Six hours later, the JTWC estimated Haiyan to have attained one- minute sustained winds of and gusts up to . This officially ties Haiyan with Typhoon Meranti in 2016 as the fifth-strongest tropical cyclone on record in terms of wind speed, only exceeded by Typhoon Ida (325 km/h) in 1958, Typhoon Violet (335 km/h) in 1961, Typhoon Nancy (345 km/h) in 1961 and Hurricane Patricia (345 km/h) in 2015. However, due to the fact the wind recordings in typhoons were erroneously high during the 1950s and 1960s, it can be said that Haiyan made its way as the second strongest tropical cyclone on record, second only to Hurricane Patricia in 2015. (It is important to note, however, that Patricia's winds were directly measured by Hurricane Hunters aircraft, observations which were not available for Haiyan, so the record is uncertain and comparing the intensities of the two storms is problematic.) The storm displayed some characteristics of an annular tropical cyclone, though a strong convective band remained present along the western side of the system. Satellite estimates at the time, using the Dvorak technique, reached the maximum level on the scale: T#8.0. The storm's structure exceeded the maximum intensity on the scale as the \\"Dvorak technique makes no allowance for an eye embedded so deeply in cloud tops as cold as [cold dark gray],\\" as noted by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) satellite analysis branch. Cloud tops surrounding the eye averaged , with some areas even deeper. Some automated models initialized its intensity at T#8.1, exceeding the scale's upper bounds. Through satellite estimates, NOAA also estimated that Haiyan may have achieved a minimum pressure as low as 858 mbar (hPa; 25.34 inHg). This would have possibly made Haiyan the strongest tropical cyclone worldwide, however due to lack of hurricane hunters in the West Pacific, this is hard to verify, so Typhoon Tip of 1979 holds the record.  Philippine landfalls  PAGASA alt=Cebu City doppler radar loop from November 8, 2013 At 2040 UTC on November 7, Typhoon Haiyan made landfall in Guiuan, Eastern Samar slightly past peak intensity with sustained winds. Upon doing so, it became one of the strongest landfalling tropical cyclones on record. In terms of one- minute sustained winds from the JTWC, Haiyan was the most powerful storm to strike land on record, later tied with Typhoon Meranti in 2016. The mountainous terrain of the Philippines disrupted the cyclone's low-level inflow, slightly degrading the storm's structure, prompting slow weakening. Radar data indicates that at 2108 UTC, the northern eye was over the village of Guiuan. Around this time, the dome of the Guiuan radar station was blown into the sea. The storm crossed into the Leyte Gulf shortly thereafter. At 2300 UTC, the storm made another landfall on the island of Leyte. The northern eyewall, the most powerful part of the storm, hit Tacloban City. Despite continued land interaction, the storm remained exceptionally powerful as it hit Leyte. Shortly after the storm moved onshore, around 2320 UTC, a barometer deployed by storm chasers in Tacloban City ( north of the center of circulation) measured a pressure of 960.3 mbar (hPa; 28.36 inHg). At 2315 UTC, a barometer at Tacloban Airport about 1.6 km (1 mi) south of the chasers measured a pressure of 955.6 mb (hPa; 28.22 inHg). Based on the gradient between these positions, Dr. Jeff Masters of Weather Underground estimated that Haiyan may have had a central pressure of 888 mb (hPa; 26.23 inHg) when it struck Leyte. As Haiyan moved further into Leyte, it reached the Nacolod mountain range. As the core traversed the Nacolod, its 1500 m peaks significantly disrupted the storm's low- and mid-level circulation. This caused the northern half of Haiyan's central core to collapse. Convection shallowed somewhat, and the eye shrank from 20 nm to under 10 nm, also becoming cloud-filled. Despite this synoptic weakening, the shrinking eye kept windspeeds high due to conservation of angular momentum. At 0006 UTC, the eye crosses the Nacolod and hits Ormoc City, still at category 5 strength. Haiyan then crossed another mountain range to the west of Ormoc before emerging over the Cebu Strait. Marked orographic enhancement over this terrain is evident on radar imagery. During Haiyan's passage over the Cebu Strait, the core reorganized somewhat. At 0133 UTC, the eyewall began to hit the island of Cebu, at Daanbantayan. This is the Cebu City radar station's last scan before it is disabled by the storm. After crossing the mountains, Haiyan made another landfall on Bantayan Island at 0240 UTC, then quickly emerging over the Visayan sea. At 0400 UTC, the storm makes another landfall at Conception, Iloilo. The storm weakens to category 4 strength shortly thereafter. After its lengthiest land crossing yet, Haiyan emerges over the Mindoro Strait. At 1200 UTC, the storm makes its last Philippine landfall at Coron, Palawan as a strong category 4 storm. Haiyan emerged over the South China Sea late on November 8\\\\. The storm's core had been substantially disrupted during its passage through the Philippines, with only a partial eyewall remaining intact around a ragged cloud-filled eye. In contrast to the appearance, the JTWC estimated it to have retained winds of at this time. Similarly the PAGASA maintained its strength as while the JMA estimated winds at . South China Sea and dissipation Typhoon Haiyan near central Vietnam and Hainan on November 10 By November 9, some structural reorganization took place with banding features wrapping tightly around a developing eye. Environmental conditions ahead of the storm soon became less favorable, as cool stable air began wrapping into the western side of the circulation. This resulted in shallowing convecting over the center. Continuing across the South China Sea, Haiyan turned more northwesterly late on November 9 and through November 10 as it moved around the southwestern edge of the subtropical ridge previously steering it westward. Throughout November 10, interaction with Hainan Island and Vietnam further weakened the storm as it moved over the Gulf of Tonkin. Rapid weakening ensued as Haiyan approached its final landfall in Vietnam, with increasing wind shear displacing convection to the north of the center of circulation. The storm had also turned more northerly by this point as the subtropical ridge began to erode. Around 2100 UTC, Haiyan made landfall in Haiphong as a severe tropical storm with ten-minute sustained winds of . Once onshore, Haiyan turned more easterly as the mid-latitude westerlies became the primary steering factor. By 1200 UTC on November 11, Haiyan had dissipated as a tropical cyclone, as it moved over Guangxi Province, China.

Biography His father, Edward Kingman, moved from Newton, Connecticut, in the United States to coastal Cant√≥n Portovelo in El Oro Province, Ecuador, while working for the \\"South America Development Company\\". Edward Kingman worked in the mines of Zaruma and was the second person to have an automobile in Quito (the first was Juan Isaac Navarro). Kingman was the younger brother of the renowned painter Eduardo Kingman. Kingman married Gloria Garc√©s. Kingman completed his secondary studies at the Colegio Vicente Rocafuerte of Guayaquil. He has served as a deputy in the Constituent Assembly of 1944, and then in the National Congress of 1948 and 1956 during the presidency of Carlos Julio Arosemena Monroy. He was the General Inspectorate of Ecuador between 1961-1963; the vice director of the Housing Bank between 1964-1968; director of the newspaper La Hora since 1985. He was a founding member of Writers and Artists Union, member of the House of Ecuadorian Culture, and a member of the editorial board of the Library of the Central Bank of Ecuador.

He primarily played as a wing or fullback, but also covered fly-half and centre. Lawler spent most of his professional career with Munster, playing in the Celtic League and Heineken Cup, and also played three games on a trial period for English Premiership side London Wasps in 2008. After leaving the professional game, he continued to play at amateur level in Ireland for Shannon and UL Bohemians, retiring fully in 2015. Lawler currently works as an Elite Player Development Officer for the Connacht Academy, with a focus on developing the backs. He also serves as head coach of the province's under-20 side and the second tier team, the Connacht Eagles. Early life Lawler grew up in Limerick. His father Pat died while playing rugby when Lawler was just three years old. His father had played for UL Bohemians from the mid-1960s to the mid-1970s, and Lawler started out in rugby with the same club. Lawler went to secondary school in Ardscoil R√≠s in the city, and played rugby for the school team. He was part of the first team from the school to reach the final of the Munster Senior Cup, where they were beaten by Cork Presentation. After leaving secondary school, Lawler went on to study at Limerick IT, completing a Construction Studies course. Playing career=Early career with Shannon Having played at youth level with UL Bohemians, Lawler moved to cross-city rivals Shannon at the age of 18, having been convinced to move by his cousin, Colm Tucker. He made his debut in the All-Ireland League for the club at that age, and played for them while studying in Limerick IT. Lawler was given a professional contract with Munster the summer after he finished his college course. Lawler remained associated with Shannon throughout his time with the province, playing for the side occasionally when available. Munster Lawler made his competitive debut for Munster on 11 September 2001, in a game against Welsh side Caerphilly. Munster reached the Heineken Cup final in his first season with the side, but he didn't feature in the competition. Lawler did however play the following season, featuring in the \\"Miracle Match\\" against Gloucester. Munster needed to win by 27 points, with four clear tries between the sides, to qualify from the pool stages of the 2002‚Äì03 Heineken Cup. Lawler started on the wing and scored a try as Munster won 33‚Äì6 in front of a delirious Thomond Park. Lawler was part of the squad that won the province's first Heineken Cup in 2006. He had played for the team in the pool stages, but missed the quarter-final through injury and never regained his place in the team. In the 2006‚Äì07 season Lawler's playing time was limited, as he made ten Celtic League appearances, six of them coming as a replacement and didn't feature in Europe. He then missed the entirety of the 2007‚Äì08 season through injury, as Munster won their second Heineken Cup. Lawler's contract wasn't renewed at the end of the season. He had made 50 Celtic League appearances, played in 15 Heineken Cup games, made a single appearance in the short lived Celtic Cup competition and played in a friendly match against the during his time with the team, scoring a total of 94 points. Wasps Having left Munster at the end of the 2007‚Äì08 season, Lawler was without a club. In October 2008, English Premiership team London Wasps invited him to join the club on a three-month contract. His fellow Munster natives Jeremy Staunton, Eoin Reddan and Damien Varley were playing with the team at the time. After making two appearances in the Premiership for the side, Lawler tore his groin in a game against Sale Sharks, which brought his time with Wasps to an end. Return to amateur rugby After his disappointment with Wasps, Lawler gave up on a professional career, instead rejoining Shannon for the 2009‚Äì10 season, and he played for the side for three seasons. At the end of the 2011‚Äì12 season, he opted to rejoin UL Bohemians, the club where he had first played in his youth. Again Lawler's cousin Colm Tucker, who had first persuaded him to join Shannon in the 1990s, was key to the switch. Lawler joined Bohemians as a player, but also served as the club's Director of Rugby, with a focus on developing the club's academy. This added coaching role was key in his decision to move. Lawler retired from playing at the end of the 2014‚Äì15 campaign, having played at senior level for 17 seasons.

She deliberately chose the option 'public', so that her friends could bring other friends. This way, the girl hoped to obtain a head count. One of her friends' friends misused the invitation and invited 500 people himself. Through the notorious snowball effect thousands of people were added to that number in a matter of days. In just two days, 16,000 people were invited. The girl then deleted the event after consulting her parents. However, others took command and quickly Twitter and Facebook were filled with terms like Project X Merthe (the name of the girl), Project X Stationsweg (the street where she lived), and Project X Haren.Feestje Merthe werd 'gekaapt', AD.nl, 8 maart 2013 Project X is a reference to the 2012 film Project X, directed by Nima Nourizadeh.

The notes that he made were published after his death as The Countries and Tribes of the Persian Gulf. Early years Samuel Barrett Miles was born on 2 October 1838, the son of Major-General Miles. His father was in the military service of the East India Company. Miles was educated at Harrow. He joined the British Indian Army in 1857, the year of the Indian Mutiny. He entered the 7th Regiment of Bombay Native Infantry as an ensign, was promoted to lieutenant in 1860 and became regimental quarter-master in 1864. In November 1866 he moved with his regiment to Aden. The next year he was appointed Cantonment Magistrate and Assistant Resident at Aden.

She is the inspiration for the character of Teuta Shkreli in Ismail Kadare's 1985 novel The Wedding Procession Turned to Ice (). Biography She was born Sehadete Doko on 16 October 1928 in Ochrid, Kingdom of Yugoslavia (now in North Macedonia). She pursued secondary studies in 1947 in her native city and then studied medicine in the Ss. Cyril and Methodius University of Skopje, graduating on 7 January 1954. On 1 April 1954, she started to work in the Hospital of Pristina as a gynecologist and obstetrician. Mekuli specialized in gynecology in March 1960 in Belgrade. From 1960 until 1962 she was the Chief of the Gynecology and Obstetrics Pavilion of the Pristina Hospital. In 1963, for political reasons, she left the hospital and became Chief of the Dispensary (a public dispensary), within the House of Health of Pristina. In January 1968, she returned to her position as Chief of the Gynecology and Obstetrics Pavilion in the Pristina Hospital. She also developed a lecture series for schools and dormitories to improve the health education of girls. After the opening of the University of Pristina, Mekuli was elected primarius of the School of Medicine which opened in 1970. She earned her doctorate at the University of Belgrade in 1973 and became an associate professor at the University of Pristina in 1976. Mekuli participated in the founding of the Association of Kosovo's Physicians and directed the publishing of Praxis medica, a medicine journal. Beginning in 1972, she was director of the Gynecology Clinic within the School of Medicine of the University of Pristina. Mekuli published 31 articles in medical journals. 1981 protests in Kosovo In 1981 Mekuli tended to the Albanian students injured by the police during the 1981 protests in Kosovo, when the Albanians were demanding more autonomy within Yugoslavia. She was accused of \\"showing too much zeal\\" in treating the wounded (note 16) and siding with the students in their demands as well. Because of her actions, the University of Pristina refused to promote her to full professor, and she was forced into early retirement in October 1988. Following the dissolution of Kosovo in 1989, all health workers in the clinic were expelled. In 1996 Mekuli opened a gynecology and obstetrics clinic in conjunction with the Mother Teresa charity organization, which brought in gynecologists from around Kosovo to treat women. Her work and figure inspired the character of Teuta Shkreli in Ismail Kadare's novel The Wedding Procession Turned to Ice (). Personal life Mekuli was the wife of Albanian poet Esad Mekuli (1916‚Äì1993). She died in Pristina in November 12, 2013 and was survived by her two children.

It is found on the eastern coast of Africa and other places in the western Indo-Pacific region. It has one accepted variety from the noniminate species, Lumnitzera racemosa var. lutea (Gaudich.) Exell. Description Lumnitzera racemosa is a small to medium-sized evergreen tree, growing to a maximum height of . It develops pneumatophores and often has stilt roots. The leaves are arranged spirally at the tips of the shoots; they are simple and obovate, with slightly toothed margins. The inflorescences grow in short spikes in the axils of the leaves or at the tips of the shoots. The flowers are small and white, and are followed by woody, flattened fruits containing a single seed. Distribution and habitat This species is native from KwaZulu-Natal to southeast Kenya in the western Indian Ocean, tropical & subtropical Asia to the western Pacific. Its range includes KwaZulu-Natal, Mozambique, Tanzania, Kenya, Madagascar, Aldabra, Seychelles, Chagos Archipelago, Maldives, India, Sri Lanka, Andaman Islands, Nicobar Islands, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Cambodia, Vietnam, southeast China, Hainan, Taiwan, Nansei-shoto, Korea, South China Sea, Philippines, Peninsular Malaysia, Jawa, Lesser Sunda Islands, New Guinea, and New Caledonia. In Mozambique it is one of only ten mangrove species.) It grows in the higher part of the intertidal zone and is found both on beaches and lining the banks of creeks. It is a fast-growing, pioneering species. Uses The timber of Lumnitzera racemosa is strong and durable and has many uses, including bridge construction. The wood is highly favoured for charcoal making in Cambodia. The bark is harvested for the tannins it contains. Status Mangroves in general are under threat from coastal development, and this species, which grows on the landward edge of the mangrove area, may be more threatened by rising sea levels than are other species because it may be unable to move further inland. There may be a decline in populations of this species due to habitat loss or harvesting, but it is a common species of mangrove with a very wide range, and is not declining at a sufficient rate to be included in any threatened category, so it is listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature as being of \\"least concern\\".

The bill passed the United States House of Representatives 401‚Äì0 during the 113th United States Congress. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. H.R. 2871 would amend the federal judicial code to realign the southern judicial district of Mississippi into four (currently, five) divisions. The four divisions would be: the Northern Division at Jackson, the Southern Division at Gulfport, the Eastern Division at Hattiesburg, and the Western Division at Natchez. The bill would also set forth the Mississippi counties comprising each realigned division. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary on September 11, 2013. This is a public domain source. H.R. 2871 would consolidate the southern judicial district in the state of Mississippi from five divisions to four. Based on information provided by the Administrative Office of the United States Courts and the United States Department of Justice, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that implementing the bill would have no significant impact on the federal budget. The courthouse in Meridian, Mississippi, is the sole courthouse for the existing eastern division and is scheduled to close under current law. The CBO estimated that the cost of consolidation and any potential savings from operating fewer courthouses would not be significantly different from the costs to the district under the scheduled closing of the Meridian courthouse. Enacting H.R. 2871 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 2871 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history H.R. 2871 was introduced by Rep. Howard Coble (R, NC-6) on July 31, 2013. It was referred to the United States House Committee on the Judiciary and the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property and the Internet. On November 8, 2013, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that H.R. 2871 would be considered under a suspension of the rules on the House floor on November 12, 2013. The bill would be considered along with five other bills, starting after the House opened for the day at 2pm. The House voted on November 12, 2013, to pass the bill 401‚Äì0.

It was erected as a memorial to those who had fallen in the First World War. The dates of the Second World War were subsequently added. The cenotaph consists of a rectangular block of stone on a stone platform, with bronze, low-relief sculptures on the sides depicting marching troops and mourners. It was designed by Lionel Budden, with carving by Herbert Tyson Smith. Initially designated as a Grade II listed building, its status was raised to Grade I in 2013. History In 1926, a competition was held to create a memorial using public funds, with Charles Reilly, professor of architecture at the University of Liverpool, as assessor. There were 257 entrants; the winning, anonymised entry was by Reilly's assistant, Lionel Budden. The building contractors appointed were A. E. Bradley and Company, the sculptor was Herbert Tyson Smith, and his bronze sculptures were made at the foundry of the Morris-Singer Company. The cenotaph was unveiled at 11 am on 11 November 1930 by the 17th Earl of Derby. Following the end of the Second World War, the dates 1939 and 1945 were added. These were unveiled on Remembrance Sunday, 10 November 1946, by William G. Gregson, Lord Mayor of Liverpool. Description Detail from bronze sculpture depicting marching troops The cenotaph consists of a rectangular block of Stancliffe stone, with bronze relief statues on the sides, standing on a platform of Yorkshire Silex stone. The rectangular block is long and high, the length of the bronze panels is , and the platform is long and deep. It is orientated northeast‚Äìsouthwest, in parallel with St George's Hall. The bronze relief on the northwest face, opposite the hall, depicts a stream of marching troops in the uniforms of the various armed forces. Above the panel is an inscription reading AS UNKNOWN AND YET WELL KNOWN AS DYING AND BEHOLD WE LIVE, and below, the inscription reads OUT OF THE NORTH PARTS A GREAT COMPANY AND A MIGHTY ARMY. On the southeast face, facing Lime Street station, the panel depicts mourners laying flowers and wreaths on a Stone of Remembrance, with rows of graves in a military cemetery behind them. Above the panel the inscription reads TO THE MEN OF LIVERPOOL WHO FELL IN THE GREAT WAR with an added inscription below it reads AND ALL WHO HAVE FALLEN IN CONFLICT SINCE. Under the panel is an inscription reading AND THE VICTORY THAT DAY WAS TURNED INTO MOURNING UNTO ALL THE PEOPLE. On the shorter northeast and southwest faces are circular bronze shields with the coat of arms of Liverpool and festoons, and the dates of the two wars. Appraisal Detail from bronze sculpture depicting mourners laying wreaths on the Stone of Remembrance The cenotaph was designated as a Grade II listed building on 28 June 1952. On 8 November 2013, the designation was raised to Grade I. The reasons given for the designation include its design context with its \\"impressive location\\" adjacent to St George's Hall. Also noted is the architectural interest of the cenotaph, with its horizontal lines forming a foil to the vertical columns of the hall. Referring to its sculptural interest, the citation states that the \\"sculptural work is exceptional and is arguably Tyson Smith's finest and most powerful work\\". The design is considered to have contemporary significance in that rather than using \\"allegory and heroic idealisation\\", it employs \\"powerful and modern realist portrayals\\". The quality of its craftsmanship is praised, and it is also to have group value in its location near other listed buildings. In the Pevsner Architectural Guides, Sharples expresses the opinion that \\"it is one of the most remarkable war memorials in the country\\".

He studied engineering at the College of Pennsylvania (the University of Pennsylvania today), where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1783 and a master's degree in 1786. After his graduation, Briggs traveled, moving to Georgia and Georgetown, Washington, D.C. before he married Hannah Brooke and settled near Brookeville in Montgomery County, Maryland. On 1 February 1788, the Georgia legislature awarded Augusta inventor William Longstreet and his associate Isaac Briggs a patent for a steam engine.

TERRA has been shown to be ubiquitously expressed in almost all cell types containing linear chromosomes - including humans, mice, and yeasts. While the exact function of TERRA is still an active area of research, it is generally believed to play a role in regulating telomerase activity as well as maintaining the heterochromatic state at the ends of chromosomes. TERRA interaction with other associated telomeric proteins has also been shown to help regulate telomere integrity in a length- dependent manner. Due to the breadth of roles in which TERRA is implicated for maintaining the genomic integrity at the ends of chromosomes, TERRA dysfunction has also been shown to be associated with a number of disease states, including a number of syndromes related to inappropriate telomere shortening and cellular aging, and the progression of cancer. As such, pharmacologic compounds modulating TERRA transcription as well as its other direct/indirect interactions may be a viable method for the development of new therapeutic strategies.  Structure & Biogenesis = Transcription From DNA  TERRA is an evolutionarily conserved long-non-coding RNA found in many nucleus-containing eukaryotic cells such as humans (Homo sapiens), budding yeast (Schizosaccharomyces cerevisiae), fission yeast (Schizosaccharomyces pombe), mice (Mus musculus), zebrafish (Danio rerio), and various plants (Arabidopsis thaliana, et cetera).Azzalin CM, Reichenbach P, Khoriauli L, Giulotto E, Lingner J.

TERRA is transcribed from DNA as a continuous sequence in most tissues from the subtelomeric and telomeric regions at the end of linear chromosomes. Transcription occurs in the 5' to 3' direction (from the centromere to telomere) and TERRA transcripts are heterogeneous in length, ranging anywhere from 100-bases up to 9-kilobases in length for human cells.Andr√© Maicher, Lisa Kastner & Brian Luke (2012) Telomeres and disease: Enter TERRA, RNA Biology, 9:6, 843-849, DOI: 10.4161/rna.20330. The majority of TERRA transcription has been shown to be carried out by RNA Polymerase II (RNAPII), although RNA Polymerase I and III may also have functions in TERRA transcription for mammals.D√©jardin, J√©r√¥me & E Kingston, Robert. (2009). Purification of Proteins Associated with Specific Genomic Loci. Cell. 136. 175-86. 10.1016/j.cell.2008.11.045. Overview of TERRA Biogenesis and Basic Functions While the exact transcription start site is still a matter of debate, it is widely held that TERRA transcription begins in the subtelomeric region at the end of chromosomes, just before the tandem repeats of the telomere begin. In humans, at least 20 of 23 chromosome ends have been shown to contain CpG islands, which are generally found at or near transcription start sites in the subtelomeric region. Within these CpG island are three repetitive DNA tracts occurring in sequence: a centromere-proximal tract of repeated 61-base-pair (bp) units; second, a more distal tract of 29-bp units; and a third 37-bp unit tract. These highly conserved repetitive elements are known as 61-29-37 Repeats. Additionally, the chromatin organization factors CTCF (CCCTC-Binding Factor), Cohesin, and Rad21 - which are known to aid in the recruitment of RNAPIICusanelli Emilio, Chartrand Pascal. Telomeric noncoding RNA : telomeric repeat‚Äêcontaining RNA in telomere biology. WIREs RNA 2014, 5: 407-419. doi: 10.1002/wrna.1220 \\\\- have also been shown to bind within 1-2 kilobases of the telomeric tracks just upstream of these CpG islands.Deng Z, Wang Z, Stong N, Plasschaert R, Moczan A, Chen H-S, Hu S, Wikramasinghe P, Davuluri RV, Bartolomei MS, etal. A role for CTCF and cohesin in subtelomere chromatin organization, TERRA transcription, and telomere end protection. EMBO J 2012, 31:4165‚Äì4178. While not definitely known, the proximity of these factors immediately upstream of the proposed TERRA transcription start site suggest that they may function as promoter elements for the start of TERRA transcription.  Heterogeneity of Transcript Length  The wide range in length of TERRA transcripts is believed to primarily stem from either different sites of transcription termination within the telomere tract or variation in 3'-end processing. As telomeres do not contain a canonical stop codon signaling the end of RNA transcription, it remains unclear exactly where transcription ceases along the telomere tracks. Similarly to most mRNAs transcribed in the nucleus, nearly all TERRA transcripts contain a 7-methylguanosine (m7G) cap structure at their 5' end.Porro A, Feuerhahn S, Reichenbach P, Lingner J. Molecular dissection of telomeric repeat-containing RNA biogenesis unveils the presence of distinct and multiple regulatory pathways. Mol Cell Biol 2010, 30:4808‚Äì4817. Therefore, the vast majority of post-transcriptional variation occurs at the 3' end of the transcript; however this has been shown to vary between species, as well as within individual cells. In humans, approximately 7 to 10% of TERRA transcripts have been shown to be post-transcriptionally polyadenylated,Claus M. Azzalin & Joachim Lingner (2008) Telomeres: The silence is broken, Cell Cycle, 7:9, 1161-1165, DOI: 10.4161/cc.7.9.5836 whereas almost all TERRA transcribed in yeast contains a poly(A) tail added by the polyadenylation polymerases Pap1 (in S. cerevisiae) or Cid12/Cid14 (in S. pombe).Bah A, Wischnewski H, Shchepachev V, Azzalin CM. The telomeric transcriptome of Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Nucleic Acids Res 2012, 40:2995‚Äì3005. Both of these post-transcriptional modifications contribute to stabilizing TERRA within the cell (half-life ~8 hours) compared to non-modified transcripts (half-life ~3 hours). Additionally, the presence of a polyadenylated tail also appears to act as a determinant of TERRA localization within the nucleus. TERRA transcripts containing a poly(A) tail are generally found \\"free\\" within the nucleoplasm while transcripts lacking a polyadenylated tail are divided between the nucleoplasm (60%) and a chromatin- bound state (40%).  Factors Regulating Transcription  A number of proteins shown to associate with the ends of telomeres are involved in modulating TERRA transcription levels within cells. Factors involved in modulating the heterochromatic state at telomeres, such as histone deacetylase, SUV39H1 H3K9 histone methyltransferase, and DNA methyltransferase 3b (DNMT3B) in human cells,Yehezkel S, Segev Y, Viegas-Pe ÃÅquignot E, Skorecki K, Selig S. Hypomethylation of subtelomeric regions in ICF syndrome is associated with abnormally short telomeres and enhanced transcription from telomeric regions. Hum Mol Genet 2008, 17:2776‚Äì2789. play an important role in regulating total TERRA expression. Additionally, the Shelterin component TRF1 has been shown to support TERRA transcription. As part of the six-protein complex involved with protecting the ends of telomeres, TRF1 has been shown to promote progression of TERRA's primary transcription polymerase RNAPII through telomere tracts, although it has not been shown to promote direct recruitment of the polymerase. In yeast cells, TERRA stability has been shown to be tightly regulated within the nucleus by the 5' to 3' exonuclease Rat1 (human ortholog Xrn2) through interaction with the proteins Rap1 and Rif1/2.N. Iglesias, et al., Subtelomeric repetitive elements determine TERRA regulation by Rap1/Rif and Rap1/Sir complexes in yeast, EMBO Rep. 12 (6) (2011) 587‚Äì593. It remains unclear whether TERRA transcripts remain tethered to the telomeres from which they are transcribed, acting in cis, or whether they may move from one telomere to another by some unknown mechanism to regulate their functions (acting in trans).  Other Telomeric RNA Transcripts  While TERRA currently represents the primary subject of study for RNA transcripts originating from telomeres, a wide variety of alternative transcripts have also been identified as part of the yeast telomeric transcriptome: a transcript complementary to the 5' subtelomeric sequence known as ARRET; a subtelomeric transcript complementary to ARRET known as Œ±ARRET; and a C-rich telomeric repeat-containing transcript known as ARIA.Greenwood J, Cooper JP. Non-coding telomeric and subtelomeric transcripts are differentially regulated by telomeric and heterochromatin assembly factors in fission yeast. Nucleic Acids Res 2012, 40:2956‚Äì2963.  Functions of TERRA = Interaction with Telomerase  Telomerase is the ribonucleoprotein responsible for adding species-dependent tandem repeat sequences (TTAGGG in humans) to the ends of telomeres. These telomeric repeats function to protect the ends of the chromosome from DNA damage or end-to-end fusion with adjacent chromosomes. Since evidence has also shown that TERRA expression is regulated in a telomere-length-dependent manner, it is believed that TERRA may play an important role along with telomerase to modulate the length of telomere repeats on chromosome ends. Generally speaking, cells with long telomeres exhibit greater TERRA expression while short telomeres have relatively lower TERRA expression. At the same time, telomerase activity is known to be at its greatest when telomeres are short and at its lowest activity when telomeres are long. It can therefore be proposed that TERRA acts as a negative regulator of telomerase activity in cells with long telomeres,Redon S, Reichenbach P, Lingner J. Protein RNA and protein protein interactions mediate association of human EST1A/SMG6 with telomerase. Nucleic Acids Res 2007; 35:7011-22; ; http:// dx.doi.org/10.1093/nar/gkm724. while functioning as a positive regulator of telomerase activity at short telomeres \\\\- in conjunction with relative TERRA expression for each telomeric state. = TERRA & Telomerase at Long Telomeres = TERRA-Telomerase Interaction at Long Telomeres At cells with long telomeres, TERRA is proposed to act as a negative regulator of telomerase activity. This direct inhibitor function acts through base-pairing of the tandem repeats found throughout TERRA's 3'-end to the complementary RNA template region of telomerase. The complementary base pairing of the TERRA transcript may work to compete with telomerase's DNA substrate when TERRA expression is at its highest, preventing telomerase from further lengthening telomeres. TERRA may also interact with the catalytic reverse transcriptase subunit (TERT) of telomerase, thereby acting as an allosteric inhibitor of telomerase function and preventing the addition of further telomeric repeats. This model of TERRA-telomerase interaction is supported by experimental evidence where TERRA-mimicking (UUAGGG)3 oligonucleotides have been shown to lead to complete inhibition of telomerase activity in vitro;Redon S, Reichenbach P, Lingner J. The non-coding RNA TERRA is a natural ligand and direct inhibitor of human telomerase. Nucleic Acids Res 2010, 38:5797‚Äì5806. however evidence of this relationship in vivo remains elusive. = TERRA & Telomerase at Short Telomeres = TERRA-Telomerase Interaction at Short Telomeres In seemingly contradictory fashion, it is believed that TERRA may instead coordinate the recruitment of telomerase and encourage subsequent telomere elongation for cells containing short telomeres. Specifically in short telomeres of yeast, evidence suggests that TERRA molecules help to form clusters with the yeast telomerase RNA TLC1. These clusters, known as T-Recs, have been shown to preferentially localize to short telomeres and may therefore encourage telomerase-based elongation.Cusanelli E, Romero CAP, Chartrand P. Telomeric noncoding RNA TERRA is induced by telomere shortening to nucleate telomerase molecules at short telomeres. Mol Cell 2013, 51:780‚Äì791. Furthermore, proteins that preferentially bind the UUAGGG repeats within TERRA molecules, such as the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein hnRNP1A, have been shown to prevent the direct TERRA-telomerase inhibition found at short telomeres, thus promoting telomerase-mediated elongation. The true nature of TERRA's interaction with telomerase remains incompletely described. However, it remains clear that the ability of telomerase to add telomeric repeats to the ends of chromosomes is intricately intertwined with its interaction with TERRA.  Heterochromatin Regulation  In general, long non-coding RNAs are known to mediate epigenetic changes on chromatin by functioning as recruiters for chromatin-modifying enzymes to genomic loci. TERRA is thought to play a similar role, recruiting both heterochromatic proteins and associated chromatin-remodeling complexes to telomeres, helping to establish or maintain heterochromatin formation. Relative TERRA Expression by Heterochromatic State, with Examples of Contributing Modifiers One manner in which chromatin maintains its condensed hetererochromatic state at the telomere is through the enzymes DNA methyltransferases 1 and 3b (DNMT1/3b). Experiments where these factors have been depleted result in increased TERRA expression levels,Farnung BO, Brun CM, Arora R, Lorenzi LE, Azzalin CM. Telomerase efficiently elongates highly transcribing telomeres in human cancer cells. PLoS ONE 2012, 7:e35714. suggesting that methylation status of the subtelomeric region may help to regulate the expression of TERRA. Further post-translational modifications of telomeric histones may also play a pivotal role in TERRA regulation. Decreased density of trimethylated histones H3K9me3 and H4K30me3 have been shown to correlate with increased TERRA levels.Marion RM, Strati K, Li H, Tejera A, Schoeftner S, Ortega S, Serrano M, Blasco MA. Telomeres acquire embryonic stem cell characteristics in induced pluripotent stem cells. Cell Stem Cell 2009, 4:141‚Äì154. RNA pulldown experiments have also shown that TERRA associates with heterochromatin proteins, including HP1Œ±, HP1Œ≤, and the origin recognition complex (ORC).Deng Z, Norseen J, Wiedmer A, Riethman H, Lieberman PM. TERRA RNA binding to TRF2 facilitates heterochromatin formation and ORC recruitment at telomeres. Mol Cell 2009, 35:403‚Äì413. These factors are known to play a role in establishment of heterochromatin and subsequent transcriptional silencing. TERRA-mimicking oligonucleotides have also been shown to associate with other chromatin remodeling complexes such as the NuA Histone Acetyltransferase Complex, BAF- Type SWI/SNF Nucleosome Remodeling Complex, and the NoRC Chromatin Remodeling Complex.Scheibe M, Arnoult N, Kappei D, Buchholz F, Decottignies A, Butter F, Mann M. Quantitative interaction screen of telomeric repeat-containing RNA reveals novel TERRA regulators. Genome Res 2013. It is believed that TERRA may work to stabilize the interaction of these factors with chromatin to promote heterochromatin formation. Overall, evidence has shown a complex relationship whereby TERRA can both regulate the heterochromatic state and be regulated by the heterochromatic state. Increased density of repressive histone marks that cause chromatin to become more condensed correlate with observed decreases in TERRA expression. Concurrently, epigenetic changes that result in chromatin becoming more euchromatic or \\"open\\" in nature correlates with increased TERRA expression. Listed above are factors shown to contribute to modulating TERRA expression, but this is by no means an exhaustive list.  Regulation of Telomere Length  TERRA has been shown to exist exclusively within the nucleus of eukaryotic cells where it specifically associates with the ends of chromosomes at the telomere. While TERRA has not been shown to be an essential or permanent component of telomere chromatin, it is believed that TERRA's primary function is to transiently maintain the structural integrity at telomeres, either through direct interaction with telomeric DNA or by the binding of associated telomeric proteins. = Direct Telomeric Interactions = G-Quadruplex Structure Data has shown that TERRA interacts with telomeric DNA to form G-Quadruplex structures both in vitro and in vivo.Yan Xu, Kuniyuki Kaminaga, and Makoto Komiyama. G-Quadruplex Formation by Human Telomeric Repeats-Containing RNA in Na+ Solution. Journal of the American Chemical Society. 2008 130 (33), 11179-11184. DOI: 10.1021/ja8031532Schaffitzel C, Berger I, Postberg J, Hanes J, Lipps HJ, Pl√ºckthun A. In vitro generated antibodies specific for telomeric guanine-quadruplex DNA react with Stylonychia lemnae macronuclei. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S A. 2001;98(15):8572-7. These structures form due to the abundance of guanine found in the TERRA transcript and their ability to associate through Hoogsteen hydrogen bonding. The resulting square planar structure is known as a guanine tetrad (also known as a G-tetrad or G-quartet) and when two or more guanine tetrads stack on top of each other, they form a G-quadruplex. These complex structures have been shown help to modulate telomere length through inhibition telomerase's ability to add tandem TTAGGG repeats, specifically in cells with long telomeres. This inhibitive effect seems to function in a telomere length-dependent manner; that is, TERRA levels inversely correlate with increased activity of telomere elongation. In general, TERRA has been shown to be most abundant in cells with long telomeres, while cells with short telomeres express comparatively lower levels of transcript expression.There is also evidence that overexpression of TERRA in human cells can help promote telomere processing by inhibiting the 5'-3' exonuclease Exo1 through the Ku70/80 dimer.Pfeiffer V, Lingner J. TERRA promotes telomere shortening through exonuclease 1-mediated resection of chromosome ends. PLoS Genet. 2012;8(6):e1002747. TERRA expression has also been shown to be cell cycle regulated via the chromatin-remodeling protein ATRX, with the highest expression of TERRA being present at the G1 phase following mitosis and before progressively declining to its lowest in S phase. Therefore, TERRA expression may play an important role in the proper orchestration of DNA replication, as TERRA may hybridize with single-stranded DNA during replication.Luke B, Lingner J.

In cells with long telomeres and high TERRA expression, this could potentially lead to replicative arrest and the eventual collapse of the replication fork, resulting in double- stranded breaks at the telomere. This model is supported by evidence in other regions of the genome where persistent DNA-RNA hybrids lead to increased DNA damage.Poveda AM, Le Clech M, Pasero P.

Nat Rev Genet 2008; 9:204-17; ; http:// dx.doi.org/10.1038/nrg2268. The Shelterin Complex Helps to Protect the Ends of Telomeres TERRA has also been indicated to be involved with the stabilization of the telomere-protecting Shelterin complex at the ends of telomeres. Evidence shows that TERRA functions together with hnRNPA1 to displace RPA from single-stranded DNA following replication and promotes the loading of the Shelterin component POT1 onto telomere ends.Flynn RL, Centore RC, O‚ÄôSullivan RJ, Rai R, Tse A, Songyang Z, Chang S, Karlseder J, Zou L. TERRA and hnRNPA1 orchestrate an RPA-to-POT1 switch on telomeric single- stranded DNA. Nature 2011, 471:532‚Äì536. This helps to stabilize the Shelterin complex so that it can properly cap the ends of chromosomes and protect them from recognition by DNA damage signaling pathways.  TERRA and the Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) Pathway  In cells that lack telomerase expression, it is well-established that most cells instead maintain the ends of their telomeres through the recombination-based Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) pathway. It is proposed that TERRA may work to delay the onset of cellular senescence in these cells and instead promote mechanisms of homologous recombination, thereby driving the ALT phenotype as an alternative means of maintaining telomere ends.Ng L. J., Cropley J. E., Pickett H. A., Reddel R. R., Suter C. M. (2009). Telomerase activity is associated with an increase in DNA methylation at the proximal subtelomere and a reduction in telomeric transcription. Nucleic Acids Res. 37 1152‚Äì1159 In support of this model, TERRA expression has also been shown relate to cellular ALT-status. Cells that have been experimentally confirmed to utilize the ALT pathway have markedly higher levels of TERRA expression compared to non-ALT cells. The specific nature of the complex interactions involved in this proposed model remain an area of active research. = Indirect Telomeric Interactions = TERRA has further been shown to play a role in a number of interactions with proteins functioning at the ends of telomeres. Association with nonsense-mediated RNA decay (NMD) machinery such as UPF1, SMG1 and EST1A/SMG6Chawla R, Azzalin C, M: The telomeric transcriptome and SMG proteins at the crossroads. Cytogenet Genome Res 2008;122:194-201. doi: 10.1159/000167804 and members of the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) family have also been shown to regulate the displacement of TERRA from the ends of telomeres. The ability of these mechanisms to actively coordinate the displacement of TERRA provides evidence that TERRA is not a stable constituent of the telomeric chromatin, but not necessarily unstable itself.de Silanes IL, d‚ÄôAlcontres MS, Blasco MA. TERRA transcripts are bound by a complex array of RNA- binding proteins. Nat Commun 2010, 1:33. Instead, the regulated control of TERRA displacement suggests a link between TERRA localization at the telomere and overall genome integrity. For example, in short telomeres with low TERRA expression, UPF1 and other SMG factors may work in concordance with DNA Polymerase Œ¥ to remove TERRA from the telomere during replication and alleviate fork stalling to allow for progression of replicative machinery. Additionally, replication fork stalling and SMG factor recruitment may also aid in telomerase localization to the telomeres where de novo repeats may be added to promote elongation of short chromosomes.  Proposed Role in Human Disease  While there are no diseases directly attributed to TERRA dysfunction, a number of diseases related to inappropriate telomere shortening and cellular aging may have dysfunctional TERRA expression as one of their causative factors. Such examples include cancer development and progression,Artandi SE, DePinho RA. Telomeres and telom- erase in cancer.

Immunodeficiency, Centromeric Region Instability, Facial Anomalies (ICF Syndrome)  ICF is a rare autosomal recessive disease arising from deficiencies or mutations in DNA Methyltransferase 3b (DNMT3b), which acts as a key modulator in maintaining heterochromatin at telomeres.Ehrlich M. The ICF syndrome, a DNA methyltransfer- ase 3B deficiency and immunodeficiency disease. Clin Immunol 2003; 109:17-28; ; http:// dx.doi.org/10.1016/S1521-6616(03)00201-8. As a result, many ICF patients experience spontaneous genomic instability in various tissues and systemic immunodeficiency. Contrary to traditionally low TERRA levels at short telomeres it has recently been shown that ICF patients display increased TERRA transcription at critically shortened telomeres. However, this is likely the result DNMT3b deficiencies or mutations causing hypomethylation of the CpG islands within the subtelomeric region, allowing for increased TERRA transcription.Deng Z, Campbell AE, Lieberman PM. TERRA, CpG methylation, and telomere heterochromatin: lessons from ICF syndrome cells. Cell Cycle 2010, 9:69‚Äì74. Further evidence also shows a decrease in trimethylated histone H3K9 at the telomeres and loss of binding of the Shelerin-component TRF2 at the subtelomeres. As a result, the increased TERRA expression further contributes to abnormal shorting of the telomere, leading to the spontaneous genomic instability and systemic immunodeficiency. At the minimum, there appears to be a causal link between DNA methylation, TERRA regulation, and telomere length - although the relationship is currently not well understood.  In Cancer  One of the most distinct differences in TERRA expression exists between cancer cells, which exhibit significantly increased TERRA levels, and normal somatic tissues. This observation suggests that high levels of TERRA expression must evolutionarily benefit cancer progression in some way, possibly in their ability to promote unchecked cellular proliferation and induce cellular transformation. Even within subtypes of cancer cells, there exist differences in TERRA expression based on the mechanism by which cells maintain the length of their telomeres; TERRA levels have been shown to be consistently lower in telomerase positive cells compared to cells that utilize the homologous recombination-based Alternative Lengthening of Telomeres (ALT) mechanism. TERRA may give ALT-positive cancer cells a means to promote genomic instability at telomeres and allow for this recombination-based method of elongation. It remains unclear in this model if TERRA is a cause or consequence of the ALT pathway. Methylation status of the subtelomeric histones may also play an important role in TERRA expression in cancer cells. Many cancer cell subtypes are known to be heavily methylated at the CpG islands of the subtelomeric promoter region, resulting in increased transcription of TERRA.Nergadze SG, Farnung BO, Wischnewski H, Khoriauli L, Vitelli V, Chawla R, Giulotto E, Azzalin CM. CpG-island promoters drive transcription of human telomeres. RNA 2009, 15:2186‚Äì2194.  As a Target for Small Molecules  There are currently no known inhibitors that specifically target TERRA in cells. However, relating to many of the diseases and syndromes listed above, it is believed that targeted transcriptional silencing of TERRA may potentially provide a viable mechanism for treatment of cells with high levels of TERRA expression. Increasing the activity of TERRA-repressive histone deacetylases such as SIRT1 and SIRT6 through the use of allosteric activators may be prime candidates for the active repression of TERRA transcription. Commercially available sirtuin-activating compounds (STACs) such as Resveratrol, Butein, Piceatannol, Isoliquiritigenin, Fisetin, and Quercetin are examples of small molecules that may target this axis.Alca√≠n FJ, Villalba JM. Sirtuin activators. Expert Opin Ther Pat 2009; 19:403-14; ; http:// dx.doi.org/10.1517/13543770902762893. Targeting TERRA with antisense RNA or RNAi technology may also be a way to promote proper telomere function and preserve telomere length. However it is important to note that complete abolishment of TERRA transcription must be avoided, as TERRA's association with the shelterin component POT1 plays a key role in recruitment of the complex to the ends of telomeres. As a further consideration, decreased TERRA expression on an organismal level may increase the replicative capacity of all actively dividing cells, thus potentially promoting tumorigenesis. Only a therapy targeted to cells with high levels of TERRA expression should be considered in these cases. Since TERRA is also proposed to have a role in telomerase inhibition, factors increasing TERRA transcription may also be useful in select cases where aberrant telomerase activity is a contributing factor of disease. General HDAC inhibitors or specific sirtuin inhibitors such as Nicotinamide or Cambinol may prove to be viable treatment options in these cases. Trichostatin A (a HDAC1/2 inhibitor) has already been shown to significantly increase TERRA levels in human cancer cells. It is important to note that TERRA upregulation alone has not been shown to be sufficient to induce telomere loss, so these drugs may need to be given in combination with other therapies, such as telomerase inhibitors.

She showed some promise as a two-year-old in 1980 before developing into a top- class middle distance performer in the following year. Her only victory in a thirteen race career came when she won the Prix de Diane in 1981, but she was placed in many important races including the Oaks Stakes, King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes, Arlington Million and Prix Vermeille. Having been originally bought for 8,000 guineas she was eventually sold for a reported $1.4 million. Background Madam Gay was a dark-coated bay mare with a small white star and a white sock on her left hind leg, bred by the Worksop Manor Stud in Nottinghamshire. She was one of the best horses sired by Star Appeal, an Irish-bred, German-trained horse who won the Eclipse Stakes and Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe in 1975. Madam Gay's dam Saucy Flirt was a sprinter who won handicap races at York and Leicester. As a yearling, the filly was sent to the Tattersalls sales at Newmarket in October and was bought for 8,000 guineas by Geoffrey Kaye. She was sent into training with Paul Kelleway a former National Hunt jockey at his Shalfleet stables on the Bury Road in Newmarket, Suffolk. Racing career=1980: two-year-old season Madam Gay finished uplaced in her first two races, including the Chesham Stakes at Royal Ascot. Despite these defeats she was moved up in class to contest the Group 3 Waterford Candelabra Stakes at Goodwood Racecourse. She finished strongly to take second place in a field of ten runners behind Fairy Footsteps. In their annual Racehorses of 1980, the independent Timeform organisation described her as being \\"sure to win, when her sights are lowered\\". 1981: three-year-old season Kelleway showed no inclination to \\"lower the sights\\", running the filly against the best available opposition in Europe and North America in 1981. After finishing third in the Princess Elizabeth Stakes on her first appearance she contested the Classic 1000 Guineas over Newmarket's Rowley Mile course. Ridden by Tony Murray, she started a 50/1 outsider, but was beaten less than one and a half lengths as she finished fifth behind Fairy Footsteps. In the Musidora Stakes, a trial race for The Oaks, Madam Gay reversed the Newmarket form with Fairy Footsteps but was beaten four lengths into second place by the Irish filly Condessa. On 6 June, Madam Gay was moved up in distance for the Oaks over one and a half miles at Epsom Downs Racecourse and started the 10/1 fifth choice in the betting. Ridden by John Reid she was one of very few runners able to stay in contention with the strong pace set by Leap Lively. She eventually finished second, seven lengths behind Blue Wind, but ten lengths clear of the other runners. Madam Gay was still without a win in seven starts when she was sent to France to contest the Group 1 Prix de Diane (French Oaks) over 2100 metres at Chantilly Racecourse eight days later. Ridden by Lester Piggott she started at odd of 9/1 in a field which included April Run, Val d'Erica ( winner of the Oaks d'Italia), Tootens (Prix Saint Alary) and Ukraine Girl (Poule d'Essai des Pouliches). Madam Gay was restrained by Piggott towards the back of the field before moving into contention in the straight. She sprinted past her opponents, went clear of the field and won by four lengths from Val d'Erica in a race record time of 2:06.5 despite being eased down in the closing stages. Madam Gay was then matched against colts and older horses in the Eclipse Stakes on 4 July over ten furlongs at Sandown Park Racecourse where she finished fifth of the eight runners behind Master Willie. Three weeks later, she contested Britain's most prestigious all-aged race, the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes at Ascot Racecourse. She was ridden by Greville Starkey and started a 40/1 outsider in a field which included Shergar (the 2/5 favourite), Master Willie, Light Cavalry and Pelerin (Hardwicke Stakes). Although she was no match for Shergar, Madam Gay stayed on strongly in the straight to finish second, four lengths behind the winner. On 30 August, Madam Gay represented Britain in the inaugural running of the Arlington Million, then the world's most valuable horse race, after her owners paid a supplementary entry fee of $35,000. She was partnered by Piggott who was unable to ride at less than 117 pounds, meaning that Madam Gay had to carry four pounds more than weight-for-age. She was settled behind the leaders along the rail before moving up into third place approaching the final turn. The filly could make no further progress, but stayed on to finish third of the fourteen runners beaten a nose and two lengths by John Henry and The Bart. During her stay in the United States it was made known that the filly was available for sale at a price of $2,000,000, but there were no takers. She then returned to Europe for the Prix Vermeille at Longchamp Racecourse on 13 September. She was made the 7/4 favourite, but after being given a great deal of ground to make up in the straight she finished third to April Run and Leandra. Madam Gay was then bought for an undisclosed sum (later reported as $1.4 million) to Daniel Wildenstein in a private deal. On her final racecourse appearance, Madam Gay produced one of her few poor efforts as she finished tenth behind Vayrann in the Champion Stakes at Newmarket on 17 October. At the end of the season, Madam Gay was exported to continue her racing career in the United States. Madam Gay died in 1983 and did not produce any registered offspring. Assessment In 1980, the independent Timeform organisation gave Madam Gay a rating of 107, seventeen pounds below their top-rated two-year-old filly Marwell. In the Free Handicap, a rating of the best two-year-olds to race in Britain, she was given a weight of 111 pounds, fifteen pounds below Marwell and twenty-one pounds below the top colt Storm Bird. In the following year, Madam Gay was rated 125 by Timeform, eight pounds below Marwell. She was rated the fifth-best three-year- old filly in Europe in the International Classification.

Life Marcus was born in Berlin in a Jewish family, the son of Georg Marcus, a jurist, and Regina Schwartz. As a child, he lived near the Berlin Zoo, where he observed all kinds of animals, and collected beetles. He studied at the Kaiser Friedrich Gymnasium and later entered the Friedrich Wilhelm University to study zoology. He began his doctoral studies in the Entomology Department at the Berlin Museum and, in 1914, he published his first zoological work. However, his studies were later delayed due to World War I, where he fought as a soldier, and his second work, a thesis on Coleoptera, was published only in 1919, when he received his doctorate. After graduation, he continued to work at the museum and was assigned to the Bryozoa collection. Without a resident specialist to teach him, he learned everything about the group on his own. In 1923, Marcus obtained the 'Privat-Dozent', a credential that permitted him to teach at the university level. Thus, he became a professor at the Friedrich Wilhelm University. As an assistant to Karl Heider, Marcus became interested in Developmental Mechanics. In 1924, aged 31, he married Eveline Du Bois-Reymond, granddaughter of Emil Du Bois-Reymond, and together they published several zoological works. In 1929, he was appointed Associate Professor at the Zoological Institute. With the rise of Nazism in Germany, Marcus was dismissed as an assistant to Heider in 1935. In March 1936, he received a telegram from S√£o Paulo offering him a professorship. This offer came due to the efforts of the Society for the Protection of Science and Learning, Ltd, a group that tried to find jobs for displaced Jewish scientist. Later that month, Marcus moved to Brazil with his wife, arriving on 1 April. He started to teach zoology at the University of S√£o Paulo, occupying the chair that was vacant by the death of Professor Ernst Bresslau, and began studying the Brazilian bryozoan fauna. With the start of World War II, Marcus was forbidden to go to the coast because of his German origins, making him turn his attention to freshwater bryozoans and other freshwater and terrestrial invertebrates, especially oligochaetes and turbellarians. In 1945, he became full professor of zoology and presented a large thesis about microturbellarians. After the war ended, Marcus was invited to go back to Germany, but he declined, saying that he was not willing to reconstruct his life a third time. Allowed to return to the coast, he continued to work on bryozoans, but focused more on turbellarians and later on opistobranchs. With Eveline, Marcus published 162 papers between 1936 and 1968, the first ones in Portuguese. Later works were published in English and focused on several invertebrate groups, such as flatworms, annelids, tardigrades, onychophorans, nemertines, phoronids, gastropods, and pycnogonids. Marcus died in 1968, and his wife continued their research until her death.

CNB is the only state company in Portugal that has a dance season and is the only company with a permanent group of artists that currently ensure regular seasons at the Teatro Cam√µes as well as touring the country (including the Madeira and Azores islands) and abroad. Established through government initiative, the company has two aims that complement each other. One is the preservation and presentation of international ballet repertoire, performing classical ballet productions; the other is the permanent update of this art form, presenting modern and contemporary choreography by national and foreign authors. The result is an extremely eclectic repertoire which crosses centuries, styles and techniques while keeping a strong Portuguese and European identity. CNB was the first ballet company in Portugal to produce full-length classical ballets such as La Fille Mal Gard√©e, Swan Lake, Don Quixote, La Sylphid, La Bayad√®re, Paquita, Coppelia, Romeo and Juliet, The Firebird and The Rite of Spring. In addition, the company reviews and re-deciphers works from the ballet canon, commissioning new pieces by creators who reinterpret them with a contemporary outlook, often in dialogue with Portugal's history. CNB performances include works by prominent international choreographers such as George Balanchine, Vaslav Nijinsky, Serge Lifar, Kurt Jooss, Jos√© Lim√≥n, Lar Lubovitch, Michael Corder, Hans van Manen, Robert North, Heinz Sp√∂erli, Nacho Duato, Mauro Bigonzetti, Henri Oguike, Cayetano Soto, Ohad Naharin, William Forsythe, Anne Teresa de Keersmaeker and Akram Khan, as well as Portuguese choreographers such as Armando Jorge, Fernando Lima, Carlos Trincheiras, Rui Lopes Gra√ßa, Olga Roriz, Vasco Wellenkamp, Paulo Ribeiro, Rui Horta, Clara Andermatt or Fernando Duarte.

People alleged to have such an ability are often called human magnets. Although metal objects are the most popular, some are also alleged to be able to stick other types of materials, such as glass, porcelain, wood or plastic as well as metals with no ferromagnetic properties such as brass and aluminium. However, none of the recorded claims of human magnetism corresponds with the physics of magnetism, indicating that this \\"ability\\" is in fact nothing more than a misunderstanding of the physics and meaning of the term and a misapplication of it to what has been shown to be nothing more than unusually sticky skin.

That would suggest that the phenomenon cannot be explained by magnetism and uses a different kind of physical effect. Skeptic Benjamin Radford has used a compass to check the magnetic field of a person that claimed to be a human magnet. He concluded that person did not produce magnetic fields. He also noted that those people usually have smooth and hairless skin and lean back slightly while sticking objects, which would not be necessary if they possessed magnetic powers. Many scientists and proponents of science, including James Randi, claim that this ability can be explained by friction and is caused by unusually sticky skin; to prove that, Randi has demonstrated that human magnets lose their powers when they are covered in talc.

The rate increased by the same amount as the cost of living increase that was applied to Social Security. The bill passed the United States Senate and House during the 113th United States Congress, and was signed into law by President Barack Obama on November 21, 2013. Background A similar bill () was introduced in the House. There was no cost of living adjustment in 2010 or 2011. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2013 directed the United States Secretary of Veterans Affairs (VA) to increase, as of December 1, 2013, the rates of veterans' disability compensation, additional compensation for dependents, the clothing allowance for certain disabled veterans, and dependency and indemnity compensation for surviving spouses and children. The bill required each such increase to be the same percentage as the increase in benefits provided under title II (Old Age, Survivors and Disability Insurance) of the Social Security Act, on the same effective date. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the Senate Committee on Veterans‚Äô Affairs on July 24, 2013. This is a public domain source. S. 893 increased the amounts paid to veterans for disability compensation and to their survivors for dependency and indemnity compensation (DIC) by the same cost-of-living adjustment (COLA) payable to Social Security recipients. The increase took effect on December 1, 2013. The COLA that was authorized by this bill is assumed in the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) baseline, consistent with section 257 of the Balanced Budget and Emergency Deficit Control Act. Because the COLA is assumed in the CBO‚Äôs baseline, the COLA provision had no budgetary effect relative to the baseline. Relative to current law, the CBO estimated that enacting this bill would increase spending for those programs by $0.9 million in fiscal year 2014. This estimate assumed that the COLA effective on December 1, 2013, would be 1.5 percent. (The annualized cost would be about $1.2 billion in subsequent years. The CBO previously estimated that the COLA change relative to current law would be about $2.6 billion on an annualized basis in contrast to that corrected figure of about $1.2 billion.) Procedural history The Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2013 was introduced on May 8, 2013 by Sen. Bernard Sanders (I, VT). It was referred to the United States Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs. It was released from the Committee alongside Senate Report 113-87. On October 28, 2013, the Senate voted by Unanimous consent to pass the bill. The Veterans' Compensation Cost-of-Living Adjustment Act of 2013 was received in the United States House of Representatives. It was referred to the United States House Committee on Veterans' Affairs. On November 8, 2013, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that H.R. 2871 would be considered under a suspension of the rules on the House floor on November 12, 2013. The bill was considered along with five other bills, starting after the House opened for the day at 2pm. The bill passed the House, and on November 21, 2013 it was signed into law by President Barack Obama.

After emerging in the slave-maker nest, slave workers work as if they were in their own colony, while parasite workers only concentrate on replenishing the labor force from neighboring host nests, a process called slave raiding. The slave-making ants are specialized to parasitize a single species or a group of related species, and they are often close relatives to their hosts, which is typical for social parasites. The slave-makers may either be permanent social parasites (thus depending on enslaved ants throughout their whole lives) or facultative slave- makers. The behavior is unusual among ants but has evolved several times independently. Terminology Theft of brood for the purpose of employing the stolen individual's efforts in support of the thief is called dulosis (from Greek , \\"slave\\"), but the term \\"slave-making\\" is used in older literature and is still common. A related type of social parasitism is called inquilinism, in which a reproductive enters a host colony, lays eggs, and relies on the host colony to rear its offspring. Unlike brood parasitism, the inquiline remains within the nest and typically its brood does not outnumber the host's brood. Obligate and facultative slave-makers Slave-making ants may either be permanent social parasites, thus depending on enslaved host ants throughout their whole lives or facultative slave-makers. Facultative slave-making ants, like those in the Formica sanguinea complex, represent an intermediate parasitic group, between free-living species and obligatory slave-making species. In laboratory tests, when slaves were removed from colonies of Formica sanguinea and Polyergus rufescens, the behavior of F. sanguinea changed dramatically within 30 days of slave removal, with workers becoming self-sufficient at feeding and brood care. Workers of Polyergus, in contrast, were unable to care for their brood, and experienced high mortality. Raids Polyergus lucidus returning from raid on Formica incerta. Two of the latter already incorporated into the mixed colony are visible to the right of the nest entrance. Parasitized nests need to replenish the host workers periodically. This is achieved by raiding other nests in a process called slave raiding. The parasite workers are specialized for conducting raids in a two-step process. First, scouts individually search for potential host nests. When successful, the scout returns to its nest and recruits nest-mates to initiate the raid, during which slave-maker ants seize a brood and bring it back home. A colony may capture 14,000 pupae in a single season. Most slave- raiders capture only the young, but Strongylognathus sp. also enslave adult workers. In most parasite species, workers mark the way to its nest with pheromones and afterwards fellow slave-makers are attracted within a few seconds. They then go quickly to the targeted host nest, attack it, and carrying as many larvae and pupae as possible, return to their nest following the same trail marked by the pheromone. Rossomyrmex is the only reported slave-maker that exclusively uses adult transport and single recruitment chain instead of pheromones during raids, a behavior probably constrained by the arid habitat; raids take place in early summer when soil surface temperature can reach up to , a temperature in which pheromones would quickly evaporate. Workers of the attacked nest can fight or flee. In the host species Proformica, the most common behavior is flight, probably because hosts almost always lose fights. Most studies on the raiding behavior of species in the F. sanguinea complex confirm that slave raiders usually rout their opponents, who typically flee in a state of panicked alarm, and that aggressive encounters, when they occur, are brief and do not result in the death of adult individuals from either species. However, when large colonies of slave species offer resistance during raids prolonged fighting is possible and many workers of both species can be killed. Later, host workers emerging in the parasite nest will be imprinted on and integrated into the mixed colony where they will rear the parasite brood, feed and groom the parasite workers, defend the nest against aliens, and even participate in raids, including those against their original colony. Altruistic acts of slaves are thus directed toward unrelated individuals. One hypothesis suggests that slave deception is possible because slaves are captured as pupae and learn the slave-maker colony odor after emergence. However, in some cases, the enslaved ants rebel against their slave-maker ants, killing a large number of the slave-maker ant offspring. This is because \\"slaves can gain indirect fitness benefits by reducing parasite pressure on nearby host colonies, because these are often closely related to the slaves\\". Thus, the slave ants protect their native colonies from further raids by slave-maker ants.

Only one slave species is usually found in a single Polyergus nest. This is in contrast to related facultative slave-makers of the genus Formica belonging to the F. sanguinea species group, found in the same habitat, whose nests commonly contain two or more species serving as slaves. Choice of a host species can occur both through the colony-founding behavior of queens and through the choice of target nests for slave raids. The parasitic Polyergus queens found colonies either by adoption, where a queen invades the nest of a slave species, killing the resident queen and appropriating workers and brood present, or by \\"budding\\", in which a queen invades or is accepted into a host species nest accompanied by workers from her nest of origin. Evolution The first hypothesis concerning the origins of slave-making was Darwin's (1859) suggestion in On the Origin of Species that slavery developed as a by-product of brood predation among related species. Other hypotheses focuses on territorial interactions with opportunistic brood predation or brood transport among polydomous colonies (consist of multiple nests) as the main pathway to slave-making. Slave-making behavior is unusual among ants but has evolved independently more than ten times in total including in the subfamilies Myrmicinae and Formicinae. Slave-makers and their hosts are often close phylogenetic relatives, which is typical for social parasites and their respective hosts (formalized as Emery's rule). This has major evolutionary implications since it may argue for sympatric speciation. Raids can jeopardize host colony survival, therefore exerting a strong selection pressure upon the hosts. Reciprocally, there is some evidence that hosts also exert a selection pressure on their parasites in return, since resistance by host colonies might prevent enslavement. Coevolutionary processes between slave-making ant species and their hosts then can escalate to an evolutionary arms race.

He held the position of Imam four times during a chaotic period of civil war and invasion by Persian forces. Saif bin Sultan II inherited leadership of the country as a child, but was pushed aside in favor of his brother. His brother was deposed, and Saif was again proclaimed Imam, although power was held by a regent who later proclaimed himself Imam. The regent was deposed, Saif was proclaimed Imam again, and after a civil war was again deposed in 1724. Fighting continued, and in 1728 Saif became Imam for the fourth and last time. He was forced to share power with a rival Imam who controlled the interior. A civil war ensued in which the country was divided. Saif bin Sultan II twice called for help from Persia. The first time the Persians looted the towns and caused great destruction before leaving. The second time they set about conquering the country. Saif bin Sultan II was deposed in 1742 and died in 1743. Puppet ruler Rustaq fort, which Saif bin Sultan II used as his base Saif bin Sultan II was aged about twelve when his father, the Imam Sultan bin Saif II, died in 1718. Although he had been named as successor and was popular among the people, the ulama decided he was too young to hold office and favored his great-uncle Muhanna bin Sultan. In 1719 Muhanna bin Sultan was brought into Rustaq Fort by stealth and proclaimed Imam. Muhanna was unpopular, and in 1720 was deposed and killed by his cousin Ya'arub bin Bal'arab. Ya'arub bin Bal'arab restored Saif bin Sultan II as the Imam and proclaimed himself Custodian. In May 1722 Ya'Arab took the next step and proclaimed himself Imam. This caused an uprising led by Bel'arab bin Nasir, a relative by marriage of the deposed Imam. In 1723 Ya'arub bin Bal'arab was deposed and Bal'arab bin Nasir became the Custodian. Soon after, Muhammad bin Nasir al Ghafiri led his Nizari tribes in a revolt. He was opposed by a faction led by Khalf bin Mubarak of the Bani Hina tribe, and therefore called the Hinawi. Muhammad bin Nasir al Ghafiri gained the upper hand, capturing Saif bin Sultan II and his uncle Bil'arab. Muhammad bin Nasir was elected Imam in October 1724. His rival, Khalf bin Mubarak, stirred up trouble among the northern tribes. In an engagement at Sohar in 1728 both Khalf bin Mubarak and Muhammad bin Nasir were killed. The garrison of Sohar recognized Saif bin Sultan II as Imam, and he was re-installed at Nizwa. Divided rule The fort at Sohar Soon after Saif bin Sultan II had been installed, some of the inhabitants of Az Zahirah elected Saif's cousin Bal'arab bin Himyar as Imam. From this time the country was divided between the Ghafiri (Sunni) and the Hinawi (Ibadi) factions. After early clashes, the rival Imams remained armed but avoided hostilities for a few years. Bel'arab controlled most of the interior, and gradually gained the ascendancy on land. Saif was only supported by the Beni Hina and a few allied tribes, but had the navy and the main seaports of Muscat, Burka and Sohar. Saif adopted an extravagant lifestyle at his residence in Rustaq, developing a love of Shirazi wine. With his power dwindling, Saif bin Sultan II eventually asked for help against his rival from Nader Shah of Persia. A Persian force arrived in March 1737. Saif bin Sultan joined the Persians. They marched to Az Zahirah where they met and routed the forces of Bal'arab bin Himyar. The Persians advanced through the interior, capturing towns, killing, looting and taking slaves. They then reembarked for Persia, taking their loot with them. For a few years after this Saif bin Sultan II was undisputed ruler, but continued his a self-indulgent life, which turned the tribes against him. Deposition and death In February 1742 another member of the Yaruba family was proclaimed Imam, Sultan bin Murshid. Sultan bin Murshid was installed at Nakhal and began to hound Saif bin Sultan, who again appealed to the Persians for help and promised to cede Sohar to them. A Persian expedition arrived at Julfar around October 1742. They besieged Sohar and sent forces to Muscat, but were unable to take either place. In 1743 Saif was tricked into letting the Persians take Fort Al Jalali and Fort Al-Mirani, which guarded the harbor of Muscat. He died soon after. The Imam Sultan bin Murshid was mortally wounded under the walls of Sohar in mid-1743. Bal'arab bin Himyar was elected Imam in his place. In 1744 Ahmad bin Said al-Busaidi, governor of the Sohar garrison, was elected as a rival Imam, founding the dynasty that continues to rule Oman. In 1747 he succeeded in destroying the last Persian force in Oman. Ahmad bin Said became undisputed ruler of Oman when Bal'arab bin Himyar died in 1749.

Ute, Arapaho, Cheyenne and other plains tribes came to the area, spent winters there, and \\"share[d] in the gifts of the waters without worry of conflict.\\" There were 9 or 10 natural springs. As whites moved in there were \\"skirmishes\\" for access to the historical resort area until the Native Americans were removed from the area and placed on reservations. Explorer Stephen Harriman Long made note of the water's healing properties in 1820. His expedition's botanist and geologist, Edwin James, noted the healing benefits of the water; He was also the first European man believed to have climbed Pikes Peak. George Frederick Ruxton wrote of the \\"boiling waters\\" in a book about his travels. Recognizing the extent to which Native Americans considered the site to be sacred, Ruxton wrote: \\"‚Ä¶the basin of the spring (at Manitou) was filled with beads and wampum, and pieces of red cloth and knives, while the surrounding trees were hung with strips of deer skin, cloth and moccosons (sic).\\" In the 1870s, there was a pavilion over the Ute Iron Springs, which is thought to be one \\"strongest of tonics\\" due to its high iron content. In the early or mid 1880s, Iron Springs Company purchased the spring and built an Adirondack style wood pavilion over the spring. They sold the mineral water commercially until they sold the spring to Joseph G. Hiestand in 1887. In 1890, Joseph G. Heistand had the Ute Iron Springs pavilion torn down and rebuilt as a two-story structure, the second floor was a photographic gallery. The spring in the lower Englemann canyon was near the mouth of the canyon and the Iron Springs Hotel. The Ouray spring was found in 1895 and was established commercially that year. In 1910, the Iron Geyser on Ruxton Avenue was drilled by Hiestand, to augment the operations of his Ute Iron spring. The springs were owned by Hiestand through his death on January 1, 1916. In the 1920s, William S. Crosby drilled two streams, which combined made a sweet tasting soda water, named Twin Springs. The current Manitou Mineral Springs on Ruxton Avenue are Iron Spring and Twin Spring. Ute Iron Spring was capped when the Iron Springs Chateau Melodrama Dinner Theater was built in or before 1964. Hotels According to a June 1880 advertisement, the Iron Springs Hotel was located very near the Ute Iron Springs and has been entirely rebuilt and decorated with the \\"handsomest\\" furnishings. Charles A. Hubert was the proprietor of the hotel. It was burned in July 1882. In 1884, the large Iron Springs Hotel was built by the Gillis Brothers for the Manitou Iron Springs Company. It was located on Ruxton Avenue at the site of the current Manitou Incline trailhead. The Gillis Brothers also had several cottages built on Ruxton that year. In 1885, the hotel began using a generator, installed by the Edison Incandescent Lighting Company. The power and lighting was tested at the hotel before working on the \\"lower part of Manitou\\". That year, the establishment could serve more than 200 people in its hotel and cottages, which had hot and cold running water and steam heat, in addition to electricity. H. T. Blake was the owner of the Iron Springs Hotel in 1887 and at least into 1888. The hotel was purchased by Major John Hulbert, Jerome B. Wheeler, and M.A. Leddy by January 18, 1890 for about $150,000 ). Their plans include increasing the hotel plant to a building costing $300,000 ). Hiestand was the owner of the hotel by 1900 and at the time of his death in 1916. The Eggleton offered furnished rooms near the Ute Iron Springs by 1903. Railways Manitou and Pike's Peak Railway depot on Ruxton Avenue, 1894 Construction of a Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad spur from Colorado Springs to Manitou began in 1880. In 1886 or 1887, the Colorado Midland Railway operated along Ruxton Creek. The railway offered service between Manitou and Green Mountain Falls through Ute Pass. The route was extended to Leadville and Aspen. Colorado Midland Railway‚Äîfounded by Irving Howbert, J. J. Hagerman, and Jerome B. Wheeler‚Äîhelped to make resort communities in Ute Pass successful in the 1890s, but it did not realize great financial success. In 1891, the Manitou & Pikes Peak Cog Railway had been built along Ruxton Creek and transported passengers to the Pikes Peak summit. The depot was built by the Gillis Brothers. Aside from the addition of a lunchroom, the depot has not changed much from its original building. In 1895, the Colorado Springs and Interurban Railway electric trolley line provided transportation from Manitou Avenue to the Manitou and Pike's Peak Railway depot on Ruxton Avenue on a trolley called the \\"Dinky\\". Historic buildings and attractions View of the Manitou Incline from the base, May 2013 In 1880, a candy and cigar store operated near the Ute Iron Spring. lt was purchased by the Iron Springs Company, who also bought the spring. Joseph G. Heistand collected and stored 40 tons of items, such as stones to be polished and petrified wood, for his store in 1890. The \\"avid collector of mineral specimens\\" operated a curio shop near the cog railway station. Days after his death in 1916, his stone collection was described as interesting and valuable. The Iron Springs Chateau Melodrama Theater was built over the capped Ute Iron Spring and began offering dinner theater entertainment in 1964 and continues to do so. Hiestand and R.D. Weir leased the \\"new casino\\" near the Manitou and Pike's Peak Cog Railway depot and the Ute Iron Spring in 1895. They made extensive additions to the existing property, including adding a bowling alley, billiard rooms, dancing floor made of hard maple, and built an additional building. The two buildings were connected by an ornamental bridge on the second stories. It was extravagantly furnished. A Hydro-Electric Plant was built in 1905 at 540 Ruxton Avenue. It has a formal, modern fa√ßade of red brick with two large arched windows with fanlights on the front of the building. The plant, now called the Manitou Hydroelectric plant, is one of two plants that generate electricity for the City of Colorado Springs from water that flows through the Ruxton Creek watershed. The other is the Ruxton Hydroelectric plant. After water has been processed by the hydroelectric plants, it flows to the Mesa water treatment plant. The Manitou Incline was built in 1907 to support the Hydro-Electric Plant operations. Materials were transported uphill to build pipelines on Pikes Peak. When the construction project was completed, the trail was converted to a cable car attraction to take visitors to the top of Mount Manitou, where there was a picnic area and refreshment stand. In 1990, the track was damaged during a rock slide and the incline was closed and the rails removed. In 2013, it was opened as a one mile hiking trail, with a ascent. Our Lady of Perpetual Help Catholic Church, located at 218 Ruxton Avenue, was built in 1889. The church was destroyed in a fire in 1903, and rebuilt within three months. The church is now a small Gothic and Shingle style church, with a greenstone bridge that crosses over Ruxton Creek. Annexation The road up Ruxton Creek (Ruxton Avenue) was annexed to Iron Springs in September 1880. Portions of Iron Springs were annexed to Manitou in February 1887, August 1893, and May 1934.

Life  Zef Pllumi was born as Prenka Pllumi on 28 August 1924, in the Mali i Rencit, Sh√´ngjin, in a family of Shkreli origin. As he says in his autobiographical book My infancy saga, his mother Luke Mrija gave birth to him in a field. In his early years, in Qaf√´ of T√´thores (located in Bog√´, on the Shkreli mountains), he met Gjergj Fishta and Anton Harapi, who would come to meet through his uncle Pashko Toma. In one of those meetings, Pashko told Harapi that the little boy wanted to become a friar. Father Harapi gave him a medallion of Saint Francis that he was wearing around his neck and told Pllumi to conserve it with a lot of care and present it one day at the Franciscan College of Scutari, where he would later pursue his studies as a young friar.Fran√ßeskanet e mdhaj, Si e njoha Fishten.

Marketing for the film included a media tour of part of the set and an invitation-only screening sponsored by the publisher of MacGrath's book. The Carpet from Bagdad was released on May 3, 1915 to mostly positive reviews. Many praised the tinted desert scenes and realistic Middle East imagery, although some felt the scenery overshadowed the characters. The film is now mostly lost, although one badly damaged reel was salvaged from the RMS Lusitania in 1982. Plot Newspaper ad for the film. Horace Wadsworth, disinherited brother of New York banker Arthur Wadsworth, joins a gang of international criminals. He plots to rob his brother's bank by constructing a tunnel from the nearby home of antique dealer George Jones, who is currently on a trip to Cairo to purchase antique rugs. Horace follows him there, and, learning of the Sacred Carpet of Bagdad, joins the caravan of its sworn guardian, Mohamed. Meanwhile, Horace's confederates Major Callahan and Mrs. Chedsoye arrive in Cairo along with Mrs. Chedsoye's daughter, Fortune, who is unaware of her mother's illicit activities. When the criminals meet with Jones in Cairo, Jones becomes enamored of Fortune. Horace steals the Sacred Carpet from Mohamed's mosque and sells it to Jones to fund the robbery plan. Fortune, becoming suspicious of her mother and the surrounding events, steals the prayer rug from Jones and hides it in her mother's effects. Unable to locate the stolen carpet, Mohamed kidnaps Horace, Jones, and Fortune. Meanwhile, Mrs. Chedsoye and Major Callahan return to New York, where a fourth member of the conspiracy, Wallace, has acquired forged paperwork to gain access to the Jones residence. The captives escape from Mohamed's planned torture and flee to Damascus. Horace immediately returns to New York to rejoin his compatriots. Fortune and Jones, who have fallen in love, also travel back to New York. Once there, Jones learns of the forgery, and returns home to confront the gang, who still have the Sacred Carpet and who have completed their tunnel into the vaults of Arthur Wadsworth's bank. Sympathetic to Horace after their shared experiences, Jones offers the robbers a two-hour lead before he notifies the police, but keeps the prayer rug. Meanwhile, Mohamed resigns himself to the loss of the carpet. Cast * Kathlyn Williams as Fortune Chedsoye * Wheeler Oakman as George P.A.

MacGrath was a well-traveled, successful author of over a dozen novels. Stories with Asian settings were in vogue at the time, and both The Carpet from Bagdad and the Selig Polyscope Company's previous adaptation of MacGrath's work, the popular serial The Adventures of Kathlyn, are set in part in the Near East. Director Colin Campbell was concerned with the film's realism. He had sets constructed to represent the streets of Cairo, Baghdad, and Damascus, and used animals from the Selig Zoo. Scenes set in the Arabian and Sahara Deserts were filmed in the deserts of California. The Arab characters' clothing was genuine, and the actors portraying those roles were required to remain dressed in-character throughout the several days of desert filming to ensure they would appear more natural in the imported garments. Much of the film, including the desert scenes, was hand tinted. Production costs exceeded $35,000, the equivalent of over $ in present-day terms. William Selig aggressively promoted his studio and its films. One such promotion, a March 1915 media tour of the unfinished Selig Zoo, allowed reporters a visit to The Carpet from Bagdad's bazaar set. This was the first film distributed by V-L-S-E, a conglomerate created by Vitagraph Studios, Lubin Manufacturing Company, Selig Polyscope Company, and Essanay Studios. The film was also screened in a special invitation-only showing at the art gallery of the Bobbs- Merrill Company, publisher of MacGrath's novel, an early example of a sponsored exhibition of a feature film in a location other than a theater. Reception Guy Oliver and Wheeler Oakman in a scene with the Sacred Carpet of Bagdad The Carpet from Bagdad was released on May 3, 1915, to generally positive reviews. Variety described it as a more interesting film than its title might imply, with \\"perfect direction and faultless acting\\". Peter Milne of Motion Picture News approved of Campbell's attention to detail and realism. The Moving Picture World's James McQuade praised the film's acting and special effects. Although he believed an unfilmed Cairo scene made Mohamed's motivations easier to understand in the novel, he considered the film a \\"close second\\" to Campbell's 1914 The Spoilers. Clarence Caine's review in Motography also compared The Carpet from Bagdad favorably to The Spoilers, but he viewed the film's color as its best feature, especially the closing scene of a desert sunset. Several newspaper reviews also complimented the tinted desert scenes, with New Zealand's The Levin Chronicle describing the film as \\"a gem of the cinematographer's art\\" for its use of color. The Chicago Daily Tribune offered a more mixed opinion on the film; reviewer Kitty Kelly found it difficult to care about characters \\"overshadowed by environment\\", and considered the 35-year-old Williams unconvincing as an ingenue. Despite the acclaim from many contemporary reviewers, modern scholars of the silent film era would not consider The Carpet from Bagdad a masterpiece, according to the British Film Institute's Clyde Jeavons. Partial rediscovery Like many films from the silent era, The Carpet from Bagdad was believed completely lost, but in 1982 an Oceaneering International diving expedition salvaged a number of artifacts from the wreck of the RMS Lusitania, including one reel of film. With the assistance of BBC technical advisor Laurie Ward, the BFI National Archive was able to recover images from several feet of the film, sufficient to identify the title, but not to restore any of the film to projectable condition. Although there was a theater on Lusitania, this print of The Carpet from Bagdad was probably being taken to London as a film distributor's preview, as was the case for several other films known to have been on board.

Media management contains the functions strategic management, procurement management, production management, organizational management and marketing of media enterprises. A uniform definition of the term media management does not yet exist, and \\"the field of media management in its present form is neither clearly defined nor cohesive.\\"K√ºng (2008) Notwithstanding this fact, among existing definitions there is a shared base concerning the business administrative character of media management and the functional understanding of management. In the following a number of definitions are provided. \\"Media Management consists of (1) the ability to supervise and motivate employees and (2) the ability to operate facilities and resources in a cost-effective (profitable) manner.\\"Sherman (1995) \\"The core task of media management is to build a bridge between the general theoretical disciplines of management and the specifities of the media industry.\\" \\"Media and internet management covers all the goal- oriented activities of planning, organization and control within the framework of the creation and distribution processes for information or entertainment content in media enterprises.\\"Wirtz (2011a) Media professionals need strong commercial, strategic, and managerial skills to be successful in an industry constantly undergoing fundamental changes. This Masters programme equips you with these skills, next to providing you with entrepreneurial leadership qualities. Additionally, students are trained to deal with the complex challenges presented by new technologies, learn about consumer behaviour, and analyse evolving business models  Media enterprises and media markets  Media enterprises are strategically organized economic entities whose central work is generating and marketing of media. The generation of media is the bundling of internally and externally generated content and its transformation into a medium. The marketing is the direct or indirect distribution of media. The term media in this connection is restricted to one-to-many-communication with one sender and a large number of consumers. More precisely, the focus is on newspapers, magazines, books, music, television, films, internet and games. More details can be drawn from the graphic illustrating the definition of media enterprises. Image shows the definition of media companies. In order to understand management in media enterprises it is crucial to build a larger picture of the media marketplace. The characteristics of media markets differ from markets of other economic sectors in several ways. One characteristic of media markets is the multidimensional competition. Media enterprises operate in three different markets. They sell their services in form of content like information and entertainment, as well as in form of advertising space. These services are offered for different business markets. The content is offered to the consumer markets which differ depending of the type of media and the way it is used by consumers. The advertising spaces are traded on advertisement markets. The third markets are procurement markets. They are needed as media enterprises generally do not produce all their offered content themselves but buy service packages of both, information and entertainment, from procurement markets. For example, authors and artists contracts or license and copyright deals can be acquired. But procurement markets can turn to business markets if, for example, complete rights to an event are purchased and then resold by a media enterprise in the form of secondary utilization rights. The described market structure is shown in the second image. Image gives an overview of different media markets. In fact, the three described media markets each media enterprise can be active in are strongly interdependent. But the intensity of their relationships differs. For example, there is a strong relationship between advertisement and consumer markets as the success among consumers drives advertising revenues. All possible inter-dependencies are pictured in the third graphic. Image describes the inter-dependencies in media markets Furthermore, there are geographic media markets. Media enterprises operate in specific geographic markets. Some firms operate in a national market while other companies, for example, local radio stations operate in a regional area. So the marketplace of a media enterprise consists of the product media markets (consumer market, advertisement market and procurement market) and the geographic media market.  Value chain and core competencies  The value chain analysis by Michael PorterPorter (2004), p. 35 can be adapted for the analysis of value creation in media enterprises. Although the media sector is very heterogeneous and has different branch-specific features, the presented value chain of the media industry form the basic principles. Image describing the value chain of the media industry. As for business companies in general, for media enterprises their core assets and core competencies are decisive for the long-term success. Core competencies considerably contribute to the perceived customer benefit of a product and ensure the competitive advantage of an enterprise. Competencies which are crucial to successful media management can be classified as technical skills, human skills, conceptual skills, financial skills and marketing skills.Albarran (2010), p. 12 Core competencies of media enterprises are, for example, an exceptional editorial ability or cross-media marketing competence. There are six subgroups of core competencies of media enterprises: content-sourcing competence, content- creation competence, product development competence, promotion competence, cross-media utilization competence and technology competence. The content- sourcing competence means acquisition of high-quality information and/or entertainment content for content production. Especially the production of exclusive content leads to unique competitive advantage. Content-creation competence is one of the most important core competences in most media enterprises. Media enterprises with content-creation competences are, for example, especially good at realizing social trends and implementing them into their media products, making them highly attractive for the customers. The product development competence is the qualification for a product portfolio with a steady flow of revenues. In order to achieve this, media enterprises have to be able to develop promising media products and to assess their marketability. The promotion competence is specifically relevant for media products belonging to the film, book or music categories as these are individual products. Here a different promotion strategy than promotion of brand identity is needed. Achieving public attention and thus a better market position for media products constitutes the promotion competence. Media enterprises with cross-media utilization competences can provide content to the recipients in a timely manner, in the desired amount and via the right channel. Finally the technology competence refers to the employment of modern information and communication technology for the creation and marketing of content. Core competences form the foundation for the strategy formation process in media enterprises. For their future success, the media enterprises have to analyze the current competence basis and compare them with the required, strategically important, core competences derived from an external market analysis. There is a range of different influences on the media management decisions and actions that have to be included in the external market analysis. The influences are \\"the licensee, competing media, the government, the labor force, the labor unions, the public, and advertisers, economic activity, the industry, social factor and technology.\\"Pringle and Starr (2006), p.27 In case some strategically important core competencies are not yet acquired by the media enterprise, they have to be developed.  Business models  The concept of the business model is not used uniformly in the literature. Compared to the concept of the value chain, it is not limited to a physical production process. It also includes service processes. According to Timmers, \\"a business model is defined as the organization (or architecture) of product, service and information flows, and the sources of revenues and benefits for suppliers and customers.\\"Timmers (2001), p. 31 According to Wirtz, \\"a business model is a simplified and aggregated representation of the relevant activities of a company. It describes how marketable information, products and/or services are generated by means of a company's value-added component. In addition to the architecture of value creation, strategic as well as customer and market components are considered in order to realize the overriding objective of generating and preserving a competitive advantage.\\"Wirtz (2011b), p.65 The business model as an integrated management tool consists of further partial models: the revenue model, the consumer model, the procurement model, the production of goods and services model, the service offer model and the distribution model. Because a business model can strongly vary depending on the type of business, it can best be described using a sample. In the following the business model of a book publishing house is presented. Book publishers are companies that have two components to consider: profit-orientation and a cultural dimension. They usually publish titles which are produced by external authors. The sales of books in the receiver markets are the main part of the revenue model of a book publisher. Other revenues can be generated in the rights and licensing markets. Further sources for revenues are utilization rights generating revenue outside of the printing sector. For example, successful manuscripts are used for film, television, magazines and merchandising. Image describing an example business model of a book publishing house. For book publishers, production and distribution are the main focuses of the economic activity. Here the cost structure of manufacturing is of high importance. The amount of first copy costs in relation to total revenue is around 41%. Marketing costs are about 12% and administrative costs average 14%, with a profit margin of approximately 5%.Wirtz (2011b), p. 178 The final product is delivered through existing distribution channels. With the rise of the internet, new distribution channels with direct delivery to book consumers have been developed. The business model of a book publishing house is shown in the graphic.

He was Head of the Urology Section of the Department of Surgery at the University of Michigan Medical School in Ann Arbor, Michigan, from 1930‚Äì1967.University of Michigan, Regents' Proceedings 1602. Memoir: Reed M. Nesbit. Nesbit was a pioneer of transurethral resection of the prostate. He devised the ‚ÄòNesbit operation‚Äô for treating Peyronie's disease, and he made prominent contributions to pediatric urology, most notably the Cabot-Nesbit style orchiopexy. Life and career Nesbit was born in Concord, California, and studied first at the University of California, then at Stanford University, where he earned his AB in 1921 and MD in 1924. He interned at the Fresno County Hospital in Fresno, California, before he was recruited to Michigan by Hugh Cabot, the Director of Surgery at the University of Michigan and a prominent genitourinary surgeon. During his first year in Michigan Nesbit shared a room with Charles Huggins, another Cabot recruit who later went on to win a Nobel prize for his work on hormonal control of prostate cancer. In 1926 Nesbit became an Instructor in Surgery. In 1929 he was promoted to Assistant Professor, and a year later he became Chief of the Section of Urology. In 1943 he attained the rank of professor. He served as Head of the Urology Section of the Department of Surgery for 37 years. His work at Michigan brought him national and international fame. By the end of his tenure his advances in surgical procedures and techniques were recorded in over 150 articles. He was at the forefront of endoscopic surgery to treat prostatic disease, and his 1943 textbook, Transurethral Prostatectomy, became the standard textbook on this subject in the United States. He also published the textbook Fundamentals of Urology in 1942. Many surgeons throughout the United States and all over the world came to Ann Arbor to learn his innovative techniques. In 1957 he established a pioneering dialysis unit at the University of Michigan, unusual in that it was run by surgeons, not internists. Nesbit became President of the American College of Surgeons in 1967, the first urologist to hold that position. He trained over 80 residents, at least 18 of whom became chiefs of urology in medical schools in the United States and abroad. After Nesbit retired in 1968 he moved to El Macero, California, where he served as lecturer of surgery and special assistant to the dean at the University of California, Davis School of Medicine. In 1969 Nesbit became chairman of the Board of Commissioners of the Joint Commission on Accreditation of Hospitals. In 2007 the Reed Nesbit Professorship in Urology was established at the University of Michigan in his honor, with Dr. Edward J. McGuire serving as the first Nesbit Professor. The Reed M. Nesbit Urologic Society is the alumni organization of the Department of Urology at the University of Michigan and was constituted in 1972. The membership of the society includes residents who trained at Michigan, clinical fellows, faculty, and selected others. The society meets each year in Ann Arbor and also at the annual meeting of the American Urological Association.

It is one of three canyons in Manitou Springs, the others are Ute Pass and Williams Canyon. Upper Englemann Canyon In 1880, a trail was opened in Englemann Canyon to Pikes Peak. It was called the Manitou Trail in 1883. Zalmon Simmons surveyed the canyon for telegraph lines. The Civil War veteran and later inventor of the Simmons mattress decided that the canyon was suited for construction of a cog railway. The Manitou and Pike's Peak Railway, built by Simmons and completed in 1890, begins in Englemann Canyon and follows Ruxton Creek up into the Rocky Mountains for Pikes Peak. The railroad climbs at a 6% grade through the canyon past \\"stately spruces and jagged rocks\\". The first third of the railway trip is through Englemann Canyon, alongside Ruxton Creek. Scenery includes large boulders, Ponderosa pine trees, Englemann spruce, and Colorado blue spruce. Sights in the canyon include Artist Glen, Minnehaha Falls, Son- of-a-Gun Hill, Hells Gate, the site of Halfway House, and Ruxton Park. Artist Glen was the 160 acre home and bed and breakfast along Ruxton Creek of artist and photographer William Hook and his family during the late 19th century. Some of its guests were delivered by burros via a Pikes Pike burro trail near their home. The accommodations became less desirable when the cog railway was built about 30 feet from the house. The Halfway House was a rustic hotel that served tourists who took the railway. Minnehaha, named for its falls, was a hamlet with several cabins. In 1891, the canyon was described in The Illustrated American as \\"a narrow valley, with a steep mountain rising on either side, and the clear, sparkling Ruxton Creek rushing parallel to the track, sometimes dashing over rocks hundreds of feet below the train, and sometimes pausing for a moment to form a deep, smooth pool, such as the speckled trout loves to haunt.\\" File:Pike's Peak and Manitou Railway.jpgManitou and Pike's Peak Railway depot on Ruxton Avenue, 1894 File:Halfway House, Pike's Peak, Colorado.jpgHalfway House, Ruxton Park, Colorado, by 1915 File:Manitou and Pike's Peak Railway 001.jpgManitou and Pike's Peak Railway, 2006 In 1925, a water utility power plant was built in Ruxton Park for $16,866 by the city of Colorado Springs. The stone hydroelectric plant generates electricity as Ruxton Creek flows into Manitou Springs from the mountain. Lower Englemann Canyon In the early 20th century, an electric trolley of the Colorado Springs and Interurban Railway from Colorado Springs terminated at Manitou Springs, and a trolley, called the \\"Dinky\\" carried passengers up lower Englemann Canyon (Ruxton Road) to the Manitou and Pike's Peak Railway depot. In 1891 the canyon had one spring, the Ute-Iron spring, Near the depot there were three mineral springs in 1913: Ute- Iron, Little Chief, and Ouray springs. near the Iron Springs Hotel. The current Manitou Mineral Springs on Ruxton Avenue are Iron Spring and Twin Spring.

A preacher at the Berlin Cathedral from 1914 to 1960, Doehring was a popular figure in the Evangelical Church of the old-Prussian Union in Berlin. He was a strict conservative and was active in the Weimar Republic as a politician. Life and work=Early years Doehring was born the son of a farmer. After attending elementary school in Mohrungen and the Royal Grammar School in Elbing, he studied theology at the universities of Halle, Berlin and K√∂nigsberg. In 1906 Doehring was a pastor in Tiefensee in East Prussia, where he started a family and his son Johannes was born, and in 1908 he was a pastor in Fischau in West Prussia. After receiving his doctorate in 1911, Doehring gained the attention of Georg zu Dohna (1852‚Äì1912) through his involvement with Arthur Drews. Dohna hired him as a pastor in Finckenstein Palace. The conservative politician Elard von Oldenburg-Januschau belonged to Doehring's parish, and they became friends. After Dohna's death Doehring took over the management of the seminary in Wittenburg. For unexplained reasons, Kaiser Wilhelm II asked Doehring to give a sample sermon on April 1, 1914, with an eye to filling the recently vacant position of fourth chaplain at the Berlin Cathedral. After the sermon, an enthusiastic Wilhelm gave Doehring the position over competing candidate F. K. Otto Dibelius. Doehring was known to the general public thanks to an open-air church service he gave to an audience of tens of thousands of believers on the steps of the Reichstag building on August 2, 1914, at the outbreak of the First World War. His sermon was a call to stand firmly and fearlessly together under the leadership of the Kaiser, with loyalty and with faith in God, through all the suffering that was to come. It was widely reprinted. As a preacher, Doehring combined eloquence with education and populism, and was not afraid of \\"kitsch sentimentalism\\".Wilhelm H√ºffmeier: Die Hof- und Domprediger als Theologen [The preacher at the cathedral and court as a theologian] (hereafter \\"H√ºffmeier\\"), in: Pl√∂se (see below), pp. 139-154, here p. 151 He saw preaching as \\"always concrete, never abstract\\" and wanted to be like Martin Luther and never shy away from the problems of his time.Lebensweg, p. 143ff. The texts of his sermons were available in printed form to his audience immediately after the service, and could be bought for ten pfennig. Beginning in 1923, Doehring took on the additional position of official lecturer in practical theology at the University of Berlin. Doehring, who had discounted the growing discontent and longing for peace during the war, was taken completely aback by the people's revolutionary riots of 1918. In his condemnation of the January strikes, Doehring spoke of betrayal and may have been the first to evoke the stab-in- the-back legend, which held that Germany lost the First World War not for military reasons but due to unpatriotic elements at home. Doehring blamed the subsequent defeat in the war and the following November Revolution and claimed that these events were caused by the decline in Germany's Christian faith and values. For him, most of the blame lay with the Catholic Church and the socialist labor movement. He envisioned a reformation along the lines of Luther's as a solution for Germany. Politics December 12, 1933 in Berlin following the church service commemorating the opening of the Reichstag. Bruno Doehring is on the right next to President Hindenburg, wearing a robe. On the left, Reich Bishop Ludwig M√ºller. The Cathedral parish, largely composed of members of the Prussian bureaucracy and related members of the court, together with the status of the Berlin Cathedral as one of the state's representative places of worship, afforded Doehring the opportunity to lend his opinions unmistakable prestige in the middle of the German capital. By December 1918 Doehring had already lent his support to the German National People's Party (DNVP) in a call to vote. Doehring criticized the November Revolution and its aftermath as a \\"de-Christianization\\" and thus a \\"deadening\\" of the political system. His daily pointed sermons were repeatedly criticized both in the democratic press and in statements of displeasure by prominent personalities. Gustav Stresemann saw in them \\"not ... an expression of Christian charity, but ... an increasingly frenzied aversion to dissent\\"Stresemann quoted in Gerhard Besier: Der Dom ohne Kaiser. Der Dom in der Weimarer Republik und im Dritten Reich [The cathedral without the Kaiser. The cathedral in the Weimar Republic and the Third Reich], in: Pl√∂se, pp. 197-209, here p. 200 and in 1924 Karl Barth called Doehring a \\"miserable cream puff\\" and a \\"theological buffoon\\".Barth quoted in H√ºffmeier, p. 151 In 1924 Doehring took over the chairmanship of the Evangelical Alliance to Preserve German-Protestant Interests (EB). His appointment to this position was not unanimously approved by the alliance's members. His insistence on uncritical attachment to the abdicated Kaiser and his rigid hostility towards the Catholic Church contributed to the increasing isolation of the Protestant church in German society, and in particular in relationship to the proletariat and to bourgeois democracy. Doehring also refused increasingly urgent prospective interdenominational political cooperation with state-preserving Catholic forces, which had been drifting towards the Center Party and the DNVP since the end of 1926. Following the withdrawal of Adolf von Harnack and Otto Baumgarten, the conflict over the direction of the EB culminated in Doehring's resignation in February 1927. Doehring then founded the Lutherring f√ºr aktives Christentum. Under his leadership, in January 1928, it developed into the German Reformation Party, in his words \\"to curb the hopeless fragmentation of national forces\\".Quotation and more in Herbert Gottwald: Deutsche Reformationspartei (DReP) 1928 [The German Reformation Party (DReP) 1928] in: Dieter Fricke with Manfred Wei√übecker, Siegfried Schmidt, Herbert Gottwald and Werner Fritsch (ed.): Lexikon zur Parteiengeschichte.

In four volumes], Leipzig VEB Bibliographic Institute, Leipzig, 1984, Volume 2, German League for the League of Nations - General Association of Christian trade unions of Germany pp. 60-62, here p. 61 Its consistently anti-modern, monarchical and nationalist party program resonated little among Protestants. The German Reformation Party took part in the 1928 general elections as part of the V√∂lkisch National Bloc, but with only 266,000 votes (just 0.87%) it was denied entry to the Reichstag. That same year, Doehring came up with the idea and screenplay for the movie Luther. In the 1930 general election, Doehring affiliated himself with the DNVP in his capacity as chairman of the Lutherrings, and won a seat in the electoral district Chemnitz-Zwickau, which he held in the following three legislative sessions, until November 1933. Doehring remained loyal to the Kaiser, visiting him in Huis Doorn and preaching there, for the last time in 1939 on the occasion of his 80th birthday. The Comforter of Berlin In the emerging Nazi movement Doehring saw a reprehensible attempt to create a new religion. In his 1932 paper The miscarriage of the national movement by Adolf Hitler, he repudiated \\"the idolatry of racism, anti-Semitism, and the manipulation of the masses.\\"Summary in H√ºffmeier, p. 150 Doehring, along with a minority of the Cathedral Council, voted against the holding of an SA memorial in the cathedral for SA leader Hans Maikowski and a police officer, both of whom were killed in a street battle during a parade celebrating Hitler's seizure of power. He personally denied the Nazi-affiliated German Christians use of the cathedral for their services. Nevertheless, he kept his distance from the anti-Nazi Confessing Church, preaching solitude. Doehring's sermons were closely monitored by the Gestapo, who repeatedly questioned him about his public criticism of the Nazi regime.For Doehring in the Nazi era, with several witness reports: Hans-Rainer Sandvo√ü: Widerstand in Mitte und Tiergarten, 2., ver√§nderte und erweiterte Auflage [Resistance in Mitte and Tiergarten, changed and expanded 2nd edition] (Volume 8 of the series about the resistance in Berlin from 1933 to 1945), Memorial to German Resistance, Berlin 1999, pp. 212-214 and 300, for the political reasons leading to his resignation as a university lecturer, p 238 He did not mention Hitler in prayer, and in a May 1940 sermon which the regime had decreed should give thanks for victory he instead preached repentance. As the war progressed his sermons took on more and more of a comforting character, combining biblical criticism with thinly-veiled indictment of Hitler and his party comrades. Starting in 1940-41 their printing was prevented by the state and Doehring lost his teaching position. He considered the war and its suffering to be a result of the November Revolution, which in turn had made it possible for Hitler to rise to power and sit \\"on the throne of Satan.\\"In Lebensweg [Journey], on the importance of the November Revolution p 94ff., for the \\"ruler of the world\\" and on the \\"chair of Satan\\" quotes see his Christmas sermon 1936, pp. 160-171, here p 169 Following a bombing on May 24, 1944, the Berlin Cathedral was no longer usable for worship. Doehring first preached in the Church of St. Sophia, and then in a large catacomb-like underground vault, created under the cathedral by the cathedral parish, which was capable of seating around one thousand two hundred worshipers. After an interruption caused by the war, Doehring returned to the pulpit on September 2, 1945 with a sermon on \\"the savior of the world and world peace\\".On the origin of the catacomb church and the sermons Doehring gave there, see Julius Schneider: Die Geschichte des Berliner Doms seit seiner Zerst√∂rung im Zweiten Weltkrieg von der Domkanzel aus gesehen [The Story of the Berlin Cathedral following its destruction in World War II as seen from the pulpit], Domkirchenamt, Berlin, 1986, pp. 7-12 Due to his criticism of the government during both the Weimar and Nazi eras, Doehring had been passed over three times for the position of head chaplain of the cathedral. In the post-war era of divided Berlin, this changed. He won and held this position in Berlin's eastern sector from 1945 until his retirement in 1960, and resumed his position as a university professor at Humboldt University from 1946 to 1953.From the entry in Friedrich Wilhelm Bautz (Ed. and eds.): Biographisch- Bibliographisches Kirchenlexikon. Fortgef√ºhrt von Traugott Bautz [Biographic- bibliographic church encyclopedia. Updated by Traugott Bautz], Volume 1, published by Traugott Bautz, Hamm, 1975, p. 1334 The title of head chaplain no longer had any formal meaning at this point, as Dibelius had given himself the title of Bishop of Berlin-Brandenburg and made St. Mary's Church the seat of his diocese. Doehring's seat was no longer the center of Protestant worship in Germany, nor was it as prestigious a venue for events. The occupying Allied forces, and later the government of the GDR, discouraged worship, and multiple threats to the cathedral's continued existence were posed by the GDR's city planning.Manfred Stolpe: Die Evangelische Kirche in der DDR und der Wiederaufbau des Doms [The Protestant Church in the GDR and the reconstruction of the cathedral], in: P√∂se, pp. 211-219, here p. 211 The cathedral, still damaged by the war, was not repaired. Doehring preached tirelessly every Sunday in his underground vault, in which he had installed a Schuke Organ in 1946, consistently drawing an audience of a thousand worshipers. He kept his reputation as the comforter of Berlin, which he had acquired during the bombing of the city, until his retirement in 1960.For the term \\"the comforter of Berlin\\", see H√ºffmeier p. 150 Four months after his death, the construction of the Berlin Wall split the Cathedral Parish, and in 1975, the demolition of his vault in the catacombs followed. In the words of William H√ºffmeier, Doehring was \\"in life really an individualist, a loner, unclassifiable\\", but with his sermons he reached more believers than any other minister in Berlin. As a gift for his 80th birthday, he was presented with a statistic showing that he had preached in front of about four million people over the course of his life.H√ºffmeier, p. 150 His tomb is located in Domfriedhof II on M√ºllerstra√üe in Berlin-Wedding.

Kemin sarjakuvakeskus, Kemi 1996. The titular character Rymy-Eetu is a strong, heavily built man, who is capable of apparently superhuman actions both in wartime and in peacetime. Characters Rymy-Eetu was named after his strength and virility, although he was never much of a troublemaker. Sometimes he even seems to control the forces of nature. Sometimes his boisterous character gets him into trouble, but even in tight spots he always manages to keep smoking his pipe. Rymy-Eetu's frequent antagonist is his cousin Kalle Kuikkaneva, a short man wearing eyeglasses, who sometimes wins over Rymy-Eetu because of his cleverness. Appearance Rymy- Eetu first appeared in Nuori Voima in 1930. At that time the character didn't have a name. After this, the comic appeared in Kansan Kuvalehti, where Ilmari Turja invented a name for the new hero. Rymy-Eetu appeared, with short breaks, for about four decades.Tanttu, Erkki: Rymy-Eetu uljaimmillaan. Otava 1984, Keuruu. .

In the albums, Tauno Karilas added rhyming text to the comics, which wasn't present in the original strips.Suomen Sarjakuvaseura - MIKSI ERKKI TANTULLE? Tanttu seldom wrote any text to his comic, but instead let the images do the talking. Sometimes a speech bubble helped in the narrative. In wartime, Rymy-Eetu was used in propaganda. Rymy-Eetu crushed his Russian enemies completely in the comics. After the Moscow armistice, the Finnish publishing association sent a request to book stores to withdraw 288 works from display and sales. Along these works were the albums Rymy-Eetu ja Hymy-Freetu and Rymy-Eetun jymyvoitto.Kielletyt kirjat, kotimainen kirjasensuuri In 1999, Otava published a collection album called Rymy-Eetu ryss√§n kauhu, which included all four Rymy-Eetu albums published during wartime.

He attended Osgoode Hall Law School in Toronto and was called to the Bar of Ontario in 1920. His interest in fine art began with the purchase of a watercolour by English artist Dame Laura Knight in the early 1920s. Not long afterward, he encountered a painting by Homer Watson and purchased The Lothian Hills (1892) directly from the artist in installments, a practice he would follow in many transactions. Despite numerous subsequent acquisitions, the oil painting by Watson remained a lifelong favorite. Sam Weir died in 1981, leaving his collection and estate to the Weir Foundation, incorporated in 1962.Masson, Mary Willan. The Consummate Canadian: A Biography of Samuel Weir Q.C. Toronto: Natural Heritage, 1999  Architecture and Design  Weir purchased land in Queenston in 1943 and began construction on the site in the late 1950s. The country residence and coach house were designed by English-born architect Arthur E. Nutter (1874-1967), a family friend and the first architect to practice in London, Ontario. Weir contributed significantly to the design, requesting details such as a fall-out shelter in the basement and a self-contained apartment over the coach house. For the main building, Nutter adapted a Georgian-style complete with mansard roof and gabled windows. The interior rooms retain their original wood paneling, installed by finish- carpenter Alexander Kiss, who used a variety of different woods, including maple, mahogany, oak, knotty pine, and walnut, with clear pine and birch ceilings. The home was completed in 1970 and converted into an art museum following Weir‚Äôs death. In 1996, a large porch on the east side of the building was replaced by additional exhibition space.

It contains a single species, Katepensaurus goicoecheai. Discovery Dorsal vertebrae Katepensaurus was first described and named by Lucio M. Ibiricu, Gabriel A. Casal, Rub√©n Dario Mart√≠nez, Matthew C. Lamanna, Marcelo Luna and Leonardo Salgado in 2013 and the type species is Katepensaurus goicoecheai. It is known solely from the holotype, a partial axial skeleton that includes cervical, dorsal, and caudal vertebrae, found in close association. The holotype, UNPSJB-PV 1007, was collected from the Bajo Barreal Formation, dating to the Cenomanian or Turonian stage of the Late Cretaceous. The generic name is derived from Tehuelche katepenk, \\"hole\\", referring to a distinctive opening in the transverse processes of the dorsal vertebrae. The specific name honours Alejandro Goicoechea, the owner of the Estancia Laguna Palacios where the fossil was found. Description The dorsal vertebrae of Katepensaurus were found to be unique among other sauropods, exhibiting five autapomorphies, i.e. unique traits. Lateral pneumatic fossa of the centrum (the central part of a vertebra) is divided by internal laminas. On the lateral surface of the vertebrae, overlying the neurocentral junction, vertical ridges or crests are present. A pair of laminae is present in parapophyseal centrodiapophyseal fossa. There are a well-defined, rounded fossae on lateral aspect of postzygapophyses. Finally, transverse processes are perforated by elliptical fenestrae on the vertebrae. Katepensaurus was assigned to Limaysaurinae, a subfamily of rebbachisaurid diplodocoid, based on the presence of traits that were found to diagnose limaysaurines in previous phylogenetic analyses.

It is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index. History The company was founded by Horace Anderton Clarkson in London in 1852. The son of a prosperous lawyer, he invited Leon Benham, a former colleague, to join him in partnership. Benham's son Henry soon joined the business. In the 1850s the business involved sailing ships, but by the 1860s the company was chartering steam ships. In 1872 Clarksons became shipowners with the acquisition of three schooners. The company became the world's largest tanker broker in 1929 when Esso appointed Clarksons as its exclusive shipbroker. The first overseas office opened in New York City in 1954. Offices soon followed in France, Australia and Germany, and in the 1960s, South Africa and Greece. Expansion in the Far East began in the 1990s when companies were established in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Singapore. Carron Greig became joint managing director in 1962, served as chairman of the shipbroking division from 1972 to 1985, and as chairman of the whole group, then known as Horace Clarkson, until his retirement in 1993. He was credited with transforming the group into a world leader in its field. The company became a global force and Greig increased its business, especially with Esso, bringing in Brazil, Norway and the Far East to its portfolio. He also fought off Russian and English corporate raiders in the 1970s. The company spun off various diversified assets as Shipping Industrial Holdings in 1974. Michael Wade, a prominent insurance executive, sat on the board from 1984 to 1993 and Peter Parker, a leading industrial executive, sat on the board from 1971 until 1993. Richard Fulford-Smith became chief executive of the company in 2004. According to Robert Wright of the Financial Times, he was central to Clarkson's emergence as the world's largest sale and purchase shipbroker. Fulford-Smith was ousted from the board in 2008 after Russian litigation claims emerged against the company. Until March 2012, Martin Stopford, a prominent economist, sat on the board and was head of the research arm of the company. In 2013, Clarkson acquired Gibb Tools, a North Sea oil engineering tools supplier, for ¬£12.7 million. In 2015, Clarkson acquired RS Platou AS, a Norwegian headed shipbroking and investment banking group. Operations Clarkson operations are divided into four areas: broking, financial, support and research. The company brokers vessels for some of the world's largest producers and traders of natural resources. Clarkson Research Services focuses primarily on the collection, validation, analysis and management of data about the merchant shipping and offshore markets. The chief executive since 2008 has been Andi Case. William (Bill) Thomas was appointed as Chair on 13 February 2019. The company has its headquarters at Commodity Quay, St Katharine Docks, London.

Born in Vryburg and brought up in the rural areas of Mafikeng in the North West Province, her fascination about films was triggered at an early age. Growing up in the apartheid era and seeing the negative portrayal images of black South Africans and the lack of participation of black women in a media industry dominated by white males, this reinvigorated her to want to make change, however it was not an easy dream to fulfill due to race restrictions at the time. Ntsoma attended St Mary's High School where she would be introduced to music, dance and drama, this is where she knew her career path was different from her peers. Despite several setbacks throughout her life she kept on pursuing her dream of being a photographer and succeeded. Ntsoma is known for her photographs that stand out for the odd angles from which they are taken and the way she plays with what is in focus in the photos and what is not. Besides being an award-winning photographer she has become an enthusiastic mentor for young photojournalists. Early years  Born in Vryburg and brought up in the rural areas of Mafikeng in the North West Province. Ntsoma is last of the third children born to Olefile Ntsoma and Nomalanga Maria Ntsoma n√©e Hlabangane. Photography is a profession she fell into by accident, a profession not known for black women at that time. Ntsoma began her studies at Peninsula Technikon in 1992. Her initial interest was in Film and Television. she never picked up a camera prior to her enrolment at the Technikon. She later moved to Pretoria Technikon between 1994 and 1995 to further her studies specialising in Fashion and Advertising although she was denied the opportunity to graduate.  Career  Despite challenges and setbacks on her journey, in 1998 Ntsoma became the first black woman photographer to work for one of the biggest newspapers in South Africa, The Star. Although Ntsoma never felt discriminated by her colleagues whom were mainly white and male, she felt the need to constantly prove herself to gain the recognition in the industry. As Ntsoma explains in her artistry statement, :I used to take pictures to make people believe in me. Now, I take pictures to make people believe in the subject of my photographs. My aim is to share my point of view about something, and also what I am feeling about it. But what's important for me is to capture the spirit and soul of the subject I am photographing. Between 2002 and 2003, Ntsoma's involvement with Majority World began when she was a tutor at Pathshala South Institute of Photography in Bangladesh, which was led by Shahidul Alam. Alam assisted with publicizing work of artists from majority world countries, which included Africa. Majority World publicized her work and gave her opportunities to showcase them in exhibitions and publications globally. Ntsoma mentioned, \\"I can proudly say that people know of my work in countries that I cannot even read the language.\\" In 2004, Neo Ntsoma became the first woman recipient of the Mohamed Amin Award, the CNN African Journalist of the Year Photography Prize for her photo essay entitled, 'Their World in Flames'. Over the years her career has also spanned to fine arts and celebrity photography. Ntsoma co-authored Women by Women: 50 Years of Women's Photography in South Africa with Robin Comley, George Hallett, and Penny Siopis. It was commissioned by the South African Ministry of Arts and Culture as a celebration of the 50th anniversary of the 1956 women's march on the Union Buildings. In 2007, Ntsoma founded Neo Ntsoma Productions, a visual communications and production company owned and managed entirely by black women. Ntsoma's team consists of photographers, video technologists, editors, visual communication strategists, writers, and consultants who work in industrial and corporate sectors alike. The company also provides entrepreneurial workshops and private mentorship programs for aspiring photographers. In 2018 photojournalist, Neo Ntsoma was part of a discussion, along with fellow panelist, on development on the African continent - at the Yale University Art Gallery.

Its height is variously give as Landesamt f√ºr Vermessung und Geobasisinformation Rheinland-Pfalz, Koblenz, reference dated 19 September 2011, extract of discussion article or .Landesamt f√ºr Vermessung und Geobasisinformation Rheinland-Pfalz, Koblenz, enquiry dated 22 July 2010 The higher value has been officially recommended since 2011. That makes the Wei√üenberg the highest point in the west of the mountain range, ahead of the Eschkopf and Mosisberg (each ). As part of the Palatine Forest- North Vosges Biosphere Reserve it is protected by special conservation measures.  Geography = Location  The Wei√üenberg lies in the central Palatine Forest in the Palatine Forest Nature Park. It rises about 6.5 kilometres east-northeast of Merzalben and eight kilometres north of Hauenstein near the Wilgartswiesen hamlet of Hermersbergerhof. It does not have a single peak, but a saddle-shaped summit running in a north-south direction. The southern peak is 609.9 m high, and the northern peak, 280 metres away, is 609.1 m high. The hill is part of the Frankenweide, a central massif in the Palatine Forest, and is the southernmost in a row of four summits, all above 600 m in height. To the north, in sequence, are the Hortenkopf (606 m), the Mosisberg and the Eschkopf (each 609 m).  Isolation and prominence  The Wei√üenberg is a hill with a relatively high isolation but low prominence: view from the Luitpold Tower looking north The nearest peaks that are higher than the Wei√üenberg are the Ro√überg (637 m) and the Steigerkopf (613 m) mountains; they are 15 kilometres away as the crow flies in the Haardt on the eastern edge of the Palatine Forest. Thus the Wei√üenberg has a relatively high isolation. In addition, the Wei√üenberg is not an isolated individual summit, but part of an elongated ridge that runs through the interior of the Palatine Forest in various directions and is a key feature of its relief. If one draw a line of the greatest possible height (the ridgeline) to the next highest summit, this turns out to be the Steigerkopf at 613 m. The lowest point on this line is the saddle at Heldenstein Forestry Lodge at 472 m. The difference between the elevation of the Wei√üenberg summit and this saddle represents the prominence of the hill i.e. 138 m. This relatively low value is due to the morphological structure of the central Palatine Forest described above. For example, it is possible to walk from the Wei√üenberg to Leimen, Kaiserslautern-M√∂lschbach, Elmstein and via the forester's lodges of Taubensuhl and Heldenstein almost as far as the town of Neustadt on ridges without dropping below the 450 metre contour line.

In existence since March 17, 1834, it predates the Soci√©t√© Saint-Jean Baptiste by three months. The St. Patrick's Society continues to be a leader in Montreal's Irish community, organizing such annual events as the St. Patrick's Ball, the St. Patrick's Luncheon, and the St. Patrick's Society's annual Christmas concert. The Society's current President is Christie Brown.  History =Origins There is evidence of Irish immigrants in Quebec as far back as the 1760s. The first St. Patrick's Parade was organized by Michael O'Sullivan in 1824. By 1834, a group of notable businessmen gathered to form what is now known as the St. Patrick‚Äôs Society of Montreal, founded on March 17, 1834 at McCabe‚Äôs Hotel in Old Montreal. The first executive officers of the Society were President John Donnellan, Vice Presidents Hon. Michael O'Sullivan, Benjamin Holmes, and Thomas A. Begley, Treasurer John M. Tobin, Corresponding Secretary S. Sweeney, and Recording Secretary H. McGregor, who were supported by twelve committee members. Many involved were longstanding leaders of the community. In the March 20, 1824 edition of the Canadian Spectator mention is made of M. O'Sullivan Esq being in the chair at a Hibernian Society dinner. O'Sullivan is reported to have expressed how shameful it was that \\"St. Patrick's Day had never before been met with a public celebration\\". In the 1831 Montreal Almanack John Donnellan is listed as President of the Montreal Hibernian Benevolent Society. The Society was not a political organization, but was largely charitable and national in purpose, and was principally social and educational. However, it was founded mainly by Irish Protestants in the spring of 1834 in order to oppose the 92 Resolutions sent by Lower-Canadian Louis-Joseph Papineau's Patriotes to the British Government. In that sense, loyalty to the Crown was central to the founding of St. Patrick's Society. The Society was at first non-sectarian. The first President was John Donnellan, a prominent Montreal citizen. The founding of the Society was closely followed by the establishment of the St. Jean Baptiste Society in June 1834, the St. Andrew's Society in February 1835, the German Society of Montreal on April 21, 1835, the St. George‚Äôs Society on April 27, 1835 and later the St. David‚Äôs Society and the Caledonian Society. The beautiful spirit of friendliness and cooperation among the so-called Sister Anglophone Societies since their inception has been notable and has persisted throughout the years. The St. Patrick's Society, the St. Andrew's Society and the St. George's Society were opposed to the Patriotes bas-canadiens who founded the Soci√©t√© Saint-Jean-Baptiste, named \\"Aide-toi et le Ciel t'aidera\\" at its inception in 1834 by former 1st Mayor of Montr√©al, Jacques Viger. The national qualities and purposes of the various anglophone bodies were commented upon by the Honourable Peter McGill, the first English-speaking Mayor of Montreal, at a dinner given by St. Patrick‚Äôs Society on the evening of March 17, 1836. End of non-sectarianism The Society continued as non- sectarian until the year 1856, under the able presidency of such men as John Donnellan, Benjamin Holmes, Sir Francis Hincks, Bernard Devlin, W.F. Batley, Thomas Ryan and many others, at which time the non-Catholic members were encouraged to establish a society of their own. This separation was largely the work of Reverend Patrick Dowd. As a result, the Catholic members retained the old name of the Society, and the non-Catholic members assumed the name ‚ÄúIrish Protestant Benevolent Society‚Äù. Among those who vigorously opposed the separation was Sir William Hales Hingston, a prominent surgeon and later, the Mayor of Montreal, who tendered his resignation from the Society as a gesture against what he termed the uncalled for division. Hingston would likely have been happy to discover that the Society returned to its non-denominational origins in the latter part of the twentieth century. Thomas D‚ÄôArcy McGee T.D. McGee mausoleum doorOne of the most illustrious members of the Society was the Honourable Thomas D‚ÄôArcy McGee, the poet, newspaper editor and Member of Parliament for Montreal West, whose great eloquence played a crucial role in the formation of the Dominion of Canada. Despite his fame and position, he was expelled from the Society in 1868 as a result of his strong condemnation of the Fenian movement, because the Society had by then been taken over by a majority of Fenian members or sympathizers. Shortly after his expulsion from the Society, McGee was assassinated in Ottawa on April 7, 1868. Perhaps somewhat hypocritically, the Society forwarded a letter of condolence to his family expressing their abhorrence of the crime and arranged for his burial in Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery on Mount Royal. His tomb has ever since been looked after by St. Patrick‚Äôs Society. At the 178th annual meeting, held June 19, 2012 at the Hyatt Regency Hotel, the members witnessed a highly informative and entertaining debate between David Wilson and J. Peter Shea, the Society's historian, about the merits of reinstating McGee's membership posthumously. After the debate, which lasted forty minutes, the members present voted overwhelmingly in favour of reinstatement after 144 years as a Society outcast. World War I At the outbreak of the Great War in August 1914, realizing that it was vitally important that the Irish community of Montreal play their part in the defence of Canada, members of the Society were largely instrumental in the formation of an Irish Canadian Regiment. Hence, in the fall of 1914, the 55th Regiment, Irish Canadian Rangers, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Harry Trihey, K.C. and Major William O‚ÄôBrien, a prominent Montreal stock-broker, came into being. Later, towards the end of January 1916, it was decided to form an Overseas Battalion, and the Canadian Infantry Battalion, Irish Canadian Rangers (later to be known as the 199th Battalion Duchess of Connaught's Own Irish Rangers, CEF), commenced recruiting. Practically all the officers, non-commissioned officers and men of the old 55th Regiment offered their services for overseas, and thanks to St. Patrick‚Äôs Society, the Battalion‚Äôs colours were formally presented on the Champ de Mars in June 1916. Recent times The Society played a headership role with respect to scholarships, child welfare, Irish Home Rule and other kindred matters. It would be impossible to describe in this brief history all the events to which the Society lent its interest during its existence, such as the building of St. Patrick‚Äôs Church (now Basilica), the formal opening of Notre Dame des Neiges Cemetery, the Golden and Diamond Jubilee of St. Patrick‚Äôs Church, St. Patrick‚Äôs Orphanage, Father Dowd‚Äôs Home and St. Mary‚Äôs Hospital, to name but a few. In 1977, just over one hundred years since the destruction of St. Patrick‚Äôs Hall by fire, St. Patrick‚Äôs Square, a 252-unit pre-retirement building and community located in C√¥te St. Luc, was officially opened by Prime Minister Pierre Elliott Trudeau. The project was launched with seed funds provided by the Society in cooperation with the Federal Government, and through the leadership of the renowned Montreal architect and President of the Society, Joseph Dunne. The Society‚Äôs office has been situated there ever since. The Society was originally responsible for maintaining the annual St. Patrick‚Äôs Day Parade, which was held under its auspices from 1834 to 1916. The event was discontinued in 1917 owing to war conditions, but was renewed the following year under the direction of the Ancient Order of Hibernians until 1928, and since that date the parade has been under the direction of the United Irish Societies of Montreal. William Hales Hingston 1867Of the six Irish mayors of Montreal in the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries ‚Äì William Workman, Francis Cassidy, K.C., Sir William Hingston, James McShane, Richard Wilson-Smith and the Honourable James J. Guerin ‚Äì all were members of St. Patrick‚Äôs Society of Montreal, and three were Presidents of the Society: Workman, Cassidy and Guerin. Other Past Presidents of the Society include a pre-Confederation co-premier of the Province of Canada and later federal minister of finance (Sir Francis Hincks), a federal minister of Justice (Charles J. Doherty) as well as a number of other prominent politicians, judges, business leaders and others. After the various waves of nineteenth- century immigration from Ireland, by the turn of the twentieth century the membership of the Society essentially was composed of second-, third- and fourth-generation Irish-Canadians. By the mid-twentieth century, the Society‚Äôs main social celebrations and fundraising activities were its Annual Charity Ball and its Annual St. Patrick‚Äôs Day Luncheon, both of which had evolved from the original banquets and dinners of the early nineteenth century. A key feature of the Annual Charity Ball was and still is the presence of special invited guests, which include a special guest of honour and the presidents or other representatives of the Sister Societies, such as the St. Andrew‚Äôs Society, the St. David‚Äôs Society, the German Society, the Irish Protestant Benevolent Society and the United Irish Societies. The annual St. Patrick‚Äôs Day celebration is now a business-type luncheon, with a guest speaker (almost always with an Irish background) who has played a prominent role in politics, business, academia, the arts, law, journalism or otherwise. Perhaps, as a result of the worldwide exposure for Montreal and Canada generated by Expo 67 and the celebrations surrounding Canada‚Äôs centennial, there was a new ripple of Irish immigration to Canada and Montreal in the late 1970s and 1980s. The Society and the Montreal Irish community were the beneficiaries of the contributions of this new generation of arrivals, who have contributed greatly to the preservation and enjoyment of Irish culture and tradition in Montreal. The Society‚Äôs newsletter, Nuacht, was largely the product of the 1970s- and 1980s-era immigrants. This period also saw the renewal of interest in things Irish, such as Irish traditional music, the Irish language, Irish dance, Irish theatre, Irish sports and Irish cinema. The Society took a leading role in promoting and financially supporting these cultural endeavours. The culmination of this renaissance of interest in Irish culture in Montreal was the creation of the Canadian Irish Studies Foundation in 1995. Members of the Society, most notably Michael Kenneally, Brian Gallery, Peter O‚ÄôBrien and others, played leading roles in the effort to raise funds to provide courses in Canadian Irish studies at Concordia University, which itself is the successor institution of Loyola College which had long been associated with the Irish in Montreal. St. Patrick‚Äôs Society contributed the original seed money to launch the successful capital campaign of the Canadian Irish Studies Foundation, which raised millions of dollars. In 2010, due to overwhelming interest in the courses being offered and the great success of the capital campaign, the School of Canadian Irish Studies ‚Äì the first in Canada ‚Äì was created at Concordia University with the financial support of the university and the Canadian Irish Studies Foundation. In 2009, as part of the year-long celebration of the Society‚Äôs 175th anniversary, the Society, in cooperation with the Irish Protestant Benevolent Society and the Government of Quebec, funded and launched a very successful year-long exhibition about the contributions of the Irish to Quebec life entitled ‚ÄúBeing Irish O‚ÄôQuebec‚Äù at the McCord Museum of Canadian History in Montreal. The Society has evolved greatly since 1834, yet remains true to its roots. In 2011, the Society organized and sponsored welcoming receptions and job networking events for young Irish immigrants to Montreal, who were not fleeing discrimination and famine like many of the original members of the Society but rather declining economic conditions in Ireland. In 1983, the Society admitted for the first time a woman, Beverly Rozek, to full membership and, in 1998, the members of the Society elected its first woman President, Lynn Lonergan Doyle. To enable the Society to fund and carry out its mission, the Society has an endowment and organizes numerous major annual fundraising events. Together with the traditional Annual Charity Ball and the Annual St. Patrick‚Äôs Day Luncheon, the Society also holds an annual Christmas concert and an annual golf tournament. The moneys raised at these events fund the operations of the Society, which is a registered federal charity, allows the Society to organize and sponsors a large number of cultural and educational activities that are open to all and to make significant donations to other Montreal charities and not-for-profit organizations that serve the less fortunate, homeless, children, families and elderly of the city, both Irish and non-Irish.

The goal of this requirement is to prevent fraud by ensuring claimants don't file for the same injury with more than one of the asbestos trusts. There are approximately 60 trusts with billions of dollars in them. This bill was introduced into the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. Background Asbestos is a set of six naturally occurring silicate minerals used commercially for their desirable physical properties. They all have in common their eponymous asbestiform habit: long (roughly 1:20 aspect ratio), thin fibrous crystals. The prolonged inhalation of asbestos fibers can cause serious illnessesPosition Statement on Asbestos from the Joint Policy Committee of the Societies of Epidemiology (JPC-SE), approved June 4, 2012 including malignant lung cancer, mesothelioma, and asbestosis (a type of pneumoconiosis). The trade and use of asbestos have been restricted or banned in many jurisdictions. Asbestos became increasingly popular among manufacturers and builders in the late 19th century because of its sound absorption, average tensile strength, its resistance to fire, heat, electrical and chemical damage, and affordability. It was used in such applications as electrical insulation for hotplate wiring and in building insulation. As of March 2013, there were 85 new personal-injury claims related to asbestos a day. There have been hundreds of thousands of asbestos injury claims over the past three decades which has led to bankruptcy for some companies. Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency (FACT) Act of 2013 would amend federal bankruptcy law concerning a trust formed under a reorganization plan following the discharge in bankruptcy of a debtor corporation in order to assume the debtor's liability with respect to claims seeking recovery for personal injury, wrongful death, or property damage allegedly caused by the presence of, or exposure to, asbestos or asbestos-containing products. The bill would require such a trust to file with the bankruptcy court quarterly reports, available on the public docket, which describe each demand the trust has received from a claimant and the basis for any payment made to that claimant (excluding any confidential medical record or the claimant's full Social Security number). It would also require such reports, upon written request, and subject to payment (demanded at the option of the trust) for any reasonable cost incurred by it, to provide any information related to payment from, and demands for payment from, the trust to any party to any action in law or equity concerning liability for asbestos exposure. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary on May 21, 2013. This is a public domain source. H.R. 982 would require trusts set up through a Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization caused by asbestos liabilities to submit quarterly reports to the bankruptcy court concerning the damage claims and payments made by the trust. Based on information provided by the Administrative Office of the U.S. Courts (AOUSC), CBO estimates that implementing H.R. 982 would have no significant impact on the federal budget because the AOUSC would incur only minor costs to make that information publicly available. Enacting H.R. 982 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 982 contains no intergovernmental mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act (UMRA) and would impose no costs on state, local, or tribal governments. H.R. 982 would impose a private-sector mandate as defined in UMRA by requiring asbestos trusts to submit quarterly reports. According to studies by the Government Accountability Office (GAO) and the RAND Corporation, only a small number of asbestos trusts currently exist. Further, the GAO study indicates that the information to be submitted under the bill is already tracked by many of the asbestos trusts. Therefore, CBO expects that the incremental cost to comply with the reporting requirements in the bill would fall below the annual threshold established in UMRA for private-sector mandates ($150 million in 2013, adjusted annually for inflation). Procedural history The Furthering Asbestos Claim Transparency (FACT) Act of 2013 was introduced in the United States House of Representatives by Rep. Blake Farenthold (R, TX-27) on March 6, 2013. It was referred to the United States House Committee on the Judiciary and the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law. On March 13, 2013, the Subcommittee had a hearing on the bill, reported as Hearing Report 113-39. It was reported (amended) by the House Judiciary Committee on October 30, 2013, alongside House Report 113-254. On November 8, 2013, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that the bill would be considered during the week of November 11, 2013. Debate and discussion Proponents of the bill argued that it will prevent claimants from \\"double dipping\\" by claiming their injury twice. They argue that this helps future victims by ensuring that there is still money in the future and that it has not been given out to false or double claims. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce's Institute for Legal Reform is in favor of the bill. It ran full-page advertisements in favor of the bill in Washington, D.C. area newspapers such as Politico and The Hill. The United States Chamber of Commerce wrote a letter to the House of Representatives urging them to vote in favor of the bill, expressing concern about existing fraud and abuse of the trust funds. Opponents argue that reports would hurt the privacy of the victims and make claims more difficult. The Asbestos Disease Awareness Organization opposed this bill. The widow of Rep.

The standard creates a system of public logs that seek to eventually record all certificates issued by publicly trusted certificate authorities, allowing efficient identification of mistakenly or maliciously issued certificates. Background In 2011, a reseller of the certificate authority Comodo was attacked and the certificate authority DigiNotar was compromised, calling attention to existing flaws in the certificate authority ecosystem and accelerating work on various mechanisms to prevent or monitor unauthorized certificate issuance. Ben Laurie, Adam Langley and Emilia Kasper began work on an open source framework to combat these issues the same year. They submitted the first draft of the standard as an IETF Internet Draft in 2012 under the code-name \\"Sunlight\\". Advantages One of the problems with digital certificate management is that fraudulent certificates take a long time to be spotted, reported and revoked by the browser vendors. Certificate Transparency would help by making it impossible for a certificate to be issued for a domain without the domain owner knowing. Certificate Transparency does not require side channel communication to validate certificates as do some competing technologies such as Online Certificate Status Protocol (OCSP) and Convergence. Certificate Transparency also operates without the need to trust a third party. Certificate Transparency logs Certificate Transparency depends on verifiable Certificate Transparency logs. A log appends new certificates to an ever-growing Merkle hash tree. To be seen as behaving correctly, a log must: * Verify that each submitted certificate or precertificate has a valid signature chain leading back to a trusted root certificate authority certificate. * Refuse to publish certificates without this valid signature chain. * Store the entire verification chain from the newly accepted certificate back to the root certificate. * Present this chain for auditing upon request. A log may accept certificates that are not yet fully valid and certificates that have expired. Certificate Transparency monitors Monitors act as clients to the log servers. Monitors check logs to make sure they are behaving correctly. An inconsistency is used to prove that a log has not behaved correctly, and the signatures on the log's data structure (the Merkle tree) prevent the log from denying that misbehavior. Certificate Transparency auditors Auditors also act as clients to the log servers. Certificate Transparency auditors use partial information about a log to verify the log against other partial information they have. Certificate authority implementation Google launched its first certificate transparency log in March 2013. In September 2013, DigiCert became the first certificate authority to implement Certificate Transparency. Google Chrome began requiring Certificate Transparency for newly issued Extended Validation Certificates in 2015. It began requiring Certificate Transparency for all certificates newly issued by Symantec from June 1, 2016, after they were found to have issued 187 certificates without the domain owners' knowledge. Since April 2018, this requirement has been extended to all certificates. Cloudflare announced its own CT named Nimbus on March 23, 2018. EJBCA, a Certificate Authority software implementation added support for submitting certificates to CT logs, and embedding returned SCTs in issued certificates in April 2014.

Miller (born 1978) is an American businessman and attorney serving as the CEO of CaliBurger and its parent company CaliGroup. Early life and education John C. Miller was raised in Los Angeles. He completed a bachelor's degree in economics at the University of Redlands and attended Stanford Law School. He then joined the California Bar in the United States District Court for the Northern District of California. Career Miller was vice president of intellectual property at a public pharmaceutical company, Arrowhead Pharmaceuticals, from 2004 to 2010. He co-authored a book called The Handbook of Nanotechnology: Business, Policy, and Intellectual Property Law. After spending time working in Asia, Miller founded Pasadena-based technology company CaliGroup. CaliGroup's new technology is trialled at the CaliBurger chain of restaurants, offering solutions for \\"food production, delivery, take out and drive thru\\". They have invested in gaming to make the restaurant experience more entertaining. Robotics, created by the subsidiary Miso Robotics, are used in the kitchen to fry burgers. Through the Cali Group subsidiary PopID, facial recognition software allows customers to place orders and pay. Miller believes the \\"restaurant industry has come under attack from increasing costs\\" and aims to use robotics to \\"drive down costs associated with labor, especially turnover.\\" He remarked: \\"Millenials that we hire don't tend to stay very long. They come in, we train them, they work for a while, then go drive an Uber and go home and pay competitive video games\\". In a Fox News interview in 2017, Miller said the robotic technology increased the quality, consistency and hygiene standards of food as \\"robots don't spit in food or contaminate food.\\" He said employees' strengths were related to \\"social interaction\\" with customers. In response to the coronavirus pandemic in 2020, Miller said body thermometer devices would check for feverish temperatures as customers entered CaliBurger's Pasadena store. In 2020, Miller was included on Nation's Restaurant News' Power List. CaliBurger CaliBurger is a fast-food restaurant with West Coast-styled fries, burgers, and milkshakes. The menu in certain locations includes vegan options with sauces and cheese, and patties by Beyond Meat. Spiked milkshakes, beer, and wine are available at select locations. CaliBurger uses a robotic device named \\"Flippy\\" in its restaurants for certain types of food preparation. An upgraded version called \\"Flippy Robot-on-a-Rail\\" or \\"Flippy ROAR\\" was announced in October 2020. It is being implemented in 50 CaliBurger locations. The company has a broad international presence, with locations in the United States, Mexico, China, Kuwait, Malaysia, Philippines, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, and United Arab Emirates. CaliBurger was sued by In-N-Out Burger in 2012 for selling ‚ÄúAnimal Style‚Äù fries and serving milkshakes in palm-tree-print cups; the lawsuit was settled and CaliBurger agreed to change their menu and decor. Personal life Miller married violinist Caroline Campbell in April 2005. He filed for divorce in June 2011, but they reconciled the following February. They filed divorce papers again in October 2014. In October 2016, they agreed to joint legal custody of their daughter Violet and son Quest. The divorce was finalized in November 2018.

He is the linebackers coach at Virginia Tech, a position he has held since 2020. Claeys served as the head football coach at University of Minnesota from midway into the 2015 season thru the end of the 2016 season. Claeys served as an assistant for Jerry Kill for 21 years at Saginaw Valley State University, Emporia State University, Southern Illinois University Carbondale, Northern Illinois University, and Minnesota‚Äîthe last 16 as his defensive coordinator. From 2018 to 2019, Claeys was the defensive coordinator at Washington State University Early life Claeys was born and raised in Clay Center, Kansas, where he began playing football in junior high school at Clay Center Community High School. College and early coaching Claeys got his start in coaching at the University of Kansas and served as a student trainer, and later as an unpaid assistant coach for head coach Glen Mason. After three years at Kansas, he transferred to Kansas State University and took a job as an assistant at his old high school, earning a salary of $1. After graduating with a degree in Mathematics Education in 1994 from Kansas State, he was hired at Santa Fe Trail High School as a math teacher and co-defensive coordinator of the football team. Coaching career In 1995, Claeys was hired as the defensive line coach at Saginaw Valley State under head coach Jerry Kill. When Kill took the head coaching job at Emporia State in 1999, Claeys followed and was promoted to defensive coordinator. He continued to serve as defensive coordinator at Kill's future head coaching stops at Southern Illinois, Northern Illinois, and Minnesota. Southern Illinois led the nation in defensive scoring in 2004, while allowing only 13.2 points per game, giving up only 101.7 rushing yards per game, and snagging 17 interceptions. In 2007, they reached the FCS national semifinal; their defense ranked as the 10th-best FCS scoring defense in the country, and the second-best scoring defense at SIU since 1983. They intercepted 21 passes, which ranked fourth in the nation. In his first season at Northern Illinois, Claeys and the defensive staff coached the Huskies into leading the MAC in pass defense, scoring defense, and total defense. They also finished in the top 20 nationally in those three categories: fifth in pass defense, 14th in scoring defense, and 17th in total defense. Claeys' defense topped the MAC and ranked 30th in the country in total defense the following year, and were also among the top 30 FBS teams in scoring defense that season. In 2010, Claeys led a Northern Illinois defensive unit that was ranked No. 14 in the nation and No. 1 in the MAC in scoring defense, allowing an average of just 19 points per game. The Huskies were also 32nd in the nation in pass efficiency defense, 27th in total defense, and 27th in rushing defense. Claeys joined the Minnesota staff on December 10, 2010, when Kill hired him as defensive coordinator. He was nominated for the Frank Broyles Award (top college assistant coach) in 2013 and 2014 and was promoted to Associate Head Coach prior to the 2014 season. He transformed the Gopher defense into one of the best in the Big Ten. Minnesota allowed 380 points in 2011 and 321 points in 2012. By comparison, in 2013, the Gopher defense allowed only 289 points, which marked the first time that Minnesota allowed fewer than 300 points in a full season since 2004. He also coached four First Team All-Big Ten defensive selections‚ÄîBriean Boddy-Calhoun (2014), Damien Wilson (2014), Ra'Shede Hageman (2013), and Brock Vereen (2013)‚Äîat Minnesota in five years. In contrast, Minnesota had five First Team All-Big Ten defensive selections from 2000-10. Claeys was hired by Mike Leach on January 8, 2018 to be the defensive coordinator at Washington State after Alex Grinch accepted a position at Ohio State.\\"Washington State hires Tracy Claeys as defensive coordinator\\", USA Today, January 8, 2018, retrieved February 5, 2018. The Cougars ended the 2018 season with the fourth-ranked defense and led the Pac-12 Conference in sacks with 38. He resigned on October 4, 2019; at the time, Washington State's defense was ranked 107th in the nation and was allowing over 30 points per game. This came after the Cougars blew a 49-17 lead at home to the UCLA Bruins in a game in which Heisman hopeful Anthony Gordon threw for a record 9 touchdowns in the game. Acting head coach Due to Jerry Kill's health problems throughout his career, Claeys filled in as acting head coach when Kill was unable to coach. This first occurred in 2005, when Kill suffered a seizure on the sideline during a Southern Illinois game; Kill was later diagnosed with kidney cancer and epilepsy. Claeys filled in for Kill when Kill missed parts of three games in his first three years at Minnesota, and for the entire game when Kill had a seizure before a game at Michigan in 2013. On October 10, 2013 it was announced that Kill would take an open-ended leave of absence from coaching to focus on treating his epilepsy. Claeys was appointed acting head coach until Kill's return. The Gophers went 4‚Äì3 under Claeys during the regular season, a stretch that included a four- game Big Ten conference win streak (the Gophers' first since 1973). They lost their bowl game to Syracuse, in which Coach Kill returned to the sidelines in the second half. Head coach Kill retired for health reasons on October 28, 2015, and Claeys was named interim head coach for the remainder of the season. On November 11, 2015, Minnesota dropped the \\"interim\\" tag from Claeys' title and formally named him as its 29th head coach. On January 3, 2017, he was fired after public outrage over a team-led boycott in response to suspensions of 10 Minnesota football players accused of having a role in a sexual assault case.

The compensation would cover the attorney fees and other lawsuit-related costs that the defendant in the frivolous lawsuit had to pay. The bill would also remove the provision of Rule 11 allowing attorneys or parties who file frivolous papers to avoid party-requested sanctions by withdrawing their lawsuits before 21 days have passed. The bill was introduced in the United States House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. On November 14, 2013 the bill passed the House, but was never passed by the Senate.https://www.govtrack.us/congress/bills/113/hr2655 Provisions of the bill This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Research Service, a public domain source. The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act of 2013 would amend the sanctions provisions in Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to require the court to impose an appropriate sanction on any attorney, law firm, or party that has violated, or is responsible for the violation of, the rule with regard to representations to the court. The bill would require any sanction to compensate parties injured by the conduct in question. The bill removes a provision that prohibits filing a motion for sanctions if the challenged paper, claim, defense, contention, or denial is withdrawn or appropriately corrected within 21 days after service or within another time the court sets. The bill also authorizes the court to impose additional sanctions, including striking the pleadings, dismissing the suit, non-monetary directives, or penalty payments if warranted for effective deterrence. Congressional Budget Office report This summary is based largely on the summary provided by the Congressional Budget Office, as ordered reported by the House Committee on the Judiciary on September 11, 2013. This is a public domain source. H.R. 2655 would amend Rule 11 of the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure to require courts to impose appropriate sanctions on attorneys, law firms, or parties who file frivolous lawsuits and to require them to compensate parties injured by such conduct. Under current law, courts may, but are not required to, impose such sanctions. Under the legislation, any monetary sanction imposed under Rule 11 would be paid by the parties to the suit. Thus, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated that implementing the bill would result in no significant impact on the federal budget. Enacting H.R. 2655 would not affect direct spending or revenues; therefore, pay-as-you-go procedures do not apply. H.R. 2655 contains no intergovernmental or private-sector mandates as defined in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act and would not affect the budgets of state, local, or tribal governments. Procedural history The Lawsuit Abuse Reduction Act of 2013 was introduced on July 11, 2013 by Rep. Lamar Smith (R, TX-21). It was referred to the United States House Committee on the Judiciary and the United States House Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice. The House Judiciary committee voted to report the bill on September 11, 2013 by a vote of 17-10. House Report 113-255 was released to accompany the bill on October 30, 2013. On November 8, 2013, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that the bill would be considered during the week of November 11, 2013. The House was scheduled to work on this bill on November 14, 2013. Debate and discussion Rep. Lamar Smith argued in favor of the bill and getting rid of the 21-day safe-harbor provision, stating that it would help end lawyers filing frivolous lawsuits when they have \\"everything to gain and nothing to lose\\" by doing so. Smith also said that \\"Lawyers can file meritless lawsuits, and defendants are faced with the choice of years of litigation, high court costs and attorneys' fees or a settlement,\\" and called the practice \\"legalized extortion.\\" Republicans argue in favor of the bill as being needed to help protect companies from expensive and wasteful lawsuits. Democrats argued that the bill is unnecessary since judges already have the option of imposing sanctions.

Exploitation projects Currently, there is no exploitation project active, but there is one that has its operations suspended temporarily (Baia Mare) and there are two proposed projects (Ro»ôia MontanƒÉ and Certej). Previously, there were also exploitations in Baia de Arie»ô (Alba County), Sasar, Suior, Cavnic, BƒÉi»õa, BƒÉiu»õ (Maramure»ô County). There are some ongoing explorations projects operated by Eldorado Gold in Brad, Deva and Muncel (Hunedoara County), in addition to the company's new intended exploitation in Certej. Ban attempts In 2005, a number of 12 Greater Romania Party Senators (among which Gheorghe Funar) proposed a law project which banned the usage of cyanides for gold and silver extraction in Ro»ôia MontanƒÉ. The law was rejected in the Senate in November 2005 and in the Chamber of Deputies in March 2006. The government also opposed it arguing that the law referred to a special case. A year later, Funar and Peter Eckstein of the Democratic Union of Hungarians in Romania, usually bitter rivals in the political scene of Cluj, created a new law which was more general and avoided to talk about Ro»ôia MontanƒÉ. The project was nevertheless rejected in the autumn of 2008, meeting the opposition of the Democratic-Liberal Party. A third attempt to ban gold cyanidation was registered in the Senate in June 2013, proposed by non-affiliated deputy Remus Cernea, being supported by other 38 senators and deputies of all parties, many of which from the government coalition. The only MP from the Democratic-Liberal Party to support the law was the deputy Teodor Paleologu. Disasters The 1971 Certej dam failure led to the deaths of 89 people after a failure of the dam of the tailings pond. The 2000 Baia Mare cyanide spill occurred when a dam (operated by Aurul, a joint-venture of the Australian company Esmeralda Exploration and the Romanian government) holding 100,000 tonnes of cyanide-contaminated tailings spilled into the Some»ô River and from there into the Tisza and Danube. The spill created a large-scale environmental disaster that has been called the worst environmental disaster in Europe since the Chernobyl disaster.\\"Death of a river\\", BBC, February 15, 2000 References Category:Gold mining in Romania ","title":"Gold cyanidation in Romania"},{"id":"41062163","text":"Kholsha-e Chahardeh (, also Romanized as KholshƒÅ-e ChahƒÅrdeh and KholshƒÅ‚Äô-e ChahƒÅrdeh) is a village in Chahardeh Rural District, in the Central District of Astaneh-ye Ashrafiyeh County, Gilan Province, Iran.

It was built as a facility for patients with an intellectual disability and included a theatre. It now houses the national office of the Down's Syndrome Association, and the Langdon Down Museum of Learning Disability.  History  Normansfield Theatre exterior The Normansfield Hospital was founded at the White House in Teddington as an institution for mentally handicapped children by John Langdon Down, after whom Down syndrome was named. It was opened as the Normansfield Training Institution for Imbeciles in May 1868. The south wing was built in 1869, the north wing was added in 1873 and the Normansfield Theatre was opened by the Earl of Devon in 1879. When Down died in 1896, his sons, Reginald and Percival, succeeded him as managers of the institution. It was renamed Normansfield in 1925 and joined the National Health Service in 1951. The hospital was the scene of a strike by the nursing staff in the Trades Union COHSE in 1976. The nurses were angry that the regional health authority had ignored their grievances against consultant psychiatrist Terence Lawlor and demanded that he be suspended. His suspension led to a public inquiry chaired by Michael Sherrard. It was one of many official inquiries into National Health Service mental hospitals during that period. Dr Lawlor's professional style emerged as intolerant, abusive and tyrannical. COHSE was roundly criticised for a strike over which its officials had broken union rules, misled their membership and then blamed the nurses. An NHS administrator was found to be fearful of Dr Lawlor. The only body to emerge with any credit was the local Community Health Council, which was abolished in 2003. The inquiry recommended that Lawlor should be sacked. The same judgement applied to several senior nurses and administrators. The hospital closed in 1997. The Down's Syndrome Association operates the Langdon Down Centre in the former hospital's theatre wing, which includes the national office of the Down's Syndrome Association, the Normansfield Theatre (a Grade II* listed Victorian theatre) and the Langdon Down Museum of Learning Disability. The museum's exhibits include information on John Langdon Down and his family, the history of the care of people with learning disabilities, and the history of the Normansfield Hospital and its residents. The museum also features art, including many works by James Henry Pullen, and artefacts of the former Royal Earlswood Museum in Surrey about the former Royal Earlswood Hospital. The museum opened in 2012, and is a member of The London Museums of Health & Medicine group.

Ice m√©lange is commonly the result of an ice calving event where ice breaks off the edge of a glacier. Ice m√©lange affects many of the Earth's processes including glacier calving, ocean wave generation and frequency, generation of seismic waves, atmosphere and ocean interactions, and tidewater glacier systems. Ice m√©lange is possibly the largest granular material on Earth, and is quasi-2-dimensional. Etymology M√©lange or melange means \\"mixture\\" and originates from the Old French word \\"meslance\\". Ice m√©lange has also been referred to as \\"sikkussaq\\" or \\"sikkusak\\",Joughin, I., I. M. Howat, M. Fahnestock, B. Smith, W. Krabill, R. B. Alley, H. Stern, and M. Truffer (2008), Continued evolution of Jakobshavn Isbrae following its rapid speedup, J. Geophys. Res.,113, F04006, doi:10.1029/2008JF001023. http://people.ee.ethz.ch/~vawweb/publications/glaziology_division_vaw/2008_2866.pdf which is a Greenlandic word meaning packed by ice or surrounded by sea ice. The word is derived from the word \\"siku\\", which means sea ice. Influence on fjord seiches Fjord seiches are created by the calving and capsize of large icebergs and m√©lange movement. It has been shown that such events create long- period, large-scale surface gravity waves and seiches.Amundson, J. M., M. Truffer, M. P. L√ºthi, M. Fahnestock, M. West, and R. J. Motyka (2008), Glacier, fjord, and seismic response to recent large calving events, Jakobshavn Isbr√¶, Greenland, Geophys. Res. Lett., 35, L22501, doi:10.1029/2008GL035281. http://www.uas.alaska.edu/arts_sciences/naturalsciences/envs..../faculty_staff/pubs/amundson_et_al_2008_GRL.pdf The presence of ice m√©lange slows down the propagation of both external and internal seiches and introduces band gaps where energy propagation (group velocity) vanishes. If energy is introduced into the fjord within the period range covered by a band gap, it will remain trapped as a fading oscillatory mode near its source, thus contributing to localized energy dissipation and ice m√©lange fragmentation. Understanding the connection between seiches and ice m√©lange is important for several reasons. First, seiches cause commotion within the mass of ice m√©lange that typically fills the fjord, thereby causing further break-up and capsize of the sea ice. Second, their relationship determines how the fjord will respond to forcing by the external ocean beyond. Third, seiches offer a means of quantifying the energy associated with iceberg calving and capsize, when direct local measurements of the event are impractical due to the hazards of deploying instruments on or below ice m√©lange. Examples=Jakobshavn Isbr√¶, Greenland Huge icebergs and calved ice moving out of the Kangia to the sea. The Jakobshavn Isbr√¶, or Jakobshavn Glacier, has a large drainage basin and is one of Greenland‚Äôs largest and fastest-flowing outlet glaciers. Large calving produces a long floating ice tongue that rapidly melts in spring suggesting that the tongue is formed by a dense pack of calved icebergs and is an ice m√©lange. Through visual observations of Jakobshavn Isbr√¶‚Äôs proglacial ice m√©lange it can be determined that the m√©lange forms a semirigid, viscoelastic cap over the innermost 15‚Äì20 km of the fjord, motion of the m√©lange is primarily contained by deformation within and along the margins of the m√©lange, and icebergs within the m√©lange gradually disperse and become isolated from each other as they move down the fjord. Seasonal variations in ice m√©lange strength can influence the evolution of Jakobshavn Isbr√¶‚Äôs terminus position, and therefore glacier flow. Sea ice formation in winter solidifies the ice m√©lange and bonds icebergs and large ice masses, thereby increasing the m√©lange buttressing of the glacier terminus. Thus, sea ice and ice m√©lange act together to influence glacier breakup dynamics by preventing calving and enabling the terminus to advance. In addition to the rapid horizontal movement of the ice m√©lange during calving events, ocean waves generated by calving icebergs cause the m√©lange to experience vertical displacements.Amundson, J. M., M. Fahnestock, M. Truffer, J. Brown, M. P. Luthi, and R. J. Motyka (2010), Ice m√©lange dynamics and implications for terminus stability, Jakobshavn Isbr√¶, Greenland, J. Geophys. Res., 115, F01005, doi:10.1029/2009JF001405. http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1029/2009JF001405/pdf Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf, West Antarctica Rapid sea ice breakup along the Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf The Filchner-Ronne Ice Shelf The ice m√©lange at the boundary of the ice shelf has sufficient strength to trap large tabular ice-shelf fragments for several decades before the fragments eventually become icebergs. This m√©lange tends to deform coherently in response to the ice shelf flow and the deformation of sea ice within the rifts suggests that the sea ice binds together large tabular ice-shelf fragments. The motion of the tabular fragments is a rigid body rotation about a vertical axis that is driven by velocity shear within the m√©lange. The role of the rift-filling m√©lange may be to bind tabular ice-shelf fragments to the main ice shelf before they calve. This suggests two possible mechanisms by which climate could influence tabular iceberg calving. First, non-uniform distributions in oceanic and atmospheric temperature may determine where the m√©lange melts and, thus, the location of the iceberg-calving margin. Second, melting or weakening of ice m√©lange as a consequence of climate change could trigger a sudden or widespread release of tabular icebergs and lead to rapid ice-shelf disintegration. Ice-shelf rifting, a long-term process that culminates in tabular iceberg release, is strongly influenced by sea ice and other types of ice, which fill the rift. The eventual detachment of these fragments as icebergs thus appears to be determined in part by the dynamics of the m√©lange which fills rifts. Brunt/Stancomb-Wills Ice Shelf, Antarctica The Brunt Ice Shelf and Stancomb-Wills Glacier connection has been used to study ice shelf flow acceleration due to a change in the stiffness of the ice m√©lange area and examine the consequences of frontal rift propagation. The structure of the Brunt/Stancomb-Wills Ice Shelf is very heterogeneous and would be vulnerable to extreme fragmentation if the ice m√©lange dynamics were to rapidly change. However, currently the Brunt/Stancomb-Wills system is not endanger of extreme destabilization. In the Stancomb-Wills Ice Tongue sits two floating glaciers connected by a large expanse of ice m√©lange, roughly 6,000 km2 in surface area. Several Antarctic ice shelves, including Larsen D, Shackleton and West ice shelves, are held together by ice m√©lange. Khazendar et al. found that Brunt gives strong support to the general idea of ice m√©lange being able, at least partially, to fill ice shelf fracture, such as rifts and bottom crevasses, as well as larger expanses separating meteoric ice segments of an ice shelf and is an important factor in ice shelf stability.Khazendar, A., E.

It was developed by Certification for Sustainable Transport (CST) at the University of Vermont.http://www.erating.org/images/pdfs/CST_1.0_Program_Manual.pdf CST uses eRating to rate vehicles based on several criteria. These include greenhouse gas emissions per passenger mile, emissions, alternative fuels, purchase of carbon offsets, and training programs that promote energy efficient driving. If the vehicle meets enough standards, it receives an eRating certification.  Program description  The eRating program is an independent, third party certification, education and labeling initiative for owners and operators, manufacturers and passengers of transportation vehicles. The eRating also functions as a sustainability index that weighs factors such as greenhouse gasses per passenger mile, environmental impacts, and even the use of alternative fuels and technologies in the transportation industry. Two major works were used in developing the eRating : the Federal Trade Commission's Part 260-Guide for the Use of Environmental Marketing Claims, and the International Social and Environmental Accreditation and Labeling Alliance (ISEAL) planning framework. In May 2012, CST finalized Step B-3, and transitioned to step E-1 to launch the eRating program. The CST was designed to help improve economic, environmental, and energy efficiency within the passenger transportation sector. The program uses research-based criteria to evaluate vehicles and includes the driver training programs \\"Idle Free\\" and \\"Eco-Driving 101\\" to improve efficiency.  Idle Free Training Program  This course teaches drivers about the health, environmental, and financial impacts of idling a vehicle. Health experts, vehicle manufacturers, and vehicle operators have all given their testimony about the advantages of idle- free driving. Upon completion of the course, drivers are then able to take an \\"idle-free pledge\\", in which they promise to follow the idling guidelines set forth in the course. Completion of this course earns 20 points towards an eRating certification.  Eco-Driving 101 Training Program  This course teaches drivers about eco-driving. Eco-driving is a set of simple driving habits that result in using less fuel, generating fewer emissions, and increasing safety. The course first explains the science behind eco-driving, as well as the environmental and mechanical benefits of doing so. Drivers are taught techniques such as avoiding aggressive acceleration, speeding and braking monitoring speed to maintain efficient and consistent speed; keeping RPM levels as low as possible for the speed and keeping the vehicle properly maintained, that they can use in their everyday driving in order to cut back on fuel consumption. The typical eco-driver can increase fuel efficiency by 10-30%. For organizations putting their drivers through this online training program, 20 points will be awarded towards the organizations eRating certification once they reach the 80% driver completion threshold.  Benefits  The program benefits owners, operators, and manufacturers by helping them reduce vehicle operation costs, save energy, and promote their businesses. The program also benefits consumers by helping them identify and choose the highest performing, lowest impact forms of transportation. Whether displayed on a bus, boat, train, car, bicycle, or plane, an eRating certification label signifies that CST has thoroughly evaluated and certified the vehicle.  eRating levels and criteria  Various features of the vehicle being considered for certification are examined. There are four levels of certification for a vehicle(s) in the eRating program: e1, e2, e3, and e4. The CST uses a point system, or sustainability index, to determine the certification level of a given vehicle. Points are given for more efficient features and attributes of the vehicle, with 100 being required for entry level, or e1, certification. e1 certification represents entry-level certification and e4 certification indicates the highest level. Only the most energy efficient, lowest impacts forms of transportation are eligible for certification; a certification label on a vehicle, be it e1, e2, e3, or e4, lets consumers know that the vehicle has met a set of rigorous sustainability criteria.  Certification standards overview  The eRating program aims to provide recognition through certification to transportation systems, fleets, operators and individual vehicles that help the passenger transportation sector: * Reduce greenhouse gas and other harmful emissions * Increase energy efficiency * Utilize alternative fuels and new technologies The eRating program offerd four levels of certification on a per vehicle basis to qualifying operators: e1, e2, e3 and e4 certification; e1 certification represents entry-level certification and e4 certification indicates the highest level of certification available. The application process determines which level of certification an operator qualifies. Points are earned based on the following: * Vehicle technology * Operation of the vehicle(s) at certain efficiency levels * Use of particular operating procedures within a company * Use of specific policies and educational programs within a company  Greenhouse gas emissions per passenger mile  Points are earned if the vehicle's greenhouse gas emission levels are at least 50% below the U.S. average for 2000-2009 (.274 kg per passenger mile). Minimum qualifications for vehicles must be greater than or equal to an average of 148 passenger miles per gallon. Higher levels of efficiency earn greater points.  Criteria pollutant emissions  Points are awarded for the use of technologies that reduce emissions such as carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, volatile organic compounds and nitrogen oxide. Pollutant producing vehicles, such as those with leaky exhaust systems or that produce excessive amounts of smoke, are automatically disqualified for certification.  Alternative fuels  The use of alternative fuels besides gasoline or diesel earns a vehicle points ranging from 5-100 towards certification. Qualifying fuels must be used a minimum of 80% of the time.  Greenhouse gas offsets  Optional points can be earned by purchasing greenhouse gas offsets from endorsed carbon-trading programs. These GHG reduction credits must be purchased through the Climate Action Reserve or Verified Carbon Standard or from another verified organization. These credits must be purchased in the region of intended use and must not be more than two years old. Generally 1 point will be awarded toward certification for every 5% of emissions offset.

He came to power during a period when Oman was divided by civil war, and the Persians had occupied large parts of the country. During his long rule as Imam the country prospered and regained its leading position in the Persian Gulf. Early years Ahmad bin Sa'id bin Muhammad bin Khalaf bin Sa‚Äôid Al-Busaidi Al-Azdi Al-Ammani Al-Ibadhi was born in Adam, Oman in 1710, the son of Sa‚Äôid bin Muhammad Al-Busaidi. Ahmad bin Sa√¨d came from the Al Bu Sa√¨d, a small Hinawi tribe from the interior of Oman. He was great great grandson of Mubarak al-Saidi al-Azdy of the Banu Hiba, a clan belonging to the Hiwani tribe of Yemen. It was said that he began as a wood vendor and worked his way up. He became a leading merchant of the port city of Sohar. In 1737 he was appointed governor of this city. The sixth Imam of Oman of the Yaruba dynasty was Saif bin Sultan II, who came to power during a period of civil war and lost popularity due to his indulgent lifestyle. Saif called for military help from Persia, and in 1737 Persian troops arrived led by Nader Shah. They began to conquer the country. The Persians left in 1738 but returned from 1742 to 1744. By 1742 the Persians were in control of much of the country. Saif was tricked into letting them take the key forts of al Jalali and al Mirani in Muscat while drunk at a banquet. He died soon after, the last of his dynasty. The Persians took Muscat and then attacked Sohar to the north. After enduring nine months of siege, Ahmad bin Sa'id negotiated an honorable surrender. The Persian commander Taqi Khan confirmed him as governor of Sohar and Barka in return for payment of tribute. Assumption of power Sohar castle today. By late 1744, Ahmad had control over large parts of Oman. Bal'arab bin Himyar of the Yaruba had been elected Imam in 1743, and retained the support of some of the Ghafiri of Dhahireh and the Semail. Bal'arab bin Himyar raised a strong force and advanced on Muscat, but was unable to take that town. He then attempted to take Sohar. Ahmad went to town's aid but was deserted by his troops at the Battle of Bitnah around the start of 1745 and forced to flee. Ahmad used excuses to delay paying tribute, and as a result the Persians could not pay their troops in Muscat and many deserted. In 1747 Ahmad invited the remaining Persian troops to a banquet at his fort in Barka. There he massacred them. For several years Bal'arab bin Himyar was recognized as the true Imam, fully controlling the interior, while Ahmed remained on the coast. On the coast of East Africa, Ahmad bin Sa'id was recognized as Imam only by the governor of Zanzibar. In 1749 Ahmad gathered an army and moved against Bal'arab, who was encamped near Jebel Akhdar with inferior forces. In the final battle, in the second half of 1749, Bal'arab was defeated and killed. This was the end of Yaruba power. Ahmad was now the undisputed ruler of Oman. In 1749 the Ibadi tribes of Oman elected Ahmad bin Said as their Imam. He election took place on 9 June 1749 at Rustaq. Reign Ahmad bin Said had widespread popular support as the person who had liberated the country from the Persian occupiers. He quickly consolidated his power through whatever techniques were expedient. A ship owner and trader in outlook, he saw the economic potential of Oman's position on the trade routes, and gained allegiance from the tribal leaders by engaging them in commercial ventures. Ahmad bin Said made his seat at Rustaq. From there he ruled for 39 generally peaceful years, although he had to deal with intrigues by members of the deposed Ya'Aruba family, by other tribes and by two of his sons. Ahmad bin Said encouraged the development of agriculture and maritime trading. For the first time in the history of Oman Ahmad bin Said maintained a permanent army and navy. In the late 1770s he attempted to gain control of the Strait of Hormuz between the Gulf of Oman and the Persian Gulf, a key position. Ahmad bin Said reestablished the leading position of Oman among the Persian Gulf states. Family Ahmad bin Said had seven sons and three daughters. His eldest son Hilal was disqualified from the succession since he was blind. His second son Said bin Ahmad was his heir. His third son Qais bin Ahmad later became governor of Sohar. His fourth and fifth sons were Saif and Sultan bin Ahmad, both children of his fourth wife, a sister of Shaikh Muhammad bin Nasir al-Jabry al-Ghafiry, of Zhahirah. Shaikh Abdallah Rocky Amir Muhammad was a strong leader of the Nizariya faction, and under the Yarubi had once been governor of Bahrain. His two youngest sons were Talib, later governor of Nakhal and then of Rustaq, and Muhammad, later Governor-General of Mombasa and Oman's East African possessions. The eldest of his three daughters, Moza, became a power in family affairs and acted as guardian and supporter of her nephews Salim and Sa'id. On 1 February 1775 Ahmad turned over responsibility for routine administration to his son, Said bin Ahmad, while retaining the title of Imam. Ahmad bin Said's sons Sultan and Saif rebelled in 1781, and took control of the forts of al-Mirani and al-Jalali that guarded the harbor of Muscat. They kidnapped their brother Said bin Ahmad and imprisoned him in al Jalali. Ahmad returned to Muscat early the next year, captured al-Mirani, and after bombarding al-Jalali from al-Mirani and from ships on the other side managed to regain control. Ahmad bin Said died on 15 December 1783 at Al- Batinah Fort, Rustaq. He is buried there at the Western Fort, near the Great Mosque. Said bin Ahmad was elected Imam as his successor. His descendants continued to rule Oman, although they did not have the religious authority of the Imams of the Ibadi Muslim tradition. Ahmad bin Said was the only ruler of his dynasty who was clearly an Imam, elected in the traditional way. His son was also elected, but abdicated soon after, although retaining the title of Imam. After that, members of the dynasty were sultans of Muscat, with until 1959 only limited authority over the interior of Oman.

On the summit is an inn, the Weinbiethaus, a stone-built panorama tower with a weather station and a radio transmission mast. The two striking towers have made the hill a regional landmark above the plains roughly 400 metres below. The Winzergenossenschaft Weinbiet vineyard, on the municipalities of Mu√übach (head office), Gimmeldingen and Haardt, takes its name from the hill.  Geography = Location  The Weinbiet lies northwest and above the town of Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe on the western shoulder of the graben fault, which led to the sinking of the Rhine Plain. The intrusion was formed in the Old Tertiary about 65 million years ago and lasted until the present period. The eastern spur of the Weinbiet massif, the 316-metre-high Nebelberg (N√∂pelberg), is quite striking and runs for almost two kilometres to the edge of the graben fault. Whilst the Gimmelding quarry on the east side of the Nebelberg had been abandoned by the middle of the 20th century, the Haardt quarry on the south side is still working. The southern spur, in the direction of Speyerbach, the 474-metre-high Wolfsberg with the three hectares of nature reserve descends slowly towards the Bergstein (409 metres) in the south-southeast. Here is also the stone relief of the Steinerner Hirsch (\\"Stony Stag\\"), from where there is a wide view over the Rhine Plain; further west are the ruins of the Wolfsburg castle and the Hohfels. The Meisental valley runs roughly south to north east of the Wolfsberg whilst to the west is the Nonnental valley. The western spur, the 428-metre-high Schwalbeneck, transitions into the Hinterer Langenberg to the north, whose highest points are in the northwest (466 metres) and southeast (502 metres). High on the north flank of the Weinbiet, enclosed in the Loosenbrunnen well, is the strongest source of the Mu√übach, which flows through Gimmeldingen and Mu√übach and then empties into the Rehbach, the northern side branch of the Speyerbach. To the north is the forest estate of the town of Deidesheim, to the east, clockwise, are the villages of K√∂nigsbach, Gimmeldingen and Haardt as well as the town of Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe, to the south the quarter of Sch√∂ntal, and to the west the village of Lindenberg. The Weinbiet seen from the north from the air. By coincidence, the tip of the transmission mast points to Hambach Castle, 6 km to the south.

Christian Sibelius (28 March 1869 in H√§meenlinna - 2 July 1922 in Helsinki) was a Finnish doctor and professor of psychiatry. Sibelius became a bachelor of arts in 1889 and a doctor of medicine in 1897, and in the same year became an associate professor of pathological anatomy at the University of Helsinki. He studied under Ernst Alexander Hom√©n. His doctoral thesis, Bidrag till k√§nnedomen om de histologiska f√∂r√§ndringarna i ryggm√§rgen, de spinala r√∂tterna och ganglierna vid progressiv paralysi (Contribution to the knowledge of the histological changes in the spinal cord, the spinal roots and ganglia in progressive paralysis), discussed both normal histological and pathological conditions, and demonstrated the relationship between paralysis and spinal cord damage. It placed him at once at the forefront of contemporary pathological anatomists. His early scientific works include 'Till k√§nnedomen om de efter amputationer uppkommande f√∂r√§ndringarna i nervsystemet med speciell h√§nsyn till de spinokutana neuronerna' (in Finska l√§kares√§llskapets Handlingar, 1897) and 'Zur Kenntniss der Entwickelungsst√∂rungen der Spinalganglienzellen bei heredit√§r-luetischen missbildeten und anscheinend normalen neugeborenen' (in Zeitschrift f√ºr Nervenheilkunde, 1901). Research in Berlin from 1902 to 1905 produced 'Zur Kenntniss der Gehirnerkrankungen nach Kohlenoxydvergiftung' (in Zeitschrift f√ºr klinische Medicin, 1903) and 'Die psychischen St√∂rungen nach akuter Kohlenoxydvergiftung' (in Monatsschrift f√ºr Psychiatrie und Neurologie, 1905). In 1904 he moved to the Lapinlahti mental hospital (which was associated with the University of Helsinki and served as a teaching hospital for medical students) and began to conduct psychiatric research. He wrote 'Drei Falle von Caudaaffektionen' and 'Zur Kenntnis der Zweiteilung des R√ºckenmarkes (Diastematomyelie)' (both in Arbeiten aus der pathologischen Institution der Universitet Helsingfors, 1906‚Äì7). He became associate professor of psychiatry in 1906 and a full professor in 1909. In 1921 he became a distinguished professor of the subject. Sibelius practised extensively in the field and was a proponent of healthcare reform. Under his leadership, the Finnish Psychiatric Association was founded in 1913. He served as its president.

The company was founded in 2010 and is best known for creating games for mobile devices, including Year Walk and Device 6. Its name comes from the name of its founders Simon (SIM), and Gordon (GO); the 'O' from the Swedish word \\"och\\" meaning \\"and\\". Prior to Simogo, founders Simon Flesser and Magnus \\"Gordon\\" Gardeb√§ck worked at Southend Interactive, creating ilomilo (Xbox 360) amongst other games.  History  In 2004, Simon Flesser was an animator working on movies and commercials. With the release of the Nintendo DS in the same year, he became interested in developing games for the then-new platform. This led him, in 2007, to Southend Interactive, where he produced art for several games. It was while working there that he met the other half of Simogo, Gordon \\"Magnus\\" Gardeb√§ck. In 2010, the duo decided to leave Southend and create their own company. Although roles were not and are not defined, Simon usually makes the artwork, sound and design whereas Gordon codes and does the paperwork. It has become a tradition for Simogo to post a visual collage teasing inspirations for projects the company is currently working on. Hints are also visible throughout their blog, often hidden throughout seemingly normal announcements. After releasing their games, the company will usually provide insight into the development process as well as explain their previously cryptic clues. Following the 2019 release of Sayonara Wild Hearts through Annapurna Interactive, Simogo and Annapurna announced they had reached a multi-year agreement for further publishing of Simogo's games.  Games developed  Simogo is primarily a mobile game developer; as such, its games are usually first released for mobile products, then ported to other platforms such as PC and Mac.  Kosmo Spin (2010)  The new studio's first release was Kosmo Spin, where the player attempts to save a planet populated with breakfast cereal people from aliens. This game was made available on the App Store 2 December 2010 for USD $0.99. Reviewers praised the simplicity and \\"cute\\" graphics of the game. It was featured by Apple on the App Store following its release. Following the game's 5-year anniversary, the price of the game was raised to $2.99 in 2015.  Bumpy Road (2011)  Their next game was Bumpy Road, following the adventure of an old couple on a road trip. The distinguishing feature of this game was the mechanic where the player moves the road under the car instead of the car itself to reach objectives in the game. It was made available 19 May 2011 at a price of US$2.99 for iOS and 12 April 2012 at the same price for Mac. The game was featured on the front page of the Mac App Store when released.  Beat Sneak Bandit (2012)  Following the success of their previous games, they released their third, Beat Sneak Bandit. Playing as a bandit who must \\"sneak to the beat\\", the user sneaks into the mansion of \\"Duke Clockface\\" to take back the clocks the Duke has stolen from the town. It was made available 16 Feb 2012. Reviews praised the originality of the game, along with its design. The game was featured as the iPad Game of the Week. As of January 2013, this game has sold 100,000 copies.  Year Walk (2013)  Their next game, Year Walk, departed from their style of happy, cute games. Year Walk is an adventure game about the Swedish tradition of \\"√•rsg√•ng\\", or \\"year walking\\". It was released 21 Feb 2013 on the App Store for US$3.99, and PC/Mac on 6 March 2014. The game was met with overwhelmingly positive reception: reviewers praised the dark atmosphere, graphics, sound, and the story of the game. As of 2014, it has sold over 200,000 copies. A version of the game for the Wii U console was released in 2015.  Device 6 (2013)  Device 6 is a text-based puzzle adventure game. The games is played from Player249's point of view as he/she guides a person named Anna through a strange island with no memory of getting there. Using clues hidden throughout the text and images, the player attempts to travel through the story. The app's text forms the map for which the player interacts; for example, a block of text moves as the player descends in an elevator. It was released on the App Store 17 October 2013 for iOS. Reception to this title was also overwhelmingly positive: reviewers lauded the creativity of the genre, the narrative, and the use of sound. As of April 2014, it has sold 200,000 copies.  The Sailor's Dream (2014)  It was announced on 28 July 2014 that this game would be released in late 2014. It is, according to the game developers, 'more open and quite non-linear', unlike their previous titles. Several screencaps and a trailer of the game were provided with the announcement. Jonas Tarestad and Jonathan Eng, who previously worked with Simogo on Device 6, returned to work on this game. The Sailor's Dream was released on 6 November 2014.  SPL-T (2015)  SPL-T is a puzzle game for iOS which was released on 28 September 2015. The main goal of the game is 'splitting' blocks by tapping on them. The game is over when no more splits are possible.  Sayonara Wild Hearts (2019)  Sayonara Wild Hearts is a pop album video game released on 19 September 2019 for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, and Apple devices via Apple Arcade. It was revealed at The Game Awards 2018. The game was created with support from Annapurna Interactive.

Sir Henry had not been opposed at the last election. The last contested election was the election before when his majority had been halved; Candidates *The local Liberal Association selected 35-year-old Englishman Arthur Ponsonby to defend the seat. At the time he was Private Secretary to Sir Henry. At the 1906 general election he ran unsuccessfully as a Liberal candidate for Taunton. He was the third son of Sir Henry Ponsonby, Private Secretary to Queen Victoria, and the great- grandson of Frederick Ponsonby, 3rd Earl of Bessborough. He was educated at Eton and Balliol College, Oxford, and joined the Diplomatic Service, taking assignments in Constantinople and Copenhagen.Who's Who: www.ukwhoswho.com *The Conservatives chose 40-year-old William Whitelaw as their candidate. He was elected at the 1892 general election as the Member of Parliament (MP) for Perth, but lost his seat at the 1895 general election and was defeated when he stood again in 1900. Whitelaw was a director of the Highland Railway (HR) from 1898, and Chairman of the HR since 1902. Campaign Polling Day was fixed for the 22 May 1908, one month after the death of Sir Henry. All the newspapers dwelt on the court connections of Ponsonby's father and brother, and of his having been a page to Queen Victoria. The electors were fascinated by an advanced radical with such an impeccable upper class, not to say royal, background.Arthur Ponsonby: the politics of life, Raymond A.

Westberg was a pioneer in exploring and encouraging the interrelationship of religion and medicine and in fostering holistic health care. He held the first joint appointment in medicine and religion at a major university (the University of Chicago).  Early life and education  Westberg was born July 11, 1913 in Chicago to Swedish immigrant parents, Alma Ahlstrom and John Westberg. He received his bachelor's degree from Augustana College in Rock Island, Illinois in 1935. Four years later he graduated from Augustana Theological Seminary (now Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago). At Augustana College, Granger met his future wife, Helen Johnson, with whom he had 4 children.  Career = Early career  In 1939 Westberg began his career as a parish pastor and brought a dying church in Bloomington, Illinois back to life. It was a rich experience but it was to be his last position as parish pastor. In the early 1940s, when most of the few existing hospital chaplains were part-time elderly ministers, young Westberg saw the potential for clergy making a more significant contribution to the care of patients. Traditionally chaplains handed out religious pamphlets and prayed with as many patients as possible. Westberg thought that appropriately educated chaplains could have meaningful conversations with patients and their families and that they could provide an important perspective as part of a health care team. When the chaplain at Augustana Hospital in Chicago retired, Westberg applied for the job. His mentors cautioned Westberg that he was throwing away a promising career in the ministry. After some changes in the job description, Westberg accepted the position as full-time chaplain at Augustana.  Pastoral care  Before starting work, Westberg took six months to prepare himself. Like most ministers, Westberg's education had been highly theoretical and classroom-based with little help in developing needed practical skills, such as counseling. So Westberg took hands-on courses with pioneers in the new field of clinical pastoral education, such as Anton Boisen at Elgin State Hospital and Rollin Fairbanks at Massachusetts General Hospital. Russell Dicks, who with physician, Richard Cabot, had written the important book, The Art of Ministering to the Sick, had recently moved to Chicago. Dicks, who was chaplain at a nearby hospital, was Westberg's mentor and quickly became his collaborator and friend. At their hospitals, Dicks and Westberg created popular, intensive courses in pastoral care for ordained ministers, chaplains, and seminarians. Both were part of creating organizations, such as the Association of Protestant Hospital Chaplains (later called the College of Chaplains) that set standards and accreditation policies for hospital chaplains. At the time Westberg was at Augustana Hospital, many nurses around the country were often treated as \\"handmaidens\\" to doctors. By working closely with nurses, Westberg was persuaded that nurses made a significant contribution to patient care. Rather than being in the demeaning role of handmaiden, Westberg thought nurses should be part of the health care team. Based on a curriculum he developed and taught for Augustana's School of Nursing, Westberg wrote a book called Nurse, Pastor, and Patient. In 1951 Westberg became Chaplain of the University of Chicago Clinics. His work with students and faculty members in both theology and medicine led in 1956 to him being given a joint appointment in both the Chicago Divinity School and the school of medicine at the University of Chicago.Time Magazine. April 16, 1956, p. 55. Westberg continued focusing on religion and health and a team approach to health care, using strategies such as interdisciplinary case conferences. He also wrote and talked about what he called \\"whole-person care\\".  Writing and teaching  In 1962 Westberg's interest in the grief process resulted in his writing Good Grief, a book that is still selling well more than 50 years after its first publication. At the time of Westberg's death, the work had sold more than 2.4 million copies and was the top-selling book in the history of Augsburg Fortress, the official publisher of the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America. In 1964 Westberg became the Dean of the Institute of Religion, which was located in the heart of the Texas Medical Center in Houston and linked to five Texas seminaries, providing a graduate program in pastoral care and counseling. With an academic appointment as Professor of Medicine and Religion in the Department of Psychiatry of Baylor College of Medicine, Westberg tried to build more interaction between doctors and ministers. In addition to the seminarians existing clinical experiences in hospitals, he introduced clinical experiences for seminarians in churches. Westberg argued that seminarians should have clinical experiences throughout their theological education. A few years later, as a professor at Hamma School of Theology (now Trinity Lutheran Seminary, he was able to help nudge the Hamma curriculum in this direction. At Hamma he also responded to the national need for more preventive and primary care by creating a model \\"neighborhood church-based clinic\\", where physicians, pastoral counselors, nurses, seminarians and medical students and community volunteers provided needed care. In the early 1970s when Westberg moved to the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC), he worked with a team in creating several \\"wholistic health centers\\". Like the church-based clinics in Springfield, they focused on prevention, whole-person care, and the church as a healing community. Increasingly it was clear that nurses were key members of the health team. Westberg remained at UIC until 1981.  Faith community nursing  In the mid 1980s, when most of his peers were retiring, Westberg launched the parish nurse project in which nurses, each based in one or more churches, used their talents and the talents of others in the congregation to promote health, prevent illness, and care for those in need. The program began at Lutheran General Hospital in Park Ridge, Illinois. Established as a three-year program through a grant from the W. K. Kellogg Foundation, the operation began with six registered nurses.  Later life and death  Westberg lived in Willowbrook, Illinois during his later years. He died on February 16, 1999. The week after his death, the Daily Herald reported that more than 3,000 nurses were involved in parish nursing in the United States.  Honors  Westberg received an honorary doctorate from Augustana College in 1956. Late in life, he received the Amicus Certus (True Friend) Award from Lutheran Social Services of Illinois and the Modern Samaritan Award from the Alexian Brothers Medical Center.  Legacy  The scope of parish nursing has expanded over the years, so it is now called faith community nursing. There are 15,000 participating nurses, primarily in the United States. Faith community nurses are also working in Australia, the Bahamas, Canada, England, Ghana, India, Kenya, Korea, Madagascar, Malawi, Malaysia, New Zealand, Nigeria, Palestine, Pakistan, Scotland, Singapore, South Africa, Swaziland, Ukraine, Wales, Zambia and Zimbabwe. In 2011, the Health Ministries Association established the Granger Westberg Leadership in Faith Community Nursing Award to recognize outstanding faith community nurses.

It connects the remnants of several lines that previously connected to Rockhampton, originally by a rack railway. History A branch line was built from near Rockhampton, opening in 1898, and another opened in 1917, both having a north-south alignment. In 1953 a spur line opened to serve the Callide Mine, and another to serve the Moura coal mine opened in 1963, both mines shipping coal to Gladstone via Rockhampton, a ~270 km distance. As coal volumes grew a direct line to Gladstone was proposed, and the 151 km Moura Short Line opened in 1968, being the first 'S' (Special) class line in Queensland, with an 18 tonne axle load at the time.Kerr, J. 'Triumph of Narrow Gauge' Boolarong Publications 1990 It commenced at Graham railway station (in Calliope) on the Monto line, connecting to the Callide Valley line (and the Callide Coalfields) at Earlsfield railway station (in Jambin), and connecting to the Dawson Valley line at Moura Mine Junction, 12 km east of the town of Moura. Before the Moura Short Line opened, the largest QR steam locomotive, known as a Garratt, could haul a 750-ton coal load to Gladstone via Rockhampton. After the line opened, triple headed diesel hauled trains took 4000 ton coal loads direct to Gladstone. System realignment Additional coal mines were developed in the area, and a 5.6 km line from Annandale to Boundary Hill Mine opened in 1983. A balloon loop and 5.6 km connecting line was opened at Moura Mine in 1994. As Gladstone is the major port for central Queensland, the majority of freight began to be railed via the new direct line, and the 69 km Kabra-Wowan and 47 km Baralaba-Moura sections of the Dawson Valley line closed in 1987, effectively shifting the network to an east-west alignment. Further sections subsequently closed such as Thangool-Biloela (11 km) in 1988, Goolara-Theodore (5 km) in 1993, Wowan-Rannes (25 km) and Kooemba-Baralaba (12 km) in 1995, Rannes-Kooemba (25 km) in 1997 and Rannes - Koorngoo (24 km) in 1999. On 26 June 2013 the Earlsfield-Koorngoo, Dakenba-Biloela and Moura-Goolara sections were closed, leaving the system as a 192 km line from Graham to Moura, with a 29 km branch to Callide Coalfields and ~3 km balloon loops at the Boundary Hill and Moura mines. Present system Today coal is the main freight hauled on the Moura line, with grain from the silos at Moura being significant, if seasonal, traffic. The line from Dakenbah to Biloela has been removed. The Moura line as far as the Moura balloon loop features 60 kg/m rail on concrete sleepers, a 26.5 tonne axle load, maximum grade of 1 in 63 (~1.6%) eastbound (1 in 50 (2%) westbound), 300m minimum radius curves and a line speed of 80 km/h except for the 10 km section crossing the Calliope Range, which has a 40 km/h speed limit. Beyond that the line has 30 kg/m rail, a 15.75 tonne axle load and a 40 km/h speed limit. The section from Earlsfield to Callide Coalfields via Dakenba features 53 kg/m rail, a 26.5 tonne axle load and curves with a minimum radius of 160m. Proposed southern connection A major coal mine is proposed at Wandoan, with coal to be shipped from Gladstone via the proposed Surat Basin railway, which would connect to the Moura line south of the town of Banana. This proposed line would be well east of Taroom, and pass close to the gold mining town of Cracow.

Only one was built. Design and development The GP1 was a simple single seat glider designed by Ugo Abate and built by students of the University of Pavia during 1925 or 1926. The letters GP were in memory of Giovanni Pirelli, killed in a gliding accident. It was a wooden framed aircraft, covered in plywood and fabric. The GP.1 was a cantilever, high-wing monoplane with its two spar wing mounted just above the fuselage on a low pedestal. The wing was built in three separable parts for ease of transport, with a rectangular centre section and slightly straight tapered outer panels with rounded tips, carrying slotted ailerons. All three panels were fabric- covered. Its rectangular cross-section fuselage was built of spruce and was ply covered. The cockpit opening was a simple rectangular uncovered cut out in the top of the fuselage in front of the wing leading edge. Aft, the fuselage narrowed markedly to a conventional tail with a parallel chord, round tipped tailplane mounted below the level of the wing. Its elevators had a deep central cut-out, even though the rudder did not extend below them. The vertical tail was of high aspect ratio and was upright and rectangular, apart from some taper on the leading edge of the upper fin. All the tail surfaces were fabric-covered. The GP.1 was fitted with a conventional wooden landing skid on rubber shock absorbers, with a tail bumper. Ettore Cattaneo set a new Italian gliding distance record of on 18 December 1926, flying the sole GP.1 from the high pasture of Campo dei Fiori di Varese ().

Songs of Innocence was printed using illuminated printing, a style Blake created. By integrating the images with the poems the reader was better able to understand the meaning behind each of Blake's poems. \\"The Little Boy Found\\" is a sequel to \\"The Little Boy Lost\\". The two poems are written as simple songs, similar to nursery rhymes.\\"Little Boy Found\\" and \\"Little Boy Lost\\". University of Buckingham. Retrieved December 8, 2013.  The poem  Structure  The poem's rhyme scheme is ABCB DEFE, with internal rhymes (CC and FF) on the third and seventh lines (The third line of each stanza). Blake uses a form of alliteration in the first two lines, repeating the letter l in \\"little...lost...lonely...led...light\\". The repetition of sound creates a rhythmic flow, setting the tone for the rest of the poem. The poem consists of two stanzas. In the first stanza the little boy is lost in a bog, and afraid when God comes to him. In the second stanza God leads him back to his mother, who had been looking for him. The Little Boy Found presents a pastoral setting.  Themes  One of the major themes in \\"The Little Boy Found\\" is the presence of God in people's lives. This is explicitly said in line 4. God is a common topic in Blake's poetry, especially in Songs of Innocence and Songs of Experience. In \\"The Little Boy Found\\" being 'lost' does not always refer to literally being lost. It can also refer to being lost in life, such as drug addiction or just being out of touch. Although Blake was a religious man, God does not always refer to the deity that most people associate with the name. It could also mean the loving connections and relationships that people have with other people. According to the article 'Pictorial and Poetic Design in Two Songs of Innocence' by Thomas Connolly \\"some individuals are maimed because they are exposed to destructive experience without the shielding protection of a guardian.\\" In \\"The Little Boy Found\\" the boy has been lost, and wandering. He is then led by the light of God. God appears as his father in white; this portraying God's innocence. He is then led by God to his mother. The fact that the boy was lost signifies that he might have strayed from his original innocence. However, through the guidance of God he is led back to his mother, this exemplifies the pureness and innocence of children. Gallery Scholars agree that \\"The Little Boy Found\\" is the 14th object in the order of the original printings of the Songs of Innocence and of Experience.

Biography Rachel \\"Didi\\" Roos was born in Rotterdam, the second child of the Roos family. When she was four years old her father died, and three years later her mother married Louis Strauss. The parents were convinced that after elementary school, she should financially contribute to the family's income. Rachel fought for her rights to an education with the support of her school's principal. She graduated and became a kindergarten teacher, specializing in Montessori education. In August 1941 Rachel became engaged to the architect Marcel \\"Moshe\\" Hertz, taking the name Rachel Roos-Hertz. In July 1942, Marcel's family was called up for forced work in the East. They, including Rachel and her mother, were invited by Martha Nagtegaal a former employee of the Hertz family, to be hidden by different parts of the Nagtegaal family. In March 1943 Martha obtained forged identity documents and ration stamps for them. From that time, 1943‚Äì1945, Rachel was involved in the Dutch Resistance, and so was her fianc√©, Marcel, who went by the fictitious name of Rienus van Elck. On May 9, 1945, Rachel and Moshe got married in a civil ceremony at City Hall in Ede and in August 1945 - in a Jewish ceremony in Utrecht. Rachel gave birth to their first son in April 1946. In September the family moved to Rotterdam, where Moshe got a job and a residence permit. Resistance Pretending to be a Christian farmer, Rachel joined the Dutch Resistance as a courier of Bill Wildeboer, the leader of the resistance in the Ederveen ‚Äì Bennekom region. In May 1943, they merged also with the branch of Lunteren. Rachel was involved in hiding Jews and Dutch conscientious objectors. In August 1944, the existing national organizations merged into the internal forces under the command of Prince Bernhard. Rachel was involved in the sabotage of Germans' orders and in reaching and assisting the Battle of Arnhem's Allied Forces. On November 17 Rachel was arrested by the Germans. She managed to destroy her commander's letters before they were found by the wardens. While trying to escape she was shot and brought back to the main headquarters of the Sicherheitsdienst, the German Security Forces. There she was severely tortured, but never disclosed the names of her comrades. Since her Jewish origin was not known, and her membership in the underground could not be proven, she was not executed. Three months later, as the Allies got closer to the Netherlands, she was transferred to the Westerbork transit camp, and from there she was sent to the death march, from which she escaped. She hid on a farm for two days until the Netherlands was freed. She moved to Lunteren where she met her fianc√©, Moshe Hertz, and later on - her mother. Awards On November 21, 1946, in a ceremony that took place in Tropenmuseum Amsterdam, Rachel was awarded the United States Medal of Freedom. On 18 October 1948 in the British Embassy in The Hague, she was awarded the United Kingdom King's Medal for Courage in the Cause of Freedom. Israel In February 1950 Rachel, Moshe and their two children immigrated to Israel and lived for a while in Kibbutz Beit HaShita. Later, they moved to Holon, where their third son was born in 1954. In 1956 Rachel joined the Women's International Zionist Organization (Wizo). In 1980, after they moved to Herzelia, she was elected as the Chairwoman of the local branch. She was also active in Rotary and in fund raising for sick children. Rachel died in 1989, after coming back home from a ceremony at Yad Vashem in the Netherlands, in which the Nagtegaal family was recognized as Righteous among the Nations.

Zlatopolsky was listed as the lowest bass in the world with a documented low note of C1.  Biography  Zlatopolsky was born to a Jewish family in Tashkent. Finished music school in Samarkand. After the Russian Revolution, when Orthodox singing moved into the category of marginal employment, the number of basso profondos sharply declined. Soviet oktavists enjoyed intense demand during the Brezhnev era. Moscow choirs outbid each other for Zlatopolsky as the star player. Zlatopolsky's place was employed by the Union Radio Choir, but he also performed with a number of Orthodox, Catholic and Lutheran churches, and at times a synagogue. Zlatopolsky began singing with Yurlov's choir, and later participated in Valery Polyansky's recording of Gretchaninov's Seven Days of Passion with the State Symphony Capella of Russia. Zlatopolsky recorded with the Don Cossacks Choir Russia under Marcel Verhoeff. He also can be heard singing Sviridov's Songs of Kursk with the Moscow State Chamber Choir under Vladimir Minin. Besides his musical career, Zlatopolsky also worked as an actor on several Russian films and TV shows, often playing the part of a Russian Orthodox priest. Although these parts were mostly small, his most prominent roles were in Pugachev (1978), Three Years (1980), We are Not Crowned in the Church (1982), and Storm over Russia (1992).  Voice range  Even in the world of oktavists, Zlatopolsky's range is exceptional for its depth. Chesnokov differentiates between a basso profondo whose range extends a little below C2, and strong oktavists, whose range may extend as low as G1 or F1. Zlatopolsky can be heard singing down to C1 in the Don Cossack's Choir performance of \\"Prayer for the Dead\\". The Guinness Book of World Records listed Zlatopolsky as the lowest bass in the world with a documented low note of E1. J. D. Sumner is also noted to be the lowest bass in the world. Zlatopolsky's upper register is featured prominently in Yemelyan Pugachev (1978). Zlatopolsky was not only known for the sheer depth of his range, but also his resonance and power. One Moscow chorister describes the experience of singing with Zlatopolsky thus: \\"At one concert on a small stage, we stood in close alignment. I was next to Mikhail. We were performing Kedrov's Our Father, and Zlatopolsky went into the contra octave. His voice began to shake the bodies of us who were standing near him. I was not up to singing‚Äîstood there in a kind of trance, trying to comprehend the experience.\\" Another remembers seeing Zlatopolsky perform a choral cycle by Gavrilin. He noted that generally oktavists, along with the rest of the choir, need to be precisely on pitch in order for such notes in the contra-octave to be clearly audible‚Äîotherwise the sonority is ruined. During the performance, however, he recounts that the rest of the choir sounded like \\"nothing more than a squeak\\" above the sound of Zlatopolsky's voice. Despite his enormous voice, Zlatopolsky was relatively small in terms of height.

In the fourth century, Pope Sylvester I was said to have inaugurated the first Schola Cantorum, but it was Pope Gregory I who established the school on a firm basis and endowed it.Giulio Cattin, Music of the Middle Ages I (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1984), 51. The choir ranged anywhere from twenty to thirty boys or men. Only the most skilled in singing were selected to participate in the Schola Cantorum.W.J. Henderson, Early History of Singing (Longsman, Green: New York 1921) 31. Ancient heritage Due to the lack of a system of notation and theoretical writings, there is very little known about the musical systems prior to the Greeks.Henderson, Early History of Singing, 1. Musicians of the middle age did not have a single example of Greek or Roman music. It was not until the Renaissance that historians discovered only a few ancient songs and hymns of the classical era.Donald Jay Grout and Claude Palisca, A History of Western Music (New York: W.W. Norton & Company Inc, 1996), 1. From these surviving specimens, we can see that primitive music developed in two major ways. The first was that singing was primarily monophonic ‚Äì that is, melody without harmony or counterpoint. The soloist would sing based on the repetition of two neighboring tones with no accompaniment. The second was of an improvisatory style where the melody and rhythm were intimately bound up with the melody and rhythm of poetry.Harold Gleason, Music Literature Outlines, Series I: Music in the Middle Ages and Renaissance (Rochester, New York: Levi Music Stores, 1951), I-3. To the west, the Romans left very few traces of musical development partly because it was deliberately suppressed during the persecution of Christians during the first two centuries.Cattin, Music of the Middle Ages I, 1. Leaders of the early Christian church wanted to exterminate music which had memories associated with the revels and rituals with Roman music.Cattin, Music of the Middle Ages I, 2. However, it was during this period that art, architecture, music, philosophy, new religious rites, and many other aspects of Greek culture were brought in from the Hellenistic world.Grout, Palisca, A History of Western Music, 16. It is uncertain whether or not Romans made any significant contributions to the theory or practice of music, but historians are certain that their music was derived from the Greeks.Palisca, A History of Western Music, 15. Singing is so basic to man that its origins are long lost in antiquity and predate the development of the spoken language. We do know however, that music of the early Middle Ages in Western Europe was derived from the ancient Greeks in terms of form and concept. The singer would sing improvised or monophonic melodies with the rhythm, accent, and movement according to the text. This ancient heritage would greatly influence development of music in Western Europe through the Christian Church.Palisca, A History of Western Music, 16. Early Christian Church Peace between the Church and the Roman Empire greatly effected the liturgical life and musical practice of Christians. In the fourth century AD, Constantine became the first Roman emperor to convert to Christianity. This conversion led to the proclamation of the Edict of Milan, which decreed religious tolerance throughout the empire. With more and more converts, it was clear that services could no longer be conducted in the informal manner of the early days. This freedom in religion allowed the church to build for large basilicas which made it possible for public worship and for Christians to finally assume a new dignity.Daniel Saulnier, Gregorian Chant: A Guide to the History and Liturgy (Paraclete Press: Massachusetts 2010), p 3. Music, in particular had its own place in these newly constructed basilicas. As the early church of Jerusalem spread westward to Western Europe, it brought along musical elements from diverse areas.Grout, Palisca, A History of Western Music, 18. It was during this time that the Schola Cantorum made its first appearance at the service of liturgical celebration.Grout, Palisca, A History of Western Music, 18. Schools of singers The Lombards, Franks, and Goths dominated the face of Western Europe in the seventh and early eighth centuries. The idea of unity and centralization was simply unknown during this time so local churches were relatively independent.Saulnier, Gregorian Chant: A Guide to the History and Liturgy, 3. Each region of the West probably received the Eastern heritage of musical elements in a slightly different form. This caused each region to produce several distinct liturgies and bodies of liturgical music of its own.Saulneir, Gregorian Chant: A Guide to the History and Liturgy, 3. Although each region shared the same language of Latin, they had different texts and music. We know for certain that there existed Beneventan chant, Roman Chant, Ambrosian chant, Hispanic chant, and several types of Gallican chant. Each of these political divisions developed their own repertory of melodies for singing sacred texts.Saulnier, \\"Gregorian Chant: A Guide to the History and Liturgy\\", 2. Papal choir The first Schola Cantorum of Rome was said to be founded by Pope Sylvester in the year of 314.Henderson, Early History of Singing, 20. Music evolved from a simple unison chant to a highly developed polyphonic choral style. Singing was usually performed by the clergy, however in 367, the Council of Laodicea banned congregational singing and placed the musical service in the hands of the trained choir.Henderson, Early History of Singing, 21. With trained singers for the musical part of the liturgy, the clergy could focus their attention to what was most important, and that was their office. Pope Sylvester‚Äôs Schola Cantorum of Rome was instituted for the study of chants, not for the vocal technique.Henderson, Early History of Singing, 27. Chanting in unity was an obvious and a must, but it did not take long for Sylvester to realize that they needed to impart some sort of style onto it. In this, the subject of uniformity was taken up and this inevitably led to the management of breath, which led to the discovery of the fundamental elements of vocal technique.Cattin, Music of the Middle Ages I, 8. The school of Sylvester demanded that chants were to be sung in a perfectly smooth, flowing kind of melody. Instructors often pushed their pupils to their limits, as they recognized that pure legato was essential in perfecting the chant.Henderson, Early History of Singing, 18. The employment of professional singers in the church played a prominent role in the development of the simple plain chant. The singers had mastered a style united with a technical finish of elegance and began to flourish their singing with ornamentation which had existed during classical times.Henderson, Early History of Singing, 22. These chants were not easy, nor sung in a dull and monotonous manner. The singers filled them with great richness and variety. This employment of trained singers acted as a precursor to the institution which was later reorganized by Pope Gregory I.Henderson, Early History of Singing, 30. The purpose of the schola was to teach both singing techniques and the plainsong repertory learned by the oral tradition. However, it was Pope Gregory I who standardized the liturgical repertory on a firm basis. This Roman school lasted a period of nine years which furnished the choir at most of the papal functions and was facilitated by the cantor. Schola Cantorum When Pope Gregory I was elected pope of the Roman Catholic Church in 590, he founded the Schola Cantorum. This was the school of singers which established the authoritative delivery of the musical liturgy for all of Europe.Cattin, Music of the Middle Ages I, 51. Of the schools that were directed by the church, pupils with the best voices were chosen for training in the Schola Cantorum. The most talented pupil was called paraphonist and was responsible for singing the solos of the ‚Äúalleluia‚Äù.Henderson, Early History of Singing, 32. The studies of the Schola Cantorum lasted a total of nine years. It was a long period because the school made it mandatory for pupils to memorize the chants. During service, only the director or the paraphonists was permitted to have a book. The ensemble consisted of anywhere between twenty and thirty boys or men. Women were not allowed to be a part of the Schola Cantorum. This group of boys and men had to have their head shaved and wore chasubles. The choir, clergy, and congregation, sang the ensembles of the service, leaving the most important parts of the service for the trained vocalists. The chant maintained its dominance in ecclesiastic music up until the rise of polyphony in the eleventh century.Henderson, Early History of Singing, 39. The idea of two or more simultaneous lines of independent melody accompanied by high and low pitched voices seemed more suitable for ecclesiastic music in the eleventh century. The polyphonic composition was constantly developing up until the seventeenth century when opera began to dominate the musical world of the church.Grout, Palisca, A History of Western Music, 74. Influence From Rome, the institution spread to other parts of the Church. When the pope visited France with his court, the Frankish King Pepin the Short could not help but admire the customs of Roman liturgy. Pepin realized that these customs could help to ensure religious unity throughout his territories and thus strengthen their political unity.Saulnier, Gregorian Chant: A Guide to the History and Liturgy, 5. The King therefore adopted the Roman liturgy and mixed it with the Gallican chant repertory. The overall structure of the Roman chant was accepted by the Gallican musicians, but they covered it with a completely different style of ornamentation. The fusion of Roman and Gallican chant evolved into what we now know as Gregorian chant.Saulnier, Gregorian Chant: A Guide to the History and Liturgy, 5. Charlemagne, the son of Pepin, was also impressed by the superiority of the Roman chanters.Rosamond McKitterick, Carolingian Culture: Emulation and Innovation edited by Rosamond McKitterick (Cambridge University Press: New York 1993), 277. He begged Pope Adrian I to assign him two cantors of the Gregorian school. Peter and Romanus were sent out to Francia in 789. Unfortunately, Romanus fell sick and remained behind, but Peter was able to make it to Metz and established a school of Gregorian chant.Henderson, Early History of Singing, 27. Nonetheless, the Schola Cantorum played a significant role in the transmission of Roman chant to the Carolingian court of Charlemagne. Several schools were also established in England shortly after the fusion of Roman and Gallican chant. Between the years 876 and 1073, the prior of the Schola is recorded to have performed a curious dance with clearly pagan origins known as Cornomania, on the Saturday following Easter, on the Lateran Square in Rome. He would wear a wreath with horns on his head, swing a rattle with bells, scatter laurel leaves, and cry out in an unknown language, \\"Iaritan, iaritan, iariariasti; raphayn, iercoin, iariariasti\\".F. Schneider, Rom und Romgedanke im Mittelalter (Munich, 1926), cited in H. St. L. B. Moss, The Birth of the Middle Ages (Oxford, 1935), p. 263. Several institutions today have modeled themselves after the medieval Schola, including Schola Cantorum Basiliensis of Basel and the Schola Cantorum de Paris. They aim to interpret classical, old popular, sacred, and of course Gregorian music with absolute purity of style and tone.I, C De, The Schola Cantorum, The Monthly Musical Record, (Jan 1900): 269.

The first was built in 1808 for foot, horse and stagecoach traffic. Bridges in the vicinity were repaired and replaced several times in the 19th century. The current bridge was built in 1904 and substantially modified in 1942 and has only been used for railroad traffic. It is owned by CSX Transportation and is used by CSX freight trains, Amtrak intercity trains, and Virginia Railway Express commuter trains. Norfolk Southern Railway has trackage rights on the bridge but does not exercise those rights.The Long Bridge Project - Notice of Intent No. 166 http://longbridgeproject.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/noi916.pdf In 2019 Virginia announced that it would help fund and build a new rail bridge parallel to the existing one to double its capacity, following the plans that have been studied by the District Department of Transportation (DDOT) and Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) since 2011. History=Washington bridge The first bridge at this location was the \\"Washington Bridge\\", a wooden toll bridge. The Washington Bridge Company was authorized on February 5, 1808 by the District Commissioners and an Act of Congress with the purpose of shortening the distance in the country's main mail route.An Act authorizing the erection of a bridge over the river Potomac within the District of Columbia - 10th Congress Session I - Chapter 15 - 1808. President Thomas Jefferson signed it into law soon after. It was built to provide foot, horse and stagecoach traffic an access route to Washington City.National Railway Historical Society - Washington DC Chapter - History of the Long Railroad Bridge Crossing Across the Potomac River by Robert Cohen - http://www.dcnrhs.org/learn/washington-d-c-railroad-history/history-of-the- long-bridge It was the second bridge to cross the Potomac in the District of Columbia, following a 1797 span at a narrower crossing near Little Falls, upstream of Georgetown, at the site of the present Chain Bridge. At the time it opened, and in official documents, it was referred to as Washington Bridge, Potomac Bridge or simply \\"the Bridge\\" but by the 1830s it began to be called the \\"long Bridge across the Potomac\\" to distinguish it from the bridge near Little Falls. Over time, the colloquial name was shortened to just \\"Long Bridge\\". Built as a timber pile structure with two draw spans, it connected the city of Washington to Alexandria County. The bridge opened to traffic on May 20, 1809 and, at 5000 feet long or a mile including the abutments, was the longest bridge in the United States at the time. On the city of Washington side, it landed at the end of Maryland Avenue SW near 14th Street SW. Before the bridge was built, only a ferryboat connected the city of Washington and Alexandria County. The ferryboat ride made for a treacherous crossing when the river froze as the river was very wide. It was 36 feet wide, with 29 feet for the broad carriageway in the center. The rest was for walkways on each side, protected from center traffic by a guardrail. It was built on 201 piers, with 20 lamps, a 25' wide draw on one side and a 35' wide one on the other. A 100-foot-long wharf was constructed near one of the draws. A board of commissioners oversaw the subscription of stocks to raise capital for the build, not to exceed $200,000, equal to $ today. A toll was put in place with prices set by Congress and posted at the bridge for up to 60 years after opening: * Foot passenger: 6 1/4 cents () * Person and horse: 18 3/4 cents () * Chaise, sulky or riding chair: 37 1/2 cents () * Coach, coachee, stage- wagon, chariot, phaeton or curricle or other riding carriage: 100 cents with an additional 12 1/2 cents for each horse or other animal (more than two) pulling the carriage (equivalent to $ with an additional $ each in ) * Four- wheeled cart, dray or other two-wheeled carriage of burthen: 18 3/4 cents with an additional 12 1/2 cents for each horse or other animal (more than one) pulling the cart (equivalent to $ with an additional $ each in ) * Sheep or swine: 3 cents each (Only one person per team or drove passes for free) () * Horse or neat cattle not pulling a coach or cart or with a rider: 6 1/4 cents (Only one person per team or drove passes for free) () No toll was to be collected for: * Vehicles and passengers with property of the United States * Troops of the United States, Militia, state, or District of Columbia marching in a body, any cannon or equipment belonging to the United States On August 24, 1814 following the Battle of Bladensburg during the War of 1812 the President, officers of the country and American troops used it to retreat to Virginia and burnt the south end of the bridge behind them. The next day, British troops burned the north end of the bridge as they entered the City of Washington. The bridge was repaired by 1818. =Purchase by the United States= On February 22, 1831, high water and ice carried away several spans of the bridge, leading to closure and bankruptcy of the bridge company.Additional damage occurred due to high water and/or ice in 1836, 1841, 1856, 1860, 1863, 1866 and 1887 The following year, Congress purchased the bridge for $20,000 (equal to $ today), and appropriated $60,000 to repair it. However, more funds would be needed to complete the project and the total cost was $114,126. On October 30, 1835, the bridge was reopened with President Andrew Jackson and his Cabinet present. It was to remain in its current state until the mid-1850s. In March of 1847, the Virginia Assembly voted to formally accept the retrocession of Alexandria and Arlington, and thus the south approach of the bridge became part of Virginia. After 1835, the B&O; Railroad was provided access to Washington City through the Northeast quadrant. There were several attempts to bring the railroad to Alexandria City. The A&W; Railroad connected the B&O; Railroad New Jersey Avenue Station located on Capitol Hill to the Long Bridge on the north shore by 1855 and in Alexandria by the end of 1857. However, the Virginia legislature had banned any other connections and tracks were not placed on the bridge. Goods were offloaded, transported over the bridge in omnibuses over the bridge and reloaded on the other side.'

On May 25, 1861, 13,000 Union troops moved in to take control of the bridge along with Alexandria and its railroad. Under the command of Colonel John G. Barnard, Fort Jackson (Virginia) was built to guard the bridge to avoid the passage of spies and invasion by the Confederates with four cannons present in the fort. Competition between railroads became sharper in the District of Columbia, Maryland and Virginia, as the Pennsylvania Railroad sought to break B&O;'s monopoly in the District. Local and federal politics along with personal interests of politicians made it possible for the newcomer to gain access to the city. Pennsylvania Senator Simon Cameron, a stockholder in the PRR-owned Northern Central Railroad, served as Secretary of War from 1861 to 1862, when he was fired due to charges of payoffs and other irregularities, and helped the railroad gain control of the bridge. The PRR was financing the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad (B&P;) to get in the District. At the direction of the military in early 1862, new tracks were laid for the approaches, the rail bed was repaired and tracks were laid across the bridge. The new connection opened on February 9, 1862.On February 11, 1862, Daniel McCallum was appointed Military Director and Superintendent of the Union railroads, with the staff rank of colonel, by Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton. McCallum had authority to \\"enter upon, take possession of, hold and use all railroads, engines, cars, locomotives, and equipment that may be required for the transport of troops, arms, ammunition, and military supplies of the United States, and to do and perform all acts... that may be necessary and proper... for the safe and speedy transport aforesaid,\\" he wrote in an 1866 report.David A. Pfeiffer \\"Working Magic with Cornstalks and Beanpoles: Records Relating to the U.S. Military Railroads during the Civil WarSummer\\" in: Prologue 2011, Vol. 43, No. 2. It quickly became obvious the structure would not be able to withstand heavy loads. Lightly loaded railroad cars were transshipped over the bridge and pulled by horses.

Work on the 5,104 foot bridge began in June 1863 and built a bridge with 203 spans and two 82 foot long draws. It didn't have rail on it when completed and wasn't open. On February 18, 1865, the U.S. Military railroad engine Charles Minot was crossing the old bridge when its weight caused the span to fail. The failure was such that the military decided it was easier and important enough to take possession of the new bridge and install rail on it than repair the old one. The rails were moved to the new bridge - which was then called Railroad Bridge - and the old bridge - then Turnpike Bridge - became used for non-rail traffic only, as had been recommended in the prior year.Norfolk Southern Railway History, \\"Orange and Alexandria Railroad\\" Piedmont Railroaders, Spring 2002. Accessed June 19, 2008. Railroad Bridge opened on February 21, 1865 and carried only railroad traffic. On November 15, 1865, with the end of the war, the U.S. Military Railroad gave the bridge to the U.S. Department of the Interior and the new bridge became part of the Washington, Alexandria and Georgetown Railroad, leased by the B&O.; Sometimes the two bridges were referred to separately as the Long Bridge and the railroad bridge and at others as two parts of one \\"Long Bridge\\". Both the Turnpike Bridge and the Railroad Bridge were damaged in the 1870 flood. Railroad Bridge was partially repaired and continued to be used until May 14, 1872, when a new bridge replaced it. It was then removed in late 1872. During the war, wounded Union soldiers were carried across the bridge to hospitals set up all over the city. The closest was Armory Square Hospital, a few blocks from the bridge. File:Long Bridge, Washington, D.C - NARA - 524976.jpgThe railroad span after rails were moved to it in 1865 1872 Long Bridge An October 1, 1870 flood damaged the existing bridges beyond repair, with much of the causeway, wooden superstructure and spans carried away. Prior to the flood, the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Company had been given the rights to the bridges on the condition that they maintain them. Immediately following the flood they chose to build a replacement bridge which they worked on from November 1870 until it opened on May 15, 1872. The day the new bridge opened, the old railroad bridge, which had been partially repaired, was closed. The new bridge was 36 feet wide with both a carriageway and a railway, 9 feet above the water, and nearly a mile long with solid abutments built of sandstone from Freestone Point and blue gneiss from the quarries above Georgetown. The draws were 61 feet and 96 feet long. The bridge had three parts, a 700 foot long bridge over the Washington Channel, a 2,000 foot-long bridge over the Virginia Channel and a 1,980 foot long earth causeway between masonry walls on the flats between the channels. On July 2, 1872 the Alexandria and Fredericksburg Railway opened, providing the first direct all- rail connection between the north and Richmond, Virginia.PRR Chronology: July 2, 1872 Despite the new design the 1872 bridge continued to be damaged by freshets, it blocked river traffic and was not wide enough for two tracks. On February 12, 1881, ice freshets damaged the bridge by taking out three spans. It re-opened for traffic on February 19, 1881http://www.prrths.com/newprr_files/Hagley/PRR1881.pdf PRR Chronology: 1881 In 1884, the bridge was rebuilt and strengthened.http://www.prrths.com/newprr_files/Hagley/PRR1884.pdf PRR Chronology: 1884http://www.prrths.com/newprr_files/Hagley/PRR1894.pdf PRR Chronology: 1884 On February 7, 1895, the Evening Star reported that the Potomac was frozen near the docks. The ice was five inches thick with an extra two inches of snow on top. The ice was being blocked by the Long Bridge. The bridge acted as a sort of dam and created conditions that could lead to a flood. It had cost the District Government $5,000 to clear the ice in 1893.Fears of Flood - The Evening Star - February 7, 1895 - page 2 Within 30 years, the railroad and regional leaders began making plans for a replacement. On June 30, 1891, the B&P; Railroad granted the Chesapeake & Ohio Railway trackage rights over the bridge to its Washington stationhttp://www.prrths.com/newprr_files/Hagley/PRR1891.pdf PRR Chronology: 1891 On August 1, 1895, the B&P; Railroad granted the use of the bridge to the Washington, Alexandria, and Mount Vernon Electric Railway (streetcars). Power cables were hung and the rent set to $25,000 a year.http://www.prrths.com/newprr_files/Hagley/PRR1895.pdf PRR Chronology: 1895 On February 19, 1898, the Washington Terminal Railway Company incorporated in Virginia, a joint venture of the PRR, RF&P;, ACL, Southern Railway and C&O; but not the B&O.; It acquired the property of the Washington Southern Railway, the B&P; Railroad terminals in Washington and Long Bridge.http://www.prrths.com/newprr_files/Hagley/PRR1898.pdf PRR Chronology: 1898 Two years later, on July 31, 1900, a New Jersey holding company was formed between PRR, ACL, Southern Railway, C&O;, Seaboard Air Line Railway and B&O; to control the line between Richmond, VA and the Long Bridge.http://www.prrths.com/newprr_files/Hagley/PRR1900.pdf PRR Chronology: 1900 In 1901, trackage rights over the bridge were obtained by the Richmond, Fredericksburg and Potomac Railroad, a bridge line owned equally by six companies including the PRR and B&O; (which obtained trackage rights over the PRR to reach the bridge on July 1, 1904). A new railroad bridge was constructed in 1904 and the 1872 Bridge remained in use for vehicles and trolley cars until the 14th Street road bridge was complete.http://www.prrths.com/newprr_files/Hagley/PRR1904.pdf PRR Chronology: 1904 On January 11, 1906, the first streetcars used the 14th Street Bridge southbound, while the northbound cars remain on the old bridge. Northbound streetcars switched on February 12, when the bridge was officially opened as the Highway Bridge. Vehicles continued to use the old bridge until the Highway Bridge was completed in December 1906, making the 1872 bridge obsolete. The bridge was closed on December 18, 1906 and demolition began on January 26, 1907. On December 3, 1907 demolition was completed when markers were placed on the remaining underwater piles of riprap and piers. 1904 Railroad Bridge (Long Bridge) Long Bridge (right) with the Metrorail bridge (center) and the Arland D. Williams, Jr., Memorial Bridge (left) in 1992 In 1899, the Pennsylvania Railroad, owner of the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad (B&P;) Company and thus the bridge, began to push Congress to authorize a replacement of the 1872 Long Bridge with one that would eliminate some of its well- documented problems. They wanted one high enough for sailing vessels to pass beneath, that could serve multiple carriers and end the problems caused by freshets. They also wanted a second bridge for non-rail traffic. The new bridge they proposed would enter the city on a viaduct and, with a tunnel under Virginia Avenue, eliminate all grade-crossings as well as connect to a new Union Station. A February 12, 1901 act of Congress authorized the construction of the new double-track railroad bridge and an adjacent Highway Bridge. The act also led to the creation of the McMillan Plan of 1902 and Union Station completed in 1907. http://www.prrths.com/newprr_files/Hagley/PRR1901.pdf PRR Chronology: 1904 In April of that year the B&P; submitted plans for the railroad bridge to the Secretary of War and the board of engineers overseeing the project which were approved later that year. Work on the new Railroad Bridge, a Pratt through- truss swing bridge, began in the spring of 1902, cost $750,000 and lasted more than 2 years. The new bridge opened on August 28, 1904, about 150 feet (45 m) upriver from the old bridge. The two-track bridge contained girders recycled from the PRR's Lower Trenton Bridge across the Delaware River and was painted a bright red.\\"Ingenuity Marks Bridge Renewal,\\" Railway Age, vol. 118, No. 3 (January 20, 1945): 187‚Äì90. It was 2528.5 feet long (about 450 feet longer than the 1872 Bridge), consisted of eleven spans on twelve stone piers and sat 27 feet above the water line. It created a wider channel, 100 feet wide, on both sides of the pivot than the old bridge did. In the early years, the bridge was often referred to as the \\"Railroad Bridge\\" to distinguish it from \\"Highway Bridge\\". It was also sometimes known as the \\"14th Street Railroad Bridge\\". It wasn't until the 1980s, during planning of the Virginia Railway Express (VRE) system, that the railroad bridge again began to be called by the old \\"Long Bridge\\" name. VRE began using the bridge in 1992. In 1941 the Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington Railroad, created in 1902 by a merger of the B&P; and Philadelphia, Wilmington and Baltimore and thus the owner, began planning to reconstruct the bridge. They sought to build 11 new supplemental piers between the original truss spans and replacing the iron and steel truss spans with steel plate girders. Work on bridge reconstruction began in mid-1942 and completed on November 9, 1943. It allowed heavily loaded trains to cross at 45 mph, whereas before they were limited to 15 mph for freight and 20 mph for passenger trains. The through-truss swing span was retained. In 1955, the Commerce Department performed a study of Washington, DC area drawbridges and determined that the cost and inconvenience of maintaining the draw bridges was not worth the advantages of keeping the river navigable. The three bridges at 14th Street opened only 315 times in 1954 and cost $270,000 to operate and maintain, while also causing traffic tie-ups. Later that year, the Army Corps of Engineers, decided that Potomac River bridges upstream of Hains Point would no longer require a lift or draw span and that once the Mason Bridge was completed, the existing draws would be sealed. Construction of the Mason Bridge was completed in 1962 and the Long Bridge ceased opening except for a few exceptions. The last time it was opened was March 1969 to allow barges used in the removal of the old Highway Bridge to pass through. The tender's control house, or shanty, on top of the draw remained - often used as a billboard for Georgetown crew races until it was removed in late 1982 or early 1983. Ownership of the bridge passed to Penn Central Railroad in 1968 when the Pennsylvania Railroad and its longtime rival New York Central Railroad merged. After Penn Central declared bankruptcy, the bridge was sold to the new Consolidated Rail Corporation (Conrail). In 1991, the RF&P; was merged into CSX Transportation, which acquired the bridge itself in 1998, after the Conrail breakup. In 2011 the District Department of Transportation (DDOT), in coordination with the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA), began a High Speed Intercity Passenger Rail grant-funded comprehensive study for the rehabilitation or replacement of the Long Bridge. After a series of phased studies, the determined that the bridge had inadequate capacity and redundancy. The bridge was rehabilitated in 2016 and CSX determined that it was sufficient to meet their freight needs, but in 2019 DDOT and FRA reported that a second bridge was needed to serve increased passenger rail needs. A third bridge was also proposed to create a new bicycle/pedestrian crossing. On December 19, 2019, Virginia Governor Ralph Northam and rail company CSX Transportation announced a deal to expand rail service in Virginia. As part of the deal, Virginia will build a new two-track bridge parallel to the existing Long Bridge. The new bridge will be used for Amtrak and VRE trains, allowing the Long Bridge to be used solely for freight traffic. The Long Bridge has historically been one of the worst bottlenecks in the national rail system, often operating at 98 percent capacity. The Final Environmental Impact Statement and FRA's Record of Decision was issued on September 4, 2020. This approval clears the way for final engineering design, financing and construction of the Long Bridge expansion.

Only one was completed. Design and development The Zigolo was the first aircraft built at the Centro di Volo a Vela del Politechnico Torino, the Soaring Centre of the Polytechnic of Turin. Designed by the Morelli brothers and intended as a low cost, easy to fly, training glider of modest performance, it was completed in October 1953 after sixteen months' work. The Zigolo was a cantilever high-wing monoplane with a single-spar, single-piece wing, plywood-covered from the front spar around the leading edge to form a torsion-resistant D-box and mounted on top of the fuselage with 2¬∞ of dihedral. Behind the spar the wing was fabric-covered. In plan the central section was rectangular and the outer parts tapered slightly to rounded tips. Frise ailerons filled more than half the span. Originally there were no wing mounted airbrakes or spoilers; rather, the Zigolo had door- type, underwing fuselage-mounted airbrakes but these failed on the first flight and were replaced by conventional spoilers. Its fuselage was decahedral in cross-section, shaped by longerons over formers with ply covering. The single-seat cockpit was immediately ahead of the wing, the upper rear of its one-piece perspex canopy blending into the leading edge. The fuselage tapered aft to a conventional tail, where a constant-chord, round-tipped tailplane and elevator was mounted on top of the fuselage, forward of the rudder hinge. The fin and rudder were straight-edged with rounded tip and heel, the rudder broad and extending down to the keel. Both tail control surfaces were unbalanced. The Zigolo had a short wooden landing skid with rubber shock absorbers which ran from the nose to under the leading edge, but the main gear was a fixed monowheel at about one-third chord. There was also a small tail bumper. The Zigolo made its first flight on 7 April 1954 at the Aeritalia Airport, Turin, flown by Adriano Mantelli. It later flew in Venice.

It was designed by the Morelli brothers and completed in just eight months. The Veltro was a wooden, shoulder wing cantilever monoplane, with a span wing which was straight tapered in plan and had an aspect ratio of 18:1. Its wing was constructed around a main box spar and a lighter auxiliary spar and was made in three pieces, with a central panel long. The wing was skinned with thick plywood, apart from the tight radius leading edge which was made of carefully shaped balsa wood glued to a forward false spar. The trailing edges carried fabric covered slotted ailerons outboard and ply covered slotted flaps which at low deflection angles acted as camber changing, lift increasing devices to increase the speed range and at higher angles (>60¬∞) acted as airbrakes. The wing tips were fitted with tip bodies long and in diameter. The Veltro's slender fuselage was shaped with circular formers and four longerons and skinned with plywood, forming a semi- monocoque structure. The wing was attached with a pair of tapered pins on each side. Forward of the wing a long, one piece perspex canopy reaching almost to the nose covered the cockpit, in which the pilot had a reclining seat to reduce the overall cross sectional area. This was a novelty at the time. Initially, the glider was fitted with an \\"Orthocin√©tique\\" control system, where pitch, roll and yaw were all controlled from a control column fitted with a handlebar; the pilot's feet were then free to operate flaps or undercarriage. This system was never flown. Behind the wing the fuselage had a circular cross-section, tapering to a then novel T-tail. The horizontal tail, straight tapered with ply covered tailplane and fabric covered elevator, was positioned on top of an unusually low aspect ratio ply skinned fin and fabric covered rudder. Flight testing showed the tailplane, out of the wing wake, worked well but the rudder tended to lock in side slips. This problem was cured with the addition of a dorsal fin and yaw control was later improved with a double slotted rudder, hinged well ahead of the fin trailing edge. The undercarriage was retractable, with a pair of small wheels on the end of a trailing arm, each fitted with a vertical shock absorber; the arm was slightly kinked to tuck the wheels almost entirely within the fuselage when retracted and also to act as a protective skid on rough ground. There was a small tail bumper. Operational history Antonio Angeloni piloted the Veltro on its first flight on 9 September 1954 from Turin. It did not attend the 1954 or 1956 World Gliding Championships but did compete in the Italian Nationals of 1957 and 1958. On 3 March 1956 Alberto Morelli flew it to an altitude of using wave lift over mountains around the Susa Valley. In August 1957 it set a new Italian distance record, flying between Rieti and Barletta. Though only one Veltro was built and the opportunity of international exposure lost, it was nonetheless an influential design.

Completed in 1961, it was a refined version of the earlier CVT2 Veltro. Design and development The Strale was a refinement of the pioneering CVT2 Veltro of 1954. The Veltro went from design commencement to completion in eight months; the Strale, started in 1955, was not finished until July 1961, even though the two aircraft had much in common. The main differences between the Veltro and the Strale were in the wing, even though these had a similar straight tapered plan and used the same laminar flow NACA airfoil sections. The Starle's wing was constructed, like that of the Veltro, around a forward main box spar and a lighter secondary spar aft but was in two rather than three parts. The outer span washout and the tip bodies were discarded. The span was increased by , which raised the aspect ratio from 18 to 19.3. Each aileron of the Strale was shortened by and plywood covered, and the combined flaps/airbrakes of the Veltro were discarded, replaced by spoilers. These were similar to those used on the CVT M-100S: mounted immediately behind the main spar at about one third span, each set consisted of five plates that rotated about chordwise axes out of the wing, each plate projecting both above and below. The two sets rotated in opposite directions and proved to be very effective. The Strale was a high wing rather than shoulder wing design, reducing aerodynamic interference over the upper surface. It had a slightly deeper cockpit and a single wheeled version of the Veltro's trailing arm, retractable undercarriage, the wheel with its single shock absorber now totally within the fuselage after retraction. The slender rear fuselages and low T-tails of the two gliders were very similar, though the dorsal fin added after flight testing to the Veltro was more smoothly faired into the fin of the Strale. The double slotted rudder was increased in area by about 11%, lowering its aspect ratio still further and making the overall fuselage length greater. The Strale made its first flight in July 1961 and after some testing took part in the Italian National Gliding Competition in Perugia early that August. Like the Veltro, it was seen as an experimental aircraft and only one was built.

Thomas was the son of a clergyman in Cambridgeshire. He was educated at Shrewsbury School and Christ Church, Oxford, before he embarked on a short-lived career as a schoolmaster. Finding that work unpleasant, he turned his attention to writing articles for newspapers and periodicals and began to write books. During the early part of the First World War, Thomas defied military authorities to report news stories from the Western Front for his employer, the Daily Mail. As a result, he was briefly arrested before being granted official accreditation as a war correspondent. His reportage for the remainder of the war received national recognition, despite being criticised by some and parodied by soldiers. His book With the British on the Somme (1917) portrayed the English soldier in a very favourable light. Both France and Britain rewarded him with knighthoods after the war, but Thomas regretted some of his wartime output. Thomas's primary interest as an adult was in rural matters. He was conservative in his views and after the Second World War feared that the Labour government regarded the countryside only from an economic perspective. He was an advocate for the creation of national parks in England and Wales and mourned the decline of traditional village society. He wrote extensively, particularly for The Observer newspaper and The Spectator, a conservative magazine. His book The English Landscape (1938) included selections from his contributions to Country Life magazine.  Childhood and education  William Beach Thomas was born on 22 May 1868 in Godmanchester, in the county of Huntingdonshire, England. He was the second son of Daniel George Thomas and his wife, Rosa Beart. In 1872, his father was appointed rector of Hamerton and the countryside location of that parish inspired an affection in Beach Thomas which greatly influenced his later observational writings about natural history and rural subjects. Beach Thomas was not a hyphenated double-barrelled name; he used his middle name, Beach, as part of his name as a writer, and in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography his name is \\"Thomas, William Beach\\". Thomas attended Shrewsbury School from 1882. He was a keen sportsman there and was appointed huntsman to the Royal Shrewsbury School Hunt, the world's oldest cross-country running club. He continued his interest in sports after earning an exhibition to Christ Church, Oxford, in 1887 and became a Blue, representing the university in various running events over several years. He became president of the Oxford University Athletics Club and played association football, rugby union, and cricket at college level. J. B. Atkins, who competed against him for the University of Cambridge athletics team, said: \\"With his stately height and gigantic stride, he was magnificent in action; his final effort, always, triumphant, when he saw the goal of all, the tape, waiting for him, was a sight never to be forgotten ‚Äì though I had a strong reason for regretting it at the time.\\" His exhibition was superseded by a scholarship but he was not academically successful, managing only a third- class degree.  Early career  Athletic prowess and the time spent in achieving it may have contributed to Thomas's poor academic performance, but probably also assisted him in getting his first job. He taught at Bradfield College, a public school, after leaving Oxford in 1891. Although he described teaching as \\"uncongenial\\", he subsequently took a similar position at Dulwich College in 1897, where he remained until the following year. Journalism became the object of his interest; he contributed columns for The Globe, The Outlook and The Saturday Review, as well as for many other publications of which he was not a member of staff. He also wrote a book entitled Athletics, published by Ward Lock & Co in 1901, following his contribution of a chapter titled \\"Athletics and Schools\\" to the Athletics volume in the Badminton Library series, published by Longman, Green & Co in 1900 and edited by Montague Shearman. He became a regular reviewer for The Times Literary Supplement from its formation in 1902. The Daily Mail took on Thomas as a writer of material relating to the countryside. Lord Northcliffe, who owned the newspaper, recognised that Thomas needed to live in a rural environment if he was to perform his duties well. This understanding delighted Thomas, because it meant he could limit his visits to London. He moved to the Mimram Valley in Hertfordshire, and thereafter held Northcliffe in high regard. Thomas reported on the 78th meeting of the British Association in Dublin in 1908. Thomas's From a Hertfordshire Cottage was published in 1908, followed by a three-volume collaboration with A. K. Collett, The English Year (1913‚Äì14). He did not entirely abandon his interest in athletics and was one of those in Britain who criticised his country's poor performance in the 1912 Olympic Games. Writing that the Olympics were by then being seen as a measure of \\"national vitality\\", he explained  War correspondent  alt=A group photograph of several men in uniform who are standing around an unexploded shell that is standing pointed- end up from the ground. The Daily Mail sent William Beach Thomas to France as a war correspondent during the First World War. Many newspapers were keen to support the war effort and to take advantage of the demand for news from the front. The British military authorities were opposed to the presence of journalists, preferring instead to control the media by issuing official press releases. Lord Kitchener in particular was opposed to their presence, having had bad experiences of journalists during the South African War. He formed a press bureau headed by , and demanded that all reports be channelled through the bureau, for review by censors; the resulting output was bland and impersonal. The newspapers countered with subterfuge. Thomas was one of several journalists who managed to reach the front lines in Belgium. He was discovered there and imprisoned for some time by the British Army. He described the episode as \\"the longest walking tour of my life, and the queerest\\". Even these early unapproved reports, which consisted mostly of human interest stories because there was little opportunity for contact with the British Expeditionary Force, were censored at home owing to a paradox that Thomas described: \\"the censors would not publish any article if it indicated that the writer had seen what he wrote of. He must write what he thought was true, not what he knew to be true.\\" When the British government relented in mid-1915, having been warned by Theodore Roosevelt that the reporting limitations were affecting public opinion in the United States, Valentine Williams became the Daily Mail's first accredited war correspondent. No longer in prison, Thomas resumed his war reporting in December of the same year, when Williams enlisted in the Irish Guards. As with the other accredited journalists, Thomas was paid by the War Office rather than by his newspaper, and all the correspondents were assured that they would be able to publish memoirs of their service to offset the differential between an officer's pay and that of a journalist. Thomas filed reports from places such as the Somme in a format matching that of his colleagues, who regularly downplayed the unpleasant aspects of the conflict, such as the nature of death. His reports were published in the Daily Mirror as well as the Daily Mail. The soldiers derided the attempts that were made to indoctrinate them, but the British public was more susceptible. Philip Gibbs, a fellow war correspondent, noted that he and his colleagues \\"identified absolutely with the Armies in the field ... There was no need of censorship in our despatches. We were our own censors.\\" The journalistic support for the cause was appreciated by military commanders such as Douglas Haig, who saw the propaganda generated by the correspondents as an integral part of the Allies' efforts. Haig eventually went so far as to ask Gibbs and Thomas to produce his own weekly news-sheet. Public opinion at home may have been mollified, even uplifted, by the efforts of the correspondents, but the morale of the troops wasnot, despite the high demand among them for newspapers from home. One soldier, Albert Rochester, was court martialled for attempting to send to the Daily Mail a letter that stated the realities as he saw them and was critical of Thomas's work, noting the \\"ridiculous reports regarding the love and fellowship existing between officers and men\\". William Beach Thomas himself later regretted his wartime reports from the Somme, saying, \\"I was thoroughly and deeply ashamed of what I had written for the good reason that it was untrue ... the vulgarity of enormous headlines and the enormity of one's own name did not lessen the shame.\\" British Mark I male tank at the Somme, September 1916. Photograph by Ernest Brooks.alt=A black-and-white photograph of a First World War tank. Northcliffe's brother, Lord Rothermere, expressed frustration with the war correspondents: \\"They don't know the truth, they don't speak the truth, and we know that they don't.\\" Stephen Badsey, a historian who specialises in the First World War, has noted that their situation was not easy as they \\"found themselves as minor players trapped in a complicated hierarchical structure dominated by politicians, generals and newspaper owners\\". Thomas received particular opprobrium. Paul Fussell, the historian, describes him as \\"notoriously fatuous\\" during the war period. Peter Stothard, editor of The Times between 1992 and 2002, describes him as \\"a quietly successful countryside columnist and literary gent who became a calamitous Daily Mail war correspondent\\" and believes that he may have been the inspiration for the character of William Boot in Evelyn Waugh's novel Scoop. John Simpson, a war correspondent, describes Thomas as \\"charming but unlovable\\" and thinks that the soldiers despised him more than they did the other British war correspondents, even though all those journalists were playing a similar disinformation role. They considered his writing to be a trivialisation of the realities of war, jingoistic, pompous and particularly self-promoting, often giving the reader an impression that he was writing from the battlefield when in fact he was being fed information of dubious value by the military authorities while based in their headquarters. An example of Thomas's reporting is as follows: Thomas's style was parodied using the by-line of Teech Bomas in the Wipers Times, a trench newspaper, but he was lauded by the readers back in Britain. One example from the Wipers Times, based on a report published in the Daily Mail of 18 September 1916, reads: King George V at Abbeville on 9 June 1917. Photograph by Ernest Brooks.alt=A black-and-white photograph showing a uniformed man on the left who is stooping slightly forward as he holds the hand of a man on the right, who is the king. Also in the photograph are many other uniformed men, forming a group mostly behind the two main subjects. A woman wearing a feathered hat stands to the left side of the king. In 1918, William Beach Thomas published a book based on his wartime experiences, entitled With the British on the Somme. It was a favourable depiction specifically of the English soldier, somewhat contrary to the official line that tried to emphasise that this was a British war rather than an English one. A review in The Times Literary Supplement noted that Thomas In 1918, Northcliffe asked Thomas to travel to the US. According to Thomas, the rationale for the trip was that \\"he didn't know what the Americans were doing, and they did not know what we were thinking\\". He met with influential people such as Henry Ford, Theodore Roosevelt, and Woodrow Wilson during this visit. William Beach Thomas sometimes accompanied King George V and the Prince of Wales on their visits to France, noting on one occasion a situation he considered reminiscent of Henry II and Thomas Becket: Thomas's war work led to official recognition, as it did for many of the correspondents and newspaper owners; France made him a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour in 1919 and he was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1920. In 1923, Gibbs said of the KBE, which he too received: \\"I was not covetous of that knighthood and indeed shrank from it so much that I entered into a compact with Beach Thomas to refuse it. But things had gone too far, and we could not reject the title with any decency.\\" This quandary was caused by realisation of the gulf between what they had reported and what had actually happened.  Later years  After the war, Thomas stayed in Germany until 1919 and returned there in 1923 at the time of the Occupation of the Ruhr. He also undertook a tour of the world for the Daily Mail and The Times in 1922. His main focus returned to his lifelong interest in matters of the countryside, notably in his writings for The Observer from 1923 to 1956. Thomas was also a regular contributor of notes on nature, gardening and country life to The Spectator for almost thirty years, with some short breaks between 1935 and 1941, when H. E. Bates took over responsibility. In 1928 Thomas produced a history of the magazine under the title of The Story of the 'Spectator, in commemoration of its centenary. He wrote many more books and articles in his later years, as well as two autobiographical books: A Traveller in News (1925) and The Way of a Countryman (1944). Fond of peppering quotations throughout his writing, his style was considered to be clear but his hand was poor; a profile of him in The Observer said \\"perhaps he gave less pleasure to those who had to decipher his handwriting. Rarely has more limpid English been conveyed in a script more obscure.\\" George Orwell wrote in the Manchester Evening News: Even as traditional English village life was in collapse, Thomas saw the romanticised paternalism and general life of the village as the epitome of English society and equivalent to anything that might be found elsewhere in the world. He said that one of the aspects of village life he admired was that \\"comparative wealth [there] is admired, not envied\\". He also viewed the natural world as something to be wondered at rather than scientifically examined. In his last column for The Spectator, written in September 1950, he wrote: In his desire to encourage a love of the countryside, especially during the Second World War, William Beach Thomas was similar to other writers on rural matters, such as G. M. Trevelyan and H. J. Massingham. He described Massingham as \\"perhaps the best of all present writers on Rural England\\" and considered him among those writers who were \\"so fond of the past that they seem sometimes almost to despair of the future\\". Malcolm Chase, a historian, says that these authors, including Thomas himself, advocated an ultra-conservative, socially reactionary and idealistic philosophy that formed an important part of a national debate about the future of the land and agriculture. This attitude was coupled with an increasing public interest in pastimes such as cycling, motoring and walking; it was supported by the publication of popular, fairly cheap and colourful articles, books and maps that catered both to those pursuing such interests and those who were concerned about conservation and the effects of the influx of urban and suburban visitors. John Musty, in his comparative literary review of the works of Thomas and Massingham, believes that Thomas had a more \\"gentle touch\\" than Massingham, whose writings have \\"frequently been judged as narrow and reactionary\\"; he quotes Thomas as saying of the likes of Massingham that they \\"preach an impossible creed, albeit an attractive one\\". Panorama of some of the alt=Colour photograph Much of one of Thomas's books, The English Landscape (1938), had previously appeared in various issues of Country Life magazine, and in part echoed concerns raised by Clough Williams-Ellis in works such as his England and the Octopus (1928). Williams-Ellis believed that building on greenfield land was too great a price to pay for socio-economic progress. Thomas argued in favour of protecting open spaces by creating national parks, for which he thought that the coastline would be the most suitable candidate. He stressed the relationship between the people and the land and saw a need for planning control to manage human ingress into areas that remained mostly untouched. In 1934 he supported the Nature Lovers Association in its appeal to make the mountainous Snowdonia region, near the coast of North Wales, such an entity. He also supported the Commons, Open Spaces and Footpaths Preservation Society. In 1931 Thomas lamented the inability of the National Farmers Union of England and Wales to hold up what he saw as the decline of the farming industry. In A Countryman's Creed (1946) he harked back to a lost world, perhaps even a world that was more of his imagination than it was ever real. As F. R. Leavis had done before him, Thomas sought a rural revival to curtail what he saw as the rapid changes to traditional ways of life that had been evident in particular in the aftermath of the First World War and which were now ideologically challenged following the substantial victory of the socialist Labour Party in the 1945 general election. The new government was a threat to Thomas's view of the world because, in the words of the literary critic Robert Hemmings, it saw the countryside \\"as merely a giant dairy and granary for the city\\". Thomas was opposed to the use of the toothed steel trap for catching rabbits, supporting the RSPCA in its efforts to outlaw the device and noting that it inflicted unnecessary pain and was indiscriminate in nature, sometimes trapping other animals, such as domesticated cattle and pet dogs.  Personal life and death  William Beach Thomas married Helen Dorothea Harcourt, a daughter of Augustus George Vernon Harcourt, in April 1900, and with her had three sons and a daughter. Their second son, Michael Beach Thomas, was killed in 1941 while serving as a naval officer during the Second World War. Helen survived her husband, who died on 12 May 1957 at their home, \\"High Trees\\", Gustardwood, Wheathampstead, Hertfordshire. He was buried in the village churchyard at St Helen's Church.

Hearst was viewed with suspicion as a 'television man' by his new colleagues, and according to producer Philip French had \\"a degree of contempt\\" for radio which was \\"never made absolutely explicit\\", but did nevertheless create \\"a relaxed atmosphere\\" at Radio 3. Hearst clashed with music department colleagues who attempted to resist his toning down of an overtly academic approach to introducing classical music and he came up with the practice of 'themed' evenings or weekends, a policy which still continues, as well as giving titles to concerts.

His family fled Ukraine for Mexico after the Russian Revolution to escape Jewish persecution and Filcer grew up in Mexico City. His interest in painting came early but had to sell a painting before his family would accept his vocation. Strongly influenced by Van Gogh‚Äôs life, he began to draw and paint the struggles of everyday people, something he has continued since. His work has been exhibited in various countries of the world and has been recognized with several medals and membership in the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana. Life Filcer was born in Zhytomyr, Ukraine in 1927 to a Jewish family. When he was only six months old, the family fled the country because of Jewish persecution after the Russian Revolution. No one in his family would talk about the horrors they experienced in the Ukraine. After arriving to Mexico City, the family settled in the La Lagunilla neighborhood. His father was able to speak only a few words in Spanish and sold clothing in the streets. He later formed a partnership with other immigrants to open a sweater factory. Since childhood, Filcer disliked school but learned to draw. He also studied accounting in order to help his father. He stated that although working at the family business was hard, he was able to meet many people in this way, for whom he often drew pictures for fun. When he was sixteen he entered the Academy of San Carlos to study painting, attending class in the morning and working in the afternoon. Each evening after the close of business, he painted. He later studied at the workshop of Spanish painter Jos√© Bardasano for three years, focusing on drawing and painting. At age seventeen, Filcer read the biography of Van Gogh, and after observing the poverty of the market workers began to draw them. He then decided to travel to Guanajuato to learn and draw miners and the difficult conditions under which they worked. Although his art instructors encouraged him, his father saw painting as nothing more than a hobby. Filcer had decided to make painting a career but could not convince his father to approve until he had sold his first painting at the Galer√≠a Romano. An award at the C√≠rculo de Bellas Artes allowed Filcer to obtain a scholarship to live and study for two and a half years in Paris and Rome, beginning at the √âcole nationale sup√©rieure des Beaux-Arts in Paris. However, in addition to spending hours of his own time drawing models at the academy, he also drew and painted common people such as fishermen, peasants, stevedores, factory workers and beggars. He did this activity with a friend named Juvenal Sans√≥, which whom he went to Rome to continue his studies. However, a teacher there asked him why he did not paint more Bohemian people, which angered him. He left the Italian school after only a month. While in Europe, Filcer spent time traveling and visiting museums in London, Madrid, Amsterdam, Rome and Florence, studying the paintings there. He stated that he learned more in this way, with his first views of works by Francisco de Goya changing his life. Van Gogh's work also strongly affected him. Career Over his career, Filcer has had over 300 exhibition around the world, especially Mexico, the Netherlands, the United States, Belgium, Japan, France, Israel, Italy and Germany. He began his career in Mexico, where he sold his first painting and in 1949 worked at the Taller de Gr√°fica Popular. He represented Mexico in biennales in Chile, Japan and England, which led to a scholarship to study in Paris and Rome. His work was also part of an exhibition organized by the Palacio de Bellas Artes called Jewels of Mexican Art which traveled the world for fifteen years. In 1957, Filcer returned to Mexico and at first worked on paintings for the Galer√≠a Havre. Success at this showing allowed the artist to return to Europe and visit Jerusalem. He also traveled to various cities in the United States. Filcer married a Dutch woman and stayed in the Netherlands for twenty years, with many individual exhibitions in the country including the Heart Ripper, De Beyerd, Van Bommel-van Dam and Frans Hals museums, as well as the Grand Palais in Paris in 1988. He then returned to Mexico where he had exhibitions in 1990 and 1991 at the Museo de Arte Moderno, the Museo Contempor√°neo de Arte at UNAM in 1994, the Museo de la Estampa in Mexico City in 1998, in 2000 he had exhibitions at the Centro Cultural Mexiquense and the Museo Casa del Risco. In 2001, he had exhibitions at the Museo Francisco Goitia in Zacatecas and the Jaski Gallery in Amsterdam. Recognitions for Filcer's work include gold and silver medals from the C√≠rculo de Bellas Artes in 1949 and 1950 and the Jos√© Clemente Orozco gold medal in 1953. In 1998, he was named a Knight of the City of Maastricht. He is also a member of the Sal√≥n de la Pl√°stica Mexicana. Artistry Filcer settled on an aesthetic early, primarily in the use of chiaroscuro to express drama and strong Expressionism. He is inclined towards thick brushstrokes for strong, sudden effect. He declares himself a ‚Äúfervent admirer of Van Gogh, Goya and Jos√© Clemente Orozco.‚Äù He was influenced by the works of Van Gogh which depicted the hard life of miners as well as Goya's depictions of war. Influence from Jos√© Clemente Orozco is evident in some of his works, especially in sarcasm. He stated ‚ÄúI paint all that I experience including my fantasies and demons; I am an Expressionist and I paint what stirs my emotions. His work does not depict idealism, but rather explores themes of justice and injustice to provoke change. He is concerned with the ‚Äúdecadent communication‚Äù that dominates among people and he mocks indifference, intolerance and misunderstanding. His figures show experience, faces and emaciated bodies struggling to survive. His topics are frank and defined. He has done works related to the Tlatelolco massacre, casinos in Las Vegas, the Mexican Revolution and the Mexico City Metro.

In the Middle Ages it was one of Diocese of Strasbourg's nine parish churches. On 22 May 1398 the Chapter of the Abbey of Honau, which had been in Rhinau since 1290, moved to Old St Peter's because of flooding in Rhinau. The Chapter stayed there until 1529, conducting its services in the choir, while the parish occupied the nave. When the Catholic rite was restored in 1683, the Chapter returned to the Church and stayed there until 1790, when it was wound up. On 20 February 1529, when Strasbourg openly joined the Reformation and suspended the practice of the mass, the Church became Lutheran. Martin Bucer and the other Strasbourg reformers had campaigned for several years to have Protestant services in all of Strasbourg's churches, but in 1525 the city council had voted to retain the mass in several churches, including Old St Peter's. In 1535, in the context of the Reform, a Latin school, or 'Middle school' was opened at Old Saint Peters. In 1683, two years after the annexation of Strasbourg by France, Louis XIV ordered that part of the Church be returned to the Catholics and that a wall be constructed inside the church by the rood screen, to restrict the Protestant services to the Nave. It was not until 2012 that a door was opened in this dividing wall. In the 19th century, the Catholic part of the Church was extended. The extension was designed by the architect Conrath and opened in 1867. The 1762 pipe organ of the Catholic part was moved to the Church of Saint Maurice in Soultz-les-Bains in 1865.

John Rivers engineered the recordings. Scream And Shout was regularly played at the band's live shows and was included as a bonus track on the Enhanced CD version of the band's debut album, Vibrate You.  Video  The Big Isn't Beautiful release was accompanied by King Adora's first music video, directed by Moritz. Part of the video was shot in the window of a branch of Ann Summers, across Tottenham Court Road from the Astoria in London, the venue at which the band would perform the biggest headlining gig of their career in 2001.  Reception  The NME gave the song a mixed review, saying \\"after a couple of minutes of these standard-issue, pirouetting grunge chords, Browne's self-dramatising vocals, only the most soft-hearted wouldn't feel the urge to shove a pork pie in his mouth\\". The Tip Sheet named it their record of the week, commenting \\"we're not sure how offensive it is, but it's certainly more interesting than average and anyway, we can't really bring ourselves to worry about it because we like the tune so much\\". Melody Maker were positive (\\"a-Pop-lectic fuzz-fest, a delicious velvet-wrapped parcle of punkish ambiguity\\") but elected to give the single only 2/5.

My 1st Chemistry Set is the debut collaboration album by Detroit rapper Boldy James and producer The Alchemist, released on October 15, 2013 through Decon. It was preceded by Boldy James' EP, Grand Quarters (2013). M.1.C.S. was entirely produced by The Alchemist and features guest appearances from Action Bronson, Domo Genesis, Earl Sweatshirt, Freeway, King Chip and Vince Staples among others. On September 12, 2013, the lead single from the album, \\"Moochie,\\" was leaked onto the Internet. The following single, \\"Reform School,\\" was leaked on October 7, 2013. M.1.C.S. was generally well received by music critics. Complex named it amongst the best albums of October 2013. Critical reception Upon its release, My 1st Chemistry Set was met with generally favorable reviews from music critics. Exclaim! reviewer, Chayne Japal, gave the album a seven out of ten, saying \\"Throughout, the simplified rawness of Boldy James's style matches up perfectly with Alchemist's minimalist production, offering up yet another sneaky slow-burner of a collab from the journeyman producer.\\" Pitchfork Media's Jayson Greene, gave the album a 7.4 out of ten, saying \\"There are guests that breeze through. [...] But none of them eclipse Boldy, who makes the most of this opportunity and delivers some of the best verses of his career. He has been steadily deepening, as a writer and rapper, and by now, the lousy emotional weather of QB rap is his own, a personal storm cloud he generates wherever he goes.\\" Jay Balfour of HipHopDX gave the album a 3.5 out of five, saying \\"Throughout the whole project, James is consistent, even when transitioning from understated brags to self-conscious street worries. Particularly with his penchant for witty slang, his style doesn't seem derived or lifted despite obvious similarities. Still, he‚Äôs sure footed enough to know where he stands.\\" Winston Cook-Wilson of eMusic gave the album three stars out of five, saying \\"This type of content, as well as Alchemist's inventively blunted, Return of the Mac-style beats, will increase the comparisons to Prodigy that James is probably used to getting by now. But though his music is situated in that tradition of gangsta rap, he's distinguished from this comparison and others by a love of the sound of words ‚Äî as much as their import ‚Äî which manifests itself in a singular way. He crafts deceptively complex internal rhyme schemes, and positions his vowel sounds close enough to one another to continue the patterns until he's exhausted their potential. He uses words carefully and as sparingly as possible, which often makes the breathing room left after a murmured threat as important as the line itself.\\" AllMusic reviewer, David Jeffries, gave the album three and a half stars out of five, saying \\"Vivid details throughout the album seem like ammunition for any possible prosecution team, so be aware, this one is brutal, nihilistic, frightening, and unforgivable, but it's \\"eye for an eye\\" music with a creative spark, and a great step toward the realm of The Infamous.\\" XXL reviewer, Chris Mench, gave the album an XL, saying \\"Despite occasional moments of levity, the album is a hazy trip through the triumphs and tragedies of gang life on the streets of one of America‚Äôs most troubled cities. Boldy James' lyrical finesse and knack for storytelling are on full display as he sails over powerful, yet understated production from Alchemist. His no rush delivery allows the weight of his stories to sink in, and ultimately he succeeds at putting Detroit on the map, this time for the right reasons.\\" Track listing *All tracks were produced by Alchemist.

His interest as an investigator relies in connecting history with math and statistics. Carlos Gardel birthplace dispute He became known in a reportage of the 'Diario el Pa√≠s de Montevideo' on June 24, 2012,Tesis de matem√°tico confirma que Gardel naci√≥ en Uruguay en 1887 (entrevista realizada a Eduardo Cuiti√±o), subt√≠tulo: Aniversario de la muerte del \\"Mago\\". Una combinaci√≥n de gr√°ficas estad√≠sticas, estudios gen√©ticos y an√°lisis de fotograf√≠as aportan nueva luz sobre un viejo misterio. La estatura del cantante es clave, digital site 'El Pa√≠s', June 24, 2012. where he exposed that from his calculations Carlos Gardel could not be born in 1890 nor in 1883 or 1884 as it was debated in the moment, but in the early months of 1887. In May 2012, under the editorial house 'Fin de Siglo', Eduardo Cuiti√±o published \\"Gardel el muerto que habla\\" (Gardel, the dead that speaks)Intervenci√≥n de Eduardo Cuiti√±o en la presentaci√≥n de ‚ÄúGardel; el muerto que habla‚Äù, digital site 'Fin de Siglo', mai 28 2013 (ficha del libro). (book that was presented by engineer Juan Grompone along with the author Susana CabreraPresentaci√≥n del libro \\"Gardel, el muerto que habla\\", Teatro de la Asociaci√≥n Cristiana de J√≥venes, mai 28 2013. ), and were the mentioned Uruguayan author plays with Gardel's favorite number for his gamble, 48, that would be the age that according to him Gardel would have by the time of his death. In his essay, the mentioned author bases how the particular biology of Carlos Gardel is explained as the result of an incestuous relation between Carlos Escayola and Mar√≠a Leila Oliva, pointing that the presidio of the singer in Ushuaia jail and the falsity of a supposed holographic test. Besides, it is based the existence of another child, truly French and documented, with whom Carlos Gardel was associated to gain his author and image rights, in base of a 1904 document. Gardel in 1904 was detained in a commissariat in Florencio Varela, and according to the statements in the records, he had a height of 160 centimeters. To reconcile biologically that height with the supposed French boy, the true height should have been 140 centimeters. Eduardo Cuiti√±o was interviewed by different press media to that regard, and his thesis on the origin of Carlos Gardel received a strong accolade by taking officially by the Mayor's Office of Tacuaremb√≥ Gardel's year of birth 1887, respecting what Gardel in life left in all his documents: Uruguayan, born in Tacuaremb√≥ in 1887. Despite the height analysis by Cuiti√±o, scholars around the world generally accept that Gardel was born in 1890 in Toulouse, France, based on a verified contemporary birth certificate signed by his mother, rather than the second one that Gardel ordered to be made in Buenos Aires in 1920 when he was 29 years old. The Toulouse birth certificate was verified by a research team in 2012. Scholars such as Vanderbilt University history professor Simon Collier, University of Belgrano agriculture history professor Osvaldo Barsky and Uruguayan history professor Jorge Ruffinelli from Stanford University write about the birthplace dispute and how Gardel must have been born in France. It is accepted that Gardel was raised in Buenos Aires from an early age, and that he falsified his birthplace documents in 1920 to avoid problems with the French military, because he was a French citizen by birth but he failed to register for World War I as required. Gardel probably chose Uruguay as a false birthplace because Uruguay was neutral during the war. Scholars generally agree that Gardel never lived in Uruguay.Carlos Gardel was born in France: Bocaz, Luis (March 1986). \\"Tango Time\\", UNESCO Courier, p. 11. Jack the Ripper Actually, Eduardo Cuiti√±o is concentrated in a new essay on the true identity of Jack the Ripper, on who he has already published a novel ‚ÄúViajando en el tiempo para atrapar a Jack el Destripador\\" (Traveling in time to catch Jack the Ripper).Eduardo Cuiti√±o, ‚ÄúViajando en el tiempo para atrapar a Jack el Destripador‚Äù, digital site 'Pombo & Pombo', September 27, 2012. Again, according to his calculations, the mythic Jack the Ripper would be no other that Stephen Herbert Appleford, who surely did not acted alone. With his investigation, Eduardo Cuiti√±o, adds to the short list of authors that in Latin America have seriously addressed the issue of \\"Jack the Ripper\\", this way he sums his name to those of the Nicaraguan Arqu√≠mides Gonz√°lez and his compatriot Gabriel Pombo.
