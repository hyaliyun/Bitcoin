It is popular in Hong Kong among higher class people in the period of 1950s-1970s, offering a range of classical haircut until today. Other than hair-cutting, Shanghai style barber shops provide different unique services include trimming, massaging, nails clipping, etc. Despite the sunset of Shanghai style barber shop in Hong Kong in the modern days, it still attracts loyal customers, especially among males, and costs around HK$70 for a haircut and shave using traditional clippers.  History= Golden age in Shanghai (1920s-1930s)  Much rich and middle class that can afford the high quality of lifestyle settled in Shanghai in the 1920s and 1930s. Western-style barber shops were popular among them because of western admiration and trend pursuit. But then, some oversea Chinese businessmen, strong entrepreneurs, and local Shanghainese businessmen were interested in the hair-styling, which got a potential to make a good profit. With Shanghai businessmen‚Äôs smartness in business strategy, western-style barber shops and existing local barber shops were increasingly replaced by Shanghai-style barber shops.  Golden age in Hong Kong (1950s-1970s)  Between 1940 and 1950, many Shanghainese immigrated to Hong Kong with their capital and skills. Some of them were Shanghai-style barbers. They had a concept of grooming to retune and upgrade Hong Kong‚Äôs grooming culture in those earlier times. As Hong Kong became the colony of British, the situation changed and allowed them to develop in this new environment with their professional skills. During the heyday of the Shanghai-style barber shop in the 1960s to 1970s, every industry in Hong Kong was booming as the society was developing. According to the owner of Shanghai- style Ngan Kwan Salon in Un Chau Street, Shamshuipo which has a history of 40 years, ‚ÄúAt the peak of the business, the salon employed as many as 36, including barbers, hair washers, cosmeticians, and manicurists.‚Äù  Sunset age in Hong Kong (After the 1970s)  The development of Shanghai style barber shop started to decline since the 1970s till now. There are few barber shops scattered in Hong Kong. There are mainly four reasons for the decline of the industry. According to one of the barbers Mr. Ma of Shanghai-style Ngan Kwan Salon in Un Chau Street, Shamshuipo, the salon employed more than 30 workers during peak hour in the old days. But now there are only nine barbers left. Firstly, many barbers retired. According to the Shanghai-style Ngan Kwan Salon in Un Chau Street, Shamshuipo, one of the barbers Mr. Ma 'Most of them left because they were getting old and wanted to retire. 'Also, their children have all grown up, and they don't need to work anymore. Secondly, there is a lack of new blood participation. The decline in the business has also led to fewer workers in the industry. Barber Wong and his peers now have to do everything themselves; hair washing, cutting, blow-drying and shaving. There are no newcomers entered the industry for the past 20 years. Barber Wong said if they want to be a hairstylist, they'd rather go to those modern salons and this had hastened the industry's decline. Thirdly, there is a rise in rents. Lin, who is in charge of beauty treatment and manicure at a Shanghai barber shop in North Point said rent is the hardest thing to cover in their operation. Fourthly, there is the changing trend of beauty. Where they were once seen as stylish, Shanghai barber shops are now seen as old-fashioned.  Culture = Fashion created in the old days  Shanghai barbers, coming from a modern and developed city, brought classic Shanghai hairstyles to Hong Kong, attracting people from high class in the city from 1950s-1970s. Haircutting is popular before Lunar New Year Festival, meaning good luck and a new change for the coming year According to a Shanghai barber, Yan, he commented that haircutting was an act to show self-respect other than styles. For men, the barbers would give a short and neat hairstyle, like an ‚Äúegg tart‚Äù cut (Pompadour hairstyle), which were populated among professionals and educational people in the old times, and an Omega (nickname for a flip) for women. Customers could often have their chemical-free perms last for a week than a modern salon. However, neither men nor women could find trendy haircut in the Shanghai style Barber Shop. The youngest look provided for men is only the hairstyles in the 80s while hairstyles of female pop stars in the 70s for ladies. It is because Shanghai barbers mostly learn from their masters, they regard that these hairstyles are simple but difficult classical style which are for people in the high class. Hairstyles for men and women * The professional cut (Ëä±ÊóóË£ù) * The butch cut (ÂúìÈ†≠Ë£ù, Ê∏∏Ê≥≥Ë£ù) * The Army cut (Èô∏ËªçË£ù) * The flat top cut (Âπ≥È†≠Ë£ù) * Shaved head (ÂâÉÈ†≠) * Pompadour cut (ËõãÊíªÈ†≠) * Omega (Â•ßÁ±≥Âä†È†≠)  Services  Shanghai-style barber shops are different from modern salons. They give newspaper instead of magazine, and also hot tea, towel and cigarettes which modern salon will not provide. However, cigarettes are not allowed nowadays due to the Hong Kong law. Male and female services are separated, there are gentlemen‚Äôs department and ladies‚Äô department. Men usually simply shave their hair, women will ask for hair styling such as curling hair. They provide services based on the ‚ÄúCustomer First‚Äù concept. Other than cutting hair, they also provide other services such as clipping nails, shining shoes, cleaning ears, combing and trimming eyebrows, massaging neck and shoulders. Shanghai-style barber shops keep everything same for over 50 years, they remain the same decoration, same hair cutting skill and same hairstyle. Most of the Shanghai barber insist on using hand instead of electronic machines because they believe that handmade is better. \\"We do not use electric clippers for trimming or shaving. We use a pair of manual hair clippers, which we call 'the frog.' These are no longer in production though.\\"Gao Detian, a Shanghai barber said.

It would have around 300 parking spaces serving Leeds Bradford Airport along with adjoining areas including Cookridge, Bramhope and Yeadon and would be situated on the existing Leeds-Harrogate-York route north of the existing station. The proposal uses both the existing dedicated airport car park bus services (extended to link the station and the airport terminal at very frequent intervals) and the existing main line railway infrastructure with the new station thus enabling frequent direct access to Leeds, Harrogate, Knaresborough and York along with many other rail journeys using interchange at or stations. The scheme is intended to optimise the use and future development of existing infrastructure and services and is thus efficient of taxpayer funds. The distance of between the new station and the airport terminal is not uncommon for airport-main line rail connections around the world. Earlier plans, now discounted on grounds of technical feasibility, capital and operating costs, have previously been suggested by various organisations including the Campaign for Better Transport as an alternative to a major new road scheme in the area. Studies have found that a heavy rail service from the Leeds to Harrogate line would face gradients that \\"exceed the typical maximum gradient that heavy rail can operate over a sustained distance. Even though the gradients involved appeared to be too steep for conventional trains, it was included in a strategic development plan published by the airport for public consultation, where a service by tram- trains had been suggested.

Life Kenneth B. Raper was born in 1908 as the seventh of eight children to William F. Raper and his wife Julia. The children all worked on the family farm in Welcome, Davidson County, North Carolina, and were well educated. His younger brother John, nicknamed \\"Red\\", also became a mycologist. Kenneth was advanced from the sixth grade to the eighth, and enrolled at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1925. There, he impressed his tutors so much that he was awarded a $260 annual assistantship, which enabled him to complete his A.B. degree, which he did in 1929. Raper then went to Washington, D.C. to work in the new Division of Soil Microbiology at the Department of Agriculture, alongside Charles Thom. While there, he met and married Louise Montgomery Williams. He also enrolled at George Washington University following Thom's suggestion, and was awarded a master's degree in 1931. Thom also suggested Raper complete his studies at Harvard University, promising that his position would still be available when he finished. Working under William H. Weston at Harvard, Raper studied an organism he had collected in the Great Craggy Mountains of North Carolina during the summer vacation, and which he formally described as Dictyostelium discoideum in 1935. He was awarded a second master's degree in 1931, and a Ph.D. in 1936. After Harvard, Raper re-joined the USDA, at a new laboratory set up in Peoria, Illinois, working on ways of improving yields of dairy derivatives. The English mycologists Howard Florey and Norman Heatley had been isolating penicillin at the University of Oxford, but were looked for ways to improve the quantities produced. The National Academy of Sciences directed them towards Raper's laboratory. Through collaborations with other groups across the United States, more efficient strains were identified ‚Äì the best coming from a moldy cantaloupe brought in by a Peoria housewife in 1943 ‚Äì and enough penicillin was produced to be made available to the Allied troops in time for the D-Day landings. After the war, Raper stayed at Peoria, which he combined with teaching at the University of Illinois at Urbana‚ÄìChampaign, but in 1953, he and his family moved to Madison, Wisconsin, where Raper had accepted a position at the University of Wisconsin‚ÄìMadison. He remained at Madison even beyond his retirement 1979, as professor emeritus. Work Raper is best remembered for his works on three groups of organisms. He produced a Manual of the Aspergilli in 1945 with Charles Thom, incorporating their various earlier works on the genus Aspergillus. He was instrumental in the study of many strains of Penicillium, and their use in the production of penicillin. He also described the slime mold Dictyostelium discoideum, laying out the various features that made it a good study organism; it has gone on to become one of the most studied model species.

In 1984 she was the first Spaniard to participate in an international expedition to Antarctica. She received her bachelor's degree in 1957 and a PhD in biological sciences at the University of Barcelona in 1969. In 1960 she started working for the Institute of Marine Sciences. In addition, she conducted research at the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC) and was a delegate in Catalonia for two years (1984-1986). Starting in 1984, she participated in the Organization of Research in Antarctica and assisted with the installation of the Juan Carlos I Antarctic Base on Livingston Island, of which she was the lead oceanographer from 1989 to 1997, replacing . From 1989 to 1995 she directed Madrid's National Program of Antarctic Research, and later, from 1994 to 1995, she directed the Institute of Marine Sciences. She has been awarded, among other prizes like the Gold Medal of the Generalitat of Catalonia in 1994, the Creu de Sant Jordi Award in 2003, the IEC Environment Prize in 2006 and the CONCA National Award in 2013.  Biography  Josefina Castellv√≠ was born the daughter of a doctor and housewife in Barcelona during the last few months of the Spanish Republic before the explosive outbreak of the Spanish Civil War (1936-1939). She studied at the Montserrat Institute and in 1957 graduated with a degree in biology from the University of Barcelona. In 1960 she specialized in oceanography from the Sorbonne. In 1969, Josefina got a doctorate in science from the University of Barcelona. Josefina and her older sister attended school at an exceptionally young age near Eixample, where their family began. Later, they were transferred to a convent school, where they studied until their second year of high school. Ultimately, they completed their basic studies at the Institute Monsterrat, in the neighborhood of Sant Gervasi, where Josefina prepared to enter university. In spite of living in a postwar period and the immense poverty the country suffered, Josefina's childhood and adolescence were normal; she lived alternately in Barcelona and Castelldefels, where her parents had a house. In 1953, around the age of 18, Josefina began studying biology at the University of Barcelona. She completed two tracks in one and graduated in 1957, when she was 22 years old. Only two people finished the degree that year: Josefina and a nun. She continued her studies in order to engage more deeply with her research. After finishing her degree Josefina Castellv√≠ traveled to France to study for two years. By 1960, when she specialized and received her PhD in oceanography at the age of 25, she participated in her first oceanographic expeditions on French ships and taught at the Sorbonne. Also starting that year, she began work at the Institute of Marine Sciences as Council Superior of Scientific Research, where she would later assume the role of director from 1994 to 1995 whilst also being a delegate to Catalonia. In 1984 she was the first Spanish woman to participate in an international expedition in Antarctica; it ought to be noted that she contributed mainly to those expeditions‚Äô research, for which she was awarded recognition alongside Antonio Ballester and Nolla. Ballester was recognized as well for his intervention in the installation of the Juan Carlos I Antarctic Base on Island Livingston, of which Josefina was chief director from 1989 to 1993, allowing Spain for the first time to become a member of the Antarctic Treaty System (1988). When she returned to Barcelona, Josefina continued her research at the Spanish National Research Council (CSIC). First, by experimenting in the laboratory, since at that time Spain lacked oceanographic vessels and bathyscaphes with which to feasibly and directly explore the seas. When, in 1971, scientists provided the first Spanish oceanographic vessel for use in investigations Josefina Castellv√≠ was able to do her work from within the environment of her scientific subjects and could analyze how those subjects behaved in the midst of the sea currents. In 1987 Antonio Ballester, Josefina Castellv√≠, and seven others put the first Spanish base in Antarctica, which they created on Island Livingstone and baptized with the name of Juan Carlos I. Josefina Castellv√≠ was 52 years old by then, yet even at that age, in 1997, she directed an Antarctic base where 12 people lived for four months a year. The research in Antarctica was both a great learning experience and emotionally validating for her. Antarctica is a natural laboratory; deep in the ice there is written billions of years of Earth's history and knowing how to analyze these ancient writings allows us to share that vast history. In 1995, after living a few years in Madrid, where she had commissioned the National Research Program Antarctica, Josefina Castellv√≠ returned to Barcelona to lead the Institute of Marine Sciences of the CSIC. Throughout her working life, she combined her research with conference work in order to disseminate her findings and her books, one of which was a book published in 1996 titled I Have lived in Antarctica. In 1994 she received the Gold Medal of Generalitat of Catalonia and in 2003 she received the Creu de Sant Jordi. The Gold Medal is an honorary distinction awarded annually by the Generalitat of Catalonia to those persons or social entities who \\"on their merits, have provided outstanding services to Catalonia in the defense of her identity, especially at the civic and cultural level\\". Moreover, it is considered, together with the International Prize of Catalonia, to be one of the most prestigious distinctions granted in Catalonia. Since 2010, she has been the president of the Summer University of Andorra. On 8 October 2013 she won the Culture of the Generalitat of Catalonia Award, which distinguishes those people, entities, or institutions in any field that are worthy of institutional recognition for his or her contribution to Catalan culture, with preference for excellence, innovation, trajectory and projection, and bearing in mind their contribution during the year before of the concession. In addition, on 13 May 2013 she received the Catalan of the year Award. In 2014 she was appointed vice-president of the Advisory Council for the Sustainable Development of Catalonia (CADS). On 5 March 2015 she received the August Pi i Sunyer Medal from the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Barcelona, in commemoration of International Women's Day. Researcher Josefina Castellv√≠ is the first woman to receive this medal. In spite of her retirement in 2000 Josefina Castellv√≠ remains active; to this day she continues to collaborate with the Advisory Council for the Sustainable Development of the Presidential Department of the Generalitat of Catalonia. She also continues to give lectures on her work in Antarctica, during which she testifies to the importance of this frozen desert. As the coldest place on Earth, she says, it is ideal for studying the capacity to adapt inherent in all organisms, which must change to survive, since, if they do not, they will disappear like the trees and plants that have disappeared from Antarctica. Josefina Castellv√≠ is the first Catalan and Spanish female oceanographer and has received many awards in recognition of her research. \\"The difficult part is to receive first prize\\", here she quoted the scientist Ramon Margalef, \\"because others come such as mimetic actions.‚Äù Of all the awards that she has, Josefina especially values two: the Gold Medal of the Generalitat of Catalonia (1994) and the Creu de Sant Jordi (2003), because they represent the homage of her city and country. Currently, Josefina Castellv√≠ still lives on the same floor where she was born, a testament to her devotion to origins.Josefina Castellv√≠ in 2003 receiving the decoration Cross of Saint Jordi.  Works  Josefina Castellv√≠ has written many books, more than 70 scientific articles in national and international magazines, and has chaired various international committees and commissions related to the oceans and Antarctica. Among her books are the following: * 1967: Ecolog√≠a marina * 1996: Yo he vivido en la Ant√°rtida: Autobiographical work narrating her experience in Antarctica. In the book she explains how she directed the Spanish Antarctic base Juan Carlos I for four seasons, being the first Spanish woman to investigate the continent. The book has many anecdotes, notably the first few are mainly concerned with Antoni Ballester, the pioneer of Spanish presence in Antarctica in the 60's trying to carry out research projects on the continent. * 2005: El Paper que juguen els oceans en l'equilibri del planeta Terra : The work was published in Catalan and includes talks about the impact of climate change and how environmental conditions of the planet have changed through the years.

In the film Castellv√≠ documents her farewell journey from the white continent. The documentary was made as a tribute for all the work done by her and the three other scientists who got Spain to build the first base to investigate this remote area of the planet. The film chronicles this return to Antarctica. Albert Sol√© said: \\"The truth is that I come from a family of very powerful women, a true matriarchy. That is why, when I met Josefina Castellv√≠ - It sounds like almost everyone - I immediately recognized a familiar landscape, with strong women and great fighters, who knew how to cope with many passions against many obstacles that life mounted against them in a very difficult time and world. I realized that in this story there was an alchemy of irresistible elements for me: woman, science, adventure and Antarctica.\\" Synopsis: In 1986, four Catalan scientists Agust√≠ Juli√†, Joan Rovira, Josefina Castellv√≠ and Antoni Ballester managed to reach Antarctica with the project of planting their tent on Deception Island to force the Spanish state to join the Antarctic Treaty, which would eventually happen in 1988, and lay a foundation. The leader of the expedition, Dr. Antoni Ballester, would end up suffering a stroke that led Josefina Castellv√≠ to take over and run the small facility at a time when resources were quite limited for the Antarctic program. That was how she became the first female head of a foundation in the history of international Antarctic research. After retiring, she devotes her time to lace bobbin and gardening, her two passions today, but the photos hanging on the wall of her house and her collection of miniature penguins ensure the memory of her greatest adventure. In addition, she finds the suitcase with 30 hours‚Äô worth of film she had captured herself during her first years on the white continent. Because of this and the pressure of nostalgia, Josefina decided to return to Antarctica. The documentary was first broadcast on the second channel of Televisi√≥n Espa√±ola on Friday 30 May 2014.  Recognitions = August Pi i Sunyer Medal  The August Pi i Sunyer Medal was instituted by the Faculty of Medicine of the University of Barcelona in March 1983, in memory of one of its most outstanding professors and researchers. The award honors a local-level scientific personality who has recently achieved something of great merit and is delivered in the course of the August Pi i Sunyer Lesson, the moment when the award is given. The first person to receive the medal was the ecologist Ramon Margalef, followed by the ophthalmologist Joaqu√≠n Barraquer, the cardiologist Valent√≠n Fuster and the primatologist Jordi Sabater Pi among others. The last person who received the award was the hepatologist and professor of UB Joan Rod√©s in 2010. The researcher Josefina Castellv√≠ is the first woman to receive this award. Josefina Castellv√≠ i Piulachs (Barcelona, 1935) is one of the greatest internationally renowned Catalan researchers. She was a pioneer in Spanish participation in Antarctic research and led the installation of the Spanish Antarctic Base. Her scientific contribution has been very productive in the field of marine bacteriology. Nowadays, she continues to further dissemination and research, although she is professionally retired. Josefina Castellvi was the Delegate of the CSIC in Catalonia and developed her scientific career in the CSIC too. After graduating in Biological Sciences at the University of Barcelona, in 1960, with an Extraordinary Prize, she entered the Institute of Marine Sciences, previously known as the Institute of Fisheries Research. Some years later, as a research professor specialized in marine bacteriology at the CSIC, she became the director of the Institute. Her passion for the study of bacteria in extreme environments led her to take an interest in Antarctica and, in 1984, she became the first Spanish woman to participate in an international expedition to those icy lands. She has published over seventy scientific papers and participated in 36 oceanographic campaigns. In addition to her scientific talent, Castellv√≠ showed excellent qualities as a research manager, which allowed her to be a CSIC Delegate in Catalonia in 1984 and Director of Coordination of the CSIC in 1986. From 1987 to 1988, she coordinated the installation of the Juan Carlos I Spanish Antarctic Base on Livingston Island and, between 1989 and 1994, she became the Head of the Base. Later, she was manager of the National Antarctic Research Program (CICYT) at the state level, responsible for coordinating international scientific projects developed in that territory.

It had become a widely accepted element in religious practice since Northern Song Dynasty. It now faces a gradual loss of craftsmanship due to related environmental concerns and weakened superstitions.  Origin  Zhizha is generally perceived as a form of offering in festive celebrations and funerals. It is believed to be a substitute for living offerings in a sacrifice. Young women in ancient China were offered as brides every year to a so called ‚ÄúRiver God‚Äù in exchange for less frequent floods. To facilitate the exchange, the women would be sacrificed. This practice was later halted by Ximen Bao of Wei due to ethical concerns. Zhizha is the present form of offerings. It only appeared after the maturation of papermaking skills in the Han dynasty. Its common usage came to reality in Northern Song Dynasty, when burning zh«êm«é (paper dolls in the shape of animals) and zh«êy«íng (paper tomb figures) became popular. Effigies, which were often produced purposefully to resemble humans, took varied forms in different periods of time, from couch grass, terracotta, and eventually paper.  Usage  Zhizha art plays an important role in Chinese culture. Despite being one of the most important kinds of decorations in villages, it also serves as an important medium of communication between humans and gods in different forms. The Zhizha art is mostly for festive or funeral decoration and offerings. During festivals which perform the Taoist ritual, ‚ÄúDajiao‚Äù, Zhizha is used to make symbolic decorations such as lanterns, the models of mythic creatures and Gods in parades. During Ghost Festival and Qingming Festival, apart from joss paper, people burn Zhizha offerings to worship gods and show respect to the ghosts of the deceased. While similarly, Zhizha is essential for a traditional Taoist funeral. Since the Chinese generally believe in an afterlife, anything needed for the deceased to enjoy their afterlives, such as houses, furniture, food, gadgets and even servants will be made into Zhizha models and burned as offerings to them.  Materials and structure  Bamboo and colored paper are used to prepare Zhizha. The manufacturing process of different offerings are similar, but for large and complex Zhizha, the production process is more time-consuming and more complicated. Generally, to create a Zhiza, the first step is to draft the appearance on a graph. Then, the paper is cut and torn into the desired shape. A form for support made by bamboo is needed on which to glue the colored paper. It is possible to alter the shape of Zhizha to the desired form. Therefore, a large variety of Zhizha products such as apartment, mobile phones, laptops, vehicles, etc, can be made.  Zhizha evolution  Comparing Zhizha in the past to modern Zhizha, there are differences in its types and production processes.  Types of product  In the past, the types of Zhizha is simpler, as Zhizha craftsmen made products that fulfilled basic human needs for clothing, food, shelter and transportation. Common types of Zhizha includes mansions, servants, paper money and sedan chair. People believe that burning these kinds of necessities to their ancestors can ensure them a better afterlife. However, there are various types of Zhizha like iPhones, iPads and also branded products like Prada.  Production method  In terms of the production process, most of Zhizha in the past was hand-made, and the production cost was generally high. More recently, Zhizha work has shifted to factories in China for mass production so as to lower the cost. \\"Though most people can buy paper-made offerings in local stores, a quick look at taobao.com, the most popular online shopping mall in China, reveals a wide choice of paper-made items from mini-houses, Mercedes Benz cars, passports and LV suitcases to iPads and iPhones.\\" Zhizha therefore evolves with the era.  Craftsmanship  The craftsmen who produced Zhizha are usually recognised as zhƒÅc«éi ji√†ng (ÊâéÂΩ©Âå† in Chinese). Skills are passed down to the disciples from ‚Äúsifus‚Äù (‚Äúmasters‚Äù). Since Zhizha is Taoism-based, a Taoist priest can be a Zhizha craftsman. They learn the craftsmanship while handling their priestly duties simultaneously. The production of paper crafts is considered as an inferior duty, thus they are often assigned to the young priests. As revealed by Chan and Bok, Zhizha, as a kind of traditional craft, is declining at present. One of the contributing factors is the low entry rate of new craftsmen into the industry. The growing disbelief in the afterlife, and increased awareness of the pollutive nature of burning Zhizha offerings are believed the main reasons behind the decline.

They were particularly prevalent in the United Kingdom following the establishment of the British welfare state. A claimant, in the context of insurance, is a policyholder who files a claim or formal request for payment from their insurer to cover a specific loss. https://www.insuranceopedia.com/definition/280/claimant Claimants Unions by jurisdiction=United KingdomOrigins= Cross party support led to the introduction of a Welfare State in the UK by the late 1940s. Whilst this led to a somewhat self-congratulatory viewpoint that poverty had been largely eliminated, this perspective was increasingly being criticised by the 1950s. The research of Brian Abel-Smith and Peter Townsend, The Poor and the Poorest, published in 1965, argued that poverty had increased from 1953 to 1960 and that a significant factor in this was a gap between formal entitlement to benefits and the amount people actually claimed. Abel-Smith and Townsend founded the Child Poverty Action Group (CPAG). However Abel-Smith was to work closely with the Wilson administration, while Townsend was to play a critical and oppositional role with the second director of the CPAG, Frank Field, particularly in the run up to the 1966 general election. This perspective particularly affected the growing radical students movement, who were to provide an important impetus to the emergence of the Claimants Unions. Hilary Rose argues that in these circumstances, students who wished to engage with working class activism looked for new emergent forms rather than linking with the Labour Party whose credentials as being a voice for the working class were being increasingly questioned. While this often meant they were drawn to community politics, the perceived failings of the welfare state encouraged such students to get involved with Claimants Union. Thus it was five working class students in Birmingham who founded the first Claimants Union in Sparkhill in January 1969. =Birmingham Claimants Union= Starting from Sparkhill, the Birmingham Claimants Union (BCU) started to develop their own approach to organising around welfare rights: they were more an organisation of the poor rather than an organisation for the poor like CPAG. Likewise an individual advisor-client relationship was rejected in favour of discussing each case in the whole meeting, which provided an important organisational lesson: by working together people could do things for themselves. This approach was also reflected in the article \\"Democracy for the Poorest\\", written for the Institute for Workers' Control in 1969. Despite starting from an original format based on generic trade union structures, the BCU soon developed an approach much more based on participatory democracy. They challenged the way the Supplementary benefit appeal tribunals were run, arguing that with staff appointed from within the Department of Health and Social Security, the very organisation which implemented Supplementary Benefit, the tribunals were hardly independent. =Current Status Participatory Democracy  The intent of this article is to reflect on the notion of empowered participatory governance in order to gain a better understanding of the institutional contexts and parameters that encourage a more participative democracy, and thereby bring to light the political mechanisms that contribute to broadening the decision-making process. The example we consider is the Montreal Participative Budget ( PB). We focus on the impact of decentralization, more specifically on the form this took as the Montreal PB was being elaborated. We examine how much decentralization circumscribes the PB process. The Montreal Participative Budget provides an illustration of the emergence of a participative level in a political context that is, on the whole, hostile to participatory decision making. We suggest that the PB in this context benefits from a new window of opportunity. The chosen example has a dual significance: it underlines the role of temporal contingencies and scales of the process of decentralization in the participative structures at the local level, and it enables us to gain a better grasp of the problem of institutional architectures in implementing participatory democracy by emphasizing the political and social realities underlying new loci for decision making.

Funeral rituals Traditionally, the body will stay in the house for three, five or seven days, depending on the season. One of the relatives would take a coat of the deceased to the roof and call the dead‚Äôs name three times before the coat was taken back as a cover for the corpse to conduct the ritual \\"kobok\\". The family of the dead will prepare three bowls each of rice, vegetables, soups and set out three units of money and three pairs of shoes outside the entrance of the house to the messengers from the other world. The eldest son will go find a tomb in a mountain and his wife will be responsible for the food for funeral, and also the relatives of the family will come to help making arrangements and cook food for the guests. Also, the corpse will be washed in incense water and dressed in grave clothes. Then, after plugging cotton in the ears and nose of the dead and placing coins over the eyes, the mouth will be filled with three spoonfuls of rice. The body will be bound from head to foot with shrouds in seven layers and put in a coffin, which is bound in three places by long strips of cloth, with a mattress under the body, blanket covering the body and the deceased‚Äôs clothes filled in other spaces. During the Imperial period, for a royal funeral, servants needed to make decorative instruments like thick paper, wood, straw mats and cotton fabrics for the funeral ceremony. It is also believed that, as a deceased individual is taken in a coffin from their house to the burial site, that the threshold of the door by which they leave the house represents the boundary between this world and the afterlife. Korea became a colony of Japan in August 1910, and in June 1912 the Japanese Governor-General announced the ‚ÄúOrdinance to control graves, crematories, burials and cremation‚Äù (jap. Bochi kas≈ç mais≈ç oyobi kas≈ç torishimari kisoku), which instituted public cemeteries and cremation. As Biontino notes, \\"These policies aimed at improving health and hygiene, but they were also deemed necessary out of a concern for space: much arable land was occupied with graves,\\" although by doing so, \\"Japanese authorities challenged not only secular problems, but also attacked the spirituality of the Koreans.\\" As Han also notes, \\"public cemeteries were incompatible with the burial practices that permeated Korean society at that time,\\" and in fact \\"this dissonance between the stipulations of the Ordinance and resilient local beliefs triggered the masses‚Äô wish for specially selected graveyards, which facilitated the overall expansion of the Fengshui-related professions.\\" Burial rituals The first step of preparing for burial is bathing the corpse with perfumed water and dressing it in the traditional death dress made of silk or sambe hempen fabric. Then, the corpse is wrapped up in a hemp quilt and bound with ropes seven times. After the corpse is fully dressed, the coffin's lid will be tightly sealed and placed in a dry and secure place within the house. The second step is transporting the coffin to the grave site, which is determined by a geomancer. Those who carry the bier out of the house have to stop before the gate and lower the coffin three times as a form of ritual bowing. The procession is led by someone who sings the mournful song and the other family members, relatives and friends follow at the back. After that, the burial is started. A shaman will perform a special ritual to exorcise the evil spirits from grave after arriving at the grave site. Then, the coffin is lowered and the eldest male mourner takes a deep bow and stands on top of the coffin, treading down on the earth as it is thrown into the grave, followed by the other family members. Finally, the grave is completed by building a mound of soil and covering it with grass. Mourning rituals Many Korean traditional ceremonies are influenced by Confucian culture. The following methods and requirements of mourning are one such example. First, people should be mourning for three years during which time Jesa ceremonies must be held, because when their parents died it reflects their filial. It is the most important sentiment in Confucian culture. Second, during the funeral, the female family members must be continuing to weep and demonstrate their grief. People believe this performance proves the importance and value of the deceased. However, men are not allowed to cry at the funeral and are required to control their emotions. In traditional Korean culture, the image of a male should be rational and calm, and female is emotional and sensitive. Therefore, the male must restrain his sadness. Third, the relatives and friends will write a funeral oration to mourn the deceased and express their grief. This not only details the life of the deceased, but also praises his merits and achievements. It reflects the culture and history of the whole family of the deceased. Consequently, the oration is very formal. It can be written as a biography, epitaph or a letter to the deceased. Contemporary funerals Today, these funeral traditions are upheld with a modern twist. The two prominent changes concern the venue of the funeral and the method of body disposal. Traditionally, death occurs at home. When people are hospitalized with serious illness, every effort is made to bring them home to die and thus keeping their spirits from wandering and becoming disoriented. Nowadays, most hospitals are equipped for holding funerals, transforming the mortuary into a funeral hall to allow for the following cremation. Funeral shops in hospitals often offer one-stop funeral services to satisfy every need of the client. Since class distinction has declined, Koreans today seldom decide funeral dates based on the deceased‚Äôs social status, and rather tend to hold the funeral on the third day after death. In modern Korean funerals, no eulogies are held. Visitors bow twice to the deceased and once to the mourner with words of condolences to show respect. Various delicacies and wine are served to the visitors. Instead of burial, cremation, which has a shorter period of bodily decay, is more commonly practiced nowadays.

Biography Marinus de Jong was born in Oosterhout (The Netherlands) to a working-class family with twelve children. His musical talent became apparent early in his life: he was accepted into the Royal Conservatoire of Antwerp (Belgium) at the age of fifteen, where he was taught by Lodewijk Mortelmans and Emile Bosquet. At the start of World War One De Jong returned to his native town to recover from a burn-out, but he returned to Belgium after the Armistice of 11 November 1918. He gained fame as a pianist and toured throughout Europe and the United States between 1920 and 1922. Afterwards he married Johanna Corthals, with whom he settled in Kapellenbos, and in 1926 De Jong traded in his Dutch nationality for a Belgian one. In this same year, he was made a teacher of counterpoint and fugue at the Lemmensinstituut, where he would work until 1963. In 1931 he was also appointed professor of piano at the Conservatory of Antwerp, where he became professor of counterpoint and fugue in 1948. In these teaching positions, he wrote two treaties on harmony and counterpoint, of which the latter remained unpublished. He died on 14 January 1991 in Ekeren.Jan Dewilde, de Jong, Marinus on Studiecentrum voor Vlaamse Muziek Music Marinus de Jong is mostly remembered as a composer. He remained a very active author of music up until a high age. Therefore, his oeuvre contains more than 190 opus numbers. His music gives a prominent place to Gregorian chants, which are harmonised with a 20th-century chordal repertory. His music uses conventional forms and is characterised by a lyrical feeling and a sense of mystical reflection. His later works reveal a neo-impressionist style with polytonal counterpoint as a main technique.Corneel Mertens and Diana von Volborth-Danys, De Jong, Marinus on Grove Music Online The oratorio Hiawatha‚Äôs Lied, opus 37 (1933-1947) is often cited as his magnum opus.

It was built from 1935 to 1968. It is also known as Clump Point Private Cemetery, Garners Beach Cemetery, and Wilford Hill. It was added to the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 April 1999.  History  Garners Beach Burial Ground is associated with the settlement of the Muff Creek area, just north of Clump Point and Bingil Bay, by the Garner family, who held the land around Muff Creek from 1911 to the early 1970s. The first of the Garner family to be associated with the beach were Edward Thomas Garner, his wife Edith Fay Johnson, and their 3 children. Edward and Edith and their first child, Edward Henry, emigrated to New South Wales . ET Garner was a seaman, and had spent most of his life working on boats, or building them. It is thought that he came to Queensland in 1889 from Sydney, when he brought up to Townsville for the Hayles brothers, the boat with which they commenced their ferry service to Magnetic Island. Garner stayed in North Queensland and took up timber-getting. This occupation brought him to the Clump Point district, where he cut logs from the hills behind Mission Beach. By the Garner family had settled in Cardwell, and in the early 1900s were engaged in ferrying stores, plants and equipment for the Chinese who were establishing banana plantations along the Hull River, and lightering plantation produce to the coastal steamers offshore, for transport to southern markets. In 1905 they took up a selection on the Murray River and established a sawmill there, producing packing cases for the banana trade. In 1909 they moved to Bingil Bay, where ET Garner, his son EH Garner, his nephew Arthur Garner of Mundoo, and his son-in-law Adolph (Lou) Wildsoet, erected and managed a sawmill for the Cutten family on their Bicton Plantation near Clump Point. The sawmill did not prove profitable for the Cuttens. They soon sold it, and the Garner family looked around for a selection of their own in the district. Late in 1910, ET Garner made application to select portion 10v, parish of Hull, a block of just under along Muff Creek, with a coastal frontage (now known as Garners Beach), extending from a promontory on the coast just north of Middle Beach, northwest to Cedar Creek. Much of this block was covered by dense tropical jungle or bloodwood, tea tree and mahogany forest. It had been surveyed and thrown open to selection in 1905, when the Maria Creeks district was opened up for the banana trade. Selected by F Dillon in 1905, it was forfeited by 1906, and offered for selection again in 1910 as an Agricultural Farm. In December 1910, ET Garner was granted a 20-year lease on the block from 1 January 1911, and was issued with a license to occupy it as an Agricultural Farm (AF 755). On the Muff Creek selection, the ET Garners were joined by the families of their son Edward Henry and daughter Elizabeth Ann Wildsoet, and by Arthur Garner. The Garner-Wildsoet families cleared the land and grew bananas for export by sea. Several shipping companies - Adelaide Steamship, Howard Smith and AUSN lines - regularly picked up plantation produce off the various beaches or stream- mouths. The Garners built several boats on their Muff Creek selection - some as long as long, with steam or oil engines - and were heavily involved with lightering activity on Muff, Maria and Liverpool Creeks. They transported intending settlers, goods and supplies upstream, and farm produce downstream and out to the shipping company boats offshore. The family also attended to some of the navigation lights in the area. When sugar farms were established in the hinterland in the early 1910s, the Garners commenced lime production, blasting coral from King Reefs with gelignite. This was burnt at Garners Beach, and transported by boat to South Johnstone, for sale to sugar cane farmers. By late 1915, over of the Garner selection had been felled and was under cultivation: under bananas, under citrus fruits, and under pineapples; with a further felled, burnt and partly cleared. Much of the unskilled work was done by local Aborigines, who were paid in food and tools, apparently to everyone's mutual satisfaction. Four 4-roomed houses of silky oak with galvanised iron roofs (prefabricated buildings shipped from Townsville) had been constructed, and improvements included outbuildings and a lime kiln. The property was known as Wilford Hill - presumably named after Wilford Hill, Nottingham, England where Edward Thomas and Edith Fay were married in 1886. During the First World War (1914-1918), only ET Garner, his wife and youngest daughter (Nellie) remained at the beach. Arthur Garner joined the Australian Imperial Force and served at Gallipoli, and EH Garner and his family left the beach to take up timber-hauling work near Silkwood. The principal shipping companies, with many of their vessels commandeered for war purposes, curtailed their coastal trade, and Clump Point settlers like the Garners lost access to southern markets. However, until the completion of the North Coast railway line from Brisbane to Cairns in 1924, ET Garner still found work for his boats, which his daughter helped him to run. For a while the coastal steamers continued to call at the wharf in Maria Creek established by the Adelaide Steamship Company , and the Garner boats ferried the cargoes of most of the Clump Point growers from their beaches to the wharf. The loss of markets was compounded by a severe cyclone in 1918, which devastated the district, destroying houses, plantations, boats and a newly completed government wharf near Clump Point. The ET Garner's house, built halfway up Wilford Hill, was swept away. By the early 1920s, ET Garner had acquired adjoining selection no.1174, and was resident there from at least 1921 to 1924. By late 1925, the Garners had returned to portion 10v, where they had about 800 citrus trees and under bananas. There was a 5-roomed house on the property, 5 small accommodation huts, and a cow bail and yards. It is understood that the galvanised iron huts were erected in the 1920s as fishing/holiday accommodation for use by the Garner family, their visitors and paying holiday- makers, but served a more charitable purpose during the 1930s. JG Tierney, who married into the Garner family, later recalled: > Many years later as I moved to different areas in the North with my wife and > family I would work with men who, when told that my wife was a Garner from > Garners Beach, would tell me of the fond memories of good times they had > spent at Garners Beach and I started to realise that there was a story to > the family that I didn't know and was never mentioned by them. As I > understand it, during the 1930s depression some people who came on hard > times were welcome to stay at the beach and as the area was nearly self- > supporting nobody went hungry and after a period of time as they sorted > themselves out would move on and continue with their lives. In 1931, ET Garner applied for an extension of his lease on Agricultural Farm no.755 (portion 10v). This was approved and extended to 30 years from 1 January 1911. A January 1931 inspection of the property concluded that it was a very well improved farm, recently extra good improvements effected for dairying. By mid-1935, the property was being managed by Lou Wildsoet and his sons. On 24 August 1935, Edith Garner, aged 67 years, died at Wilford Hill. She was buried the following day near her home, in what is now known as Garners Beach Burial Ground, the first interment there. ET Garner retired to Tully, and in 1937 his lease on AF755 was transferred to his son, who in 1941 obtained title to the land as freehold. The second interment at Garner's Beach was that of Catherine Mary Garner (n√©e Wildsoet), wife of EH Garner, who died on 1 January 1937 at Tully District Hospital following a car accident, and was buried at Wilford Hill the next day. A late 1930s photograph indicates that a barbed wire fence once delineated the boundary of the burial ground. By October 1939, EH Garner was making little use of Wilford Hill other than to run a few dairy cattle, devoting most of his time to operating a hire boat, taking fishing parties to the Great Barrier Reef. He was also rafting logs to Dunk Island for trans-shipping. During the Second World War (1939‚Äì45) several of EH Garner's children served with the armed forces. After the war his sons returned to Garner's Beach, built a boat they called the Day Spring, and into the 1950s continued taking boating parties around the Reef. ET Garner died at Tully District Hospital on 4 July 1945, aged 86 years, and was buried the next day at the Clump Point Private Cemetery. This was the third burial at Garners Beach. From 1951, the Garner family began to subdivide portion 10v, and in the late 1950s/early 1960s several holiday homes were constructed near Garner's Beach, including the retreat of Australian Treasurer and later Prime Minister, Harold Holt. The Holt residence was located near the Garner graves. In the 1960s two more members of the Garner family were laid to rest at Garner's Beach: Edward Henry Garner, who died at the Innisfail District Hospital on 27 March 1965, aged almost 77 years; and Edward Christian Garner, son of Edward Henry Garner and Catherine Mary Wildsoet, who died at the Innisfail District Hospital on 18 August 1968, aged 59 years. Following EH Garner's death, title to nearly at Garners Beach, which included the burial ground, was transferred in 1965 to his son and daughter-in-law, Stanley Douglas Garner and Elsie Norma Garner. They in turn sold the property, including the burial ground, to the Kenny family in 1972.  Description  Garners Beach, lying southeast- northwest, is situated in a large bay between Ninney and Murdering Points, a couple of kilometres north of Bingil Bay. Middle Beach separates Garner's Beach from Bingil Bay. The southeastern end of Garner's Beach forms a small bay, where the Garner family established their settlement. The beach is about a kilometre in length with a rocky outcrop at the northwest end. Past these rocks is another small beach (Carstairs), also terminated by a rocky outcrop, and north of this is Figtree Beach, bounded by Muff Creek to the south and Maria Creek to the north. Kurrimine Beach lies on the north side of Maria Creek. The burial ground is located on private property about halfway up a promontory (Wilford Hill) at the southeastern end of Garner's Beach, and is accessed from Garner's Beach Road. The site is approximately from the flat where most of the early 20th century settlement occurred, and occupies a small area , defined by, and partly including, vehicular tracks in use on the property. The burial ground contains the graves of five members of the Garner family: Edith Fay Garner (buried 25 August 1935), Catherine Mary Garner (buried 2 January 1937), Thomas Edward Garner (buried 5 July 1945), Edward Henry Garner (buried 29 March 1965), and Edward Christian Garner (buried 20 August 1968). The graves are located in close proximity to each other, and face west. Four of the graves share a common concrete grave kerbing, high by wide, which has remnant evidence of a simple worked metal surround. The grave of Edward Christian Garner lies immediately east of the other graves, and has a separate concrete surround with concrete corner posts with chain metal strung between them. Each of the graves has a concrete headstone, with a marble plaque attached. The headstones of the three men buried here each displays a sequence of three symbols, in bas-relief and painted black, at the top of the headstone: a ship's wheel, a Christian cross, and a ship's anchor.  Heritage listing  Garners Beach Burial Ground was listed on the Queensland Heritage Register on 23 April 1999 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the evolution or pattern of Queensland's history. Garner's Beach Burial Ground has a close association with the work of the Garner family - farmers, boat builders and boat operators - in developing the Clump Point district as a fruit-producing region in the early 20th century. The place has a special association with the life or work of a particular person, group or organisation of importance in Queensland's history. The family was well-known and highly regarded in the local community, and in their boat building and boat operating activities in particular, made a significant contribution to the development of the area.

History  In order to cover losses incurred during World War II, Deutsche Reichsbahn had some additional Kleinlokomotiven built in the early 1950s. However, a more powerful light shunting locomotive with an engine power of 150 ... 180 PS (110 ... 132 kW) was required to replace the aging Kleinlokomotiven and the steam locomotives used for similar duties. In 1956, LKM Babelsberg presented the new type V 10 B with mechanical gear and a engine with wheels of diameter, based upon the concept of the K√∂, but with a higher and closed cab for use on industrial railways and sidings. As this class did not quite satisfy the demands of DR, class V 15 was developed from it. This new class was equipped with hydraulic gears of type GSR 12/3,7 (single torque converter) and originally with engines of type 6 KVD 18 SRW. The design model V 15 101 still resembled a K√∂ II and was not taken into service by DR. Instead, it was sold to Institut f√ºr Schienenfahrzeuge Berlin-Adlershof. In 1959/1960 a pilot series of five locomotives and a first production run of 15 locomotives were built with engines and numbered as sub-class V 15.10. Beginning in 1960, further locomotives were built with engines as sub-class V15.20-21. This more powerful version of V 15 with was also supplied as V 18 B to industrial railways. From V 15 1026 on, the wheel diameter was increased to . Several batches of this type were built until 1966. V 22 B with multiple unit controls A second, more powerful series was developed in 1966 with newly developed engines of type 6 VD 18/15-1 SRW 1 (Manufacturer: Motorenwerk Ro√ülau; 6 cylinders, , 1510 min‚àí1, 150 mm bore, 180 mm stroke) and a more robust power transmission of type GSU 20/4,5 with two torque converters. Starting in 1967, these locomotives were sold as V 22 B to industrial railways, and from 1968 to 1970 DR took 80 locomotives into service DR as V 23. When the newly developed DR class 102.1 was introduced in 1970, DR stopped purchasing locomotives of this class. Industrial railways continued to procure V 22 B locomotives until 1976. From 1974 on, some were equipped with multiple-unit train controls and automatic engine control so that one driver could operate two coupled locomotives. V 15 locomotives with worn-out engines were gradually, and from 1975 on systematically, refitted with engines and the improved GSU 20/4,2 gears, also with two torque converters, and were re-numbered into class V 23.0 or 101.5-7 in the order of their conversion. Some engines have been equipped with vigilance devices and shunting radios.  Technical details  The frames of the locomotives are welded from thick steel plates with a cover plate that was cut out for engine and gearbox. The ends of the frame are strengthened to carry standard buffers and chain link couplers. The frame rests on adjustable leaf springs, the axles have slide bearings. Engine, radiator, fuel tank, sandboxes and silencer are mounted under the hood, air tanks beneath the running boards. The batteries are mounted behind the front steps. Starting with class 102.0 the locomotives were also fitted with an oil-fired engine pre-heater under the cab. The engine (with electric starter) is connected to the hydraulic transmission by a torsionally flexible clutch and a short articulated drive shaft. The reversing gear is directly connected to the hydraulic transmission and drives the jack shaft. The torque is transmitted by side rods to the wheels. A belt drive from the engine drives the radiator fan, the air compressor and the alternator. The pneumatic brake of type Knorr acts on both wheelsets, the hand brake also uses the linkage of the pneumatic brake.  Use and withdrawal  V 22 B of Eisenbahn-Gesellschaft Potsdam in revenue service in Wittenberge (2009) The locomotives of these classes were used all over the GDR, mainly for their intended purpose of light shunting duties in smaller stations and on industrial tracks, but also for work trains and in some cases for light freight and passenger trains, in particular on the short-distance Blankenfelde‚ÄìMahlow shuttle (later replaced by a railbus) and on the tourist trains between Dessau and W√∂rlitz. Maintenance was performed locally or in RAW Halle (Saale), industrial locomotives were mainly maintained in Tharandt. Starting in 1992 and continued by DB AG, classes 311 and 312 were withdrawn from service, scrapped or sold. Some engines have been retained for works duties, others were preserved on industrial railways, in railway museums and by museum railways.

Originally a container terminal, the cargo dock has become a popular attraction and location for photographers. The Instagram Pier is well-known by the public because of its clear view of Victoria Harbour, a major tourist attraction in Hong Kong. From the Instagram Pier, views like that of the Hong Kong skyline, sunsets, old lamp posts, caution barriers, cargo pallets, etc. can be captured. The public cargo working area gained its nickname due to the huge amount of Instagram posts taken in this working area, giving it its informal nickname of the \\"Instagram Pier\\". It has subsequently gained a large amount of media coverage. History The Instagram Pier was originally mainly for freighting, and has been known as the Western District Public Cargo Working Area. It is one of the six public cargo working areas managed by Hong Kong's Marine Department. With the replacement of small and medium-sized freight companies by large transportation corporations, the usage of the Western District Public Cargo Working Area has become more infrequent. With the lack of amusement parks in the Western District, people began to occupy the area for walking dogs or even fishing. Starting from around 2010, it has been known for its scenery for watching the sunset which makes it a good place for photos. The area has become a popular place for witnessing sunsets and shooting photos. The picturesque surrounding area seen from the pier has taken on the nickname ‚Äì \\"Mirror of the Sky\\", since many photographs are taken of the reflective shoreline there. The name refers to the natural phenomenon of reflections seen on the unusually thick layer of water remaining on the ground after rainfall. The water clearly reflects the sky, and shadows of people and objects standing on the horizon. Sunsets often add a stunning effect to this phenomenon. Sunset captured in the Instagram Pier In 2013, the Instagram Pier won in the \\"Outstanding Public Space Elections,\\" jointly organised by Designing Hong Kong, Hong Kong Public Space Initiative and other groups. While the Instagram Pier received the highest number of votes in that election, it is technically not a public place. In fact, the Marine Department has posted warning notices at the pier entrance, citing public safety regulations. Only those engaged in loading and unloading operations are officially allowed at the pier. After the introduction of the West Island line in the MTR in the first quarter of 2015, the pier has become more famous. In addition, the exposure on social media has attracted even more visitors, especially those from overseas. The end of the work day at the pier is the perfect timing for sunset. Photographers often line up with their tripods waiting for the sun to fall on the horizon line.

There have been accidents at the pier, making it possible that the site will have to be closed. The Hong Kong government suggested renovating the whole pier for town planning. It planned to build extra railings and construct landmark buildings at the tip of the extended part. In addition, parts of the site might be re-established as a waterfront promenade. The planning generally included railings for the pier, and it would be transferred to the Leisure and Cultural Services Department for administration. In the middle of 2015, a Hong Kong newspaper office exposed the news about this town planning, which received a large amount of negative feedback from residents. Afterward, the District Council denied the possibility of this project. However, the government has not forgotten the project. It has still been persuading the operators to leave their berths in order to build the waterfront promenade. On the other hand, the society has been considering other options for this project. It plans to rebuild the surfaces of Fung Mat Road, Shing Sai Road eastbound, and parts of the Western District Public Cargo Working Area as a waterfront promenade and cycle track; these works would be separated by railings or dividing lines. In 2017, the Government of Hong Kong published their policy address in October, amending plans to portion off 7500 square metres (over 70%) of the \\"Instagram Pier\\" to be converted into a community garden. This sparked widespread criticism, and concern groups protested against this decision.

The creation of the position was part of a devolution deal giving local government additional powers and funding, enacted via the Cities and Local Government Devolution Act 2016. The interim mayor was Tony Lloyd, the Greater Manchester Police and Crime Commissioner. The office of police and crime commissioner was subsumed into the mayor's role. Nominations for candidates wishing to stand in the election closed on 4 April 2017, after which the final list of candidates was published. Electoral system The election used the supplementary vote system, in which voters express a first and a second preference of candidates. * If a candidate receives over 50% of the first preference vote the candidate wins. * If no candidate receives an overall majority, i.e., over 50% of first preference votes, the top two candidates proceed to a second round and all other candidates are eliminated. * The first preference votes for the remaining two candidates stand in the final count. * Voters' ballots whose first and second preference candidates are eliminated are discarded. * Voters whose first preference candidates have been eliminated and whose second preference candidate is in the top two have their second preference votes added to the count. All registered electors (British, Commonwealth and European Union citizens) living in Greater Manchester aged 18 or over on 4 May 2017 were entitled to vote in the mayoral election.

It is an agency of the Ministry of Digital Economy and Society (MDES). It maintains four meteorological centers: one each for the northern region, the northeastern region, and two in the southern region (eastern shore and western shore). History In 1905 the science of meteorology was first introduced to Thailand by the Royal Thai Navy which included meteorology in its navigation course. Seven years later, in 1912, the first meteorological textbook in Thai was published. Thailand‚Äôs first meteorological service, known as the Meteorological and Statistics Section, was established in 1923. It was attached to the Water Management Division of the Royal Irrigation Department under the Ministry of Lands and Agriculture. Observation stations were set up in provinces for the collection of meteorological data and for the construction of weir for flood control. In August 1936 the Meteorological and Statistics Section was transferred to the Hydrographic Department of the Royal Thai Navy, where it was known as the Meteorological Division. The Meteorological Division was elevated to departmental status on 23 June 1942. In 1962, the department was transferred from the Royal Thai Navy to the Office of the Prime Minister.

In 1934, he left Austria for the Empire of Japan where he worked with industrialist Shitagau Noguchi to set up a magnesium plant and further helped the Japanese build a pilot plant to produce heavy water by the Combined Electrolysis Catalytic Exchange (CECE) he invented. Coming to the United States in 1940, he worked with American industrialist Henry J. Kaiser to design a magnesium plant in California, but at the outbreak of World War II, Hansgirg was arrested by the FBI on a Presidential warrant and interned for \\"the duration of the war.\\" After the war, the Soviet Union captured Hansgirg's plants in northern Korea, using the plants' processes and equipment for their atomic bomb project against the United States, likewise, using them in the Manhattan Project, the exact details of which still remain classified in both the United States and Russia.  Early life  Fritz Hansgirg was born in Graz, Austria in 1891 and received his Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in chemistry from the University of Graz. He was married to Josephine Marie (n√©e Heller). Her son from her first marriage, Peter Robert Hofst√§tter, graduated from the University of Vienna, served as a military psychologist in the Nazi Germany army during World War II.  Austria  In 1928, Hansgirg invented, and patented, the carbothermic magnesium reduction process while working in his Radenthein laboratory that was a less costly method of mass-producing magnesium of extremely high purity. After setting up a pilot plant in Radenthein to produce magnesium using his process, his senior partner, Emil Winter of The Pittsburgh Steel Company, urged him to sell the patent rights to the highest bidder, which he did in 1934 then leaving Austria for the Empire of Japan. A pilot plant never worked at full strengthit took a lot of accessories, in addition working with magnesium require sophisticated equipment and increased caution due to pyrophoricity magnesium dust and explosive gas mixtures.  Empire of Japan  In 1934, Hansgirg arrived in the Empire of Japan joining with Japanese industrialist Shitagau Noguchi to set up a magnesium plant at the Chosen Nitrogen Fertilizer Complex in what is known now as the northern Korea city of Hungnam. (Because of the Japan‚ÄìKorea Treaty of 1910, there was no country known at this time as Korea (either north or south) as it had been formally annexed into the empire.) Noguchi (company \\"Nichitsu) and Winter (American Magnesium Metals Corporation) established the subsidiary Japanese magnesium company. Hansgirg took the post of vice-president of both American and Japanese magnesium companies.Black Mountain college.

But Hansgirg (Hansgierg) was not limited to magnesium. On his initiative in 1936 was founded a new firm Nitehiuu Gemstones, he himself owned 15 percent shares of this company. It was due to the fact that the increased demand for Jewel bearing for military purposes. Hansgirg further aided the Empire by developing a cracking plant (used to break down crude oil into its various component parts). Before leaving Austria, he designed two applications for a method of producing heavy water using a water gas shift reaction.US 2134249 A. Production of water enriched with heavy water https://www.google.com/patents/US2134249US 2156851 A. Production of heavy water. https://www.google.com/patents/US2156851 It is believed that he could help the Japanese in the production of heavy water in Konan, which was suspected by the United States of aiding the Japanese nuclear weapon program.  United States  In May 1940, Hansgirg left the Empire of Japan after its pro Axis mood became \\"hostile to foreigners\\" arriving in the United States where he joined with the American industrialist Henry J. Kaiser. Before the war a demand aircraft engineering increased in the light magnesium alloys. Kaiser had paid $750,000 to Winter for the patent in the carbothermic process and received government credits about $22 million to build the defense plant of Permanente Metals Corporation (PMC) in California By the start of World War II, the first unit at Kaiser's plant was producing about of magnesium per day. However, starting Permanete plant in August 1941 was not pat and accompanied by explosions with human victims. As it turned out, in practice, the technology Hansgirg process remained the same imperfect as it was in Radenthein. In this process, there was a need to work with magnesium dust, which ignites in the air with an explosion. PMC engineers built a pilot plant urgently to improve the process. However, the yield of the heavy situation was found not to changes technology, but enlargement the use of dust. The PMC invented a new incendiary mixture of \\"goop\\" ‚Äì paste of magnesium dust and gelled gasoline with additives. Special bomb was developed. Government price controls allowed the leadership of PMC stand the competition \\"goop\\" with napalm and avoid large financial losses. For September 1943 PMC leadership was ready to leave only 10% of the dust to produce magnesium in the form of ingots. For the entire war period PMC has issued 20 million lbs. of magnesium and 86 million lbs. of \\"goop.\\" The proportion of bombs M74 and M76 with \\"goop.\\" constituted about 8% of the total tonnage of incendiaries that were used in the bombing in Japan and Germany. After the war Permanente plan was stopped, and the end of 1945 ahead of schedule Kaiser paid on credits taken. Nine days after December 7, 1941 attack on Pearl Harbor plunged the United States into World War II, Hansgirg was arrested by the FBI on a Presidential Warrant accused of being \\"potentially dangerous to the public peace and safety of the United States\\", with fears that the Kaiser magnesium plant would be shut down because of his arrest proving to be unwarranted. After being arrested, Hansgirg was first held at the jail in Santa Clara County, California, and during the war was held at U.S. alien internment camps in San Antonio, Texas and Stringtown, Oklahoma. During Hansgirg's wartime internment, U.S. Attorney General Francis Biddle denied permission for his wife, Josephine Marie, to visit him, with her then appealing in a woman-to-woman hand-written letter to First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt seeking leniency and explaining that her husband could not criticize Adolf Hitler because their son was still in the German army and would be retaliated against if he did so. Josephine ended this letter by stating:  Black Mountain College  Marie Hansgirg's letter on behalf of her husband was forwarded by First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt to Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) Director J. Edgar Hoover, who in turn consulted with the Director of the Alien Enemy Control Unit resulting in Hansgirg being released under the parole of Theodore Dreier, the treasurer of Black Mountain College, a progressive experimental educational community in North Carolina. Hansgirg was appointed as chemistry professor to replaced Charles Lindsley, who took a position with the US Department of Defense doing research for the War Department in 1942. The decision was taken on the advice of the famous Austrian scientist Karl Terzaghi. Hansgirg's parolee sponsorship was transferred in 1943 to Dr. W. R. Wunsch, another employee at Black Mountain College, and then to Isaac Van Horn in July 1944. At Black Mountain College, Hansgirg combined the teaching of chemistry and physics with research and business activities. In 1943, an extension was added to the school's science building to make room for a photography darkroom and Hansgirg's experiments in extracting magnesium from olivine, a locally abundant mineral. Later in the same year, he developed a modified method of magnesium production involving the use of calcium carbide as a reducing agent. Hansgirg created and applied for patents under the name of the North Carolina Magnesium Development Corporation. He gave 20% of the shares of this business to the college. Although many of his colleagues had fled Europe during the rise of fascism, Hansgirg was the only member of the Black Mountain College community with \\"enemy alien\\" status. He was known for letting the college community use his grand piano, his organ, his photographic equipment and his extensive record collection of operas. He was also one of the few faculty with personal wealth, and he provided champagne and strawberries for special celebrations. In September 1948, the building that housed Hansgirg's equipment and experiments burned down in a fire rumored to have been the result of a fellow faculty member's vodka still.  Death  After Black Mountain College, Hansgirg moved to New York. There he worked as chief engineer for the Electro-Metal Corporation and the Bach Corporation, and provided consulting services to the Standard Oil Company of New Jersey. On July 23, 1949, Hansgirg died unexpectedly at the age of 58. The cause of death is unknown, but suspected to be due his decades ingestion of magnesium, resulting in Hypermagnesemia.  Postwar use of Hansgirg technology  Immediately after the war, the Soviet Union invaded and occupied northern Korea taking possession of Hansgirg's magnesium and heavy water plants located in the city of Hungnam then transferring the technology back to Russia for integration into their own atomic bomb program. The U.S. Manhattan Project also utilized Hansgirg's CECE process for heavy water production during the war and many years thereafter too. Many aspects of the postwar history related to both the U.S. and Soviet (now Russian) use of Hansgirg's processes still remain classified.  See also  *  References  Bibliography  * F.

Written by the band and produced by vocalist and guitarist John D. Cronise, it is featured on the band's 2006 debut studio album Age of Winters. In addition to being released as the only single from the album on September 4, 2007, \\"Freya\\" was featured as a playable track on the video game Guitar Hero II, released in November 2006. Due in part to its inclusion on Guitar Hero II, as well as its release as the lead single from Age of Winters, \\"Freya\\" is often cited as The Sword's signature song. It has been performed at almost every one of the band's shows, and was praised by critics upon its release. The song was later included on the 2009 Guitar Hero expansion Smash Hits, and also on the band's iTunes Festival: London 2010 EP. Origins and recording \\"Freya\\" was originally recorded for The Sword's third demo, released in 2005 and often referred to as \\"The Freya EP\\". The song's lyrics are said to be based on the themes of fantasy and legend, as well as those within Norse mythology. The song is likely to be written about the goddess Freyja from Norse mythology, who is also referenced by the name of the band's studio at which the track was recorded, Folkvang, a reference to the \\"dwelling\\" of the goddess F√≥lkvangr. The Sword guitarist Kyle Shutt has revealed that the band took inspiration from Led Zeppelin for much of the material on Age of Winters, including \\"Freya\\". Speaking about the popularity of the song in a 2012 interview, he claimed that the band had performed it at \\"every single show\\" to date, explaining that they would \\"mix it up every once in a while [and] throw in some different parts\\" when playing it live. According to set list aggregation website setlist.fm, \\"Freya\\" is the most frequently performed song by The Sword. Release and reception Following its release on The Sword's debut album Age of Winters in February 2006, a cover version of \\"Freya\\" was featured as a playable track in stage 5, \\"Return of the Shred\\", of the video game Guitar Hero II, released in November 2006. The version of the song included on the game was recorded by WaveGroup Sound and features an extra part at the end which was not present on The Sword's recording. It was later included on the 2009 expansion Guitar Hero Smash Hits, as one of 19 tracks from Guitar Hero II. Speaking about the band's inclusion on the Guitar Hero games (including later releases Guitar Hero: Metallica and Guitar Hero 5), Kemado Records marketing director and label manager Jeffrey Kaye simply revealed that the team at Activision were fans of heavy metal and The Sword in particular, adding that \\"There was very little pitching necessary for them\\". \\"Freya\\" was later issued as the sole single from Age of Winters on September 4, 2007. Released to coincide with the band's UK tour with Clutch, the 7\\" vinyl single was limited to 1,000 copies and backed with a live version of fellow album track \\"Iron Swan\\" recorded at the CBGB venue in New York City shortly before its closing. The song was later featured as the opening track on the band's iTunes Festival: London 2010 extended play, recorded on July 3, 2010 and released later that month. Reviewing Age of Winters for AllMusic, Eduardo Rivadavia selected \\"Freya\\" as the main highlight of the album. On the contrary, PopMatters writer Adrien Begrand claimed that \\"Freya\\" and following track \\"Winter's Wolves\\" \\"come close to sounding pedestrian\\", criticising the songs' \\"charmingly lunkheaded riffs\\" and Cronise's vocal delivery.

Early life and education Barnes was born in Bolton-le-Sands, Lancashire the son of Joseph Barnes a yeoman farmer. He attended local schools at Kellett and Silverdale, but his teachers noticed his abilities and he won a place at Eton College. His family were not wealthy and it was said that he travelled to Eton seated behind his father on one of the farm's horses. After finishing his schooling he went up to King's College, Cambridge. He graduated in 1764 at the age of twenty. Career Barnes took a Bachelor in Divinity and Doctor of Divinity at Cambridge in preparation for a career in the church. He was ordained in 1769 held various livings in Norwich and Wattisham, Suffolk, and became Vice-Provost of King's. In 1788 Barnes became Vice-Chancellor of Cambridge University as well as Master of Peterhouse, Cambridge. His appointment to the latter post was highly contentious. He was only nominated to prevent the election of another man and had not particularly wanted the position. It was said by a Peterhouse Fellow that he was unsuited to \\"any duty which required the exercise of high notions of morality, and a careful regard to what is just, decent, and venerable\\". He held the Mastership for over 50 years. In 1813 Barnes was elected to the Knightbridge Professorship of Moral Philosophy. As with his appointment to Master of Peterhouse, this election has been the subject of controversy. There were four electors for the vacant Professorship: the Vice-Chancellor, the Regius and the Lady Margaret's Professors of Divinity, and the Master of Peterhouse. The casting vote belonged to the last of these if the vote was split. There is a popular story that Barnes, as well as being Master of Peterhouse, was Vice-Chancellor; that as Vice-Chancellor, he nominated himself for the Professorship; that as Master of Peterhouse he seconded himself; and that, by two original votes and a casting vote, he elected himself to the Professorship. The story is almost certainly apocryphal. Although Barnes had been Vice-Chancellor in 1788 and 1807, he did not hold the post in 1813, the year of his election to the Knightbridge. As was common for incumbents of the chair in the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries, he seems to have given no lectures , and did not publish anything. Barnes had the distinction of being the last wearer of the eighteenth century wig in Cambridge University. He died in 1838 at the age of 95 and is buried in the chapel at Peterhouse.

Biography Born in Neuch√¢tel, Switzerland, on 7 July 1940, Oswald is the daughter of the painter Marcel North (1909‚Äì1990). After graduating from Geneva's √âcole des arts d√©coratifs, in the 1960s she initially worked as a scenographer and costume designer at the theatre La Tarentule in St-Aubin. She then turned to engraving, studying under Stanley William Hayter in Paris. Finally, approaching her 50s, she travelled to Italy where she began to paint and has continued to do so ever since. Commenting on Oswald's work in 1991, Jean-Pierre Golay and Russell Panczenko observe that her large drawings and smaller etchings are not only meticulously presented but exhibit explosive creativity and a powerful sense of meaning. They require the attentive participation of the viewer until the mass of confused strokes emerge into a face or a human figure, culminating in a feeling of positive accomplishment. This also holds for her Au del√† des Masques where apparent landscapes reveal faces and vice versa. In March 2015 in Montalchez, the Cabinet d'expertise Art Anciens held an exhibition of the works of the North family including those of Oswald herself, of her father, Marcel North, his wife, Marie-Claire Bodinier, and Armande's brother, Michel North.

Reticulum II was discovered in 2015 by analysing images from the Dark Energy Survey. It is elongated, having an axis ratio of 0.6. The size is given by a half-light radius of 15 parsecs (pc). This is too large for it to be a globular cluster. Magnitude Mv of the galaxy is -2.7. The distance from Earth is 30 kpc. The galaxy contains some blue horizontal branch stars. Other features visible are a main sequence, and a main sequence turn off, and a red giant branch. It has an unusual enhancement of r-process elements; meaning that gold and europium are extra common in the brightest stars in the galaxy. The implication of the unusual enrichment in elements heavier than zinc, is that the r-process is very rare, and only happened once in this galaxy, possibly by the collision of two neutron stars. Gamma rays mostly with energies between 2 and 10 GeV have been detected by the Fermi satellite. The radiation from Reticulum II is more significant than that of other dwarf galaxy emissions.

Before that, from 1925 to 1933, it was the regional subdivision of the Nazi Party in that area. History The Nazi Gau (plural Gaue) system was originally established in a party conference on 22 May 1926, in order to improve administration of the party structure. From 1933 onward, after the Nazi seizure of power, the Gaue increasingly replaced the German states as administrative subdivisions in Germany. At the head of each Gau stood a Gauleiter, a position which became increasingly more powerful, especially after the outbreak of the Second World War, with little interference from above. Local Gauleiters often held government positions as well as party ones and were in charge of, among other things, propaganda and surveillance and, from September 1944 onward, the Volkssturm and the defense of the Gau. The position of Gauleiter in W√ºrttemberg-Hohenzollern was held by Eugen Munder from its founding to January 1928 and then by Wilhelm Murr from February 1928 to May 1945. Murr and his wife committed suicide after having been captured by the French Army shortly after the end of the war.

Distribution These spiders are mainly present in Ecuador in the Amazon Region. Habitat This species can be found in very different habitats, but frequently it is present in agricultural areas, especially in the field of grazing cattle. Sometimes it can be found in holes of walls of buildings or in the spaces below the roofs. Description Female Avicularia purpurea can reach a length of about , therefore it is among the smaller members of the genus Avicularia. In daylight this spider discloses a quite intense purple-blue iridescence on the dorsal surface of the cephalothorax and on legs, palps and chelicerae. The long setae covering the legs and palps are dark red-brown. The tarsal and metatarsal scopulae are very dark brown. The tarsal tufts are pale cream-pink in colour. The abdomen is velvet-black and covered with stinging hairs.The tarantula's burrow Behavior Avicularia purpurea is primarily an arboreal spider. This climbing species builds its nests primarily in hollows in the trees, sometimes in the vicinity of epiphytic plants. These spiders eat mostly crickets, cockroaches, meal worms, waxworms and darkling beetles, but they also can catch small rodents. During mating the females become very aggressive towards the males. A few months after mating the female lays up to 120 eggs in a cocoon. Six to eight weeks later between 50 and 120 nymphs hatch.TarantulasUS References Category:Endemic fauna of Ecuador Category:Theraphosidae Category:Spiders of South America Category:Spiders described in 1990 ","title":"Avicularia purpurea"},{"id":"49926763","text":"Orlando Greene is an Olympic runner from Barbados who raced in the 1976 summer Olympic games in Montr√©al.

After winning in sprints, he soon found his true expertise in the longer distances of 400 and 800 metres. He attended Seton Hall University, setting school records in the 1600 metres and winning the 1973 NCAA championship in that event. In 1976 he set the Barbadian record for the 800 record in Philadelphia. In that year he also competed in the 400 and 800 metres in Montr√©al. Greene retired from running in 1980 and began coaching track athletes throughout the Caribbean, including coaching the Barbados Olympic team in 1984. He played a significant role in the development of Olympians Andrea Blackett and Obadele Thompson. In the 1980s, Greene emigrated to the United States.

Adams is part of a legendary family of country music singers and musicians. One of ten descendants of Frank Adams who himself, along with his brothers were radio and recording artists in the 1930s and 40s. Don Adams enjoyed moderate success as a solo artist recording on the Atlantic, Musicor, Jack O' Diamonds and Big D labels in the 1960s and 70s. He was most well known however as the lead singer of the Adams Brothers, a much sought after backing band for some of country music's largest stars. The Adams Brothers, Don, Gary and Arnie at various times were the traveling back-up band for artists such as Merle Haggard, Tammy Wynette. Ray Price. Marty Robbins and Johnny Paycheck. They were most well known however as the original backing band for George Jones where they were known as The Jones Boys. At one point, the band was such a fan favorite that Jones label released an album titled simply \\"The Jones Boys\\" without George Jones. While known as stellar musicians, the Adams Brothers also gained notoriety for their hard partying lifestyle, which fit well considering their longest tours were typically with the notoriously hard partying Jones and Paycheck. The Adams Brothers have recently gained a resurgence in popularity with a new generation of music fans. When Hollywood producer Mike Judge (Beavis and Butthead, Silicon Valley) decided to do a mini-series for Cinemax in 2017 (Tales From the Tour Bus) featuring some of country music's most colorful characters, the Adams Brothers were featured in three of the episodes. Although officially long retired from the music industry, Don Adams along with his brothers, is occasionally coaxed out of retirement to do fund raisers and events for local charities. Their rare live shows attract large crowds of classic country music fans, many of whom have been fans for more than a half-century.

The website describes itself as providing an alternative to how Russia is portrayed in the Western media. Other sources have described it as being \\"pro-Russian,\\" \\"pro-Kremlin\\", advocating and pushing antisemitism and creating false or misleading content.  Foundation and funding  Russia Insider was founded in 2014 by Charles Bausman, an expatriate who had lived in Moscow for nearly 30 years and had been dissatisfied with what he perceived as the Western media's coverage of the outbreak of the crisis in Ukraine. Bausman described the website as \\"citizen journalism\\" and stated that it has no relation to and is not funded by the Russian government. Its deputy editor is Riley Waggaman and its director of operations and human resources is David Curry.Russian Insider In late 2015, Anton Shekhovtsov who investigates the far-right in Russia, asserted that Bausman had sought funding from Russian oligarch Konstantin Malofeev, who is reportedly close to the Kremlin, citing emails leaked by Anonymous International in which Alexey Komov acted as an intermediary. In an article for Haaretz in January 2018, Shekhovtsov wrote that the website was \\"originally launched to attack Ukraine after its former president Viktor Yanukovych was ousted and fled to Russia, by accusing the new Ukrainian authorities of fascism and anti-Semitism\\". Writing for ThinkProgress in 2018, Casey Michel similarly asserted that \\"a series of leaked emails showed site founder and editor Charles Bausman requesting funding from Konstantin Malofeev. [...] As Bausman wrote to one of Malofeev's associates, 'I still need money!!'\\" The solicitation to Malofeev was cited as evidence of Russia Insiders connection to the far-right in Russia and Europe. The website itself has said it is dependent on crowdfunding, indicating that from 2014 to January 2018 it had received $300,000. The Daily Beast has said Bausman denies receiving money from Russian oligarchs.  Reception  The website has been criticized for its pro-Russian stance, accused of being among \\"pro-Kremlin propaganda sites\\" by Newsweek, and called \\"pro-Kremlin\\" by BBC News and the Slate website, being further accused of disseminating \\"false or misleading content\\" by the RAND Corporation. It is considered by the Euractiv website to be alongside \\"several highly visible partisan outlets such as RT, Ruptly and Sputnik\\". Bausman has himself been invited to speak on Russian state owned TV Rossiya 1 and Russia Today. Russia Today later issued a statement which said: \\"RT categorically and unequivocally condemns the disgusting hate speech promoted by the recent Russia Insider article, its author, and the platform as a whole, and rejects any association to such\\". Russia Insider has reproduced RT content. When asked by The Daily Beast, Google said \\"when a copyright holder notifies us of a video that infringes their copyright, we remove the content promptly in accordance with the law\\". RT material remained on the Russia Insider website.  Overt antisemitism  On January 15, 2018, Russia Insider published an editorial by Bausman entitled \\"It's Time to Drop the Jew Taboo\\" in which he described the hostility to Putin's Russia as \\"largely a Jewish phenomenon\\", alleged a \\"strict taboo in the media of criticizing Jews as a group, and announced that \\"from now on, the pages of Russia Insider will be open to articles which fairly and honestly address the influence of Jewish elites, including pointing out when it is malevolent, which it often is\\". Haaretz said the manifesto alleged \\"Jewish pressure groups\\" were responsible for \\"most of the deadly turmoil in the world over the last 30 years\\". Vladislav Davidzon, contributing to the American Tablet magazine, described the article as \\"a lengthy anti-Semitic manifesto\\" writing that the article \\"contained a comprehensive litany of the most vile accusations against Jews dating back more than one hundred years\\". Another Tablet writer, Yair Rosenberg, said on Twitter: \\"This pro-Putin site's manifesto is basically a Nazi screed in 2018. It reads exactly the same way: ‚ÄòWe must go after the Jews or we will face societal calamity'.\\" Subsequently, antisemitic articles have appeared regularly. On October 15, 2019, the site's main page pointed to articles with the following titles: \\"On the Necessity of Anti-semitism\\", \\"Holohoax Denial Is Not Illegal in Russia\\", \\"Another Bombshell Book Crushing the Holohoax Lie\\", \\"Nazi Germany Had Unequalled Quality of Life\\", \\"The Russian Church in Exile Strongly (and Rightly) Supported Hitler's Invasion of Russia\\" and \\"Yet Another Jew Gives a Prescription for Getting Rid of White Gentiles\\".

He was director of advocacy for America First Policies, a group that promotes Donald Trump's policy agenda. In August 2017, Higbie was selected to serve as the chief of external affairs for the Corporation for National and Community Service, but resigned in January 2018 after racist, sexist, anti-Muslim, and anti-LGBT comments and comments about fellow veterans with PTSD came to light. Before that he served as a spokesperson for Great America PAC, which supported Trump's presidential candidacy and assisted his transition info office, and he also became known for promoting the false birther conspiracy theory about Barack Obama. He is a former Navy SEAL. He served two tours of duty in Operation Iraqi Freedom, reaching the rate of Special Warfare Operator, First Class. He has written two books about his experiences, and has regularly appeared as a commentator on Fox News and CNN.  Early life  Higbie was born on April 23, 1983, in Greenwich, Connecticut. He attended Greenwich High School before going to college at Sacred Heart University, where he dropped out to join the military as troops were being deployed to Iraq.  Military service  Higbie enlisted in the United States Navy and became a SEAL in 2005, ultimately reaching the rank of Petty Officer First Class (E-6 grade) with a rating of Special Warfare Operator, First Class. He was twice deployed to Iraq to serve in Operation Iraqi Freedom, once each under Presidents Bush and Obama. Higbie is the author a self-published book titled Battle on the Home Front: A Navy SEAL's Mission to Save the American Dream in 2012, after which his security clearance was downgraded from \\"top secret\\". He signed out of the SEALs before the end of his term of duty with an honorable discharge. Some two months later, the Navy downgraded his discharge to \\"general\\". A second book, Enemies, Foreign and Domestic: A SEAL's Story, was published by Post Hill Press in 2016.  Congressional campaign  In 2014, Higbie announced that he was running to be the Republican Party nominee to challenge Democrat Jim Himes in Connecticut's 4th congressional district, declaring himself to not be \\"bound by the same conformist rules that most Republicans are bound by.\\" At the time, Higbie was working as a personal trainer at Equinox in Greenwich, CT. The other Republican candidates were former State Senator Dan Debicella and State Representative John Shaban. Higbie described himself as a social conservative with \\"moral oppositions to abortions and same-sex marriage, but my legislative position is live and let live,\\" and stated that he would vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. On economic issues, Higbie supported \\"a balanced budget amendment and an across- the-board personal income tax rate of 10 percent, with a maximum annual deduction of $50,000,\\" and he favored eliminating corporate taxes to attract overseas businesses. Higbie had difficulty with fund raising during his candidacy, and sought to force a primary election if he were not endorsed as the candidate. Debicella won the nomination with support from 195 of the 210 delegates, and contested the election against Himes, who won with 53.7% of the vote.  Great America PAC  Higbie is a spokesman for Great America PAC, an independent-expenditure only political action committee (Super PAC) which advocates for Donald Trump. In this capacity, he has acted as a Trump surrogate, appearing on news networks including Fox News and CNN. Higbie has discussed a variety of topics including the war in Iraq, the composition of the Trump transition team, the controversy relating to Khizr Khan's appearance at the Democratic National Convention, the proposal for a registry of Muslim immigrants, and the National Policy Institute conference. Higbie has become known for making comments that were perceived as racist and has stated that he \\"just don‚Äôt like Muslim people\\". He has also pushed the false birther conspiracy about Barack Obama.  Iraq  In a CNN interview with retired- Major General Paul Eaton and Chris Cuomo, Higbie was critical of the use of air power and drone strikes by the Obama administration and argued in support of Trump's promise to address problems in Iraq with \\"boots on the ground.\\" He was also critical of Eaton, who was the U.S. Army Chief of Infantry and then the Commanding General of the Coalition Military Assistance Training Team in Iraq (2003-2004), stating that the leadership \\"[Eaton's] articulated here today is not conducive to winning a war.\\"  Trump transition team  During the transition following the 2016 presidential election, Higbie defended Steve Bannon from accusations of anti-Semitism, misogyny, and racism. Of Bannon's appointment as chief strategist to President-elect Trump, Higbie said: \\"Steve Bannon has excelled in every single role he has held dating back to his service in the US Navy. I cannot imagine a better person to be advising an already successful businessman taking on the biggest business in the world, the US Government.\\"  Registry of Muslims  On the same day as defending Bannon, in an interview with Megyn Kelly of Fox News, Higbie cited the internment of Japanese Americans during World War II and the associated Supreme Court decision in Korematsu v. United States as providing legal justification for Trump's campaign promise of a registry for Muslim Americans. Higbie repeated his comments on CNN to Erin Burnett the following day. Kelly replied that Higbie \\"knows better\\" than to make such suggestions as they scare people. Kelly met Higbie's further assertion that he was only noting \\"there was precedent for it\\" with the declaration: \\"You can't be citing Japanese internment camps for anything the President-elect is going to do.\\" Trump's transition team later issued a statement to the Huffington Post that denied that Trump supported a Muslim registry, though he had made comments supporting such an idea in 2015. George Takei, who was detained in one of the World War II internment camps, described Higbie's comments as \\"dangerous\\" and went on to say that \\"[r]egistration of any group of people, and certainly registration of Muslims, is a prelude to internment.\\" Higbie's comments attracted media criticism, and Representative Judy Chu (D-CA), the first Chinese American woman elected to the U.S. Congress, declared that \\"[a]ny proposal to force American Muslims to register with the federal government, and to use Japanese imprisonment during World War II as precedent, is abhorrent and has no place in our society. These ideas are based on tactics of fear, division, and hate that we must condemn.\\" Constitutional lawyer Bruce Fein addressed Higbie's suggestion that Korematsu could be used to support a Muslim registry, describing the case as having \\"joined Dred Scott as an odious and discredited artifact of popular bigotry\\" even though it has never been overturned. Harvard University's Noah Feldman concurred, declaring that \\"Korematsu's uniquely bad legal status means it's not precedent even though it hasn't been overturned.\\"  National Policy Institute conference  At its conference in Washington, D.C., in November 2016, the white supremacist National Policy Institute celebrated Trump's victory as \\"the first step towards identity politics in the United States,\\" and the audience responded to the end of Richard Spencer's speech - \\"Hail Trump! Hail our people! Hail victory!\\" - by standing and making the Nazi salute. Higbie participated in a CNN panel discussion with Angela Rye to discuss the conference, and described the attendees as \\"morons\\" and \\"idiots\\" who do not represent the Republican Party as a whole. The discussion became heated, with Rye calling the Republicans the \\"party of oppression\\" and describing Higbie's knowledge of history as \\"ass backwards\\" after Higbie stated that Martin Luther King Jr. would support the Republicans.

It was built by the British in 1848, as one of three semaphore towers in Malta. The tower was restored in 2009, and it is now in good condition. History The semaphore telegraph system was invented in 1792, and the British military authorities began to consider installing such a system in Malta in the early 1840s. Initially, it was planned that semaphore stations be established on the bell towers and domes of the island's churches, but the religious authorities rejected the proposal. Due to this, in 1848 new semaphore towers were constructed at Gƒßargƒßur and Gƒßaxaq on the main island of Malta, and another was built at Ta' Kenuna in Nadur, Gozo. Further stations were established at the Governor's Palace in Valletta, Selmun Palace near Mellieƒßa, and the Giordan Lighthouse near Gƒßasri, Gozo. Each station was manned by the Royal Engineers. The front of the tower The semaphore system became obsolete with the introduction of the electrical telegraph, and all the stations in Malta were closed by the 1880s. In World War II, the Gƒßargƒßur Semaphore Tower was used as an observation vantage point by men from the 2nd Battalion, Royal Irish Fusiliers. The tower eventually became private property, but it was taken over by the Gƒßargƒßur Local Council in 2004. The building was restored by the local council, the Restoration Unit of the Works Division and Fondazzjoni Wirt Artna in 2009. The restoration mainly focused on the outer walls at ground level, which had been damaged by humidity. The interior of the tower, which dates back to when it was still in use, was also preserved. The tower, known in Maltese as it-Torri tas-Semaforu, is now sometimes open to the public on special occasions. Architecture The Gƒßargƒßur Semaphore Tower is identical to the towers at Gƒßaxaq and Ta' Kenuna, consisting of three floors, each containing a single room. The floors are linked together and with the roof by a spiral staircase. The signalling equipment, consisting of a wooden pole with three movable arms, was located on the tower's roof.

The red bidirectional arrows indicate the aligned time positions of corresponding note events in the different representations. Music can be described and represented in many different ways including sheet music, symbolic representations, and audio recordings. For each of these representations, there may exist different versions that correspond to the same musical work. The general goal of music alignment (sometimes also referred to as music synchronization) is to automatically link the various data streams, thus interrelating the multiple information sets related to a given musical work. More precisely, music alignment is taken to mean a procedure which, for a given position in one representation of a piece of music, determines the corresponding position within another representation. In the figure on the right, such an alignment is visualized by the red bidirectional arrows. Such synchronization results form the basis for novel interfaces that allow users to access, search, and browse musical content in a convenient way. Basic procedure Overview of the processing pipeline of a typical music alignment procedure. Given two different music representations, typical music alignment approaches proceed in two steps. In the first step, the two representations are transformed into sequences of suitable features. In general, such feature representations need to find a compromise between two conflicting goals. On the one hand, features should show a large degree of robustness to variations that are to be left unconsidered for the task at hand. On the other hand, features should capture enough characteristic information to accomplish the given task. For music alignment, one often uses chroma-based features (also called chromagrams or pitch class profiles), which capture harmonic and melodic characteristics of music, while being robust to changes in timbre and instrumentation, are being used. In the second step, the derived feature sequences have to be brought into (temporal) correspondence. To this end, techniques related to dynamic time warping (DTW) or hidden Markov models (HMMs) are used to compute an optimal alignment between two given feature sequences. Related tasks Music alignment and related synchronization tasks have been studied extensively within the field of music information retrieval. In the following, we give some pointers to related tasks. Depending upon the respective types of music representations, one can distinguish between various synchronization scenarios. For example, audio alignment refers to the task of temporally aligning two different audio recordings of a piece of music. Similarly, the goal of score‚Äìaudio alignment is to coordinate note events given in the score representation with audio data. In the offline scenario, the two data streams to be aligned are known prior to the actual alignment. In this case, one can use global optimization procedures such as dynamic time warping (DTW) to find an optimal alignment. In general, it is harder to deal with scenarios where the data streams are to be processed online. One prominent online scenario is known as score following, where a musician is performing a piece according to a given musical score. The goal is then to identify the currently played musical events depicted in the score with high accuracy and low latency. In this scenario, the score is known as a whole in advance, but the performance is known only up to the current point in time. In this context, alignment techniques such as hidden Markov models or particle filters have been employed, where the current score position and tempo are modeled in a statistical sense. As opposed to classical DTW, such an online synchronization procedure inherently has a running time that is linear in the duration of the performed version. However, as a main disadvantage, an online strategy is very sensitive to local tempo variations and deviations from the score - once the procedure is out of sync, it is very hard to recover and return to the right track. A further online synchronization problem is known as automatic accompaniment. Having a solo part played by a musician, the task of the computer is to accompany the musician according to a given score by adjusting the tempo and other parameters in real time. Such systems were already proposed some decades ago.
