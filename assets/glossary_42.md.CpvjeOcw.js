The vegueria was headed by a veguer () and its office was called a vigeriate (). Vegueries were also in place during the Crown of Aragon dominion of Sardinia, and ‚Äìbriefly‚Äì during the same in the Duchy of Athens . History=Origins and functions The origins of the vegueria go back to the era of the Carolingian Empire, when vicars (Latin: vicarii, singular vicarius) were installed beneath the counts in the Marca Hispanica. The office of a vicar was a vicariate (Latin: vicariatus) and his territory was a vicaria. All these Latin terms of Carolingian administration evolved in the Catalan language even as they disappeared in the rest of Europe. The Catalan terms were even subsequently Latinised: vicarius ‚Üí vigerius. The original functions of the vigeriate were feudal and it was probably initially hereditary. The veguer was appointed by his feudal lord, the count, and was accountable to him. He was the military commander of his vegueria (and thus keeper of the publicly owned castles), the chief justice of the same district, and the man in charge of the public finances (the fisc) of the region entrusted to him. As time wore on, the functions of the veguer became more and more judicial in nature. He held a cort del veguer or de la vegueria with its own seal. The cort had authority in all matter save those relating to the feudal aristocracy. It commonly heard pleas of the crown, civil, and criminal cases. The veguer did, however, retain some military functions as well: he was the commander of the militia and the superintendent of royal castles. His job was law and order and the maintenance of the king's peace: in many respects an office analogous to that of the sheriff in England. Prime At the end of the twelfth century in Catalonia, there were twelve vegueries. By the end of the reign of Peter the Great (1285) there were seventeen, and by the time of James the Just there were twenty one. These administrative divisions remained until 1716. Some of the larger vegueries included one or more sotsvegueries (subvigueries), which had a large degree of autonomy. While Catalonia continued to use vegueries as subdivisions of counties, elsewhere in the Iberian peninsula there were the merin√°ticos (Kingdom of Aragon) and the corregimientos (Kingdom of Castile) whose functions were similar to those of the Catalan vegueries. When the Kingdom of Sicily became a Catalan-run state, it was not subdivided into vegueries, since a similar Italian institution was already entrenched there: that of the capitania and the capit√†. The capit√† had similar to identical functions as the veguer. When the Catalans conquered the Duchy of Athens, they subdivided that duchy into three vegueries: Athens, Thebes, and Livadia.Setton, Kenneth M. Catalan Domination of Athens 1311‚Äì1380. Revised edition. London: Variorum, 1975. In the Duchy of Neopatras which the Catalans conquered in 1319, the institution of the capit√† appeared instead of the vigeriate, but the captaincies (Siderokastron, Neopatras, and Salona) were similar to identical in function to the vegueries of Athens. In Athens, the offices of captain and veguer were often held by the same individual as capitaneus seu vigerius and variants. Once the Aragonese crown had finally subdued most of the Kingdom of Sardinia to their rule by the end of the fourteenth century, they had subdivided its government into vegueries. All the veguerias of the Catalan possessions were, by the Usages of Barcelona, constrained to be held for only three years by any individual, though in practice some kings ignored this. In Athens, a vicar general on the Italian model was instituted above the veguers. Historical vegueries Catalan vegueries have change their limits along the history and there has not always been the same number of them. Their history was terminated in 1716, when the vegueries were replaced by 12 corregimientos, a historical Castilian administrative division. The veguerias of Catalonial'Enciclopedia, vegueria. l'Enciclopedia, sotsveguer. l'Enciclopedia, sotsvegueria. at the time of James the Just were: *Tortosa *Tarragona *Montblanc *Barcelona (with Vall√®s sotsvegueria) *Osona *Bergued√† (with Manresa sotsvegueria) *Bages (with Moian√©s sotsvegueria) *Vilafranca del Pened√®s (with Igualada and Piera sotsvegueries) *Girona *Besal√∫ *Campodron *La Ral *Ripoll√®s *T√†rrega *Lleida (with Balaguer sotsvegueria) *Cervera (with Agramunt and Prats del Rei sotsvegueries) *Ribagor√ßa *Pallars *Camarasa *Rossell√≥ (with Vallespir sotsvegueria) *Conflent (with Capcir sotsvegueria) *Cerdanya (with Ribes and Barid√† sotsvegueries) Later, during the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, a few more vegueries were created: *UrgellGGCC, Alt Urgell *Balaguerl'Enciclipedia, vegueria de Balaguer *Agramuntl'Enciclopedia, vegueria d'Agramunt *Llu√ßan√®sConsell comarcal del Bages Attempts to reinstate vegueries in Catalonia in modern times Starting in 1822 Spain has been distributed into 50 provinces. The four Catalan provinces are somewhat bigger than the vegueries organization and, in modern times, there have been a few attempts to implement a smaller subdivision than that of the province, and this has been tried by means of re- instating smaller administration unit which would use the historical name of vegueria. Despite these attempts, to date the province continues to be the building block in Catalonia. Republican Generalitat 1931 Catalan regions, from 1936 to 1939 During the brief years of the Spanish Second Republic, the Catalan autonomous government divided Catalonia into nine regions, which, in turn, were subdivided into comarques. This brief organization (as follows below) is cited as a model for the latter-day attempts to implement a smaller administration unit than that of the province: * 1st region, the capital was Barcelona and comprised the comarques: Baix Llobregat, el Barcelon√®s, el Maresme, Vall√®s Occidental and el Vall√®s Oriental. * 2nd region, the capital was Girona and the comarques: l'Alt Empord√†, el Baix Empord√†, la Garrotxa, el Giron√®s, and la Selva (Pla de l'Estany, newly created in 1987, was back then included in this region). *3rd region, the capital was Tarragona and the comarques: l'Alt Camp, l'Alt Pened√®s, el Baix Pened√®s, el Garraf and el Tarragon√®s. * 4th region, the capital was Reus and the comarques: Baix Camp, la Conca de Barber√†, el Priorat and la Ribera d'Ebre. * 5th region, the capital was Tortosa and the comarques: Baix Ebre, el Montsi√† and la Terra Alta. * 6th region, the capital was Vic and the comarques: Baixa Cerdanya, Osona and el Ripoll√®s. * 7th region, the capital was Manresa and the comarques: l'Anoia, el Bages, el Bergued√† and el Solson√®s. * 8th region, the capital was Lleida and the comarques: les Garrigues, la Noguera, l'Urgell, la Segarra and el Segri√† (el Pla d'Urgell, newly created in 1987, was back then included in this region). * 9th region, the capital was Tremp and the comarques: l'Alt Urgell, el Pallars Juss√†, el Pallars Sobir√† and la Vall d'Aran (l'Alta Ribagor√ßa, newly created in 1987, was back then included in this region). Current proposals thumbCatalan regional plan 1995, used as the basis for different vegueries projects. When Franco died and Spain returned to a democratic system, the Spanish regions entered a process of intense devolution, from the central government, but also internally. In Catalonia, the comarcas were reinstated in 1987, although the veguerias have yet to be formally reclaimed. Under the 2006 Statute of Autonomy of Catalonia, the four diputacions provincials (provincial government of the provinces) which make up Catalonia are to be superseded by seven consells de vegueries (veguerial government), which will also take over many of the functions of the comarques. As of May 2011, the final boundaries of the new vegueries have not been formally approved. They were expected to be similar to the 9 regions of the Republican Generalitat, as follows: *√Ämbit metropolit√† de Barcelona: former 1st region, Alt Pened√®s and Garraf. *Alt Pirineu: former 9th region and Cerdanya, without Val d'Aran. *Camp de Tarragona: former 3rd region and 4th region. *Comarques Centrals: former 7th region and Osona. The proposed boundaries of this vegueria are contested by some. *Comarques Gironines: former 2nd and Ripoll√®s. Also contested.Vegueria de l'Alt Ter (campaign) *Ponent or Lleida: former 8th region. *Terres de l'Ebre: former 5th region and Ribera d'Ebre. Some associations and town councils involved have asked for a Pened√®s vegueria to be created, as it was in the past (13th century ‚Äî 1716). Plataforma per la Vegueria Pened√®s (campaign) This would include the Alt Pened√®s, Baix Pened√®s, Garraf and Anoia, comarcas which the current proposal split between the √Ämbit metropolit√†, Camp de Tarragona and Comarques Centrals. The city of Tarragona asks the government and the parliament to use the historical and official name Vegueria of Tarragona, used between the 13th century and 1716. The previous Catalan regional government (2006‚Äì2010) hinted plans to formally re-establish the vegueries in 2011Radio Banyoles, and use them as the \\"building blocks\\" of the region. However, the 2010 Catalan regional election produced a new legislature which has put these plans on hold.

They migrated to the Caucasus largely in the first half of the 19th century and settled in the North Caucasus, Georgia, Azerbaijan, Armenia and the region of Kars (present-day northeastern Turkey). In 1941, the majority of them were subject to deportation to Central Asia and Siberia during Joseph Stalin's population transfers in the Soviet Union. After Stalin's death in 1953 and the beginning of the Khrushchev Thaw, the Caucasus Germans were allowed to return, though few did. Many assimilated and, after 1991, emigrated to Germany.Mukhina, p. 169. Although the community today is a fraction of what it once was, many German buildings and churches are still extant, with some turned into museums. History=Origins The victory of the Russian Empire under Catherine the Great in the Russo-Turkish War of 1768‚Äì1774 ensured its expansion into the Caucasus. It also created a need in populating these lands with Russian subjects in order to hasten their exploration.Mukhina, p. 12. In the late 18th century, the government permitted families of Volga Germans to settle in the Kuban. However, poor infrastructure, lack of organization of the officials responsible for the settlement and the refusal of the military personnel to have these lands populated by non-Russians were an obstacle to steady and constant migration of the Germans. In 1815, while participating in the Congress of Vienna, Russian Tsar Alexander I visited Stuttgart, a city in his mother's native Kingdom of W√ºrttemberg. Upon witnessing the oppression that local peasants were undergoing either due to belonging to different non-Lutheran Protestant sects or to their participation in separatist movements, he arranged for their settlement in Russian Transcaucasia in order to form agricultural colonies. Katharinenfeld (now Bolnisi, Georgia) Early 19th century On September 21, 1818, the first German settlement in Transcaucasia, Marienfeld, was established by a group of Swabian Germans near the Georgian capital Tiflis (Tbilisi), along the Kakheti highway, now part of Sartichala. Two months later, another group of colonists founded another settlement in Georgia on the bank of the Asureti River and named it Elisabethtal, after the Emperor's wife Elizabeth Alexeievna (now Asureti in the Georgian province of Kvemo Kartli). Within the next year, five more colonies were established in eastern Georgia: New Tiflis (later Mikhailovsky Avenue, now part of David Agmashenebeli Avenue in Tbilisi), Alexandersdorf on the left bank of the Kura (now the vicinity of Akaki Tsereteli Avenue in Tbilisi), Petersdorf (near Marienfeld, now part of Sartichala) and Katharinenfeld (now Bolnisi). Three more colonies were founded in Abkhazia: Neudorf, Gnadenberg and Lindau. By the late 1840s, there were five German colonies in the North Caucasus. The migration waves (especially to the Don Host Oblast) grew beginning in the second half of the 19th century with the capitalist influence on farming in Russia. Germans would immigrate not only from the regions adjacent to the Volga River but also from the Black Sea region and Germany. The majority of these Germans adhered to various branches of Protestantism, most commonly Lutheranism, Mennonitism and Baptism. Roman Catholics formed a minority and lived in six colonies. The Arrival of Germans in the North Caucasus by Anzor Ostakhov. Previously available online at Eirpd.ru In the winter of 1818‚Äì1819, 194 Swabian families primarily from Reutlingen arrived in Elisabethpol (Ganja) in eastern Transcaucasia from Tiflis. They were granted land 6 kilometres to the west of the city and founded the town of Helenendorf (Goygol) in the summer of 1819. Another German settlement, the town of Annenfeld (later merged with the city of Shamkir) was founded almost simultaneously 40 kilometres away from Helenendorf. Baltic German explorer Friedrich Parrot visited Katharinenfeld and Elisabethtal during his expedition to Mount Ararat in 1829. Germans became an active and well-integrated community in Russian Transcaucasia. Unlike the settlement of Russian religious minorities, German colonies were located in \\"places that were more economically advantageous, close to cities or important transportation routes.\\" It became \\"typical for Caucasian administrative centers to have a satellite agrarian German colony.\\" According to Charles King, \\"rows of trees lined the main streets\\" of the German colonies near Tiflis. \\"Schools and churches, conducting their business in German, offered education and spiritual edification. Beer gardens provided the main entertainment.\\" In eastern Transcaucasia, German colonists were overwhelmingly bilingual in Azeri, while Russian was formally taught in schools starting in the late 19th century.Fred Zimmer (1901).

The Baltic German naturalist and explorer Friedrich Parrot encountered Swabian settlers near Tiflis on his expedition to Mount Ararat in 1829. He listed their settlements and personally visited Katharinenfeld and Elisabethtal, describing them: > These colonies may be known to be German at first sight from their style of > building, their tillage, their carts and wagons, their furniture and > utensils, mode of living, costume, and language. They contrast, therefore, > strongly with the villages of the natives, and very much to their advantage, > particularly in the eyes of one who has lived for some time, as was the case > with us, wholly among the latter. [...] At last, after riding for five > hours, I espied, high on the left bank of the river [i.e. the Khrami], > symptoms not to be mistaken of the German colony: these were, regularly- > built white houses, with good windows, doors, and ridge stone on the roof. I > joyfully rode up, and found that this was Katharinenfeld. Katherinenfeld on 14 August 1826 during the Russo-Persian War The colonies suffered during the Russo-Persian War of 1826‚Äì28. Many of the settlements had been raided by marauding Kurds in 1826 who, according to Parrot, killed 30 people of Katharinenfeld's 85 families and captured 130 more. Half of those had not yet returned at the time of the naturalist's visit in 1829. While visiting the great bazaar in Erivan (Yerevan) with Khachatur Abovian (the Armenian writer and national public figure), Parrot encountered \\"two W√ºrttemberg women, with five children\\" who \\"talked to one another in true Swabian dialect.\\"Parrot, p. 194. They were from Katharinenfeld and Parrot resolved to tell their relatives back home about their location. When Parrot visited the village and told the colonists the news, he was very well received. The two women who he met in Erivan returned from comparably benign captivity with a \\"wealthy Tatar chief\\" where they had been pressured to convert to Islam. Parrot surmised that others might have been sold into slavery deeper into Turkish territory. Furthermore, he told of a case where a man received a letter from his wife who had married a Persian cleric in captivity and therefore allowed him to remarry. Typical half-timbered German house in Asureti, Georgia (historic Elisabethtal)Some Germans moved voluntarily further south to Russian Armenia. Those who came from W√ºrttemberg were inspired by the concept of meeting the end of the world at the foot of Mount Ararat.Garnik Asatryan and Victoria Arakelova, The Ethnic Minorities of Armenia , Routledge, part of the OSCE, 2002 On the invitation of Parrot, the Armenian writer Abovian attended the German-speaking University of Dorpat (Tartu) in present-day Estonia. He became a Germanophile and, after his return to the Caucasus, married a German woman, Emilia Looze, in Tiflis. They moved to Abovian's native Armenia and \\"established a complete German household.\\" During his travels to the Caucasus during the Russo-Turkish War of 1828‚Äì1829, the celebrated Russian poet Aleksandr Pushkin visited one of the German colonies near Tiflis and recorded his experience in his Journey to Arzrum. He ate dinner there, but was unimpressed by the food and the beer. \\"We drank beer which is made there, with a very unpleasant taste, and paid very much for a very bad dinner,\\" he wrote. In 1843, during his visit to Russian Transcaucasia, German Baron August von Haxthausen also visited the German colonies of Georgia and the Tiflis region and extensively described their agricultural practices. He related an account from Moritz von Kotzebue about an unsuccessful religious pilgrimage of German colonists to Jerusalem, led by a woman who \\"knew the whole Bible by heart, from beginning to end\\" and who \\"exercised a kind of magical influence on all around her.\\"Haxthausen, pp. 54‚Äì56. During his travels in the Caucasus, Haxthausen was accompanied by Peter Neu, a Swabian colonist from the Tiflis area who had \\"a remarkable genius for languages and knew a dozen European and Asiatic tongues,‚ÄîGerman, French, Russian, Circassian, Tatar, Turkish, Armenian, Georgian, Persian, Kurdish, etc.\\" In addition, he \\"possessed a rich gift of poetical imagination and had an inexhaustible treasury of m√§rchen, legends and popular songs, gleaned from all the countries he had visited.\\"Haxthausen, p. 51. Neu accompanied Haxthausen, Khachatur Abovian and Abovian's uncle Harutiun on a visit to the Yazidi community of Armenia.Haxthausen, p. 177.

Germans from Helenendorf (present-day Goygol, Azerbaijan) in the 19th‚Äìearly 20th century Late imperial era Additional German colonies were established in eastern Transcaucasia during the latter half of the 19th century and in the beginning of the 20th century. In the Tiflis Governorate as of 1926, a total of 9,000 Germans lived in the colonies of Alexandersdorf (now part of Didube, Tbilisi), Alexandershilf (now Trialeti), Bl√ºmenthal (later Chapaevka, now Kavta), Elisabetthal (now Asureti), Freudenthal (now part of Sartichala), Georgsthal (now Dzveli Kanda), Gnadenberg (now Dziguta), Gr√ºnthal (later Akhali Ulianovka, now Ruisbolo), Hoffnungsthal (now Akhalsheni), Katharinenfeld, Lindau (now Lindava), Marienfeld (now part of Sartichala), Marnaul (now part of Marneuli), Neudorf (now Akhalsopeli), Neu Tiflis (now part of Kukia and Chughureti, Tbilisi), Petersdorf (now part of Sartichala), Steinfeld (now Kotishi), Traubenberg (now Tamarisi), Waldheim (now Ipnari), and Wiesendorf (now Akhali Marabda).Sudaba Zeynalova. Germans in the Caucasus, pp. 222-223. Beginning in the 1880s, in addition to Helenendorf and Annenfeld, six more German colonies were formed the Elisabethpol Governorate: Georgsfeld in 1888, Alexejewka in 1902, Gr√ºnfeld and Eichenfeld in 1906, Traubenfeld in 1912 and Jelisawetinka in 1914. They became populated mostly by the descendants of the Germans from the two older colonies of Helenendorf and Annenfeld. By 1918 according to the German consul in Constantinople, there were 6,000 Germans living in these colonies overall. Helenendorf became the primary spiritual center for the Germans of the eight colonies. The oldest Lutheran church in present-day Azerbaijan, St. John's Church, was built in this town in 1857. Other Lutheran churches were built in Gadabay, Shamakhi, Elisabethpol, Baku and Annenfeld in 1868, 1869, 1885, 1897 and 1911 respectively. The ceremony of laying the first stone of Baku's German Church of the Saviour was attended by Emanuel Nobel, brother of Alfred Nobel, and other members of the city's elite. Pages of History: German Settlers in Azerbaijan by Jeyla Ibrahimova. Azerbaijan-IRS Baku's booming oil industry attracted many people from all over the Caucasus. By 1903, the German population of the city had grown to 3,749 (2.4% of the city's entire population at the time) and consisted mostly of natives of the original German colonies.V.M. Karev (ed.).

September 2009/100. Jahrgang, p. 25 Notably, Richard Sorge, the famous ethnic German Soviet spy, was born in a suburb of Baku in 1895. His father was a German mining engineer who worked for the Caucasus Oil Company. Sorge is considered to have been one of the best Soviet spies in Japan before and during World War II and he was posthumously declared a Hero of the Soviet Union. The city of Baku dedicated a monument and park to him. Grape gathering in Helenendorf (Goygol), c. 1900 Commonly referred to as nems…ô (from the Russian –Ω–µ–º–µ—Ü ‚Äì \\"German\\") by the local Azerbaijani population, Germans in the Elisabethpol Governorate were traditionally engaged in farming. However, starting from 1860, viticulture was becoming more and more important in the life of the German agricultural communities. By the end of the 19th century, 58% of the region's wine production was manufactured by the Vohrer Brothers and the Hummel Brothers of Helenendorf. In 1865 and 1883, Siemens built two copper smelteries in Gadabay and a hydroelectric station in Galakand. In the 1860s, it initiated cobalt extraction in Dashkasan and built two power stations in Baku.Rauf Huseynzadeh. Germans of Azerbaijan. IRS magazine. The Siemens smelteries were officially closed down in 1914 when the Russian Empire entered World War I fighting against Germany and the tsarist government banned all German businesses in Russia.Kamal Ali. Spirit of Departed Germans in Gadabay. Echo. 31 March 2012. Following the Russo-Turkish War of 1877‚Äì1878, Imperial Russia annexed the Kars region from the Ottoman Empire. The tsarist government launched a campaign to populate the newly established Kars Oblast with perceived \\"reliable\\" populations, including Germans.Tsutsiev, p. 35. In 1891, a number of German families were resettled in Kars from the colony of Alexandershilf near Tiflis and established the village of Petrovka.American Historical Society of Germans from Russia. The Society, 1986; p. 11 Its population remained relatively low and consisted of about 200 people by 1911. Another two colonies in the province, Vladikars and Estonka, were founded between 1911 and 1914. These settlements were short-lived. Due to the Russian- Ottoman military confrontation at the start of World War I, most of the remaining German settlers from the Kars Oblast were evacuated to Eichenfeld. The Kars region itself was eventually annexed by Turkey in the treaties of Moscow and Kars.Tsutsiev, p. 81. From 1906 to 1922, Baron Kurt von Kutschenbach published the German-language newspaper Kaukasische Post in Tiflis. It called itself the \\"only German newspaper in the Caucasus.\\" The editor-in-chief was the writer, journalist and Caucasus scholar Arthur Leist. After the outbreak of World War I, Russian government attempts to Russify the German colonies in the Caucasus created a local backlash. Following Russian Revolutions of 1917 and the formation of the Transcaucasian Federation, German colonists formed the Transcaucasian German National Council (Transkaukasischer Deutscher Nationalrat), with its seat in Tiflis. In May 1918, the Transcaucasian Federation dissolved and the short-lived republics of Georgia, Azerbaijan and Armenia were established. The German colonists strove to maintain their communities amid the upheaval of the Russian Civil War in the Caucasus. In the short-lived Azerbaijan Democratic Republic, the centenary of Helenendorf was marked by a public celebration within the community. The German community was also represented in the parliament of the republic by Lorenz Kuhn, a Helenendorf-born oil industry businessman.Chronology of the German Settlement of Azerbaijan . Konkordia-az.com Soviet era View on Annenfeld (within present-day Shamkir, Azerbaijan) ca. 1900 Following the victory of the Bolsheviks in the Russian Civil War and the Sovietization of the Caucasus, the new Soviet government initially demonstrated a favorable attitude toward multiculturalism in the era of the New Economic Policy (NEP). The cultural and linguistic rights of ethnic groups were promoted by Soviet authorities in accordance with the korenizatsiya (nativization) policy of Soviet nationalities. In 1926, there were seven public primary schools in Soviet Azerbaijan with German as the language of instruction.Network of Primary Schools in the Azerbaijan SSR for the School Year 1926/27 by Language of Instruction (p. 192) The First All-Union Census of the Soviet Union in 1926 showed that 93,915 Caucasus Germans lived in the North Caucasus region of the Russian SFSR.Mukhina, p. 176. Within the Transcaucasian SFSR, 13,149 lived in the Azerbaijan SSR, 12,047 in the Georgian SSR and 104 in the Armenian SSR. The All-Union Population Census of 1926. Demoscope.ru The situation changed with the rise of Joseph Stalin. The Soviet government gradually ordered all German-sounding place-names to be changed by the mid-1930s.

After the invasion of the Soviet Union by Nazi Germany in June 1941, the Caucasus Germans were internally deported by Soviet authorities to Central Asia and Siberia on the pretext that their loyalties were with Germany, even though this was not the case.Mukhina, p. 46. According to scholar Pavel Polian, most of the Caucasus Germans (approximately 190,000 people) were deported from the North and South Caucasus to Kazakhstan and Siberia from September 1941 to June 1942. The deportees were allowed to take very little luggage, hardly any food and then had to undergo a voyage across the Caspian Sea to the camps of Central Asia. They were told the voyage would only be for several days but many ships went back and forth for months, resulting in mass death from starvation and the climate, especially among children, the elderly and the sick. On one ship carrying deportees, about 775 Germans froze to death. Evidently, maritime officials had no clear instructions to land the deportees at a particular destination and were prohibited from landing them anywhere else. They eventually arrived by rail in the Lake Balkhash area, in Kazakhstan. This torment can be ascribed, in part, to the confusion caused by the war, but also, more importantly, to the typical callous treatment of political prisoners by the Stalin regime, which did not care if prisoners lived or died. The following eye-witness report relates a harrowing story of evacuation by ship: > For two months ethnic Germans from the Caucasus were pointlessly dragged > back and forth on the Caspian Sea, and more people, especially children, > were dying of starvation. They were just thrown overboard. My four-year-old > son was thrown there as well. My other son, seven years of age, saw that. He > grabbed my skirt and begged me with tears in his eyes: 'Mummy, don't let > them throw me in the water. I beg you, leave me alive, and I will always be > with you and take care of you when I grow up'... I always cry when I > remember that he also died of starvation and was thrown overboard, which he > feared so much. The only ones not subject to deportation were German women (and their descendants) who were married to non-Germans. Soon after Stalin's death in 1953 and the rise of Nikita Khrushchev to the Soviet leadership, the ban for the majority of the deported peoples to return to their homes was lifted. However, relatively few Germans returned to the Caucasus region. By 1979, there were only 46,979 Germans living in both North and South Caucasus. The All-Union Population Census of 1979. Demoscope.ru History since 1991 There has been renewed interest in the Caucasus German community in the post- Soviet space since the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991. The 2014 census recorded only two Germans living in the Bolnisi municipality.Georgia 2014 census. The German town cemetery was leveled under Stalin and is marked today by a memorial honouring the memory of the German colonists. Recently, there has been increasing interest in Georgia on the part of local youth to find out more about their German heritage. Often this desire is closely related to Protestant beliefs, so as a result the New Apostolic Church works intensively with these young people as part of its regular youth programs. In Azerbaijan, the remaining Germans are concentrated in the capital city of Baku, and many belong to the Evangelical Lutheran Community restored and officially registered in the early 1990s.

Already small compared to the historical German communities of the neighboring Georgia and Azerbaijan, Armenia's remaining German population declined following the country's independence in 1991 due to economic factors. Many of the country's Germans emigrated to Germany. In recent years, the German community has been working closely with the German Educational and Cultural Center of Armenia to help organize German language schools and cultural events. The last German resident of the Estonka colony (the present-day village of Karaca√∂ren in the Kars Province of Turkey), Frederik Albuk, died in 1999 in his native village, survived by his wife Olga Albuk of Russian-Estonian ancestry, who died there in August 2011.

She is known for her independent rule over her fiefs Lolland and Falster, the castles in Kiel and Pl√∂n, and several villages in Holstein as queen. Life Born in Stettin (Szczecin) into the House of Pomerania, she was the daughter of Bogislaw X, Duke of Pomerania and the Polish princess Anna Jagiellon. After the death of his first spouse Anna of Brandenburg in 1514, she married the future Frederick I of Denmark. Not much is known about her personality. She is not known to have played any political role. She is thought to have been interested in religion: a German psalm, ¬´Gott ist mein Heil, mein H√ºlf und Trost¬ª, is believed to have been written by her. Sophie became queen consort of Denmark and Norway upon the ascension of her spouse to the throne in 1523. She was crowned 13 August 1525. At her coronation, she was granted Lolland and Falster, the castles in Kiel and Pl√∂n, and several villages in Holstein for her income. In 1526, Anne Meinstrup was appointed head lady-in-waiting for her court. Queen Sophie did not live at the Danish court as queen, but resided separated from her spouse on her property in Kiel, and treated her estates as her private independent fiefs, which caused disagreements with her spouse during his reign. The conflicts continued during the reign of his successors and until her death. In 1533, she became a widow and moved to Gottorp Castle with her children, awaiting the outcome of the election of the new king. During the Count's Feud 1533‚Äì36, her estates was occupied. In 1538, the new king asked her to leave Gottorp because of the costs and reside in Kiel.

The flight is fluttering and sometimes bat-like. Until 2018, this family's three species were included with the other storm-petrels in family Hydrobatidae. *Wilson's storm-petrel, Oceanites oceanicus Northern storm-petrels Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Hydrobatidae Though the members of this family are similar in many respects to the southern storm- petrels, including their general appearance and habits, there are enough genetic differences to warrant their placement in a separate family. *European storm-petrel, Hydrobates pelagicus (A) *Leach's storm-petrel, Hydrobates leucorhous *Band-rumped storm-petrel, Hydrobates castro Shearwaters and petrels Sooty shearwater Order: ProcellariiformesFamily: Procellariidae The procellariids are the main group of medium-sized \\"true petrels\\", characterized by united tubular nostrils with a median septum. *Northern fulmar, Fulmarus glacialis (A) *Black-capped petrel, Pterodoma hasitata *Fea's petrel, Pterodroma feae (A) *Cory's shearwater, Calonectris diomedea *Short-tailed shearwater, Ardenna tenuirostris (A) *Sooty shearwater, Ardenna griseus *Great shearwater, Ardenna gravis *Manx shearwater, Puffinus puffinus (A) *Audubon's shearwater, Puffinus lherminieri Storks Order: CiconiiformesFamily: Ciconiidae Storks are large, heavy, long-legged, long-necked wading birds with long stout bills and wide wingspans. They lack the powder down that other wading birds such as herons, spoonbills and ibises use to clean off fish slime. Storks lack a pharynx and are mute. *Wood stork, Mycteria americana Frigatebirds Order: SuliformesFamily: Fregatidae Frigatebirds are large seabirds usually found over tropical oceans. They are large, black, or black- and-white, with long wings and deeply forked tails. The males have colored inflatable throat pouches. They do not swim or walk and cannot take off from a flat surface. Having the largest wingspan-to-body-weight ratio of any bird, they are essentially aerial, able to stay aloft for more than a week. *Magnificent frigatebird, Fregata magnificens Boobies and gannets Northern gannet Order: SuliformesFamily: Sulidae The sulids comprise the gannets and boobies. Both groups are medium-large coastal seabirds that plunge-dive for fish. *Masked booby, Sula dactylatra *Brown booby, Sula leucogaster *Red- footed booby, Sula sula (A) *Northern gannet, Morus bassanus Anhingas Order: SuliformesFamily: Anhingidae Anhingas, also known as darters or snakebirds, are cormorant-like water birds with long necks and long, straight beaks. They are fish eaters, diving for long periods, and often swim with only their neck above the water, looking rather like a water snake. *Anhinga, Anhinga anhinga Cormorants and shags Order: SuliformesFamily: Phalacrocoracidae Cormorants are medium-to-large aquatic birds, usually with mainly dark plumage and areas of colored skin on the face. The bill is long, thin, and sharply hooked. Their feet are four-toed and webbed. *Great cormorant, Phalacrocorax carbo (A) *Double-crested cormorant, Phalacrocorax auritus *Neotropic cormorant, Phalacrocorax brasilianus (A) Pelicans Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Pelecanidae Pelicans are very large water birds with a distinctive pouch under their beak. Like other birds in the order Pelecaniformes, they have four webbed toes. *American white pelican, Pelecanus erythrorhynchos *Brown pelican, Pelecanus occidentalis Herons, egrets, and bitterns Cattle egret Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Ardeidae The family Ardeidae contains the herons, egrets, and bitterns. Herons and egrets are wading birds with long necks and legs. Herons are large and egrets are smaller. The cattle egret or \\"cow bird\\" is seen amongst flocks of cattle, for instance in ranches north of the Everglades. A bird will often attach itself to a particular bull, cow or calf, even being tolerated perching on the back or even the head of the animal. The birds are more shy than the animals, and will fly away if approached. The birds feed on various items turned over by the cattle as they graze and tramp the ground. Bitterns tend to be shorter necked and more secretive. Unlike other long-necked birds such as storks, ibises, and spoonbills, members of the Ardeidae fly with their necks pulled back into a curve. *American bittern, Botaurus lentiginosus *Least bittern, Ixobrychus exilis *Great blue heron, Ardea herodias *Great egret, Ardea alba *Snowy egret, Egretta thula *Little blue heron, Egretta caerulea *Tricolored heron, Egretta tricolor *Reddish egret, Egretta rufescens *Cattle egret, Bubulcus ibis *Green heron, Butorides virescens *Black-crowned night-heron, Nycticorax nycticorax *Yellow-crowned night-heron, Nyctanassa violacea Ibises and spoonbills Order: PelecaniformesFamily: Threskiornithidae The family Threskiornithidae includes the ibises and spoonbills. They have long, broad wings. Their bodies are elongated, the neck more so, with long legs. The bill is also long, curved downward in the ibises, straight and markedly flattened in the spoonbills. *White ibis, Eudocimus albus *Scarlet ibis, Eudocimus ruber (A) *Glossy ibis, Plegadis falcinellus *White-faced ibis, Plegadis chihi *Roseate spoonbill, Platalea ajaja New World vultures Order: CathartiformesFamily: Cathartidae New World vultures are not closely related to Old World vultures, but superficially resemble them because of convergent evolution. Like the Old World vultures, they are scavengers. Unlike Old World vultures, which find carcasses by sight, New World vultures have a good sense of smell with which they locate carcasses. The turkey vulture has a red head. The black vulture has a grey head. Although not a water bird, a flock of black vultures at the Myakka River State Park, southeast of Sarasota, has been seen bathing at the edge of the lake and then drying out their wings in the same way as cormorants like the Florida anhinga. This habit may help free them of parasites. *Black vulture, Coragyps atratus *Turkey vulture, Cathartes aura Osprey Order: AccipitriformesFamily: Pandionidae Pandionidae is a family of fish-eating birds of prey possessing a very large, powerful hooked beak for tearing flesh from their prey, strong legs, powerful talons, and keen eyesight.

Biography Harunobu was born in Hinoe Castle, the Arima clan castle that controlled the Shimabara area of Hizen Province. After Harunobu's father's death, he began the persecution of Christians in his region. With Ry≈´z≈çji Takanobu expanding into his domain, Harunobu turned to the help of the Jesuits. Harunobu was baptized by Alessandro Valignano in 1579. He took the baptismal name Protasius, and later took the name John when he received Confirmation. As a result of his conversion to Christianity, Harunobu started to receive weapons from the Portuguese, which strengthened the Arima clan. He also founded a seminary and training center for novices in his domain where, apart from the ordinary curriculum, students were also taught European music, painting and sculpture and the manufacture of organs and pocketwatch. In 1582 Harunobu teamed up with the Ky≈´sh≈´ Christian daimiy≈çs ≈åtomo S≈çrin and ≈åmura Sumitada to send a Japanese embassy to the Pope in Rome, led by Valignano and represented by Mancio It≈ç. In 1586, he had a vision in which there appeared to him two persons of celestial exterior, who thus spoke to him: \\"Know that on the lands over which you rule, the sign of Jesus is found; honor and love it much, for it is not the work of man.\\" Six months afterwards, it happened that a fervent Christian from the neighborhood of Arima sent his son to the woods to cut firewood. On his arrival the young man noticed a tree that was somewhat dried up; he split it in two, and found inserted in the middle of it a cross of a brown color and of a regular form. As soon as Harunobu heard of this, he went to the place, and on seeing the cross he cried out: \\"Behold the sign of Jesus, that I was told was hidden in my dominions, and that was not made by the hand of man.\\" He then fell on his knees, and after having venerated it amidst many tears, he had it carried to Arima, where by his order it was formed in a magnificent crystal. This miraculous cross brought about the conversion of twenty thousand people.St. Alphonsus Liguori. Victories of the Martyrs pp. 316‚Äì317 When Toyotomi Hideyoshi expelled the Catholic fathers and outlawed the teaching of Christianity in 1587, the Arima domain became a refuge for many Christian missionaries and believers. During the year 1582, Harunobu lost Shimabara Castle and was reduced to holding a thin strip of the peninsula. Harunobu called for the help of the Shimazu clan against the forces of Ry≈´z≈çji Takanobu. The Shimazu sent Shimazu Iehisa to Shimabara. During the year 1584, the combined forces of the Arima and the Shimazu, with over 3,000 troops, defeated that of the Ry≈´z≈çji. The battle that they fought was known as the Battle of Okitanawate. During that battle, Ry≈´z≈çji Takanobu was killed. Afterwards, Shimazu Yoshihisa suggested that the Arima renounce Christianity, but this was only refused by Harunobu. After Ky≈´sh≈´ was invaded in 1587, Harunobu allied with Toyotomi Hideyoshi. During the year 1592, the allied force led some 2,000 men to Korea under Konishi Yukinaga. During the Battle of Sekigahara in 1600, Harunobu supported Tokugawa Ieyasu, and thus did not lose any land after the battle. Okamoto Daihachi incident During the year 1609, Harunobu was tasked to scout out a potential trade center for Japanese, Chinese, and Western ships. When they arrived in Taiwan, the indigenous Taiwanese attacked Harunobu's men, and many were killed. Later that same year, a trading party Harunobu had sent to Champa was attacked by the Portuguese while stopping at Macau. Harunobu retaliated the following year by attacking the Portuguese trading ship Madre de Deus, bound for Nagasaki from Macau. Immediately following this incident, the Okamoto Daihachi incident resulted in Arima Harunobu's death. A certain Okamoto Daihachi, who was a servant of Tokugawa Ieyasu's close advisor Honda Masazumi, was sent to Harunobu to congratulate him on his triumph against the Portuguese. Okamoto was also a Christian and he was entertained by Arima Harunobu with a feast. During the banquet, Okamoto told Arima that through his influence upon his master, he could help Arima recover three districts (gun (ÈÉ°)) that were lost to the Ry≈´z≈çji clan over the preceding years. Arima believed him and sent him payments of gold and silver to lobby for him in the Tokugawa government. However, Okamoto pocketed the money and never did anything about the situation. When Arima Harunobu encountered Honda Masazumi during his obligatory visit to Edo, he learned that Honda was unaware of Harunobu's dealings with Okamoto. Furious with Okamoto, Arima presented the case to Tokugawa Ieyasu. Ieyasu immediately imprisoned Okamoto; further investigation revealed that Arima had various other dealings with Okamoto and they were involved in a conspiracy to assassinate the Bugyo of Nagasaki. In the end, Okamoto was to sentenced to death by fire, while Arima was stripped of his holdings and exiled to Kai Province. Death When Arima was ordered by the Shogunate to commit suicide, Arima refused based upon his Christian principles and instead ordered his retainers to behead him. St. Alphonsus Liguori wrote of his death as follows: > The emperor had deposed and exiled him, in consequence of an odious intrigue > concocted against him by his own son, named Michael. In his exile King John > led a very penitent life, to repair all the bad example that he had given, > and he desired nothing so much as to expiate by his death his past > iniquities. God soon brought about the accomplishment of his desires. Prince > Michael, not content with having thus humbled his father, and with seating > himself on his throne, wished also to deprive him of life. He had him > accused to the emperor of several supposed crimes. The latter, taking > counsel only of the hatred that he bore him, condemned him without trial to > be beheaded, and sent one hundred and fifty soldiers to carry out the > sentence. It is the custom in Japan that when it is desired that a prince > should die, the persons of his court defend him till death. But John begged > his servants not to oppose his execution, and through affection for him they > obeyed most reluctantly. Moreover, he made them swear not to open his body > after death ... He then wrote to his unnatural son a letter full of > tenderness, and asked his pardon should he ever have offended him. He > afterwards had the Passion of Jesus Christ read to him, praying with tears > that the many sins of his past life might be forgiven him. Having had a > crucifix put before him, he went on his knees and calmly awaited the death- > blow. The good Princess Justa, his wife, who was present, took the head of > her husband between her hands and kissed it. Then she withdrew to her > apartments, where she cut off her hair, indicating thereby that she > renounced the world. The new king of Arima, the infamous parricide Michael, > after having taken possession of all the goods of his father, declared war > against the Christian religion ... St. Alphonsus Liguori, The Victories of > the Martyrs, pg. 345‚Äì346 His son Arima Naozumi married Tokugawa Ieyasu's adopted daughter Kuni-hime and as a result inherited the land that was confiscated from his father.

Green George Gill Green (January 16, 1842 - February 26, 1925) was a patent medicine entrepreneur, and Union surgeon in the American Civil War. Biography George Gill Green was born in Clarksboro, East Greenwich Township, New Jersey, to Mary Ann (1820-1844) and Lewis M. Green (1818-1894). George Green's mother was from Pennsylvania, and his father worked as a butcher. Green attended the University of Pennsylvania medical school for two years, but left in 1864 before he graduated. He enlisted in the 142nd Illinois Volunteer Infantry Regiment (active 1864-1865) during the American Civil War (1861-1865). In 1867 he started a wholesale drug business in Baltimore, Maryland but the factory was destroyed by a fire. He moved to Ohio, married Angie Brown, and they had their first child there. Green bought the rights to \\"Green's August Flower\\" and \\"Dr. Boschee's German Syrup\\" from his father, Lewis, who sold the elixir under the name \\"L.M. Green\\". George created a marketing campaign involving mass mailings of free samples, and the distribution of thousands of his almanacs. Both elixirs were mostly laudanum. He became a millionaire and in 1880 he built Woodbury's Opera House. The family moved to Woodbury, New Jersey on November 23, 1872. The Greens had a son, George Gill Green II, born January 17, 1883 and died in January 1971. In 1893 Green acquired an uncompleted hotel in Pasadena, California, and in 1894 completed and opened it as the Hotel Green. Green completed a summer home, \\"Kil Kare Castle,\\" in 1895 at Lake Hopatcong in New Jersey. In 1898 Green built an annex west of the Hotel Green, the \\"Central Annex\\" building or \\"Castle Green\\" on the block across Raymond Avenue. \\"Castle Green\\" is listed on the National Register of Historic Places in Pasadena, the California State Historic Landmark Register, and the City of Pasadena Register of City Treasures.

Club career Bowles began his career as an apprentice at Manchester City, although his fiery temper resulted in his falling out with coach Malcolm Allison and being released after a series of off-field incidents. After a brief and unsuccessful stay at Bury, he was signed by Ernie Tagg, manager of Crewe Alexandra, then in the Fourth Division, where his skill caught the eye of a number of bigger clubs. In October 1971 he was signed by Carlisle United, at the time a Second Division club, scoring 13 goals in 36 appearances for the club. After a managerial change at the club, he was sold to Queens Park Rangers (QPR) for ¬£110,000 in September 1972. He replaced in the team a previous QPR folk-hero, Rodney Marsh, who had been transferred to Bowles' first club Manchester City only six months before. Bowles took over Marsh's number 10 shirt, which other players had been reluctant to wear in fear of being compared unfavourably to the mercurial Marsh. Bowles had no such qualms about taking the shirt, joking that, coming from the North, he had never really heard of Marsh. Bowles was often regarded as something of a character both on and off the pitch. Bowles has been known to cite a notable incident in his playing days involving the famous FA Cup trophy. Having won the FA Cup competition four days prior, Sunderland were parading the trophy at Roker Park on 9 May 1973 when they met QPR in the old Division 2. The trophy had been placed on a table at the side of the pitch when Bowles tore straight across the park and claims to have kicked the ball at it full speed, sending the Cup flying through the air. According to Stan, the crowd predictably went ballistic, but he had the last laugh by scoring two goals in the match which ended in a pitch invasion. Some reports suggest that some of the QPR players had laid bets as to who could hit the trophy first. However this version of events has been disputed and, according to Gordon Jago (QPR's manager at the time), it was Bowles's teammate, defender Tony Hazell, who struck the cup with an accidental clearance. Bowles spent just over seven years at QPR, playing a central role in arguably the club's greatest ever team, that which finished as league runners-up in 1975‚Äì76 under Dave Sexton. A 2004 fans poll saw him voted the club's all-time greatest player. In 1979, Bowles fell out with QPR's new manager, Tommy Docherty. Bowles responded to Docherty's plea of \\"You can trust me, Stan\\" with \\"I'd rather trust my chickens with Colonel Sanders\\". Docherty made Bowles train with the reserves for nearly six months, before selling Bowles to Nottingham Forest in December 1979. Despite the fallout between Docherty and Bowles, Docherty continued to play Bowles for QPR right up until he was sold to Nottingham Forest. At Nottingham Forest, Bowles failed to settle under the management of Brian Clough and he ruled himself out of the 1980 European Cup Final after Clough refused to allow Bowles to play in John Robertson's testimonial. Bowles was essentially understudy to the world's first ¬£1 million signing Trevor Francis during his one season at the City Ground, and before the season was out Clough was already targeting Coventry City's top scorer Ian Wallace as his replacement. Bowles was then sold to Leyton Orient for ¬£100,000 after making only 23 appearances in all competitions. He joined Brentford the following year and remained at the club until retiring at the end of the 1982‚Äì83 season.Croxford, Lane & Waterman, p. 93. Bowles came out of retirement to briefly rejoin the club on a non-contract basis during 1983‚Äì84 season, before retiring again in February 1984.Croxford, Lane & Waterman, pp. 116‚Äì118. He received a testimonial in 1987, earning ¬£17,000. Post-retirement, he continued to play at non-league level for Epping Town. His 1996 autobiography revealed the extent of his drinking, womanising and gambling during his playing days, and also helped to secure a role as a pundit on Sky Sports, where he again replaced Rodney Marsh. Bowles is also the life chairman of the Queens Park Rangers supporters group L.S.A (Loyal Supporters Association). A cult icon, he had a single released bearing his name, Stan Bowles by The Others. Bowles has also written betting columns in the national press and a column in 'lads' mag' Loaded and also appeared on the after dinner speaker circuit. He was also the personal favourite player of John Barnes.url=\\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fuiDGojirU\\" International career He made his international debut against Portugal in April 1974 in Sir Alf Ramsey's last match in charge. Despite his unquestionable ability and consistently high-level league performances, he won only five caps for England, all while playing for QPR (playing for three managers: Sir Alf Ramsey, Joe Mercer and Don Revie) and scored his only international goal in a 2‚Äì0 win over Wales at Ninian Park in 1974. Personal life Bowles is a cousin of Paul Bowles. On 20 June 2015, Stan Bowles was reported to be a sufferer from Alzheimer's disease.

It operated as a music venue between 2001 and 2008. The Ambassador's current use is as an exhibition hall & event centre. The building was constructed as part of the Rotunda Hospital in 1764 as an assembly hall and social rooms on what is now called Parnell Street. From 1897 onwards, the venue was given the name Rotund Room and hosted a number of \\"moving picture\\" screenings which were a great novelty at the time. From about 1908 onwards, it was used more regularly to show film presentations and in 1910 it became a full-time cinema, with 736 seats, a basic layout at the time. Again known as the Rotunda (its nickname being the 'Roto' or the 'Roxy'), the cinema-going public thronged to the venue. Over the years, the cinema changed hands until the 1940s when it was run by Capitol and Allied Theatres Ltd. In the 1950s, the cinema was redesigned, increasing the capacity to 1,200. Added to the main hall was a balcony (containing 500 seats) with private boxes. A new entrance area was also constructed. The cinema was reopened on 23 September 1954 as the Ambassador. It became a gala event venue, holding screenings of many films for the first time. Of note was the screening of The Blue Max in 1966, which was shot in Ireland. For the screening, a World War I plane adorned the roof of the cinema above the entrance. In 1977, the cinema was forced to close briefly, but it reopened that summer under new ownership. The Green Group ran the cinema until 1988, and the cinema mainly played children's films such as The Care Bears Movie and its sequels. In 1988, with single-screen cinemas on the wane, it closed. However, in 1994 it was given a new lease of life when it reopened under the ownership of Ward Anderson. Notable screenings upon reopening included Titanic, however, attendances were poor, most notably when a reissue of the 1935 film The Informer was screened to as few as two people per show. On 27 September 1999, after 45 years, the cinema closed. This however was not the end of the venue. Entertainment promoters MCD Productions leased the building and for a number of years ran The Ambassador as a live music venue, until 2008. The Ambassador now hosts a variety of events including exhibitions, one off concerts and corporate events. Recent events include Bodies exhibition, CSI: The Experience, Dinosaur Encounters, Princess Exhibition, Game On, Santa's Playland, Xbox launch, Jameson Live presents White Lies, and running from Spring to Summer 2014, Lego exhibition The Art Of The Brick.

It can be contrasted with the law on domicile, traditionally used in common law jurisdictions to do the same thing. Habitual residence is less demanding than domicile and the focus is more on past experience rather than future intention. There is normally only one habitual residence where the individual usually resides and routinely returns to after visiting other places. It is the geographical place considered \\"home\\" for a reasonably significant period of time. Discussion The concept of habitual residence is used in a number of international conventions, beginning with the Hague Convention on Civil Procedure of 14 November 1896 and a number of international conventions dealing with conflict to complement or supplant the traditional connecting factor of domicile, e.g. in the Rome Convention 1980, but it was replaced, with respect to legal entities by the new connecting factor of principal office. It is the basis of the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees, the Convention on International Child Abduction,Full text of the Convention etc. Habitual residence is something less than domicile but more than simple residence. It may also be more discriminating that the test of nationality or lex patriae in that the connection is to a specific location within a state rather than to the country of nationality which may contain several subnational jurisdictions (such as states or provinces). Hence, where a country contains more than one legal system, the residence must determine which of the several possible laws might apply (e.g. in the United States which of the laws of the U.S. states is to be applied). A supranational example of this selection process is contained in Article 19 of the Rome Convention: :States with more than one legal system #Where a State comprises several territorial units each of which has its own rules of law in respect of contractual obligations, each territorial unit shall be considered as a country for the purposes of identifying the law applicable under this Convention. #A State within which different territorial units have their own rules of law in respect of contractual obligations shall not be bound to apply this Convention to conflicts solely between the laws of such units. Comparison with domicile To establish a domicile of choice, it is necessary to have a clear factual base in one state and that must be accompanied by an animus semper manendi (). Although it is not so difficult to produce evidence that an individual has established a home in a state, it is very difficult to prove that someone has no intention of ever establishing a home in another state. The test for habitual residence is less demanding. The court focuses on the past experience of the individual and not so much on future intention. A person can have only one habitual residence. It is the place where the individual ordinarily resides and routinely returns to after visiting other places. It is the place he or she would consider to be \\"home\\" and it is established as a matter of geography over a reasonably significant period of time. Since habitual residence is a test of fact, it cannot be a purely legal concept and there are different views about the factual situations which it is supposed to denote. Some authors believe that the sole criterion that the test of habitual residence should be purely objective, seeking evidence of physical presence over a considerable period of time. Others assert that the test should be both objective and subjective elements: the factum or physical presence in a given place and the animus to continue to stay there. The Hague Conference on Private International Law has deliberately refrained from offering a definition so that the concept may be flexible and adaptable to practical requirements. Thus, habitual residence may be interpreted differently in different Conflict situations. However, the core of the test will tend to be based on evidence of a long-term stay accompanied by other evidence of the individual's personal and professional life to demonstrate the continuity of the connection between that person and the place of residence. To that extent, the intention of the individual may have some weight. But it may be difficult to determine where a person has a habitual residence if constantly on the move and has no real or continuing connection with any of the countries through which passed. This could be resolved by reference to the individual's intention, but although the test of intention is well-defined in the case law for the purposes of domicile, there is no consensus of the strength of intention that would have to be shown to establish \\"habit\\". Similarly, there is no consensus on the length of time a person should have a home for it to become habitual. In some countries, the legislature has produced a test. In Canada, Manitoba abolished the common law test of domicile and substituted the following: ReferencesSee also *Ordinarily resident status *Habitual residence test Sources *Agne Limante (2018) Establishing habitual residence of adults under the Brussels IIa regulation: best practices from national case-law, Journal of Private International Law, 14:1, 160‚Äì181, DOI: 10.1080/17441048.2018.1442128 External links * Index of documents on the subject, UNHCR Category:Conflict of laws Category:Legal tests Category:Home ","title":"Habitual residence"},{"id":"4162140","text":"Straumgjerde is a village in Sykkylven Municipality in M√∏re og Romsdal county, Norway.

Life and career Welliver was born in Millville, Pennsylvania. He graduated from the Philadelphia College of Art (now part of the University of the Arts) and then received an MFA from Yale University. At Yale, he studied with the abstract artists Burgoyne Diller and Josef Albers, whose theories on color were influential.Welliver et al., 25 Welliver taught at Cooper Union from 1953 to 1957 and at Yale from 1956 to 1966. In 1966, he began teaching at, and eventually became chairman of the University of Pennsylvania Graduate School of Fine Art, from which he retired in 1989. While teaching at Yale, Welliver's style evolved from abstract color field painting to the realistic transcription of small-town scenes in watercolor. In the early 1960s he went to Maine, where he began painting figures outdoors, the large oil paintings often focusing on his sons canoeing or female nudes bathing. In 1970 he moved permanently to Lincolnville, and by the mid 1970s the figure as subject had given way to the exclusive study of landscape. His mature works, often as large as , are at once richly painted abstractions and clear representational images of intimate Maine landscapes, taking as their subjects rocky hills, beaver houses, tree stumps, and rushing water, occasionally opening out to blue cloud-laden skies. Carrying his equipment on his back, Welliver hiked into the woods to make plein-air sketches. His equipment-laden backpack weighed 70 pounds, and included eight colors of oil paint: white, ivory black, cadmium red scarlet, manganese blue, ultramarine blue, lemon yellow, cadmium yellow, and talens green light.Welliver et al., 22 These plein-air studies usually took about 9 hours, and were painted in 3 hour increments, after which time the light would change too much to continue.Welliver et al., 26 Welliver insisted that he was uninterested in trying to copy the exact colors of objects, desiring instead to find \\"a color that makes it look like it is, again, surrounded by air.\\"Welliver et al., 22‚Äì23 He often painted out of doors in winter, and enjoyed the crystal quality of the air and luminosity created by light reflecting off snow, but acknowledged that the process was not easy: > Painting outside in winter is not a macho thing to do. It's more difficult > than that. To paint outside in the winter is painful. It hurts your hands, > it hurts your feet, it hurts your ears. Painting is difficult. The paint is > rigid, it's stiff, it doesn't move easily. But sometimes there are things > you want and that's the only way you get them.Welliver et al., 23 Welliver later expanded some of the outdoor studies into large paintings in the studio, painting 4 to 7 hours a day,Welliver et al., 26 meticulously starting the canvases in the upper left-hand corner and finishing in the lower right. If the finished paintings were vibrantly painted, containing \\"an emotional intensity that goes beyond the ordinary limits of realism\\",Robert Hughes, quoted in the Washington Post. they also tended to be emotionally somber. Welliver died of pneumonia in Belfast, Maine, near his home in Lincolnville, . He was survived by his wife, Mimi Welliver. Welliver's works are represented in many museums, among them the Metropolitan Museum of Art, Museum of Modern Art, Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art and the Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden. Personal life Welliver's personal life was marked by tragedy. In 1975, he lost his home, studio, and all the art therein to a fire. In 1976, a daughter died, followed soon thereafter by the death of his second wife. In 1991, his son Eli was killed, and a second son, Silas, died. Of his surviving children, one is the actor Titus Welliver, and another is Ethan Welliver. Controversy In January 2018, The Pennsylvania Gazette, the University of Pennsylvania's alumni magazine, published an op-ed from a Penn graduate that described several encounters with Neil Welliver as he leveraged his position as chair of the university's Department of Fine Arts to sexually harass students. The letter details a period of sexual harassment and unwanted sexual advances during the student's matriculation at Penn, and noted that Welliver was known on campus as the \\"Silver Fox\\". The current Dean of the University of Pennsylvania School of Design, Frederick Steiner, published a response that offered support to the op-ed and asked other readers to come forward with similar stories.

Concept The Institute drives innovation across Europe by integrating business, education and research organisations to collaborate and find solutions to pressing global challenges. The EIT support the development of dynamic, long-term pan-European partnerships among leading companies, research labs and universities. These are called EIT Innovation Communities (Knowledge and Innovation Communities ‚Äì KICs) and each is dedicated to finding solutions to a specific global challenge. By creating opportunities for innovators and entrepreneurs across Europe, the EIT creates jobs and delivers sustainable economic growth for Europe. Together with its leading partners, the EIT and its Innovation Communities offer a wide range of innovation and entrepreneurship activities: education courses that combine technical and entrepreneurial skills, tailored business creation and acceleration services and innovation driven research projects. EIT Innovation Communities The EIT's Innovation Communities (Knowledge and Innovation Communities ‚Äì KICs) bring together businesses (industry and SMEs), research centres and universities as partners. They allow: * innovative products and services to be developed and launched on the market * new companies to be started and existing ones to be scale * a new generation of entrepreneurs to be trained There are currently eight Innovation Communities and each focuses on a different societal challenge: * EIT Climate- KIC: Innovation for climate action * EIT Digital: For a strong, digital Europe * EIT Food: Addressing sustainable supply chains from resources to consumers * EIT Health: Together for healthy lives in Europe * EIT InnoEnergy: Pioneering change in sustainable energy * EIT Manufacturing: Leading manufacturing is Made by Europe * EIT RawMaterials: Developing raw materials into a major strength for Europe * EIT Urban Mobility: Smart, green and integrated transport Each of the EIT Innovation Communities operates in Innovation Hubs. These hubs are spread across the EU to increase the impact of the EIT's activities. There are currently 50+ innovation hubs across Europe that include co-location centres, where education, research and business meet and interact.

In January 2014, the EIT became part of Horizon 2020, the EU Framework Programme for Research and Innovation 2014‚Äì2020. Since then the EIT Community has grown to eight Innovation Communities:EIT Health and EIT Raw Materials ‚Äì 2014; EIT Food ‚Äì 2016; EIT Manufacturing and EIT Urban Mobility ‚Äì 2018. In May 2018, the European Commission put forward its proposal for Horizon Europe, the next research and innovation framework programme for 2021‚Äì2027. It is proposed that the EIT will be part of Pillar 3 ‚Äì Open Innovation. Funding An initial budget of ‚Ç¨308.7 million has helped launch and will continue to support the EIT network during the 2008‚Äì2013 period. The EIT Strategic Innovation Agenda and the EIT's amended regulation, adopted by the European parliament and Council in December 2013, define the framework of the EIT's operations from 2014 to 2020. The strategy proposed a budget of EUR 2.4 billion within Horizon 2020. The annual grant to the Knowledge and Innovation Communities is allocated on a competitive basis and may not exceed 25% of the global expenditure of the Innovation Communities. The remainder of the Innovation Communities' budget must be raised from other sources of financing. Organization=Governing Board The EIT Governing Board is the principal governing body, entrusted with the strategic leadership of the Institute and the overall direction of the operational activities implemented by the EIT Headquarters. It is independent and autonomous in its decision- making and is responsible for the selection, evaluation and support of the EIT Innovation Communities. The EIT Governing Board has 12 members as well as one independent observer from the European Commission. Headquarters The EIT Headquarters\\"EIT Headquarters\\" are located in Budapest, Hungary, in the 11th district's Neumann Janos utca (Infopark, Budapest Science park).

At intervals there is a projection in the fence line, this is to allow those guards inside to get a better view along the outside of the fence. Fort Halstead is a research site of Dstl, an executive agency of the UK Ministry of Defence. It is situated on the crest of the Kentish North Downs, overlooking the town of Sevenoaks, southeast of London. Originally constructed in 1892 as part of a ring of fortresses around London, Fort Halstead was to be manned by volunteers in the event of a crisis. The base became home to the Projectile Development Establishment, the Ministry of Supply and later was the headquarters of the Royal Armament Research and Development Establishment (RARDE). Design and construction Fort Halstead formed a part of the London Defence Positions, a scheme devised by Lieutenant General Sir Edward Bruce Hamley and implemented by the Secretary of State for War, Edward Stanhope, who announced the plan to Parliament in 1889. The scheme envisaged a line of entrenchments which would be dug in the event of war to protect the southern and eastern approaches to the capital. Supporting these were to be thirteen simple forts, known as \\"Mobilisation Centres\\", which would contain the tools, stores and ammunition for the men of the Volunteer Force, who were tasked with digging the entrenchments and manning them against any invaders. Putting these plans into action in 1890, the War Office purchased land at Halstead, Kent, on high ground near the town of Sevenoaks. Delayed by a shortage of funds, the polygonal fort was constructed between 1895 and 1897; it featured vaulted barrack casemates on the west side and a magazine on the east. An earthen rampart with positions for light field artillery pieces and machine guns was surrounded by a ditch with a concrete revetment on the scarp face. A cottage was built for a caretaker, who was responsible for maintenance and security in peacetime. History as a defensive work The growing superiority of the Royal Navy resulted in the reduced likelihood of an invasion and the London Defence Scheme was officially abandoned in March 1906. Many of the Mobilisation Centres were quickly sold; however, Fort Halstead and a few others were retained, perhaps to facilitate the dispersal of the stores removed from the other sites. After the outbreak of the First World War, the London Defence Scheme was revived and many of the planned entrenchments were actually dug to form an inland stop line. Fort Halstead seems to have reverted to its intended role at this time; in 1915, a laboratory was built inside the fort for the inspection of ammunition. In 1921, the fort was sold to a retired colonel, who took up residence in the laboratory and let out the cottages. The rest of the site was used as a campsite for the Territorial Army, Boy Scouts, Girl Guides, and accommodation refugees. Rocket research In 1938, Fort Halstead became the home of the Projectile Development Establishment, which was continuing work on solid fuelled rockets that had started at Woolwich two years earlier. Under the direction of Dr Alwyn Crow, work was mainly on rockets that could be used as anti-aircraft weapons. In connection with this research, over eighty new buildings were constructed in and around the fort. The work at Halstead resulted in the 7-inch Unrotated Projectile used on ships of the Royal Navy, and a 3-inch version that was operated by the British Army in hundreds of Z Batteries for the air defence of the United Kingdom. Further developments were the RP-3 air-to-surface anti-tank rocket and the Mattress and Land Mattress surface-to-surface bombardment systems.Bishop, Chris (2002), The Encyclopedia of Weapons of World War II, Metrobooks, (p. 176) History of RARDE Two departments, the \\"Research Department\\" and the \\"Design Department\\", were established in 1922 at Woolwich Arsenal. During the Second World War, the Design Department moved to Fort Halstead, followed by the Research Department. It is believed that Britain's development of the atomic bomb, hidden under the name High Explosive Research (\\"HER\\") was initially based at Fort Halstead, where the first atomic bomb was developed under the directorship of William George Penney, who had been appointed Chief Superintendent Armament Research (\\"CSAR\\", called \\"Caesar\\") by C. P. Snow. Operation Hurricane saw the bomb conveyed by frigate to Australia and successfully exploded in the Montebello Islands. In 1950, it is thought that the \\"HER\\" research was moved to a new site at Atomic Weapons Establishment, Aldermaston in Berkshire. In 1955, the two departments were merged to give the Armament Research and Development Establishment (ARDE), which was granted the title \\"Royal\\" in February 1962.\\"Royal\\" Armament Research and Development Establishment In the 1980s, RARDE was amalgamated with the Military Vehicles and Engineering Establishment (MVEE) ‚Äì formerly the Fighting Vehicles Research and Development Establishment (FVRDE) ‚Äì with sites at Chertsey and Christchurch, and the Propellants, Explosives and Rocket Motor Establishment based at Waltham Abbey and Westcott. Following the December 1988 Lockerbie bombing, forensic experts from RARDE's explosives laboratory examined material recovered from the crash scene, and subsequently testified as expert witnesses at the Pan Am Flight 103 bombing trial. RARDE was home to a number of military simulation and war game projects, mainly aimed as assessing the effectiveness of future defence equipment procurement. After Iraq's invasion of Kuwait and throughout the latter half of 1990, a series of computerised war games were conducted at RARDE in preparation for Operation Granby, Britain's contribution to the Gulf War. In 2017, scientists from the Forensic Explosives Laboratory at Fort Halstead examined the wreckage of the aircraft from the 2010 Polish Air Force Tu-154 crash, for traces of explosives, after being engaged by the Polish government.Farmer, Ben; Day, Matthew (27 February 2017). \\"MoD experts to investigate Polish leader's plane crash blamed on 'Russian aggression'\\".

It was an executive Agency of the Ministry of Defence. Four years later, when DRA was itself merged to form the Defence Evaluation and Research Agency (DERA), the forensic explosives laboratory came under media and scientific scrutiny. In 1996, amid allegations that contaminated equipment had been used in the testing of forensic evidence, an inquiry was set up under Professor Brian Caddy of Strathclyde University to investigate the laboratory's alleged shortcomings. Dstl and QinetiQ Following the split of DERA in 2001 into QinetiQ and Dstl, the Fort Halstead site was retained by QinetiQ who leased part of the site back to Dstl. Its most recent principal functions have been research, test, evaluation and forensic analysis into explosives, and the site's explosives laboratory was again used in the investigation following the attempted 21 July 2005 London bombings. The facility has been the largest employer in the Sevenoaks district, with 1,300 personnel working on the site in 2000. In March 2006, QinetiQ sold the Fort Halstead site to Armstrong Kent LLP for an undisclosed sum, remaining on-site as a tenant. On 17 June 2011 Dstl announced that its facilities at Fort Halstead are to close following a review of operations at the site. Current plans are for a mix-used regeneration of the Fort Halstead Site, with 700 new homes and a business campus, including QinetiQ.

She was the mother of King Christian IV of Denmark. She was Regent of Schleswig-Holstein 1590‚Äì1594. Dansk Kvindebiografisk Leksikon Early life Born in Wismar, she was the daughter of Duke Ulrich III of Mecklenburg-G√ºstrow and Princess Elizabeth of Denmark (a daughter of Frederick I and Sophie of Pomerania). Through her father, a grandson of Elizabeth of Oldenburg, she descended from King John of Denmark. Like Ulrich, she had a great love of knowledge. Later, she would be known as one of the most learned Queens of the time. Queen At the age of fourteen Sophie, on 20 July 1572, married Frederick II of Denmark in Copenhagen; he was thirty-eight. They were first half-cousins, through their grandfather, Frederick I, King of Denmark and Norway. They met at Nyk√∏bing Castle, when it had been arranged for the king to meet with Margaret of Pomerania. She was brought to Denmark by Sophie's parents, who decided to also bring their own daughter.. Sophie found favour with the king, who betrothed himself to her, and married her six months later. King Frederick had been in love with the noblewoman Anne Corfitzdatter Hardenberg for many years, but was unable to marry her due to her being a noblewoman, not a princess, the opposition of the Danish Privy Council as well as eventually Anne herself. Despite the age difference between Sophie and Frederick, the marriage was described as harmonious. Queen Sophie was a loving mother, nursing her children personally during their illnesses. When Frederick was sick with malaria in 1575, she personally nursed him and wrote many worried letters to her father about his progress. King Frederick was well-known for being fond of drinking and hunting, but he was a loving spouse to Sophie, writing off her with great fondness in his personal diary (where he kept careful track of where she and their children were in the country) and there is no evidence of extramarital affairs on the part of either spouse. Their marriage is described as having been harmonious. All of their children were sent to live with her parents in Mecklenburg for the first years of their lives, with the possible exception of the last son, Hans, as it was the belief at the time that the parents would indulge their children too much. She showed a keen interest in science and visited the astronomer Tycho Brahe. She was also interested in the old songs of folklore. She proved a diligent matchmaker. Her daughter, Anne of Denmark, married James VI of Scotland and become queen consort in 1589. She arranged the marriage against the will of the Council. When James VI came to Denmark she gave him a present of 10,000 dalers.Miles Kerr-Peterson & Michael Pearce, 'James VI's English Subsidy and Danish Dowry Accounts, 1588-1596', Scottish History Society Miscellany XVI (Woodbridge, 2020), p. 35. Regency Queen Sophie had no political power during the lifetime of her spouse. When her underage son Christian IV became king in 1588, she was given no place in the regency council in Denmark itself. From 1590, however, she acted as regent for the duchies of Schleswig-Holstein for her son. She organised a grand funeral for her spouse, arranged for the dowries for her daughters and for her own allowance, all independently and against the will of the council. She engaged in a power struggle with the regents of Denmark and with the Council of State, which had Christian declared of age in 1593. She wished the duchies to be divided between her younger sons, which caused a conflict. Sophie only gave up her position the following year, 1594. As such, she came into conflict with the government, which exiled her to the Palace of Nyk√∏bing Slot on the island of Falster. She spent her time there in the study of chemistry, astronomy and other sciences. She also renovated Nyk√∏bing Slot. Later life The Dowager Queen Sophie managed her estates in Lolland-Falster so well that her son could borrow money from her on several occasions for his wars. She also engaged in large-scale trade and in money- lending. She often visited Mecklenburg, and attended her daughter's wedding in Dresden in 1602. In 1603 she became involved in an inheritance dispute with her uncle, which remained unsolved at his death in 1610. In 1608, she managed to soften the punishment of Rigborg Brockenhuus, and in 1628, she was one of the influential people who prevented her son from having her grandson's lover, Anne Lykke, accused of witchcraft. Sophie died in Nyk√∏bing Falster at the age of seventy-four as the richest woman in Northern Europe.

From 1965 to 1980, the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) investigated Zalman Shapiro, the company's president, over the loss of of highly enriched uranium. The Atomic Energy Commission, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA), other government agencies, and inquiring reporters conducted similar investigations, and no charges were ever filed. A General Accounting Office study of the investigations declassified in May 2010 stated \\"We believe a timely, concerted effort on the part of these three agencies would have greatly aided and possibly solved the NUMEC diversion questions, if they desired to do so.\\" In February 1976 the CIA briefed senior staff at the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) about the matter, stating that the CIA believed the missing highly enriched uranium went to Israel. The NRC informed the White House, leading to President-elect Carter being briefed about the investigation. Carter asked for an assessment by his National Security Advisor, whose staff concluded \\"The CIA case is persuasive, though not conclusive.\\" Some remain convinced that Israel received or more of highly enriched uranium from NUMEC, particularly given the visit of Rafi Eitan, later revealed as an Israeli spy and who was later involved in the Jonathan Pollard incident. In June 1986, analyst Anthony Cordesman told United Press International: > There is no conceivable reason for Eitan to have gone [to the Apollo plant] > but for the nuclear material.‚Äù In his 1991 book, The Samson Option, Seymour Hersh concluded that Shapiro did not divert any uranium; rather \\"it ended up in the air and water of the city of Apollo as well as in the ducts, tubes, and floors of the NUMEC plant.\\" He also wrote that Shapiro's meetings with senior Israeli officials in his home were related to protecting the water supply in Israel rather than any diversion of nuclear material or information. A later investigation was conducted by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (successor to the AEC) regarding an additional of uranium that was found to be missing between 1974 and 1976, after the plant had been purchased by Babcock & Wilcox and Shapiro was no longer associated with the company. That investigation found that more than of it could be accounted for by what was called \\"previously unidentified and undocumented loss mechanisms\\", including \\"contamination of workers' clothes, losses from scrubber systems, material embedded in the flooring, and residual deposits in the processing equipment.\\" Hersh further quoted one of the main investigators, Carl Duckett, as saying \\"I know of nothing at all to indicate that Shapiro was guilty.\\" In 1993, Glenn T. Seaborg, former head of the Atomic Energy Commission wrote a book, The Atomic Energy Commission under Nixon, Adjusting to Troubled Times which devoted a chapter to Shapiro and NUMEC, the last sentence of which states: > Distinguished as Shapiro's career has been, one cannot but wonder whether it > might not have been even more illustrious had these unjust charges not been > leveled against him.Glenn T. Seaborg, The Atomic Energy Commission under > Nixon:Adjusting to Troubled Times, 1993, St. Martin's Press Later U.S. Department of Energy records show that NUMEC had the largest highly enriched uranium inventory loss of all U.S. commercial sites, with a inventory loss before 1968, and thereafter. At the prompting of Zalman Shapiro's lawyer, senator Arlen Specter asked the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) to clear him of any suspicion of diversion in August 2009. The NRC refused, stating: > NRC found no documents that provided specific evidence that the diversion of > nuclear materials occurred. However, consistent with previous Commission > statements, NRC does not have information that would allow it to > unequivocally conclude that nuclear material was not diverted from the site, > nor that all previously unaccounted for material was accounted for during > the decommissioning of the site. In 2014, further documents about the investigation were declassified, though still heavily redacted. The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers is overseeing a cleanup of contaminated land at the site of NUMEC's waste disposal, currently scheduled to be completed in 2015.Scott C. Johnson, What Lies Beneath, Foreign Policy, 2015/03/23 In popular culture Dominique LaPierre and Larry Collins mentioned this incident as part of a lengthy and detailed backstory to Israel's nuclear arsenal and its aborted nuclear strike against Libya in The Fifth Horseman. The film states that at least half of the uranium, according to the CIA, made it to Israel.Page 131, E-book version. Collins, Larry and LaPierre, Dominique. The Fifth Horseman.

Biography Janicki was born in Januszkowo, a village near ≈ªnin, Poland, to a peasant family. He first went to an elementary school in ≈ªnin, then to the Lubra≈Ñski Academy in Pozna≈Ñ where he studied Greek, Latin and Ancient literature. In 1536, he became secretary to Gniezno archbishop Andrzej Krzycki, and met such scholars as Jan Dantyszek (), Stanis≈Çaw Hozjusz (). At that time he wrote several elegies such as Ad Andream Cricium, De Cricio Cracovia eunte, and Vitae archaepiscoporum Gnesnensium for his patron. After Archbishop Krzycki died, Janicki worked under patronage of the count Piotr Kmita and wrote Querella Reipublicae Regni Poloniae i Ad Polonos proceras. In 1538 Count Sobie≈Ñski sponsored his studies in Padua, where he met Piotr Myszkowski, Filip Padniewski and Andrzej Zebrzydowski. 22 July 1540 graduated from philosophy with designation of a doctor. Pope Paul III awarded him with the title of poeta laureatus. During his travel to Italy he fell ill with hydrops and soon returned to Poland. Not wanting to work for count Kmita, he devoted himself to work as a parson in Go≈Çaczewy near Olkusz. In 1541 he wrote a collection of elegies titled \\"Tristium liber\\" in which he foresaw his death, especially Elegy VII De se ipso ad posteritatem (About myself to posterity). Janicki died in January 1543; his last work, Epithalamium Serenissimo Regi Poloniae, Sigismundo Augusto, was found by his heirs Jan Antonin and Augustinus Rotundus who decided to publish it.Harold B. Segel: Renaissance Culture in Poland: The Rise of Humanism, 1470‚Äì1543 Janicki, a humanist and an expert on the classics, mastered his poetic technique at the highest possible level. At the same time, however, he approached the topics originally, which is clearly seen in the fragments dedicated to his native nature, the past and the present of Poland. The personal tone of his poetry was a new element in Polish poetry. He was the first poet to write so much about himself and his relatives, about the dignity and pride of the poet. Works Janicki was above all a writer of lyric verse, which can be proved by the contents of the 1542 volume. Inspired by Ovid, he created elegies developing personal motifs, sometimes giving topographical and personal details. Among these poems there is an autobiographical elegy De se ipso ad posteritatem (\\"On Myself for Posterity\\"), which is sometimes seen as a paraphrase of one of the elegies of the Roman master (Tristia IV, 10). With the title of his collection of poems Tristium Liber, the poet clearly refers to Ovid‚Äôs elegies written in exile, Tristia. Apart from elegies, epigrams were the most common genre in the poet‚Äôs writing. Janicjusz expressed himself in various kinds of this genre: epitaphs, stemmata (poems on coats of arms) and in imagery poems similar to emblematic compositions. Using the examples of Martial, Propertius and Catullus, he undertook various erotic, laudatory, humorous and satirical motifs. There are two series of his epigrams: Vitae archiepiscoporum Gnesnensium and Vitae regum Polonorum. The first consists of 43 poems presenting the lives of the Gniezno archbishops, and was created owing to archbishop Krzycki. The characteristics of the clerical dignitaries are generally positive, however, there is some criticism or humorous overtones. The second series consists of 44 biograms of legendary (starting with Lech I) and historic rulers of Poland (starting with Mieszko I), this collection was initiated by Kmita. Querela Reipublicae Regni Poloniae is of a completely different character. Poem, which refers to the events of the nobles‚Äô rebellion known as the Chicken War, through the words of personified Poland, the artist complains about the nobility, magnates especially, their internal quarrels and their private interests. A wedding song, Epithalamium Serenissimo Regi Poloniae, Sigismundo Augusto, written for the planned marriage of King Zygmunt August and El≈ºbieta, a daughter of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor who was then King of the Bohemia and of Hungary, was the last work of Janicjusz. It contains two poems comprising over 500 verses as a whole. The first one, addressed to the King Zygmunt I the Old, was invented as a praise of the monarch and his military achievements among other things. The second, is a true wedding song and sings the praises of the bride and the groom.

The Muni Meter system was introduced broadly in 2009, following a period of experimentation that began in 1999. Muni Meters are located on streets adjacent to a group of parking spots, with no designated striping that separates spots. A driver parks their car, pays at the Muni Meter (using coins, credit cards, or prepaid parking cards), and takes a receipt provided by the Meter. They then display that receipt on their vehicle's dashboard. The system reduces the number of individual meter devices required, increases the number of parking spots available (by allowing as many cars to park as can fit) and, some argue, reduces losses due to unused time left on meters (which may then be reused by subsequent parkers).

Features  The original Nord Electro has two sections. One was a sample- player intended for electric pianos, although samples of acoustic grand and upright pianos are also available. The sample libraries are exchangeable, and Clavia has made several samples libraries available for free for Nord Electro owners. The second section is a digital emulation of electronic organs. This is not sample based, but instead generated by the digital modelling of several types of organs. Unlike many other keyboards that feature tonewheel organ emulation, the drawbars of the Nord Electro are represented by LED bar graphs and up/down buttons instead of the traditional mechanical drawbars. The Electro 3 added a sample player which offered the ability to play a wider range of sounds, notably including those from the Mellotron and Chamberlin libraries. There is an effect section that emulates popular \\"stomp box\\" effect pedals from the '70s and amplifiers including the famous Leslie rotary speaker cabinet. These can be applied to piano, organ or samples. Reverb and Delay effects are also available. As with other Clavia products, it is distinctive for its red color. Unlike the Clavia Nord Stage, earlier models could only play one instrument at a time, although a second keyboard could be attached via MIDI as an additional organ manual. The Electro 5 allows for a maximum of two sound sources to be used simultaneously in layered or split-keyboard configuration while the Electro 6 allows for a maximum of three sound sources (organ+piano+sample).  Models  The original Nord Electro was released in 2001. It contained emulations of a Hammond B3 as well as samples of a Rhodes Stage 73, a Wurlitzer electric piano, a Hohner Clavinet and an acoustic grand piano. The Electro was released in 61- and 73-key versions as well as a rack version, which featured all the same controls as the keyboard versions. In 2002, the Nord Electro 2 was released. It contained new and updated software, but the electronics were identical to the original Electro, which permitted the original Electro to be updated to Electro 2 functionality through a software update. Like the original Electro, the Electro 2 was also released in 61- and 73-key versions as well as a rack version. In 2009 the Nord Electro 3 was released. It expanded the functionality of the Nord Electro 2 with Farfisa and Vox organ emulations as well as improved B3 emulation and more effects. It also includes samples from the Mellotron library and support for the entire Nord Sample Library. It was initially released only in 61- and 73-key semi- weighted versions. In 2011 the Nord Electro 3HP (Hammer Portable) was released, which replaces the organ-style semi-weighted \\"waterfall\\" keys of the original models with a light-weight 73-key hammer-action keyboard. In 2012 the Nord Electro 4D was released, which replaces the digital organ drawbars of prior models with physical drawbar sliders and has updated Hammond B3 emulation. It has a 61-key organ-style semi-weighted \\"waterfall\\" keyboard. Later in 2012 the Nord Electro 4 HP and 4 SW were released. They have the same features as the Electro 4D, except with the digital drawbars of the Electro 3 and earlier, increased sample memory, and 73-key keyboards like the Electro 3 HP and SW. On January 16, 2015 Clavia announced the Nord Electro 5 on their website.

Late Archaic Settlement Models in the Middle Ohio Valley: A Perspective From Big Bone Lick, Kentucky. Ph.D. dissertation, Department of Anthropology, University of Kentucky, Lexington. Maple Creek phase sites within the Ohio River Valley proper include the Maple Creek site, at the confluence of Maple Creek and the Ohio River in Clermont County, and Mexico Bottoms, in the Ohio River Bottoms of Indiana. Both are described by Kent Vickery as regional base camps with summer and fall occupations.*Vickery, Kent D. 1976. An Approach to Inferring Archaeological Site Variability. Ph.D. dissertation, Department of Anthropology, Indiana University, Bloomington. Sites have also been found further east than Cincinnati, along the Ohio River. The Mabel Hall site, on the Ohio River floodplain, in Lawrence County, Ohio, is another example of a site that bears affinities to the Maple Creek phase, although it is considerably east of the area that is generally identified with the phase. It has a Late Archaic-Early Woodland period occupation with a minor Late Woodland component. Late Archaic stemmed points, some of which are similar to McWhinney Heavy Stemmed points, are present at this site, as well as Early Woodland Fayette Thick ceramics. The Davisson Farm site in Lawrence County has a Maple Creek component and a Late Archaic component that Purtill describes as Laurentian Archaic. Fewer cultural diagnostics are attributable to upland populations far from the major river valleys. However, upland Maple Creek culture sites are known at the Houpt Site,Duerksen, Ken and John F.

A flame ionization detector (FID) is a scientific instrument that measures analytes in a gas stream. It is frequently used as a detector in gas chromatography. The measurement of ion per unit time make this a mass sensitive instrument. Standalone FIDs can also be used in applications such as landfill gas monitoring, fugitive emissions monitoring and internal combustion engine emissions measurement in stationary or portable instruments. History The first flame ionization detectors were developed simultaneously and independently in 1957 by McWilliam and Dewar at Imperial Chemical Industries of Australia and New Zealand (ICIANZ, see Orica history) Central Research Laboratory, Ascot Vale, Melbourne, Australia.Scott, R. P. W., 1957, Vapour Phase Chromatography, Ed. D. H. Desty (London: Butterworths), p. 131. and by Harley and Pretorius at the University of Pretoria in Pretoria, South Africa. In 1959, Perkin Elmer Corp. included a flame ionization detector in its Vapor Fractometer. Operating principle The operation of the FID is based on the detection of ions formed during combustion of organic compounds in a hydrogen flame. The generation of these ions is proportional to the concentration of organic species in the sample gas stream. FID measurements are usually reported as \\"as methane\\", meaning as the quantity of methane which would produce the same response. Hydrocarbons generally have molar response factors that are equal to the number of carbon atoms in their molecule, while oxygenates and other species that contain heteroatoms tend to have a lower response factor. Carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide are not detectable by FID. FID measurements are often labelled \\"total hydrocarbons\\" or \\"total hydrocarbon content\\" (THC), although a more accurate name would be \\"total volatile hydrocarbon content\\" (TVHC), as hydrocarbons which have condensed out are not detected, even though they are important for e.g. safety when handling compressed oxygen. To detect these ions, two electrodes are used to provide a potential difference. The positive electrode doubles as the nozzle head where the flame is produced. The other, negative electrode is positioned above the flame. When first designed, the negative electrode was either tear-drop shaped or angular piece of platinum. Today, the design has been modified into a tubular electrode, commonly referred to as a collector plate. The ions thus are attracted to the collector plate and upon hitting the plate, induce a current. This current is measured with a high-impedance picoammeter and fed into an integrator. The manner in which the final data is displayed is based on the computer and software. In general, a graph is displayed that has time on the x-axis and total ion on the y-axis. The current measured corresponds roughly to the proportion of reduced carbon atoms in the flame. Specifically how the ions are produced is not necessarily understood, but the response of the detector is determined by the number of carbon atoms (ions) hitting the detector per unit time. This makes the detector sensitive to the mass rather than the concentration, which is useful because the response of the detector is not greatly affected by changes in the carrier gas flow rate. Description FID Schematic: A) Capillary tube; B) Platinum jet; C) Hydrogen; D) Air; E) Flame; F) Ions; G) Collector; H) Coaxial cable to analog- to-digital converter; J) Gas outlet The design of the flame ionization detector varies from manufacturer to manufacturer, but the principles are the same. Most commonly, the FID is attached to a gas chromatography system. The eluent exits the gas chromatography column (A) and enters the FID detector‚Äôs oven (B). The oven is needed to make sure that as soon as the eluent exits the column, it does not come out of the gaseous phase and deposit on the interface between the column and FID. This deposition would result in loss of eluent and errors in detection. As the eluent travels up the FID, it is first mixed with the hydrogen fuel (C) and then with the oxidant (D). The eluent/fuel/oxidant mixture continues to travel up to the nozzle head where a positive bias voltage exists. This positive bias helps to repel the reduced carbon ions created by the flame (E) pyrolyzing the eluent. The ions (F) are repelled up toward the collector plates (G) which are connected to a very sensitive ammeter, which detects the ions hitting the plates, then feeds that signal to an amplifier, integrator, and display system(H). The products of the flame are finally vented out of the detector through the exhaust port (J). Advantages and disadvantages=Advantages Flame ionization detectors are used very widely in gas chromatography because of a number of advantages. *Cost: Flame ionization detectors are relatively inexpensive to acquire and operate. *Low maintenance requirements: Apart from cleaning or replacing the FID jet, these detectors require little maintenance. *Rugged construction: FIDs are relatively resistant to misuse. *Linearity and detection ranges: FIDs can measure organic substance concentration at very low (10‚àí13 g/s) and very high levels, having a linear response range of 107 g/s. Disadvantages Flame ionization detectors cannot detect inorganic substances and some highly oxygenated or functionalized species like infrared and laser technology can. In some systems, CO and CO2 can be detected in the FID using a methanizer, which is a bed of Ni catalyst that reduces CO and CO2 to methane, which can be in turn detected by the FID. The methanizer is limited by its inability to reduce compounds other than CO and CO2 and its tendency to be poisoned by a number of chemicals commonly found in gas chromatography effluents. Another important disadvantage is that the FID flame oxidizes all oxidizable compounds that pass through it; all hydrocarbons and oxygenates are oxidized to carbon dioxide and water and other heteroatoms are oxidized according to thermodynamics. For this reason, FIDs tend to be the last in a detector train and also cannot be used for preparatory work. Alternative solution An improvement to the methanizer is the Polyarc reactor, which is a sequential reactor that oxidizes compounds before reducing them to methane. This method can be used to improve the response of the FID and allow for the detection of many more carbon-containing compounds. The complete conversion of compounds to methane and the now equivalent response in the detector also eliminates the need for calibrations and standards because response factors are all equivalent to those of methane. This allows for the rapid analysis of complex mixtures that contain molecules where standards are not available.

During WWII the station became important for the British and the Norwegian information services. On October 20, 1973, Family Stations, Inc., acquired the station to be part of its Family Radio network and changed the call letters to WYFR. Family Stations eventually progressively moved the transmitters to their current site in Okeechobee, Florida. The transmitter site in Scituate continued to operate until November 16, 1979 when it was switched off for the last time. History On October 15, 1927, Walter Lemmon, a radio inventor, was granted the first shortwave radio license in the United States and began experimental shortwave station W1XAL in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1935, the station began transmitting non-commercial, educational, and cultural programs. Supported by charitable institutions it was a not run for profit. Four days after Britain and France declared war on Germany, on September 7, 1939, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) assigned call letters WRUL (for World Radio University Listeners) to the station. As it had a large worldwide listening audience, which regularly corresponded with the station and a high power transmitter it was seen by British Security Co-ordination (BSC), a covert organization that the British Secret Intelligence Service established in New York City as a vehicle for conducting political warfare on behalf of the British. The station was transmitting mostly in English so BSC provided through third parties the finance, translators, and foreign language announcers to produce high-quality programming in other languages. BSC also provided the material to be broadcast and so by 1941 WRUL had become unknowingly an arm of the BSC though outwardly independent and believing itself to be so.The Secret History of British Intelligence in the Americas, 1940-1945 p60-62 From 1939 to 1942, WRUL broadcast radio lectures to Europe and South America in eight languages, and also in the United States over an informal network of over 300 stations, including WNYC in New York City. Following the establishment of what would become the OSS, American propaganda was provided to the station, but it was not until the entry of the US into the war that BSC handed over control. Like all United States shortwave stations, in November 1942 the U.S. government leased WRUL for further wartime propaganda broadcasts. WRUL was allowed to resume partial independent programming in 1947, and full independent programming in 1954. From September 1940 and throughout WWII the Norwegian government had a daily half hour transmission in Norwegian for the sailors in the Norwegian commercial fleet. One broadcaster was the photojournalist Kari Berggrav. Metromedia bought the station in 1960. In June 1962, International Educational Broadcasting Corporation (now Bonneville International), owned by The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, bought WRUL. The station adopted the slogan \\"Radio New York Worldwide\\" and used studios in New York City and an adult contemporary format, with ABC Radio or CBS Radio hourly and half-hour newscasts and from its sister station, WRFM. On-air staff from WRFM would also have separate shifts on WNYW. There were rumors that the station was being partially controlled by the Central Intelligence Agency to broadcast anti- communist propaganda. On June 1, 1966, WRUL changed its call letters to WNYW, which stood for Radio New York Worldwide. The station attempted to do some commercial programming, but there were few advertisers because it was difficult to estimate audience ratings for the wide geographical area that shortwave stations typically covered. In 1970, Bonneville offered to sell the station to the U.S. government for a token payment of one dollar, for use by the Voice of America, but no sale materialized. In 1974, Bonneville sold WNYW. The callsign was assigned to the Fox Broadcasting Company's flagship station, WNYW (formerly Metromedia station WNEW-TV and DuMont Television Network station WABD), in New York City.

Dan received his master's degree from MIT, where he was a member of the Tangible Media Group at the MIT Media Lab under the direction of Professor Hiroshi Ishii from 2001-2003. There he worked on the Actuated Workbench, a device that uses magnetic forces to move objects on a table around in two dimensions. Dan received his bachelor's degree from Carnegie Mellon University, where his research advisor was Randy Pausch; his Undergraduate Honors Thesis is titled \\"Techniques for Interactive Audience Participation\\".http://www.monzy.org/monzy-cv.pdf (Archived) From 1997‚Äì2001 he was a member of Stage 3 Research Group, based at Carnegie Mellon's Human-Computer Interaction Institute. There he worked on new techniques for interactive audience participation.  Nerdcore hip-hop  Monzy made his hip-hop debut with Drama in the PhD which called out his musical rival MC Plus+. It gained large popularity after being described as \\"the best fucking thing I've ever heard\\" by LiveJournal creator Brad Fitzpatrick.https://brad.livejournal.com/2116192.html It eventually made it into a Wired magazine article , and Monzy was interviewed for a segment on the German television program Taff. He was also mentioned in the February 2006 issue of EE Times, an academic and industry-oriented publication dedicated to issues in the field of Electrical Engineering. On January 10, 2006, Monzy performed at the DivX, Inc. booth of the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada, along with other nerdcore artists. With Karl Olson acting as a mediator, Monzy and MC Plus+ finally ended their rivalry and performed together on the same stage. * \\"Kill Dash Nine\\" (appears on Rhyme Torrents Vol.1 ) References External links  * Personal website (Archived) * Professional website (Archived) * Nerdcorehiphop.org website  Media coverage  *Zipern, Andrew. \\"At MIT, Making Fun of the Alma Mater\\" The New York Times December 3, 2001. *Newitz, Annalee. \\"Sex Studies at MIT\\" San Francisco Bay Guardian December 13, 2001. *Orlowski, Andrew. \\"WCs meet PCs: converged tech toilets show promise\\" The Register May 27, 2003. *Maxim Magazine \\"Streaming Video\\" Maxim Magazine August, 2003. * TechTV Hot Click TechTV October, 2003. * Andrews, Robert. \\"Rap Marketing Comes to Nerdcore.\\" Wired June 23, 2005. *Reed, Bryan. \\"Nerdcore Hip-Hop\\" The Daily Tarheel December 8, 2005. *Clendenin, Mike. \\"Geeksta Rappers Rhyme Tech Talk\\" EE Times February 13, 2006. * Nguyen, Thuy-Dzuong. \\"Nerdcore rap helps dorky losers spit mad game\\" Gonzaga Bulletin March 24, 2006. * Darling, Cary. \\"Beats and Geeks\\" The Fort Worth Star-Telegram February 18, 2007. * Silverberg, David. \\"Beats, Geeks, and Freaks\\" NOW Magazine April 26, 2007. * Neill, Huw. \\"Nerdcore for Life\\" Canvas Magazine April, 2007. * Miranda, Jeff. \\"Refrain of the Nerds\\" The Boston Globe November 4, 2007. * Ding, Mike \\"Only for the 'Nerdcore'\\" The Stanford Daily November 14, 2007 Category:American rappers Category:Living people Category:Nerdcore artists Category:Computer programmers Category:1979 births Category:Google employees Category:21st-century American rappers ","title":"Dan Maynes-Aminzade"},{"id":"4162481","title":"You Win My Love"},{"id":"4162489","title":"Mazda F3A transmission"},{"id":"4162490","text":"Faculty of Medicine of Memorial University of Newfoundland is located on the eastern edge of North America and is one of two medical schools in Atlantic Canada. It was founded in 1967 and is the academic core of health research in the province. The Faculty of Medicine includes the medical school, postgraduate residency training programs and graduate programs leading to a Masters, Doctoral or MD-PhD degree or to diplomas in Community Health, Clinical Epidemiology and Post-Secondary Studies (Health Professional Education). It is located in adjacent to the Health Sciences Centre on the northwest corner of the St. John's campus of Memorial University of Newfoundland, as well as many smaller sites in urban and rural areas throughout Newfoundland and Labradorand Atlantic Canada.  History  In 1966, Lord Russell Brain completed a Royal Commission on Health, which advised that a medical school was crucial for health care in the province of Newfoundland and Labrador. Several other reports ensued, all supporting the necessity of a medical school. The federal government's Health Resources Fund was also essential to the realization of a medical school for this province. In 1967, Premier Joseph R. Smallwood committed the government to a formal financial commitment. On Sept. 1, 1967, after an international search in Canada, England and the United States, the Faculty of Medicine became a reality with the appointment of Dr. Ian Rusted as the first dean of medicine. That same year, the university announced Dr. K. B. Roberts, born in London, England, as associate dean of medicine, a position that became effective full- time in 1968. Both Dr. Rusted and Dr. Roberts traveled throughout Canada and the United States examining the setup of various medical schools in order to design the most appropriate model for Memorial University and the General Hospital. The university announced two more appointments in the Faculty of Medicine in February 1968, and they too were heavily involved with the development of the school. Dr. William Marshall, born in London, England, but now living in New York, was appointed associate professor of immunology and director of Postgraduate Medical Education, effective June 1, 1968. Dr. A. M. House, professor of neurology and chief of staff at the St. John's General Hospital, was appointed director of Continuing Medical Education (CME). All four doctors tackled the job of further faculty recruitment. The first class graduated from Memorial's Faculty of Medicine in 1973.  Programs  Memorial's Faculty of Medicine is accredited by the Committee on Accreditation of Canadian Medical Schools (CACMS) of the Association of Faculties of Medicine of Canada (AFMC) and the Liaison Committee on Medical Education (LCME) of the Association of American Medical Colleges (AAMC). The Faculty of Medicine has 320 medical students and 250 postgraduate residents from all socio-economic backgrounds; nearly half come from rural areas. The faculty recently won the Keith Award for the seventh time for having the largest number of graduates practicing in a rural area 10 years after graduation. Memorial's average between 2007-17 was 45 per cent compared to the national average of 22 per cent. The four-year undergraduate medical program provides a comprehensive and integrated medical education. Teaching methods are diverse, but there is an emphasis on small group teaching. The size of the faculty and the student body facilitate a personalized learning environment. An integrated approach to the field of medicine is encouraged by a non-departmental administration system based on three divisions: Community Health and Humanities, BioMedical Sciences and the Clinical Sciences. The faculty's curriculum places particular emphasis on community and rural medicine learning environments, and patient contact starts early in a medical student's training. Memorial's medical graduates are sought after across Canada and in the U.S. and are recognized for their clinical maturity and good grounding in the basics. The faculty excels in clinical teaching, and has research expertise in specific areas of clinical specialties, community health, epidemiology, applied health and services research, and basic medical science including neurosciences, immunology, cardiovascular & renal physiology and human genetic research. Graduate programs include a wide range of programs and disciplines, including M.Sc., MPH, MHE, PhD and assorted diplomas in graduate fields.

Claudette caused significant flooding in eastern Texas and western Louisiana in July 1979\\\\. The third named storm of the 1979 Atlantic hurricane season, Claudette developed from a tropical wave located east of the Windward Islands on July 16\\\\. It gradually strengthened and was upgraded to a tropical storm on July 17 and crossed the northern Leeward Islands later that day. As it neared landfall in Puerto Rico early on July 18, upper-level winds weakened it back to a tropical depression. Claudette remained disorganized and the National Hurricane Center operationally reported that it degenerated back into a tropical wave after crossing Puerto Rico. Late on July 18, the depression struck Dominican Republic, emerged into the Caribbean Sea on the following day. Claudette struck western Cuba on July 21, shortly before reaching the Gulf of Mexico and \\"regenerating\\" into a tropical cyclone. By July 23, Claudette regained tropical storm intensity and turned northward toward the Gulf Coast of the United States. The storm made landfall near the Texas-Louisiana border late on July 23 as a moderately strong tropical storm. It weakened slowly and drifted over land, lasting until dissipation in West Virginia on July 29\\\\. In the Lesser Antilles, the storm brought heavy rainfall and gusty winds to several islands. Minor flooding occurred in Guadeloupe and Saint Croix. Rainfall exceeding in some areas of Puerto Rico led to widespread agricultural damage, flooded homes and streets, and one fatality; losses were estimated at $750,000 (1979 USD). Despite its passage over Hispaniola and Cuba, impact in both regions is unknown. Claudette brought record-breaking rainfall to eastern Texas. In Alvin, of rain fell in one day, which at one point was the record 24‚Äëhour precipitation amount for any location in the United States. Significant coastal flooding and up to of rainfall was reported in Louisiana. Overall, Claudette was responsible for two deaths and $400 million (1979 USD) in damage. Meteorological history A tropical wave, the strongest of the season at mid-tropospheric levels, emerged into the Atlantic in the second week of July. In Dakar, Senegal, winds were as high as 100 mph (155 km/h) in the level of the atmosphere. The wave tracked westward and slowly organized. It is estimated that a tropical depression developed after a surface circulation became evident at 1200 UTC on July 16. Four hours later, the National Hurricane Center initiated advisories on Tropical Depression Five, which was centered about east of Guadeloupe. The depression moved west-northwestward and approached the northern Lesser Antilles. On July 17, an Air Force reconnaissance aircraft flight reported sustained winds of . As a result, the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Claudette later that day. As the storm moved westward, it encountered wind shear, weakening it back to depression status when it hit Puerto Rico. Claudette moved across islands of Hispaniola and Cuba as a tropical depression before reforming in the Gulf of Mexico on July 21. Fluctuating between tropical depression and tropical storm status, the disorganized storm drifted slowly westward before making landfall along the Texas-Louisiana border on July 24. The storm stalled over Alvin, Texas, on the evening of the 25th. The storm then weakened and continued northeastward through the Ohio Valley before dissipating on July 29. Impact Tropical Storm Claudette killed 2 people and left $400 million (1979 USD, $1.1 billion 2005 USD). Eastern Caribbean Claudette as a tropical depression over Puerto Rico on July 18 In Fort-de-France, Martinique, of rain fell in 24 hours, causing localized flooding. Another total of was measured at the Martinique Aim√© C√©saire International Airport. Precipitation amounts between on Guadeloupe resulted in flooding between Pointe-√†-Pitre and Grand Fonds. Only of rain fell on Saint Barth√©lemy. Rainfall amounted to on Antigua and wind gusts reached , while precipitation totals reached and gusts up to were reported on Barbuda. On Saint Kitts, rainfall peaked at and wind gusts topped at . In the United States Virgin Islands, Claudette dropped of rain in less than 12 hours on the island of Saint Croix. Runoff from Blue Mountain caused a normally dry creek bed to overflow, flooding several homes in the Mon Bijou area. Additionally, about 25 families were evacuated in the vicinity of Glynn by the Civil Defense. Claudette produced up to of precipitation in Puerto Rico, which was recorded in municipality of Pe√±uelas. Due to heavy rainfall, about 25 families were evacuated in Quebrada Lim√≥n by the Civil Defense. One fatality occurred when an attempted to drive across a swollen creek near Guayanilla. A bridge along the Coayuco River linking Yauco to Quebrada Lim√≥n was damaged by the abnormally high water levels of the river. Minor flooding was reported in the Ponce Area was the R√≠o Portugu√©s and R√≠o Bucan√° overflowed. Excess rainfall caused the R√≠o Guanajibo to inundate streets to a \\"considerable\\" extent in Mayag√ºez. Widespread agricultural damage was reported, especially in Las Mar√≠as, Maricao, Sabana Grande, and San Sebasti√°n. Overall, losses in Puerto Rico amounted to about $750,000 (1979 USD). United States Claudette Rainfall Graphic =Texas= Claudette produced torrential rains in both Texas and Louisiana when it made landfall.

The James River overflowed near Springfield, trapping two elderly women in their home. Heavy rainfall in Farmington backed-up sewer drains, flooded basements, and blew-off large manhole covers. Flood water swept away a car in Ste. Genevieve, washed-out a portion of a sidewalk, and toppled fencing along a baseball field. At the Cover Wagon RV park in Waynesville, flooding damage was approximately $5,000. In Rolla, floodwaters between forced the evacuation of eight families, and washed out driveways. Cars, sheds, fences, kennels, and butane tanks were swept to other locations. Numerous roads were closed in Christian, Greene, and Taney Counties. As the remnants of Claudette moved inland, it dumped heavy rains across the Midwest and Ohio Valley. Flooding was reported in Missouri, where heavy rains caused significant flooding near St. Louis.NOAA Data In Indiana, about 9 inches of rain fell and isolated flooding was reported.Kansas Water Publication Aftermath On July 28, 1979, then- President of the United States Jimmy Carter issued a disaster declaration for Texas, allowing the counties of Brazoria, Chambers, Dallas, Galveston, Jefferson and Orange to be eligible for government aid in order to recover from flooding.

It was completed in 1969. In December 2011 English Heritage gave the pavilion a Grade-II* listing. Design and construction In 1955, Victor Pasmore was appointed Consulting Director of Architectural Design of the Peterlee development corporation. He chose to design the town around a central abstract artwork and pavilion, eventually naming it the Apollo Pavilion as a reference to the optimism of the Apollo Space Program. The Pavilion is made of reinforced concrete that was cast in situ. The design consists of large geometric planes of white concrete, the only decoration being two oval murals. The structure spans a small lake that frames a large geometric statue by Pasmore; in its original form, the Pavilion provided a pedestrian link between the two halves of the estate. Victor Pasmore described it as \\"... an architecture and sculpture of purely abstract form through which to walk, in which to linger and on which to play, a free and anonymous monument which, because of its independence, can lift the activity and psychology of an urban housing community on to a universal plane.\\" The work remains a rare UK example of a large scale experiment in the synthesis of art and architecture. \\"It stands today,\\" says Richard Cork, \\"as a fascinating example of how contemporary artists can translate their concerns into wholly architectural terms, and how even the restricted budget of a new town is able, given the necessary degree of commitment, to yield funding for a purely imaginative feat.\\" Reception The Pavilion was immediately the focus of local complaint, and a councillor, Joan Maslin, mounted a campaign against the work. It became a popular hangout for local youths and was subject to graffiti and vandalism. When the Peterlee Development Corporation (which commissioned the ¬£33,000 work) was disbanded, the local council refused responsibility for cleaning and repair. As a result, the concrete turned grey and began to decay. In 1982, Victor Pasmore met with residents during a public meeting at the pavilion. Pasmore suggested that, if anything, the graffiti had humanised the piece, and suggested that the solution would not be to remove the piece, but rather, the disruptive families that were abusing it. It was agreed that the stair access would be blocked off and the structure used for planting. Restoration In opposition to the residents' campaign, a friends group was organised by regional artists and cultural leaders. In 1998, English Heritage recommended the structure be given listed status but this was declined by Tony Banks in deference to the local political issue. In 2004, the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art in Gateshead commissioned Jane and Louise Wilson to make a video installation featuring the Pavilion. In the mid-2000s, there was a proposal to restore the structure and enlarge the lake, so that the Pavilion would be less accessible. In 2006, road signs were installed for directions to the Apollo Pavilion at the Passfield Way and Oakerside Drive junction saying 'Oakerside Drive leading to Pasmore's Apollo Pavilion'. Further down Oakerside Drive next to the Hearts of Oak public house is a road sign for the car park to visit the Pavilion and another sign for the footpath leading to the Pavilion. Following a meeting at the Pavilion in September 2008, it was agreed that the structure would be repaired with lottery funding. Sunday July 11, 2009 at 4pm saw the official unveiling of the Apollo Pavilion, after ¬£400,000 was spent on its restoration. The stair access was restored, as well as feature lighting, and both murals. ¬£336,000 of the funds came from the Heritage Lottery Fund, while the remaining ¬£65,000 was provided by Durham County Council.Revamp for moon mission pavilion, 2009-07-12, BBC news Unveiling the commemorative plaque, John Pasmore, Victor's son, said, \\"I am delighted the pavilion has been restored to its original state and once again reflects my father's vision.\\"  See also  *Angel of the North References External links  * Making the grade: Apollo Pavilion, Peterlee, By Keith Miller, 2002-07-27 - Telegraph * https://web.archive.org/web/20090404113542/http://www.bbc.co.uk/tees/content/image_galleries/apollo_pavillion_gallery.shtml?

She served as regent in 1605, during the absence of her spouse, and in 1611, during the minority of her son, King Gustav II Adolph. Biography Christina was the daughter of Adolf, Duke of Holstein-Gottorp, and Christine of Hesse (daughter of Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse). In 1586, she was suggested as a bride for Sigismund of Poland, but nothing came of plans to marry him. On 8 July 1592, she became the second spouse of Charles, Duke of S√∂dermanland, who in 1599 became Sweden's regent and in 1604 its king. She was crowned together with her spouse in Uppsala cathedral in 1607. According to legend, she encouraged her spouse to conquer the throne from Sigismund in 1598 because of her disappointment that she was never married to Sigismund. Queen Queen Christina was a domineering and strong-willed person with a strong sense of economy. She was both respected and feared. She has been described as hard, stubborn and stingy, and it is claimed that while the former wife of her spouse always tried to persuade him to show leniency in his acts, Christina did the opposite. She executed a very strict control over the court, which is illustrated by the anecdote that she measured up the sewing- thread for her servants in person. Her marriage has been described as happy, as they were very similar in personality. She accompanied him to Estonia and Finland in 1600‚Äì1601. Christina is not considered to have dominated her likewise dominant and temperamental spouse, but she did not lack political significance and influence. Although her spouse did not let her dictate policy, he did ask her for advice in political matters. During the war with Denmark, he disregarded her advice and came to be in conflict with her because he suspected her to be pro-Danish. In 1604, Charles IX left instructions that she should be regent of the guardian government in the case he should die if their son and heir was still minor, and in 1605, she acted as regent during her spouse's absence in Livonia. She is also known to have prevented the election of her younger son Charles Philip to the throne of the Russian Czar in 1610‚Äì1612 by keeping him at home from the Russian election when he was to be sent to Moscow. She was reportedly relieved when the affair was terminated in 1614. Queen dowager Upon the death of her spouse on 30 October 1611, she became regent during the minority of her son, as was instructed in the act of 1604. She shared the regency with John, Duke of Ostrogothia. As her son was almost of legal age, however, her reign did not last longer than from October to December of that year, and was automatically terminated on her son's birthday 9 December, when he reached legal majority. During her son's first years as king in the 1610s, she was considered by some the real, or one of the real, rulers behind the throne, even though she was no longer formally regent. She certainly acted as adviser for her son. He asked for her advice regarding the marriage of her daughter in 1612, which proved to cause a conflict with the Lutheran church. She had in fact suggested that marriage herself for political reasons and was determined to see it through, and she also arranged the marriage of her step daughter Catherine against the will of the council in 1615. As a dowager queen, she is known for preventing her son from marrying Ebba Brahe, an affair which was drawn out for several years in 1613-1615. Her reason was her preference for the political benefit a dynastic marriage could have, and her fear of the complications a marriage with a noble could have, and she regarded the precedence of queen Gunilla Bielke, who had been accused of undue political influence and favoring of her relatives, as a bad example. During this affair, she wrote a famous poem on the window of Ebba Brahe, which goes : \\"This you want, that you shall - that is the way in cases as this\\". While her regency of her eldest son was very short, she also served as regent during the minority of her younger son Charles Philip, Duke of S√∂dermanland in the Duchy of S√∂dermanland from 1611 to 1622, as the Duchy was in fact almost autonomous. She resided in Nyk√∂ping Castle, from where she managed the iron mines of her spouse and took an active interest in business. During her reign, the Duchy became the center of the Cereal export and iron- and weapon manufacture and one of the largest financiers of the crown. She also guarded and defended the autonomy of the duchies against the crown, which was about to lead to a conflict with her son the king. In 1622, however, her youngest son Charles Philip died, and she retired from public life altogether and settled in her dower. After his death, his secret marriage to Elisabet Ribbing was discovered, and she became the guardian of his daughter Elisabet Gyllenhielm (1622‚Äì1682).

The Bible gives several descriptions of angels in military terms, such as their encampment (), command structure (; Matt.13:41; Rev.7:2), and combat (Jdg.5:20; Job 19:12; Rev.12:7). The heavenly host participated in the war in Heaven. Biblical accounts Depiction of the Commander of the Lord's Army in Joshua 5, by Ferdinand Bol, 1642. In the Hebrew Bible, the name Yahweh and the title Elohim frequently occur with the word tzevaot or sabaoth (\\"hosts\\" or \\"armies\\", Hebrew: ◊¶◊ë◊ê◊ï◊™) as YHWH Elohe Tzevaot (\\"YHWH God of Hosts\\"), Elohe Tzevaot (\\"God of Hosts\\"), Adonai YHWH Tzevaot (\\"Lord YHWH of Hosts\\") or, most frequently, YHWH Tzevaot (\\"YHWH of Hosts\\"). This name is traditionally transliterated in Latin as Sabaoth, a form that will be more familiar to many English readers, as it was used in the King James Version of the Bible.Jewish Encyclopedia: Host of Heaven New York, May 1, 1901 In the Book of Joshua 5:13-15, Joshua encounters a \\"captain of the host of the Lord\\" in the early days of his campaigns in the Promised Land. This unnamed heavenly messenger is sent by God to encourage Joshua in the upcoming claiming of the Promised Land: Guido Reni's archangel Michael. In the Book of Revelation, the rebellious forces of Satan are defeated by the heavenly host led by Michael the Archangel during the War in Heaven (Rev.12:7-9).

automobiles. History In August 1943, Nissan established an aircraft engine production plant in the town of Yoshiwara, Shizuoka. After World War II, this plant began producing components for the production of Nissan automobiles. In January 1970, Nissan established a joint venture with Toyo Kogyo (Mazda and the Ford Motor Company named Japan Automatic Transmission Co., Ltd. This company changed its name to JATCO Corporation in October 1989. Nissan spun off its AT/CVT (automatic transmission/continuously variable transmission) development divisions and its Fuji manufacturing plant into a company called TransTechnology, Ltd in June 1999. Four months later, in October 1999, TransTechnology Ltd and JATCO Corporation merged to form JATCO TransTechnology Ltd. In October 2001, as part of its restructuring, Mitsubishi Motors agreed to merge its transmission division with Nissan's transmission subsidiary Jatco TransTechnology Ltd.Mitsubishi, Nissan To Merge Transmission Businesses Autoparts Report Oct 8 2001 JATCO TransTechnology Ltd changed its name to JATCO Ltd in April 2002. Nissan and Mitsubishi equity holdings in JATCO after the share exchange stood at 82% and 18% respectively. Overseas subsidiaries were established in Mexico (April 2003), France (October 2003) and Korea (May 2004). When it was still the transmission manufacturing division of Nissan, it partnered with Mazda, and thus Jatco, had long been supplying Nissan, Mazda, Subaru, Isuzu, Suzuki, BMW, Volkswagen, MG Rover Group and Land Rover. However, once it was independent, Jatco quickly began supplying other automakers: :December 1999 ‚Äî Hyundai Motor Company :January 2001 ‚Äî Jaguar Cars :December 2001 ‚Äî London Taxis International :January 2002 ‚Äî Ford Europe :April 2002 ‚Äî Renault Samsung Motors :April 2002 ‚Äî Ford Lio Ho :April 2004 ‚Äî Changan Ford :December 2005 ‚Äî DaimlerChrysler U.S.A. :October 2006 - Renault Today, JATCO has become one of the biggest supplier of CVT transmissions, and products from nearly every auto maker have used Jatco transmissions, with the notable exceptions of Honda Motor Company, who makes their own transmissions, and Toyota Motor Company, who has always used transmissions made by Aisin, a subsidiary of Toyota. GM continues to produce a majority of its transmissions through GM Powertrain, an outgrowth of Hydramatic. As of March 2015, JATCO is 75% owned by Nissan, 15% owned by Mitsubishi Motors, and 10% owned by Suzuki. In 2012, Jatco became a supplier of gearboxes in Russia for AvtoVAZ.AvtoVAZ begins to produce cars with automatic transmission In 2019, Ministry of Industry and Trade (Russia) announced plans to open

Augustus Chapman Allen (July 4, 1806 ‚Äì January 11, 1864), along with his younger brother, John Kirby Allen, founded the City of Houston in the U.S. state of Texas. He was born on July 4, 1806, in Canaseraga Village, New York (the present day hamlet of Sullivan in the Town of Sullivan, New York), to Sarah (Chapman) and Roland Allen.  Early years  Not long after turning 17, Augustus graduated from the Polytechnic Institute at Chittenango, New York, and started teaching mathematics there. In 1827, he changed careers and resigned his professorship. He then went to work as bookkeeper for the H. and H. Canfield Company, New York. After two years, he and his brother John bought an interest in the business. In the summer of 1832, the Allen brothers left Canfield to move to Texas, where they settled in San Augustine. By June 1833, the brothers had moved to Nacogdoches.  In Texas  The Allen brothers arrived first in Galveston, Texas, and then moved to the small town of Saint Augustine. In 1833, Allen and his brother associated with a group of entrepreneurs in Nacogdoches and started operating as land speculators.  During the Texas Revolution  Instead of joining the army when the Texas War of Independence started, Augustus and his brother engaged in the business of keeping supply channels open. At their own expense, they outfitted a ship, the Brutus, for the purpose of protecting the Texas coast and assisting troops and supplies from the United States to arrive safely in Texas. Nevertheless, some members of the Texas provisional government objected to the Allen brothers' activities, and rumors indicated they were engaged in privateering. In January 1836, they sold the Brutus to the Texas Navy, and it became only the second ship in the fledgling naval force. Augustus and John Allen continued to raise money and operate as receivers and dispensers of supplies and funds for the war effort without charge. In spite of the brothers' services, gossip and censure were aimed at the Allens because they were not in the armed services.  After the Revolution  Charlotte Allen Financed by an inheritance received by Augustus' wife, Charlotte, on August 26, 1836, the Allen brothers purchased 6,600 acres (27 km¬≤) along the Buffalo Bayou for $5,000, for the purpose of establishing a new city. At the suggestion of Charlotte, they named their townsite for the hero of the time, General Sam Houston. In the years after his brother John's death in 1838, the Allen family grew apart and squabbled about the family's various businesses and finances, which had been somewhat commingled. These family disputes eventually led to Allen's separation from his wife in 1850.  Later life and legacy  Soon, Allen's health began to fail, and he decided to leave Houston, signing over to his wife, whom he had never divorced, most of what remained of his many enterprises. Augustus Allen relocated to Mexico to tend to his health and a new start in life. In 1852, Augustus was appointed United States consul for the port of Tehuantepec on the Pacific Ocean, and in 1858 he was given the same position for the port of Minotitl√°n. These offices gave him control of the consular affairs of the United States for the entire Isthmus of Tehuantepec, a commercially important position. Allen, in partnership with an Englishman named Welsh, developed an extensive private shipping business. He was never able to recover his health, however, and realized, in 1864, that he was critically ill. Augustus then closed his business and went to Washington, D.C. to resign his consulships. Soon after arriving there he contracted pneumonia, from which he would not recover. Augustus Allen (58) died on Monday, January 11, 1864 in Washington, D.C. and was buried in the Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. Several Houston landmarks, including Allen Parkway and Allen Center, as well as Allen's Landing Park, immortalize Augustus and his brother, the city's two founders.

Eliot is the second son of Peregrine Eliot, 10th Earl of St Germans, and grew up at Port Eliot, a 6,000-acre estate on the Tamar Estuary where his family have lived since 1564. He is the heir presumptive to the earldom, which is currently held by his nephew.  Biography  Rialto had three UK top 40 hits in the late Nineties: \\"Monday Morning 5.19\\"; \\"Untouchable\\", \\"Dream Another Dream\\". Beset by record company wrangles, they were signed and dropped by Warners twice within four years. In 2002, Eliot released his first solo EP, Everybody Loves You When You're Dead. A chance meeting with ex-Roxy Music member and Smiths producer John Porter led to recording sessions in Los Angeles. These became the basis for Eliot's first critically acclaimed solo album, The Long Way Round, released in 2004 (Sunday Times' Album of the Week). In 2010 he released Kittows Moor under the name Louis Eliot and The Embers which was described as \\"A winning blend of rustic charm and urban cool‚Ä¶ a savvy pop brain with the lyrical articulacy of a Costello or a Weller.\\" by Uncut, and \\"an album that boasts ultra-friendly, individually shaped songs, guaranteed to warm both hearts and feet.\\" by Mojo. As a solo artist, he has toured with Sinead O'Connor, Thea Gilmore, Lloyd Cole, Robyn Hitchcock and in 2013, The Proclaimers. As a session musician Eliot has backed Skye Edwards from Morcheeba, Evan Dando of The Lemonheads and since 2011, has been the guitarist for Grace Jones on various world tours. As a songwriter Eliot's credits include Eg White's solo album, \\"Adventure Man\\" (\\"Weird Friendless Kid\\" was also recorded by Emiliana Torrini); His music has been used in TV commercials for the Guardian and UPS. \\"Life\\" and \\"Shelter You\\", recorded by Lily Allen (released February 2014), were co-written with the late Tarka Cordell and feature on Cordell's album \\"Wide Awake in a Dream\\". Eliot has featured in advertising campaigns for Burberry, Toast and Balanciaga and appeared in Katy England's short film \\"Made in England\\" in 2013. He is the son of Jacquetta St Germans (n√©e Lampson) and Peregrine Nicholas Eliot, 10th Earl of St Germans, founder of The Elephant Fayre. As a child Louis Eliot was taught guitar by Hawkwind guitarist Huw Lloyd-Langton. He attended Chelsea School of Art and studied Graphic Design at Sir John Cass in London. Eliot now lives in Cornwall, with his partner, daughter of poet Hugo Williams, and their two children. He plays a key role in the organisation of Port Eliot Festival and Kernow in the City.

MyNetworkTV began operations on September 5, 2006 with an initial affiliate lineup covering about 96% of the country, most of which consisted of stations that were former affiliates of The WB and UPN that did not join the successor of those two networks, The CW. Under the ownership structure of Fox Corporation, the service is incorporated as a subsidiary company known as MyNetworkTV, Inc. On September 28, 2009, following disappointment with the network's results, MyNetworkTV dropped its status as a television network and transitioned into a programming service, similar to Ion Television, relying mainly on repeats of recent broadcast and cable series. Alt URL Fox Corporation retained MyNetworkTV after the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by The Walt Disney Company was completed on March 20, 2019. Origins MyNetworkTV arose from the January 2006 announcement of the launch of The CW, a television network formed by CBS Corporation and Time Warner which essentially combined programming from The WB and UPN onto the scheduling model of the former of the two predecessors. As a result of several deals earlier in the decade, Fox Television Stations owned several UPN affiliates, including the network's three largest stations: WWOR-TV in Secaucus, New Jersey (part of the New York City market), KCOP-TV in Los Angeles and WPWR-TV in Chicago. Fox had acquired WWOR and KCOP after purchasing most of the television holdings of UPN's founding partner Chris-Craft Industries, while WPWR was purchased by the company in 2003 from Newsweb Corporation. Despite concerns about UPN's future that came up after Fox purchased the Chris-Craft stations, UPN signed three- year affiliation renewals with the network's Fox-owned affiliates in 2003. That agreement's pending expiration, along with those involving other broadcasting companies, in 2006 as well as persistent financial losses for both it and The WB gave CBS Corporation (the parent company of UPN) and Time Warner (parent of The WB) the rare opportunity to merge their respective struggling networks into The CW. The CW's initial affiliation agreements did not include any of the UPN stations (nor alone independent station) owned by Fox Television Stations. In fact, as part of a ten-year affiliation deal with The WB's part-owner, Tribune Broadcasting, the coveted New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago affiliations all went to Tribune-owned stations (WPIX, KTLA and WGN-TV, respectively). In response to the announcement, Fox promptly removed all network references from logos and promotional materials on its UPN affiliates and ceased on-air promotion of UPN's programs altogether. However, in all three cases (especially in the cases of Los Angeles and Chicago), the WB affiliate was the higher-rated station; CW executives were on record as preferring the \\"strongest\\" WB and UPN affiliates. Media reports speculated that the Fox-owned UPN affiliates would all revert to being independent stations, or else form another network by uniting with other UPN and WB affiliated stations that were left out of The CW's affiliation deals. Fox chose the latter route and announced the launch of MyNetworkTV on February 22, 2006, less than a month after CBS and Time Warner announced the formation of The CW on January 24. It was reported by The Guardian that Fox would utilize MySpace, the social networking website its parent company, News Corporation, had acquired in 2005, to help promote MyNetworkTV. Fox would also utilize MySpace's content-sharing model when it launched MyNetworkTV's website. There were also rumors that MyNetworkTV's branding was inspired by that of MySpace's. Programming MyNetworkTV began operations on Tuesday, September 5, 2006, with the premieres of its two initial series. Some affiliates unofficially began branding their stations well beforehand in July into August to allow viewers to grow accustomed to their new brandings, though most fulfilled their existing WB and UPN network commitments and did not start branding in earnest until September 1 (the Friday before), when the majority of those affiliate agreements expired. The network provided a block of preview programming that aired the day before on September 4, though it did not launch officially that day due to the low audience figures traditionally associated with the Labor Day holiday. Initially, programming aired Monday through Saturdays from 8:00 to 10:00 p.m. (Eastern and Pacific Time). As of April 2013, MyNetworkTV broadcasts ten hours of primetime programming each week, airing on Monday through Friday evenings from 8:00 to 10:00 p.m. Eastern and Pacific. MyNetworkTV does not offer weekend programming, the only broadcast service not to in the United States. Heavy local sports preemptions were previously a problem for MyNetworkTV at its launch, as they were for all of the U.S. broadcast networks that have debuted since the January 1995 launches of The WB and UPN. However, these have become less of an issue with the end of the network's telenovela strategy, where an airing of the pre-empted telenovela episode rescheduled as soon as possible on the same day as required by default rather than the flexibility that affiliates of UPN, The WB or The CW had to push a show off to a weekend slot. With the service's switch to an all-rerun schedule in 2009, this effectively allows stations to pre-empt repeat programming at will to fit in sporting events (mainly those provided by syndication services such as ESPN Regional Television and the ACC Network, as some local events that had aired on its affiliates have moved to regional sports networks in the time since MyNetworkTV launched) without much consequence. During the telenovela era, affiliates often scheduled contractual \\"make goods\\" of the network's daily schedule between 3:00 and 6:00 a.m. local time. Not only are these light viewing hours, but they air after Nielsen processes its preliminary morning network ratings. Telenovelas Australian logo The network's original format focused on the 18-to-49-year- old, English-speaking population with programming consisting exclusively of telenovelas (a version of the soap opera format rarely attempted on American television outside of Spanish language broadcast networks, much less in primetime), starting with Desire and Fashion House. Originally, each series aired Monday through Friday in continuous cycles of 13-week seasons, with a one-hour recap of the week's episodes airing on Saturdays; when one series ended, another unrelated series would begin the following week. The fifth and sixth series, American Heiress and Saints and Sinners, appeared one hour per week on Wednesdays before abruptly vanishing from the schedule. The MyNetworkTV serial lineup was broadcast in Australia on the W. Channel under the block name FOXTELENOVELA. In Canada, the first Desire/Fashion House cycle aired weekday afternoons on Toronto independent station CKXT-TV, which decided not to air subsequent cycles for unknown reasons. Proposed programming The announcement of the network also stated that additional unscripted reality-based and current-affairs programming were in development. These included: * Catwalk, a series similar to America's Next Top Model * On Scene, a crime-based news magazine produced by Fox News * An American version of the quiz show Britain's Brainiest * An American version of the ITV series Love Island, which would later be picked up by CBS MyNetworkTV abandoned the development of these programs in Summer 2006, choosing to focus solely on telenovelas. Later announcements by Fox regarding additional programming to air on MyNetworkTV owned-and-operated stations ‚Äì such as Desperate Housewives repeats in traditional weekend syndication, a trial run of the sitcom Tyler Perry's House of Payne (which later moved to TBS), and the daytime viewer- participation game show My GamesFever ‚Äì never applied to the network as a whole. Other programming MyNetworkTV does not supply any children's programming, late-night programming or any news or sports programming. San Francisco affiliate KRON-TV (which has maintained a news department since it launched as an NBC affiliate in 1949) and Philadelphia affiliate WPHL-TV (which produces a morning newscast, while its 10:00pm newscast is produced by ABC O&O; WPVI-TV) are currently the only stations aligned with the service that produce their own local news programming, giving MyNetworkTV the fewest news-producing stations among the six major broadcast networks (in comparison, The CW has nine news-producing stations within its portfolio). Many of the service's other affiliates carry local newscasts produced through a news share agreement with a station affiliated with one of the major networks (most often, these are produced by those owned or managed alongside the local MyNetworkTV-affiliate station), and may serve as broadcasters for local sports teams. They may also air Big Four network programming as an alternate outlet due to either breaking news or major sporting events. Revamping the schedule In response to the telenovela lineup's poor ratings performance, highlighted by an average household rating of 0.7%, reports surfaced that Fox executives were planning a major revamp of MyNetworkTV's programming, decreasing its reliance on telenovelas and adding new unscripted programs to the schedule such as reality shows, game shows (such as My GamesFever), movies and sports, and a possible revisit to a deal with the Ultimate Fighting Championship. However, MyNetworkTV instead signed a deal with another mixed martial arts organization, the International Fight League, in conjunction with Fox Sports Net. On February 1, 2007, Greg Meidel, who was named to the newly created position of network president just ten days earlier, confirmed the rumors and unveiled a dramatically revamped lineup. The intent of the shakeup was to increase viewer awareness of the network (and boost viewership, in turn), as well as to satisfy local affiliates who were disappointed over the poor ratings performance of the network under its initial format. After March 7 (when Wicked Wicked Games and Watch Over Me finished their runs), telenovelas were reduced to occupying only two nights of its programming schedule, airing in two-hour movie-style blocks rather than each of the serials airing in a one-hour, five-night-a-week format. The remainder of the schedule included theatrical movies and the new IFL Battleground (originally titled Total Impact). In addition, the Saturday night telenovela recaps ended immediately, with movies running on that night until March. The 1986 film Something Wild aired on February 3, becoming the network's first non- telenovela presentation. Specials (ranging from the World Music Awards to the Hawaiian Tropic International Beauty Pageant) and reality programming were also a part of the network's reformatting, with the first two specials airing on March 7. MyNetworkTV also reduced its telenovela programming to a single night each week, with American Heiress and Saints & Sinners airing for one hour each on Wednesdays until their unexpected termination, due to incompatible flow with IFC Battleground from Monday to Tuesday as far as promotions. The new Thursday night movie block featured mostly action/adventure films, with Friday night featuring a mix of contemporary classic films, beginning on June 5. A side effect of the new programming schedule was the loss of the network's claim that it was the only U.S. broadcast network at the time to have its entire programming schedule available in high definition, due to the IFL, some of the network's movies and additional programs being produced exclusively in 480i standard definition. In the fall of 2007, MyNetworkTV dropped telenovelas altogether, and began to air reality series and sports programs. On September 1, 2007, the network aired its first live program, the men's final of the AVP Croc Tour's Cincinnati Open. The network debuted its first sitcom, the Flavor Flav vehicle Under One Roof, on April 16, 2008; because the series used Canadian writers, it was unaffected by the 2007‚Äì08 Writers Guild strike. On February 26, 2008, the network announced it had picked up the rights to air WWE SmackDown, which left The CW at the end of September 2008. The first Smackdown! episode on MyNetworkTV aired on October 3, 2008. The first episode of WWE SmackDown pulled in the largest audience in MyNetworkTV history with 3.2 million viewers, and for the first time, put the network in fifth place for the night ‚Äì ahead of The CW ‚Äì and was the top-rated program that night in the male 18-34 and 18-49 demographics. Out-of-pattern scheduling Depending on the market, many current and former affiliate stations have presented MyNetworkTV programs out of pattern ‚Äì either to run syndicated programs or local newscasts or because of an existing affiliation with another network: * Network flagship WWOR in Secaucus, New Jersey (New York City market) in the 2013‚Äì14 season, aired a two-hour block of reruns of The Simpsons on Thursday nights from 8 to 10pm (at that time, the station was already airing regularly scheduled reruns of the show weeknights from 6:30pm to 7:30pm; reruns currently air in the market in late nights on co-owned Fox O&O; WNYW); a dual airing of House reruns, which was scheduled by the network at 8-10 PM on Thursday nights at that time, was instead run by WWOR on Saturday nights in the same timeframe. (Incidentally, Fox aired first-run Simpsons episodes on Thursday nights at 8pm for a period in the early '90s.) * KCOP/Los Angeles, the network's West Coast flagship, moved MyNetworkTV's block to 11:00pm to 1:00am weeknights as of September 14, 2015, replacing the primetime hours with two hours of entertainment newsmagazine programming, including TMZ Live and Hollywood Today Live, by far the most high-profile move of the network out of primetime. * WPWR-TV in Gary, Indiana/Chicago moved MyNetworkTV to 9:00-11:00 p.m. timeslot on September 1, 2016, and became the CW affiliate for Chicago, replacing WGN- TV. The network continues to air in the timeslot since losing the network to WCIU-TV. * From MyNetworkTV's launch through August 18, 2017, KRON-TV/San Francisco aired MyNetworkTV programming on an hour delay from 9:00 to 11:00 p.m. (Pacific Time), which is bookended by local evening newscasts (an hour- long newscast at 8:00, and a half-hour 11:00pm newscast carried over from its former NBC affiliation). KRON-TV moved the network's programming to late-night when it launched an hour-long newscast at 10:00 p.m. on May 16, 2016, and another newscast at 9:00 p.m. on August 21, 2017, respectively. * KZJO/Seattle, Washington airs MyNetworkTV programs from 1:00 to 3:00am, with syndicated reruns airing during the 8:00 p.m. (Pacific Time) hour and a newscast produced by Fox-affiliated sister station KCPQ airing at 9:00pm. The MyNetworkTV block is so played down on the station's schedule that their website erroneously notes it ended the affiliation in 2011 when it rebranded to \\"JoeTV\\" as part of station owner Tribune Media's attempts to brand stations more locally rather than by their network affiliations. * KAYU in Spokane, Washington has MyNetworkTV on 28.2. The station airs its programming 5:00pm to 7:00pm (Pacific Time) while the remainder of the schedule is filled by programming from Antenna TV. * KPDX/Portland, Oregon airs MyNetworkTV programs from 10:00pm to 12:00am, due to a two-hour-long 8:00pm (Pacific Time) newscast produced by Fox-affiliated sister station KPTV (which debuted on September 8, 2008 as a one-hour program, before expanding to its current two-hour format on August 25, 2014). * From MyNetworkTV's launch through September 19, 2009, KQCA/Sacramento, California aired MyNetworkTV programming one hour earlier (7:00 to 9:00pm) than most other Pacific Time Zone affiliates since it aired repeats of The Oprah Winfrey Show at 9:00pm as a lead-in to the station's 10:00 p.m. newscast that is produced by NBC-affiliated sister station KCRA-TV. KQCA then presented MyNetworkTV programming in a pattern, with the 7:00pm hour being filled by syndicated reruns until the 2014‚Äì15 television season. At that point, KQCA started filling the 8:00 to 10:00pm block with syndicated comedies, extending their \\"Come Home to Comedy\\" block from 5:00 to 10:00pm. KQCA airs MyNetworkTV programming in late night from 12:00 to 2:00 a.m. * During its time as a MyNetworkTV affiliate, KJZZ-TV/Salt Lake City, Utah aired MyNetworkTV programming from 12 midnight to 2:00am (Mountain Time), and branded by its call letters rather than the network's standardized branding conventions (under which it would have branded as My 14); the reasons included a local marketing agreement with then-CBS owned-and-operated station KUTV, which allowed KJZZ to rebroadcast some syndicated programs from KUTV. The service had originally aired from 11:00pm to 1:00am. at the network's launch. St. George independent station KCSG replaced KJZZ as Utah's MyNetworkTV affiliate on August 18, 2008. KUSG, a former KUTV satellite, added MyNetworkTV to its schedule on September 20, 2010; however, it delays the service's programming by one hour (airing from 8:00 to 10:00pm) to accommodate a KUTV- produced 7:00pm newscast. In November 2010, KUSG completely replaced KCSG as Utah's MyNetworkTV affiliate and changed its call letters to KMYU, also adding a simulcast to KUTV's second subchannel to serve the main Salt Lake City market. * KEVU-CD/Eugene, Oregon airs the MyNetworkTV schedule from 9:00 to 11:00pm Pacific Time, following a two-hour block of syndicated talk shows. * KWKB/Iowa City, Iowa initially carried dual affiliations with both The CW and MyNetworkTV, and aired the latter's programming from 9:00 to 11:00pm (Central Time) weeknights, immediately following CW programming. On September 19, 2011, KWKB dropped its affiliation with the network (filling the timeslot with local programming), which temporarily left the market without a MyNetworkTV affiliate. In early October 2011, Cedar Rapids ABC affiliate KCRG-TV began carrying MyNetworkTV on its second digital subchannel; however, it delays the service's programming to 12:00 to 2:00am on Tuesday through Saturday mornings with locally produced and syndicated programs airing during the prime time hours. * KDMI/Des Moines, Iowa, which rejoined MyNetworkTV on October 3, 2011 as a secondary affiliation and was affiliated with the service until September 2014, aired the service's programming weeknights from 11:00pm to 1:00am Central Time due to programming commitments to its This TV affiliation. Before dropping the network in September 2009, it had aired MyNetworkTV programming in a pattern. For nearly a year after KDMI initially dropped MyNetworkTV, CW affiliate KCWI-TV aired WWE SmackDown from the service on Saturdays from 7:00 to 9:00pm, but did not air the remainder of the service's programming. * During its time as a dual CW-MyNetworkTV affiliate, KNVA/Austin, Texas aired MyNetworkTV programming Monday through Saturdays from 9:00 to 11:00pm, immediately following The CW's primetime lineup. In the month prior to the conversion of Llano-based sister station KBVO (which previously operated as a semi-satellite of NBC affiliate KXAN-TV) to a standalone MyNetworkTV affiliate, it aired the service's programming weeknights from 10:00pm to 12 midnight, following a KXAN-produced 9:00pm newscast which debuted on September 28, 2009 (coinciding with MyNetworkTV's transition to a syndication programming service) and a repeat of The Office. * KRBK/Osage Beach, Missouri (serving the Springfield market) switched to a primary Fox affiliation on September 1, 2011, shifting MyNetworkTV programming to 9:00 to 11:00pm, immediately following Fox programming. During its time as an exclusive MyNetworkTV affiliate, it aired the service's schedule in a pattern. * WLMT- DT2/Memphis, Tennessee, which affiliated with MyNetworkTV in October 2010, presented the service's Monday through Thursday lineups in pattern but aired its Friday lineup on Saturdays from 9:00 to 11:00pm until November 14, 2011, when the subchannel switched its primary affiliation from the Retro Television Network to Me-TV. Since then, WLMT-DT2 has presented all MyNetworkTV programming in pattern with content from Me-TV airing at all other times. In the year before its move to cable channel Syfy in October 2010, WWE SmackDown aired on WLMT's main channel on Saturdays from 7:00 to 9:00 p.m., although the remainder of MyNetworkTV's lineup was not carried. WLMT temporarily dropped MyNetworkTV programming in June 2013 while transitioning to a new owner and new studio facility. * WNTZ-TV/Alexandria, Louisiana-Natchez, Mississippi and WEVV-DT2/Evansville, Indiana, both secondary MyNetworkTV affiliates, air MyNetworkTV programming weeknights from 11:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. (Central Time). Prior to July 1, 2011, when WEVV-DT2 replaced WTVW as Evansville's Fox affiliate, WEVV-DT2 aired MyNetworkTV programming at its recommended timeslot; from that point onward until July 2015 (when it moved the service's programming to its current timeslot in preparation for the August 3 relaunch of parent CBS affiliate WEVV-TV's news department and the concurrent debut of an hour-long primetime newscast for WEVV-DT2 that follows Fox programming), the subchannel aired the service's schedule weeknights from 9:00 to 11:00 p.m., immediately following Fox programming. WNTZ moved the MyNetworkTV lineup to 11:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. on September 9, 2013, in order to air the short- lived revival of The Arsenio Hall Show at 10:00 p.m. * WCIX/Springfield, Illinois aired MyNetworkTV programming on a one-hour delay weeknights from 8:00 to 10:00 p.m. (Central Time), in order to accommodate a weeknight 7:00 p.m. newscast produced by sister station WCIA. In September 2017, they moved the newscast to 9p.m. and MyNetworkTV programming now airs in pattern. * WISE- DT2/Fort Wayne, Indiana aired MyNetworkTV programming from 10:30 p.m. (following a local newscast produced by its NBC-affiliated parent station) to 12:30 a.m. on a secondary basis from August 1, 2011 to March 1, 2013. Since WFFT-TV (whose Fox affiliation was assumed by WISE-DT2 in 2011) rejoined Fox on the latter date, WISE-DT2 has aired MyNetworkTV programming in pattern as an exclusive affiliate. * WNAC/Providence, Rhode Island, also a secondary affiliate, aired MyNetworkTV programming weeknights from 11:30 p.m. to 1:30 a.m., with Saturday primetime shows running on early Sunday mornings from 1:30 to 3:30 a.m. until 2009 (WNAC has since moved the MyNetworkTV affiliation to a digital subchannel, then later moved to a subchannel of WPRI which presents the service's programming in pattern). * WGGB-DT2/Springfield, Massachusetts, also a secondary affiliate, airs MyNetworkTV programming weeknights from 11:05 p.m. to 1:05 a.m. * WLIO-DT2/Lima, Ohio, also a secondary affiliate, airs MyNetworkTV programming weeknights from 11:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. * WTRF- DT2/Wheeling, West Virginia-Steubenville, Ohio aired MyNetworkTV programming weeknights from 11:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. until Fox-affiliated with a subchannel of NBC affiliate WTOV-TV in September 2014, when it began airing the service's schedule in pattern. * WXTX/Columbus, Georgia aired MyNetworkTV programming from 12:05 to 2:05 a.m., until the station terminated its secondary affiliation with the service in 2012 (MyNetworkTV does not currently have an over-the-air affiliate in the Columbus market). * WTHI-DT2/Terre Haute, Indiana ‚Äì which became the first MyNetworkTV affiliate in that market on September 1, 2011, when it also assumed the Fox affiliation from WFXW (now ABC affiliate WAWV-TV) ‚Äì airs MyNetworkTV programming as a secondary affiliation from 11:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. * WKTC/Columbia, South Carolina previously scheduled MyNetworkTV programming in pattern until March 17, 2014, when it became a primary affiliate of The CW (the first dual affiliate of both networks since 2011); the station retains a secondary MyNetworkTV affiliation, airing its lineup after The CW's primetime schedule from 10:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. * WUAB-TV/Cleveland, Ohio introduced a 9:00-10:30 PM newscast by sister channel WOIO-TV on September 21, 2015. This shifted MyNetworkTV programming to airing from 11 p.m.-1 a.m. weeknights. After WUAB replaced WBNX as the market's CW affiliate in July 2018, the CW's network schedule has been carried in full pattern while MyNetworkTV programming was shifted again to 1-3 a.m. weeknights (the aforementioned 9 p.m. newscast reverted to its previous 10-11 p.m. timeslot). In January 2019, MyNetwork TV was moved to sister station WOIO's digital subchannel 19.2 - which predominently carries MeTV - where MyNetwork TV airs from 1-3 a.m. late nights. * KDFI/Dallas, Texas - Starting in August 2017, this affiliate has moved MyNetworkTV programming to the 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. (Central) timeslot in order to air two episodes of Family Feud at 7:00 p.m., and has changed its branding to \\"Fox 4 More\\". From launch until that time, KDFI aired MyNetworkTV's programming live at 7:00 p.m., and was branded \\"My 27\\". * WFTC/Minneapolis, Minnesota - On December 31, 2016, WFTC moved My Network programming to 8:00-10:00 p.m. due to adding Syndicated programming. On September 18, 2017, My Network programming was moved to 9:00-11:00 p.m. due to WFTC, now being rebranded as \\"Fox 9+\\", introducing a 7:00 p.m. newscast and adding additional syndicated programming. On July 16, 2018, WFTC expanded their 7:00 p.m. news to 1 hour, combined with adding more syndicated programming, shifted My Network programming to 10:00 p.m. to 12:00 a.m. * WVNS-DT2/Lewisburg/Bluefield/Beckley, West Virginia also a secondary affiliate, airs MyNetworkTV programming from 12:00 to 2:00 a.m. on Tuesday through Saturday mornings. * KOLN-DT3/KGIN-DT3/KSNB-DT2/Lincoln-Grand Island, Nebraska airs MyNetworkTV programming from 12:00 to 2:00 a.m. on Tuesday through Saturday mornings. * WMYT-TV/Rock Hill, South Carolina-Charlotte, North Carolina began airing MyNetworkTV programming from 11:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. in September 2018, using the time slot to air syndicated comedies. * WRBW/Orlando, Florida began airing MyNetworkTV programming from 10:00 p.m. to midnight. effective August 12, 2019, using the 8:00 p.m. to 10:00 p.m. time slot to air an 8p.m. newscast, syndicated comedies, and a repeat showing of Dr. Phil. *WPHL/Philadelphia, Pennsylvania began airing MyNetworkTV programming from 2 to 4a.m. on Tuesday through Saturday mornings as of the fall of 2019, using the 8 to 10p.m. time slot to air syndicated comedies. * WCTX/New Haven-Hartford, Connecticut began airing an 8-11:35 p.m. newscast produced by sister station WTNH on March 16, 2020, pushing MyNetworkTV programming to late night; it now airs from 11:35 p.m. to 1:35 a.m. * WATL/Atlanta, Georgia began airing newscasts produced by sister station WXIA- TV from 8-10 p.m. on December 2, 2019, pushing MyNetworkTV programming to late night; it now airs from midnight to 2a.m. * WDCA/Washington, D.C. airs an 8:00 p.m. half-hour newscast produced by sister station WTTG, an episode of Family Feud, a 9:00 p.m. half-hour newscast also produced by WTTG and an episode of Extra from 8:00p.m-10:00 p.m. MyNetworkTV programming currently airs from 11:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m. Viewership=Original format MyNetworkTV's debut was far from successful. Desire scored a 1.1 household rating/2 share; Fashion House went up to 1.3/2. Fox had sold about half of its projections of $50 million in advance commercial sales. On March 7, 2007, MyNetworkTV began to be included in Nielsen's daily \\"Television Index\\" reports, alongside the other major broadcast networks, although it was still not part of the \\"fast nationals\\" that incorporate the other networks. Last-minute changes to MyNetworkTV's 2007-08 fall schedule included the retitling of the reality series Divorce Wars to Decision House, and the addition of Celebrity Expos√© and Control Room Presents to the network's Monday lineup as well as a one-hour IFL Battleground, followed by NFL Total Access on Saturdays. The network's shift from telenovelas to reality shows and movies produced only a small bump in the ratings. It averaged only a .7 household rating during September 2007. MyNetworkTV continues to be the second lowest-rated English-language broadcast network in the United States, ahead of only Ion Television. The night MyNetworkTV debuted WWE SmackDown, the network took fifth place in household ratings ahead of The CW, but went back to sixth place shortly afterward. Of the six broadcast networks, Nielsen Media Research said that only MyNetworkTV had increased viewership, with 1.76 million viewers per night, up 750,000 from the previous season. On January 5, 2009, MyNetworkTV aired episodes of the 2002 revival of The Twilight Zone (which originally aired on UPN, one of the networks MyNetworkTV had replaced). The series helped the network's ratings rise, along with WWE SmackDown, becoming the second highest-rated program on the network. The highest-rated program to have ever aired on MyNetworkTV is a December 10, 2008 broadcast of the 1990 comedy film Home Alone, which brought in 3.70 million viewers (although not a record), but earned a 1.4 rating among the 18-49 adult demographic. Current format On February 9, 2009, Fox Entertainment Group announced that MyNetworkTV would convert from a television network to a programming service, similar to that of Ion Television, with a focus on repeats of acquired programs originally aired on broadcast and cable networks and in first-run syndication. Litton Entertainment had reportedly expressed interest in leasing MyNetworkTV's Saturday evening time slots, which MyNetworkTV chose to instead turn back over to its affiliates. MyNetworkTV began airing more syndicated programming in the fall, which included game shows and dramas, five nights a week. This required the network's affiliates to re-negotiate a new affiliate agreement with the new corporation within Fox operating MyNetworkTV, Master Distribution Service, Inc., though it also gave a full and unencumbered \\"out\\" to stations which chose to end their association with MyNetworkTV under this guise, which Ion Television did with their three affiliates. On April 12, 2010, WWE announced that WWE SmackDown would move to the Syfy cable channel that October; the move left MyNetworkTV with no first- run programming other than that it shared with its syndicators. Despite the lack of first-run programming, MyNetworkTV renewed its affiliation contracts for three more years on February 14, 2011. The programming service has seen significant viewership growth in viewership since its 2006 startup as a television network. Although ratings on MyNetworkTV do not match those of the other broadcast networks, Nexstar CEO Perry Sook noted his approval of its business model, saying that Nexstar's MyNetworkTV stations get 'more (local ad) inventory per hour' than they would be associated with a traditional network such as Fox or ABC. In announcing its fall schedule for the 2012-13 schedule, MyNetworkTV executives revealed that the programming service increased ratings over the previous year, and rated as the #6 most-watched network during the 2011‚Äì12 season with around 2.5 million viewers. Fox Corporation retained MyNetworkTV after the acquisition of 21st Century Fox by The Walt Disney Company was completed on March 20, 2019. Affiliates MyNetworkTV has 186 owned-and-operated or affiliate stations in the United States, reaching 84.39% of all U.S. households with at least one television set (totaling approximately 263,699,742 homes). This number includes six stations owned at the time of its launch by companies involved in the founding of competitor The CW: three were owned by Tribune Broadcasting (located in Atlanta, Philadelphia and Seattle), and three owned by CBS Corporation (the Gannett Company purchased Atlanta affiliate WATL from Tribune shortly after Fox confirmed it as a MyNetworkTV affiliate, with the sale being finalized on August 7, 2006). The Tribune Company sold its stake in The WB, in exchange for long-term affiliation contracts with The CW (Time Warner and CBS jointly own the network instead). On March 6, 2006, the Sinclair Broadcast Group announced an agreement to affiliate 17 of its stations with MyNetworkTV (consisting mostly of stations that were set to lose their WB affiliations when The CW launched, as well as a few that were affiliated with UPN or operated as independent stations). This occurred despite the widespread presumption that affiliations with The CW, which at that point was in the process of signing affiliates in most markets, would be more valuable; however, Sinclair implied that MyNetworkTV was more financially attractive for the company (of the Sinclair stations that initially affiliated with MyNetworkTV, San Antonio affiliate KMYS has since disaffiliated from the service; its August 30, 2010 affiliation swap with Fredericksburg-based CW affiliate KCWX was the first and so far only known affiliation switch between same-market affiliates of the two nutlets since their formation in 2006). One day later on March 7, Raycom Media announced that its WB and UPN stations (including WUAB/Cleveland, Ohio, KFVE/Honolulu, Hawaii and WBXH-CA/Baton Rouge, Louisiana) would also become charter affiliates of MyNetworkTV. One of the stations named in a list of newly signed MyNetworkTV affiliates that Fox Entertainment Group released on April 26, 2006, was KNVA in Austin, Texas, which The CW had also added to its own list of confirmed affiliates one week prior. On May 1, 2006, another previously-confirmed CW affiliate, KWKB in Iowa City, Iowa, signed on as a MyNetworkTV charter affiliate. Until October 2009, these two stations were the only ones to be aligned with both new networks (KNVA has since become an exclusive CW affiliate as parent station KXAN-TV converted its semi-satellite KBVO into a standalone MyNetworkTV affiliate); KNVA branded its MyNetworkTV lineup under the banner \\"MyNetworkTV on The CW Austin,\\" while KWKB's website features station logos labeled as both \\"KWKB The CW\\" and \\"My KWKB\\". In May, WAWB in Huntsville, Alabama officially announced that it would become a MyNetworkTV affiliate, and subsequently changed its call letters to WAMY. On July 12, 2006, the network announced affiliation agreements with seven additional stations (including WBFS-TV/Miami, KTVD/Denver, WUPL/New Orleans and WAWS/Jacksonville, Florida (WAWS, along with WSYX/Columbus, Ohio and WHP- TV/Harrisburg, Pennsylvania carry MyNetworkTV on digital subchannels). The deal with CBS Television Stations to have MyNetworkTV affiliate with stations that were left out of The CW's affiliation deals with the group came as a surprise in the broadcasting industry, especially after the icy reception between CBS and News Corporation (which became 21st Century Fox through the July 2013 spin-off of the company's publishing unit and Australian television properties) that began after both it and The CW came into the picture, as they refused to allow WBFS, WUPL and Boston's WSBK-TV to affiliate with MyNetworkTV as a response to pulling UPN branding from that network's Fox-owned stations. In August 2006, MyNetworkTV filled in its remaining gaps within the top 100 television markets. On August 11, the network announced affiliations with WNAC-TV in Providence, Rhode Island (as a secondary affiliate) and WNGT-LP in Toledo, Ohio. Additionally, on August 22, MyNetworkTV added KAUT-TV in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma and WRGT-TV in Dayton, Ohio (the latter of which would carry the network on a digital subchannel) to the affiliate list on its website; also that month, WZMY in Derry, New Hampshire was announced as the network's Boston area affiliate (WBIN ‚Äì the former WZMY ‚Äì disaffiliated with MyNetworkTV in September 2011, at which time WSBK (which had shunned MyNetworkTV at its formation in 2006) took over the MyNetworkTV affiliation in Boston; KAUT became an independent station in September 2012, with MyNetworkTV moving to former independent KSBI). From its inception as a network until July 2010, Mobile, Alabama was the largest city where MyNetworkTV did not have an affiliate, although Fort Walton Beach, Florida-based WFGX serves as the affiliate for the Mobile‚ÄìPensacola‚ÄìFort Walton Beach market. This was due to WFGX's weak analog signal, which was not receivable west of Pensacola, and the lack of a must-carry agreement with Comcast's Mobile system, most likely a remnant of the station's former status as a low-rated Jewelry Television affiliate prior to MyNetworkTV's launch); WFGX has since relocated its digital transmitter to Robertsdale, Alabama (where the Mobile-Pensacola market's other television stations maintain transmitters), providing an over-the-air MyNetworkTV affiliate in the Mobile area proper for the first time. On September 28, 2009, three stations owned by Ion Media Networks (WPXX-TV in Memphis, Tennessee and WEPX-TV, along with satellite station WPXU-TV, in the Greenville-New Bern-Washington, North Carolina market), due to an affiliation agreement made by their previous owners, dropped their MyNetworkTV affiliations to become full-time Ion Television owned-and-operated stations as they had been prior to September 2006 (the affiliation in the Greenville-New Bern market was taken over by NBC affiliate WITN-TV, which carries the network on a digital subchannel). Memphis CW affiliate WLMT ‚Äì which picked up MyNetworkTV for the sole purpose of carrying SmackDown, and due to the conversion into a programming service ‚Äì elected to not carry the remainder of the network's schedule; eventually, after SmackDown moved to Syfy, WLMT began carrying the remainder of the MyNetworkTV lineup as a secondary affiliation (to the Retro Television Network) on its second digital subchannel. Also in September 2009, Des Moines, Iowa affiliate KDMI disaffiliated from MyNetworkTV, replacing it with programming from the station's existing This TV affiliation. CW affiliate KCWI-TV picked up the local rights to SmackDown, and for nearly a year afterward, aired it in a manner very similar to its scheduling on WLMT. Until October 3, 2011, when KDMI rejoined the service, Des Moines was the largest television market without a MyNetworkTV affiliate ‚Äì either over-the-air or on cable (CBS affiliate KCCI took over the MyNetworkTV affiliation from KDMI in December 2014, carrying it as a primary affiliation on its third digital subchannel). On September 19, 2011, Cedar Rapids, Iowa affiliate KWKB dropped the service, while retaining its existing CW affiliation; ABC affiliate KCRG-TV later picked up MyNetworkTV for its second digital subchannel. On February 10, 2014, St. Louis affiliate WRBU disaffiliated from MyNetworkTV, and converted into an Ion Television O&O;, as a result of its sale to Ion Media Networks through Roberts Broadcasting's gradual sale of its television stations in order to raise money to pay off creditors in its Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceedings; this resulted in St. Louis temporarily displacing Spokane, Washington as the largest market without a MyNetworkTV affiliate until November 17, 2014, when CBS affiliate KMOV began carrying it on a digital subchannel. Due to the availability of \\"instant duopoly\\" digital subchannels that are likely easily available on cable and satellite, and the overall lack of a need to settle for a secondary affiliation with shows aired in problematic time slots, both The CW and MyNetworkTV launched with far greater national coverage than that enjoyed by UPN and The WB when those networks started in January 1995. For several years, UPN had affiliation gaps in several of the top 30 markets, and by 2005 managed to reach only 86% of the population. This resulted in that network having to settle for secondary affiliations with stations that were already affiliated with other networks. In those markets, programs (such as Star Trek: Voyager and Star Trek: Enterprise) were either shown out of their intended timeslots or not at all, leading to many viewer complaints. There are a handful of smaller markets, however, where MyNetworkTV holds a secondary affiliation ‚Äì even on digital subchannels ‚Äì because those markets are home to only a very small number of stations, and want to place more emphasis on programming from ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox ‚Äì which may have previously lacked affiliations in those markets ‚Äì on those subchannels. Nevertheless, because MyNetworkTV was announced after the formation of The CW and therefore got most of the \\"leftover\\" stations shut out by The CW, there are still availability issues in some markets. Also, the network is mostly relegated to low-powered stations in some smaller markets, which do not have must-carry status. The arrival of WWE SmackDown to the network has made this issue the most visible, as wrestling fans complained about the lack of availability for MyNetworkTV in several markets that have CW affiliations. This was most evident in Lexington, Kentucky, where local SmackDown viewers actually protested that they could not watch the program because low-powered MyNetworkTV/Retro Television Network affiliate WBLU-LP lacked carriage on cable providers in the market, and as an Equity Media Holdings station with no local presence outside of engineering staff, had no communication with the station to speak of. That was solved shortly afterward when ABC affiliate WTVQ agreed to move its weather forecast service to digital subchannel 36.3 and convert the 36.2 subchannel into a MyNetworkTV affiliate, stripping WBLU of its affiliation in the process. Branding In the months leading up to MyNetworkTV's launch, several of its charter stations changed their on-air identities in preparation for joining the network, including all of the network's owned-and-operated stations under sister company Fox Television Stations. Affiliates also began to air network promotions featuring the theme, \\"Entertainment you can call your own.\\" At first, many Fox-owned charter stations branded their soon-to-be MyNetworkTV O&Os; with the \\"My\\" moniker (for example, WWOR-TV was branded as \\"My 9\\"). However, by the third week of October 2006, at least one station, Los Angeles O&O; KCOP-TV, went to a two-column brand ‚Äì verbally identifying as \\"MyNetworkTV Channel 13,\\" and using a logo combining that used by the network (on the left side) and the station's channel number, 13 (on the right); KCOP switched to the simpler \\"My 13\\" branding in May 2007. While \\"My [channel #]\\" is the conventional branding style for MyNetworkTV's stations, some stations use the network's logo style with different names, such as WSTR-TV (which formerly branded as 'My 64\\", but revived its former brand \\"Star 64\\" in 2009). Especially after its shift in business model, some affiliates began to drop the \\"My\\" branding and logo in favor of local brands, such as KZJO (which re- branded from \\"myQ¬≤\\", in reference to its sister station KCPQ \\"Q13 Fox\\", to \\"JoeTV\\"), WTTA (which switched its branding from \\"My TV Tampa Bay\\" to \\"Great 38\\" in September 2013), WPMY (which switched from \\"My Pittsburgh TV\\" to \\"22 the Point\\" in August 2015 and even changed their call sign to WPNT to fit the new branding), former affiliate KAUT-TV (initially \\"OK43\\", but later \\"Freedom 43\\" as part of its efforts to appeal to Oklahoma's military community), and various Nexstar Media Group-owned affiliates (which use similar brands derived from their call letters and channel numbers, such as KARZ-TV \\"Z42\\"). In 2017, Fox began to re-brand some of its MyNetworkTV O&Os; to closer associate them with their parent Fox stations, such as WDCA, which became \\"Fox 5 Plus\\". Meredith emulated this approach on KPDX, which similarly re-branded as \\"Fox 12 Plus\\". At the time plans for MyNetworkTV were announced, there was at least one station that was using a similar moniker. WZMY-TV in Derry, New Hampshire filed a trademark for the \\"MyTV\\" name on July 6, 2005, and for a short time there was speculation that the station would file a lawsuit against Fox for the use of \\"MyTV\\". The concerns were rendered moot in July 2006, when WZMY announced that it would be Boston's affiliate for the new network. MyNetworkTV does not display an on-screen logo bug in the bottom right-hand corner of the screen, although its affiliates are inclined to display their own logo bug during the service's program lineup if they choose to incorporate it. However, on November 13, 2006, it began to incorporate a translucent logo of the program currently being aired on the bottom left side, but it discontinued this practice in March with the beginning of the third telenovela cycle.

complement each other within the Palatine Chapel. The Palatine Chapel (Italian: Cappella Palatina), is the royal chapel of the Norman palace in Palermo, Sicily. This building is a mixture of Byzantine, Norman and Fatimid architectural styles, showing the tricultural state of Sicily during the 12th century after Roger II's father and uncle conquered the island. Also referred to as a Palace church or Palace chapel, it was commissioned by Roger II of Sicily in 1132 to be built upon an older chapel (now the crypt) constructed around 1080. It took eight years to build, receiving a royal charter the same year, with the mosaics being only partially finished by 1143. The sanctuary, dedicated to Saint Peter, is reminiscent of a domed basilica. It has three apses, as is usual in Byzantine architecture, with six pointed arches (three on each side of the central nave) resting on recycled classical columns. The muqarnas ceiling of the nave and the chapel's rectilinear form show the Fatimid influence in the building's construction Mosaics Mosaic in the Palatine Chapel The mosaics of the Palatine Chapel are of unparalleled elegance as concerns elongated proportions and streaming draperies of figures. They are also noted for subtle modulations of colour and luminance. The oldest are probably those covering the ceiling, the drum, and the dome. The shimmering mosaics of the transept, presumably dating from the 1140s and attributed to Byzantine artists, with an illustrated scene, along the north wall, of St. John in the desert and a landscape of Agnus Dei. Below this are five saints, the Greek fathers of the church, St. Gregory of Nissa, St. Gregory the Theologian, St. Basil, St. John Chrysostom and St. Nicholas. The three central figures, St. Gregory, St. Basil, St. John Chrysostom, allude to the Orthodox cult known as the Three Hierarchs, which originated fifty years earlier. Every composition is set within an ornamental frame, not dissimilar to that used in contemporaneous mosaic icons. Roger II of Sicily depicted on the muqarnas ceiling in an Arabic style The rest of the mosaics, dated to the 1160s or the 1170s, are executed in a cruder manner and feature Latin (rather than Greek) inscriptions. Probably a work of local craftsmen, these pieces are more narrative and illustrative than transcendental. A few mosaics have a secular character and represent oriental flora and fauna. This may be the only substantial passage of secular Byzantine mosaic extant today.  Muqarnas ceiling  The structure is influenced by Fatimid art style, with the nave ceiling taking from Fatimid art through the use of muqarnas. The nave is similar to Islamic reception halls with the presence of the muqarnas vaulted ceiling and arches along the colonnade. There is also an indication of Kufic script in the Cappella Palatina, this however, is highly debated by scholars because the inscriptions were removed later. It is thought to be likely that these Kufic inscriptions were intended for the structure due to the presence of Kufic inscriptions in other structures built for or by King Roger II. The Cappella Palatina is also influenced by the Islamic style of having rectilinear patterns, uncommon to European art at the time. The hundreds of facets of the Muqarnas ceiling were painted, notably with many purely ornamental vegetal and zoomorphic designs but also with scenes of daily life and many subjects that have not yet been explained. Stylistically influenced by Egyptian Fatimid Art, these paintings are innovative in their more spatially aware representation of personages and of animals. Most muqarnas are made out of stucco or stone but the muqarnas in the Cappella Palatina are molded and carved with wood. There are arch shaped panels as the main construction and hidden panels that help center wood cuts for the small vaults in the muqarnas. The muqarnas has 5 horizontal tiers that allow a smooth transition from the ceiling to the walls of the nave. The ceiling is supported by horizontal cavetto wood moldings that touch the upper part of the windows. There are 8 point stars on the ceiling of the nave that are created with an overlay of two squares at a 45-degree angle. The muqarnas ceiling was built most likely after the mosaics of the nave ordered by William I.Detail of the Muqarnas ceiling of the nave Chapel Cappella Palatina in Palermo Sicily The chapel combines harmoniously a variety of styles: the Norman architecture and door decor, the Arabic arches and ceiling designs and script adorning the roof, the Byzantine dome and mosaics. For instance, clusters of four eight-pointed stars, typical for Muslim design, are arranged on the ceiling so as to form a Christian cross. The Cappella Palatina is built along an east-west axis. On the west side resides the throne platform and on the east side is the sanctuary with the nave connecting these two sides, with domes over each side. Along the northern wall of the sanctuary is the royal balcony and the northern chapel, where the King would watch and listen to the liturgy on special feast days. Along the nave runs two rows of colonnades, with windows in between each colonnade. The chapel was decorated with gold, pearls, porphyry, silk and marble. Nave The nave, constructed under Roger II, did not contain any Christian images. These were added later by Roger II's successors, William I and William II. The nave's ceiling consists of Arab, Greek and Latin inscriptions. The frame for the royal throne sets against the west wall of the nave. There are six steps leading up to where the throne would be, along with two heraldic lions in two roundels upon the spandrels over the throne frame gable. Part of the nave of the Cappella Palatina The nave had different forms of decoration from the north and south to the east and west. Intricate lacing from the ceiling mold outline the arches of the nave in the north and South. These outlines are accompanied by oval medallions and cartouches. In the East and West, the decoration is similar to the muqarnas ceiling but is missing some molding for the borders of the ceiling. Sanctuary Mosaic of Christ Pantocrator As an expression of Norman culture, St. Dionysius and St. Martin are represented in the sanctuary. Mosaics are of Byzantine culture in their composition and subjects. The apex of the dome consists of the Pantokrator, with rows of angels, prophets, evangelists and saints. The Byzantine motif ends abruptly with scenes from Christ's life along the south wall of the southern transept arm, while the north wall consists of warrior saints. Analysis Slobodan ƒÜurƒçiƒá considers the Palatine Cappella a reflection of Middle Byzantine art. Illustrating architectural and artistic genius to juxtapose Sicily's \\"melting pot\\" culture. According to European historians, Roger II made the decision to make the throne room and chapel equal in the main part of the Cappella Palatina in order to send a message to the Papacy and other rulers of Europe that he was going to stay in Sicily and there was nothing they could do about it.

Chancler on the drums. Ndugu was recruited after Josef Zawinul heard him play with Carlos Santana. Weather Report was recording next door to Ndugu in the studio, and Chancler was asked to join them for a recording session. That session ended up lasting a week and produced Tale Spinnin'. After the record, Ndugu was asked to join the band as a permanent member, but declined in favor of continuing to work with Carlos Santana.

The collection's eponymous story derives its name from the work of Pierre Teilhard de Chardin. The collection was published posthumously in 1965 and contains an introduction by Robert Fitzgerald. Of the volume's nine stories, seven had been printed in magazines or literary journals prior to being collected. \\"Judgment Day\\" is a dramatically reworked version of \\"The Geranium,\\" which was one of O'Connor's earliest publications and appeared in her graduate thesis at the University of Iowa. \\"Parker's Back,\\" the collection's only completely new story, was a last- minute addition. Stories *\\"Everything That Rises Must Converge\\" *\\"Greenleaf\\" *\\"A View of the Woods\\" *\\"The Enduring Chill\\" *\\"The Comforts of Home\\" *\\"The Lame Shall Enter First\\" *\\"Revelation\\" *\\"Parker's Back\\" *\\"Judgement Day\\"  \\"Everything That Rises Must Converge\\"  The story is told from the close third-person point of view of Julian, a recent college graduate and self-styled intellectual who lives with his mother because he cannot afford his own lodgings with the pittance he earns as a typewriter salesman. The mother, whose worldview reflects the blatant racism of the mid-twentieth century American South, wishes to attend an exercise session at a nearby community center, but is wary of riding the bus by herself in light of the recent racial integration of the city's public transportation system. Though he despises his mother's racism, cheeriness, and intellectual aloofness, Julian resentfully agrees to escort her, if only out of a sense of duty to the woman who paid his way through college and continues to support him even afterward. His confrontational bitterness and her thoughtless prejudice bring the circumstances to a boil when they step onto the bus and join a widely disparate cast of characters, among them three African American citizens who inhabit vastly different regions of the social spectrum. The title Everything That Rises Must Converge refers to a work by the French philosopher Pierre Teilhard de Chardin titled the \\"Omega Point\\": \\"Remain true to yourself, but move ever upward toward greater consciousness and greater love! At the summit you will find yourselves united with all those who, from every direction, have made the same ascent. For everything that rises must converge.\\"Analysis of Everything That Rises Must Converge In popular culture In the Lost (TV series) episode at the end of the fifth season, \\"The Incident,\\" Jacob is seen reading Everything That Rises Must Converge while he waits for John Locke (Lost) to fall from a window in the background. The band Shriekback put out a song by this title in 1985.

jurist, an SS- Obersturmbannf√ºhrer (Lieutenant colonel), leader of Einsatzkommando 8 of Einsatzgruppe B of the Security Police (Sicherheitspolizei or SiPo) and the SD, and Commander of the Security Police in Litzmannstadt (≈Å√≥d≈∫) and Potsdam.  Early life and education  Dr. Otto Bradfisch was born in 1903 in Zweibr√ºcken (then Palatinate district of Kingdom of Bavaria) as the second of grocery salesman Karl Bradfisch's four children. In Kaiserslautern he went to the Volksschule for four years and afterwards to the Gymnasium. In 1922, he did the school-leaving examination. At the Universities of Freiburg, Leipzig, Heidelberg, and Innsbruck Bradfisch studied economics. He ended his studies with a graduation to Dr. rer. pol. at the University of Innsbruck in 1926. Afterwards, Bradfisch studied law in Erlangen and Munich to improve his professional chances in difficult times. He sat for the state law examination on 17 February 1932, and the second on 20 September 1935.  Professional and political career  Engaged first as an Assessor in the Upper Bavarian government, he was transferred to the Bavarian State Ministry for the Interior as a Government Assessor. Already by 1 January 1931, Bradfisch had joined the NSDAP with membership number 405,869. At the time he was studying in Munich, he was working as the acting local group leader (Ortsgruppenleiter) in Munich- Freising. In 1936, he joined the National Socialist Motor Corps. On 26 September 1938, he joined the SS (membership no. 310,180) as an SS- Obersturmf√ºhrer (First lieutenant). At an acquaintance's urging, Bradfisch applied for service in the Gestapo, into which he was hired on 15 March 1937. He was also given the acting leadership of the State Police post at Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe. Appointed a government adviser on 4 November 1938, Bradfisch stayed there until his assignment as leader of Einsatzkommando (EK) 8, attached to Einsatzgruppe (EG) B of the Security Police and the Sicherheitsdienst in June 1941.  Leader of Einsatzkommando 8 of Einsatzgruppe B  Einsatzgruppe B was one of four Einsatzgruppen deployed for special operations during Operation Barbarossa, the attack on the Soviet Union. This Einsatzgruppe was led by SS-Brigadef√ºhrer (major general) Arthur Nebe, Chief of the Kripo, and was subdivided into Einsatzkommandos 8 and 9, and the Sonderkommandos 7a and 7b, as well as the Vorkommando Moskau. It was also attached to Army Group Middle. The Einsatzgruppen tasks were established by oral F√ºhrer order and a written directive from Reichssicherheitshauptamt (RSHA) Chief Reinhard Heydrich on 2 July 1941, to secure areas to the advancing army's rear and the performance of standard police tasks until the establishment of a civil administration in the conquered eastern areas, and the \\"special handling of potential opponents\\", i.e. their elimination. Heydrich identified these in order: \\"all Comintern functionaries (all professional Communist politicians), the higher, middle and radical lower functionaries of the Party, the Central Committee and the regional and area committees, people's commissars, Jews in Party and state posts, various radical elements (saboteurs, propagandists, snipers, assassins, agitators, and so on)\\". This circle of persons was later expanded to all \\"politically intolerable elements\\" among prisoners of war and eventually all \\"racial inferiors\\" such as Jews, Gypsies, and \\"Asiatic elements\\". Meant at first to take the job as staff consultant on Einsatzgruppe B's staff, Bradfisch took part in a major discussion at the Pretzsch Border Police School at which Heydrich and the Chief of RSHA Department IV (Gestapo), Heinrich M√ºller, explained to the Einsatzgruppe and Einsatzkommando leaders in all plainness their task. After the presentation of this instruction, which without doubt was recognized by all participants as wrongful and criminal, the originally foreseen leader of Einsatzkommando 8, the provisional leader of the Liegnitz State Police post Ernst Ehlers appealed to Einsatzgruppe B's leader Nebe with the wish to be released from this duty. Nebe complied with Ehlers's wish and appointed Bradfisch as his replacement. Bradfisch had no doubts about the work that lay ahead. The Einsatzkommando 8, led by Bradfisch from the beginning of the Russian Campaign onwards, consisted of six subdivisions varying in strength, each under an SS leader. The unit's total strength was about 60 to 80 men. In view of his official position as government adviser and Leader of the Neustadt an der Weinstra√üe State Police post, Bradfisch, as the EK 8 leader, was awarded the rank of SS-Sturmbannf√ºhrer (major). With the onset of the Russian Campaign on 22 June 1941, the EK 8 followed Army Group Middle through Bia≈Çystok and Baranaviƒçy in late 1941 to Minsk. On 9 September 1941 they reached Mahilyow where, given the slowdown that the German offensive had suffered, and the forthcoming winter, plans were made for a lengthy stay. As to the ways of doing things whereby the EK 8 fulfilled the tasks that it was ordered to do, and which were more or less the same for every Einsatzkommando, the Munich State Court I in their ruling of 21 July 1961 at the Einsatzgruppe Trial portrayed them as follows: > In carrying out the order to annihilate the Jewish eastern population as > well as other population groups considered to be racially inferior, and > functionaries of the Russian CP, the EK 8, after crossing the demarcation > line between the German Reich and the Soviet Union established in the year > 1939, conducted ongoing shooting campaigns, in which mainly Jews were > killed. (‚Ä¶) The gathering of the Jews in each of the effected places ‚Äì as > the usage of the time had it, the \\"maintenance\\" (\\"√úberholung\\") ‚Äì happened in > such a way that the locality or street was surrounded by some members of the > Einsatzkommando and then next the victims were driven together out of their > houses and flats randomly by other Kommando members. The victims were then > either transported right after being taken prisoner by truck to the shooting > places already established beforehand, or held prisoner in suitable > buildings (schools, factories) or other localities, until they were then > shot the next day or a few days later. Already in these so-called \\"through- > combing actions\\" (\\"Durchk√§mmungsaktionen\\") it came to bodily mishandling and > in the odd case even to killing old and sick people who could not walk, and > who were thus shot in their dwellings or right nearby. The mass shootings > took place in each case outside the \\"maintained\\" town or locality, where > natural hollows, abandoned infantry and artillery posts, and above all > armoured dugouts or mass graves dug by the victims themselves, served as > execution places. At the executions that happened in the first few weeks of > the Russian Campaign, only men aged about 18 to 65 were killed, whereas > women and children were often spared at first. Beginning in August 1941 at > the latest, however ‚Äì already at the shootings in Minsk ‚Äì they furthermore > switched over to killing men and women of all ages, and even children. After > completing the preparations, the victims, who were offloaded from the trucks > right near the shooting pit and who had to sit on the ground awaiting the > further events, were either brought forth to the pit by EK 8 members, or > driven forth through laneways built by Kommando members to the pits, if > needed with the help of blows. After they had first given up their things of > value and pieces of clothing that were in good condition, unless this had > already happened when they were taken prisoner, they then had to lay > themselves with their faces to the ground, and were then killed with shots > to the back of the head. In the earlier shooting campaigns (Bia≈Çystok, > Baranaviƒçy, Minsk) but also occasionally even later on the occasion of major > actions, execution squads were put together from Einsatzkommando members and > policemen assigned to them, which in strength matched in each case the > numbers of the groups of people driven to the shooting pit, or in the odd > case even possessed twice the strength, so that in each case, one shooter or > two shooters had to shoot at one victim. These shooting squads, which were > armed with carbines(Karabiner 98kurz), were put together mostly from > policemen and commanded by a platoon leader from the police unit put under > him who was appropriate to the command given him by the EK 8 leadership. At > these executions undertaken by shooting squads it occasionally came to pass > that the victims had to put themselves at the edge of the pit, to be then > \\"shot into\\" the pit. In the course of the deployment, there was an ever > greater changeover from shooting with rifle salvos to killing the intended > people with single shots or machine pistols. The grounds for this lay in the > claim that shooting with rifle salvos took a relatively long time, and > moreover, the force of the shots delivered from the shortest distance was so > violent that the shooting squad and sundry other persons participating in > the action were sprayed with the killed people's blood and bits of brain, a > circumstance which raised the mental burden of the men on the execution > squad, which was already extraordinary anyway, that often there were misses > and therefore the victims' suffering was prolonged. The shootings with > machine pistols were carried out as a rule in such a way that the > Einsatzkommando members in the pit designated to carry out the execution > went along the row of persons to be shot, killing one victim after another > with shots to the back of the head. This method of execution inevitably led > to some of the victims having to wait a longer time lying on badly or not at > all buried dead bodies, with certain death before their eyes, until they > themselves were given the death shot. In some cases, the killing of the > victims was carried out in such a way that they were brought to the shooting > place double-quick, thrust into the pit, and then, while they were falling, > they were shot. While at the shootings in Bia≈Çystok and Baranaviƒçy, and > partly still at the executions in Minsk, the dead bodies were more or less > well covered with sand or earth before the next group were driven or led to > the pit, such a covering only seldom took place in the later shooting > campaigns, so that the victims that followed, if they were shot in the pit, > each had to lay themselves down on the dead bodies of those who had just > been killed. But also in cases in which the dead bodies had had sand or > earth thrown over them lightly, the victims that followed noticed their > killed fellow doomed people's bodies, whose parts often jutted out of the > thin sand or earth covering. A doctor was not called in to the executions. > If one of the victims still showed signs of life, he was administered an > aftershot with a pistol by a Kommando member, usually a leader. The > execution places were each sealed off by Einsatzkommando members or police > officials subordinate to them, so that for the people right near the > shooting pit waiting for their deaths there was no possibility of escaping > their doom. In fact, they had the opportunity ‚Äì this circumstance > demonstrates a particular intensification of their suffering ‚Äì to hear the > crack of rifle salvos or machine pistol shots and in the odd case to observe > the shootings to which neighbours, friends and kin fell victim. Given this > ghastly fate, the victims often broke out in loud crying and moaning, prayed > loudly and tried to reaffirm their innocence. Some, however, went quietly > and calmly to their deaths.  Criminal actions  Bradfisch was as leader of the EK 8 responsible for all measures and executions. To some extent, he led the executions, and in the odd case even shot with his own hand. Some examples follow: *Bia≈Çystok, two shooting campaigns of at least 1100 Jews and Bolshevist functionaries *Baranaviƒçy, two shooting campaigns of at least 381 Jews *Minsk, seven Jew shootings of at least 2000 people *Mahilyow, eight shooting campaigns of at least 4100 Jewish men, women and children as well as Russian prisoners of war *Babruysk, major action, in which at least 5000 Jewish men, women and children were shot. About his Einsatzkommando's activities, Bradfisch had to report to the higher-ranking Einsatzgruppe B, who sent the RSHA these reports compiled with those from the other Einsatzkommandos. There, the individual reports were condensed into the so-called event reports by Office IV A.  Security Police and SD Commander  Bradfisch was active as EK 8 leader until 1 April 1942. On 26 April 1942 he was transferred to ≈Å√≥d≈∫ ‚Äì which the Nazis called Litzmannstadt ‚Äì and appointed chief of the State Police post there. In this function he was also responsible for deporting Jews to the Che≈Çmno extermination camp. He became the area Commander of the Security Police and the SD in summer 1942. In autumn of the same year came his provisional appointment as ≈Å√≥d≈∫'s mayor. In this capacity he was also promoted to high government adviser and SS-Obersturmbannf√ºhrer (Lieutenant colonel) on 25 January 1943.  War's end  After the city's evacuation due to the war in December 1944, Bradfisch worked as Commander of the Security Police and the SD in Potsdam for the last few months of the war. As the Red Army closed in, Bradfisch managed to escape westwards, procuring for himself a Wehrmacht pay book with junior officer Karl Evers's name on it. He first found himself in American custody as a prisoner of war, but was then transferred to British custody, and by August 1945, he was released.  Post war  Until 1953, Bradfisch managed to hide his true identity by using the name Karl Evers. He worked first in farming and later in mining. When Bradfisch became an insurance agent in Kaiserslautern, eventually for Hamburg-Mannheimer as a regional director, he once again began using his true name. On 21 April 1958, Bradfisch was temporarily seized and sentenced by the Munich State Court I on 21 July 1961 to 10 years in labour prison (Zuchthaus) for the crime, committed with Bradfisch as part of a group, of abetting collaborative murder in 15,000 cases. In 1963, he was sentenced to 13 years in prison. Bradfisch and his wife, who were married on 23 November 1932, had three children, the youngest of whom, a girl born in ≈Å√≥d≈∫, died as they were fleeing the Soviet army advance. On 16 October 1965 Bradfisch left prison. He had served 4 years, 2 months, and 26 days- about 1 hour for each of his 37,000 victims. He died Seeshaupt, aged 91.

It can be used to build a comprehensive and effective information security management system. In addition to covering information security-related standards such as COBIT 5 for Information Security, The CIS Critical Security Controls for Effective Cyber Defense, the 2016 standard covers ISO/IEC 27002 as well as PCI DSS 3.1 and the NIST Cybersecurity Framework. Research projects Based on member input, the ISF selects a number of topics for research in a given year. The research includes interviewing member and non-member organizations and thought leaders, academic researchers, and other key individuals, as well as examining a range of approaches to the issue. The resulting reports typically go into depth describing the issue generally, outlining the key information security issues to be considered, and proposing a process to address the issue, based on best practices. Methodologies and tools For broad, fundamental areas, such as information risk assessment or return-on-investment calculations, the ISF develops comprehensive methodologies that formalize the approaches to these issues. Supporting the methodology, the ISF supplies web and spreadsheet-based tools to automate these functions. The Benchmark The ISF's Benchmark (formerly called the 'Information Security Status Survey') has a well-established pedigree ‚Äì harnessing the collective input of hundreds of the world's leading organizations for over 25 years. Organizations can participate in the Benchmark service at any time and can use the web-based tool to assess their security performance across a range of different environments, compare their security strengths and weaknesses against other organizations, and measure their performance against the ISF's 2016 Standard of Good Practice, ISO/IEC 27002:2013, and COBIT version 5 for information security. The Benchmark provides a variety of data export functionality that can be used for analyzing and presenting data for management reporting and the creation of security improvement programs. It is updated on a biennial basis to align with the latest thinking in information security and provide the ISF Members with improved user experiences and added value. Face-to-face networking Regional chapter meetings and other activities provide for face- to-face networking among individuals from ISF member organisations. The ISF encourages direct member-to-member contact to address individual questions and to strengthen relationships. Chapter meetings and other activities are conducted around the world and address local issues and language/cultural dimensions. Annual World Congress The ISF's annual global conference, the 'World Congress', takes place in a different city each year. The 2017 conference will take place in October in Cannes, France. The event offers an opportunity for attendees to discuss and find solutions to current security challenges, and gain practical advice from peers and leading industry experts from around the world. Over 1,000 global senior executives attend. The event includes a series of keynote presentations, workshops and networking sessions, best practice and thought leadership in a confidential peer-group environment. Web portal (ISF Live) The ISF's extranet portal, ISF Live, enables members to directly access all ISF materials, including member presentations, messaging forums, contact information, webcasts, online tools, and other data for member use. Leadership The members of the ISF, through the regional chapters, elect a Council to develop its work program and generally to represent member interests. The Council elects an 'Executive' group which is responsible for financial and strategic objectives.

a water-soluble mixture of different dyes extracted from lichens. It is often adsorbed onto filter paper to produce one of the oldest forms of pH indicator, used to test materials for acidity.  History  Litmus was used for the first time in about 1300 by Spanish physician Arnaldus de Villa Nova. From the 16th century onwards, the blue dye was extracted from some lichens, especially in the Netherlands.  Natural sources  Parmelia sulcata Litmus can be found in different species of lichens. The dyes are extracted from such species as Roccella tinctoria (South America), Roccella fuciformis (Angola and Madagascar), Roccella pygmaea (Algeria), Roccella phycopsis, Lecanora tartarea (Norway, Sweden), Variolaria dealbata, Ochrolechia parella, Parmotrema tinctorum, and Parmelia. Currently, the main sources are Roccella montagnei (Mozambique) and Dendrographa leucophoea (California).  Uses  Litmus paper after being used The main use of litmus is to test whether a solution is acidic or basic. Blue litmus paper turns red under acidic conditions and red litmus paper turns blue under basic or alkaline conditions, with the color change occurring over the pH range 4.5‚Äì8.3 at . Neutral litmus paper is purple.Manfred Neupert: Lackmus in R√∂mpp Lexikon Chemie (German), January 31, 2013. Litmus can also be prepared as an aqueous solution that functions similarly. Under acidic conditions, the solution is red, and under alkaline conditions, the solution is blue. Wet litmus paper can also be used to test for water-soluble gases that affect acidity or basicity; the gas dissolves in the water and the resulting solution colors the litmus paper. For instance, ammonia gas, which is alkaline, turns red litmus paper blue. Chemical reactions other than acid‚Äìbase can also cause a color change to litmus paper. For instance, chlorine gas turns blue litmus paper white - the litmus dye is bleached, because of presence of hypochlorite ions. This reaction is irreversible, so the litmus is not acting as an indicator in this situation. Chemistry The litmus mixture has the CAS number 1393-92-6 and contains 10 to 15 different dyes. All of the chemical components of litmus are likely to be the same as those of the related mixture known as orcein, but in different proportions. In contrast with orcein, the principal constituent of litmus has an average molecular mass of 3300. Acid- base indicators on litmus owe their properties to a 7-hydroxyphenoxazone chromophore. Some fractions of litmus were given specific names including erythrolitmin (or erythrolein), azolitmin, spaniolitmin, leucoorcein, and leucazolitmin. Azolitmin shows nearly the same effect as litmus.E.T. Wolf: Vollst√§ndige √úbersicht der Elementar-analytischen Untersuchungen organischer Substanzen, S.450-453, ver√∂ffentlicht 1846, Verlag E. Anton (Germany) Mechanism Red litmus contains a weak diprotic acid. When it is exposed to a basic compound, the hydrogen ions react with the added base. The conjugate base formed from the litmus acid has a blue color, so the wet red litmus paper turns blue in alkaline solution.

It was her first album in nine years on Capitol Records. The primary reason for the length of time between her studio albums was due to Capitol's constant changes. At the time, the label went through several CEO's and eventually shut down their urban music division from 1996-1999. When the record label got a new president in former Arista Records executive Roy Lott, he revived Capitol's long-struggling urban music division. Spencer acknowledged the changes within Capitol in the liner notes of Tracie. She stated: \\"I have seen a lot of changes occur at the tower, but that's just the way life goes. I have nothing but love and respect for my record company. Change is good\\".Tracie Spencer - Tracie. (CD liner notes) Capitol Records 7243 8 34287 2 8 Although this is Spencer's first album in over a decade, this was not her first recording of new material. She recorded a couple of songs for the soundtracks of two films from the late 1990s. She sang \\"I'll Be There For You\\" for the 1997 Nickelodeon film Good Burger as well as the DJ Quik produced \\"The Rain\\" for the 1998 Maya Angelou directed film Down in the Delta. She worked with the Danish R&B; production team Soulshock & Karlin for all but one song on Tracie, with Dallas Austin protege Arnold Hennings providing his lone contribution \\"Love To You\\". Two singles were released from the album in 1999 with \\"It's All About You (Not About Me)\\" and \\"Still in My Heart\\", aided by music videos directed by Francis Lawrence and Kevin Bray, respectively. Tracie went to #114 on the Billboard 200 and #19 on R&B;/Hip-Hop Albums chart becoming her highest charting album on that chart. Critical reception Allmusic editor Jaime Sunao Ikeda called's the album \\"a grouping of average material sung by an above-average singer. Tracie Spencer's gift has always been her ability to outshine the other aspiring divas of the day with excellent pitch and phrasing. On Tracie, however, we find her wasting her talents [...] The first ten tracks are virtually indistinguishable from each other [...] This album could have also done with reverse sequencing of the tracks and varying the sound of the others. Despite the lack of notable material on this attempt, Spencer will always remain one of the shining stars of the late-'90s generation of singers.\\" Track listing Sample credits *\\"No Matter\\" contains a sample of \\"Fun\\" by Brick. *\\"Not Gonna Cry\\" contains a sample of \\"Don't Tell It\\" by James Brown. *\\"It's On Tonight\\" contains a sample of \\"Get High Tonight\\" by Busta Rhymes.

His father, Johann B√∂se, was a head teacher in Hemelingen which at that time was part of Prussia. Hermann B√∂se, along with three of his brothers, qualified as a teacher, after which, between 1897 and 1907, he worked at the deaf-mute institute in Bremen. During the German Revolution of 1918-1919, B√∂se became the Bremen Soviet Republic's head of the People's Commissariat for Education. In this position, B√∂se prohibited religious education. Since B√∂se was a convinced communist he was arrested in 1943 by the Gestapo. He died two days after he was released from the KZ Mi√üler, a concentration camp which also held fellow Bremen Soviet Republic politician Alfred Faust. Till this day B√∂se is known as one of the most passionate resistance fighters of the KPD. The Hermann-B√∂se-Stra√üe and the Hermann-B√∂se-Gymnasium (since 2005) in Bremen are named after him.

determine whether the nominating official would proceed with the appointment or nomination. The expression is a metaphor based on the litmus test in chemistry, in which one is able to test the general acidity of a substance, but not its exact pH. Those who must approve a nominee, such as a justice of the Supreme Court of the United States, may also be said to apply a litmus test to determine whether the nominee will receive their vote. In these contexts, the phrase comes up most often with respect to nominations to the judiciary. Usage The metaphor of a litmus test has been used in American politics since the mid-twentieth century. During United States presidential election campaigns, litmus tests the nominees might use are more fervently discussed when vacancies for the U.S. Supreme Court appear likely. Advocates for various social ideas or policies often wrangle heatedly over what litmus test, if any, the president ought to apply when nominating a new candidate for a spot on the Supreme Court. Support for, or opposition to, abortion is one example of a common decisive factor in single-issue politics; another might be support of strict constructionism. Defenders of litmus tests argue that some issues are so important that it overwhelms other concerns (especially if there are other qualified candidates that pass the test). The political litmus test is often used when appointing judges. However, this test to determine the political attitude of a nominee is not without error. Supreme Court Chief Justice Earl Warren was appointed under the impression that he was conservative but his tenure was marked by liberal dissents. Today, the litmus test is used along with other methods such as past voting records when selecting political candidates. The Republican Liberty Caucus is opposed to litmus tests for judges, stating in their goals that they \\"oppose ‚Äòlitmus tests‚Äô for judicial nominees who are qualified and recognize that the sole function of the courts is to interpret the Constitution. We oppose judicial amendments or the crafting of new law by any court.\\" Professor Eugene Volokh believes that the legitimacy of such tests is a \\"tough question\\", and argues that they may undermine the fairness of the judiciary: :Imagine a justice testifies under oath before the Senate about his views on (say) abortion, and later reaches a contrary decision [after carefully examining the arguments]. \\"Perjury!\\" partisans on the relevant side will likely cry: They'll assume the statement made with an eye towards confirmation was a lie, rather than that the justice has genuinely changed his mind. Even if no calls for impeachment follow, the rancor and contempt towards the justice would be much greater than if he had simply disappointed his backers' expectations. :Faced with that danger, a justice may well feel pressured into deciding the way that he testified, and rejecting attempts at persuasion. Yet that would be a violation of the judge's duty to sincerely consider the parties' arguments.

Discovery  Keith Tritton (U. K. Schmidt Telescope Unit, Coonabarabran) discovered this comet on a deep IIIa-J exposure made with the 122-cm Schmidt telescope on 1978 February 11.66.  Historical Highlights  * A preliminary orbit was calculated by M. P. Candy (Perth Observatory, Australia) using positions obtained by Tritton on February 11, 13, and 15. It was an elliptical orbit with a perihelion date of 1977 October 30.07 and an orbital period of 7.30 years. B. G. Marsden (Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory) revised the orbit using five positions spanning the period of February 11 to March 13. He also gave an elliptical orbit with a perihelion date of October 28.51 and an orbital period of 6.33 years. * Moonlight made observations impossible during the last half of February 1978 and during the early days of March; however, the comet was found by J. H. Bulger (Harvard Observatory's Agassiz Station) on March 10.27. He gave the nuclear magnitude as 20. The last three observations of the comet were obtained by Shao on March 11.28, 13.20, and 14.21. On IAU Circular No. 3194, issued on 1978 March 15, Marsden wrote, \\"It is possible that the comet experienced an outburst around the time of the Harvard observation on Feb. 15....\\" No observations were obtained thereafter. * The comet was not detected during the predicted returns of 1984, 1990 or 1996 and was presumed lost. * However, on 2003 October 6.44, using CCD images obtained with a 0.12-m refractor, C. W. Juels (Fountain Hills, Arizona, USA) and P. Holvorcem (Campinas, Brazil) detected a comet that proved to be on a similar orbit to the lost comet. B. G. Marsden was able to calculate a new orbit, published in IAU Circular No. 8215, issued 2003 October 7, which confirmed that it was indeed identical to comet Tritton. * The comet was also recovered at its 2010 apparition.

The river and the Barle Valley are both designated as biological Site of Special Scientific Interest. On the Chains above Simonsbath is a reservoir known as Pinkery Pond. It was formed in the 19th century when John Knight and his son dammed the river at that point. The pond's purpose is unknown, but vestiges of a small canal can be seen nearby. Wheal Eliza Mine was an unsuccessful copper and iron mine on the river near Simonsbath. The river passes under a late medieval six-arch stone Landacre Bridge in Withypool, and the Tarr Steps a prehistoric clapper bridge possibly dating from 1000 BC. The stone slabs weigh up to 5 tons apiece. According to local legend, they were placed by the devil to win a bet. The bridge is long and has 17 spans. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building. In Dulverton the river is crossed by the Barle Bridge. Ecology The river flows through the Somerset Wildlife Trust's Mounsey Wood Nature Reserve and Knaplock and North Barton SSSI, first notified in 1954, which are within Exmoor National Park. This is notable for the presence of rare plant and bird life and including Kingfisher habitats and one of the only sites of great burnet (Sanguisorba officinalis) on Exmoor.

Jews of Philadelphia, Henry Samuel Morais, 1894, pp. 341-342 As part of a successful career in the manufacturing industry, in 1899 he acquired the Holland Torpedo Boat Company, which was renamed the Electric Boat Company and produced submarines for the U.S. and British navies. It continues today as General Dynamics Electric Boat.  Life and career  Rice was born in Wachenheim, Bavaria in 1850, the son of Mayer Rice and Fanny Sohn Rice. He emigrated to the United States with his mother in 1856. He was educated at the Central High School in Philadelphia and at nineteen he was sent to Paris, where he studied music for three years. While there he sent stories to the Philadelphia newspapers for printing. In 1868 he moved to England, where he became a teacher of music and languages. On his return to America a year later he moved to New York City and practiced music before going back to school to become a lawyer. After graduating from Columbia College Law School in 1880 he practiced law for the rest of the decade.Adler and Porter, pp. 405-406 In the practice of law he became more aware of and involved in the transportation business, mainly in the expanding railroad empires and their multiplying legal imbroglios. He was regarded in his time as one of the ablest specialists in railroad law in the United States, and held large investments in several lines, including the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad and Reading Railroad. He was invited to start a publishing company by some associates in the music printing societies. In the 1890s he was looking to move and diversify and possibly invest early in emerging companies with a potential for growth. In 1892 he bailed out the bankrupt Electro-Dynamic Company in partnership with its proprietor, William Woodnut Griscom.Records of the Electric Launch Company He became the first president of The Forum magazine, and later the Electric Storage Battery Co. (later Exide) in 1897. Some of the numerous other companies Rice organized or was involved in included the Electric Vehicle Company, Car Lighting and Power Company, American Casein Company, and the Consolidated Rubber Tire Company.Isaac L. Rice obituary, The New York Times, 3 November 1915 The Isaac L. and Julia B. Rice House, a New York City landmark listed on the National Register of Historic Places (no. 80002711), currently Yeshiva Ketana of Manhattan As president of Electric Storage, he became aware of the attempts (despite financial difficulties) since 1896 to deliver the first modern submarines for the US Navy, which ran on electric power while underwater. A year after the 1897 launch of their first vessel, the Holland VI, the management of John Philip Holland and Lewis Nixon (owner of the Crescent Shipyard in New Jersey, where Holland VI was built) found it difficult to finish making the last details operable and were running out of cash. Isaac Rice moved in, taking over and renaming the company as the Electric Boat Company on 7 February 1899. After a few months of negotiations and multiple tests, the United States Navy purchased Holland VI, renamed it USS Holland, and awarded the new company a contract to build its first fleet of s. Also in 1899, Rice added the Electric Launch Company (Elco) to his family of companies. During World War I, Rice's new company (Electric Boat) and its subsidiaries (notably Elco) built 85 Navy submarines and 722 submarine chasers, along with 580 Motor Launches for the British Royal Navy (in the World War I era Electric Boat's submarines were built by subcontractors, primarily Fore River Shipbuilding in Quincy, Massachusetts). Electric Boat was a founding company of General Dynamics Corporation, which is the company's Cold War progeny. In 1902 he received from Bates College the honorary degree of LL.D.Edward Winter, Professor Isaac Rice and the Rice Gambit (2006) The books published by Rice include: \\"What Is Music?\\" (New York, 1875), which was supplemented by \\"How the Geometrical Lines Have Their Counterparts in Music\\" (ib. 1880). The latter work was subsequently made part of the \\"Humboldt Library of Science.\\" He also contributed a large number of articles to the Century, The Forum, of which he was a founder, and North American Review. Rice married Julia Hyneman Barnett (1860‚Äì1929) on December 12, 1885. His \\"intellectual partner\\" and an \\"accomplished musician\\", Julia B. Rice campaigned successfully against the horns and whistles of ships and founded the Society for Suppression of Unnecessary Noise (1907). They had six children: Muriel \\"Polly\\" (1888‚Äì1926), Dorothy \\"Dolly\\" (1889‚Äì1960), Isaac Leopold Jr., Marion \\"Molly\\" (1891‚Äì1990), Marjorie \\"Lolly\\" (1893‚Äì1980) and Julian. Dorothy Rice (Peirce, Sims) and Marion Rice Hart both became famous sportswomen‚Äîaviators, among other things‚Äîand writers. Isaac and Julia, Muriel and Dorothy are buried in a family plot at Woodlawn Cemetery in Ocala, Florida. Rice died at the Hotel Ansonia in New York City on 2 November 1915. The obituary does not give the cause of death, but does state that he sold his Electric Boat stock for two million dollars (in 1915 money) a few months prior to it. He is interred in the Woodlawn Cemetery, Ocala, Florida.Isaac Leopold Rice at Findagrave.com  Chess  Rice was a prominent figure in the American chess world. He became president of the Manhattan Chess Club, and presented for competition several trophies, including the one that was competed for annually by cable by the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, representing England, and those of Harvard, Yale, Princeton, and Columbia, representing the United States. In 1895 he discovered a variation of the Kieseritzky gambit, which then became known as the Rice Gambit. He then sponsored tournaments where the opening became the starting point of each game. Emanuel Lasker and Mikhail Chigorin were two of many players who contested these tournaments, with bonus prizes for white wins. In 1904 he formed the Rice Gambit Association which published a detailed analysis of the effects of the move.

It is the sequel to Crystal Quest. The aim of the game is to collect crystals. Unlike Crystal Quest, which included a \\"Critter Editor,\\" Crystal Crazy has no functionality for easily editing aspects of the game such as the enemy graphics. Versions of Crystal Crazy before 1.05 do not have sound on PowerPC-based Macintoshes. The last version is 1.06. It is not possible to play this game on Intel-based Macs without an emulator (a technique that would work with any modern operating system).  Gameplay  The player commands a spaceship piloted by a cow. When all in-game lives are expended, a cutscene depicts a cow in a spaceship, flying across the screen, towing a banner that says, \\"In space, no one can hear you moo.\\" The general objective of Crystal Crazy is to collect all the crystals on a given stage, and often to complete other quests, then escape through an opening at the bottom of the screen. At higher levels, the opening will change size at a fixed rate. Quests include erasing or revealing paintings by navigating the spaceship over the canvas; knocking pool balls into the exit opening; breaking wine glasses and other fragile objects against the edge of the screen; or simply defeating all the enemies on a given level. Bonuses, which add to the player's numeric score, are often scattered across the levels and can be collected. Occasionally, a bonus round tasks the player with collecting as many items as possible, before escaping through the exit opening, while avoiding being crushed by two walls converging from either side of the screen. The player's performance during bonus rounds adds to their score. Moving the mouse directs the spaceship in the appropriate direction. Clicking the mouse fires the spaceship's weapon. By default, the weapon releases one fixed-direction projectile per click. Power- ups enable the player to shoot multiple or homing projectiles, or add to the player's defensive capabilities, bestowing upon them various types of shields. Hitting enemies with projectiles weakens them, and enemy-launched projectiles can destroy the player's spaceship. The player can use a limited number of bombs, denoted by a cherry bomb icon, to destroy all on-screen enemies. Advanced levels include mines that will destroy the player's spaceship upon contact. As the player progresses, the enemies, portrayed as simple, pixelated sprites, become faster and develop the ability to shoot various projectiles. At higher stages, asteroids will float across the screen to impede the player, and can be destroyed piece-by-piece by shooting them with projectiles.

The project was initially funded by money raised by the benefit single Persons Unknown/Bloody Revolutions, as well as benefit gigs by Crass and The Poison Girls. Project Metropolitan Wharf, former home of the Wapping Autonomy Centre The centre was set up in a rented space in Metropolitan Wharf, Wapping in 1981. The initial costs were paid using funds raised from a benefit single. It was a split single composed of Persons Unknown by The Poison Girls and Bloody Revolutions by Crass. The warehouse had been suggested by Andy Martin from the anarchist Little A printers who worked in the building. Like later squatted centres, it had no alcohol or music licences. Activities Crass lead singer Steve Ignorant performing at the Autonomy Centre in 1981 During its short lifespan, the Autonomy Centre became an important focal point for the anarcho-punk movement in the UK and Europe. Most of those involved with the project were anarchists who participated in protests and direct action against targets such as vivisection laboratories, the meat industry and the policies of then Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The Kill Your Pet Puppy collective organised events. Some of the bands that regularly played at the centre included Anthrax, The Apostles, Cold War, Conflict, Rudimentary Peni Hagar the Womb were formed in the toilets.

With the punks' money came the punks, and in the first week they had ripped up every single piece of furniture carefully bought, planned and fitted, down to the lavatory fittings that had been installed by Ronan from scratch, and defaced our own and everyone else's wall for blocks around. In the excitement of the first gigs where they could do as they liked, they did as they liked and wrecked the place. Loss of club, loss of money, loss of effort. End of story.\\" The centre eventually folded when the benefit parties failed to pay the rent.

Suburban Legends (Tim Remix) is essentially the same album from the Orange County based ska punk band. It was first released in 2002 in Los Angeles, California by We the People Records. Its first pressing came with a green cover which was later changed to an orange cover. The green cover version is now very hard to find. The music, however, is the same on both editions. The main difference between the two versions is that the green cover edition was released by We the People Records, while the orange cover edition was self-released by the band at the end of the year. As of 2012, both versions are out of print. Music The instrumentals of the EP are exactly the same as the older version with Chris Batstone on vocals, except for \\"Don Juan\\" having its intro removed. The only other changes were made to the vocal tracks. Tim Maurer, having rejoined the band as vocalist, replaced the lead vocal track on all songs except Desperate. He also recorded most of the backing vocals, adding more harmony vocals compared to Chris Batstone's version. Trumpet player Aaron Bertram had recorded most of the backing vocals on the previous version of the EP, but would still do the backing vocals live. Tim and Chris' versions have been compared by fans, who consider Chris' version to be more energetic with his powerful singing voice, while Tim's voice has been regarded as more melodious with his emotional interpretations. On the final track, \\"Desperate,\\" Vincent Walker replaces Chris Batstone's vocal track, making it another duet between him and Brian Klemm. Even though Brian Klemm also sung half of the original song, he re-recorded his vocal track for this release. During live performances of the song, Vincent Walker takes over the guitar from Brian Klemm in the second half of the song. When Tim Maurer was still the band's vocalist, he would sometimes take over Vincent's vocals of the second half. Tracks 3 and 4, Don Juan and Alternative is Dead, had both been previously released on Suburban Legends' demo album Origin Edition and were co-written by the band's bassist at the time, Justin Meacham. Alternative is Dead was also one of the first tracks the band had written and was on the band's first demo, the Bomb Squad EP. All of these older versions featured Tim Maurer on vocals as well.

The film is not based on the plot of Jack Williamson's novel The Humanoids, to which it bears little resemblance, but on an original story and screenplay written by Jay Simms.The opening credits read: \\"Story and screenplay by Jay Simms\\". In a post-nuclear-war society, blue-skinned, silver-eyed human-like robots have become a common sight as the surviving population suffers from a decreasing birth rate and has grown dependent on their assistance. A fanatical organization tries to prevent the robots from becoming too human, fearing that they will take over. Meanwhile, a scientist experiments with creating human replicas that have genuine emotions and memories. Plot The Earth is suffering the aftereffects of a nuclear war that destroyed 92 percent of humanity. Lingering radiation has caused the birth rate to fall below replacement level and the population continues to decline. A robotic labor force maintains a high standard of living for the survivors and the humanoids of the title are an advanced type of robot created to directly serve and otherwise work closely with human beings. These humanoids are built with artificial, ultra-logical personalities and they appear human except for their blue-gray \\"synthe-skin\\", metallic eyes and lack of hair. The humanoids periodically visit recharging stations they call \\"temples\\" where they also exchange all information acquired since their last visit with a central computer they call \\"the father-mother\\". A quasi-racist human organization named The Order of Flesh and Blood is opposed to the humanoids, which the members disparagingly refer to as \\"clickers\\". The Order believes the humanoids are planning to take over the world and are a threat to the very survival of the human race. The Order does not stop at illegal violent actions, including bombings. At one meeting, its members are alarmed to learn of the existence of a humanoid which has been made externally indistinguishable from a human and which has killed a man. They demand that all existing humanoids be disassembled or downgraded to a strictly utilitarian machine-like form. Scientist Dr. Raven (Doolittle) has developed a technique called a \\"thalamic transplant\\", which transfers the memories and personality of a recently deceased human into a robotic replica of that person. The human-humanoid hybrids that result awake from the process unaware of their own transformation, although their human personalities are shut off between 4 and 5 A.M., when they report back to the humanoids at the robot temple. As Dr. Raven describes the operation, \\"We draw off everything that makes a man peculiar to himself. His learning, his memory: these, inter- reacting, constitute his personality, his philosophy, capability and attitude. The human brain is merely the vault in which the man is stored.\\" With the help of Dr. Raven, the humanoids are secretly replacing humans who recently died with these replicas. One of the leaders of the Order of Flesh and Blood, Captain Kenneth Cragis (Megowan), meets Maxine, and although she is opposed to the Order they both fall in love. In the end they discover that they, too, are advanced humanoid replicas with the minds of deceased persons. Ironically, the \\"real\\" Maxine had died in a bomb attack which the Order intended to harm only robots. Dr. Raven, a once-human replica himself, explains to Cragis and Maxine that not only are they practically immortal in their new forms they can also be the first humanoids upgraded to the highest possible level: after a minor alteration, they will be able to procreate. Finally, Dr. Raven breaks the fourth wall, looks directly into the camera and tells the viewer, \\"Of course, the operation was a success ... or you wouldn't be here.\\" This final line implies the story was set in the distant past.

Short items in contemporary trade publications indicate that it was being filmed in the summer of 1960 under a working title variously reported as This Time Around or This Time Tomorrow. American Cinematographer (1960) 41:570 (issue number and date not available but not earlier than 1 July as evident from mention of that date on page 442) Motion Picture Herald (1960) 220-221:56 (issue number and date not available but mid-year and before 8 September) The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences lists August 1960 as the completion date. Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences list of credits for The Creation of the Humanoids (completion date shown as 08/60) Producer- director, former child star and Hollywood area native Wesley Barry's Genie Productions was located in Hollywood, The 1962 Film Daily Year Book of Motion Pictures, page 586 and the cast and crew credits are populated by Hollywood personnel, but no information about the actual filming location and other specific details has yet come to light. The film's limited budget is most apparent from its rudimentary sets, which consist mainly of a few blank flats, floor-to-ceiling drapes, or other simple elements set up in front of a painted background scene or a black void, as well as from its costumes, most of which are either generic jumpsuits or a uniform composed of stock costume rental items such as Confederate Army caps. Yet the producers opted for the added expense of filming in color at a time when black-and-white was still being used for many major-studio productions and was readily accepted by audiences, and they obtained the services of two top-tier behind-the-camera talents, albeit in the twilights of their careers. Cinematographer Hal Mohr had a very extensive Hollywood career and two Academy Awards to his credit. Mohr used lighting and camera angles to make the best of the sets and add some visual interest to the long, actionless talking-head scenes that make up nearly all of the film. He sometimes used classic Hollywood \\"glamor lighting\\" techniques when photographing the normal-looking \\"human\\" characters, giving some scenes a degree of visual polish seldom seen in a low-budget exploitation film. Jack Pierce was Universal Pictures' master makeup artist during all of the 1930s and most of the 1940s and created the iconic Frankenstein and Bride of Frankenstein makeups among many others. The most unusual features of Pierce's makeup design for this film are the large reflective scleral contact lenses that give the humanoids the appearance of having metal ball eyes. The lenses were furnished by Dr. Louis M. Zabner, an optometrist who pioneered the use of contact lenses to change actors' eye color and is credited in the film for \\"special eye effects\\". At that time, scleral lenses were made of a hard plastic. Wearing them was uncomfortable and they had to be removed frequently. Pierce had used similar silvery lenses in 1957 for brief close-ups in The Brain from Planet Arous. Most of the considerable time and effort it took to apply the rest of the humanoid makeup was spent on hiding the actors' hair, which it would have been unthinkable to expect them to actually shave off for a few days' work in a low-budget film. Latex rubber \\"bald wigs\\" were glued on, eyebrows were stuck down flat, then putty was carefully applied to cover rough textures and blend in tell-tale edges. Finally, the actors' heads were painted all over with blue-gray greasepaint and they were given rubber gloves of the same color. The musical score consists of electronically generated sounds and wordless female vocalizing that suggests the Theremin music often used in science fiction films of the 1950s (e.g., The Day the Earth Stood Still and It Came from Outer Space). The credit appearing in the film is \\"Electronic Harmonics by I.F.M.\\" The Internet Movie Database lists producer Edward J. Kay as the composer, though this information is nowhere verified. Release A general theatrical release through Emerson Film Enterprises was launched with an official opening in Los Angeles on 3 July 1962. An advertising campaign was begun, including the broadcast of short TV spots. Unlike most film posters of the time, which were printed by a four-color process that allowed a full range of eye-catching colors to be used, the posters for this film were two-color printings limited to black, white, red, grays, pinks and browns. The use of a two-color poster for a small independent black-and-white film was not uncommon, but it was unusual when one of the selling points of the film being advertised was the fact that it was in color. Makeup artist Jack Pierce participated in the 1962 publicity campaign by giving interviews and by making up Los Angeles TV movie host Wayne Thomas as a humanoid, complete with silvery contact lenses, during a live broadcast. Progress in the application of the makeup was televised during commercial breaks in the unrelated film being shown. The live segments were temporarily saved on videotape and rebroadcast several times in the following days. After running its theatrical course in drive-ins, low-end suburban theaters, \\"kiddie matinees\\" and urban theaters specializing in exploitation films, the film was released to television, where it was being shown by late 1964.Los Angeles Times, 15 November 1964, weekly TV Times insert, various pages (shown repeatedly on channel 9 as that week's so- called \\"Million Dollar Movie\\") It was released on Beta and VHS videocassettes by Monterey Home Video in 1985 and was later available from Something Weird Video. The first licensed DVD release came in 2006 on a double-feature disc from Dark Sky Films. The film's running time is often listed as 75 minutes. The Dark Sky DVD release runs 84 minutes and is presented in anamorphic 16:9 widescreen, which approximates the matted aspect ratios most commonly used for 35 mm projection in the United States in 1962. The earlier videocassette releases are not pan-and-scan versions of a widescreen image, but simply unmatted full-frame 1.33:1, revealing areas at the top and bottom of the image not normally seen in a theater. Reception The film's theatrical run was apparently not commented on in the mainstream press. The public reception as measured by theater attendance and profitability is unclear, but one 1962 item in the trade paper Variety notes that \\"Creation of the Humanoids and Invasion of the Animal People at the Fox shape to a sock $10,000\\", \\"sock\\" being a favorable term in that publication's show-business jargon and $10,000 the week's box office receipts at the Fox theater. After its 1964 television debut, references to more than its title began to appear.

In 1936, the airship Hindenburg offered passengers a piano, lounge, dining room, smoking room, and bar during the 2 1/2-day flight between Europe and America. After World War II, IFE was delivered in the form of food and drink services, along with an occasional projector movie during lengthy flights. In 1985 the first personal audio player was offered to passengers, along with noise cancelling headphones in 1989. During the 1990s, the demand for better IFE was a major factor in the design of aircraft cabins. Before then, the most a passenger could expect was a movie projected on a screen at the front of a cabin, which could be heard via a headphone socket at his or her seat. Now, in most aircraft, private IFE TV screens are offered. Design issues for IFE include system safety, cost efficiency, software reliability, hardware maintenance, and user compatibility. The in-flight entertainment on board airlines is frequently managed by content service providers. History The first in-flight film screened during the 1921 Parade of Progress Exposition in Chicago Movie screening in a DC-8 of SAS, 1968 The first in-flight movie was in 1921 on Aeromarine Airways, showing a film called Howdy Chicago to its passengers as the amphibious airplane flew around Chicago. The film The Lost World was shown to passengers of an Imperial Airways flight in April 1925 between London (Croydon Airport) and Paris. Eleven years later, in 1932, the first in-flight television called 'media event' was shown on a Western Air Express Fokker F.10 aircraft. The post-WWII British Bristol Brabazon airliner was initially specified with a 37-seat cinema within its huge fuselage; this was later reduced to a 23-seat cinema sharing the rear of the aircraft with a lounge and cocktail bar. The aircraft never entered service. However, it was not until the 1960s that in-flight entertainment (other than reading, sitting in a lounge and talking, or looking out the window) was becoming mainstream and popular. In 1961, David Flexer of Inflight Motion Pictures developed the 16mm film system using a 25-inch reel for a wide variety of commercial aircraft. Capable of holding the entire film, and mounted horizontally to maximize space, this replaced the previous 30-inch-diameter film reels. In 1961, TWA committed to Flexer's technology and was first to debut a feature film in flight. Interviewed by the New Yorker in 1962, Mr Flexner said, \\"an awful lot of ingenuity has gone into this thing, which started from my simply thinking one day, in flight, that air travel is both the most advanced form of transportation and the most boring.‚ÄùQuoted in Rebecca Maksel, Bringing Inflight Movies to Airlines Was Harder Than It Sounds, airspacemag.com, Smithsonian, 12 June 2015 Amerlon Productions, a subsidiary of Inflight, produced at least one film, Deadlier Than the Male, specifically for use on airplanes. Pakistan International Airlines was the first international airline to introduce this entertainment system showing a regularly scheduled film on board in the year 1962. In 1963, Avid Airline Products developed and manufactured the first pneumatic headset used on board the airlines and provided these early headsets to TWA. These early systems consisted of in-seat audio that could be heard with hollow tube headphones. In 1979, pneumatic headsets were replaced by electronic headsets. The electronic headsets were initially available only on selected flights and premium cabins, whereas economy class still had to make do with the old pneumatic headsets. In the United States, the last airline to offer pneumatic headphones was Delta Air Lines, which switched to electronic headphones in 2003, despite the fact that all Delta aircraft equipped with in-flight entertainment since the Boeing 767-200 have included jacks for electronic headphones. Throughout the early to mid-1960s, some in-flight movies were played back from videotape, using early compact transistorized videotape recorders made by Sony (such as the SV-201 and PV-201) and Ampex (such as the VR-660 and VR-1500), and played back on CRT monitors mounted on the upper sides in the cabin above the passenger seats with several monitors placed a few seats apart from each other. The audio was played back through the headsets. In 1971, TRANSCOM developed the 8mm film cassette. Flight attendants could now change movies in-flight and add short subject programming. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, CRT-based projectors began to appear on newer widebody aircraft, such as the Boeing 767. These used LaserDiscs or video cassettes for playback. Some airlines upgraded the old film IFE systems to the CRT-based systems in the late 1980s and early 1990s on some of their older widebodies. In 1985, Avicom introduced the first audio player system, based on the Philips Tape Cassette technology. In 1988, the Airvision company introduced the first in-seat audio/video on-demand systems using LCD technology for Northwest Airlines. The trials, which were run by Northwest Airlines on its Boeing 747 fleet, received overwhelmingly positive passenger reaction. As a result, this completely replaced the CRT technology. Today, in-flight entertainment is offered as an option on almost all wide body aircraft, while some narrow body aircraft are not equipped with any form of in-flight entertainment at all. This is mainly due to the aircraft storage and weight limits. The Boeing 757 was the first narrow body aircraft to widely feature both audio and video in-flight entertainment and today it is rare to find a Boeing 757 without an in-flight entertainment system. Most Boeing 757s feature ceiling-mounted CRT screens, although some newer 757s may feature drop-down LCDs or audio-video on demand systems in the back of each seat. Many Airbus A320 series and Boeing 737 Next Generation aircraft are also equipped with drop-down LCD screens. Some airlines, such as WestJet, United Airlines, and Delta Air Lines, have equipped some narrow body aircraft with personal video screens at every seat. Others, such as Air Canada and JetBlue, have even equipped some regional jets with VOD. For the introduction of personal TVs on board jetBlue, company management tracked that lavatory queuing went far down. They originally had two planes, one with functioning IFE and one with none, the functioning one later was called \\"the happy plane\\". System safety and regulation One major obstacle in creating an in-flight entertainment system is system safety. With the sometimes miles of wiring involved, voltage leaks and arcing become a problem. This is of more than theoretical concern. The IFE system was implicated in the crash of Swissair Flight 111 in 1998. To contain any possible issues, the in-flight entertainment system is typically isolated from the main systems of the aircraft. In the United States, for a product to be considered safe and reliable, it must be certified by the FAA and pass all of the applicable requirements found in the Federal Aviation Regulations. The concerning section, or title, dealing with the aviation industry and the electronic systems embedded in the aircraft, is CFR title 14 part 25. Contained inside Part 25 are rules relating to the aircraft's electronic system.Code of Federal Regulations Title 14 Part 25 Federal Aviation Administration, Tuesday 10 April 2007 There are two major sections of the FAA's airworthiness regulations that regulate flight entertainment systems and their safety in transport category aircraft: 14 CFR 25.1301 which approves the electronic equipment for installation and use, by assuring that the system in question is properly labeled, and that its design is appropriate to its intended function. 14 CFR 25.1309 states that the electrical equipment must not alter the safety or functionality of the aircraft upon the result of a failure. One way for the intended IFE system to meet this regulatory requirement is for it to be independent from the aircraft's main power source and processor. By separating the power supplies and data links from that of the aircraft's performance processor, in the event of a failure the system is self-sustained, and can not alter the functionality of the aircraft. Upon a showing of compliance to all of the applicable U.S. regulations the in-flight entertainment system is capable of being approved in the United States. Certain U.S. design approvals for IFE may be directly accepted in other countries, or may be capable of being validated, under existing bilateral airworthiness safety agreements. Cost efficiency The companies involved are in a constant battle to cut costs of production, without cutting the system's quality and compatibility. Cutting production costs may be achieved by anything from altering the housing for personal televisions, to reducing the amount of embedded software in the in-flight entertainment processor. Difficulties with cost are also present with the customers, or airlines, looking to purchase in-flight entertainment systems. Most in-flight entertainment systems are purchased by existing airlines as an upgrade package to an existing fleet of aircraft. This cost can be anywhere from $2 million to $5 million for a plane to be equipped with a set of seat back LCD monitors and an embedded IFE system.In Flight Entertainment Goes High Tech Digital Journal, Tuesday 10 April 2007 Some of the IFE systems are being purchased already installed in a new aircraft, such as the Airbus A320,Airbus A-320 Family Airbus A-320 Family which eliminates the possibility of having upgrade difficulties. Some airlines are passing the cost directly into the customers ticket price, while some are charging a user fee based on an individual customers use. Some are also attempting to get a majority of the cost paid for by advertisements on, around, and in their IFE. The largest international airlines sometimes pay more than $90,000 for a licence to show one movie over a period of two or three months. These airlines usually feature up to 100 movies at once, whereas 20 years ago they would have only 10 or 12. In the United States, airlines pay a flat fee every time the movie is watched by a passenger. Some airlines spend up to $20 million per year on content. Software reliability Software for in-flight entertainment systems should be aesthetically pleasing, reliable, compatible, and also must be user friendly. These restrictions account for expensive engineering of individually specific software. In-flight entertainment equipment is often touch screen sensitive, and can be controlled with a handset, allowing interaction between each seat in the aircraft and the flight attendants, which is wireless in some systems. Along with a complete aircraft intranet to deal with, the software of the in-flight entertainment system must be reliable when communicating to and from the main in-flight entertainment processor. These additional requirements not only place an additional strain on the software engineers, but also on the price. Programming errors can slip through the testing phases of the software and cause problems.How to Crash an In Flight Entertainment System CSO the Resource for Security Executives, Tuesday 10 April 2007 Varieties of in- flight entertainment=Moving-map systems Simplified version of Airshow A moving-map system is a real-time flight information video channel broadcast through to cabin project/video screens and personal televisions (PTVs). In addition to displaying a map that illustrates the position and direction of the plane, the system gives (utilizing both the imperial and metric systems) the altitude, airspeed, outside air temperature, distance to the destination, distance from the origination point, and origin/destination/local time (using both the 12-hour and 24-hour clocks). The moving-map system information is derived in real time from the aircraft's flight computer systems. The first moving-map system designed for passengers was named Airshow and introduced in 1982. It was invented by Airshow Inc (ASINC), a small southern California corporation, which later became part of Rockwell Collins. KLM and Swissair were the first airlines to offer the moving map systems to their passengers. The latest versions of moving-maps offered by IFE manufacturers include AdonisOne IFE, ICARUS Moving Map Systems, Airshow 4200 by Rockwell Collins, iXlor2 by Panasonic Avionics and JetMap HD by Honeywell Aerospace. In 2013, Betria Interactive unveiled FlightPath3D, a fully interactive moving-map that enables passengers to zoom and pan around a 3D world map using touch gestures, similar to Google Earth. FlightPath3D was chosen by Norwegian as the moving- map on their new fleet of Boeing 787 Dreamliners, running on Panasonic's Android based touch-screen IFE system. After the attempted Christmas Day bombing of 2009, the United States Transportation Security Administration (TSA) briefly ordered the live-map shut-off on international flights landing in the United States. Some airlines complained that doing so may compel the entire IFE system to remain shut. After complaints from airlines and passengers alike, these restrictions were eased. Audio entertainment Audio entertainment covers music, as well as news, information, and comedy. Most music channels are pre-recorded and feature their own DJs to provide chatter, song introductions, and interviews with artists. In addition, there is sometimes a channel devoted to the plane's radio communications, allowing passengers to listen in on the pilot's in-flight conversations with other planes and ground stations. In audio-video on demand (AVOD) systems, software such as MusicMatch is used to select music off the music server. Phillips Music Server is one of the most widely used servers running under Windows Media Center used to control AVOD systems. This form of in-flight entertainment is experienced through headphones that are distributed to the passengers. The headphone plugs are usually only compatible with the audio socket on the passenger's armrest (and vice versa), and some airlines may charge a small fee to obtain a pair. The headphones provided can also be used for the viewing of personal televisions. In-flight entertainment systems have been made compatible with XM Satellite Radio and with iPods, allowing passengers to access their accounts or bring their own music, along with offering libraries of full audio CDs from an assortment of artists.Apple Teams Up With In Flight Entertainment Apple Computer, Tuesday 10 April 2007 Video entertainment iQ entertainment system on a Qantas A330 Video entertainment is provided via a large video screen at the front of a cabin section, as well as smaller monitors situated every few rows above the aisles. Sound is supplied via the same headphones as those distributed for audio entertainment. However, personal televisions (PTVs) for every passenger provide passengers with channels broadcasting new and classic films, as well as comedies, news, sports programming, documentaries, children's shows, and drama series. Some airlines also present news and current affairs programming, which are often pre-recorded and delivered in the early morning before flights commence. PTVs are operated via an in-flight Management System which stores pre-recorded channels on a central server and streams them to PTV equipped seats during flight. AVOD systems store individual programs separately, allowing a passenger to have a specific program streamed to them privately, and be able to control the playback. Some airlines also provide video games as part of the video entertainment system. For example, Singapore Airlines passengers on some flights have access to a number of Super Nintendo games as part of its KrisWorld entertainment system. Also Virgin America's and Virgin Australia's Entertainment System offer passengers internet gaming over a Linux-based operating system.Virgin America's RED Entertainment System Engadget, Tuesday 10 April 2007 =Personal televisions= eFX system installed on a Delta Air Lines Boeing 737-800 Most airlines have now installed personal televisions (otherwise known as PTVs) for every passenger on most long-haul routes. These televisions are usually located in the seat-backs or tucked away in the armrests for front row seats and first class. Some show direct broadcast satellite television which enables passengers to view live TV broadcasts. Some airlines also offer video games using PTV equipment. Many are now providing closed captioning for deaf and hard-of-hearing passengers. Audio-video on demand (AVOD) entertainment has also been introduced. This enables passengers to pause, rewind, fast-forward, or stop a program that they have been watching. This is in contrast to older entertainment systems where no interactivity is provided for. AVOD also allows the passengers to choose among movies stored in the aircraft computer system. In addition to the personal televisions that are installed in the seatbacks, a new portable media player (PMP) revolution is under way. There are two types available: commercial off the shelf (COTS) based players and proprietary players. PMPs can be handed out and collected by the cabin crew, or can be \\"semi-embedded\\" into the seatback or seat arm. In both of these scenarios, the PMP can pop in and out of an enclosure built into the seat, or an arm enclosure. An advantage of PMPs is that, unlike seatback PTVs, equipment boxes for the inflight entertainment system do not need to be installed under the seats, since those boxes increase the weight of the aircraft and impede legroom. =In-flight movies= Personal on-demand videos are stored in an aircraft's main in-flight entertainment system, whence they can be viewed on demand by a passenger over the aircraft's built in media server and wireless broadcast system. Along with the on-demand concept comes the ability for the user to pause, rewind, fast forward, or jump to any point in the movie. There are also movies that are shown throughout the aircraft at one time, often on shared overhead screens or a screen in the front of the cabin. More modern aircraft are now allowing Personal Electronic Devices (PEDs) to be used to connect to the on board in- flight entertainment systems. Regularly scheduled in flight movies began to premiere in 1961 on flights from New York to Los Angeles.First in Flight Movie Trivia Library, Tuesday 10 April 2007 The first movie shown was By Love Possessed (1961), starring Lana Turner; it was first shown on July 19, 1961 when TWA showed it to its first-class passengers. =Closed-captioning= Closed captioning technology for deaf and hard-of-hearing passengers started in 2008 with Emirates Airlines. The captions are text streamed along with video and spoken audio and enables passengers to either enable or disable the subtitle/caption language. Closed captioning is capable of streaming various text languages, including Arabic, Chinese, English, French, German, Hindi, Spanish, and Russian. The technology is currently based on Scenarist file multiplexing so far; however, portable media players tend to use alternative technologies. A WAEA technical committee is trying to standardize the closed caption specification. In 2009, the US Department of Transportation ruled a compulsory use of captions of all videos, DVDs, and other audio-visual displays played for safety and/or informational purposes in aircraft should be high-contrast captioned (e.g., white letters on a consistent black background [14 CFR Part 382/ RIN 2105‚ÄìAD41 /OST Docket No. 2006‚Äì23999]). As of 2013, several airlines, including *United Airlines, *Qantas *Southwest * and Emirates, have closed-captioning provided on their AVOD systems. In-flight games Video games are another emerging facet of in-flight entertainment. Some game systems are networked to allow interactive playing by multiple passengers. Later generations of IFE games began to shift focus from pure entertainment to learning. The best examples of this changing trend are the popular trivia game series and the Berlitz Word Traveler that allows passengers to learn a new language in their own language. Appearing as a mixture of lessons and mini games, passengers can learn the basics of a new language while being entertained. Many more learning applications continue to appear in the IFE market. Islamic prayers and directions to Mecca In several airlines from the Muslim world the AVOD systems provide Qibla directions to allow Muslims to pray toward Mecca (e.g. Emirates, Turkish Airlines, Pakistan International Airlines, Etihad Airways, Malaysia Airlines, Qatar Airways, Royal Jordanian and Saudia); Malaysia Airlines has built-in Qur'an e-books and Garuda Indonesia has a unique Qur'an channel. Emirates also has built-in complete audio Qur'an. In-flight connectivity In recent years, IFE has been expanded to include in-flight connectivity‚Äîservices such as Internet browsing, text messaging, cell phone usage (where permitted), and emailing. In fact, some in the airline industry have begun referring to the entire in-flight-entertainment category as \\"IFEC\\" (In-Flight Entertainment and Connectivity or In-Flight Entertainment and Communication). The airline manufacturer Boeing entered into the in-flight-connectivity industry in 2000 and 2001 with an offshoot called Connexion by Boeing. The service was designed to provide in-flight broadband service to commercial airlines; Boeing built partnerships with United Airlines, Delta, and American. By 2006, however, the company announced it was closing down its Connexion operation. Industry analysts cited technology, weight, and cost issues as making the service unfeasible at the time. The Connexion hardware that needed to be installed on an aircraft, for example, weighed nearly , which added more \\"drag\\" (a force working against the forward movement of the plane) and weight than was tolerable for the airlines. Since the shuttering of Connexion by Boeing, several new providers have emerged to deliver in-flight broadband to airlines‚Äînotably Row 44, OnAir and AeroMobile (who offer satellite-based solutions), and Aircell (which offers air-to-ground connectivity via a cellular signal). In the past few years, many US commercial airlines have begun testing and deploying in-flight connectivity for their passengers, such as Alaska Airlines, American, Delta, and United. Industry expectations were that by the end of 2011, thousands of planes flying in the US will offer some form of in-flight broadband to passengers. Airlines around the world are also beginning to test in-flight-broadband offerings as well. Satellite and internal telephony Now, airlines provide satellite telephones integrated into their system. These are either found at strategic locations in the aircraft or integrated into the passenger remote control used for the individual in-flight entertainment. Passengers can use their credit card to make phone calls anywhere on the ground. A rate close to US$10.00/minute is usually charged regardless of where the recipient is located and a connection fee may be applied even if the recipient does not answer. These systems are usually not capable of receiving incoming calls. There are also some aircraft that allow faxes to be sent and the rate is usually the same as the call rate, but at a per page rate. Some systems also allow the transmission of SMS. More modern systems allow passengers to call fellow passengers located in another seat by simply keying in the recipient's seat number. Data communication IFE producers have begun to introduce Intranet type systems. Virgin America's, Virgin Atlantic's and Virgin Australia's Entertainment Systems allow for passengers to chat amongst one another, compete against each other in the provided games, talk to the flight attendants and request, and pay for in advance, food or drinks, and have full access to the internet and email. Other full service airlines such as China Airlines have launched IFEs with similar functionalities on board their Boeing 777 and Airbus A350 aircraft. Wi- Fi Several airlines are testing in-cabin wi-fi systems.List of airlines offering inflight wifi eDreams Blog Thursday 22 August 2014 In-flight internet service is provided either through a satellite network or an air-to-ground network.In-flight Internet: Grounded for life?

Can I get on-line in the new Airbus A380? Airport WiFi Guide, Monday 25 June 2007 Boeing's cancellation of the Connexion by Boeing system in 2006 caused concerns that inflight internet would not be available on next- generation aircraft such as Qantas's fleet of Airbus A380s and Boeing Dreamliner 787s. However, Qantas announced in July 2007 that all service classes in its fleet of A380s would have wireless internet access as well as seat-back access to email and cached web browsing when the Airbuses started operations in October 2008. Certain elements were also retrofitted into existing Boeing 747-400s. Sixteen major U.S. airlines now offer Wi-Fi connectivity service on their aircraft. The majority of these airlines use the service provided by Gogo Wi-Fi service. The service allows for Wi-Fi enabled devices to connect to the Internet. Delta currently has the most Wi-Fi equipped fleet with 500 aircraft that now offer in-flight Wi-Fi.Airlines In- flight WiFi Access Fees Table Airport WiFi Guide, Saturday 21 August 2010 In 2019, some airlines removed seatback screens, saving money by streaming video to passenger personal mobile devices. Mobile phone As a general rule, mobile phone use while airborne is usually not just prohibited by the carrier, but also by regulatory agencies in the relevant jurisdiction (e.g. FAA and FCC in the US). However, with added technology, some carriers nonetheless allow the use of mobile phones on selected routes. Emirates became the first airline to allow mobile phones to be used during flight. Using the systems supplied by telecom company AeroMobile, Emirates launched the service commercially on 20 March 2008. Installed first on an Airbus A340-300, AeroMobile is presently operating across the entire Emirates fleet of Boing 777s and Airbus A380s. Ryanair had previously aimed to become the first airline to enable mobile phone usage in the air, but instead ended up launching its system commercially in February 2009. The system is set up on 22 737-800 jets based at Dublin Airport and was fitted on Ryanair's 200+ fleet off 737-800 jets by 2010. OnAir offers inflight mobile connectivity to a range of airlines through its GSM network. The GSM network connects to the ground infrastructure via an Inmarsat SwiftBroadband satellite which provides consistent global coverage. Virgin Australia also has an onboard Wi-Fi service, free on all domestic flights but paid based on time usage aboard international flights. China Airlines and Singapore Airlines also have similar Wi-Fi services, paid in a similar way to Virgin Australia's service.  Backbone connectivity  While SpaceX and OneWeb are testing low Earth orbit satellites, with Amazon seeking approval for more, and companies like AeroVironment are working on HAPS prototypes, aircraft-based connectivity upstarts like Simi Valley, AWN or Aeronet Global Communications Services are dwindling down.

Van Damme plays a paratrooper legionnaire. When his brother is seriously injured, he returns to Los Angeles to enter the underground fighting circuit to raise money for his brother's family. The film's cast and crew included two people who had appeared in an earlier Van Damme film: Michel Qissi (a good friend of his) and Sheldon Lettich. This was the second time Qissi played a villain in a Van Damme film, the first being notably as Tong Po in Kickboxer (1989). Lettich helped write one of Van Damme's breakthrough films, Bloodsport, along with another Van Damme film, Double Impact. The film grossed $24.3 million on a $6 million budget. Plot Lyon Gaultier is in the French Foreign Legion, stationed in Djibouti, North Africa. His brother, who is married to an American in Los Angeles, is set on fire during a drug deal gone bad. He is badly burned and taken to intensive care where he screams out his brothers name over and over - \\"Lyon!\\". Lyon is a convict serving out his sentence in the French Foreign Legion. He receives a letter from his sister- in-law asking him to come back to L.A. as his brother is dying. He escapes the Legion in a daring break out after senior officers try to imprison him and stop him returning to see his brother.

Joshua calls Lyon \\"the Lion - King of the Jungle\\" based on his unusual name. Joshua takes Lyon to meet a person called Cynthia, also known as 'The Lady,' who organizes underground fights for the rich elite and she decides to sponsor him - dubbing her new fighter \\"Lionheart\\" Figuring that this would be the best way to earn the money he needs to get to L.A., Lyon fights in another no- holds-barred bare-knuckle fight to finance the trip. His next opponent \\"Sonny\\" has great distain for his opponents kicking his first opponent squarely inone his groin after the fight is all but over and spitting on him once he is left writhing on the floor in pain. Lyon returns the treatment by counterpunching Sonny straight in the groin with one single focused blow after intimidating him into attacking first. After leaving the fight Lyon and Joshua look for a phone but get accosted by a street gang who pull guns and knives. Lyon and Joshua fight them off. Joshua calls in a favour from Cynthia and she gets them both across the states to L.A. Meanwhile Lyon's Legion Commander travels to Paris and finds that Lyon's desertion is ranked at low importance with the LAPD, so the Commandant sends two of his own men to bring Gaultier back. Once in L.A., Lyon goes to the hospital where he finds his brother has died and had done nothing but call for him for weeks up to his death. He is told by the doctor that the culprits of his murder were never caught but that his brother's wife Helen and young daughter Nicole are broke and have a stack of unpaid medical bills. Lyon and Joshua track down Helen's address. She refuses to accept any financial aid from Lyon, even though she obviously needs it, because she is angry with Lyon for \\"deserting\\" his brother years ago and blames him for his involvement in drugs. She threatens to call the cops and Lyon leaves. To help their financial situation Lyon agrees with Cynthia to continue fighting in the L.A. street fighting circuit but spurns her repeated advances - which angers her. Lyon next fights a martial artist similar to his own style of Taekwondo / Muai Thai in a mostly drained swimming pool eventually beating him with an elbow uppercut to the jaw which knocks his opponent unconscious in the shallow water from which Lyon drags him out. Later on he fights a wrestler in a squash court in a different match up. Just as the wrestler picks Lyon up head high to body slam him he manages to elbow him in the head whereupon the wrestler drops him allowing him to be perform a series of side piercing kicks - the last sending the wrestler through the viewing glass on the back wall. Since Helen refuses to interact with Lyon, Joshua poses as an insurance agent and gives her the winnings in the form of checks, which they claim are from a life insurance policy her husband had. Cynthia is angered that Lyon isn't keeping the money and becomes suspicious of his motives and possibly jealous of Helen. Lyon's next fight involves a proud Scotsman (complete with ceremonial kilt). The fight takes place in a garage with the ring being illuminated by prestige car headlights. Lyon gets distracted by the Scotsman and changes his fighting style to match and ends up using all his energy clambering over the cars and trading blow for blow with his opponent. However the Scotsman is similarly exhausted and all Lyon needs to do at the end of the fight is to let him fall out of his hands. Two Legionnaires sent from the desert catch up with Lyon in Los Angeles after staking out his sister-in-law's apartment. Lyon fights them off, but suffers a broken rib. He is saved from the fight when Cynthia's assistant (who has been tracking him) arrives and takes him away. Cynthia meets with the Legionnaires and shows them a tape of a fighter named \\"Attila,\\" and says that she has booked Lyon a fight with him. Attila is undefeated and appears to permanently disable his opponents with callous finishing moves. Cynthia agrees to hand Lyon over to the Legionnaires after the fight. In order to skew the odds, Cynthia arranges a meeting with potential betters where she shows an altered tape of Attila which makes him look like a poor fighter. Just prior to the fight, Joshua realizes Lyon is hurt. He encourages him not to fight and recalls a time when he was a fighter and Cynthia set him up similarly, but Lyon ignores him and is determined to win the money to take Helen and Nicole away. Lyon has already placed his stake on the fight, but Joshua is torn whether he should bet on Lyon or Attila. As the fight proceeds, Lyon is obviously hurt by his rib which Attila takes full advantage of. However Lyon refuses to be intimidated by Attila's strength and brutal fighting style which infuriates him. When it appears Attila has won after knocking him down yet again Joshua begs Lyon to give up and tells him he bet on Attila because he feared Lyon would lose and become hurt. Lyon, angered by this news, summons his remaining strength to defeat Attila stating to Joshua he has made the \\"Wrong bet!\\". He manages to perform a series of jump turning kicks followed by a trademark Van Damme jump spin kick in split position. Eventually we see the two fighting in the crowd where Lyon badly pummels Attila but fortunately Lyon backs off before killing him as we are reminded that Lyon has learnt his fighting technique in military service not in the ring. Cynthia is ruined and is apprehended by the bookies as she put her entire fortune on Attila. And Lyon is taken into custody by the Legionnaires after making amends with Joshua. They take him back to the apartment to say goodbye to his family before returning to Africa, where he will be court-martialed for desertion. Once they drive away, though, they stop and tell Lyon to get out, wishing him luck as he has fought bravely and he has a family to care for now. He runs back to his family and Joshua, who embrace him.

While we were filming the scene in Lionheart where he takes a shower in Cynthia's apartment, he asked me if he might casually \\"drop his towel\\" and show off his butt for a brief moment. My reply was \\"Sure, if you're willing, why not? We can always use a different take later if we decide it's not a good idea.\\" So we did one take where he casually lets the towel drop away, and then we later decided to go ahead and put that shot in the movie. Well, that became a very memorable moment for the ladies in the audience, and for the gay guys as well. Showing off his butt (clothed or unclothed) almost became a signature trademark of his after that.  Reception  The critical reception for the film was negative. On the film aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, it holds an approval rating of 31% based on 16 reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of \\"B+\\" on an A+ to F scale. Box office Lionheart performed well at the box office, debuting in 3rd position in the US with sales of about $7 million. The film dropped to 7th in its second week, and to 9th in its third.

The uprising was not centrally coordinated; rather, it was attempted by multiple factions ‚Äì among them Sunni, Druze, Alawite, Christian, and Shia ‚Äì with the common goal of ending French rule. The revolt was ultimately put down by French forces. Background In 1918, towards the end of World War I, the Ottoman Empire's forces withdrew from Syria after being defeated by the Allied Powers (Great Britain and France) and their Hashemite Arab allies from the Hejaz. The British had promised the Hashemites control over a united Arab state consisting of the bulk of Arabic-speaking lands from which the Ottomans withdrew, even as the Allies made other plans for the region in the 1916 Sykes‚ÄìPicot Agreement. The idea of Syrian and Arab independence were not entirely new concepts.Khoury, 1981, pp. 442-444. French forces entering Syria faced resistance from local factions in the north in 1919, with the prominent Alawite sheikh Saleh al-Ali launching a revolt in the coastal mountain range and Ibrahim Hananu leading a revolt in Aleppo and the surrounding countryside. The leaders of both uprisings were supportive of the creation of a united Syrian state presided over by Emir Faisal, the son of Sharif Husayn.Moosa, p. 282. In March 1920 the Hashemites officially established the Kingdom of Syria with Faisal as king and the capital in Damascus. In the April 1920 San Remo Conference, the Allies were granted control over the Ottoman Empire's former Arab territories by the newly formed League of Nations, with Britain taking control of Palestine, Transjordan and Iraq, while France took control of Syria. This transfer of authority from the Ottomans to the French was generally unwelcome to Greater Syria's inhabitants, with the exception of some of the local Christian communities, particularly the Maronites of Mount Lebanon.Betts, pp. 84-85. The brief Franco-Syrian War saw the Hashemites' pan-Arab forces defeated by the French in the Battle of Maysalun on 23 July, and the kingdom dissolved. France then divided the country into several autonomous entities: State of Damascus, State of Aleppo, Greater Lebanon, Alawite State and Jabal Druze State.Betts, p. 86. But many nationalists remained in Syria, advocating for independence. There was disquiet, even in Britain, when France claimed Lebanon and Syria as \\"colonies\\". Druze in Suwayda welcoming Sultan al-Atrash and other rebels back from exile in 1937 Causes=Alienation of the elite One major reason behind the outbreak of the Great Syrian Revolt was the French relationship with the local elites. The Ottoman Empire, especially in its final centuries, had allowed much authority to devolve to the local level with many day-to-day administrative functions carried out by local notables. The Ottoman millet system allowed local peoples of different religious affiliations to uphold their own legal standards (for example, sharia law applying to Muslims, but not Jews, Catholics, or Orthodox Christians). The European powers, however, had little grasp of the intricacies of Ottoman government, and failed to recognize that the disappearance of national authority did not mean that administration ceased to exist on a local level. In the Mandate of Syria, the French assumed that the Syrians were incapable of practicing self-government, and so instituted a system which ostensibly served to train Syrians in that responsibility. French administrators were assigned to all levels of government, and their role was, officially, to train Syrian counterparts in that particular function. The reality of the situation was very different. Instead of teaching, the advisors performed the functions of that office.Gouraud, Henri. La France En Syrie. [Corbeil]: [Imp. Cr√©t√©], 1922: 15 The effect was local rulers who resented being treated as if they did not know how to perform the functions they had been performing for centuries and who opposed this usurpation of their power. Further, authority had traditionally resided in the hands of a few families, while European administrators abandoned the systems of caste and class, undermining this elite by opening up offices to the general public. Loyalty of tribes Outside of cities, the French were not entirely successful in winning over nomadic populations, many of whom raised the standard of revolt in 1925.Khoury, Philip S. \\"The Tribal Shaykh, French Tribal Policy, and the Nationalist Movement in Syria between Two World Wars.\\" Middle Eastern Studies 18.2 (1982): 184 The Ottoman Empire had initiated the process of tribal sedentarization, but it was not until the French Mandate of Syria that tribes began to lose their nomadic lifestyle. After World War I, the territory that tribes wandered was divided between Turkey, the Mandate of Syria, and the Mandate of Mesopotamia, each controlled by different powers, thereby limiting their freedom of movement. In Syria, the process of industrialization was swift; roads were quickly built, cars and buses became commonplace. The situation for nomads was exacerbated by an influx of Armenians and Kurds from the new country of Turkey, who settled in the Mandate's northern regions. To pacify, or at least control, the tribes, the French instituted several restrictive measures; for example, tribes could not carry arms in settled areas, and had to pay lump taxes on livestock.Khoury, Philip S. \\"The Tribal Shaykh, French Tribal Policy, and the Nationalist Movement in Syria between Two World Wars.\\" Middle Eastern Studies 18.2 (1982): 185 Additionally, the French attempted to bribe tribal leaders; but while this worked in some cases, it caused resentment in others. When the Great Syrian Revolt broke out in 1925, thousands of tribesmen were eager to fight against the French. Nationalist sentiment Syrian nationalism was fostered in Faisal's short-lived kingdom, but after its dissolution many nationalists affiliated with his government fled the country to avoid death sentences, arrest and harassment by the French. Some went to Amman, where they found Amir Abdullah sympathetic to their cause; but under increasing pressure from the British, the young Abdullah drove them from Transjordan. These rejoined other Syrian nationalists at Cairo In 1921, when the Syrian- Palestinian Congress was founded. In 1925, in preparation for upcoming elections, high commissioner General Maurice Sarrail allowed the organization of political parties. The Syrian-Palestinian Congress had proved itself an ineffectual body, and its Syrian factions returned to Syria. They founded the People's Party in Damascus, which was characterized by an intelligentsia leadership antagonistic toward local elites, with no social or economic programs, with support organized around individuals. Though unprepared for and not expecting an uprising, the nationalist elements in Damascus were eager to participate when one arose. Mistreatment of the Druze population The spark that ignited the Great Syrian Revolt was French treatment of the Druze population. In 1923, the leaders of Jabal al-Druze, a region in the southeast of the Mandate of Syria, had come to an agreement with French authorities, hoping for the same degree of autonomy they had enjoyed under the Ottoman Empire. Druze society was governed by a council of notables, the majlis, who selected one of their number to a limited executive position. Traditionally, this role had been dominated by the al-Atrash family since the defeat of the Lebanese Druze in 1860. But in 1923, shortly after the agreement made with the French, Selim al-Atrash resigned. Seizing upon the disunity of the al-Atrash family in selecting a successor, the majlis struck at their power by choosing a French officer of the Service des Renseignements, Captain Cabrillet. Though he was initially only appointed for three months, later his term was extended indefinitely. Captain Cabrillet embarked upon a series of successful modernization reforms, but in the process, he collected Druze taxes in full, disarmed the population, and used the forced labor of prisoners and peasants, upsetting a significant part of the population. In the meantime, Sultan al- Atrash, the most ambitious member of the al-Atrash family, sent a delegation to Beirut to inform the French High Commissioner, General Maurice Sarrail, that Captain Cabrillet's actions were antagonizing most of the Druze population. Instead of hearing the delegates, Sarrail imprisoned them. Upon hearing of this, the Druze returned their support to the al-Atrash family, which by this point was backing Sultan al-Atrash, and rebelled against the French (and indirectly against the majlis, who had elevated them to power). Revolution On August 23, 1925 Sultan Pasha al-Atrash officially declared revolution against France. Calling upon Syria's various ethnic and religious communities to oppose the foreign domination of their land, al-Atrash managed to enlist the aid of large sections of the population in a revolt that now spread throughout Syria, led by such notable figures as Hassan al-Kharrat, Nasib al-Bakri, Abd al-Rahman Shahbandar and Fawzi al-Qawuqji. Fighting began with the Battle of al-Kafr on July 22, 1925, the Battle of al-Mazra'a on August 2‚Äì3, 1925, and the subsequent battles of Salkhad, al-Musayfirah and Suwayda. After initial rebel victories against the French, France sent thousands of troops to Syria and Lebanon from Morocco and Senegal, equipped with modern weapons, compared to the meager supplies of the rebels. This dramatically altered the results and allowed the French to regain many cities, although fierce resistance lasted until the spring of 1927. The French sentenced Sultan al-Atrash and other national leaders to death, but al-Atrash escaped with the rebels to Transjordan and was eventually pardoned. In 1937, after the signing of the Franco-Syrian Treaty, he returned to Syria where he was met with a huge public reception. Course of the war Initially, the French were ill-equipped to respond to the outbreak of violence. In 1925, the number of French troops in the Mandate of Syria was at its lowest ever, numbering only 14,397 men and officers, with an additional 5,902 Syrian auxiliaries, down from 70,000 in 1920. In 1924, the French representative reporting to the Permanent Mandates Commission in 1924 wrote that ‚Äúthe little state of Djebel-Druze [is] of small importance and [has] only about 50,000 inhabitants.‚ÄùLeague of Nations, Permanent Mandates Commission, Minutes of the Fourth Session (Geneva, 1924), p. 31 Consequently, the Druze, when they revolted in September 1925 met with great success, and after a series of victories, including the annihilation of a French relief column, captured the fort at al-Suwayda. Instead of engaging the Druze in the winter, the French decided to temporarily withdraw, a decision noted by the new high commissioner, Henry de Jouvenel, to be a tactical error, as it underrepresented French military strength and encouraged a regional rebellion to achieve national dimensions. Indeed, the weak immediate response of the French invited the intervention of disaffected local elite, tribesmen, and loosely connected nationalists based in Damascus. First to seize upon the opportunity presented by the revolt were the nomadic tribes, who used the absence of French authority ‚Äì troops had been drawn away to concentrate on the rebelling region ‚Äì to prey upon farmers and merchants, thereby creating an atmosphere of sympathy for the rebellious Druze. The nationalists seized upon the Druze revolt in relatively short order, forging an alliance with Sultan al-Atrash within six weeks of the uprising's commencement, and establishing a National Provisional Government in Jabal-Druze with al-Atrash as President and Dr. Abd al-Rahman Shahbandar, leader of the People's Party, as Vice President.Khoury, 1981, pp. 453-455. Rebel commander Fakhri al-Kharrat, son of Hasan al-Kharrat, hanged by the French in January 1926. In response to the outbreak of violence, Jouvenal declared free and popular elections for every area that had not been affected by the rebellion in the beginning of 1926.Miller, 1977, pp. 560-562. Most elections were held peacefully. However, in two cities, Homs and Hama, the local elites refused to allow elections to be held. A two-day uprising led by Fawzi al-Qawuqji and largely supported by the local population occurred in Hama on 4‚Äì5 October 1925. This was followed in September 1926 by a full-fledged insurrection. French forces rushed to put down the new threat, which gave the rebellion added life elsewhere. At the time, the lack of troops meant that for the French to focus on Homs and Hama, they had to neglect other regions, allowing the revolt to spread.Bou-Nacklie, N.E. \\"Tumult in Syria's Hama in 1925: The Failure of a Revolt.\\" Journal of Contemporary History 33.2 (1998): 274 Within two months the Homs-Hama region fell, but the conflict there bought rebels elsewhere much-needed breathing room, and taught the rebels in Damascus a valuable lesson about troop placement. Despite the revolts in Homs and Hama, the turn-out for the elections suggested to the French that the Syrian people had a desire for peace; in the rural areas around Homs and Hama, where no violence was reported, voter turn-out was 95%. Further, it revealed that many of the belligerents were local elites, and when full amnesty was again offered in February 1926, the entire country, with the exception of Jebal-Druze and Damascus, was pacified. The lessons the rebels learned from Homs and Hama were many, and that sustained the rebellion for a further year and a half.Bou- Nacklie, N.E. \\"Tumult in Syria's Hama in 1925: The Failure of a Revolt.\\" Journal of Contemporary History 33.2 (1998): 288-289 Homs and Hama were lost because the rebels concentrated their forces in the face of overwhelming French firepower, because they fortified their position and waited for the French to arrive, and because they made no attempt to sever French lines of communication.Bou-Nacklie, N.E. \\"Tumult in Syria's Hama in 1925: The Failure of a Revolt.\\" Journal of Contemporary History 33.2 (1998): 289 In Damascus, the rebels were dispersed, so that no random artillery fire would defeat them. Further, when the Druze attacked Damascus, they did so from several directions. Both groups repeatedly cut French lines of communication, and while the French suffered few difficulties in restoring them, the psychological effect the destruction had on them was significant. Despite the breadth of the rebellion and the initial rebel successes, the persistence of the French made its defeat inevitable. By early 1926, they had increased their troop numbers to 50,000, roughly the size of the total Druze population.Khoury, Philip S. \\"Factionalism Among Syrian Nationalists During the French Mandate.\\" International Journal of Middle East Studies 13.04 (1981): 461 By spring, much of Damascus had been destroyed by artillery fire, and the nationalist leadership had been forced into exile. In the spring of the following year, the Druze were decisively defeated, and Sultan al-Atrash went into exile in Transjordan to escape the death penalty. Aftermath Damascus in flames after High Commissioner Sarrail gave orders to shell the city The Great Syrian Revolt, while a loss for the rebels, did result in changes in the French attitude toward imperialism in the Levant. Direct rule was believed to be too costly, and in Syria, the threat of military intervention was replaced with diplomatic negotiation. A softer approach to Syrian rule was taken, and in March 1928, just a year after the rebellion was put down, a general amnesty was announced for Syrian rebels. A small addendum was attached, decreeing that the rebellion's leadership, including Sultan al- Atrash and Dr. Shahbandar, would not be allowed to return. The impact on Syria itself was profoundly negative. At least 6,000 rebels were killed, and over 100,000 people were left homeless, a fifth of whom made their way to Damascus. After two years of war, the city was ill-equipped to deal with the influx of displaced Syrians, and Hama was similarly devastated. Across Syria, towns and farms had suffered significant damage, and agriculture and commerce temporarily ceased. Legacy The Great Syrian Revolt is a widely remembered and commemorated event in Syria, and its leaders are remembered and respected by Syrians. Sultan Pasha al-Atrash, the leader of the revolt, is a national hero in Syria, and a widely respected symbol of patriotism and nationalism among many Syrians, most notably the Druze. During the period of Syrian- Egyptian unity, on a visit to Suwayda province President Gamal Abdel Nasser honored Sultan Pasha al-Atrash by awarding him the highest medal of the United Arab Republic, similarly, in 1970, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad honored Sultan Pasha al-Atrash for his historic role in the Syrian Revolution. His funeral, in 1982, was attended by over one million people and the president of Syria, Hafez al-Assad, who issued an individual letter mourning al-Atrash.

The procedure is generally performed by a urologist, typically if testicular cancer is suspected. Often it is performed as same-day surgery, with the patient returning home within hours of the procedure. Some patients elect to have a prosthetic testicle inserted into their scrotum. Depending on whether or not a prosthetic testicle is put in place of the original one, operating times run on average from three to six hours. A 4‚Äì6 cm incision is made above the pubic bone on the side corresponding to the testicle to be removed. This incision runs obliquely midway between the pubic tubercle and the anterior superior iliac spine. The incision is extended down through the fat until the external oblique fascia is encountered. It is incised along its fibres and the spermatic cord is identified and isolated. From there, the testicle is pulled into the field through the inguinal canal. The spermatic cord is clamped off in two places and cut between the clamps. Long permanent sutures, usually silk or polypropylene, are left on the stump of the spermatic cord as a marker in case it needs to be removed in the future during a retroperitoneal lymph node dissection (RPLND). The inguinal orchiectomy is a necessary procedure if testicular cancer is suspected. While it is possible to remove a testicle through an incision in the scrotum, this is not done when cancer is suspected because it disrupts the natural lymphatic drainage patterns. Testicular cancer usually spreads into the lymph nodes inside the abdomen in a predictable manner. Cutting the skin in the scrotum may disrupt this and cancer may spread to the inguinal lymph nodes, making surveillance and subsequent operations more difficult. Complications from this procedure include bleeding and infection. The ilioinguinal nerve which runs anterior to the spermatic cord may be damaged during the operation and cause numbness over the inner thigh or chronic groin and scrotal pain. Other symptoms also include intermittent and chronic back pain and sudden loss of mobility in the lower back. If the orchiectomy is performed to diagnose cancer, the testicle and spermatic cord are then sent to a pathologist to determine the makeup of the tumor, and the extent of spread within the testicle and cord. The pathology report, along with pre-surgical imaging studies and tumor markers, will determine the course of treatment.

It was implemented in the UK by casino game designer Geoff Hall, inventor of Blackjack Switch and currently has more than 60 members of staff. The network works using a skin- based system. This simply means that each site on the network has its own skin of the underlying poker interface; the lobby, table layout and design are all exactly the same. However, each site can apply its own colour scheme and branding. Most importantly in order to maintain the liquidity needed to operate a successful poker network, each of these skins shares the same player pool. As of April 2014 the network had 30 active skins.

Alain is at a funeral that is being held for a fellow cop, when Alain's partner Sebastien (Jean-Hugues Anglade) shows up, and requests for his presence at a crime scene. When they arrive, Sebastien shows Alain a dead body of someone that looks exactly like him. They discover that his name was Mikhail Suvorov, who was born on exactly the same day Alain was. As it turns out, Mikhail is the twin brother Alain never knew he had. Tracing his brother's steps back to New York City, Alain discovers that Mikhail was a member of the Russian Mafia, who was chased down and killed when he attempted to get out. Of course, now Alain is mistaken for Mikhail, who was also mixed up in a series of affairs concerning the FBI and the Russian mafia. With his only real ally being Mikhail's fianc√© Alex Bartlett (Natasha Henstridge), Alain sets out to avenge his brother's death, which is complicated not only by the Mafia, but by two corrupt FBI agents.

They are located in a national nature reserve about south east of Withypool and north west of Dulverton. A typical clapper bridge construction, the bridge's listing assesses it as medieval in origin. The stone slabs weigh up to two tons each. The bridge is long and has 17 spans. It has been designated by English Heritage as a grade I listed building and Scheduled Ancient Monument. Nature Reserve Owned by Exmoor National Park Authority, Tarr Steps Woodland National Nature Reserve covers 33 hectares of the River Barle valley. This is mainly sessile oak (Quercus petraea) woodland, with beech (Fagus), ash, sycamore (Acer pseudoplatanus), hazel (Corylus), blackberry (Rubus), bluebells (Hyacinthoides non-scripta) and honeysuckle (Lonicera). It is internationally significant for the mosses, liverworts and lichens which flourish in the cool damp conditions. Much of the woodland was once coppiced, primarily to provide charcoal for the local iron smelting industry. The river and the valley woodlands are part of the Barle Valley Site of Special Scientific Interest and abound with wildlife, ranging from red deer to dormice, including the rare Barbastelle Bat (Barbastella barbastellus) and otter that feed along the unpolluted and fast-flowing river. Well marked footpaths run along the valley between Simonsbath and Dulverton and to the village of Withypool. There is a circular walk from the main car park for Tarr Steps down to the river, along the riverbank for about to a footbridge and returning on the other side, crossing the river on the clapper bridge. The main car park and toilets (some from the bridge via a footpath) can be reached from the B3223 road between Withypool and Dulverton. Parking for the disabled and refreshments are available nearer the bridge, as are information panels put up by the Exmoor National Park, giving details of Tarr Steps history and design. Bridge Tarr Steps from river right Within the reserve is the scheduled monument Tarr Steps , a clapper bridge over the River Barle. The name \\"clapper bridge\\" comes from the Medieval Latin \\"claperius\\" which means \\"pile of stones\\". It is an ancient form of bridge constructed with large unmortared slabs of stone resting on one another; this is the largest example of its type. There are 17 spans across , the top slabs weigh 1-2 tons and are about above normal water level. The largest slab is over long and is about wide. This is one of the best known monuments on Exmoor. Its age is unknown, as several theories claim that Tarr Steps dates from the Bronze Age but others date them from around 1400 AD. It has been restored several times in recent years, following flood damage. Over the years the damage provides a good indicator of the strength of each flood. Some of the top slabs have been washed away in extreme flood conditions and they have now all been numbered to facilitate replacement. The Exmoor National Park web site says ‚ÄúThe stones forming the spans weigh between one and two tons each and have on occasions been washed up to downstream. A distinctive feature of Tarr Steps is the slabs that are raked against the ends of each pier to break the force of the river and divert floating debris. Despite this, much of the damage has been due to debris such as branches floating down with the flood and battering the bridge. Debris used to be removed once a year by farmers from the Dulverton and Hawkridge sides of the river but since the flood of 1952 it has been trapped by cables strung across the river upstream of the bridge\\". The bridge was badly damaged by floodwater on 22 December 2012 when steel wires upstream (designed to protect the bridge from damaging debris) were broken by fallen trees washed down the river. Floodwaters carried away part of the bridge again on 21 November 2016, and it has since been rebuilt.

From 1941 to 1948 he was - together with Hans Iacob Schou - co-editor, from 1948 to 1950 and again 1952 single editor of the journal Epilepsia of the ILAE. From 1936 to 1937 he served as first president of the American League Against Epilepsy, which later became the American Epilepsy Society (AES). In 1951 he described a special epilepsy syndrome,Lennox WG, Davis JP. Clinical correlates of the fast and the slow spike-wave electroencephalogram. Pediatrics 1950; 5: 626‚Äì644 later on named after him and the french neurologist and epileptologist Henri Gastaut Lennox-Gastaut syndrome. Lennox was also involved with the eugenics movement. He gave a speech in 1938 to Harvard's Phi Beta Kappa, recommending euthanasia for \\"the congenitally mindless and for the incurable sick who wish to die\\". In the same year, he wrote \\"The principle of limiting certain races through limitation of off-spring might be applied internationally as well as intranationally.\\" In 1943, Lennox joined the advisory council of the Euthanasia Society of America (later known as Partnership for Caring). In 1950, he wrote an article entitled \\"The Moral Issue\\", calling for the mercy killing of \\"children with undeveloped or misformed brains\\" as a way of opening up space in \\"our hopelessly clogged institutions.\\" He continued working into his 70s, only retiring from Harvard in 1958.

General related fields * Machine vision * Computer vision * Image processing * Signal processing 0-9 * 1394. FireWire is Apple Inc.'s brand name for the IEEE 1394 interface. It is also known as i.Link (Sony's name) or IEEE 1394 (although the 1394 standard also defines a backplane interface). It is a personal computer (and digital audio/digital video) serial bus interface standard, offering high-speed communications and isochronous real-time data services. * 1D. One-dimensional. * 2D computer graphics. The computer-based generation of digital images‚Äîmostly from two-dimensional models (such as 2D geometric models, text, and digital images) and by techniques specific to them. 3D rendering example * 3D computer graphics. 3D computer graphics are different from 2D computer graphics in that a three-dimensional representation of geometric data is stored in the computer for the purposes of performing calculations and rendering 2D images. Such images may be for later display or for real-time viewing. Despite these differences, 3D computer graphics rely on many of the same algorithms as 2D computer vector graphics in the wire frame model and 2D computer raster graphics in the final rendered display. In computer graphics software, the distinction between 2D and 3D is occasionally blurred; 2D applications may use 3D techniques to achieve effects such as lighting, and primarily 3D may use 2D rendering techniques. 3D-laser-scanner mounted on a tripod * 3D scanner. This is a device that analyzes a real-world object or environment to collect data on its shape and possibly color. The collected data can then be used to construct digital, three dimensional models useful for a wide variety of applications. A * Aberration. Optically, defocus refers to a translation along the optical axis away from the plane or surface of best focus. In general, defocus reduces the sharpness and contrast of the image. What should be sharp, high-contrast edges in a scene become gradual transitions. * Aperture. In context of photography or machine vision, aperture refers to the diameter of the aperture stop of a photographic lens. The aperture stop can be adjusted to control the amount of light reaching the film or image sensor. * aspect ratio (image). The aspect ratio of an image is its displayed width divided by its height (usually expressed as \\"x:y\\"). * Angular resolution. Describes the resolving power of any image forming device such as an optical or radio telescope, a microscope, a camera, or an eye. * Automated optical inspection. B \\"Wikipedia\\" encoded in Code 128-B * Barcode. A barcode (also bar code) is a machine-readable representation of information in a visual format on a surface. * Blob discovery. Inspecting an image for discrete blobs of connected pixels (e.g. a black hole in a grey object) as image landmarks. These blobs frequently represent optical targets for machining, robotic capture, or manufacturing failure. * Bitmap. A raster graphics image, digital image, or bitmap, is a data file or structure representing a generally rectangular grid of pixels, or points of color, on a computer monitor, paper, or other display device. C Relation between Computer vision and various other fields * Camera. A camera is a device used to take pictures, either singly or in sequence. A camera that takes pictures singly is sometimes called a photo camera to distinguish it from a video camera. * Camera Link. Camera Link is a serial communication protocol designed for computer vision applications based on the National Semiconductor interface Channel-link. It was designed for the purpose of standardizing scientific and industrial video products including cameras, cables and frame grabbers. The standard is maintained and administered by the Automated Imaging Association, or AIA, the global machine vision industry's trade group. * Charge-coupled device. A charge-coupled device (CCD) is a sensor for recording images, consisting of an integrated circuit containing an array of linked, or coupled, capacitors. CCD sensors and cameras tend to be more sensitive, less noisy, and more expensive than CMOS sensors and cameras. The CIE 1931 color space chromaticity diagram. The outer curved boundary is the spectral (or monochromatic) locus, with wavelengths shown in nanometers. Note that the colors depicted depend on the color space of the device on which you are viewing the image, and no device has a gamut large enough to present an accurate representation of the chromaticity at every position. * CIE 1931 Color Space. In the study of the perception of color, one of the first mathematically defined color spaces was the CIE XYZ color space (also known as CIE 1931 color space), created by the International Commission on Illumination (CIE) in 1931. * CMOS. CMOS (\\"see-moss\\")stands for complementary metal-oxide semiconductor, is a major class of integrated circuits. CMOS imaging sensors for machine vision are cheaper than CCD sensors but more noisy. *CoaXPress. CoaXPress (CXP) is an asymmetric high speed serial communication standard over coaxial cable. CoaXPress combines high speed image data, low speed camera control and power over a single coaxial cable. The standard is maintained by JIIA, the Japan Industrial Imaging Association. * Color. The perception of the frequency (or wavelength) of light, and can be compared to how pitch (or a musical note) is the perception of the frequency or wavelength of sound. * Color blindness. Also known as color vision deficiency, in humans is the inability to perceive differences between some or all colors that other people can distinguish * Color temperature. \\"White light\\" is commonly described by its color temperature. A traditional incandescent light source's color temperature is determined by comparing its hue with a theoretical, heated black-body radiator. The lamp's color temperature is the temperature in kelvins at which the heated black-body radiator matches the hue of the lamp. * Color vision. CV is the capacity of an organism or machine to distinguish objects based on the wavelengths (or frequencies) of the light they reflect or emit. * computer vision. The study and application of methods which allow computers to \\"understand\\" image content. * Contrast. In visual perception, contrast is the difference in visual properties that makes an object (or its representation in an image) distinguishable from other objects and the background. * C-Mount. Standardized adapter for optical lenses on CCD - cameras. C-Mount lenses have a back focal distance 17.5 mm vs. 12.5 mm for \\"CS-mount\\" lenses. A C-Mount lens can be used on a CS-Mount camera through the use of a 5 mm extension adapter. C-mount is a 1\\" diameter, 32 threads per inch mounting thread (1\\"-32UN-2A.) * CS-Mount. Same as C-Mount but the focal point is 5 mm shorter. A CS-Mount lens will not work on a C-Mount camera. CS-mount is a 1\\" diameter, 32 threads per inch mounting thread. D \\"Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia\\" encoded in the DataMatrix 2D barcode * Data matrix. A two dimensional Barcode. * Depth of field. In optics, particularly photography and machine vision, the depth of field (DOF) is the distance in front of and behind the subject which appears to be in focus. * Depth perception. DP is the visual ability to perceive the world in three dimensions. It is a trait common to many higher animals. Depth perception allows the beholder to accurately gauge the distance to an object. * Diaphragm. In optics, a diaphragm is a thin opaque structure with an opening (aperture) at its centre. The role of the diaphragm is to stop the passage of light, except for the light passing through the aperture. E * Edge detection. ED marks the points in a digital image at which the luminous intensity changes sharply. It also marks the points of luminous intensity changes of an object or spatial-taxon silhouette. * Electromagnetic interference. Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) is electromagnetic radiation which is emitted by electrical circuits carrying rapidly changing signals, as a by-product of their normal operation, and which causes unwanted signals (interference or noise) to be induced in other circuits. F * FireWire. FireWire (also known as i. Link or IEEE 1394) is a personal computer (and digital audio/video) serial bus interface standard, offering high-speed communications. It is often used as an interface for industrial cameras. * Fixed-pattern noise. * Flat-field correction. * Frame grabber. An electronic device that captures individual, digital still frames from an analog video signal or a digital video stream. * Fringe Projection Technique. 3D data acquisition technique employing projector displaying fringe pattern on a surface of measured piece, and one or more cameras recording image(s). * Field of view. The field of view (FOV) is the part which can be seen by the machine vision system at one moment. The field of view depends from the lens of the system and from the working distance between object and camera. * Focus. An image, or image point or region, is said to be in focus if light from object points is converged about as well as possible in the image; conversely, it is out of focus if light is not well converged. The border between these conditions is sometimes defined via a circle of confusion criterion. G chromaticities. The colored triangle is the gamut available to a typical computer monitor; it does not cover the entire space. * Gamut. In color reproduction, including computer graphics and photography, the gamut, or color gamut , is a certain complete subset of colors. * Grayscale. A grayscale digital image is an image in which the value of each pixel is a single sample. Displayed images of this sort are typically composed of shades of gray, varying from black at the weakest intensity to white at the strongest, though in principle the samples could be displayed as shades of any color, or even coded with various colors for different intensities. * GUI. A graphical user interface (or GUI, sometimes pronounced \\"gooey\\") is a method of interacting with a computer through a metaphor of direct manipulation of graphical images and widgets in addition to text. H A photograph with its luminosity histogram beneath it * Histogram. In statistics, a histogram is a graphical display of tabulated frequencies. A histogram is the graphical version of a table which shows what proportion of cases fall into each of several or many specified categories. The histogram differs from a bar chart in that it is the area of the bar that denotes the value, not the height, a crucial distinction when the categories are not of uniform width (Lancaster, 1974). The categories are usually specified as non-overlapping intervals of some variable. The categories (bars) must be adjacent. * Histogram (Color). In computer graphics and photography, a color histogram is a representation of the distribution of colors in an image, derived by counting the number of pixels of each of given set of color ranges in a typically two-dimensional (2D) or three-dimensional (3D) color space. A histogram is a standard statistical description of a distribution in terms of occurrence frequencies of different event classes; for color, the event classes are regions in color space. HSV color space as a color wheel * HSV color space. The HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) model, also called HSB (Hue, Saturation, Brightness), defines a color space in terms of three constituent components: ** Hue, the color type (such as red, blue, or yellow) ** Saturation, the \\"vibrancy\\" of the color and colorimetric purity ** Value, the brightness of the color I * Image file formats. Image file formats provide a standardized method of organizing and storing image data. This article deals with digital image formats used to store photographic and other image information. Image files are made up of either pixel or vector (geometric) data, which is rasterized to pixels in the display process, with a few exceptions in vector graphic display. The pixels that make up an image are in the form of a grid of columns and rows. Each of the pixels in an image stores digital numbers representing brightness and color. * Image segmentation. Image of a dog taken in mid- infrared (\\"thermal\\") light (false color) * Infrared imaging. See Thermographic camera. * Incandescent light bulb. An incandescent light bulb generates light using a glowing filament heated to white-hot by an electric current. J * JPEG. JPEG (pronounced jay-peg) is a most commonly used standard method of lossy compression for photographic images. K * Kell factor. It is a parameter used to determine the effective resolution of a discrete display device. L * Laser. In physics, a laser is a device that emits light through a specific mechanism for which the term laser is an acronym: light amplification by stimulated emission of radiation. * Lens. A lens is a device that causes light to either converge and concentrate or to diverge, usually formed from a piece of shaped glass. Lenses may be combined to form more complex optical systems as a Normal lens or a Telephoto lens. * Lens Controller. A lens controller is a device used to control a motorized (ZFI) lens. Lens controllers may be internal to a camera, a set of switches used manually, or a sophisticated device that allows control of a lens with a computer. * Lighting. Lighting refers to either artificial light sources such as lamps or to natural illumination. M * Metrology. Metrology is the science of measurement. There are many applications for machine vision in metrology. * machine vision. MV is the application of computer vision to industry and manufacturing. * Motion perception. MP is the process of inferring the speed and direction of objects and surfaces that move in a visual scene given some visual input. N Simplified view of an artificial neural network * Neural network. A NN is an interconnected group of artificial neurons that uses a mathematical or computational model for information processing based on a connectionist approach to computation. In most cases an ANN is an adaptive system that changes its structure based on external or internal information that flows through the network. * Normal lens. In machine vision a normal or entrocentric lens is a lens that generates images that are generally held to have a \\"natural\\" perspective compared with lenses with longer or shorter focal lengths. Lenses of shorter focal length are called wide-angle lenses, while longer focal length lenses are called telephoto lenses. O * Optical character recognition. Usually abbreviated to OCR, involves computer software designed to translate images of typewritten text (usually captured by a scanner) into machine-editable text, or to translate pictures of characters into a standard encoding scheme representing them in (ASCII or Unicode). * Optical resolution. Describes the ability of a system to distinguish, detect, and/or record physical details by electromagnetic means. The system may be imaging (e.g., a camera) or non-imaging (e.g., a quad-cell laser detector). * Optical transfer function. P f/2 * Pattern recognition. This is a field within the area of machine learning. Alternatively, it can be defined as the act of taking in raw data and taking an action based on the category of the data. It is a collection of methods for supervised learning. * Pixel. A pixel is one of the many tiny dots that make up the representation of a picture in a computer's memory or screen. * Pixelation. In computer graphics, pixelation is an effect caused by displaying a bitmap or a section of a bitmap at such a large size that individual pixels, small single-colored square display elements that comprise the bitmap, are visible. * Prime lens. Mechanical assembly of lenses whose focal length is fixed, as opposed to a zoom lens, which has a variable focal length. Q * Q-Factor (Optics). In optics, the Q factor of a resonant cavity is given by : Q = \\\\frac{2\\\\pi f_o \\\\mathcal{E}}{P} , where f_o is the resonant frequency, \\\\mathcal{E} is the stored energy in the cavity, and P=-\\\\frac{dE}{dt} is the power dissipated. The optical Q is equal to the ratio of the resonant frequency to the bandwidth of the cavity resonance. The average lifetime of a resonant photon in the cavity is proportional to the cavity's Q. If the Q factor of a laser's cavity is abruptly changed from a low value to a high one, the laser will emit a pulse of light that is much more intense than the laser's normal continuous output. This technique is known as Q-switching. R * Region of interest. A Region of Interest, often abbreviated ROI, is a selected subset of samples within a dataset identified for a particular purpose. A Representation of RGB additive color mixing. * RGB. The RGB color model utilizes the additive model in which red, green, and blue light are combined in various ways to create other colors. * ROI. See Region of Interest. * Foreground, figure and objects. See also spatial-taxon. S * S-video. Separate video, abbreviated S-Video and also known as Y/C (or erroneously, S-VHS and \\"super video\\") is an analog video signal that carries the video data as two separate signals (brightness and color), unlike composite video which carries the entire set of signals in one signal line. S-Video, as most commonly implemented, carries high-bandwidth 480i or 576i resolution video, i.e. standard definition video. It does not carry audio on the same cable. * Scheimpflug principle. * Shutter. A shutter is a device that allows light to pass for a determined period of time, for the purpose of exposing the image sensor to the right amount of light to create a permanent image of a view. * Shutter speed. In machine vision the shutter speed is the time for which the shutter is held open during the taking an image to allow light to reach the imaging sensor. In combination with variation of the lens aperture, this regulates how much light the imaging sensor in a digital camera will receive. * Smart camera. A smart camera is an integrated machine vision system which, in addition to image capture circuitry, includes a processor, which can extract information from images without need for an external processing unit, and interface devices used to make results available to other devices. * Spatial-Taxon. Spatial-taxons are information granules, composed of non-mutually exclusive pixel regions, within scene architecture. They are similar to the Gestalt psychological designation of figure-ground, but are extended to include foreground, object groups, objects and salient object parts. * Structured-light 3D scanner. The process of projecting a known pattern of illumination (often grids or horizontal bars) on to a scene. The way that these patterns appear to deform when striking surfaces allows vision systems to calculate the depth and surface information of the objects in the scene. * SVGA. Super Video Graphics Array, almost always abbreviated to Super VGA or just SVGA is a broad term that covers a wide range of computer display standards. T * Telecentric lens. Compound lens with an unusual property concerning its geometry of image-forming rays. In machine vision systems telecentric lenses are usually employed in order to achieve dimensional and geometric invariance of images within a range of different distances from the lens and across the whole field of view. * Telephoto lens. Lens whose focal length is significantly longer than the focal length of a normal lens. * Thermography. Thermal imaging, a type of Infrared imaging. * TIFF. Tagged Image File Format (abbreviated TIFF) is a file format for mainly storing images, including photographs and line art. U * USB. Universal Serial Bus (USB) provides a serial bus standard for connecting devices, usually to computers such as PCs, but is also becoming commonplace on cameras. V * VESA. The Video Electronics Standards Association (VESA) is an international body, founded in the late 1980s by NEC Home Electronics and eight other video display adapter manufacturers. The initial goal was to produce a standard for 800√ó600 SVGA resolution video displays. Since then VESA has issued a number of standards, mostly relating to the function of video peripherals in IBM PC compatible computers. * VGA. Video Graphics Array (VGA) is a computer display standard first marketed in 1987 by IBM. * Vision processing unit. A class of microprocessors aimed at accelerating machine vision tasks. W Wide angle lens - 17-40 f/4 L * Wide-angle lens. In photography and cinematography, a wide-angle lens is a lens whose focal length is shorter than the focal length of a normal lens. X Wilhelm R√∂ntgen, of his wife's hand. * X-rays. A form of electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength in the range of 10 to 0.01 nanometers, corresponding to frequencies in the range 30 to 3000 PHz (1015 hertz). X-rays are primarily used for diagnostic medical and industrial imaging as well as crystallography. X-rays are a form of ionizing radiation and as such can be dangerous. Y * Y-cable. A Y-cable or Y cable is an electrical cable containing three ends of which one is a common end that in turn leads to a split into the remaining two ends, resembling the letter \\"Y\\". Y-cables are typically, but not necessarily, short (less than 12 inches), and often the ends connect to other cables. Uses may be as simple as splitting one audio or video channel into two, to more complex uses such as splicing signals from a high density computer connector to its appropriate peripheral . Z A 70-200mm Zoom lens * Zoom lens. A mechanical assembly of lenses whose focal length can be changed, as opposed to a prime lens, which has a fixed focal length.

LiveonRelease LiveonRelease was founded by Colette Trudeau and Brittin Karroll, who had decided to form an all-female rock band at the age of 15. Colette used the Georgia Straight, an entertainment newspaper in Vancouver, to recruit the rest of the band: Foxx Herst and Leah Emmott. After doing small gigs, the band invited Vancouver rocker Bif Naked to an outdoor show, leading her to sign them to her label \\"Her Royal Majesty Records\\", distributed through Warner Music Canada. As lead singer, Colette co-wrote their hit single \\"I'm Afraid of Britney Spears\\" which appeared in the movie and soundtrack for Dude, Where's My Car?. The band released four music videos on MuchMusic that received heavy rotation, and released two full-length albums. The band toured consistently, covering Canada and the U.S. East Coast, including a showcase in New York at the notorious CBGB's. In 2003, the band split up and Colette decided to pursue a solo career. Solo career Colette signed a production deal with Bananatoons Production and SA Track Works, where she has worked with songwriters Sean Hosein, Dane Deviller, Steve Smith, Anthony Anderson, Brian Howes, Davor Vulama and Eddie Schwartz. To date, Colette has had her songs \\"Freeze\\", \\"Stay with me\\" and \\"Easier to Miss You\\" recorded by international artists. As a commercial artist, Colette's voice has been featured in ad campaigns for products such as Motorola, Kia Auto Dealerships and Callaway Park. Colette's song \\"I Don't Wanna Know\\" was added to the rotation on CHUM radio stations across Canada in January 2008, with Colette winning the 'Up and Coming Artist of the Month'. \\"I Don't Wanna Know\\" found its way onto multiple radio stations top 20 charts. Colette recruited UBC film students to help her in the creation of the music video. As a solo artist, Colette has headlined numerous shows in the greater Vancouver area, including performances at festivals, and played with artists such as Hedley and Faber Drive. As an Aboriginal artist, Colette has had the opportunity to be a featured performer on APTN's My TV.

The channel's taglines were \\"The secrets of life revealed\\" and \\"The only one\\", but these were later replaced by \\"Channel for the path to the cessation of suffering and attainment of Dhamma\\". The channel features many types of programs with Buddhist content, and has programs in several languages. The channel started in 2002, as a means to reach remote provinces in Thailand. Controversially, the channel made international headlines in 2012 when it featured a teaching on the afterlife of Steve Jobs. On 26 December 2016, Thai authorities withdrew the permit for the satellite channel permanently, during the legal investigations into the temple by the Thai junta. In April 2017, it was reported, however, that the channel's programming had continued, but broadcast through the Internet only. In its online format, the channel has been renamed Global Buddhist Network.  Background  DMC started in 2002. The channel was owned by the Dhamma Research for Environment Foundation, part of the temple Wat Phra Dhammakaya. The channel was founded to provide an alternative to the many distractions that surround people in modern life, which lure \\"people into doing immoral things\\", as stated by Phra Somsak Piyasilo, spokesperson of the organization. The channel originated from an initiative in 2001 when people living in the far provinces of Thailand wanted to listen to the teachings of the temple. The temple therefore provided live teachings through a thousand public telephone lines, through which people could follow the activities. The telephone lines had many restrictions in use, and the temple started to broadcast through a satellite television channel instead. Later, in 2005, the temple developed an online counterpart to the channel. The channel is managed by Phra Maha Nopon Pu√±√±ajayo, who supervises a team of thirty volunteers. Previously, it was known by the pun 'the Dhamma satellite' (). The channel was one of the first widely spread satellite channels in Thailand, described as a form of \\"positive television\\" (). The channel's taglines were \\"The secrets of life revealed\\" and \\"The only one\\". Although the channel broadcasts over thirty different programs, the soap operas with Buddhist content have been most awarded: in 2008, the channel received an award from the Society for Positive Television in Thailand, and in 2010, it received an award from the National Anti-Corruption Commission‚Äîboth were given for the edifying effects of the channel's soap operas. However, a more general award was also given by the House of Representatives in 2010. In 2016, the channel was ordered to shut down and its permit eventually withdrawn permanently when the junta cracked down on Wat Phra Dhammakaya during the Klongchan controversy. The channel was later revived in a new digital format, called GBN, short for Global Buddhist Network, which can only be accessed through the Internet.  Programming and availability  Former logo of the Dhammakaya Media Channel The main focus of the channel, as described by the temple, is moral education. It has programs for people of different ages. It broadcasts guided meditations, talks, preaching, songs, documentaries, dramas, live events and cartoons twenty-four hours a day. Songs played on the channel are often parody versions of popular songs, in diverse genres, with Buddhist content. They explain Buddhist customs and pay homage to important teachers. The programming is aimed at different age groups and diverse communities: e.g. there is a cartoon series about the JƒÅtaka tales for children. The most popular program is a broadcast of a teaching called Fan Nai Fan, which also includes a guided meditation. Before the 2016 crackdown by the Thai junta, the channel could be watched or listened to for free through satellite television, Internet, cable and radio. In 2005, it was reported that DMC had a hundred thousand viewers. In 2016, the satellite channel could be received in all continents in the world, except for South America. The channel has programs in Thai, English, Chinese and Japanese language. The channel was also broadcast in public places like temples, hotels and prisons. It sought cooperation with other Buddhist countries as well: the temple has assisted with establishing a Sri Lankan television channel with Buddhist content called Shraddha TV, for which it has made content available for free and hired Sri Lankans to help translate. For some programs Burmese Abhidhamma teachers were consulted.  Steve Jobs episode  In 2012, the temple broadcast a talk by Luang Por Dhammajayo, the then abbot of Wat Phra Dhammakaya, about what happened to Steve Jobs after his death. The talk came as a response to a software engineer of Apple who had sent a letter with questions to the abbot. Luang Por Dhammajayo described how Steve Jobs looked like in heaven. He said that Jobs had been reborn as a deva (heavenly being) living close to his former offices, as a result of the karma of having given knowledge to people. He was a deva with a creative, but angry temperament. The talk was much criticized, and the abbot was accused of pretending to have attained an advanced meditative state and of attempting to outshine other temples. The temple answered the critics, saying that the talk was meant to illustrate principles of karma, not to defame Jobs, nor to fake an advanced state. Critics such as Phra Paisal Visalo and religion scholar Surapot Taweesak pressed the Supreme Sangha Council, who leads the monastic community in Thailand, to investigate further as to whether Luang Por Dhammajayo had fraudulent intentions. Surapot, known for his liberal views on separation of religion and state, was criticized by sociologist Kengkit Kitirianglap and others, however, for abandoning his liberal position. With regard to the teaching about Steve Jobs, Kengkit argued that the state, of which the council is part, should not get involved in what is \\"true Buddhism\\" and what is not. Surapot replied that urging the council to crack down on Luang Por Dhammajayo does not go against democratic principles, because the monastic discipline applies to all monks equally.  Shutdown  Buddha In 2014, Wat Phra Dhammakaya came under scrutiny under the new military junta and in 2015 was implicated in the Klongchan controversy. 11.37 billion baht ($3.6M, ‚Ç¨2.9M or ¬£2.6M, ) was allegedly embezzled from the Klongchan Credit Union Cooperative, in which a portion totaling over one billion baht was found to have been given to the temple via public donations. The investigations resulted in several failed raids on the temple and the channel was ordered to shut down for thirty days, authorities citing that the channel was used to mobilize people to resist a possible arrest of the former abbot, as people had done during the first raid. The temple appealed to a higher court, denying the accusations and stating that insufficient evidence had been provided. The temple further described the shutdown as an infringement of human rights. The channel's broadcast permit was permanently withdrawn the same month, on 26 December. Critics compared the shutdown with the military crackdown during the 1992 Black May protest, news outlet Bangkok Post criticizing the National Broadcasting and Telecommunications Commission for \\"operating outside the courts and justice system\\". The online channel was still available. Despite the channel being shut down, Thai Rath and other main media outlets have continued to broadcast the temple's ceremonies. The temple has stated that the number of people joining ceremonies has increased since the shutdown, people showing sympathy with the temple and the satellite channel.  Revival and aftermath  On 24 April 2017, a host of the Inside Thailand program on Spring News noticed a revival of the Dhammakaya Media Channel through a new digital format, called GBN, short for Global Buddhist Network. The new tagline of the channel was \\"Channel for the path to the cessation of suffering and attainment of Dhamma\\". The channel could be received through the Internet only, and featured very similar contents as before, although the temple's spokesperson assured there would be no further attempts at mobilizing people. Thus, the channel continued in online formats only, through a website and a separate online broadcast. the website ranked 674th of all Thai websites on the Alexa ranking. The closing down of DMC was not the last time that the junta decided to impose sanctions against a media outlet. In March 2017, the junta closed down Voice TV for seven days, after the channel criticized the martial law imposed on Wat Phra Dhammakaya during the junta's crackdown. And in August the same year, Peace TV was also closed down for a month, the junta citing \\"it broke the rules of the NCPO\\". Some reports related this to a policy of removing former PM Thaksin's influence, a policy which has also been connected with Wat Phra Dhammakaya.

One of the main functions of PWS is to provide an environment where web programmers can test their programs and web pages. Therefore, a PWS supports the more common server-side programming approaches that can be used with production web servers. A personal web server, or personal server in short, allows users to store, selectively share, or publish information on the web or on a home network. Unlike other types of web servers, a personal web server is owned or controlled by an individual, and operated for the individual's needs, instead of by a company. It can be implemented in different ways: * as a computer appliance * as a general- purpose server, such as a Linux server, which may be located at the owner's home or in a data center * in a shared hosting model, where several users share one physical server by means of virtualization, or virtual hosting. * as one feature of a computer that is otherwise also used for other purposes. A personal web server is conceptually the opposite of a web server, or website, operated by third parties, in a software as a service (SaaS) or cloud model.

His Latin epic, Gesta Roberti Wiscardi (\\"The Deeds of Robert Guiscard\\"), written in hexameters, is one of the principal contemporary sources for the Norman conquest of southern Italy, especially the career of Robert Guiscard, Duke of Apulia (1059-1085).  Background  Little is known about William's life before he wrote his history of the Normans. Unlike the other two principal chroniclers of the Normans in Italy (Amatus of Montecassino and Geoffrey Malaterra), William was probably a layman, based on the relative lack of religious references in his work. It is also quite possible that William was a Lombard, rather than a Norman, as his treatment of Lombard characters in his history is very sympathetic when compared to his contemporary Norman counterparts. The coinage of Roger Borsa, to whom William dedicated his work and of whose court William was probably a member.  The Gesta Roberti Wiscardi  William's poem Gesta Roberti Wiscardi was probably composed sometime between 1097 and 1099, as he notes the fighting of the crusaders in Anatolia during 1097, but not the fall of Jerusalem in 1099. The poem was dedicated to Duke Roger Borsa son of duke Robert Guiscard, implying that he was a member of the former's court. More than the works of his two fellow chroniclers of the Normans, Amatus of Montecassino and Geoffrey Malaterra, William's work is a tribute to Robert Guiscard, which may indicate that Roger commissioned it to strengthen his claim to his father's titles.

He goes on to state that the setting is Bradford, where McGregor lived in the late 1990s.Jon McGregor ¬ª Background Plot summary If Nobody Speaks of Remarkable Things eschews a traditional narrative structure, instead moving from one resident of an unnamed English street to another, describing their actions and inner world over the course of a single day, the last day of Summer in 1997.Jon McGregor ¬ª If Nobody Speaks of Remarkable Things These characters are not named, and are described by an omniscient third person narrator.

He receives his guidance through Aom, a stripper in Bangkok, who rides on his back and gives him directions. Because of his disability, he was taunted by other children and grows up into an angry young man. At a target range, he finds he has a knack for target shooting when he visualizes the faces of the boys that taunted him in the target. His deafness gives him an edge in shooting, as he does not react to the gunshots. One day while cleaning up, a customer named Joe is at the shooting range with his girlfriend, Aom. Joe notices Kong watching them and he offers the pistol to Kong, who impresses Joe and Aom with his shooting. Joe agrees to be Kong's partner and teaches him how to shoot, while standing behind him. When Joe injures his gun hand in a battle, Kong is ready to take on more work. Working for a mob boss, Kong is sent on a job to Hong Kong and when he returns to Bangkok, he catches a cold and needs medicine, so he stops at a pharmacy and meets Fon, a pretty pharmacist, who he eventually takes out a few times. This encounter changes Kong's perspective on life as he realizes that life can be meaningful, even for a deaf-mute assassin like him. Aom has trouble with one of the mob boss' henchmen. She spurns him, but he rapes her. Enraged, Joe kills the henchman, which brings the mob's wrath down on Joe, which in turn leads to more revenge killing by Kong, and a final big shoot-out in a water bottle plant. Severely injured in the battle and cornered by the police, Kong puts his head next to the mob boss's and then shoots himself in the head, killing the two of them.

They are commonly known as the Calcutta Botanical Garden and previously as the Royal Botanic Garden, Calcutta. The gardens exhibit a wide variety of rare plants and a total collection of over 12,000 specimens spread over 109 hectares. It is under Botanical Survey of India (BSI) of Ministry of Environment and Forests, Government of India. History The gardens were founded in 1787 by Colonel Robert Kyd, an army officer of the British East India Company, primarily for the purpose of identifying new plants of commercial value, such as teak, and growing spices for trade. Joseph Dalton Hooker says of this Botanical Garden that \\"Amongst its greatest triumphs may be considered the introduction of the tea-plant from China ... the establishment of the tea-trade in the Himalaya and Assam is almost entirely the work of the superintendents of the gardens of Calcutta and Seharunpore (Saharanpur).\\"Joseph Dalton Hooker, Himalayan Journals, or Notes of a Naturalist ..., Kew (1854), vol. I, p. 5. A major change in policy, however, was introduced by the botanist William Roxburgh after he became superintendent of the garden in 1793. Roxburgh brought in plants from all over India and developed an extensive herbarium.Roxburgh, W (1814) Hortus Bengalensis or a catalogue of the plants growing in the Honourable East India Company's botanic garden at Calcutta. Mission Press : Serampore. 105pp. This collection of dried plant specimens eventually became the Central National Herbarium of the Botanical Survey of India, which comprises 2,500,000 items. During the early years of the garden Joseph Dalton Hooker writes:Joseph Dalton Hooker, Himalayan Journals, or Notes of a Naturalist ..., Kew (1854), vol. I, p. 4. Over the years attractive display gardens for the public have been developed and many kinds of plants have been cultivated for scientific observation. During the 1970s the garden initiated a program to introduce improved food plants and other varieties of economic benefit to the people of India. The Garden was designated the Acharya Jagadish Chandra Bose Indian Botanic Garden on June 25, 2009 in honor of Jagadish Chandra Bose, the Bengali polymath, and natural scientist. This garden is a No Plastic Zone. Attractions The best- known landmark of the garden is The Great Banyan, an enormous banyan tree (Ficus benghalensis) that is reckoned to be the largest tree in the world, at more than 330 metres in circumference. It partially inspired the novel Hothouse by Brian Aldiss. The gardens are also famous for their enormous collections of orchids, bamboos, palms, and plants of the screw pine genus (Pandanus). Animals seen inside the Botanic Garden include the Jackal (Canis aureus), Indian mongoose and the Indian Fox (Vulpes bengalensis). A large number of various snakes are also found in the garden.

Weeks (October 2, 1871 - December 21, 1935). Background Harry Weeks was born October 2, 1871, in W. Springfield, MA, the son of Charles F. and Clarissa Allen Weeks. He attended MIT where he studied architecture in the Beaux-Arts tradition, graduating in 1893. He then worked for several prominent Massachusetts architectural firms before owning his own firm in Pittsfield, MA, for 3 years, where he would meet his future business partner. At the suggestion of John M. Carrere, a member of the Cleveland Group Plan Commission, Weeks moved to Cleveland in 1905, where he went to work for the prominent Cleveland architect J. Milton Dyer (1870-1957). Frank Walker was born September 29, 1877, in Pittsfield, MA, the son of Frank and Helen Theresa (Ranous) Walker. He also studied architecture in the beaux-arts tradition at MIT, from which he was graduated in 1900. He subsequently moved to France to study at the Atelier of Monsieur Redon in Paris, and then lived a year in Italy. He returned to practice architecture in Boston, New York, and Pittsburgh before moving to Cleveland in 1905 to work for the firm of J. Milton Dyer. After working together in Dyer's office, Walker and Weeks opened their own practice in 1911; the office continued to produce work even after Weeks's death, until the early 1950s. As was often the case with architecture firms, Walker was the designer while Weeks was primarily the businessman. Works The firm is most noted for its bank buildings; several dozen were designed in the teens alone. Their best-known bank was the Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland, built in 1923. However, they also designed a wide variety of commercial, public, ecclesiastic and residential buildings, as well as a number of bridges, during the course of the firm's life. Walker and Weeks were responsible for the Indiana World War Memorial Plaza in Indianapolis, which features a cenotaph based on the Mausoleum of Maussollos. Walker and Weeks frequently employed sculptor Henry Hering to create sculpture for their projects. Like many architects the firm produced work in a variety of styles, from Neoclassical, Italian Renaissance and finally, the 1930s, ending in Moderne and/or Art Deco.

Constructed between 1837 and 1843, the property has been the vice-regal residence of the Governor since Sir George Gipps, except for two brief periods; the first between 1901 and 1914, when the property was leased to the Commonwealth of Australia as the residence of the Governor-General of Australia, and the second from 1996 to 2011. The property was returned as the Governor's residence in October 2011 and was managed by the Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales from March 1996 to December 2013. Completed in 1847 and constructed in the Gothic revival style, the building is listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register. History=1845‚Äì1901 In 1835 the British Government agreed that a new Government House in Sydney had become a necessity, and the royal architect, Edward Blore, was instructed to draw up plans. Construction commenced in 1837 and was supervised by colonial architect Mortimer Lewis and Colonel Barney of the Royal Engineers. Stone, cedar, and marble for the construction were obtained from various areas of New South Wales. A ball in honour of the birthday of Queen Victoria was held in the new building in 1843, although construction was not complete. The first resident, Governor George Gipps, did not move in until 1845. Government House, with its setting on Sydney Harbour, has a garden area of and is located south of the Sydney Opera House, overlooking Farm Cove. It was designed in a romantic Gothic revival stylecastellated, crenellated, turreted and is decorated with oil portraits and the coats of arms of its successive occupants. Additions have included a front portico in 1873, an eastern verandah in 1879 and extensions to the ballroom and governor's study in 1900‚Äì01. From 1845 until 1901, the building served as the Governor's residence, office and official reception space. 1901‚Äì1914 Between 1901 and 1914, the building was used to house the new role of Governor-General, created by the Federation of Australia. During this period, three Governors of New South Wales occupied Cranbrook, namely Harry Rawson, Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford and Gerald Strickland, 1st Baron Strickland. In 1913, the decision was taken to establish a residence for the Governor-General at Admiralty House. 1914‚Äì1996 Sir Dudley de Chair (1924‚Äì1930) outside Government House, 17 March 1925. From 1914 to 1996, the building again served as the residence, office and official reception space for the Governor of New South Wales. 1996‚Äì2011 However, in 1996, at the direction of the then Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr, the property ceased to be used as a residence, and the Governor's day office was relocated to the historic Chief Secretary's building nearby, at 121 Macquarie Street. On 16 January 1996 Carr announced that the next Governor, Gordon Samuels, would not live or work at Government House. On these changes, Carr said \\"The Office of the Governor should be less associated with pomp and ceremony, less encumbered by anachronistic protocol, more in tune with the character of the people\\". Carr later quipped that his decision had been \\"for Jack Lang\\", referring to the Premier of a former state Labor Government that was dismissed by a Governor, Philip Game, in 1932 during a constitutional crisis. The state's longest-serving governor, Sir Roden Cutler, was also reported as saying: This move generated further controversy, as the proclaimed cost savings of over $2 million never materialised. The Auditor- General found it cost $600,000 more to maintain the building without a resident Governor; and public attendance decreased (resident Governors had maintained public access during their tenures). This led the group Australians for Constitutional Monarchy to organise a protest, resulting in one of the largest marches in Sydney history: a crowd of 15,000 protested outside Parliament House, blocking Macquarie Street. On the day before Gordon Samuels' swearing-in, a petition bearing 55,000 signatures was handed in, calling on the Premier to reconsider. During the hiatus of resident governor, Government House was consistently used for vice-regal purposes and remained the official reception space of the state, including as a key meeting venue of APEC Australia 2007 in September 2007, at which time the political leaders of the 21 member states of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation met. 2011‚Äìpresent In October 2011, the then Premier Barry O'Farrell announced that the then Governor, Marie Bashir, had agreed with O'Farrell's offer to move back into Government House: \\"A lot of people believe the Governor should live at Government House. That's what it was built for ... [A]t some stage a rural or regional governor will be appointed and we will need to provide accommodation at Government House so it makes sense to provide appropriate living areas\\". However, because Government House has not been a residence for fifteen years, O'Farrell also announced that the Governor will initially move into a smaller adjacent building, called the chalet, while refurbishments of the main wing occur, with a proposed move into the main house \\"before Christmas\\". From December 2013, management of Government House was returned to the Office of the Governor from the managers since 1996, the Historic Houses Trust of New South Wales.  Description =Grounds Much of the 19th- century character of the grounds remains. The grounds include private gardens as well as formal open areas. Near the house (on its south-east side) is a giant Moreton Bay fig (Ficus macrophylla), planted soon after the house's construction was completed. This tree is the surviving one of a former pair which stood either side of the terrace.Beattie, 2017. The formal grounds of sweeping annual displays, manicured lawns, exotic trees and shurbs as well as the carriageways, paths and terraces provide a strong link with Sydney's colonial and Victorian heritage.AHC, undated. The garden maintains a distinctly 19th-century character, drawing on Regency and Italianate styles, and featuring a collection of native and exotic species. Most changes to the garden were at the initiative of past governors and their wives, including Denison's five acre vegetable garden and Lady Game's much-loved project, the \\"Spring Walk\\". Some areas of the garden are true to their 19th-century design, while others are more modern. Thousands of visitors enjoy the garden every year, both as public visitors and guests at functions ranging from garden parties for Royal visits, open days, award ceremonies and charity events. The garden is a crucial part of Government House ‚Äì chef Christine Ware regularly sources honey (the current governor keeps bees), herbs and flowers for food served at functions. Florist Marjan Medhat has also been known to use flowers and natural ephemera from the grounds in her floral displays, alongside potted plants grown in the greenhouse. The first private garden ‚Äì the Western Terrace ‚Äì sits around a rocky outcrop and knoll and features an extensive sandstone wall and plantings of olive trees. ;Western terrace, 1836-1845 Lies inside the entrance gates to the left of the drive. This is the oldest part of the garden, established when the house was being built (1836‚Äì45) to provide screening and privacy for the house.Stuart Read, pers.comm., 26/5/2017 The evergreen trees planted here ‚Äì many of them native species ‚Äì were chosen to block out \\"disagreeable scenery\\", but the large two-level terrace also functioned as a pleasure garden. The original sandstone walls, some of the gravel paths and plantings of olive trees and hedges survive. An evergreen or southern magnolia or bull bay (M. grandiflora) dating from the 1859s is at the northern end of the terrace. The terrace was restored in 2000 by Sydney Living Museums (fmr. Historic Houses Trust of NSW). ;Eastern terrace, 1869 The eastern terrace's design was laid out in 1869 and remains the main feature of the garden. From the house's arcade (colonnade) you can view across bisecting pathways lined with flowerbeds to a view of Sydney Harbour. Through Cook's pines (Araucaria columnaris) and other trees you can see Fort Denison, Mrs Macquarie's Chair, Garden Island and beyond. Originally the view was wider to the east including towards the heads of the harbour).Stuart Read, pers.comm, 26/5/2017 The Eastern Terrace has a central sandstone pond with its original stone fountain. Various garden schemes have been installed in the eastern terrace's formal garden borders flanking the central path.Stuart Read, pers.comm., 27/8/2014 ;Palm Grove, 1870s North of the Eastern Terrace is the palm grove, established in the 1870s for the Countess of Belmore, wife of the 13th governor. Here native and exotic palms including the Lord Howe Island's Kentia (Howea fosteriana) and curly (H.belmoreana)(named for the governor) can be found.Beattie, 2017, names and attribution: Stuart Read, 26/5/2017 ;Spring Walk, 1930s Governor and Lady Game were both keen gardeners and Lady Game \\"set out to produce an outstanding array of trees, shrubs and planters\\". She established the Spring Walk on the southern end of the Eastern Terrace, where she supplemented surviving 19th century Camellia japonica cv's with new plantings of modern varieties. Surviving very old camellias include C.j.'Cleopatra Rosea' (pink) and \\"Wellbankiana\\" (white), some of which are over 100 years old. Wife of Governor Game's private secretary, writer Ethel Anderson, had this to say about Lady Game's garden: 'under the grey green olives, late daffodils still star the grass. Watsonias, double cheeries, magnolias, spieas, purple eupatoriums and primulas, set in a spring border among standard white wisterias form, like a sea... Lady Game's border - so lovely with pomegranates, bougainvilleas, cistus and Madonna lilies - keeps its date with beauty.' The entrance stones to the Spring Walk are said to be convict-made blocks from the first Government House built for Arthur Philip, now the site of the Museum of Sydney. Like many houses of the time, Government House was self sufficient with kitchen gardens, orchards and farm animals. The kitchen garden is now part of the Royal Botanic Gardens. ;Official plantings To the west of the driveway is a large paperbark (Melaleuca leucadendra) and peppermint (Eucalyptus nicholli) planted by Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh in 1954 during the first visit of a reigning monarch to Australia. Many of the garden's trees are ceremonial plantings. Among the roses on the Eastern Terrace the \\"Dame Marie Bashir Rose\\" can be found (bred in that Governor's honour), as well as the \\"Governor Macquarie\\" rose Dame Dr Bashir planted in 2009 as patron of the Rose Society of New South Wales. Dame Marie Bashir was just one of the many governors past and present with a passion for plants and their pollinators. ;The Lodge One of two Gothic style buildings to have survived around Government House. It is a copy of a guardhouse at Windsor Castle. ;Gatehouse Brick gatehouse replacing an earlier timber one. ;The Chalet Designed by Colonial Architect W. L. Vernon, the chalet breaks with the Gothic style of Government House. However, it has Tudor Gothic elements such as half timbered gables and broad brick chimneys. House Government House is a Gothic Revival two-storey building with crenellated battlements, turrets, detailed interiors, extensive cellars and a porte-coch√®re at the entrance. An open cloister on the east elevation forms a verandah room which is supported by Gothic arches and forms an open balcony above. The ground floor contains twelve rooms and the first floor contains thirteen bedrooms. It is built of stone with a slate roof, timber floors, unpainted cedar joinery and a stone- flagged verandah. There are extensive staff offices and quarters. =Moveable Collection= A collection of moveable heritage noted in the Historic Houses Collection inventory as being of high and exceptional significance are also included in the State Heritage Listing. Items of exceptional significance are those deemed to be rare or outstanding and of major cultural or historic significance to NSW and Australia. Such items have a documented provenance to NSW Governors, their families and entourages from 1845 to the early 20th Century or with the first five Governors-General of Australia between 1901 and 1915. Items of high significance are objects considered to be rare or unusual and to have a cultural or historic significance to NSW. These objects date from 1845 through to the present and may contribute to the understanding of the house occupant s and use or through their connection to artists, architects, craftsmen or suppliers associated with the construction and decoration of Government House.  Condition  As at 27 August 2014, the physical condition is excellent; and the archaeological potential is good. The whole assembly is relatively intact within its 1915‚Äì17 boundaries ‚Äì including house, garden, gatehouse, Chalet, courtyards, garages, greenhouses etc. ‚Äì and can show the development of the site and the management and workings of Government House.McGregor & Associates 1997  Modifications and dates  *1846-47 - Guardhouse built at entrance to the domain at the intersection of Bridge and Macquarie Streets *1854 - First coats of arms mounted on building *1863 - Deer House, Cow House and Conservatory constructed. *1873 - A porte cochere added *1879-80 - Construction of Colonnade and eastern arcade *1890-91 - Chalet commissioned and built *1899 - Ballroom extended. *1902-03 - Alterations and additions to accommodate Governor-General *-21 - Summer House in formal garden removed. *Mid 20th c. - Eastern Terrace's main axial path paved with lage rectangular stones, side paths with crazy paving (and also widened in proportion, destroying the original path hierarchy) and stylish grass borders removed.Griffin, 2010 *1948-54 - Additions and Renovations for Royal Visit by Queen Elizabeth II & Prince Philip. *1979-80 - Demolition of earlier outbuildings and construction of a new group of buildings. *1990-96 - Reconstruction of Vestibule interiors, restoration of East Terrace and various other construction and restoration works.Historic Houses Trust; McGregor & Assoc., 1997 *2004 - reinstatement of the c.1840 garden layout and treatment of the Western Terrace. *2010 - replacement of Eastern Terrace side paths, new drainage, irrigation and planting of central beds.  Heritage listing  As at 28 March 2013, Government House built in the early 1840s as the home of the monarch's representative and as the seat of power, symbolised British authority in the colony. Like the Governors themselves, the house is a powerful symbol of state. From the time of its completion, the house and its occupants were seen as the \\"pinnacle\\" of society, and the Governor and family as social exemplars, ideas that continued well into the twentieth century. Home to twenty four governors of New South Wales and their families, and the first five Governors-General, all chosen for their various pre-eminent positions, it reflects the many changes that have taken place in public and private life. Guests and visitors ranged from citizens paying their respects or receiving awards, to the reigning monarch, Elizabeth II, other members of the Royal family and other heads of states. The finest example of a castellated Gothic house in Australia, the house with its landscaped gardens reflected its English ties and was the model that inspired others. It is a grand ensemble of buildings, gardens and contents whose history and use are richly documented. Developments to the place over 150 years demonstrate changing tastes and social attitudes, and showcase the talents of leading architects, artists and craftsmen. Located in Governor Phillip's domain, it provides a tangible link with the earliest years of the colony, and is associated with the development of significant public places such as the Conservatorium (formerly its stables), Royal Botanic Gardens (formerly its grounds), and the Opera House. Government House in Sydney is significant as one of the two original official residences selected for the Governor-General following the federation of the Australian colonies in 1901. Rivalry between New South Wales and Victoria led the Commonwealth Government to designate Government House in Sydney and Melbourne Government House as official residences of equal status for the Governor-General. The Sydney Government House served as the governor-general's Sydney Residence until 1912 when the NSW government sparked a major controversy by effectively evicting the governor-general. The place is significant for its association with the first five occupants of the high office of Governor-General from the time of federation until 1912. A rare example of a great harbourside landscape estate virtually intact. A typical 19th century 3-part estate landscape of park, parterre and pleasure grounds. The formal grounds of sweeping annual displays, manicured lawns, exotic trees and shrubs as well as the carriageways, paths and terraces provide a strong link with Sydney's colonial and Victorian heritage It is perhaps the last of the great harbourside estates to have survived relatively intact and to still be carrying on its original function; a combination of private residence, office complex and official function venue. The garden is one of the oldest continually maintained gardens in Australia. Whilst it has been altered to some extent over the years, it nevertheless provides an appropriately grand setting for the house. The heritage significance of Government House at a State level is enhanced by the extraordinarily rich and diverse collection of moveable heritage ranging from furniture, paintings, ceramics, glassware textiles and sculpture to garden ornaments and kitchenalia dating back to the 1820s. It is a rare and intact collection of items with an ongoing and continuous association with the vice regal function and clearly demonstrates 150 years of changing style and taste. The collection is inherently linked to the house (and specific locations in the house). The comprehensive collection of portraits of NSW governors contains one of the earliest official portraits to be commissioned in NSW and Australia, that of Governor Thomas Brisbane by Augustus Earle. The collection of colonial furniture is significant and contains the most extensive collection of furniture by noted craftsman Andrew Lenham between 1845 and 1860 as well as furniture and other objects associated with colonial and international exhibitions and demonstrate excellence in local design, manufacturing and materials. Government House, Sydney was listed on the New South Wales State Heritage Register on 13 December 2011 having satisfied the following criteria. The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales. This site replaced the original government house in 1845 as the seat of power and the symbol of the Crown and British authority in the colonial period. It was the seat of executive power under the constitution of New South Wales from 1856 to 1901 and 1915 to 1996. It can demonstrate its changing role as the seat of executive power, the residence of the Governors of New South Wales, and as an important place of State ceremony.McGregor & Associates 1997: 257 The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history. The site has close associations with the many Governors and Governors General who have resided there as well as the many international heads of state who have visited and stayed there. As the seat of British authority in NSW and Australia, Government House is significant for its important association with the British royalty, especially those who have been accommodated at the house including Prince Albert (who after being shot was treated and nursed back to health in the Drawing Room of Government House), the Queen Mother, the Prince of Wales, Charles and his late wife Diana, Princess Anne and Captain Mark Phillips and most importantly, the current British monarch, Queen Elizabeth II and her husband the Duke of Edinburgh on a number of occasions. The historic significance of Government House is also enhanced through its association with those involved in its design and construction: Edward Blore, an eminent British architect who completed the original design of the house; Colonial Architect Mortimer Lewis who adapted these plans to suit Australian conditions; James Barney who designed and supervised significant repairs and alterations to the house; and Walter Liberty Vernon who was also responsible for significant additions and repairs. The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales. The quality of Edward Blore's design and detailing, and the degree to which his intent was realised in the finished house, resulted in a unique building for the colony. It remains the finest example of a castellated Gothic House in Australia. The Gothic style of the house and the character of its landscaped gardens were perceived to be quintessentially English and calculated to maintain the emotional ties between a distant colony and the motherland. It served as an inspiration for other Gothic buildings in Sydney including harbourside villas, and was also a model for the unrealisd Government House in Hobart. Furthermore, it was an impetus for the Gothic revival in Australia. The construction of such a large and sophisticated building was a major technical achievement for the time. It had a seminal influence in raising the standards of building and craftsmanship in the colony. The additions to the house by James Barnet and Walter. L. Vernon between 1870 and 1902, were notable examples of the later Victorian Gothic revival style. The Chalet is a fine example of an Arts and Crafts inspired style of domestic architecture and a forerunner of the Australian Federation style of the early 20th century.McGregor & Associates 1997:258 The place has a strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons. The house was seen as a pinnacle of society and the roll of Governor as social \\"exemplar\\", ideas that continued well into the 20th century. The place can demonstrate the changing emphasis in the selection of Governor; from military, to career administrators, to aristocrats. By the end of the 19th century the role was perceived to be more social than political, and post-war Australian Governors were installed into this esteemed position. At each stage in its history, Government House was a place of work for personnel involved in the business of the Governor, in domestic service, in securing the site, or in the keeping of the grounds, most being resident on the site. The role of domestic servants, and later domestic staff, continued until the mid 1990s, well after such service had become anachronistic in most other great houses in Australia.McGregor & Associates 1997:257 The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. Government House demonstrates at a high level the design, layout, construction techniques and finishes of a colonial grand house in the Gothic style as well as that of an early colonial harbour- side estate charged with the carriage of viceregal functions including symbolic functions of authority in polity and society. The ensemble of House, outbuildings and gardens can demonstrate the development of the site and its functions from the colonial period to today. The Government house interiors as they have evolved from the 1840s reflect the development of taste and style over 170 years. The Government House garden has the archaeological potential to provide information on early roads and drives and terrace arrangements. The important interiors (such as the Lyon and Cottier wall Drawing Room ceilings and hand painted cloth panels) and the extensive moveable heritage collection (including the collection of Colonial Australian furniture, portraits of Governors, and some of the more recent furnishings and fittings) demonstrate 150 years of changing style and taste. The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales. It is a rare surviving example where the original and early planning remains relatively intact and demonstrates the prevailing social order and domestic arrangements of the \\"place\\".McGregor & Associates 1997: 258 Gallery File:Government House of NSW - panoramio.jpgThe eastern facade File:Sydney Gov.

Warkaris worship Vitthal (also known as Vithoba), the presiding deity of Pandharpur, regarded as a form of Krishna. Saints and gurus of the bhakti movement associated with the Warkaris include Dnyaneshwar, Namdev, Chokhamela, Eknath, and Tukaram, Gadge Maharaj all of whom are accorded the title of Sant.  Influence  The Warkari tradition has been part of Hindu culture in Maharashtra since the thirteenth-century CE, when it formed as a panth (community of people with shared spiritual beliefs and practices) during the Bhakti movement. Warkaris recognise around fifty poet-saints (sants) whose works over a period of 500 years were documented in an eighteenth-century hagiography by Mahipati. The Warkari tradition regards these sants to have a common spiritual line of descent. Pilgrimages Warkari people undertake an annual pilgrimage called wari, to Pandharpur, gathering there on Ekadashi (the 11th day) of the Hindu lunar calendar month of Ashadha, corresponding to a date falling sometime between late June to July in the Gregorian calendar. Pilgrims carry Palkhi of the saints from their places of Samadhi (Enlightenment or \\"spiritual birth\\"). The tradition of carrying the paduka (sandals) of the sants in a Palkhi was started by the youngest son of Tukaram, Narayan Maharaj, in 1685. Further changes were brought to the pilgrimage by descendants of Tukaram in the 1820s and by Haibatravbaba, a courtier of the Scindias and devotee of Dnyaneshwar. Devotees of Vitthal were holding pilgrimages prior to the 14th century. In the present day, about 40 palkhis and their devotees from all over Maharashtra do so.Hindu.com and page 21 of VidyaOnline.net Another pilgrimage is celebrated on the Ekadashi of the month of Kartika, which falls in November of the Gregorian Calendar. Events such as Ringan and Dhava are held during the pilgrimage. During the Ringan, an unmounted sacred horse called Maulincha Ashva, who is believed to be the soul of the saint whose idol is being carried in the litter, runs through the rows of pilgrims, who try catching the dust particles kicked off and smear their head with the same. Dhava is another kind of race where everyone wins and it is held to commemorate the manner in which Tukaram first saw the temple at Pandharpur and started running in sheer exhilaration.  Practices  The Warkari movement includes the worship of Vithoba and a duty-based approach towards life emphasising moral behavior and strict avoidance of alcohol and tobacco, the adoption of sattvic diet, a modified lacto-vegetarian diet that excludes onion and garlic and fasting on Ekadashi day (twice a month), self-restraint (celibacy) during student life, equality and humanity for all rejecting discrimination based on the caste system or wealth, the reading of Hindu texts, the recitation of the Haripath every day and the regular practice of bhajan and kirtan. The Warkaris wear tulashi-mala, a rosary made from the wood of the sacred Tulsi(Ocimum sanctum L.) plant. Varkaris look upon God as the Ultimate Truth and ascertained grades of values in social life but accept ultimate equality among men. Varkaris bow in front of each other because \\"everybody is Brahma\\" and stressed individual sacrifice, forgiveness, simplicity, peaceful co-existence, compassion, non- violence, love and humility in social life. The Vaishnav Varkaris may be known by their three upright brow lines, a black between two white gopichandan or white clay and sandal-paste lines.

They were initially foes of the Scarlet Witch and the Fantastic Four, but in more recent years, they have become allies to both. All seven are the children of Nicholas Scratch and the grandchildren of Agatha Harkness. They are humans with magic powers who can transform into fantastic creatures with super-powers. Publication history The team first appeared in Fantastic Four vol. 1 #186 (September 1977), and was created by Len Wein and George P√©rez. Fictional team history Salem's Seven originated in New Salem, Colorado, a hidden town in an unsettled part of the Rocky Mountains populated entirely by magic users who mostly lived in fear and loathing of normal humanity due to the persecution that was imposed on them during the Salem witch trials. All of Salem's Seven were fathered among different women by Nicholas Scratch. Scratch's own mother Agatha Harkness was the most powerful of the town's inhabitants, but she chose to leave the village and live among humanity. In time, she became the governess for Franklin Richards (son of Invisible Woman and Mister Fantastic of the Fantastic Four). Scratch had Salem's Seven abduct Agatha for purportedly betraying the New Salem community. They also brought back Franklin with them to give to Scratch as a new host-body, which forced the Fantastic Four to pursue. Although initially overcome and imprisoned, the Four defeated their captors, banished Scratch from this dimension, and saved Harkness. When Salem's Seven much later tried to avenge themselves on Harkness, she removed their ability to change forms.Fantastic Four #186. Marvel Comics. Over the years, Salem's Seven managed to reverse the spells locking them out of their enhanced forms, greatly weakening Harkness in the process. They took control of New Salem, and with Vertigo as their leader, they turned the whole community against Harkness and burned her at the stake. The Scarlet Witch and the Vision were then drawn to New Salem, where they were captured by the Seven. Gazelle dissented with the group's plans of sacrifice, and was thrown in with the prisoners. The Vision escaped and battled Vertigo, who drew into herself the powers of the other 665 residents of New Salem. When the Vision defeated her, Vertigo lost control of the power. The Scarlet Witch managed to channel some of it off, but in the ensuing explosion all of New Salem was apparently wiped out, including the Seven.Vision and the Scarlet Witch Vol. 2 #3, Marvel Comics. The next Halloween, Wanda attempted to commune with Agatha Harkness's spirit, but was drawn through into the land of the dead, where she was confronted with spirits of the Seven (except Gazelle) who had aligned themselves with a being that called itself Samhain. Wanda defeated Samhain and bound him within the spirits of the six of the Seven.Vision and the Scarlet Witch Vol. 2 #5. Marvel Comics. Via samples of their DNA, Brutacus, Hydron, Reptilla, Thornn, and Vakume were later re-animated as some of Arnim Zola's proto-husks. These were all introduced and then promptly slain for humorous effect by Deadpool.Deadpool #0. Marvel Comics. All members of the Salem's Seven were resurrected when the Scarlet Witch's mental breakdown and manipulation of magic restored them to life. Their father Nicholas Scratch manipulated them into releasing Shuma-Gorath, but then aided the Fantastic Four, Diablo, and Doctor Strange in defeating Scratch and Shuma-Gorath. The seven were subsequently living with Doctor Strange and are friends of the Fantastic Four. In the pages of the 2014 New Warriors series, the Salem's Seven have been seen living again in New Salem, which has become a haven for all people \\"born of magic\\" with Salem's Seven acting as the town's resident protectors.New Warriors Vol. 5 #1.

Other versions=Ultimate Marvel Appearing in Ultimate Fantastic Four operating out of Salem, Oregon, the Seven (as they are called) are a new Super Hero team. Although they are saving many people, they are just as quick to fight the Fantastic Four to get the chance to do so first. Members Include: * Alpha Dog - Leader of the Seven. He is able to alter density of objects allowing for the appearance of super- strength and invulnerability. * Ghostware - Member of the Seven with the ability to phase others and self through solid matter. * Neuropath - Member of the Seven with emotional induction which allows for control of others' emotions. * Penultimate - Member of the Seven with cybernetically-enhanced body and high-tech weaponry. * Primal Screamer - Member of the Seven with powerful vocal blasts. * Filament - Member of the Seven who creates hyper- dimensional threads which cut through all matter * Synchron - Member of the Seven who can alter probability in such a way that he can be in several positions at once, attacking from many directions. In issue #56, it is revealed that the group are one being, a creature known as the Dragon-of-Seven which can separate into multiple forms. As a single entity, the Dragon takes the form of Agatha Harkness. The Dragon posed as Harkness to get the Fantastic Four to doubt how they work as a team, and as the Seven so that they would doubt even further, as part of a plot to kidnap the Human Torch, force him to explode, and give birth to more just like it. The Dragon was killed when the Invisible Woman found a way to reverse the heat waves, so that the Dragon, in the form of the Seven, would explode instead. In other media The Salem's Seven appeared in The Avengers: United They Stand episode \\"The Sorceress Apprentice\\". Alongside Nicholas Scratch, they kidnapped Agatha Harkness.

Foundation of the society The first Cambridge University Heraldic Society was founded in 1948 from the remnants of the late nineteenth-century Monumental Brass Society. In 1954, a separate Cambridge University Society of Genealogists was formed. Not surprisingly many members of one society were members of the other and on 10 June 1957, sponsored by some Vice-Presidents, by agreement between the secretaries, Special General Meetings of both societies were held and resolutions passed abolishing both societies on condition that a new joint society was formed later in the day. Meetings held earlier in the term had led to the formal culmination of a series of discussions for the consolidation and amalgamation. The structure of the new society was to include a Patron and a number of Honorary Vice-Presidents. The committee was to consist of President, Secretary, Senior Treasurer, Junior Treasurer and ordinary Committee Members.  The society today  Four speaker meetings are held in each of the Michaelmas and Lent terms and a ninth at the beginning of the Easter term. These are in the general area of heraldry and genealogy but also include cognate subjects such as ceremonial dress, tartan, local history, customs, military medals or indeed anything of an antiquarian nature. There are generally two outings each year‚Äîone in Michaelmas and one in Lent-‚Äìto places of heraldic and genealogical interest. In recent years, the Society has visited the College of Arms, the Society of Genealogists and various cathedrals and museums. The Society also hosts one large dinner each term with the Annual Dinner (in the Lent term) attracting up to 70 diners. There is also a garden party in the Easter term.  Patrons  Sir Arthur Cochrane (Clarenceux King of Arms) was Patron of the original Heraldic and Genealogical Societies until his death in 1954. The position was still vacant when the amalgamation took place. The Cambridge University Society of Genealogists had had a President in the person of the late Earl Mountbatten of Burma, a keen genealogist. Therefore, Lord Mountbatten was invited to be Patron of the new (1957) Society, a post which he held until his assassination in 1979. In honour of his memory and with the permission of his elder daughter, Countess Mountbatten of Burma, the Society inaugurated the Mountbatten Commemorative Lecture. This remains the most important meeting of the year and the lecture has frequently been given by senior members of the College of Arms. Lord Mountbatten was succeeded as Patron by Archbishop Bruno Heim, a leading authority on the heraldry of the Roman Catholic Church who designed armorial bearings for several Popes. Heim donated a copy of a number of his own publications to the Society. After his death he was followed by the Duke of Norfolk, Earl Marshal and Hereditary Marshal of England.

Publications  In the late 1950s and early 1960s, the Society transcribed the registers of the Cambridgeshire parishes of Shepreth and Westley Waterless and published a small number of copies. Its most ambitious project, however, was to produce The Cambridge Armorial showing the arms of all the corporate armigers in Cambridge (including town, university, colleges, theological colleges and schools) with blazons and brief histories of each. Although begun in 1966, it was to be nineteen years before it was published through the efforts of Wilfrid Scott-Giles, Heather Peak, Cecil Humphery-Smith and Dr Gordon H Wright. In 1995 the Society launched a magazine, called the Escutcheon, which appears each term, edited by Derek Palgrave and now edited by Terence Trelawny-Gower.

He is better known as Ned Lambton. Early life He was born in 1961, the youngest child and only son of Belinda Blew-Jones and Antony, Viscount Lambton, eldest son of John Lambton, 5th Earl of Durham. A bonfire was lit at the top of Penshaw Hill (formerly part of the Lambton Estate) to mark his birth; he was later baptised by Maurice Harland, Bishop of Durham, in the church of St Barnabas, Burnmoor, on 23 April 1962 and an ox was roasted as part of the celebrationsPhotographs in the collection of Houghton-le-Spring Heritage Society. His elder sister is Lady Lucinda Lambton, the broadcaster. His maternal grandparents were Douglas Holden Blew-Jones and the former Violet Hilda Margaret Birkin. His aunt was Freda Dudley Ward, the mistress of Edward, Prince of Wales from 1918 to 1934 before his relationship with Wallis Simpson. Upon his grandfather's death on 4 February 1970, Lambton's father succeeded as Earl of Durham but disclaimed that title on 23 February that same year. During this short period, Lambton was known by the courtesy title Viscount Lambton, but afterwards used the title Lord Durham (as if using the courtesy title Baron Durham) to avoid confusion with his father, who improperly continued to style himself Viscount Lambton. Career Lambton stood for the Referendum Party in his father's former constituency of Berwick-upon-Tweed in the 1997 general election, gaining 3.4% of the vote. He succeeded his father as 7th Earl of Durham in 2006, and has been involved in an inheritance dispute with some of his sisters. Personal life Lambton has been married three times and divorced twice. In 1983 he married Christabel Mary McEwen, a daughter of Roderick McEwen (younger son of Sir John McEwen, 1st Baronet) and Romana von Hofmannsthal. They had one child: * Frederick Lambton, Viscount Lambton (born 23 February 1985). Ned Lambton and McEwen divorced in 1995. She has since married the musician Jools Holland. On 19 October 1995, Lambton married Catherine FitzGerald, an Anglo-Irish aristocrat, the daughter of Desmond FitzGerald, 29th Knight of Glin, and Olda Ann Willes. Their marriage did not produce any children and they divorced in 2002. She is now married to actor Dominic West. In January 2011, Lambton married 28-year-old ex-model Marina Hanbury, who worked as a parliamentary assistant to Kate Hoey, M.P., until 2010.Low-key wedding as earl ties the knot for third time - website of The Journal newspaper Marina's sister Rose is married to David Cholmondeley, 7th Marquess of Cholmondeley.

Norsj√∂ aerial tramway went in service for passenger traffic in 1989 as a tourist attraction. It is a section of the longest ropeway conveyor in the world at 96 km, built in the 1940s by the predecessors of Boliden AB to transport buckets of ore from Kristineberg, Lycksele to Boliden. Between 1943 and 1987 this ropeway moved 12 million tons of ore concentrates containing copper, lead, zinc, sulfur, silver and gold. In technical terms, the Norsj√∂ aerial tramway is a bi-cable gondola lift with detachable cabins suspended from a track rope and moved by a haul rope. The cabins can each carry four people at a speed of 10 km/hour, taking 1h 45mins to ride one way. 3 km of the ride is above lakes and streams. Kristineberg- Boliden ropeway Ropeway crossing Skellefte river in 1953 The shortage of fuel and rubber during World War II made road transport of ore increasingly expensive for Boliden AB. With a straight-line distance of around 90 kilometers, the copper mine in Kristinberg was farthest from its main facility in Boliden. In addition to the rationed imports, steel and even concrete were precious commodities at the time. So while a couple of railway solutions, including a narrow gauge railway, were evaluated the ropeway came out on top because of its favourable construction material requirements. Planning started in 1941, the initial idea was run the ropeway straight between Boliden and Kristineberg, with supports made from arsenic-treated wood to keep construction costs at a minimum. To make the most of the investment, however, it was decided to run the line across a number of newly discovered ore bodies to allow loading onto the ropeway once exploration was commenced - intermediate stations were required around every 13 km in any case. Reinforced concrete supports were chosen in lieu of wood, making them substantially longer-lasting with less maintenance. The supports and mechanical systems were identical to the 42 km Forsby-K√∂ping limestone cableway completed in 1941 in middle Sweden, which served as a proof-of-concept for the enormous technological undertaking. By April 1942, a workforce of 1500 men was deployed to pave support roads, clear forest (in a 40 m wide corridor to avoid damage from falling trees), cast and assemble supports and mechanical stations. 514 poles - with 16 standing in waterways - were raised, along with 10 driving- and loading stations as well as 25 intermediate tension stations. The tallest pillars at the crossing of the Skellefte river were 38 m tall with an internal staircase. Pole-to-pole span ranged between 11 and 429 meters. The first ore gondola was sent across the 96 km line on 14 April 1943, 370 days after construction commenced and 4 ¬Ω months ahead of schedule, . During its 45 years of operation, the cableway was periodically evaluated for its competitiveness with road transport. Numerous optimizations, including lighter gondolas and full-on automation were enacted to maintain its lead. Eventually in 1986 the circumstances had changed to the point where heavy trucks were more economical, and the ropeway was closed and demolished in the following years. At the time of decommissioning a society was founded, V√§rldens l√§ngsta linbanef√∂rening (\\"World's longest ropeway society\\"), for the preservation of the cableway. Section IV, one of the eight parts of roughly 13 km, was preserved and converted to passenger transport. As of 2013 it is still operated during the summer and a few other occasions by Linab i Norsj√∂ AB. While all mechanical installations for the rest of the system, as well as gondolas and cables were torn down, most of the support pillars were left standing along their path through the woods. The cut-down corridor is still clearly visible on satellite images, a number of support pillars can also be seen at road crossings in Google street view.

Eicosatetraenoic acid belongs to the family of eicosanoids, molecules synthesized from oxidized polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to mediate cell- cell communication. The eicosanoids, working in tandem, contribute to a lipid signaling complex widely responsible for inducing an inflammatory immune response. Common signs of inflammation are both internal and external, with effects like visible redness, pain in the surrounding area, swelling, and the sensation of heat‚Äîmany of these an effect of varying eicosanoid species. These effects are associated with and have been observed in patients suffering from cancers and various neurological/metabolic disorders. :See Essential Fatty Acid for nomenclature. Two isomers, both of them essential fatty acids, are of particular interest: * all-cis 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid is an œâ-6 fatty acid with the trivial name arachidonic acid. It is formed by a desaturation of dihomo-gamma-linolenic acid (DGLA, 20:3 œâ-6). * all-cis 8,11,14,17-eicosatetraenoic acid is an œâ-3 fatty acid. It is an intermediate between stearidonic acid (18:4 œâ-3) and eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA, 20:5 œâ-3) Some chemistry sources define 'arachadonic acid' to designate any of the eicosatetraenoic acids. However, almost all writings in biology, medicine and nutrition limit the use of the term 'arachidonic acid' to all-cis 5,8,11,14-eicosatetraenoic acid (œâ-6).  Recent Studies  ETA is found in green-lipped mussel and appears to act as dual inhibitor of arachidonic acid oxygenation by both the cyclooxygenase (COX) and lipoxygenase pathway. According to the journal of nutrition, feeding green-lipped mussel to arthritic dogs leads to an improved response. In addition to their inflammatory nature, eicosanoid molecules such as ETA can also contribute to an anti-inflammatory response. Many œâ-3-PUFAs are abundantly produced in nature and can be extracted and studied. These molecules have exhibited anti-inflammatory properties and have led scientists to believe that they may serve as relief to patients with rheumatoid arthritis, asthma, and heart disease, afflictions associated with an overly active inflammatory response. ETA, which is much less abundant in nature, has been the subject of significantly less studies. As a member of the eicosanoid family, it is expected that ETA should have a similar positive effect in the human body however there is a lack in its production and therefore a lack in its scientific investigation and understanding. Mortierella alpina 1S-4 is a fungus employed in the biological production of arachidonic acid, and so biotechnology has allowed for the biosynthesis of a mutant strain of this fungus. Mortierella alpina typically only produces ETA in trace amounts at low temperatures, making it difficult to isolate and examine. This developed mutant strain is capable of producing larger amounts of ETA due to the expression of an œâ-3-desaturase gene, typically responsible for the significant production of the more abundant PUFAs.The development of a mutant strain was considered in the context of the over-expression of the endogenous œâ-3-desaturase gene versus the heterologous Saprolegnia diclina Œî17 (sdd17m) desaturase gene. The endogenous œâ-3-desaturase gene transformed fungi had ETA at 42.1% in total lipid concentration, 84.2-fold and 3.2-fold more than two wild-type strain fungi when contrasted at a temperature of 12 degrees Celsius. While no ETA accumulation is documented at 28 degrees Celsius, the mutant strain of the fungus transformed with the heterologous sdd17mgene exhibited 24.9% of the total lipid content at the same temperature, indicating success in the genetic alteration and abundance of ETA provided for the study, at a variety of different temperatures and conditions. This allows for a more inclusive analysis of the effects of ETA on the human body and provides new insight for medical treatments to inflammatory conditions, given the newfound methods for producing and collecting these molecules for isolation and analysis. This study provides insight as to how many molecules may have multiple functions, some of which are unknown and are still being determined by scientists. The duality of molecules like eicosatetraenoic acid and other eicosanoids, both as inflammatory and anti-inflammatory molecules, is a point of compelling research.

Its focal point is a public square, formerly an open market, now officially called Smithfield Plaza, but known locally as Smithfield Square or Smithfield Market. Notable landmarks include the Old Jameson Whiskey Distillery and the Observation Tower. Notable businesses include the children's animation studio Brown Bag Films. Historically, Smithfield was a suburb of Oxmantown and lay within the civil parish of St. Paul's. There is no general agreement on the extent of the area known as Smithfield, but it roughly incorporates the area bounded by the River Liffey to the south, Bow Street to the east, Queen Street to the west, and North Brunswick street in the suburb of Grangegorman to the north. History Smithfield Market was laid out in the mid 17th century as a marketplace. Until its renovation in the early 21st Century, the square was lined with inner city 'farm yards' housing livestock. In 1964 Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor spent time here, as Burton worked on the film set in Smithfield for the film adaptation of John le Carr√©'s novel The Spy Who Came in from the Cold. Smithfield featured as Checkpoint Charlie in the movie. Smithfield was rejuvenated under the HARP (Historic Area Rejuvenation Plan). An architectural competition was held and won by McGarry NiEanaigh Architects in 1997. The restoration involved lifting more than 400,000 one hundred and twenty-year-old cobblestones, cleaning them by hand and re-laying them. Contemporary architecture and twelve 26.5 metre gas lighting masts, each with a 2-metre flame, now flank the square. Although the flames are rarely lit, the lighting mast shades can at times be seen in different colours, reflecting cultural events throughout the year. For example, they change to a vivid green shade as part of St Patrick's Day celebrations, and were changed to rainbow colours for the opening night of the 2015 GAZE International LGBT Film Festival at Smithfield's Light House Cinema. Smithfield has held many horse fields since the '80s and the tradition still continues today. Horse fairs take place every first Sunday of each month. The smell of horses can still be experienced at Smithfield at the Horse Market. And the sight and sounds on these Sundays give an impression of what Smithfield was once like, with a number of surrounding alleys and lane ways bearing obscure names relating to the equine heritage of the site.Smithfield Square evening. The square was used to hold several concerts after its renovation but these were discontinued following complaints from local residents. Although the site has not developed as a 'Western IFSC' as had been originally anticipated (in reference to the city's main financial hub to the east and its related significant 'white-collar professional' residential zones), the plaza is providing a convenient through route for local residents as well as for a number of professionals and users of a range of court and legal-related services and buildings in the area. These range from the Prison Probation Services through to the Family Court and the Law Society of Ireland, amongst others, with Smithfield and Smithfield Market situated in convenient proximity to Dublin's legal/prosecution hub of The Four Courts.  Horse fair  The Smithfield horse market. March 2008. The area is known for the historical Horse market which is held on the first Sunday of March and September. The Horse Fair used to take place every month. A Bye-law passed on 14 January 2013 reduced it to twice a year and this also established some new rules and regulations. The main causes for the change were some violent incidents and objections of nearby residents who are uncomfortable with its atmosphere, noise, perceptions of animal abuse and neglect. The Smithfield Horse Fair continues to draw heavy and sustained criticism from a wide range of sources, including An Garda S√≠och√°na and the Dublin Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals (DSPCA), legal difficulties in closing down and/or moving away the market, coupled with its centuries-old heritage, have left the city council and the horse fair defenders locked in an ongoing battle without any clear resolution ahead.  Smithfield On Ice  Smithfield on Ice, 2009. For some years, Smithfield featured an ice-skating rink around Christmastime. The last time it was opened was in 2013. A highlight was Santa's Workshop where children could clock in to help Santa's elves, paint and then meet Santa himself for gifts and photos. There was also a rink-side cafe. Features Cattle and horse trough at Smithfield Square The old Jameson Distillery Chimney tower, and its observation deck, reopened to the public in 2018 after a prolonged closure, however it has to be accessed via 244 steps rather than the lift as before. The Light House Cinema was resurrected in May 2008 in the Smithfield Square, after it had been forced to close its doors on Abbey Street on 27 September 1996. Smithfield is home to the Metropolitan Children's Court, where defendants under the age of 18 are usually dealt with. Developments Smithfield may include the satellite, and developing, Museum district to the west, and the Four Courts district to the east. These districts are largely residential and combined with the area around Smithfield square they comprise the main Liffey river frontage of Dublin 7. Recent commercial, residential and cultural developments led to the area becoming newly fashionable in the first decade of the 21st century. However, most notably in the period 2008 to 2010, stagnation set in as developments stalled and the Irish economy/property market nose-dived once the post-Celtic Tiger economic recession struck. The significant issues of variable apartment occupancy rates, coupled with closed retail spaces and a number of unfinished and unoccupied commercial units at Smithfield Market have created a highly visible reminder of the economic and community challenges still to be addressed in this historic part of Dublin. Transport The Red Luas Line skirts the square to the south, providing a convenient link to the nearby city centre, or to the far south of the city, to Tallaght or Saggart.  Accommodation  Several hotels are situated in the Smithfield Square itself. The biggest is the 3-star Maldron Hotel Smithfield, with 92 rooms, from junior suites to family rooms. The well-known European accommodation chain Generator is adjacent to Jameson Distillery Bow St. and the newest addition is The Hendrick, opened in 2019. All three hotels also have their own bars and restaurants.

The character was introduced by executive producer Leonard Lewis and appeared initially from 1993 to 1999, when Palmer opted to leave. In 2002 executive producer John Yorke brought the character back for a special spin-off show. She returned to EastEnders as a full-time character in April 2008, reintroduced by executive producer Diederick Santer. Palmer took maternity leave in 2010 and Bianca left the series in January 2011. The character returned in December 2011 after Palmer signed a \\"working mums\\" contract, which granted her leave from the soap between April and November 2012. The actress quit EastEnders in 2014 and Bianca departed in September that year. Palmer reprised the role in 2019 for a guest stint and a second guest stint was planned, but later cancelled, for the following year. During her first run on the show during the 1990s, she was known for her bizarre sense of style, her sharp tongue, fiery temper and for screaming \\"Rickaaaaaaay!\\"\\" at her husband. Bianca has been featured in storylines including affairs, feuds, bereavements, family problems, spina bifida and abortion; two problematic marriages to Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) ‚Äì the first of which ended after it transpired that she had a previous affair with her mother's boyfriend Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass); her troubled and dysfunctional reconciliation with her estranged biological father David Wicks (Michael French); her friendship with Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon); discovering her 15-year-old stepdaughter, Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), is being sexually abused by her fianc√©, Tony King (Chris Coghill), and his subsequent arrest for paedophilia; and forming a relationship with Terry Spraggan (Terry Alderton). Storylines=1993‚Äì1999 Bianca arrives with her family, mother Carol Jackson (Lindsey Coulson), Carol's partner Alan Jackson (Howard Antony), and her half-siblings Robbie Jackson (Dean Gaffney), Sonia Jackson (Natalie Cassidy) and Billie Jackson (Devon Anderson). She initially works at her uncle Ian Beale's (Adam Woodyatt) fish and chip shop before becoming the market assistant of Sanjay Kapoor (Deepak Verma). Later she runs her own clothing stall on Bridge Street market. Bianca has a short relationship with an older man, Richard Cole (Ian Reddington), but he swiftly dumps her when he grows bored and Bianca gets revenge by harassing him with pranks and stealing his credit card. David Wicks (Michael French) then enjoys mutual flirtation with Bianca until Carol informs David that Bianca is his daughter. Horrified, David promptly keeps his distance, and Bianca remains unaware of their biological relationship. Bianca enters into a relationship with Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) and they move into a bedsit together. Bianca spends much time clubbing with her childhood friend Tiffany Raymond (Martine McCutcheon) and Ricky starts an affair with Bianca's other childhood friend Natalie Price (Lucy Speed). When Bianca discovers the affair, she breaks up with Ricky and drives Natalie from Walford. One night an intoxicated Bianca is nearly assaulted. She is rescued by David and when she tries to kiss him, he confesses that he is her father. Bianca is left stunned and humiliated. Initially she feels hostile and resentful over David's absence for the majority of her life. Eventually, Bianca has a change of heart and comes to accept David as her father, becoming keen to bond with him. The relationship is further complicated, when during July 1995 David confides in the Samaritans charity (unbeknownst to any of his family) that he still feels sexually attracted to Bianca despite the knowledge that he is her biological father. A case of GSA, this was one of EastEnders most controversial and daring storylines at this point in the show's history. There is further tension when Bianca makes David uncomfortable by reconciling with and dating his stepbrother Ricky again. Bianca is confused by David's unexplained strange and occasionally hostile behaviour. David never admits to Bianca the truth behind his initial feelings towards her, but she and David eventually bond naturally as a father and daughter. Ricky and Bianca reunite and get engaged but she has sex with Lenny Wallace (Des Coleman), but soon regrets it when she fears she is pregnant by him. It's a false alarm, but she realises how much Ricky means to her, so she marries him. She becomes pregnant, but a prenatal scan shows her unborn child has spina bifida and hydrocephalus. Distraught, Bianca has an abortion, which strains her marriage. Ricky learns of her infidelity with Lenny after a STD scare. Ricky considers ending their marriage, but Bianca convinces him to give her another chance and she becomes pregnant again. She gives birth to baby Liam on Christmas Day in The Queen Victoria public house, helped by her enemy Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp), her best friend Tiffany's volatile husband. Carol returns to Albert Square with her new fianc√© Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass), unaware that Bianca had a past relationship with him when she was underage (although Dan was unaware of this fact). Bianca and Dan rekindle their affair behind Carol and Ricky's backs, until Carol discovers she is pregnant by Dan. Bianca and Ricky plan to move to Manchester so Bianca can attend fashion college there. After finding an old photo of Bianca and Dan together, Carol demands to know their history. Dan tells Carol they had a romance years ago and swears on his unborn child's life that it's all over, but Bianca confesses when questioned and is disowned by Carol. Bianca leaves for Manchester after confessing to Ricky that she no longer loves him. \\"Ricky & Bianca\\" In the two-part special episode, \\"Ricky & Bianca\\", Ricky visits Bianca in Manchester in 2002, to discuss Liam. Bianca has been expelled from university and is working in a nightclub. Struggling to support Liam, Bianca gets caught up in a plan to steal ¬£50,000 from her drug- dealing boss, Vince (Craig Charles). Ricky persuades her to return the money but Vince catches them and forces them to become his drug couriers. He sets them up, the dealers turn violent, and Bianca and Ricky narrowly escape when armed police raid the establishment. Fleeing, Ricky and Bianca spend the night together in a hotel room and decide to reunite. Ricky breaks the news to his fianc√©e Cassie (Sally Ann Triplet), who refuses to let him go and tries to convince Bianca that she'll be bored with Ricky and to give Ricky custody of Liam. Bianca decides that this is right, and Ricky looks on heartbroken as she hitches a ride in a car and departs for a destination unknown. Off-screen events (2002‚Äì2008) Off-screen, unbeknownst to Ricky, Bianca is pregnant. She starts a relationship with trucker Nathan Dean, who believes her unborn child is his. Bianca acts as stepmother to Nathan's daughter Whitney (Shona McGarty), but Nathan is killed in a traffic accident. Bianca becomes Whitney's guardian and gives birth to a daughter, Tiffany (Maisie Smith), named after her deceased best friend, but struggles financially. She becomes pregnant again during a brief relationship with Ray Dixon (Chucky Venn). Bianca meets Tony King (Chris Coghill), who supports her through her pregnancy and adopts Ray's son, Morgan Jackson-King (Devon Higgs), when he is born. Tony appears to be a good father figure to her children; however, he is a paedophile. Tony grooms a 12-year-old Whitney and they begin a sexual relationship. After giving birth to Morgan, Liam returns to live with Bianca when Ricky begins dating a woman named Melinda (Siobhan Hayes), who does not like children. Tony and Whitney's relationship continues secretly until Tony is imprisoned for assaulting a boy who propositions Whitney. 2008‚Äì2014 Bianca is evicted from her home and her children are taken into care. Bianca moves in with her grandmother Pat Evans (Pam St Clement) in Walford and with Ricky's help, she gets her children back and a waitress job. She rebuffs Ricky's declaration of love, deciding to stand by imprisoned lover Tony. When he is released, Tony resumes his affair with Whitney while Bianca wants to set a date for their wedding. He eventually agrees after winding down his affair with Whitney, to whom he is no longer attracted. Whitney tells Bianca about their relationship, just as she thinks that she and Tony will run away together. There is a massive row and Tony leaves but he is arrested by the police on suspicion of rape of a minor. Bianca and Whitney's relationship is tested while they deal with what has happened but they eventually bond again and Bianca supports Whitney through Tony's trial. A DNA paternity test confirms that Ricky is Tiffany's father. Bianca slowly realises she is in love with him, but her attempt to rekindle their romance is ruined when Ricky announces his engagement to Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook). Knowing Sam is evading a prison sentence, Bianca reports her whereabouts and Sam is arrested. A rift forms between Bianca and Ricky when the truth is revealed. However, Bianca's discovery that Sam is cheating on Ricky ends the engagement and Bianca and Ricky reunite, when Ricky accepts her marriage proposal. The couple remarry. During the ceremony, Carol arrives and brawls with Bianca but they settle their differences and begin to rebuild their relationship. When Bianca's younger brother, Billie, dies from alcohol poisoning, Carol is distraught. She is comforted by Billie's friend, Connor Stanley (Arinze Kene), and they begin an affair, while Connor is also dating Whitney. Bianca vows to remove Connor from her family's life and attacks Connor, leaving him hospitalised and eventually turns herself in to the police, refusing bail. She is sentenced to six months imprisonment. Bianca is released for Christmas and is devastated when Pat dies from pancreatic cancer. When Bianca discovers Ricky had sex with Mandy Salter (Nicola Stapleton) in her absence, they separate and he leaves Walford. Bianca struggles as a single parent and gets into debt. Owing money, Bianca steals from a market trader in desperation, but she is caught and sent back to prison. In prison, she passes a hair and beauty course and on her release, is offered a trial at Tanya Cross' (Jo Joyner) salon. However, Bianca struggles to cope and breaks down when she is alone. Bianca and Kat Moon (Jessie Wallace) form a friendship and set up a market stall together. Liam plays truant from school and Bianca worries when the police tell her she may face prison again if Liam does not return. Bianca discovers that Liam is involved in a mugging and that he has some dubious new friends. When Liam does not come home, she goes to an estate to confront the gang and collect Liam but he decides to stay with the gang and when he does come home, Bianca locks him in his room to stop him seeing the gang. She seeks advice from Ava Hartman (Clare Perkins), whose son Dexter (Khali Best) used to be in a gang. Liam returns to the gang and eventually they are arrested and released on police bail. They blame Liam and he is stabbed but is not seriously injured. When Bianca lets Liam stay at home alone, Kane sneaks in and invites Liam back to the gang. Bianca finds them as Kane is attacking Liam and attacks Kane; he is arrested. Bianca allows Liam to stay with his father. When Bianca, Shirley Carter (Linda Henry) and Jean Slater (Gillian Wright) break into Ian's restaurant, Shirley accidentally starts a fire. Bianca worries that she could go back to prison, and tells Whitney, who has been blamed for it. Jean tells Ian what happened and Ian agrees not to involve the police on the condition that Tiffany and Bobby are no longer friends. When Carol sees that Bianca is still interested in fashion, she arranges for her to attend a course in Manchester. During this time Bianca's father, David, returns and moves in. When Bianca returns, she surprises her family by announcing that her new boyfriend, Terry Spraggan (Terry Alderton), and his children, TJ Spraggan (George Sargeant) and Rosie Spraggan (Jerzey Swingler), are moving in. Bianca is devastated when Carol learns that she has breast cancer. Carol and David get engaged and Bianca learns that she has not inherited Carol's faulty cancer gene and supports her mother throughout her cancer. She ends her relationship with Terry due to the jealousy of his former wife, Nikki Spraggan (Rachel Wilde), and David leaves before marrying Carol. Bianca and Terry continue their relationship in secret and she learns that he is planning to move out of London. Terry and Bianca reunite, and at the last minute, Bianca gives Liam and Whitney her blessing to stay with Carol before taking Tiffany and Morgan to live in Milton Keynes. The following year, Robbie moves with his son Sami Jackson (Shiven Shankar) to Milton Keynes near Bianca. Bianca is invited to Whitney's wedding to Lee Carter (Danny-Boy Hatchard) the following year, however, she cannot attend and Tiffany and Morgan attend instead. Whitney later visits Bianca after her engagement to Woody Woodward (Lee Ryan) ends. Months later, Bianca is informed that Abi has died, but cannot attend. When Tiffany returns to Walford, she reveals that Bianca has tried to kill herself, but later confesses that she is lying and actually feels neglected by Bianca and Terry; Bianca consequently agrees to Tiffany living with Whitney. When Tiffany becomes involved in a drug ring, Sonia informs Bianca, who is unable to return to help.  2019  Bianca returns to Walford for Whitney's wedding to Callum Highway (Tony Clay) and wakes up in a police cell with Kat after a night out.

Whilst at the wedding reception, Bianca witnesses a man giving Tiffany a kiss on the cheek and threatens him to stay away. She attempts to make amends with Tiffany, who is upset with her for her absence. When Bianca sees Whitney getting drunk at The Queen Vic, she suggests that she attends her honeymoon alone to take her mind off Callum. Bianca then arranges a spa day with Tiffany, and when she sees the man from the wedding again, she threatens him to stay away, revealing him to be Tony's son, Leo King (Tom Wells). Leo reveals that Bianca inherited his grandmother's money and threatens to hurt Whitney and Tiffany if Bianca does not give him the money. After spending time with Sonia and Robbie, Bianca leaves Walford for a holiday for Tiffany. Bianca later returns off-screen to console Whitney after she learns Leo, who she has been dating, is Tony's son.  Creation = Background  In his book EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration, EastEnders scriptwriter Colin Brake describes 1994 as a \\"historic\\" year for EastEnders, as in April, a third weekly episode was introduced. Due to the programme's increased frequency, a number of new characters were introduced to the regular cast in the latter part of 1993 and early 1994. Among them were the Jackson family, created by Tony McHale: mother Carol (Lindsey Coulson), her four children, Bianca (Patsy Palmer), Robbie (Dean Gaffney), Sonia (Natalie Cassidy), and Billie (Devon Anderson), as well as Carol's partner Alan Jackson (Howard Antony). Though Carol and Alan were not initially married in the serial, and though Alan was only the biological father of Billie, the whole family took on Alan's surname. It later transpired that David Wicks (Michael French) was Bianca's father. Various members of the family began to appear sporadically from November 1993 onwards, but in episodes that aired early in 1994, the Jacksons moved from Walford Towers, a block of flats, to the soap's focal setting of Albert Square. Their slow introduction was a deliberate attempt by the programme makers to introduce the whole family over a long period. The Jacksons have been described by Brake as a \\"classic problem family\\". Casting Bianca as she appeared in 1993. Future Spice Girl Emma Bunton auditioned for the role of Bianca, however, it was actress Patsy Palmer who was eventually cast. Hester Lacey of The Independent has described Palmer's casting as an \\"accident\\", as she did not formally audition for the role. EastEnders casting director Jane Deitch and writer‚Äìdirector McHale visited her drama class at the Anna Scher Theatre looking for a girl aged 16 or under. Palmer was not on the list of people they wanted to see as she was older, but she caught the attention of Deitch when she was messing around and giggling with friends. At the end of the class, Palmer was asked by McHale to do something so Anna Scher asked her to improvise a monologue based on the line \\"I can't believe you just said that.\\" The next day Scher contacted Palmer to say she had been offered an audition. When she arrived at the audition, McHale told producers Palmer was 16 as she would have been refused the part. She was offered a three-month contract the same day. In 1996, Palmer commented to Lacey: \\"I've been a lucky girl. I always used to say I'd love to get in EastEnders, because I used to think 'God, I'll never get a part where I have to speak really posh', ‚Äì I'm not very good at accents.\\" Palmer was 21 when she first appeared on-screen as 16-year-old Bianca. Personality Bianca has been classified by Rupert Smith, author of EastEnders: 20 years in Albert Square, as a drama queen, a \\"strong passionate [woman]\\" and \\"Walford's trouble-maker-in-chief\\". She has also been described by Reuters as \\"feisty\\" and someone \\"who never minced her words\\". In 1996, Palmer described Bianca as someone who deserves \\"a good slap\\". She added, \\"I probably wouldn't like Bianca if I knew her in real-life. But I do love playing the character. She is so cheeky and gets to say outrageous things\\". Deemed \\"a woman you would not want to cross\\" by James Rampton of The Independent, Bianca is a tenacious foe, but a loyal friend. The way the character is portrayed, as a \\"person who wouldn't take nonsense from anyone\\", has led Rampton to comment that she embodies \\"girl power\\", a cultural phenomenon of the mid-late 1990s. He added, \\"Bianca could sulk for Britain ‚Äì and we adored her for it.\\" However, Rampton also noted that underneath Bianca's bravado, the character is capable of showing \\"the most affecting vulnerability\\". Development In her first six years in the soap, Bianca's storylines included affairs, feuds, bereavements, abortion, and a problematic marriage to Ricky Butcher. Marriage to Ricky Butcher Bianca's relationship with mechanic Ricky Butcher (Sid Owen) has been central to her narrative; their affiliation began in 1994. Palmer and Owen already knew each other before working together on the soap, as both attended the Anna Scher theatre school. Owen has said, \\"We practically grew up together. We'd known each other for years. It was weird when she started on the show and we began playing the 'Ricky & Bianca Get To Know Each Other' bit. I had already spent a lot of time with Patsy. I think we were both seven when we met.\\" The dynamics of their relationship were clear from the start, with Bianca portrayed as the dominant, bossy and authoritative partner, while Ricky was shown as the hen- pecked, dim-witted \\"loser\\" or \\"soft touch\\", comically under the thumb of his female counterpart. James Rampton from The Independent has commented, \\"to her eternally put-upon husband, Ricky, Bianca was a ferocious reincarnation of H Rider Haggard's 'She Who Must Be Obeyed'.\\" Bianca was notorious for shouting the catchphrase \\"Rickaaaaaaay!\\" (a cockney pronunciation of Ricky) at her lover, and Palmer admitted in 2008 that \\"not a day has gone by in nine years when someone hasn't shouted that from cars and even up at my bedroom window at night.\\" Rampton has suggested that Bianca's catchphrase ‚Äì \\"Rickaaaaaaay!\\" ‚Äì transitioned, becoming \\"shorthand for any sort of heinous henpecking.\\" On Friday Night with Jonathan Ross on 18 April 2008, Palmer explained that it was actually Ross, as a DJ, who had originally inspired the catchphrase. The wedding dress worn by Bianca for her wedding to Ricky in April 1997. The wedding episode was watched by 22 million viewers. One of the first notable storylines featuring the couple occurred in 1995, when Ricky embarked on an affair with Bianca's \\"put-upon sidekick\\", Natalie Price (Lucy Speed). On- screen Natalie and Ricky found themselves sidelined and bullied by Bianca, forcing them together and leading to their eventual affair, which continued for several weeks on-screen, with Ricky seeing both Natalie and Bianca. The storyline reached its climax on 21 February 1995; 17.0 million viewers tuned in to witness Bianca discovering that her boyfriend was sleeping with her best friend. The characters separated but reconciled later in the year when Ricky supported Bianca through a personal crisis ‚Äì the revelation that she had unknowingly tried to seduce her estranged father David Wicks (Michael French). Various crises between the characters were featured over the following years, causing them to break up and reconcile numerous times. In the book Seeing Things: Television in the Age of Uncertainty, author John Ellis uses the couple's combustible relationship as an example of emotional intensity and pathos: \\"A couple like Ricky and Bianca [...] can have constantly sniped at each other for several episodes, for no apparent dramatic purpose except that it is the nature of their relationship. Then they will suddenly be confronted by a life-changing decision [...] There is suddenly a shift in emotional intensity for the audience. Every word now counts, and all the previous audience attitudes of irritation or even condescension to this 'not very bright couple' [...] become a feeling of utter absorption in their dilemma.\\" The BBC has reported that Bianca and Ricky's on-off romance \\"captivated millions of fans\\", and in April 1997 attracted \\"one of the biggest soap audiences ever\\", with 22 million viewers tuning in to see them marry. In 2000, Owen stated that the storyline he most enjoyed in EastEnders was the build up and marriage to Bianca, because \\"the public's enthusiasm for the event was a great motivation\\". Spina bifida In 1997, the character was featured in a storyline about hydrocephalus (\\"water on the brain\\") and spina bifida, a developmental birth defect resulting in an incompletely formed spinal cord of the baby. After becoming pregnant with Ricky's baby, a pre-natal scan revealed that her unborn foetus had the conditions. In the storyline, Bianca agonised about whether or not to have an abortion, but eventually decided to terminate her pregnancy at 20 weeks. In scenes shown after the abortion, Bianca and Ricky were given the chance to see and hold their dead daughter, named Natasha, after the birth (Ricky was unable to do this, though Bianca later said her baby had been \\"perfect\\"), and a period of heavy grief followed as the characters came to terms with what they had done. The Peterborough-based Association for Spina Bifida and Hydrocephalus (ASBAH) helped and provided information to the programme makers during the storyline. Bianca's decision to abort reportedly angered a proportion of viewers, including parents with disabled children, who rang the BBC to complain that they showed the abortion of a disabled baby. However, many were \\"moved\\" by the storyline, and Patsy Palmer received critical acclaim for her acting throughout. Palmer was nominated in the 'Best Actress' category at the Royal Television Society Awards ‚Äì the first soap actress to ever be nominated. The storyline was later used to spread a public message. When Bianca became pregnant once again in 1998, the scriptwriters included scenes of a practitioner advising the character to take folic acid, which protects against spina bifida. The ASBAH issued a public plea to EastEnders, urging them to allow Bianca's second baby to be born with spina bifida, in order to show parents that having a baby with spina bifida is \\"not the end of the world\\". This did not occur, however, and Bianca was shown to give birth to a premature but healthy baby, Liam, in an episode that aired on Christmas Day 1998. Departure (1999) The character was featured in various other storylines, including a feud with Grant Mitchell (Ross Kemp); a tug-of-love for Ricky's affections with his first wife Sam Mitchell (Danniella Westbrook); a one-night stand with Lenny Wallace (Des Coleman), causing a sexually transmitted disease scare; and the death of her best friend Tiffany Mitchell (Martine McCutcheon). In November 1998, the BBC announced that Patsy Palmer had decided to leave EastEnders to spend more time with her family. The BBC said that Bianca would not be killed off, and a spokesman commented: \\"Bianca has always been an amazingly powerful character and the door is open to her if she wants to return in the future. She has been fantastic in the years she has been in EastEnders and we will miss her.\\" Palmer was one of several high-profile EastEnders stars to announce their departures that year; McCutcheon and Kemp also decided to leave, and Gillian Taylforth left the serial in 1998 after 13 years playing Kathy Beale. The BBC said, \\"no-one is bigger than the show, which is doing extremely well at the moment. We will send her off with all our very best wishes.\\" Richard Stokes, EastEnders' series editor and producer of Palmer's exit storyline commented, \\"you don't expect people to stay here for ever. But it's a double-edged sword. Yes, it's a shame when a well-loved character announces they're going, but the flipside is that it provides us with the space to do the best possible story. If someone is going, you can up the stakes. The whole of Bianca's story was developed once we knew she was going to go.\\" Bianca's exit storyline centred upon an extramarital affair with her mother's boyfriend Dan Sullivan (Craig Fairbrass). Lindsey Coulson, who played Bianca's mother Carol, returned to the serial especially to facilitate Palmer's exit. Carol had last been seen on- screen in 1997. When the affair was uncovered, Bianca was disowned by Carol, and her marriage to Ricky ended after Carol forced her to confess the affair to him too. Bianca's exit week was spread out over five episodes, beginning with an hour-long special on Sunday 5 September 1999 (at the time the typical weekly broadcast was 3 episodes a week). Mal Young, BBC's Controller of Continuing Drama Series, described the revelatory hour-long Bianca special as a Play For Today, and Kathryn Flett of The Guardian described the week's episodes as a \\"bravura, edge-of-the-sofa, five-night performance\\". Commenting on her exit in 1999, Palmer said, \\"It was really sad. We were all crying our eyes out ‚Äì the crew as well as the cast. The tears you see on screen are real.\\" Nicola Methven of the Daily Mirror has described the discovery of Bianca's affair as \\"one of the truly great emotion-charged scenes in soap history\\". Bianca left Walford on a train for Manchester with her son Liam, in an episode that aired in September 1999. In 2005, Bianca's exit storyline was voted as one of \\"Top 20 greatest soap moments of all time\\". Chosen by thousands of TV viewers, the televised countdown was presented by Dale Winton and aired on ITV in 2001. Spin-off (2002) In 2001, the BBC announced that Patsy Palmer and Sid Owen would reprise their roles as Bianca and Ricky, for a special spin-off, entitled EastEnders: Ricky & Bianca. Filmed in Manchester in January 2002, the two part, hour-long special reunited the characters for the first time in over two years. The spin-off or \\"soap bubble\\" was part of plans by Mal Young, the BBC controller of drama serials, to expand the EastEnders brand. He created a \\"bubbles unit\\" to make, at most, six one- off specials a year. EastEnders: Ricky & Bianca aired in May 2002, and proved a ratings winner, with more than 10 million viewers tuning in. In the spin- off, Bianca had fallen upon hard times, and accidentally got a visiting Ricky embroiled in a drugs heist. Despite talk of reconciling, Bianca opted to leave Ricky behind once again, leaving Liam in his care. The spin-off brought in various characters unrelated to the main serial, including Vince, Bianca's drug dealing boss played by Craig Charles, and Ricky's fianc√©e Cassie, played by Sally Ann Triplett. Both Ricky and Liam returned to the main serial as regular characters later that year, without Bianca. In an interview, Palmer discussed the spin-off and the reasons why she did not want to return to EastEnders: \\"I have absolutely no desire to return to EastEnders. Not at all. In fact, I think that brief spin-off of a storyline for Ricky and Bianca was a double-edged sword. On one hand, I don't think we should ever have done it, it was a mistake on my behalf. But on the other, it convinced me that Bianca was someone that I did not want to see again. She was past history as far as I was concerned, I certainly learned that. Don't get me wrong, I had the time of my life when I was in EastEnders in the middle and late nineties and I worked with some terrific people both in front of and behind the camera. But that was then and this is now ‚Äì the cast has nearly all changed and going back would be worse than foolish.\\" In August 2005, Palmer reiterated that she had no desire to return to EastEnders and branded the show \\"rubbish\\".  Reintroduction (2008)  Despite Palmer's earlier reservations, it was announced on 29 October 2007 that she would be reprising the role of Bianca. EastEnders executive producer Diederick Santer said he was \\"delighted\\" that Bianca was returning, commenting: \\"Millions grew up with her and, like the audience, I can't wait to see her back in the show. I'm really looking forward to the next chapter in her story.\\" On 30 October 2007, a day after the announcement of Bianca's return, it was announced that Sid Owen would also be returning to the show as Ricky. Owen commented: \\"It will be interesting to see what has been happening to Ricky and Bianca over the last few years. Although, I must admit I'm not looking forward to her nagging me by shouting his name.\\" Santer commented: \\"First Patsy comes home, now Sid! Ricky and Bianca were a hugely popular and well-loved partnership on the show, spawning one of the best (and perhaps most irritating) of TV catchphrases ‚Äì Rickaaaaay!\\" On 18 March 2008, Mark Jefferies of the Daily Mirror announced that Bianca would return with four children: Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), the fifteen-year-old daughter of Bianca's deceased partner Nathan; Liam Butcher (James Forde), Bianca and Ricky's son who previously appeared in the serial; Tiffany Dean (Maisie Smith), Bianca's five-year-old daughter with Nathan; and Morgan Jackson-King (Devon Higgs), Bianca's three-year-old son who \\"gets spoilt the most out of all of the kids\\". To promote the characters' return, the BBC began airing trailers across the BBC network in March 2008. One trailer utilised Bianca's \\"trademark holler\\" of Ricky's name, which is so loud that it smashes the windows of The Queen Victoria public house. The trailer features The Righteous Brothers's \\"Hung on You\\". Another trailer sees Bianca singing The Jackson 5 hit \\"I Want You Back\\" and performing a dance routine with her four children. The advertisement uses the tag line \\"Introducing The Jackson 5\\". Within three days of being posted on the video sharing website YouTube, the trailer had been viewed 52,000 times. The character returned on-screen on 1 April 2008, but made her first appearance back in the soap's setting of Albert Square the following week, drawing 10.4 million viewers and 42.6% of the total TV viewing audience. In the storyline, Bianca had fallen on hard times, and after being evicted from her flat her children were taken into custody, so Bianca returned to Walford to seek help from her grandmother Pat Butcher (Pam St. Clement). In the documentary EastEnders: Ricky and Bianca, which aired to celebrate the character's return, the changes in Bianca's character were noted: \\"The carefree, wild child of yesterday, has been replaced by the wore-torn and downtrodden single mum of four. Bianca has done what she always wanted to avoid, repeating the mistakes that her mother Carol had made.\\" EastEnders' series consultant Simon Ashdown has commented, \\"Bianca's still the same Bianca in a way, she still speaks before she thinks, comes out fists flying. She's got that family of misfit kids with different fathers [...] She's like Carol.\\" The BBC described the character's comeback as a \\"big hit\\". However, James Walton from The Telegraph accused the Jackson family of being melodramatic and \\"boring\\", adding \\"Perhaps the storyline is meant to be an updated version of [1966 BBC drama] Cathy Come Home ‚Äì yet if so, the writers have forgotten one important thing. We‚Äôre supposed to be rooting for the mother rather than for Social Services.\\" Tony King and paedophilia Bianca's most notable initial storyline upon her return was a paedophilia plot revolving around Bianca's partner Tony King (Chris Coghill), and her 15 year old step daughter, Whitney. The idea for the storyline was conceptualised by writer Simon Ashdown and other scriptwriters, when they were brainstorming ideas for Bianca's return to EastEnders. They had seen a documentary about homelessness and had been struck by an image of a woman and child at a bus stop with nowhere to go, a scene that was used to similar effect in Bianca and her family's return episode. They considered the homeless family's predicament and were left pondering \\"What might happen to them? They would be easy prey... What if a paedophile noticed the child, who might be, say, 12, and pretended to be the woman's saviour? She would be too grateful to notice that this was unusual behaviour, that he seemed to have few friends or family\\". They pitched the idea to John Yorke, controller of BBC drama production, who said that \\"It drew a sharp intake of breath. Most EastEnders stories that have been good and successful have been the ones that caused the sharp intake of breath, so they're always the kind of stories you look for.\\" However, paedophilia as a storyline had been pitched before, but the idea had been vetoed because they could not find the right storyline and characters to proceed and, as the topic was so controversial, producers had been unwilling to take the risk. Diederick Santer commented, \\"We knew that something like 16% of under-16s have been sexually abused at some point, but if you can't find a story, it's an issue that sits there, dead, on the show.\\" It has been noted in the media that paedophilia is a subject rarely shown on pre-watershed terrestrial television, and although EastEnders had broached it in 2001 with Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) and her abusive uncle Harry (Michael Elphick), this was scripted to have happened in the past and focused on the effect it had on the victim as an adult. Yorke was initially unconvinced at the Jackson paedophilia storyline proposal. He commented to The Guardian in 2008, \\"My standpoint has always been that there has to be a good editorial justification. If it's just entertainment, or just sensation, or just the bogeyman in this case, then I don't think that's a good enough reason.\\" However, Yorke was convinced by Santer who opined that \\"it would be a talking point that could truly educate and inform\\". It was decided that Bianca's stepdaughter Whitney would be the character that Bianca's boyfriend Tony groomed for sex. According to Bianca's backstory, Tony was \\"a Mancunian who [...] had one day given Bianca a lift home, three years before her return to Walford, and noticed, standing in the hallway, 12-year-old Whitney in her pyjamas.\\" EastEnders worked closely with NSPCC when devising the storyline. The NSPCC's statistics suggested that 11% of children under 16 experienced \\"sexual abuse by a person known but unrelated to them, often a boyfriend or girlfriend, while only 5% have been interfered with by someone unknown or whom they had just met; 1% by a parent or carer; and fewer than 1% by a professional in a position of trust\\". Thus it was decided that Whitney, unrelated to Tony in any biological sense, would be his victim and that Tony deliberately targeted the Jackson family, wooing Bianca, in order to groom Whitney. This idea, according to a BBC researcher, was based on real life cases. The truth was revealed to Bianca in an episode that aired in December 2008, when Whitney confessed to her stepmother, professing to love Tony. There followed Tony's imprisonment and a court case in 2009. Palmer was widely praised by critics for her performance during the reveal episodes. The storyline prompted an increase in calls to the children's help-line, ChildLine. A ChildLine director, Julie Crossan, said, \\"Child sex abuse storylines on programmes such as EastEnders also encourage children to speak out. As a result, more children now understand what sexual abuse is and are increasingly willing to turn to ChildLine for help.\\" When asked how she felt about the storyline, Palmer commented: \\"It would be brilliant if it helped somebody. If one person out there who's been abused saw that [the legal system] go out of their way to make it easier on the victim ‚Äì Whitney's evidence is given by video link ‚Äì it will be worth it.\\" Reunion with Ricky Butcher In November 2009 it was announced that coinciding with the return of her on-screen family and the 25th anniversary of EastEnders, Bianca and Ricky would remarry in February 2010. Entertainment website Digital Spy reported that: \\"Show producers have confirmed that the divorced pair's latest love twist will begin at Christmas when Ricky [...] decides to pop the question to his childhood sweetheart. Their wedding will take place in February to coincide with the Walford soap's 25th anniversary celebrations.\\" A spin-off DVD focusing on preparations for the wedding, EastEnders: Last Tango in Walford, was released in February 2010. It features Tiffany arranging a comeback for Bianca's family, plus archive footage and interviews. Palmer told What's on TV magazine: \\"I prefer it when Ricky and Bianca are not together but it's great too when they are. I'm looking forward to the return of her family. Bianca hasn't spoken to her mum since the whole Dan thing so it'll be good stuff.\\" Talking about the 25th anniversary week, Santer explained that he wanted great stories to get people talking, saying \\"That's [...] why we're doing the soap wedding of the year ‚Äì and perhaps the soap wedding of the decade ‚Äì with Ricky and Bianca. The romance played against the thriller story is a great balance, which I hope the audience will be both gripped by and satisfied with. The wedding is the perfect opportunity for us to bring back the much-loved Jackson characters ‚Äì Carol, Sonia, Robbie and Billie.\\" Temporary departures (2011‚Äì2012) On 1 August 2010, the News of the World reported that Palmer was pregnant with her fourth child and that she would take maternity leave from EastEnders later in the year. It also noted that she was already showing a baby bump. To facilitate the departure, Bianca will feature in a major storyline, which executive producer Bryan Kirkwood said was the only possible reason Bianca would have for leaving her family. In December 2010, it was announced that Natalie Cassidy would return as part of Bianca's departure storyline which started in January 2011. Bianca's departure was broadcast on 21 January 2011. Palmer gave birth earlier than expected, meaning that she started leave three weeks before she planned to. Key moments were therefore not filmed, and changes had to be made to the storyline to accommodate her absence. Bianca reappeared from December 2011, though Palmer stated in February 2011 that she was in no hurry to return, did not miss it and did not know when she would be back. On 19 July 2011, Palmer revealed that she had signed a new 'working mums' contract and would be returning before the end of the year. It was confirmed in April 2012 that Bianca, Carol and Bianca's children would depart Albert Square later that month for six months. Explaining her temporary departure, Palmer said, \\"I'm only taking time off now because this is when the kids' holidays are. When I re-signed my contract I said, 'I love EastEnders, but I love my kids more'. Listen, I can imagine staying in the show till I'm in my 60s, but it's a full-on job. If they hadn't been prepared to give me time off, I'd have had to choose the kids.\\" Bianca left the show on 27 April 2012 when she was sent back to prison for attempting to steal from the market before returning on 27 November of that year. Relationship with Terry Spraggan and departure (2014) It was announced on 23 August 2013, that Bianca's latest boyfriend, Terry Spraggan (Terry Alderton)., would arrive on the square, a short time after meeting him off- screen in Manchester.Tweets from Terry Alderton: * * It was confirmed in April 2014 that Palmer would be leaving EastEnders and her final scenes will air in the Autumn. A spokesman for Palmer said: \\"Patsy is really sad to be leaving the show as she loves playing Bianca and working with executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins but she knows it's the right decision at this time in her life.\\" The soap's executive producer Dominic Treadwell-Collins, who has decided not to kill off Bianca, said: \\"We are so sad that Patsy has decided to leave us but completely understand it's the right time for her. Bianca won't be leaving Albert Square until the Autumn so there's still a lot more to come from her on screen this year ‚Äì and the door will be left wide open for her return. We won't be getting rid of Bianca's puffa jacket just yet\\". It was revealed months later that an upcoming storyline would involve Bianca and Terry departing alongside their children, minus Liam and Whitney. A teaser for the storyline was released on 29 August 2014.  Returns (2019‚Äì2020)  On 22 May 2019, it was announced that Palmer would reprise her role as Bianca for a guest stint, five years after her departure. The decision to reintroduce the character was made by Jon Sen, the show's new executive producer, who revealed that this was \\"high on [his] wish list\\" when he joined the soap. He revealed that Bianca would feature in \\"a blistering storyline that will grip fans\\" and expressed his delight at her return. Palmer appeared on This Morning during the following month to discuss her return, confirming that she would be filming for three weeks. On the character's return, Palmer commented, \\"I've always said it's odd when major characters don't return when something [major is happening].\\" The actress also explained that as she lives in the USA, she would not be able to commit to a longer contract so the shorter one worked better for her. A trailer promoting Bianca's return was released on 23 August 2019, and the character returns in episode 5982, originally broadcast on 2 September 2019. Palmer's return marks the first time she has been invited back to EastEnders. Her agent informed her that the story team had planned a story for Bianca, so she agreed to a return. The show's senior executive producer, Kate Oates, revealed that she planned for the character to return for the show's autumn launch, since she wanted to reintroduce \\"some classic names in the show\\". Bianca returns for Whitney's wedding to Callum Highway (Tony Clay), although Callum is struggling with his sexuality and having an affair with Ben Mitchell (Max Bowden). Palmer thought that Bianca would be angry with Callum's deceit but would \\"just love him\\" after realising how much he cares for Whitney as he is \\"such a sweet guy\\". On the wedding drama, Palmer commented, \\"like any Walford wedding, things don't quite go to plan... at all.\\" On the night before the wedding, Bianca meets with Kat Slater (Jessie Wallace) for a night out, but they are arrested and have to race to the wedding. Palmer expressed how Bianca is proud to see Whitney getting married. Bianca also becomes involved in the plots featuring Tiffany. Palmer pointed out that Bianca understands that her absence in Tiffany's life has repercussions. The actress also confirmed that Bianca has been involved in trouble during her off-screen absence, which explains her silence. Palmer explained that both Bianca and Tiffany have things they should tell each other, but they are avoiding it as they want to \\"protect\\" each other. She hoped that they would be able to rebuild their relationship. Palmer enjoyed filming with the soap, but found the experience exhausting. The costume department purchased a new wardrobe for Bianca, which Palmer liked and thought reflected more modern clothing. She also liked reuniting with the cast and crew and revealed that she had maintained contact with Cassidy and McGarty, in particular, since leaving in 2014. The actress also commented on returning to the show's set, describing it as a \\"second home\\". The character's return sparks a long-term storyline for the show which would last \\"12 to 18 months\\". Oates wanted to reintroduce Bianca as part of a bigger story and wanted to create a story that \\"propels after she's gone\\". Sen added that the show's \\"diligence to the audience and the drama meant that we had to make sure it kicked off a story\\". He also confirmed that Bianca's surrounding characters would be featured in the new story as he believed that is how the \\"soap works best\\". The story was revealed during the final episode of Bianca's return stint with actor Tom Wells introduced as Leo King, the son of Tony. It emerges that Bianca spent time in prison during her absence after attacking Leo and after seeing him in Walford, Bianca threatens Leo to stay away from her family. Sen confirmed the new plot, describing it as \\"a gripping new story\\". On 21 February 2020, it was reported that Palmer had reprised the role again for a second guest stint. A show spokesperson confirmed that producers had invited Palmer to return again for Whitney's story involving Leo after she kills him in self defence. They also hinted that Bianca may not be \\"helpful\\" for Whitney. Palmer began filming the guest return in early 2020, but was unable to complete filming due to EastEnders pausing production following the COVID-19 pandemic. The actress confirmed during an October 2020 appearance on Loose Women that plans for Bianca to appear were then scrapped. Reception=Awards and nominations Palmer's portrayal of Bianca earned her a nomination for \\"Best Actress\\" at the 1997 Royal Television Society Awards ‚Äì being the first soap actress to ever be nominated ‚Äì and in 2000 she was awarded \\"Best Actress\\" at The British Soap Awards, a prize voted for by viewers. She commented on her role in her acceptance speech: \\"It's completely changed my life. It just turned it around. I have had my ups and downs as you all know. I just want to warn all the young people. Be careful because it really does change your life.\\" The role has also garnered Palmer nominations as \\"Most Popular Actress\\" at the 1996 National Television Awards, \\"Best Actress\\" at the 1999 British Soap Awards, \\"TV Soap Personality\\" at the 2009 Television and Radio Industries Club Awards, \\"Best On-Screen Partnership\\" (with Sid Owen) in the 2001 British Soap Awards, and \\"I'm a Survivor\\" at the 2009 All About Soap Bubble Awards. Critical response The character of Bianca Jackson has received critical acclaim from critics and fans alike. EastEnders executive producers Diederick Santer and Jon Sen have described Bianca as \\"one of the most popular characters EastEnders has ever had\\", and an \\"iconic creation\\", respectively. James Rampton, journalist for The Independent, has commented that she is \\"adored\\". Palmer has suggested that viewers \\"rooted\\" for Bianca because \\"people love a stroppy girl\\". In 2000, she commented, \\"[Bianca] makes them laugh. A character like that is about living out your fantasies. Everybody would love to be like Bianca and really say what they think.\\" Following her exit from the serial in September 1999, Palmer said that members of the public would approach her to plead with her to return to EastEnders, as they missed her character and relationship with Ricky. She commented in 2000, \\"It makes me feel bad. I sometimes think I should go back [to EastEnders] for everyone else's sake.\\" When the character departed the serial in 1999, Molly Blake of the Birmingham Evening Post said \\"Good riddance!\\" She described Bianca as a \\"king-sized pain in the backside [...] A screeching and screaming virago with a big mouth and pea-sized brain\\" and a \\"prize slapper [who] tormented all those whose paths [she] crossed.\\" In 1995, Chris Barker carried out television research on post-transmission perspectives of British Asian teenage viewers of EastEnders, using the character Bianca as one of the focus points. He discovered that the participants were both active and implicit in the reproduction of ideology about family relationships and gender. The males regarded Bianca as a \\"saucy cow\\", with implications of unacceptable assertiveness in women. They disliked that Ricky was pushed around by Bianca and treated as a subordinate by her friends. The author comments that \\"such a relationship appears to these boys as the world turned upside down.\\" Girls also viewed Bianca unfavourably in 1995, and the author noted that tensions in \\"girl-culture\\" ‚Äì attraction to the traditional private world of interpersonal relationships and the desire to take up more assertive characteristics in public ‚Äì manifested themselves in discussions about Bianca and her friend Natalie Price. Natalie was constructed as a \\"nice person\\" in contrast to Bianca, \\"she can relate to Ricky [...] cares for other people and doesn't just think about herself [like Bianca does]\\", qualities that were said to be constitutive of the traditional identity of women. In 2008, when it was announced that both Ricky and Bianca were being reintroduced, Santer described them as \\"a hugely popular and well-loved partnership on the show\\", and Reuters branded them two of \\"the most popular characters on the soap\\". However, Hazel Davis of The Guardian was critical about their reintroduction. She commented, \\"It's a no-brainer on the show's part. Last year, ratings for EastEnders were at an all-time low. But, just for once, wouldn't it be nice if a soap opera actually introduced new characters with verve and staying power rather than digging up the oldies?\\" Conversely, Mark Wright from The Stage said that the decision to bring these much-loved character back \\"is very welcome\\". Ruth Deller of entertainment website Lowculture praised Bianca stating: \\"Bianca and Ricky‚Äôs return has been one of the best things about [EastEnders] in the past year [...] and even when Bianca and co don't have storylines as big as the Whitney/Tony one, they still give good telly.\\" In March 2010, Bianca was voted the 'Most Popular TV Mum' in an online poll conducted by Yahoo!, gaining 26% of votes. Yahoo!'s TV editor Paul Johnston commented \\"As loud and garish as Bianca can be, she also has a huge heart when it comes to her children and would do anything to protect them. You certainly wouldn't want her turning up on your doorstep if your kids had been fighting with hers!\\" In popular culture and other media In 1999, BBC Books published a book about the character, entitled Bianca's Secret Diary. The paperback details the affair between Bianca and her mother Carol's lover, Dan. A BBC source reportedly told the Sunday Mirror: \\"We've recently dethroned Coronation Street at the top of the viewing charts, and this book has the potential to make No.1 in the best- sellers list.\\" It was released on 10 September 1999, just as the TV storyline reached its conclusion. The character was spoofed in the BBC comedy sketch show The Real McCoy. One of the show's recurring sketches featured a spoof version of EastEnders, with black comedians taking over roles of well known EastEnders characters, who frequent a pub called Rub-a-Dub. Actress and comedian Judith Jacob played the role of Bianca in the sketches. Jacob had previously appeared as a regular character in EastEnders between 1986 and 1989, as health visitor Carmel Jackson (unrelated to Bianca's family).

The building dates from Chile's colonial period. The parish belongs to the Diocese of Linares The Roman Catholic Diocese of Linares () was established in Linares, Chile, by Pope Pius XI on October 18, 1925, by means of the Bulla Notabiliter Aucto. The Diocese of San Ambrosio de Linares, a suffragan diocese of Santiago de Chile, is located in the geographical center of the country. The diocesan territory consists of two provinces, Linares Province and Cauquenes Province, and part of a third, Talca Province, all of them in the Maule Region of Chile. Compared to other Chilean dioceses, Linares has a higher proportion of rural inhabitants. Numerous chapels have been raised, particularly in rural areas, over the last twenty years. The total number of chapels in the diocese is currently more than 450. Brief History of the Diocese In 1963, the territory of the Diocese of Linares expanded to include the parishes of the then Province of Maule (currently known as the Province of Cauquenes) that belonged to the Diocese of Chill√°n, and a parish (Put√∫), carved out from Talca Province. Prior to 1925, the territory now comprised by the Diocese was part of the ancient Diocese of La Sant√≠sima Concepci√≥n ‚Äì- now the Archdiocese of Concepci√≥n. The see of the Diocese and residence of the bishop is the city of Linares. The beautiful Cathedral Church is dedicated to Saint Ambrose of Milan. Beginnings of Catholicism in the Region Catholic evangelization in Chile began in the middle of the 16th century, shortly after the arrival of the Spaniards. Pedro de Valdivia granted Juan Jofr√© de Loaiza the encomienda of Peteroa, north of the Maule river on November 1, 1552, and shortly after, on 1554, Doctrina de PeteroaThe site where the evangelical proclamation took place was called a doctrina and the person in charge of a doctrina was a doctrinero. In general, the terms missionary and doctrinero had the same meaning was created under the care of priest Juan de Oc√©s, son of Don Rodrigo de Oc√©s, with orders to cross to \\"other towns\\" of remaining Indians to the north and south of the Maule river. As a result of the successful campaigns in southern Chile, the Diocese of Imperial was created on March 22, 1563. Following the Arauco War Bishop Don Reginaldo de Liz√°rraga went to the King Felipe III to obtain from the Pope the annexation of his Bishopric to the one of Santiago, to which the Supreme Pontiff acceded provisionally. This situation persisted from 1609 until 1623. On February 18, 1585, the third Bishop of Santiago in his detailed report to King Felipe II mentions the missions of \\"Longomilla and Purapel\\", \\"Chanco and Loanco\\" taken care of by the presb√≠tero Francisco de Maestanza, with a salary of three hundred and eighty pesos in gold and food. The Doctrinas of Cauquenes and Putag√°n When the Dioceses of Santiago and La Imperial were erected (in 1561 and 1564, respectively), the Maule river was considered the dividing line between the two dioceses. However, it seems that the division was not sufficiently clear because the Bishop of Santiago, Fray Diego de Medell√≠n (1576‚Äì1592), created two docrinas south of the Maule river that remained under the jurisdiction of the Santiago bishops for more than one hundred and seventy years. The doctrinas at issue were Cauquenes and Putag√°n. Cauquenes was erected in an area inhabited by the \\"cauquenes\\" Indians, who gave name to the region and the doctrina that was based there. In 1739 the Doctrinero Don Jos√© de Rozas and Amaza, who resided in Chanco, built a chapel in the seat of Cauquenes, the same place where Don Jos√© Antonio Manso de Velasco later founded the Villa de Nuestra Se√±ora de las Mercedes de Jos√© de Manso de Tutuv√©n (Town of Our Lady of the Mercedes de Jos√© de Manso of Tutuv√©n, now Cauquenes) on May 9, 1742. Cathedral of \\"San Ambrosio\\", Linares The Cathedral of San Ambrosio de Linares The Cathedral Church of San Ambrosio, of Linares Diocese, is considered to be one of the most important and finest religious buildings erected in Chile in the twentieth century. It replaced the original cathedral, after the latter was destroyed by an earthquake, in 1928. The new cathedral was conceived by bishop Juan Subercaseaux Err√°zuriz and its works were conducted by the renowned Chilean architects Carlos Bresciani and Jorge del Campo, the same duo that would be responsible, several years later, for the construction of another remarkable religious building, that of the parish church of Sagrado Coraz√≥n (Sacred Heart) in Providencia, Santiago de Chile. Mgr. Subercaseaux gave a great initial impulse to the construction of the Linares Cathedral, which has been characterized as \\"the plastic expression of his refined artistic culture\\". Mgr. Subercaseaux, a dynamic and enterprising man, was not deterred by the shortage of resources available for the great work that had to be done. In his travels abroad, he was untiring to ask for greater resources for his diocese, which badly required some material aid that would help to finance the cathedral works and additional priests. In several countries (Italy, Germany, the United States, France, the Netherlands) Mgr. Subercaseaux appealed to the local Catholics in their own languages, urging them to contribute to the progress of his far-away diocese. The cathedral was built according to the model of the famous Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio of Milan, built in Romanesque style and begun in the 4th century. The cathedral apse is remarkable for the outstanding mosaic work made by the Italian-born artist Giulio Di Girolamo. This mosaic work is one of the most important of its sort in South America. On the 18 October 2006 the remains of Giulio Di Girolamo's wife, Elvira, brought from Italy, were buried in the Cathedral together with those of her husband, who had died in 1998 and had been buried in the Cathedral years before.

This frigate was launched in 1779 at Deptford and sold in 1816. Pegasus had a relatively uneventful career and is perhaps best known for the fact that her captain from 1786 to 1789 was Prince William Henry, the future King William IV. By 1811 Pegasus was a receiving ship at Chatham; she was sold in 1816. Service Pegasus was commissioned in May 1779 under Captain John Bazely and attached to George Rodney's fleet for the relief of the Great Siege of Gibraltar. She therefore was present at both of Rodney's actions in the campaign to relieve the fortress, participating in the seizure of a Spanish armaments convoy off Cape Finisterre on 8 January 1780 and subsequently fighting at the Battle of Cape St Vincent eight days later.The Naval Chronicle, 1805 Vol. 14, p. 180 Pegasus continued on with Rodney to Gibraltar and then to the West Indies where she participated in the inconclusive Battle of Martinique in April 1780. Bazely carried the dispatches of the battle back to Britain and was soon given command of Apollo.The Naval Chronicle, 1805 Vol. 14, p. 181 Pegasus sailed again, now under Captain John Stanhope, for the Leeward Islands in January 1781. She returned home in August, but subsequently returned to the Caribbean. On 23 January 1783 she captured the Allegeance, a former Royal Navy sloop that the French were using as a transport and that was carrying 200 troops. Pegasus paid off into ordinary in April 1783. In 1786 Henry Harvey became captain of the recommissioned Pegasus for service on the North America station but was disappointed to discover that his first lieutenant was Prince William Henry. The issue was that the Admiralty expected Harvey to turn over the captaincy to his subordinate as soon as the ship was at sea. Controlling his disappointment, Harvey conducted the affair with \\"such discretion as secured to him the lasting friendship of His Royal Highness\\".Harvey, John, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography Within weeks, Harvey had been transferred to HMS Rose and aboard her joined Pegasus in peacetime maneuvers off the North American station until Rose was paid-off in 1789. Prince William Henry in dress uniform painted by Sir Martin Archer Shee, c.1800. From 1786 to 1788, Pegasus, under Prince William Henry, was largely assigned to patrol the east coast of Canada and Newfoundland, as well as the West Indies. In late 1786, Pegasus was stationed in the West Indies under Horatio Nelson, who wrote of Prince William Henry, \\"In his professional line, he is superior to two-thirds, I am sure, of the [Naval] list; and in attention to orders, and respect to his superior officer, I hardly know his equal.\\"Ziegler, p.59 Prince William Henry's First Lieutenant was William Hargood, who the prince had brought with him. Other officers or crew aboard Pegasus at this time who would rise in rank were Thomas Byam Martin, John Pasco, and Charles Rowley. The prince was given a mentor, Isaac Schomberg, but that did not go well and required Nelson's intervention to resolve. Nelson also arranged for the transfer of William Johnstone Hope, who too had been appointed to Pegasus but had failed to get on with the prince. Pegasus returned to Plymouth and was decommissioned in March 1788. Herbert Sawyer was promoted to Post-Captain in January 1789, and took command of Pegasus to begin her next commission. He served aboard her on the North American Station, operating off Newfoundland. On 8 July 1790 she grounded on Annet, within the Isles of Scilly but refloated on the flood tide undamaged. French Revolutionary Wars On 14 July 1793 Pegasus sailed with the Channel fleet from St. Helen's. On 18 July she was west of the Scilly Isle. On 31 July she briefly sighted but was unable to close the French fleet, so she returned to Torbay on 10 August. Thirteen days later she was with the Channel Fleet, escorting the Newfoundland trade and West Indian convoys while they were in home waters. By 23 October she was sailing in search of the French fleet and squadrons. On 18 November the Fleet in a brief skirmish with a French squadron; by mid-December the fleet had returned to Spithead. HMS Defence at the Battle of the Glorious 1st of June 1794, by Nicholas Pocock In May‚ÄìJune 1794 the Channel Fleet fought the Battle of the Glorious First of June, during which it captured six ships of the line and sank a seventh. On 13 June the fleet arrived back in home ports. While under the command of Robert Barlow, who had been posted to Pegasus, she had served as a repeating ship for Admiral Howe's signals at the battle. Barlow transferred to the frigate as a reward. At the battle, Pegasus had as passenger Nicholas Pocock, the maritime artist. On 14 February 1795 the Channel fleet sailed from Torbay for a brief cruise and to see various convoys safe out of the Channel. In May 1796 news reached Admiral Adam Duncan, operating in the North Sea,United Service Magazine (1841), 380. that a Dutch squadron consisting of the 36-gun Argo and three brigs and a cutter had departed Flickerve, Norway, bound for the Texel. Duncan despatched a squadron of his own to intercept them, consisting of the frigate Ph≈ìnix, under Captain Lawrence William Halsted, the 50-gun , Pegasus and the brig-sloop , all under the overall command of Halsted.Allen (1852), 428 The British intercepted the Dutch at 5am on 12 May, with Phoenix and Leopard chasing Argo, while Pegasus and Sylph made after the brigs. Leopard eventually fell some way behind, and consequently it was Phoenix alone that brought Argo to the Action of 12 May 1796. Meanwhile, Pegasus and Sylph forced two of the brigs aground and took the small vessel accompanying the Dutch, which turned out to be a former British vessel, Duke of York. They then captured the third brig, the 16-gun Mercury. The Royal Navy took both Argo and Mercury into service, the Argo becoming Janus while Mercury became . In 1800, under Capt. John Pengelly, Pegasus was fitted out as a troopship, armed en fl√ªte. Between 8 March and 2 September 1801 Pegasus participated in the siege of Alexandria. Because Pegasus served in the navy's Egyptian campaign, her officers and crew qualified for the clasp \\"Egypt\\" to the Naval General Service Medal that the Admiralty authorised in 1850 to all surviving claimants. Napoleonic Wars In 1803 she was in the Mediterranean. By May 1805 she was a guardship at Harwich. By 1811 Pegasus was a receiving ship at Chatham. Fate Pegasus was sold in 1816.

It has 2 Peruvian leagues. History The club was founded on 9 June 1902 by young students of the Instituto Chalaco in the Marco Polo N¬∫ 19 street, house of the captain Mr. Federico Rinc√≥n, father of one of the student founders. His first President was Cesar Rivera, who at the same time was the captain of the team and he was appointed like Honorary President to August Cazorla, director of the institute. Very fast the club conquer the affection of the Callao leaving indelible testimonies through many generations who won the triumphs that helped the contact and development of the town. He is known popularly as the Le√≥n Porte√±o and the \\"Decano del Futbol Porte√±o\\". Its debut was a 24 September of the year 1902, facing to the Sport Victoria, winning Chalaco for 1‚Äì0. Little by little went emphasizing among the clubs of the Callao of that epoch beginning to compete against the Lima clubs in some encounters that even they finished in pitched battle. The first National Olympic was carried out by the year 1917, and in the Championship of soccer was imposed as unbeaten, obtaining as prize a great shield that was exhibited in its old localities of the (Today Av. S√°enz Pe√±a) counting in its rows with some of the most representative players of the epoch as Telmo Carbajo and Claudio Mart√≠nez. On 7 September 1924, forming a combined with the club Uni√≥n Buenos Aires, rout to the Uruguayan selection for 1 to 0, in a historic match set against the Uruguayans. They emphasized in said match the players: Enrique √Ålvarez, Alfonso \\"El sereno\\" Saldarriaga, Antonio Maquil√≥n, Faustino Mustafich, Jos√© \\"Patuto\\" Arana, Enrique Salas, F√©lix Mu√±oz, Esteban Dagnino, Manolo Puente and Juan Sudman. In 1928 it becomes the first Peruvian team that travel to Quillota ‚Äì Chile to play a home run of soccer, before the teams of San Luis, Santiago Wanderers, Colo-Colo and others, in order to curing injuries on the War of the Pacific between both countries and of 8 matches that maintains with the main teams, alone loses one in his d√©but front upon Colo-Colo. In 1930, the club is consecrated like Champion of the Peruvian Soccer upon conquering to the Alianza Lima for 2‚Äì1 in the last date, they played for the team: Enrique √Ålvarez; P.Ureta, Mart√≠nez, Enrique Salas, Juan Rivero, Faustino Mustafich, Jos√© Arana, Mi√±√°n, Miguel Rostaing, Manolo Puente and Miguel Arana. In 1947, after a great campaign and under the presidency of Mario Chiabra, the Atl√©tico Chalaco, be consecrated again National Champion, they participated in said championship under the direction of the coach \\"Patuto\\" Arana the following players: Humberto Becerra, Eliseo Moral, Rene Rosasco, Juan Lecca, F√©lix Mina, \\"Perejil\\" Reynaldo Luna, Ernesto \\"Chicha\\" Morales, Guillermo Aguilar, Luis Rodriguez, Domingo Raffo (captain), Carlos Torres, Juan \\"Cartucho\\" Castillo. Also they participated Juan Alcazar, Francisco Viacava, Julio Navarrete, Armando Agurto, Bejar and Leon. In 1948 they were national Sub-Champions, in that year they travelled to Guayaquil, Ecuador after a brilliant campaign they returned unbeaten. In the 1950s the team earned the nickname 'Ballet Porte√±o' by its good play emphasizing the Paraguayan goalkeeper Adolfo Riquelme, Andr√©s Bedoya, Sabino B√°rtoli, Luis Portanova, Jacinto Villalba, Germ√°n Colunga, Rene Rosasco, Felix Mina, Santiago Armandola, Gualberto Bianco, Antonio Aguiar and Luis L√≥pez. In that decade the club achieved the subchampionships of the 1957 and 1958. The first one lost it before the Centro Ique√±o and in the following one defined in a Clasico Porte√±o in last date before its rival neighbor the Sport Boys, to which surpassed in the board by a point, but could not celebrate that classic therefore fell defeated by 1 to 0 and consequently lost the National Title. In 1962 it entered a phase of economic difficulties that carried it to lose the category descending to play in the Second Division where was maintained until 1965, when descends to the First Amateur in the League of the Callao. After an intense fight by recovering its seat of honor, in 1971 was champion in the League of the Callao and upon winning the home run of the Interligas to the teams of Lima elevates to the Second Division. In 1972, including Alberto \\"Toto\\" Terry as the coach, champion in the Second Division after winning for 2 ‚Äì 1 to the Porvenir Miraflores achieving the ascent to the First Division. The Callao entire dressed of festival with the triumph of the Chalaco and its return to the maximum category of the Peruvian soccer. In 1979, with the technical direction of Cesar Cubilla, the club of Callao was runner-up and is classified to represent to Peru in the Copa Libertadores 1980 next to the team of the Sporting Cristal facing to the teams champions from Argentina the River Plate and the V√©lez S√°rsfield. Of that staff they emphasized Fernando Apolinario, Augusto Prado, Oscar Arizaga, Victor Benavides, Javier Chirinos and Alberto Castillo. The year 1985 remains last in the Metropolitan tournament and descends. Since then, carried out irregular campaigns in the League of the Callao. In 1987 it could return to the maximum category of the soccer rented but loses in the definition of penal before Guardia Republicana. In recent years the Le√≥n Porte√±o assembled good teams and advanced in the Peru Cup, but failed to surpass the Regional phase of the versions 2000, 2002, 2005 and 2007. 15 October 2003, the new history for the club is written, the third penal room of justice of the Callao, returns to the historic club to the port next to its supporters after 20 years of arduous fight, this process had its fruit therefore in a very slow lethargy after 10 \\"committee of recovery\\" the last one that achieved this great feat, was the headline by. In the 2008 it is elected president Alex Kouri, doing an important investment to achieve the title of the Peru Cup and the ascent to First Division, nevertheless again only he would arrive to the Regional Phase where would be eliminated by the Union Supe that defeated it in both matches. 18 February 2009 Kouri renounced the presidency, taking on the job in a temporary way Abelardo D¬¥Angelo Cobos.

Amatus of Montecassino (), (11th century) was a Benedictine monk of the Abbey of Montecassino who is best known for his historical chronicles of his era. His History of the Normans (which has survived only in its medieval French translation, L'Ystoire de li Normant), is one of three principle primary sources for the Norman Conquest of southern Italy--the other two being the histories of William of Apulia and Geoffrey Malaterra. Amatus describes the Normans from the perspective of his abbey, one of the most important religious and cultural centers in Italy at the time. His history is the earliest extant account of the Norman sieges of Bari and Salerno, their conquest of Sicily, and the careers of both Robert Guiscard and Richard Drengot, as well as the Gregorian Reforms seen from the papal point of view.  Background  Nothing is known for certain about Amatus before he became a monk. Possibly having been born in Salerno, Graham Loud suggests that he might have served as the Bishop of Paestum in the 1050s, prior to his admission into the monastery. He wrote primarily while Desiderius (later Pope Victor III) ruled as abbot. Previous to the ascension of Desiderius, the relationship between Montecassino and the Normans in the area had been an antagonistic one. Desiderius' election as abbot, however, coincided with Richard Drengot's annexation of Capua, after which Dregnot became the protector and patron of the abbey, which heavily affected Amatus' writings. His extremely negative treatment of Gisulf II of Salerno throughout his history may indicate some previous hostilities between the two, and Gisulf is known to have been limiting church privilege around Salerno in the 1050s.  The History of the Normans  Amatus' L'Ystoire de li Normant chronicles the history of the Normans in Southern Italy, from their arrival to the death of Richard Drengot of Capua. Kenneth Baxter Wolf hypothesizes that, because the stated purpose of the history is to commemorate the deeds of Richard of Capua and Robert Guiscard, that Amatus (or Abbot Desiderius) was prompted to write because of Richard's death in 1078. Amatus' chronicle was written soon after 1080, making it the first of the Norman histories of Southern Italy to be written Originally written in Latin, the text now only survives in a fourteenth-century French translation commissioned by a \\"conte da Militr√©e,\\" who was possibly connected to the Angevin dynasty of the Kingdom of Naples. However, the work was not only translated, but also summarized and abridged at points. Despite this, Wolf argues that comparisons with the second version of the Chronica monasterii Casinensis, written by Leo Marsicanus and incorporating parts of Amatus's original text, suggest that the corrupted French translation is not completely inaccurate.  In popular culture  The historical novel by Gabriella Brooke, The Words of Bernfrieda: A Chronicle of Hauteville (Cheney: Eastern Washington University Press, 1999) tells of the Lady Fredesenda of Hauteville, mother of Robert Guiscard, as seen by her handmaid, who has met Amatus and intends to record \\"all that Amatus' chronicle will leave out\\".

It included power-management capabilities and an 8KB internal CPU cache, which enabled it to yield comparable performance to 386DX processors of the same clock speed, which were considerably more expensive. Known inside IBM as \\"Super Little Chip\\" for its initials, it was used in the IBM PS/2 35, 40 and 56 Series and in the IBM PS/ValuePoint 325T, but never gained much market share. This was mainly due to an agreement with Intel, in which IBM was not allowed to sell their CPUs if they were not part of a system or upgrade board. It was also marketed as an optional upgrade for 8086-equipped IBM PS/2 25 Series computers. Design and Technology Built with complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS) technology, the IBM 386SLC had a 161-square millimeter die. It was available with clock speeds of 16, 20, and 25 MHz. The 25 MHz model produced only 2.5 watts of dissipated power, making it especially well suited for laptops and other portable devices. Despite the fact that the SLC and DLC chips are bus compatible with i386SX and i386DX respectively, they can not be used as drop-in replacements as they are not pin-compatible. IBM 486SLC Is an improved version of the IBM 386SLC, based on the Intel core. IBM 486SLC featured 16Kb of L1 cache and the i486 instruction set. It had 1.349 million transistors and a 69mm¬≤ die. It was manufactured in 1992. It came in a 100-pin BQFP package, with 33 MHz FSB speed. The 486SLC was also available in a clock-doubled version, the 486SLC2 (50 & 66 MHz), and later in a clock tripled-version, the 486SLC3 (60, 75, & 100 MHz). Clock-for-clock, it was substantially faster than the similarly-named Cyrix part, yielding performance broadly comparable to a similarly-clocked 486SX in the 16-bit applications of its day. However, its narrow 16-bit bus, limited memory addressing capability (16 MB) and lack of on-chip FPU would prove to be major disadvantages under the new generation of 32-bit operating systems (such as Windows 95) that would become popular in following years. It is suspected the clock tripled 486SLC3 part did not in fact actually exist as a stand-alone product. All known instances of 486SLC3 CPUs are reportedly in the 132pin PQFP packaging with the extra address lines not connected (a 486BL3 running in 16-bit mode). IBM 486BL (Blue Lightning) Blue Lightning upgrade badge. The 486BL is a fully 32-bit version of the 486SLC, with 1.4 million transistors on a 82mm¬≤ die, using a 0.8 ¬µm CMOS process. It came in a 132-pin QFP package. In July, 1993 IBM produced clock-doubled and clock-tripled versions of the chip, the 486BL2 and 486BL3. The chips were available from 50 to 100 MHz and were sold by IBM only. IBM 486BL2 IBM later marketed Socket 3 168-pin PGA Blue Lightning 486 CPUs, but these are technically not related to earlier Blue Lightning models as they are based on the Cyrix Cx486 CPU core. They can be distinguished by the inclusion of a \\"DX\\" (or DX2, DX4) legend somewhere on the label, setting them apart from the earlier 386-derived, nominally 486SX- equivalent processors. IBM's adoption of Cyrix cores for their self- manufactured CPUs, very restricted release of information regarding the earlier generations, and policy of only printing cryptic in-house part numbers on first-generation Blue Lightning chips rather than any easily recognised family name has led to some confusion amongst the retro/low-end PC community as to their actual name. As a result the first-generation BLs are often commonly referred to as \\"486DLC\\" (and 486DLC2, DLC3/4) CPUs, a logical and 386-alike progression from the 16-bit SLC models - even though IBM themselves do not appear to have used that name in any official materials, simply calling them \\"Blue Lightning\\" or shortening the name to \\"486BL\\". The \\"486DLC\\" name itself is instead one used by Cyrix for their wholly distinct (from IBM/Intel's product) predecessors to the \\"4x86\\" generation (itself the basis of IBM's later 486DX line), as openly and clearly printed on the processor cases. However, in the absence of any better common name for the line, \\"IBM 486DLC\\" has stuck, and in practice it would be difficult to confuse any two of the three different model lines for each other due to clearly different packaging and branding.

She graduated from Williams College in 1987. Muller has spent the past twenty years traveling alone to remote cultures and conflict zones to bring home stories about people and places. She has published three books (Hitchhiking Vietnam, Along the Inca road, and Japanland), produced numerous international television documentary series, and is a frequent lecturer for the National Geographic Society and universities throughout the United States. Her first expedition took her to the Ho Chi Minh Trail in Vietnam, which enabled her to produce a PBS television special, Hitchhiking Vietnam, and a companion book by Globe Pequot Press of the same name. Her second expedition took her to the Inca Road, a four-thousand-mile trek from Quito, Ecuador to Santiago, Chile resulting in a 3-part television series, Along the Inca Road for National Geographic and a book published by the Adventure Press. Muller's third adventure took her to Japan, where she lived with a pre-Buddhist mountain ascetic cult, joined a samurai-mounted archery team, and completed a 1,300-kilometer pilgrimage around Shikoku. This journey was published in Japanland: A Year in Search of Wa, as both a 4-hour documentary series and book. She took no camera crew or companions, or even much money, and went on foot and emerged profoundly changed and understanding more, but also realized as a \\"typical\\" American she could not really become Japanese.Karin Muller Rolf Potts July 2006 retrieved 23 October 2008 In February 2013 PBS released Muller's documentary, Cuba's Secret Side.

Most remarkably, it details a Cuban humanitarian crisis that happened in the early 1990s only 90 miles from the shores of the United States. In March, 2014, PBS released Muller's next documentary, Sudan's Secret Side., documenting Muller's three-three month journey alone through Chad and Sudan. Muller explored the thriving Sudanese refugee camps, embedded with rebels and government soldiers, and filmed stories of nomadic goat herders and sultan's wedding ceremonies. In May, 2016, Muller's current documentary, Egypt Beyond the Pyramids will premiere nationwide on public television. Muller spent 9 weeks in Egypt, living with Cairo's garbage collectors, Nile fishermen, and Bedouin nomads. She spent weeks in Tahrir Square covering the Morsi revolution, only to be severely injured by a mob in a remote village in the Nile Delta and flown back to the States for emergency surgery.

It connects the Greater New Haven area to Northwestern Connecticut via the western suburbs of Waterbury. Route description Route 63 follows a mostly northwest-southeast path its entire route, and is mostly a 2 lane road with some 4 lane sections. It begins at the corner of Whalley Avenue and Fitch Street in New Haven where Route 10 turns onto Fitch Street. Heading northwest on Whalley Avenue, it almost immediately passes the eastern end of Route 243 and the northern end of Route 122. About 0.6 miles later, it leaves Whalley Avenue for Amity Road at the southern end of Route 69. It then passes under the Wilbur Cross Parkway (Route 15), offering southbound access only. After crossing into Woodbridge, the road becomes less suburban in nature. In Woodbridge, it intersects the eastern end of Route 114, and the southern/eastern end of Route 67. It then crosses into Bethany, where it has a brief (0.1 mile) concurrency with Route 42. It then enters Naugatuck, where the road takes on a more suburban character. It then meets the Route 8 expressway at Exit 26 before crossing the Naugatuck River into the downtown area. It then passes by the western end of Route 68 before becoming more rural again. After clipping the southwest corner of Waterbury, it enters Middlebury. After meeting the northern end of Route 188, it intersects I-84 at Exit 17, with access to/from the west. Access to/from I-84 east is provided by Route 64 at the next intersection. Route 63 then enters Litchfield County and the town of Watertown. Here it is a major retail strip in the southern part of town. It meets the northern end of Route 73 before crossing US 6 in the center of town. It then becomes a minor arterial road north of town, and passes by the eastern end of Route 132 before entering Morris. In Morris, it has junctions with Route 109 and the northern end of Route 61. It then enters Litchfield, where it meets US 202 at the Litchfield Green. Leaving Litchfield, Route 63 becomes a minor rural road as it passes into Goshen. It meets Route 4 at a traffic circle in the center of town. North of there, it passes into Cornwall, where it meets the north end of Route 43, then into the town of Canaan. It has one junction with the southern end of Route 126, which leads to Falls Village. Route 63 ends approximately 1.5 miles later at US 7. A section of the road in Litchfield is a designated state scenic road. History Route 63 was designated in 1932 and originally connected Morris to Woodbridge using the alignment of the Straits Turnpike, an early 19th-century toll road connecting New Haven to Litchfield. Route 63 is still locally called the Straits Turnpike in Middlebury and Watertown. In the mid-1940s, Route 61 between Morris and Cornwall was reassigned to an extended Route 63. Another extension happened on September 11, 1951 when Route 63 took over part of Route 43 from Cornwall to Canaan where it ends today. In 1954, Route 63 was extended south to US 1 via an overlap with Route 10.

New Jersey, 211 U.S. 78 (1908), was an case of the U.S. Supreme Court. In this case, the Court established the Incorporation Doctrine by concluding that while certain rights enumerated in the Bill of Rights might apply to the states under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause, the Fifth Amendment's right against self-incrimination is not incorporated. The Twining decision was overturned by the decision in Malloy v. Hogan in 1964, in which the Court incorporated the right against self-incrimination. Background The case involved two men charged with fraud in New Jersey who claimed Fifth Amendment protection and refused to testify during their trial. The jury was told of the men's refusal to testify, and they were convicted. They appealed, arguing that the instructions to the jury violated their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination. Majority decision The Supreme Court used the case to decide whether the Fifth Amendment right against self- incrimination was valid during trials in state courts, not just in federal courts. Before the adoption of the Fourteenth Amendment, the Bill of Rights, including the Fifth Amendment, did not apply to state courts. The Court did not reach the question of whether the defendants' Fifth Amendment rights were actually violated in the original trial. The majority opinion was delivered by Justice William Henry Moody. Justice John Marshall Harlan was the lone dissenter. Moody considered both the Privileges or Immunities Clause and the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment: \\"The general question, therefore, is whether such a law violates the Fourteenth Amendment either by abridging the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States or by depriving persons of their life, liberty or property without due process of law.\\" Privileges or immunities The court cited the decision in the Slaughter-House Cases that the language in the Fourteenth Amendment (\\"No state shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States...\\") did not curtail state power. The Supreme Court decided 8-1 that the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination applied only to federal court cases. Selective incorporation The case provides an early explanation of the doctrine of selective incorporation: only a portion of the Bill of Rights is applied to the states by incorporation, under the Fourteenth Amendment's Due Process Clause: The court concluded that exemption from self-incrimination was not necessary for a conception of due process. Dissent Justice Harlan was the lone dissenter, writing firstly that the Court should have decided whether the defendants' rights were actually violated before reaching the \\"question of vast moment, one of such transcendent importance\\" of whether the Fifth Amendment applied to state courts and if the Fifth Amendment applied to state courts by the Due Process Clause. Aftermath=Upheld in 1947 The Twining decision was revisited and upheld in Adamson v. California (1947) in which the merits of Twining were of central consideration. Concurring with the majority, Justice Frankfurter wrote: However, Justice Hugo Black disagreed and attacked Twining for giving too much power to state courts. In his famous dissent to Adamson, he wrote: Overturned in 1964 Twining was revisited once again and finally overturned in Malloy v. Hogan (1964). In that case, the Court incorporated the Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination and applied it to state courts.

After a tandem paraglider flew into the cables, operations had to be temporarily stopped. 132 people were flown from the top station back down to the valley. 30 passengers in the lower gondola had to be lowered by rope from a height of about 50 metres, an operation lasting into the evening. 19 passengers and the cable car operator in the upper gondola could not be rescued by helicopter until the morning of 13 August 2011, due to strong winds.

Podesta and his wife Marcella. In 1972, Bob Kieve and Santa Clara Broadcasters bought KREP for $470,000 and changed the call letters to KARA, with an English-language adult contemporary format. From 1997 to 2000, KARA was the flagship station for the San Jose Sharks hockey team before KUFX took over in 2000. Spanish music (2002‚Äì2014) Kieve sold KARA in 2002 to Hispanic Broadcasting of Dallas, and KARA became KEMR with a Spanish music format at midnight on April 1 that year. Between 2003 and June 27, 2005, KVVF was the \\"pop, rock y reggaeton\\" station, Viva 105.7, also owned by Univision.

Programmed as a Rhythmic Top 40 with a focus on hit-driven hip hop and R&B;, KVVF's target is a bilingual and younger Hispanic audience (mostly around the Southern portion of the Bay Area surrounding Santa Clara County), patterned after sister station KBBT in San Antonio. In a statement from Station Content Director Mark Arias, ‚ÄúWe just feel like The Bay Area has been asking for something new and fresh. It‚Äôs a format they call Top 40/Rhythmic with a little bit of hip-hop, R&B; and Top 40 crossed-over.‚Äù In March 2016, after two years of modest ratings (it barely registered in Nielsen's San Francisco ratings) and difficulty competing with KMEL and KRBQ, KVVF de-emphasized its hip hop and R&B; direction and added more rhythmic friendly pop hits. Due to 105.7's strong signal over the South Bay, it also changed focus on the whole Bay Area region to concentrate on mostly San Jose and South Bay listeners as well as listeners in nearby Monterey Bay to the south. Univision has opted to retain its simulcast on KVVZ in the process. In November 2017, they further adjusted their playlist by adding Latin hits and adopting what is essentially a three way hybrid of Rhythmic, Mainstream and Spanish CHR.

It connects the two banks of the Rhine at the height of Cologne's Zoo Bridge (Zoobr√ºcke). History The cable car over the Rhine was opened on April 26, 1957 in time for the opening of the biannual German horticultural show, the Bundesgartenschau; it connects the exhibition sites at Rheinpark with those on the other riverside, close to Cologne Zoo and Flora/Botanical Garden. Amongst its first guest were the President of Germany, Theodor Heuss, and Federal Chancellor and former Mayor of Cologne, Konrad Adenauer. In 2010 in Koblenz another aerial tram crossing the Rhine opened, because of the 2011 edition of the Bundesgartenschau. In 1963, the cableway was closed and dismantled because it stood on land needed for the new Zoo Bridge. It was reopened after protracted discussions, but the route had to be changed in response to irritated drivers who did not want the cable car over the bridge. The suspension tower was slightly turned and the support was moved to a location in the Rhine Park. The new extended Rhine cableway re-opened on 22 August 1966. The Stadtbahn station at Zoo/Flora opened in 1974. Today, the cable cars cross the thermal baths known as the Claudius Therme, which were built later in the Rheinpark (Rhine Park). From 1957 to 2004 the cable car transported 13.7 million people without an accident; and in 2004, it carried 288,500 passengers. It is considered to be Cologne's safest means of transport. Starting in 2004, the cable car ran at night for special occasions and since that year it has been profitable.

It is unrelated to the popular anime and manga series One Piece.  Plot  The storyline of One Piece Mansion revolves around a successful landlord called Polpo. At the start of the game, Polpo's little sister is kidnapped by the owner of a rival mansion, Chocola. It is the player's job to battle through levels meeting Chocola's objectives and to eventually free Polpo's little sister.  Gameplay  The basic objective of One Piece Mansion is very simple. Every resident in the player's mansion has a stress level, which is indicated by a small bar above their head. If this level gets too high, they will eventually move out of the mansion. Every resident affects the stress levels of the residents around it, in both positive and negative ways. Each resident has a unique stress effect, some having negative to the left, positive to the right etc. The task as the player is to arrange these so that all the residents are happy. However, if a resident does become stressed out, their effect on other residents changes. For example, sweet Ai-Chan radiates stress reducing arrows to all rooms around her. However, if she becomes stressed out herself, her effect on other residents weakens. Polpo, the manager, also has a role to play in the game. By switching to manager mode, he can roam around the mansion and perform two important tasks: * Blow his whistle to send any Syndicate 5 members on that level back to their rooms. * Use his fire extinguisher to put out any fires in the mansion.  Building  When the mansion becomes full, the player must build new rooms. If all the current levels are full, the player must also expand the mansion upwards with elevators. Building new rooms may also require demolishing elevators. Both construction and demolition require money.  Game Modes  One Piece Mansion can be played in several different modes, each of which have their own unique challenges.  Story Mode  This is the mode in which the plot is followed. There are seven stages of increasing difficulty, with each stage requiring different conditions to be met. Every few stages, a powerful rival character appears. The rival character will move into the player's mansion and kick out all the trouble residents, leaving the player to deal with him instead.  Endless Mode  In Endless Mode, the player is left to develop the mansion at his or her own pace. It allows the player to experiment with new resident combinations and to expand the mansion as far as he or she wishes.  Characters  The following list is a selection of characters from One Piece Mansion. Polpo is the mansion manager. Polpo stays busy solving the residents' problems and defeating criminals. His troubles never seem to end. Ai-Chan is the sweetheart of One Piece Mansion. Her smile makes all those around her happy. Mee is an inquisitive alien resident. He annoys other residents with his blinding laser. Osuzu lives in her roomful of cats. Her pets' effects depend on how stressed she is feeling. Ope is a mysterious doctor. He eases residents stress with his comforting medicines. Heebee is a bamboo craftsman with a stick of live bamboo on his head. When he gets excited, the bamboo sprouts and causes trouble to the residents above him. Kiwi is a member of the dangerous Syndicate 5. He burgles the other residents, leaving them broke and unable to pay rent.  Reception  The game received \\"mixed\\" reviews according to video game review aggregator Metacritic.

Witches Tortured till They Bleed) is a 1970 West German horror film. It is most remembered for US marketing slogans devised by Hallmark Releasing Corp. that included \\"Positively the most horrifying film ever made\\" and \\"Rated V for Violence\\", while sick bags were given free to the audience upon admission.Described in detail, with visual supporting evidence, in The Devil's Torturer, the interview with Herbert Fux that appears on the Arrow and Blue Underground Blu-ray and DVD releases of the film. While not prosecuted for obscenity, the film was seized and confiscated in the UK under Section 3 of the Obscene Publications Act 1959 during the video nasty panic. Plot Count Christian von Meruh (Herbert Lom) is a witch hunter and apprentice to Lord Cumberland (Udo Kier) in early 18th-century Austria. He believes strongly in his mentor and his mission but loses faith when he catches Cumberland strangling a man to death for calling him impotent. Meruh begins to see for himself that the witch trials are a scam to rob people of their land, money, and other personal belongings of value and seduce beautiful women. Eventually, the townspeople revolt, and Cumberland escapes but Meruh is captured by the townspeople. The film (which The Aurum Film Encyclopedia: Horror calls 'grotesquely sadistic' Phil Hardy (ed) \\"The Aurum Film Encyclopeida: Horror\\" London: The Aurum Press, 1993 (revised, updated edition), p. 206 contains very strong simulations of graphic torture including a woman's tongue being ripped out of her head by tongue pincers, nuns being raped, nails to probe for the Devil's spot, whipping posts, fingers being cut off, racks and multitudes of vicious beatings. The opening credits and voiceover make the exaggerated claim that over eight million people were condemned as witches and killed during the period in which the film is set.

The original plans were led by producer Adrian Hoven, who intended to produce, direct and star in the film. Hoven's version was a completely different film rumoured to have been called The Witch Hunter - Dr. Dracula. The film was made to cash in on the success of the Michael Reeves's 1968 classic Witchfinder General. Hoven has been a collaborator of Jess Franco. He was an actor turned producer and director. The production was filmed during the summer of 1969 in Austria. From the beginning production was difficult, including that at least half a dozen languages were spoken on set, which caused problems for the cast and crew. Producer Adrian Hoven and director Michael Armstrong disliked each other intensely and often argued over the slightest of things. Hoven made sure a small number of the scripts were kept on set and even cut some of Armstrong's footage, so his own ideas could be inserted in the film. Because cinematographer Ernst W. Kalinke was a friend of Hoven's, they would both film scenes without Armstrong's permission. It has been debated how much of Mark of the Devil was filmed by Armstrong and what by Hoven. To give the film some historical accuracy, it was filmed in an Austrian castle where actual witchfinding interrogations had taken place. This castle also served as a museum with authentic torture tools that were used in the film. Release Mark of the Devil was released theatrically in West Germany on February 19, 1970. The film was released theatrically in the United States by Hallmark Releasing in 1972 and has been available since then on VHS in a multitude of releases from different companies, all varying in terms of the violent content, and released on laserdisc by Elite Entertainment. The film was released on DVD by Anchor Bay Entertainment in 1998 and re-released by Blue Underground in 2004, with this release being deemed the most complete version of the film. Arrow Films released the film on March 17, 2015 uncut for the first time on Blu-ray Disc in the United Kingdom and United States.New Info: Arrow‚Äôs Uncut ‚ÄúMARK OF THE DEVIL‚Äù Blu-ray! The release featured the High Rising Productions documentary film Mark of the Times and a special featurette over the distributor Hallmark Releasing with the documentary Hallmark of the Devil.Mark of the Devil - Arrow Films Reception The film was more successful at the box office than Witchfinder General. This success is often attributed to the advertising campaign. The film has been criticized by many reviewers for being too violent to contain any message and far too exploitative whilst dealing with a serious historical subject. Other reviews praise the film for its soundtrack, special effects, and filming locations, consisting of the mountainous Austrian countryside and stately castles. The University of Vienna's film studies conference Mark of the Devil: On a Classic Exploitation Film was held on 3‚Äì5 April 2014. In 2017 the Cine-Excess eJournal devoted a special issue to the film and its sequel Mark of the Devil Part II which includes a range of extensive articles (about topics such as authorship, marketing and censorship) and an interview with Joyce and Percy Hoven.

Edwards was born on 3 October 1928 in India and received his M.D. from Balliol College, Oxford. His research focused on the study and treatment of alcohol and other drug dependence and related aspects of addictions. He was a major international figure influencing the development of the discipline of alcohol and drug studies, and promoted rigorous scientific and clinical standards in approaching the broader aspects of these problems.\\"Professor Griffith Edwards CBE\\"url=http://www.kcl.ac.uk/iop/news/records/2012/October/Professor-Griffith- Edwards-CBE.aspxdate=12 October 2012 He was director of the Medical Research Council-funded Addiction Research Unit from 1968 until his retirement from King's College London. He also established the UK National Addiction Centre in London and was its first Chair and Director. His 25 years of service as Editor-in-Chief of the journal Addiction transformed it from a small British journal to the most widely-read and cited substance use-related journal in the world. Among the many prizes he received in his career was the E.M. Jellinek Memorial Award in 1979 for his research on alcohol use disorders, and, being made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1987 for his services to social science and medicine. Edwards wrote extensively on policy aspects of alcohol and other drug problems and promoted a balanced public health population-based approached to the tackling of alcohol and other drug problems. He wrote the original description of alcohol dependence and the terminology of dependence has become the global term adopted in international disease classification systems including the DSM and ICD classifications. Edwards published a wide range of original scientific studies on alcohol and other drugs and also wrote several popular science books including Alcohol, The Worlds Favourite Drug, Matters of Substance: Drugs, and Why Everyone is a User. He also sole-authored in 1982 the first edition of the influential book The Treatment of Drinking Problems and contributed as an author, co-author, and ultimately advisor to its subsequent editions over the ensuing decades. After his death, the authors of the sixth edition, Keith Humphreys and Anne Lingford-Hughes, renamed the book in his honour as Edwards' Treatment of Drinking Problems.  Research and community development projects  Professor Edwards combined a career of developing research and knowledge on aspects of alcohol and drug problems with the promotion of community based actions. He supported the development of a broad structured response to alcohol and other drug problems, including appropriate and high quality medical and psychiatric services for such problems. Edwards conducted research and supported the development of new approaches to those who are homeless and also people in prison with alcohol problems. He was instrumental in supporting the establishment of the first Therapeutic Community for treatment of Drug Dependence, Phoenix House. In addition, he supported the development of community drug agencies in the late 1960s and was involved in the early work piloting community-based services for alcohol problems. Along with Lady Ann Parkinson, he supported the founding of a charity originally called Action on Addiction in 1989. (This charity later merged with The Chemical Dependency Centre and Clouds House) to form a new larger charity, now also called Action on Addiction). Action on Addiction works to support treatment and aftercare, as well as the development of research and service innovation in Addictions. Through his interest in developing country issues and links with the World Health Organisation he strongly supported and encouraged projects to assist research and service development in resource poor settings. Professor Edwards' academic work involved research in tobacco, alcohol and other drugs and has supported a training, research, treatment and policy approach that combines all substances that are addictive into a coherent theoretical framework. He has promoted an approach that combines the basic sciences of addiction, to the more applied and social sciences and sought to promote an evidenced based policy approach that is fully scientifically informed. Edwards participated in multiple, international efforts to integrate the lessons of addiction research for policymakers, including the books Alcohol Policy and the Public Good and Drug Policy and the Public Good, both of which supported evidence-informed, humane, and balanced public policy towards addictive legal and illegal substances.

Signs and symptoms The symptoms of Gorham's disease vary depending on the bones involved. It may affect any part of the skeleton, but the most common sites of disease are the shoulder, skull, pelvic girdle, jaw, ribs, and spine.M√ñLLER, G., Priemel, M., Amling, M. Werner, M., Kuhlmey, A. S., Delling, G. \\"The Gorham-Stout syndrome (Gorham's massive osteolysis) A REPORT OF SIX CASES WITH HISTOPATHOLOGICAL FINDINGS.\\" Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery (Br) 81B.3 (1999): 501-6.

J Korean Med Sci. 2002;17:826‚Äì9. In some cases, no symptoms are seen until a fracture occurs either spontaneously or following minor trauma, such as a fall. An acute onset of localized pain and swelling may occur. More commonly, pain of no apparent cause increases in frequency and intensity over time and may eventually be accompanied by weakness and noticeable deformity of the area. The rate of progression is unpredictable, and the prognosis can be difficult. The disease may stabilize after a number of years, go into spontaneous remission, or in cases involving the chest and upper spine, prove fatal. Recurrence of the disease following remission can also occur. Involvement of the spine and skull base may cause a poor outcome from neurological complications. In many cases, the end result of Gorham's disease is severe deformity and functional disability.Chattopadhyay P, Bandyopadhyay A, Das S, Kundu A J. Gorham's disease with spontaneous recovery. Singapore Med J 2009; 50(7). Symptoms such as difficulty breathing and chest pain may be present if the disease is present in the ribs, scapula, or thoracic vertebrae. These may indicate that the disease has spread from the bone into the chest cavity. The breathing problems may be misdiagnosed as asthma, because the damage done to the lungs can cause the same types of changes to lung function testing as seen in asthma. Extension of the lesions into the chest may lead to the development of chylous pleural and pericardial effusions. Chyle is rich in protein and white blood cells that are important in fighting infection. The loss of chyle into the chest can have serious consequences, including infection, malnutrition, and respiratory distress and failure. These complications or their symptoms, such as difficulty breathing, chest pain, poor growth or weight loss, and infection have sometimes been the first indications of the condition. Causes The specific cause of Gorham's disease remains unknown. Bone mass and strength are obtained and maintained through a process of bone destruction and replacement that occurs at the cellular level throughout a person's life. Cells called osteoclasts secrete enzymes that dissolve old bone, allowing another type of cells called osteoblasts to form new bone. Except in growing bone, the rate of breakdown equals the rate of building, thereby maintaining bone mass. In Gorham's disease, that process is disrupted.Gorham, L.W., Wright, A.W., Shultz, H. H., and Maxon, F. C. \\"Disappearing bones: A rare form of massive osteolysis: Report of two cases, one with autopsy findings.\\" American Journal of Medicine 17.5 (1954): 674-682.Heffez L, Doku HC, Carter BL, et al: Perspectives on massive osteolysis. Report of a case and review of the literature. Oral Surg Oral Med Oral Pathol 55:331-343, 1983.Johnson, Philip M. and McClure, James G. Observations on Massive Osteolysis: A Review of the Literature and Report of a Case. Radiology July 1958 71:28-42. Gorham and Stout found that vascular anomalies always occupied space that normally would be filled with new bone and speculated that the presence of angiomatosis may lead to chemical changes in the bone. Gorham and others speculated that such a change in the bone chemistry might cause an imbalance in the rate of osteoclast to osteoblast activity such that more bone is dissolved than is replaced. Beginning in the 1990s, elevated levels of a protein called interleukin-6 (IL-6) being detected in people with the disease were reported, leading some to suggest that increased levels of IL-6 and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) may contribute to the chemical changes Gorham and others believed were the cause of this type of osteolysis.Dupond JL, Bermont L, Runge M, de Billy M. Plasma VEGF determination in disseminated lymphangiomatosis-Gorham-Stout syndrome: a marker of activity? A case report with a 5-year follow-up. Bone. 2010 Mar;46(3):873-6. In 1999, M√∂ller and colleagues concluded, \\"The Gorham-Stout syndrome may be, essentially, a monocentric bone disease with a focally increased bone resorption due to an increased number of paracrine ‚Äì or autocrine ‚Äì stimulated hyperactive osteoclasts. The resorbed bone is replaced by a markedly vascularized fibrous tissue. The apparent contradiction concerning the presence or absence or the number of osteoclasts, may be explained by the different phases of the syndrome.\\" They further stated that their histopathological study provided good evidence that osteolytic changes seen in Gorham's disease are the result of hyperactive osteoclastic bone. However, others have concluded that lymphangiomatosis and Gorham's disease should be considered as a spectrum of disease rather than separate diseases.Aviv RI, McHugh K, Hunt J. Angiomatosis of bone and soft tissue: a spectrum of disease from diffuse lymphangiomatosis to vanishing bone disease in young patients. Clin Radiol. 2001 Mar;56(3):184-90. While a consensus exists that Gorham's is caused by deranged osteoclastic activity, no conclusive evidence has been found as to what causes this behavior to begin. Diagnosis In 1983, Heffez and colleagues published a case report in which they suggested eight criteria for a definitive diagnosis of Gorham's disease: *Positive biopsy with the presence of angiomatous tissue *Absence of cellular atypia *Minimal or no osteoblastic response or dystrophic calcifications *Evidence of local bone progressive osseous resorption *Nonexpansile, nonulcerative lesions *No involvement of viscera *Osteolytic radiographic pattern *Negative hereditary, metabolic, neoplastic, immunologic, or infectious etiology In the early stages of the disease, X-rays reveal changes resembling patchy osteoporosis. As the disease progresses, bone deformity occurs with further loss of bone mass, and in the tubular bones (the long bones of the arms and legs), a concentric shrinkage is often seen which has been described as having a \\"sucked candy\\" appearance. Once the cortex (the outer shell) of the bone has been disrupted, and vascular channels may invade adjacent soft tissues and joints. Eventually, complete or near-complete resorption of the bone occurs and may extend to adjacent bones, though spontaneous arrest of bone loss has been reported on occasion. Throughout this process, as the bone is destroyed, it is replaced by angiomatous and/or fibrous tissue.Torg JS, Steel HH. Sequential roentgenographic changes occurring in massive osteolysis. J Bone Joint Surg Am 1969; 51:1649-55. Often, Gorham's disease is not recognized until a fracture occurs, with subsequent improper bone healing. The diagnosis essentially is one of exclusion and must be based on combined clinical, radiological, and histopathological findings. X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, ultrasounds, and nuclear medicine (bone scans) are all important tools in the diagnostic workup and surgical planning, but none has the ability alone to produce a definitive diagnosis. Surgical biopsy with histological identification of the vascular or lymphatic proliferation within a generous section of the affected bone is an essential component in the diagnostic process. Recognition of the disease requires a high index of suspicion and an extensive workup. Because of its serious morbidity, Gorham's must always be considered in the differential diagnosis of osteolytic lesions. Management Treatment of Gorham's disease is for the most part palliative and limited to symptom management. Sometimes, the bone destruction spontaneously ceases and no treatment is required, but when the disease is progressive, aggressive intervention may be necessary. Duffy and colleagues reported that around 17% of people with Gorham's disease in the ribs, shoulder, or upper spine experience extension of the disease into the chest, leading to chylothorax with its serious consequences, and that the mortality rate in this group can reach as high as 64% without surgical intervention. A search of the medical literature reveals multiple case reports of interventions with varying rates of success as follows: Cardiothoracic (heart and lung): *Pleurodesis *Ligation of thoracic duct *Pleurperitoneal shunt *Radiation therapy *Pleurectomy *Surgical resection *Thalidomide *Interferon alpha-2b *TPN (total parenteral nutrition) *Thoracentesis *Diet rich in medium-chain triglycerides and protein *Chemotherapy *Sclerotherapy *Transplantation Skeletal: *Interferon alpha-2b *Bisphosphonate (e.g. pamidronate) *Surgical resection *Radiation therapy *Sclerotherapy *Percutaneous bone cement *Bone graft *Prosthesis *Surgical stabilization *Amputation To date, no known interventions are consistently effective for Gorham's, and all reported interventions are considered experimental treatments, though many are routine for other conditions. Some people may require a combination of these approaches. Unfortunately, some people will not respond to any intervention. Epidemiology Gorham's disease is extremely rare and may occur at any age, though it is most often recognized in children and young adults. It strikes males and females of all races and exhibits no inheritance pattern. The medical literature contains case reports from every continent. Because it is so rare, and commonly misdiagnosed, exactly how many people are affected by this disease is not known. The literature frequently cites that fewer than 200 cases have been reported, though a consensus is building that many more cases occur around the world than have been reported. History The first known report of the condition came in 1838 in an article titled \\"A Boneless Arm\\" in what was then The Boston Medical and Surgical Journal (now The New England Journal of Medicine).Jackson JBS. A boneless arm. Boston Med Surg J 1838;18:368-9. It is a brief report chronicling the case of Mr. Brown who had, in 1819 at age 18 years, broken his right upper arm in an accident. The person suffered two subsequent accidents, which fractured the arm twice more \\"before the curative process had been completed.\\" At the time of the report in 1838, the person was reported as having remarkable use of the arm, in spite of the humerus bone having apparently disappeared ‚Äì X-rays did not yet exist. Thirty-four years later, a follow-up report was published in the same journal, following Mr. Brown's death from pneumonia at the age of 70 years.Jackson JBS. Absorption of the humerus after fracture. Boston Med Surg J 1872;10:245-7. The person had requested the arm \\"be dissected and preserved for the benefit of medical science\\" and this report contains a detailed pathological description of the arm and shoulder. Abnormalities of the remaining bones of the arm and shoulder are noted and the authors report that the arteries, veins, and nerves appeared normal. No mention was made of lymphatic vessels. Though several reports of similar cases were published in the interim, more than 80 years passed before another significant report of the condition appeared in the medical literature. Both born in 1885, Lemuel Whittington Gorham, MD, and Arthur Purdy Stout, MD, had long, distinguished careers in medicine and shared a lifelong interest in pathology.Azur, HA. \\"Arthur Purdy Stout (1885‚Äì1967), a pioneer of surgical pathology: a survey of his Notes on the Education of an \\"Oncological\\" Surgical Pathologist..\\" Annals of Diagnostic Pathology 2.4 (1998): 271-9. PubMed.gov. Web. 2 Sep 2011.WRIGHT, I.S. \\"Memorial. L. Whittington Gorham, M.D..\\" Transactions of the American Clinical and Climatological Association 80. (1969): n. pag. PubMed Central. Web. 2 Sep 2011. Dr. Gorham practiced and taught medicine and oncology and from the mid-1950s through the early 1960s conducted and reported the classical clinicopathological investigations of pulmonary embolism. During this time, he also authored several case series on osteolysis of bone. Dr. Stout began his career as a surgeon and became a pioneer in tumor pathology, publishing Human Cancer in 1932. This work became the model for the Atlas of Tumor Pathology project, which Stout oversaw as chairman of the National Research Council in the 1950s. In his later years, Dr. Stout embarked on a systematic study of soft tissue tumors in children and was among the first to link cigarette smoking to lung cancer. In 1954, Gorham and three others published a two case series, with a brief review of 16 similar cases from the medical literature, that advanced the hypothesis that angiomatosis was responsible for this unusual form of massive osteolysis. That same year, Gorham and Stout presented to the American Association of Physicians their paper (in abstract form), \\"Massive Osteolysis (Acute Spontaneous Absorption of Bone, Phantom Bone, Disappearing Bone): Its Relation to Hemangiomatosis\\". The paper was published in its entirety in October 1955 in The Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, concluding that: # There now exists the basis for a new syndrome which is supported by a remarkable similarity of clinical and [x-ray] findings in twenty-four cases, and by an equally convincing similarity of the histological picture in eight of these, which we have personally studied. # However it is accomplished, the progressive osteolysis is always associated with an angiomatosis of blood and sometimes of lymphatic vessels, which seemingly are responsible for it. The most typical presentation is that of osteolysis of a single bone or the bones connected by a shared joint, such as the shoulder. Although the disease can attack any bone, the shoulder is one of the most commonly involved areas, along with the skull and pelvic girdle. Spontaneous fractures are common and may be the first sign of the disease. A hallmark of the disease is the lack of bone healing following fracture. References Further reading  * Dellinger, M.

The palatial house is located on Lower Domain Road in the Queens Domain, near the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens, and is the official residence of the governor of Tasmania. There have been three Government Houses, all in Hobart. Earlier residences In 1805, after two years in a tent at Sullivans Cove, Governor Collins moved into the first Government House ‚Äì a new wooden hut in Barrack Square. As local bricks gradually became available the hut was extended, but it was a primitive three-room home that let in the wind and rain. The second Government House was built in 1817 at the junction of Macquarie Street and what is now Elizabeth Street. It had 14 rooms on two storeys and had servants' quarters, a coach house and stables, but it was badly built ‚Äì of brick, wood and stucco, with later extension of sandstone ‚Äì and was demolished in 1858. Architecture Tasmania's Government House is today regarded as one of the best Vice Regal residences in the Commonwealth. Designed by the Director of Public Works and colonial architect William Porden Kay, it is a fine example of an early Victorian country house in Gothic Revival style and is one of the largest of its type in Australia. Work eventually started in 1855 on a hill of the grounds that overlooks the Royal Tasmanian Botanical Gardens and the Derwent estuary. Sandstone was quarried on site (the excavated holes were made into ornamental pools), cedar and teak were recycled from an old ship, and slate for the roof was imported from Wales. Furniture was imported from London. Construction was completed in 1857 The House consists of 73 rooms, some of which are Elizabethan and Jacobean Revival styles. The finest rooms are the Main Hall, The Dining Room, The Ante- Drawing Room, The Drawing Room, The French Room, The Ballroom, and the Conservatory. Apart from the Conservatory, which was rebuilt to original designs in 1991, Government House remains as it was when it was first occupied. The scale, detail and finish of the entrance hall, grand corridor and state rooms together with their furniture are unequalled in Australia. Much of the furniture ordered especially for the house and shipped out from England is still in daily use. Outstanding exterior features of the house include bas-relief architectural sculptures, exceptional stonework, and individually carved sandstone chimney pots. The House also features ornately designed English gardens. Functions On 2 January 1858 Sir Henry Fox Young became the first Governor to take up residence, moving to the capital from Government Cottage, Port Arthur, Tasmania. Apart from being the venue of a busy round of annual receptions, dinners and other events, Government House has since 1990 had an annual open day, an initiative of the then Governor, General Sir Phillip Bennett.

It was made up of four districts: the AAA Concorde District, the AAA Liberty District, the AAA National District, and the AAA Patriot District. Group AAA is the largest enrollment class for VHSL schools, and typically AAA is the most competitive level as well. In 2013, the three classification format was eliminated in favor of a six classification system. Accordingly, the Northern Region was eliminated, while the districts were retained for regular season competition. The Northern Region comprises most of the public schools in Northern Virginia, including all the public high schools in Fairfax County, Arlington County, Alexandria City, and one high school in Loudoun County. The region is also the smallest geographically of all the A, AA, and AAA VHSL regions, where boundaries have remained within the outer limits of Fairfax County for most of its history. History of the Northern Region=Past Northern Region districts In 1965, the then nineteen schools in the Northern Region which competed at the AAA varsity level were first organized into three districts based primarily on geographic location. The Northern Region was originally made up of three districts. They were the AAA Northern District, the AAA Alexandria District, and the AAA Potomac District. The Alexandria District had its name changed to the Gunston District within a few years. The Northern Region had these districts until 1976, when a fourth district, the Great Falls, was added. These districts served the region until the 1993-1994 school year. There are currently 17 teams playing in the Northern Region (6D) as of the 2018-2019 school year. The Concorde District includes Centreville, Chantilly, Madison, Oakton, Westfield. The Cedar Run District includes Battlefield, Osbourn, Osbourn Park, Patriot, Stonewall Jackson. The Liberty District includes Herndon, Langley, McLean, South Lakes, Washington-Lee, Yorktown. Marshall is in the National District but the other members of that district play in region 6C. Major changes in the Northern RegionCurrent district names= The four current district names (Concorde, Cedar Run, Liberty, National) were adopted in the 1993-1994 school based on which division (5 or 6) of football they played in. The Concorde and Patriot Districts held Division 6 schools which are larger AAA schools; the Liberty and National Districts held only Division 5 schools which are smaller AAA schools. 2005 In 2003, Loudoun Valley and Stone Bridge, members of the AA Dulles District, were moved to the AAA Northern Region for the 2005-2007 playing cycle due to enrollment increases in the schools. The Northern Region originally tried to keep both schools away from the region, but the VHSL forced them to accept the two Loudoun County schools anyway. Loudoun schools Broad Run, Park View, and Potomac Falls were Northern Region members before, but they joined before a 2001 VHSL provision was passed which would allow schools to play down a class due to transportation hardships, which both the Loudoun schools and the Northern Region used as a reason to keep its geography within Fairfax County, but this plan failed because the VHSL did not believe either school's location warranted such a request. Thus, Loudoun Valley and Stone Bridge were forced to join the Northern Region, with Valley receiving an exemption to become a playoff only member of the National District and Stone Bridge joining the Liberty in all sports. However, Loudoun Valley's time in the region was short lived, as they were moved to the AAA Cedar Run District of the AAA Northwest Region for the 2007-2009 cycle. 2009 In 2007, Stone Bridge was provisionally placed to move to the Cedar Run District for the 2009-2011 cycle with Loudoun Valley along with Heritage of Leesburg, because the district would lose three members due to a decline in enrollment, as well as to keep the balance of regions as equal as possible. However, all three Loudoun schools appealed the redistricting, with Loudoun Valley and Heritage requesting to move into the Northern Region, and Stone Bridge requesting to remain in it. The VHSL decided to reject Loudoun Valley's and Heritage's appeals, but allowed Stone Bridge to remain in the Northern Region. Former members of the Northern RegionAlexandria City schools= Francis C. Hammond High School and George Washington High School were members of the Northern Region until 1971, when they consolidated into the newer T. C. Williams High School, as was portrayed in the 2000 movie Remember the Titans. The city of Alexandria has had just one senior high school for its students ever since. After the consolidation, Hammond and GW were reconfigured to hold the city's 9th and 10th graders, with the 11th and 12th graders attending T.C. In the 1980s Hammond and GW were reassigned as middle schools. =Fairfax County schools= Fort Hunt High School and Groveton High School were both members of the Northern Region in the 1970s and the 1980s until they consolidated to form West Potomac High School in 1985. West Potomac uses the former Groveton High's facilities. Fort Hunt High School's facilities are now being used as the site of Carl Sandburg Middle School. Thomas Jefferson High School of Alexandria was also a longtime member of the Northern Region until 1985 when it phased in the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology program. Though TJHSST and TJHS used the same building and have the same mascot (Colonials), they are still considered to be separate schools. Students at Thomas Jefferson High School were also eventually moved to nearby Annandale High School in 1987. =Loudoun County schools= From 1996-1999, Broad Run High School of Ashburn and Park View High School of Sterling were admitted to the Northern Region in the Liberty District. Potomac Falls High School of Sterling opened in 1997 and was also a member of the Northern Region as a member of the Concorde District from 1997 until 1999. In 1999, all three schools dropped back to Group AA and returned to the Northwestern District because their enrollment numbers dropped significantly due to Potomac Falls' opening. From 2005-2007, Loudoun Valley High School of Purcellville, entered the Northern Region as a full member for football and as a playoff only member for other sports in the National District. The school's distance caused travel concerns among Loudoun Valley and other district members. Loudoun Valley moved to the AAA Cedar Run District of the Northwest Region after its two-year stint.

The PRLR binds prolactin (PRL) as a transmembrane receptor. Thus the PRLR contains an extracellular region to bind PRL, a transmembrane region, and a cytoplasmatic region. The PRLR can also bind to and be activated by growth hormone (GH) and human placental lactogen (hPL), in addition to prolactin. Expression of the PRLR protein is found within cells of the mammary glands in accordance with its role in lactation, but also is the subject of attention for its diverse and emerging roles by its expression in adipose tissue, pancreatic islet cell proliferation, and immune responses. The PRLR is a cytokine receptor and second messenger cascades include the JAK-STAT pathway, JAK-RUSH pathway, Ras-Raf-MAPK, and PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Disruption of PRLR signaling pathways have been linked to tumorigenesis and breast cancer development.Z. Nouhi, N. Chughtai, S. Hartley, E. Cocolakis, J.J. Lebrun, S.

Early crimes In 1974, a Texas jury convicted Suff and his then-wife, Teryl, of beating their two-month-old daughter to death. The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals later reversed Teryl's conviction but upheld Suff's in Suff v. State (Tex. 1976) 531 S.W.2d 814, finding insufficient evidence to convict her as either the primary actor or a principal in their baby's murder. Though Suff was sentenced to 70 years in a Texas prison, he served only ten years before his 1984 release on parole. He is currently incarcerated at San Quentin after having been convicted of killing twelve women in California and receiving the death penalty in 1995. Murders Suff subsequently raped, tortured, stabbed, strangled, and sometimes mutilated 12 or more women in Riverside County, between June 28, 1989, and December 23, 1991. On January 9, 1992, Suff was arrested after a routine traffic stop after a police officer found a bloody knife and objects believed to be related to the killings. Described as a mild-mannered loner, Suff worked as a warehouse clerk for Riverside County when he was arrested, having been hired while still on parole from Texas. During his time in this job, Suff delivered office furniture to the officers on the task force investigating his killing spree. Trial On July 19, 1995, a Riverside County jury found Suff guilty of killing 12 women and attempting to kill another, though police suspected him responsible for as many as 22 deaths. Suff did not testify in his own defense. During the penalty phase that followed, the prosecutor presented evidence linking Suff to the 1988 murder of a San Bernardino woman, as well as evidence that despite his prior Texas prison term for murdering his first daughter, he abused and violently shook his three-month-old daughter by his second wife. On August 17, 1995, after deliberating for only 10 minutes, the jury returned verdicts of guilty on 12 murder counts and on one count of attempted murder.\\"Jury Asks for Death Penalty for Convicted Killer of 12 Women,\\" New York Times, August 20, 1995. The jury could not unanimously agree to find him guilty on a 13th count of murder. On October 26, 1995, the trial court followed the jury's verdict and ordered Suff condemned to death.\\"Killer of Prostitutes Gets Death Sentence,\\" New York Times, October 29, 1995. Suff resides on death row at San Quentin State Prison. His 2014 appeal of the sentence was rejected by the California Supreme Court which upheld the death penalty. Book and TV The Riverside Killer by Christine Keers and Dennis St Pierre was published in 1996 by Pinnacle True Crime. In 1997 Cat and Mouse - Mind Games with a Serial Killer was published by Dove Books. Suff met with author Brian Alan Lane and told his story. The book includes short stories and poems written by Suff and photos of several of his victims. Suff is the subject of the television program Real Detective, season 2, episode 2.

Life and career Wiseman was born at Moreton's Harbour, Colony of Newfoundland on June 19, 1907. Being the son of Salvation Army officers, he moved frequently from one home to another as his parents postings necessitated. At the age of nineteen Clarence became a cadet at The Salvation Army Training College in Toronto, and was commissioned as an officer on July 4, 1927 with the rank of lieutenant. His first appointment was to Bedford Park Corps (Toronto). Six months later he was transferred to Yorkville Corps, Toronto, both appointments being as assistant to the commanding officer. On January 29, 1932 the then Captain Wiseman was married to Captain Janet Kelly. He was then on the staff of the editorial department at territorial headquarters (THQ) but soon after their marriage Captain and Mrs Wiseman were appointed to London South Corps and continued to work in corps appointments until mid 1940. Captain Wiseman was then seconded to the Canadian Forces and appointed as chaplain to the 2nd Battalion Royal Canadian Engineers. At the time the battalion was involved in training exercises just north of Toronto, but were soon drafted to Great Britain. Clarence and Janet Wiseman were parted for five years. After two years as chaplain, Clarence Wiseman received orders to resign his military commission, and was appointed as senior representative for The Salvation Army Canadian War Services, with headquarters in Cockspur Street, just off Trafalgar Square. When the war ended in June 1945, Clarence Wiseman returned to Canada and after a brief furlough he and Mrs Wiseman were appointed as leaders of the Army's work in Newfoundland where they served for more than eight years. At the beginning of 1954 the Wisemans returned to Toronto where the now Colonel Wiseman was appointed field secretary for the Canada and Bermuda Territory. Three years later he was appointed chief secretary, second in command of The Salvation Army's forces in Canada and Bermuda. Early in 1960 came the first overseas appointment for Clarence and Janet Wiseman. With the rank of lieutenant-commissioner they journeyed to Kenya where Clarence Wiseman served as territorial commander for the East Africa Territory. Two years later the Wisemans set sail for England where Commissioner Wiseman was appointed principal of the William Booth Memorial Training College, a post he held for the next five years. In 1967 Canada celebrated its centenary, and that year Clarence Wiseman was appointed territorial commander for the Canada and Bermuda Territory - the first Canadian to hold the office. In 1974 the eighth High Council nominated Commissioner Wiseman as a candidate for the office of General, the second time he had been nominated. He was duly elected to serve as the tenth general of The Salvation Army, taking command on July 6, 1974. Coming to the office at the age of 67, General Wiseman was only to have three years as the international leader as the retirement age was then 70. However, during his term in office he travelled the world extensively and Army work was opened for the first time in Guatemala. General Wiseman retired from active service on July 4, 1976 to be succeeded by his fellow countryman, General Arnold Brown. His nine years in retirement were filled with evangelical campaigns throughout North America and overseas. In 1976, he was appointed an officer of the Order of Canada \\"for his life-long dedication in the service of the Army and his inspiring leadership at home and abroad.\\" He published his autobiography, A Burning in My Bones (1980) and The Desert Road to Glory (1982). General Wiseman died at his home in Scarborough, Ontario on May 4, 1985 and his wife followed him on May 25, 1993 from Collingwood, Ontario.

Animals live in carefully reconstructed natural habitats according to vegetation, climate, and elevation. Because of lack of space, a new, second site was opened in 1998 just outside Emmen. The two parts of the zoo were connected with each other and one ticket gave admission to both parts. Conservation and breeding The zoo has had great success breeding Asian elephants, with 26 births since 1992 and four births in 2010 and 2011 alone. In 2011 there were 13 elephants at the zoo, others having been transported to other zoos. The elephant accommodations comprise a large moated island for females and calves, and a separate smaller island for the bull, with indoor housing being underground. Wildlands, adventure zoo Emmen The city council of Emmen approved the construction of a completely new zoo, the Wildlands, which is expected to draw 1.3 million visitors annually. The new zoo was completed in March 2016 and is part of a plan for revitalizing the city center of Emmen. Visitors are able to walk from the new City plaza to the new zoo, which initially is about with an additional for expansion, and includes about of interior space, including a theater.  2012 Dutch time trial championships  The 2012 Dutch National Time Trial Championships for professionals and elite women's started in the zoo besides of the African savanna. It was the first time in history a cycle race started in a zoo. Riders rode along the zebras, giraffes, rhinos and hippos.

The title connotes a \\"Gothic\\" tale of haunted isolation, in a milieu stripped of all pretensions. Gaddis's second-shortest novel, Carpenter's Gothic relates the words and occasional actions, in one house, of an ex-soldier, confederate apologist, and pathological liar; his neglected and ineffectual wife; and a visitor with a mysterious past who resembles in many ways Gaddis himself. The book is notable mainly for its strict fugue-like nature, as each character pursues his own themes in conversation and in action, often without reference to anything said or done by the others. Reception and criticism Writing for the Los Angeles Review of Books, Greg Gerke referred to the book as \\"[fitting] perfectly with the other three novels as one long scroll of words.\\" Gerke refers to the other Gaddis books The Recognitions, J R, and A Frolic of His Own. Cynthia Ozick reviewed the novel favorably in The New York Times, highlighting, among other things, Gaddis' ability to create different \\"voices\\" and his use of different dialogue. Ozcik referred to the work as \\"...an unholy landmark of a novel - an extra turret added on to the ample, ingenious, audacious Gothic mansion William Gaddis has slowly been building in American letters.\\" The New York Times attribution In a mention of the book, The New York Times credited the work to another American writer and novelist, William H. Gass. Gass wrote a humorous, though critical, letter to the editor about the mistake, and concluded by asking that the Times attribute John Hawkes' then-upcoming novel Adventures in the Alaskan Skin Trade to him as well.

The route runs for . It generally follows a northwest-southeast path, and is signed north-south. Route description Route 67 is mostly a two-lane surface road, with a divided four-lane section in Southbury. It begins in New Milford as a 0.5 mile concurrency with US 202 as the latter leaves a concurrency with US 7. After crossing the Housatonic River into the center of town, Route 67 breaks away to the southeast. In Bridgewater, it meets the northern end of Route 133. In Roxbury, it meets the southern end of Route 199 and the western end of Route 317. It then clips a corner of Woodbury before passing into New Haven County and the town of Southbury, where it passes the northern end of Route 172 before joining US 6 for a 4 lane divided 1.6 mile concurrency leading to a junction with I-84 at Exit 15. Here, US 6 joins I-84 West and Route 67 continues to the southeast becoming a 2-lane road once again. After intersecting Route 188, it enters Oxford, where it has a junction with the west end of Route 42. In Seymour, it passes the western end of Route 313 before crossing the Naugatuck River. On the east shore of the river, it meets the Route 8 expressway at Exits 21 & 22\\\\. It then passes the northern end of Route 115 before heading into Woodbridge, where Route 67 ends at Route 63. Rapid development on Route 67 between Route 8 and I-84 may require the eventual upgrading of this section to a four-lane arterial highway.Connecticut Routes, Route 67 A section in the town of Roxbury, from the Bridgewater-Roxbury town line to east of Route 317, is a designated state scenic road.Connecticut State Scenic Roads History In the 19th century, part of Route 67 was a toll road known as the Oxford Turnpike that connected the towns of Seymour and Southbury via Oxford. The Oxford Turnpike was chartered in May 1795 and was one of the two earliest private toll roads in Connecticut. In 1922, the road from Woodbridge to Southbury (the old Oxford Turnpike) was designated as State Highway 147 and the road from Southbury to New Milford (via Roxbury and Bridgewater) was designated as State Highway 125. Route 67 was established in the 1932 state highway renumbering from Bridgewater (beginning at modern Route 133, which was then part of an old alignment of Route 25) to New Haven (continuing past Woodbridge along current Route 63). When Route 25 was realigned in April 1943, Route 67 took over the old Route 25 alignment to New Milford. In 1959, Route 67 was relocated to a new road (New Milford Road East) bypassing Bridgewater center, with the former alignment (Clapboard Road) becoming Route 67A. Route 67A was decommissioned, becoming unsigned SR 867, in 1964. Route 67 was truncated to its current eastern/southern end at Route 63 in Woodbridge by 1964.

It was released for Microsoft Windows and the Nintendo GameCube in North America in 2002 and the PAL regions in 2003. The game was also packaged with Outlaw Golf. Its title character is a young woman named Skye who lives in a fantasy realm searching for her mother. She does not use firearms, but can perform magic using Skittles candies, as well as use her staff as a melee weapon, though it also becomes an energy weapon when used in conjunction with the Skittles. Gameplay Gameplay of Darkened Skye. The game begins on a path in the forest of Lynlora near a village and moves to many settings, such as the gloomy Ogmire Archipelago and the drowned city and dungeon of the same name; Tikniki Swamp, which has a maze and a scene of riding shotgun on a giant turtle which you cannot steer; a fleet of balloons called the Sky Pirates' Camp; the Chinese-style land of Zen'Jai with lava rivers, three dragon lairs, of various elemental affinities, and the Warlord's Palace, which is like a maze; Stone Heath, with three combination-lock puzzles located in ancient stone circles; a multi-story dungeon called the Goblins' Lair; the Bone Lands, which surround a lava lake; a vampires' necropolis called the Gargoyle Cemetery, which leads to a Cathedral taken over by the enemy and a giant collapsed staircase in the Bell Tower; and a sky full of floating stones leading to Necroth's Realm and his Lair. There is a short puzzle in a miniature village along a stream, called Twell Country. Skye's overwhelming debility is drowning, so the game involves much jumping over water hazards, especially prevalent in Ogmire. There are also many puzzles of avoiding falling from great heights. It has an arcade sequence of riding a fantasy beast through underground chambers without falling into lava pits or crashing into rock formations. So that it can be played by children, the game maintains a sense of humor about itself and its design. For example, defeated creatures melt away and it contains no morbid plot elements whatsoever. The vampires merely whisper meaningless taunts and never act like merciless monsters. One of the aids that the game provides the player is that past dialogue is accessible. Also, it contains a notebook which keeps track of what the player is searching for at any given point in the plot. Licensing The magic system is based on the use of Skittles candy. Skye performs different magic spells by using various combinations of colored Skittles. She can perform non- combat spells like seeing invisible items, firewalking, floating, temporarily nullifying petrification spells, shrinking, reviving dead creatures, creating a protective field, increasing the firepower of the attacks spells, and turning ordinary people into mages (though she will only get to perform that spell on her mother). Attack spells range from light beams, fireballs, iceballs, lightning, confusion, and a spell that specifically destroys undead creatures (the only means to permanently kill a vampire). Skittles have limited, though slowly regenerating, quantities of Mana. When their mana is depleted, no spells can be performed with them and they have a dulled color. They regenerate mana over time, but mana can be replenished quickly by picking up blue power-ups. Available spells depend on the quantity of Skittles Skye collects throughout the game. Plot=Setting The game takes place in The Five Worlds: Lynlora, Ogmire, Zen'Jai, Stoneheath, and The Gorgoyle Realms. Characters The protagonist of Darkened Skye is Skye, a shepherd who wants to get more enjoyment out of life, and is voiced by Linda Larkin. Her companion is a sarcastic gargoyle named Draak, who decided to rage against the game's villain, the evil wizard Necroth, and is voiced by Rob Pruitt. Story=Development The game is based on the Skittles brand. Publisher Simon & Schuster Interactive wanted to develop games based on M&M;'s given how recognized the candy characters were. While negotiating with Mars, Inc., Simon & Schuster also talked about using Skittles, which would be a back-up plan in case M&M;'s ended up unavailable. Eventually Mars gave the license to both brands, with the Skittles one being inspired by the assumption that a computer game based on Skittles could make the brand more popular as the confectionary's consumption declined with people older than 20. After the M&M;'s video games sold well, producer Elizabeth Braswell was asked to develop the Skittles game. While she first refused the job, Braswell eventually decided to work on it by focusing on gameplay and humor. A 300-page script, by lead writer and designer Andy Wolfendon, was written and submitted to Mars, which only asked to change a joke, utterances of \\"damn\\" and \\"remove all the snakes from the game.\\" When Braswell asked for clarification, they said that there could be snake-like creatures, but no actual snakes. Executive Producer Dale DeSharone stated the game's concepts were inspired by the Skittles television commercials of the \\"Taste the Rainbow\\" campaign. DeSharone led a team of over 50 people in Kiev across two years, working on Darkened Skye simultaneously with M&M;'s The Lost Formulas. By the time Darkened Skye was finished, Simon & Schuster considered removing the Skittles association, but the developers already incorporated the candy into the gameplay and in-game text, so it ended up with only no references to Skittles on the box cover. The PC version was shipped in January 2002, while the GameCube version was released in November the same year. Reception Darkened Skye received \\"mixed\\" reviews on both platforms according to the review aggregation website Metacritic. The gameplay was compared to games like Tomb Raider and The Legend of Zelda series. Game Informer's Matthew Kato stated that he liked the magic system while calling the combat \\"painfully average\\". The reaction to the game's product placement was mixed. Game Revolution's Johnny Lui said its use was clever and more creative than other games use of advertisement. Writing for Computer Gaming World, Erik Wolpaw called the game great in terms of being a Skittles game. CNNMoney, however, called the use of Skittles in the game \\"the most blatant product placement since Chap Stick in those commercials for The Mothman Prophecies.\\" GameTrailers placed Darkened Skye as number two in their \\"Top 10 Shameless Licensed Games\\", behind Chase the Chuck Wagon for the Atari 2600. GamesRadar had the game in their \\"Worst Mash-Ups\\" list, while the appearance of Skittles was part of their list of worst product cameos in gaming.

Sometimes credited as R. D. Cook, Cook was born in Kew, Surrey, and lived in west London as an adult. A writer on music from the late 1970s until he died, Cook was co- author, with Brian Morton, of The Penguin Guide to Jazz Recordings (formerly ...on CD), which lasted for ten editions until 2010. Richard Cook's Jazz Companion and It's About That Time: Miles Davis On and Off the Record were published in 2005. Cook began as a staff writer for NME in the early-1980s. The editor at the time, Neil Spencer, commented that he \\"would take on the pieces that the fashion-oriented shunned - a Roxy Music review, an audience with a fading star, a piece on the emergent sounds of Africa\\". He was later the jazz critic for The Sunday Times, a music writer for the New Statesman. Cook was formerly editor of The Wire, when it was a jazz-centred periodical (it broadened its coverage towards the end of his editorship), and edited Jazz Review magazine from its foundation in 1998. Jazz Review continued for a time after his death, using Cook's approach to the music as continuing inspiration; it did not name a specific successor (Morton) for six months. Cook also presented a programme on jazz for BBC local radio GLR. Cook was the UK jazz catalogue manager for PolyGram (1992‚Äì97) and also produced albums by the trumpeter Guy Barker. During his spell at PolyGram, Cook launched the short- lived 'Redial' re-issue line of classic British jazz albums. In 2002, he was responsible for issuing a 10 CD limited-edition set by the American avant- garde pianist Cecil Taylor of 1990 recordings, 2Ts for a Lovely T, which was on the Codanza label. Cook died from bowel and liver cancer on 25 August 2007, aged 50, in London, a year after diagnosis.

It was based on town charter of Halle (Saale), a town located in German state of Saxony-Anhalt. Sroda Slaska law was popular in the 13th century in Lower Silesia, eastern Greater Poland and northern Lesser Poland. Altogether, some 100 towns were granted Sroda Slaska law, together with hundreds of villages. Introduction of this law was supported by Silesian Duke Henry I the Bearded, who frequently sent his envoys to Halle for consultation. Compared with Magdeburg rights, Sroda law as less advanced and more conservative, providing limited autonomy to towns.

It was his fourth novel, and it won his second U.S. National Book Award for Fiction. \\"National Book Awards ‚Äì 1994\\". National Book Foundation. Retrieved 2012-03-28. (With essay by Harold Augenbraum from the Awards 60-year anniversary blog.) Title The title is from a judicial decision about vicarious liability in Joel v. Morison. Plot Oscar Crease is hospitalized after a car injury. He had short-circuited the ignition of his car while standing in front of it, and the driverless car then drove over him. His stepsister Christina and her lawyer husband Harry Lutz visit him and bring him the legal opinion prepared by his father, a circuit judge, concerning the case of Szyrk v. the Village of Tatamount et al. This case concerns a situation where a dog got entrapped by a steel sculpture created by Mr. Szyrk. To free the dog a destructive procedure has to be performed on the sculpture, but the sculptor tries to prevent this and is granted a preliminary injunction by the judge. Back at home in the Hamptons, Oscar is recovering. He is trying to build a legal case against the movie producer Constantine Kiester and his associates who he asserts have infringed upon his copyright of his unpublished play. Both the play and the movie describe an event during the Civil War, where Oscar's grandfather, later to be a judge on the Holmes court, hired two substitutes to fight for him, one for the South, the other for the North. At the battle of Antietam they meet, fight and kill each other. Oscar engages a lawyer, Harold Basie, and reads pieces of his script to show him similarities, although he had not seen the movie. Basie takes the case, while the defendants happen to use Harry Lutz's legal firm to represent them. A deposition is taken and Oscar is examined. A settlement is offered, but he rejects it and proceeds with his suit. After losing the trial, he goes into the appeal process. Oscar is cared for by his stepsister Christina and his girlfriend Lily and is visited by Trish and \\"Jerry,\\" i.e., Jawaharlal Madhar Pai, the lawyer who had conducted the deposition. Jerry and Oscar discuss his play at length. In the appeal process, Oscar wins his case against the movie makers, and believes he will get millions. His father, a judge, had helped by writing a legal brief. He dies before Oscar can thank him, and his clerk visits Oscar. When Christina's husband dies in a car accident she expects to be the beneficiary of his life insurance, but his legal firm had made itself the beneficiary of his insurance. Oscar learns that \\"creative accounting\\" of the very successful movie results in a loss, so he will not see any money. The inheritance of Oscar's and Christina's father is burdened with expenses so that, in the end, they can just keep the house. Oscar becomes more and more childish. Comments The novel is largely based on dialogue, interspersed occasionally by narratives, some of them in a stream-of-consciousness. The dialogue is generally not attributed, and characters are defined by what they say and how they say it. The reader will also find legal opinions, a deposition, and excerpts of Oscar's play, \\"Once at Antietam,\\" as being read by participants. Everybody is involved in lawsuits that grow and sprout seemingly without limits, giving none of the participants any satisfaction. Most of the human activity takes place at Oscar Crease's home out in the wetlands of Long Island, and in some expositions, the reader gets a glimpse of the beautiful landscape that surrounds it.

Chanfrau (1824 ‚Äì October 2, 1884) was an American actor and theatre manager in the 19th century. He began his career playing bit parts and doing impressions of star actors such as Edwin Forrest and of ethnic groups. In 1848, he appeared as a Bowery b'hoy named Mose in A Glance at New York. The play became a record-breaking hit, due largely to the Mose character, and Chanfrau spent most of the rest of his career playing that role. In later life, Chanfrau appeared regularly in Kit, the Arkansas Traveller and Sam. His wife, Henrietta, was a well-known actress who usually performed under the name Mrs. F.S. Chanfrau. Early life and career Chanfrau was born to French parents in New York City; he grew up near Essex Market. As a boy, Chanfrau saw a performance by Edwin Forrest and decided to become an actor himself.Banham 188. Various legends arose during his career to explain his later choice of roles. One, related by T. Allston Brown, claims that in his youth Chanfrau frequented a small restaurant called the Broadway House on the corner of Grand Street, where he would order a daily plate of corned beef for six pence. One day, a printer at the New York Sun named Mose Humphrey sat down by him and yelled out his order: \\"Look a heah! gim me a sixpenny plate ev pork and beans, and don't stop to count dem beans, d'yr heah!\\" Chanfrau would later adopt this persona of the Irish Bowery b'hoy and popularize it on stage.Brown, p. 284. Another version, related by A.E. Costello, says that Chanfrau witnessed Mose Humphreys in a street brawl: Whatever the ultimate source of his fireboy impression, Chanfrau was a gifted impersonator from a young age. He took the stage as a young man doing an impersonation of Forrest and a string of minor roles while touring from theatre to theatre with various companies. Brown says that he \\"played every dialect known to the stage, except the Welsh.\\"Brown 285. Chanfrau became a member of the house company at Mitchell's Olympic Theatre in 1848. There, a friend and playwright, Benjamin A. Baker, wrote A Glance at New York. The play is a collection of jokes, short skits, songs, and other scenes centered on a country bumpkin from Connecticut who is guided through New York by Chanfrau's fireboy character. The two proposed it to Mitchell, the theatre manager, but he rejected it. Chanfrau as Mose Chanfrau as Mose, 1848 In 1848, Baker had a benefit at Mitchell's Olympic and asked Chanfrau to do his part from A Glance at New York in the afterpiece. Brown relates that \\"Mitchell used to tell how he went on the stage that night just before the curtain was rung up, and seeing Chanfrau at the back, dressed for his part, was on the point of ordering him off, supposing he was one of the 'Centre Market loafers.'\\" When Chanfrau took the stage, the audience greeted him with silence. The play was an immense hit, and Baker, Chanfrau, and Mitchell changed the name to New York as It Is and rewrote it to focus on Mose. It played to a full house for the next two weeks.Wilmeth and Bigsby 460. Chanfrau's huge popularity as Mose prompted William Northall to lament that at the Olympic W. Olgivie Ewen leased the larger Chatham Theatre for Chanfrau to manage beginning 28 February 1848. Chanfrau changed the name to Chanfrau's National Theatre and allowed working-class patrons to sit in all sections of the playhouse, not just the pit as was customary. Chanfrau acted in a number of melodramas and burlesques with a concentration on Mose plays. Meanwhile, New York as It Is broke all records for New York theatre, playing for 47 nights straight and becoming the most popular play in the United States to that point. The New York Herald reported that a performance on 26 April 1848 was so packed that the crowd rushed the stage, howling and laughing. The police and theatre staff had to remove the excess theatregoers, some of whom had to literally walk over members of the pit to get back to their seats.Quoted in Bank 86. Chanfrau retained Chatham's lease until 8 July 1850.Brown 302-3. Chanfrau began touring widely, starred as Mose at a number of working-class theatres. The Mose series expanded to include Mose in China, Mose in California, The Mystery and Miseries of New York, and many others. David Renear estimates that Chanfrau appeared as Mose at least 385 times in seven plays between 15 April 1848 and 6 July 1860.Quoted in Wilmeth and Bigsby 460. Meanwhile, other actors tried to cash in on the Mose fad, and Bowery b'hoy dramas appeared on stages across the United States. In 1850 the illustrator, Thomas Butler Gunn, drew and designed a graphic novel call Mose Among the Britishers or The B‚Äôhoy in London featuring the popular character. Gunn dedicated the work to Chanfrau. Later career Frank Chanfrau In the spring of 1857, Chanfrau became the manager of the Bowery Theatre (at that time known as Brougham's Bowery Theatre). By this time, the popularity of the Mose character was waning, so Chanfrau turned to other parts. He did satires of Edwin Forrest, Shakespeare, and a version of Dan Rice's circus. In late June, he moved to the theatre at 585 Broadway (previously home to Buckley's Serenaders) and renamed it the New Olympic Theatre. He played there until August, mostly concentrating on nostalgic pieces from the 1840s and early 1850s. Chanfrau eventually had a minor hit as the title character of Kit, the Arkansas Traveller, which he played 360 times. Later he appeared in the play Sam (written by Thomas de Walden) 783 times. For the remainder of his career, he played these parts, Mose, and other roles from his early life as an actor. Brown left this description: Death Frank Chanfrau died at Taylor's Hotel in Jersey City, New Jersey, on October 2, 1884. NotesReferences * Allen, Robert C. (1991).

Frontispiece to The Land Beyond the Forest (1888) by Emily Gerard, illustrated by Elizabeth Thor Life= Early life  Emily Gerard was born on 7 May 1849 at Chesters, Jedburgh, Scotland, the oldest daughter of Colonel Archibald Gerard (1812‚Äì80) of Rochsoles, Lanarkshire and Euphemia Erskine (1818‚Äì70), daughter of the inventor Sir John Robison (1778‚Äì1843). She had three sisters and three brothers including General Sir Montagu Gilbert Gerard (1842‚Äì1905). She was descended from Alexander Gerard (1728‚Äì95) a philosophical writer, Archibald Alison (1757‚Äì1839) a Scottish Episcopalian minister and writer, and Gilbert Gerard (1760‚Äì1815) a minister of the Church of Scotland and theological writer. Her sister Dorothea, born on 9 August 1855 at New Monkland, Lanark, was also a novelist. In the 1861 Scotland Census, Gerard is recorded as living at Rochsoles House in Lanarkshire with her parents, her sisters Anne, Dorothea, and Mary, and a staff of 11 servants; they also have several visitors happening to stay at the house at the time of the census-taker's visit.Parish: New Monkland; ED: 8; Page: 4; Line: 9; Roll: CSSCT1861_117.

General Register Office for Scotland, Edinburgh, Scotland. The Gerard family lived in Vienna from 1863 to 1866. She was home-schooled until she was 15, when she continued her education studying European languages at the convent of the Sacr√© Coeur at Riedenburg in Austria for three years. The family background was originally Scottish Episcopalian, and when their mother converted to Catholicism in 1848, the sisters were raised Catholic.  Career  The two sisters Dorothea and Emily became active participants in the British literary community in the latter half of the 19th century, both working collaboratively and independently. Emily Gerard wrote stories for Blackwood‚Äôs Magazine, as well as reviewing French and German literature for The Times, and Blackwood's.  Collaboration with Dorothea  In 1879, Gerard began to write novels, with her first major work being a collaboration with her sister Dorothea under the joint pseudonym E. D. Gerard. Reata; or What's in a Name (1880) concerned a Mexican girl's attempts to adapt to European customs and was published in Blackwood‚Äôs Magazine. Subsequent novels published by the pair in the same magazine were Beggar My Neighbour (1882), The Waters of Hercules (1885), and A Sensitive Plant (1891). When Dorothea got married and moved, their collaboration ceased. As Dorothea (Gerard) Longard de Longgarde (1855‚Äì1915), arguably the more successful and certainly the more prolific novelist of the two, had married an Austro-Hungarian officer, she spent much of her subsequent life in Austria. = Impact of marriage = In Salzburg on 14 October 1869, Gerard married Ritter Miecislaus von Laszowski (), a Polish cavalry officer serving in the Austro-Hungarian Army, who was 20 years her senior.Salzburger Chronik, Nov. 8th, 1869, p. 4. She had two sons. She was joined by her sisters in 1870, following the death of their mother. As a result of their marriages, the sisters' subsequent novels were often set in Eastern Europe. The Gerard brothers also made contributions to the siblings' literary output, collectively adding up to nearly 60 books and novels. Both brothers were considered sufficiently noteworthy to be listed alongside Emily Gerard in Black's Who Was Who, 1897‚Äì1916 (1953). Subsequent to her marriage, she was variously referred to as Emily Gerard, Mrs de Laszowska, Emily Laszowska, or Emily de Laszowska Gerard.  Independent writing  Gerard's novels frequently centred around European characters and settings. She used her time spent in Hermannstadt and Kronstadt to write about the culture and landscape of Transylvania. Her familiarity with Transylvanian folklore came about as a result of her husband being stationed in the towns of Hermannstadt and Kronstadt from 1883 to 1885.Gmerek 2005 Her book The Land Beyond the Forest (1890) and essay \\"Transylvania Superstitions\\" is credited with inspiring Bram Stoker to write Dracula.https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk- scotland-46032480 The latter publication also introduced Stoker to the term \\"Nosferatu\\" to describe the undead. Gerard writes: > More decidedly evil is the nosferatu, or vampire, in which every Roumanian > peasant believes as firmly as he does in heaven or hell. There are two sorts > of vampires, living and dead.

The > Land Beyond the Forest: Facts, Figures, and Fancies from Transylvania. > Harper & Brothers, 1888. pg. 185-86. Elements from this passage, including the local peasants' suspicions of the vampire, obviously appear in the first part of Dracula. = Friendship with Mark Twain = In 1897 Gerard wrote to William Blackwood, of Blackwood's Magazine, asking to be introduced to the American author Mark Twain.McKeithan, D. M. ‚ÄúMADAME LASZOWSKA MEETS MARK TWAIN.‚Äù Texas Studies in Literature and Language, vol. 1, no. 1, 1959, pp. 62‚Äì65. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/40753531. When Blackwood obliged, Gerard met and befriended Mark Twain, to whom The Extermination of Love (1901) is dedicated. In a letter to Blackwood, Gerard wrote of Mark Twain that he was \\"an excessively serious, almost solemn person...but when one can get him in the right vein he is quite fascinating.\\"Eccles 1899  Death  On 11 January 1905 Gerard died in Vienna, Austria where she and her husband had moved following his retirement from active service. She was buried two days later. Her sister Dorothea moved to Austria following the death of her husband and lived the rest of her life as a recluse, dying on 29 September 1915.  Literary criticism  During her lifetime, Gerard was regarded as something of a travel writer with a vast and privileged experience of European countries and expert linguistic abilities. In an 1888 review of her work in Salt Lake City's Women's Exponent, Gerard was described as \\"a clever writer and the author of several entertaining novels [who] must be rather cosmopolitan in her tastes.\\"\\"Mme. E. Gerard, a Clever Writer and the Author of Several Entertaining Novels, Must Be Rather Cosmopolitan in Her Tastes.\\" Woman's Exponent, vol. 17, no. 8, 1888, p. 59.

Levetus' 1905 piece for Womanhood entitled \\"What Women are Doing in Austria,\\" she writes, \\"[Emily Gerard] possesses a fertile imagination and a lively and convincing way of conveying her thoughts to others, a rich gift of language, enhanced by her acquaintances with foreign tongues, all of which she speaks and writes with the same fluency as her native tongue.\\"Levetus, A.

However, it was felt that other members of Gerard's family appealed more to the public as writers of novels. In 1905 obituaries for Gerard published in both The Times and The Atheneum, her sister's Dorothea's wider appeal was remarked upon. The Times observed that Emily \\"had not won equal popularity with that of her sister,\\" while The Atheneum decided she was in her own right, \\" a capable novelist, with an excellent gift for telling a story.\\" Works * Reata; or What's in a Name, Edinburgh and London: William Blackwood and Sons, 1880.Reata; or What's in a Name Vol.1 (1880) William Blackwood and Sons, Edinburgh and LondonReata; or What's in a Name Vol.2 (1880) William Blackwood and Sons, Edinburgh and LondonReata; or What's in a Name Vol.3 (1880) William Blackwood and Sons, Edinburgh and London * Beggar My Neighbour, Edinburgh and London: William Blackwood and Sons, 1882.Beggar My Neighbor Vol.1 (1882) BlackwoodMy Neighbor Vol.2 (1882) BlackwoodBeggar My Neighbor Vol.3 (1882) Blackwood * The Waters of Hercules, Edinburgh and London: William Blackwood and Sons, 1885.The Waters of Hercules (1885) Blackwood (these first three novels are all under the name \\"E.D.

Other recipes suggest using both bell pepper and banana pepper as alternatives. Varieties There is a large variety of lecs√≥s, the base of all being a mixture of tomatoes and peppers (both sweet and hot), onions, spiced with salt, sometimes red paprika powder and often garlic. Some recipes may also use bay leaf, ground black pepper or thyme, but those are not original ones. To make the perfect lecs√≥ base, one must render the lard from the smoked bacon (if that is used instead of oil, which is also common), and fry the onion slices until the edges become slightly brownish. Next the pepper slices must be added and fried until crisp. The tomatoes come last because, if added at the beginning, they would soak the onions and the peppers. Lecs√≥ may be made with cooked rice or scrambled eggs. To serve a warm dish - for example fried fish - with sour cream or in a pancake, as a filling is also common. Most of the recipes are with sausage (called \\"kolb√°sz\\" such as lecs√≥kolb√°sz, made specifically for this purpose, or Debrecener sausage) bacon or frankfurter.

Playing career White was born in Watford, Hertfordshire, and first played for Brentford as an amateur, before World War I intervened. White served as a private in the Royal Fusiliers and as a lance corporal in the Royal Army Ordnance Corps while continuing to be on Brentford's books. He was discharged in February 1919 and returned to competitive football when he joined newly promoted Arsenal prior to the beginning of the 1919‚Äì20 season, making his debut in Arsenal's very first match after their promotion back to the First Division, against Newcastle United on 30 August 1919. White soon made a name for himself as a reasonably prolific striker, and he was Arsenal's top scorer in 1919‚Äì20 with fifteen league goals, as the Gunners finished 10th in their first season back at the top; he impressed enough to play in a trial for England, although ultimately he never won a cap. After a quiet season in 1920‚Äì21 (scoring just 10 times), White scored 19 goals the following season, making him again Arsenal's top scorer, even though the club's poor defence meant they only finished 17th. However, in 1922‚Äì23 he (and Arsenal) suffered a slump in form and after being replaced by converted full back Bob Turnbull in November 1922, he was sold to Blackpool in March 1923. In all he played 109 games for Arsenal, scoring 45 goals. After leaving Arsenal, White embarked on a journeyman's career; as well as playing for Blackpool he went on to have spells at Fulham, Walsall (twice), Nelson, Stafford Rangers and Thames before retiring in 1930. He was also a cricketer of some note, playing eight first-class matches for Warwickshire in 1923, though without success.

The company, which is a joint venture between Lockheed Martin Space and Boeing Defense, Space & Security, was formed in December 2006. Launch customers of the United States government include the Department of Defense (DoD), NASA, and other organizations. ULA provides launch services using expendable launch systems Delta IV Heavy and Atlas V, and until 2018 the medium-lift Delta II. The Atlas, Delta IV Heavy and the recently retired Delta IV launch systems have launched payloads including weather, telecommunications, and national security satellites, scientific probes and orbiters. ULA also launches commercial satellites. , the company is developing the Vulcan Centaur, a successor to the Atlas V that includes some Delta IV technology. As of 2019, Vulcan launches were planned to begin in 2021. The Advanced Cryogenic Evolved Stage (ACES) is planned to replace Centaur V on Vulcan from 2023.  Company history = Formation and FTC approval  Boeing and Lockheed Martin announced their intent to form a 50-50 joint venture on May 2, 2005, aiming to consolidate the manufacture and development of U.S. government expendable launch vehicles and launch services. The name United Launch Alliance (ULA) was announced at the same time. Annual savings were estimated to be between US$100 million and US$150 million. SpaceX challenged the United States antitrust law legality of the launch services monopoly on October 23, 2005, creating competition with reusable launch systems. The Federal Trade Commission gave ULA anti-trust clearance on October 3, 2006. The commission required ULA to \\"cooperate on equivalent terms with all providers of government space vehicles ... provide equal consideration and support to all launch service providers when seeking any U.S. government delivery in orbit contract ... and to safeguard competitively sensitive information obtained from other providers of space vehicles and launch services\\". It was the FTC's opinion that due to the challenge of entering the government medium-to-heavy launch services market, the entry of SpaceX was unlikely to reverse the anti-competitive effects resulting from the formation of ULA. It approved the joint venture on the basis that the benefits of assured access to space for national security outweighed anti-competitive harm.  Michael Gass era (2005-2014)  The ULA merged the production and operation of the two companies' government space launch services into one central plant in Decatur, Alabama, and merged all engineering into another central facility in Littleton, Colorado. The parent companies retained responsibility for marketing and sales of the Delta and Atlas launch vehicles. ULA had a peak of seven space launch facilities between 2005 and 2011, including three Delta II launchpads, which were decommissioned starting in 2011. Two years after its formation, in late 2008, ULA announced it would lay off 350 of its 4200 workers in early 2009. In the event, ULA had approximately 3900 employees by August 2009. ULA joined the Commercial Spaceflight Federation (CSF) in June 2010 as an executive member. ULA's CEO Michael Gass described the company's membership as a \\"natural fit for us, and we are proud to do so\\". By May 2014, ULA's membership of the CSF had lapsed. With the introduction of competition from lower-cost launch providers and the annually increasing costs of ULA launches, increased attention has been paid to the amounts ULA has received for U.S. government launch contracts and for its annual government funding of US$1 billion for launch capability and readiness. This readiness requirement included the maintenance of five launch pads and a number of variants of the Delta II, Delta IV, Delta IV Heavy, and Atlas V rockets. As a result of increasing costs by ULA, in April 2012, the EELV program triggered a critical Nunn-McCurdy cost breach and a reassessment of the program, of which ULA was the sole participant. An uncontested USAF block- purchase of 36 rocket cores for up to 28 launches, which was valued at US$11 billion, was awarded in December 2013 and drew protest from SpaceX, which said the cost of ULA's launches were approximately US$460 million each and proposed a price of US$90 million to provide similar launches. In response, ULA's CEO Michael Gass said its average launch price was US$225 million, with future launches as low as US$100 million.  Tory Bruno era (2014 onward)  NASA Administrator, Jim Bridenstine Michael Gass stepped down as ULA's CEO in August 2014 and was replaced by Tory Bruno, former vice president and general manager of Lockheed Martin Strategic and Missile Defense Systems. ULA entered into a partnership with Blue Origin in September 2014 to develop the BE-4 LOX/methane engine to replace the RD-180 on a new, lower cost first-stage booster rocket. At the time, the engine was in its third year of development by Blue Origin. ULA said it expected the new stage and engine to start flying no earlier than 2019 on a successor to the Atlas V. A month later, ULA announced a major restructuring of processes and workforce to halve launch costs, partly due to competition from SpaceX. The United States Government Accountability Office (GAO) calculated the average cost of each ULA rocket launch for the U.S. government had risen to approximately US$420 million in 2014. ULA had less success securing deals for Earth observation, commercial communication and privately owned satellites than it had with launching U.S. military payloads. In November 2014, Tory Bruno stated the structuring was intended to \\"lead to improvements in how ULA interacts with its customers, both governmental and commercial\\", shorten launch cycles, and halve launch costs again. Part of that program involved the development of a new rocket, the Vulcan, initially with private funds, to tackle \\"skyrocketing launch costs\\". Bruno believed the new, lower-cost launcher could be competitive in the commercial satellite sector. ULA intended to have preliminary design ideas in place for a blending of the Atlas V and Delta IV technology by the end of 2014 but the high-level design was not announced until April 2015. In February 2016, it was announced the development of the Vulcan rocket would be funded via a public‚Äìprivate partnership with the U.S. government. By early 2016, the USAF had committed US$201 million of funding for Vulcan development. ULA had not \\"put a firm price on the cost of Vulcan development\\" but according to Mike Gross of SpaceNews, Bruno \\"said new rockets typically cost US$2 billion, including US$1 billion for the main engine\\". In 2016, ULA had asked the U.S. government to provide a minimum of US$1.2 billion by 2020 to assist the development of the new U.S. launch vehicle. It was unclear how the change in development funding mechanisms would change ULA plans for pricing market- driven launch services. Since Vulcan development began in October 2014, the privately generated funding for Vulcan development has been approved only on a short-term basis. The ULA board of directors, which was composed of executives from Boeing and Lockheed Martin, would approve development funding on a quarterly basis. ULA planned to reduce its number of launchpads from five in 2015 to two. ULA released contract values to the public and new CEO Tory Bruno testified before Congress in March 2015 that while ULA receives government subsidies \\"to conduct national security launches\\", the same is true of SpaceX, which received funding \\"to develop new capabilities and the use of low-cost or no-cost leases of previously developed launch infrastructure\\". It is difficult to directly compare launch costs because they are not necessarily calculated using the same cost-model assumptions. ULA announced in February 2015 it was considering undertaking domestic production of the Russian RD-180 rocket engine at the Decatur, Alabama, rocket stage manufacturing facility. The U.S.-manufactured engines would be used for government civil (NASA) or commercial launches, and would not be used for U.S. military launches. This idea was abandoned following the passage of legislation permitting the continued purchase of the RD-180 from Russia. In May 2015, ULA stated it would go out of business unless it won commercial and civil satellite launch orders to offset an expected slump in U.S. military and spy launches. The same month, ULA announced it would lay off 12 of its executives, a reduction of 30%, in December 2015. The management layoffs were the \\"beginning of a major reorganization and redesign\\" as ULA endeavors to \\"slash costs and hunt out new customers to ensure continued growth despite the rise of SpaceX\\". Senator John McCain asked the DoD to investigate the comments that implied it may have shown \\"favoritism to a major defense contractor or that efforts have been made to silence members of Congress\\" and the Secretary of Defense requested the DoD's Inspector General to open an investigation of the controversy. A political controversy arose in March 2016 following public remarks by ULA VP of Engineering, Brett Tobey, whose comments were, according to Peter de Selding of SpaceNews, \\"resentful of SpaceX\\" and dismissive of one of the two competitors (Aerojet Rocketdyne) for the new engine that will power the Vulcan launch vehicle, which was under development. Tobey resigned on March 16 and Bruno disavowed the remarks. In December 2016, ULA created an online pricing tool called \\"Rocket Builder\\", which allowed potential customers and the public to estimate launch costs of the Atlas V rocket with configurable orbits, payloads and launch services. Purchase-price estimates were removed from the tool in 2018 because it potentially provided commercially sensitive information to ULA's competitors. Despite ULA's cost-cutting and restructuring, the cheapest ULA space launch in early 2018 remained the Atlas V 401 at a price of approximately US$109 million. Following the failure of a SpaceX Falcon 9 carrying Amos-6, incorrect reports about potential corporate espionage by ULA circulated. These reports were proved to be false January 2, 2017, when SpaceX released an official statement saying the cause of the failure was a buckled liner in several of the COPV tanks. In June 2017, Ars Technica analyzed a USAF budget and concluded if ULA was selected for all USAF launches in the year 2020‚Äì2021, the cost-per-launch would be around US$420 million. Bruno described the analysis as \\"misleading\\"; in July 2017 the company was awarded US$191 million single-launch contract to launch the STP-3 mission aboard the heavy-lift Atlas V 551. In July 2017, ULA was awarded US$191 million to launch STP-3 aboard a heavy-lift Atlas V 551. The following January, ULA took over marketing and sales responsibilities for Atlas V launches. Dan Collins, ULA's inaugural Chief operating officer, retired in April 2018 and was replaced by John Elbon, former vice president and program manager at Boeing Defense, Space & Security. During the 2019‚Äì2020 COVID-19 pandemic, some aspects of ULA's launch related outreach were scaled back but the company said it would maintain its launch schedule. left On August 7, 2020, the U.S. Space Force awarded contracts for the second phase of its long- term launch services program for national security launches through 2020. United Launch Alliance, along with Space X, was chosen over Blue Origin and Northrup Grumman. The decision was driven primarily by past launch performance. As ULA has had 100% success record in about two decades of operation, it was awarded 60% of the contract.  Launch vehicles and engines  As of 2020, ULA operates the Atlas V and Delta IV rockets, which were developed under the National Security Space Launch (NSSL) program by Lockheed Martin and Boeing respectively, both launching in 2002. The Delta IV Medium was retired on August 22, 2019, but Delta IV Heavy rockets will continue to be used to launch heavy payloads. As of 2020, ULA is developing Vulcan, a heavy- lift launch vehicle that will replace its existing fleet. Astrobotic Technology's Peregrine lander will be launched on the first Vulcan certification flight, which is expected to occur in 2021 from SLC-41 at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station.Awesome Atlas delivers next-gen high-speed Echostar 19 internet sat to orbit for America. Ken Kremer, PhysOrg 19 December 2016  Current fleet  Atlas V = Atlas V is the fifth major version in the Atlas rocket family. It is an expendable launch system that was originally designed by Lockheed Martin. Each Atlas V rocket consists of two main stages. The first stage is powered by a Russian RD-180 engine, which is manufactured by RD Amross, and burns kerosene and liquid oxygen. Each RD-180 engine costs about $10 million which is considerably cheaper than any competing rocket with the ability to launch a satellite to geostationary orbit. It has a flawless record of launching American satellites over many years of service. The Atlas V has been modified for human spaceflight. Human- rating required new computers to monitor performance and trigger an abort when necessary, data links between the rocket and spacecraft, and other changes. Manned flights will include a mechanism to allow astronauts to manually abort. The Atlas V has already carried the Boeing CST-100 Starliner on its first unmanned spaceflight. The Atlas V that carried the Starliner was equipped with two SRBs from Aerojet Rocketdyne. This was the only Atlas V ever to fly without a payload fairing. With the Starliner on top, the rocket is 172 feet tall. In 2017, Sierra Nevada selected the Atlas V to launch the first two missions of the Dream Chaser cargo capsule to the International Space Station. These launches are part of NASA's Cargo Resupply Services 2 contract. At the time of signing its agreement with ULA, Sierra Nevada expected the missions to take place in 2020 and 2021. An Atlas V rocket was selected for the NROL-101 mission for the National Reconnaissance Office. The launch will happen in late 2020. The variant of the Atlas V selected for this mission will make use of three new GEM-63 solid rocket booster made my Northrup Grumman. A larger version of this booster, the GEM-63XL, is being developed for the Vulcan Centaur. =Centaur= Centaur rocket model The Centaur is a family of rocket-propelled upper stages currently with one main active version and one version under development. The 3.05-meter diameter Common Centaur/Centaur III flies as the upper stage of the Atlas V launch vehicle, while the 5.4-meter diameter Centaur V is being developed as the upper stage of ULA's new Vulcan rocket. A lengthened version of the Centaur V will be used on the Vulcan Centaur Heavy. ULA plans to eventually upgrade the Centaur V with Integrated Vehicle Fluids technology to become the Advanced Cryogenic Evolved Stage (ACES). The Centaur upper stage is powered by one or two RL10 engines, which are manufactured by Aerojet Rocketdyne, and burn liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. The Centaur is the first rocket stage to use these fuels. On the Atlas V ULA typically only uses the once RL10 version of the Centaur upper stage. However, Aerojet Rocketdyne supplies two RL10A-4-2 engines for each Starliner mission flown by the Atlas V. The dual-engine Centaur configuration is used on human-rated launches for safety reasons. This configuration allows the rocket to fly on a shallower path to orbit, meaning horizontal velocity is emphasized over vertical velocity. This in turn reduces the maximum G-forces endured by the crew and allows for a safe abort at any time during the launch. The standard payload fairings are in diameter with varying lengths. The dual- engine variant of the Centaur has flown more than 100 times on Atlast variant rockets. 166 of the Centaur's flights have used dual-engine variants. As of late 2019, Centaurs of all kinds had flowm 251 times. The Centaur upper stage for the Atlas V also has an Aft Bulkhead Carrier capacity. The capacity was developed initially for the National Reconnaissance Office to take advantage of the extra capacity Atlas V has. = Delta IV = Delta IV launch 2013-08-28 Delta IV is a group of five expendable launch systems in the Delta rocket family, which was introduced in the early 2000s. The Delta IV was originally designed by Boeing's Defense, Space & Security division for the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle (EELV) program, and became a ULA product in 2006. The Delta IV is mostly used for launching United States Air Force military payloads but has also been used to launch a number of U.S. government non-military payloads and one commercial satellite. The Delta IV originally had two main versions, which allowed the family to accommodate a range of payload sizes and masses; models include the retired Medium, which had four configurations, and the Heavy. As of 2019, only the Heavy remains active; payloads that would previously fly on Medium moved to either the existing Atlas V or the forthcoming Vulcan. Retirement of the Delta IV family as a whole is anticipated in 2024. =Delta Cryogenic Second Stage= The Delta Cryogenic Second Stage (DCSS) is a family of cryogenic rocket stages used on the Delta III and Delta IV rockets, and which is planned to be used on the Space Launch System Block 1. DCSS consists of a cylindrical liquid hydrogen tank structurally separated from an oblate spheroid liquid oxygen tank. The liquid hydrogen tank cylinder carries payload launch loads, while the liquid oxygen tank and engine are suspended below within the rocket's interstage. The stage is powered by a single Pratt & Whitney RL10B-2 engine, which features an extendable carbon-carbon nozzle to improve specific impulse.  In development  Vulcan = Diagram of the ULA Vulcan rocket Vulcan is a heavy-lift launch vehicle that ULA is developing to meet the demands of the NSSL competition and launch program. The rocket is ULA's first launch vehicle design, which is adapting and evolving technologies that were developed for the Atlas V and Delta IV rockets. The first-stage propellant tanks share the diameter of the Delta IV Common Booster Core but will contain liquid methane and liquid oxygen propellants rather than the Delta IV's liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen. Blue Origin's BE-4 engine was selected to power Vulcan's first stage in September 2018 after a competition with the Aerojet Rocketdyne's AR1. ULA may use the Sensible Modular Autonomous Return Technology (SMART) which seeks to capture and re-use the BE-4 engines. Vulcan's upper stage will be the Centaur V, an upgraded variant of the Common Centaur/Centaur III that is currently used on the Atlas V. A lengthened version of the Centaur V will be used on the Vulcan Centaur Heavy. ULA plans to eventually upgrade the Centaur V with Integrated Vehicle Fluids technology to become the Advanced Cryogenic Evolved Stage (ACES). Vulcan is intended to undergo the human-rating certification process to allow the launch of crew in a vehicle such as the Boeing Starliner or a crewed version of the Sierra Nevada Dream Chaser. Vulcan will have a maximum liftoff thrust of 3.8 million pounds and carry 56,000 pounds to low Earth orbit, 33,000 pounds to a geo-transfer orbit, and 16,000 pounds to geostationary orbit with a heavier payload than any currently available single-core rocket. ULA is working on the 'Sensible Modular Autonomous Return Technology' (SMART) reuse concept. The booster engines, avionics, and thrust structure would be detached as a module from the propellant tanks after booster engine cutoff, with the module descending through the atmosphere under an inflatable heat shield. After parachute deployment, the module would be captured by a helicopter in mid-air. ULA estimated that this would reduce the cost of the first stage propulsion by 90%, and 65% of the total first stage cost. The Vulcan rocket, directly and indirectly, provides about 22,000 jobs spread over 46 states. During the first several years of its development, the ULA board of directors made quarterly funding commitments to Vulcan Centaur development. , the US government had committed approximately in a public‚Äìprivate partnership to Vulcan Centaur development, with future funding being dependent on ULA securing an NSSL contract. By March 2016, the US Air Force had committed up to of funding for Vulcan development. At that time, ULA had not yet estimated the total cost of Vulcan development, but CEO Tory Bruno noted that \\"new rockets typically cost $2 billion, including $1 billion for the main engine.\\" In April 2016, ULA Board of Directors member and President of Boeing's Network and Space Systems (N&SS;) division Craig Cooning expressed confidence in the possibility of further USAF funding of Vulcan development. In March 2018, ULA CEO Tory Bruno said that Vulcan-Centaur had been \\"75 percent privately funded\\" up to that time. In October 2018 and following a request for proposals and technical evaluation, ULA was awarded $967 million to develop a prototype Vulcan launch system as a part of the National Security Space Launch program. Two other providers, Blue Origin and Northrop Grumman Innovation Systems, were awarded $500 million and $792 million in development funding, with detailed proposals and a competitive selection process to follow in 2019. The USAF's goal with the next generation of Launch Service Agreements is to get out of the business of \\"buying rockets\\" and move to acquire launch services from launch service providers, but U.S. government funding of launch vehicle development continues. In August 2020, the U.S. Space Force awarded ULA along with SpaceX a firm, fixed-price indefinite-delivery contract to launch 60% of National Security Space Launch (NSSL) Phase 2 missions over a 5-year procurement with the next-generation Vulcan Centaur rocket. In September 2020, ULA announced that ULA is carefully studying a \\"Vulcan Heavy\\" variant with three booster cores. Speculation about a new variant had been rampant for months after an image of a model of that version popped on social media. Tory Bruno later tweeted a clearer image of the model and said it was the subject of ongoing study.  Retired  Delta II = Ignition of the engines of a Delta II Delta II was an expendable launch system that was originally designed and built by McDonnell Douglas, and was later built by Boeing prior to the formation of ULA. Delta II was part of the Delta rocket family and entered service in 1989. Delta II vehicles included the Delta 6000 and the two later Delta 7000 variants (\\"Light\\" and \\"Heavy\\"). The rocket flew its final mission ICESat-2 on 15 September 2018. While all completed Delta II rockets have launched, many flight-qualified spare parts remain. These parts will be assembled to create a nearly-complete Delta II, for exhibition in its 7420-10 configuration. The rocket will be displayed vertical at the Kennedy Space Center Visitors Complex, and may bear its popular \\"shark teeth\\" livery on its fairing, which was painted on past Delta II rockets for the GPS launches.  Launch history = 2006‚Äì2009  The first launch conducted by ULA was a Delta II from Vandenberg Air Force Base on December 14, 2006, carrying the satellite USA-193 for the National Reconnaissance Office. The satellite failed shortly after launch and was intentionally destroyed on February 21, 2008, by an SM-3 missile that was fired from the Ticonderoga class cruiser USS Lake Erie. ULA's first Atlas V launch was in March 2007; it was an Atlas V variant 401 launching six military research satellites for Space Test Program (STP) 1. This mission also performed three burns of the Centaur upper stage; it was the first three-burn mission for Atlas V. ULA's first commercial mission COSMO- SkyMed was launched on behalf of Italy's Ministry of Defense three months later using a Delta II rocket. On June 15, 2007, the engine in the Centaur upper stage of a ULA-launched Atlas V shut down early, leaving its payload ‚Äì a pair of NROL-30 ocean surveillance satellites ‚Äì in a lower than intended orbit. The NRO declared the launch a success. 2007 also saw ULA's first two interplanetary spacecraft launches using the Delta II; the Phoenix probe was launched to Mars in August and the Dawn satellite to was launched to the asteroids Vesta and Ceres in September 2007. Using a Delta II, the WorldView-1 satellite was also launched into a low Earth orbit on behalf of DigitalGlobe. The company's first launch to geostationary transfer orbit using an Atlas V 421 variant carrying the USA-195 (or WGS-1) communications satellite also occurred that year. ULA's tenth mission was launching satellite GPS IIR-17 into medium Earth orbit on a Delta II. The company completed its first Delta IV launch using the Delta IV Heavy rocket to place a payload into geosynchronous orbit in November, which was followed by three more launches in December. 2008 saw seven launches, including Atlas V's from Vandenberg's Space Launch Complex 3E and five others using the Delta II. The Atlas launch carried NROL-28 in March 2008 and in September 2008 the GeoEye-1 satellite was orbited by a Delta II rocket. ULA completed eight Delta II, five Atlas V, and three Delta IV launches in 2009. The Delta II launches carried three Space Tracking and Surveillance System satellites over two launches, two Global Positioning System satellites, and the NOAA-19 and WorldView-2 satellites, as well as the Kepler and the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer space telescopes. The Atlas launches carried the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter and LCROSS mission as part of the Lunar Precursor Robotic Program, which was later intentionally crashed into the moon and found the existence of water; other 2009 Atlas V launches in included Intelsat 14, WGS-2, PAN, and a weather satellite as part of the Defense Meteorological Satellite Program (DMSP). The Delta IV rockets carried the NROL-26, GOES 14, and WGS-3 satellites.  2010‚Äì2014  In 2010, Atlas V launches deployed the Solar Dynamics Observatory, the first Boeing X-37B, the first Advanced Extremely High Frequency (AEHF) satellite, and the NROL-41. The Delta II system placed the last COSMO-SkyMed and Delta IV launches deployed the GOES 15, GPS Block IIF, and USA-223 satellites. ULA completed eleven launches in 2011, including five by Atlas, three by Delta II, and three by Delta IV. The Atlas system orbited another Boeing X-37, two NROL-34 signals intelligence satellites, a Space-Based Infrared System (SBIS) satellite, the Juno spacecraft and Curiosity rover. The Delta II launches placed the SAC-D and Suomi NPP satellites into orbit, as well as two spacecraft associated with NASA's GRAIL lunar mission. Delta IV launches carried the NROL-49, NROL-27, and another GPS satellite. ULA's 2012 launches included six Atlas Vs and four Delta IVs. The Atlas system carried Mobile User Objective System (MUOS) and AEHF satellites, another Boeing X-37, the Intruder and Quasar satellites, and the Van Allen Probes. Delta IVs deployed GPS and WGS satellites USA-233, as well as NROL-25 and NROL-15 on behalf of the National Reconnaissance Office. In 2013, the Atlas flew eight times. The system launched the TDRS-11, Landsat 8, AEHF-3, and NROL-39 satellites, as well as SBIS, GPS, and MUOS satellites, as well as NASA's MAVEN space probe to Mars. Delta IV launches orbited the fifth and sixth Wideband Global SATCOM satellites WGS-5 and WGS-6, as well as NROL-65. In 2014, ULA's Atlas V orbited the TDRS-12 communications satellite in January, the WorldView-3 commercial satellite in August,WorldView-3: * * and the CLIO communications satellite during September and October. Atlas rockets also carried the satellites DMSP-5D-3/F19, NROL-67, NROL-33, and NROL-35. Delta IV rockets orbited GPS satellites and two Geosynchronous Space Situational Awareness Program satellites, and in July, NASA's Orbiting Carbon Observatory 2 was carried by a Delta II. Orion's first test flight was launched by a Delta IV Heavy rocket in December 2014, as part of Exploration Flight Test-1.  2015‚Äì2019  A Delta II rocket orbited a Soil Moisture Active Passive satellite in January 2015. In March, an Atlas V rocket carried NASA's Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission spacecraft,Magnetospheric Multiscale Mission: * * and a Delta IV rocket orbited the GPS IIF-9 satellite on behalf of the U.S. Air Force.GPS IIF-9: * * The U.S. Air Force's X-37B spaceplane was carried by an Atlas V rocket in May, and a Delta IV orbited the WGS-7 satellite in July. The fourth MUOS satellite was orbited by an Atlas V in September.MUOS-4: * * ULA's 100th consecutive successful liftoff was completed on October 2, 2015, when an Atlas V rocket orbited a Mexican Satellite System communications satellite on behalf of the Secretariat of Communications and Transportation. The classified NROL-55 satellite was launched by an Atlas V rocket several days later. Atlas V rockets launched GPS Block IIF satellites and the Cygnus cargo spacecraft in November and December, respectively.Cygnus: * * In 2016, Delta IV rockets carried the NROL-45 satellite and Air Force Space Command 6 mission in February and August, respectively. During a launch of the Atlas V rocket on March 22, 2016, a minor first-stage anomaly led to shutdown of the first-stage engine approximately five seconds before anticipated. The Centaur upper stage was able to compensate by firing for approximately one minute longer than planned using its reserved fuel margin. Atlas V rockets carried MUOS-5 in June,MUOS-5: * * NROL-61 satellites in July,NROL-61: * * and the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft in September. ULA launched multiple satellites in late 2016. The weather satellite Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite-R was carried in November, as was the WorldView-4 imaging satellite. In December, the Wideband Global SATCOM's eighth satellite WGS-8 was launched on a Delta IV Medium rocket, and an Atlas V carried the EchoStar XIX communications satellite on behalf of Hughes Communications.EchoStar XIX: * * In March 2017, WGS-9 was orbited by a Delta IV. Atlas V rockets carried NRO satellites, TDRS-M, and a Cygnus cargo capsule in 2017. The weather satellite NOAA-20 (JPSS-1) was launched by a Delta II rocket in November. left Parker Solar Probe Launch An Atlas V carried the SBIRS-GEO 4 military satellite in January 2018. The Atlas V's launch of NASA's InSight to Mars in 2018 was the first interplanetary probe to depart from the U.S. West Coast. In August 2018, a Delta IV Heavy launched Parker Solar Probe, NASA's solar space probe that will visit and study the sun's outer corona in August 2018. It was also the Delta IV Heavy with a Star-48BV kick stage, and the highest-ever spacecraft velocity. The company launched the final Delta II rocket, carrying ICESat-2 from Vandenberg Air Force Base SLC-2 on 15 September 2018. This marks the last launch of a Delta family rocket based on the original Thor IRBM. On August 22, 2019, ULA launched its last Delta IV Medium rocket for the GPS III Magellan project. An Atlas V carried Boeing's Starliner Orbital Flight Test (OFT) mission for NASA in December 2019.  2020  Solar Orbiter launch closeup In 2020, an Atlas V carried the Solar Orbiter spacecraft, an international collaboration between the European Space Agency (ESA) and NASA to provide a new global view of the sun. In March, an Atlas V also launched Advanced Extremely High Frequency 6 (AEHF-6), the first U.S. Space Force National Security Mission. In May 2020, ULA launched an Atlas V rocket carrying the USSF-7 mission with the X-37B spaceplane for the U.S Space Force and the mission honors victims of the COVID-19 pandemic as well as first responders, health professionals, military personnel, and other essential workers. On 30 July 2020, Atlas V in the 541 configuration successfully launched Perseverance and Ingenuity as part of Mars 2020 towards Mars.  Infrastructure = Launch facilities  ULA's Horizontal Integration Facility at CCAFS in February 2018 ULA operates orbital launch sites at Cape Canaveral Air Force Station in Cape Canaveral, Florida, and Vandenberg Air Force Base near Lompoc, California. In Florida, ULA has used Launch Complex 41 for Atlas V launches since its maiden flight in August 2002, and Launch Complex 37 for Delta IV launches since the rocket's maiden flight in November 2002. The company had three launch pads at Vandenberg as of April 2017. These include Launch Complex 2 for Delta II launches, Launch Complex 3 for Atlas launches and Launch Complex 6 for Delta IV and Delta IV Heavy launches. Space Launch Complex 2 is no longer in active use by ULA since the retirement of the Delta II in September 2018. Launches from Cape Canaveral typically head east to give satellites extra momentum from the rotation of the Earth as they head to other planets or into an equatorial orbit. Vandenberg Air Force Base is the primary U.S. launch site from which satellites are sent into polar orbits. Commercial and military spacecraft like imaging and weather satellites need to be launched southward on a path to reach a polar orbit to cover the entire globe. ULA's Atlas V rocket launched NASA's InSight mission to Mars from the West Coast in 2018, the first interplanetary mission to do so. In 2015, as part of the company's transition from the Atlas V and Delta IV launch vehicles to the Vulcan Centaur, ULA announced plans to reduce the number of launch pads in use from five to two by the early 2020s. ULA works closely with the 45th Weather Squadron on its launches from Florida.  Headquarters and manufacturing  ULA's headquarters building in Centennial, Colorado ULA's headquarters in Centennial, Colorado, are responsible for program management, rocket engineering, testing, and launch support functions. ULA's largest factory is and located in Decatur, Alabama. A factory in Harlingen, Texas, fabricates and assembles components for the Atlas V rocket. In 2015, the company announced the opening of an engineering and propulsion test center in Pueblo, Colorado.  Spaceflight Processing Operations Center  The Spaceflight Processing Operations Center (SPOC), located near SLC-40 and SLC-41, is used to construct the mobile launcher platform for the Vulcan launch vehicle. It also serve as a storage room for the Atlas Mobile launcher platform (MLP). On August 6, 2019, the first two parts of Vulcan's MLP were transported to the SPOC. SPOC was formerly known as the Solid Motor Assembly and Readiness Facility (SMARF) during its support of the Titan IVB launch vehicle; it was renamed during Vulcan Centaur's topping ceremony in October 2019. Cislunar 1000 Vision The Cislunar 1000 Vision is a plan created by ULA to create an economy on the Moon and in Earth orbit with 1,000 people living and working in space. A key part of the roadmap is a more powerful version of the Centaur rocket stage, ACES. ACES is designed for reusability and in situ refueling. It is thought that water collected on the moon or asteroids might be processed to generate the liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen fuel used by ACES. ACES relies on a technology called Integrated Vehicle Fluids (IVF). IVF is an auxiliary power unit not unlike those used on aircraft centered on an internal combustion engine that uses waste hydrogen and oxygen that boils off of cryogenic tanks. IVF reduces weight and cost by reducing the need for helium, hydrazine, and batteries. IVF produces electric power, maintains stage attitude, and helps keep propellant tanks autogenously pressurized. IVF will extend mission lifetimes from hours to days. The internal combustion engine to be used to power the IVF system on ACES will be produced by Roush Racing. The Cislunar Vision 1000 also includes plans for a tanker called XEUS that will be able to land on the moon to be stocked with fuel to a gravitationally stable ‚Äúlibration point‚Äù in the Earth-Moon system known as L1. Producing fuel in space will allow for dramatically cheaper space travel. ULA is itself willing to become a customer for in-space refueling.

Agudath Israel was established as an Orthodox synagogue in 1902 by Yiddish speaking Ashkenazi Jews, recent Eastern European immigrants who rejected the Reform practices of Montgomery's established Congregation Kahl Montgomery/Temple Beth Or. After renting quarters for a number of years, the congregation purchased its first permanent building on Monroe Street in 1914, and constructed a new building at McDonough and High Street in 1928. Agudath Israel came to national attention in 1955 because of the Civil rights movement activism of then-rabbi Seymour Atlas, who eventually left the synagogue as a result of it. In 1957 it constructed its current building on Cloverdale Road, and joined the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, though it subsequently hired several Orthodox rabbis. Cynthia Culpeper became Agudath Israel's rabbi in 1995, the first Conservative woman rabbi in Alabama, but left in 1997 to seek treatment for AIDS, the result of an accidental needle prick while working as a nurse. Etz Ahayem, was established in 1912 by Ladino speaking Sephardi Jews, particularly from Rhodes. The congregation grew slowly, and completed construction of its first building in 1927. In 1962 the congregation moved to a new building, but by the 1990s it had dwindled, as children of congregants moved away from Montgomery, and the synagogue had difficulty finding rabbis to lead it. The congregations merged in 2001, and adopted the current name. In 2007 Scott Kramer became Agudath Israel Etz Ahayem's third rabbi since the merger. , Kramer was the rabbi and Joy Blondheim was the president. Agudath Israel=Early history Ashkenazi Jews immigrated to Montgomery from Russia, Poland, Romania, and Ukrainian Galicia in the late 19th century. Agudath Israel was established in 1902 by 16 of them, former members of Montgomery's oldest synagogue, Temple Beth Or.Institute of Southern Jewish Life (2008).Landman (1942), vol. 7, p. 633. Though originally organized as the Orthodox Congregation Kahl Montgomery by German Jews in 1849, during the 1870s Kahl Montgomery had steadily adopted Reform practices.Rockoff (2010). It changed its name to Temple Beth Or in 1874, and officially joined the Reform movement in 1879.According to the Institute of Southern Jewish Life (2008). According to \\"Montgomery's Jewish Community\\", Encyclopedia of Alabama, Temple Beth Or officially joined the Reform movement in 1874. The more recent Eastern European immigrant members wanted a service in Hebrew that followed Orthodox practice, and decided to organize their own synagogue. The congregation's first president was Max Shuwolf, a Hungarian Jew who had first immigrated to Galveston, Texas, then ran a small dry goods store in Montgomery. He donated two rooms in his house, where the new congregation held its first services. The congregation's first constitution was written in Yiddish. Services were held in Hebrew and Yiddish, men and women sat separately, and men covered their heads, as mandated by the constitution. Over the next few years the congregation grew, and moved to a number of rented locations, including \\"rented office space above the National Shirt Company on Court Square and an annex of the First National Bank\\". By 1907, the synagogue had 30 members,At the time, only male heads of households were counted as members. and an annual revenue of $500 (today $); that year Temple Beth Or had 188 members and revenues of $9,500 (today $).American Jewish Yearbook, vol. 9, p. 126. Reflecting the membership's \\"growing assimilation\\", in 1914 Agudath Israel re- wrote its constitution in English. That same year the congregation dedicated its first permanent building, on Monroe Street, and hired its first full-time rabbi. The State of Alabama purchased the building on Monroe in 1927, and the congregation built a new synagogue on land at McDonough and High Street, a handsome, brick Rundbogenstil building, notable for its hexagonal shape,Augudath Israel Orthodox Synagogue, Alabama Department of Archives and History website. which they dedicated in 1928. At the time Agudath Israel had 65 member families. Morris Casriel Katz, a native of Felosveresmart, Czechoslovakia (now Velika Kopana, Ukraine) was rabbi from 1923 to 1926, his first pulpit before moving to Agudath Achim of Shreveport, Louisiana.Schwartz, Kaye & Simons (1939), vol. 3, p. 1138. Alexander Sandor Wiesel, a Chicago native, was rabbi in 1934. He had previously served at Brith Achim Synagogue in Petersburg, Virginia, and would move to House of Israel Synagogue in Calgary, Alberta.Schwartz, Kaye & Simons (1939), vol. 3, p. 523. Benjamin G. Eisenberg served as rabbi from 1938 until at least 1942. By then membership had dropped to around 60 member families. Seymour Atlas era Agudath Israel came to national attention in the wake of the Montgomery bus boycott of 1955. At that time, then-rabbi Seymour Atlas had been serving as Agudath Israel's rabbi for almost ten years.Staub (2002), p. 59. A southerner (from Greenville, Mississippi), he was \\"in the 8th generation of a line of rabbis\\", and had become friends with Martin Luther King Jr., tutoring him in Hebrew, and speaking at his Dexter Avenue Church. As a result of his friendship with King, Atlas became involved in the Civil rights movement, and became known for his liberal sermons, and for frequently appearing on local television and radio stations with King, where he would discuss civil rights and issues including desegregation and the boycott.Fobanjong (2002). In 1956, during National Brotherhood Week Atlas spoke on a panel of clergy at the local WRMA radio station, which also included Michael Caswell, a white Roman Catholic priest from nearby Gunter Air Force Base, Roy Bennett, a black Baptist minister, and black activist Ralph Abernathy; Bennett and Abernathy were subsequently arrested \\"on an obscure conspiracy charge\\". A picture of Atlas, Bennett, and Abernathy appeared in Life magazine in an article about the boycott, and the leadership of Agudath Israel grew concerned that Atlas's activism would lead to an antisemitic backlash. The trustees called an emergency meeting, and sent then congregational president Yale Friedlander to demand Atlas recant his support of the boycott, ask Life to withdraw the article, and agree to submit all public speeches to the board in advance for pre-approval. Atlas refused, and insisted that his participation in Brotherhood Week was not an endorsement of the boycott.According to the Institute of Southern Jewish Life (2008). Staub (2002), p. 60 writes that it was the board that insisted that Atlas state participation in Brotherhood Week was not an endorsement of the boycott, quoting the 1957 account of Harry Golden, editor of the Carolina Israelite. However, Atlas wrote a sermon for the following Shabbat which included a prayer for the participants of the boycott.According to Institute of Southern Jewish Life (2008). Staub (2002), p. 60, writes that Atlas \\"offered up a prayer for the success of the bus strike against racial segregation\\", quoting the 1957 account of Harry Golden, editor of the Carolina Israelite. Golden (1957) gives the latter account. The sermon, as with all others, was to be printed beforehand in the Montgomery Advertiser, and a typesetter there called one of the synagogue's trustees to inform him of the contents. The trustee asked Atlas to modify the sermon, but he refused. The trustees then ordered Atlas to stop inviting black clergymen to his weekly Hebrew class, \\"make no further speeches or statements outside the synagogue\\", and, as long has he was rabbi there, \\"disassociate [himself] from the Negroes completely\\". Atlas again refused, and the trustees responded by shunning him, refusing to visit his home, and literally turning their backs on him when he was around.Staub (2002), p. 60.Golden (1957), p. 3. When his contract came up for renewal that year, Atlas argued that the matter should be put to a congregational vote. The trustees refused to do so, and voted 27 to 1 not to renew the contract.According to the Institute of Southern Jewish Life (2008) the trustees refused to renew Atlas's contract. Staub (2002), p. 60 writes that Atlas resigned, quoting the 1957 account of Harry Golden, editor of the Carolina Israelite. After Atlas left, the trustees unanimously voted that the next rabbi would have to sign an agreement not to discuss \\"Negroes\\" or segregation. Post Atlas to 2000 A Star of David at Agudath Israel Etz Ahayem During the 1950s the synagogue had been \\"traditional\\" (Conservadox), rather than strictly Orthodox; for example, the Monroe Street building had seating for men on the left, seating for women on the right, and mixed seating in the middle. Following Atlas's departure, the congregation formally moved from Orthodox Judaism to Conservative, hiring a Conservative rabbi, Joseph Reich,Oberstein (2006).Oberstein (2008). and, in 1957, moved to its current location at 3525 Cloverdale Road.History, Agudath Israel Etz Ahayem website. In 1959, however, it hired as rabbi Aaron Borow, who had just graduated from the Modern Orthodox Yeshiva University.Who's who in American Jewry (1980), p. 59. While Borow did not undo the synagogue's mixed seating, he did turn off the synagogue's microphone, and turn the bimah so that the cantor faced the front of the synagogue (rather than the congregation), in the Orthodox style. In November 1964, Borow was hired as rabbi of the Orthodox Nusach Hari B‚Äônai Zion Congregation of St. Louis, Missouri, where he served until his retirement in 1999.Nusach Hari B'nai Zion Congregation History, Jewish Federation of St. Louis website. Borow was succeeded by Irving Rubin, also a graduate of Yeshiva University, who served from 1965 to 1968, before moving to Kesher Israel Synagogue in West Chester, Pennsylvania.\\"Rubin, Irving\\", Who's who in Religion (1977). Raphael Gold was rabbi from the mid-1970s to the early 1980s.Journal of the Senate of the State of Alabama (1975), vol. 3, p. 2487.Rosen (1983), p. 4. David Arzouane, another a graduate of Yeshiva University, joined Agudath Israel in 1986 as director of the Hebrew education program, a position he has held since then.About Us, Agudath Israel Etz Ahayem website. Upon receiving his ordination from the Conservative Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTSA) in 1988, Aaron Krupnick joined Agudath Israel as rabbi. He served until 1994.\\"Meet the Clergy\\", Congregation Beth El website. Agudath Israel hired Cynthia \\"Cyndie\\" Culpeper as rabbi in 1995. Culpeper, a convert from Catholicism and former nurse, had been posted at Agudath Israel as a rabbinical intern, and was hired there full-time upon graduation from the JTSA, the first Conservative woman rabbi in Alabama. However, the following year she revealed that she had AIDS, the result of an accidental needle prick while working as a nurse.Katz & Brook (1996).Connolly (2005). The congregation rallied around her, insisting she continue to work, and wearing red AIDS awareness ribbons, but in 1997 she gave up her position and moved to Birmingham, Alabama, where she could get \\"cutting edge\\" treatment at the University of Alabama at Birmingham's AIDS research clinic. Culpeper died in 2005.Brook & Wall (2005). Shalom Plotkin joined Agudath Israel as rabbi in 2000. A graduate of the University of Maryland, and ordained by the JTSA in 1998, he had been an \\"assistant rabbi at a synagogue in Marietta, Georgia\\" before coming to Agudath Israel. A chaplain in the United States Navy Reserve, he had been stationed with the U.S. Navy in the Adriatic Sea in 1995, during the Bosnian War. During his tenure at Agudath Israel, he remained in the reserve.Logan (2002).Rubin (2009). Notable members Aaron Aronov, former president of Agudath Israel, was inducted into the Alabama Academy of Honor in 1988.Aaron Morris Aronov, Alabama Academy of Honor website. Former Secretary of State, Attorney General, Lieutenant Governor and Governor of Alabama Don Siegelman and his family were also members of Agudath Israel. Though Siegelman is Catholic, his wife Lori--who grew up in Birmingham, Alabama--and two children are Jewish. His daughter Dana celebrated her Bat Mitzvah at the synagogue in February 1998.Brook (1998). Etz Ahayem Ralph Nace Cohen, a Sephardi Jew from Rhodes, settled in Montgomery in 1906, sponsored by a Greek Orthodox friend. Other Sephardi Jews followed, first from Rhodes, and then from the rest of Greece and Turkey. By 1908 this small community celebrated held its first High Holiday services in the Orthodox Community Center, space which was rented by Agudath Israel. In 1912, they named themselves Congregation Etz Ahayem (\\"Tree of Life\\"), writing a constitution in Ladino. Temple Beth Or gave them a Torah scroll, and in 1916 they formally incorporated. The congregation bought a house at 450 Sayre StreetAccording to Stanton (2006), p. 61. According to Institute of Southern Jewish Life (2008) it was a \\"plot of land\\". in 1918, but it was not until 1927 that they completed construction of a building there. At the time the congregation comprised 27 families. During the German occupation of Greece almost all the Jews of Rhodes were sent to the Auschwitz concentration camp; as a result, most members of Etz Ahayem had close family members who were killed in the Holocaust. Before the occupation, however, members of the Kal Grande congregation in Rhodes had buried their Torah scrolls. After the war the scrolls were retrieved and sent to Israel, and a Dr. Nace Cohen was able to procure one of them for Etz Ahayem. During the 1950s Etz Ahayem added a great deal of English to its prayer services, which had formerly been conducted solely in Ladino and Hebrew. During the Montgomery bus boycott, then rabbi Solomon Acrish spoke in favor of the boycott and against segregation, \\"citing the demand in Torah for social justice\\". However, after being followed, and told by gentile friends he could no longer come for dinner, and after Etz Ahayem received a bomb threat, he \\"toned down his support for desegregation\\". In 1962, the congregation moved to a new building, but the children of the congregation generally moved away from Montgomery. By the 1990s the congregation dwindled, and had difficulty finding Sephardi rabbis, relying instead on \\"lay leaders and the occasional rabbinic services from nearby Maxwell Airforce Base\\". In 2001 Maxwell Air Force Base ended its rabbinic services, and the congregation was down to 22 member families. The board of directors decided to accept an offer from Agudath Israel to enter into merger negotiations. Agudath Israel Etz Ahayem The sign of Agudath Israel Etz Ahayem Agudath Israel and Etz Ahayem merged in 2001. Agudath Israel's Rabbi Plotkin oversaw the merger, and became the rabbi of the merged congregation, Agudath Israel Etz Ahayem. Along with the new name, the synagogues combined traditions, and Ashkenazi and Sephardi rituals. Plotkin moved to Albuquerque's Congregation B'nai Israel in May 2002. From 2002 to 2006 Stephen Listfield was the rabbi;Reeves (2003). for the previous eight years he had been the rabbi of Congregation Beth Shalom in Pompton Lakes, New Jersey.Our History, Congregation Beth Shalom website. Listfield led protests by the congregation against the posthumous induction into the Alabama Military Hall of Honor of prominent United States Navy officer, frequent political candidate, and outspoken antisemite John G. Crommelin. Listfield moved to Pittsburgh's Tree of Life Congregation in August 2006.Clergy, Tree of Life Congregation website. In 2007, Scott Kramer became the congregation's rabbi, his first rabbinic post. A native of Baltimore, Kramer had a Master's degree in physics from the University of Utah, and for over two decades had worked as a software engineer. He began studying at the Ziegler School of Rabbinic Studies at the American Jewish University in 2002, and was ordained there in 2007.Our Rabbi, Agudath Israel Etz Ahayem website. , Kramer was Agudath Israel Etz Ahayem's rabbi and Joy Blondheim was the president.Board of Directors, Agudath Israel Etz Ahayem website.

The land is divided into discontinuous plots, and cultivated and occupied by a number of tenants to whom it is leased jointly. The system was common in Ireland, especially in the western counties. In Scotland, where the system also existed, it was termed run rig (from run, and rig or ridge).  History  Rundale farming systems in Ireland existed from the Early Medieval Period right up until the time of the First World War. The rundale system of agriculture consisted of nucleated villages known as clachans. Usually the land was of poor quality and the population of people trying to make a living was intensive. The main \\"clachan\\" area where the small thatched cottages were concentrated, was situated in a cluster on the best land (the infields) which was surrounded by mountain or grazing land of inferior quality (the outfields) where the livestock was grazed during summer or dry periods, a practice known as transhumance or as \\"booleying\\". All the sheep or cattle of the village were grazed together to alleviate pressure on growing crops and also provided fresh pasture for livestock. In the remote western areas of Ireland where the rundale system was most commonly seen, the land was a complex mixture of arable, rough and bogland. It was a difficult task to ensure that each tenant had an equal share of good and poor land. Rundale clachans and their transhumance pastures, also known as Booley, Boley, Bouley, Bualie and Boola can still be seen in the parish of Kilcommon in Erris, County Mayo, in many townlands such as Gortmelia, Inver and Glengad where clusters of cottages can be seen on the hillsides with land in narrow strips running down to the sea. These names survive in place names such as Buaile h'Anraoi in Kilcommon where the landscape still shows very clearly the layout of the Rundale system. The practise of booleying provided a safety valve in that it allowed maximisation of available human resources. Seasonal migration to Scotland and England superseded this ancient system and went hand-in-hand with more permanent emigration to the USA. Booleying alleviated pressure on the growing crops and provided fresh pasture for livestock while the migratory worker to the potato fields of Ayrshire or the Lothians earned sufficient income to allow him and his family to live at home for most of the year. The average holding on the small farms of County Mayo was only five acres, insufficient to maintain a family for more than part of the year. Booleying is mentioned in the Brehon Laws. John O'Donovan of the Ordnance Survey (1838) noted that the people owned houses in two townlands, one of which was a booley. \\"It is a great habit among the people of the island to have two townlands and houses built on each where they remove occasionally with their cattle. The townlands are held under one lease and one of these farms is called a Bouley.\\" The demise of booleying in Ireland came about in the 19th century when incoming landlords began to impound livestock which trespassed on their property. Retrieval fines were prohibitive and there was a consequent reduction in the number of cattle kept.  References  * Jordan D.

It is loosely based on Doctor Syn, created by Russell Thorndike, and stars Peter Cushing, Yvonne Romain and Patrick Allen. Plot In 1776, a mulatto sailor (Milton Reid) is marooned on an island after assaulting the wife of pirate captain Nathaniel Clegg. By 1792, Clegg has supposedly been captured by the Royal Navy and hanged. His resting place is the coastal village of Dymchurch on the Romney Marsh. The surrounding countryside is home to the \\"Marsh Phantoms\\": figures on horseback who ride by night and bring terror to the village. Captain Collier (Patrick Allen) and his band of sailors arrive in Dymchurch to investigate reports that the locals are involved in the smuggling of alcohol, from France. They are accompanied by the mulatto, mute after his tongue was cut out sixteen years earlier, whom Collier saved from death and now keeps as a slave. As Collier's men ransack an ale house run by Rash (Martin Benson) and his ward Imog√®ne (Yvonne Romain), the mulatto uncovers a hidden cellar. Ostensibly a varnish store, this is connected by a secret passageway to the home of coffin-maker Jeremiah Mipps (Michael Ripper), which serves as the smugglers' headquarters. The smugglers are led by the village parson Dr Blyss (Peter Cushing), whom the mulatto inexplicably attacks before being subdued by the sailors. That night, the smugglers succeed in transporting a consignment to a nearby windmill for onward shipment, although squire's son Harry (Oliver Reed), Imog√®ne's secret fianc√©, is wounded when he is shot in the arm by the pursuing Collier. Back at the ale house, Rash kills one of the sailors to prevent the smuggling operation from being exposed. This frees the mulatto, who leaves for the churchyard to break open Clegg's grave. Collier, who spent years chasing Clegg, becomes suspicious of Blyss when the mulatto later makes a second attempt on the parson's life. At Blyss's house, Rash finds Clegg's last will and testament. Learning that Imog√®ne is Clegg's daughter, he attempts to take advantage of her compromised situation to rape her, but she escapes and flees to Blyss‚Äôs home. There, Blyss and Harry both tell her they were already aware of her relationship to Clegg. After consoling Imog√®ne, Harry confronts Rash but is arrested by Collier when the captain notices the young man's bandaged arm. Harry is led away to Collier's ship as a hostage but escapes when the Marsh Phantoms appear, distracting the sailors. The Phantoms, who are actually villagers in disguise, take Harry and Imog√®ne to the church, where they are hurriedly married by Blyss before leaving to start their life together. Collier arrives at the church and announces that Clegg's grave is empty. He then tears off Blyss's collar to reveal the rope burns from an unsuccessful hanging, exposing the parson as Clegg. Clegg declares that his executioner spared his life and that he wished only to help the inhabitants of Dymchurch live comfortably. A struggle breaks out between the villagers and the sailors, enabling Clegg to flee with Mipps via the secret passageway. However, on emerging at the coffin-maker's house they run into the mulatto, who has murdered Rash and fatally impales Clegg with a spear before being shot dead by Mipps. In the film's closing scene, the villagers look on and Collier and the sailors salute as Mipps sorrowfully places Clegg's body in the open grave.

The character first appeared in Thunderbolts #19 (Oct 1998). Publication history Charcoal was created to be a villain, by means of a Wizard magazine contest. However, Wizard Entertainment failed to establish certain legal specifics in the language of their contest rules, leaving the ownership of the character's copyright in question (normally in such a situation, steps would be taken to ensure that, unless otherwise stated, such a character's copyright would legally belong to the comic's publisher). Furthermore, Wizard Entertainment reportedly failed to provide the contest winner with other prizes promised along with the winning character's appearance in a Marvel comic. Feeling undercompensated, Charcoal's creator attempted to legally claim the copyright for the character from Marvel. Meanwhile, writer Fabian Nicieza had decided to kill off Charcoal and resurrect him later on.

All IJM employees are required to be practicing Christians; 94% are nationals of the countries they work in. IJM works to combat sex trafficking, child sexual assault, cybersex trafficking, forced labor slavery, property grabbing, and police abuse of power, and addresses citizenship rights of minorities. The bulk of IJM's work focuses on sex trafficking. IJM's close coordination with third-world police agencies and the resulting arrests and deportations of sex workers have generated criticism from human rights and sex worker organizations over its mission and tactics. It has 5 international offices in Canada, UK, Netherlands, Germany and Australia. IJM, Our work, ijm.org, USA, retrieved September 19, 2020 History=Founding The International Justice Mission was founded in 1997 as a faith-based non-profit by American lawyer Gary Haugen of the United States.

Aronowitz, Human Trafficking: A Reference Handbook, ABC-CLIO, USA, 2017, p. 239 In its first case, the organization aided the arrest of a rape suspect in Manila, Philippines. In 1998, IJM claimed to have helped rescue more than 700 people. In addition to helping clients with legal representation, Haugen decided his organization could have more influence by collaborating with governments of developing countries to help improve their legal systems. Thailand brothel raids In the year 2000, and again in 2003, IJM instigated a raid on a karaoke restaurant in Chiang Mai, Northern Thailand. Thai police later twice raided the establishment, arresting and subsequently deporting the women who worked there. IJM characterized the operations as successful \\"rescues\\". In another raid in 2001, IJM sent men undercover to a brothel, used hidden cameras and produced a 25-page document alleging specific violations of Thai law. Police raided the brothel and detained 43 female sex workers. Some of the women detained by police said that they were working voluntarily and had not wished to leave the brothel. About half the group subsequently escaped; some apparently feared deportation to Burma. After the 2000 and 2003 raids on the Chiang Mai restaurant, IJM requested other local non-governmental organizations to provide translation assistance when its employees realized that the sex workers were not Thai citizens. After providing translation assistance, the Shan Women's Action Network said that the raids had grossly violated the women's human rights. The group pointed out that although IJM had twice conducted a raid on the same establishment, it failed to protect the women from prosecution and further victimization. In later years IJM moderated its initial assertion that the Thailand brothel raids were successful. In a 2012 article, Holly Burkhalter, IJM's vice president for Government Relations, characterized the 2003 raid as \\"one of the few IJM cases in which law enforcement treatment of non-coerced adults did not meet IJM standards.\\" Work in Cambodia IJM director Gary Haugen invited the American television show Dateline (NBC) to film a March 29, 2003 raid which it planned to conduct at a large Cambodian brothel in the village of Svay Pak. The brothel contained approximately 40 girls, many under the age of 10, who were detained by Thai police along with 12 accused pimps and madams. A noodle vendor, who had no involvement with the brothel, was among those who were arrested in the raid; the noodle vendor subsequently died in jail of a stroke. IJM later contracted with a Cambodian human rights organization, LICADHO, to review its actions in organizing the raid. Peter Sainsbury, the consultant who reviewed the raid, said that he had told IJM about his medical concerns about the noodle vendor, but that his concerns were ignored. At least twelve of the victims \\"rescued\\" from the 2003 Svay Pak raid ran away from the safe house to which they were taken. In a brothel raid a year later there, a number of girls rescued from the 2003 raid were found to be involved again in sex work. While IJM considered these \\"rescues\\" to be successes, critics questioned the organization's tactics, saying raids on brothels do not focus on the root causes of child prostitution, have led to the arrests of people not in the sex trade, and hindered HIV-prevention initiatives. Work in Ghana In 2017, Ghanaian authorities removed 31 children believed to be engaged in forced labor from fishing communities within the area of Lake Volta and placed them into custody. The authorities who placed the children into custody included representatives from Ghanaian social welfare agencies within the government. The actions which placed the children into custody were denounced by a member of the Ghanaian parliament who represents the Afram Plains region, who stated that \\"some of the boys were merely helping their parents who fish for a living.\\" Other Ghanaian officials said it was typical for families to fish together in the area, and singled out IJM in particular for what they saw were instances where \\"IJM may have failed to research or understand the local culture.\\" Expansion International Justice Mission expanded its work beyond prevention of sex trafficking. By 2009 its lawyers, social workers and advocates also helped victims whose land had been seized, who were bonded laborers, or who were falsely imprisoned. In 2010 U.S. News & World Report named International Justice Mission as one of '10 Service Groups That Are Making a Difference' list. Under President Barack Obama's administration, the United States Department of State honored Haugen, International Justice Mission's founder and CEO, as a Trafficking in Persons Report Hero Acting to End Modern Slavery in 2012. The State Department said IJM helped nearly 4,000 victims and assisted in the prosecution of 220 offenders between 2006 and 2012. In December 2011, Google awarded a total of US$11.5 million in grants to organizations to combat modern-day slavery. Google donated $9.8 million to International Justice Mission to lead a coalition focusing on fighting slavery in India, in addition to running advocacy and education programs in the country, and mobilizing Americans. IJM CEO Gary Haugen and Victor Boutros co-wrote The Locust Effect: Why the End of Poverty Requires the End of Violence in 2014. They won the 2016 University of Louisville Grawemeyer Award for Ideas Improving World Order for this book. Haugen gave a 19-minute TED talk on this material in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada, in 2015. Within 20 years of its founding, International Justice Mission had grown into an organization with a $51.6 million budget comprising more than 750 employees in 17 field offices in Africa, Latin America, South Asia and Southeast Asia, and five partner offices in Canada, UK, Netherlands, Germany and Australia. In July 2016, Willie Kimani, a Kenyan IJM lawyer, and two persons, including an IJM client, were found murdered and dumped in a river outside Nairobi in Kenya. They were last seen alive at a police station. Four members of the Kenyan Administrative Police were charged with murder on July 18, 2016; they pleaded not guilty. Haugen denounced the killings as \\"an intolerable outrage and should serve as an abrupt wake-up call to the blatant injustices committed daily and incessantly against the poor and vulnerable around the world\\".

IJM cites the Bible verse Isaiah 1:17 as one of their core commitments:https://www.ijm.org/content/statement-biblical-foundation ] Learn to do right; seek justice. Defend the oppressed. Take up the cause of the fatherless; plead the case of the widow. - New International Version (NIV), Bible Gateway Through Project Lantern, International Justice Mission worked to develop a model for combatting sex slavery and human trafficking that other organizations and agencies could use. In 2010, IJM reported the project documented a 79 percent decrease in the number of minors sold for sex in Cebu, Philippines. Project Lantern was funded by a $5 million grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation in 2006. In addition to its aforementioned work, International Justice Mission runs programs to train criminal justice departments and governments and provides legal aid. Napp Nazworth, 'Massive generational' shift changing evangelical institutions on justice issues, Gary Haugen says, christianpost.com, USA, April 24, 2019 The organization runs programs to help victims recover from their time in forced labor. Additionally, IJM has endorsed proposed legislation in Washington, D.C., to enhance anti-trafficking efforts, including the End Modern Slavery Initiative. Investigations from third-party sources have presented some negative outcomes of IJM's work. A United States Agency for International Development-funded census of sex workers in Cambodia in 2003 found that underage prostitution increased in the area in the months following a series of brothel rescue missions organized by IJM. A researcher said that's because the girls have debt contracts and families are pressured to pay back those debts after the girls are rescued. The Nation reported that under Thai law at the time of specific raids in Thailand, voluntary sex workers faced deportation after raids. In the Philippines, The Nation reported, \\"a number of the women and girls\\" housed in a government-run facility following rescue missions escaped. In 2016, Holly Burkhalter, IJM's senior advisor for Justice System Transformation, said that within 10 years of working with the government in Cambodia, less than 1 percent of victims of sex trafficking were minors. Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama have both commended IJM for its work. During International Women's Day on 12 March 2004, Bush extolled the work of an IJM official in charge of anti-trafficking operations. Bush went on to state that the U.S. government would stand by IJM's mission to end sex slavery. In 2012, Obama said International Justice Mission was \\"truly doing the Lord's work\\" during the annual meeting of the Clinton Global Initiative. In 2014, a group of students at the University of Wisconsin Madison started a nonprofit coffee pop-up shop, called A Just Brew. This organization donates any profit from sales to help end slavery through the work of International Justice Mission.  Governance and financials  International Justice Mission's global headquarters is located in Washington, D.C. It is governed by a 13-member international board of directors, which includes founder and CEO Gary Haugen. As of 2016, Nicole Bibbins Sedaca chairs the board. On June 1, 2016, the independent charity watchdog Charity Navigator gave International Justice Mission four stars with an overall score of 92.15 out of 100. The organization scored 88.91 for its finances, and 100 for accountability and transparency. According to a 2015 independent auditor's report by RSM US, International Justice Mission generated $51.56 million in total support and revenue in 2015. The organization's expenses totaled $52.25 million. Year-end net assets were $20.03 million. International Justice Mission's 2015 funding came primarily from individuals (71%), in addition to foundations and businesses (12%), IJM partner offices (6%), churches (4%), gifts-in-kind (4%), government grants (1%) and other sources (2%). Programs accounted for 75% of expenses, general and administrative costs for 12%, and expenditures for fundraising for 13%. Among its grants, the United States Department of Labor awarded International Justice Mission a three-year cooperative agreement on September 30, 2002. The nearly $703,000 grant helped implement the Thailand Sex Trafficking Task Force: Prevention and Placement program. Then-U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell provided the organization with a $1 million grant to combat sex trafficking in Southeast Asia in 2004. Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation awarded a $5 million grant in 2006. On December 14, 2011, the Google Foundation awarded $11.5 million to organizations fighting modern slavery. Among the groups to receive those funds were International Justice Mission, BBC World Service Trust, ActionAid India and Aide et Action. Criticism IJM has aroused criticism over its tactics and mission. Much of the criticism stems from IJM's role in organizing brothel raids and subsequent arrests or deportations of sex workers. Others have criticized IJM for hindering HIV prevention efforts and for maligning local organizations which have questioned its tactics. Still others have questioned IJM's focus on law enforcement tactics and close coordination with police agencies to carry out a human rights mission. Maligning local organizations IJM organized brothel raids have been accused of interfering with public health and HIV- prevention efforts, some of which took place at the brothels themselves. In response, IJM has stated that sex workers can instead go to clinics for such information.A False Controversy: Law Enforcement and the Sexual Exploitation of Children and Trafficked Women When Thai organization EMPOWER raised questions about the televised brothel raid, Empower staff say IJM accused their organization of supporting pimps. The International Union of Sex Workers criticizes IJM's work as being focused on Christianity, and for presenting anyone involved in sex work, coerced or not, in the role of a victim awaiting salvation. It states that crackdowns drive prostitution further underground. Others have criticized brothel raids more generally as an ineffective way to fight human trafficking, likely to cause harm to those allegedly rescued, and disruptive of public health efforts. IJM response to criticism After The Nation published a series of critical articles about IJM in 2009, IJM published a document to clarify and explain its mission and tactics. Its piece says that IJM operations with local police are focused solely on securing for children and trafficked women the right to be free from commercial sexual exploitation and that IJM supports HIV-prevention efforts. It says that it has introduced protocols to local law enforcement that address the appropriate treatment of non-trafficked adults who work in the brothel with minors. IJM has refused to share these protocols with reporters. IJM states that it supports \\"placing child trafficking victims in secure environments from which they cannot leave\\". IJM's Holly Burkhalter, Vice President of Government Relations and Advocacy, formerly with Human Rights Watch and Physicians for Human Rights, wrote an article, \\"Sex Trafficking, Law Enforcement and Perpetrator Accountability,\\" presenting IJM positions on these issues. It was published in the first issue of the new journal, Anti-Trafficking Review, published in June 2012.\\"Sex Trafficking, Law Enforcement and Perpetrator Accountability\\", Anti-Trafficking Review, Issue 1, June 2012 References External links  * Global Website of International Justice Mission * The Freedom Common by IJM Government Relations & Advocacy Team * Official Website of IJM Institute for Biblical Justice * Tackling slavery with the International Justice Mission at The Cavalier Daily * India: the bond of freedom - Interview with Saju Mathew at the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime * 200th Anniversary of the Abolition of the Transatlantic Slave Trade at United States Department of State Category:International human rights organizations Category:International non-profit organizations Category:Anti‚Äìchild pornography organizations Category:Charities based in Washington, D.C.

He is a fellow of the British Academy and a priest of the Church of England. He was a canon of Christ Church, Oxford, until 2003. Comparative theology and the relationship between science and religion are two of his main topics of interest. He was Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Oxford from 1991 to 2004. Academic work Ward was born on 22 August 1938 in Hexham. He graduated in 1962 with a Bachelor of Arts degree from the University of Wales and from 1964 to 1969 was a lecturer in logic at the University of Glasgow. He earned a Bachelor of Letters degree from Linacre College, Oxford, in 1968. From 1969 to 1971 he was lecturer in philosophy at the University of St Andrews. In 1972, he was ordained as a priest in the Church of England. From 1971 to 1975 he was lecturer in philosophy of religion at the University of London. From 1975 to 1983, he was dean of Trinity Hall, Cambridge. He was appointed the F. D. Maurice Professor of Moral and Social Theology at the University of London in 1982, professor of history and philosophy of religion at King's College London in 1985 and Regius Professor of Divinity at the University of Oxford in 1991, a post from which he retired in 2004. In 1992, Ward was a visiting professor at the Claremont Graduate University in California. In 1993‚Äì94, he delivered the prestigious Gifford Lectures at the University of Glasgow. He was the Gresham Professor of Divinity between 2004 and 2008 at Gresham College, London.Online lecture archive at Gresham College Ward is on the council of the Royal Institute of Philosophy and is a member of the editorial boards of Religious Studies, the Journal of Contemporary Religion, Studies in Inter- Religious Dialogue and World Faiths Encounter. He is a member of the board of governors of the Oxford Centre for Hindu Studies. He has also been a visiting professor at Drake University, Iowa, and at the University of Tulsa, Oklahoma.Professor Keith Ward, Gresham College profile, Accessed 26 January 2007 Ward has MA and DD degrees from both Cambridge and Oxford universities, and an honorary DD from the University of Glasgow. Focus and beliefs One of Ward's main focuses is the dialogue between religious traditions, an interest which led him to be joint president of the World Congress of Faiths (WCF) from 1992 to 2001. His work also explores concepts of God and the idea of revelation. He has also written on his opinion of a relationship between science and religion.Keith Ward's Oxford University profile , Accessed, 7 November 2006 As an advocate of theistic evolution, he regards evolution and Christianity as essentially compatible, a belief he has described in his book God, Chance and Necessity and which is in contrast to his Oxford colleague Richard Dawkins, a vocal and prominent atheist. Ward has said that Dawkins' conclusion that there is no God or any purpose in the universe is \\"naive\\" and not based on science but on a hatred of religion. Dawkins' strong anti- religious views originate, according to Ward, from earlier encounters with \\"certain forms of religion which are anti-intellectual and anti-scientific ... and also emotionally pressuring.\\"Video interview by Robert Wright for meaningoflife.tv at 28:00 and following He has also been highly critical of materialist philosophers of consciousness such as Daniel Dennett, as well as social scientists such as Sigmund Freud and Karl Marx, arguing that they each attempt to reduce the human person into aspects of their own discipline. Ward has described his own Christian faith as follows: > I am a born-again Christian. I can give a precise day when Christ came to me > and began to transform my life with his power and love. He did not make me a > saint. But he did make me a forgiven sinner, liberated and renewed, touched > by divine power and given the immense gift of an intimate sense of the > personal presence of God. I have no difficulty in saying that I > wholeheartedly accept Jesus as my personal Lord and Saviour. Ward has criticised modern-day Christian fundamentalism, most notably in his 2004 book What the Bible Really Teaches: A Challenge for Fundamentalists. He believes that fundamentalists interpret the Bible in implausible ways and pick and choose which of its passages to emphasise to fit pre-existing beliefs. He argues that the Bible must be taken \\"seriously\\" but not always \\"literally\\" and does not agree with the doctrine of biblical inerrancy, saying that it is not found in the Bible, elaborating that > There may be discrepancies and errors in the sacred writings, but those > truths that God wished to see included in the Scripture, and which are > important to our salvation, are placed there without error ... the Bible is > not inerrant in detail, but God has ensured that no substantial errors, > which mislead us about the nature of salvation, are to be found in > Scripture.

Its primary task is training leaders and soldiers assigned to the 101st Airborne Division (AASLT), other United States Army units and United States Armed Forces service members in several courses annually. The school is named for Command Sergeant Major Walter James Sabalauski. Air Assault School is known as the ten toughest days in the United States Army and the dropout rate is around 50 percent.http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0109/20/se.42.html Approximately 15 percent of the class does not make it through the challenging Zero day which includes the demanding obstacle course.http://www.rotc.armstrong.edu/TrainingAAS.htm An average of approximately 30-40 students fail the course of those who make it past \\"Zero\\" day. Of those who fail after Zero day, many typically don't make it through the sling load testing in phase two.https://www.army.mil/article/51585/hit- the-right-marks-in-air-assault-school/  Background  Air Assault School qualifies soldiers to conduct airmobile and air assault helicopter operations, to include aircraft orientation, slingload operations, proper rappelling techniques and fast-rope techniques. The school itself is 10 days of rigorous, fast-paced training. The high standards of the school require the student to take part in a 19 km (12-mile) march with rucksack in under three hours on the morning of graduation to be awarded their wings. The original school is located at Fort Campbell, Kentucky (home of the 101st Airborne Division). There are also or have been schools at * Fort Rucker, Alabama * Schofield Barracks, Hawaii * Fort Hood, Texas * Fort Bliss, Texas * Camp Blanding, Florida * Fort Benning, Georgia * Fort Drum, New York * Fort Ord, California * Fort Riley, Kansas * Fort Richardson, Alaska * Fort Wainwright, Alaska * Fort Belvoir, Virginia * Fort Bragg, North Carolina * Camp Gruber, Oklahoma * West Point, New York Instructors at the course are referred to as Air Assault Sergeants. It is open to both males and females. The school is composed of learning helicopter insertion techniques, pathfinder operations, sling load operations as well as rappelling from buildings, cliffs and helicopters. Each day begins with rigorous physical training that includes unit runs from 3.2 to 8 km (2 to 5 miles). Attention to detail and tedious packing lists, the contents of which are carried in a 16 kg (35-pound) ruck sack daily, are also the order of the day; one missing item from these lists or failing any task from any phase of the course, could cause the student to be dropped from the school immediately. Courses offered at the Air Assault School include: Air Assault, Pathfinder, Pre-Ranger, Rappel Master and Fast Rope Insertion Extraction System (FRIES)/Special Purpose Insertion Extraction (SPIES) Master courses. TSAAS is also home to the Division's Parachute Demonstration Team. The 101st Airborne Division, a parachute and glider-borne unit that conducted two jumps during World War II, was converted to an Airmobile unit in 1968 in Vietnam, becoming the 101st Airborne Division (Airmobile). The parenthetical designation changed to Air Assault in late 1974. According to popular myth, the Airborne tab over the unit's Screaming Eagle shoulder patch remained because two of the division's units, a parachute rigger detachment and a pathfinder company, were both still on jump status. There is, however, no basis for this under AR 670-1, Wear and Appearance of Army Uniforms and Insignia. According to The Institute of Heraldry, the Airborne tab is ‚Äúan intrinsic part of shoulder sleeve insignia,‚Äù not a detachable insignia added if a unit is on jump status, and according to its records the unit is still designated the 101st Airborne Division. There are numerous other non-parachute units with subordinate parachute units, such as long range surveillance troops (company equivalents) within battlefield surveillance brigades, but their presence does not entitle entire brigades to wear the Airborne tab. Regarding the division‚Äôs remaining parachute units, it now has one pathfinder company in each of its two aviation brigades, but the rigger unit was separated from the division many years ago. Until late 2013, parachute rigger support was provided by the locally assigned 4th Platoon of the Fort Bragg-based 647th Quartermaster Company. In October 2013 jump status for the two pathfinder companies was terminated, leaving no parachute positions within the division, and the rigger platoon departed from the post. In 2015 the 159th Combat Aviation Brigade was inactivated, along with its pathfinder company, and in 2016 the pathfinder company of the Combat Aviation Brigade, 101st Airborne Division (formerly the 101st Combat Aviation Brigade) was inactivated as well. This left the 101st with the same configuration as the 10th Mountain Division, a light infantry unit. Graduation from the Air Assault School is not required to be a soldier in the 101st, but it is looked upon as an achievement of excellence by the chain of command. In 1998, a new tower was completed and Phase Three began to train at this site. On 17 December 1999 the new Sabalauski Air Assault School facility was dedicated and for the first time in several years all phases of instruction are conducted at one facility. Over sixty classes are run annually, training over 8,000 soldiers per year.  Training  Air Assault School is a 10 ¬Ω day course that teaches air assault techniques and procedures, and qualifies soldiers to wear the Air Assault Badge.  Day Zero  Soldiers are not considered ‚ÄúAir Assault Students‚Äù until after successful completion of Zero, the first day of the course, which requires students to complete an obstacle course, two-mile (3.2 km) run, and extensive physical training.  Inspection  This inspection is extremely meticulous. It is conducted after the 9.7 km (6 mile) foot-march on day one. Soldiers must have all items on the packing list each student is given, with each item clean and serviceable (in usable condition). If a soldier is missing any item during the inspection, that soldier will be immediately dropped from the course. The inspection has a very specific lay-out that the soldier must adhere to. Every item must be placed exactly how the Air Assault instructors have displayed the items, and all items must be laid out \\"as worn.\\"  Obstacle course and two-mile run  Student traverses obstacle course during Day Zero of Air Assault School The obstacle course is designed to assess a student‚Äôs upper body strength, agility, endurance, confidence, and ability to perform at heights without displaying fear or distress. This test is critical in determining if a student will be able to complete Air Assault School without becoming a safety risk to themselves, instructors, or other students during the tough and demanding training events conducted throughout the course. There are nine total obstacles. There are two obstacles that are considered mandatory, and failing either will result in being dropped from the course. The other seven are minor obstacles, and the Air Assault prospect is allowed to fail one of the seven and still continue. This means that failing two of the minor obstacles will result in being dropped from the course. Prior to the obstacle course, students will conduct a two-mile (3.2 km) run. Students must complete the run in under 18:00 to receive a \\"GO\\" in the event (meaning satisfactory completion of the event). The uniform for the run is Army Combat Uniform (ACU ‚Äì minus the ACU Top depending on the season in which the training cycle begins) with running shoes. Phase One ‚Äì Combat Assault Students rehearse ground maneuvers during Combat Assault Phase Phase One, the Combat Assault Phase, is three days long. During this phase, soldiers receive instructions on the following tasks: *Aircraft Safety *Aircraft Orientation ‚Äì includes the familiarization of the characteristics and capabilities of Army aircraft *Aero Medical Evacuation ‚Äì includes the capabilities and request procedures for MEDEVAC aircraft *Pathfinder Operations ‚Äì HLZ selection, marking and operation for day and night missions involving multiple aircraft, to include sling loads *Hand-and-arm signals ‚Äì soldiers are taught 17 hand-and-arm signals used during sling load operations *Close Combat Attacks ‚Äì use of attack in a close air support (CAS) role *Combat Assault Operations ‚Äì includes various factors encompassed in an air assault operation such as: components of an air assault mission, the reverse planning sequence, duties and responsibilities of platoon-level personnel during an air assault, static load training, and a simulated combat assault on UH-60 aircraft Soldiers are given two tests: *Written ‚Äì The written test consists of 50 multiple-choice questions. Soldiers must achieve 70 percent to receive a \\"GO\\" on the written test. *Hands-on ‚Äì Students are tested on 10 of 16 hand-and-arm signals and must correctly perform seven of the 10 to receive a \\"GO\\". Soldiers must pass both tests to move on to the Sling Load Phase. They are allowed one retest per exam. Phase Two ‚Äì Slingload Operations UH-60 Black Hawk as they prepare to attach a slingload during one of the practical exercises. Phase Two, Slingload Operations, is three days long. During the Sling Load Phase, soldiers receive instruction on various aspects of sling load operations. This includes: *Planning and preparation for sling load operations *Capabilities, characteristics, and use of sling load equipment *Duties and responsibilities of sling load personnel *Familiarization with sling load theory and rigging of non-standard loads Students receive hands-on training on preparation, rigging, and inspection of several certified or suitable external loads. These may include the following loads: *M1097 HMMWV *M1097 HMMWV, shotgun/side-by-side configuration *M1151 HMMWV *M119 105mm Howitzer *M149A2 Water Trailer *A-22 Cargo Bag *Fuel Blivets (one, two, three, or four blivit configuration) *2,250 kg (5000 lbs) or 4,500 kg (10,000 lbs) Cargo Net The soldiers will also conduct an actual hook-up of a load underneath a CH-47 or UH-60 aircraft. In this phase, soldiers are given two tests: *Written ‚Äì The written test consists of 50 multiple-choice questions. Soldiers must achieve 70 percent to receive a \\"GO\\" on the written test. *Hands-on ‚Äì Students are tested on four of the six loads taught. Students must identify three out of four preparation and/or rigging deficiencies within two minutes per load to receive a \\"GO\\". *Soldiers must pass both tests to move on to the next phase. They are allowed one retest per exam. Phase Three ‚Äì Rappelling Phase Students practice rappelling from a UH-60 Black Hawk during Air Assault School Phase Three, the Rappelling Phase is three days long. During this phase, soldiers receive instruction on basic ground and aircraft rappelling procedures, to include the following tasks: *Tying of the hip-rappel seat (Swiss seat) *Hook-up techniques *Lock-in procedures *Rappel with and without combat equipment *Belay procedures *Fast Rope familiarization Soldiers will conduct two rappels on the wall side of the school's tower, 9 to 12 rappels from the open side, and two additional rappels from a UH-60 Blackhawk helicopter hovering at 21‚Äì27 m (70‚Äì90 ft). All rappels are conducted with and without combat equipment. During fast rope familiarization, students conduct a controlled descent and a static hold for five seconds. Students that successfully conduct both descents from a platform then descend from the tower using the stack-out/rapid exit technique. Fast rope descents are conducted without combat equipment. Soldiers are tested on: *Tie the Hip rappel (Swiss) seat (the 90 second time limit has been reinstated) *Hook-up to a rappel rope without deficiency (the 15 second time limit has been reinstated) *Conduct three rappels: lock-in rappel, rappel without combat equipment (also known as a \\"Hollywood\\" rappel) with three controlled brakes, and combat equipment rappel with three controlled brakes Soldiers must pass all tests to move on to the next phase and are allowed one retest per exam. The standards of this course are so strict because failure to master the skills increases the chances of an accident significantly. The margin for error in this type of training is small. 12-mile ruck march The final event is the ruck march. Soldiers must complete the ruck march with the prescribed uniform and equipment in three hours or less in order to graduate. The ruck march is a graded task and a graduation requirement for Air Assault School. Upon completion of the ruck march, Soldiers must do a layout of all items in the packing list. Failure to have 100% of the items results in a failure and not being able to graduate. Graduation *Graduates are awarded the Air Assault Badge and the 2B ASI (Additional Skill Identifier) unless they did not come out of the helicopter qualified to inspect rigged sling loads. *Graduates in the rank of Corporal (E-4) and above are qualified to perform as rappel lane NCOs for ground rappel training and are eligible to attend the Rappel Master Course. *Graduates in the rank of Sergeant First Class (E-7) or above are qualified to serve as a rappel site Safety Officer for ground and aircraft rappelling.

The band were mostly known for their early use of Satanic and occult imagery in their music and stage act. History The band originally formed in 1966 as Pesky Gee! with Kay Garrett (lead vocals), Kip Trevor (lead vocals, guitar and harmonica), Chris Dredge (guitar), Bob Bond (bass guitar), Clive Box (drums and piano), Gerry \\"Zoot\\" Taylor (organ), Clive Jones (aka Clive Beer-Jones; saxophone and flute). Jim Gannon (guitar, vocals and vibes), replaced Dredge in Spring 1969. The band released one album for Pye Records as Pesky Gee!, 1969's Exclamation Mark, before Garrett left the band. The remaining band members continued on as Black Widow and released their debut album Sacrifice in 1970. Sacrifice reached No. 32 on the UK Albums Chart. The band performed at the Whitsun Festival at Plumpton, UK, and at The Isle of Wight Festival in 1970. By 1971, the band had moved away from its darker occult imagery in an effort to gain a wider audience, which was unsuccessful. Having replaced Bond and Box with Geoff Griffith and Romeo Challenger, Black Widow released the self-titled Black Widow album in 1971 and Black Widow III in 1972 (by which time Gannon had left, replaced by John Culley) to general lack of interest, before being dropped by CBS Records. The band recorded an album, Black Widow IV, later in 1972 without a recording contract. It was not released then due to the band breaking up, shortly after replacing lead vocalist Kip Trevor, with another singer known as Rick \\"E\\" (born Frank Karuba; formerly of 'Plum Nelly'). The album was finally released in 1997 on the Mystic Records label. In 1999 the original recordings of their debut album, made before Garrett left the band, were released as Return to the Sabbat. In 2000, Black Widow Records (an Italian label) released King of the Witches: Black Widow Tribute featuring bands such as Death SS and Church of Misery, as well as tracks featuring original members Kip Trevor and Clive Jones. In 2003, Sanctuary Records released an Anthology on double CD. In 2007, Mystic Records released a concert film Demons of the Night Gather To See Black Widow ‚Äì Live as a DVD. The film includes Black Widow's entire Sacrifice album show from 1970. Jones and Geoff Griffith started to work on new Black Widow music. Paolo \\"Apollo\\" Negri from an Italian hard rock band Wicked Minds agreed to join the project on keyboards. The next Black Widow studio album, Sleeping With Demons, had a 1980s new wave style. Rock singer Tony Martin is featured on the album as a guest vocalist on the song \\"Hail Satan\\". Black Widow's most popular song \\"Come to the Sabbat\\" has been covered by many bands and artists including Timberjack (Top 10 hit in New Zealand in 1971), Jon the Postman, Bewitched, Death SS and Propagandhi. Jones of Black Widow together with Mark Pollard and Kevin Brooks wrote an ABBA tribute song \\"Hey You Ring Me Tonight\\", recorded by the Swedish band The Airwaves and released in 2008 on their 3 track CD with the same name (Riverside Records Bonnier Amigo Distribution). In 2012, guitar player John Culley appeared on a cover version of the Black Widow song \\"You're So Wrong\\" on Corvus Stone's debut album.

It is used in foil and to a lesser extent, √©p√©e. The 1980s saw the widespread use of \\"flicks\\" ‚Äî hits delivered with a whipping motion which bends the blade around the more traditional parries, and makes it possible to touch otherwise inaccessible areas, such as the back of the opponent. This has been regarded by some fencers as an unacceptable departure from the tradition of realistic combat, where only rigid blades would be used, while others feel that the flick adds to the variety of possible attacks and targets, thereby expanding the game of foil. Technique The flick consists of an angulated attack with a whipping motion that requires the defender to make a widened parry, and exploits the flexibility of the blade. If parried, a properly executed flick whips the attacker's blade around the parry. This is a valid strategy in modern fencing, since any depression of the tip with sufficient force while contacting valid target area constitutes a touch. In pre-modern fencing, judging was done by side judges, so a touch had to land and stick long enough to be reliably counted. The flick should not be confused with whipover attacks, which occur in sabre when an attack is struck with such force that the blade \\"whips over\\" the opponent's blade when parried. Consequences Ghislain Perrier executes a flick against Choi Byung-chul (facing) in the 2013 Challenge Revenu The advent of the flick, among other factors, has caused the gap between classical and modern fencing to widen. In classical fencing, the touch scored with the flick is seen as cheating, because the fencer has changed the shape of his blade. Also, even most professionals cannot land their flick at every attempt. It takes much practice. If executed properly, a flick can displace the point by bending the blade to such a degree so that the tip of the blade is at angle of almost ninety degrees from the forte of the blade. This significant change allows for an otherwise impossible touch. For these reasons, the flick is the subject of much controversy. As of 2005, timing of fencing equipment has been changed to lengthen the time necessary that the weapon's point is pressed against the target for a valid touch to register. This was done to reduce the use of the flick and encourage the use of more traditional thrusts. This change is widely controversial, as it changes more of the game than just the ability to flick (such as giving fencers the ability to \\"lock-out\\" a riposte). Still, though, more skilled fencers have been able to continue using flicks in their tactics, although much less than before. Ironically, flicks were not entirely an artifact of electronic scoring. In 1896, The Lancet published an account of an early \\"electric scorer\\" and claimed among its advantages, that \\"flicks, or blows, or grazes produce no result.\\" Nevertheless, it is the introduction of electronic scoring to high-level competitive foil in the 1950s that is often blamed for the rise in the flick's popularity. In 2004-2005, in an effort to curtail the use of flicks, the FIE raised the contact time required to trigger the scoring apparatus from 3¬±2 milliseconds to the current 15¬±1 milliseconds. This has not made flicks impossible, but it has made them more technically demanding, as glancing hits no longer register, and it is essential that the point arrives more or less square-on. Before the rule was changed, the blade could bend more easily so the back and flanks were easier to hit and score. 2005 Timing Specifications: The new 2005 timings have increased the Impact Time from 1-5 ms to 13-15 ms, and decreased the Blocking Time from 750 +/-50 ms to 300 +/-25 ms. Thus, the blocking time has been effectively halved. This leads to situations (described above) where a riposte is \\"locked out\\". 'Lock-out' refers to the mechanism of the electronic scoring system which disallows additional touches after a certain margin of time after the first hit.

Muscle reading, also known as \\"Hellstromism\\", \\"Cumberlandism\\" or \\"contact mind reading\\", is a technique used by mentalists to determine the thoughts or knowledge of a subject, the effect of which tends to be perceived as a form of mind reading. The performer can determine many things about the mental state of a subject by observing subtle, involuntary responses to speech or any other stimuli.Christopher, Milbourne. (1996). The Illustrated History of Magic. Greenwood Publishing Group. p. 389Gardner Martin. (2012 edition, originally published in 1957). Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science. Dover Publications. \\"The unwitting translation of thoughts into muscular action is one of the most firmly established facts of psychology. In individuals particularly prone to it, it is responsible for such \\"occult\\" phenomena as the movement of a Ouija board, table tipping, and automatic writing. It is the basis of a type of mind reading known in the magic profession as \\"muscle reading.\\" Someone hides a pin in a room, and the performer finds it quickly by having a spectator take hold of his hand. The spectator thinks he is being led by the magician, but actually the performer permits the spectator to lead him by unconscious muscular tensions. Many famous muscle readers are able to dispense with bodily contact altogether, finding the hidden object merely by observing the reactions of spectators in the room.\\" It is closely related to the ideomotor effect, whereby subtle movements made without conscious awareness reflect a physical movement, action or direction which the subject is thinking about. The term \\"muscle reading\\" was coined in the 1870s by American neurologist George M. Beard to describe the actions of mentalist J. Randall Brown, an early proponent of the art.During, Simon. (2004). Modern Enchantments: The Cultural Power of Secular Magic. Harvard University Press. p. 162.  History  Muscle reading is also known by the names of those who have used it in popular performances. The success of one early performer, Stuart Cumberland, led to the technique's alternate name of Cumberlandism. The fame of the mentalist Axel Hellstrom led to it widely being called Hellstromism. Performers such as J. Randall Brown, Erik Jan Hanussen, Franz Polgar, and Kreskin have also used muscle reading successfully in their acts. In 1924, magician Carl Hertz noted that \\"mind- reading is nothing but muscle-reading. In all the cases where the mind-reader is supposed to lead a person to a hidden object, the spectator is guided entirely by an involuntary movement of the subject's muscles.\\"Hertz, Carl. (1924). A Modern Mystery Merchant. Hutchinson & Company. p. 277 The mentalist Washington Irving Bishop could drive a car blindfolded by muscle reading techniques.Neher, Andrew. (2011). Paranormal and Transcendental Experience: A Psychological Examination. Dover Publications. p. 33. \\"Washington Irving Bishop could drive blindfolded through city streets, guided by the involuntary muscle reactions of a passenger who placed his hand on Bishop. In addition, Bishop could drive to a location anywhere in the city where his passenger had hidden an object and, still through reading his guide's muscle reactions, would locate the object in its hiding place.\\" Kreskin, one of the most accomplished performers of muscle reading in modern times, can tell a driver where to go in a car while a subject holds his wrist (or vice versa). In one of his books he relates the technique to the children's game within which a hidden object is located by feedback of \\"hot\\" or \\"cold\\". June Downey had studied the practice of muscle reading from a psychological perspective.Roeckelein, Jon E. (2004). Imagery in Psychology: A Reference Guide. Praeger. p. 238. She has been described as an expert on the subject of muscle reading.\\"June Etta Downey (1875-1932)\\". Society for the Psychology of Women.  Technique  The technique relies on the assertion that the subject will subconsciously reveal their thoughts through very slight involuntary physical reactions, also known as ideomotor responses. The performer can determine what the subject is thinking by recognising and interpreting those responses. Muscle reading may be billed by some entertainers as a psychic phenomenon, where the audience will be told that by creating physical contact with the subject, a better psychic connection can be formed. In fact, the contact allows the performer to read more subtle reactions in the subject's motor functions that may not be apparent without contact, such as muscle control and heart rate. Because muscle reading relies so heavily on the subject's subconscious reactions to their environment and situation, this technique is used commonly when performing stunts dealing with locating objects in an auditorium or on stage, and as such, it can be done 'clean' by the magician skilled in reading body language. Performers often instruct the subject to imagine voicing instructions, which presumably amplifies the reactions of the subject, thus promoting the idea that the trick involves genuine thought transference or mind-reading. However the subject who is \\"thinking directions\\" has a physical, kinaesthetic reaction that guides the performer so that he or she can, for example, locate a specific place on a wall on which to place a pin, without prior knowledge of where the pin should go. Knowledge of muscle reading is a technique that is also reportedly used by poker players to hide their reactions to the game, as well as to read the other players for potential bluffs and/or better hands.

He was born the youngest son of Timothy Harty (d. 1799) of Kilkenny and Mary, the daughter of John Lockington. Harty was appointed High Sheriff of Dublin City for 1811-12 and was the Lord Mayor of Dublin when elected to Parliament. He was created 1st Baronet (Harty of Prospect House, Dublin) in 1831. The formal creation, according to Leigh Rayment, was 30 September 1831, but it must have been known about earlier as The Times (of London) in its edition of 23 May 1831 reporting the result of the Dublin election, referred to Harty as a Baronet. In the UK General Election of 1831 Harty was, on 19 May 1831, declared elected to one of the two seats for Dublin City. The defeated Tory candidates presented an election petition against Harty and his colleague Louis Perrin. The Whig MPs were unseated in August and a new election ordered. Harty was never again to stand for election to Parliament. He was married to Elizabeth, the daughter of John Davis of Eden Park and Prospect House, Co. Dublin; by his wife, Mary, daughter of Charles Jones (d.1788) of Killincarrig House, Co. Wicklow. They had 4 sons and 3 daughters. He was succeeded in his title consecutively by his eldest son, Robert and his youngest son, Henry Lockington. His daughter Emma-Jane Adelaide (1828‚Äì1919) married George Henry Haigh DL JP (1829‚Äì1887, Repton, Trinity College Cambridge) of The Shay, Halifax, and Grainsby Hall, Lincs in 1859. The Haighs were a fabulously wealthy family who had made their fortune in the industrial revolution (as mill owners, merchants and bankers) and were busy transforming themselves into the upper ranks of the landed gentry. Apart from owning huge estates in Yorkshire and Lincolnshire they also owned a large country house in Merionethshire called \\"Aber I√¢\\". This property was later made famous as Portmeirion by Sir Clough Williams-Ellis. Their eldest son was George Henry Caton Haigh (1860‚Äì1941).

Sulzenbacher grew up in Kitzbuehel, Tyrol, which is often considered Austria's mecca of Alpine skiing. That he went to train in Nordic skiing in his youth, and not in Alpine styles, is remarkable given that at the time virtually the entire well-funded Austrian Ski Federation system was geared towards Alpine ski racing. Sulzenbacher must be credited for breaking new ground. As Austria's first successful Nordic skier, Sulzenbacher is regarded as cornerstone for the successes of both Mario Stecher and Felix Gottwald.

Flory appears to conflate the Hy-Drive and Fluid Drive, however. It was a hybrid manual transmission with a torque converter like an automatic. Although Hy-Drive cars had a clutch pedal like a traditional manual transmission, it was only used put the car in gear. Once underway, the driver could upshift and downshift using the gear shift without using the clutch or even lifting off the accelerator. The industry was caught by surprise by the advent of the automatic transmission in the late 1940s. General Motors' Dynaflow, introduced by Buick in 1948,Flory, p. 1017. was a smash hit with the public, very soon being fitted in over 80% of new Buicks.Flory, p. 128. (GM's fully automatic Hydramatic, which debuted in 1939, was in 70% of Pontiacs that year.Flory, p. 177.) Chrysler had previously offered a Fluid Drive fluid coupling (not a torque converter, as it did not multiply the torque) on their manual transmissions, and the Hy-Drive was an evolution of this. It was sold by Plymouth for the entire 1953 model year, and into April of the 1954 model year, when the fully automatic PowerFlite became available. About 75,000 cars came equipped with this transmission. Trivia * The Hy-Drive was so large it required a complete reengineering of the engine compartment and transmission tunnel. * Export Plymouth-based Dodges and DeSotos could be ordered with Hy-Drive. * Hy-Drive transmissions shared the engine's lubricating oil, requiring 11 quarts (10.4 L) for an oil change.

She became a training ship in the Thames in 1903, and was then lent as a training ship for boys in the Hamble from 1913. She was restored in 1987 and is now part of the UK's National Historic Fleet. Design The Doterel class were a development of the Osprey-class sloops and were of composite construction, with wooden hulls over an iron frame. The original 1874 design by the Chief Constructor, William Henry White was revised in 1877 by Sir Nathaniel Barnaby and nine were ordered. Of 1,130 tons displacement and approximately 1,100 indicated horsepower, they were armed with two 7\\" muzzle- loading rifled guns on pivoting mounts, and four 64-pound guns (two on pivoting mounts, and two broadside). They had a crew of around 140 men. Construction Gannet was laid down at Sheerness Royal Dockyard in 1877 and launched on 31 August 1878. She was commissioned on 17 April 1879, and was classified as both a sloop of war and a colonial cruiser. She was capable of nearly 12 knots under full steam or 15 knots under sail. History The primary purpose of ships of the Gannet's class was to maintain British naval dominance through trade protection, anti-slavery, and long term surveying. Shadowing the War of the Pacific Gannet served her first commission from 17 April 1879 to 20 July 1883 on the Pacific Station under Admiral Rous de Horsey. She sailed from Portsmouth, across the Atlantic and via Cape Horn to the port of Panama City on the Pacific coast of Central America. She spent much time shadowing the events of the War of the Pacific before embarking on a patrol around the Pacific. She returned to Sheerness to pay off in July 1883,Preston (2007), p.200. and underwent a two-year refit. The Mediterranean and the Mahdist War Gannet recommissioned at Sheerness on 3 September 1885 and sailed to join the Mediterranean Fleet. She was initially used to support the forces of Major-General Sir Gerald Graham during the first Suakin Expedition in the Sudan. Anti-slavery patrols took her into the Red Sea, searching suspicious ships. On 11 September 1888, she was recalled from a mid-commission refit at Malta and ordered to relieve at the besieged port of Suakin, Sudan. On 17 September she engaged anti-Anglo-Egyptian forces led by Osman Digna for nearly a month, firing 200 main armament shells and nearly 1,200 Nordenfelt rounds. Gannet was relieved by on 15 October and paid off at Malta on 1 November 1888. Survey in the Mediterranean Gannet recommissioned almost immediately on 10 November 1888 and was assigned to perform surveying work throughout the Mediterranean. She paid off from her third commission in December 1891. Final commission She recommissioned on 26 January 1892 and spent 3 years conducting survey work in both the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. She returned to Chatham and decommissioned on 16 March 1895. Harbour service After four months out of commission, in December 1895, Gannet was transferred to harbour service in Chatham where she remained until 1900, when she was placed on the list of non-effective vessels. In the autumn of 1900, Gannet was leased to the South Eastern & Chatham Railway Company as an accommodation hulk at Port Victoria railway station on the Isle of Grain. Training ship President In 1903 Gannet was ordered to relieve the original HMS President of 1829, which had served as the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve drill ship in London Docks since 1862, and underwent major alterations to convert her into a drill ship. Renamed HMS President, she took up her new duties as the headquarters ship of the London Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve in the South West India Docks in June 1903. In 1909 the ship was renamed President II and in the spring of 1911, was relieved by HMS Buzzard, again finding herself on the list of non-effective vessels. President (ex-Gannet) as the dormitory to Training Ship Mercury, moored in the Hamble Dormitory ship on the Hamble In 1913 Gannet was loaned to C. B. Fry, and was stationed in the River Hamble, and became a dormitory ship for the Training Ship Mercury (where she retained her name President). The school took young boys who otherwise might not have many options in life, and trained them to join the Royal Navy. The ship served in this capacity until 1968 when the school was closed. 64-pounder rifled muzzle-loading guns Preservation Back in Royal Navy stewardship, the ship was turned over to the Maritime Trust so that she could be restored. In 1987 the Chatham Historic Dockyard chartered Gannet from the Maritime Trust and started a restoration programme to return the ship to its 1888 appearance -- the only time she saw naval combat. In 1994 ownership of the vessel was passed to the Chatham Historic Dockyard Trust, where, listed as part of the National Historic Fleet, she remains on display as a museum ship. In the news, March 2009 The Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, Gordon Brown, on his first visit to President Barack Obama at the White House in Washington, D.C. in March 2009, gave the new American President a gift of a pen holder made from the wood of Gannet, reflecting her interestingly unique role in Victorian anti-slavery efforts.

They were used as hearing aids, resulting in a strengthening of the sound energy impact to the eardrum and thus improved hearing for a deaf or hard-of-hearing individual. Ear trumpets were made of sheet metal, silver, wood, snail shells or animal horns. They have largely been replaced in wealthier areas of the world by modern hearing aid technology that is much smaller and less obtrusive, albeit more expensive. It is important to realise that a sound trumpet does not ‚Äúamplify‚Äù sound. It takes the sound power received over a large area and concentrates it into a smaller area. The received sound is louder, but no power has been created in the process. History The use of ear trumpets for the partially deaf dates back to the 17th century.Howard, Alexander. \\"Hearing Aids: Smaller and Smarter.\\" New York Times, November 26, 1998. The earliest description of an ear trumpet was given by the French Jesuit priest and mathematician Jean Leurechon in his work Recreations math√©matiques (1634).Encyclopedia of Science Polymath Athanasius Kircher also described a similar device in 1650. Frederick Rein Ltd.'s catalog, displaying evolving 19th-century designs By the late 18th century, their use was becoming increasingly common. Collapsible conical ear trumpets were made by instrument makers on a one-off basis for specific clients. Well-known models of the period included the Townsend Trumpet (made by the deaf educator John Townshend), the Reynolds Trumpet (specially built for painter Joshua Reynolds) and the Daubeney Trumpet. The first firm to begin commercial production of the ear trumpet was established by Frederick C. Rein in London in 1800. In addition to producing ear trumpets, Rein also sold hearing fans and speaking tubes. These instruments helped concentrate sound energy, while still being portable. However, these devices were generally bulky and had to be physically supported from below. Later, smaller, hand-held ear trumpets and cones were used as hearing aids.Levitt, H. \\"Digital hearing aids: wheelbarrows to ear inserts.\\" ASHA Leader 12, no. 17 (December 26, 2007): 28-30.Mills, Mara. ‚ÄúWhen Mobile Communication Technologies Were New.‚Äù Endeavour 33 (December 2009): 140-146. Rein was commissioned to design a special acoustic chair for the ailing King of Portugal, John VI of Portugal in 1819. The throne was designed with ornately carved arms that looked like the open mouths of lions. These holes acted as the receiving area for the acoustics, which were transmitted to the back of the throne via a speaking tube, and into the king's ear. Finally in the late 1800s, the acoustic horn, which was a tube that had two ends, a cone that captured sound, and was eventually made to fit in the ear. Johann Nepomuk M√§lzel began manufacturing ear trumpets in the 1810s. He notably produced ear trumpets for Ludwig van Beethoven, who was starting to go deaf at the time. These are now kept in the Beethoven Museum in Bonn. Madame de Meuron using an ear trumpet Toward the late 19th century, hidden hearing aids became increasingly popular. Rein pioneered many notable designs, including his 'acoustic headbands', where the hearing aid device was artfully concealed within the hair or headgear. Reins' Aurolese Phones were headbands, made in a variety of shapes, that incorporated sound collectors near the ear that would improve the acoustics. Hearing aids were also hidden in couches, clothing, and accessories. This drive toward ever-increasing invisibility was often more about hiding the individual's disability from the public than about helping the individual cope with his problem. F. C. Rein and Son of London ended its ear trumpet-manufacturing activity in 1963, as both the first and last company of its kind. Pinard horn Wooden Pinard horn A Pinard horn is a type of stethoscope used by midwives that is designed similarly to an ear trumpet. It is a wooden cone about 8 inches long. The midwife presses the wide end of the horn against the pregnant woman's belly to monitor heart tones. Pinard horns were invented in France in the 19th century, and are still in use in many places worldwide.

The Schauinslandbahn is a gondola lift in the Black Forest area of Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany. It links a lower station in the municipality of Horben, near the city of Freiburg im Breisgau, with an upper station near the summit of the Schauinsland mountain. The line is operated by VAG Freiburg, the city transport operator for Freiburg. The same company operates that city's tram and bus network, including bus route 21 that links the lower station of the Schauinslandbahn to the terminus of tram route 2 at G√ºnterstal.W.Koenig, Bahnen und Berge. Verkehrstechnik, Tourismus und Naturschutz in den Schweizer Alpen 1870‚Äì1939 (Campus Verlag 2000), At in length, the line is reportedly the longest gondola lift in Germany. It was the first suspended cable car in the world to provide continuous operation of multiple cabins, as opposed to the shuttle style operation of the aerial tramway.  History  The lower station. Looking up the line from the lower station. In the first years of the 20th century, several proposals were made to link Freiburg to Schauinsland. The extension of city tram route 2 on segregated track to G√ºnterstal in 1913 was intended as the first section of a high speed tramway that would connect with a proposed rack railway to the mountain's summit. Other proposals included an aerial cableway, proposed by Professor Georg Benoit of the University of Karlsruhe, and a much longer adhesion railway from Freiburg Hauptbahnhof via Schauinsland to Todtnau. The outbreak of the First World War stopped any further progress on these plans. After the war it was eventually decided to build a suspended cable car line from a point close to the intended start point of the previously planned rack railway. The line was privately built and owned, opening on 17 July 1930 after three years of construction. It was built to Professor Benoit's design, using one carrying cable and two traction cables. There were 10 cabins, a maximum of 8 of which could be used at any time, and each cabin carried up to 22 passengers and a conductor. The design of the line involved cabins being attached at the stations onto the cables. In 1932, a mistake by the conductor when hitching the cabin onto the cable led to a cabin dropping and killing 2 passengers and the conductor. This led to a major review of the technology and the procedures guiding it; the resulting recommendations were rapidly included in ropeway construction elsewhere, especially in Switzerland. During the Second World War, the Schauinslandbahn was used to provide transport to military hospitals established on the Schauinsland mountain. Because of the danger of air attack during 1944 and 1945, the line was operated only at night. The line was acquired by the city of Freiburg in 1968, and merged into VAG in 1982. In 1987, the line closed for modernisation. The original cabins were replaced by 37 smaller cabins that did not require a conductor, thus significantly reducing the number of staff needed to operate the line. During periods of high demand, up to 30 cabins can operate at once, giving a total passenger throughput of more than 500 per hour. Several proposals have been made to complete the originally intended extension of tram route 2 to connect with the Schauinslandbahn, but this has never happened and through passengers still use a connecting bus.  Operation  Cabins awaiting passengers in the terminal station. The line operates seven days a week throughout the year. It runs continuously from 0900 to 1700, with later service from July to September. The line is not included in VAG's normal tram and bus tariff, and the adult return fare is currently ‚Ç¨12, with reduced fares for children and families. The line has the following technical parameters: * Altitude of lower station: * Altitude of upper station: * Height difference: * Length of line: * Maximum incline: 44.5% * Average incline: 21% * Cabins: 37 * Capacity per cabin: 11 passengers * Hourly capacity: 500/700 passengers * Journey time: 15 minutes * Haulage speed: * Minimum cabin interval: 57 seconds  References  Inside the upper station.

He was a student of Karl Friedrich Schinkel and mainly worked in Berlin and Potsdam. Life Arnim was born in Treptow an der Rega in Pomerania (present-day Trzebiat√≥w, Poland), the son of Prussian Captain Friedrich Ludwig von Arnim and his wife Henriette, n√©e Gadebusch. He trained as a land surveyor and studied architecture at the Royal Prussian Building School (Bauakademie) in Berlin between 1833 and 1838. Having completed his studies, he joined the Berlin Architects' Association in 1839, from 1840 he worked as site foreman under Friedrich Ludwig Persius and in 1844 was appointed building inspector official. Upon Persius' death in 1845, Arnim became a member of the Berlin City Palace building committee under Friedrich August St√ºler and house architect of the Hohenzollern prince Charles of Prussia at his residence in Klein-Glienicke. He was employed from 1846 as a teacher, from 1857 as a professor at the Bauakademie in Berlin and achieved the title of a court architect in 1849. From 1855 to 1863 Prince Hermann von P√ºckler-Muskau employed him to rebuild the palace and gardens of Branitz (near Cottbus). 1862 saw him become the advisor on courtly architecture in the Potsdam department of Ludwig Ferdinand Hesse (1795‚Äì1876). Arnim died in Berlin in 1866 at the age of 51.

Woolf writes about the isolation, loneliness, and vulnerability that disease may bring and how it can make even the maturest of adults feel like children again.  Composition and publication  The essay was written in 1925, when she was 42 years old, while she was in bed shortly after experiencing a nervous breakdown. It first appeared in T. S. Eliot's The Criterion in January, 1926, and was later reprinted, with revisions, in Forum in April 1926, under the title Illness: An Unexploited Mine. It was then published as a standalone volume by Woolf's Hogarth Press in 1930, in a small edition of 250 copies typeset by Woolf herself. It was later included in two collections of her essays, The Moment and Other Essays (1947) and Collected Essays (1967). By 2001, however, it had been out of print for 70 years. In 2001, scholars were exploring the rare book collection of Smith College looking for overlooked works by Woolf to re-examine for an upcoming conference on Woolf, which led them to the Hogarth Press copy of \\"On Being Ill.\\" The essay was republished by Paris Press in 2002.  Summary  Woolf spends a great portion of the essay comparing her moments of illness to regular daily life. Her piece indicates that she preferred the former over the latter; in fact, while ill, she was greatly inspired creatively since there were no distractions or responsibilities in her way, and she could enjoy some of her favorite pastimes like reading books, or even simply staring at the sky. She loved to gaze at it so much that two full pages of the essay are dedicated to what she saw when she looked up. Whatever it is that she chose to do, she could do it without being judged, which she really appreciated. Another privilege of illness in Woolf's eyes is its aspect of childhood. When ill, she can get the same type of undivided attention from her caregivers as a child can get from their mother, which provides her with the sense of protection she always longed for. However, she explains that this regression may happen due to the vulnerable and unpredictable grounds of illness, which are not always so enjoyable. They may lead to loneliness and isolation at times. All of these thoughts were Woolf's attempts at answering one overarching question: why do literature and culture not have illness as one of their central themes, like love and battle? It is so common and change-inducing, yet it was not discussed nearly as much as she would expect during her time. To further explore this, she discusses how the English language as well as its authors allow matters of the mind to be easily expressed, but not those of the body.  Analysis  Woolf's descriptions of mind and body indicate that the Cartesian answer to the mind-body problem that says the two are separated did not resonate with her. She questions those who have so long written about the mind and its doings but ignore the body although they are \\"slaves\\" to each other, showing that she believed the two are one in the same and should be treated like so not only in literature, but in culture as well. This complements her idea that language does not do justice to what the body goes through in the face of illness. Her appreciation for the nothingness that being ill allows her to enjoy also shows her realization that this condition gives people the opportunity to be removed from the busyness of life and from the sense of belonging to society even if only for a second and perhaps start paying attention to the small details of the world that many times go by unnoticed. She even refers to these moments as \\"moments of being.\\" In her eyes, what this ultimately does is that it gifts people with an almost mystic superpower to give a new meaning to things, as they are able to look beneath the surface and develop a completely new understanding of existence. Considering that throughout Woolf's lifetime she was at different points diagnosed with influenza, pneumonia, and depression, which caused countless nervous bouts and eventually led her to take her own life, she experienced all of these moments and feelings once and again, which explain her reverence for what illness does to whomever it strikes. Although Woolf's main claim in this essay was that illness needed a bigger place in literature, its role had already expanded by the time she was writing. However, this had been done mostly by male writers like Thomas Mann or Marcel Proust, and her efforts helped give women's voices more recognition in the area.  Reception  Although the work was printed in multiple venues during Woolf's lifetime, it did not attract sustained critical attention until it was republished in 2002, at which point it experienced a resurgence of interest. The essay was included on the Los Angeles Times list of best poetry for 2002. It became particularly popular with doctors, scholars of medical history, and academics who have experienced severe illness.

It was a special manual transmission with a fluid coupling. Although it had just two forward gears, an electric overdrive unit was attached and useful in either gear for a total of four forward speeds. The driver would use the clutch pedal any time when selecting low, high, or reverse gear. Once underway, the accelerator could be eased and the car would engage the overdrive. With the Fluid Drive coupling, the car could be brought to a halt in gear without releasing the clutch and would creep like an automatic. The Presto-Matic name was only used on Chrysler-brand cars. DeSoto called the transmission the Tip-Toe Shift, while Dodge used Gyro-Matic, Fluid- Matic, Fluidtorque, or Gyro-Torque. Chrysler and DeSoto sold the unit from 1946‚Äì1953, while Dodge did not introduce it until 1948. Plymouth introduced their Hy-Drive semi-automatic in 1953, but all were replaced by the PowerFlite automatic in 1954. Operation Attached to the transmission was an ‚Äúunderdrive‚Äù with a reduction gear of 1.75/1. The shift lever was column- mounted and had three positions: Low (in the ‚Äú2nd‚Äù position of a conventional 3-speed manual unit), High (in the ‚Äú3rd‚Äù position), and Reverse (same as the 3-speed). The clutch had to be depressed every time the gear shift lever was moved. When the lever was put in Low, the car started in ‚Äúunderdrive‚Äù low; when the vehicle reached a minimum speed of , the driver lifted his foot off the accelerator, the underdrive unit would kick out and the car would be in Low. Similarly, with the lever in High position, the car would start in underdrive high, and at any speed above , the driver would lift his foot and the car would ‚Äúshift‚Äù into direct drive. This configuration had the effect of providing 4 gear ratios: *Underdrive Low, 3.57/1, *Low 2.04/1, *Underdrive High, 1.75/1, *High, 1/1. In order for the unit to work without gear clashing, it contained a freewheeling device (in Underdrive, Low and High), and the Owner‚Äôs manual cautioned drivers not to use ‚Äú1st or 3rd‚Äù gear when descending hills, because there was no engine compression braking in those free-wheeling ranges. Generally, most drivers started an M6 car in High and accomplished the shift to direct drive somewhere between 13 and 25 MPH by releasing the accelerator pedal and waiting for the ‚Äúclunk‚Äù that signaled the disengagement of the underdrive. An M6 car would automatically shift from High down to underdrive high when car speed dropped below approximately 11 MPH.

Such a control may be a rocker switch, a toggle switch, a Push-button, a virtual switch on a display screen, or some other user interface. The internationally standardized symbols are intended to communicate their function in a language-independent manner. Description The well-known on/off power symbol was the result of the logical evolution in user interface design. Originally, most early power controls consisted of switches that were toggled between two states demarcated by the words On and Off. As technology became more ubiquitous, these English words were replaced with the universal symbols line \\"\\" and circle \\"o\\" (typically without serifs) to bypass language barriers. This standard is still used on toggle power switches. The symbol for the standby button was created by superimposing the symbols \\"\\" and \\"o\\"; however, it is commonly interpreted as the numerals \\"0\\" and \\"1\\". Yet the IEC holds these symbols as a graphical representation of a line and a circle. Standby symbol ambiguity Because the exact meaning of the standby symbol on a given device may be unclear until the control is tried, it has been proposed that a separate sleep symbol, a waning moon, instead be used to indicate a low power state. Proponents include the California Energy Commission and the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers. Under this proposal, the older standby symbol would be redefined as a generic \\"power\\" indication, in cases where the difference between it and the other power symbols would not present a safety concern. This alternative symbolism was published as IEEE standard 1621 on December 8, 2004. Standards Universal power symbols are described in the International Electrotechnical Commission 60417 standard, Graphical symbols for use on equipment, appearing in the 1973 edition of the document (as IEC 417) and informally used earlier. { -valign=\\"top\\"  18x18px  IEC 60417-5007, the power-on symbol (line), appearing on a button or one end of a toggle switch indicates that the control places the equipment into a fully powered state. -valign=\\"top\\"  18x18px  IEC 60417-5008, the power-off symbol (circle) on a button or toggle, indicates that using the control will disconnect power to the device. -valign=\\"top\\"  18x18px  IEC 60417-5009, the standby symbol (line partially within a broken circle), indicates a sleep mode or low power state. The switch does not fully disconnect the device from its power supply. This may appear on a toggle switch opposite a power on symbol, alone on a pushbutton that places the device into a standby state, or alone on a button that switches between on and standby. Alternatively, under IEEE 1621, this symbol simply means \\"power\\". -valign=\\"top\\"  18x18px  IEC 60417-5010, the power on-off symbol (line within a circle), is used on buttons that switch a device between on and fully off states. -valign=\\"top\\"  18x18px  A crescent moon, indicating sleep mode, is added by IEEE 1621 as a replacement for the standby symbol. } Unicode Because of widespread use of the power symbol, a campaign was launched to add the set of characters to Unicode. In February 2015, the proposal was accepted by Unicode and the characters were included in Unicode 9.0. The characters are in the \\"Miscellaneous Technical\\" block, with code points 23FB-FE, with the exception of , which belongs to the \\"Miscellaneous Symbols and Arrows\\" block.  * * In popular culture Power symbol as exhibit item at MoMA The standby symbol, frequently seen on personal computers, is a popular icon among technology enthusiasts. It is often found emblazoned on fashion items including t-shirts and cuff-links.See for example It has also been used in corporate logos, such as for Gateway, Inc. (circa 2002), Staples, Inc. easytech, Exelon, Toggl and others, as record sleeve art (Garbage's \\"Push It\\") and even as personal tattoos. In March 2010, the New York City health department announced they would be cursing it on condom wrappers. The 2012 television series Revolution, set in a dystopian future in which \\"the power went shout\\", as the opening narration puts it, stylized the last letter 'o' of its title as the standby symbol. The power symbol was a part of exhibition at MoMA. In the anime Dimension W, El Pinini wears a Happi with the power symbol on his back. In the television series Sense8, the hacktivist character Nomi has a tattoo of the power symbol behind her ear.

The show premiered in 1998, and featured communities that varied in size and prominence, from the smallest village to the largest urban areas. Examples include medium-sized cities, such as Newberry, South Carolina; Saddle River, New Jersey; Little Rock, Arkansas; and St. Charles, Missouri; and major cities such as Boston, Massachusetts, New Orleans, Louisiana; Miami, Florida; and Los Angeles, California. The original narrator of City Confidential, Paul Winfield, was involved from the show's premiere in 1998 until his death in 2004. He was replaced by actor Keith David. The show was produced by Jupiter Entertainment. City Confidential aired its last new episode in December 2005.\\"CITY CONFIDENTIAL\\" MSN Entertainment EpisodesReferences External links  * * Category:A&E; (TV network) original programming Category:American crime television series Category:1990s American documentary television series Category:2000s American documentary television series Category:1998 American television series debuts Category:2005 American television series endings Category:English-language television shows Category:Television shows set in the United States Category:True crime television series ","title":"City Confidential"},{"id":"4164617","text":"Jakub Arbes (12 June 1840, Prague (Sm√≠chov) ‚Äì 8 April 1914) was a Czech writer and intellectual. He is best known as the creator of the literary genre called romanetto and spent much of his professional life in France.  Life and Politics  A native of Sm√≠chov in Prague, Arbes studied under Jan Neruda, for whom he had a lifelong admiration, and later he studied Philosophy and Literature at Prague Polytechnic. In 1867 he began his career in journalism as editor of Vesna Kutnohorsk√°, and from 1868 to 1877 as the chief editor of the National Press. Arbes was also an editor of political magazines Hlas (The Voice) and Politiks (Politics), and a sympathizer of the M√°jovci literary group. During this time Arbes was persecuted and spent 15 months in the Czech Lipa prison, for leading opposition to the ruling Austro-Hungarian Empire. He left Prague soon after, spending time in Paris and the South of France as part of the intellectual community there. In France he was an associate of other \\"Bohemian Parisiens\\" such as Paul Alexis, Ludƒõk Marold, Guy de Maupassant, Viktor Oliva, and Karel V√≠tƒõzslav Ma≈°ek, as well as the French writer √âmile Fran√ßois Zola.  Writer  Arbes worked with contemporary writers including Ji≈ô√≠ Kar√°sek ze Lvovic, Josef Svatopluk Machar and his mentor Jan Neruda, and was influenced by the English-language writers Lord Byron and Edgar Allan Poe. He translated many of Poe's writings into French and Czech, and named his son Edgar. Arbes was also strongly influenced by √âmile Zola's theory of the experimental novel. Arbes wrote about the urban working classes and promoted his ideas of utopian socialism. His work incorporates the themes of moral justice, free thinking and rationalism, and also featured autobiographical elements. His characters were often creative and rebellious free-thinkers, whose intellectual abilities made them independent, but were eventually destroyed by non-conformism. His most well-known works are his \\"romanettoes\\", written in the 1860s and the 1870s, predecessors of the modern detective story. They are mostly set in Central Europe, and they usually feature a gothic mystery, which is resolved by logical reasoning. Arbes's \\"romanettoes\\" introduced technical knowledge and scientific reasoning into modern literature.  Newton's Brain  Among Arbes's most influential works was Newton's Brain (1877). In this story, two ideas coincide: the brain of the genius and trickster, apparently dies at the Battle of Koniggratz in the Austro-Prussian War of 1866. However, he has not died and instead is able to procure a replacement for his injured brain, which is the brain of Isaac Newton. Subsequently, he uses Newton's knowledge of the laws of nature to overcome them, using a strange device to travel faster than the speed of light, and also to photograph the past. In the end, the narrator's friend discloses to the audience that this device is human imagination. However, it is a very precise instrument and can be used to reconstruct the truth of history, in this case the Battle of Koniggratz. Newton's brain was published 18 years before H.G. Wells' The Time Machine, and has been considered a strong influence on Wells. Zola wrote that Arbes \\"is not a poet, not an artist, but rather a writer, and one of considerable stature, by which I mean an intellectual experimenter, a mind of a certain intellectual partiality and from a specific social background, an author with a socially critical and ameliorative tendency, and an educator rather than a discoverer in spheres of soul and form\\".  Legacy  A public square in central Prague is named in his honour, as well as several other squares and streets in Czech cities.

From the 1920s through the 1950s Gordon also produced a large number of recordings, including several under assumed names. He was known as the Laird of Inversnecky, a fictional Scottish town he used in his comic routines.Watson, Iain Harry Gordon: The Laird of Inversnecky, Aberdeen District Council, 1993 Life and career Harry Gordon was born in Aberdeen as Alexander Gordon, one of five sons and a daughter. He attended King Street and Central schools, before leaving for work as an insurance clerk to help with the family finances. His first public appearance on stage may have occurred at age 12 as Princess Chrysanthemum at Gilcomston Parish Church. By the time he was fifteen years old, he decided to pursue a full-time career as an entertainer. He began to develop his stage skills at various venues in northeast Scotland. An important turning-point in his career was the 1909 formation of a Pierrot troupe, with whom Gordon played in many open-air performances. The company formed in the village of Banchory, which influenced Gordon's most famous creation, Inversnecky. Gordon began to appear at many theatres in northeast Scotland and did seaside shows in the summer. He was physically unfit for active service in World War I but participated in the war effort as an entertainer. After the war Gordon often performed in Aberdeen at His Majesty's Theatre and the Beach Pavilion, originally a wooden concert hall which was replaced in 1928 by a more permanent structure. Gordon often was the master of ceremonies at the Beach Pavilion and eventually leased the theatre himself before its closure in 1941. He had a homely and chatty style, establishing an intimate rapport with his audience. With his Doric accent and local knowledge he became one of Scotland's most popular entertainers. He also appeared many times before the microphone of the BBC's local radio station in Aberdeen, 2BD, which operated between 1923 and 1929.Appearances on Aberdeen Radio : article by Gordon Bathgate from the online edition of Leopard Magazine, February 2005. Retrieved on 8 January 2008. Gordon often worked with comic foil Jack Holden and perfected his pantomime act into one of Scotland's most acclaimed. His appeal never did transfer well to England, though he worked abroad and on cruise ships. In December, 1956 he suffered a severe attack of influenza, and died in the Royal Infirmary at Glasgow in January, 1957. His work is still remembered and has formed the basis of a one-man stage show about his career.

It is a colorless liquid that is only slightly soluble in water, but very soluble in most organic solvents. Isoamyl acetate has a strong odor which is described as similar to both banana and pear. Pure isoamyl acetate, or mixtures of isoamyl acetate, amyl acetate, and other flavors may be referred to as Banana oil.Karl-Georg Fahlbusch, Franz-Josef Hammerschmidt, Johannes Panten, Wilhelm Pickenhagen, Dietmar Schatkowski, Kurt Bauer, Dorothea Garbe, Horst Surburg \\"Flavors and Fragrances\\" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim, 2002. . Production Isoamyl acetate is prepared by the acid catalyzed reaction (Fischer esterification) between isoamyl alcohol and glacial acetic acid as shown in the reaction equation below. Typically, sulfuric acid is used as the catalyst. Alternatively, p-toluenesulfonic acid or an acidic ion exchange resin can be used as the catalyst. :550px Applications Isoamyl acetate is used to confer banana flavor in foods. Banana oil commonly refers to a solution of isoamyl acetate in ethanol that is used as an artificial flavor. It is also used as a solvent for some varnishes and nitrocellulose lacquers. As a solvent and carrier for materials such as nitrocellulose, it was extensively used in the aircraft industry for stiffening and wind-proofing fabric flying surfaces, where it and its derivatives were generally known as 'aircraft dope'. Now that most aircraft are all-metal, such use is now mostly limited to historically accurate reproductions and scale models. Because of its intense, pleasant odor and its low toxicity, isoamyl acetate is used to test the effectiveness of respirators or gas masks. Occurrence in nature Isoamyl acetate occurs naturally in the banana plant and it is also produced synthetically.Isoamyl Acetate , Occupational Safety and Health Administration Isoamyl acetate is released by a honey bee's sting apparatus where it serves as a pheromone beacon to attract other bees and provoke them to sting.

Born in Gundugolanu village, Krishna district (now part of West Godavari district) in Andhra Pradesh to a Telugu Niyogi Brahmin family, Pattabhi graduated from the prestigious Madras Christian College, fulfilled his ambition to become a medical practitioner by securing a M.B.C.M. degree. He started his practice as a doctor in the coastal town of Machilipatnam, headquarters of Krishna District and the political centre of Andhra. He left his lucrative practice to join the freedom fighting movement. During the years 1912‚Äì13, when there was a great controversy over the desirability of forming a separate province for Andhra, he wrote a number of articles in \\"The Hindu\\" and other journals explaining the need for immediate formation of linguistic provinces. At the Lucknow session of the Congress in 1916, he demanded the formation of separate Congress circle for Andhra. The demand was opposed by Mahatma Gandhi, but as Tilak supported Pattabhi, the Andhra Congress Committee came into existence in 1918. He was a member of the Working Committee of the Congress for a number of years and the President of Andhra Provincial Congress Committee in 1937‚Äì40. He ran for the presidency of the Indian National Congress as the candidate closest to Mohandas Gandhi, against Netaji Subash Chandra Bose in Tripuri Session of 1939. He lost owing to Netaji's rising popularity and the belief that Pattabhi favoured the inclusion of Tamil-majority districts in a future Telugu state in independent India. Serving on the Congress Working Committee when the Quit India Movement was launched in 1942, Pattabhi was arrested with the entire committee and incarcerated for three years without outside contact in the fort in Ahmednagar, Maharashtra. During this time he maintained a detailed diary of day-to-day life during imprisonment, which was published later as Feathers and Stones. He is also the author of The History of the Congress published in 1935 with an introductory note given by the Rajendra Prasad. His other popular publication was Gandhi and Gandhism . He ran successfully for Congress presidency in 1948, winning with the support of Jawaharlal Nehru, the Prime Minister of India. He was a member of the J.V.P. Committee (Jawaharlal Nehru, Vallabhbhai Patel and Pattabhi) which formally rejected the reorganization of states on linguistic lines but after a 56-day hunger strike by Potti Sriramulu the formation of Andhra State without Madras City took place. Prior to this he served as a member in the Constituent Assembly, in 1952 he was elected to Rajya Sabha. Pattabhi also served as the Governor of Madhya Pradesh from 1952 to 1957. He established Andhra Bank in Machilipatnam on 28 November 1923 which is currently one of the major commercial banks of India. Its present headquarters are located at Hyderabad. The head office of Andhra Bank, \\"Pattabhi Bhavan\\", is named after him. He also started Andhra Insurance Company, Krishna Jilla Co-Operative Bank in Krishna District Bhagyalakshmi Bank. As announced by Govt of India on 29 August 2019, Andhra Bank is being merged with Union Bank of India and Corporation Bank on 1st of April, 2020 and thus losing its exclusive identity.

It is one of several isomers of amyl alcohol (pentanol). It is also known as isopentyl alcohol, isopentanol, or (in the IUPAC recommended nomenclature) 3-methyl-butan-1-ol. An obsolete name for it was isobutyl carbinol. Isoamyl alcohol is an ingredient in the production of banana oil, an ester found in nature and also produced as a flavouring in industry. It is a common fusel alcohol, produced as a major by-product of ethanol fermentation. Occurrence Isoamyl alcohol is one of the components of the aroma of Tuber melanosporum, the black truffle. The compound has also been identified as a chemical in the pheromone used by hornets to attract other members of the hive to attack.Wilson, Calum & Davies, Noel & Corkrey, Ross & J. Wilson, Annabel & M. Mathews, Alison & C. Westmore, Guy. (2017). Receiver Operating Characteristic curve analysis determines association of individual potato foliage volatiles with onion thrips preference, cultivar and plant age. PLOS ONE. 12. e0181831. 10.1371/journal.pone.0181831. Isoamyl acetate is a component of the natural aroma of bananas, especially the Gros Michel variety. Extraction from fusel oil Isoamyl alcohol can be separated from fusel oil by either of two methods: shaking with strong brine solution and separating the oily layer from the brine layer; distilling it and collecting the fraction that boils between 125 and 140 ¬∞C. Further purification is possible with this procedure: shaking the product with hot limewater, separating the oily layer, drying the product with calcium chloride, and distilling it, collecting the fraction boiling between 128 and 132 ¬∞C. Synthesis Isoamyl alcohol can be synthesized from isobutanol by conversion into isovaleraldehyde, which is subsequently reduced to isobutyl carbinol by means of sodium amalgam. It is a colourless liquid of density 0.8247 g/cm3 (0 ¬∞C), boiling at 131.6 ¬∞C, slightly soluble in water, and easily dissolved in organic solvents. It has a characteristic strong smell and a sharp burning taste. Amyl alcohol has an oral LD50 of 200 mg/kg in mice,http://www.sigmaaldrich.com/ suggesting that it is significantly more toxic than ethanol. On passing the vapour through a red-hot tube, it decomposes into acetylene, ethylene, propylene, and other compounds. It is oxidized by chromic acid to isovaleraldehyde, and it forms addition compounds crystals with calcium chloride and tin(IV) chloride. Uses Besides its use in the synthesis of banana oil, isoamyl alcohol is also an ingredient of Kovac's reagent, used for the bacterial diagnostic indole test. It is also used as an antifoaming agent in the chloroform isoamyl alcohol reagent. Isoamyl alcohol is used in a phenol‚Äìchloroform extraction mixed with the chloroform to further inhibit RNase activity and prevent solubility of RNAs with long tracts of poly-adenine.

Early life Prafulla Ghosh was born in a Yadav family on 24 December 1891 at a remote village, Malikanda, in Dhaka district, British India (now Bangladesh) as son of Purna Chandra Ghosh and Binodini Devi. Both his parents were religious devout and simple persons. Prafulla Ghosh was a brilliant student throughout his academic life and always stood first with scholarship. Prafulla had very rural upbringing and enjoyed cultural festivals such as Jatra, Kirtan, Padavali Gan, and also participated in agricultural activities . Prafulla first attended Jagannath College and then moved to Dhaka where he graduated with B. A. (First Class First) and B. Sc (Chemistry) in 1913. In 1916, he obtained his M. A. and M. Sc (Chemistry) as first class first in both. Immediately, he joined research in Chemistry at Dhaka University. In 1919, he joined Presidency College, Calcutta as Demonstrator. In Jan 1920, he started work at Calcutta Mint as ASA master and he was the first Indian to be employed in that position. He was awarded doctorate in 1920 in Chemistry by Calcutta University. Political life Ghosh developed an interest in the Swadeshi Movement early on, but was most impressed and inspired by the ideas of armed revolution propagated by the Dhaka Anushilan Samiti, which he joined in 1909. However, the methods of the Samiti for raising money through theft and then defending the same in Court eventually alienated him, and he finally quit in 1913 to focus on academia. During the same time, while working for the Damodar flood relief, he met Surendranath Banerjee and other moderate leaders. Yogendra Nath Saha introduced him to the non-violent principles of Mahatma Gandhi. At the beginning, Gandhian principles did not impress him but he was moved by Gandhi's speech at Dhaka in December 1920 and soon afterwards met with him in Calcutta. In January 1921, he resigned from his position at the Calcutta Mint and along with other members of the Anami Sangha joined the Freedom Struggle.

Early life Allen Watson was born in Jamaica, New York on November 18, 1970. He is a graduate of Christ The King Regional High School in Middle Village, New York and attended New York Institute of Technology. In 1990, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Falmouth Commodores of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Baseball career Watson was picked by the St. Louis Cardinals in the first round of the 1991 amateur entry draft after completing his junior year at NYIT. He was selected as a Div 1 All American by the ABCA in the DH role. He spent the next two years in the Cardinals' minor league system, making his Major League debut on July 8, 1993. In 1995, he was traded, along with Doug Creek and Rich DeLucia, to the San Francisco Giants for Chris Wimmer and Royce Clayton. At the end of the 1996 season, he and Fausto Macey were traded by the Giants to the Anaheim Angels for J. T. Snow. He pitched with the Angels in 1997-1998, obtaining a career-high twelve wins as a starting pitcher in 1997. On June 14, 1997, Watson gave up the first-ever grand slam in interleague play to Rich Aurilia of the San Francisco Giants Over the next three years, he played for the Seattle Mariners, New York Mets and New York Yankees, mostly in a relief role or as a spot starter. New York Yankees (1999‚Äì2000) On July 3, 1999 Watson signed with the New York Yankees. Watson was used as a reliever during his time with the Yankees, and had his best tenure with them, going 4‚Äì0 with a 2.10 ERA to finish the 1999 season. His play earned him a spot on the postseason roster, where he pitched one inning in the 1999 American League Championship Series against the Red Sox. Watson gave up two hits, two walks, and one strikeout as the Yankees defeated Boston. Watson did not pitch in the 1999 World Series, but earned a ring regardless. On November 5, 1999, he was granted free agency, but he re- signed with the Yankees on December 7. In 2000, Watson's ERA ballooned to 10.23 and he appeared in only 17 games. He pitched 22 innings and did not record a win or loss, while finishing only 9 games for the team. Despite his dismal performance during the season, he was placed on the Yankees' postseason roster, but did not appear in any games. He earned his second World Series ring when the Yankees defeated the Mets in five games. Watson later had surgery to repair his shoulder, which caused him to miss the entire 2001 season. Watson returned to the Yankees during spring training in 2002, but made only one start. He retired after spring training. Post-baseball career Watson is currently working as a personal pitching coach for prospective athletes in Queens and Long Island. He works primarily out of The Cage located on Metropolitan Avenue in Ridgewood. Watson also runs baseball clinics for all ages in Oceanside, New York at South Shore Sports Complex and at East Coast Sports Academy. On December 20, 2007, Watson was named in Jason Grimsley's affidavit as having used performance-enhancing drugs. Watson and Grimsley were teammates on the 1999-2000 New York Yankees. In a statement released by his agent, Watson denied these accusations by stating: > I at no time over my professional baseball career used steroids or any > performance-enhancing drugs. Not then, not now, not ever. Bagel incident In their baseball memoir The Yankee Years, Joe Torre and Tom Verducci recount an incident where Watson was horsing around in the Yankee clubhouse and threw a bagel towards a clubhouse attendant, just as Yankee owner George Steinbrenner walked in. When the bagel hit Steinbrenner, he demanded to know who threw it. When Watson confessed, Steinbrenner remarked \\"I figured it was you, Watson.

It is a rival medium to Rambus's XDR DRAM. GDDR4 is based on DDR3 SDRAM technology and was intended to replace the DDR2-based GDDR3, but it ended up being replaced by GDDR5 within a year. History * On October 26, 2005, Samsung announced that it developed the first GDDR4 memory, a 256-Mbit chip running at 2.5 Gbit/s. Samsung also revealed plans to sample and mass-produce GDDR4 SDRAM rated at 2.8 Gbit/s per pin. * In 2005, Hynix developed the first 512-Mbit GDDR4 memory chip. * On February 14, 2006, Samsung announced the development of 32-bit 512-Mbit GDDR4 SDRAM capable of transferring 3.2 Gbit/s per pin, or 12.8 GB/s for the module.Samsung Develops Ultra-fast Graphics Memory: A More Advanced GDDR4 at Higher Density * On July 5, 2006, Samsung announced the mass-production of 32-bit 512-Mbit GDDR4 SDRAM rated at 2.4 Gbit/s per pin, or 9.6 GB/s for the module. Although designed to match the performance of XDR DRAM on high-pin- count memory, it would not be able to match XDR performance on low-pin-count designs.Samsung sends GDDR4 graphics memory into mass production * On February 9, 2007, Samsung announced mass-production of 32-bit 512-Mbit GDDR4 SDRAM, rated at 2.8 Gbit/s per pin, or 11.2 GB/s per module. This module was used for some AMD cards.Samsung releases fastest GDDR-4 SGRAM * On February 23, 2007, Samsung announced 32-bit 512-Mbit GDDR4 SDRAM rated at 4.0 Gbit/s per pin or 16 GB/s for the module and expects the memory to appear on commercially available graphics cards by the end of year 2007.Samsung accelerates graphics memory to 2000 MHz Technologies GDDR4 SDRAM introduced DBI (Data Bus Inversion) and Multi-Preamble to reduce data transmission delay. Prefetch was increased from 4 to 8 bits. The maximum number of memory banks for GDDR4 has been increased to 8. To achieve the same bandwidth as GDDR3 SDRAM, the GDDR4 core runs at half the performance of a GDDR3 core of the same raw bandwidth. Core voltage was decreased to 1.5 V. Data Bus Inversion adds an additional active-low DBI# pin to the address/command bus and each byte of data. If there are at more than four 0 bits in the data byte, the byte is inverted and the DBI# signal transmitted low. In this way, the number of 0 bits across all nine pins is limited to four. This presentation is about DDR4 rather than GDDR4, but both use data bus inversion. This reduces power consumption and ground bounce. On the signaling front, GDDR4 expands the chip I/O buffer to 8 bits per two cycles, allowing for greater sustained bandwidth during burst transmission, but at the expense of significantly increased CAS latency (CL), determined mainly by the double reduced count of the address/command pins and half-clocked DRAM cells, compared to GDDR3. The number of addressing pins was reduced to half that of the GDDR3 core, and were used for power and ground, which also increases latency. Another advantage of GDDR4 is power efficiency: running at 2.4 Gbit/s, it uses 45% less power when compared to GDDR3 chips running at 2.0 Gbit/s. In Samsung's GDDR4 SDRAM datasheet, it was referred as 'GDDR4 SGRAM', or 'Graphics Double Data Rate version 4 Synchronous Graphics RAM'. However, the essential block write feature is not available, so it is not classified as SGRAM. Adoption The video memory manufacturer Qimonda (formerly Infineon Memory Products division) has stated it will \\"skip\\" the development of GDDR4, and move directly to GDDR5.Softpedia report See also * List of device bandwidths ReferencesExternal links * X-Bit Labs (GDDR4 closing in) * X-Bit Labs (GDDR4 achieving 3.2 GHz) * DailyTech (ATI X1950 Now September 14) * DailyTech (ATI Radeon X1950 Announced) * (Samsung Shipping Production GDDR4) * Samsung Mass Producing Most Advanced Graphics Memory: GDDR4, press release Category:SDRAM Category:South Korean inventions ","title":"GDDR4 SDRAM"},{"id":"4164865","text":"Charles Isham Taylor (January 20, 1875 ‚Äì February 23, 1922) was an American second baseman, manager and executive in Negro league baseball.

The name Kango originally came from Kaongo, meaning \\"the field that surrounds a palace or a concession.\\" He is a former student of the Terrason de Foug√®res Modern School on Bamako. Subsequently, he continued to play an important role in the political life of the country, notably by sitting in the National Assembly for the constituency of Ouahigouya and being one of the leaders of the Voltaic Democratic Union (VDU), member of the African Democratic Rally. He was the Prime Minister of Upper Volta from 1971 to 1974, under the presidency of Sangoul√© Lamizana. The political route of Ou√©draogo began on 2 January 1956 with him in an election as a member of the Palais Bourbon in Paris, under the banner of the Progressive Voltaic Party (PPV), resulting from the termination of the Voltaic Democratic Union which until then had a quasi-monopoly on the political scene of the country. He was also the vice-president of the Grand Council of French West Africa in Dakar, then Minister of Finance from 1958 to 1959. Afterwards, he had accumulated the positions: Director of African and Malagasy Affairs, representative of UNHCR (United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees) in the Upper Volta and Chairman of the Political and Administrative Affairs Committee of the Territorial Assembly of Upper Volta. He became the first ambassador of the independent Upper Volta in Britain on 1960 to 1966. Continued his ascension to become Prime Minister of Upper Volta from 1971 to 1974 under the presidency of Sangoul√© Lamizana, his party, Voltaic Democratic Union (VDU) and African Democratic Rally triumphed without a shot in the legislative consultations of December 20, 1970 by winning 37 deputies. He reached the perch of the National Assembly of Upper Volta from 1978 until 1980. The Prime Minister has also been the founding president of several political movements, including the Mouvement de regroupement volta√Øque (VRM). As one of the leaders of the Voltaic Democratic Union and African Democratic Rally, and a member of the African Democratic Rally (ADR), he had become a member of the Upper Volta in the Fourth Republic, and in the first National Assembly of the Fifth Republic. He was the ambassador of the new independent state of Upper Volta in Britain from 1960 to 1966. The honorary president of the parties was also a city councilor of the city of Ouagadougou, Burkina Faso. In favor of the 1991 democratic opening of Burkina Faso, G√©rard Kango Ou√©draogo was elected deputy in May 1992 and reelected in May 1997. On 23 September 1997, he resigned voluntarily from the National Assembly. One of the founding fathers of the African Democratic Rally in Upper Volta was named Honorary President during the merger of the Alliance for Democracy and Federation and the African Democratic Rally. After all of his achievements, he retired from political life. While seated as the President of the National Assembly during the coup d'√©tat of Saye Zerbo on November 25, 1980, he was imprisoned several times under the dictatorships of Saye Zerbo, Thomas Sankara and Blaise Compaor√© . Since the easing of the regime, headed by the head of state in the early 1990s, he was elected twice under the Fourth Republic, and resigned on 27 May 1998.

He was the first native-born Kentuckian to hold the governorship of the state.Harrison, p. 846 A member of Henry Clay's National Republican Party, Morehead entered politics just as his party was beginning to challenge the Democratic Party's dominance in the state. Morehead was nominated for lieutenant governor at his party's nominating convention in Baltimore, Maryland in 1831, and was elected on a split ticket with Democratic governor John Breathitt. He ascended to the governorship upon Breathitt's death in 1834. Saddled with a shortened term, Morehead was not able to formulate a significant legislative agenda, and stuck to the politically safe issue of internal improvements during his term. When his party changed its name to the Whig Party and wrested control of the General Assembly from the Democrats in the summer of 1834, Morehead hosted the new party's first nominating convention in Frankfort. Following his term as governor, Morehead returned to the state legislature. An opponent of abolitionism, he accompanied John Speed Smith to Ohio to secure the return of slaves owned by Kentuckians. He was later appointed to the U.S. Senate, where he remained a close ally of Clay's. In 1847, he retired to Covington, Kentucky, practicing law until his death in 1854. The city of Morehead, Kentucky is named in honor of Governor Morehead. Early life and career James Turner Morehead was born on May 24, 1797 near Shepherdsville, Kentucky in Bullitt County. His parents, Armistead and Lucy (Latham) Morehead, moved to Russellville, Kentucky when he was very young, and he was educated at the public schools in that city. He attended Transylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky from 1813 to 1815. He then returned to Russellville, where he studied law under circuit court judge H. P. Broadnax and John J. Crittenden. He was admitted to the bar in 1818, and commenced practice in Bowling Green, Kentucky.Kentucky Explorer, p. 99 On May 1, 1823, Morehead married Susan A. Roberts; the couple had two children. He was elected to the Kentucky House of Representatives representing Warren County from 1828 to 1831. While there, he served on the Committee on Internal Improvements, and reported a bill for state subscription to the Maysville-Lexington Turnpike Company in 1831.Powell, p. 34 Governor of Kentucky In 1831, Morehead was also a delegate to the National Republican Party Convention in Baltimore, Maryland that nominated Henry Clay for president.Levin, p. 119 During the convention, he was nominated for the office of lieutenant governor. Though his National Republican running mate, Richard A. Buckner, was defeated by Democrat John Breathitt, Morehead was elected the ninth Lieutenant Governor.Mathias, p. 44 Governor Breathitt died of tuberculosis on February 21, 1834, and Morehead was sworn in as governor the following day. The replacement of a Democratic governor with one from the rival National Republican party caused a great deal of angst among Democrats, but the ascendancy of Democrat James Guthrie to president of the state senate and Morehead's willingness to retain Breathitt's secretary of state, Lewis Saunders, did much to allay their fears. Later that year, the National Republican party began to re-brand itself as the Whig Party, a name that first appeared in the Lexington Intelligencer on April 25, 1834. On July 4, 1834, Governor Morehead hosted the party's first convention in Frankfort. Kentuckians flocked to the \\"new\\" party en masse, and the legislative elections of August 1834 saw the party garner majorities in both houses of the state legislature. Flexing their political muscles, the majority party ousted Guthrie from his post as president of the Senate and by a vote of 90‚Äì40, and sent John J. Crittenden instead of Guthrie to the U.S. Senate in 1835.Mathias, p. 44‚Äì46 In his first address to the legislature, Morehead recommended a plan of expanded internal improvements, including improvements along the state's rivers. The legislature responded by creating a state board of internal improvements, and named Morehead the ex-officio president of the board. In this role, he authorized many surveys of Kentucky's rivers and formulated several plans for improvements, but most of them were blocked by the Panic of 1837. One improvement that did proceed was construction of the Lexington and Ohio Railroad, which was completed in 1835.Mathias, p. 45 Though education was not a high priority for Governor Morehead, the Kentucky Common School Society and the Kentucky Association of Professional Teachers were formed during his term.NGA Bio Later career Gravestone of Morehead in Frankfort Cemetery Following his service as governor, Morehead resumed his legal practice in Frankfort, Kentucky. In March 1837, he was commissioned by Governor James Clark to act as an agent for the state, selling bonds to fund internal improvements. He returned to the state House from 1837 to 1838, representing Franklin County. He was president of the Kentucky Board of Internal Improvements from 1838 to 1841, and in 1839, he and John Speed Smith were chosen as commissioners to the state of Ohio to secure the return of Kentucky- owned slaves as property of their masters. They were successful in this endeavor. Learned in Kentucky history, Morehead published An Address in Commemoration of the First Settlement of Kentucky, which contained original information regarding the early settlement of Boonesborough, Kentucky, in 1840. In 1846, he published another book, Practice in Civil Actions and Proceedings at Law. In 1841, Morehead was elected to the U.S. Senate and served from March 4, 1841 to March 3, 1847. There he was chairman of the U.S. Senate Committee on Indian Affairs and the Committee on Retrenchment. During his service in the Senate, he defended a federal bank bill and opposed the annexation of Texas, though he supported the U.S.-Mexican War after it began. He was also a staunch supporter of fellow Kentuckian Henry Clay. After his time in Congress, he continued the practice of law in Covington, Kentucky until his death. He was interred in the State lot of Frankfort Cemetery, Frankfort, Kentucky. The city of Morehead, Kentucky was named after him.

He was also a co-founder of the Gaullist Service d'Action Civique (SAC) in 1959 with Charles Pasqua, which specialized in covert operations in Africa. From 1960 to 1974, Foccart was Secretary-General for African and Malagasy Affairs under Presidents Charles de Gaulle and Georges Pompidou, and was pivotal in maintaining France's sphere of influence in sub-Saharan Africa (or Fran√ßafrique) by putting in place a series of cooperation accords with individual African countries and building a dense web of personal networks that underpinned the informal and family-like relationships between French and African leaders. After de Gaulle, Foccart was seen as the most influential man of the Fifth Republic. But through SAC, he was considered to be involved in various coups d'√©tat in Africa during the 1960s. Nevertheless, Foccart retained his functions during Georges Pompidou's presidency (1969‚Äì74). In 1974 Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing replaced Foccart with the young deputy whom he had himself trained. He was then rehabilitated in 1986 by the new Prime minister Jacques Chirac as an adviser on African affairs for the two years of \\"cohabitation\\" with socialist president Fran√ßois Mitterrand. When Chirac finally gained the presidency in 1995, the 81-year-old Foccart was brought back to the Elys√©e palace as an advisor. He died in 1997. According to the international affairs magazine The National Interest, \\"Foccart was said to have been telephoning African personalities on the subject of Zaire right up to the week before his death.\\"  Early life and career  Jacques Foccart was born on August 31, 1913 in Ambri√®res-les-Vall√©es, Mayenne, in west-central France, to a family of white planters from the Caribbean island of Guadeloupe. He married his wife, Isabelle Fenoglio, in 1939 and worked as a trader before World War II where he ran an import and export business. He was a sergeant in the French army during the war and later joined the French Resistance after France fell in 1940. He became close to Charles de Gaulle during the war and helped facilitate the latter's return to power in 1958. Foccart became secretary-general of Rally of the French People (RPF), a Gaullist party, in 1954 during the French Fourth Republic.  Postcolonial Africa  Foccart played a central role in what became known as Fran√ßafrique, France's sphere of influence over its former colonies in sub-Saharan Africa. He was instrumental in putting in place the dense web of personal networks (or r√©seaux), a central feature of Fran√ßafrique, that underpinned the informal and family-like relationships between French and African leaders, which would go on to survive until the 1990s. According to the US conservative magazine The National Interest, Jacques Foccart played \\"an essential role\\" in the negotiation of the Cooperation accords with the newly independent African states, former members of the French Community created in 1958. These accords involved the sectors of finance and economy, culture and education, and the military. There were initially eleven countries involved: Mauritania, Senegal, Cote d'Ivoire, Dahomey (now Benin), Upper Volta (now Burkina Faso), Niger, Chad, Gabon, Central African Republic, Congo-Brazzaville, and Madagascar. Togo and Cameroon, former UN Trust Territories, as well as, later on, Mali and the former Belgian territories (Ruanda-Urundi, now Rwanda and Burundi, and Congo- Kinshasa), together with some of the ex-Portuguese territories, and Comoros and Djibouti, which had also been under French rule for many years but became independent in the 1970s, were also later included. The whole ensemble was put under a new Ministry of Cooperation, created in 1961, separate from the Ministry for Overseas Departments and Territories (known as the DOM-TOM) that had previously run them all. The National Interest review asserts that this \\"Cooperation Ministry, focal point of the new evolving French system in Africa, regarded Foccart both as their \\"guarantor\\" and their advocate with de Gaulle. If the General had conceived the apparatus (though in fact some of it simply happened by improvisation), Foccart was the machine minder.\\" Close to Zaire dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, he was, in 1967, an important actor in the French support of the Biafran secession, through the use of mercenaries. National Interest 's review of his biography goes on with Foccart's admission that the French secret services eliminated the Cameroonian Marxist leader F√©lix-Roland Moumi√© in 1960. Furthermore, it quotes \\"some reports\\" which \\"suggested that Foccart and Houphou√´t spoke on the phone every Wednesday, and there is no doubt that he considered the Ivoirian leader the African centerpiece of his network. They operated together on a number of issues. Interventions such as that in Gabon in 1964 and Chad in 1969 were encouraged by the Foccart-Houphouet tandem. The most significant collaboration between Foccart and Houphouet was the way they tried to persuade de Gaulle to back the Biafran secession from Nigeria in 1967. Despite the pressures they exerted, however, de Gaulle refused to recognize Biafra, and, in retrospect, so guarded and elliptical are some of Foccart's statements that one cannot be sure what he really wanted or expected from de Gaulle at the time.\\" Jacques Foccart remained in service under Georges Pompidou's presidency (1969‚Äì1974). In 1972, Mongo Beti's Cruel hand on Cameroon, autopsy of a decolonization was censored upon its publication by Fran√ßois Maspero by the Ministry of the Interior Raymond Marcellin on the request, brought forward by Jacques Foccart, of the Cameroon government, represented in Paris by the ambassador Ferdinand Oyono. Foccart was then replaced by President Val√©ry Giscard d'Estaing (1974‚Äì81) with , whom he had trained himself. According to National Interest, he was critical of two special operations carried on under Giscard d'Estaing: the fiasco of the mercenary landing in Benin in January 1977 (with which he denies having had any connection, and would not have supported because it was badly conceived and executed); and \\"Operation Barracuda\\", the military intervention that deposed Emperor Bokassa in September 1979. Journiac died on 6 February 1980, in a mysterious plane crash in Northern Cameroon., Foreword Peter Dale Scott. Originally published in Danish as Smukke Serge og Heroien, Bogan, 1976 Foccart was then rehabilitated in 1986 by new Premier Chirac as an adviser on African affairs for the two years of the \\"cohabitation\\". When Chirac finally made it to the presidency in 1995, Foccart was brought back to the Elys√©e at the age of eighty-one, in the main because he still had remarkable contacts with African leaders such as President Omar Bongo of Gabon, who he served as his advisor on African affairs for a number of years after 1974. He would criticize the devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994 under Balladur's government, a month after Houphou√´t-Boigny's death.  Domestic activities  However, his role was not limited to Africa, as he was also charged by De Gaulle with the secret services and with the following of the elections, in particular concerning the choice of the candidates during the 1960s. The SAC (Service d'Action Civique) helped him for those shady missions. Foccart also admitted in Foccart Parle that relations with the SDECE intelligence agency were his concerns. National Interest observes that \\"His biographer's claim that General de Gaulle asked Foccart to reorganize the SDECE (in view of the tainting of both the armed forces and the intelligence agencies by the movement for Algerie Francaise) is indirectly confirmed, but there is not a clear picture of the organization of the barbouzes.\\" With Fran√ßois de Grossouvre, Jacques Foccart also helped to create the Department Protection Security (DPS), security organization of the far-right Front National party led by Jean-Marie Le Pen.  1990s  In 1995, Jacques Foccart was part of president Jacques Chirac's visit to Morocco, Senegal, C√¥te d'Ivoire and Gabon, all countries led by friends of Fran√ßafrique. Such had been his influence on French colonial and post colonial policy that when he died on March 19, 1997, \\"For those involved with what has come to be known nowadays as \\"Fran√ßafrique\\", denoting the special French sphere of influence in Africa, many, along with Albert Bourgi of Jeune Afrique, saw Foccart's death as 'the end of an epoch.' \\" The publication of his memoirs under the format of interviews at the end of his life, and the Journal de l'Elys√©e also published, in which, starting from 1965, Jacques Foccart transcribed his daily meetings with De Gaulle, have proved an invaluable resource for the knowledge of French policies in Africa. Furthermore, at his trial in 2006, mercenary Bob Denard, who was tried for his 1995 coup d'√©tat in the Comoros, alleged that Foccart had supported him.

The highway extends from Main Street (Route 166) at County Route 527 in Toms River to County Route 547 at Monmouth CR 21 in Howell. The highway has the distinction of being the only 500-series route left with two separate spur routes. The highway passes through Ocean and Monmouth counties and is maintained by its respective county, but there are several indications that the highway at one point may have been or was originally planned to be state maintained. There are a few mileposts left along the southern section of the highway that have a \\"NJDT\\" label on the bottom right corner. Also, the only \\"at grade\\" cloverleaf in New Jersey exists on CR 549, and on the bridges there exists a stamp in the concrete that reads \\"1975\\". No other county bridges have their dates stamped into them. CR 549 mostly travels through Ocean County. The highway makes frequent turns onto separate roads. The route in its northern segment is a two-lane, rural road, but it becomes a four-lane arterial after crossing the Garden State Parkway all the way to Toms River Township. County Route 549 handles more traffic than any other county route in all of Ocean County; it is a major link between the townships of Toms River and Brick. As the route is plagued by chronic congestion, the county has invested millions of dollars into upgrading this corridor. The most recent improvement was from Cedar Bridge Avenue (CR 528) to Beaverson Boulevard. It included widening, signal modification, and the extension of Beaverson Boulevard to meet Old Hooper Avenue. Ongoing improvements are being made between Beaverson Boulevard and Church Road, where widening and reconstruction should help alleviate some congestion in that area. Route description CR 549 northbound past CR 631 in Brick Township CR 549 begins at an intersection with Route 166 and the southern terminus of CR 527 in Toms River, Ocean County, heading east on four- lane undivided Water Street. The road runs through the commercial downtown of Toms River a short distance to the north of the Toms River. The route turns north onto Hooper Avenue, which passes through more of the downtown area before heading into residential areas and narrowing to two lanes. Upon crossing Route 37, CR 549 becomes a six-lane divided highway with jughandles that passes through commercial areas, narrowing to four lanes. The road heads to the west of the Seacourt Pavilion shopping center and intersects CR 571 at an at-grade cloverleaf interchange. Following this, the roadway passes to the west of the Ocean County Mall, widening to six lanes again. The road narrows back to four lanes at the CR 94 intersection as it passes more shopping centers, turning more to the northeast. CR 549 enters wooded areas as it passes an entrance to Ocean County College and comes to an intersection with the northern terminus of the southern CR 549 Spur. Past this intersection, the route makes a turn to the north again and enters more commercial areas, crossing CR 620 before entering Brick Township. Here, CR 549 becomes Brick Boulevard and intersects CR 631 before continuing past more development with three northbound lanes and two southbound lanes. After the CR 66 junction, the road carries two lanes in each direction as it reaches intersections with CR 624 and CR 528, turning more to the northeast. CR 549 comes to an intersection with CR 631, at which point CR 549 splits from Brick Boulevard by heading northwest on Chambers Bridge Road, with CR 631 continuing north on Brick Boulevard. The four-lane undivided road passes shopping centers and crosses Route 70. After this intersection, CR 549 widens into a four-lane divided highway again and passes more businesses, turning into an undivided road again as it comes to a partial interchange with the Garden State Parkway that has access to and from the southbound direction of the parkway. Western terminus of CR 549 at CR 547 Immediately after this interchange, the road crosses the Metedeconk River (South Branch) into Lakewood Township and turns north, coming to the Route 88 intersection. At this point, CR 549 becomes two-lane undivided Lanes Mill Road and enters forested areas with some homes, turning northeast as it comes to the eastern terminus of CR 526. Immediately after, the route crosses the Metedeconk River (North Branch) back into Brick Township and passes more residential and business areas, heading west of a park and ride lot, before intersecting CR 63. At this intersection, CR 549 turns east onto Burnt Tavern Road and has an interchange with the Garden State Parkway again, this time providing full access. After the parkway, CR 549 turns north onto Lanes Mill Road, with CR 632 continuing east on Burnt Tavern Road. The Brick Park & Ride serving NJ Transit buses to New York City is located along the ramp from CR 549 to the northbound Garden State Parkway. The road passes residential subdivisions and continues northeast onto Sally Ike Road, with CR 12 heading northeast along Lanes Mill Road. The route comes to an intersection with the northern CR 549 Spur, and CR 549 turns northwest onto Herbertsville Road, with CR 14 continuing north on Sally Ike Road. The route crosses into Wall Township, Monmouth County and passes under the Garden State Parkway before entering wooded areas with some homes. The road enters Howell Township and intersects CR 21, running northwest through wooded areas of Allaire State Park. CR 549 comes to its northern terminus at CR 547, with the road continuing northwest as CR 21. View north along CR 549 at Allentown-Lakewood Road in Wall In Monmouth County, CR 549 is signed as east-west. History The Fischer Boulevard Extension was proposed in the late 1990s to alleviate severe congestion on Hooper Avenue (County Route 549) from Toms River Township into Brick Township. It would have continued Fischer Boulevard (County Route 549 Spur) north through undeveloped land near Ocean County College, before connecting with Church Road near its intersection with North Bay Avenue near the Garden State Parkway overpass. The extension would have moderated traffic on 549 as traffic from the northern and western parts of Toms River could use the extension to get to the shore area. Since Fischer Blvd ends at its intersection with Hooper Avenue, all traffic has to take Hooper to get to their destination whether it is to Brick or the western sections of Toms River. The plan has been in the works but has been stalled for several years.  Major intersections CR 549 Spur=Southern section CR 549 Spur northbound at CR 571 in Toms River County Route 549 Spur, abbreviated CR 549 Spur, is a county highway in the U.S. state of New Jersey.

Early life A scion of a pioneering and aristocratic family, he was raised on his father's plantation and town homes and was taught by tutors before attending the elite New Bern Academy. Because of his religious and academic qualifications he was admitted to Yale College where he gained further education in civil and church law and history. Subsequently, he attended the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill starting in 1839 and studied law. Subsequently, he was admitted to the bar in 1840 and commenced practice in New Bern, N.C. Military service He later joined the North Carolina militia and raised a force for the state as was the practice and socially required responsibility of gentlemen of his age. His militia unit organized volunteers for the Mexican-American war. As commanding officer Donnell trained and hired the captains and lower ranking officers. Political career During the war he was elected as a Whig to the Thirtieth Congress (March 4, 1847 ‚Äì March 3, 1849). However, his support for the war cost him the support of other Whigs and he was not a candidate for renomination in 1848. After the war he resumed the practice of law in Washington, North Carolina and became involved in state politics until the controversies of abolition and the election of 1860. Originally supportive of maintaining union, as a delegate to the State secession convention in 1861 Donnell was a proponent of a national constitutional convention to resolve that crisis. When that proposal was shot down by the Republican Party and Abolitionists, and following orders of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln which called up the militia to occupy the southern states, he voted in support of secession. During the American Civil War he was elected to the North Carolina General Assembly of 1862‚Äì1864, and served as speaker. Because of his experience in military organization his counsel on military matters was sought and he helped develop and organize the state for war footing. Along with others of his generation, the war was costly to his family's standing. The Union's total war campaign against fellow Americans was unexpected and his family's finances and wealth which had developed when the state was a mere colonial frontier outpost suffered heavily. Several properties were burned by invading and looting Union soldiers. At the end of the war he was hunted by Union army forces until an armistice was declared. With the establishment of peace North Carolina was invited back into the Union. Due to his historical leadership in the state he was elected to the State constitutional convention of 1865. He was subsequently elected to the 1866 Congress but was refused entrance by the Radical Republican Rump Congress. When the Republican coup d'√©tat of 1867 was launched he was arrested by the Army along with the rest of the North Carolina State leadership. His health and wealth broken he died under Army detention in New Bern, North Carolina. His family's properties, including that established by his grandfather a Founding Father, never recovered. He is buried in Cedar Grove Cemetery.Find A Grave: Cedar Grove Cemetery  See also  * Thirtieth United States Congress References External links  * Category:Members of the North Carolina House of Representatives Category:Members of the United States House of Representatives from North Carolina Category:1820 births Category:1867 deaths Category:North Carolina Whigs Category:Politicians from New Bern, North Carolina Category:Whig Party members of the United States House of Representatives Category:19th-century American politicians Category:People from Washington, North Carolina Category:Yale College alumni ","title":"Richard Spaight Donnell"},{"id":"4165045","text":"R v Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society, [1992] 2 S.C.R. 606 is a leading Supreme Court of Canada decision on section 7 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms and the doctrine of vagueness. The Court held that laws can be struck down as a violation of section 7 where they are so vague as to violate fundamental justice. Background A number of pharmacies were charged with conspiracy \\"to prevent or lessen competition\\" under section 32(1)(c) of the Combines Investigation Act for the sale of prescription drugs and dispensing services prior to June 1986. They challenged the provision on the basis that it violated section 7 of the Charter on account of its vagueness. At trial, the Supreme Court of Nova Scotia found in favour of the pharmaceutical companies and overturned the conviction. On appeal the court overturned the verdict and found in favour of the Crown. The issue before the Supreme Court was: # whether section 32(1)(c) of the Act infringed s. 7 of the Charter because of vagueness arising from the use of the word \\"unduly\\"; and # whether section 32(1)(c) infringed section 7 by reason of the mens rea required by the offence. The Court held that section 32(1)(c) of the Act was sufficiently clear and was not in violation of the Charter. Justice Gonthier wrote for a unanimous Court. Reasoning of the court Justice Gonthier observed that the doctrine of vagueness under section 7 was founded in the doctrine of the rule of law. Specifically, \\"the principles of fair notice to citizens and limitation of enforcement discretion\\". A law will be in violation of section 7 for vagueness if \\"it so lacks in precision as not to give sufficient guidance for legal debate.\\" (p. 643) The requirement of \\"fair notice\\" means that there must be awareness of the law. The citizen must have an \\"understanding that certain conduct is the subject of legal restrictions.\\" The \\"limitation of law enforcement discretion\\" is directed at the content of the law, which requires that a law \\"not be so devoid of precision in its content that a conviction will automatically flow from the decision to prosecute.\\" (p. 636) The term \\"legal debate\\" was intended to reflect and encompass the principles of vagueness in the \\"fuller context of an analysis of the quality and limits of human knowledge and understanding in the operation of the law.\\" (p. 640) This requires that the law sets out \\"the boundaries of permissible and non-permissible conduct\\". In all the threshold for vagueness is a high one. Gonthier gave a list of factors to consider when determining if a provision is vague: # the need for flexibility and the role of courts in interpreting the law; # the impossibility of absolute precision, a standard of intelligibility being preferable; and # the possibility that a given provision may be susceptible to a number of interpretations which can co-exist. On the facts, the impugned provision of the Act was found not to be vague. The Court examined the wording of the provision and considered the context of the Act in the area of commercial law, and found that \\"Parliament has sufficiently delineated the area of risk and the terms of debate to meet the constitutional standard.\\" See also *List of Supreme Court of Canada cases (Lamer Court) External links * *case summary from mapleleafweb.com Category:Section Seven Charter case law Category:Supreme Court of Canada cases Category:1992 in Canadian case law ","title":"R v Nova Scotia Pharmaceutical Society"},{"id":"4165053","text":" This list includes all those battles which were fought throughout the Napoleonic era, April 1796 ‚Äì 3 July 1815.

The NLM classification is patterned after the Library of Congress (LC) Classification system: alphabetical letters denote broad subject categories which are subdivided by numbers. For example, QW 279 would indicate a book on an aspect of microbiology or immunology. The one- or two-letter alphabetical codes in the NLM classification use a limited range of letters: only QS‚ÄìQZ and W‚ÄìWZ. This allows the NLM system to co-exist with the larger LC coding scheme as neither of these ranges are used in the LC system. There are, however, three pre-existing codes in the LC system which overlap with the NLM: Human Anatomy (QM), Microbiology (QR), and Medicine (R). To avoid further confusion, these three codes are not used in the NLM. The headings for the individual schedules (letters or letter pairs) are given in brief form (e.g., QW - Microbiology and Immunology; WG - Cardiovascular System) and together they provide an outline of the subjects covered by the NLM classification. Headings are interpreted broadly and include the physiological system, the specialties connected with them, the regions of the body chiefly concerned and subordinate related fields. The NLM system is hierarchical, and within each schedule, division by organ usually has priority. Each main schedule, as well as some sub-sections, begins with a group of form numbers ranging generally from 1‚Äì49 which classify materials by publication type, e.g., dictionaries, atlases, laboratory manuals, etc. The main schedules QS-QZ, W-WY, and WZ (excluding the range WZ 220‚Äì270) classify works published after 1913; the 19th century schedule is used for works published 1801-1913; and WZ 220-270 is used to provide century groupings for works published before 1801.

Lake Fusaro (, , ) situated in the province of Naples, Italy, in the territory of the community of Bacoli. It is about from Baia, and about from the acropolis of Cumae. It is separated from the sea by a narrow coastal strip. It is a very unusual ecosystem of great interest, characterized by a variety of vegetation which is specific of its the region. Geography Thanks to the presence of fresh water springs, Lake Fusaro (known since the 3rd century B.C. as Acherusia Palus), has been known around the world for its great oysters. Mussels are also fished in quantity in the lake. The lake is surrounded by a number of buildings, including the Royal Casina, the Ostrichina, the Grand Restaurant, the Pavilions (stables) and the Green Park, which were all part of a large business employing around 1,000 people at the beginning of the 20th century. Today, most of these buildings are not used for their original purpose, but still serve as tourist destinations.  Casina Vanvitelliana  The Casina Vanvitelliana is an evocative little house located on a little island of Lago Fusaro, in the municipality of Bacoli. In 1752 the area of the Fusaro, at the time mostly inhabited, became the hunting and fishing reserve of the Bourbons, who hire Luigi Vanvitelli for the first works for the transformation of the place. When Ferdinando IV ascended to the throne, the interventions were completed by Carlo Vanvitelli, son of Luigi, who in 1782 created the Royal Casino of Caccia on the lake, not far from the shore. Casina Vanvitelliana and Fusaro lake This building, known as Casina Vanvitelliana, was used as the residence of important guests, such as Francis II of Habsburg-Lorraine, who stayed here in May 1819. Inside the building were also welcomed Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, Gioachino Rossini and, more recently, the President of the Republic Luigi Einaudi. Casina Vanvitelliana, Bacoli (NA), Italy From an architectural point of view, the Casina is one of the most refined eighteenth- century productions, with something that is similar to the conformation of the hunting lodge, designed a few years before by Filippo Juvarra using plastic volumes and large windows. The building commissioned by the Bourbons in fact has a very articulated plan, composed of three octagonal bodies that intersect one at the top of the other, as a sort of pagoda, with large windows arranged on two levels; in addition a long wooden bridge connects the Casina to the lake shore. The Casina Vanvitelliana appears in the film Ferdinando e Carolina, by Lina Wertm√ºller, as well as in Lucio the smuggler by Lucio Fulci (1980).

First described by Carl Linnaeus in 1753, it is the type species of the genus Hydnum. The fungus produces fruit bodies (mushrooms) that are characterized by their spore-bearing structures‚Äîin the form of spines rather than gills‚Äîwhich hang down from the underside of the cap. The cap is dry, colored yellow to light orange to brown, and often develops an irregular shape, especially when it has grown closely crowded with adjacent fruit bodies. The mushroom tissue is white with a pleasant odor and a spicy or bitter taste. All parts of the mushroom stain orange with age or when bruised. A mycorrhizal fungus, Hydnum repandum is broadly distributed in Europe where it fruits singly or in close groups in coniferous or deciduous woodland. This is a choice edible species, although mature specimens can develop a bitter taste. It has no poisonous lookalikes. Mushrooms are collected and sold in local markets of Europe and Canada.  Taxonomy  First officially described by Carl Linnaeus in his 1753 Species Plantarum, Hydnum repandum was sanctioned by Swedish mycologist Elias Fries in 1821. The species has been shuffled among several genera: Hypothele by French naturalist Jean-Jacques Paulet in 1812; Dentinum by British botanist Samuel Frederick Gray in 1821; Tyrodon by Finnish mycologist Petter Karsten in 1881; Sarcodon by French naturalist Lucien Qu√©let in 1886. After a 1977 nomenclatural proposal by American mycologist Ronald H. Petersen was accepted, Hydnum repandum became the official type species of the genus Hydnum. Previously, supporting arguments for making H. repandum the type were made by Dutch taxonomist Marinus Anton Donk (1958) and Petersen (1973), while Czech mycologist Zdenƒõk Pouzar (1958) and Canadian mycologist Kenneth Harrison (1971) thought that H. imbricatum should be the type. Several forms and varieties of H. repandum have been described. Forms albidum and rufescens, found in Russia, were published by T.L. Nikolajeva in 1961; the latter taxon is synonymous with H. rufescens. Form amarum, published from Slovenia by Zlata Stropnik, Bogdan Tratnik and Garbrijel Seljak in 1988, is illegitimate as per article 36.1 of the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, as it was not given a sufficiently comprehensive description. French botanist Jean-Baptiste Barla described H. repandum var. rufescens in 1859. English naturalist Carleton Rea described the white-fruit bodied version as a variety‚ÄîH. repandum var. album‚Äîin 1922. Molecular studies have shown that the current species concept for H. repandum needed revision as there was a poor overlap between morphological and molecular species concepts. A 2009 Phylogenetic analysis of European specimens, based on internal transcribed spacer and 5.8S DNA sequences, indicated that H. repandum specimens form two distinct clades, whose only consistent morphological distinction is cap size. These genetic differences foreshadowed the presence of undescribed cryptic species, and that the taxon may currently be undergoing intensive speciation. A comprehensive genetic study published in 2016 of members of the genus worldwide found that there are at least four species in the broad concept of H. repandum: two species from southern China, one from Europe and eastern North America, and H. repandum itself from Europe, western North America, and northern (and alpine southwestern) China and Japan. Although it is missing from Central America, genetic material has been recovered from Venezuela from the tree Pakaraimaea dipterocarpacea, suggesting it somehow migrated there and had changed hosts. The specific epithet repandum means \\"bent back\\", referring to the wavy cap margin. The varietal epithet album means \\"white as an egg\\". Hydnum repandum has been given several vernacular names: \\"sweet tooth\\", \\"yellow tooth fungus\\", \\"wood urchin\\", \\"spreading hedgehog\\", \\"hedgehog mushroom\\", or \\"pig's trotter\\". The variety album is known as \\"white wood\\".  Description  Detail of the spines The orange-, yellow- or tan-colored pileus (cap) is up to wide, although specimens measuring have been documented. It is generally somewhat irregular in shape (it may be convex or concave at maturity), with a wavy margin that is rolled inward when young. Caps grow in a distorted shape when fruit bodies are closely clustered. The cap surface is generally dry and smooth, although mature specimens may show cracking. Viewed from above, the caps of mature specimens resemble somewhat those of chanterelles. The flesh is thick, white, firm, brittle, and bruises yellow to orange-brown. The underside is densely covered with small, slender whitish spines measuring long. These spines sometimes run down at least one side of the stipe. The stipe, typically long and thick, is either white or the same color as the cap, and is sometimes off-center. It is easy to overlook the mushrooms when they are situated amongst gilled mushrooms and boletes, because the cap and stipe are fairly nondescript and the mushrooms must be turned over to reveal their spines. The pure white variety of this species, H. repandum var. album, is smaller than the main variety, with a cap measuring wide and a stipe that is long. The spore print is pale cream. Basidiospores are smooth, thin-walled and hyaline (translucent), roughly spherical to broadly egg- shaped, and measure 5.5‚Äì7.5 by 4.5‚Äì5.5 ¬µm. They usually contain a single, large refractive oil droplet. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are club- shaped, four-spored, and measure 30‚Äì45 by 6‚Äì10 ¬µm. The cap cuticle is a trichodermium (where the outermost hyphae emerge roughly parallel, like hairs, perpendicular to the cap surface) of narrow, club-shaped cells that are 2.5‚Äì4 ¬µm wide. Underneath this tissue is the subhymenial layer of interwoven hyphae measuring 10‚Äì20 ¬µm in diameter. The spine tissue is made of narrow (2‚Äì5 ¬µm diameter), thin-walled hyphae with clamp connections.  Similar species  North American lookalikes include the white hedgehog (Hydnum albidum) and the giant hedgehog (Hydnum albomagnum). H. albidum has a white to pale yellowish grey fruit body that bruises yellow to orange. H. albomagnum is large and paler than H. repandum. Hydnum umbilicatum is smaller, with caps measuring in diameter, and thinner stipes that are wide. Its caps are umbilicate (with a navel-like cavity), sometimes with a hole in the center of the cap, unlike the flattened or slightly depressed caps of H. repandum. Microscopically, H. umbilicatum has spores that are larger and more elliptical than those of H. repandum, measuring 7.5‚Äì9 by 6‚Äì7.5 ¬µm. A European lookalike, Hydnum rufescens, is also smaller than H. repandum, and has a deeper apricot to orange color. Hydnum ellipsosporum, described as a new species from Germany in 2004, differs from H. repandum by the shape and length of its spores, which are ellipsoid and measure 9‚Äì11 by 6‚Äì7.5 ¬µm. Compared to H. repandum, it has smaller fruit bodies, with cap diameters ranging from wide.  Ecology, habitat and distribution  Collection from Eggingen, Germany H. repandum is a mycorrhizal fungus. The fruit bodies grow singly, scattered, or in groups on the ground or in leaf litter in both coniferous and deciduous forests. They can also grow in fairy rings. Fruiting occurs from summer to autumn. The species is widely distributed in Europe, and is one of the most common of the tooth fungi. In Europe, it has been listed as a vulnerable species in the Red Data Lists of the Netherlands, Belgium, and Germany; Sweden lists it as being of Least Concern.  Edibility  H. repandum on sale at a market in Finland H. repandum is considered to be a good edible, having a sweet, nutty taste and a crunchy texture. Some consider it to be the culinary equivalent of the chanterelle. Author Michael Kuo gives it an edibility rating of \\"great\\" and notes that there are no poisonous lookalikes, and that H. repandum mushrooms are unlikely to be infested with maggots. Delicately brushing the cap and stipe of specimens immediately after harvest will help prevent soil from getting lodged between the teeth. H. repandum mushrooms can be cooked by pickling, simmering in milk or stock, and saut√©eing, which creates a \\"tender, meaty texture and a mild flavor.\\" The mushroom tissue absorbs liquids well and assumes the flavors of added ingredients. The firm texture of the cooked mushroom makes it suitable for freezing. Its natural flavor is reportedly similar to the peppery taste of watercress, or oysters. Older specimens may have a bitter taste, but boiling can remove the bitterness. Specimens found under conifers can taste \\"unpleasantly strong\\". The form amarum, locally common in Slovakia, is reportedly inedible because its fruit body has a bitter taste at all developmental stages. Hydnum repandum is frequently sold with chanterelles in Italy, and in France, it is one of the officially recognized edible species sold in markets. In Europe, it is usually sold under its French name pied-de-mouton (sheep's foot). It is also collected and sold in local markets of Mexico,Dugan (2011), p. 75. SpainDugan (2011), p. 44. and British Columbia, Canada.Dugan (2011), p. 91. H. repandum mushrooms are also used as a food source by the red squirrel (Sciurus vulgaris). Nutrition Dried H. repandum is 56% carbohydrates, 4% fat, and 20% protein (table). In a 100 gram reference amount, several dietary minerals are high in content, especially copper and manganese. Major fatty acids include palmitate (16%), stearic acid (1%), oleic acid (26%), linoleic acid (48%), and linolenic acid (20%). Mycosterol is present.  Phytochemicals  Both H. repandum and the variety album contain the diepoxide compound repandiol (2R,3R,8R,9R)-4,6-decadiyne-2,3:8,9-diepoxy-1,10-diol), which is under laboratory research to determine its possible effects. The volatile phytochemicals responsible for the fruity aroma of the mushroom include eight- carbon derivatives, such as 1-octen-3-ol, (E)-2-octenol, and (E)-1,3-octadiene. European studies conducted after the 1986 Chernobyl disaster showed that the fruit bodies have a high rate of accumulation of the radioactive isotope cesium.

The Vidocq Society is named for Eug√®ne Fran√ßois Vidocq, the ground-breaking 19th century French detective who helped police by using the psychology of the criminal to solve \\"cold case\\" homicides. Vidocq was a former criminal himself, and used his knowledge of the criminal mind to look at murder from the psychological perspective of the perpetrator. At meetings, Vidocq Society Members (VSMs) listen to law enforcement officials from around the world who bring in cold cases for review. VSMs are forensic professionals; current and former FBI profilers, homicide investigators, scientists, psychologists, prosecutors and coroners who use their experience to provide new insights for investigations that have gone cold. Members are selected by committee invitation only, pay a $100 annual fee, and commit to attend at least one meeting per year. The Society was formed in 1990 by William Fleisher, Richard Walter, and Frank Bender. It solved its first case in 1991, clearing an innocent man of involvement in the murder of Huey Cox in Little Rock, Arkansas. Vidocq will only consider cases that meet certain requirements: they must be unsolved deaths more than two years old, the victims cannot have been involved in criminal activity such as prostitution or drug dealing, and the case must be formally presented to them by the appropriate law enforcement agency. The Society does not charge for its services, and pays for the travel expenses of the law enforcement agents who come to present cases. The Society was chronicled in a 2002 episode of The New Detectives entitled \\"Collective Justice\\", and was also a plot point in the finale of the 2007‚Äì08 season of Law and Order: Special Victims Unit. In 2010 it became the subject of a book, The Murder Room by Michael Capuzzo.

Pearson‚ÄìArastradero Preserve, is a nature preserve that protects most of the Arastradero Creek watershed, including its ephemeral Mayfly Creek tributary. The preserve is owned and operated by the City of Palo Alto, California. The main parking lot hosts an interpretive center and is located at 1530 Arastradero Road (37¬∞23'13\\" N, 122¬∞10'29\\" W). Description Watching water birds on Arastradero Lake 1876 Historical Map Shows Matadero Creek and Los Trancos (Stancos) Creek as well as unnamed Arastradero Creek and Felt Creek near Arastradero Road Arastradero Preserve consists of rolling savanna grassland hills and evergreen forests; the preserve varies in elevation from in the northeast to in the southwest. The Pearson‚ÄìArastradero Preserve has of trails for hiking, biking and horseback riding. While many of the trails are open year-round, some trails are designated as \\"seasonal\\" and are closed at the trailhead temporarily after heavy rain. There are four gates (labeled A, B, C, and D) into the preserve, though public parking is available only at Gate A on the North side. Gate D connects to Foothills Park as part of the Bay-to-Ridge Trail. The park is also accessible from a pedestrian footpath that leads to the residential area on the street Paseo del Roble. The preserve protects Arastradero Creek, which flows into Matadero Creek at the junction of Arastradero Road and Page Mill Road. Near the East side about a quarter mile south of the entrance is Arastradero Lake, and further south up into the preserve is Sobey Pond. The lake is also about 0.2 miles from the Paseo del Roble entrance. Ecology The preserve contains an abundance of wildlife, including deer, bobcats, coyotes, snakes, and many species of birds. The preserve and the surrounding area are habitats for the California puma (Puma concolor is also locally known as mountain lion). There are regular sightings of puma and coyotes in the areas, and people hiking with dogs or small children should be cautious. From 2016 through 2020, a pair of bald eagles (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) has nested in a large eucalyptus tree near Felt Lake and the preserve. Trails The trails at Arastradero Preserve include Acorn, Arastradeo Creek, Bay Laurel, Bowl Loop, Juan Bautista de Anza, Meadowlark, Ohlone, Paseo del Roble, Portola Pastures, Redtail Loop, Wild Rye, Woodland Star, and Woodrat. Restoration and stewardship activities Grassroots Ecology, a local environmental nonprofit, has run a collaborative stewardship program on the Preserve in cooperation with the City of Palo Alto since 1997. Volunteers and Grassroots Ecology staff work to improve the Preserve by eliminating invasive weeds such as non-native thistles, planting native species such as blue wild rye and engaging local youth and community members. Surroundings and history Portions of Arastradero Preserve border Foothills Park (on the South side), the Palo Alto Golf Course (on the East side), open land owned by Stanford University (to the North), and one of the campuses of Palo Alto University (to the West). From the hills on the North Side, one can see Felt Lake which is otherwise difficult to see from public lands except Vista Hill in Foothills Park. Because most of the golf course in on a flat mesa at a higher elevation than the preserve, the golf course is largely invisible from the preserve. There remains a small piece of private property adjacent to Arastradero Road surrounded on all sides by the preserve which currently has no structures. There had been a private home deep within the preserve until the late 1990s which has now been torn down. In 2006 a small visitor's center was erected near the parking lot entrance which contains a miniature scale model of the park and exhibits explaining the ecology, flora, and fauna of the region.

It took place on the evening of 21 February 2006 from 18:30 GMT until the early hours of 22 February 2006. Several men armed with AK47s, and ≈†korpions abducted and threatened the family of the manager, tied up fourteen staff members and stole cash worth over $92 million (¬£53,116,760), in bank notes belonging to the Bank of England from a Securitas Cash Management Ltd depot in Vale Road, Tonbridge, Kent in the United Kingdom. The Securitas depot robbery occurred during the tenure of its CEO Thomas Breglund, and is only eclipsed by the wartime $1 billion dollar Central Bank of Iraq heist, done under the orders of Saddam Hussein, by his son Qusay in 2003. Robbery The manager of the depot, Colin Dixon, was abducted at about 18:30 GMT on 21 February 2006, while driving his silver Nissan Almera. He was pulled over on the A249 just outside Stockbury, a village northeast of Maidstone, by what he thought was an unmarked police vehicle, due to the blue lights behind the front grill. A man approached him in high-visibility clothing and a police-style hat. The manager proceeded to get into the police impostor's car, thinking that he was a police officer, where he was then handcuffed by others in the vehicle. He was then driven west on the M20 motorway to the West Malling bypass, where he was bound further, transferred into a white van and transported to a farm in Staplehurst, Kent. As this was taking place, the manager's wife and eight-year-old son were being held hostage at their home in Herne Bay, after they answered the door to men dressed in police uniforms, who falsely informed them that the manager had been involved in a road traffic accident. They were then driven to the farm at which the manager was being held, where he was told, at gunpoint, that failure to co-operate could put him and his family in danger. The depot manager, his wife and son were taken to the Securitas depot in Tonbridge at around 01:00, travelling in a plain white van, being held at gunpoint. At the depot, 14 members of staff were bound by robbers armed with handguns, shotguns, a ≈†korpion and AK-47s, and wearing balaclavas. The robbery came to an end at approximately 02:45. The staff, along with Mr Dixon's wife and son, were left locked in cash cages. However, one member of staff had a key to unlock the cage she was locked in; she was then able to free the others. It was still another half an hour before staff members, who had been tied up, managed to raise the alarm.Kent & Sussex Courier, 29 June Police officers arriving on the scene discovered staff, the manager and his family all bound, but physically unharmed. The Bank of England, to whom the money belonged, was reimbursed ¬£25 million by Securitas AB the same day, and assured the public that Securitas would make up any additional loss. Investigation and arrests Securitas and their insurers offered a reward of ¬£2 million for information leading to the thieves' capture.¬£2m reward for depot raid leads, BBC, 23 February 2006 On 23 February 2006 at around 19:00 police confirmed the arrest in Forest Hill, South London of a man aged 29 and a woman aged 31, on suspicion of conspiracy to commit robbery. There were thought to be at least six armed robbers involved. On the same day, a 41-year-old woman was arrested at the Portman Building Society branch in Bromley in South London by the Metropolitan Police. The woman was moved to a police station in Kent to be questioned by detectives on suspicion of handling stolen goods. According to some news reports, she was dressed as a Salvation Army nurse and apparently tried to deposit ¬£6,000 cash bound in tape marked \\"Tonbridge\\". As the investigation progressed, police traced a number of the vehicles involved in the robbery including a Parcelforce van thought to have been used in the abduction of the depot manager and his family. The van was found abandoned at the \\"Hook and Hatchet\\" pub in the village of Hucking, near Maidstone. A Volvo S60 and a red Vauxhall Vectra also thought to have been used (and made to look like unmarked police cars) in the abductions were found in the village of Leeds, near Leeds Castle overnight on 23 February 2006. The Volvo had apparently been set alight. On the same day Colin Dixon's Nissan Almera was also found in the car park of the \\"Cock Horse\\" pub in Detling.The Hook and Hatchet Pub, Hucking, where the Parcelforce van was found The next day, Kent Police recovered a white Ford Transit van from the car park of the Ashford International Hotel. The van was found after a tip-off from a member of the public. The van and its contents were taken away from the hotel for forensic examination, and on 26 February 2006, it was announced that the van contained ¬£1.3 million, along with guns, balaclavas and body armour.Depot robbers left behind ¬£1.3m, BBC, 26 February 2006 Metal cages and packaging material that may have been used to transport the money were recovered in a field near Detling on 24 February 2006. On the evening of 25 February 2006, forensic teams and armed police officers raided the houses of Lea Rusha and Jetmir Bucpapa in Southborough near Tunbridge Wells while neither were home. In Rusha's house police discovered shotgun shells and hand-drawn plans of the depot. On the afternoon of the next day, Kent Police challenged Rusha and Bucpapa on Marine Parade in Tankerton, near Whitstable. They fled in a blue BMW 3 Series coupe. The car was halted, some witnesses say police marksmen shot out a tyre while others say a \\"stinger\\" device was used. The driver and another man were arrested.Police open fire in hunt for ¬£50m gang, The Daily Telegraph, 27 February 2006 On 27 February 2006, two individuals were detained by police in the Greenwich area of London by armed officers. The following day, the white 7.5 ton Renault Midlum lorry allegedly used to transport the stolen money was eventually recovered by police at an undisclosed location. Simultaneously, Kent police raided Elderden Farm in the Staplehurst area, apparently conducting extensive forensic searches of the surrounding land and buildings and seizing vehicles. Searches of local wells were also undertaken by police divers. The farm was owned by a local car dealer who could not be located at the time of the raid. A further arrest also took place of a woman who became the twelfth person detained during the investigation, most of whom have subsequently been released on bail.Police find the getaway lorry used in ¬£53m raid, The Times Late on 1 March 2006, Kent Police confirmed that John Fowler (a car dealer and the owner of Elderden Farm) had been charged with conspiracy to rob Securitas and three charges of kidnapping; Stuart Royle had been charged with conspiracy to rob; and Kim Shackleton had been charged with handling stolen goods. They appeared at Maidstone Magistrates' Court on 2 March, and were remanded in custody until 13 March, when they appeared at Maidstone Crown Court.Three in court over ¬£53m robbery, BBC, 2 March 2006 Jetmir Bucpapa was charged with conspiracy to commit robbery the next day, and Lea John Rusha was charged with the same offence on the day after that. Both appeared in court on 3 March and were remanded in custody until a preliminary hearing at Maidstone Crown Court on the 13th. Also on 2 March, during a raid on an industrial depot in Welling, a currently unknown amount of cash was discovered, and a further arrest was made. It has been reported that the amount of money is several million pounds.Millions found after depot raid, BBC, 3 March 2006 A further arrest was made in the Bexley area of London on Saturday 4 March in connection with the robbery. The man was subsequently released on bail bringing the total number of arrests at that stage to seventeen. By 6 March, police had recovered ¬£11m as a result of various raids and forensic searches. The next day, two employees of a firm that had been contracted by Securitas were arrested. By 9 March, police had recovered ¬£19.7m as a result of various raids and searches. On 25 June 2006, in a joint operation with Moroccan police, four men were arrested at a shopping centre in the Souissi district of the capital Rabat.Arrest in Morocco over ¬£53m raid, BBC 26 June 2006 Kent Police said in a statement that they had been tracking Lee Murray, a 26-year-old from Sidcup, South London, for three months. Murray was arrested with friend Paul \\"The Enforcer\\" Allen. There is no treaty between the UK and Morocco, which made this difficult. Later, Moroccan police revealed that Murray had also been charged with possession of \\"hard drugs\\". Kent Police confirmed Murray's arrest the next day, and also stated that over 30 people had now been arrested in conjunction with the investigation.Kent Police Press Release, Kent Police, 27 June 2006 By year's end, the investigation costs for the Kent police had swelled to ¬£6 million, with aid requested from the Home Office towards their investigation cost.Police 'need ¬£6m for heist costs', BBC News, 1 December 2006 In December 2006, Sean Lupton, who had been released on bail, was missing having failed to answer the conditions of his bail. Also in February 2007, Murray's lawyer speculated that Murray could be returned from Morocco to Britain in exchange for suspected terrorist Mohamed Karbouzi, who is wanted for questioning by the Moroccan authorities in connection with the 2003 Casablanca bombings. Trial The trial began on 26 June 2007 at the Old Bailey in London, presided over by Justice David Penry-Davey. The first three weeks of the trial focused on the role of the manager Colin Dixon with the defence cross-examination highlighting 'co-incidences' in his conduct which might be interpreted as suggesting he was the inside man. On 28 January 2008, the jury returned guilty verdicts on Stuart Royle, Jetmir Bucpapa, Roger Coutts, Lea Rusha, and Emir Hysenaj. The next day Emir Hysenaj was sentenced to 20 years in prison with an order that he serve a minimum of 10 years. Stuart Royle, Lea Rusha, Jetmir Bucpapa, and Roger Coutts were given life sentences with an order to serve a minimum of 15 years. Prosecutors later decided to drop charges against Kim Shackleton, Raluca Millen and Chris Price, and the girlfriends of Royle, Bucpapa and Rusha respectively. Millen and Philp had been charged with conspiracy to rob, conspiracy to kidnap, and conspiracy to possess firearms. Shackleton had been charged with assisting an offender. John Fowler, on whose property some of the money was found, Michelle Hogg, who made the gang's prosthetic disguises, and Keith Borer were all also acquitted. Since the completion of both Trial I and Trial II, Kayenide 'Kane' Patterson, whom the police and CPS believe to be a key player in both the robbery and kidnapping, still remains missing presumably residing in the West Indies with a large quantity of the stolen money. On 1 June 2010, Murray was jailed in Morocco for ten years for his part in the robbery; the sentence was later increased to 25 years. Kent Police Detective Superintendent Keith Judge said \\"I'm pleased that Murray has now been held accountable.\\" Aftermath Time Inc. announced on 4 August 2008 that they would be making a film about Murray's alleged role in the robbery, based on an article about him in Sports Illustrated called \\"Breaking the Bank\\". In addition to the robbery, the film will also concentrate on his life, including his mixed martial arts career. In February 2013, Malcolm Constable, who was believed by his brother Derek to be associated with the robbery, was found dead of a self-inflicted shotgun wound. Kent Police stated they had no record of any incidents involving Constable. On 11 July 2019, Paul Allen was shot and severely injured at his home in north London ‚Äì a house he was renting from comedian Russell Kane. He was taken to hospital in a critical condition. Similar incidents The 2004 Northern Bank robbery in Belfast, Northern Ireland, was known as the biggest cash robbery in UK history, after ¬£26.4m was seized, a record that has been broken by the Tonbridge raid. The only larger cash robbery in history was in March 2003, when approximately US$1 billion was stolen from the Central Bank of Iraq, shortly after the United States began bombing Baghdad. The raid has also been compared to the Great Train Robbery of 1963, where an inflation-adjusted ¬£40 million was stolen, and the Graffs robbery where nearly ¬£40 million worth of jewels was stolen by two armed men who walked into Graff Diamonds, Bond Street, London, in August 2009.

It straddles the left bank of the Guadalquivir river, and the eastern edge of the marshes known as Las Marismas. According to a 2008 population census, it has 26,046 inhabitants, and has an area surface of 372 km2, making it one of the biggest municipalities in the province. The nearest municipalities are El Cuervo and Las Cabezas de San Juan, in Seville and Trebujena and the city of Jerez de la Frontera in the province of C√°diz. The main productive activity is agriculture, with beet, cotton, wheat and various fruits its main products. Winemaking activities are also prominent with Manzanilla and other finos too. Lebrija is also known for its pottery and earthenware heritage, including b√∫caros. The farmers of this area were the first to cultivate corn brought over from the Americas. History There has been human presence in the area since the Bronze Age, although the founding of Lebrija, possibly did not take place till the Phoenicians arrival, who baptised the settlement as Lepriptza, then to be renamed Nebrissa, during Tartessian times. Originally, it was a port on the shores of the Lacus Ligustinus, a large inner lake surrounded by the Guadalquivir River and its tributaries and coastal sand bars to the South. The lake later filled with sediment, and gradually gave way to the current Guadalviquir marshy lowlands or, in Spanish, las Marismas. Lebrija is also the Nabrissa or Nebrissa, surnamed Veneria, of the Romans; by Silius Italicus. According to local historian Jos√© Bellido, the word \\"veneria\\", (Latin: \\"that which venerates (worships)\\") makes reference to the mythical foundation of Lebrija by the god Dionysus (Bacchus): \\"Where special veneration is given to Bacchus, there where the swift satyres and the menades, at night celebrate the mysteries of that god, with their heads covered up with a deer skin\\".BELLIDO AHUMADA, Jos√© (1971): La Patria de Nebrija (noticia hist√≥rica). Nebrishah was a strong and populous place during the period of Moorish domination (from 711); it was taken by King St Ferdinand in 1249, but again lost, and became finally subject to the Castilian crown only under Alfonso the Wise in 1264. Lebrija was the birthplace of Antonio de Nebrija (1444‚Äì1522), also known as Antonius Nebrissensis, one of the most important Renaissance leaders in Spain, author of the first grammar of a Romance language, the tutor of Queen Isabella, and a collaborator with Cardinal Jim√©nez de Cisneros in the preparation of the Complutensian Polyglot Bible. Lebrija (Lebrixa) as depicted in the Civitates orbis terrarum (c. 1600) Lebrija was granted city status by letters patent in 1924. History of the Jornalero movement In 1903, the first general strike was recorded and documented by Spanish writer Azor√≠n. During the Spanish Second Republic, Lebrija was always a Frente Popular stronghold, as it has been an Anarchist one in the previous century. A process of Agrarian reform was started with some collectivisation of farmsLey de Arrendamientos Colectivos de 1931 and expropriation of land from absentee landlords. This was put to an end with the army rebellion, which led to the Spanish Civil War and ultimately to the Francoist victory. In the 1960s and 1970s, Lebrija, together with Jerez and Mor√≥n de la Frontera, became a focus of Jornalero protests (peasants without land) due to their poor living condition and expectatives. As a result, a regime of \\"communitary work\\", guaranteeing a minimum salary during a few months every year, was established.http://www.ugr.es/~pwlac/G16_08JoseLuis_Solana_Ruiz.html \\"Las clases sociales en Andaluc√≠a.

University of Granada, Spain Shortly after Francisco Franco's death, on 6 January 1976, around one hundred jornaleros locked themselves up in the parish church to express their political demands, only to be removed by the Civil Guard, but not before they have voiced their consigns using the church tower loudspeakers several times: > \\"We want the miscultivated fields and lands to be given to jornaleros and > small owners.

The area has remnants of its Muslim past among its old buildings. Its chief buildings are a ruined Moorish castle and the parish church, Santa Mar√≠a de la Oliva, one of the finest churches in the province of Seville that combines a variety of styles: Mud√©jar, Renaissance and Baroque,Lebrija dating from the 14th century to the 16th, and containing some early specimens of the carving of Alonso Cano (1601‚Äì1667). The campanile tower was inspired by the Giralda, of the Cathedral of Seville, and it is commonly known as \\"La Giraldilla\\" (little Giralda). Santa Mar√≠a de la Oliva was originally a mosque that was reclaimed as a Christian temple in 1249, following the Reconquista. The Casa de la Cultura (Cultural Center) was built in the 18th century in Andalusian Baroque style. Originally, it was used as a wheat silo for the Archbishop of Seville and housing for the local Catholic chapter. The Diezmos and tributes paid by the town people to the church were kept here. In 1982, the Spanish Socialist Workers' Party in charge of Lebrija City Council at the time bought the property and its restoration began. It was reopened in 1986 as the \\"Casa de la Cultura\\", a place dedicated to learning, exhibits, and all sorts of cultural expressions, including dance and music. The Covent and Church of San Francisco (1585) has always been associated to the Franciscan Order. It is located in the Plaza Manuela Murube (also known popularly as El Pilar), one of the most beautiful and artistic corners of Lebrija. In the same square are located the Old Hospital of Mercy (Hospital de la Misericordia) and Saint Andrew's Asylum (Asilo de San Andr√©s). Culture The Cruces de Mayo (Holy Crosses of May) is the most well-known and popular festivity in Lebrija. It is held during the first two weekends of May every year. It is a community activity where each neighborhood raises a cross, either using a permanent buttercross site or building them from scratch using flowers, forged iron or wood. These places around the town are then used for dancing and singing, particularly a local form of Sevillanas, known as Sevillanas corraleras. The local annual fair is dedicated to the patron saint of Lebrija, Our Lady of the Castle, and held around her nameday, on 12 September. The festivity of the J√∫as (Andalusian dialect pronunciation of the name Judas) takes place on Saint John's Eve. Local people get together and make lifesize rag dolls, representing celebrities and local politicians. These rag dolls are left outside of houses so they can be admired by others. At midnight they are set alight, together with a fireworks display, thus ending the festivity. As in Seville and other Andalusian cities, towns, and villages, several hermandades, or religious brotherhoods, march in procession, carrying pasos, lifelike wood or plaster sculptures of individual scenes of the Passion of Jesus Christ or images of the Virgin Mary. Two of the most important hermandades are Los Dolores or El Castillo. Lebrija is a flamenco centre and the Caracol√°, one of the major flamenco festivals in Spain is held there every year in July.

The Cody Scarp has a slope of 5% to 12%. The Cody Scarp runs from just east of the Appalachicola River to Alachua County. It is the boundary over that range between the Gulf Coastal Lowlands and the Northern Highlands of Florida. The Gulf Coast Lowlands have only a thin layer of soil over limestone, while the Northern Highlands consist of plateaus of sand, clay and carbonate rock. The scarp rises about from the Gulf Coastal Lowlands to the Northern Highlands. The Cody Scarp and the Gulf Coastal Lowlands are karst landscapes, with many sinkholes, springs, underground streams, and related features. The scarp, at 42.6 meters (140 feet) to 45.7 meters (150 feet) above sea level, is most prominent in Leon County, Florida where it runs east to west. It is a remnant of two Pleistocene interglacial shorelines. The first shoreline is known as the Okefenokee Terrace. The second is known as the Wicomico Terrace. In Jefferson County to the east, the scarp coincides with the Wicomico Terrace with an elevation at 40‚Äì45 feet above mean sea level. The scarp separates the Hawthorn Group of fine to medium grained sandy clays and silty, clayey sands of the Red Hills Region of north Florida and southwest Georgia to the north from the fine to medium fine grained, partially recrystallized, silty to sandy limestones of the Gulf Coastal Lowlands to the south. A dramatic difference in elevation is seen here as the Red Hills, at a maximum of 70 meters (230 feet) mean sea level (MSL), drops to the area known as the Woodville Karst Plain, an elevation of 50 to 80 feet (15 to 24 meters) within 15 miles (24 km).Welcome to Jefferson County On the Woodville Karst Plain, the Suwannee Limestone of the Floridan Aquifer is shallow and exposed in many places. This is the primary recharge area for Wakulla Springs and where the aquifer is most vulnerable to pollution on the land surface. It is also a zone of high sinkhole activity. In Alachua County, Florida this westward-facing escarpment between an upland plateau to the east and a karst plain to the west has elevations up to 190 feet (57.9 meters) mean sea level (MSL).

It is one of Revueltas's most famous compositions. Poem Guill√©n's poem evokes a ritual Afro-Caribbean chant performed while killing a snake: : : (and so on) The poem \\"Sensemay√°\\" is based on Afro-Cuban religious cults, preserved in the cabildos, self-organized social clubs for the African slaves. African religions were transmitted from generation to generation. These religions, which had a similar but not identical structure, were known as Lucumi or Regla de Ocha if they derived from the Yoruba, Palo or Regla de Congo from the Congo region, Vod√∫ from Haiti, and so on. In this poem we meet an adept known as the mayombero. He is knowledgeable in the area of herbal medicine, as well as being the leader of rituals. In Sensemay√°, the mayombero leads a ritual which offers the sacrifice of a snake to a god, perhaps Babalu Aye. This god, popularized as Babalu in the United States by Desi Arnaz, is the Afro-Cuban spirit who has the power to heal, or spread pestilence. One of the main motives in Sensemay√° is based on this word mayombero. This chant \\"mayombe, bombe mayomb√©\\", is an example of Guill√©n's use of repetition, derived from an actual ceremony. This chant is also the basis for the Inti- Illimani song \\"Canci√≥n para matar una culebra\\". Orchestral composition Revueltas first composed Sensemay√° in Mexico City in 1937, in a version for small orchestra. In 1938, he expanded it into a full-scale orchestral work for 27 wind instruments (woodwinds and brass), 14 percussion instruments, and strings. As one advertising blurb for the score describes it: > The work begins with a slow trill in the bass clarinet as the percussion > plays the sinuous, syncopated rhythm that drives the work. Soon a solo > bassoon enters playing an eerie but rhythmic ostinato bassline. The tuba > then enters playing the first of this work's two major themes, a muscular, > ominous motif. Other brass join in to play the theme, growing louder and > more emphatic, but rigorously yoked to the underlying rhythm. Eventually the > horns blast as loudly as they can, with obsessive trills on the low > clarinets far underneath, and the strings enter with the slashing second > theme. The brass take up this new theme and bring it to a climax, after > which the music returns to its opening texture. This recapitulation brings > with it a mood of foreboding. The rhythm becomes even more obsessive, and > finally the music reaches a massive climax during which both themes are > played, overlapping, sometimes in part and sometimes in whole, by the entire > orchestra in what sounds like a musical riot. The coda feels like the final > dropping of a knife.Anonymous, \\"Silvestre Revueltas: Sensemay√° (score)\\". > Musicroom.com  Instrumentation  The score of the second version of Revueltas's composition calls for a large orchestra consisting of: * woodwinds: 4 flutes (2 doubling piccolos), 2 oboes, an English horn, a piccolo clarinet in E-flat, 2 soprano clarinets in B-flat, a bass clarinet, 3 bassoons, a contrabassoon; * brasses: 4 horns in F, 4 trumpets in C, 3 trombones and a tuba; * timpani and percussion (3 players): xylophone, claves, maracas, raspador, gourd, small Indian drum, bass drum, 2 tom-toms (high and low), cymbals, 2 gongs (large and small), a glockenspiel; * keyboards: a piano, a celesta; * strings: violins (1st and 2nd), violas, violoncellos and basses.

It was located immediately to the west of the City of London. Originally under the control of Westminster Abbey, the local authority for the area was the Westminster Court of Burgesses from 1585 to 1900. The area now forms the southern part of the City of Westminster in Greater London. Governance Following the dissolution of Westminster Abbey, a court of burgesses (the Westminster Court of Burgesses) was formed in 1585 to govern the Westminster area, previously under the Abbey's control. The City and Liberties of Westminster were further defined by Letters Patent in 1604, and the court of burgesses and liberty continued in existence until 1900, and the creation of the Metropolitan Borough of Westminster.Description of the City and Liberties of Westminster in 1819Lewis, Samuel, Topgraphical Dictionary of England, Vol. III, London, 1831 The court of burgesses (or court leet) was headed by the High Steward of Westminster Abbey, who was usually a prominent national politician. He appointed a high bailiff, who served for life, and performed most of the functions usually exercised by a high sheriff of a county. The city and liberty were divided into twelve wards, each with a burgess and assistant burgess, this arrangement being adopted from the system then used in the City of London. Eight wards were located in the parish of St Margaret, three in St Martin in the Fields, and one for St Clement Danes and the Strand area. The burgesses chose two head burgesses, one for the city and one for the liberty, who ranked next after the high bailiff. A high constable was appointed by the court leet, under whom was a force of constables. These were absorbed by the Metropolitan Police in 1829. Following the dissolution of the court of burgesses in 1900, a link has been retained to the old corporation, as the Lord Mayor of Westminster is ex officio Deputy High Steward of Westminster Abbey.History of the Lord Mayoralty of Westminster Westminster returned two members to parliament.

History The city was founded on February 9, 1929, when a group of 18 people founded a Spiritist center called Luz da Verdade. These people had converted to Spiritism after seeing the alleged cure of a medium, Dorcelino Dam√°sio da Silva, who had suffered from a disease called fogo selvagem. In 1953 Palmelo became a municipality separating from Pires do Rio. It is probably the only town in Brazil and in the world where most of the inhabitants are Spiritists.

He previously worked for 16 years as an investigative correspondent at The New York Times, where he was a member of two teams that won Pulitzer Prizes. Life At the Times, Van Natta was on a six-reporter team, led by Jeff Gerth, that won the 1999 Pulitzer Prize for National Reporting for a series of stories about American corporations that sold satellite technology with military value to China. He was one of nine reporters awarded the 2002 Pulitzer Prize for Explanatory Reporting, for work on Al Qaeda following the September 11 attacks. Gerth and Van Natta wrote an investigative biography of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton, entitled, Her Way: The Hopes and Ambitions of Hillary Rodham Clinton, published in June 2007 by Little, Brown and Company. Van Natta was born in Ridgewood, New Jersey and graduated in 1982 from Don Bosco Preparatory High School in Ramsey, New Jersey.\\"Don Van Natta Jr.\\", ESPN. Accessed November 17, 2017. \\"He was born in Ridgewood, NJ, in 1964 and graduated from Don Bosco Prep in Ramsey, NJ and Boston University.\\" He is a 1986 graduate of Boston University, where he won the Scarlet Key, an award given to student leaders. At BU, he served for three semesters as the editor- in-chief of The Daily Free Press, an independent daily newspaper published by students. In 2000, Boston University's College of Communication presented Van Natta with its Distinguished Alumni Award. In 2005, Boston University honored Van Natta as one of its 22 alumni to have won the Pulitzer Prize. At the Times, Van Natta was the first investigative correspondent in the newspaper's history to be posted overseas. He was based in the newspaper's London, England bureau for nearly three years, from January 2003 until September 2005. While at the Times, he has also covered the impeachment of Bill Clinton, the deadlocked 2000 election in Florida, campaign finance and the crash of TWA Flight 800. Since September 11, 2001, Van Natta has covered terrorism and \\"extraordinary rendition,\\" the CIA program that kidnaps terrorism suspects abroad and sends them to third countries, where they are often tortured. In October 2005, Van Natta was one of three reporters to write a 5,800-word article about former Times reporter Judith Miller's 85 days in jail for refusing to testify before a grand jury led by special counsel Patrick Fitzgerald. The article focused in detail on the handling of her case by the Times publisher, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., and top editors at the Times, including executive editor Bill Keller. Prior to joining the Times in July 1995, Van Natta worked for eight years at The Miami Herald, where he was a member of a team of reporters awarded the 1993 Pulitzer Prize for Public Service for coverage of Hurricane Andrew in August 1992. Van Natta was sent by Herald editors to cover the eye of the storm in Florida City in southern Dade County. He stayed in a Comfort Inn, which was destroyed by the 165 m.p.h. winds, and he nearly lost his life. His first-person account of surviving the storm was part of the Herald's Pulitzer winning entry. While at The Herald, he won numerous national, regional and state awards, including the American Bar Association's Silver Gavel and the Investigative Reporters & Editors Gold Medal for an eight-part series called \\"Crime and No Punishment,\\" which revealed Miami had the highest rate of crime but the lowest rate of punishment in America. In April 2003, Van Natta published his first book, First Off the Tee: Presidential Hackers, Duffers and Cheaters from Taft to Bush (Public Affairs, ). The non-fiction book about Presidential golf was a New York Times bestseller, and was also excerpted in the March 24, 2003 edition of Sports Illustrated, and was the cover story in the June 2003 edition of the Observer Sports Monthly in the United Kingdom. First Off the Tee was made into a documentary by the Times Discovery Channel, a show that featured interviews with Arnold Palmer and Gary Player. And the book was also named a Notable Non- Fiction Book by The New York Times and one of the best sports books of the year by Sports Illustrated. Van Natta's latest book, Wonder Girl: The Magnificent Sporting Life of Babe Didrikson Zaharias, was published in 2011 by Little, Brown. The book was not a bestseller, but in 2012 the United States Golf Association awarded \\"Wonder Girl\\" the \\"Herbert Warren Wind Book Award\\" as the top golf book published in 2011. On September 5, 2010, The New York Times published the results of a 6-month investigation led by Van Natta into alleged malpractice at the News of the World, a British newspaper owned by Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation. The News of the World dismissed the allegations as unsubstantiated and said \\"the investigation was tainted by a vested interest in the outcome\\". They also accused The New York Times of flawed reporting and of being motivated by commercial rivalry. In a letter to the Times' Public Editor Arthur Brisbane, The News of the World cited seven breaches of The New York Times' own ethical guidelines on accuracy, use of anonymous sources, bias, impartiality, honest treatment of competitors, reader benefit and conflict of interest. They also questioned the professional detachment of Van Natta, who they claimed had sent a Twitter message linking to a personal attack on News Corp owner Rupert Murdoch alongside a message which read: \\"The Last Great Newspaper War\\". In a blog post following publication of the News of the World story, media commentator Michael Wolff characterised Van Natta as a Times's \\"enforcer\\" and \\"insider, loyalist and gun\\". In his column, Brisbane broadly supported the Times' reporting but conceded that it relied heavily on anonymous sources and that presentation of the story and gratuitous references to Murdoch could leave room for suspicions of a \\"hidden agenda\\". Personal Don Van Natta lives in Coral Gables, Florida with his wife, Lizette Alvarez, a New York Times correspondent, and their two daughters. He is a frequent player of Dominoes in South Florida, and frequently plays with Billy Gil of ESPN Radio Miami, amongst others.

The original occupiers of the ground were Croydon Common F.C., the Robins, who occupied it from 1908 to 1917. It was also the home ground of Crystal Palace F.C. from 1918 until 1924. The Nest was subleased from the London Brighton and South Coast Railway, the parties being The Croydon Common Football and Athletic Company Limited and then Crystal Palace Football and Athletic Club, The London Brighton and South Coast Railway Company and the Ecclesiastical Commissioners for England. The reason for three parties to this lease was that the Church Commissioners actually owned the land, the Railway had leased it from them and thus the club was subleasing it from the Railway. The lease stipulated that the ground could only be used for soccer or athletics or for \\"the holding of Flower Shows and School treats\\". As the ground was owned by the Church, the lease also prohibited its use for any purposes on Good Friday and Christmas Day and so the club played only away fixtures on these particular days. The 1872 1:10,560 Ordnance Survey Map merely shows the land as being \\"Selhurst Wood\\" prior to the ground being formed. The ground was quite basic, having only small earth banks around the major part of its circumference. These banks were topped by bushes known to the supporters as \\"The Jungle\\". When Croydon Common FC took over The Nest there was a small stand with seats on the northern side of the ground, but this burned down shortly afterwards. A new stand, significantly longer than the previous one (approximately 75 metres long), was erected to replace it. This stand consisted of an elevated tier with seven rows of seating, achieving an approximate capacity of 1500 seats, and a small standing paddock at the front. The roof had a small triangular white painted gable in its centre. In addition to the dressing rooms, there were a number of stores, rooms and offices under this grandstand. A cinder athletics track ran around the pitch. The name of \\"The Nest\\" came about because the first club to occupy it were Croydon Common FC ‚Äì they wore red shirts and were nicknamed \\"The Robins\\", hence their ground being known as \\"The Nest\\". It typically held a maximum of 20,000 supporters. Crystal Palace The club moved to The Nest in 1918, having spent four years at the Herne Hill Athletics Stadium and gained promotion in the 1920‚Äì21 season by winning the Division Three championship (later to become known as Division 3 (South)). There is no connection between the Crystal Palace nickname 'The Eagles' and the name of this former ground ‚Äì the nickname only coming about in the 1970s via the flamboyant manager Malcolm Allison. In 1924, the club bought a new state-of-the-art ground, Selhurst Park, which would be their home into the next century. Crystal Palace then sublet the ground to Tramways F.C., a railway workers football club. During the time that Crystal Palace played League football at The Nest, it was common for many spectators to purchase a platform ticket at the adjoining Selhurst Station, and watch matches from Platform 1, as this was cheaper than the match admission price and afforded an elevated clear view of all of the ground. The site of The Nest is now a train depot for the rail company Southern. The only confirmed remaining trace of the ground is the front boundary wall along Selhurst Road, opposite the railway station. There is some conjecture amongst historians regarding whether or not the shell of the grandstand remains (minus its original roof), as a brick building operating as stores for the railway depot exists in the same position (in which the number of rooms within this building matches exactly the number of rooms under the grandstand as described on the football club leases). This building also displays an interesting feature on its side walls, namely possible steps from what would have been the seating tier. This structure curiously also possesses a quite substantial chimney, which would have to have been subsequently added. References Category:Crystal Palace F.C. Category:Croydon Common F.C.

History Like many of the farms on the adjacent Oxnard Plain, the crops of corn, wheat and barley grown here were shipped through the wharf that had been constructed in Hueneme in 1871. Agricultural products were able to be shipped by rail when the line from Los Angeles to San Francisco was routed through the valley and a stop was established adjacent to the community. The current spelling of the name was established when the railroad came through.

Randy played Junior Hockey in Ontario, before going pro with the Broome Dusters (Binghamton, NY) of the North American Hockey League in 1973. He skated much of his professional career in Binghamton. Randy would make the transition with the Dusters in 1977 into the American Hockey League. The Dusters became the Whalers in 1980 and Randy would spend part of the 1980‚Äì81 season in Klagenfurt, Austria. He would return to Binghamton later that season, but would end his career in 1984 in Glens Falls, NY with the Adirondack Red Wings. Following his playing days, Randy returned to his adopted hometown of Binghamton. He is a contractor and has been a hockey coach with the Southern Tier Hockey Association and Syracuse Stars minor hockey systems. Randy continues to reside in the area; now calling Vestal home. He has two adult sons Justin and Dillon. Awards In 1984, Randy MacGregor's #11 became the only jersey in Binghamton Hockey History to be retired to the rafters. (It was unretired by the Rangers' organization in 1991) In 1998, Randy MacGregor was the first player inducted into the Binghamton Hockey Hall of Fame.

In many states Precinct Captains are also eligible to establish party unit committees for fundraising. It is a grassroots position with officials generally serving as volunteers, though in some states they receive a stipend. Positions of county captain have also been created, but are usually used for election campaigns rather than party organizing.

She lives in Swift Current, Saskatchewan.  Curling career  Schafer made her international curling debut competing at the 1999 World Junior Championships, representing Scotland and the Letham Grange Ice Rink. With Schafer leading the team as skip, they finished a respectable fifth position. Schafer was skip for Team Scotland at the World Juniors two more times, in 2001 and 2002. Both years the team again finished fifth. Scotland's curling dominance over the two other host nations of Great Britain secured its place at the 2006 Winter Olympics in Turin, Italy. Schafer was shortlisted along with nine other female curlers to be considered for a place on the women's Olympic team and became successful to travel to Turin to defend Rhona Martin's Olympic gold that Team GB won in Salt Lake City in 2002. She joined Rhona Martin, Lynn Cameron, Jackie Lockhart and Debbie Knox. As in her other international games, Shaefer played second throughout the Olympic competition. However, despite beating U.S. 10‚Äì4 after only six ends, Team GB's Olympic hopes were shattered as Canada beat Denmark in a nail-biting match in the final end. A win over Canada by Denmark would have enabled Great Britain to go into a playoff to compete for the last semi-final position. When interviewed after the game Kelly conceded Team GB's loss was \\"gutting\\" but added \\"we [Team GB] have to take the positives out of this.\\" Schafer won her first medal at an international event at the 2007 World Women's Curling Championship. She skipped Scotland with teammates Jackie Lockhart, Lorna Vevers, Lindsay Wood and Karen Addison. Scotland won the bronze medal by losing in the semi-final to Denmark, skipped by Angelina Jensen. Schafer returned to the Olympics in 2010, again playing second but this time for skip Eve Muirhead. Team Great Britain finished 7th with a record of 3-6. A month after the Olympics Schafer again played with Muirhead, this time as third at the 2010 World Championships. Team Scotland played Germany in the final, settling for the silver medal after giving up two points in an extra end. Though she no longer lives in Scotland, Schafer has been a frequent alternate for Team Scotland, including at the 2012 World Championships in Lethbridge, Alberta, the 2017 World Championships in Beijing, China, and for Great Britain in the 2018 Winter Olympics. Although not a Canadian citizen, Schafer played for Saskatchewan at the 2014 and 2020 Canadian Mixed Curling Championship.  Personal life  While representing Scotland at the 2010 World Championships in Swift Current, Kelly Wood met the mayor, Jerrod Schafer, and a romance developed. She would later move to the town. Kelly and Jerrod Schafer married in 2013.

Originally recorded on 11 November 1971 during the sessions for his 1972 album The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and the Spiders from Mars, the song was left off the album and subsequently released as a B-side (along with \\"Changes\\") of the UK re-release of \\"Space Oddity\\" in 1975, which went to number 1 in the UK singles charts and gave Bowie his first UK chart topper. Bowie, who had moved to LA at the time of the release said later of the song's inclusion \\"The whole thing came out without my having a chance to listen to the mix. Somebody else had mixed it ‚Äì an extraordinary move\\". The song was originally titled and demoed as \\"He's a Goldmine\\". A mid-tempo rock song, it very much fitted in with the heavier cuts on Ziggy and contains the usual craftsmanship of Mick Ronson's Les Paul signature guitar licks. In a radio interview in 1972 (prior to it being dropped from the album) Bowie said he felt \\"Velvet Goldmine\\" was a \\"lovely thing\\" and \\"very David Bowie\\". Although it was originally thought that Bowie wrote the song as a description of him making out with another man, it was claimed by Bowie in 1990 that he was writing in the third person and talking to/worshipping Ziggy Stardust through a groupie's eyes: \\"You got crazy legs, you got amazing head, You got rings on your fingers and your hair's hot red...\\" Social pressures and RCA's managerial stance against suggestive or provocative lyrics at the time resulted in Bowie rewriting the song to be slightly more ambiguous compared to the demo, although it was still considered too risqu√© a song (even after watering down the lyrics) to be released in 1972. \\"You're my taste, my trip, I'll be your master zip, I'll suck your hair for kicks, you make me jump to my feet, So gimee your hand, gimee your sound, Let my seed wash your face, I'm falling up, I can't stand...\\" A similar fate befell \\"Sweet Head\\", another rocker with sexual lyrics that was dropped from Ziggy in favour of a cover of Ron Davies' \\"It Ain't Easy\\". The song title inspired the name of the 1998 film Velvet Goldmine starring Jonathan Rhys-Myers but Bowie refused to license the song to the film makers after reading the script and realising it was a blatant parody of his Ziggy Stardust character. Despite being originally only released as a B-side, this song has become very popular amongst fans and has subsequently appeared on several \\"best of\\" compilations. The structure and chords at the end of the song (the melodious humming through to fade out) were later borrowed for Bowie's 1978 \\"Revolutionary Song\\" which he wrote for the Just a Gigolo movie and soundtrack under the name \\"The Rebels\\". Other releases * The song was included on the 1982 vinyl compilation Rare. * In 1990, the song was released as a bonus track on the Rykodisc CD release of the Ziggy Stardust album.

It is one of the oldest cycling tracks in the world, having been built in 1891. It hosted the track cycling events in the 1948 Summer Olympics and was briefly the home of Crystal Palace Football Club during World War I.1948 Summer Olympics official report. pp. 43‚Äì4. Between 1987, when the track at Paddington Recreation Ground was demolished, and 2011, when the London Velopark for the 2012 Summer Olympics opened, Herne Hill was the only track in London. History Herne Hill was originally named the London County Grounds,http://www.urban75.org/london/velodrome1.html The Herne Hill Velodrome ‚Äì fighting for survival. the track of the London County Cycling and Athletic Club.The Bicycle, 22 April 1942, p12 It became popularly known as Herne Hill track or velodrome after its position just off Burbage Road, in Herne Hill, part of the London Borough of Southwark. The velodrome was founded by George Hillier, an amateur racer, in 1891. Before then the leading venue had been at nearby Crystal Palace. Crystal Palace, however, had no banking and a poor surface and supporters favoured a track which opened north of the Thames in Paddington, in 1888. Hillier had been a leading light at Crystal Palace and tried to persuade the owners, the Crystal Palace Company, to win back the supporters and racers by redesigning the track. The company declined and Hillier looked for a new site south of the Thames. He found an area off Burbage Road in Herne Hill and leased it from Dulwich College Trustees. Work on the new track was undertaken by W. and J. Peacock, a building company sympathetic to cycling. It started in September 1890 and finished, ahead of schedule, in March 1891. The first race, open only to members of the Herne Hill club, was on 16 April 1891. The first open meeting was on 23 May that same year. The circuit was designed with 5 ft bankings which were later raised. The original surface was red shale, which needed repeated rolling. It was replaced in 1893 by wooden slats, which led to fast racing but frequent crashes after rain. Concrete was laid instead in 1896. Many records were beaten on the track, which reached a peak of popularity with the Cuca Cup 24-hour races at the end of the 19th century. Good Friday meetings From 1903 it was the venue for the Good Friday meetinghttps://www.theguardian.com/sport/blog/2010/sep/21/herne- hill-1948-london-olympics organised by the Southern Counties Cycle Union. World champions have performed at Good Friday meetings, which during the 1920s and 1930s attracted attendances of 10,000.[broken link] British Cycling website feature on Herne Hill National and world records have been established there ‚Äì Norwood Paragon's Frank Southall was a notable record-breaker in the late 1920s and early 1930s. In 1936 the tandem pairing from Addiscombe C.C. - Ernie Mills and Bill Paul set a world best of 30 miles 793 yards, unpaced in one hour, although no tandem figures were recognised by the governing body at that time.The Golden Book of Cycling - Mills & Paul, 1937 The deterioration of the velodrome and poor weather resulting in the cancellation of the 2010 meeting led to the promoters relocating the event to Manchester Velodrome for 2011. Subsequently, the promoters announced that the meeting would be moved to London Velopark from 2014. Despite this plans for a new Good Friday meeting at Herne Hill were released, focusing on inter-schools racing, disability cycling, women-only groups, under-eights and over-40s. War and the Olympics The National Cyclists Union leased Herne Hill for 21 years from 25 March 1942.The Bicycle, UK, 5 April 1944, p3 It had been damaged during the war when the site was used for a gun battery. Weeds grew waist-high through cracks in the surface and along the track's edges by 1942.The Bicycle, 23 September 1942, p15 A. P. Chamberlin, secretary of the NCU, said: \\"The crevices between the concrete slabs of the track are covered with all kinds of growth, and I found it impossible to uproot small trees that were growing. In the back straight a luxurious grape vine has assumed interesting proportions.\\"The Bicycle, UK, 30 September 1942, p15 Work started that year to restore it to make it ready by 1943. The organising committee of the 1948 Olympic Games chose it as \\"the only suitable\\" track.The Official Report of the Organising Committee for the XIV Olympiad (1948), published by the organising committee, London, p43 It said \\"considerable work would have to be carried out to bring the arena, both from a competition and a spectator point of view, up to the required standard for Olympic events.\\" The track was repaired, permanent stands were built - the only permanent construction work carried out by the Games organisersThe Official Report of the Organising Committee for the XIV Olympiad (1948), published by the organising committee, London, p44 \\\\- and the approach roads and turnstiles were improved and extended. A temporary stand was built in the back straight for journalists, who had 12 telephone boxes to report to the world. A small scoreboard was also put up,The Official Report of the Organising Committee for the XIV Olympiad (1948), published by the organising committee, London, p53 which the crowd \\"fully appreciated.\\"The Official Report of the Organising Committee for the XIV Olympiad (1948), published by the organising committee, London, p317 The cycling press said it was disappointed that the Games opened at Herne Hill without ceremony: > What a strange nation we British are! The greatest cycling festival of this > century‚Äîthe XIVth Olympiad‚Äîmight well have been an ordinary track promotion > on the opening day at Herne Hill. Greatest oversight was the omission of any > form of opening ceremony.

To put two tandems on the track under such conditions was a > disgrace.The Bicycle, UK, 18 August 1948, p. 6 The light was so poor that the photo-finish camera did not work and judges told photographers not to use flash for fear of harming both their and the racers' night vision. Professional circus The National Cyclists' Union opened what became known as a professional circus there in May 1952, under the track's manager, John Dennis.The Bicycle, UK, 16 January 1952, p12 The plan was to bring crowds to the track, making it profitable, and to establish professional racing in Britain. Among those who took professional licenses was a prominent road rider, Dave Bedwell Survival The track held meetings featuring star internationals such as Jacques Anquetil, Fausto Coppi, Reg Harris and Tom Simpson during the 1950s and 1960s. The future of the track then became less certain. A campaign was fought to retain it during the early 2000s following a dispute between the landlord, Dulwich Estate, and the leaseholder, Southwark Council. A feature, said the journalist Richard Williams, was \\"a lease long enough to make it worthwhile to undertake the necessary refurbishment of the grandstand, which is closed for safety reasons, and the 450‚Äëmetre track itself.\\" Bill Wright of British Cycling, formed by the merger of the National Cyclists Union with the British League of Racing Cyclists in the 1950s, said: \\"The problem is that the venue is underfunded and deteriorating, and desperately in need of refurbishment but cannot get the investment it needs unless landlords Dulwich Estate renew their lease, something Dulwich Estate is reluctant to do. The estate, which also owns the land of some of the area‚Äôs prestigious public schools such as Dulwich College and Alleyn's School, is legally required to get the best return on its investment for benefactors. However, it also has a commitment to community upkeep.\\"Cited http://www.eastlondonlines.co.uk/2010/09/from-hackney-to-herne- hill-campaign-to-save-olympic-velodrome/ A supporter of the campaign was Olympic gold medallist Bradley Wiggins, who started racing at Herne Hill when he was 12.Cited Bradley Wiggins, \\"Looking down from Herne Hill, I can see the future is bright\\", Guardian, 8 April 2007, https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2007/apr/08/cycling.news The campaign has also attracted support from British racing cyclists Victoria Pendleton and Ben Swift, as well as local residents Jo Brand and James Nesbitt. Structures and facilities Unlike a modern Olympic velodrome (which will have an inner circumference of 250m, and banking of about 45¬∞), Herne Hill is a shallow concrete bowl measuring approximately 450m with the steepest banking 18¬∞. The grandstand shown in this photo is the original one dating from 1891, it has now (2016) been demolished and replaced with a new structure. In the 1890s there was a cinder athletics track inside the cycle track, and tennis courts within that. The tennis courts later became the site of a football/rugby pitch, but the track centre is now only used for cyclo-cross races. Other uses The Velodrome was home of Crystal Palace F.C. from 1914 until 1918, when the club then moved to The Nest opposite Selhurst Station. Crystal Palace were forced by the Admiralty to leave Crystal Palace Football Stadium and move to the Velodrome due to the Crystal Palace being commandeered for World War I training purposes. Typically Crystal Palace FC drew crowds of 3,000 ‚Äì 4,000. The FA Amateur Cup final in 1911, between Bromley and Bishop Auckland, was also played at Herne Hill as well as the Surrey Senior Cup finals in 1906 and 1909. London Welsh Rugby Club had their home at the Velodrome for 40 years after World War I, until moving to a new home in Old Deer Park in Richmond in 1957. Regeneration As part of the Southwark Olympic Legacy Project work began on the upgrade of the Velodrome in February 2013. The first phase included the construction of a new Junior 250m track, a hardstanding area for warming up and to hold activities like bike-ability, bike polo and non conventional bikes (e.g. handbikes and other cycles used by Wheels for Wellbeing) and installation of floodlights for longer training sessions in the winter. A ¬£200,000 grant from British Cycling allowed the track to be resurfaced, and ¬£1.5 million was secured from Sport England and the London Marathon Trust for the construction of a new pavilion, which began in April 2016 and was completed in 2017. The pavilion, designed by Mike Taylor of Hopkins Architects (who also designed the London Olympic Velodrome), was opened in March 2017 with a ribbon-cutting ceremony carried out by Union Cycliste Internationale President Brian Cookson.

She used the phrase in a speech to describe a year in which one of her four children was divorced, two more formally separated from their spouses, and Windsor Castle caught fire. Family background Ford was a fraternal twin. His family has strong connections with the Anglican church and with cricket. His father was the Very Reverend Lionel Ford, headmaster of Repton and later of Harrow, and Dean of York from 1926 to 1932; his mother Mary Catherine was a daughter of the Right Reverend Edward Stuart Talbot, Bishop of Winchester, and education campaigner Lavinia Lyttelton; an uncle was Neville Stuart Talbot Bishop of Pretoria; another uncle was a royal chaplain. His brother Neville Ford played cricket for Derbyshire, and three of his uncles played first-class cricket, including Francis Ford who played for England. Education Ford was at West Downs School and was then a King's Scholar at Eton. He won an open scholarship to read Classics at New College, Oxford (where he was elected an Honorary Fellow in 1982). He obtained a first in Mods and second in Greats. Career He was tutor to John Lascelles, son of Sir Alan Lascelles, Private Secretary to King George VI, in 1933. He was a Harmsworth scholar at Middle Temple, before tutoring Prince (later King) Farouk of Egypt from 1935-36\\\\. He was called to the Bar in 1937 and briefly practised law until 1939. Military service Ford had been commissioned as a second lieutenant in supplementary reserve of the Grenadier Guards in 1936, and promoted to first lieutenant in 1939. He fought in World War II in France and Belgium, being evacuated from Dunkirk, and in Tunisia and Italy, and was mentioned in despatches twice. He was brigade major of the 10th Infantry Brigade and later of the 24th Guards Brigade, and was an instructor at the Staff College in Haifa. After the war, at the invitation of Sir Alan Lascelles, he entered Royal Service as Assistant Private Secretary to King George VI, 1946-52, and then served in the same office to Elizabeth II until 1967. Ford was telephoned by the King's Private Secretary, Sir Alan Lascelles, with news of the King's death at Sandringham in February 1952, and Ford broke the news to the Prime Minister, Sir Winston Churchill, at 10 Downing Street and then to Queen Mary, the King's mother, at Marlborough House. He was an Extra Equerry to the Queen from 1955 until his death. He became a close friend of Group Captain Peter Townsend, an equerry whose love affair with Princess Margaret causes a crisis early in Queen Elizabeth's reign. Resignation Ford resigned from the Royal Household in 1967, after Sir Michael Adeane, Lascelles' successor, asked him to move to the household of the Prince of Wales to make way for the younger Philip Moore. He was secretary of the Pilgrim Trust from 1967 to 1975, and also managed the estate of his late father-in-law, Lord Brand, at Eydon Hall in Northamptonshire. Later, he was Secretary and Registrar of the Order of Merit (for which he received an honorarium of ¬£100) from 1975-2003\\\\. Annus Horribilis Ford used the Latin phrase \\"annus horribilis\\" in a sympathetic letter to the Queen in 1992, after a series of unfortunate events, including a major fire in Windsor Castle. In a later television documentary to mark the 40th anniversary of the Queen's accession, Ford chided himself for a grammatical error, saying that, in order to describe a horrible year, he properly should have written \\"annus horrendus\\". The Queen later used the phrase in a speech: \\"1992 is not a year on which I shall look back with undiluted pleasure. In the words of one of my more sympathetic correspondents, it has turned out to be an 'Annus Horribilis'.\\" Honors For his service to the Crown, Edward Ford was appointed Member of the Royal Victorian Order (MVO) in 1949, Companion of the Order of the Bath (CB) in 1952, knighted as Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO) in 1957, advanced to Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB) in 1967 and promoted to the Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO) in 1998. He received the Emergency Reserve Decoration (ERD) in 1987, having long served as a reserve officer, and reaching the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel. He was also a fellow of the Royal Society of Arts, served as Deputy Lieutenant of Northamptonshire (DL) and High Sheriff of Northamptonshire. He was Prime Warden of the Goldsmiths' Company in 1979. He was the literary executor of Sir Alan Lascelles. Despite the sensitive nature of their contents, he managed to secure permission for Sir Alan's wartime diaries to be published. King's Counsellor was launched in 2006, a few weeks before his death. Personal life He married his wife, Virginia, in 1949, the widow of John Metcalfe Polk. She was the daughter of the banker Robert Henry Brand, 1st Baron Brand and Phyllis Langhorne, a sister of Nancy Astor. His wife died in 1995. Death He died in London, survived by their two sons and a stepson. A second stepson predeceased him.

It belongs to the Naskapi Nation of Kawawachikamach. The village was built by the Naskapi/Iyiyiw from 1980 to 1983. The language spoken is Iyiyiw-Imuun, a dialect closely related to Innu and Iynu (East Cree). The name means \\"the winding river\\". Access to the village is by way of Schefferville Airport or railway from Sept-√éles to Schefferville, then by way of a road from the centre of Schefferville. With the demise of Schefferville as a residential centre for the iron ore mining operations, Kawawachikamach and Matim√©kush are now the main communities in the region. Telephone and postal services are still provided from the Schefferville exchange by Telebec and from the Schefferville Post Office, while electricity is provided by the Schefferville Power Company. The Naskapi/Iyiyiw provide their own policing services. Sichuun provides Internet, VoIP, cellular and IPTV services to the Kawawachikamach/Schefferville region. Other services include a community radio station, a healthcare centre, a recreation centre and a gymnasium. Legal status Its formal legal status is a Naskapi Reserved Land (terre r√©serv√©e naskapie, category 1-AN, under federal jurisdiction). There is also a separate, non-contiguous Naskapi Village Municipality (municipalit√© de village naskapie, category 1-BN, under provincial jurisdiction) of the same name, some distance to the north. The entire population lives on the Reserved Land; despite its title, the Naskapi Village Municipality of Kawawachikamach has no resident population and is for the exclusive use of Naskapi for hunting or other activities. The Naskapi Reserved Land is south of the 55th parallel and is geographically located within the Caniapiscau Regional County Municipality of the C√¥te-Nord region of Quebec, although not juridically a part of it; the Naskapi Village Municipality is north of 55 and is within the Kativik Territory. The Commission de toponymie du Qu√©bec, perhaps a bit confusingly, refers to the Naskapi Reserved Land as a \\"Naskapi village\\" (village naskapi) and the Naskapi Village Municipality as a \\"Naskapi village municipality\\" (municipalit√© de village naskapi), making a careful distinction between the two. However, from a practical point of view it seems intuitive that the \\"village\\" is where the population lives. History The Naskapi of Kawawachikamach were originally from northern Quebec, but were subjected to relocations several times before moving from Fort Chimo to Schefferville in 1956. Government officials may have induced or ordered this move but did nothing in preparation for their arrival in Schefferville. The Naskapi settled near the airport in shacks built with scavenged materials, but they were relocated again by the Schefferville municipal authorities to a site on John Lake, where they lived in poverty without water, sewage, electricity, schools, and medical facility. In 1968, the Matimekosh Reserve was formed, and the Naskapi moved there in 1972, together with the Innu. In the 1970s, the Naskapi began negotiations for a settlement of their Aboriginal claims. In 1978, they ceded any rights or interests to the Matimekosh Reserve as a prerequisite to the Northeastern Qu√©bec Agreement that provided for the formation of their own reserve. As part of this agreement's implementation, of land was transferred from the Government of Quebec to the Government of Canada for the exclusive benefit of the Naskapi band in 1981. By 1983, the first residents settled in the village that was specifically adapted to the environment.Natural Resources Canada - Legal Surveys Division, Historical Review - Kawawachikamach land title history Demographics As of December 2009, the band counted 690 members, of which 639 persons are living in the community.

It is an annual event, spanning eleven days mid-August.  History  The G√§ubodenvolksfest was founded in the year 1812 by Maximilian I Joseph, King of Bavaria, as an agricultural festival to foster an annual gathering of the people in the Danube region.  Description  The G√§ubodenvolksfest is a modern and family-friendly festival with several attractions, including carousels and roller coasters. There are also several large beer tents that span a 100,000 m¬≤ area. The event has maintained the historic character of Bavarian festivals, and attracts approximately 1.4 million visitors every year. Many visitors wear traditional Bavarian clothing (\\"Trachten\\") for the occasion. The festival combines Bavarian tradition with progress and vitality. It is one of Bavaria's oldest and most popular festivals and it has increased to one of the biggest events in Germany. Beer plays a central role in the fair. The beer is specially brewed, and only breweries from Straubing or the district Straubing-Bogen are allowed to serve beer there. On the first day of the festival there is a \\"Bierprobe\\", which means \\"beer tasting,\\" followed by a parade with consisting of people wearing Bavarian native attire walking on foot, riding horses, or in horse carriages. On the second day there is the official opening with a representative of the Bavarian or German government. The festival is held every year in the middle of August and lasts 11 days. The festival is celebrated by the whole city as a \\"fifth season\\", and many companies are closed down during this time.

It took 18 years before it was eventually released and it first appeared on the Rykodisc CD release of Ziggy Stardust in 1990. Its release came as a complete surprise to even the most die-hard Bowie fans and collectors who were totally unaware of the track prior to its issue. Even co-producer Ken Scott had forgotten about its existence and admitted his utter surprise upon its release. It then appeared on the 30th Anniversary Reissue bonus disc of Ziggy Stardust in 2002 and again in 2012 for the 40th Anniversary (this time with a jokey 30 second studio discussion between Bowie and the band). Though originally written for The Rise and Fall of Ziggy Stardust and The Spiders of Mars (the lyrics refer to \\"brother Ziggy\\"), it was considered too provocative to be released on the original album by the A&R; team at RCA. The song's lyrics contain references to the then recently released film A Clockwork Orange as well as strong innuendo, racist name- calling and directly references oral sex. \\"It was about oral sex, and it was one I don't think RCA particularly wanted\\", Bowie told Musician in 1990.

Traditional Samoan dancing is one area of the culture that has been the least affected by western civilisation. It requires the dancer to retain grace; movement of the arms and hands are done so in a subtle but delicate manner. In earlier times, high chiefs or matais performed this special dance but modern day it is performed by a taupou. A version of Siva Samoa, called Mak Sa'moa, is a popular traditional dance style in Western Samoa. Other forms of traditional Samoan dancing include the taualuga, siva afi, and sasa.

It is the Mother Church of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Savannah. History The colonial charter of Savannah prohibited Roman Catholics from settling in the city. The English trustees feared that Catholics would be more loyal to the Spanish authorities in Florida than to the English government in Georgia, however this prohibition faded shortly after the American Revolution. The church's congregation was reorganized about 1796. French Catholic √©migr√©s established the first church in 1799 after they fled Haiti after slave rebellions that began on the Caribbean island in 1791. It became the main church for free blacks from Haiti in the early 19th century. Construction began on the new Cathedral of St. John the Baptist in 1859. The structure was nearly destroyed by fire in 1898 but through diligent effort was rebuilt by 1899. The Cathedral Basilica of St. John the Baptist was the first building in Georgia constructed of brick. It features 81 stained glass windows, 16 gargoyles, is 214 feet tall with a roof height of 96 feet, took over 90,000 copper nails and 45,000 slates to construct. The congregation constructed its first church on Liberty Square in 1779 and in 1811, choose a site on Drayton and Perry Streets for a larger building. Bishop John England of the Diocese of Charleston, which encompassed Savannah, consecrated the new church April 1, 1839. Pope Pius IX established the Diocese of Savannah in July 1850 and the congregation began to plan for a new cathedral on Lafayette Square in 1870 under Savannah's fourth Bishop, The Right Reverend Ignatius Persico. Most Reverend James Roosevelt Bayley, Archbishop of Baltimore, presided at the dedication of the Neo-Gothic sanctuary April 30, 1876. However, the brick structure lacked spires which were not added until 1896 when it also received a coating of stucco and whitewash. On February 6, 1898, a fire swept the building and left only the walls and towers, however the congregation quickly rebuilt and was able to celebrate Christmas Mass in the new facility in 1899. But again, the structure was not complete and interior decoration took an additional 13 years. Stained glass windows were installed around 1904. The parish undertook subsequent renovation projects in 1959-1965, which addressed heating, cooling and lighting systems and decoration; 1984-1985, to reinforce structural foundations and implement changes suggested by the Second Vatican Council and 1998-2000 to install new roofing, and restore the original interior color palette and decorations. Pope Francis elevated the status of the church to minor basilica in 2020.

It is produced synthetically by converting p-aminobenzamide into the corresponding diazonium compound followed by diazotation with 3-hydroxy-2-naphththoic acid (2-ethoxy)anilide (\\"Naphtol AS-PH\\" dye precursor). :Synthesis of Pigment red 170 In the solid state the hydrazo tautomer forms and several crystal structures exist. In the initial Œ± polymorph the molecules are arranged in a herringbone pattern with extensive hydrogen bonding. The œÜ polymorph is more dense and more stable and produced industrially by thermal treatment in water at 130¬∞C under pressure. In this phase the molecules are planar and arranged in layers. Extensive hydrogen bonding exists within the layer but between layers the only interactions are Van der Waals forces. Dense crystal structures are preferred for pigments used in coatings because in the event of photochemical decomposition the fragments are locked in place and are able to recombine. Research shows that by replacing the ethoxy group in this compound by a methoxy group the crystal structure is less stable and in the final application and the color fades more easily. By careful selection of substituents it is possible to optimize crystal structure and improve optical properties .

Before Berlin's 2001 administrative reform, Wei√üensee was a borough in its own right, consisting of the localities of Wei√üensee, Heinersdorf, Blankenburg, Karow and Stadtrandsiedlung Malchow. A fictional German-language TV series by the same name is set in the borough between 1980 and 1990 during the communist era. History Wei√üensee was first mentioned in 1313 as Wittense. The first settlers subsisted on fishing and established themselves on the eastern shore of the lake, where an old trade route connected Berlin with Szczecin (Stettin) and the Baltic Sea ‚Äì today the Bundesstra√üe 2 federal highway. From 1914 onwards, the Weissensee Studios produced a number of silent films including works by Fritz Lang and the expressionist film The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari. As Berlin's least inhabited district, it has been overshadowed historically by its neighboring boroughs Prenzlauer Berg and Pankow. However its popularity is increasing due to its proximity to the hip but expensive Prenzlauer Berg. Its trams make reaching Mitte very convenient. Overview Wei√üensee is appreciated as a good choice for people seeking for a balance between urban life and seclusion in a peaceful district of Berlin. The immediate area around the lake Wei√üer See is characterized by its historical architecture, numerous places of interest, parks, lakes and activities. The art school Kunsthochschule Berlin-Wei√üensee Wei%C3%9Fensee Academy of Art Berlin is of national rank. The Radrennbahn Wei√üensee cycling track has also hosted popular music concerts. The largest concert ever held here was a Bruce Springsteen concert on July 19, 1988. Springsteen played before an estimated crowd of 300,000. At Wei√üensee Cemetery, one of Europe's largest Jewish cemeteries, notable people like the painter Lesser Ury and the publishers Samuel Fischer and Rudolf Mosse are buried.

The Court held that the plebiscites were a valid exercises of the province's power to legislate on matters \\"of a local nature\\" under section 92(16) of the Constitution Act, 1867, and that the plebiscite did not violate the rights of the VLT owners under sections 2(b), 7 and 15(1) of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms. Background In 1998, the town of Winkler, Manitoba held a non-binding plebiscite in which it was decided to ban VLTs from the community. In 1999, the province of Manitoba passed the Gaming Control Local Option Act (known as the \\"VLT Act\\") which allowed municipalities to hold binding plebiscites to ban VLTs. The VLT Act contained a provision in section 16 which made the Winkler plebiscite binding which resulted in the Winkler Inn, owned by the Siemens, to shut down its VLT facilities. The Siemens challenged the VLT Act on the ground that section 16 was ultra vires the power of the provincial government's authority as it was a matter under the federal criminal law power, and that it violated their right to freedom of expression under section 2(b) of the Charter, their right to life, liberty, and security of person under section 7 of the Charter, and their right to equality under section 15(1) of the Charter. The motions judge rejected the claims which was upheld by the Court of Appeal. Justice Major, writing for a unanimous Court, held that the Act was a valid exercise of the provincial law-making power and it did not violate any section of the Charter. Opinion of the court Major first considered the issue of whether section 16 was validly enacted. He examined the pith and substance of both the legislation and the impugned provision. The purpose of section 16 of the Act was to prohibit VLTs in the town of Winkler and to cancel all existing \\"siteholder agreements\\" for those with VLTs in their establishment. Based on the legislative debates, the section was used to give effect to plebiscite that had already been held. The purpose of the Act as a whole was \\"to allow municipalities to express, by binding plebiscite, whether they wish VLTs to be permitted or prohibited within their communities.\\" The regulation of gaming and the allowance of local input both fall under section 92 of the Constitution Act, 1867. Section 16, which cancels \\"siteholder agreements\\" concerns property and civil rights which is a provincial power under section 92(13) of the Constitution Act, 1867. The Act as a whole gives power to the community to regulate VLTs consequently is considered a matter of a local nature under section 92(16). Major rejected the argument that the law was a \\"colourable\\" attempt to enact criminal law. The Act did not contain the penal consequences required for valid criminal law nor was there a criminal law purpose for the Act. The moral aspect to the law was only incidental to the regulatory scheme. Major rejected all of the Charter arguments. First, he dismissed the section 2 argument because although voting is a form of expression that is protected under the Charter it does not however include voting in a referendum as it was a creation of a statute. Second, he dismissed the section 7 argument as it has been well established that economic interests are not protected by the Charter and are not found within section 7. Lastly, he rejected the section 15 argument as the claimants failed to show that residence in a particular community or town is an \\"analogous ground\\" for discrimination.

Ornithomancy in some form has been found globally among a wide variety of pre-industrial peoples.A. Mouton, Luwian Identities (2013) p. 329-30 Mediterranean developments Prophesying by birds appeared among the Hittites in Anatolia, with texts on bird oracles written in Hittite known from the 13th or 14th century, and from whom the Greek practice may derive.A. Mouton, Luwian Identities (2013) p. 335-40 It was also familiar to the Etruscans, who may have brought it to Rome.L. Cottrell, The Penguin Book of Lost Worlds 2 (1966) p. 158 Greek evidence Ornithomancy dates back to early Greek times, appearing on Archaic vases, as well as in Hesiod and Homer:D. Ogden, A Companion to Greek Religion (2010) p. 151 one notable example from the latter occurs in the Odyssey, when an eagle appears three times, flying to the right, with a dead dove in its talons, an augury interpreted as the coming of Odysseus, and the death of his wife's suitors. Aeschylus has Prometheus claim to have introduced ornithomancy to mankind, by indicating among the birds ‚Äúthose by nature favourable, and those/Sinister‚Äù.Aeschylus, Prometheus Bound (1982) p. 35 Ornithomancy could be spontaneous, or it could be the result of a formal consultation:A. Mouton, Luwian Identities (2013) p. 336 the seer would face north, and birds on their right ‚Äî the east, the direction of sunrise ‚Äî were taken as favourable (the reverse being true of the Roman augur, who by contrast faced south).H. Nettleship ed., A Dictionary of Classical Antiquities (1891) p. 86 Although it was mainly the flights and songs of birds that were studied, any action could have been interpreted to either foretell the future or relate a message from the gods. Roman practice Omens from observation of the flight of birds were considered with the utmost seriousness by Romans. The practice of ornithomancy by priests called augurs was a branch of Roman national religion from before the founding of the city, which had its own priestly college to supervise its practice. The word \\"inauguration\\" is derived from the Latin noun inauguratio derived from the verb inaugurare which was to \\"take omens from birds in flight.\\" Since Roman augurs predominantly looked at birds for omens, they were also called auspex (\\"bird watcher\\", plural auspices), however they also interpreted thunder, lightning, the behavior of certain animals, and strange events. The phrase \\"under the auspices\\" is derived from this need for a favourable reading of the omens by the augurs. Biblical references Ornithomancy is mentioned several times in the Septuagint version of the Bible. After Joseph discovers the silver bowl he had hidden in his brothers' luggage, he declaims, \\"Why have ye stolen my silver cup? is it not this out of which my lord drinks? and he divines augury with it.\\"Gen 44:5 LXX; cf. Gen 44:15 LXX Later in the Septuagint, however, the practice is expressly forbidden.cf. Deut 18:10, Lev 19:26 LXX Cultural echoes *Lewis Namier introduced his prosopographical study of eighteenth century politics in England with a quotation from Aeschylus on ornithomancy: ‚ÄúI took pains to determine the flight of crook-taloned birds, marking which were of the right by nature, and which were of the left, and what were their ways of living, each after his kind‚Äù.L.

In a traditional open primary, voters may select one party's ballot and vote for that party's nomination. As in a closed primary, the highest voted candidate in each party then proceeds to the general election. In a nonpartisan blanket primary, all candidates appear on the same ballot and the two highest voted candidates proceed to the runoff election, regardless of party affiliation. The constitutionality of this system was affirmed by the Supreme Court of the United States in 2008,Washington State Grange v. Washington State Republican Party, 552 U.S. 442 (2008). whereas a partisan blanket primary was previously ruled to be unconstitutional in 2000.California Democratic Party v. Jones, 530 U.S. 567 (2000). The arguments for open primaries are that voters can make independent choices, building consensus that the electoral process is not splintered or undermined by the presence of multiple political parties. Voter participation The open primary could be seen as good for voter participation. First, the open primary allows nonpartisan or independent voters to participate in the nominating process.HeraldTribune.com - News - News stories about Sarasota, Manatee and Charlotte counties in Florida, from the newspapers of record. - HeraldTribune.com If these voters are allowed to help select the nominees then they may be more likely to vote in the general election, since one of the candidates could be someone the non-partisan voter voted for. Also, a moderate member of one party may agree more with a candidate for the nomination of another party. This voter will have more of an incentive to participate in the general election if there is a nominee whom he or she agrees with. The open primary could also be viewed as bad for voter participation. In Hawaii, primary voter turnout fell from 74.6% in 1978 to 42.2% in 2006 after changing to open primaries which could be the result of many things‚Äînot just the move towards the open primary system. The closed primary system had more of an incentive for people to join one of the major parties. This led to people being more involved in the voting process. With the open primary, some argue, more voters become independent and are less likely to participate in the nominating or election processes. Manipulation and dilution Opponents of the open primary believe that the open primary leaves the party nominations vulnerable to manipulation and dilution. First, one party could organize its voters to vote in the other party's primary and choose the candidate that they most agree with or that they think their party could most easily defeat. Secondly, in the open primary independent voters can vote in either party. This occurrence may dilute the vote of a particular party and lead to a nominee who does not represent the views of his or her party. There is, however, little evidence of manipulation actually occurring, but there have been occasions when independent voters have an effect on the outcome of a partisan primary. For example, in the 2008 presidential primaries in New Hampshire, Mitt Romney won among registered Republicans, but John McCain won overall.http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2008/primaries/results/epolls/index.html#NHREP Likewise, in South Carolina, Mike Huckabee won among self-identified Republicans, but John McCain won the state. Constitutional issues Opponents of the open primary argue that the open primary is unconstitutional. These opponents believe that the open primary law violates their freedom of association, because it forces them to allow outsiders to select their candidates. An opposing view is that political parties are not mentioned in the U.S. Constitution in any language, but voting rights of the individual are clearly defined. Freedom of association has been recognized by the United States Supreme Court. First, in NAACP v. Alabama, the court said that \\"It is beyond debate that freedom to engage in association for the advancement of beliefs and ideas is an inseparable aspect of the \\"liberty\\" assured by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendment, which embraces freedom of speech.\\"NAACP v. Alabama, http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi- bin/getcase.pl?navby=volpage&court;=us&vol;=357&page;=460#460 In other words, the freedom of association is part of the freedom of speech. The freedom of speech, which is found in the First Amendment to the United States Constitution, is applied to the states through the fourteenth amendment. In Gitlow v. New York, Justice Sanford states that \\"[f]or present purposes we may and do assume that freedom of speech and of the press-which are protected by the First Amendment from abridgment by Congress-are among the fundamental personal rights and 'liberties' protected by the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment from impairment by the States.\\"Gitlow v. New York, http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/cgi-bin/getcase.pl?court=us&vol;=268&invol;=652 This constitutionality raises a problem. The most popular alternative to the open primary is the closed primary. However, a mandatory closed primary can also be unconstitutional. In Tashjian v. Republican Party of Connecticut, the United States Supreme Court determined that Connecticut's closed primary law was unconstitutional. The Connecticut closed primary law \\"[required] voters in any political party primary to be registered members of that party\\".Tashjian v. Republican Party of Connecticut December 10, 1986. 479 U.S. 208. The Republican Party of Connecticut, however, wanted to allow independents to vote in the Republican primary if they so chose. The problem with this closed primary law was that it prevented the Republican Party from allowing independent \\"registered voters not affiliated with any party to vote in Republican primaries for federal and statewide offices\\". Since the Republican Party of Connecticut was not able to choose who it wanted to vote in the primary, the United States Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, stated that the closed primary law in Connecticut \\"impermissibly burdens the right of the Party and its members protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments\\". On October 1, 2007, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit ruled that the Virginia mandatory open primary statute was unconstitutional as applied to the Republicans because it imposed a burden on their freedom to associate under the First Amendment, although it did not explicitly rule on the question of whether an open primary law was in general unconstitutional as a burden on association.Miller v. Brown California and primary election alternatives A \\"modified closed primary\\" was in effect in California from 2001 to 2011. Each political party could decide whether or not they wish to allow unaffiliated voters to vote in their party's primary. This appeared to avoid the constitutional concerns of both the open and the closed primary. In the 2004 and 2006 primary elections, the Republican, Democratic, and American Independent parties all opted to allow unaffiliated voters to request their party's ballot. However, since the 2008 presidential primary election, only the Democratic and American Independent parties have taken this option, while the Republican party has not.California Secretary of State, In 2011, the state adopted a \\"modified open primary\\". Individual citizens may vote for any candidate, and the top two candidates regardless of party will advance to the general election. The Presidential election is exempt from this voting method as it is a contest for delegates rather than a direct election for an office. A potential side effect of the open primary is that parties that run more candidates may find themselves at a disadvantage, since their partisan supporters' votes will be split more ways in the primary and thus those candidates may have a harder time reaching the top-two ranking when competing with parties that run fewer candidates.

In California, under Proposition 14, a measure that easily passed, traditional party primaries were replaced in 2011 with wide-open elections. Proposition 14, known as the open primary measure, gave every voter the same ballot in primary elections for most state and federal races, except the presidential contest. Most primaries in New York are closed, but state law contains a provision allowing parties to use a different method if they want. Currently, only the Independence Party chooses to allow unaffiliated voters to participate.

Origins  This dummy company was set up in May 1933, just after appointment of Hjalmar Schacht as Reichsbank President in March 1933, as a front for purchases from four German armament manufacturers, Krupp, Siemens, Gutehoffnungsh√ºtte, and Rheinmetall. The four were persuaded to put up the initial share capital of 250,000 Reichsmarks. The German government was not openly involved in any way; on paper, MEFO was entirely a private company, in reality, the company had two directors, one appointed by the Reich Ministry of Defence and the other by the Reichsbank. The four companies pooled together over 1 billion Reichsmark (equivalent to billion euros) where the National Socialist government agreed to repay the money with five-year promissory notes known as Mefo bills.Martin Kitchen, A History of Modern Germany 1800‚Äì2000, Maden, MA, Blackwell Publishing, 2006, p. 284 Soon afterwards, the Nazis discounted these notes (known in German as Mefo- Wechsel), basically turning them into a type of currency. Between 1934 and 1938, Mefo bills worth a total of 12 billion Reichsmark were issued to pay for rearmament. To put that into context, Germany's national debt in 1932, the year before Hitler took power, was only 10 billion Reichsmark. By 1938 the official admitted national debt was 19 billion Reichsmark -- but the Reichsmark 12 billion in Mefo bills has to be added on top of that. In other words, Hitler and the German Minister of Economics, Hjalmar Schacht, tripled Germany's national debt in just six years, but more than half of the increase was off the books. When the MEFO notes fell due in 1938, the government discovered a serious cash shortage. To resolve the problem, the Nazi regime employed ‚Äúhighly dubious methods‚Äù where ‚Äúbanks were forced to buy government bonds to be used to repay these bills, and the government took money from savings accounts and insurance companies. This made the ordinary German citizen the financier of the German rearmament.‚ÄùMartin Kitchen, A History of Modern Germany 1800‚Äì2000, Maden, MA, Blackwell Publishing, 2006, p. 284 Eventually, the government had to resort to the printing press to help mitigate the cash shortage. It was one of the key components of Germany's rearmament program and was invented by Hjalmar Schacht, who then was head of the Ministry of Economics, and Plenipotentiary for the War Economy. After assuming power in 1933, the National Socialists realized that rearming Germany would require funds that were not likely to be generated from taxes or public loans. In addition, the need to keep the rearmament effort secret led to the creation of this dummy company.  Transactions  The transactions that led to the re-armament financing were conducted as follows * Armaments manufacturers were contracted to produce arms * Mefo bills of exchange were drawn by these contractors as payment for their invoice from the German Reich, and accepted by MEFO Company * The bills of exchange were received by all German banks for possible re-discounting with the Reichsbank. * The bills of exchange were guaranteed by the German Reich for five years after issue. This system continued to be used until April 1938, when almost 12 billion Reichsmark (equivalent to billion euros) of such bills were outstanding. At that time the first of these bills, which were guaranteed for five years, would come due in 1939 when the holders would likely present them to the Reichsbank for payment. This method of financing enabled the Nazi government to obtain large loans from the Reichsbank which was prohibited under then existing statutes. Direct lending to the Government by the Reichsbank had been limited by statute to 100 million Reichsmark. The large nature of these outstandings led eventually to a bureaucratic confrontation between the Reichsbank and the Finance Ministry in 1939, leading to the resignation of Hjalmar Schacht, the author of the whole strategy on 20 January 1939.

Located on Schumann Street (Schumannstra√üe), the Deutsches Theater consists of two adjoining stages that share a common, classical facade. The main stage was built in 1850, originally for operettas. Adolf L'Arronge founded the Deutsches Theater in 1883 with the ambition of providing Berliners with a high-quality ensemble-based repertory company on the model of the German court theater, the Meiningen Ensemble, which had been developed by Georg II, Duke of Saxe- Meiningen and his colleagues to become \\"the most widely admired and imitated company in Europe\\", thanks to its historically accurate sets and costumes, vividly-realized crowd scenes, and meticulous directorial control.Banham (1998a) and (1998b). Otto Brahm, the leading exponent of theatrical Naturalism in Germany, took over the direction of the theater in 1894, and applied that approach to a combination of classical productions and stagings of the work of the new realistic playwrights.Banham (1998a). One of Brahm's ensemble, the legendary theater director Max Reinhardt, took over the directorship in 1904.

In general, these deelgemeenten are not a level of administration. Only in the municipality of Antwerp are they the lowest level of administration and are called districts. The term deelgemeente is used in Dutch to refer to such a subdivision of a municipality anywhere in Belgium, municipalities having been merged throughout the country in the 1970s. Deelgemeenten usually were independent municipalities before the fusions in the 1970s. In English and French there is no directly equivalent term, and deelgemeente is not normally used when talking about former municipalities in Wallonia or the Brussels Capital Region. In French, the term ancienne commune (former/old municipality) or section de commune (section of municipality) is generally used. However, when otherwise necessary, the term is usually pronounced in French variably as . Netherlands In the Netherlands, deelgemeenten were administrative divisions that could be instituted by any municipality.Gemeentewet, art. 87 The city of Amsterdam was the first to do this. In the early 1980s, the municipality was divided into fifteen deelgemeenten. This amount was decreased to eight in 2010. Seven of these were officially called stadsdeel. Rotterdam followed in the 1990s and was divided into fourteen deelgemeenten. Deelgemeenten Deelgemeenten had their own mayor, the deelgemeentevoorzitter, their own aldermen, deelgemeentewethouders, and their own elected assembly, the deelgemeenteraad. Deelgemeenten were abolished in March 2014, after the 2014 municipal elections. Since 2014, districts of Amsterdam have a bestuurscommissie (literally \\"governance commission\\"), and the deelgemeenten of Rotterdam are now called gebieden (literally \\"areas\\").

The company name Viralg, also works as an abbreviation for virtual algorithm. In 2007 Viralg offered some of their intellectual property for sale on eBay.  Legal Inspection  The police were asked to investigate Viralg, since Finnish law prohibits interfering with telecommunications. http://www.voima.fi/content/view/full/1421 The police, however, declined, stating that there was no cause to suspect a crime. In a complaint to the Finnish parliamentary ombudsman the ombudsman concluded that the police officer in charge of the investigation did not, by his own admission, have relevant technical expertise, and that a proper inquiry would have been more appropriate. However, the ombudsman also stated that the decision was a proper judgement call by the police. http://mjr.iki.fi/texts/  References External links *Viralg official homepage *Slyck.com article on the case *Article on Viralg winning the Venture Cup Category:File sharing Category:Software companies of Finland ","title":"Viralg"},{"id":"4165805","text":"Fatman the Human Flying Saucer is a fictional character, a comic book superhero created by artist C. C. Beck and writer Otto Binder in the 1960s. Beck and Binder created Fatman long after Beck's popular creation Captain Marvel was canceled partly due to a copyright infringement suit with DC Comics. Overview Fatman's costume was green and yellow with a yellow flying saucer emblem on the chest. Fatman was fat and could change into a human flying saucer. His comic ran for only three issues and was published by Lightning Comics, an almost equally short lived company. Fatman comics were produced in small numbers and are considered valuable because of Beck's artwork and their rarity. Van Crawford became Fatman after coming to the aid of an alien flying saucer. The saucer itself turned out to be a shapeshifting alien, which rewarded Crawford by giving him a chocolate drink with the ability to transform him into a human flying saucer. Being a wealthy man, like many superheroes of the era, Crawford decided to use this newfound power to become a superhero. He teamed up with a teenage sidekick, Tin Man, who could turn into a robot.
