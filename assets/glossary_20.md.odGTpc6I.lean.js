Pronax; Tripp, s.v. Pronax; Parada, s.v. Pronax; Smith, s.v. Pronax; Apollodorus, 1.9.13. According to some accounts, he died before the war of the Seven against Thebes, and the Nemean Games were instituted in his honor.Bravo III, p. 117; Hard, p. 333; Smith, s.v. Pronax; Grimal, s.v. Pronax; Aelian, Historical Miscellany, 4.5. Lycurgus Pronax's son was perhaps the same Lycurgus that was said to have been raised from the dead by Asclepius.Hard, pp. 150-1; Apollodorus, 3.10.3, with Frazer's note 12. His son was also possibly the same as the Nemean Lycurgus who was the father of Opheltes. Although the mythographer Apollodorus distinguishes these two, saying that the Lycurgus, who was the father of Opheltes, was the son of Pheres,Apollodorus, 1.9.13 (Lycurgus son of Pronax), 1.9.14 (Lycurgus son of Pheres, father of Opheltes). there is some evidence to suggest that, in some accounts, these two Lycurgoi were in fact the same. The geographer Pausanias reports seeing an image of Pronax's son Lycurgus on the Amyclae throne of Apollo.Gantz, p. 511; Pausanias, 3.18.12. According to Pausanias, Adrastus and Tydeus, two of the Seven against Thebes, are shown stopping a fight between Lycurgus and Amphiaraus, another of the Seven. If this image depicted an event during the Seven's stop at Nemea, then this would presumably mean that, in some version of the story, Pronax's son was the father of Opheltes.Gantz, pp. 511-512, who however concludes that it is \\"more likely\\" that the scene depicted on the throne is an event from the Seven's departure from Argos; Grimal, s.vv. Lycurgus 3, Pronax; Parada, s.vv. Lycurgus 3, Lycurgus 4 (treating the two as distinct). Amphithea According to Athenaeus, the extravident clothing worn by those who came to court Pronax's daughter Amphithea, was mentioned by the 5th-century Greek tragedian Agathon.Athenaeus, The Learned Banqueters 12.528d [= Agathon TrGF 39 F 3], with Olsen's note 93. Pronax gave his daughter, Amphithea in marriage to his brother Adrastus, who was the king of Argos and leader of the Seven against Thebes. She and Adrastus had three daughters, Argia, Deipyle, and Aegialia, and two sons, Aegialeus and Cyanippus.Apollodorus, 1.9.13. NotesReferences * Aelian, Historical Miscellany, translated by Nigel G.

After being introduced to Japanese through codebreaking during the Second World War, Hawkes studied Chinese and Japanese at Oxford University between 1945 and 1947 before studying at Peking University from 1948 to 1951. He then returned to Oxford, where he completed his D.Phil. and later became Shaw Professor of Chinese. In 1971, Hawkes resigned his position to focus entirely on his translation of the famous Chinese novel The Story of the Stone (also known as Dream of the Red Chamber), which was published in three volumes between 1973 and 1980. He retired in 1984 to rural Wales before returning to Oxford in his final years. Hawkes was known for his translations that preserved the \\"realism and poetry\\" of the original Chinese, and was the foremost non-Chinese Redology expert. Life and career=Early life David Hawkes was born on 6 July 1923 in London, England, and grew up in East London. He entered Oxford University in 1942 as a student in Christ Church, where he studied the Latin and Greek Classics. After his first year, during the height of the Second World War, Hawkes was recruited to study Japanese in London. His talent for East Asian languages was soon recognized by his military superiors, and he was made an instructor to the Japanese codebreakers. After the war's end in 1945, Hawkes returned to Oxford, where he transferred from Classics into the newly established Honours School of Chinese, whose only teacher was the former missionary E. R. Hughes (1883-1956). Hawkes studied at Oxford until 1947, when he decided to move to China to continue his studies at Peking University. Hawkes was so determined that he booked passage on a ship to Hong Kong without having received notice of his acceptance. The Chinese scholar Hu Shih, who then served as university president, was notorious for ignoring correspondence, and Hawkes' plans were saved only when the British poet William Empson, who was the only foreigner at the university, noticed Hawkes' letters and arranged for him to be accepted as a graduate student. The university was located in downtown Beijing (later moved to Haidian District on the former site of Yenching University), and Hawkes lived in a rented room in a medieval hutong lane dwelling. He took courses in Chinese literature from noted scholars such as Luo Changpei and Yu Pingbo. Hawkes and his Chinese classmates were present in Tiananmen Square on 1 October 1949 to hear Mao Zedong announce the founding of the People's Republic of China following the Communist Party of China's defeat of Chiang Kai-shek and the Nationalist Party (Kuomintang) in the Chinese Civil War. Marriage and career In 1950, Hawkes was joined in Beijing by his fianc√©e, Jean, and the two were married in April 1950 after a long negotiation with the local police station. Within several months Hawkes' wife became pregnant and China entered the Korean War, and the couple was strongly advised to leave China. They departed China in 1951 and returned to Oxford, where Hawkes continued his graduate study in Chinese under the American sinologist Homer H. Dubs, Oxford's new chair of Chinese. He received a D.Phil. in 1955 with a dissertation entitled \\"The Problem of Date and Authorship of Ch'u Tz'u\\", a study of the 3rd century BC anthology Verses of Chu (Chu ci Ê•öËæ≠). Hawkes' work attracted the attention of the prominent translator Arthur Waley, whom Hawkes came to consider his mentor. Hawkes succeeded Dubs as Oxford's chair of Chinese in 1959, and much of his tenure focused on altering the Chinese curriculum to include modern Chinese literature, which it had not previously covered. By the end of the 1950s, the curriculum covered not only the Chinese Classics, but also the premodern Four Great Novels and the short stories of Lu Xun. Hawkes' lectures were noted as being \\"scholarly but entertaining\\" to the point of being suggestive of his \\"early love of the theatre\\". In the 1960s, Hawkes became increasingly interested in Cao Xueqin's 18th-century epic novel Dream of the Red Chamber (Á¥ÖÊ®ìÂ§¢), and in 1970 he was approached by Penguin Books to do a non-scholarly translation for publication in the Penguin Classics series. Translating all 120 chapters of Dream of Red Mansions proved a huge task, and in 1971 Hawkes shocked much of the Sinological world by resigning the chair of Chinese to focus exclusively on his translation. He obtained a Research Fellowship at All Souls College in 1973, which provided him with financial support during his translation work, which took nearly 10 years. He translated the first 80 chapters of the novel, which were published in three volumes (1973, 1977, 1980) under the novel's original title Story of the Stone (Shitou ji ). The remaining 40 chapters, which appeared after Cao's death and whose authenticity has long been debated, were later translated by Hawkes' son-in-law, the British sinologist John Minford. Retirement Hawkes formally retired from Chinese scholarship in 1984 and relocated with his wife to Wales, donating his 4,500-volume Chinese book collection to the National Library of Wales. He and his wife cultivated a large garden and raised goats, while Hawkes focused his personal studies on the history of religion and learning the Welsh language. His only subsequent Chinese publication was a small translation of a Yuan dynasty drama entitled Liu Yi and the Dragon Princess, published in 2003. Hawkes was a severe critic of organized religion in his later life, and in 2004 edited a series of his essays into a small volume entitled Letters from a Godless Grandfather, which was published privately in Hong Kong. He was a vocal critic of Israel's treatment of Palestinians and of British and American military involvement in the Middle East, and participated in several protest marches.

Section 1(2) provided that for the purposes of giving effect to Article 17 of the Treaty: * the British Government could by Orders in Council transfer powers to the Provisional Government of Southern Ireland; * the Parliament of Southern Ireland would be dissolved within four months from the passing of the Act; and * elections would be held for \\"the House of the Parliament\\" to which the Provisional Government would be responsible. The Act did not give a name to that Parliament but said that in matters within the jurisdiction of the Provisional Government (i.e. only certain matters concerning Southern Ireland), it would have power to make laws in like manner as the Parliament of the Irish Free State when constituted. Sections 11 and 12 provided for the right of Northern Ireland to opt out of the new dominion and remain within the United Kingdom. Effect and repeal Notably, the Act (under Section 1(5) of the Act) was stated explicitly not to be the Act of Parliament for the ratification of the Anglo-Irish Treaty.\\"(5) This Act shall not be deemed to be the Act of Parliament for the ratification of the said Articles of Agreement as from the passing whereof the month mentioned in Article 11 of the said Articles is to run\\" That function was to fall to the Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922. Instead, the Act was primarily intended to provide interim provisional arrangements necessary before the establishment of the Irish Free State, which under the Treaty had to be established on or before 6 December 1922. By Order in Council under the Act, the British Government formally transferred powers to the existing Provisional Government on 1 April 1922.

The homestead, rising above Duck Creek, is a memorial to settler Watters Smith, who was born in Trenton, New Jersey, in 1767, and moved to Harrison County in what was then Virginia, in 1796, with his wife Elizabeth Davisson Smith. A log cabin similar to the original was moved and reconstructed on the park, together with farm buildings typical of early 19th century settlement. The more modern Smith family home (c. 1876) has been restored as a museum, and an additional museum houses many local farm artifacts from earlier eras. Guided tours are offered from Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day. In addition, the park features swimming, picnicking, hiking trails, and horseback riding. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974 as the Watters Smith Farm on Duck Creek. Mountain biking Watters Smith Park has become a local hot spot for mountain biking.

Provisions As originally enacted, the Irish Free State Constitution Act 1922 consisted of a preamble, five sections (three of which were very brief), and a schedule. The schedule was the text of the Constitution of the Irish Free State (Saorst√°t √âireann) Act 1922, which had been passed in Ireland by the Third D√°il sitting as a constituent assembly and provisional parliament for the nascent Free State. This Irish Act itself had two schedules, the first being the actual text of the Constitution, and the second the text of the 1921 Treaty (formally, the Articles of Agreement for a treaty between Great Britain and Ireland). The UK Act's preamble quotes section 2 of the Irish Act: ;Section 1: declared the scheduled Constitution would come into effect upon a Royal Proclamation no later than 6 December 1922. ;Section 2: made transitory provisions regarding taxation liabilities ;Section 3: empowered the Free State parliament to adopt legislation applied to other dominions ;Section 4: was a saver empowering the UK parliament to pass laws for the Free State on the same basis as for other dominions ;Section 5: assigned the short title and specified that the Treaty to have been ratified. Article 12 of the Treaty accorded to Northern Ireland the right to secede from the new Free State and rejoin the United Kingdom, giving its parliament a month in which to decide: the so-called Ulster Month. The Treaty had been implicitly accepted by the UK parliament in votes on the King's Speech in December 1921, and most of its provisions had been effected in March 1922 by the Irish Free State (Agreement) Act 1922. However, neither of these events was held to have formally ratified the treaty. This was because the Ulster Month would begin as soon as the treaty had been ratified, and it was felt that the opt-out should not be exercised until after the Free State had come into being. Section 5 of the Irish Free State Constitution Act therefore declared the Act to be the ratification of the treaty for the purposes of the Ulster Month. Enactment The Irish Act had been approved by the Irish constituent assembly on 25 October 1922. The bill for the UK Act was introduced by the Prime Minister Bonar Law into the Parliament of the United Kingdom in November 1922. The bill's third reading in the House of Commons was on 30 November.Hansard; third reading debate The New York Times reported on the passing of the Act on 5 December 1922 as follows: The New York Times also reported that in Parliament a group of Communists singing \\"The Red Flag\\" caused a minor disturbance as the formalities relating to the Act's passage were underway. Northern Ireland secedes from the Irish Free State On 7 December 1922, the day after the establishment of the Irish Free State, the Parliament of Northern Ireland addressed the King requesting its secession from Irish Free State. The address was unanimous, with the abstentionist Nationalist and Sinn F√©in members absent. The King replied shortly thereafter to say that he had caused his Ministers and the Government of the Irish Free State to be informed that Northern Ireland was to do so. Position in Irish law After the Statute of Westminster 1931, the UK government recognised the right of the Irish government to amend or repeal the UK act, but in fact the Irish government did not do so until it was formally repealed as spent by the Statute Law Revision Act 2007. The Irish government amended the Irish act in 1933, and the 1937 constitution repealed the entire Free State constitution. The UK Judicial Committee of the Privy Council ruled in 1935 that the 1933 Act had implicitly amended the UK Act with respect to the jurisdiction of the Free State. The Irish Supreme Court has taken the view that the Free State constitution was enacted by the Irish Act, not by the subsequent UK Act. This reflects the view of popular sovereignty rather than parliamentary sovereignty, with the constitution's legitimacy ultimately springing from the 1922 Irish election.

The Act dealt with a number of matters concerning the Irish Free State, which was established on the day after the Act became law; it also modified the Government of Ireland Act 1920 in relation to Northern Ireland. Purpose Prime Minister Bonar Law first introduced the legislation as a Bill in November 1922. The Act's purpose was to deal with a range of consequences arising from the impending creation of the Irish Free State. The Act also had to make provisions for Northern Ireland which would be appropriate depending on whether (i) Northern Ireland decided to remain part of the new Free State after its establishment or (ii) chose to opt back into the United Kingdom (as was widely anticipated). In regard to Northern Ireland, The Times recalled that there was \\"no doubt\\" that Northern Ireland would opt to rejoin the United Kingdom.The Times, 27 November 1922 The Act amended the Government of Ireland Act 1920 in certain respects. Changes The Act's provisions provided that if Northern Ireland opted out of the Free State: *a Boundary Commission would be established to determine the land frontier between the Free State and the North; *there shall be a Governor of Northern Ireland, with a salary of ¬£8,000; *a Privy Council of Northern Ireland would be established, and there would also be a separate Great Seal; *if there is to be a Council of Ireland (as contemplated in the Government of Ireland Act 1920) \\"to bring about harmonious action\\" between the Parliaments and Governments of the South and North and to provide \\"for the administration of services which the two Parliaments mutually agree should be administered uniformly throughout the whole of Ireland,\\" it will be necessary for identical Acts to be passed; *that the contribution from Northern Ireland towards Imperial liabilities and expenditure is to remain at ¬£7,920,000, subject to periodical adjustment by a Joint Exchequer Board; *the High Court of Appeal for Ireland will cease to exist; and *that Cases which would have been reserved for the High Court of Appeal for Ireland will, in the North, be heard by the Court of Appeal for Northern Ireland. The Act also: *abolished the office of the Lord Lieutenant of Ireland which had been an all-Ireland office under the Act of 1920 as with the establishment of the Free State, the representative of the King in the Free State was to be styled the Governor- General of the Irish Free State; *abolished the office of Lord Chancellor of Ireland; *abolished the Irish Land Commissioners (the Commission was revived by the Irish Free State the following year); *provided for the establishment of a trust, called the Irish Sailors and Soldiers Land Trust, for 'the purpose of providing in Ireland cottages, with or without plots or-gardens, for the accommodation of men who served in the naval, military, or air forces during the war. The trust will have five members, of whom three will be appointed by a Secretary of State, one by the President of the Free State, and one by the Prime Minister of Northern Ireland. However, before these provisions could take effect the two Irish Parliaments had to pass legislation to enable the Trust to acquire and hold land; *gave the Commissioners of Customs and Excise powers, if necessary, to make regulations with reference to the importation and exportation of goods into and from Northern Ireland across the land frontier; *made provision as to relief from double income-tax; *made provision for the severance of matters such as the system of national health insurance in Great Britain from that in the Irish Free State would, for example, be made by Order in Council; and *made provision for the pensions of judges. Great Seal of Northern Ireland As noted above, the Act was also the instrument that created the Great Seal of Northern Ireland: There shall be a Great Seal of Northern Ireland which shall be kept by the Governor of Northern Ireland and shall, after the first appointment of such Governor, be used for all matters in Northern Ireland for which the Great Seal of Ireland was theretofore used. Until a Great Seal of Northern Ireland is provided the private seal of the Governor of Northern Ireland may be used as that Great Seal.

The term harkens back to the U.S. containment policy against communist countries during the Cold War. The theory asserts that the United States needs a weak, divided China to continue its hegemony in Asia. This multifaceted strategy is accomplished by the United States establishing military, economic, and diplomatic ties with countries adjacent to China's borders, frustrating China's own attempts at alliance-building and economic partnership, and the utilization of tariffs, sanctions and lawfare. The presence of American military in Afghanistan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan and the Philippines; recently strengthened ties with South Korea and Japan; efforts to improve relations with India and Vietnam; and the Obama administration's 2012 \\"Pivot to Asia Strategy\\" for increased American involvement in the Western Pacific have been pointed to as evidence of a current containment policy. The United States had formerly claimed it had no containment policy against China and that they \\"want China to succeed and prosper\\". The US has made efforts to contain China in the past however through military actions undertaken in the Vietnam War as evidenced in the leaked Pentagon Papers. President Richard Nixon‚Äôs China rapprochement signaled a temporary shift in focus to gain leverage in containing the Soviet Union. That position changed in 2019 when the US State Department Director of Policy Planning, Kiron Skinner, revealed details of a study detailing a containment strategy for China that is said to be influenced by Samuel P. Huntington's book Clash of Civilizations. Justifications=Cold War era Map depicting McNamara‚Äôs vision to encircle China with the USSR, Japan and Korea, India and Pakistan, and Southeast Asia A-6A Intruder all-weather bombers over Vietnam in 1968 During the Cold War the United States tried to prevent the domino theory spreading of communism and thwart communist countries including that of the People's Republic of China. Revelations about the overt and ulterior motives behind the US intervention in Vietnam and the covert widening of combat operations to nearby Cambodia and Laos was leaked in the Pentagon Papers by Daniel Ellsberg in 1971. Although President Lyndon B. Johnson stated that the aim of the Vietnam War was to secure an \\"independent, non-Communist South Vietnam\\", a January 1965 memorandum by Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara stated that an underlying justification was \\"not to help a friend, but to contain China\\". McNamara accused China of harboring imperialist aspirations like those of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. According to McNamara, the Chinese were conspiring to \\"organize all of Asia\\" against the United States. As laid out by McNamara, the Chinese containment policy of the United States was a long-run strategic effort to surround Beijing with the USSR, its satellite states, as well as: a) The Japan‚ÄìKorea front, b) The India‚ÄìPakistan front, and c) The Southeast Asia front Post-Cold War In more contemporary times after the Nixon rapprochement and collapse of the USSR, the US and China enjoyed a period of closer economic ties and outwardly warmer relations. United States' 2006 Quadrennial Defense Review stated that China has \\"the greatest potential of any nation to militarily compete with the US and field disruptive military technologies that over time offset traditional US advantages\\".Hawkins, William R (June 2, 2007). The dangers in talking to China . Asia Times Online. The document continues by stating that China must be more open in reporting its military expenditures and refrain from \\"locking up\\" energy supplies by continuing to obtain energy contracts with disreputable regimes in Africa and Central Asia.Bush, George (March 2006). The National Security Strategy of the United States of America . The White House. The policy assumes that measures should be taken against China to prevent it from seeking hegemony in the Asia-Pacific region and/or worldwide.Feng, Huiyun (2007). Chinese strategic culture and foreign policy decision-making: Confucianism, leadership and war. Routledge. p.81. . The United States‚Äô political leadership began to openly embrace containment policies in 2011, starting with President Barack Obama‚Äôs ‚Äúpivot‚Äù toward Asia, which was supposed to involve a winding down of the War in Iraq and withdrawal of troops and military assets in the Middle East and Persian Gulf region and redeploying them in the Asia-Pacific; the Chinese leadership were keen to this ‚Äúpivot‚Äù as a renewed Cold War-era containment strategy and attempted to open a dialogue regarding the US concerns about the South China Sea, but they were rebuffed. Supporters of Chinese containment or increased American involvement in East Asia have cited the United States as a counterbalance to the excesses of Chinese expansion. Countries in territorial disputes with China, such as in the South China Sea and the Senkaku Islands, have complained about harassment in the disputed areas. Some experts have suggested that China may leverage their economic strength in such disputes, one example being the sudden restriction on Chinese imports of Filipino bananas during tensions over the Scarborough Shoal. Formalization and implementation United States Information Service poster distributed in Asia depicting Juan dela Cruz ready to defend the Philippines under the threat of communism, 1951. President Donald Trump and his administration have revealed details about a long-term strategy in dealing with the rise of China. A study on China produced by a small working group within the US State Department led by the Director of Policy Planning Kiron Skinner reportedly envisions a world of unavoidable and aggressive great power competition and a ‚Äúclash of civilizations‚Äù. The study was informally called ‚ÄúLetter X‚Äù in reference to the X Article that advocated for a containment strategy for the Soviet Union. In a speech at the Future Security Forum on April 29, 2019, Skinner characterized the Cold War as ‚Äúa huge fight within the Western family‚Äù and due to that shared heritage and value-system, breakthroughs could be made; on China however, she argued there can be no accommodation or cooperation because it is ‚Äú... a fight with a really different civilization and a different ideology‚Äù and ‚Äúit‚Äôs the first time that we will have a great-power competitor that is not Caucasian‚Äù. To what extent this controversial and much criticized viewing of foreign policy in a racialized lens will be carried out in practice as official policy within the US State Department is yet to be seen. Trump has repeatedly spoken publicly about thawing relations with Russia and has reportedly made overtures with Russian officials in an attempt to recruit Russia as a strategic foil to help contain China. An open letter was released by China-focused scholars, foreign policy experts and business leaders that decried the new adversarial approach as counterproductive and urged the administration to continue the more cooperative approach. The new policy has been buttressed to some extent by US-led multinational organizations, NGOs and think tanks. In April 2019, the fourth iteration of the influential neoconservative think tank, the Committee on the Present Danger, was unveiled, calling itself the ‚ÄúCommittee on the Present Danger: China (CPDC)‚Äù in a press conference in Washington DC. The organization was reformed by former Trump administration White House Chief Strategist Steve Bannon and former Reagan administration official Frank Gaffney to ‚Äúeducate and inform American citizens and policymakers about the existential threats presented from the Peoples Republic of China under the misrule of the Chinese Communist Party‚Äù. The CPDC takes the view that there is ‚Äúno hope of coexistence with China as long as the Communist Party governs the country‚Äù. This \\"good vs. evil\\" false dilemma ideological framing of future US- China relations begets some criticism in the foreign relations community as overly hawkish, arguing it similar to the fear-mongering that led to the Red Scare under Senator Joseph McCarthy and hysteria that led to disastrous wars in Vietnam and Iraq. Charles W. Freeman Jr. at the Watson Institute called the CPDC ‚Äúa Who‚Äôs Who of contemporary wing-nuts, very few of whom have any expertise at all about China and most of whom represent ideological causes only peripherally connected to it.\\" With questions about the continued purpose of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in a post-Cold War world, NATO countries have refrained from re-orienting toward and labeling the PRC an outright ‚Äúenemy‚Äù, but NATO chief Jens Stoltenberg said the organization needs to recognize the ‚Äúchallenges‚Äù posed by China at a NATO event in 2019, saying \\"China will soon have the world's biggest economy. And it already has the second largest defense budget, investing heavily in new capabilities‚Äù and also said that NATO did not want to ‚Äúcreate new adversaries‚Äù; this contrasted with the United States‚Äô NATO representative at the event, who referred to China as a ‚Äúcompetitor‚Äù. Military strategy United States test firing a conventionally configured ground-launched medium-range cruise missile on 18 August 2019 The United States‚Äô Indo-Pacific strategy has broadly been to use the surrounding countries around China to blunt its influence. This includes strengthening the bonds between South Korea and Japan as well as trying to get India, another large developing country to help with their efforts. Additionally, with the US withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia (in part because China wasn't a party to it), the US has reportedly wanted to find a host in the Asia-Pacific region to point the previously banned weapons at China. In addition to soft power diplomacy within the region, the US is physically surrounding China with military bases in the event of any conflict. The United States has developed many military bases in the Asia Pacific equipped with warships, nuclear missiles and nuclear-capable strategic bombers as a deterrent and to achieve full spectrum dominance in a strategy similar to that of the Cold War. Lawfare and sanctions The use of economic sanctions has always been a tool of American foreign policy and has become used more frequently in the 21st century, from targeting individuals and sometimes whole countries by using the centrality of the US financial system and the position of the US dollar as the world's reserve currency to limit trade and cashflow. =Xinjiang= In the human rights arena, the United States and the Trump administration has worked to isolate China internationally by drawing attention to its human rights record. In particular, US policymakers have focused on the status of China‚Äôs ‚Äúre- education camps‚Äù for those accused of religious extremism in China‚Äôs Xinjiang Autonomous Region, the region inhabited by the Muslim Uyghur minority as well as the protests in Hong Kong. These camps, which some NGOs such as the Washington-based Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation and East Turkistan National Awakening Movement estimated to have a population of over one million people, have been described as ‚Äúindoctrination camps‚Äù that are reportedly run like prisons to eradicate Uyghur culture and religion in an attempt at Sinicization as well as likened to concentration camps in the early days of Nazi Germany. The United States Congress has responded to these reports with calls for the imposition of sanctions under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act; in December 2019, the House of Representatives and Senate passed the Uighur Human Rights Policy Act. Chinese officials have responded to the criticism and scrutiny by rejecting the ‚Äúmore than one million‚Äù camp population estimate by foreign experts and say the ‚Äúvocational education centers‚Äù in Xinjiang are for preventing religious extremism by teaching Mandarin and job skills and cast doubt on the reports as ‚Äúmaliciously distorting and slandering‚Äù China‚Äôs counter-terrorism and de-radicalization efforts. At an event at the U.N. Human Rights Council session in Geneva, a spokesperson at China‚Äôs Bureau of Human Rights Affairs of the State Council Information Office told reporters that ‚Äúif you do not say it‚Äôs the best way, maybe it‚Äôs the necessary way to deal with Islamic or religious extremism, because the West has failed in doing so, in dealing with religious Islamic extremism‚Äù, and dismissed the view that Xinjiang‚Äôs surveillance create a martial law environment, saying ‚Äúas to surveillance, China is learning from the UK... your per capita CCTV is much higher than that for China‚Äôs Xinjiang Autonomous Region.‚Äù =Hong Kong= As has been the case in the past with other adversarial countries, some pro-Chinese commentators argue that the US has allegedly taken advantage of cleavages and regionalism within the PRC and the One Country Two Systems framework to divide and conquer, particularly in Xinjiang, Tibet and Hong Kong, through the promotion of western democratic institutions. They criticized \\"US meddling in domestic affairs\\" when a controversial extradition bill was introduced in the Hong Kong SAR, sparking the 2019‚Äì20 Hong Kong protests. Beijing accused the US of domestic interference by allegedly backing a particularly violent contingent of protesters wearing black masks through the US government-funded National Endowment for Democracy. Although the US denies the allegations of interference, pro-Chinese elements nevertheless maintained such view, stating that US diplomats have been photographed meeting with the protesters and lawmakers have hosted multiple protest leaders in Washington and voiced public support for the protesters' demands, and saying that the \\"One-Country, Two- Systems\\" arrangement should be honored. Economic strategy With China entering the World Trade Organization in 2001 with approval from the US, China and the world economy benefited from globalization and the access to new markets and the increased trade that resulted. Despite this, some in the United States lament letting China in the WTO because part of the motivation to do so, the political liberalization of the PRC‚Äôs government along the lines of the Washington Consensus never materialized. The US hoped economic liberalization would eventually lead to political liberalization to a government more akin to the then recently repatriated Hong Kong Special Administrative Region under One country, two systems. =Trans-Pacific Partnership= In part, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), geopolitically was thought by some to likely bring China's neighbours closer to the United States and reduce its economic leverage and dependence on Chinese trade. If ratified, the TPP would have strengthened American influence on future rules for the global economy. US Secretary of Defense Ash Carter claimed the passage of the TPP to be as valuable to the United States as the creation of another aircraft carrier. President Barack Obama has argued \\"if we don't pass this agreement ‚Äî if America doesn't write those rules‚Äîthen countries like China will\\". On January 23, 2017, the newly elected President Donald Trump formally withdrew the United States from the Trans-Pacific Partnership. =Trade War= Donald Trump and Xi Jinping at the 2019 G20 Osaka summit In what would become the China‚ÄìUnited States trade war, President Donald Trump began setting tariffs and other trade barriers on China in 2018 with the goal of forcing it to make changes to what the U.S. says are \\"unfair trade practices\\". The US says those trade practices and their effects are the growing trade deficit, the theft of intellectual property and the forced transfer of American technology to China. Some see hypocrisy in this characterization and instead posit that the allegations are exaggerated and China is pursuing economic development much in the same way many other modern industrialized economies have before it, except in a world where the rules of the global free trade order, developed, governed and backed by the US and other developed western multilateral institutions (World Bank, International Monetary Fund, World Trade Organization), favors already developed countries, making development difficult or inimitable. At the Bretton Woods Conference, the US representative, Harry Dexter White, insisted that the world reserve currency be the United States dollar instead of a proposed new international unit of currency and that the IMF and World Bank be under the purview of the United States. The Reagan administration and US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, and Donald Trump as a private citizen, made identical claims in the 1980s when Japan was undergoing its economic miracle which led Japan to signing the Plaza Accord. Like the TPP, it has been argued that the trade war is simply a more direct attempt to stifle China's development and is indicative of a shift in the US public perception of China as a \\"rival nation to be contained and beaten\\" among the two major political parties in Congress, the general public and even the business sector. It has been argued however that employing the Cold War playbook for the seemingly destined-to-fail Soviet Union, a state-run and largely closed economy will not work in the case of China because of its sheer size, growing wealth and vibrant economy. To halt development progress, particularly the Made in China 2025 plan, the US has responded by making it harder for Chinese tech companies from obtaining US technologies by investing in or acquiring US tech companies, and even attempting to stifle specific companies, namely Huawei, ZTE and ByteDance, from doing business domestically and abroad allegedly due to unspecified or speculative national security risks. With senior Trump administration officials such as John Bolton, Peter Navarro and Robert Lightizer demanding any comprehensive trade deal feature ‚Äústructural changes‚Äù which would essentially entail China surrendering its sovereignty over its economic system and planning (its Made in China 2025 industrial plan) and permanently ceding technology leadership to the US-an untenable situation to the Chinese- some see trade tensions continuing long into the future. In the face of the US tariffs in the trade war and the sanctions on Russia following the annexation of Crimea, China and Russia have cultivated closer economic ties as well as security and defense cooperation to offset the losses. =Belt and Road Initiative= Countries which signed cooperation documents related to the Belt and Road Initiative Another high-profile dispute among the United States and the People's Republic of China on the international stage is the US alarm about China‚Äôs growing geopolitical footprint in soft power diplomacy and international finance and trade. Particularly, this surrounds China‚Äôs Belt and Road Initiative (formerly \\"One Belt, One Road\\") which the Trump administration in particular as well as those in Western media have labeled the initiative as ‚Äúaggressive‚Äù ‚Äúdebt trap diplomacy‚Äù and pointed to the sale of an interest in a long-term lease by Sri Lanka in the Port of Hambantota to a Chinese state- owned company after Sri Lanka had defaulted on a loan to develop the port. Where others in the Anglosphere see malice and deceit in the BRI, others, while admitting it is not altruistic in nature, is peacefully pursuing economic interests and mutually beneficial trade ties for the procurement of resources and market access for its export-driven economy. In this perspective, China is utilizing and selling the expertise it has gained in poverty alleviation and infrastructure building used in its own journey to modernization to other developing countries. Additionally, a study conducted by the Rhodium Group had found only one case of asset seizure, the oft-cited Hambantota Port in Sri Lanka and the PRC is more likely to restructure or write-off the debt. The BRI has been a largely well-received and long-awaited alternative to developing countries that the US and other Western development banks have long neglected due to either slow investment returns or the imposition of what some recipient governments would see as onerous demands regarding political liberalization, transparency and human rights. Proponents of this line of thought dismiss claims of ‚Äúdebt trap diplomacy‚Äù as hypocritical and is propagandizing the initiative to disrupt the economic interests and peaceful rise of the PRC on the world stage.

US‚Äì Taiwan  The de facto US embassy, the American Institute in Taiwan in Taipei, Taiwan Although the United States recognized the People‚Äôs Republic of China in 1979, the US maintains de facto diplomatic relations and is bound to it by the Taiwan Relations Act, which ambiguously states, ‚Äúthe United States will make available to Taiwan such defense articles and defense services in such quantity as may be necessary to enable Taiwan to maintain a sufficient self- defense capabilities\\". The recent decade has seen an increasing frequency of US arms sales to Taiwan alongside expanding commercial ties. On December 16, 2015, the Obama administration announced a deal to sell $1.83 billion worth of arms to the Armed Forces of Taiwan, a year and eight months after U.S. Congress passed the Taiwan Relations Act Affirmation and Naval Vessel Transfer Act of 2014 to allow the sale of Oliver Hazard Perry-class frigates to Taiwan. The deal would include the sale of two decommissioned U.S. Navy frigates, anti-tank missiles, Assault Amphibious Vehicles, and FIM-92 Stinger surface- to-air missiles, amid the territorial disputes in the South China Sea. A new $250 million compound for the American Institute in Taiwan was unveiled in June 2018, accompanied by a \\"low-key\\" American delegation. The Chinese authorities denounced this action as violation of the \\"one China\\" policy statement and demanded the USA stop all relations with Taiwan without intercession of China. In 2019, the US approved the sale of 108 M1A2 Abrams tanks and 250 Stinger missiles for $2.2 billion and 66 F-16V fighter jets for $8 million. With such a large sale, China vowed to sanction any companies involved in the transactions. In May 2020,the U.S. Department of State approved a possible Foreign Military Sale of 18 MK-48 Mod 6 Advanced Technology Heavy Weight Torpedoes for Taiwan in a deal estimated to cost $180 million.

The Chinese believe the deployment of the US made Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile system on the peninsula is not for the stated purpose of protecting against a nuclear armed North Korea, but to degrade the PLA Rocket Force from carrying out a nuclear second strike in the event of a war with the United States.

Paperback edition 1997, Eos Books. It is the first book in a series involving the \\"League of Peoples\\", an assemblage of advanced species in the Milky Way galaxy. There is a \\"sub-series\\" involving just the character Festima Ramos, and sometimes the female Oar. The novel introduces many concepts in Gardner's \\"League of Peoples\\" universe, such as the Explorer Corps, Sentient Citizens, and the League itself. Backstory Through the course of the novel, Gardner provides a framework, background, and conceptual structure for his future narrative. In this back-story, humanity attains a technology of \\"spacetime distortion\\" to create an effective \\"star drive\\", thus leaving the solar system to explore and colonize planets orbiting other stars. Through this exploration and colonization effort, humans come into contact with many different species of intelligent life, sometimes vastly different in nature, sometimes of a much higher state of technological and evolutionary development. The more advanced beings have forms that stretch the humans' definition of life: they can appear as \\"a cloud of red smoke, a glowing cube\\"--or as nothing at all. These species have an organization for the galaxy, to control interstellar travel and contact; it is called the \\"League of Peoples\\". The League's primary rule is simple: no killing of other sentient beings. No war, no fatal violence; the League even prohibits lethal weapons in interstellar space. This is the guideline that determines sentience in the League's definition. Species that fail to obey this rule are restricted to their native solar systems, within which they can live as they please. If \\"dangerous non-sentients\\" attempt star travel, they are punished with death--delivered instantaneously, method unknown. (The actual implementation of this rule in practice, in specific and varying cases, is of course more complex and ambiguous than vague generalities can capture.) For species that do obey the league's primary commandment, however, the rewards can be great: advanced technologies are doled out to co- operative societies. Much of humanity (though not all; a remnant still exists on \\"Old Earth\\") has accepted this bargain: from a genetically-engineered New Earth, a unified human culture calling itself the Technocracy sends out a fleet of ships to explore and colonize new planets. The fleet is run under a quasi-military and naval structure, under the command of a High Council of admirals; the spaceships' crews function much as traditional navies did on Old Earth--except for engaging in combat. Exploring new planets, however, is dangerous work; in a society with no war, with little crime or violence, and with excellent advanced health care, the deaths of fit and intelligent young men and women--occasionally in the most extreme and elaborate ways--are a source of significant psychological trauma and social stress. The Technocracy has dealt with this problem by organizing a special Explorer Corps. These are individuals fit enough and smart enough to do the job, but afflicted with physical disadvantages (handicaps, diseases, of sometimes simple ugliness) that place them outside the norm of society. Candidates are identified in childhood, and conscripted into the Explorers; even if their deficiencies are easily correctible, they are left untreated. When these Explorers die in the course of their work--as they often do--the citizens of the Technocracy manage to cope with the shock. Plot summary The year is 2452. Festina Ramos is an Explorer, assigned to the Technocracy Fleet ship Jacaranda. Her specific physical \\"qualification\\" for her job is a large port-wine birthmark on her right cheek. She and her fellow Explorer and partner Yarrun Derigha (who is missing half his jaw) are the two Explorers assigned to the ship; they lead the isolated existence typical of Explorers, isolated from the healthy and attractive members of the fleet as from the \\"beautiful people\\" of the larger society. Then Festina and Yarrun are plunged into a crisis: they are assigned to escort a Fleet admiral named Chee to planet Melaquin. Melaquin is the great question mark in the Technocracy's domain: for forty years Explorers have landed there, only to lose contact and disappear, cause unknown. The High Council has now acquired the habit of sending its troublesome admirals to Melaquin in the company of a team of Explorers, to rid itself of embarrassments without scandal or controversy. The fact that Explorers are lost in the process is accepted--since Explorers are expendable. Admiral Chee is precisely the kind of embarrassment the high council wants to dispose of, quickly and quietly. Well beyond the century mark in age, when doses of Youthboost are no longer effective in prolonging his life and health, he is \\"clearly unstable, possibly senile\\"--or else \\"suffering from Don't-give-a- shit-itis\\". Though they try to avoid the duty, and then concoct a plan of escape from their apparent sentence to oblivion, Festina and Yarrun must accompany Chee to the surface of Melaqiuin. There, things go quickly and badly wrong: Festina accidentally kills Yarrun while attempting an emergency tracheotomy, Chee dies of a stroke, and Festina is cut off from her ship, alone on Melaquin. The planet reveals itself to be amazingly Earth-like--so much so that it is clearly not natural, but a result of terraforming and genetic modification. Festina quickly meets one of the inhabitants of the planet--\\"A nude woman made of glass...like an Art Deco figurine.\\" Their meeting does not go as the Explorer corps intends for first-contact situations. Eventually, though, the two establish contact; the glass woman introduces herself: \\"My name is Oar. An oar is an implement used to propel boats.\\" She has learned English from the previous Explorers who came to the planet. A product of sophisticated genetic engineering, she is human, but flawlessly beautiful and possessing enhanced strength and intelligence; yet she has the emotional maturity of a spoiled child. Through Oar, Festina gains contact with the dying subsurface civilization that lingers on Melaquin, begins to unravel the mysteries of the planet, and pursues the trail of the Explorers who came before her. Now \\"friends\\", Festina and Oar set off in search of the other Explorers and the truth behind Admiral Chee and the high council's involvement with Melaquin. The two find the Explorers building a spaceship; if the Explorers can get to interstellar space and send a distress call, the rules of the League may mandate that they be rescued and returned to society--if the Fleet does not stop them first. In due course Festina meets an old flame (a cross between a schoolgirl crush and the love of her life), who reveals himself to be a profound danger instead of a welcome ally. Oar sacrifices herself for her friend, and Festina manages to return to the Fleet and the Technocracy in a way she could never have anticipated.

UltraViolet, which had been scheduled to debut in the summer, spearheaded a campaign against Komen with the assistance of MoveOn.org and CREDO SuperPac. They collected nearly one million signatures on a petition that was delivered to the foundation. The foundation reversed its decision and reinstated Planned Parenthood's funding within a week of receiving the petition. General understanding is that Susan G. Komen Foundation stopped funding Planned Parenthood because Planned Parenthood performed abortions, not for breast cancer screenings, but was pressured into resuming funding because of UltraViolet's intervention. Following their victory, UltraViolet campaigned for the resignation of Karen Handel, the Komen Foundation vice president that orchestrated the effort to defund Planned Parenthood. Handel resigned shortly after. R. Kelley UltraViolet has made many strides in overcoming sexism through their words and actions. One of these strides include being part of the influence that made Sony decide to cut ties with R. Kelley due to allegations of sexual abuse of minors, by using the hashtag #MuteRKelly. Rick Ross UltraViolet led a campaign to get Reebok to end their relationship with rapper Rick Ross after he rapped about date raping a woman in his song \\"U.O.E.N.O.\\". NFL domestic abuse In 2014, following several incidents of domestic abuse by NFL players, UltraViolet called for the resignation of NFL commissioner Roger Goodell. The group flew aerial banners over three NFL stadiums with the message \\"#GoodellMustGo\\". Airport billboards In 2014 UltraViolet placed messages on billboards near airports in North Carolina, Texas, Louisiana and Ohio. The billboards were critical of state policies towards women.

The first group of Puerto Ricans immigrated to New York City in the mid-19th century when Puerto Rico was a Spanish colony and its people Spanish subjects. The following wave of Puerto Ricans to move to New York City did so after the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War in 1898. Puerto Ricans were no longer Spanish subjects and citizens of Spain, they were now Puerto Rican citizens of an American possession and needed passports to travel to the Contiguous United States. That was until 1917, when the United States Congress approved Jones-Shafroth Act which gave Puerto Ricans in Puerto Rico U.S. citizenship with certain limitations. Puerto Ricans living in the mainland United States however, were given full American citizenship and were allowed to seek political office in the states in which they resided. Two months later, when Congress passed the Selective Service Act, conscription was extended to the Puerto Ricans both on the island and on the mainland. It was expected that Puerto Rican men 18 years and older serve in the U.S. military during World War I. The Jones-Shafroth Act also allowed Puerto Ricans to travel between Puerto Rico and the U.S. mainland without the need of a passport, thereby becoming migrants. The advent of air travel was one of the principal factors that led to the largest wave of migration of Puerto Ricans to New York City in the 1950s, known as \\"The Great Migration\\". Similar to many other U.S. East Coast cities, Puerto Ricans were the first Hispanic group to move to New York City in large numbers. From 1970 until about 1990, the city's Puerto Rican population was at its height. They represented up to 80% of the city's Hispanic community and 12% of the city's total population. At that time nearly 70% of Puerto Ricans in the US mainland lived in New York City. It wasn't until the 1990s that the percentage Puerto Ricans that made up the city's Hispanic community, and the total population as a whole started to decrease, largely due to a declining Puerto Rican population, increasingly diversifying Hispanic community, and New York City's economy rebounding after deindustrialization, which ultimately resulted in a faster growing city population and dwindling Puerto Rican influence. However, since the early 2010s, New York's Puerto Rican population started to grow again, being in the midst of another major migration wave out of Puerto Rico. According to the 2010 census, Puerto Ricans represent 8.9 percent of New York City alone (32% of the city's Hispanic community), and 5.5% of New York State as a whole. Of over a million Puerto Ricans in the state, about 70% are present in the city, with the remaining portion scattered in the city's suburbs and other major cities throughout New York State. Although Florida has received some dispersal of the population, there has been a resurgence in Puerto Rican migration to New York and New Jersey, primarily for economic and cultural considerations ‚Äì consequently, the New York City Metropolitan Area has witnessed a significant increase in its Nuyorican population, individuals in the region of Puerto Rican descent, from 1,177,430 in 2010 to a Census-estimated 1,494,670 in 2016, maintaining its status by a significant margin as the most important cultural and demographic center for Puerto Ricans outside San Juan. Early 19th century During the 19th century, commerce existed between the ports of the East Coast of the United States and the Spanish colony of Puerto Rico. Ship records show that many Puerto Ricans traveled on ships that sailed from and to the U.S. and Puerto Rico. Many of them settled in places such as New York, Connecticut, and Massachusetts. Upon the outbreak of the American Civil War, many Puerto Ricans, such as Lieutenant Augusto Rodriguez, joined the ranks of the armed forces, however since Puerto Ricans were Spanish subjects they were inscribed as Spaniards.\\"The Puerto Rican Diaspora: historical perspectives\\"; By Carmen Teresa Whalen, V√≠ctor V√°zquez-Hernandez; page 176; Publisher: Temple University Press; ; The earliest Puerto Rican enclave in New York City was in Manhattan. Most of the Puerto Ricans who moved there came from well-to-do families or were people whose economic situation could permit them the luxury of traveling from the island to New York City by way of steamship, an expensive and long trip. Amongst the first Puerto Ricans to immigrate to New York City were men and women who were exiled by the Spanish Crown for their political beliefs and struggles for the cause of Puerto Rican independence. By 1850, Puerto Rico and Cuba were the only two remaining Spanish colonies in the New World. The Spanish Crown would either imprison or banish any person who promoted the independence of these two nations. Two of these exiles were Ram√≥n Emeterio Betances and Segundo Ruiz Belvis who together founded \\"The Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico\\" in New York. They were the planners of the short and failed 1868 revolt against Spain in Puerto Rico known as El Grito de Lares.Ojeda Reyes, F√©lix, El Desterrado de Par√≠s, pp. 94‚Äì104 Another prominent Puerto Rican who in 1871 immigrated to New York was Arturo Alfonso Schomburg, considered by many as the \\"Father of Black History.\\" He became a member of the \\"Revolutionary Committee of Puerto Rico\\" and was an outspoken promoter of not only the independence of Puerto Rico, but of Cuba also.[Antonio V√©lez Alvarado, amigo y colaborador consecuente de Mart√≠ y Betances, Author: D√°vila, Ovidio; pp. 11‚Äì13.; Publisher: San Juan, P.R. : Instituto de Cultura Puertorrique√±a (Institute of Puerto Rican Culture), 2002. (Spanish)] Origins of the Puerto Rican Flag Four other Puerto Ricans who moved to New York because of political reasons were Manuel Besosa, Antonio V√©lez Alvarado, Juan R√≠us Rivera, and Francisco Gonzalo Mar√≠n. These four Puerto Ricans joined the Cuban Liberation Army whose headquarters was in New York City. Some sources document Francisco Gonzalo Mar√≠n with presenting a Puerto Rican flag prototype in 1895 for adoption by the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee in New York City. Mar√≠n has since been credited by some with the flag's design.\\"Latin America's Wars Volume I: The Age of the Caudillo, 1791‚Äì1899\\"; by Robert L. Scheina; Pg. 359; Publisher: Potomac Books Inc.; 1 edition (January 2003); ; There is a letter written by Juan de Mata Terreforte which gives credit to Marin. The original contents of the letter in Spanish are the following: Which translated in English states the following: Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee (standing L-R) Manuel Besosa, Aurelio M√©ndez Mart√≠nez, and Sotero Figueroa (seated L-R) Juan de M. Terreforte, D. Jose Julio Henna and Roberto H. Todd It is also believed that on June 12, 1892, Antonio V√©lez Alvarado was at his apartment at 219 Twenty-Third Street in Manhattan, when he stared at a Cuban flag for a few minutes, and then took a look at the blank wall in which it was being displayed. V√©lez suddenly perceived an optical illusion, in which he perceived the image of the Cuban flag with the colors in the flag's triangle and stripes inverted. Almost immediately he visited a nearby merchant, Domingo Peraza, from whom he bought some crepe paper to build a crude prototype. He later displayed his prototype in a dinner meeting at his neighbor's house, where the owner, Micaela Dalmau vda. de Carreras, had invited Jos√© Mart√≠ as a guest. In a letter written by Maria Manuela (Mima) Besosa, the daughter of the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee member Manuel Besosa, she stated that she sewed the flag. This created a belief that her father could have been its designer. Even though Mar√≠n presented the Puerto Rican Flag in New York's \\"Chimney Corner Hotel\\", it may never be known who designed the current flag. What is known, however, is that on December 22, 1895, the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee officially adopted a design which is today the official flag of Puerto Rico. In 1897, Antonio Mattei Lluberas, a wealthy coffee plantation owner from Yauco, visited the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee in New York City. There he met with Ram√≥n Emeterio Betances, Juan de Mata Terreforte and Aurelio M√©ndez Martinez and together they proceeded to plan a major coup. The uprising, which became known as the Intentona de Yauco was to be directed by Betances, organized by Aurelio Mendez Mercado and the armed forces were to be commanded by General Juan R√≠us Rivera from Cuba.\\"Historia militar de Puerto Rico\\"; by Hector Andres Negroni (Author); Pages: 305‚Äì06; Publisher: Sociedad Estatal Quinto Centenario (1992); Language: Spanish; ; The political immigration to New York practically came to a halt in 1898 after the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War when Puerto Rico became a possession of the United States. It is estimated that 1,800 Puerto Rican citizens (they were not American citizens until 1917) had immigrated to New York during this period. World War I era Cover of The San Juan News announcing the Supreme Court decision in the Isabel Gonzalez case of 1904 In 1902, the United States Treasury Department issued new immigration guidelines that changed the status of all Puerto Ricans to \\"foreigners.\\" Isabel Gonzalez was a young single mother who was expecting her second child. Her fianc√©, who was in New York, sent for her with the intention of getting married. When Gonzalez arrived in New York, she and all the Puerto Ricans who were with her, were detained in Ellis Island and denied entry. She was accused of being an alien and as an unwed parent she was deemed as a burden to the welfare system of the country. Gonzalez challenged the Government of the United States in the groundbreaking case \\"GONZALES v. WILLIAMS' (her surname was misspelled by immigration officials). The Supreme Court ruled that under the immigration laws Gonz√°lez was not an alien, and therefore could not be denied entry into New York. It also stated that Puerto Ricans were not U.S. citizens, they were \\"noncitizen nationals.\\" Gonzalez, who became an activist on behalf of all Puerto Ricans, paved the way for the Jones-Shafroth Act, which conferred United States citizenship on all citizens of Puerto Rico. In 1917, the United States entered World War I and that same year the United States Congress approved the Jones- Shafroth Act which gave Puerto Ricans U.S. citizenship. Puerto Ricans no longer needed a passport to travel to the U.S. and were allowed to seek public office in the mainland U.S. The economic situation in the island was bad and continued to worsen as a result of the many hurricanes which destroyed most of its crops. Many Puerto Rican families migrated to the United States, the bulk of whom went to New York, in search of a better way of life. In New York, they faced the same hardships and discrimination that earlier groups of immigrants, such as the Irish, the Italians, and the Jews, had faced before them. It was difficult for them to find well paying jobs because of the language barrier and their lack of technical working skills. The few men who found jobs worked for low salaries in factories. The women usually stayed home as housewives and tended to their children. Those who did not find jobs had the option of joining the United States Military. Prior to the Jones-Shafroth Act, Puerto Ricans in the mainland United States as all other non-citizens, who were permanent residents were required to register with the Selective Service System by law and could be drafted, however one of the effects of the Act was that all Puerto Ricans were now eligible for the military \\"draft\\" (conscription). One of the military units at that time was New York's U.S. 369th Infantry Regiment. Rafael Hern√°ndez was a Puerto Rican who served in the almost all Afro-American unit. The unit fought against the Germans in France and became known as the \\"Harlem Hell Fighters\\". Hern√°ndez, his brother Jesus and 16 other Puerto Ricans was assigned to the United States Army's Harlem Hell fighters musical band, the Orchestra Europe. 1924 Baseball Game between the San Juan BBC and Porto Rico Stars in New York Nero Chen was one of the many Puerto Ricans who settled in East Harlem. He became the first Puerto Rican boxer to gain acclaim when in 1917 he fought against \\"Panama Joe Gans\\" at Harlem's Palace Casino which was located at 28 East 135th St., between Fifth and Madison Avenues, in Manhattan.\\"Pioneros Puertorrique√±os en Nueva York\\"; by Joaquin Colon Lopez; pages: 229, 230; Publisher: Arte Publico Press (November 2001); ; As evidenced by an early 1924 poster, migrants in New York organized baseball teams which played against each other. The poster announces a game which was held at Howard Field in Brooklyn between two teams, the San Juan B.B.C. and the Porto Rican Stars, made of Puerto Ricans from the East Side section of Manhattan. As the economic situation in the United States worsened in a prelude to the Great Depression, many Puerto Ricans in the mainland found themselves competing with other groups for the positions of unskilled labor such as dishwashers, maintenance and laundry workers. This led to the \\"Harlem Riots\\" of July 1926. between unemployed Jews and Puerto Ricans. Various Puerto Rican organizations in East Harlem, organized a media campaign to ease the tensions between the groups involved and called upon the mayor, governor of the state to restore order and provide protection to the area.\\"Leonard Covello and the Making of Benjamin Franklin High School\\"; By Michael C. Johanek, John L. Puckett; Page 66; Published 2007 Temple University Press; In 1937, Oscar Garcia Rivera, Sr. (1900‚Äì1969), a native of Mayag√ºez and resident of East Harlem, became the first Puerto Rican to be elected to public office in the continental United States as a member of the New York State Assembly. A witness of the discrimination which Puerto Ricans were subject to, he created the \\"Unemployment Insurance Bill\\" which paved the way for the passage of bills which established minimum hours and wages for working people, the creation of a Wage Board within the Labor Department, and the right of employees to organize and negotiate grievances. In 1956, he also became the first Puerto Rican to be nominated as the Republican candidate for Justice of the City Court.  Tabaqueros  Puerto Rican Tabaquero hand rolling cigars Tabaqueros are tobacco workers. The tobacco industry was extremely popular but increased in popularity and manufacturing during the first decade of the United States domination of exportation. By 1901, exportation Puerto Rico's shifted from importing to exporting, and cigars making began to increase. By the 1920s, Puerto Rico the tobacco-processing industry grew thirty times in exportation to when it began in 1901.Quintero- Rivera, A. G. ‚ÄúSocialist and Cigarmaker: Artisans' Proletarianization in the Making of the Puerto Rican Working Class.‚Äù Latin American Perspectives, vol. 10, no. 2/3, 1983, pp. 19‚Äì38. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/2633457. This provided thousands of migrants with job opportunities to move to the United States in search for a better life economically. During this time of industrial prosperity the Puerto Rican community grew in cities like New York City. Bernardo Vega explained in his memoir ‚ÄúMemoirs of Bernardo Vega‚Äù the lifestyle of the working Puerto Rican community in New York City more importantly the tabaquero culture. Tabaqueros were very politically and socially involved in their community, and were successfully organized collectively as a group.Bernardo Vega, Memoirs of Bernardo Vega: A contribution to the history of the Puerto Rican community in New York, (Monthly Review Press, New York, 1984) Politically tabaqueros were suggested to be socialist- oriented, and were influenced by the Jewish Workmen Circle that were mutual aid societies of the working- class socialists. These mutual aid groups, tobacco worker's associations were no mimic to those of already established by other ethnic working class, mainly they were recreated organizations that were known to the workers back on the Island. The life of a tabaquero was very simple during these times, but were a very progressive working community that understood how cultural form/discrimination could reflect political will towards the community.Vazquez, David J. \\"Jesus Colon and the development of insurgent consciousness.\\" CENTRO: Journal of the Center for Puerto Rican Studies, vol. 21, no. 1, 2009, p. 78+. Academic OneFile, http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A288980066/AONE?u=cuny_hunter&sid;=AONE&xid;=538f4f8d. Accessed 1 July 2019. The Tabaqueros held a sense of pride in their work as well as their eloquent knowledge of politics and culture, which they would learning during working hours and events of associations like Circulo de Tabaqueros. Hand rolling cigars gave pride to the workers as they found this job to be more on the artistic side rather than domestic. They thought of themselves more like an ‚Äúartist rather than a worker.‚Äù Cigar makers would sit in front of tables for hours and hand roll each cigar. Since this was a very tedious process, workers would pay 15-20 cents each week for someone to read them the newspaper or books while they worked. This was more of a custom in the Puerto Rican cigar making factories. Many newspapers and magazines that would advocate social and political doctrines were published in Spanish in NEW York City: Cultura Proletria an anarchist read; more general-topics El Heraldo; La Prensa, was a daily that began to be published in 1913. Mainly at this time the readers were women, that would read but women during this time were not just reading at factories but also rolling the cigars themselves.By the 1920 the economic depression hit the industrial industry hard. Many cigar workers/ tabaqueros were going on strike due to pay. Tabaqueros traditionally were known in the community for being the highest paid workers in the Puerto Rican Community. However now with the crisis, factories began to move and seek workers like women to take over the tabaquero skill for cheap labor. Although through the companies that taught women the trade of tobacco, it also dropped the price of the labor but provided an increasing growth of working Puerto Rican women to the community. By 1920 there were 8,766 working women in these factories just like the men. Women that worked in these tobacco factories mainly did leaf stripping and were considered to be equal in the structural exploitation of labor as the men that worked in these factories as well. For the unions of the tabaqueros the difference in sex/gender of the worker did not matter in the fight against exploitation. World War II and The Great Migration A Puerto Rican woman working in a garment factory Several factors contributed and led to what came to be known as \\"The Great Migration\\" of Puerto Ricans to New York. These were the following: the Great Depression, World War II and the advent of air travel. The Great Depression which spread throughout the world was also felt in Puerto Rico. Since the island's economy was and still is dependent to that of the United States, it was to be expected that when the American banks and industries began to fail the effect would be felt in the island. Unemployment was on the rise as a consequence and therefore, many families fled to the mainland U.S.A. in search of jobs. The outbreak of World War II opened the doors to many of the migrants who were searching for jobs. Since a large portion of the male population of the U.S. was sent to war, there was a sudden need of manpower to fulfill the jobs left behind. Puerto Ricans, both male and female, found themselves employed in factories and ship docks, producing both domestic and warfare goods. The new migrants gained the knowledge and working skills which in the future would serve them well. The military also provided a steady source of income, in 1944, the Puerto Rican WAC unit, Company 6, 2nd Battalion, 21st Regiment of the Women's Army Auxiliary Corps, a segregated Hispanic unit, was assigned to the New York Port of Embarkation, after their basic training at Fort Oglethorpe, Georgia. They were assigned to work in military offices which planned the shipment of troops around the world.\\"LAS WACS\\"-Participacion de la Mujer Boricua en la Seginda Guerra Mundial; by: Carmen Garcia Rosado; page 60; 1ra.

The advent of air travel provided Puerto Ricans with an affordable and faster way of travel to New York. The one thing that most migrants had in common was that they wanted a better way of life than was available in Puerto Rico, and although each held personal reasons for migrating, their decision generally was rooted in the island's impoverished conditions as well as the public policies that sanctioned migration. In 1948, the Migration Division of the Department of Labor of Puerto Rico opened its office in New York City. Its mission was to mediate between the island and the New York/Puerto Rican community, assuage the adjustment experience of new arrivals, and generally inform them about jobs, housing and other critical concerns.\\"Images of America; Pioneros II-Puerto Ricans in New York City 1948‚Äì1998\\"; by: Virginia Sanchez Korrol and Pedro Juan Hernandez; It wasn't long before the Puerto Rican \\"Barrios\\" in the Williamsburg, Bushwick, South Bronx, Spanish Harlem, and Manhattan's Lower East Side began to resemble \\"Little Puerto Ricos\\" with their \\"Bodegas\\" (small grocery stores) and \\"Piragueros\\" (Puerto Rican shaved ice venders) in every corner. It is estimated that from 1946 to 1950 there were 31,000 Puerto Rican migrants each year to New York. Puerto Rican culture in New York A pirag√ºero in NYC posing with his Piragua pushcart in the 1920s Puerto Ricans began to form their own small \\"barrios\\", in The Bronx, Brooklyn and in East Harlem (which would become known as Spanish Harlem). It was in East Harlem where the Puerto Rican migrants established a cultural life of great vitality and sociality. They also participated in some of the sports, such as boxing and baseball which were first introduced in the island by the American Armed Forces after the Spanish‚ÄìAmerican War.Historia del Beisbol en Puerto Rico Puerto Ricans who moved to New York not only took with them their customs, traditions, they also took with them their piraguas, a Puerto Rican frozen treat, shaped like a pyramid, made of shaved ice and covered with fruit flavored syrup.\\"The Columbia History of Latinos in the United States Since 1960\\"; By David Gregory Guti√©rrez; pg. 98; Published 2004 by Columbia University Press; According to Holding Aloft the Banner of Ethiopia: by Winston James, piraguas were introduced in New York by Puerto Ricans as early as 1926. Puerto Rican music Teatro Puerto Rico Puerto Rican music flourished with the likes of Rafael Hern√°ndez and Pedro Flores who formed the \\"Trio Borincano\\" and gained recognition in the city. Myrta Silva who later joined Hernandez's \\"Cuarteto Victoria\\" also gained fame as a singer after the group traveled and played throughout the United States. The South Bronx became a hub for Puerto Rican music. Theaters which had served to previous groups of immigrants, such as the Irish and the Italians, for their dramatic works or vaudeville style shows, now served the growing Puerto Rican and Latino population with musical performances from musicians from Puerto Rico and Latin America. Plus, the local Bronx's burgeoning Latino musicians. Among these theaters were the historical Teatro Puerto Rico at E. 138th St. and Hunts Point Palace in Southern Blvd. During the Teatro Puerto Rico's \\"golden era\\", which lasted from 1947 to 1956, musician Jos√© Feliciano made his stateside debut New York City also became the mecca for freestyle music in the 1980s, of which Puerto Rican singer-songwriters represented an integral component. Puerto Rican influence in popular music continues in the 21st century, encompassing major artists such as Jennifer Lopez. 1950s The third great wave of domestic migration from Puerto Rico came after World War II. Nearly 40,000 Puerto Ricans settled in New York City in 1946, and 58,500 in 1952‚Äì53. Many soldiers who returned after World War II made use of the GI Bill and went to college. Puerto Rican women confronted economic exploitation, discrimination, racism, and the insecurities inherent in the migration process on a daily basis, however they fared better than did men in the job market. The women left their homes for the factories in record numbers. By 1953, Puerto Rican migration to New York reached its peak when 75,000 people left the island. Ricky Martin at the annual Puerto Rican parade in New York City Operation Bootstrap (\\"Operaci√≥n Manos a la Obra\\") is the name given to the ambitious projects which industrialized Puerto Rico in the mid-20th century engineered by Teodoro Moscoso. The industry that was attracted did not provide sufficient jobs. With increased population growth and displacement from traditional labor pursuits, the growing population could not be accommodated. Much of the surplus labor migrated to the United States. In 1948, Puerto Ricans elected their first governor Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, who together with his government initiated a series of social and economic reforms with the introduction of new programs in the island. Some of these programs met some resistance from the American government and therefore, the local government had some trouble implementing the same. New York Mayor Robert F. Wagner, Jr. began a campaign to recruit Puerto Rican laborers in the island to work in the city's factories. Mayor Wagner figured that the city would benefit greatly by the luring of what was considered to be \\"cheap labor\\". Discrimination was rampant in the United States and it was no different in New York. As stated by Lolita Lebr√≥n, there were signs in restaurants which read \\"No dogs or Puerto Ricans allowed\\". The Puerto Rican Nationalist Party established an office in New York in the 1950s and attracted many migrants. Leaders of the party conceived a plan that would involve an attack on the Blair House with the intention of assassinating United States President Harry S. Truman and an attack on the House of Representatives. These events had a negative impact on the Puerto Rican migrants. Americans viewed Puerto Ricans as anti-Americans and the discrimination against them became even more widespread. Many Puerto Ricans were able to overcome these obstacles and became respected members of their communities. Many such as Antonia Pantoja, established organizations such as \\"ASPIRA\\", that helped their fellow countrymen to reach their goals. In 1954, a group of politicians close to Carmine Gerard DeSapio, then the leader of Tammany Hall, chose Tony M√©ndez to lead the eastern section of the district, known as the 14th Assembly District. He was chosen by the group, which was also known as the Democratic County Committee, because in those days there was no direct election of district leaders. Plus, the influx of Puerto Ricans moving to the 14th Assembly District, in which East Harlem is located, replaced the members of the Italian Community who preceded them and eventually moved out. M√©ndez became the first native-born Puerto Rican to become a district leader of a major political party in New York City.Tony Mendez obituary, The New York Times The first New York Puerto Rican Day Parade, founded by Tony M√©ndez was held on Sunday, April 13, 1958 in the \\"Barrio\\" in Manhattan. Its first President was Victor L√≥pez and it was coordinated by Jos√© Caballero. The grand marshals were Oscar Gonz√°lez Suarez and Tony M√©ndez Esq. Prominent personalities from Puerto Rico headed by then Governor Luis Mu√±oz Mar√≠n, attended the initial parade. The parade was organized as a show of Puerto Rican pride and is a tradition which not only continues today in the city of New York but, that has also extended to other cities such as Chicago, Illinois and Orlando, Florida. By 1960, the United States census showed that there were well over 600,000 New Yorkers of Puerto Rican birth or parentage. Estimates were that more than one million Puerto Ricans had migrated during that period. Nuyorican Movement The Nuyorican Poets Caf√© Puerto Rican writer Jes√∫s Col√≥n founded an intellectual movement involving poets, writers, musicians and artists who are Puerto Rican or of Puerto Rican descent and who live in or near New York City which became known as the Nuyorican Movement. The phenomenon of the \\"Nuyoricans\\" came about when many Puerto Ricans who migrated to New York City faced difficult situations and hardships, such as racial discrimination. Leading voices include Giannina Braschi, Sandra Maria Esteves, and Tato Laviera. A \\"Nuyorican\\" subculture developed. In 1980, Puerto Rican poets Miguel Algar√≠n, Miguel Pi√±ero and Pedro Pietri established the \\"Nuyorican Poets Caf√©\\" on Manhattan's Lower East Side (236 E 3rd Street, between Avenues B and C) which is now considered a New York landmark. Late 20th century and early 21st century By 1964, the Puerto Rican community made up 9.3 percent of the total New York City's population. The Puerto Rican migrants who gained economic success began to move away from the \\"Barrios\\" and settled in Westchester County, Staten Island, and Long Island or moved to other cities in other states like New Jersey (especially North Jersey which is still a part of the NYC metropolitan area), Pennsylvania, Connecticut, and Florida, among others. New immigrants from the Dominican Republic, Mexico and South America moved into the Barrios which were once mainly occupied by the Puerto Ricans. The 1970s saw what became known as reverse-migration. Many Puerto Ricans returned to the island to buy homes and to invest in local businesses. Puerto Ricans have made many important contributions to the cultural and political spheres of New York and the society of the United States in general. They have contributed in the fields of entertainment, the arts, music, industry, science, politics, and military. Other Puerto Ricans have moved from New York to settle in smaller cities throughout the northeastern United States. For example, in 2009 Puerto Ricans alone made up 29.1% of Reading, Pennsylvania's population, which was over 53% Hispanic, and 25.0% of Lawrence, Massachusetts' population, which was over 70% Hispanic. Chart reflecting Puerto Rican migration in the United States circa 1980s However, since 2006, there has been a resurgence in immigration from Puerto Rico to New York City and New Jersey, with an apparently multifactorial allure to Puerto Ricans, primarily for economic and cultural considerations. The Census estimate for the New York City, the city proper with the largest Puerto Rican population by a significant margin, has increased from 723,621 in 2010, to 730,848 in 2012; while New York State's Puerto Rican population was estimated to have increased from 1,070,558 in 2010, to 1,103,067 in 2013. New York State overall has also resumed its net in-migration of Puerto Rican Americans since 2006, a dramatic reversal from being the only state to register a decrease in its Puerto Rican population between 1990 and 2000. The Puerto Rican population of New York State, still the largest in the United States, is estimated by the U.S. Census Bureau to have increased from 1,070,558 in 2010 to 1,103,067 in 2013. New York State gained more Puerto Rican migrants from Puerto Rico as well as from elsewhere on the mainland between 2006 and 2012 than any other state in absolute numbers. Also, unlike the initial pattern of migration several decades ago, this second Puerto Rican migration into New York and surrounding states is being driven by movement not only into New York City proper, but also into the city's surrounding suburban areas, such that the New York City Metropolitan Area gained the highest number of additional Puerto Rican Americans of any metropolitan area between 2010 and 2016, to 1,494,670 in 2016. National Puerto Rican Parade in New York City, 2005 Northern New Jersey has also received a robust influx of Puerto Rican migration in the 21st century, given its proximity to both New York City's and Philadelphia's Puerto Rican establishments. Within the metropolitan area surrounding New York City, Paterson and Newark in New Jersey are important homes for Puerto Rican Americans. Jose \\"Joey\\" Torres was elected mayor of Paterson in 2014, where he had served two prior terms as mayor as well; while Luis A. Quintana, born in A√±asco, Puerto Rico, was sworn in as Newark's first Latino mayor in November 2013, assuming the unexpired term of Cory Booker, who vacated the position to become a U.S. Senator from New Jersey. However, as Puerto Ricans continue to climb the socioeconomic ladder and achieve a greater degree of professional occupations, the community is also purchasing homes in New Jersey's more affluent suburban towns. After Hurricane Maria struck Puerto Rico in September 2017, devastating the infrastructure of the island, New York State was expected to be the likeliest destination for Puerto Rican migrants to the U.S. mainland when premised upon family ties, with New Jersey being the third likeliest destination. The 5.6 million Puerto Ricans living stateside in 2017, were largely concentrated in Florida, NY and NJ; 20% in Florida, 20% in New York, and 8% in New Jersey. Enclaves Brooklyn has several neighborhoods with a Puerto Rican presence, and many of the ethnic Puerto Rican neighborhoods in Brooklyn formed before the Puerto Rican neighborhoods in the South Bronx because of the work demand in the Brooklyn Navy Yard in the 1940s and 50s. Bushwick has the highest concentration of Puerto Ricans in Brooklyn. Other neighborhoods with significant populations include Williamsburg, East New York, Brownsville, Coney Island, Red Hook, and Sunset Park. In Williamsburg; Graham Avenue is nicknamed \\"Avenue of Puerto Rico\\" because of the high density and strong ethnic enclave of Puerto Ricans who have been living in the neighborhood since the 1950s. The Puerto Rican Day Parade is also hosted on the avenue. Ridgewood, Queens, also has a significant Puerto Rican population, as does the neighboring community of Bushwick, Brooklyn. Puerto Rican neighborhoods in Manhattan include Spanish Harlem and Loisaida. Spanish Harlem was \\"Italian Harlem\\" from the 1880s until the 1940s. By 1940, however, the name \\"Spanish Harlem\\" was becoming widespread, and by 1950, the area was predominately Puerto Rican and African American. Loisaida is an enclave east of Avenue A that originally comprised German, Jewish, Irish, and Italian working class residents who lived in tenements without running water; the German presence, already in decline, virtually ended after the General Slocum disaster in 1904. Since them, the community has become Puerto Rican and Latino in character, despite the \\"gentrification\\" that has affected the East Village and the Lower East Side since the late 20th century. Staten Island has a fairly large Puerto Rican population along the North Shore, especially in the Mariners' Harbor, Arlington, Elm Park, Graniteville, Port Richmond, and Stapleton neighborhoods, where the population is in the 20% range. In New York and many other cities, Puerto Ricans usually live in close proximity with Dominicans and African Americans. High concentrations of Puerto Ricans are also present in numerous public housing developments throughout the city. Puerto Ricans are present in large numbers throughout the Bronx, which has the highest percentage of Puerto Ricans of any borough. In some places in the South Bronx, Spanish is the primary language. Throughout the 1970s, the South Bronx became known as the epitome of urban decay, but has since made a recovery. Puerto Rican population in New York As of 1990, New Yorkers of Puerto Rican descent (Nuyoricans), numbered 143,974. Nearly 41,800 state residents (Nuyoricans) in 1990 had lived in Puerto Rico in 1985. According to the Census taken in the year 2000, Puerto Rican migrants made up 1.2% of the total population of the United States, with a population of well over 3 million Puerto Ricans (including those of Puerto Rican descent). If taken into account together with the almost 4 million Puerto Ricans who are U.S. citizens (nevertheless, excluded by the U.S. Census statistics of U.S. population), Puerto Ricans make up about 2.5% of the total population of U.S. citizens around the world (within and outside the U.S. mainland). 2010 Puerto Rican population by borough New York City's total Puerto Rican population was 723,621 and they represented 8.9% of the population. The Puerto Rican population and the percentage Puerto Ricans make up of each borough, as of the 2010 census, is: *Bronx ‚Äì 298,921 (21.6%) *Brooklyn ‚Äì 176,528 (7.0%) *Manhattan ‚Äì 107,774 (6.8%) *Queens ‚Äì 102,881 (4.6%) *Staten Island ‚Äì 37,517 (8.0%) Puerto Rican influence Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, representing parts of The Bronx and Queens, is the youngest woman ever to be elected to Congress in November 2018. In July 1930, Puerto Rico's Department of Labor established an employment service in New York City.Chenault 1938: 72 The Migration Division (known as the \\"Commonwealth Office\\"), also part of Puerto Rico's Department of Labor, was created in 1948, and by the end of the 1950s, was operating in 115 cities and towns stateside.Lapp 1990 The Department of Puerto Rican Affairs in the United States was established in 1989 as a cabinet-level department in Puerto Rico. Currently, the Commonwealth operates the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, which is headquartered in Washington, D.C. and has 12 regional offices throughout the United States. Puerto Ricans in New York have preserved their cultural heritage by being involved actively in the different political and social rights movements in the United States. They founded \\"Aspira\\", a leader in the field of education, in 1961. The ASPIRA Association is now one of the largest national Latino nonprofit organizations in the United States.Pantoja 2002: 93‚Äì108 Other educational and social organizations founded by Puerto Ricans in New York and else where are the National Puerto Rican Coalition in Washington, DC, the National Puerto Rican Forum, the Puerto Rican Family Institute, Boricua College, the Center for Puerto Rican Studies of the City University of New York at Hunter College, the Puerto Rican Legal Defense and Education Fund, the National Conference of Puerto Rican Women, and the New York League of Puerto Rican Women, Inc., among others. Hostos Community College in the Bronx, was named after a Puerto Rican Eugenio Maria de Hostos, and was founded as an all-Puerto Rican college. The college now accepts students of all races, however it largely caters to Hispanics with up to 80% of its students being of Hispanic descent. Boricua College is another originally all-Puerto Rican college with campuses in East Williamsburg and Manhattan. Cultural ties between New York and Puerto Rico are strong. In September 2017, following the immense destruction wrought upon Puerto Rico by Hurricane Maria, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo led an aid delegation to San Juan, including engineers form the New York Power Authority to help restore Puerto Rico's electrical grid. Subsequently, on the one-year anniversary of the storm, in September 2018, Governor Cuomo announced plans for the official New York State memorial to honor the victims of Hurricane Maria, to be built in Battery Park City, Manhattan, citing the deep cultural connections shared between New Yorkers and Puerto Rican Americans.

A nearby locality was later named after the vessel. The wreck is a popular diving venue.  History  The ship was built during World War II by Bethlehem-Fairfield Shipyards in Baltimore as part of the United States' Liberty ship program and was originally scheduled to be named George M. Shriver. It was launched on October 11, 1943. However, on October 20, the vessel was reassigned to the Norwegian Shipping & Trade Mission, was re-christened Viggo Hansteen. and saw war service for about 18 months, primarily in the Mediterranean and was crewed by mariners of various nationalities. It served as a troopship and transported cargo, in convoys that were sometimes attacked by German aircraft and U-boats. A murder-suicide took place on board Viggo Hansteen in August 1944, while the ship was at Naples (some sources say Piombino); Canadian radio operator Maude Steane is reported to have been shot by another crew member, who then killed himself. After the war it was sold to a Greek shipping company and renamed Alkimos, after a word meaning \\"strong\\" and a Greek god, √Ålkimos. As Alkimos, the ship plied the world's oceans for some two decades. In March 1963, the vessel was on a voyage from Jakarta to Bunbury when it struck a reef on the 19 March 1963 near Beagle Island off the Western Australian coast. It was salvaged and towed to Fremantle, the port city for Perth, Western Australia, where it underwent repairs for two months. After settlement of a dispute concerning payment for the repairs, the Alkimos left Fremantle under tow by an ocean-going tug, the Pacific Reserve from Hong Kong. Only a few hours out of port, on 31 May 1963, the tow line gave way and the Alkimos was driven onto the shore. Although the ship remained intact, it could not be floated off at that time, and so it was filled with water to secure it in place and left in the charge of an on-board caretaker. Another tug, the Pacific Star, under command of Captain E.R. Francisco, returned in January 1964 and the ship was refloated on 14 February 1964, but the planned journey to Manila had hardly begun when the tug was seized on 21 February 1964 at sea by authorities and the Alkimos was left anchored. On 2 May 1964, the vessel broke anchor and was driven onto the Eglinton Rocks near present-day Yanchep, Western Australia. On this occasion it was more severely damaged, and all thought of salvaging it intact was abandoned. It was later sold by the owners for scrap. However, in 1969, salvage workers were driven off the wreck by a fire. After that time, the partly dismantled remains of the ship sat in several metres of water, visible to visitors, before gradually disintegrating.

Miloslav Kabel√°ƒç belongs to the foremost Czech symphonists, whose work is sometimes compared with Anton√≠n Dvo≈ô√°k's and Bohuslav Martin≈Ø's. In the communist period Kabel√°ƒç's work found itself on the periphery of official attention and was performed only sporadically and in a limited choice of compositions.  Life  Kabel√°ƒç was born in Prague. In 1928-31 he studied at the Prague Conservatory as a pupil of Karel Boleslav Jir√°k, simultaneously (in 1930-31) he was a pupil of Alois H√°ba. In 1932-54 Kabel√°ƒç was employed by Prague Radio. From 1957 to 1968 he worked as a teacher at the Prague Conservatory. During his life Kabel√°ƒç was active in Umƒõleck√° beseda, in the Federation of Czechoslovak Composers and other organisations. In the 1960s he tried to revive contacts with Western modern music and composers, but after the 1968 Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia he was silenced. His works were performed only abroad from then on. Works Miloslav Kabel√°ƒç belongs to the most distinguished Czech composers of the 20th century. He soon created a distinctive style for which the auspicious melody and harmony, the ingenious polyphony and the consistent architecture of both small and large compositions are typical. His utmost expression was his conscious work with the intervals in which he emerged from non-European musical cultures. Kabel√°ƒç used here, for example, artificially numbered scale - mods whose internal course has a larger range than an octave. He also denounced the term artificial tonal music, especially for the musical theoretical justification of his economical melody. In the interval structure, he also explored the possibilities of so-called interval augmentation and diminution, inversion and other practices brought to the music by the so- called 2nd Viennese school. The first mature compositions of this style include the anti-cantata Do not retreat! (1939), performed for the first time after the end of the Second World War (28 October 1945). At the beginning and in the years of war, Kabel√°ƒç focused on chamber opuses (Wind Sextet, Sonata for cello and piano, Two pieces for violin and piano) and Symphonic (1st and 2nd symphonies). Over time, work with large occupation (8th symphony, Mysterium of Time, Reflections), which are his most significant works - along with songs for drums that have already come on European stages at the time (Eight Inventions for percussions). In the 1960s, which gave him wide recognition in the form of the State Prize and Foreign Orders, he received a number of stimuli from foreign avant-garde, which he had organically incorporated into his compositional morphology. He also excelled in pedagogical activities and interest in non-European cultures. He was one of the first promoters of electro-acoustic music in Czechoslovakia. Numerous choreographers have also taken up his work \\"Eight Inventions for Percussion Instruments. \\", Alvin Ailey with the American Dance Theater are the most prominent among them, his choreography titled Streams, was performed in Prague too in 1979.

Sometimes it is applied more broadly to the generative parts of gymnosperms, ferns, horsetails, and lycophytes, though they produce neither fruit nor flower. Since the works of Andrea Caesalpino (1519‚Äì1603) the characters of fructification have been extensively used as a basis for the scientific classification of plants. Carl Linnaeus (1707‚Äì1778) raised the description of the parts of fructification to an unprecedented level of precision. He insisted that genera and the higher groups of plants must be characterised in terms of the fructification alone without using vegetative parts (which can be used only to characterise the species within genera). At that time it was believed that all plants have flowers and fruits. It was not until the nineteenth century that the important difference between seeds and spores was recognised and the use of terms flower and fruit was restricted to the flowering plants (angiosperms). Later plant taxonomists used a more balanced approach and re-introduced the use of the vegetative parts of the plant as a basis for characters at different levels of taxonomic hierarchy.

He operated the Kansas City, Missouri-based Heart of America Sports Attractions promotion from 1963 to 1986, and served three terms as the president of the National Wrestling Alliance from 1978 to 1980, 1982 to 1985, and 1986 to 1987.  Early life  Geigel was born on October 1, 1924, in Algona, Iowa to Frederick Samuel and Leota May Geigel. He attended Algona High School, graduating in 1942. After graduating, Geigel enlisted in the United States Navy. He served in the Asiatic-Pacific Theater of World War II as a Seabee. After leaving the Navy, Geigel began studying in the University of Iowa in 1946. He graduated in 1950 with a degree in physical education. Geigel was a champion amateur wrestler during his college years, coming in third place during the 1948 NCAA Championships in the weight division.  Professional wrestling career  Geigel was recruited into professional wrestling by Alphonse Bisigniano. He debuted in 1950 in Texas. Wrestling primarily in Pinkie George's Midwest Wrestling Association out of Kansas City, and also in Amarillo, Texas, Geigel generally played the part of the \\"heel\\" or antagonist. He became a full-time professional wrestler in 1952. Though he was generally introduced as being from Algona, Iowa, he was billed as \\"Texas\\" Bob Geigel. He also wrestled as A-Bomber while working under a mask in Amarillo. Geigel frequently held tag team championships in his home promotion, holding the NWA Central States World Tag Team Championship four times,NWA World Tag Team Championship (Central States) at Wrestling-Titles.com and the NWA North American Tag Team Championship (Central States version) nine times. Geigel had a long-standing feud with former tag team partner Bob Brown in Kansas City. He officially retired from the ring in 1976, but continued to wrestle sporadically in the 1980s.  Promoting career  Geigel became a promoter in 1963, when he took over management of the Kansas City office. Partnering with Gus Karras and Pat O'Connor, he renamed the promotion Heart of America Sports Attractions. He then took his place on the board of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). In that same year, Geigel was cited as a co-defendant in an anti-monopoly case brought against the Central States territory by previous owner Pinkie George. Along with his partners Karras and O'Connor, and fellow co-defendant George Simpson, he refuted the charge, and it was eventually dropped. In 1978, Geigel became President of the NWA, his first term lasting until 1980. During this term he strongly supported Harley Race, a part-owner of Heart of America, as NWA World Heavyweight Champion. Geigel and Race bought out Sam Muchnick's portion of the St. Louis Wrestling Club, a cornerstone territory of the NWA.

Founded in 1921, it is affiliated to the DBU Jutland, the regional body of football in Jutland. The team plays its home matches at Holstebro Idr√¶tspark, where it has been based since 1989.  History  Holstebro Boldklub was formed on 21 March 1921. Before this cricket was the main sport in the town of Holstebro, while association football was introduced in the region around the turn of the century. The first football match in the town was on the market square between the antecedent to Holstebro Boldklub called Holstebro Idr√¶tsforening, and the main club from the neighbour town Lemvig. In the 1910s, the teams from Holstebro and Lemvig were among the best in Jutland and public interest grew quickly. In 1919, this resulted in a record 5,000 spectators in a match against Skive. However, it had become clear that modern facilities were needed in order to organise the sport further. On 21 March 1921, Johannes Nielsen called to a meeting at the town's temparance hotel, which was located on N√∏rregade, which would result in the formation of Holstebro Boldklub. Nielsen became the club's first chairman. Besides him, the board also consisted of grocer Bjerrehus, gardener Rasmussen, cigar makers Ottow and Laursen, baker Jensen and slaughterhouse worker Ejner Sk√∏d. Two years later, cigar maker Otto Ottow became chairman, bookkeeper Krunderup became treasurer and director Alfred \\"Asse\\" N√∏rgaard became secretary. Even though Holstebro Boldklub in its first few seasons won the JBU B-r√¶kke, the A-r√¶kke, Mellemr√¶kken and, in 1926, reached promotion to Mesterr√¶kken, today known as the Jutland Series, which is the highest regional level and the fifth level of the Danish football league system, it was not all fun and games. Even back in this era the club's best players moved to the stronger regional teams, which in the 1920s was mainly Herning Fremad, who had already established themselves as a Mesterr√¶kken team. Due to Holstebro losing its best players, they suffered relegation after only one season at that level. In 1999, Holstebro Boldklub became official Danish champions in indoor football.

Corps Castle is the logo of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE). The logo is typically a white castle with three towers set on a red background. When the Corps Castle is worn as insignia on a uniform, it is similar to the logo design but with a dull or shiny brass finish. The look of the Corps Castle traces its history back to the American Revolution and has evolved over time. The logo has received changes throughout the years but gets its finalizing shape from the United States Military Academy Barracks named Pershing Barracks. Background The medieval castle as a logo was started in 1840 on an informal basis. Beginning in 1841, cadets at the United States Military Academy at West Point, New York wore personal insignia of this type known as Gold Castles on their uniforms as they became commissioned officers in the U.S. Army. In 1902, the Corps Castle was formally adopted by the Army as the insignia of the Corps of Engineers. On formal and semi-formal uniforms, the logo is customarily gold in color, although it was changed to silver from gold from 1894‚Äì1921. When displayed on combat uniforms for special events, it is customarily black in color. In visual color media, the Corps Castle logo is customarily presented in red and white colors.USACE: Corps Castle Traces a Long History History and origins The turreted castle was adapted as the symbol of the Engineers, due it representing the two primary responsibilities of an Engineer, offense, and defense. French connection U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (USACE) logo As a consequence, many speculative stories about the origins of the engineers have been advanced. One story traces the origins to a French connection. During the American Revolution, the Continental Army filled its necessity for trained military engineers by either borrowing them from France or having French engineers volunteer for service in the Continental Army. Stories about castle origins credit these French engineers, in particular, General Louis Lebegue Duportail, Chief Engineer, Continental Army, 22 July 1777 ‚Äì 10 Oct. 1783, with a design based on a castle-style fortification in Verdun, France. These French engineers disappeared from the scene before the castle design appeared in the American Army. Williams explanation While there may be some truth to the French connection, the origins are also attributed to Colonel Jonathan Williams and a member of his staff, Alexander Macomb. Williams‚Äîgrandnephew of Benjamin Franklin‚Äîassisted Franklin during his tenure as envoy to France during the American Revolution. After the war, he adopted engineering as a profession. In 1801, Williams was a major, Corps Artillerists engineer, and Inspector of Fortifications. In 1802, President Thomas Jefferson appointed him commander of the newly created Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Thus, he was the first Chief Engineer and First Superintendent of West Point of the reestablished Corps. Castle Williams Through his work as Chief Engineer, there is a clue as to who designed the Corps insignia. Between 1807 and 1812, he designed and constructed Castle Williams to defend New York Harbor. The gateway to that castle-style fortification bore an eagle over the center. Other examples included Castle Pinckney in Charleston, South Carolina and Castle Clinton, which also defended New York Harbor. An assistant on his staff was Colonel Alexander Macomb, who became the Chief Engineer, 1 June 1821 through 24 May 1828. In 1828, he was elevated to Commanding General of the U.S. Army. In 1807, he made the earliest known drawing of the Engineer Button adorned with a castle motif, worn on the uniforms of the West Point cadets during the War of 1812. Another engineer officer‚ÄîColonel Richard Delafield, superintendent of the military academy‚Äîadded the turreted castle to the new uniform for the West Point cadets in 1838. Macomb‚Äîas Commanding General of the U.S. Army‚Äîhad an active part in the design of the new uniform. The castle was also a major element in the architectural design of the buildings at West Point, as typified by the old library built in 1841 that survived until 1961, when it was torn down. Delafield supervised the design and construction of the buildings destroyed by the fire, including the old library. From the evidence, one would conclude that Williams and Macomb, both familiar with French military tradition and heraldry, designed not only the Corps castle emblem but also the Essayons button. Although Macomb's design appeared in 1807, the authoritative description of the button appeared in February 1840, in General Orders 7, AGO: 'Essayons,‚Äô a bastion with embrasures in the distance, surrounded by water, and the rising sun, the figures to be of dead gold upon a bright field\\". While the designs of the emblem and the button have changed, the castle remains a distinctive symbol of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. Captain Alden Partridge, Acting Superintendent of the United States Military Academy from 1808‚Äì1817, was described by General George D. Ramsey: \\"Captain Partridge was never known to be without his uniform... His was that of the Corps of Engineers with embroidered cuffs and the Essayons button...\\"Buzzaird, Raleigh B. 1950. \\"Insignia of the Corps of Engineers.\\" The Military Engineer.

Biography  Richard Lindner's headstone Richard Lindner was born in Hamburg, Germany. His mother Mina Lindner was American and born in New York as daughter of German parents. In 1905 the family moved to Nuremberg, where Lindner's mother was owner of a custom-fitting corset business and Richard Lindner grew up and studied at the Kunstgewerbeschule (Arts and Crafts School), now the Academy of Fine Arts Nuremberg. From 1924 to 1927 he lived in Munich and studied there from 1925 at the Kunstakademie. In 1927 Lindner moved to Berlin and stayed there until 1928, when he returned to Munich to become art director of a publishing firm. He remained in Munich until 1933, when he was forced to flee to Paris. Once in Paris, Lindner became politically engaged, sought contact with French artists and earned his living as a commercial artist. He was interned when World War II broke out in 1939 and later served in the French Army. In 1941, Lindner moved to the United States and worked in New York City as an illustrator of books and magazines. There he made contact with New York artists and German emigrants such as Albert Einstein, Marlene Dietrich, and Saul Steinberg. In 1948, Lindner became an American citizen. In 1952, Lindner started teaching at the Pratt Institute, Brooklyn. In 1957 Lindner received the William and Norma Copley Foundation- Award. In 1965, he became Guest Professor at the Hochschule f√ºr bildende K√ºnste in Hamburg, Germany. His paintings at this time used the sexual symbolism of advertising and investigated definitions of gender roles in the media. In 1967, Lindner moved to Yale University School of Art and Architecture, New Haven. Richard Lindner died in 1978. He was buried at Westchester Hills Cemetery in Hastings-on-Hudson, New York.

We'll see you next week, and until then, so long for now.\\" He is known for constantly addressing the viewers as \\"fans\\" many times on each episode. Broadcast career=NWA Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling His television broadcasting career began in Wilmington, North Carolina. He then moved to another broadcasting position in Savannah, Georgia. While in Savannah in the late 1950s, Caudle hosted a televised studio wrestling show. Caudle was the weatherman at WRAL-TV 5 in Raleigh, North Carolina, where NWA Atlantic Coast Wrestling was taped every week. Caudle continued as both the weatherman for WRAL and the voice of NWA Atlantic Coast Wrestling for many years. Caudle continued to host the flagship program which was renamed NWA Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling in 1973 (after the death of Jim Crockett, Sr.). Caudle had many \\"sidekicks\\" over the years including David Crockett and Johnny Weaver. In 1986, his show changed its name to NWA Pro Wrestling. In 1988, Jim Ross joined the show. Caudle hosted the syndicated All-Star Wrestling, Wide World Wrestling, Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling, and World Wide Wrestling for Jim Crockett Promotions (JCP) and WCW World Wide Wrestling after JCP was purchased by Ted Turner in late 1988. Caudle was also the lead announcer for the closed circuit events known as Starrcade in the 1980s and most of the early NWA/WCW pay per views. He worked several live Clash of the Champions telecasts, as well. Slowly, the promotion grew away from the NWA and became World Championship Wrestling (WCW). Smoky Mountain Wrestling By late 1991, Caudle left WCW and joined South Atlantic Pro Wrestling (SAPW) as lead announcer. Within a few months, the promotion closed and Caudle went to work for Jim Cornette's Smoky Mountain Wrestling (SMW). Caudle remained with SMW for all of its run. At one point, Jim Ross left the World Wrestling Federation (WWF) briefly and joined Caudle on the SMW telecasts. In late 1995, the promotion was shut down by Cornette. NWA reunion shows Caudle continued to make personal appearances at NWA indy events and reunion shows. He suffered two heart attacks on June 14, 2007 but completely recovered and returned to appearing regularly at NWA/Mid-Atlantic Championship Wrestling reunions and other NWA Wrestling events. He introduced Ric Flair at the annual NWA Fanfest in 2009 in Charlotte, North Carolina. Style Caudle was a traditional type of wrestling announcer, meaning that he did not advocate for faces or heels (although he often showed his disgust for cheating). Caudle was not a personality in and of himself, but he let the wrestlers be the stars of the show. As such, he wasn't involved in angles where heels would attack him. Over the years Caudle was teamed with Bill Ward, David Crockett, Johnny Weaver, Gordon Solie, Les Thatcher, Tony Schiavone, Dutch Mantel, Jim Cornette, and Jim Ross among others. Personal life Caudle was born in Charlotte, North Carolina. Caudle, an avowed Republican, contributed to the campaigns of Senator Jesse Helms. He became a legislative assistant for Senator Jesse Helms after he left WRAL in 1980, working in Helms' office in Raleigh. He remained in that position until 1996. Caudle and Helms worked together at WRAL before Helms ran for the United States Senate in 1972. He and his wife Jackie have been married for over 60 years, have 3 children and 7 grandchildren.

As Kaas had been playing in green shirts and Pandrup in white, the new first team shirt of course had to be a mix of those two colours. As their first coach they hired Preben Larsen who, for a long time, had been an influential first team player in AaB. The club was capable of having teams in none less than all of the six lowest Danish divisions in their first season, and the first home game on the new ground ‚Äì which was opened on 7 April 1974. It was against Frederikshavn in Serie 1 (the sixth-lowest division). The game was eventually won by Jetsmark IF after a goal scored just a few minutes before the final whistle by Arne Johansen. After a depressingly long period with teams in Serie 2 and 3, and none of them looking to advance in the near future, their hopes of playing in a higher vision saw light, as a group of former players estimated the organization \\"Team Jetsmark\\", whose only purpose was to find players, staff, and funds to make the club get back to Serie 1. With Torben Nielsen as the head coach, that goal was achieved in 1992. However, the greatest highlight of the club's history so far is considered to be the promotion to the 2nd Division (the 3rd best of Danish divisions) in 2002.

On July 7, 1962 18:40 UTC (July 8, 1962, 00:10 local) it crashed into a hill about north-east of Bombay while on approach.  Aircraft  The aircraft involved in the accident was a Douglas DC-8-43 constructed in 1962 and registered as I-DIWD to Alitalia. At the time of the accident the aircraft had sustained 964 flight hours. The registration and airworthiness certificates were both valid. The Captain of the flight had signed the Certificate of Maintenance on 6 July 1962. The aircraft was equipped with a VHF navigation receiver, glide slope receiver, marker beacon receiver, ADF receiver, Loran receiver, doppler radar, and a transponder; but the aircraft did not have any flight recorders. No mechanical issues were reported, and the center of gravity and weight of the DC-8 were within permitted parameters.  Crew  Nine crew members were aboard the flight. The cockpit crew consisted of: * Captain Luigi Quattrin, who was 50 years old and had been a pilot since 1939. He had accumulated 13,700 flight hours, of which 1,396 were on the Douglas DC-8. He had previously flown the Rome-Bombay route on DC-6 and DC-7 aircraft but did not go all the way to Bangkok. On the familiarization flight for the Bangkok-Bombay route, which was required by Alitalia in order for him to be permitted to fly the route as pilot-in-command, he flew the route to Bangkok via the Tehran-Karachi-Bombay route. * The Co-pilot Ugo Arcangeli\\"Seduta di Luned√¨ 9 Lugio 1962 Presidenza del Vicepresidente Bucciarelli Ducci\\" III Legislatura ‚Äî Discucioni ‚Äî Seduta del 9 Luglio 1962 http://legislature.camera.it/_dati/leg03/lavori/stenografici/sed0640/sed0640.pdf was 33 years old and had been a pilot since 1956. He had accumulated a total of 3,480 flight hours, of which 1,672 had been from flying as co-pilot on the DC-8. * The Flight engineer Luciano Fontana was 31 years old and had 4,070 flight hours, of which 386 were from flying on the DC-8. The remaining six members of the crew were flight attendants. Both the captain and co-pilot were trained navigators, but there was no individual navigator in the flight crew.  Synopsis  After starting initially with 45 passengers in Sydney and taking on more passengers on the stops to Darwin and Singapore, Flight 771 departed from Bangkok at 15:16 UTC with 94 people aboard as stated by the load sheet, although the official flight plan stated there was to be 98 people aboard. The flight plan was not signed by the pilot-in-command, a violation of the Alitalia Operations Manual. Flight 771 first made communications with Bombay Flight Information Center at 17:20, during which the flight requested a weather forecast for landing, as well as stating their estimated time of arrival to be 18:45 and their altitude to be 36,000 feet. Between the times of 17:30 and 17:47 they were informed of the local weather forecast; Various weather reports for Bombay at the time of the accident indicated that there was light rain but no thunderstorms or other dangerous conditions. At 18:20 the flight switched to the Bombay approach frequency and requested to initiate descent when over the point of Aurangabad to an altitude of 20,000 feet. The descent was approved and the weather information provided was acknowledged. The flight initiated descent at 18:24:36 UTC, descending from 35,000 ft to 20,000 ft approximately twenty minutes before it was due to land at Bombay with an ETA at 18:45. At 18:25 the flight was cleared to take a transition level of 4,000 ft. Weather information was transmitted again at 18:28:04, with the QNH at 29.58 inches. At 18:29 the air traffic controller was informed of the flight's preference to land of runway 27. At 18:38:34 the flight was asked if it would be making a 360¬∞ over the beacon or landing in directly. At 18:38:49 the flight only replied \\"OK\\" leading to some confusion as to which approach would be taken. The flight clarified shortly thereafter that it would make a 360¬∞ over the outer beacon. At 18:38:54 the DC-8 reached an altitude of 5,000 feet; the flight plan provided by Alitalia prescribed a 100-mile descent to Bombay in 13 minutes. The flight continued descending further to 3,600 feet, well below the minimum safety altitude at 9,000 feet as well as below the 4,000 ft minimum initial approach altitude. The last communication heard from the aircraft was at 18:39:58 again confirming the 360¬∞ over the beacon. The DC-8 crashed into Davandyachi hill on a bearing of 240¬∞. The wreckage of the aircraft was found scattered among trees on the hill with the remains of the cockpit altimeter at an altitude of 3,600 feet, only 5 feet short of the top. The DC-8 was completely destroyed and all persons aboard perished in the crash.  Causes  Investigators explored several potential causes, including: navigational errors which led the pilot to believe that he was nearer to his destination than he actually was; failure to maintain the recommended safe altitude; and pilot unfamiliarity with the flight route. Pilot intoxication was initially suggested but ruled out as a contributing cause. Chart number 21 from the radio facility did not show the terrain the flight crashed into and only indicated the presence of a location 13 miles to the north at a height of 5,400 feet. Investigators concluded that errors in navigation led the pilot to think he was closer to the necessary point of descent than in reality resulting in a premature descent for a straight-in instrument approach at night, resulting in controlled flight into terrain. Secondary causes of the accident were cited as follows by the ICAO: > \\"1. Failure on the part of the pilot to make use of the navigational > facilities available in order to ascertain the correct position, of the > aircraft. > 2\\\\. Infringement of the prescribed minimum safe altitude. > 3\\\\. Unfamiliarity of the pilot with the terrain on the route.\\"  See also  * Air Inter Flight 148 * Crossair Flight 3597 * Indian Airlines Flight 605  References =CitationsBibliography * Category:Airliner accidents and incidents involving controlled flight into terrain Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in India Category:History of Mumbai (1947‚Äìpresent) Category:Accidents and incidents involving the Douglas DC-8 Category:Aviation accidents and incidents in 1962 Category:1962 in India 771 Category:July 1962 events ","title":"Alitalia Flight 771"},{"id":"4442265","text":"Quiateot is the name of a rain deity in the mythological traditions of the pre-Columbian and contact-era Nicarao people, an indigenous grouping on the periphery of the Mesoamerican cultural area, located in present-day Nicaragua.

Braschi, an Independent Catholic bishop whose own ordination is in the line of apostolic succession and thus considered valid by the Roman Catholic Church, was excommunicated.General Decree regarding the delict of attempted sacred ordination of a woman Regelsberger had been ordained by Braschi a few months prior to the ordinations on the Danube. The problematic ordination of Braschi thus makes Regelsberger's problematic as well, according to ideas on apostolic succession lineage, providing an opportunity for criticism by those who oppose women's ordination in the Roman Catholic Church. The women's ordinations were not, however, recognized as valid by the Roman Catholic Church,Can. 1024 : A baptized male alone receives sacred ordination validly although the women (and their successors) consider their own ordinations to be valid and even studied in a three year program, designed by Christine Mayr- Lumetzberger, prior to their ordinations.Peterfeso, Jill Marie. ‚ÄúTransgressive Traditions: Roman Catholic Womenpriests and the Problem of Women's Ordination.‚Äù University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, 2012.  Legal consequences and responses  On 10 July 2002, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a monitum against the women, warning that they would be excommunicated if they did not admit the invalidity of the ordinations and repented. As a consequence of this violation of canon law, specifically canons 1008-1009 and 1024-1025, and their refusal to repent, the Vatican excommunicated the women.Connoly, Kate and Willan Phillip. \\"Vatican casts out 'ordained' women\\", \\"The Guardian\\", August 6, 2002. The women asked the Vatican to revoke the excommunication, but this request was denied in Decree on the Attempted Ordination of Some Catholic Women.Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, Decree on the attempted ordination of some Catholic women In the course of these meetings the members arrived at the collegial decision to confirm the decree of excommunication. In the case under consideration, in fact, hierarchical recourse is not possible as it concerns a decree of excommunication issued by a Dicastery of the Holy See acting in the name of the Supreme Pontiff (cf. Canon 360). Since then several similar ceremonies have been held by Roman Catholic Womenpriests, a group in favor of women's ordination in Roman Catholicism. These womenpriests were not excommunicated as quickly as the original Danube seven, however, since 2008, all people involved in the ordination of women are automatically excommunicated by the Roman Catholic Church, through the mechanism of latae sententiae. Despite this threat, some of the women ordained as priests became ordained as bishops, in order to continue to the womenpriest movement without putting more male bishops in jeopardy. Currently there is a lobby within the Roman Catholic Church in favour of the ordination of women to the priesthood. However, the church officially teaches that the ordination of women is impossible: Pope John Paul II asserted the theological impossibility of ordaining women, arguing that the action is unfounded in holy scripture and absent from the church's bimillenial tradition. Pope John Paul II maintained that it is ontologically impossible for the church to ordain women because the priesthood is a participation in the relational aspect of the Trinity which, according to the Catholic Church's own teaching, is dependent on a masculine nature, the idea of gender complementarity, and the phrase In persona Christi. Supporters of women's ordination argue that there are both direct and indirect scriptural references to women's ministry, and an ancient tradition of ordaining women, some say intentionally clouded over by the male hierarchy. Pope Francis supports John Paul II's statements, claiming he had the last word on the issue. http://www.charlotteobserver.com/living/religion/article147737594.html Other notable Roman Catholic documents that deal with the ordination of women include * Rerum Novarum, Pope Leo XIII 1891 * Vatican II 1962-1965 * Inter Insigniores, 1976 Declaration by Pope Paul VI * Canon 1008-1009 * Canon 1024-1025 * Ordinatio Sacerdotalis, 1994 Letter by Pope John Paul II * Responsum Ad Propositum Dubium, 1995 Pope John Paul II The sacramental validity of the Danube Seven ordinations is not recognized by the Roman Catholic Church, setting up a fundamental dispute and controversy between the Danube Seven and the Church. Although the women believe that they are validly ordained, the Catholic Church teaches that because a valid subject for ordination (in this case a male person) was not present, no ordination took place. The Church says that this teaching is based on Divine Law. Despite the position of these seven women and some Catholic scholars, the Catholic Church continues to consider the ordination of women to be impossible.  Relationship to other Christian Denominations  At the 1978 Lambeth Conference the Anglican Communion decided that all of its churches were autonomous and thus had the right to make their own choices on the legality of the ordination of women. The admission of women to the priesthood in many parts of the Anglican Communion, including the Church of England in 1992, and the actions of the Philadelphia Eleven and the response of the Episcopal Church in the 1970s, fueled some Catholics' calls for a greater role for women in ministry. At the same time the Anglican Communion's moves created an apparently insurmountable obstacle to Anglican-Catholic unity. Bishop R√≥mulo Antonio Braschi left the Catholic Church to lead an international missionary congregation, the Catholic Apostolic Charismatic Church of Jesus the King.

(2003) Stockheath Naval Camp was two miles north where Great Copse Drive is now. In 1974 Hampshire County Council decided to split the primary intake, and a new school for the older children was built on land immediately south of Hooks Lane Recreation Ground, and named Bidbury Middle School. A long campaign began to move the newly created Bedhampton First School to the new site too. This eventually happened in February 1985 when Bedhampton and Stockheath First schools amalgamated to become Bidbury First School, renamed Bidbury Infant School in 1994. Just across the recreation ground is a Roman Catholic Primary School, St Thomas More's.

Facts Samuel Keeble (the plaintiff) owned property called Minott's Meadow, which contained a pond outfitted with nets and channels in a manner used to catch large numbers of commercially viable ducks. This type of pond served as a sort of \\"duck trap\\" and was known as a decoy. Tame ducks were used to lure their wild counterparts into the decoy. On three occasions, defendant Edmund Hickeringill, while on his own land, discharged firearms toward Keeble's pond in order to scare away the ducks. Judgment Chief Justice Holt sustained the action of trespass on the case, because every person has the right to put his property to use for his own pleasure and profit. If Hickeringill had built a decoy on his own land near Keeble's meadow to draw away ducks (which, in fact, he had done previous to the construction of Keeble's own decoy and may have lent some cause as to Hickeringill's harassing actions), no action could be taken, because Hickeringill would have just as much right to set up a decoy on his own property as Keeble does on his. But, Hickeringill actively disturbed the ducks on Keeble's land, thereby causing damages in that, > \\"he that hinders another in his trade or livelihood is liable.\\" Furthermore, Keeble had gone through the expense of setting up the decoy and nets, and to allow Hickeringill to disturb the profitable use of the land was bad for commerce. When a person hinders another's use of his own property for profit, it is actionable, even if there is no physical trespassing. Thus, Justice Holt concluded that > \\"in short, that which is the true reason for this action is not brought to > recover damage for the loss of the fowl, but for the disturbance.\\" Keeble won a verdict of ¬£20.

Amsterdam Impressionism was an art movement in late 19th-century Holland. It is associated especially with George Hendrik Breitner and is also known as the School of Alleb√©. The innovative ideas about painting of the French Impressionists were introduced into the Netherlands by the artists of the Hague School. This new style of painting was also adopted in Amsterdam by the young generation of artists of the late 19th century. Like their French colleagues, these Amsterdam painters put their impressions onto canvas with rapid, visible strokes of the brush. They focused on depicting the everyday life of the city.  Origins  Breitner studied for four-and-a-half years at the Royal Academy, The Hague and came into contact with artists of the Hague School such as Jozef Isra√´ls, Jacob Maris and Anton Mauve, joining the Pulchri Studio. Nevertheless his painting style was always too free to be realist in nature, a hallmark of the Hague School. In 1884 he moved briefly to Paris, coming into contact with impressionism, and on his return he settled in Amsterdam where he became noted for his free and energetic depictions of urban life. Other Amsterdam Impressionists were Floris Verster, Isaac Isra√´ls, Willem Bastiaan Tholen, Kees Heynsius, Willem de Zwart, Willem Witsen and Jan Toorop, the last an associate of the Belgian painter James Ensor and a member of the Brussels Les XX. Also included in the movement are a group of late-impressionist woman artists called the Amsterdamse Joffers, whose members included Lizzy Ansingh and Suze Bisschop-Robertson.  Artists  This artists belong to the 2. generation of the Netherlands Impressionism. The Influence of their work was important on the subsequent movement of modern art in the 20th century. * Pieter Florentius Nicolaas Jacobus Arntzenius (1864-1925) * Johan Braakensiek (1858-1940) * Nicolaas Bastert (1854-1939) * Cornelius de Bruin (1870-1940) * George Hendrik Breitner (1857-1923) * Dirk van Haaren (1878-1953) * Kees Heynsius (1890-1981) * Richard Roland Holst (1868-1938) * Isaac Isra√´ls (1865-1934) * Hendrik Maarten Krabb√© (1868-1931) * Jacobus van Looy (1855-1930) * Johan Thorn Prikker (1868-1932) * Hobbe Smith (1862-1942) * Willem Bastiaan Tholen (1860-1931) * Johannes Theodorus Toorop (1858-1928) * Floris Verster (1864-1925) * Jan Hillebrand Wijsmuller (1855-1925) * Willem Witsen (1860-1923) * Willem de Zwart (1862-1931)  Gallery  File:Markt met bloemenstalletjes Rijksmuseum SK-A-3724.jpegFloris Arntzenius (undated): Marktet with flower stalls, Rijksmuseum Amsterdam.

The Green Knights began combat operations flying the F4F Wildcat and later the F4U Corsair as charter members of the Cactus Air Force and throughout the Battle of Guadalcanal arriving in October 1942. The squadron also fought from the forward air bases of Espirito Santo, Turtle Bay, Bougainville, and Emirau. On September 15, 1944, the Green Knights landed on Peleliu and fought there until July 25, 1945. They returned to the United States to be deactivated on September 9, 1945.Former 'Green Knights' reunite after 60 years During the Pacific War, VMF-121 produced fourteen fighter aces, more than any other squadron, including Medal of Honor recipient, Major Joseph J. Foss. VMF-121 downed 208 Japanese aircraftSherrod History, p. 430. (165 flying Wildcats and another 44 flying Corsairs) in aerial combat. After World War II, the squadron was reactivated in the United States at Naval Air Station Glenview, Illinois where the squadron's designation was changed to Marine Attack Squadron 121 (VMA-121). During this time they flew a variety of aircraft including the F4U Corsair, F8F Bearcat and A-1 Skyraider. Korean War In mid 1951, VMA-121 received orders to activate its reserve members and departed NAS Glenview for Marine Corps Air Station El Toro, California. After completion of training in the Skyraider, the squadron was transported aboard the carrier to Yokosuka, Japan to begin final preparations for a combat deployment to the Republic of Korea. In June 1953 they also set a then Marine record for a single day's ordnance delivery when 16 AD-2 Skyraiders dropped 156 tons of bombs during the attack on the Sui-ho Dam.Mersky USMC Aviation, p. 144-5. VMA-121 deployed to K-6 Airfield at Pyongtaek, Republic of Korea on October 19, 1951 and conducted their first strike on October 27. Their mission was to conduct strike missions in support of infantry operations. The squadron dropped more bomb tonnage during the Korean War than any other Navy or Marine Corps squadron, devastating enemy airfields, supply dumps, bridges, and railroad yards. During the Korean War the Squadron insignia depicted Al Capp's \\"WolfGirl\\" from the comic strip Li'l Abner. The \\"Wolf Raiders\\" of VMA-121 remained in South Korea for several years after the Korean Armistice Agreement was signed in 1953. Returning to MCAS El Toro in 1957, the squadron assumed its role in the Unit Deployment Program with scheduled rotations to Japan and traded in its AD Skyraider aircraft and joined the jet age with the F9F-8B. The Cougar equipped with the LABS system for loft bombing, was the first aircraft flown by the squadron capable of delivering nuclear weapons. In late 1958, the Squadron traded the Cougars for brand new A-4 Skyhawks. Spending most of the next year at the likes of NAAS Fallon, MCAS Yuma, and NOTS China Lake, the \\"Green Knights\\" became the first squadron to complete the entire special weapons delivery syllabus. During November 1962, the \\"Green Knights\\" deployed in their new A-4s to NAS Cecil Field in Jacksonville, Florida in response to the Cuban Missile Crisis. Vietnam War In August 1966, under the command of LtCol Donald Stiver, the Green Knights ferried their A-4E Skyhawks to MCAS Iwakuni, Japan and after preparatory training in Japan and Okinawa, began combat operations from Chu Lai Air Base, South Vietnam in December, 1966. In May 1967 VMA-121 shattered the old ordnance record for Marine Attack Squadrons by delivering over 1750 tons of ordnance in combat operations. After six months of combat operations, the squadron rotated back to MCAS Iwakuni, Japan and Naha Air Base, Okinawa before returning to Chu Lai for another combat tour in September 1967. During the first six months of that deployment, VMA-121 supported 118 major operations. In early 1969, the squadron was reconstituted at MCAS Cherry Point, North Carolina and newly designated as VMA(AW)-121 to reflect the squadron's transition to the all-weather attack mission with the Grumman A-6 Intruder. The Green Knights were now capable of acquiring and destroying surface targets in any weather, day or night, with a wide variety of air-to-ground ordnance. The squadron participated in a 13-month deployment to MCAS Iwakuni as a member of 1st MAW. While stationed in Japan, the squadron participated in training exercises at Cubi Point Philippines and Team Sprit in Yechon, Korea. The Green Knights returned to El Toro in June 1978, and the commanding officer was Lt. Col. \\"WALDO\\" Adams. In 1982 the squadron was awarded the Meritorious Unit Commendation (MUC) for achieving 43,000 accident free flight hours. This Commendation spanned from years previously flown in Vietnam without an accident. The award was issued while the squadron was deployed to Iwakuni, Japan and the commanding officer Lt. Col. \\"JACK\\" Rippy. On November 11, 1985, operational control of VMA(AW)-121 was transferred to Commander, Carrier Airwing Two attached to the . In July 1987, under the command of LtCol. Joe \\"Java\\" Weston, the squadron deployed aboard the Ranger on a six-month WestPAC/Indian Ocean cruise. Arriving on Gonzo Station in the North Arabian Sea, the squadron participated in Operation Earnest Will, the escorting of reflagged Kuwaiti tankers. In February 1989, the squadron once again set sail aboard the Ranger for another WestPAC/Indian Ocean cruise under the command of Pete \\"NODAC\\" Jacobs. Upon return to MCAS El Toro in August 1989, operational control of VMA(AW)-121 was transferred back to Commander, 3rd Marine Aircraft Wing (3rd MAW). The Gulf War & the 1990s On December 8, 1989 the squadron was redesignated as Marine Fighter Attack Squadron (All Weather) ONE TWO ONE (VMFA(AW)-121), becoming the first Marine Corps F/A-18D Hornet night attack squadron. Slightly over one year later, the squadron deployed in support of Operation Desert Storm. During the Desert Storm Air Campaign, the squadron flew 557 sorties and 1,655.5 combat hours (more than any other Navy or Marine Corps tactical jet squadron). Returning to MCAS El Toro following the cessation of hostilities, the Green Knights resumed the unit deployment rotation and relocated to Marine Corps Air Station Miramar, California during August 1994 when custody of that installation was transferred from the Navy (as NAS Miramar) to the Marine Corps pursuant to BRAC action that also closed MCAS El Toro. The Green Knights made three deployments to the Western Pacific before returning to combat over Iraq in March 2000. During this 2000 deployment, the squadron flew 287 sorties in support of Operation Southern Watch (OSW) while based at Ahmad al-Jaber Air Base, Kuwait, providing much-needed operational tempo (OPTEMPO) relief to active duty USAF, Air Force Reserve and Air National Guard A-10 Thunderbolt II fighter squadrons that had been manning the OSW mission at Al Jaber since the end of the first Gulf War. Global War on Terror and beyond In April 2002, the squadron deployed with six aircraft to Kyrgyzstan, followed by the remaining six aircraft and personnel a month later. The squadron flew more than 900 combat sorties over Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom, returning to MCAS Miramar in October 2002. Only 3 months after returning from Kyrgyzstan, the Green Knights deployed to Al Jaber Air Base, Kuwait. From February to May 2003, the squadron flew more than 750 combat sorties over Iraq in support of Operation Southern Watch and Operation Iraqi Freedom, and returned to MCAS Miramar on May 12. In March 2005, the squadron deployed as part of the Unit Deployment Program to MCAS Iwakuni, Japan. The squadron returned to MCAS Miramar on September 15, 2005. In February 2007, the squadron deployed to Al Asad Air Base, Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom 06-08. The squadron deployed as part of the Unit Deployment Program to Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan from September 2008 to March 2009, March 2010 to September 2010, and January 2012 to July 2012. On August 17, 2011, an F/A-18D from VMFA(AW)-121 crashed into the Pacific Ocean approximately 85 miles southwest of San Diego. Both pilot and WSO ejected safely. F-35B Lightning II Joint Strike Fighter era On 28 September 2012, LtCol. Jeff Scott took command of the Green Knights from LtCol. Michael Waterman, marking the end of the F/A-18D Hornet's tenure in VMFA(AW)-121 and ushering in the fifth-generation stealth fighter era. This change of command officially moved the squadron from MAG-11 at MCAS Miramar to MAG-13 at MCAS Yuma. On 20 November, VMFA(AW)-121 was officially redesignated VMFA-121, accepting delivery of the first three F-35B aircraft becoming the first operational F-35B squadron in the Marine Corps Operating Forces and the first operational F-35 squadron in any service.\\"Lockheed Martin Delivers Three F-35Bs To The U.S. Marine Corps\\" On 9 January 2017, VMFA-121 permanently departed Marine Corps Air Station Yuma, Arizona transferring to Marine Corps Air Station Iwakuni, Japan. On 18 January 2017, VMFA-121 arrived at MCAS Iwakuni, Japan as the first forward deployed permanent F-35B squadron. On April 24, 2018 an F-35B belonging to the squadron made an emergency landing at Fukuoka airport.  Squadron aces  { - valign=top  * Robert M. Baker ‚Äì 7.0 * Leonard K. Davis ‚Äì 5.0 * Cecil J.

Life and career Meret Becker was born in Bremen, the daughter of the actors Monika Hansen and Rolf Becker but she was raised in Berlin by her mother with her stepfather Otto Sander along with her brother Ben Becker. She is the granddaughter of the comedian Claire Schlichting and the niece of the acrobat and comedian Jonny Buchardt. In 1996, she married Alexander Hacke (a member of the band Einst√ºrzende Neubauten), who contributed songs to Becker's albums, including Noctambule. They separated in 2000 and divorced two years later. Becker was a guest musician on Einst√ºrzende Neubauten's album Ende Neu, singing \\"Stella Maris\\" - in a duet with Blixa Bargeld. She played the character Erna Eggstein in the 1997 German film Comedian Harmonists, as well as Katya, a prostitute, in Painted Angels. A year later, in 1998, she gave several performances along with Nina Hagen. The short but sold-out tour was titled \\"Wir hei√üen beide Anna\\" in which both Becker and Hagen sang several songs by Bertold Brecht, set to music by Paul Dessau and Kurt Weill. Meret has since recorded two studio albums, Nachtmahr, which featured Robert Rutman playing his giant sheetmetal instruments on several tracks, and Fragiles. Just like the first album, both of them contain songs, poetry and short stories, played with unusual instruments and avant-garde arrangements. In 1993, she appeared as the female singer in the U2 video for Stay (Faraway, So Close!). In 2005, she was a supporting actress in the film Munich, directed by Steven Spielberg.

Boyana is one of the most expensive parts of Sofia to live in. The residents are primarily wealthy business people, government officials and other prominent members of Bulgarian society.

There are five koshas, and they are often visualised as the layers of an onion in the subtle body. Origins The five sheaths summarised with the term Panchakosha are described in the Taittiriya Upanishad (2.1-5).David Frawley, Yoga and the Sacred Fire: Self-Realization and Planetary Transformation, p.288 From gross to fine they are: # Annamaya kosha, \\"food\\" sheath (Anna) # Pranamaya kosha, \\"energy\\" sheath (Prana) # Manomaya kosha \\"mind\\" sheath (Manas) # Vij√±ƒÅnamaya kosha, \\"discernment\\" sheath (Vijnana) # Anandamaya kosha, \\"bliss\\" sheath (Ananda) According to Vedanta the wise person, being aware of the subtle influences of the five elements within each kosha, ever discerns the Self amidst appearances. The five sheaths A visualisation of the five koshas, but they are not to be thought of as concentric sheaths but as interpenetrating at different levels of subtlety, from the grossest to the subtlest.  Annamaya kosha  This is the sheath of the physical self, the grossest of the five koshas, named from the fact that it is nourished by food. Living through this layer humans identify themselves with a mass of skin, flesh, fat, bones, and feces, while the human of discrimination knows oneself, the only reality that there is, as distinct from the body. The physical body is formed of the essence of food. Birth and death are the attributes of the Annamaya kosha.  Pranamaya kosha  Pranamaya means composed of prana, the vital principle, the force that vitalizes and holds together the body and the mind. It pervades the whole organism, its one physical manifestation is the breath. As long as this vital principle exists in the organisms, life continues. Coupled with the five organs of action it forms the vital sheath. In the Vivekachudamani it is a modification of vayu or air, it enters into and comes out of the body.  Manomaya kosha  Manomaya means composed of manas or mind. The mind, along with the five sensory organs, is said to constitute the manomaya kosa. The manomaya kosa, or \\"mind-sheath\\" is said more truly to approximate to personhood than annamaya kosa and pranamaya kosha. It is the cause of diversity, of I and mine. Adi Shankara likens it to clouds that are brought in by the wind and again driven away by the same agency. Similarly, man's bondage is caused by the mind, and liberation, too, is caused by that alone.  Vij√±ƒÅnamaya kosha  Vij√±ƒÅnamaya means composed of vij√±ƒÅna, or intellect, the faculty which discriminates, determines or wills. Chattampi Swamikal defines vij√±ƒÅnamaya as the combination of intellect and the five sense organs. It is the sheath composed of more intellection, associated with the organs of perception. Sankara holds that the buddhi, with its modifications and the organs of knowledge, form the cause of man's transmigration. This knowledge sheath, which seems to be followed by a reflection of the power of the cit, is a modification of prakrti. It is endowed with the function of knowledge and identifies itself with the body, organs etc. This knowledge sheath cannot be the supreme self for the following reasons; * It is subject to change. * It is insentient. * It is a limited thing. * It is not constantly present.  Anandamaya kosha  Anandamaya means composed of ananda, or bliss; it is the subtlest of the five koshas. In the Upanishads the sheath is known also as the causal body. In deep sleep, when the mind and senses cease functioning, it still stands between the finite world and the self. Anandamaya, or that which is composed of supreme bliss, is regarded as the innermost of all. The bliss sheath normally has its fullest play during deep sleep: while in the dreaming and wakeful states, it has only a partial manifestation. The blissful sheath (anandamaya kosha) is a reflection of the Atman which is truth, beauty, bliss absolute. The following entry is for the utility of Hindu aspirants who are familiar with Panchakosha: Just as each of the five elements (earth, water, fire, air, and ether) appear in corresponding subtlety among each of the five senses so too the intellect cognizes ever subtler causes and effects at play through each of the five sheaths. For example, the annamayakosha, the coarsest sheath, is based in the earth element, which is guarded by Ganesha, while the very subtlest sheath Anandamaya is based in the quanta/ether element, and is guarded by a black disc of utter darkness over the sun, which can be removed only by Ganesha. Awareness of that reflection of atman/self within the most subtle sheath, Anandamayakosha, however, is but the foundation for discerning that which the elements, energies, senses, and kosha serve. To that end, one re-examines the components of the five koshas in daily devotional meditation after recitation of twenty-one OM, viz, one OM per each of the five elements, the five pranas, the five indriyas, and the five kosha, equaling twenty OM, then a twenty-first OM is offered for the ineffable, such that a spiritual discernment of ever- increasing subtlety arises in the purified intellect, alaya nirvijnana, the womb of the tathƒÅgata, wherein silence ensues and clarity blossoms.

A number of related activities including soliciting in a public place, kerb crawling, owning or managing a brothel, prostitution in a hotel, child prostitution, pimping and pandering are illegal. There are, however, many brothels illegally operating in Indian cities including Mumbai, Delhi, Kolkata and Chennai. UNAIDS estimate there were 657,829 prostitutes in the country in 2016. History A tawaif was a courtesan who catered to the nobility of India, particularly during the Mughal era. The tawaifs excelled in and contributed to music, dance (mujra), theatre, and the Urdu literary tradition, and were considered an authority on etiquette. Tawaifs were largely a North Indian institution central to Mughal court culture from the 16th century onwards and became even more prominent with the weakening of Mughal rule in the mid-18th century. They contributed significantly to the continuation of traditional dance and music forms and then emergence of modern Indian cinema. Goa was a colony in Portuguese India set up in the early 16th century, and this Portuguese stronghold contained a community of Portuguese slaves. During the late 16th and 17th centuries the Portuguese trade in Japanese slaves resulted in traders from the Portuguese Empire and their captive lascar crew members from South Asia bringing Japanese slaves to Goa. These were usually young Japanese women and girls brought or captured from Japan as sexual slaves. The culture of the performing art of nautch, an alluring style of popular dance, rose to prominence during the later period of Mughal Empire and the British East India Company Rule. During the period of Company rule in India by the British East India Company in the late 18th and early 19th centuries and during the subsequent British Raj, the British military established and maintained brothels for its troops across India. Women and girls were recruited from poor rural Indian families and paid directly by the military. The red-light districts of cities such as Mumbai developed at this time. The governments of many Indian princely states had regulated prostitution in India prior to the 1860s. The British Raj enacted the Cantonment Act of 1864 to regulate Prostitution in colonial India as a matter of accepting a necessary evil. The Cantonment Acts regulated and structured prostitution in the British military bases which provided for about twelve to fifteen Indian women kept in brothels called chaklas for each regiment of thousand British soldiers. They were licensed by military officials and were allowed to consort with soldiers only. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, thousands of women and girls from continental Europe and Japan were trafficked into British India, where they worked as prostitutes servicing British soldiers and local Indian men.

Prevalence  There were an estimated two million female sex workers in the country in 1997.

Earlier, there were centres such as Naqqasa Bazaar in Saharanpur, Chaturbhuj Sthan in Muzaffarpur, Lalpur, Maruadih in Varanasi, Meerganj in Allahabad, Kalinganj in Azamgarh and Kabadi bazar of Meerut.  Underage prostitution  Surveys show there are an estimated 1.2 million children involved in prostitution.  Research  Much new knowledge on sex work in India came from the first major survey, in April 2011. This was performed by the Centre for Advocacy on Stigma and Marginalisation (CASAM), which is part of SANGRAM, a major NGO that deals with sex workers. Legal status The law is vague on prostitution itself. The primary law dealing with the status of sex workers is the 1956 law referred to as The Immoral Traffic (Suppression) Act (SITA). According to this law, prostitutes can practise their trade privately but cannot legally solicit customers in public. A BBC article, however, mentions that prostitution is illegal in India; the Indian law does not refer to the practice of selling one's own sexual service as \\"prostitution\\". Clients can be punished for sexual activity in proximity to a public place. Organised prostitution (brothels, prostitution rings, pimping, etc.) is illegal. As long as it is done individually and voluntarily, a woman (male prostitution is not recognised in any law in India) can use her body in exchange for material benefit. In particular, the law forbids a sex worker to carry on her profession within 200 yards of a public place. Unlike as is the case with other professions, sex workers are not protected under normal labour laws, but they possess the right to rescue and rehabilitation if they desire, and they possess all the rights of other citizens. In practice SITA is not commonly used. The Indian Penal Code (IPC) which predates the SITA is often used to charge sex workers with vague crimes such as \\"public indecency\\" or being a \\"public nuisance\\" without explicitly defining what these consist of. In 1986 the old law was amended as the Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act or ITPA. Attempts to amend this to criminalise clients have been opposed by the Health Ministry, and has encountered considerable opposition. In a positive development in the improvement of the lives of female sex workers in Calcutta, a state-owned insurance company has provided life insurance to 250 individuals. Over the years, India has seen a growing mandate to legalise prostitution, to avoid exploitation of sex workers and their children by middlemen and in the wake of a growing HIV/AIDS menace.A mandate to legalise prostitution The Times of India, 25 August 2003.India's sex trade exposed The Independent, 29 November 2008.  Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act  The Immoral Traffic (Prevention) Act, or ITPA, also called the Prevention of Immoral Trafficking Act (PITA) is a 1986 amendment of legislation passed in 1956 as a result of the signing by India of the United Nations' declaration in 1950 in New York on the suppression of trafficking. The Immoral traffic Prevention Act The act, then called the All India Suppression of Immoral Traffic Act (SITA), was amended to the current law. The laws were intended as a means of limiting and eventually abolishing prostitution in India by gradually criminalising various aspects of sex work. The main points of the PITA are as follows: * Sex Workers: A prostitute who seduces or solicits shall be prosecuted. Similarly, call girls can not publish phone numbers to the public. (imprisonment up to 6 months with fine, point 8) Sex worker also punished for prostitution near any public place or notified area. (Imprisonment of up to 3 months with fine, point 7) * Clients: A client is guilty of consorting with prostitutes and can be charged if he engages in sex acts with a sex worker within 200 yards of a public place or \\"notified area\\". (Imprisonment of up to 3 months, point 7) The client may also be punished if the sex worker is below 18 years of age. (From 7 to 10 years of imprisonment, whether with a child or a minor, point 7) *Pimps and babus: Babus or pimps or live-in lovers who live off a prostitute's earnings are guilty of a crime. Any adult male living with a prostitute is assumed to be guilty unless he can prove otherwise. (Imprisonment of up to 2 years with fine, point 4) *Brothel: Landlords and brothel-keepers can be prosecuted, maintaining a brothel is illegal. (From 1 to 3 years' imprisonment with fine for first offence, point 3) Detaining someone at a brothel for the purpose of sexual exploitation can lead to prosecution. (Imprisonment of more than 7 years, point 6) Prostitution in a hotel is also a criminal offence. *Procuring and trafficking: A person procures or attempts to procure anybody is liable to be punished. Also a person who moves a person from one place to another, (human trafficking), can be prosecuted similarly. (7 years' imprisonment with fine for first conviction, and up to life imprisonment thereafter; point 5B) *Rescued Women: The government is legally obligated to provide rescue and rehabilitation in a \\"protective home\\" for any sex worker requesting assistance. (Point 21) Public place in context of this law includes places of public religious worship, educational institutions, hostels, hospitals etc. A \\"notified area\\" is a place which is declared to be \\"prostitution-free\\" by the state government under the PITA. Brothel in context of this law, is a place which has two or more sex workers (2a). Prostitution itself is not an offence under this law, but soliciting, brothels, madams and pimps are illegal.  Political and legal debates  In 2006 the Ministry of Women and Child Development put forward a bill aimed at reducing human trafficking. The bill proposed criminalising the clients of trafficked prostitutes. However, it stalled during the legislative process, and legislation against human trafficking was subsequently effected by amendments to the Indian Penal Code. Clauses in the ITPA relating to living off the earnings of a sex-worker are being challenged in court, together with criminalisation of brothels, prostitution around a notified public place, soliciting and the power given to a magistrate to evict sex-workers from their home and forbidding their re- entry. Other groups are lobbying parliament for amendments to the law. In 2009 the Supreme Court ruled that prostitution should be legalised and convened a panel to consider amending the law. In 2011 the Supreme Court held that \\"right to live with dignity\\" is a Constitutional right and issued an order relating to \\"creating conditions conducive for sex workers to work with dignity\\". The court directed the Central Government, States and Union Territories to carry out a survey to determine the number of sex workers in the country willing to be rehabilitated. However, in 2012 the Central Government made a plea to the Supreme Court arguing that sex workers should not be allowed to pursue their trade under the constitutional \\"right to live with dignity\\". Government counsel contended that any such endorsement by the court would be ultra vires of ITPA which totally bans prostitution. Opposing counsel submitted that the Act only prohibited brothel activities and punitive action against pimps. The Supreme Court agreed to examine the plea.  Reasons for entry  An American GI and prostitutes in Calcutta in 1945 Most of the research done by the development organisation Sanlaap indicates that the majority of sex workers in India work as prostitutes due to lacking resources to support themselves or their children. Most do not choose this profession but out of necessity, often after the breakup of a marriage or after being disowned and thrown out of their homes by their families. The children of sex workers are much more likely to get involved in this kind of work as well. A survey completed in 1988 by the All Bengal Women's Union interviewed a random sample of 160 sex workers in Calcutta: Of those, 23 claimed that they had come of their own accord, whereas the remaining 137 women claimed to have been introduced into the sex trade by agents. The breakdown was as follows: * Neighbour in connivance with parents: 7 * Neighbours as pimps (guardians not knowing): 19 * Aged sex workers from same village or locality: 31 * Unknown person/accidental meeting with pimp: 32 * Mother/sister/near relative in the profession: 18 * Lover giving false hope of marriage or job and selling to brothel: 14 * Close acquaintance giving false hope of marriage or job: 11 * \\"Husband\\" (not legally married): 3 * Husband (legally married): 1 * Young college student selling to brothel and visiting free of cost: 1 The breakdown of the agents by sex were as follows: 76% of the agents were female and 24% were males. Over 80% of the agents bring young women into the profession were known people and not traffickers: neighbours, relatives, etc. Also prevalent in parts of Bengal is the Chukri System, whereby a female is coerced into prostitution to pay off debts, as a form of bonded labour. In this system, the prostitute generally works without pay for one year or longer to repay a supposed debt to the brothel owner for food, clothes, make-up and living expenses. In India, the Government's \\"central sponsored scheme\\" provides financial or in-kind grants to released bonded labourers and their family members, the report noted, adding over 2,850,000 people have benefited to date. Almost 5,000 prosecutions have been recorded so far under the Bonded Labour System (Abolition) Act of 1976. Some women and girls are by tradition born into prostitution to support the family. The Bachara Tribe, for example, follow this tradition with eldest daughters often expected to be prostitutes. Over 40% of 484 prostituted girls rescued during major raids of brothels in Mumbai in 1996 were from Nepal.\\"S. Asia Urged to Unite Against Child Prostitution\\", Reuters, 19 June 1998. In India one estimate calculated that as many as 200,000 Nepalese girls, many under the age of 14, were sold into sexual slavery during the 1990s.  Sex worker health  Mumbai and Kolkata (Calcutta) have the country's largest brothel based sex industry, with over 100,000 sex workers in Mumbai.\\"Country Reports on Human Rights Practices: India\\", US State Department, 2001. It is estimated that HIV among prostitutes have largely fallen, in last decade. A positive outcome of a prevention programme among prostitutes can be found in Sonagachi, a red-light district in Kolkata. The education programme targeted about 5,000 female prostitutes. A team of two peer workers carried out outreach activities including education, condom promotion and follow-up of STI cases. When the project was launched in 1992, 27% of sex workers reported condom use. By 1995 this had risen to 82%, and in 2001 it was 86%. Reaching women who are working in brothels has proven to be quite difficult due to the sheltered and secluded nature of the work, where pimps, Mashis, and brothel- keepers often control access to the women and prevent their access to education, resulting in a low to modest literacy rate for many sex workers. Not only HIV, but other infection diseases have been decreased, examined data from 868 prevention projects‚Äîserving about 500,000 female sex workers‚Äîimplemented between 1995 and 2008. Research found that reaching sex workers through prevention programs decreased HIV and syphilis infection rates among young pregnant women tested routinely at government' prenatal health clinics.HIV prevention programmes for female prostitutes in India highly effective 17 June 2013 Foreign prostitutes Women and girls from China, Arab countries, Japan, the former Soviet Republics, Bangladesh, Sri Lanka and from other origins have been noted as working as prostitutes in India. In 2015 ten Thai women were arrested in India on prostitution charges for allegedly running two brothels masquerading as massage parlours. In 2013 there were reports of Afghan women being trafficked as prostitutes to India. Uzbek women go to India to work as prostitutes. Sex trafficking India is a source, destination, and transit country for women and children subjected to sex trafficking. Most of India's trafficking problem is internal, and those from the most disadvantaged social strata‚Äîeconomically weaker sections, lowest caste Dalits, members of tribal communities‚Äîare most vulnerable. Thousands of unregulated work placement agencies reportedly lure adults and children under false promises of employment into sex trafficking. Experts estimate millions of women and children are victims of sex trafficking in India. Traffickers use false promises of employment or arrange sham marriages within India or Gulf states and subject women and girls to sex trafficking. In addition to traditional red light districts, women and children increasingly endure sex trafficking in small hotels, vehicles, huts, and private residences. Traffickers increasingly use websites, mobile applications, and online money transfers to facilitate commercial sex. Children continue to be subjected to sex trafficking in religious pilgrimage centers and by foreign travelers in tourist destinations. Many women and girls, predominately from Nepal and Bangladesh, and from Europe, Central Asia, Africa, and Asia, including Rohingya and other minority populations from Burma, are subjected to sex trafficking in India. Prime destinations for both Indian and foreign female trafficking victims include Kolkata, Mumbai, Delhi, Gujarat, Hyderabad, and along the India-Nepal border; Nepali women and girls are increasingly subjected to sex trafficking in Assam, and other cities such as Nagpur and Pune. Some corrupt law enforcement officers protect suspected traffickers and brothel owners from law enforcement efforts, take bribes from sex trafficking establishments and sexual services from victims, and tip off sex traffickers to impede rescue efforts. Some Nepali, Bangladeshi, and Afghan women and girls are subjected to both labor and sex trafficking in major Indian cities. Following the 2015 Nepal earthquakes, Nepali women who transit through India are increasingly subjected to trafficking in the Middle East and Africa. The United States Department of State Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons ranks India as a 'Tier 2' country.  Popular culture  Prostitution has been a theme in Indian literature and arts for centuries, Mrichakatika a ten-act Sanskrit play, was written by ≈öhudraka in the 2nd century BC. It entails the story of a courtesan Vasantsena. It was made into Utsav, a 1984 Hindi film. Amrapali (Ambapali) the nagarvadhu of the Kingdom of Vaishali famously became a Buddhist monk later in the life, a story retold in a Hindi film, Amprapali (1966).. Tawaif, or the courtesan in the Mughal era, has been a theme of a number of films including Pakeezah (1972), Umrao Jaan (1981), Tawaif (film) (1985), and Umrao Jaan (2006). Other movies depicting lives of prostitutes and dancing girls are Sharaabi (1984), Amar Prem (1972), Mausam (1975) Mandi (1983), Devdas (2002), Chandni Bar (2001), Chameli (2003), Laaga Chunari Mein Daag, Sadak (2007), Dev D (2009), B.A. Pass (2013), Thira (2013) and Begum Jaan (2017). Various fictional films have featured the subject of prostitution in India, including Slumdog Millionaire (2008), Chaarfutiya Chhokare (2014), Manoranjan (1974), Soothradharan (2001), Calcutta News (2008), Lakshmi (2014), among others.

The legality of prostitution in Asia varies by country. In Asia, the main characteristic of the region is the significant discrepancy between the prostitution laws which exist on the books and what occurs in practice. In 2011, the Asian Commission on AIDS estimated there were 10 million sex workers in Asia and 75 million male customers. Child prostitution is a serious problem in this region. Past surveys indicate that 30 to 35 percent of all prostitutes in the Mekong sub-region of Southeast Asia are between 12 and 17 years of age. The World Health Organization has called for the decriminalisation of sex work as a means of combating HIV/AIDS. The Asian region has the lowest incidence (5.2%).

Central Asia =Kazakhstan In Kazakhstan prostitution itself is legal, but acts facilitating prostitution, such as operating a brothel or prostitution ring, are illegal. Forced prostitution and prostitution connected to organized crime are prohibited. Prostitution is a serious problem. NGOs reported that criminal prostitution rings often included local law enforcement officials. Estimates of the number of prostitutes in Kazakhstan vary from 4,000 and 25.000, including a number from Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan and Ukraine. Sex workers often face harassment, extortion, arbitrary arrest, rape and violence from the police. Kyrgyzstan Prostitution in Kyrgyzstan has been legal since 1998, but the operation of brothels, pimping, and recruiting persons into prostitution are illegal, with penalties of up to five years There are estimated to be 7,100 sex workers in the country. Prostitution occurs on the streets, in bars, hotels and brothels. Prostitution has been blamed for a rise in AIDS. The HIV prevalence amongst sex workers is 2%.

Government official figures for 2015 were 1,777 prostitutes and 194 brothels. Prostitution occurs on the streets and in bars, restaurants, nightclubs and saunas, and HIV prevalence is 3.5% amongst sex workers. Previously, as soliciting is an administrative offence, arrested prostitutes are given a nominal fine and released, while those procuring are prosecuted, potentially being punished by up to eight years in jail. In 2015 a new law was passed that doubled the fine for solicitation and added 15 days of home arrest to the punishment. Turkmenistan Prostitution in Turkmenistan is illegal but common. Prostitution has increased within the country since the collapse of the Soviet Union. Poverty is one of the reasons women have turned to prostitution, sometimes under pressure from family members. Prostitutes frequent bars, casinos and nightclubs; some are addicted to heroin. In Da≈üoguz, a major truck stop, many 'night butterflies' service the truck drivers in the overnight truck parks. Uzbekistan Prostitution in Uzbekistan is illegal but common, especially in Samarkand, Fergana, and the capital, Tashkent. Prostitution has increased within the country since the collapse of the Soviet Union. UNAIDS estimate there are 22,000 sex workers in the country. Many of the women have turned to prostitution in Uzbekistan because of poverty. Law enforcement is inconsistent. Some police officers will harass prostitutes and extort \\"protection money\\" from them. Sometimes prostitutes work with police to as informants avoid being arrested.  East Asia =China Officially, prostitution is illegal in mainland China, but in practice is widespread. Section 5: Discrimination, Societal Abuse, and Trafficking in Persons. Shortly after taking power in 1949, the Communist Party of China embarked upon a series of campaigns that purportedly eradicated prostitution from mainland China by the early 1960s. Since the loosening of government controls over society in the early 1980s, prostitution in mainland China not only has become more visible, but can now be found throughout both urban and rural areas. In spite of government efforts, prostitution has now developed to the extent that it comprises an industry, one that involves a great number of people and produces a considerable economic output. Prostitution has also become associated with a number of problems, including organized crime, government corruption and sexually transmitted diseases. For example, a Communist Party official who was a top provincial campaigner against corruption was removed from his post after he was caught in a hotel room with a prostitute.\\"Chinese anti-corruption official sacked for Russian tryst \\". Monsters and Critics, 12 April 2007. Retrieved 19 April 2009 =Hong Kong= Prostitution in Hong Kong is itself legal, but organised prostitution is illegal, as there are laws against keeping a vice establishment, causing or procuring another to be a prostitute, living on the prostitution of others, or public solicitation.United States Department of State, \\"2008 Human Rights Report: China (includes Tibet, Hong Kong, and Macau)\\", Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor, 2008 Country Reports on Human Rights Practices, 25 February 2009 The most visible public venues for sex workers in Hong Kong, especially for tourists, are massage parlours and the so-called \\"Japanese style night clubs\\". However, most of the commercial sex worker industry consists of women working in small, usually one-room apartments, usually referred to as \\"one-woman brothels\\", the equivalent of the \\"walk-up brothel\\" in the United Kingdom. They advertise for clients through the Internet and local classifieds. Most popular mainstream newspapers will carry such classifieds with brothel guides as an insert within racing form guides. Yellow neon advertising boxes were used to advertise sexual services to such an extent that \\"yellow\\" (ÈªÉ) became synonymous with prostitution. =Macau= Prostitution is legal in Macau unlike in mainland China, because the city is a special administrative region of the country. However, operating a brothel and procuring are both illegal in Macau, with the latter punishable by a maximum jail sentence of 8 years. The city has a large sex trade despite there being no official red-light district. The trade is said to be controlled by Chinese organized crime groups, which has occasionally led to violent clashes. Street prostitution takes place in Macau and prostitutes also work in low-rent buildings, massage parlours and illegal brothels, and the casinos, nightclubs, saunas and some of the larger hotels. Most hotels, however, have suspected prostitutes removed from the premises. Many of the city's sidewalks and underpasses are littered with prostitutes' calling cards. Japan Prostitution in Japan is illegal; however, as the definition of prostitution is \\"intercourse with an unspecified person in exchange for payment\\", the sale of other sexual services is legal and widespread. Prostitution has existed throughout the country's history. While the Anti-Prostitution Law of 1956 states that \\"No person may either do prostitution or become the customer of it,\\" loopholes, liberal interpretations and loose enforcement of the law have allowed the sex industry to prosper and earn an estimated 2.3 trillion yen ($24 billion) a year. In Japan, the is not synonymous with prostitution. Since Japanese law defines prostitution as \\"intercourse with an unspecified person in exchange for payment,\\" most f≈´zoku offer only non-coital services, such as conversation, dancing, or bathing, to remain legal.\\"Law bends over backward to allow 'fuzoku'\\", Japan Times, 27 May 2008. Nevertheless, polls by MiW and the National Women's Education Center of Japan have found that between 20% and 40% of Japanese men have paid for sex. Mongolia Prostitution in Mongolia is illegal but widespread in some areas. The Global Fund for Tuberculosis, HIV/AIDS and Malaria estimated there were about 19,000 sex workers in the country in 2006. Many women in Mongolia turn to prostitution through poverty. Sex trafficking and child prostitution, including child sex tourism, are problems in the country. North Korea Prostitution in North Korea is illegal, and according to the North Korean government does not exist. Under Article 261 of the Criminal law, prostitution is punishable by up to two years labour if engaged in \\"multiple times\\".Article 261 According to CIA analyst Helen-Louise Hunter, during the rule of Kim Il-sung, there was no organized prostitution, but some prostitution was still practiced discreetly near railroad stations and restaurants.Kim Il-song's North Korea by Helen-Louise Hunter.Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999, p 107 While defectors currently report widespread prostitution, this is not experienced by visitors to the country.

South Asia =Afghanistan Prostitution in Afghanistan is illegal, with punishments ranging from 5 to 15 years imprisonment. Despite Afghanistan being deeply religious and one of the most conservative countries in the world, where sex outside marriage is against the law, some prostitution activities are reported in the capital Kabul as well as in the Mazar-e-Sharif area in the north of the country. Small number of women from Iran, Tajikistan, China, and possibly Uganda and other countries are imported for prostitution into Afghanistan. According to the Afghan Interior Ministry's department of sexual crimes, about 2 to 3 prostitution arrests were made each week in Afghanistan between 2007 and 2008. Bangladesh Prostitution is legal in Bangladesh, but it is not considered a respectable profession by Bangladeshi society.

There are 20 brothel-villages in the country. The largest is Daulatdia which has about 1,300 sex workers, it is one of the largest brothels in the world. Unwed mothers, orphans, and others outside the normal family support system are the most vulnerable to human trafficking. Government corruption greatly facilitates the process of trafficking. Police and local government officials often ignore trafficking in women and children for commercial sexual exploitation and are easily bribed by brothel owners and pimps. Bhutan Prostitution in Bhutan is illegal but in many of Bhutan's border towns there are people openly practicing in the sex trade. Prostitution mainly occurs in bars, clubs & hotels. Some of the sex workers are employed by bar and hotel owners to attract customers. Prostitution also occurs in the capital, Thimphu.

A 2014 survey by the Human Rights Commission of the Maldives (HRCM) estimated there were 1,139 female prostitutes on the islands. Some women enter the country posing as tourists but then engage in sex work. Following complaints that sexual services were being offered in spas in hotels, and a protest in the capital, Mal√©, by the opposition Adhaalath Party, the government ordered the closure of the spas in 1,000 hotels in late December 2011. Following pressure from the country's tourism industry, president Mohamed Nasheed lifted the ban a few days later. Nepal Prostitution in Nepal is illegal. The Human Trafficking and Transportation (Control) Act, 2064, Act Number 5 of the Year 2064 (2008), criminalises prostitution and living of the earnings of prostitution by including it in the definition of human trafficking. For many, entering into the sex industry is the only way in which they could survive economically in Nepal. However, sex work is not officially recognized among the industrial or service sectors of labour. Sex trafficking happens on a large scale in Nepal, but voluntary sex work is more common than many believe. Pakistan Prostitution in Pakistan is a taboo culture of sex-trade that exists as an open secret but illegal. Prostitution is largely based in organisational setups like brothels or furthered by individual call girls in the Punjab province of Pakistan. The sex trade is deemed illegal in the country due to the declaration of extramarital sex as an immoral activity. Pakistani prostitutes, thus, operate underground and in spite of the legal difficulties, prostitution in Pakistan is prevalent. In some areas of the country prostitution is strictly illegal and traditionally punishable by death, especially in the Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), Khyber-Pakhtunkhwa and Balochistan regions. Sri Lanka Prostitution in Sri Lanka is illegal, and related activities such as soliciting, procuring, and brothels are outlawed.

Cambodia Prostitution in Cambodia is illegal, but prevalent. The 2008 Cambodian Law on Suppression of Human Trafficking and Sexual Exploitation has proven controversial, with international concerns regarding human rights abuses resulting from it, such as outlined in the 2010 Human Rights Watch report. Violence against prostitutes, especially gang rape, called bauk in Cambodian, is very common. Perpetrators include customers and police officers. According to some sources, such assaults are not condemned by society, due to the extreme stigmatization of prostitutes. Indonesia Prostitution in Indonesia is legally considered a \\"crime against decency/morality\\", although it is widely practised, tolerated and even regulated in some areas. Some women are financially motivated to become prostitutes, while others may be forced by friends, relatives or strangers.

However, recently internet forums and Facebook have been used to facilitate prostitute-client relations. In recent years, child sex tourism has become an issue at the resort islands of Batam and Bali. Laos Prostitution in Laos is regarded as a criminal activity and can be subject to severe prosecution. It is much less common than in neighbouring Thailand. Soliciting for prostitution instead takes place mainly in the city's bars and clubs, although street prostitution also takes place. The visibility of prostitution in Laos belies the practice's illegality. Most prostitutes in Laos are from poor rural Laotian families and the country's ethnic minorities.

Cyprus has gained a reputation for being a major transit point for people smugglers to transport women for the purposes of prostitution. International observers have criticized the government for its lack of action to prevent forced prostitution. The law of Cyprus forbids forced (but not voluntary) prostitution. However, it is believed that many immigrants are hired as barmaids and coerced into prostitution by this method. =Northern Cyprus= The Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus is only recognised as a separate state by Turkey. Prostitution is illegal, however in nightclubs, \\"konsomatrices\\", who sit with, eat with or entertain customers for money are allowed.

Peverill was known as a hard-working player whose no-nonsense approach to football, along with his consistency and ability to win plenty of the ball, were the hallmarks of his game.Selected Collingwood VFL Players, 2009 Retrieved 29 May 2009 Early career Peverill grew up in the Melbourne suburb of East Keilor and played his junior football at Keilor Park Football Club. He was passed over in four successive AFL drafts and three AFL pre- season drafts before being selected for Melbourne Football Club's rookie list. However, he was not able to break into the senior side there, and was delisted. Essendon rookie (2001) A lifelong Essendon supporter, Peverill was placed on Essendon's rookie list in 2001 and was quickly elevated to the senior list due to the long-term injury of the prominent midfielder Joe Misiti prior to round 4. On debut, against Sydney at the SCG, he successfully tagged Swans playmaker Wayne Schwass and scored a late goal. As a rookie, he wore the number 45 jumper. After suffering an arm injury on ANZAC Day, Peverill returned the following week against West Coast Eagles. Over the following six weeks he became an important member of Essendon's midfield. Peverill was returned to the rookie list after round 12 clash due to the return of Misiti from injury. The team honoured Peverill's contribution as a rookie by allowing him to lead the players off the ground. The following week Peverill played in the Essendon reserve team and suffered another injury which kept him out for the remainder of the 2001 season.  Essendon senior team (2002‚Äì2008)  Peverill was promoted to Essendon's senior list for the 2002 season and was given jumper number 11 following the departure of Damien Hardwick. He enjoyed what would be the best season of his career, playing 21 games and winning eight Brownlow votes despite wearing a cast on his arm for a good portion of the season. Over his career, Peverill became a key player for Essendon, mainly as a tagger but also as a key midfielder. He was also known as one of the hardest-working players at training and considered a part of the club's leadership group. He played his 100th game in 2006. Later form, however, was not up to the same standard of early senior years and his critics claimed a lack of pace and questionable disposal, particularly in relation to his kicking. Peverill did, however, lead Essendon in number of \\"disposals\\" and \\"hard ball gets\\" during 2007, despite limited action. He finished with 30 or more disposals in six games. It was widely reported in May 2008 Essendon's then new senior coach, Matthew Knights had indicated to Peverill he would be given fewer playing opportunities for the remainder of the 2008 season, in order to develop the club's younger players for the future. Peverill did, however, make a successful return to the senior team midway through 2008 and enjoyed a prolific fortnight against Brisbane and Richmond, winning 24 disposals in the four-point loss to the Tigers in round 16. Peverill was delisted by Essendon at the end of 2008 and played his last game for Essendon in round 22 alongside retirees Mal Michael, Jason Johnson and Adam Ramanauskas against St. Kilda. He indicated that he was keen to play on with another club in 2009, but was not successful in his attempt to be drafted.  Post-AFL career  Peverill was the captain and playing assistant coach for the Collingwood Football Club reserves in the Victorian Football League (VFL) for the 2009 season. Peverill stated that he had not actively sought a coaching position, but had been approached by Collingwood who offered him the role. He left the club before the 2010 season. In 2011 and 2012 Peverill played for the Aberfeldie Football Club in the Essendon District Football League and from 2013 has been an assistant senior coach for the club.

He was forced to resign from that post in a 1978 voting scandal for which he was later convicted of fraud. Henry was the founder and first leader of the Cook Islands Party (CIP). Background Henry was educated at St Stephen's College in Auckland, New Zealand. His first cousin was Cook Islands politician Geoffrey Henry.The Christian Science Monitor, 7 January 1982 ‚Äì Politics under the palms. For the tiny Cook Islands, scandals in miniature By Stewart McBride Political career Henry became the Cook Islands' first Premier in 1965 after having lived in New Zealand for several years before returning to his home country. Before the country's accession to a self-governing status, the country had been ruled by New Zealand since annexation in 1901. Global changes to post-colonial attitudes regarding nations colonized by colonial powers prompted New Zealand to alter its political course as regards to the Cook Islands, Niue and Tokelau. The New Zealand government wanted to give its colonial territories independence but, prior to 1965, the Cook Islands had no political system. The general population rarely took any interest as to what the country's future should be. Although Albert Henry was a resident of New Zealand, his interest to become politically involved in the Cook Islands was partially driven by those linked to the New Zealand government at the time. Over the years, the New Zealand government have wanted to let go of the Cook Islands from its administration but the Cook Islands and its people had never shown interest in severing this relationship. In the early 1960s, the New Zealand government had offered the Cook Islands four options concerning the future of the islands. They were (a) complete independence, (b) assimilation within New Zealand, (c) self- government while remaining associated with New Zealand via citizenship, and (d) membership in a future Polynesian federation. The third option was chosen by the Legislative Assembly of the Cook Islands, and the 1965 election was planned as an intervening election before the arrangements for self-government were finalised. Henry's CIP supported the third option; it campaigned as a party that would implement self-government while maintaining New Zealand citizenship for Cook Islanders. Henry was not eligible to run for election to the Legislative Assembly in the 1965 Cook Islands election because he had not been a resident of the Cook Islands for three years. The CIP had Henry's sister, Marguerite Story, run in the Te-au-o-Tonga riding as a \\"stand-in\\" for Henry. After the CIP formed the government, it quickly changed the residency requirement from three years to three months, and Story resigned the seat so that Henry could run in the by-election. Henry won the by-election in Te-au-o- Tonga and shortly afterwards he was selected as the first Premier of the Cook Islands. (In return, Henry ensured that Story was elected Speaker of the Legislative Assembly.) Henry was re-elected consistently in the election of 1968, 1972, 1974 and March 1978. Upon being elected Premier, Henry did much to unify the Cook Islands and to promote its newly awarded self-government. His government quickly approved the proposed constitution, which awarded self-rule to the Cook Islands while maintaining New Zealand citizenship for its residents. In 1973 Henry introduced a new national flag for the Cook Islands, but the flag was replaced in 1979 after he resigned. He initiated the creation of the House of Ariki. Other achievements include enlarging Rarotonga's airport, building the Rarotongan Resort (now the Rarotongan Beach Resort & Spa), and helping to develop the Cook Islands into a significant international tourist destination. In 1966 Henry introduced a Universal Old Age Pension Scheme in which every person 65 years and over received a small government- sponsored pension.At the time of its initiation, the amount was two New Zealand pounds per month. Scandal During the 1978 election, Henry become embroiled in a scandal involving overseas Cook Island voters. The 1978 election was the first in which Cook Islanders that lived in New Zealand were not permitted to vote in the Cook Islands election; The CIP had flown hundreds of its supporters from New Zealand to the Cook Islands so that they could vote in the election. There was also evidence that the CIP had bankrolled the tickets with revenue from the sale of postage stamps by the Cook Islands Philatelic Bureau. After the fraud was discovered, the 1978 election was handed to the opposition party, the Democratic Party; later that year Henry was found guilty of electoral fraud, and his knighthood was revoked. On 16 August 1979, Henry pleaded guilty to two charges of conspiracy and one charge of corruption relating to the use of $337,000 of Cook Islands Government money to fly hundreds of supporters from New Zealand to the Cook Islands in order to vote. He was fined the maximum of $1,400, ordered to pay $2,000 in court costs. A further sentence of three years' probation, imposed solely to bar him from running for political office or participating in political life for that period, was overturned on appeal. Knighthood In the 1974 New Year Honours, Henry was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire. In April 1980 the knighthood was forfeit due to the previous criminal conviction.\\"Forfeiture of an Honour\\" (11 April 1980) 36 New Zealand Gazette 1081.Albert Henry's knighthood revoked In 1977, Henry was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Silver Jubilee Medal. Sport In 1924 the New Zealand All Blacks team called at Rarotonga en route to their tour the United Kingdom and France. Wanting a local team to train against, Albert Henry, 17 years old and just returned from New Zealand, was asked to get some boys together. A scratch team was put together and the game was played on the Takamoa Grounds. The game ended in a scoreless tie. Henry was very active in forming rugby clubs, first with Tupapa, later with Arorangi where he was a teacher. Death Henry died on 1 January 1981, aged 73. His body was taken around Rarotonga on the back of a pickup truck, and the road was lined with mourners. His grave can be found at the Avarua CICC Church. ReferencesSources * Kathleen Hancock (1979).

Codex page  Old Latin Codex Vercellensis  The Old Latin Codex Vercellensis Evangeliorum, preserved in the cathedral library, is believed to be the earliest manuscript of the Old Latin Gospels. Its standard designation is \\"Codex a\\" (or 3 in the Beuron system of numeration). The order of the gospels in this Codex is Matthew, John, Luke and Mark, which is also found in some other very old \\"Western\\" manuscripts, such as Codex Bezae. In its text of Matthew 3, before verse 16, there is a statement that a light suddenly shone when Jesus was baptized (Et cum baptizaretur, lumen ingens circumfulsit de aqua, ita ut timerent omnes qui advenerant). It contains the last twelve verses of the Gospel of Mark, but on a replacement-page. The original final pages after Mark 15:15 have been lost, and the replacement-page resumes mid- sentence in 16:7 and includes the text to the end of verse 20, but in the Vulgate version. Space considerations suggest that it is unlikely that the original, non-extant pages included verses 9-20, but this calculation (made by C. H. Turner in 1928) depends on unverifiable assumptions that only four pages have been lost, that the scribe did not accidentally skip any text, and that the person who made the replacement-page had access to the missing page that it replaced. However Turner did not explain why a scribe would replace only one of four pages. It is more probable that the replacement-page was removed from another manuscript than that it was made to insert in Codex Vercellensis. The text of Codex Vercellensis is related to the text of Codex Corbeiensis (ff2), another Old Latin copy (in which Mk 16:9-20 is included). According to a respectable tradition, this codex was written under the direction of bishop Eusebius of Vercelli, which would date it to the late fourth century. It contains the Euthalian Apparatus. It was restored and stabilised in the early twentieth century. Having been used for the taking of oaths in the early Middle Ages, much of it is either difficult to read or even destroyed, so that we are frequently dependent on the earlier editors for knowledge of its text.  Textual features  In Matt 27:9 in the sentence fulfilled what was spoken by Jeremiah the prophet, the Codex omits the word Jeremiah (Ieremiam), just like in the manuscripts: Codex Beratinus, Minuscule 33, Old-Latin Codex Veronensis (b), syrs, syrp, and copbo. In Luke 23:34 it omits the words: \\"And Jesus said: Father forgive them, they know not what they do.\\" This omission is supported by the manuscripts Papyrus 75, Sinaiticusa, B, D*, W, Œò, 0124, 1241, Codex Bezaelat, syrs, copsa, copbo.UBS4, p. 311. It also has several omissions called Western non-interpolations.

History The Juneau Symphony was founded in 1962 by high school music teacher Cliff Berge and his wife Gladys to give local musicians in Alaska‚Äôs capital city a platform to perform classical music. First called the Juneau Symphonette, they played their first concert featuring Wagner‚Äôs Tannhauser overture, at the Juneau‚Äôs downtown 20th Century Theater. Later called the Juneau Little Symphony and eventually just the Juneau Symphony, the orchestra has performed concerts to Juneau and other Southeast community audiences ever since. In 1976 the Juneau Symphony created its first board of directors and in 1981 organized as a 501(c)3 non-profit. The Juneau Symphony relies on the talents of local musicians to fill most of the 70 players needed but welcomes other musicians from Alaska and the Pacific Northwest to strengthen sections and fill gaps in instrumentation. The Symphony has collaborated with other local arts groups including the Juneau Lyric Opera, Perseverance Theater, International Folk Dancers, and the Juneau Oratorio Choir. A Children's Concert with the local schools was added in 1980 and has been incorporated into the schedule including the winner of the Symphony's annual youth concerto competition. The Symphony performed in 1987 at the Inaugural Ceremony for Alaska Governor Steve Cowper and former Governor Jay Hammond narrated Copland's Lincoln Portrait in 1997. Most mainstage performances take place at the Juneau-Douglas High School Auditorium. The Symphony also sponsors a student symphony and coordinates an annual \\"Showcase\\" series of chamber works performed by local musicians. When funds are available, the orchestra has toured Southeast Alaska, beginning with a 1967 concert in Petersburg. The Symphony has also performed in Skagway, Sitka, Wrangell, Ketchikan and Haines. For its first twenty years the Juneau Symphony relied on volunteer conductors including Berge, Lawton Hull, Jane Stewart, George Hoyt and Bernie Hendricks. In 1983, the Symphony gained its first paid conductor, Mel Flood, with help from the University of Alaska Southeast (UAS). Flood was hired as a full-time faculty member at UAS teaching wind ensemble, conducting and flute, and his duties included conducting the Juneau Symphony. Flood stepped down after 17 years and in 1999 Kyle Wiley Pickett, Music Director and conductor of the Redding Symphony in northern California, was chosen to lead the Symphony into the future. A versatile musician, Pickett earned his doctorate from Peabody Conservatory and his conducting activities range from symphony to opera, musical theater and choral work. In Juneau, he led the orchestra in classical favorites including Beethoven‚Äôs 5th Symphony, Hindemith‚Äôs Mathis der Maler, Holst‚Äôs The Planets, and Stravinsky's Firebird. He invited soloists including Alexander Tutanov, Mateusz Wolski, Michal Palzewicz, Annaliesa Place, Ricardo Gallardo and local violin virtuosos Linda and Paul Rosenthal, to perform concertos by Beethoven, Bruch, Tchaikovsky, Brahms, Mozart, Rachmaninoff, Sibelius and others. He also programmed concertos for flute, horn, euphonium, trombone, maracas and djembe. Local musicians Steve Tada, Sally Schlichting, Kathryn Kurtz, Bill Paulick, Jack Hodges and Nathan Bastuscheck were also featured as soloists as were winners of the Symphony's annual student concerto competition. Pickett also formed the Juneau Symphony Chorus to add voices for such works as Beethoven‚Äôs 9th Symphony, Mozart‚Äôs Requiem, Mahler‚Äôs ‚ÄúResurrection‚Äù Symphony, and Wilson Sawyer‚Äôs Symphony No. 1 ‚ÄúAlaskan.‚Äù He inaugurated an annual summer Pops concert series which has featured selections from popular films, musicals and Motown favorites. His pre-performance ‚ÄúConcert Conversations‚Äù attracted scores of music lovers to learn more about the selections on the evening's program. Also Music Director for the North State Symphony in Chico, CA, Pickett has guest conducted with other symphonies from Montana to Mexico. In 2013, Maestro Pickett accepted jobs leading symphonies in Topeka, KS, and Springfield, MO, and announced he would step down from the Juneau Symphony after the 2013/14 season. A search for a successor is underway. Today The Juneau Symphony has expanded in recent years, featuring a part-time administrator/executive director, over 80 musicians, a full-fledged and multi-tiered student symphony network, and has been advertising out of town for its performances aiming for a more regional audience. The symphony also brings in guest musicians from Seattle and the Pacific Northwest for its concerts for instrumentation where local or regional talent does not exist or suffice.

The term was used, specifically, to denote the particular tribe which Livy called the Aurunci, but later it was applied to all Italians, and Ausonia became a poetic term, in Greek and Latin, for Italy itself.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, s. v. \\"Aurunci,\\" http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/43464/Aurunci. Usage The usage, by ancient writers, in regard to national appellations is very vague and fluctuating, perhaps in no instance more so than in the case of the Ausones or Ausonians. As synonymous with \\"Aurunci\\" Originally \\"Aurunci\\" was the appellation given by the Romans to the people called \\"Ausones\\" by the Greeks:Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, s. v. \\"Aurunci,\\" http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/43464/Aurunci. indeed, the two names are merely different forms of the same, as the letter \\"r\\" was a common variation for \\"s\\" in LatinThis phenomenon was noted by the Romans themselves: See Rhotacism in Latin (Aurunci = Auronici = Auruni = Ausuni). The identity of the two is distinctly asserted by Servius, cites Servius ad Aen. vii. 727. and clearly implied by Cassius Dio, cites Cassius Dio Fr. 2. where he says that the name of Ausonia was properly applied only to the land of the Auruncans, between the Volscians and the Campanians. Nevertheless, it does not appear that the name \\"Aurunci\\" was ever employed by the Romans in the vague and extensive sense in which that of \\"Ausones\\" was used by the Greeks. Further, it appears, by the later period of the fourth century BC, that the Romans came to distinguish the two names as applying to two separate political tribes of the same race. cites Livy, viii. 16. Evidently two parts of one people, both dwelling on the frontiers of Latium and Campania. For more details on this see Aurunci. As synonymous with \\"Oscans\\" It is possible the Ausonians may have also been identical with the Oscans (Opicans), as they were occasionally referred to by the same name. Aristotle expressly states that the part of Italy towards Tyrrhenia was inhabited by the Opicans, \\"who were called, both formerly and in his time, by the additional name of Ausones\\". cites Aristotle Pol. vii. 10. Antiochus of Syracuse stated, that Campania was at first occupied by the Opicans, \\"who were also called Ausonians\\". cites Antiochus of Syracuse v. p. 242. Hecataeus also appears to have held the same view with Antiochus, as he called Nola in Campania \\"a city of the Ausones \\". cites ap. Steph. B. s. v. Œù·ø∂ŒªŒ±. Polybius, on the contrary, regarded the two nations as different, and spoke of Campania as inhabited by the Ausonians and Opicans. This does not necessarily prove that they were really distinct, as some authors mention the Opicans and Oscans as if they were two different nations when they are clearly the same. cites Strab. l. c. However, the use of \\"Ausones\\" as identical with that of the Opicans may simply be due to the fact \\"Ausones\\" was used as a vague term for all inhabitants of the Italian peninsula, as stated above.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica, s. v. \\"Aurunci,\\" http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/43464/Aurunci. As a General Term Indeed, it is probable that the Greeks frequently applied the name with little regard to accuracy, and may have included races widely different under the common appellation of Ausonians, but it is impossible to account for this vague and general use of the name, unless the people to whom it referred shared many attributes and formed an important part of the population of central Italy. The precise relation in which they were considered as standing to the Opicans or Oscans it is impossible to determine, nor perhaps were the ideas of the Greeks themselves upon this point very clear and definite. The passages already cited prove that they were considered as occupying the western coast of Campania, on which account the Lower Sea (Mare Inferum, as it was termed by the Romans), subsequently known as the Tyrrhenian Sea, was in early ages commonly called by the Greeks the Ausonian Sea.\\"Pliny, on the contrary (iii. 5 s. 10,10. s. 15), and, if we may trust his authority, Polybius also, applied the name of Ausonhim Mare, to the sea on the SE. of Italy, from Sicily to the Iapygian Promontory, but this is certainly at variance with tho customary usage of the term\\" . cites Strab. v. 233; Dionys. i. 11; Lycophr. Alex. 44; Apoll. Rhod. iv. 590. Other accounts, however, represent them as originally an inland people, dwelling in the mountains about Beneventum. cites Festus, s. v, Ausonia. Scymnus Chius also writes of them as occupying an inland region; cites Scymnus Chius Perieg. 226. and Strabo states that they had occupied the mountain tract above the Pontine marshes, cites Strabo p. 233. and in Roman history only with Volscians. On the whole, it is probable that the name was applied with little discrimination to all the native races who, prior to the invasion of the Samnites, occupied Campania and the inland mountainous region afterwards known as Samnium, and from thence came to be gradually applied to all the inhabitants of central Italy. But they seem to have been regarded by the best authorities as distinct from the Oenotrians, or Pelasgic nations, which inhabited the southern parts of the peninsula; see Aristot. l. c. though other authors certainly confounded them. Hellanicus according to Dionysius wrote of the Ausonians as crossing over into Sicily under their king Siculus, where the people meant are clearly the Siculi. cites Dionysius i. 22. Again, Strabo wrote of Temesa as founded by the Ausones, where he must probably mean the Oenotrians, the only people whom we know of as inhabiting these regions before the arrival of the Greeks. cites Strabo vi. p. 255. The use of the name of Ausonia for the whole Italian peninsula was merely poetical, at least it is not found in any extant prose writer; and Dionysius indicates that it was used by the Greeks in very early times, associates it with Hesperia and Saturnia, both of them obviously poetical appellations. cites Dionysius i. 35. Lycophron, though he does not use the name of Ausonia, repeatedly applies the adjective \\"Ausontan\\" both to the country and people, apparently as equivalent to \\"Italian\\"; for he includes under the appellation, Arpi in Apulia, Agylla in Etruria, the neighbourhood of Cumae in Campania, and the banks of the Crathis in Lucania. cites Lycophron Alex. 593, 615, 702, 922, 1355. Apollonius Rhodius, a little later, seems to use the name of Ausonia precisely in the sense in which it is employed by Dionysius Periegetes and other Greek poets of later times (for the whole Italian peninsula). It was probably only adopted by the Alexandrian writers as a poetical equivalent for Italia, a name which is not found in any poets of that period. cites Apoll. Khod. iv. 553, 660, etc.; Dion. Per. 366, 383, etc. From them the name of Ausonia was adopted by the Roman poets in the same sense, cites Vergil Aen. vii. 55, x. 54, etc. and at a later period became not uncommon even in prose writers. The etymology of the name of Ausones is uncertain; but it seems not improbable that it is originally connected with the same root as Oscus or Opicus. cites Buttmann, Lexil. vol i. p. 68; Donaldson, Varronianus, pp.3, 4. History The first Greek settlers found Italy inhabited by three major populations: Ausones, Oenotrians and Iapyges. The Ausones spoke an Indo-European language and were probably present in Italy at least from the 17th century BC. Continental Ausones The core of the Ausonian people lived in a territory called Ausonia: in the 8th century BC it included what is now southern Lazio and Campania until the Sele river. In one passage Livy speaks of Cales as their chief city; but a little later he tells us that they had three cities, Ausona, Minturnae, and Vcscia, all of which appear to have been situated in the plains bordering on the Liris, not far from its mouth. cites Livy viii. 16, ix. 25. At this period they were certainly an inconsiderable tribe, and were able to offer but little resistance to the Roman arms. Their city of Cales was captured, and soon after occupied by a Roman colony, 333 BC; and though a few years afterwards the success of the Samnites at Lautulae induced them to take up arms again, their three remaining towns were easily reduced by the Roman consuls, and their inhabitants put to the sword. On this occasion Livy tells us that \\"the Ausonian nation was destroyed\\"; cites Livy ix. 25. it is certain that its name does not again appear in history, and is only noticed by Pliny among the extinct races which had formerly inhabited Latium. cites Pliny iii. 5. s. 9 According to different classical sources the Ausones were also settled in Calabria.In the territory of Reggio Calabria according to Diodorus Siculus, as also in Temesa (Strabo VI, 255) and Tauriano (Cato, Origines III). The Pelleni a tribe settled in the inland of Crotone is also claimed as Ausonian (Lycophron, Alexandra, vv. 910‚Äì929). The Ausones entered in contact with the Romans, allying against them with the Samnites. The main Ausonian cities of Ausona, Minturnae, Vescia and Sinuessa, according to Livy were destroyed.Livy Ab Urbe Condita, IX, 25. Ausones in the Aeolian Islands and Sicily According to a legend told by Diodorus Siculus, the king of the Ausones was Auson, son of Ulysses and Circe (or Calypso). The son of Auson was Liparus, from whence the Lipari Islands derive their name. From 1240 to 850 BC the Aeolian Islands are occupied by a group of Ausones led there by the legendary Liparus.Diodorus Siculus V,7. According to a legend Liparus is succeeded by Aeolus whose house, according to Homer, gave hospitality to Ulysses. This continuous occupation may have been interrupted violently when in the late 9th century BC the Ausonian civilisation site, Lipara, on the island of Lipari was burned and apparently not rebuilt. Around 1270 BC part of the Ausones moved from Campania to Sicily. The excavations on Lipari have revealed an assemblage which shares many features with those of contemporary Southern Italy (in its Subapennine-Protovillanovan phases). This insular culture has been named as Ausonian I (1250/1200‚Äì1150 BC) and II (1150‚Äì850 BC) and associated with the Pantalica I and II (Cassibile) phases in Sicily (See Luigi Bernab√≤ Brea). Archaeological findings Cales, in the commune of Calvi Risorta (province of Caserta, Campania), of which remains has been found, has been identified as an Ausonian city. In the park of Roccamonfina remains of a polygonal line of walls belonging to the Ausonian civilization have been discovered.

Background  McKeever began his football career with Norwich City as a youth team player. He was eventually released and moved on to Peterborough United with ex-Canaries coach Kit Carson. McKeever became a trainee with the club, but after only three appearances he was transferred to Sheffield Wednesday in April 1997 with David Billington for ¬£1,000,000. McKeever made three appearances in the Premier League and was looking to break into the first team before a foot injury prematurely ended his season. He was subsequently sent on loan to Bristol Rovers and later Reading. During his stint with the Royals he played in a 4‚Äì0 away victory over Stoke City. However, over the following weeks, Stoke full-back Jason Kavanagh made a full catalogue of Division Two wingers look like Best at his peak. McKeever made his sixth appearance for Wednesday in an FA Cup tie against Bristol City in December 1999. A year later, McKeever was linked with a return to Bristol Rovers after they had supposedly tabled a ¬£100,000 bid for him. But the permanent move did not materialise. McKeever moved to Bristol Rovers on loan for two months in 2001. In March 2001, the move was made permanent, with McKeever moving south on a free transfer. He spent two years with Rovers before being released in May 2003. He then joined Weston-super-Mare in August 2003, for whom he played for a period of three years before signing for Bath City in May 2006. It was here that he won a Southern League winners medal in 2007. Bath City sent McKeever on loan in January 2008 to Mangotsfield United, but he was soon transferred to fellow Conference South club Weston-super-Mare in March 2008 for his second stint with the club. On 18 August 2009 he was forced to retire following injury. He has been capped by the Republic of Ireland at Under-18 level (12 caps) and by their Under-21s (4 caps). McKeever played for the Republic of Ireland national under-19 football team in the 1997 UEFA European Under-18 Football Championship finals in Iceland.

Theemuge (Dhivehi: ﬁåﬁ©ﬁâﬁ™ﬁéﬁ¨, ) is the site of the former presidential palace of Maldives in the Maafannu ward of the capital, Male'. Upgraded to presidential standards in 1992 by then-president Maumoon Abdul Gayyoom, Theemuge served as the presidential palace until 2008, when Gayyoom was overthrown in the country's first democratic election. Mohamed Nasheed, the newly elected president deemed Theemuge of too high maintenance and re-declared Muliaage, the old presidential palace as the new Official Residence of the Maldives. Today, Theemuge houses the Supreme Court of Maldives. Naming Theemuge is named after the dynasty of some of the first Muslim rulers of the Maldives from the late Lunar Dynasty (1141 to 1388). Theemuge dynasty was from Soamavansa (Handhuvanha)descent. Many historians say that 'Theemuge family' was the first family to rule Maldives. If so, 17 Kings ruled in this Dynasty. According to some 'Raadhavalhi' , the first King of this Dynasty is known to be 'Mahaabarana Mahaaradhun' also known as 'Koimala Kalo'. Legacy and Icon Theemuge had become a common household name during Gayyoom's reign and icon of pride for the Maldivians. The palace hosted numerous receptions on special occasions, including opening up to guests to greet the president every eid. After the former president Ibrahim Nasir's death in November 2008, he was laid in Theemuge, in a public funeral for people to come and give their respects. In 2009, after the presidential palace was moved back to Muliaage, Theemuge was opened to the public to visit and tour for that day only.

The squadron operated over two periods between 1954 and 1984, mainly in the training and transport roles. History 851 Squadron was formed at HMAS Albatross based at RANAS Nowra as a land-based training and fleet support squadron on 3 August 1954.. Its first commanding officer was Lieutenant D. Johns and it was initially equipped with Fairey Fireflies and C-47 Dakotas. It was tasked primarily with training pilots and observers on the Firefly, and in this role the squadron's Dakotas were used as an observer training platform; they were also used to provide a transport and communications capability. Throughout March 1956 the squadron was embarked upon HMAS Sydney, however, this was the squadron's only stint at sea as it was confined mainly to its training role. The squadron was disbanded on 13 January 1958 following the reduction of the Royal Australian Navy's aircraft carrier fleet, which reduced the Navy's training requirements. It remained off the order of battle until it was re- formed at Nowra as a training and transport unit on 2 September 1968, equipped with Dakotas and Grumman Trackers. It also operated in the VIP and fleet requirements roles, with the latter role sometimes seeing the squadron undertake search and rescue tasks, as well as patrolling the Bass Strait to maintain security around the economically important oil facilities there. A detachment was also sent to operate out of Darwin and Broome, to undertake fishery protection patrols. The Dakotas were replaced by Hawker-Siddeley 748s in 1973.

It was designed to confirm the succession to the throne of King William III and Queen Mary II of England and to confirm the validity of the laws passed by the Convention Parliament which had been irregularly convened following the Glorious Revolution and the end of James II's reign. This Act is still wholly in force in England and Wales (as of 2020).Legislation.gov Reason for the Act James II The Act was passed because in 1688 King James II of England was deposed (he was deemed to have abdicated) and replaced as king by William and Mary, who ruled jointly. However this could not be achieved without an Act of Parliament to approve it. Since no parliament was in existence at the time, it was necessary to convene one, but under the constitution only the King could summon a parliament. In the absence of a king to do so, the members of the previous parliament convened a new one themselves, without a royal summons, instead asking William to issue the summons, which he did on 22 January 1689. This irregular Parliament sat on 13 February. They declared James to have abdicated, and then chose Mary (his daughter) and William (her husband and first cousin) to succeed him, and passed an Act to make it legal. This Act was the Bill of Rights 1689. (In Scotland a separate Act was passed, the Claim of Right, which stated that James had forfeited the throne by his illegal actions and his failure to take the coronation oath.) However, doubts arose as to the validity of the Bill of Rights and the other Acts passed by the Convention Parliament. Since the Parliament had not been summoned in the regular way, it was arguable that it was no parliament at all and its legislation was of no legal effect (although this occurrence was not unprecedented in English history). Therefore after the Convention Parliament was dissolved and the next parliament was summoned by the King and Queen in the normal manner, the Crown and Parliament Recognition Act was passed to confirm the validity of the royal succession and the previous parliament's legislative competence. Controversy Queen Victoria The difficulty with the Act is that if the Convention Parliament had no authority, then the succession of William and Mary was of no legal effect, which meant that they were not capable of giving Royal Assent to any bill in the next parliament, with the result that even the Crown and Parliament Recognition Act was of no effect either. This very point was argued before the Hereford County Court in 1944 by a litigant who represented himself in a probate case called Hall v. Hall.Hall v Hall (1944) 88 SJ 383 He argued that the Court of Probate Act 1857 (which undermined his case) was of no legal effect whatsoever, since it had never received Royal Assent. It had received Royal Assent from Queen Victoria, but according to his argument Victoria had never legally inherited the throne, because the Bill of Rights and the Act of Settlement 1701 (which also altered the line of succession to the throne) were of no effect, since both had been assented to by William III, who was not the real king. Therefore Victoria had never been the real queen and so the Probate Act (like every other Act passed since 1689) was not the law. Predictably, the judge ruled against him, and the point has never been argued in court since. Although the judge did not give detailed reasons for his decision, a counterpoint to the above argument has been advanced by academics: \\"One possible answer, deducible from rationalizations of later medieval practice when usurpations of the throne were not uncommon, is that ... [a]s a matter of State necessity ... a de facto King had been regarded as competent to summon a lawful Parliament.\\"Constitutional and Administrative Law, de Smith, Stanley; and Brazier, Rodney; London: Penguin Books, 8th ed.

Due to the choice of basic chassis for the Sidam 25, components and spare parts were both cheap, and readily available due to the widespread use of the basic M113. Beginning production in 1987, OTO Breda built a large turret to accommodate the four Oerlikon KBA cannons and remodelled the hull of the M113 slightly to provide side-access to the internal space of the vehicle by the addition of a side- mounted door. Armament The Oerlikon KBA cannon has an effective range of about and can engage low-flying targets with accuracy within that range. Firing at 2,440 rounds per minute, the turret contains 150 rounds of high- explosive fragmentation ammunition for each gun. An internal magazine also houses 40 APDS rounds that can be used against enemy vehicles. The turret can rotate through 360¬∞ and the guns can be raised 87¬∞ or lowered 5¬∞ from the horizontal position. Firing slots in the turret and hull are provided. Fire control and observation Target engagement is made using an optronic fire control system and a laser rangefinder, but due to the lack of radar reduces its targeting capability in deteriorated weather conditions.

They play at ALPI Arena N√¶sby in Kirkendrup, Odense N. Their home ground has a capacity of 2,500.  History = Early years  N√¶sby Boldklub was founded in 1938. In the first year of the club's existence, it played its home matches at H√∏jl√∏kke All√©: a highly questionable pitch which was therefore given the unfavourable nickname Grusgraven (\\"the gravel pit\\"). In 1950, N√¶sby Boldklub moved to a ground on S√∏ren Eriksensvej, and in 1968 a new clubhouse was inaugurated which replace the so-called German barracks left behind following World War II. Since 1984, the club has been located on St√¶rehusvej in the Odense suburb of Kirkendrup. In 1951, N√¶sby Boldklub promoted to Series 1, the sixth tier of Danish football. Five years later, the club reached promotion to the Funen Series, the highest division for men organised by the regional football association DBU Funen (DBUF) and then one of the fifth-highest divisions overall in the Danish football league system. By 1966, N√¶sby had reached the Denmark Series, the fourth level. N√¶sby first reached national attention in 1969 when they reached the Round of 16 of the Danish Cup. About 14 years later - in 1983 - N√¶sby secured, via a 2-1 win over Vordingborg IF, promotion to the Danish 3rd Division. Many of the players who reached the historical promotion had played for the youth team of N√¶sby, which had reached the national finals for youth teams in 1977. The club moved to its current home, N√¶sby Stadium at St√¶rehusvej in 1984 after it had achieved promotion to the Danish 3rd Division the year before.  Recent years  Today, N√¶sby Boldklub has established itself as a divisional club. On 26 October 2011, N√¶sby reached its largest success when they beat Danish Superliga club Silkeborg IF 4-3 at home in the cup with Christian Jensen scoring the winner five minutes before the final whistle. Their cup run that year, however, ended in the following round when N√¶sby lost 5-1 at home to S√∏nderjyskE. The club's best result in the Danish 2nd Division, the third tier of Danish football, occurred in the 2011‚Äì12 season, when N√¶sby ended in second place of the league table, surpassed only by the former Funen merger project, FC Fyn.

As of 1 January 2005 a CEN criterion came into effect covering the testing and publication of temperature ratings for sleeping bags. The new criterion differs from the standards that existed formerly. In 2016 this standard was superseded by ISO EN 23537:2016.  Sleeping bag labeling  A European criterion for sleeping bags came into effect on 1 January 2005. This criterion has significant legal connotations for brands, distributors and retailers selling sleeping bags in Europe. There is a key change to the way sleeping bags are labeled. A European criterion means that all sleeping bags adhering to the criterion will have the temperature ratings set by a standard laboratory test. This means that sleeping bags from different manufacturers will all have comparable temperatures. There is no legal obligation for brands to conform, as the criterion is optional. \\"EN 13537:2002 Requirements for Sleeping Bags\\" is the official European criterion for the classification of sleeping bags. EN13537 applies to all sleeping bags with the exemption of sleeping bags for military use and sleeping bags for extreme temperatures, i.e., comfort range below -25 ¬∞C. The criterion was originally published in 2002 and has now been adopted in most European countries, and also used by numerous outdoor companies outside of Europe. This norm was superseded in 2013 by EN 13537:2012 and in 2016 by ISO EN 23537:2016. The criterion is used in the following countries: Austria, Belgium, Czech Republic, Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Iceland, Ireland, Italy, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, and United Kingdom.  Testing  EN13537 requires a thermal manikin test which produces four temperature results -- upper limit, comfort, lower limit, and extreme. These temperatures were worked for normal consumers. The standard measures four temperature ratings: * Upper Limit -- the temperature at which a standard male can sleep without excessive perspiration. It is established with the hood and zippers open and with the arms outside of the bag. * Comfort -- the temperature at which a standard female can expect to sleep comfortably in a relaxed position. * Lower Limit -- the temperature at which a standard male can sleep for eight hours in a curled position without waking. * Extreme -- the minimum temperature at which a standard female can remain for six hours without risk of death from hypothermia (though frostbite is still possible). These ratings are taken assuming that the subject is using a sleeping pad, tent and is wearing one base layer of thermal underwear. For the purpose of these measurements, a \\"standard man\\" is assumed to be 25 years old, with a height of 1.73 m and a weight of 73 kg; a \\"standard woman\\" is assumed to be 25 years old, with a height of 1.60 m and a weight of 60 kg.

As a track cyclist he specialises in the madison, points race, and scratch race disciplines; as a road racer he is a sprinter. He is considered one of the greatest road sprinters of all time, but he is also known for his aggressive riding style that led to various incidents. In his first years as an elite track rider, Cavendish won gold in the madison at the 2005 and 2008 UCI Track Cycling World Championships riding for Great Britain, with Rob Hayles and Bradley Wiggins respectively, and in the scratch race at the 2006 Commonwealth Games riding for Isle of Man. After failing to win a medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics he did not compete on track until 2015, subsequently winning his third UCI Track Cycling World Championships title with Wiggins in the madison in 2016, and an individual silver medal in the Omnium at the 2016 Summer Olympics. As a road cyclist, Cavendish turned professional in 2005, and achieved eleven wins in his first professional season. Cavendish has won thirty Tour de France stages, putting him second on the all-time list, contributing to a joint third-highest total of forty-eight Grand Tour stage victories. He won the road race at the 2011 road world championships, becoming the second British rider to do so. Cavendish also won the points classification in all three of the grand tours: the 2010 Vuelta a Espa√±a, the 2011 Tour de France, and the 2013 Giro d'Italia. In 2012, he became the first person to win the final Champs-√âlys√©es stage in the Tour de France in four consecutive years. He won seven Grand Tour stages in 2013, one in 2015 and four in 2017. This included a win on stage one of the 2016 Tour de France, claiming him his first Tour de France yellow jersey of his career. Cavendish crashed with Peter Sagan on stage four of the 2017 Tour de France, forcing him out of the race. Cavendish continued producing good results until August 2018, when he was diagnosed with Epstein-Barr virus. Before his diagnosis, Cavendish was able to compete in the 2018 Tour de France but was disqualified after not making the cut-off time on stage eleven. In the 2011 Queen's Birthday Honours, Cavendish was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) \\"for services to British Cycling.\\" He also won the 2011 BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award with nearly half of the votes going to him out of a field on ten nominations. Early life and amateur career Cavendish was born in Douglas, Isle of Man, the son of David also from the Isle and Adele from Yorkshire, England. He began riding Bicycle motocross (BMX) at an early age, racing at the National Sports Centre in Douglas. He said: \\"I was always riding a bike, getting dropped in little races.\\"Procycling, UK, October 2008, p59 \\"My mum would laugh at me, and I said it was because all my mates had mountain bikes, so I asked for a mountain bike for my thirteenth birthday and got one. The very next day I went out and beat everyone.\\" It was at that time that Cavendish met David Millar at a race on the Isle of Man, who was an inspiration to him. Cavendish worked in a bank for two years after leaving school to earn enough money for an attempt at a professional career.L'√âquipe, France, 19 July 2008 He gained a place as one of the first six riders selected for British Cycling's Olympic Academy for junior riders in 2003 having almost been rejected because of his relatively poor performance in stationary bike tests. Coaches Rod Ellingworth, John Herety and Simon Lillistone lobbied British Cycling Performance Director Peter Keen to include him because of his potential. Although he initially struggled because of a lack of fitness, he recorded his first win in senior competition in March 2004; in the Girvan Three Day race he managed to latch back onto the lead group after being dropped over a climb before winning the finishing sprint ahead of Julian Winn. Whilst at the academy, he won two gold medals at the 2003 Island Games. Cavendish progressed well at the academy. Ellingworth said, \\"Cav kind of liked it\\" when asked about the rigid rules and \\"dictatorship style\\" of the academy. The junior riders lived on ¬£58 a week and financial management became a part of life at the academy as well as cooking and cleaning. Cycling Weekly described the academy as \\"a boot camp style training regime\\" controlled by Ellingworth, who, after finding out they had skipped a three-hour training ride, made the juniors complete four hours hard training at night. He won gold in the madison with Rob Hayles at the 2005 track world championships in Los Angeles. They had not raced together before as Hayles' usual partner, Geraint Thomas, had crashed during training a few weeks earlier‚Äîbut finished one lap ahead of the field to claim the gold medal, followed by the Dutch and Belgian teams, Cavendish's first world title. Cavendish also won the European championship points race. Professional career=2005‚Äì2007 stage six of the 2006 Tour of Britain against Tom Boonen (left) while riding for .191x191px Cavendish turned professional in 2005 with Team Sparkasse. During this time, he rode the Tour de Berlin and Tour of Britain. He began 2006 with the Continental team, Team Sparkasse, a feeder squad for the . In June, he won two stages and the points and sprint competitions in the Tour de Berlin. He rode for the Isle of Man on the track at the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne, riding the scratch race. He lapped the field with three others: the UK's Rob Hayles; Ashley Hutchinson of Australia; and James McCallum of Scotland. Hayles then led him out for the sprint to win gold for the Isle of Man. The race time was 23.05, an average . His success at the Tour de Berlin led to a post as a stagiaire with the from August until the end of the season. His best result on the road was in the 2006 Tour of Britain where he came second twice and third once and won the points classification. His breakthrough came at the 2007 Scheldeprijs race in Belgium, which he won. He went on to win stages at the Four Days of Dunkirk and the Volta a Catalunya leading to his selection for the Tour de France. He crashed in stages one and two and abandoned the race at stage eight as it reached the Alps. Although he had taken two top-ten placings he was unhappy not to have had a top-five placing. His d√©but season continued with ten stage wins, one behind Alessandro Petacchi's record eleven for a d√©but season. Cavendish took his eleventh win in early October‚Äîthe Circuit Franco-Belge‚Äîto equal Petacchi's record. Among the wins were three in UCI ProTour events‚Äîtwo in the Volta a Catalunya and one in the Eneco Tour. 2008 211x211px In 2008, Cavendish returned to the track for the world championships in Manchester. Cavendish was brought in to partner Bradley Wiggins in the madison, as Hayles failed a routine blood test, and was subsequently banned. At around halfway through the race they appeared to be out of contention, with their closest rivals all gaining a lap. With thirty-five laps left to race, however, Wiggins launched an attack which helped them reach the field ten laps later. They took the lead due to the superior points they had collected in the sprints. They held on to win the gold medal, finishing with nineteen points, ahead of Germany on thirteen. On the road, Cavendish won his first stages of a Grand Tour with two victories in the Giro d'Italia and four stages in the Tour de France, the first of which on stage five. He won also stage eight, twelve and thirteen. After stage fourteen, Cavendish abandoned the Tour to concentrate on the Olympics in Beijing. He paired with Wiggins in the madison, and as the reigning world champions, they were favourites for the gold medal but finished ninth. Cavendish felt Wiggins had not performed to the best of his ability in the madison. The rest of his season was successful, with a total of eleven further race wins, including three each at the Tour of Ireland and the Tour of Missouri where he won his only points classification of the season. At the Tour de Romandie, he won the opening time trial, beating compatriot Wiggins and emphasising his short-distance time-trial abilities. 2009 Cavendish's 2009 season began at the Tour of Qatar, where he renewed his rivalry with 's Tom Boonen. Boonen won the race and one stage, though Cavendish took two stages. He also won two stages at the Tour of California, again beating Boonen in the sprint finishes. The Tour of California also saw him win his first points of classification of the 2009 season. he was a surprise inclusion on the British squad for the 2009 UCI Track Cycling World Championships, where he competed in the scratch race and the madison, failing to pick up medals in either. He took up the European season at Tirreno‚ÄìAdriatico, the Italian one-week stage race, winning one stage. He then entered his first classic race, Milan‚ÄìSan Remo, where he tracked down rider Heinrich Haussler in the last narrowly winning the sprint and the race‚ÄîCavendish's first victory in a race known as one of the five monuments of cycling. 212x212pxCavendish repeated his 2008 two-stage victory at the Three Days of De Panne, also winning the points classification. At the start of the Giro d'Italia Team Columbia-High Road won the team time trial and Cavendish was given the pink leader's jersey, becoming the first Manx rider to wear it. The first two road stages, however, were fruitless for Cavendish, who was beaten to the line by Petacchi in the first stage. He was caught behind a crash and failed to make it back for the sprint the next day. Cavendish soon asserted his sprinting dominance on the race, however, gaining three stage wins before abandoning it after stage thirteen, citing a need to rest in preparation for the Tour de France. He continued his preparation by racing the Tour de Suisse where he won stage three and stage six. During the season, Cavendish developed a remarkable partnership with his lead out man, Mark Renshaw. Continuing his run of success, he won stages two, three, ten, eleven, nineteen and twenty-one of the Tour de France. In winning the third stage, he became the first Briton to hold the green jersey two days in a row. Cavendish's stage eleven win enabled him to reclaim the green jersey from rival Thor Hushovd of Cerv√©lo TestTeam. It also equalled Barry Hoban's British record of eight stage wins. Winning stage nineteen, Cavendish set a new record for Tour de France stage wins by a British rider. In winning the last stage, he led home a one‚Äìtwo for his team, when his team-mate and lead out man, Renshaw, finished second on the Champs-√âlys√©es. Following on from the Tour de France, Cavendish won the Sparkassen Giro Bochum and took part in the Tour of Ireland, winning stage two. In September he recorded the fiftieth win of his road racing career in a sprint finish in the opening stage of the Tour of Missouri. Before the race he confirmed he would remain with in 2010, ending speculation that he was moving to the newly created British team, . Cavendish retained the leader's jersey by sprinting to victory in stage two but finished fifth in stage three, losing the overall lead to Hushovd. A lung infection forced him to withdraw from the race before stage four. Although selected for the British team for the road race at the 2009 UCI Road World Championships, his illness prevented him from taking part. 2010 Cavendish celebrating at the opening stage of the 204x204px After a dental problem, Cavendish delayed the start of his 2010 season until the Vuelta a Andaluc√≠a in mid- February. Following the lay off his form was poor, and he failed to defend his victory at the Milan‚ÄìSan Remo, coming in six minutes behind the winner in eighty-ninth place. His pre-season goals were to win the green jersey in the Tour de France and win the road race at the UCI Road World Championships. Cavendish raced in the Tour of Flanders but only to work for a teammate and gain experience. He was involved in a crash and did not finish. Following a poor start to the season, he found form at the Volta a Catalunya, finishing seventh in the time-trial and winning stage two. His team withdrew Cavendish from the Tour de Romandie for making an offensive gesture after winning the second stage. Missing the Giro d'Italia, he chose instead to compete at the Tour of California starting in May, where he won stage one‚Äîonly his third victory of the season. In June, Cavendish crashed heavily whilst sprinting in the closing metres of stage four of the Tour de Suisse. He appeared to veer off line and brought down Haussler and several other riders, raising criticism from other teams regarding his riding style. Cavendish entered the Tour de France. During stage one, he crashed out of the final sprint, with just under remaining in the stage. Overhead camera footage showed him failing to negotiate a corner after entering too fast and turning too late. He then leaned his shoulder into a fellow rider as he travelled away from the racing line. Cavendish returned to form by winning the stage five, six, eleven, eighteen and twenty, bringing his career total to fifteen tour stage wins. He ended up second in the points classification, eleven points behind Petacchi. Cavendish's next race was the Vuelta a Espa√±a. His team won the team time trial with Cavendish finishing first, taking the leader's jersey. He could place only second or third in the subsequent sprint stages but returned to form later in the race winning stage twelve, thirteen, eighteen and the points classification. 2011 Cavendish had a slow start to 2011 failing to win a race until late February when he won stage six of the Tour of Oman. His second victory of the season came in the Scheldeprijs‚Äîhis third in this event following his wins in 2007 and 2008‚Äîbringing him to the record tied with Piet Oellibrandt. He failed to finish at the Paris‚ÄìRoubaix. He came second in the second stage of the Giro d'Italia in contentious circumstances (Cavendish gestured at winner Petacchi for appearing to move across his path in the final sprint) to take the pink jersey into stage three. Cavendish got his first grand tour victory of the year by winning stage ten of the Giro, denying claims that he had illegally held on to his team car when climbing Mount Etna on stage nine. He won his second Giro victory of 2011 on stage twelve before leaving the race. On 11 June, it was announced that Cavendish was appointed a Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the Queen's Birthday Honours. Cavendish (in the 188x188px He won stage five, seven, eleven, fifteen and twenty-one of the Tour de France ‚Äî bringing his total to twenty career Tour de France stage wins. He also became the first person to win the final stage three years in succession. Cavendish was docked twenty points for finishing outside the time limit after stage nine and again after eighteen. He went on to win the points classification‚Äîthe first British cyclist to do so. Over the following weeks, Cavendish took part in the post-Tour criteriums. He won the Stiphout Criterium in The Netherlands, beating brothers Andy and Fr√§nk Schleck of to the line. He then won the Profcriterium Wolvertem-Meise, followed by the Wateringse Wielerdag. In August, Cavendish's team HTC-Highroad announced they would fold at the end of the season, fuelling speculation that Cavendish would move to Team Sky. The following week, racing for team Great Britain, he won the London‚ÄìSurrey Cycle Classic, the official test event for the road race at the 2012 Summer Olympics and part of the London Prepares series. Less than a week later, Cavendish started the Vuelta a Espa√±a, but abandoned it during stage four due to the searing heat. After withdrawing from the Vuelta Cavendish was allowed to be a late addition to the line up of the Tour of Britain. Cavendish won stage one in Dumfries to take the leader's jersey, and the final stage in London. Matthew Goss of Australia, Cavendish and Germany's Andr√© Greipel on the podium after the road race at the 2011 road world championships. At the end of September, Cavendish went to the UCI Road World Championships in Copenhagen taking part in the road race with an eight- strong British team. After the team controlled the whole race it came down to a sprint finish with Cavendish crossing the line in first place taking the rainbow jersey. He became the second British male UCI world champion after Tom Simpson in 1965. Amid much speculation, it was announced Cavendish would join for the 2012 season. His HTC-Highroad team-mate Bernhard Eisel joined him. In November, Cavendish made a cameo return to the track, competing in the Revolution event at Manchester Velodrome. He won the scratch race, his first win on the track of any kind since 2008. He announced he was starting his training for the 2012 season earlier than in previous years, with the aim of being more competitive in the Classics. In November, he won the 2011 Most Inspirational Sportsman of the Year Award at the Jaguar Academy of Sport Annual Awards at The Savoy Hotel in London. In December, Cavendish won the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award with 169,152 (49.47%) of the votes cast, ahead of Mo Farah and Darren Clarke. 2012 Cavendish began his 2012 season at the Tour of Qatar. After recovering from illness, he won stage three‚Äîhis first victory for Team Sky. He won stage five later in the week, moving back into the top ten of the overall classification. He finished the race in sixth place, despite crashing on the final stage. Although he did not win any stages at the Tour of Oman, having suffered an injury in the first stage, he returned to win the Kuurne‚ÄìBrussels‚ÄìKuurne. Cavendish targeted a second victory in Milan‚ÄìSan Remo in March, but was dropped on Le Manie, from the finish. He did not manage to finish high up in the remaining 2012 Classics. In the Tour de Romandie, he showed his ability in short time trials by finishing third in the prologue but did not take any stage wins. A week later, Cavendish took his season victories to five by winning the sprint on stage two of the Giro d'Italia. The following day, he was again in contention for victory on stage three, but in the sprint, 's Roberto Ferrari aggressively switched lanes, clipping Cavendish and sending him to the ground, causing other riders to fall including overall leader Taylor Phinney (). Cavendish later tweeted that Ferrari should be \\"ashamed to take out Pink, Red & World Champ jerseys\\". He recovered from minor injuries to win stages five and thirteen. Cavendish completed the Giro, but lost the points classification to 's Joaquim Rodr√≠guez by a single point. He did win the minor Azzurri d'Italia and stage combativeness classifications. Cavendish competed in the Ster ZLM Toer GP Jan van Heeswijk, in mid-June. Despite failing to win any of the four, mostly flat, stages, Cavendish's consistency ensured that he won the overall general classification‚Äîthe first of his professional career‚Äîby eight seconds. Cavendish won the final stage of the 2012 Tour de France on the Champs- √âlys√©es, for a record fourth successive year. In July, Cavendish won stage two of the Tour de France, his twenty-first tour stage win. Cavendish was in contention for another stage victory on stage four, but was taken out in a large crash in the final . He then took on a supporting role as Team Sky attempted to win the overall race overall with Wiggins. He was seen carrying bottles for team-mates and even setting the pace on a Pyrenean climb. The team repaid Cavendish for his hard work by helping chase down a breakaway on stage eighteen, although Cavendish alone had to chase down rider Luis Le√≥n S√°nchez and Nicolas Roche of in the last to take his 22nd Tour stage win, equalling Andr√© Darrigade. Cavendish won the final stage of the Tour de France on the Champs-Elys√©e for a record fourth successive year‚Äîthe most successful sprinter in Tour history with twenty-three stage wins. He also became the first person to win on the Champs-√âlys√©es in the rainbow jersey. During the Tour, French newspaper L'Equipe named Cavendish the Tour de France's best sprinter of all time. Cavendish's main target for the season was the road race at the Olympics, which was held six days after the final stage of the Tour de France. A strong British squad of Wiggins, Chris Froome, Ian Stannard and Millar was assembled around Cavendish. The team aimed to control the race and allow him to take a sprint victory on The Mall. However, the team were forced to set the pace for the majority of the race, with few nations offering any support, and on the final climb of the Box Hill circuit, a large breakaway group of over thirty riders formed. Despite the best efforts of Stannard, Wiggins, Millar, Froome and Sky team-mate Bernhard Eisel, the breakaway could not be brought back leaving Cavendish to finish twenty-ninth, forty seconds behind the winner, Alexander Vinokurov of Kazakhstan. Cavendish won three stages of the Tour of Britain, crossing the line first in Dumfries, Blackpool and Guildford. On 18 October, he signed a three-year contract with Belgian team Omega Pharma‚ÄìQuick-Step for the 2013 season. 2013 He started the 2013 season by winning the opening stage of the Tour de San Luis in Argentina on his d√©but for .

In April he finished in second place to defending champion Marcel Kittel of at the Scheldeprijs; he faded in the final kilometre, but recovered to launch his sprint from around twenty riders back with remaining. Cavendish won the red jersey at the 2013 Giro d'Italia, becoming one of only five riders to win the points classification in all three Grand Tours. In May, Cavendish won the opening stage of the Giro d'Italia, taking the pink jersey for the third time in his career. He went on to win stage six from a bunch sprint after a pan-flat stage. This victory moved him above Robert Millar to the top of Cycling Weeklys all-time ranking of British professional riders. He also won stage twelve, claiming his 100th professional victory and reclaiming the lead in the points classification. The next day, he timed his finish perfectly to win stage thirteen, his fourth victory of the 2013 race. His fifth victory of the Giro came on the final stage, wrapping up the points classification which he had led for much of the race. By doing so, Cavendish became only the fifth rider to win the points classification in all three Grand Tours. On 23 June, Cavendish won the British national road race championship, around the street circuit in Glasgow. He overtook David Millar on the home straight and held off a challenge by Ian Stannard, who recovered from a puncture in the penultimate lap to claim silver. In July, he won stage five of the Tour de France, giving him twenty-four career Tour stage wins. He was greeted on the line by Andr√© Darrigade, the previous record holder for most Tour stages won by a sprinter. In the eleventh stage, a individual time trial, a spectator doused Cavendish with urine. On the thirteenth stage from Tours to Saint- Amand-Montrond, he rode with a fourteen-man breakaway with to go and out- sprinted Peter Sagan to win the stage‚Äîhis 25th Tour de France stage win. Later that month Cavendish decided to ride the Danmark Rundt winning the race's final stage. In September, he returned to the track for the first time since the 2008 Olympic Games in Beijing, competing at the velodrome in Ghent for the International Belgian Open. Finishing second in the scratch race and third in the madison with Owain Doull, Cavendish had not ruled out the prospect of competing in the 2016 Olympics in Rio de Janeiro having earned enough points to qualify for the UCI Track Cycling World Cup Classics.Cav back on track: Cycling Weekly dated Thursday 12 September 2013 On 18 September, Cavendish won stage four of the Tour of Britain, outsprinting Elia Viviani in Llanberis in the Snowdonia national park. He repeated the win three days later to take stage seven‚Äîagain out-sprinting Italy's Elia Viviani to the finish on Guildford High Street. He also won the final stage in London the next day. 2014 Cavendish at the 266x266px A quiet start to the year, Cavendish decided not to compete in the Giro d'Italia. His best Classics result was a fifth place in the Milan-San Remo. He won four stages and the points classification at the Tour of Turkey. In the first stage of the 2014 Tour de France, which started in Yorkshire, England, from Leeds to Harrogate, Cavendish crashed out during a collision he caused in the final few seconds of the sprint finish. He suffered a separated right shoulder and did not start the next stage. He came back to competition at the Tour de l'Ain, where he was winless. He then showed some form at the Tour du Poitou-Charentes, winning the first two stages. Cavendish competed in the Tour of Britain in September, coming third in the first stage in Liverpool and second in the final stage in London. Overall, his 2014 season proved to be one of his least successful, winning eleven races but gaining no Grand Tour stage wins. Cavendish ended 2014 competing on the track, taking second place at the Six Days of Ghent and winning the Six Days of Zurich, both with Iljo Keisse. He later ruled out an attempt to enter the track cycling competitions at the 2016 Summer Olympics due to his road commitments. 2015 In contrast to the previous year, he had a successful start to the 2015 season. He won five races by mid-February, including two stages, the points classification and the general classification at the Dubai Tour. In March, Cavendish won Kuurne‚ÄìBrussels‚ÄìKuurne, for the second time in his career. He then participated in the Tirreno‚ÄìAdriatico, where he was involved in a large crash on stage two due to Elia Viviani clipping his back wheel and causing his chain to drop. Cavendish next raced at the Tour of Turkey, where he won three stages and the points classification ahead of Daniele Ratto. Cavendish then participated in the Tour of California, showing good form by winning four stages and the points classification ahead of overall winner Sagan. His Tour de Suisse was unsuccessful; the best place he managed was sixth on stage six. At the Tour de France, Cavendish won stage seven by taking Andr√© Greipel's wheel before passing him in a sprint finish in Foug√®res. This was his 26th Tour de France win and the first since 2014. Cavendish at the 2015 Vattenfall Cyclassics.On 16 August, Cavendish returned to the track, winning the madison with Bradley Wiggins in the first round of the Revolution cycling series at the newly opened Derby Velodrome. It was the first time the pair had ridden the event together since the 2008 Olympics. On 29 September, it was announced that Cavendish had signed for ‚Äîto be renamed as ‚Äîfor the 2016 season, along with his Etixx-Quick Step teammates Renshaw and Eisel, his former teammate from HTC and Sky. The team principal, Doug Ryder, described the move as \\"a big step forward for the team.\\" 2016 In February, Cavendish rode the Tour of Qatar, taking the opening stage and the general classification for the second time. Cavendish wanted to win a medal at the Olympics in the omnium. In preparation he competed at the UCI track world championships; he placed sixth in the omnium. Partnered with Wiggins he won the madison. In April he rode the Tour of Croatia, winning stage two. On 2 July, he won the opening stage of the Tour de France in a sprint finish at Utah Beach, taking his twenty-seventh stage win, and donning the yellow jersey for the first time. He lost the jersey the following day when Sagan won stage two. Cavendish won stage three in a photo finish with Andr√© Greipel in Angers, taking his twenty-eighth win and equalling Bernard Hinault's tally. This win put him in the lead of points classification. He won stage six in a bunch sprint at Montauban, ahead of Marcel Kittel and Dan McLay, to increase his lead. Sagan retook the green jersey from Cavendish on the tenth stage, where the Slovakian was part of a breakaway that led the race until the end. He finished second to Michael Matthews at the finish line in Revel and won the stage's intermediate sprint. Cavendish went on to take his fourth stage of the 2016 Tour, and his thirtieth Tour stage victory on stage fourteen, passing Alexander Kristoff and Sagan at the finish in Villars-les-Dombes Parc des Oiseaux. He quit the Tour on the second rest day before the mountainous stages citing his need to prepare for the Olympics. Having competed in two previous Olympics, Cavendish finally won his first medal, finishing second in the men's omnium. After the Olympics, he returned to track racing, teaming up with Bradley Wiggins to race the Six Day London. The pair narrowly lost to Kenny De Ketele and Moreno De Pauw in the final moments of the sixth day, finishing in second position overall. The pair went on to race at the Six Days of Ghent, this time beating De Ketele and De Pauw to take the overall victory. 2017 After not winning any stages in his opening race, the 2017 Dubai Tour, he won the opening stage of the third event of the 2017 UCI World Tour, the Abu Dhabi Tour. In April, he was diagnosed with Epstein-Barr virus, preventing him from racing until the 2017 British National Championships. Back to form by the 2017 Tour de France, reigning World Champion Peter Sagan reportedly forced Cavendish into the barriers in the final sprint at the finish of stage four. Cavendish suffered a fractured shoulder blade, after landing on his right shoulder which he had dislocated three years earlier and withdrew from the race. Sagan was later disqualified as it appeared he had struck Cavendish with an elbow. In response, Cavendish said he was friendly with Sagan but he wasn't \\"a fan of him putting his elbow in\\". Rob Hayles, a former professional cyclist, said Cavendish was already heading into the barriers before Sagan put his elbow out. He also claimed no contact occurred between the two cyclists. Others shared Hayles' opinion, stating it was more Cavendish's fault for attempting to squeeze through a small gap than Sagan's. Race officials, however, said Sagan \\"endangered some of his colleagues seriously\\" in the sprint. Cavendish returned to race at the madison in the Six Day London. Following Bradley Wiggins' retirement, he teamed up with Peter Kennaugh, and finished second overall. 2018 Cavendish in 2018. Cavendish began his 2018 season at the Dubai Tour, winning stage three. He then raced the Tour of Oman, placing second on the opening stage. He then went on to start the Abu Dhabi Tour, only to crash in the neutralised zone of the first stage. He fell on the shoulder he fractured at the previous year's Tour de France and was forced to abandon the race. He returned to action at Tirreno‚ÄìAdriatico, but suffered another crash during the opening team time trial. He fractured a rib, and despite getting back on his bike missed the time cut, and was unable to continue in the race. Cavendish was fit to start the Milan‚ÄìSan Remo, but crashed heavily into a bollard in the final as the peloton approached the crucial Poggio di San Remo climb. He suffered another fractured rib, bruising and abrasions, as well as a possible ankle ligament injury. His hopes of winning a Tour de France stage ended after failing to make the time cut on the stage eleven. He crossed the line one hour five minutes and 33 seconds after stage winner Geraint Thomas, well outside the time limit that had been set at 31:27. Cavendish was due to start the European Road Championships. However, he pulled out on the advice of his medical team, due to a number of injuries earlier in the season. Cavendish said that it was \\"incredibly disappointing\\".  2019  Cavendish returned to racing at the Vuelta a San Juan in Argentina, after not having raced since August 2018. He finished eighth and later said it was \\"nice to be back in the peloton\\". He was not selected for the Tour de France because of strained relations with Team Dimension Data principal and owner Douglas Ryder and other health issues since 2017. In response, Cavendish said he was \\"absolutely heart-broken\\" to be missing the tour in which he had competed each year since 2007. Douglas Ryder said it \\"was multiple people who made that decision\\" and that \\"there was a whole team involved\\". Team performance director, Rolf Aldag, however, said the decision had been made by Ryder alone. Aldag had made his intentions clear of selecting Cavendish for the tour, but later accepted it was ultimately the team owner's decision of who would be on the team. Aldag announced his departure from the team at the end of the season in a statement in early September. Cavendish crashed on stage one of the Tour de Pologne after a touch of wheels around a slow and sharp corner at roughly from the finish; he finished in last place. He was able to finish sixth on stage three, however. He eventually abandoned the race on stage six of the tour to focus on the European Road Championships, where he finished 31st. He was selected by Team Dimension Data to lead the team at the Deutschland Tour and to ride in the Tour of Britain. In late October, Cavendish signed with for the 2020 season alongside Mikel Landa, Wout Poels, and Dylan Teuns. The announcement was followed by success in the 2019 Six Days of London where Cavendish, along with Owain Doull, won the madison race overall. Riding style and incidents Cavendish has an aggressive riding style that has been compared to a sprinter pushing on the starting blocks.V√©lo, France, August 2008, p34 At the 2009 Tour de France, the points he gained in the intermediate sprint in stage fourteen were removed after he was judged to have driven Thor Hushovd too close to barriers on the course. After stage nineteen, he said he was \\"embarrassed\\" for his comments about \\"deserving\\" green jersey wearer Hushovd. After stage four of the 2010 Tour de Suisse, Cavendish was found to be at fault for a crash involving himself and Heinrich Haussler during the end of the sprint stage. The crash caused Haussler, Arnaud Coyot and Lloyd Mondory to quit the race because of their injuries, though Cavendish was able to continue. Cavendish received a thirty-second penalty and a CHF200 fine (¬£159 or ‚Ç¨186 as of January 2020). The start of the next stage was disrupted by fellow riders protesting Cavendish's riding and style, and what they claimed was a lack of respect from him. His riding style resulted in organisers of the 2013 Boxmeer Criterium in the Netherlands to announce he was not welcome due to an incident during stage ten of the 2013 Tour de France, when he bumped Dutch rider Tom Veelers in a sprint finish, sending the Argos-Shimano rider tumbling. Another instance of dubious safety concerns while riding was witnessed on the opening stage of the 2014 Tour de France as Cavendish made Simon Gerrans crash while trying to push him out of the way during the sprint. In 2016, Cavendish accepted responsibility and apologised for the crash of South Korean cyclist Sanghoon Park at the men's omnium event at the Olympics when an incident between them led to Park being thrown from his bike. After the crash, Park appeared unconscious and did not move while paramedics administered first aid; he was eventually taken away on a stretcher. Cavendish has been described as confident, even arrogant. In 2008 he said \\"When journalists at the Tour de France ask me if I am the best sprinter, I answer 'Yes', and that's seen as arrogance, but if they don't ask me, I don't say I'm the best sprinter in the world.\\" Cavendish has a \\"photographic\\" memory for the details of race routes. In a 2013 interview with Jonathan Liew, he said, \\"If I do a circuit then after three laps I could tell you where all the potholes were.\\" As a test Jonathan asked him to recount the close of his win in San Remo five years earlier. It took him five minutes to recite every detail of the last . This is an obvious asset to Cavendish in planning and timing his races. Personal life Cavendish during a press conference at the 2010 Tour of California, with his autobiography Boy Racer. On 5 October 2013, Cavendish married model Peta Todd in London, making him stepfather to her son Finnbar (born 2006) from a previous relationship. Cavendish and Todd have three children together: Delilah, Frey and Casper. He has three homes: one on the Isle of Man, which he said will always be his real home; one in Essex, and a training base in Quarrata, Tuscany, Italy. In January 2015 Cavendish announced the creation of the Rise Above Sportive, a cyclosportive to be held in Chester and North Wales in August 2015. In November 2015, he was awarded an honorary doctorate in science by the University of Chester for his contribution to cycling. He was diagnosed with Epstein‚ÄìBarr virus in April 2017 and spent months out of action before returning to race the 2017 Tour de France. In August 2018 he was diagnosed with the virus a second time and withdrew from training and racing to recuperate. Boy Racer In June 2009, his autobiography Boy Racer, which covered his career up to that year, was published by Ebury Press. At a press conference in London ahead of the 2009 Tour de France, Cavendish explained the book was \\"more a biography of last year's Tour stage wins\\" than an autobiography. His \\"biggest motivation for writing it had been to explain himself better\\", to counter the way he came across during interviews immediately after races. In an interview with Cyclingnews.com, Cavendish said the book would \\"cause some controversy\\" before stating it is positive in respect to others. The book addresses many events including an offer of more money from elsewhere to leave Team Columbia‚ÄìHigh Road in 2008, which Cavendish declined; relationships with teams and riders; and significant moments for him of some races. Each chapter describes a stage from the 2008 Tour de France stages one to fourteen, using other autobiographical moments from Cavendish's life.

The Earl bore the subsidiary titles Viscount Taaffe and Baron of Ballymote (1628). Taaffe Family History 1st Viscount Taaffe of Corren left fifteen children, of whom the eldest, Theobald, was created Earl of Carlingford. This further references: *W√ºrzbach, Biographisches Lexicon √ñsterreichs. Memoirs of the Family of Taaffe (Vienna, 1856), privately printed *Article in the Contemporary Review (1893), by EB Lanin. *The Prague Politik published in December 1904 contains some interesting correspondence collected from Taaffe's papers. Theobald's eldest son was killed in the Turkish wars. He was succeeded in the title by his second son Nicholas, who had served in the Spanish wars and was killed at the Boyne. The next brother, Francis, the third Earl, was one of the most celebrated men of his time: he was brought up at Olomouc, at the imperial court, and in the service of Duke Charles of Lorraine, whose most intimate friend he became. He rose to the highest rank in the Austrian army, having greatly distinguished himself at the Battle of Vienna and in the other Turkish campaigns, and was a member of the Order of the Golden Fleece. He was sent on many important diplomatic missions, and at the end of his life was chancellor and chief minister to the Duke of Lorraine. Notwithstanding the Jacobite connections of his family, Francis' title to the Earldom of Carlingford was confirmed by William III, and the attainder and forfeiture of the estates incurred by his brother was repealed. This favour he owed to his position at the court of the Emperor, William's most important ally. On his death the title and estates went to his nephew Theobald, whose father had fallen during the Siege of Derry, and who himself had served with distinction in the Austrian army. On his death, the title of Earl of Carlingford became extinct; both the Austrian and Irish estates as well as the Irish viscountcy went to a cousin, Nicholas, 6th Viscount Taaffe. An unrelated Carlingford barony was created for Chichester Parkinson-Fortescue in 1874.

In his banking career, as chief manager (effectively chief executive) from 1962, and chairman from 1964 to 1972, Saunders was at the helm of Hong Kong's most important financial institution at a time when the Crown Colony was rapidly changing from a trading post to a regional centre of manufacturing and finance. The fierce pace of economic growth for Hong Kong was fuelled by an influx of industrious migrants from China and an administration dedicated to laissez- faire tax and trade policies. From 1966, however, domestic business confidence and dealings with mainland China were severely disrupted by Mao Zedong's Cultural Revolution. In 1967 the devaluation of sterling ‚Äì to which Hong Kong's currency was then fixed ‚Äì was another blow. Saunders led the bank through these events with a calming hand. In its centenary year, 1965, The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation was offered a majority stake in the Hang Seng Bank, a local retail bank which had suffered a sudden run on deposits after rumours that it was in trouble. Saunders was out of the colony when the crisis arose, but returned to complete the negotiation. In the same period, he broadened The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's own customer base to include a new generation of Chinese (often Shanghainese) entrepreneurs, and acquired for the bank an early equity stake in the World- Wide Shipping Group, the shipping empire of Sir Yue-Kong (\\"Y.K.\\") Pao, with whom Saunders formed a close friendship. The bank also invested in the Swire family's Cathay Pacific airline. Its branch network expanded, and it was a frontrunner in computerisation. Early life He was born at Uxbridge, the son of a banker, and educated at Bromsgrove School. He joined The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation in London in 1937 on the introduction of the Duke of Devonshire, to whom his maiden aunt Elsie was private secretary. As training for his first tour of duty in the Far East, he was posted to the bank's Lyons branch in France, where the principal business was financing the silk trade with Indo-China. He became a lifelong Francophile, acquiring a particular enthusiasm for champagne and oysters. World War II During the Second World War he fought in North Africa, Sicily and Italy, was wounded and mentioned in dispatches and won an MC and a DSO in Italy in the battles of Monte Spaduro and the Argenta Gap. When war broke out in 1939, he resigned from The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation and took the train back to England to enlist in the British Army as a private soldier. He was selected for officer training at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst where he was awarded the Belt of Honour for the best cadet in his intake. Saunders was commissioned as a second lieutenant into the East Surrey Regiment. He fought with the 1st Battalion of the regiment, part of the 11th Infantry Brigade of the 78th \\"Battleaxe\\" Infantry Division, of the British First Army, in Tunisia, North Africa, first as a platoon commander and later as intelligence officer. The division had a very active role in the campaign and after hostilities in North Africa ceased in May 1943, it became part of General Bernard Montgomery's British Eighth Army and took part in the Allied invasion of Sicily, notably in the heavy fighting at Centuripe at the start of August 1943. In late September the division was shipped to Taranto in Southern Italy and joined the Italian campaign up the Adrian coast. Across the Eighth Army's line of advance lay the Biferno, Trigno and Sangro rivers which marked a series of German prepared defensive lines: the Volturno Line, the Barbara Line and the Winter Line (variously referred to as the Gustav Line or Bernhardt Line). The division fought a notable action at the Battle of Termoli on the Volturno Line and was one of Montgomery's lead divisions for the attacks on the two subsequent lines. Following these actions the division was rested at the army's leave centre in Campobasso. After a week the Surreys were placed in a quieter section of the front high in the Apennine Mountains guarding the Eighth Army's left wing during the Moro River Campaign in December. The land was very bleak and wild; although there was little combat during the period (mainly skirmishes between opposing patrols) life was very uncomfortable because of the freezing temperatures, deep snow and remoteness from town comforts.Squire & Hill, p. 19. In February 1944 (by which time Saunders was the Battalion Adjutant) 78 Division moved across the Apennine Mountains to the Cassino sector to become part of the New Zealand Corps under Lieutenant General Mark Clark's U.S. Fifth Army. The Fifth Army had already made two unsuccessful attempts to break the Winter Line at Cassino and it was planned for 78th Division to exploit the planned breakthrough by the 2nd New Zealand and 4th Indian Infantry Divisions during the third battle. The attempt failed and the East Surrey's role was restricted to patrolling its sector of front on the Rapido river. At the end of March the East Surreys were moved into the mountains behind Cassino to relieve the badly mauled Indians. The location was once again cold and bleak and overlooked by German positions, making movement in daylight impossible. The ground was hard and rocky so that only shallow trenches could be dug with loose stone surrounds providing scant protection.Squire & Hill, p. 23. After a month the battalion was relieved by Polish units for a short rest period, followed by intense training for the fourth Battle of Monte Cassino. After the Allied breakthrough in Operation Diadem the division took part in the advance up the Liri valley continuing to fight northwards from Rome towards Arezzo. After heavy fighting at the Trasimene Line, another German defensive line, the division was taken out of the line in July 1944 for rest in Egypt. Early in October 1944, the battalion, in which Saunders was now a major commanding a rifle company, returned with the 78th Division to Italy and traveled by transport on a circuitous route from Taranto that took them through Assisi, Perugia and Arezzo to San Apollinare in the Tuscan Apennine mountains north of Florence. It was a grim, mountainous area with narrow, winding tracks, pitted with shell holes which turned to slippery mud in the heavy rain. The task of the 78th Division was, as part of Lieutenant-General Sidney C. Kirkman's British XIII Corps (which at this time formed the right wing of Mark Clark's U.S. Fifth Army), to join in the offensive to break through the mountains to the Lombardy plain. The battalion's role was to capture two objectives, Monte La Pieve and Monte Spaduro, which blocked the advance. On the night of 15 October, the 1st Surrey's attack on Monte Pieve was only partly successful, but an attack in brigade strength two days later ended in anti-climax when the enemy was found to have gone. Monte Spaduro, a massive, razor-backed ridge running from south to north for almost two miles (3 km), remained in German hands and on the night of 23 October the battalion took part in a brigade attack on the feature. The approach march to the brigade assembly area took the 1st Surreys along three and a half miles of winding mountain tracks with steep, muddy gradients. After a heavy artillery barrage, \\"A\\" Company, commanded by Major Saunders and \\"D\\" Company led the assault on Monte Spaduro with \\"C\\" Company bringing up the rear. By one o'clock in the morning, after heavy fighting, the battalion had achieved the objective, but persistent sniping and machine-gun fire from the cover of deep gullies pinned down \\"A\\" Company and prevented \\"C\\" Company from moving up to its correct position. The following afternoon, Saunders tried to flush out the Germans with two-inch mortars but this failed. The use of heavier weapons was considered but dismissed; the enemy was too close. When two men in the 1st Surreys attempted to move their position, one was sniped in the head and killed, the other took a bullet in the arm. Saunders grabbed a rifle and bayonet and, taking two men with him, worked his way round to the gully. Reaching a point above where the enemy appeared to be, he charged down the gully towards them, yelling as he did so. Four German soldiers with two Spandau light machine-guns surrendered. Saunders was awarded an immediate MC. The Battalion then spent a miserable winter holding these mountainous unsheltered positions in bitterly cold and wet conditions. Map of the Argenta Gap showing the Allied lines of advance. In the spring of 1945, the 78th Division had returned to the Eighth Army, now under Lieutenant- General Richard L. McCreery, on the Adriatic front to join British V Corps. One of the army's objectives was to break through the German defences on the rivers Senio and Santerno and then drive through the Argenta Gap, a strip of land between Lake Comacchio and flooded land south of the river Reno, to form a pincer with U.S. Fifth Army attacking through the central Apennines to surround and destroy the German armies south of the River Po. On 14 April, the 1st Surreys and the 2nd Battalion, Lancashire Fusiliers, as part of 78 Division's 11th Infantry Brigade, moved up to a concentration area in readiness for an assault on the Argenta Gap. The Lancashire Fusiliers had suffered heavy casualties and Saunders was transferred from the 1st Surreys and appointed second-in-command. The 11th Brigade crossed the river Reno and negotiated extensive minefields until it reached the outskirts of Argenta. On the approach to Fossa Marina, a canal running north-eastwards from Argenta across the entire width of the Gap, it ran into strong opposition. It was essential to press on to the Fossa Marina before the enemy could establish a firm defence there, and it was decided that a full-scale assault would be necessary. On the evening of 16 April 1 Surreys moved forward after dark and secured a base from which the Lancashire Fusiliers could cross the Fossa Marina and establish a limited bridgehead beyond it. At midnight, after a bitter struggle, a foothold had been secured across the canal when the commanding officer of the Lancashire Fusiliers was wounded and the attack became stabilised on the line of the canal. At this critical moment, Major Saunders took command of the battalion and, under his leadership, all the objectives were reached and held against determined counter-attacks the following morning. He was awarded an immediate DSO. Hostilities ceased in early May and Saunders finished the war with the Surreys and 78th Division in Austria. He was demobilised from the British Army in 1946, having been mentioned in dispatches in July 1945. Post-war banking career After the war, Saunders rejoined the bank in Singapore and was posted to Hong Kong in the early 1950s. He became Chief Accountant in 1955 and held a series of appointments in Hong Kong and Singapore, before becoming Chief Manager (the bank's most senior executive position) in 1962, succeeding Sir Michael Turner. The board of directors of the bank up to this point was entirely non-executive but in 1962, exceptionally, he was elected to the board. Over the next seven years he worked to introduce a new executive board structure. He was succeeded as Chief Manager by former director of the Central Trust of China, H.J. Shen, in September 1964 when he became Chairman of the bank.Collis (1965), p. 251 In 1969 his plans to reorganise the board to include more executives came to fruition and became executive chairman of the newly reorganised board. As head of the bank, Saunders was also an important civic figure: he was a member of the Executive Council, was much involved in the development of Hong Kong University (for some years serving as Treasurer of the institution), and was chairman of the stewards of the Royal Hong Kong Jockey Club from 1967 to 1972, where he introduced a new level of professionalism. He served as a Justice of the Peace in Hong Kong from 1955 and was also a longstanding trustee of the Gurkha Welfare Trust. His influence in Hong Kong and the region led to the Portuguese Government conferring on him in 1966 the Commandership of the Order of Prince Henry. He also received an honorary Degree of Doctor of Social Sciences from The University of Hong Kong in 1969. He was appointed CBE in 1970 and was knighted in 1972 when he retired from the bank. He continued to hold a number of non-executive positions in other organisations for some years afterwards including the chairmanship of Amalgamated Metal Corporation and International Commercial Bank and non-executive directorships of P & O, Rediffusion and subsidiaries of Y.K Pao's World-Wide Shipping Group. He died on 4 July 2002. Sources * Collis, Maurice (1965). Wayfoong: The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. London: Faber and Faber * Squire, G.L.A. and Hill, P.G.E. (1992).

Note the extent of Korean speakers living in China. The population of Koreans in China include millions of descendants of Korean immigrants with People's Republic of China citizenship, as well as smaller groups of South and North Korean expatriates, totaling roughly 2.3 million people , making it the largest ethnic Korean population living outside the Korean Peninsula. Chaoxianzu (), Joseonjok or Chos≈ènjok () form one of the 56 ethnicities officially recognized by the Chinese government. Their total population was estimated at 1,923,842 and 1,830,929 according to the 2010 Chinese census. High levels of emigration to South Korea, which has conversely reported a large increase in Chos≈ènjok, are the likely cause of the drop. Most of them live in Northeast China, especially in Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, which had 854,000 ethnic Koreans living there as of 2000. Terminology The South Korean media of the 1990s referred to Koreans in China as jungguk-in (, \\"Chinese people\\"). Government regulations in 2004 mandated the use of the term jaeoe dongpo (, \\"compatriots who live abroad\\"). Similarly friendly terms include hanguk gye jungguk-in (; \\"Chinese people of Korean descent\\") or jungguk dongpo (, compatriots in China). However, the c Korea is joseon-jok (, \\"Joseon person\\"), which Koreans from China criticized for being a less amicable term than those for other overseas Koreans like Korean Americans (jaemi gyopo, Âú®ÁæéÂÉëËÉû \\"compatriots in America\\") or Koreans in Japan (jaeil gyopo, Âú®Êó•ÂÉëËÉû \\"compatriots in Japan\\"). History Due to the proximity of borders between China and the Korean Peninsula, population migration of some kind had often occurred throughout history. However, most early ethnic Koreans in China had been assimilated by the Han Chinese, Manchus and Mongols, respectively. Thus, the overwhelming majority of today's ethnic Korean population in China are descendants of relatively recent late Qing dynasty Korean emigrants. Early history After the conclusion of the Goguryeo‚ÄìTang War CE 645 - 668, over 200,000 Korean prisoners from Goguryeo were transported by the victorious Tang Dynasty forces to Xi'an.. The largely unique Korean genetic marker Y haplogorup O2b has been detected in 1/34 of the Han Chinese population in Xi'an, possibly due to the assimilation of these previously mentioned Korean prisoners in the city.Soon-Hee Kim 2011, High frequencies of Y-chromosome haplogroup O2b-SRY465 lineages in Korea: a genetic perspective on the peopling of Korea During the 8th and 9th centuries, ethnic Koreans from Silla created overseas communities in China on the Shandong Peninsula and at the mouth of the Yangtze River. Liao to early Qing era According to records of History of Liao (), Khitans set up a Samhan county, in Zhongjing Circuit (‰∏≠‰∫¨ÈÅì), one of the Liao's 5 \\"circuits\\", after Goryeo‚ÄìKhitan War to settle prisoners of wars.ËæΩÂè≤Á¨¨‰∏âÂçÅ‰πùÂç∑ÂøóÁ¨¨‰πùÂú∞ÁêÜÂøó‰∏â In the Yuan dynasty, Koreans were included along with Northern Chinese, Khitan and Jurchen in the third class, as \\"Han people\\". Korean settlements in the Yuan Dynasty were mostly war-related. In 1233, former Goryeo commander Hong Bok-won and his followers moved to the current-day Liaoyang and Shenyang areas of Liaoning Province in Northeast China after his surrender to the Mongols during the Mongol invasions of Korea and was offered an administrator position to take charge of Korean population there. In the next years, another ten thousand Goryeo households were brought under his administration. In 1266, Wang Jun (), a member of the Goryeo royal family, was sent to the Mongol Empire as a hostage. There were 2,000 Goryeo households accompanying him and they settled down in current-day Shenyang city in Northeast China. The Korean population in China surged during the Ming Dynasty. According to the Chronicles of Liaodong (), Koreans and Manchus accounted for 30% of the total local population in Northeast China.Chronicles of Liaodong, volume 1. Quote: \\"Âçé‰∫∫ÂçÅ‰∏ÉÔºåÈ´ò‰∏ΩÂúüËëóÔºåÂΩíÈôÑÂ•≥Áõ¥Èáé‰∫∫ÂçÅ‰∏â\\" In 1386, the Ming government set up the Dongningwei () and Guangningwei () to settle the increasing Korean population in Northeast China. Between the mid-15th century and the early 16th century, the Liaodong Peninsula experienced a peaceful and prosperous development time period and favorable policies were implemented towards ethnic minority in areas such as Dongningwei (). Many Koreans moved from the Korean Peninsula to Northeast China to enjoy such favorable policies. However, as the rising power of Jianzhou Jurchens grew stronger and stronger, ethnic Koreans began to move out of Dongningwei (). In 1537, the Korean population in Dongningwei () had decreased by 60%. As Jurchens established the Later Jin (), military clashes between Jurchens and Koreans increased. During the two Jurchen invasions of the Korean Peninsula, they plundered large numbers of Korean people. Most of these Koreans captured by Jurchens were drafted as soldiers into the Eight Banners or sold to rich Jurchens as farm laborers or servants. Most of the captured Koreans in the early Qing dynasty were forcefully converted to Manchu or other ethnicities, and lost their ethnic identities. But about 2000 descendants from these captured Koreans in Qinglong Manchu Autonomous County Hebei province, Gaizhou and in Liaoning Province have still kept their Korean ethnic identity In 1982, during the third national population census of China, these 2,000 Korean descendants were restored their Korean ethnicity per their requests in accordance to the then newly issued Chinese government policy. Late Qing era In 1677, Manchus sealed the area north of Baekdu Mountain, Yalu River, and Tumen River as a conservation area of their ancestors' birthplace, and prohibited Koreans and other nonManchu ethnic people from entering the area. The Joseon rulers were also forced by the Qing government to implement harsh penalties to prevent Koreans from entering the sealed areas. As a result, the areas became obsolete with no human settlements. But there were still Koreans living nearby that took the risk to enter the prohibited area to collect ginger, hunt animals, or cultivate agricultural products. In 1740, the Qing government extended the ban to the whole Northeast China region. During the second half of the nineteenth century, Northeast China increasingly became obsolete after 200 years of Manchus‚Äô closure to the region. The Russian Empire meanwhile seized the opportunity to encroach this region. In 1860, the Qing government was forced to sign the Convention of Peking and ceded more than 1 million square kilometers to the Russians. Pressed by the situation, the Qing government lifted the ban on Northeast China in 1860, and lifted the ban on the Yalu River and Tumen River area in 1875 and 1881 respectively. During the years between 1860 and 1870, several unprecedented natural disasters struck the northern part of the Korean Peninsula. Meanwhile, peasant revolts in the south spread to the north. Large numbers of Korean refugees moved to the north banks of the Tumen and Yalu rivers during those turbulent times. In 1879, there were 8722 Korean households living in 28 villages in Tonghua, Huairen, Kuandian, Xinbin areas, with a total population of more than 37,000. In 1881, the Qing government established a special bureau to recruit farmers to cultivate the land and allocated the 700 by 45-square-kilometer area north of the Tumen River as the special farming areas for Korean farmers. The Qing government strengthened the management of Korean emigrants during the start of the 20th century. Korean emigrants were able to obtain land ownership if they adopted the ruling ethnic Manchu‚Äôs dress codes such as the Queue hairstyle, and obtaining the license from and pay taxes to the Qing government. But most of the Korean emigrants considered adopting Manchu‚Äôs addressing codes a discriminatory policy of assimilation. By 1910, the number of Korean migrants in China reached about 260,000, with around 100,00 of them living in the current-day Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture. =Development of paddy fields in Northeast China= The development of paddy fields in Northeast China during the modern era was related to rice cultivation by Korean emigrants. Korean emigrants attempted to cultivate rice in the Hun River valley as early as 1848. The experiment by Korean farmers in the Dandong region was successful in 1861. In 1875, Korean farmers also succeeded to cultivate rice in the wetland of Huanren region in Liaoning province. The cultivation of rice in Yanbian region began in 1877. The growth of paddy fields brings the further development of irrigation projects in Northeast China by Korean farms, who built numerous watering canals to irrigate paddy fields. In June 1906, 14 Korean farmers built the earliest irrigation system in Yanbian. The total length of canals built exceeded 1.3 kilometer, irrigating 33 hectare of paddy fields. On 3 March 1914, the newly established Republic of China issued a decree aimed to encourage land development in Northeastern China. In the same year, the water bureau of the Mukden province began to recruit Korean emigrants to use the water from Hun River to develop paddy fields near Mukden. In 1916, the local government of Jilin Province submitted a paddy field farming specifications document of a Korean immigrant farmer to the central Agriculture and Business Administration. After receiving the administration's approval, Jinlin Province started to promote rice production. Han Chinese farmer began to hire Korean emigrants to learn how to grow rice. In 1917, Korean farmers in Muling solved the problem of how to grow rice in regions with short frost-free period. Rice farming thereafter quickly expanded to the further north region of Mudan River, Muling River and Mayi River basins. Between 1921 and 1928, the total areas of paddy fields in Northeast China increased from 48,000 hectare to 125,000 hectares, more than 80% of these rice fields was developed or cultivated by Korean farmers. In 1933, Korean farmers succeeded in growing rice in Aihui and Xunke area along Amur River, breaking the world record of growing rice north of the 50th parallel north. In 1934, Korean population accounted for only 3.3% of Northeast China‚Äôs total population, but produced 90.1% of the rice outputs in Northeast China. During the Japanese Occupation of Korea After the Japanese Occupation of Korea in 1910, thousands of Koreans fled to Northeast China or other regions of China to escape Japanese rule. Many Korean independent movement activists and organizations established independent movement activity basis or military training schools in Northeast China and purposely move Korean people to China. In 1919, after the cracking-down of the March 1st Movement by Japanese police, Korean political refugees moving to China reached the peak. In 1920, the total number of Koreans in Northeast China exceeded 457,400. During 1910‚Äì1934, cadastral land surveys and rice production promotion plans carried out by Governor-General of Korea forced thousands of disadvantaged Korean farmers to lose their land ownership or go to bankruptcy. Since there were no large enough urban industry to absorb these redundant rural population, the Japanese started to migrate these Korean farmers to Northeast China. At the same time, the newly established Republic of China was promoting land developments in Northeast China. This offered a favorable condition for the Japanese population migration policy. After the Chinese government issued the national wild land development decree on 3 March 1914, the water bureau of Mukden Province began to hire Korean emigrants to develop paddy fields near Mukden using the water from Hun River. Since Korean farmers had succeeded in growing rice in Northeast China in large scale and the price of rice in Japan kept climbing every year, the Japanese started to increase their paddy fields in Northeast China each year and hire Korean emigrants to grow rice. The Fengtian clique in Northeast China maintained a complicated relationship with the Japanese. They sometimes cooperated with the Japanese and sometimes were at odds with them. To fight for the control of Korean emigrants, the Fengtian clique attempted to persuade or force Korean emigrants to become naturalized citizens of China. But most Korean emigrants considered such policies as Chinese authority‚Äôs attempt to assimilate them into Han Chinese. In September 1930, realizing that Korean emigrants having no trust in Chinese governments, the Chairman of Jinlin Province Zhang Zuoxiang instead carried out policies to encourage Korean emigrants to become naturalized. To prevent the Japanese from using Korean emigrants as a tool of infiltration into Northeast China, the Chinese government also tried to put Korean emigrants‚Äô school into its own national education system, increasing investments on Korean emigrants‚Äô schools annually to sever the Japanese influence on Korean emigrants. In 1921, Jinlin province quadrupled its annual investments on local Korean schools to repair the damages during the Japanese massacre of Koreans (ÈñìÂ≥∂ÊÖòËÆä) in Oct. 1920. As the Japanese often used the excuse of protecting Korean emigrants to enlarge their sphere of influence in Northeast China, the views of Chinese government and people towards Korean emigrants changed after the mid of 1920, especially after the exposure of Tanaka Memorial and the Wanpaoshan Incident. Korean emigrants used to be considered as independent activists in China, but now they were generally considered as the vanguard of Japanese invasion. Relationship between local Chinese and Korean emigrants became tense. After the Chinese government signed the treaty with the Japanese government on 11 June 1925 to assist the Japanese get rid of Korean independent activists in Northeast China, the Fengtian clique began to use this treaty to expel and persecute Korean emigrants and began to take back the farm lands cultivated by non-naturalized Korean emigrants or put on more restrictions. Naturalized Korean emigrants, however, continue to have the rights to own farm lands. Under these circumstances, Korean emigrants in Northeast China began to have the consensus of becoming naturalized and actively seeking local autonomy. Many anti-Japanese Korean organizations took measures to protect Korean emigrants and negotiated local Chinese governments into making concessions or acquiescence. In 1928, Zhang Xueliang replaced the Beiyang government flag in Northeast China with Republic of China‚Äôs flag, after the Huanggutun incident. Many Korean independent organizations seized this good opportunity to encourage Korean emigrants in Northeast China to apply for Chinese citizenship. On 10 September 1928, Korean emigrants in Northeast China established the Korean autonomy organization ‚ÄòKorean Fellow Association‚Äô (ÈüìÊ©ãÂêåÈÑïÊúÉ). In April, the leader of Korean Fellow Association Cui Dongwu went to Nanjing and hold negotiations with the central Chinese government on various issues about Korean emigrants‚Äô naturalization and autonomy. These negotiations helped to facilitate the naturalization process for Korean emigrants, but did not make success in asking for Korean autonomy. In 1931, Japan staged the Mukden Incident and invaded Northeast China by force, then established a puppet state called Manchukuo. On 14 September 1936, the Japanese set up a special organization (ÊªøÈÆÆÊãìÊÆñÊúÉÁ§æ) and began to migrate Korean farmers to Northeast China in a planned systemic way. In 1945, when Japan surrendered at the end of World War II, there were more than 2.16 million Korean emigrants living in Northeast China. Among them, about 700,000 returned to Korea after the end of World War II. In 1947, the number of Korean emigrants decreased to 1.4 million, most of them living in the communist party controlled areas, only less than 100,000 living in the Kuomintang-controlled areas. =Anti-Japanese fights= On 13 March 1919 shortly after the March 1st Movement in Korea, around 300,000 Koreans in Yanbian rallied on the Ruidian meadow in Longjing to protest against the Japanese and demonstrate support for the March 1st Movement. This is the first massive grassroot anti-Japanese demonstration in Yanbian. A declaration of independence drafted by Yanbian Koreans was read out at the rally. The crowd then marched towards the Japanese consulate in Longjing afterwards, chanting anti-Japanese slogans and carrying Taegukgi and placards. The crowd was stopped by Fengtian clique soldiers and Japanese police near the west gate of the Japanese consulate. Bullets were fired towards the demonstrators. There were 19 people dead, 48 injured and 94 arrested. From 13 March to 1 May, a total of 73 anti-Japanese Korean rallies broke out in 15 counties in Northeast China. The total number of people participated in these demonstrations exceed 100,000. In June 1920, the Righteous Army led by Hong Beom-do engaged the first armed force combat with the Imperial Japanese Army in Wangqing County, killing more than 100 Japanese soldiers. This led to the \\"Jiandao massacre\\" a few months later in Yanbian. The Japanese army killed 3600 Koreans and destroyed more than 3500 houses, 95 schools, 19 churches and nearly 25,000 kg grains. Between 21 and 26 October 1920, the combined Korean Liberation Army forces led by Kim Chwa-chin, Lee Beom-seok and Hong Beom-do fought the Battle of Qingshanli against Imperial Japanese Army in Helong. Local Korean residents provided vital support for the Korean Liberation Army. In the 1930s, many Koreans in China joined the Anti-Japanese forces led by the Chinese Communist Party. In June 1932, Korean leader Li Hongguang established one of the earliest Anti-Japanese Volunteer Armies (Á£êÁü≥Â∑•Ëæ≤Áæ©ÂãáËªç) in Northeast China. Most of its members were ethnic Koreans in China. Li later became a Key member of The Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army. Among the 11 army divisions of the Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army, Koreans accounted for half of the total number in the 1st, 2nd,3rd and 7th army division. During the 14 years of fight against the Japanese, Northeast Anti-Japanese United Army killed 183,700 Japanese soldiers. Resumption of Chinese Civil War (1946-1949) After the end of Second Sino-Japanese War, Kuomintang forces took over the Northeast China from the Soviet Red Army. The Kuomintang initially implemented similar policies towards both Korean and Japanese people, impounding or confiscating Korean properties and repatriating Korean emigrants. Since Korean farmers played important roles in rice production in Northeast China, the Kuomintang revoked this hostile policy towards Koreans in China after the intervention of Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea and even took measures to persuade Korean farmers to stay in China to prevent possible declines in rice production in Northeast China. In contrast to the Kuomintang, the Chinese Communist Party had been very friendly towards Koreans in China. Koreans had a long history of friendship with the Chinese communists. Koreans participated in both the Nanchang Uprising and Guangzhou Uprising, and contributed to the establishment of the Chinese Communist Party‚Äôs army and the base of the Chinese Red Army in the Jinggang Mountains. The Chinese Communist Party considered Koreans in China as the same class of people in China who were oppressed and exploited by both the Imperial Japanese and feudal warlords in China, and a reliable source of support in the fight against the Imperial Japanese and feudal warlords. In July 1928, the Chinese Communist Party officially included Koreans in China as one of the ethnic minorities of China on its 6th National Conference. After the Japanese invasion of Northeast China, cooperation between the communists and Koreans in China strengthened and the social status of Koreans among the communists rose to new heights. After the end of Second Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese Communists let the Koreans choose whether to voluntarily become Chinese citizens and left them ample time and options to choose. In March 1946, Northeast China started a land reform, allocating the land formerly occupied by the Japanese or rich Chinese. Korean farms in China received farmland just as other Chinese farmers did. From October 1947, the land reform was expanded to nationwide. During the War of Liberation, 63,000 Koreans from Northeast China joined the People's Liberation Army, more than 100,000 joined local military forces and hundreds of thousands participated logistics supports. Soldiers in the 164th, 166th and 156th of the Fourth Field Army are mostly Koreans. They participated in the Siege of Changchun, Battle of Siping, Liaoshen Campaign, then continued to fight as far as in the Hainan Island Campaign. Since 1949 After the founding of the People‚Äôs Republic of China in 1949, Koreans in China became one of the official members of Zhonghua minzu. The total population of Koreans in China was 1.1 million, 47.6% of them living in Yanbian. In September 1949, Zhu Dehai, the chairman and local specialist of Chinese Communist Party in Yanbian attended the first plenary session of Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) as one of the 10 ethnic minorities, participated in the establishment of CPPCC as a representative of Koreans in China. He also attended the grand ceremony for the founding of the People‚Äôs Republic of China. After the outbreak of Korean War in 1950, young Koreans in China actively joined the People's Volunteer Army in response to the Chinese Communist Party‚Äôs call. These bilingual soldiers provided valuable communications help to other Chinese soldiers with locals in Korea in addition to manpower. Zhao Nanqi, Li Yongtai are two of the most notable Korean figures who participated in the war. Koreans in Longjing also organized the \\"Yanji Jet\\" donation campaign. Donations from Koreans in Yanbian reached the equivalent value of 6.5 jet fighters. On 3 March 1952, Yanbian was officially designated as a Korean Autonomous Region and Zhu Dehai was appointed as the first Chairman. On 20 July 1954, the first session of People's Congress was held in Yanbian. In April 1955, \\"Yanbian Korean Autonomous Region\\" was renamed as \\"Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture\\" per the stipulation of the first Constitution of People‚Äôs Republic of China and Zhu Dehai was appointed as the first Chairman. On 29 May 1958, the State Council of the People's Republic of China approved the decision to designate Changbai County as \\"Changbai Korean Autonomous County\\". During the Cultural Revolution, many Korean cadres including Zhu Dehai were prosecuted as capitalist roaders, local nationalists or counterrevolutionists. Many faculty members of Yanbian University were also prosecuted. The number of Yanbian University‚Äôs faculty and staff decreased to 23.7% of that in 1966. Even Korean Language was criticized as Four Olds. After the Cultural Revolution ended, things gradually restored to normal. On 24 April 1985, the eighth session of the People‚Äôs Congress of Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture passed the \\"Autonomy Regulations of Korean Autonomous Prefecture\\", which was later approved by the sixth session of Jilin Province People's Congress as law. The Yanbian Autonomy Regulations consist of 7 chapters and 75 clauses. It stipulated political, economic, cultural, educational, and social rights of and policies for Korean and other ethnic people in Yanbian Autonomous Prefecture in the form of law. It is the first autonomy regulations in China‚Äôs history. In September 1994, Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture was selected by the State Council of the People's Republic of China as a \\"Model Autonomous Prefecture\\". Yanbian was the first autonomous prefecture in China to receive this title and it had continuously received this title five times. Culture=Education Yanbian University College of Science and Technology Koreans in China have a tradition of education. The education level of Koreans in China is above China's national average and one of the highest among ethnic groups in China. The Chinese government is also very supportive in reserving their language and culture. Korean schools from kindergarten to higher education are allowed to teach in Korean language in Yanbian. Yanbian University located in Yanji city is a comprehensive university offering bachelor to doctoral degrees. The university is one of the Project 211 national key university and a member of the Double First Class University Plan. There are also many South Korean international day schools in Mainland China, including Korean International School in Beijing, Guangzhou Korea School, Korean International School in Shenzhen, , Korean International School in Yanbian, , , , , Korean School in Yantai, Shanghai Korean School, etc. In addition, the Shenzhen Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry organizes a Korean Saturday school because many Korean students are not studying in Korean-medium schools; the school had about 600 students in 2007. The chamber uses rented space in the Overseas Chinese Town (OCT) Primary School as the Korean weekend school's classroom. There is also the Korean International School of Hong Kong. Religion The majority of ethnic Koreans in China have no formal affiliations with a religion. Major religions among ethnic Koreans in China include Buddhism and Christianity (saying mass in Korean). Public Media Most ethnic Koreans in China speak Mandarin Chinese and many also speak fluent Korean as their mother tongue. Many Chinese of Korean descent have ancestral roots and family ties in the Hamgyong region of North Korea and speak the Hamgy≈èng dialect of Korean according to North Korean conventions. However, since South Korea has been more prolific in exporting its entertainment culture, more Korean Chinese broadcasters have been using Seoul dialect. The so-called Korean Wave (Hallyu) has influenced fashion styles. North Koreans North Korean defectors often pass through China. Some of them settle there while others continue to South Korea. China has a large number of North Korean refugees, estimated in the tens of thousands. Some North Korean refugees who are unable to obtain transport to South Korea instead marry chaoxianzu and settle down in China, blending into the community; however, they are still subject to deportation if discovered by the authorities. , there are an estimated 4,000 to 5,000 North Koreans residing as legal resident aliens in China. An increasing number are applying for naturalization as Chinese citizens; this requires a certificate of loss of North Korean nationality, which North Korean authorities have recently become more reluctant to issue. Major North Korean universities, such as the Kim Il-sung University and the Pyongyang University of Foreign Studies, send a few dozen exchange students to Peking University and other top-ranked Chinese universities each year. In June 2012, the Los Angeles Times reported that Beijing and Pyongyang had signed an agreement to grant as many as 40,000 industrial trainee visas to North Koreans to permit them to work in China per year; the first batch of workers arrived earlier in the year in the city of Tumen in Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture. South Koreans After the 1992 normalization of diplomatic relations between the PRC and South Korea, many citizens of South Korea started to settle in Mainland China; large new communities of South Koreans have subsequenrly formed in Beijing, Shanghai, Dalian and Qingdao. The South Korean government officially recognizes seven Korean international schools in China (in Yanbian, Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, and Dalian, respectively), all founded between 1997 and 2003. Most of the population of Koreans in Hong Kong consists of South Korea expatriates. Typically, they come to China as employees of South Korean corporations on short-term international assignments; when their assignments are completed, many prefer to stay on in China, using the contacts they have made to start their own consulting businesses or import/export firms. Other South Koreans moved to China on their own after becoming unemployed during the 1997 financial crisis; they used funds they had saved up for retirement to open small restaurants or shops. The low cost of living compared to Seoul, especially the cheap tuition at international schools teaching English and Chinese, is another pull factor for South Korean migration to Mainland China. The number of South Koreans in China was estimated to be 300,000 to 400,000 ; at the 2006 rate of growth, their population had been expected to reach one million by 2008. By 2007, the South Korean Embassy in Beijing stated their population had reached 700,000. However, due to the global economic downturn in 2008 and the depreciation of the Korean won, large numbers of those returned to South Korea. A Bloomberg News article initially stated the proportion as 20% (roughly 140,000 people). Between 2008 and 2009, South Korean government figures show that the number of Koreans in China dropped by 433,000. The Sixth National Population Census of the People's Republic of China reported 120,750 South Koreans in Mainland China, the largest single foreign group. By city=Shenzhen there were about 20,000 people of Korean origins in Shenzhen, with the Nanshan and Futian districts having significant numbers. That year the chairperson of the Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Kang Hee-bang, stated that about 10,000 lived in Overseas Chinese Town (OCT). Shekou, the area around Shenzhen University, and Donghai Garden housing estate had other significant concentrations. Donghai Garden began attracting Koreans due to its transportation links and because, around 1998, it was the sole residential building classified as 3-A. Donghai had about 200 Korean families. South Koreans began going to the Shenzhen area during the 1980s as part of the reform and opening up era, and this increased when South Korea established formal diplomatic relations with the PRC. In 2007 about 500 South Korean companies in Shenzhen were involved in China-South Korean trade, and there were an additional 500 South Korean companies doing business in Shenzhen. In 2007 Kang stated that most of the Koreans in Shenzhen had lived there for five years or longer. there were some Korean children enrolled in schools for Chinese locals. spaces for foreign students in Shenzhen public schools were limited, so some Korean residents are forced to put their children in private schools. In addition, in 2007, there were about 900 Korean children in non-Chinese K-12 institutions; the latter included 400 of them at private international schools in Shekou, 300 in private schools in Luohu District, and 200 enrolled at the Baishizhou Bilingual School. Because many Korean students are not studying in Korean-medium schools, the Korean Chamber of Commerce and Industry operates a Korean Saturday School; it had about 600 students in 2007. The chamber uses rented space in the OCT Primary School as the Korean weekend school's classroom.

The population in 2011 was 22,975,Instituto Nacional de Estat√≠stica in an area of 88.25 km¬≤. Its urban population is 6,100 inhabitants. History According to some historical sources, the earliest settlement in the area occurred along the edges of small lakes or marshes (), which were drained in order to create a fertile land. There are many pre- historic vestiges of the early settlements, including menhirs (standing stones), funerary necropoles and artifacts that date a human presence to remote history. The entire region of the Algarve was conquered by the Arabs when they moved into the Iberian peninsula in the 8th century. When the area was later reconquered in the mid-12th century by Christian forces from the north, it was integrated into the fledgling Kingdom of Portugal. Muslim influence in Lagoa was profound, from the rich patrimony left behind, not only in neighboring Silves (then taifa capital), but also in Lagoa where commerce thrived. Convent of Saint Joseph from Carmelite nuns. During the 14th century, a favorable confluence of conditions allowed Lagoa to develop rapidly. Yet, the events of the 1755 Lisbon earthquake left little marks from this period: the reconstruction wiped away many of its classic architecture (there are a rare few of this period, including the churches of Est√¥mbar and Porches. The coastal zone was, for centuries, attacked by pirates and corsairs, and those responsible for public security erected various defensive structures along the coast, such as the fortresses of Nossa Senhora da Rocha, Carvoeiro and S√£o Jo√£o de Ferragudo, in addition to the lookouts and redoubts, such as the tower of Lapa or Marinha. For a long period, Lagoa was governed within the municipality of Silves. On the 16 January 1773, a foral (charter) was issued King Joseph I, incorporating the municipality of Lagoa, after its principal settlement (Lagoa) was elevated to the status of town (). The local natural resources contributed to the current economic structure of the municipality, with agriculture (especially fruit and wine production), fishing, light industry and, later, tourism influencing the activities of the region. The fishing industry (in the communities of Ferragudo, Benagil, Carvoeiro and Senhora da Rocha), vineyards, and the traditional products of irrigated agriculture were the principal sources of wealth for the area until the 1970s. Driven by the abundance of fish, the canning and conserve industry at the beginning of the 20th century was responsible for an economic boom, that brought a general prosperity and wealth to the region. From the 1960s, however, tourism has been the principal driver of the area's development and the creation of the infrastructure. This has brought an increase in job creation, the growth a rapidly became the economic motor of the municipality, and has now assumed a permanent place in the local economy. Parallel to the growth of tourism has been the growth of all the related activities, especially in the construction industry, services, and general commerce, which resulted in the elevation of Lagoa to the status of city.

Physical geography Lagoa is bounded on the north and east by the municipality of Silves, west by Portim√£o, and fronts the Atlantic Ocean to the south. Lagoa is a municipality rich in beaches.

Economy  Lagoa is one of the most important tourist areas of the Algarve. There are various factors which have contributed to its popularity, namely the variety of offerings to visitors (the beauty of its beaches, modern tourist accommodation, its golf courses and cultural heritage), orderly planning of landuse within the council area, its social stability, and the friendliness of its citizens. The city continues to improve facilities and organize events of interest to tourists. Each summer it hosts a large exhibition of craft products at the Parque de Feiras e Exposi√ß√µes de Lagoa (Fair and Exhibition Grounds of Lagoa), known by its official name's acronym FATACIL.

Later, founder Waksal pleaded guilty to various charges, including securities fraud, and on June 10, 2003, was sentenced to seven years and three months in prison. Martha Stewart, the founder of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, also became embroiled in the scandal after it emerged that her broker, Peter Bacanovic, tipped her off that ImClone was about to drop. In response, Stewart sold about $230,000 in ImClone shares on December 27, 2001, a day before the announcement of the FDA decision. Stewart's involvement would have never come to light had Doug Faneuil, Bacanovic's assistant, not disclosed it to investigators. Although Stewart maintained her innocence, she was found guilty and sentenced on July 16, 2004, to five months in prison, five months of home confinement, and two years' probation for lying about a stock sale, conspiracy, and obstruction of justice. Ultimately a new clinical trial and FDA filing prepared by ImClone's partner Merck KGaA (\\"German Merck\\" not to be confused with the U.S. company of similar name) resulted in an FDA approval of Erbitux in 2004 for use in colon cancer. A Congressional hearing on improprieties at ImClone, held in October 2002, unveiled a culture of corruption dating back to 1986. This was the year that ImClone CEO Waksal first forged the signature of the company's general counsel John Landes (one of the three original employees of the company) for financial gain. Nonetheless, Landes defended Waksal's illegal actions at the hearings before the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, portraying the forgery as \\"a good-faith misunderstanding\\". The subcommittee's chairman, Jim Greenwood of Pennsylvania, replied, \\"My children know better than that, Mr. Landes.\\" Further questioning about this and subsequent forgeries on Waksal's part revealed that neither Landes, the chief legal officer of the company, nor the company's outside directors reported Waksal's actions to proper authorities or made any moves to have Waksal removed as CEO. Instead, testimony revealed that they initiated their own internal investigation, which was never concluded. The FDA's February 2004 announcement of approval for use of Erbitux for treatment of colorectal cancer reported that conclusions were drawn from a trial involving 329 patients, of which 10.8% responded when Erbitux was used by itself, delaying tumor growth by 1.5 months. When used in conjunction with a standard treatment irinotecan, 22.9% of patients responded and tumor growth was delayed by approximately 4.1 months. In September 2001, Bristol-Myers Squibb committed $2 billion (including a $1 billion up-front cash payment) for less than 20% of ImClone due to what was called at the time the drug's \\"blockbuster\\" potential. In January 2006, the company was put up for sale but failed to find any buyers, likely because Erbitux by that time faced significant competition in the medical marketplace. ImClone directors withdrew the sale of the company in mid-2006. In April 2009, Eli Lilly and Company purchased ImClone Systems Inc. for an estimated $6.8 billion. Indictment and SEC charges Waksal was arrested June 12, 2002, on charges of conspiring to commit insider trading. On October 15, he pleaded guilty to charges of securities fraud, bank fraud, obstruction of justice, and perjury. On March 3, 2003, he pleaded guilty to charges of conspiracy and wire fraud for avoiding $1.2 million in sales taxes on $15 million in artwork. The art included works by Mark Rothko, Richard Serra, Roy Lichtenstein, and Willem de Kooning, purchased between June 2000 and October 2001. He did not pay the necessary taxes at the time of purchase, but paid in fall 2002. On June 10, 2003, Waksal was sentenced to seven years and three months in prison and ordered to pay more than $4 million in fines and back taxes, all the maximum punishments allowable under law. Waksal was released in 2009. On June 4, 2003, a federal grand jury in Manhattan indicted Stewart and her former broker, Peter Bacanovic on nine criminal counts. The government alleged that, by selling when she did, Stewart avoided losses of $45,673. The charges included securities fraud, obstruction of justice, and conspiracy. Stewart pleaded not guilty, saying she had a standing order with Bacanovic to sell her shares if ImClone stock fell below $60. Stewart resigned as CEO and chairman of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia on the same day she was indicted, but remained on the company's board.Martha Stewart, Broker, Indicted, CNN, June 4, 2004. The day after her indictment, Stewart took out a full-page advertisement in USA Today and launched a website with an open letter of defense \\"to my friends and loyal supporters.\\" She said, \\"I want you to know that I am innocent‚Äîand that I will fight to clear my name... The government's attempt to criminalize these actions makes no sense to me... I am confident I will be exonerated of these baseless charges.\\" On the day she was indicted, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a civil complaintSEC.gov against Stewart with charges of insider trading (for violating ¬ß 17(a) of the Securities Act of 1933, ¬ß 10(b) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, and SEC Rule 10b-5).SEC.gov The civil charges were stayed pending the criminal proceeding.Jurist.law.pitt.edu Trial Stewart's trial was initially set for January 12, 2004, at the request of her lawyers who said they needed more time to analyze the evidence. The trial eventually began on January 20 in New York City presided over by U.S. District Judge Miriam Goldman Cedarbaum.United States v. Stewart (Stewart I), 305 F. Supp. 2d 368, 378 (S.D.N.Y. 2004). During the trial, Stewart maintained her innocence.\\"Stewart Asks to Start Prison Sentence; She says she wants to put this behind her so she can move on with her life and career\\", Los Angeles Times, September 16, 2004. On February 27, 2004, Judge Cederbaum dismissed the charge of securities fraud, which could have led to up to ten years in prison and a $1 million fine. The judge found that \\"no reasonable juror can find beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant lied for the purpose of influencing the market for the securities of her own company.\\"\\"Judge Tosses Fraud Charge Against Stewart,\\" TheStreet.com, February 27, 2004. Verdict The jury deliberated for three days following the five-week trial. On March 5, 2004, Stewart was found guilty by the jury of eight women and four men on all four remaining counts: conspiracy, obstruction of justice, and two counts of making false statements to a federal investigator. She was not found guilty of one of the most publicized charges: having falsely claimed that there was an agreement to sell her shares when they fell to $60.00. The jury did find that Stewart lied and obstructed justice on other grounds, including her claim that she was reminded of the prior $60.00 agreement and urged to sell on that basis. Following the jury verdict, a message was posted on her website, reading, in part: Sentencing On July 8, a motion for a new trial was denied and sentencing was set for July 16. Stewart and Bacanovic were each sentenced to five months in prison, five months of home confinement, and two years' probation for lying about a stock sale, conspiracy, and obstruction of justice. Stewart was ordered to pay a $30,000 fine, while Bacanovic was fined $4,000. The judge stayed the sentence while they prepared their appeals. On September 15, 2004, accompanied by her lawyers and members of the board of directors of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Stewart held a press conference to announce her decision to begin serving her sentence as soon as possible while vowing to continue ahead with her appeal. The event was featured live on national television. On September 21, Judge Miriam Cedarbaum ordered her to surrender by October 8. On September 29, the Federal Bureau of Prisons announced that Stewart would serve her sentence at the federal prison camp near Alderson, West Virginia, denying her request to serve it at the federal prison in Danbury, Connecticut.\\"Martha's new digs; Judge assigns Stewart to minimum security facility in West Virginia\\" (September 30, 2004) Beaumont Enterprise, Beaumont, Texas.\\"Welcome to 'Camp Cupcake'; Alderson Residents Ready for Latest Celebrity Inmate\\" (October 4, 2004) Hartford Courant, Hartford, Connecticut.

On May 21, 2004, Larry Stewart (no relation), a United States Secret Service lab director who testified for the government against Martha Stewart, was charged with two counts of perjury. Stock in Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia jumped as much as 23 percent on the news. Larry Stewart was an expert witness about the ink on a broker's worksheet, testifying that the note about selling ImClone shares when it dropped below $60 was different from the rest of the ink on the document. The charges arose when Susan Fortunato, a Secret Service co-worker, complained that she had in fact done the analysis and that it had never been examined by Stewart. Although the jury at the perjury trial felt that Larry Stewart had taken unfair credit for the work done, it did not amount to perjury and he was found not guilty on October 5, 2004. The jury had trouble believing Fortunato, feeling that she had an axe to grind with Stewart. In October 2005, Stewart was informed that due to her status as a convicted felon in the United States, she was inadmissible for entry into Canada under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Stewart had planned to attend the Windsor Pumpkin Regatta in Nova Scotia. Within two days of the story's breaking, then Canadian Minister of Citizenship and Immigration Joe Volpe granted Stewart a temporary resident permit, thereby allowing her to temporarily enter Canada.CTV.ca: Way cleared for Stewart to attend N.S. festival, October 7, 2005.

Under the settlement, Stewart agreed to a five-year bar from serving as a director, or as the CEO, CFO (or other officer roles in which she would be responsible for preparing, auditing, or disclosing financial results), of any public company. She also agreed to pay the maximum penalty of three times the losses she avoided, or $195,000. Bacanovic agreed to pay penalties totaling about $75,000, and was barred associating with a broker, dealer or investment adviser.\\"Martha Stewart and Peter Bacanovic Settle SEC's Insider Trading Charges\\", Securities and Exchange Commission press release, August 7, 2006.

Visually, the musette is characterised by the short, cylindrical shuttle-drone and the two chalumeaux. Both the chanters and the drones have a cylindrical bore and use a double reed, giving a quiet tone similar to the oboe. The instrument is blown by a bellows. The qualification \\"de cour\\" does not appear in the name for the instrument in original musical scores; title-pages usually refer to it simply as a musette, allowing occasional confusion with the piccolo oboe, also known as the (oboe) musette. History First appearing in France, at the very end of the sixteenth century, the musette was refined over the next hundred years by a number of instrument-making families. The best-known contributions came from the Hotteterre family:chiefly Martin, responsible for the petit chalumeau, and his son Jacques who published a complete M√©thode Martin Hotteterre added a second chanter, the petit chalumeau, extending the instrument's range by six semitones. The bourdon, originally designed to accompany essentially modal music, became simpler as the chalumeaux became more complicated. The final form of the musette is fully chromatic, with a range of an octave and half starting from F above middle C; the bourdon provides drones for C, D and G. The qualification de cour refers to the instrument's connection with the French court and aristocracy of the early seventeenth century. \\"Exotic\\" - in the sense of imported or out of place - elements were fashionable, resulting in the appearance of traditional instruments such as bagpipe, hurdy-gurdy and galoubet in compositions for professionals and amateurs alike. The musette may well have benefited from being a bellows-blown instrument, too; it was generally considered unseemly for women to play any mouth-blown instrument. Borjon de Scellery, however, does explicitly identify grimacing and pulling faces as a habit of ill-trained musette-players. At the height of its popularity, the musette (like the hurdy-gurdy) was used not just for chamber- music but also in larger-scale compositions such as operas, where it was associated with shepherds, peasants and other pastoral elements. After the French Revolution, the musette seems to have fallen rapidly out of favour while simpler forms of bagpipe remained popular as folk-instruments. As a result, musicologists examining French baroque music at the end of the 19th century found it difficult to imagine that what they took to be the same as a simple folk bagpipe could ever have had a place in highly sophisticated music for the court. The \\"authentic performance\\" approach generally familiar from the 1970s onward, plus skillful restoration of original instruments by makers such as R√©mi Dubois (Verviers, Belgium), has made it possible to hear works such as Ch√©deville's \\"Pastor Fido\\" (based on Vivaldi's \\"Seasons\\"), chamber- music by Boismortier and even Rameau's op√©ra-ballet \\"Les F√™tes d'H√©b√©\\" in their original form. Chalumeaux (chanters) The frontispiece in Borjon de Scellery's Trait√© (1672) shows a shepherd surrounded by a number of instruments. They include an early musette, with a single chalumeau that appears to have six finger-holes and no keys. The first full-page plate then illustrates a chalumeau with seven finger-holes and three keys, giving a range of one octave. The second full-page plate illustrates a more developed form of the musette, where a grand chalumeau with five keys is complemented by a petit chalumeau with six keys. Jacques Hotteterre's M√©thode (1738) illustrates the most usual final form of the instrument; the six-key petit chalumeau is the same as de Scellery's, but the grand chalumeau now has seven keys. The petit chalumeau, as already mentioned, was added by Martin Hotteterre; though physically connected to the grand chalumeau, and sharing the same wind-supply from the bellows, it has its own double reed and functions as a separate instrument. The lowest note on the petit chalumeau is an A flat a semi-tone below the higher A on the grand chalumeau, and keeping the two chalumeaux in tune and in balance is one of the difficulties of the instrument. Range of chalumeaux on a Hotteterre-style musette The grand chalumeau is open, so it always sounds. The petit chalumeau is closed, like the Northumbrian smallpipes, so it sounds only when a hole is opened or a key is pressed. The fingering system on both chalumeaux is \\"closed\\", meaning that (except while playing some ornaments) only one hole at a time is opened. Bourdons (drones) Following the principle of the rackett and the bassoon, the short cylinder of the musette drone contains airways that double back on themselves. Openings in each airway (the equivalent of finger-holes) are uncovered by moving layettes (sliders) fixed in four coulisses (runners). The two lowest notes use the same airway, so cannot be played together. The earliest musettes had up to nine coulisses and twelve layettes, so that you could play music in a range of modes and always have a drone using the home-note of the mode. As the chalumeaux developed and became fully chromatic, it became possible to play music in different modes but starting on the same note; fewer possible drone-notes were needed, and the bourdon was simplified. Even so, the bourdon still contains four or more separate reeds that have to be kept adjusted and in tune. Repertory The musette was an instrument both for professionals, members of ensembles and orchestras in the court or noble households, and for amateurs. As a result, the music written for the instrument ranges from simple transcriptions of popular tunes ‚Äì folk-dances in Borjon de Scellery's Trait√©, songs from current operas in Hotteterre's M√©thode ‚Äì to quite demanding pieces by the best-known composers of the day. The bulk of music written for the musette is not solo music; duos are the most popular form, followed by trio- sonatas. Much of the music available for the instrument was described as suitable for musette, hurdy-gurdy, recorder or transverse flute; or for all these plus oboe or violin. Modern editions, usually for recorder, give people the chance to discover a lot of musette music, though it needs the drone(s) to be heard as the composer intended. Composers (in alphabetical order) include B√¢ton, Boismortier, Buterne, Ch√©deville (l'Ain√© and le Cadet), Corrette, Delavigne, Hotteterre \\"le Romain\\", Naudot, and Rameau. Interest in the musette seems to have been confined almost exclusively to French composers, though the tranquil dance-form with the same name is more widespread. There are both Lyra (hurdy-gurdy) and Musette movements in Telemann orchestral suites, for example, and a Musette in the Anna Magdalena Bachb√ºchlein. The Trait√© by Borjon de Scellery, while mentioning the petit chalumeau and including it in the illustrations, concentrates on the grand chalumeau and includes [mostly] dance-tunes and popular songs in its examples. The M√©thode by Hotteterre covers the full range of the developed form of the instrument, and as well as examples taken from popular operas includes a number of original compositions designed to extend the player's skill in specific areas. Both these works also teach how to read music, de Scellery providing examples in standard notation and in musette tablature, and advice on basic maintenance. It is clear that they are expecting their readers to live in Paris or one of the largest provincial towns, where they will readily find instrument-makers and tutors to help them.

Other notable Los Angeles chains that specialize in hot dogs include Hot Dog On A Stick, which serves a preparation similar to a corn dog, and Wienerschnitzel, a chain that bills itself as \\"The World's Largest Hot Dog Chain.\\" The Farmer John Dodger Dog is sold at Dodger Stadium. Street vendors in Los Angeles also serve the \\"Downtown Dog\\" or \\"LA Street Dog\\" a Mexican- style bacon-wrapped hot dog with grilled onions, jalape√±os, and bell peppers, and mustard, ketchup, and mayonnaise as condiments. These are typically sold around closing time outside nightclubs and bars by street vendors, who grill the hot dogs on small push-carts. The legality of such operations may be questionable, leading locals to sometimes refer to these treats as \\"Danger Dogs\\". Oki Dog, in West Hollywood, or Oki's Dog, on Pico serves the Original Oki Dog‚Äîtwo hot dogs on a flour tortilla, covered with chili and pastrami and wrapped up like a burrito.

District of Columbia A half-smoke is a \\"local sausage delicacy\\" found in Washington, D.C. and the surrounding region. Similar to a hot dog, but usually larger, spicier, and with more coarsely-ground meat, the sausage is often half-pork and half-beef, smoked, and served with herbs, onion, and chili sauce. Georgia In Columbus, Georgia, a local favorite is the \\"scrambled dog,\\" the exemplar of which was first served at the Dinglewood Pharmacy by \\"The Lieutenant\\" Charles Stevens over 50 years ago. The scrambled dog is a chopped hot dog covered by chili, onions and pickles with an accompanying portion of oyster crackers. In Fitzgerald, Georgia, Johnnie's Drive In served the \\"scrambled dog\\" beginning in the early 1940s. Johnnie's scrambled dog is two sliced hot dogs over a hot dog bun with mustard and catsup and covered with oyster crackers, chili, cole slaw, and sliced dill pickles. Illinois A Chicago-style hot dog The Chicago-style hot dog is a steamed kosher-style all-beef, natural-casing hot dog on a steamed poppy seed bun, topped with yellow mustard, chopped white onions, a dill pickle spear, tomato slices, Chicago-style relish, hot sport peppers, and a dash of celery salt. Chicago-style hot dogs do not include ketchup. This \\"dragged through the garden\\" style (more commonly called, \\"with the works\\"), is heavily promoted by Vienna Beef and Red Hot Chicago, the two most prominent Chicago hot dog manufacturers, but exceptions are common, with vendors adding cucumbers or lettuce, omitting poppy seeds or celery salt, or using plain relish or a skinless hot dog. Several popular hot dog stands serve a simpler version: a steamed natural-casing dog with only mustard, onions, plain relish and sport peppers, wrapped up with hand-cut fries, while the historic Superdawg drive-ins notably substitute a pickled tomato. Kansas and Missouri A Kansas City-style hot dog is a pork sausage in a sesame seed bun topped with brown mustard, sauerkraut and melted Swiss cheese.

Michigan In southeastern Michigan, restaurants serve what's known as a Coney dog, developed early in the 20th century by Greek immigrants. \\"Coney joints\\" are very specific as to the ingredients: a beef or beef and pork European-style Vienna sausage of German origin in a natural lamb or sheep casing, topped with a spiced sauce made with ground beef heart, one or two stripes of yellow mustard and diced or chopped white onions. There are three variations on the Coney dog: Jackson style, which started in 1914 with a ground beef sauce prior to switching to ground beef heart in the early 1940s, Detroit style, first served in 1917 and made with a more soupy beef heart-based sauce, and Flint style, with Flint Coney Island opening in 1924 serving a specially-developed Koegel's coney topped with thicker, meatier sauce based on a Macedonian goulash, made almost entirely of a finely ground beef heart blend from Abbott's Meat.Florine, Bob; Davison, Matt; Jaeger, Sally, Two To Go: A Short History of Flint's Coney Island Restaurants, 2007, Genesee County Historical Society With over 350 chain and independent purveyors of these dogs in the metro-Detroit area alone, an entire restaurant industry has developed from the hot dog and are called Coney Islands. A coney dog is not to be confused with a chili dog, a more generic ground beef-based chili-topped hot dog. New Jersey New Jersey's Italian hot dog includes diced fried potatoes combined with brown mustard served on a spicy hot dog. The most common brands of spicy hot dogs used are Sabrett's or Best's, both of which are NJ companies. A traditional Italian Hot Dog is made by cutting a round \\"pizza bread\\" in half (for a double) or into quarters (for a single), cutting a pocket into it and spreading the inside with mustard. A deep-fried dog (or two if it is a double) is put in the pocket, topped with fried (or saut√©ed) onions and peppers, and then topped off with crisp-fried potato chunks. A variation of this, often found at express takeout restaurants (such as \\"chicken shacks,\\" Chinese restaurants, pizzerias, etc., and can also be requested at some lunch trucks and luncheonettes across the state) substitutes French fries for the traditional potato round, and in some spots a Portuguese or sub roll replaces the traditional round bread used. Rutt's Hut in Clifton, NJ is famed for its rippers, hot dogs deep-fried to the point where the sausages burst open, resulting in a dense, caramelized outer casing. The rippers are served with Rutt's homemade relish, a blend of mustard, onions, carrots and cabbage. The Texas wiener was created in Paterson, New Jersey sometime before 1920. The \\"Texas\\" reference is to the chili sauce used on the dogs, which actually has a stronger Greek influence due to the ethnicity of the cooks who invented it. The wiener, also referred to as an all-the-way dog, consists of a hot dog covered in D√ºsseldorf mustard (as opposed to the Coney, which uses yellow mustard), diced onions, and chili sauce. New York A typical kosher hot dog stand in New York City, with an illustration of hot dogs typical to the area In New York City, the natural-casing all-beef hot dogs served at Katz's Delicatessen, Gray's Papaya, Papaya King, Papaya Dog and any Sabrett cart are all made by Sabrett's parent company, Marathon Enterprises, Inc.. . Nathan's hot dogs, which are all-beef and come in both natural-casing and skinless, were also made by Marathon until several years ago . Local kosher brands‚Äîwhich are not permitted natural casings‚Äîinclude Hebrew National, Empire National . The usual condiments are mustard and sauerkraut, with optional sweet onions in a tomato based sauce invented by Alan Geisler, usually made by Sabrett. Hot dogs are available on street corners as well as at delicatessens. New York street vendors generally store their unsold dogs in warm-water baths, giving rise to the semi-affectionate moniker \\"dirty water dog.\\" Bagel dogs are also sold in Manhattan. The white hot or \\"porker\\" is a variation on the hot dog found mostly in the Rochester area. It is composed of some combination of uncured and unsmoked pork, beef, and veal; it is believed that the lack of smoking or curing allows the meat to retain a naturally white color. White hots are almost exclusively eaten with mustard, specifically spicy brown, and other spices, and often include a dairy component such as nonfat dry milk. In the Capital District surrounding Albany, smaller-than-usual wieners are served with a spicy meat sauce; the Capital District style is quite similar to the New York System or Hot Wieners of Rhode Island. In the mid-twentieth century, hot dog purveyors reportedly would carry the dogs to the table lined up on their bare forearms, giving rise to the term \\"the Hairy Arm\\"; today, health codes prohibit this practice. Further north, in three locations in and around Glens Falls, New Way Lunch has served similar hot dogs with meat sauce, mustard, and raw onions for nearly 100 years. Buffalo, Rochester and Western New York state are known for charcoal-broiled hot dogs, cooked over real hardwood charcoal. Prominent purveyors include Ted's and Louie's. Texas hots have a niche following in western New York, where the Rigas family (later of Adelphia Communications infamy) introduced the dish. A 2017 article in the Olean Times Herald made note of the dish's disappearance from the city of Olean.State & Union. Whither the Texas hot? Olean Times Herald.

Variations exist for the preparation of the sausage or hot dog, whether it is grilled or fried. Another Cleveland favorite found at any north-eastern Ohio sporting or entertainment venues, is a hot dog with \\"Stadium Mustard\\". Stadium Mustard is a type of Brown mustard with similar flavor to a spicy Dijon mustard. Toledo is known for Tony Packo's Cafe. Their \\"Hungarian hot dog\\" is technically a Hungarian sausage called Kolb√°sz, not unlike the Polish kielbasa, is about twice the diameter of a conventional hot dog, and is sliced in half before being grilled and topped with the restaurant's spicy chili sauce.

Softcams are computer software (that technically do not replace webcams) that allows one to stream or broadcast image, video, and/or audio files through a virtual webcam device. This allows the video stream to be used in place of a normal webcam stream in video conferencing applications like MSN Messenger, NetMeeting, Skype etc. or any other programs that use webcam devices. Some softcam software such as Magic Camera and ManyCam allows the user to apply graphics and effects to the video as well, making the software more analogous to a video switcher. In effect, softcam software allows the user to project media files as though it were live over a webcam. Video from normal webcams can also be passed through softcam software to allow the same graphics and effects to be overlaid onto normal webcam video.  History  The historical origins of softcam type software is unclear, but image sensor emulation may have been used by the US and USSR space programs as part of camera integration on spacecraft. In the modern era, physical teleconferencing systems (as opposed to ones dependent on a personal computer) may have been tested with softcam technology in the late 1980s. As softcam software evolved in parallel with digital camera software, one can consider softcam history and webcam history to be the same.  Risks  Having multiple webcam emulators installed on a personal computer may increase the risk of Camfecting. In the field of computer security, camfecting is the process of attempting to hack into a person's webcam and activate it without the owner's permission. Remotely activated webcams can be used to watch anything within the webcam's field of vision, sometimes including the webcam owner themselves. Camfecting is most often carried out by infecting the victim's computer with a virus that can provide the hacker access to the webcam. This attack is specifically targeted at the victim's webcam, and hence the name camfecting, a portmanteau of the words cam and infecting. Typically, a webcam hacker or a camfecter sends his victim an innocent-looking application which has a Trojan horse software through which the camfecter can control the victim's webcam. The camfecter virus installs itself silently when the victim runs the original application. Once installed, the camfecter can turn on the webcam and capture pictures/videos. The camfecter software works just like the original webcam software present in the computer, the only difference being that the camfecter controls the software instead of the webcam owner.

On 8 March, having upgraded to a Sopwith Dolphin fighter plane, Bryson scored his final victory of the war, destroying a German Albatros D.V over Gheluvelt, Belgium. His final summary showed he had destroyed four enemy aircraft; two of these were shared victories, including one with Arthur Bradfield Fairclough. Bryson's other eight wins were of the out of control variety; three of them were shared with such other aces as Albert Desbrisay Carter.

A primary producer converts an abiotic source of energy (e.g. light) into energy stored in organic compounds, which can be used by other organisms (e.g. heterotrophs). The primary producers can convert the energy in the light (phototroph and photoautotroph) or the energy in inorganic chemical compounds (chemolithotrophs) to build organic molecules, which is usually accumulated in the form of biomass and will be used as carbon and energy source by other organisms (e.g. heterotrophs and mixotrophs). The photoautotrophs are the main primary producers, converting the energy of the light into chemical energy through photosynthesis, ultimately building organic molecules from carbon dioxide, an inorganic carbon source. Examples of chemolithotrophs are some archaea and bacteria (unicellular organisms) that produce biomass from the oxidation of inorganic chemical compounds, these organisms are called chemoautotrophs, and are frequently found in hydrothermal vents in the deep ocean. Primary producers are at the lowest trophic level, and are the reasons why Earth is sustainable for life to this day.  Examples  There are many different types of primary producers out in the Earth's ecosystem at different states. Fungi and other organisms that gain their biomass from oxidizing organic materials are called decomposers and are not primary producers. However, lichens located in tundra climates are an exceptional example of a primary producer that, by mutualistic symbiosis, combine photosynthesis by algae (or additionally nitrogen fixation by cyanobacteria) with the protection of a decomposer fungus. Also, plant-like primary producers (trees, algae) use the sun as a form of energy and put it into the air for other organisms. There are of course H2O primary producers, including a form of bacteria, and phytoplankton. As there are many examples of primary producers, two dominant types are coral and one of the many types of brown algae, kelp.  Photosynthesis  Gross primary production occurs by photosynthesis. This is also a main way that primary producers take energy and produce/release it somewhere else. Plants, coral, bacteria, and algae do this. Bacteria is a more recent find in the process of photosynthesis with primary producers, as they were just discovered in the soil. During photosynthesis, primary producers take energy from the sun and produce it into energy, sugar, and oxygen. Primary producers also need energy to convert this same energy elsewhere, so they get it from nutrients. One type of nutrient is nitrogen.  Importance of primary producers  Without primary producers, organisms that are capable of producing energy on their own, the Earth would be unable to sustain itself. Plants, along with other primary producers, produce the energy that beings consume, and the oxygen that they breathe. It is thought that the first organisms on Earth were primary producers located on the ocean floor.  Primary production in tropical streams and rivers Aquatic algae are a significant contributor to food webs in tropical rivers and streams. This is displayed by net primary production, a fundamental ecological process that reflects the amount of carbon that is synthesized within an ecosystem. This carbon ultimately becomes available to consumers. Net primary production displays that the rates of in-stream primary production in tropical regions are at least an order of magnitude greater than similar temperate systems.

A member of the Siemens family, he became associated with Siemens & Halske AG in 1899, his family company. He was responsible for the resurrection of the Siemens Group after the First World War. Before his death in 1941, he oversaw state railways for the Reichstag. Biography Carl Friedrich von Siemens (right) with Wilhelm Cuno, director of the Hapag shipping company and former Chancellor of Germany, on their way to New York in 1931 Carl Friedrich von Siemens was born 5 September 1872 in Berlin. Carl Friedrich is the youngest son of Werner von Siemens by his second wife and relative Antonie Siemens and nephew of Carl Siemens and William Siemens. In 1899, Carl Friedrich von Siemens joined the Siemens & Halske AG which was founded by his father and was then led by his elder brothers (today Siemens AG). From 1901 to 1908, Siemens was a director of the British filial Siemens Brothers & Co in London and Siemens Brothers Dynamo Works in Stafford. From 1908 to 1912 he established and led the so- called √úbersee-Abteilung which was responsible for the company‚Äôs activities abroad. He became CEO of the Siemens-Schuckertwerke in Berlin in 1912 and chairman of the supervisory board of both Siemens-Schuckertwerke and Siemens & Halske AG in 1919. In this position he was responsible for the resurrection of the Siemens Group after the First World War. Upon his death in 1941 he was succeeded in both chairmanships by his late brother Arnold von Siemens' eldest son Hermann von Siemens. Apart from his business activities, Carl Friedrich von Siemens was engaged in several organisations. From 1920 to 1924 he was member of the Reichstag for the Deutsche Demokratische Partei. From 1924 to 1934 Siemens was chairman of the administrative board of the German State Railways (Deutsche Reichsbahn-Gesellschaft). He died 9 September 1941 in Heinendorf near Potsdam.

He was born in the village Ferentinata, near Antypata Pylarou, in Kefalonia, the eldest son of Spyros Antypas and Angelina Klada. He had two siblings, Babis and Adelais.

He participated as a voluntary soldier in the Cretan Revolt of 1897‚Äì1898, during which he was injured. On account of his later criticism of the role of the Greek monarchy in the insurrection, he was imprisoned and exiled to the island of Aegina. An order from the Ministry of Justice declared: \\"Antypas should be placed in isolation and no one should talk to him. If he doesn't comply with this he should be confined to his cell and be served food without salt\\". In 1900 he returned to Kefalonia, where he published the journal Anastasi, which was closed down by the authorities because of its content. In the same period he worked with his father, a carpenter but also a wood sculptor (one of his works is preserved in the Church of Saint Gregory in Hamolako Pilarou). At that time he was the Godparent of two girls, naming one Anarchia (Anarchy) and the other Epanastasi (Revolution). He also established the \\"People's Reading Place\\" () \\"Equality\\" which became the centre of political and spiritual debate on the island. In 1903 he visited his uncle Gerasimos Skiadaresis in Bucharest and convinced him to buy farming land in Greece. Antypas returned again to Kefalonia and republished his Anastasi newspaper, for which he was arrested but found innocent in the following trial. His Socialist Radical party participated in the 1906 general election, but won few votes. After that he left for Pyrgetos (Larissa regional unit) where his uncle had bought a large estate. There he began to agitate over the rights of farmers. One of his suggestions was that the farmers should not work on Sundays but use that day to take their children to school. His teachings were received positively by the farmers but the owners of the agrarian estates disliked him. They paid 30,000 drachmas to a supervisor named Kyriakou to kill Antypas, which he did on March 8, 1907. His killer was never brought to justice for the crime. After the death of his nephew, Skiadaresis sold his estates and left the area.

The tattlers are unique among the species of Tringa for having unpatterned, greyish wings and backs, and a scaly breast pattern extending more or less onto the belly in breeding plumage, in which both also have a rather prominent supercilium. Wandering tattler on Great Barrier Reef in Queensland, Australia These birds have stocky bodies with gray upperparts, underwings, face and neck and a white belly. They have short dark yellow legs and a dark gray bill. Adults in breeding plumage are heavily barred underneath. In summer, they are found in far-eastern Russia, Alaska, portions of the California coast and northwestern Canada. They nest in rocky areas along mountain streams. At other times, they are found on rocky islands in the southwest Pacific and on rocky Pacific coasts from California to South America and as far as Australia. They feed on aquatic invertebrates such as crustaceans and marine worms. During breeding season, they also eat insects. While wading, they forage actively, making jerky bobbing movements. Feeding behaviors can include repeated returns to the same location over short periods of time. They can be seen flying low over a rocky coastline or along a jetty. The female lays 4 olive-colored eggs in a shallow depression. Both parents incubate and help feed the young, who are soon able to forage for themselves. The call is a rapid trill of accelerating, descending notes of decreasing volume.

Sac3 phosphatase activity in the PAS complex also plays an important role in regulating PtdIns(3,5)P2 levels and maintaining endomembrane homeostasis. Thus, cytoplasmic vacuolation induced by the dominant-negative PIKfyveK1831E mutant is suppressed upon co-expression of a Sac3 phosphatase- inactive point-mutant along with ArPIKfyve. In vitro reconstitution assays of endosome fusion and multivesicular body (MVB) formation/detachment (fission) suggest a positive role of PtdIns(3,5)P2 in MVB fission from maturing early endosomes and a negative role in endosome fusion.

The fact that the heterozygous PIKfyve mice are ostensibly normal and live to late adulthood with only ~60% of the wild-type PtdIns(3,5)P2 levels suggests that PtdIns(3,5)P2 might normally be in excess. ArPIKfyve/Vac14 or Sac3/Fig4 knockout in mice results in a 30-50% decrease in PtdIns(3,5)P2 levels and cause similar massive central neurodegeneration and peripheral neuropathy. These studies suggest that reduced PtdIns(3,5)P2 levels, by a yet-to-be identified mechanism, mediate neuronal death. In contrast, MTMR2 phosphatase knockout, which also causes peripheral neuropathy, is accompanied by elevation in PtdIns(3,5)P2.

Thus, whether and how the abnormal levels of PtdIns(3,5)P2 selectively affect peripheral neuronal functions remains unclear.  Effectors  Phosphoinositides are generally viewed as membrane-anchored signals recruiting specific cytosolic effector proteins. So far, several proteins have been proposed as potential PtdIns(3,5)P2 effectors. Unfortunately, the expectations that such effectors would be evolutionary conserved and share a common PtdIns(3,5)P2-binding motif of high affinity remain unfulfilled. For example, deletion of Atg18p, a protein involved also in autophagy in S. cerevisae, causes enlarged vacuole and 10-fold elevation in PtdIns(3,5)P2. Atg18p binds PtdIns(3,5)P2 with high affinity and specificity. Dove SK, Piper RC, McEwen RK, Yu JW, King MC, Hughes DC, Thuring J, Holmes AB, Cooke FT, Michell RH, Parker PJ, Lemmon MA.

Origins The words, rules and tune for \\"Here we go gathering nuts in May\\" Here we are gathering nuts in May; by Elizabeth Adela Forbes The words and rules of the game were first quoted in the Folk-Lore Record for 1881,Evelyn Carrington, \\"Singing Games\\", Folk-Lore Record 3.2 (London, 1881), p. 170 followed in 1882 by a similar description among the games for choosing partners in G. F. Northall's English Folk-rhymes.English Folk-rhymes, a collection of traditional verses relating to places and persons, customs, superstitions (London, 1882), pp. 385-6 The first of these described the game as played among girls, while Northall says that a girl and a boy are partnered between the participating teams. There are mixed teams also in the description given in Emmeline M. Plunket's Merry Games in Rhyme (London, 1886), which also supplies the music to the words.George A. Smathers Libraries, pp. 42-3 Although the rhyme was also known in the U.S. at the same period, it is described as \\"probably a recent importation from England‚Äù in William Wells Newell‚Äôs Games and Songs of American Children (New York, 1884).Newell, W.

Sutton-Smith, \\"Traditional Games of New Zealand Children\\", Folklore 64.3 (Sep., 1953) pp.411-423 One of the most comprehensive considerations given the game was by Alice Gomme, who collected variant versions from around Britain in her The Traditional Games of England, Scotland and Ireland (1894-8)Gutenberg Files, Vol.1, pp. 424-33 and speculated on the origin of the game. What is supposed to be gathered is particularly questionable, since nuts do not mature in the spring. Gomme‚Äôs preference for the original wording is \\"knots (flower posies) of may\\" blossom (in which she follows Northall's suggestions) and refers the game to former May Day ceremonies, which took place early in the morning. The alternative lines \\"On a fine summer‚Äôs morning\\" and \\"So early in the morning\\", as well as Newell's \\"On a May morning early\\", all in place of \\"On a cold and frosty morning\\", seem to suggest this. Robert Herrick‚Äôs poem \\"Corinna‚Äôs going a‚Äô Maying\\", with its references to gathering white-thorn blossom and choosing a marriage partner,The Oxford Book of English Verse;Poem 248 describes 17th-century rural customs that might lie at the base of what eventually has become a childhood game. But Gomme pointed out that the pairing that went on then was often less than innocent, a connection hinted at in the more modern drinking song, ::I took to gathering nuts in May, nuts in May, nuts in May, ::Down by the old mill stream. ::But instead of gathering nuts in May, ::I put her in a family way, ::Down by the old mill stream.Mudcat Caf√© See also The bibliography at the Traditional Ballad Index References Category:Singing games Category:Roud Folk Song Index songs Category:Year of song unknown ","title":"Nuts in May (rhyme)"},{"id":"4443042","text":"Rudolf Gr√ºttner (born 5 March 1933) is a German stamp designer and graphic designer.

Most Jola live in small villages scattered throughout Senegal, especially in the Lower Casamance region. The main dialect of the Jola language, Fogni, is one of the six national languages of Senegal. Their economy has been based on wet rice cultivation for at least one thousand years. This system has been characterized \\"one of the most significant examples of 'agrarian civilizations' in West Africa\\". However, the Jola probably reached the Lower Casamance region in the 14th century, assimilating the previous Bainuk people and their rice tradition. In colonial times, the Jola began to cultivate peanuts as a cash crop in the drier forests. Other activities include palm wine tapping, honey collecting, livestock rearing and the production of oher crops such as sweet potatoes, yams and watermelon.Stride, G. T.; Ifeka, Caroline , \\"Peoples and empires of West Africa: West Africa in history, 1000-1800\\", Africana Pub. Corp., 1971, p. 6. The traditional religion of the Jola is animism, which is practised through fetishistic rituals and ceremonies. However, the Jola populations living in well-connected areas have become Islamized due to the influence of the nearby Mandinka people. As a result, many Jola no longer speak their own language and more than half are now Muslims. Unlike the dominant cultures of West Africa, most Jola communities lack any social or political stratification, being organized into families or neighborhoods. However, some communities have a central authority, a King, whose role resembles more that of a priest than of a traditional secular leader. The most prominent Jola Kingdom is in Oussouye. Among the Muslim Jola, there is also the Marabout, a religious leader and teacher. Traditional animist rituals are overseen by elders, who have an important role in Jola society. For Jola boys to attain manhood, they must take part in the initiation festival known as futamp, which takes place every 15 to 20 years in every Jola village. Name The word 'Jola' is the Mandinka name for this ethnic group and means 'payback', since Jolas are renowned for doing back what's been done to them, be it a good or a bad deed. The name of the Jola tribe in their own language is Ajamat (singular) or Ajamataw (plural). 'Diola' is the traditional transliteration in French, which is also very common in English sources. Language and subgroups The Jola speak the Jola language, which is divided into a variety of dialects which may not, at times, be mutually intelligible. These dialects correspond to the different Jola tribes: * Banjaal spoken in a small area south of the Casamance River. * Bayot spoken around Ziguinchor. * KuDiola spoken in a handful of villages south of Oussouye. * Fogni (Kujamaat) spoken around Bignona. * Gusilay spoken in the village of Thionck Essyl. * Karon spoken along the coast of Casamance south of Diouloulou. * Kasa spoken around Oussouye. * Kuwaataay spoken along the coast south of the Casamance River. * Mlomp spoken in the village of Mlomp. Religion Most Jolas continue to follow their traditional religion and rituals in spite of the influence of Islam and Christianity in recent times. Even though some accepted Islam after the Soninke-Marabout war, they honour the traditional use of palm wine in their rituals.Gambian Jola scholar Daniel Laemouahuma Jatta They have one God that they associate with the natural phenomena like sky, rain, and the year, Emit or Ata Emit, literally, \\"To Whom Belongs The Universe\\" or \\"The Master-Owner Of The Universe\\".See article J. David Sapir They have charms and sacred precincts that they honour and with which they communicate (but do not worship). The Jola people believe that spirits called Bakin or Eneerti (Mandinka Jalang) can protect their families, their villages, and their rice fields; and can even protect them from conversion to Islam and Christianity. Before the influence of Islam and Christianity in their ways of beliefs, all Jolas placed great respect in the proper observation of funeral ceremony, and still today some do, for they are of the belief that it enables the dead person's soul to go to its final destination to join his or her ancestors. It was and still is strongly accepted by those Jolas who still practice their ancestral religion that without performing these funeral sacred rites, the soul is prevented from entering the presence of the creator (Ata Amit), and the ancestors. Jolas believed strongly in living a good humanistic life in this world. They believe that if one lives a bad life in this world, when the person dies the soul of the dead person is punished to become an exile spirit with no bed to lie on. In the Jola Cassa subgroup this exile spirit is called a Holowa. This exile spirit becomes a roaming spirit with no respect from the other spirits. Some Jola religious festivals include the Samay, Kumpo and Niasse. Culture Jola village Diola Unlike most ethnic groups of the Senegambian region, the Jola do not have caste system of Jewels griots, slaves, nobility, leather workers, etc. Their communities are based on extended clan settlements normally large enough to be given independent names, including the Jola Karon, Jola Mlomp, Jola Elinnkin, Jola Caginol, Jola Huluf, Jola Jamat, Jola Joheyt, Jola Bayot, Jola Brin, Jola Seleky, Jola Kabrouse, Jola Jiwat, and Jola Foni.Patience Sonko-Godwin, Ethnic groups of the Senegambia Region, Banjul, Gambia 1986 ,Ethnic Groups of the Gambia: A Brief History (1988),quoted by Daniel Laemouahuma Jatta Jolas are also able herbal medicine practitioners. Their high adaptation to the nature and environment allowed them to be able to create musical centred civilisation, natural medicine centred civilisation, and most important of all, rice cultivation centred civilisation which they do effectively by using a locally made farming tool called the kajando. Like some of the other the indigenous ethnic groups of the Senegambian region‚Äîthe Baga, the Balanta, the Konyagi, etc.‚Äî, the Jola ethnic group did not develop a political scale that expanded beyond village level compared to ethnic groups that migrated to the region like the Sonike and the Mandinka. But this does not mean they did not develop a sophisticated political system. The egalitarian nature of their societies (rare in most societies), structured around the limited village environment gave them the possibilities to develop a political system based on collective consciousness, which they worked through their initiation rites. In a sense the Jolas' political achievement in the village was socialism. It was totally tied to their religious belief in the Bakin. This political achievement is not easy to reach if the society that runs it does not have well-defined rules of administration and penalties. Jolas have many traditional economic activities like fishing, farming groundnuts, tapping palm wine, and processing palm oil: their most intensive economic activity is rice cultivation, which is tied closely to their religion and social organization. Jolas are also palm oil manufacturers and palm wine tappers in the Senegambian region. They farm cows, pigs, goats, chickens, sheep and ducks. Jola crafts include basket weaving, pottery, and building.Daniel Laemouahuma Jatta Elders are considered very important in Jola society and are believed to possess occult powers and guard societal traditions. In villages, a council of elders make many of the daily decisions for the community and exert much influence. Despite the patriarchal nature of Jola society, many women played major roles in the community and were often members in village councils, religious leaders, and landowners. Women are also important as cultivators of wet rice fields in which they predominated. Polygamy and genital mutilation are not practiced by the Jola although outside influence has made these more common in certain villages. MusicEkonting= Ekonting The ekonting is a three-string gourd instrument, the folk lute of the Jola people. It has an internal pass through body dowel stick with a round gourd body and its sound box is made of a hemispherical calabash, with a nailed goatskin. Before the invention of nails, palm tree thorns or wood pegs were used as nails. The three strings, which are attached to a long neck, today are nylon fishing line. Before, they were made of palm tree roots (Jola language: kuhall kata kubekel). The neck is a bamboo stick (Mandinka language: bangoe) that passes through the calabash to the other side. A hole is made in the sound box to allow the sound to escape. The bridge of the ekonting is not fixed to its skin as many lutes are. It is free, and can be moved back and forth on the skin of the sound box and it is always held in position by the pressure of the strings when it is in playing position. =Galire= The galire is a one-string instrument of the Jola of Thionck- Essyl, with its strings stretched across a single 1 meter curve made of fine mangrove wood. At first sight, it looks like a hunter's bow. It's played with one hand holding a flexible fine string (made of palm leaves) beating on the arc's string, while the other hand holds one end of the arc and adjusts the tune with the thumb. The other end of the arc rests in the mouth of the player, who sings. The vibration from the player's song on the string of the arc and the beating with the fine flexible string leads to the pleasant and characteristic sound of the galire. The exile of young people to cities has led to the stark decline in usage of this traditional instrument among the Jola people of Casamance and the Gambia. =Other musical instruments= Below is a list of few Jola instruments. Note: The Jola language of Thionck Essyl is used to name them. Their names may differ somewhat in other villages' languages. * Bakiti: like two maracas without the handle attached with one cord * Bougarabou * Ediando: used by the women during initiation dances * Efemme: a calebasse reversed in a container full of water.

Slave trade and Jola diaspora In the mid-1440s the diverse folk population of the Senegambian region faced violent disintegration of its people, and their rich diverse cultures, by the Portuguese, the first Europeans who set out to seek slaves in Africa to sell to the New World. These Europeans came by medium size boats that they used to navigate both the Gambian river and the Casamance rivers, since there were no infrastructures at this time to travel by land, invaded and took them to work in Spain and in Portugal. Later in the sixteenth century, when these European realized that they could make enormous profit by using the labour of the Africans to exploit the wealth of the Americas they started selling the African slaves to North America, Central America, South America, and the Caribbean countries to provide slave labour in the gold and silver mines and on the agricultural plantations, growing crops such as sugar, cotton, rice, and tobacco. From 1445 to 1600 about one million Africans were taken from the West African region, particularly from the Senegambian region. The ethnic groups that suffered most during this slave aggression were those living along the coastal areas of the river Gambia and the river Cassamance, and these are the Manjagos, the Balantas, the Papels and the Jolas. There is still a very old saying among the elderly Jolas that the music of the Akonting in its initial stage was so sweet to the devils that the most outstanding Jola Akonting players who played late at night in the rice fields when work was suspended for the day and it was time to play the Akonting and dance and drink their palm wine until they got tired and then came home, that most of these Akonting players did not come home. On the following day when the people went out to search for them they saw prints of shoes on the ground which they associated with feet of devils because in those days Jolas didn't use shoes or know what shoes looked like. This is how the Jola Ekonting came to the Americas. Notable Jola people * , architectural engineer in Senegal. * Jules Francois Bocand√©, former Senegalese international football striker.

New York Academy of Sciences, Life and career Horace Freeland Judson was born on 21 April 1931, in Manhattan, New York. He contracted polio at the age of 13, and the disease left him with a withered right arm. Judson matriculated at the University of Chicago at age 15 and graduated with a bachelor's degree in 1948,American Philosophical Society and worked for seven years for Time magazine as a European correspondent in London and Paris. He subsequently wrote for The New Yorker, Harper's, and Nature among others. Judson spent nine years on the faculty of Johns Hopkins University and then four years as a research scholar at Stanford University. He was the director of the now defunct Center for History of Recent Science and Research Professor of History at George Washington University. In 1987 Judson was awarded a MacArthur Fellowship. The Eighth Day of Creation arose out of Judson's acquaintance with Max Perutz; In 1968 came the idea of a book about the discovery of the structures of cellular macromolecules. Following a discussion with Jacques Monod in 1969, Judson expanded his planned book to a general history of molecular biology. The result is based on interviews of over 100 scientists, cross-checked and re-interviewed over a period of seven years.Judson, H. F. The Eighth Day of Creation (1979), p. 10‚Äì11 The book was partially serialized in three issues of The New Yorker in November and December 1978. Following the publication of the book, Judson deposited the tapes and transcripts of the interviews at the American Philosophical Society in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He appears in Dont Look Back, D. A. Pennebaker's documentary film about Bob Dylan, in which he is subjected to what he believed to be a contrived tirade of abuse from Dylan. During Judson's interview, Dylan launches into a verbal attack on Time magazine, and Judson himself. The film's producer Pennebaker does not believe the tirade was planned, but notes that Dylan backed off, not wanting to come across as being too cruel. However, Judson believed the confrontation was contrived to make the sequence more entertaining. \\"That evening\\", said Judson, \\"I went to the concert. My opinion then and now was that the music was unpleasant, the lyrics inflated, and Dylan, a self-indulgent whining show off\\". Personal life  Judson's first marriage ended in divorce. His second wife, Penelope Jones, died in 1993. Horace Freeland Judson's oldest daughter, Grace Judson,Grace Judson is a small-business coach and writer in San Diego. After her successful 25-year corporate career, she won the title of Fastest Knitter in America in 2002, appearing on Good Morning America in October of that year. His younger daughter, Olivia Judson, is a science journalist and currently a research fellow as an evolutionary biologist at Imperial College London and is the author of the best-selling Dr. Tatiana's Sex Advice to All Creation. His younger son, Nicholas Judson,Nicholas Judson was a scientist at the J. Craig Venter Institute (Rockville, MD), but left science to pursue a new career as a self-employed artist.

Education Carleton was born in Bowral, New South Wales. He was educated at Sydney Grammar School and graduated from the University of New South Wales. He was the third of four children - Joffre, Graeme, Richard and Joanne. Television/journalism career=ABC/BBC In the 1960s he was a reporter on This Day Tonight as well as being the presenter of ‚ÄòState of the Nation‚Äô, both on the ABC. He continued these roles until he left for a role on 2GB Radio in 1976, followed by what began as a lifelong love of travelling and researching overseas, producing films in Indonesia (including being the only journalist to be allowed to visit the newly \\"integrated\\" East Timor) and the Middle East. Carleton joined the BBC in London in 1977 for the Tonight program, before returning to Australia in 1979. Carleton is probably most famously known for a comment made to the incoming federal Australian Labor Party leader Bob Hawke in 1983: \\"Mr. Hawke, could I ask you whether you feel a little embarrassed tonight at the blood that's on your hands?\\" which was a reference to the alleged involvement of Hawke in the resignation of former Labor leader, Bill Hayden. The question outraged Hawke, who criticized Carleton for his \\"damned impertinence\\". Carleton ran for election in 1983 as the staff representative on the ABC Board. He was defeated by Tom Molomby, who wrote: \\"His was a remarkable policy statement, the most blatant demonstration of political cynicism (I cannot believe it was the only other alternative, stupidity) which I have ever seen in an ABC election.\\".Molomby, Tom, Is there a moderate on the roof? ABC Years, William Heinemann Australia, Port Melbourne, 1991, p.163 During 1986, Carleton was a co-presenter of The Carleton-Walsh Report on the ABC, with financial journalist Max Walsh. Nine Network In 1987 Carleton began his most famous television journalism role, as a reporter on 60 Minutes. In a career with the program that spanned almost 20 years, he visited many locations around the world investigating political climates. In 2006 he and producer Stephen Rice visited Chernobyl and were given unprecedented access to the sarcophagus built over the ruined nuclear reactor, including a brief visit to the abandoned control room. Carleton was parodied on the Australian sketch- comedy shows Fast Forward and Comedy Inc. for his perceived over-prominence on 60 Minutes. In July 2000, the ABC's Media Watch program accused Carleton of plagiarizing the BBC documentary A Cry from the Grave. Carleton denied the claims, suing the Australian Broadcasting Corporation for defamation. In 2002 the case was heard and the judge found that while Carleton had \\"misled his audience by misrepresenting a mass grave site shown in the program, and that 60 Minutes had copied film directly from the British documentary\\", the allegations made by Media Watch were in fact untrue and had defamed Carleton. Carleton was greatly relieved by the ruling. (However the judge also found Media Watch was entitled to express the views it formed and eventually awarded costs against Channel Nine and to the ABC.). Media Watch themselves claimed that Carleton had interpreted the judgement as favoring him, that it didn't, and they refused to apologise.\\"Carleton fails to win defamation damages\\" 18 December 2002 Sydney Morning Herald https://www.smh.com.au/national/carleton- fails-to-win-defamation-damages-20021218-gdfzj8.html Carleton won five Penguin Awards and three Logie Awards during his time with 60 Minutes and at the ABC. Death Carleton had experienced a number of health scares, the first in 1988 when he underwent heart bypass surgery, which was filmed for 60 Minutes, and another in 2003 when he suffered a heart attack. In 2005 he was diagnosed with prostate cancer. On 7 May 2006, Carleton collapsed from a massive heart attack during a press conference at the Beaconsfield gold mine, shortly after questioning mine manager Matthew Gill on previous safety issues at the site. First-hand reports from the scene indicated that Carleton had a weak pulse when taken by ambulance to the Launceston General Hospital and that he had been puffing and gasping not long before he collapsed.

(15 February 1534 - 11 October 1592) was an Italian priest who is called the \\"Apostle of Corsica\\". He is a saint of the Roman Catholic Church. In 1571, he was appointed by Pius V to the ancient see of Aleria, Corsica, where he rebuilt churches, founded colleges and seminaries, and, despite the depredations of corsairs, placed the Church in a flourishing condition. In 1591, he was made Bishop of Pavia, and died at Calozza the following year. He left a number of works, chiefly catechetical. He was beatified by Benedict XIV, 23 April 1742, and canonized by Pope Pius X, 11 December 1904. His feast is celebrated on October 11.Alexander Sauli Early life Sauli was born in Milan, on February 15, 1534, to an illustrious Lombard family. His parents were Dominic and Tommasina Spinola Sauli. His father was Marquis of Pozzuolo in the territory of Tortona and an assistant to Duke Francesco II Sforza. The marquis was esteemed by the emperor, who was then president of the High Court of Milan. Both of his parents were from ancient and noble families of Genoa. This social status offered Alexander a great opportunity for a prestigious and brilliant career. He was well-educated at Pavia. In 1551, at the age of 17, Sauli became a page at the court of Emperor Charles V in Milan.\\"St. Alexander Sauli\\", Christ in the Desert Monastery Religious formation Sauli carrying a cross through the streets of Milan. At the age of seventeen, Alexander asked to be admitted to the Congregation of the Barnabites.\\"Saint Alexander Sauli\\", Barnabite Fathers USA At this time the Congregation was experiencing the precariousness of its beginnings, extreme poverty, and harsh trials. It had been expelled from the Republic of Venice only two months before. The Fathers advised Alexander to consider other religious congregations, such as the Dominicans, the Franciscans, and the Capuchins, rich with members outstanding in holiness and wisdom. On Saturday, 17 May 1551, the Vigil of Pentecost, the Barnabites asked young Sauli to carry a large cross through the streets of Milan, dressed as an imperial page, and to preach in public about the love for God and the renunciation of the world. This would give them an indication whether or not his choice was authentic. With the heavy cross on his shoulders, he crossed the city. When he reached the square called Piazza dei Mercanti, he asked a vendor for his stand. He erected the cross on it, and with great fervor he addressed the crowd about the worship of God and the love of neighbor. When Sauli returned to the Barnabite residence after performing this charge, he was received as a postulant. A piece of the cross of St Alexander At first Sauli was assigned to help the sacristans. On the feast of the Assumption of Mary, August 15, 1551, Sauli received the religious habit and started his three years of novitiate. At a subsequent Chapter Sauli was criticized for ineptitude in his work in the sacristy, his bourgeois attitude, his lukewarmness, and many other things. The minutes were written by a Father Raimondi, who may have disliked Sauli's somewhat open and easy going nature. In October 1552, he took part in the many sessions during which the first Constitutions of the Order were discussed and finally approved. During the second year of novitiate, Alexander was allowed to follow regular theological studies at the Franciscan Friary of St. Mary of Peace, not far from St. Barnabas. He professed his vows on September 29, 1554. He continued his formation program until April 26, 1556, when the Fathers felt he was mature enough to be removed from the discipline of the novitiate, and was appointed the community librarian. On December 22, 1554, he received the subdiaconate and ordination to the diaconate on June 8, 1555. Due to his young age he had to wait for a special dispensation for the priestly ordination, which took place on March 21, 1556, when he was 22. First ministry in Pavia When the Grand Duke Gian Galeazzo Sforza became seriously ill, his mother, Bona of Savoy, and his wife, Isabella of Naples, made a vow that if he should get well, they would build a church in Pavia in honor of the miraculous image of the Virgin Mary painted on a wall of the Canepanova palace. The duke recovered, and the church, designed by Bramante was built. The Barnabites were approached to staffed it. This would be the first house of the Order after the establishment of the Motherhouse of St. Barnabas in 1547. Since Sauli was very familiar with the city and the university, he was assigned there as a preacher, and was soon joined by his two Masters, Besozzi and Omodei. Sauli dedicated himself to pastoral work and encouraged frequent communion and the Forty Hours devotion, He founded schools for religious instructions, offered the people lectures on the Letters of St. Paul, and organized groups at the university. Students asked Sauli for help in their studies. In response he created something of an independent department called an \\"academy\\". On February 2, 1560, Sauli celebrated the opening Mass of the Holy Spirit and started weekly conferences on St. Paul and daily repetitions of the university subjects which were divided in three groups: theology, philosophy (or medicine) and law. The teaching was geared to the intelligence and ability of each student, widening their interest to other subjects. He gave ample space to disputes, knowing how well the students would prepare themselves, thereby acquiring self-confidence while clarifying the ideas they were presenting. Seeing the success that Sauli was having, the Barnabites did not hesitate to open a house of studies for their seminarians, although open to other seminarians and lay people as well. Sauli gave daily classes in theology and philosophy. His method again was innovative. In presenting Aristotle he used the original Greek version avoiding the poor Latin translation of the time and he himself prepared a lexicon to better understand the terminology. In theology, Thomas Aquinas was a requirement, and the students used to say that, if the text of the Summa were to get lost, it was no problem because Sauli knew it by heart. St. Thomas was integrated with St. Bonaventure, the Fathers of the Church, especially St. John Chrysostom and St. Gregory the Great, and contemporary authors such as Savonarola. How innovative Sauli was is shown by the subsidiary subjects that he introduced, such as geometry which \\"makes the heart attentive and orderly\\", and law, so that the students could protect themselves in a world engulfed in never ending legal battles. For the Law of the Church, it was Sauli who suggested to his friend Marcantonio Cucci the preparation of a systematic and well organized exposition of all church laws which was published in 1565 after being revised by him. Until now Sauli had no official degree of any kind, although he received the Bachelor's degree through a public dispute that he held, between 30 May and 1 June 1560, on 150 theological theses. This was dedicated to Pierpaolo Arrigoni, then the President of the Senate of Milan. The rector of the \\"Artists\\" (philosophers and doctors), had offered him a chair of philosophy at the university, but the superior, Besozzi, declined without even notifying Sauli. The Barnabites were concerned that such a position would lead to vain-glory, and to the ruin of their characteristic humility. In any event, in 1562 Sauli had to substitute for Philip Zaffiro, professor of philosophy, lecturing for a semester on the second book of the De Anima. His success and the public‚Äôs demand convinced the Fathers to allow him to pursue an official degree. The Academic Senate dispensed him from the private examination, usually done to test the preparation of a candidate, and for the public exam they allowed him only half a day instead of the customary full day. The subjects selected at random for his exam were: in philosophy, The unity of the creating principle by Peter Lombard and, in theology, the De sacramentis in genere. As a sign of distinction, the examiners were only senior professors. It was his mentor Anthony Aosta, Minister General of the Conventual Franciscan friars, who bestowed on him the doctoral insignia according to tradition: books at first entrusted to him closed, and then opened to symbolize an ongoing need for further studies and renewal, the black hat, symbol of theology, and a golden ring on the right hand, followed by the kiss of peace and a blessing. After his graduation on May 28, 1563, he became a member of the College of Professors of Theology,Rudge, F.M. \\"Bl. Alexander Sauli.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 1. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 9 Dec. 2014 teaching philosophy and theology. He was also entrusted with teaching in church the Epistles of St. Paul. He attracted a vast audience, including noted preachers of the day, but Sauli did not follow the career of the pulpit. Three years later he became dean. A letter signed by St. Alexander Sauli Instead of a permanent job at the university, Sauli preferred to concentrate on the private school of the Order. The Bishop of Pavia, Ippolito de' Rossi had made him his private theologian,Butler, Alban., \\"St. Alexander Sauli\\", Butler's Lives of the Saints, Liturgical Press, 1995 examiner of the clergy, lector for the cases of conscience, and an associate for pastoral visits. At the University he participated in the meetings of the professors of theology, gave special lectures and worked on the revision of books. In the house of studies, Sauli concentrated on the preparation of a complete curricula. He had the gift \\"for easy explanation. In few words he could present his thought very well. It did not matter how intellectual or difficult they might be\\", Fr. Bellarmino testified at the Apostolic Process. Books at the time were very scarce, so he republished Savonarola's \\"Confessionale,\\" adapting it to the documents of the Council of Trent, published a treatise on Marriage, an Enchiridion for professors and for those to be ordained, a manual for \\"Moral Decisions\\". He published all of them anonymously, but in the second edition De Rossi revealed the name of the true author. One of Sauli's unique gifts as a professor was that he allowed room for new and fresher minds. In 1563, he gave his philosophy chair to Basilio Bonfanti, a young cleric who already spoke perfect Latin, Greek and Hebrew. Two years later Sauli was his mentor in Bonfanti's public defense of his 200 philosophical and theological theses, which Bonfanti dedicated to Alexander's father, Dominic Sauli, who, from his house in Pavia, was following with great pride his son's progress. The year before, he had donated to the Barnabites his rich and private library. Superior General (1566‚Äì1569) Alexander Sauli - Father General of the Barnabites In 1567 Sauli was elected superior-general of the congregation.\\"St Alexander Sauli, bishop\\", Barnabite Holiness Orazio Premoli, in the biography he wrote in 1904, when Sauli was canonized, said: \\"As he was, at the young age of 33, elected Superior General of a Religious Congregation, whose members were somewhat elderly, he under stood right away that ...To be superior meant for him first of all to lead in the rigorous observance of the Rule, and to be heroically faithful to the vows.\\" On August 5 he had an unpleasant surprise as Attilio Gritti, a gentleman from Novara, presented himself with pontifical documents claiming possession of the Church and House of St. Barnabas. Sauli immediately contested the claim and the validity of the documents, since Gritti's uncle had donated the church and the house to the Barnabites at the time of Pope Paul III. He entrusted the case into the hands of Charles Borromeo, the Archbishop of Milan, who obtained from Pope Pius IV the resolution of the case. As a good canon lawyer he made sure that all regulations would comply with the new guidelines emerging from the Council of Trent. In 1568 he called an extraordinary Chapter to deal with the Divine Office. The congregation had adopted the Quinones version of the breviary to be sung in recto tono. In 1568 Pope Pius V published the new breviary eliminating all previous editions. The Chapter (September 10‚Äì15) adopted the new breviary, keeping the recto tono recitation. He wrote rules for the novices and gave guidelines for the curriculum of sacred and profane studies, and for preaching. Sauli was in charge of the monastery of the Angelic Sisters of St. Paul, and of the \\"Submitted to the Crucified Lord,\\" to whom he gave regular conferences, and with whom he kept regular correspondence even from Corsica. When in 1554 the Countess Torelli left the Angelics, taking with her whatever benefits had been given to the monastery. They survived through the generosity of Julia Sfondrati, but with great tension between the two ladies. Borromeo asked Sauli for the Angelic Sisters of St Paul, and the Jesuit Leonetto Clavonio for the Torelli, to resolve the controversy. In April 1569, the Bishop of Vicenza, through the recommendation of Borromeo, tried to convince the Barnabites to return to his city for the reformation of the monasteries. Sauli answered, \\"Yes, on condition that the Serenissima (Venice) will revoke the ban of 1552.\\" Venice's answer was that by now the whole thing had been forgotten, so that they were welcomed back to the Republic. Alexander did not accept those conditions, but in deference to the bishop, he sent over Fr. Berna for a few months. Sauli's term as Superior General was a period of true renewal for the Order, renewal to be carried out fully by St. Charles. After the shock of 1552 everything was renewed: better structures, rekindling of the original fervor, the members were reinforced with much better quality. Some of those who had left came back to St. Barnabas. The apostolate expanded to new foundations. Sauli is regarded as the \\"second Founder\\" because he gave new vigor to the Order. The co-operator of St. Charles Borromeo Sauli was invited by Charles Borromeo to preach at the cathedral in Milan, where he made a great impression on both Borromeo and the future Pope Gregory XIV. Sauli participated in the first synod of the Archdiocese of Milan and in the first Provincial Council was entrusted with various tasks by Borromeo. As Superior General of the Barnabites, Sauli became part of Borromeo's circle of friends. Almost daily he was consulted for his wisdom and prudence. Some of the Barnabites complained that they had elected a Superior General, not the cardinal's secretary. But senior members of the Order did not mind at all, because this forced the small congregation to come out of the shell in which it had been hiding since their expulsion from Venice. The archbishop was very impartial in calling on all the Barnabites, according to their activities and talents, for specific cases to be resolved. The altar of the Sacred Heart holds the reliquary donated to him by Borromeo. Once a month, Borromeo found refuge at the House of St. Barnabas. Moreover, he spent the whole Holy Week with the Community. At first he used Sauli for delicate and secret missions, such as peace among spouses and families, and delicate cases of conscience. He immediately noticed his prudence and common sense, such as when he wanted to reduce the grate of the Monastery of St. Martha. The nuns rebelled, and Sauli counselled him to leave them alone \\"because it is not really important if the parlor is made one way or the other.\\" Sauli showed a great balance in his judgment and decision making passing over secondary items to reach the core of the issue. It was characteristic of him. From Mantua Borromeo asked the Fathers of St. Barnabas to send him someone for a general confession. Fr. Sauli was sent, which made St. Charles exclaim: \\"They have sent me the Superior himself, to my great satisfaction.\\" From then on the two became like one soul, and later St. Charles said: \\"From then on I almost started a new course in my spiritual life not taking into consideration at all my previous accomplishments.\\" A particular episode shows their intimacy. When St. Charles miraculously escaped an attempt on his life, he questioned Fr. Sauli: \\"What spiritual benefit should 1 draw for my soul from it,\\" and Fr. Sauli answered: \\"To humble yourself and reflect if God has allowed it in punishment for some of your defects,\\" and then frankly questioned him if he was ready to face God's judgment. In 1568, during the long stay of Borromeo in Mantua, and while the Vicar General, Castelli, was hiding in St. Barnabas, Sauli was to all practical purposes the administrator of the archdiocese, as proved from the long list of practical decisions taken by him as shown in the correspondence between the two. The Second Diocesan Synod of 1569 was completely readied in St. Barnabas. At one point Borromeo sought to both resolve once and for all the chronic poverty of the congregation, and to reform the Order of the Humiliates, who were absolutely averse to any kind of reform. He wanted to merge the two orders. Sauli opposed this because the union would have been an endless source of internal conflict. This would also have doubled the size of the order, making it practically ungovernable, since the Humiliates did not believe in the need for reform. Borromeo tried an intervention from Rome, but Pope Pius V, well aware of the conditions of the friars, understood Sauli's objections. When Friar Jerome Donati made the famous attempt on Borromemo's life, the Pope suppressed the Order once and for all with a decree signed on 8 February 1571. By that time Sauli was in Corsica. With great regret Bishop Sauli could not attend Borromeo's funeral, but he furnished Fr. Besozzi with many insights and episodes for the publication of his biography, \\"because,\\" he wrote from Campoloro on June 8, 1585, \\"until 1570 I too can say many things, since that Holy Soul has communicated to me the most important things that have happened to him.\\" Bishop St Alexander Sauli as a Bishop In 1571, he was appointed by Pius V to the ancient see of Aleria, Corsica, where the state of the Roman Catholic Church was deplorable. In a letter to the Doge of Genoa, Cardinal Cicada wrote: \\"This morning February 10, 1570, in a Consistory, the Pope has provided for the Church of Aleria in the person of the Rev. Alexander Sauli, as His Holiness has great trust in the virtues and goodness of this priest for the reformation of the religious and good customs of this island. May the good Lord bring to fruition the pious intentions of His Holiness, who has been motivated by no other aim but the service of God and the salvation of souls, according to the good reports he has received about him, although he has never met or known him.\\" In Milan the news caused great unrest among the Barnabites who protested, \\"We have no one who equals him. We have few among us, whom either age does not qualify for active duty, or youth in consequence of their want of experience, does not render unfit for the government of others.\\"Butler, Charles. \\"B.Alexander Sauli\\", A continuation of the Rev. Alban Butler's lives of the Saints, Keating and Brown, 1823 They sought Cardinal Borromeo's help to avert such a disaster. He wrote to his man in Rome, Msgr. Ormaneto: \\"Having notified the Superior of St. Barnabas about the decision of Our Lord to give him the care of the Church ofAleria in Corsica, he, for the humble esteem of himself, has stated not to be qualified: which I do not agree with, as I know very well his qualifications.... Meanwhile I cannot avoid to present to His Holiness the great worry of the old Fathers of this Congregation, whom I have notified about it.... because of the great damage coming to their Congregation with the loss of this man, as it relies on his prudent government with great help from his knowledge, in which, truthfully, there is no equal; ... Then, I know too how the city at large will suffer because of it, since the Superior is very useful to it in so many ways, such as conferences and confessions, and other spiritual services, and his prudent counsel, of which I avail myself regularly. If, then, Our Lord believes that he will render greater service to God in his new vocation, he is a son of obedience.\\" A pontifical vestment of St. Alexander Sauli, CRSP To prepare himself to follow God's will, together with St. Charles, Fr. Sauli went to the Carthusian abbey in Carignano for a retreat. Writing to his father, Alexander stated: \\"The effort I have endured here as Superior General seems to me like roses in comparison with what I am starting to experience as a Bishop.\\" The ceremony took place in the Cathedral of Milan on March 12. Sauli was consecrated bishop by his friend, Cardinal Borromeo of Milan, with Ippolito de Rossi, Bishop of Pavia, and Federico Comer, Bishop of Bergamo, as concelebrants. St. Charles provided and donated to him all the Episcopal vestments. Apostle of Corsica (1570‚Äì1590) Murato,Corsica, St. Michael Church Corsica had not seen a bishop in 70 years, and in many ways had fallen into a pitiful condition. Pope Pius V had advised him to bring along to Aleria at least a dozen confreres to help him. But the community could afford only four: three priests, Vincent Corti, Thomas Gambaldi, Francis Stauli, and one Brother, John Battista. At the end of April, 1570, Sauli, his four confreres and a few servants landed in Corsica. The first impact was very harsh because the episcopal residence had been destroyed during the war. Seminaries did not yet exist, and in Corsica there were no schools or universities. Only a few priests could be educated in the main land, while the others were learned a little from those who knew a little more. Aleria, Corsica, St. Marcel Church On May 18, 1570, the new Bishop wrote to Cardinal Borromeo in Milan Charles describing the deplorable conditions: :Most Reverend and honorable my Lord: :It has pleased the Divine Majesty to allow me to reach safe and sound Corsica, and I feel obliged to send you, my reverend greetings and give you news about conditions of my Church of Aleria. ...as I reached Bastia, I had to stop therefore ten days to get the provisions... During that time I received the visit of many of the priests of my diocese. I did not find one who knows Latin, rather many do not even know how to write. I leave to your Illustrious Lordship, to imagine the moral situation here in Corsica, where for a long time there have been wars, where the Bishops did not usually reside in their diocese. My episcopal residence had been the sea and habitation of the guerrilla fighter, Dampiero the Corso, and it has registered more tumults and rebellions than any other section of the island. : :I am still in Corte, a devastated area and in ruins. The Fathers of St. Prahcis have prepared for me two little rooms, ...Nor can I think to stay here, because the Friars have told me that my overstay would cause too much disturbance in their regular observance; and it seems to me that they are right, because there is a continuous come and go of people, and if any one wishes to come to my room, he is forced to cross through the Friars‚Äô refectory. :What really worries me is that the town is in such ruins and devastation that I am not able to find, what should I say, a house for eighteen people between servants and Fathers that I am taking with me by order of His Holiness, where even two can live. Nor do I have the possibility to build, myself a room, in the Capuchin style, as I have intention to do next year, if God keeps me in life, due to the many expenses I have to face. : :During the year I will take residence in Bastid, where I think to stay until harvest time, since in the present moment there is great scarcity. Then I will start the pastoral visit ...I will try always to keep with me some of the priests to instruct them, in the vernacular, the most necessary things about the administration of the Sacraments, and the salvation of souls. : :...I close kissing the hands of your Lordship and declare myself a very devout servant. May the Lord God keep you. :From Corte, May 18, 1570. :Your Lordship and reverend devout servant, the Bishop of Aleria He established himself in precarious and humble dwellings and started immediately the visitation of the whole Diocese, entailing great and severe sacrifices, to bring to all the Word of God \\"like a beneficial rain that the good Lord sends on a field for long time arid and destroyed.\\" By the end of August he was able to hold a synod with 150 priests present to set up rules and regulations. The synod became an annual event of three days. Albert Grozio, the Bishop's secretary wrote: \\"He took advantage of these days to live heart to heart with his priests who were invited, if they wanted, to live with him at his own expenses. He ate with them, talked with each one of them, and was generous in his charity. To instruct them he used to create cases of conscience, going over liturgical formulas, dogmatic or moral principles, and counciliar and ecclesiastical documents. At the end of the synod most of the priests had to face a most arduous trip back home, so he used to prepare for them and their laity, abundant provisions, giving them horses, wine, or whatever could be useful for the trip.\\" With the passing years he provided his clergy with various booklets of instructions including a simplified edition of the Roman catechism so much praised by St. Francis de Sales. In the following years he often changed residence to be able to have a good knowledge of his people. He founded a seminary in Bastia, and he dedicated himself to all, in spite of his sickness, like malaria and high fever, which few times brought him to the point of death. He transferred his see to escape the malaria-ridden swamplands around Aleria to Cervione, where, in 1578, he built the Cathedrale St-Erasme. The factional enmity, the famines, and droughts very much tested Alexander's charity. The pacification of vendettas was a significant part of his pastoral activity.Wilson, Stephen. Saints and Their Cults: Studies in Religious Sociology, Folklore and History, CUP Archive, 1985 One individual made an attempt on his life. Due to his efforts to end the violence, the people called him \\"The Angel of Peace\\". From letters written when Sauli was appointed a bishop, it seems that Borromeo thought that he would be wasted in Corsica, and tried on various occasions to have him transferred back to his province, always crashing against Sauli's humility, who wanted to \\"leave his bones in Corsica.\\" The Corsicans thought to be able to keep him for life. When the news reached them that the Republic of Genoa wanted him to be the coadjutor of the archbishop with the right of succession, they mobilized themselves. With tears in their hearts they begged the Pope and the Republic to change their decision. The letter they sent to the Pope is a long list of warm praises. Their prayers were not in vain as the Saint was able to stay for another seven years among the Corsicans. He corrected abuses, rebuilt churches, founded colleges and seminaries, and despite the depredations of corsairs, and the death of his comrades, he placed the Church in a flourishing condition. Because of his heroic charity, especially during the time of famine and pestilence, he was called ‚ÄúThe Guardian Angel and Apostle of Corsica.‚Äù Bishop of Pavia (1591‚Äì1592) The Cathedral in Pavia, Italy What the Corsicans feared in 1584 became a reality in 1591: Pope Gregory XIV, who in Pavia had used Alexander Sauli as his spiritual director, named him successor of Cardinal Ippolito De Rossi, as Bishop of Pavia. The nomination gave great joy to the people of Pavia, but caused tears all over Corsica, tears which accompanied the shepherd to the boat taking him to Rome. He remained there for two weeks, spending some time in Genoa and at St. Barnabas in Milan, before taking possession of his new diocese on October 19, 1591. The charity which had made him famous in Corsica immediately became one of his outstanding virtues also in Pavia, since a severe famine had made prices of vital items, such as wheat, climb out of reach. On the first Sunday after his entry, he celebrated a solemn pontifical Mass during which, in simple and clear words, he expressed his desire to be the father of the poor, ready to give them whatever he would receive. As a first sign of his commitment, he ordered four noblemen, and his helpers to distribute a purse with one hundred golden scuds. His action was so contagious it generated a chain reaction in generosity throughout that day, bringing the purse to a very sizeable amount. Wanting to have a first hand knowledge of his diocese, he started a pastoral visit right away, planning to close it with a synod. He introduced and promoted the Forty Hours Devotions. He dedicated himself also to pastoral services visiting hospitals, monasteries, and schools. Death and veneration Pope John Paul II prays at the tomb of St Alexander Sauli in the Cathedral in Pavia, Italy He left a number of works, chiefly catechetical. Although for some time he had been sick on and off with fever, toward the end of September 1592, Sauli began the pastoral visit of his new diocese. After presiding at the ordinations in Bursignano, he reached Colosso d'Asti on October 1, where he spent the day in preaching, catechesis, confirmations, and personal meetings. That night he became sick with fever and gout. Not wanting to disturb the local parish priest, he decided to accept the invitation of his friend, Count Ercole Roero, to stay at his castle. He died on Sunday, October 11, 1592. A few days before he had said: \\"Don't think that I am dying because of the efforts of this pastoral visit; be convinced that this is the hour fixed by God. If I should start all over what I have done, I would do it over again.\\" The body was brought to Pavia on October 14, and the next day the solemn funeral took place. His universal fame as a saint spread immediately and grew steadily. The unanimous consensus and great devotion, especially in Pavia, led, in 1623, to the initiation of the canonical process. He was beatified by Benedict XIV, 23 April 1742, and canonized by Pope Pius X, 11 December 1904. St. Alexander Sauli is the Patron of Barnabite seminarians. His feast is celebrated on October 11. The political and religious events of the 1700s and 1800s put on trial the life of religious orders; therefore, the journey toward canonization experienced a very long pause. Anyway, after the Holy Founder reached the glory of the altar in 1897, Alexander Sauli too reached the same honor. On December 11, 1904, Pius X inscribed him among the saints of the universal Church. The two required miracles, certified and approved by a diocesan and apostolic trial, had taken place one in 1899, in Bastia, Corsica, to the 20-year-old Maria Canessa, and the other in Monza, in 1741, during the celebration of his beatification, the cure of a certain Carlo Riva who had been paralyzed for more than a year. The Little Flowers of St. Alexander Sauli Poetic moments of history and spiritual reality of St. Alexander taken from the Apostolic Process Rain ‚ÄúMonths had passed without a drop of rain. Fearing for the harvest, the people of Cervicone begged Bishop Sauli to have a procession to obtain rain. After three days of fast, the procession took place from the Cathedral to the church of St. Francis, where the Bishop started the singing of the Litanies, and other songs, until the blue sky started to get cloudy. At that moment he started to cry, ‚ÄòMercy!‚Äô and the whole people joined in. After the third cry, the rain poured down. There was so much water that the people had to stay in church for three hours to wait for the rain to stop.‚Äù (Friar Sisto Negroni, p.43) Maimed Healed ‚ÄúBartholomew of Cervicone, the treasurer of the Confraternity of the Holy Cross, stole a certain amount of money that belonged to the Confraternity. One day, he had an accident. He fell while going fishing. This left him crippled. Bishop Sauli met him one day and told him, ‚ÄòOh, Bartholomew, you will never be healed unless you pay back your debt.‚Äô Bartholomew, wishing to be healed, sold a piece of his chestnut wood and paid what he owed. After that, he went to confession, received communion, and asked the blessing of the Bishop. From that day on, he showed constant improvement until he was perfectly healed. I have been a personal eyewitness of these events.‚Äù (James Alfonsi, p. I08) Half Bath ‚ÄúI went once with Bishop Sauli by carriage to St. Mary in Pertica, toward Milan. We had to cross an irrigation canal called Carona. I told the coachman to go further north since the water was too deep. However, rushing carelessly, we went right into the water. The Bishop got wet to his knees. I was quick enough to raise my feet, so I got wet only to my ankles. I got mad at the coachman and scolded him. The Bishop smiled. He tried to calm me down, telling me to take things as part of the joys of life. He did so even though he was more wet than I was.‚Äù (Severino Bellingeri, p. 111) The Best Job ‚ÄúWhile still a cleric, I went to Pavia for the admission exam to the Holy Orders. Monsignor Sauli asked me, ‚ÄòWhy have you come to Pavia?‚Äô I answered, ‚ÄòTo follow holy obedience.‚Äô And he said, ‚ÄòBlessed are you, because your job is better than mine, which is to be a Bishop.‚Äô‚Äù (Fr. Giannambrogio Mazenta, p. 121) Calming of a Storm ‚ÄúAt the end of our visit to Gregory XIII, Monsignor Sauli, Fr. Ambrose Ruottoli, Fr. Lawrenceda Corte, Fr. Cesare Fei and I left to go back to Corsica. We embarked on the boat at the port of Ripa on the Tiber and sailed on. When we reached the island of Elba, a violent storm broke out. We all thought that we would die at that time. Fr. Cesare Fei began to cry, ‚ÄòWe are going to drown!‚Äô Monsignor answered, ‚ÄòNow, we are going to die!‚Äô Fr. Cesare replied, ‚ÄòYes, but not like this!‚Äô Monsignor Sauli then raised his eyes to heaven and prayed. And then he made the sign of the cross on the sea. Right away, the wind died down. We sailed on peacefully until we arrived in Bastia.‚Äù (Peter Negri, p. 61-62) Beneficent Hurricane Alexander Sauli puts to flight the pirates' ships ‚ÄúTwenty-two Turkish galleys were heading toward Campoloro after destroying Sartone and Monticello. The people started to run in panic. They brought a horse to Bishop Sauli so that he could run away. Instead, he refused and asked them all to stay calm because the Turks were not going to land. They all prayed. All of a sudden, a hurricane came. The strong wind kept the galleys from coming close to the shore. And so the galleys left without doing any damage to the place.‚Äù (Palmerino Valle, p. 113) Parish Priest Alexander Sauli puts peace between adverse fractions ‚ÄúThree farmers from Pavia who tended some land of their church came to complain about their parish priest concerning the interest rates. Monsignor Sauli welcomed them warmly, but then admonished them for not acting well with their own parish priest. The farmers finally admitted that they had acted wrongly. They then withdrew their complaints. Afterwards, the Bishop called the parish priest, reprimanded him, and warned him not to cause anymore problems to anyone.‚Äù (Baldassarre Landini, p. 107) Fishers of Corals ‚ÄúOnce, in Solensara, the Turks assailed about sixty boats of fishers of corals. The men, about ten in each boat, swam to safety in Cervicone. As soon as he got the news, Bishop Sauli called the fishers together in church to console them. Then he fed them in his residence. He told them, ‚ÄòDear children, eat because this belongs to you, not to the Bishop.‚Äô The next day, he provided them with bread and money for their trip back home. I was sent by the Bishop to Bastia to prepare the dinner and transportation for those who were not from Corsica.‚Äù (Thomas Giorgi, p. 90) Ecstasy ‚ÄúOne day during the Holy Week in Pavia, the Canon Fabio Bottigella accompanied Bishop Sauli to the reposition chapel. There the Bishop immersed himself in prayer. Three hours had passed, and he was still in prayer, totally unaware of the time. It was almost the time for the ceremony, but he did not move.

It is located at around . The Vistula River flows through the town. Zakroczym has a long and rich history: in the Kingdom of Poland and the Polish- Lithuanian Commonwealth, it was the capital of an administrative unit (ziemia), part of Mazovian Voivodeship. Also, Zakroczym was a royal town of the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland. The town lies at the intersection of two main roads - national road 62, and national road 7.  Name  The name of Zakroczym comes from ancient Polish word zakrot, which means river crossing. Originally, the town was located closer to the Vistula river, and was called Kroczym or Kroczyn.

Background King Louis I of Hungary stayed in Transylvania for six monthsfrom October to Aprilin 1366. On 28 June 1366, while residing in Torda (present-day Turda), the monarch issued a decree at the request of the Transylvanian noblemen. The latter had informed the King that they \\"have been suffering, day by day, many troubles because of the evil arts of many malefactors, especially Romanians, ...because of their way of being and their disorderly behaviour\\". The royal decree granted special privileges to the Transylvanian noblemen \\"in order to remove, from this country, malefactors belonging to any nation, especially Romanians\\". For this purpose, the decree determines the rules of the legal procedure. Historians have not reached a consensual view of the exact circumstances of the issuing of the decree and its main purpose. Istv√°n Petrovics writes that the mobile way of life of the increasing Romanian population caused their conflicts with the sedentary Hungarians. According to Ioan-Aurel Pop, the decree shows the Romanians' \\"muted resistance\\" against the monarch and the noblemen who had attempted to deprive them of their property, especially their inherited estates.

It is located on the left bank of the river Xuquer. History The locality is named after a 13th-century Moorish farmhouse, granted in 1238 by the Aragonese king Jaume I (James I) to Pere de Montagut. On January 17, 1252 this latter conceded the right to found a township upon these lands to 54 Christian pioneers after the reconquista of the Valencian Moorish territories. The town was involved in many of the conflicts that shook Spain throughout its history: it was sacked during the \\"Revolta de les Germanies\\" in the beginning of the 16th century; in the 18th century, during the War of the Spanish Succession, the Bourbon troops plundered it again, and finally, during the Peninsular War it lodged a camp of French troops that looted everything from the villagers, leaving them in debt. During the Spanish Civil War, it was lucky to keep on the rearguard, although this did not spare the town from being bombed by Italian fascist planes, supporting Franco‚Äôs uprising. A former name for this locality in Spanish is Alcudia de Carlet, which was in use during Franco's regime. After Franco's death in 1975 and the institution of democracy in Spain, the name fell into disfavor and the population unanimously voted to change it. Economic resources Up to not many years ago the town relied almost exclusively on its agriculture production (mainly oranges and vegetables), some years ago a new and pretty exotic product was re-introduced into the orchards of l'Alcudia and the surrounding district, the caqui (Persimmon) which has become a major source of revenue for Alcudian growers. l'Alc√∫dia has recently become an industrial town, with a number of factories producing furniture and general light industry.

It is located within the historic region of Kuyavia. Ciechocinek is known for its unique 'saline graduation towers'.Ciechocinek homepage Experts have considered the local saline springs to be of extreme value and named the thermal spring no. 14 \\"a wonder of nature\\". The therapeutic qualities of these springs are directed toward curing cardiovascular, respiratory, orthopedic, traumatic, rheumatic, nervous system and women's diseases. History Monument of Stanis≈Çaw Staszic in Park Tƒô≈ºniowy (Graduation Park) The history of Ciechocinek dates back to the Middle Ages. It belonged to the Kingdom of Poland until the Second Partition of Poland in 1793, when it was annexed by Prussia. It 1807 it became part of the short-lived Polish Duchy of Warsaw, and in 1815 it became part of Congress Poland, initially autonomous within the Russian Empire, from 1844 on as part of the Warsaw Governorate. When Wieliczka and Bochnia, towns rich in salt deposits, fell in the First Partition of Poland to Austria, the salt resources of Ciechocinek and nearby S≈Ço≈Ñsk drew the attention of Polish officials. On the initiative of Stanis≈Çaw Staszic, a salt extraction project was created. The development of the spa plant and health resort in Ciechocinek dates back to 1836. In 1867 Ciechocinek gained a railway connection with Bydgoszcz and Warsaw. The rapid development and popularity among guests from home and abroad contributed to the granting of town rights in 1916. After Poland regained independence after World War I in 1918, the spa was taken over by the Polish Government and subordinated to the Ministry of Health. During this period, healing facilities destroyed during the war were rebuilt, new pensions, a post office, school, a residential and commercial complex, the President's Manor House and other facilities were built. The Health Park was also created, consisting of a thermal-saline pool, the Jordan Garden, a sports field and vast green areas surrounding the graduation towers. Spa guests in Ciechocinek with graduation towers in the background in interwar Poland Following the invasion of Poland at the beginning of the Second World War, Ciechocinek was occupied by Nazi Germany on 12 September 1939 and on 26 September incorporated into the Reichsgau Wartheland as part of the district/county (kreis) of Hermannsbad (1941-1945). The Polish population was subjected to various crimes including mass arrests, murder and expulsions. During the German invasion, in September 1939, the Wehrmacht and Selbstschutz murdered some inhabitans of Ciechocinek in the nearby village of Koneck, and from October 1939 to January 1940, the Germans carried out massacres of many Poles from Ciechocinek in the nearby Odolion forest (see Nazi crimes against the Polish nation).Maria Wardzy≈Ñska, By≈Ç rok 1939.

It was the only airplane ever designed for the specific purpose of winning the Bendix Trophy. The plane was designed and developed by Ben Howard and Gordon Israel, who later became an engineer for the Grumman Aircraft Engineering Corporation. Mister Mulligan was designed to fly the entire length of the race nonstop and at high altitude. Neither had ever been done before. Mister Mulligan won the trophy, and thus changed the way in which long distance airplanes were designed. History The Bendix Trophy was a cross-country race from the west coast to the site of the National Air Races in Cleveland, Ohio, and typically was the starting event of the week-long aviation festival. The Thompson Trophy was awarded to the winner of the unlimited division in closed-course pylon racing at the National Air Races. The sole original DGA-6 was constructed in 1934 in the defunct factory of the American Eagle-Lincoln Aircraft based at Fairfax Airport in Kansas City, Missouri. It featured a steel tube fuselage with a plywood-skinned wing. Howard freely admitted he was inspired by \\"seeing the Monocoupe from the wrong end\\" during air races; The DGA-6 can thus be termed an \\"overgrown Monocoupe\\". While en route to the 1934 air races, oxygen and fuel system problems caused an off-field landing, which damaged the landing gear and propeller. The aircraft could not be repaired in time and missed the 1934 season. In the 1935 Bendix race the aircraft was loaded with 300 gallons of gasoline, 30 gallons of oil and oxygen equipment for two, giving it the ability to fly for seven hours at . At that load the aircraft required of runway and had an initial climb rate of close to 2000 ft/min. Howard and Israel flew the DGA-6 in the 30 August 1935 Bendix Trophy race and won with a speed of 238.70 miles er hour, and Harold Neumann racing the DGA-6 flew at in winning the 2 September 1935 Thompson Trophy race at the 1935 National Air Races. No other pilot or single aircraft had ever won both races. Howard's DGA-6 also had the distinction of being the only racer during the golden age of airshows to evolve into a successful commercial production aircraft, first as the Howard DGA-8 and DGA-9, and later the DGA-11 and DGA-12. Howard's engineering advantage was his low-drag airframe and the use of the Pratt & Whitney Wasp radial. The fuel capacity of the four-seat Mister Mulligan made the difference in the Bendix race, as Howard and Israel beat Roscoe Turner by less than a minute, thanks to two fewer fueling stops in the race from Burbank, California, to Cleveland, although Turner's Pratt & Whitney R-1690 Hornet on his Wedell-Williams Model 44 racer gave him the power advantage. Mister Mulligan broke Wedell-Williams' three-year streak of wins in the Bendix. By the end of the week, Howard and his DGA-6 replaced Wedell- Williams as the rising star of aviation by upsetting defending champion Turner in the Thompson race after he was forced out. Newspapers hailed the 1935 event as the \\"Ben Howard National Air Races\\". Unfortunately, the DGA-6's days on the national air race scene were limited. The next year, Howard and his wife Maxine were injured when Mister Mulligan lost a propeller blade and crash- landed near Crownpoint, New Mexico during the latter stages of the 1936 Bendix (New York‚ÄìLos Angeles) race. Howard recovered from the serious injuries resulting from the crash, but lost a leg in the accident and Mister Mulligan was destroyed. Roscoe Turner met a similar fate, ground-looping on a rough field in Texas. The misfortunes of Howard and Turner opened the way for Arkansan Louise Thaden in her Beechcraft Model 17 Staggerwing to become the first woman to win a national air trophy. The success of Mister Mulligan led to the formation of the Howard Aircraft Corporation on January 1, 1937. Reproduction aircraft Mister Mulligan replica at Oshkosh, Wisconsin, 2002 Thirty-four years after the accident, racing enthusiast, Bob Reichardt tracked down Mister Mulligan's crash site and was surprised to find most of the parts were still in usable condition, protected by local dry, mountain climate. With the salvaged parts as patterns, Reichardt was able to recreate Mister Mulligan, but was killed in 1977 while performing a timed run over the Tonopah, Nevada dry lake. A second replica DGA-6 was built by Jim Younkin of Springdale, Arkansas. Younkin and \\"Bud\\" Dake also designed and built the Mullicoupe, an original design utilizing features of both Mister Mulligan and the Monocoupe 90 that inspired it. Another derivative aircraft is the Dickenson-Howard DGA-21, built by Bruce Dickenson of Santa Paula, California. It is based on design features of the DGA-6 (including the Pratt & Whitney R-1340 Wasp engine) and the DGA-15, and its DGA-21 designation is simply \\"6 + 15\\".

Russia currently has seven, one ( Admiral Lazarev) is afloat but has been inoperative for years and another that only nominally in commission and has not put to sea since 1991 ( Admiral Ushakov). The fourth Slava class, (Slava-class Admiral Lobov), is owned by Ukraine and remains uncompleted at its construction shipyard.  Kirov class Kirov class (most likely Admiral Lazarev). The vessels of the Kirov class are the world's largest cruisers, and for this reason they are generally referred to as battlecruisers. Two Kirov battlecruisers are currently in service, the RFS Admiral Nakhimov and RFS Pyotr Velikiy. In the last 6 years, the Pyotr Velikiy (Peter the Great) has participated in numerous military exercises, with President Vladimir Putin being on board during the last one. The older Admiral Nakhimov was repaired and returned to service in 2005; the ship is currently undergoing upgrade renovations and should return to active service in the late 2010s. Kirov class battlecruisers are outfitted with a very large number of weapons systems as well as modern electrical equipment, and are fully capable of fighting a large number of sea-, subsea-, air- and land-based enemy targets. Laid up, written off * Admiral Lazarev * Admiral Ushakov In service, undergoing overhaul * Admiral Nakhimov In service * Pyotr Veliky Slava class Slava class. The Slava class was designed as a less radical back-up to the aforementioned Kirovs, providing most of the facilities of the larger ships in a considerably smaller, gas turbine-powered hull. The main armament is made up of sixteen SS-N-12 Sandbox launchers, mounted in eight pairs on either side of the forward superstructure. These launchers are fixed at an angle of some 15¬∞. Over-the-horizon targeting for SS-N-12 systems is provided by helicopter or Punch Bowl Satcom. The Slava class was designed as part of a new strategy of creating bastions for ballistic missile submarines. Project 1143 and 1164 ships were to protect these bastions, and the new SS-N-12 missile was designed to strike major enemy anti-submarine warfare units. One of the other major roles of this cruiser type is to hunt down and destroy enemy aircraft carriers, and other heavy ships.

Kuznetsov class aircraft carriers are designated as heavy aircraft carrying cruisers by the Russian Navy because their main strike armament is long-range antiship cruise missiles and the air wing is intended for defensive purposes. The flight deck area of the class is 14,700 square meters, and aircraft takeoff is assisted by a bow ski jump angled at 12¬∞ in lieu of steam catapults. Two starboard lifts carry aircraft from the hangar to the flight deck. The ship was designed with the capacity to support 16 Yakovlev Yak-41M (which was cancelled) and 12 Sukhoi Su-27K fixed-wing aircraft and a range of Kamov Ka-27 helicopters. The ship has a Granit anti- ship missile system equipped with 12 surface-to-surface missile launchers. The air defence gun and missile system includes the Klinok / SA-N-9 Gauntlet air defence missile system with 24 vertical launchers and 192 surface-to-air missiles, plus 8 CADS-N-1 Kashtan CIWS mounts. The system defends the ship against anti-ship missiles, aircraft, unmanned aerial vehicles and surface ships. The ship is also equipped with an UDAV-1 integrated anti-submarine system with 60 anti-submarine missiles. Currently, the only ship ever commissioned in the class, the Kuznetsov, operates 24 Sukhoi Su-33, unknown numbers of Sukhoi Su-25UTG and 24 Kamov Ka-27 helicopters for use in various roles, such as long range radar, anti-submarine and other uses.

(see History) History The first signs of settlement date to 10,000 BC when reindeer hunters made their visits to the area. Around 4500 BC the first agricultural settlements were founded. Goth tribes also moved through the area on their trek from Scandinavia and North Germany. Visible signs of existence of the Old Prussians also exist. Around the 7th century Slavs (Goplans) arrived in the area. In the time of first Piasts and the formation of Poland, Ziemia Che≈Çmi≈Ñska and the settlement of ≈Åoza (now the town of Che≈Çm≈ºa) was incorporated into Che≈Çmi≈Ñska castellany. After the death of Boles≈Çaw III Wrymouth in 1138 it was handed over to his son Boles≈Çaw IV the Curly ‚Äì as part of Masovia. The fights with nearby Old Prussian tribes resulted in several raids that destroyed the area. In the 13th century the ruler of the area was Konrad I who in order to Christianize the Old Prussians brought a missionary Bishop Christian of Oliva. The bishop was granted a number of possession including the settlement of ≈Åoza. Later Teutonic Knights were granted local lands to support the bishop by military means. However, in time the knights took over the possession of Christian's diocese, dividing the area into four dioceses in 1243, including the Che≈Çmi≈Ñska diocese. At the end of 1245 Heidenreich of the Bishopric of Culm became the bishop of diocese. He picked ≈Åoza as place of his stay. It was during that time that ≈Åoza received its new name Culmense and became part of the residence of the bishop who resided and governed in Warmia from 1245 to 1263. In 1251 (before July 22) Bishop Heidenreich bestowed city rights to ≈Åoza and renamed it Culmsee (Kulmsee).Max Perlbach, Preussische Regesten [Prussian Documents: Ann. Thor. Chron. terre Pruss. Ss.r.Pr. III 59, 468)Urkundenbuch des Bisthums Culm A number of other towns are mentioned in his territory as well, such as Hermannysdorp, Arnoldisdorp, Sconenwerde, Belacin, Razlai, Zcampe, Heiminsod and Vambresin or Wambresin. Che≈Çm≈ºa Cathedral overlooking Old Town On July 22, the bishop also founded the cathedral which was built starting in 1254. Bishop Heidenreich received permissions for his undertakings directly from the pope. Later, in 1255 the four dioceses of Prussia, including the Bishopric of Culm were put under the jurisdiction of the Archbishopric of Riga as metropolitan. In the 1250s Jutta von Sangerhausen came to live in Prussia and settled at Bielczyny. In 1256 she founded the St. George church. It was her wish to be interred at the Culmsee cathedral-church and upon her death in 1260 her wish was granted. The 5th of May is her memorial day. The nearby town of Bielczyny and the cathedral soon became a destination for pilgrims to her shrine. The town witnessed many wars and uprisings. Local Old Prussians staged several sieges and raids. Additionally in the 15th century the town experienced the wars between Teutonic Knights and Poland. In 1410 the Polish army took the town and the bishop of Chelmno Arnold Stapil made a tribute to Polish King Jogaila. In 1422 Che≈Çm≈ºa was taken again by the forces of the king and destroyed in large part. After 1466 the town was integrated into Polish Kingdom. In 1621 and 1627 the city hosted the court of Polish King Sigismund III Vasa along with Prince W≈Çadys≈Çaw. The Swedish wars of 1626‚Äì29 and 1655‚Äì60 brought devastation to the town. In the beginning of the 18th-century Russian, Saxon, Swedish armies went through the area along with supporters of Stanis≈Çaw Leszczy≈Ñski. The constant warfare led to the fall of the city, and its breaking point was reached due a plague that happened in years 1708‚Äì1710. A next series of wars in 1733‚Äì1735 and in 1756‚Äì1763 along with fire in 1762 almost completely destroyed the city. After first Partition of Poland on 15 September 1772 Che≈Çm≈ºa was taken over by Kingdom of Prussia.At that time it counted only 600 inhabitants. In 1807 till 1815 it became part of Duchy of Warsaw only to be taken over by Prussia again after 1815 and Congress of Vienna. The city population in 1831 counted 1,200 people and in 1871 3,000. Its economic situation improved as it became an economic center for local villages benefited with good soil. During the Spring of Nations in 1848 Polish patriotism reinvigorated. Circle of Polish League was established and Polish newspaper \\"Biedaczek\\" is being distributed in the years 1849‚Äì1850 by Julian Prejs. Copernicus Street in Che≈Çm≈ºa In 1866 ‚ÄúTowarzystwo Rolniczo-Przemys≈Çowe‚Äù is created, an association dealing in industry and agriculture. In 1879 a regional court is established in Che≈Çm≈ºa. Two banks and school are established as well. Jews, who made up 8% of local population, built in the 1880s a synagogue. The industrial development was increased and agricultural manufacturing plant and railway terminal were completed in 1882. The population rose as well from 3,400 in 1880, 8,987 in 1900, and 10,600 in 1910. In 1869 a local church choir ‚ÄúCecylia‚Äù was founded, which exists to this day. Around 1900, the town formed a language island of Swabian German. The development of the city was stopped due to the First World War. The living conditions declined and street riots became widespread. Poles rose up against Germanisation and protests were made against forced teaching in schools in German language. On 8 January 1919 local Poles attacked a Grenzschutz unit but were repelled. In revenge the Germans shelled the town by artillery, and 7 random citizens were killed. Additionally several people were arrested upon suspicion of leading the protests. Marketplace On 21 January as result of Treaty of Versailles, Che≈Çm≈ºa became part of Poland again. A part of the German population was deported (2000 people). The population now counted 98% Poles, 1.8% Germans, 0.2% Jews. The overall number of Che≈Çm≈ºa citizens rose from 10,700 in 1921 to 13,000 in 1939. After the Great Depression in 1929 wages became lower and unemployment rose. National Democrats and at the second place socialists led by Stanis≈Çaw Nehring became the main parties in Che≈Çm≈ºa. ‚ÄúGazeta Che≈Çm≈ºy≈Ñska‚Äù and ‚ÄúG≈Ços Che≈Çm≈ºy≈Ñski‚Äù were two papers distributed in the city. The mayor of the city was Bronis≈Çaw Kurzƒôtkowski from 1920 to 1933 and Wiktor Barwicki from 1933 till 1939. After German invasion of Poland, extermination of the local Jewish population started. German state at the time considered Jews to be untermenschen and planned their eradication as national groups, including Poles. To escape this fate many locals took the III and IV group of Volksliste. As result of German repressions the population of the city declined to 10,000 in March 1945. In January 1945 the Red Army took Che≈Çm≈ºa, thus ending the German occupation. Soviet repressions followed and 600 people of German descent were deported to Siberia. The losses inflicted by German occupation regarding the population were gradually reversed and in 1980 Che≈Çm≈ºa counted 15,000 inhabitants.

Pelplin is located in the ethnocultural region of Kociewie in Pomerania. It is home to one of the finest collections of medieval art in Poland held at the Diocesan Museum in PelplinDiocesan Museum in Pelplin. Homepage.. It is known for the landmark Gothic Pelplin Cathedral, former abbey church, one of the largest Gothic churches in Poland. The former Pelplin Abbey is the seat of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pelplin. The cathedral complex, with the abbey, theological seminary, Corpus Christi church, Episcopal Palace and Park, etc. is listed as a Historic Monument of Poland, as one of the most precious Polish heritage sites of its kind.  Geographical location  Pelplin lies in a valley on both sides of river Wierzyca, a left affluent of river Vistula in Pomeralia, which ends up in the Vistula at the town of Gniew. Pelplin is located about west of the Vistula, south-east of the town of Starogard Gda≈Ñski, south-west the town of Tczew and south of the regional capitol of Gda≈Ñsk. It is surrounded by a chain of little hills, its altitude varies between above sea level at the lowlands of the Vistula in the east and above sea level at 'Czubatka' hill in the west.  History  Pelplin Cathedral, cathedral of the former monastery of the Cistercians (1274‚Äì1819) Archaeological findings have revealed that human settlements existed in the region of the town already during the Stone Age and the Bronze Age. The history of Pelplin is tightly interwoven with the history of the Monastery of Pelplin, which according to the monastery's chronicle was founded in 1274 by Mestwin II, Duke of Pomerania. The monastery of Pelplin had a forerunner in the monastery of the Cistercians in Pogutken located at the upper course of the Wierzyca, which had been founded in 1258 by Sambor II, Duke of Pomerania. In 1276 the monks, which had come from the Monastery of Doberan in Mecklenburg to Pogutken, begun to transfer their monastery to Pelplin. From Pelplin, the German monks organized an extensive settlement campaign. They brought in dispossessed farmers and craftsmen and founded a number of German villages in the area. The initiative came from Duke Sambor II, who wanted to compensate population losses of the past, which had occurred because of wars with Pomeralia's neighbours, the Kingdom of Poland in the south and the Old Prussians in the east. During the 12th century, Polish dukes gained control over Pomeralia. The monks also begun to build an impressive Gothic cathedral, now the Pelplin Abbey, using mainly bricks as construction material. According to the monastery's chronicle, work on the building was taken up already prior to 1294 by Mestwin II, Duke of Pomerania, and was completed during the second half of the 14th century, amounting to a building time of almost 200 years. The monastery was attached to the southern side of the cathedral. It was enlarged considerably during subsequent centuries. The cathedral of the Cistercians, now Pelplin Abbey, is recognized as one of the most important examples of sacral architecture in the Vistula region. As far as matters concerning the church were concerned, the region of Pelplin was at that time subordinated to the administration of the Diocese of Gniezno. Pelplin was part of the Duchy of Pomerania (Eastern/Gda≈Ñsk Pomerania), which in 1227 separated from Poland as a result of the fragmentation of the state. In 1282, Duke Mestwin II and Polish Duke Przemys≈Ç II (future King of Poland) signed the Treaty of Kƒôpno, which transferred the suzerainty over Gda≈Ñsk Pomerania including Pelplin to Przemys≈Ç II and, subsequently, after Mestwin II's death in 1294, Pelplin was reintegrated with Poland. In 1310 the Teutonic Order captured Gda≈Ñsk Pomerania and incorporated it into the monastic State of the Teutonic Order. In 1454, Polish King Casimir IV Jagiellon signed the act of re-incorporation of the territory to the Kingdom of Poland, and in the Second Peace of Thorn of 1466, the Teutonic Knights renounced any claims to the region, and recognized it as part of Poland.Karol G√≥rski, ZwiƒÖzek Pruski i poddanie siƒô Prus Polsce: zbi√≥r tekst√≥w ≈∫r√≥d≈Çowych, Instytut Zachodni, Pozna≈Ñ, 1949, p. 88-90, 206-207 (in Polish and Latin) Pelplin was since part of the Pomeranian Voivodeship in the autonomous province of Royal Prussia in the Greater Poland Province of the Polish Crown. In the following centuries several Polish Kings visited the Pelplin Abbey, among them Sigismund III Vasa and John III Sobieski. During the reformation, the last abbot of the monastery of Doberan moved in 1552 to the affiliated monastery of Pelplin. Partitions of Poland Late 18th-century view of the Pelplin Abbey In 1772, during the First Partition of Poland by the Russia, Austria and Prussia, Gda≈Ñsk Pomerania was annexed into the Kingdom of Prussia, in 1773 it was included into the newly formed province West Prussia, composed from just annexed Polish territory, and the religious and political discrimination of the Poles greatly intensified.Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Online (2008), Poland. History > The Commonwealth > Reforms, agony, and partitions. The First 1772 Partition. In 1819 the Pelplin monastery was suppressed. After the monastic buildings had been modified, they were utilized since 1824 as the seat of the Bishopric of Che≈Çmno (Culm), which was moved to Pelplin. By that time Pelplin had remained a small village with several pubs. Since 1824 it begun to develop rapidly due to the accommodation of a number of ecclesiastical and clerical institutions. In 1238 a training school for priests was founded, and since 1835 there existed also the Collegium Marianum, an episcopal Progymnasium. The economical development of Pelplin accelerated after 1852, when the village was connected to the new railway line Bydgoszcz‚ÄîGda≈Ñsk (Bromberg‚ÄîDanzig). In 1905 there existed in addition a supreme forestry superintendent's office, an engineering-works and a sugar factory.Meyers Gro√ües Konversations-Lexikon,6th edition, Vol. 15, Leipzig and Vienna 1908, p. 554. Up to 1920 Pelplin belonged to Kreis Dirschau in the administrative district of Regierungsbezirk Danzig in West Prussia. Return to independence After World War I Poland regained independence, and as a consequence of Treaty of Versailles the Pelplin was re-integrated into the Second Republic of Poland. In 1925 the bishopric of Che≈Çmno was renamed as bishopric of Pelplin. In 1931, Pelplin received town rights. World War II In 1939, after the invasion of Poland, which started World War II, Gda≈Ñsk Pomerania was annexed by Nazi Germany and incorporated into the newly formed province of Reichsgau Danzig- West Prussia. During the German occupation, the Polish population was subjected to mass arrests, repressions, deportations to Nazi concentration camps, expulsions and massacres. Mass arrests especially pertained to Polish teachers and clergy, and were carried out in September and October 1939.Maria Wardzy≈Ñska, By≈Ç rok 1939.

It is located in Park Street, north off Jesus Lane. The theatre is owned by the Cambridge University Amateur Dramatic Club (CUADC), but is currently run as the smallest department of the university, with four full-time and two part-time staff. It is a producing theatre with the CUADC as its resident company. The auditorium seats 228 audience members. The auditorium seating was replaced in summer 2008, and the rows are fairly evenly stepped from row A up to row P (with entrances at row A ‚Äì step-free from the street, via a passenger lift ‚Äì and row J). The theatre has a bar, which opens 45 minutes before shows and often stays open until approximately 2am. The bar is famous for its cocktails themed around the current week's show. History When the CUADC was formed in 1855, its performances took place in rented rooms in the Hoop Hotel on Jesus Lane. By 1882, the club members had raised sufficient funds to buy the freehold. This building was subsequently developed into the ADC Theatre over an extended period of time. In 1933, there was a disastrous fire, which gutted the building. The theatre was quickly rebuilt to a design by Harold Tomlinson and W. P. Dyson, reopening in 1935.The New A.D.C. Theatre, Cambridge. Harold Tomlinson and W. P. Dyson, architects. The Architect and Building News, vol. 141, pages 134‚Äì136, 25 January 1935. The building was not changed again substantially until the redevelopment programme that started in 2002. The theatre was run by the CUADC until the club ran into financial difficulties in 1974 when the University of Cambridge began to lease the premises from the CUADC and run the theatre, an arrangement that continues to this day. Many famous actors and comedians acted in the theatre at the start of their careers, including Sir Ian McKellen, Tony Church, Emma Thompson, Sir Derek Jacobi, Dan Stevens, Rebecca Hall, Stephen Fry, Hugh Laurie, Hattie Morahan, Tom Hollander, Tilda Swinton, Jan Ravens, Julie Covington, Tom Hiddleston, Eddie Redmayne, Richard Ayoade, Ellie Nunn, Liam Williams, David Mitchell, Robert Webb, Phil Wang, Simon Bird and Joe Thomas. Among famous directors to have gained early experience there are Sir Peter Hall, Sir Trevor Nunn and Sam Mendes. Viral comedian Ken Cheng performed multiple times at the ADC Theatre in his early career. In 2011, the ADC Theatre took over the management of the Corpus Playroom, the theatre space of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge. Redevelopment In 2002, a redevelopment appeal was launched to improve the building. The bar had been refurbished in summer 2000, prior to the appeal being launched. In summer 2003, the first phase of the redevelopment was undertaken. This phase resulted in no visible change to the theatre's facilities, as it consisted of necessary work to underpin the building and move services such as water and gas in preparation for the next phase. In 2004, major modifications to the public areas of the theatre were undertaken. A new toilet block was constructed on an area that was part of the theatre's yard. A large amount of the ground floor was remodelled, resulting in an enlarged foyer and new box office for the public, and new management offices, clubroom, production office and backstage kitchen. The theatre's facade was also completely changed. In summer 2005, a lift was installed to give disabled access to the bar and auditorium. In addition, a corridor was constructed to give audience access to both sides of the auditorium. A bar extension and bar roof terrace were constructed on top of the toilet block built in the previous phase. The installation of the lift meant that the previous ladder access to the lighting and sound boxes could no longer be used. The lighting and sound boxes were rebuilt to allow access to them from the lift. A later phase, during the summer of 2008, concentrated on the backstage areas: new dressing rooms, a new set workshop, a soundproof rehearsal room, and a green room. Offices for the Theatre's full-time staff and resources for those producing shows were rearranged and expanded. Additionally, the auditorium floor was rebuilt and new seating installed, increasing audience comfort and providing a better view of the stage from all seats. The Theatre reopened after the final phase in October 2008 with a Gala Celebration event, at which a number of theatre alumni were present including Peter Hall and Trevor Nunn. In the summer of 2018, the theatre again closed for renovations. Air conditioning and new seating were installed to the auditorium, a small extension was made to office space, and additional points for rigging lights were installed. Shows During the term-time of Cambridge University, there are normally two shows per night: a Mainshow starting at 7:45pm and a Lateshow starting at 11pm. On Tuesdays, the late slot is normally filled by a one-night show that can range from comedy (such as Smokers produced by the Cambridge Footlights) to \\"fringe\\" drama such as original writing. This format is subject to change, and notably performances often take place in the theatre bar on Sunday evenings. Outside term-time, the theatre often holds one show per week, and closes for periods during the summer and, to a lesser extent, the Christmas and Easter holidays. These closures allow essential maintenance work to be undertaken in the theatre. Groups that frequently use the theatre During term-time, Cambridge University drama societies such as CUADC, Footlights and CUMTS use the theatre, as well as college drama societies. Outside term-time, the theatre is typically used by drama societies based in the city of Cambridge such as BAWDS, the Combined Actors of Cambridge and WriteOn.

History Biala Rawska is one of the oldest Slavic settlements of historic Mazovia. In the 12th century, it probably was an administrative center and the seat of a castellan, but first written document which confirms the existence of Bela, as it was called, comes from 1246. The gord of Bela was protected by a wooden rampart, as it did not have a defensive wall. The castellany of Bela was in the 14th century transferred to Rawa Mazowiecka. It is not known when Biala Rawska received town charter, but it happened before 1498. At that time, the town was property of Bishops of Chelm, and was an important administrative center, seat of Biala County of Rawa Voivodeship. Located along busy merchant trails to Mazovian Czersk, Leczyca and Sandomierz, Biala prospered. Good times ended in the 1650s, during the disastrous Swedish invasion of Poland, after which the population of Biala was reduced to only 100 people. The town never recovered from Swedish destruction: in 1777, its population was only 186. In 1870, following January Uprising, Biala lost its town charter, recovering it in 1925. In 1900, the population was over 2,000, with a significant Jewish element. In 1921, Biala's population was 2328, with 38% Poles and 61% Jews. During World War II, Biala lost 1,800 people. That includes almost all of the approximately 1200 Jews who lived there in 1939. During the war, the Jews were brualized, robbed, and, beginning fall, 1941, forced to live in a ghetto. Six or seven families shared each room and as a consequence there were epidemics of typhus and other diseases. Around ten people a day died in the ghetto. In August 1942, German and Polish police surrounded the ghetto and forced Jews into trains destined for Treblinka. At Treblinka, all were murdered immediately by gassing. Perhaps a literal handful of Biala Rawska's Jews survived the Holocaust.

It is served by Paris M√©tro stations Invalides, Varenne, and La Tour-Maubourg. The Mus√©e de l'Arm√©e was created in 1905 with the merger of the Mus√©e d'Artillerie and the Mus√©e Historique de l'Arm√©e. The museum's seven main spaces and departments contain collections that span the period from antiquity through the 20th century. History The Mus√©e de l'Arm√©e was created in 1905 with the merger of the Mus√©e d'Artillerie and the Mus√©e Historique de l'Arm√©e. The Mus√©e de l'artillerie (Museum of Artillery - \\"artillerie\\" meaning all things related to weapons) was founded in 1795 in the aftermath of the French Revolution, and expanded under Napoleon. It was moved into the H√¥tel des Invalides in 1871, immediately following the Franco-Prussian War and the proclamation of the Third Republic. Another institution called the Mus√©e historique de l'Arm√©e (Historical Museum of the Army) was created in 1896 following the Paris World Fair. The two institutions merged in 1905 within the space of the former Mus√©e de l'Artillerie. Today, it holds 500,000 artifacts, including weapons, armour, artillery, uniforms, emblems and paintings, exhibited in an area of 12,000 m¬≤. The permanent collections are organised into \\"historical collections\\", representing a chronological tour from ancient times through the end of World War II. In March 1878, the museum hosted an \\"ethnographic exhibition\\", as it was called, which represented the main \\"types\\" of Oceania, America, Asia and Africa. Dummies representing people from the colonies, along with weapons and equipment, were the main attraction. The exhibit, organised by Colonel Le Clerc, attempted to demonstrate theories of unilineal evolution, putting the European man at the apex of human history.Gilles Aubagnac, \\"En 1878, les \\"sauvages\\" entrent au mus√©e de l'Arm√©e\\" in Zoos humains.

All remnants were transferred after the Second World War. Significant holdings The Mus√©e de l'Arm√©e has identified 24 aesthetic, technical and symbolic \\"treasures,\\" which are all closely linked to French military history from the late Middle Ages through to World War II. They include weapons, armour, works of arts and technology. Main spaces The museum consists of six main spaces.

About 100 models, created between 1668 and 1870, are currently on display in the museum. The construction of models dates to 1668 when the Marquis de Louvois, minister of war to Louis XIV, began a collection of three-dimensional models of fortified cities for military purposes, and kept growing until 1870 with the disappearance of fortifications bastionn√©es. Cathedral of Saint-Louis des Invalides Interior of Cathedral of Saint-Louis des Invalides In 1676, the Secretary of State for War, Marquis de Louvois, entrusted the young architect Jules Hardouin-Mansart with the construction of the chapel, which Lib√©ral Bruant had been unable to complete. The architect designed a building which combined a royal chapel, the \\"D√¥me des Invalides\\", and a veterans' chapel. This way, the King and his soldiers could attend mass simultaneously, while entering the place of worship though different entrances, as prescribed by etiquette. This separation was reinforced in the 19th century with the erection of the tomb of Napoleon I, the creation of the two separate altars and then with the construction of a glass wall between the two chapels.

Members  All members of NeXT were French, with one notable exception, Lem, who came from Belgium. The individuals who joined the group in historical order are: * Zae (Said Hadjiat) - founding member, public relations specialist and diskmag editor * Stwars (Alexis Roos) - coder * Pulsar (Jean Fran√ßois Nebbia) - graphic artist * PCP - graphic artist * Mit (Olivier Lhermite) - coder * Dbug (Micka√´l Pointier) - coder, graphic artist * FFT (Richard Perdriau) - musician, coder * Chromix (Emmanuel Couross√©) - graphic artist, musician, coder * LAP (Emmanuel Lary) - musician * Lem (Thomas Gonzales) - coder * Lonewolf (Xavier Dugast) - coder Like many other in demoscene, some NeXT members later joined the video game industry and successfully applied their skills on a number of games: Little Big Adventure, Time Commando, Hexplore, The Smurfs, Asterix & Obelix, V-Rally, Arabian Nights, Road Rash, Need for Speed, The Suffering, Iron Storm, Kya, Fifa, Bet on Soldier, Test Drive, Age of Conan. (See MobyGames links above for the respective personnel.)  Production history  NeXT created a large number of productions: some demo screens were guest entries in other groups demos, the well known 'Charts' were released in the Floppy Disc Magazine Maggie, and some productions were real independent demos. The Charts The whole concept of The Charts was an idea of Zae who wanted the group to become well-known very fast. His idea was simple: The English group The Lost Boys was in the process of creating the first issue of what will become one of the most successful disk magazines on Atari: Maggie. Considering that The Lost Boys were one of the most talented active groups, it was probably a good idea to \\"jump the bandwagon\\", and participate in the creation of this disk magazine; doing the charts was a simple way to achieve this goal. Six charts were produced in total, but they can hardly be linked to individual issues of Maggie: Production delays were extremely fluctuant on NeXT side, due first to the fact that the group was spread all around France, exchanging data using floppies sent my mail, and second because NeXT had to communicate with The Lost Boys over the channel also using postal mail. In 1991 a demo called The Official 1990 Charts Compilation was released, containing an entirely repackaged version of all Charts demo screens and additional material, including a teaser screen of the Phaleon Giga Demo.  The Phaleon Giga Demo  Review of the Phaleon Giga Demo in the ST Format magazine. The Phaleon Giga Demo was probably one of the demos with the longest development process in the Atari ST demo history. It was originally started by The Replicants in 1989, and was supposed to include many demoscreens by their friends of The Union. Unfortunately for various reasons they failed to finish it, and decided to abandon the project in 1990. NeXT decided to give a try, and collected all the assets that had been produced so far. This included logos, demo screens, and a half finished main menu. Considering the state of the project, it was decided to keep only the name, some graphics, and the finished demo screens: Everything else was written from scratch. After two additional years of work, and despite the drawbacks (some groups decided not to wait and released their intros earlier) the demo was finally finished and released, even managing to get some attention from the media. Even though the quality of the whole demo suffered from the fact, that some of its content was nearly three years old, the Phaleon Giga Demo managed to remain in the collections of classic Atari ST demos, because it managed to somewhat push the envelope. It was the first demo on the Atari ST to require four floppy discs (hence the Giga in the name instead of more common Mega, which was used to distinguish the two floppy disc demos from single disc ones). It contained four different selection menus (an Amiga-like trackloader, a simple list selector, a Dungeon Master-clone and a Shadow of the Beast-clone). It was one of the first demos that tried to exploit the Atari STE, (all palettes are compatible with the enhanced color palette, all soundtracks are enhanced on the STE), including the Illusion STE screen (still considered today as a landmark in the STE intro history). Guest entries In addition to The Charts and the Phaleon Giga Demo, a number of single demo screens have been made as guest participation to some other group mega-demos: *Syntax Terror by Delta Force, 1990 *NTM Mega demo by Zuul, 1991 *European Demos by The Overlanders, 1991 Notes Appearance in media: # Reviewed in the ST Format magazine, Issue 38, September 1992 # Double page feature in the TILT Microloisirs magazine, issue 105, September 1992, pages 46‚Äì47 # Shown in Micro Kids, a French TV show, as the Demo of the Week (summer 1992).

Usually credited under the name John Leslie, he also worked under a variety of pseudonyms, including John Leslie Dupre, Frederick Watson, and Lenny Lovely. Along with Ron Jeremy, Jamie Gillis, John Holmes, and Harry Reems, Leslie was one of the stalwart male stars of the Golden Age of Porn, when blue movies had narratives, higher quality production values, and distribution in some legitimate movie houses. After Holmes experienced setbacks due to drug and legal problems, Leslie inherited the mantle of the porn industry's top male superstar with the success of Talk Dirty To Me in 1980. He eventually starred in over 600 porn films before making the transition to director. Early life Leslie was born into an Italian-American family in East Liverpool, Ohio on January 25, 1945. He grew up in the Midland area of Beaver County, Pennsylvania. After graduating from high school, he worked at Crucible Steel Company before moving to New York to attend Art Students League of New York. After finishing art school, he joined the band Brooklyn Blues Busters, where he played harmonica and sang. Later the band relocated to Michigan. In 1973, the band played at the Ann Arbor Blues and Jazz Festival with Victoria Spivey. Career In the mid 1970s, Leslie relocated to the Mill Valley area in California and began performing in adult films. His first film was Coming Attractions. He was a performer in almost 300 adult films and won numerous awards during his days as a performer. He appeared with some of the era's most noted porn stars, including fellow Ohioans Traci Lords and John \\"Johnny Wadd\\" Holmes, Seka, Kay Parker, and Annette Haven. His most noteworthy roles were in Obsessed (1977), Desires Within Young Girls (1977), A Coming of Angels (1977), Dracula Sucks (aka Lust At First Bite) (1978), Pretty Peaches (1979), The Ecstasy Girls (1979), Nothing To Hide (1981), and Talk Dirty To Me, Part II (1982). He was one of the first porn actors to make the transition from performing to directing, beginning with 1987's Nightshift Nurses. Since then he directed more than 90 adult movies, including The Chameleon (1989), Curse of the Catwoman (1992), Dog Walker (1994), and Drop Sex (1997), along with the Voyeur' ', Fresh Meat, and Crack Her Jack series. He won many awards for his work behind the cameras as well. Though much of his later work, in keeping with current trends in adult video, was in the gonzo genre, such as the \\"Fresh Meat\\" and \\"Crack Her Jack\\" series, Leslie continued to make feature films, or \\"sex dramas\\"; most recently, in 2007 he directed the film Brianna Love, Her Fine, Sexy Self.''

In Australia, it is known as the Sydney rock oyster and is commercially farmed. In New Zealand, where the species is not farmed, it is known as the New Zealand rock oyster or Auckland oyster. The species is closely related to Saccostrea cucullata, the hooded oyster, which is common on Indo-Pacific rocky shores. Sydney rock oysters are capable of tolerating a wide range of salinities (halotolerant). They are usually found in the intertidal zone to below the low-water mark.  Taxonomy  The Sydney rock oyster and New Zealand rock oyster have previously been classified as two separate species: Saccostrea commercialis and S. glomerata, respectively. (paywall) They have also been grouped with the hooded oyster into a single species, S. cucullata. When proposing the name Ostrea commercialis in 1933, Iredale & Roughley noted that the New South Wales oyster had been variously referred to species O. cucullata Born (Ascension Island), O. mordax Gould (Fiji), O. glomerata Gould (New Zealand), O. circumsuta Gould (Fiji); and even to O. trigonata Sowerby and O. mytiloides Lamarck. Distribution In Australia it is found in bays, inlets and sheltered estuaries from Wingan Inlet in eastern Victoria, along the east coast of New South Wales, and north to Hervey Bay, Queensland, around northern Australia and south along the west coast to Shark Bay in Western Australia. The spat for these oysters travels down the east coast of Australia on the East Australia Current. Also, a small population exists on the islands in the Furneaux archipelago in Bass Strait, and in Albany on the south west coast of Western Australia, where they are farmed. Breeding Sydney rock oysters are \\"broadcast spawners\\", that is, eggs and sperm are released into open water where fertilisation occurs. Within hours of fertilisation, the eggs develop into free-swimming planktonic larvae. The larvae swim in estuarine and coastal waters for up to three weeks, during which they develop transparent shells and retractable feet. The larvae then settle on clean substrates using their feet to find suitable sites. The larval foot is resorbed once the larva is attached. The shell darkens and the small animal takes on the appearance of an adult oyster. Growth rates vary with local conditions, but they generally reach in three years. Sydney rock oysters may change sex during life. Many start out as males and later change to females. About 60% of prime eating oysters are female. Selective breeding has reduced the time to market size from three to two years. Great success in selection for disease resistance to two protozoan diseases of oysters, namely, QX disease Marteilia sydneyi and winter mortality Bonamia roughleyi, has been achieved. Oysters are filter feeders, straining planktonic algae from the water. Birds, fish, stingrays, mud crabs, and starfish all eat Sydney rock oysters, with the Australian pied oystercatcher being particularly fond of them. Commercial industry A substantial commercial oyster farming industry is found in New South Wales and southern Queensland, with a small, emerging industry in Albany, Western Australia. The industry produces a gourmet product and provides employment in isolated coastal communities. In Australia, oysters in peak flesh condition (i.e. spawning condition) are preferred for the half- shell trade. Consumption Commercially-purchased Sydney rock oyster and empty shells. The upper valve is discarded before sale. Sydney rock oysters are best consumed when freshly shucked, but do have a good shelf life when kept whole, of up to 14 days providing they are kept at the correct temperature and handled safely.

By 2010 the cemetery is expected to be at capacity, largely because of deaths due to HIV and AIDS. Culture of burials The standard for large funerals in black South African culture was set in the 1970s and 1980s, during the height of the anti-apartheid struggle. Thousands of students boycotted school, adopted the slogan \\"liberation before education\\" and took to the streets in protest. They inevitably clashed with police, and the death toll grew each week. The funerals for the victims became one of the most powerful expressions of defiance against the apartheid government. More than 10,000 people, some dressed in military fatigues and armed with wooden rifles, would flock to a cemetery to demonstrate their solidarity in the struggle. When there were not enough buses to drive them to the cemetery, the protesters stopped motorists and forced the drivers to give them a lift. By the end of the day, the funerals often generated new victims of the struggle to be buried the next week. Famous burials Avalon Cemetery is noted for a number of famous people interred on its grounds.

Economic effects=Unemployment The economist Milton Friedman, advocate of laissez-faire capitalism, believed that unionization frequently produces higher wages at the expense of fewer jobs, and that, if some industries are unionized while others are not, wages will decline in non- unionized industries.Milton & Rose Friedman, Free to Choose. Chicago Press, 1979 By raising the price of labor, the wage rate, above the equilibrium price, unemployment rises. This is because it is no longer worthwhile for businesses to employ those laborers whose work is worth less than the minimum wage rate set by the unions.Alain Anderton, Economics, Fourth edition Trade unions often benefit insider workers, those having a secure job and high productivity, at the cost of outsider workers, consumers of the goods or services produced, and the shareholders of the unionized business. The ones who are likely to lose the most from a trade union are those who are unemployed or at the risk of unemployment or who are not able to get the job that they want in a particular field.Economics, 16th edition, Samuelson Nordhaus It is argued that over the long term, unions reduce investment in a business, which in turn makes that business less competitive and over the long run will therefore reduce employment in unionized industries. In addition, unions can also cause slower job growth (3 to 4%) for unionized workplaces as opposed to non-unionized workplaces.Sherk, James \\"What Unions Do: How Labor Unions Affect Jobs and the Economy\\", The Heritage Foundation, 21 May 2019, accessed 01/03/19 Unions can also increase jobs losses, with James Sherk arguing that at newly organized workplaces, employment can fall from between 5 and 10%. Sherk notes that some studies find no effect on employment but argues that these tend to focus on workplaces where unionization had little effect of any kind at all, meaning that jobs did not disappear but wages did not rise either, which for Sherk means that these studies cannot be used to argue against unions causing job losses. However, Sherk also argues that there is no evidence that unions increase the risk of bankruptcy for unionized firms, noting that unions try to avoid ruining the companies they organize at and will make concessions to keep distressed firms afloat, generally by agreeing to layoffs for newer workers in order to maintain wages for more senior ones. Harm to ununionized labor Advocates of unions claim that the higher wages that unions demand can be paid for through company profits. However, as Milton Friedman pointed out, profits are only very rarely high enough. 80% of national income is wages, and only about 6% is profits after tax, providing very little room for higher wages, even if profits could be totally used up. Moreover, profits are invested leading to an increase in capital: which raises the value of labor, increasing wages. If profits were totally removed, this source of wage increase would be removed.Milton & Rose Friedman, Free to Choose, 1979 According to The New York Times, wages in 2012 fell to a record low of 43.5 percent of GDP. Efficiency Friedrich Hayek argued that the effect of union activities to influence pricing is potentially very harmful, making the market system ineffective.F. A. Hayek, The Constitution of Liberty, 1960 Routledge Classics James Sherk argues that unions generally reduce a business's profits by about 10 to 15%, though Sherk notes this is more common in firms that have a competitive advantage (it is hard for unions to reduce profits in a competitive market), as this means these firms have higher than normal profitability, so this redistribution does not risk scaring away investors. However, reducing business profits does reduce the money available for a business to launch new investments. Unions may also hamper recovery from economic recessions and depressions, as they reduce profitability and thus deter the investment required for recovery. James Sherk argues that American states with greater rates of unionization took longer to recover from the 1982 and 1991 recessions, as well as arguing that the unionization that was encouraged under the policies of Franklin D. Roosevelt during the Great Depression actually contributed to reducing the speed of recovery during the period. Cost-push inflation By causing wage increases above the market rate, unions increase the cost to businesses, causing them to raise their prices, leading to a general increase in the price level. Austrian economists such as Robert P. Murphy, however, dispute this, arguing that the increase in the cost of labor simply means that less of other goods can be bought. He writes: > If unions succeed in wage hikes, and employers raise the prices they charge > consumers to maintain their own profit margins, and the supply of money > remains the same, then something else has to \\"give.\\" Either the prices of > goods and services in nonunion sectors have to fall and offset the union > sector hikes, or people's cash balances need to fall, in terms of their > purchasing power. Corruption Some trade unions, such as the Teamsters, have been criticized for involvement with organized crime. General response to economic arguments The argument that unionized workers raise their own wages above their natural rate at the expense of their businesses or other workers assumes that unions never raise productivity to compensate for higher wages. Unions are capable of raising productivity by reducing turnover, by increasing coordination between workers and management, and by increasing workers' motivation. Many unions raise the productivity of their workers, and some even raise it enough to make up for wage increases. Another argument raised by union supporters is that unionized workers will spend their higher wages, driving economic growth and creating new jobs. Union opponents respond that this is an example of the broken window fallacy; union supporters assume that money is more valuable in the hands of unionized workers than in the hands of whoever else would obtain it in the union's absence. There is some evidence that this is not a fallacy, as greater wealth equality seems to be correlated with greater economic growth.Andrew Berg and Jonathan D. Ostry, 2011, \\"Inequality and Unsustainable Growth: Two Sides of the Same Coin?\\" IMF Staff Discussion Note SDN/11/08, International Monetary Fund Union supporters counter that unions, if organized without violence or government help, are part of the free market; if unions can win higher wages for their workers without coercion, those wages are legitimate.http://c4ss.org/wp- content/uploads/2010/09/C4SS-Labor.pdf Research indicates that unions may reduce the risk of a stock price crash for a business by deterring risk-taking and over-investment, as well as increasing information transparency.Kim, Jeong-Bon and Zhang, Eliza Xia and Zhong, Kai, The Bright Side of Unionization: The Case of Stock Price Crash Risk (May 25, 2019). Available at SSRN Social disruption Trade unions take strike actions that result in the disruption of public serviceshttp://journals.sfu.ca/archivar/index.php/archivaria/article/viewFile/10489/11328 ‚Äì as demonstrated in the 1978‚Äì79 British Winter of Discontent. However, where applicable, this may be logically inferred to be the very purpose of strike action per se. In some cases, unions' strike have led to violent clashes with police and with strikebreakers. See the article on the UK miners' strike of the 1980s. Challenges from affirmative action perspectives=Racist policies in the past A consequence of unions' zeal to guard their special interests is that some unions have actively lobbied for racist and anti- immigration policies. An example is the creation of the notorious Asiatic Exclusion League, which was composed mainly of the various labor unions. The Pictorial History of American Labor observes, > The early A.F. of L. did not draw the color line, but expressed an \\"ideal of > solidarity irrespective of race.\\" Before long, however, the feeling changed. > Whether a tendency to exclude black workers from craft unions was based more > on fear of competition or racial prejudice carried over from slave days, it > is difficult to decide.

This > availability has usually ended when the black worker has been shown that the > union is open to black as well as white.A Pictorial History of American > Labor, William Cahn, 1972, p. 160. However, in a study called The Black Worker, Spero and Harris observe that more strikes [in American labor history] have been broken by white workers than by black workers. Most blacks were barred from membership in the AFL not because of their skin color, but because they never had a chance to learn a skill, and \\"most A.F. of L. unions did not admit unskilled mass-production workers.\\"A Pictorial History of American Labor, William Cahn, 1972, p. 231. While the AFL-CIO is the modern version of the AFL, it is much more open to membership by women, immigrants, and different nationalities. Other unions, such as the Industrial Workers of the World and the International Longshore and Warehouse Union, were created without regard to race from the very start.Solidarity Forever ‚Äì An oral history of the IWW, Stewart Bird, Dan Georgakas, Deborah Shaffer, 1985, p. 140.  Government  Illegal union firing increased during the Reagan administration and has continued since.\\"Why America Needs Unions\\", BusinessWeek Specific countries, especially undemocratic countries, while still having unions in name, do not allow for independent trade unions, just as they rarely allow for independent businesses. These state-run trade unions do not function in the same way as independent trade unions and generally do not hold any kind of collective bargaining power, acting to ensure the smooth running of Government industry. Attempts to reduce the effects of trade unions may include union busting activities by private companies or state action including governments of authoritarian regimes such as in Adolf Hitler's Nazi Germany and Burma's military dictator, Ne Win. Many democratic governments have also attempted to limit the effects of unions, although success has been mixed. It has been argued, particularly by market anarchists, that government intervention in the economy has been decidedly anti-union, even in economies like the United States or the European Union. Kevin Carson maintains that the most effective union tactics are either criminalized or displaced by state policy in most countries. Trade unions established themselves through sitdown strikes, sympathy strikes, secondary boycotts, and hot cargo agreements; these tactics are all illegal in most industrialized countries. Similarly, the original unions doubled as social welfare organization, using union funds to provide healthcare and pensions to workers and welfare to the unemployed. By adopting various welfare-state measures, governments made the populace less dependent on unions. Left critiques of trade unionism anarcho-syndicalist flyer exhorting workers to \\"Give Union Bosses the Flick!\\" The political left is often associated with support for trade unionism. However, some groups and individuals have taken a less positive view. In the nineteenth century, a belief in the iron law of wages led some socialists to reject trade unionism and strike action as ineffective. In this view, any increase in wages would lead manufacturers to raise prices leaving workers no better off in real terms. Karl Marx wrote a pamphlet, \\"Wages, Price and Profit\\", to counter this idea, which had been put forward in the International Workingmen's Association by a follower of Robert Owen. Some early Social Democrats were also skeptical of trade unionism. Usual criticisms were that unions split workers into sections rather than organising them as a class; that they were dominated by relatively privileged skilled workers who were mainly concerned to defend their sectional interests; and that industrial action and organisation were incapable of bringing about fundamental social change. H. M. Hyndman of the Social Democratic Federation summed up some of these views when he wrote in The Historical Basis of Socialism in England (1883): :\\"Trade Unions ... constitute an aristocracy of labour who [are] ... a hindrance to that complete organisation of the proletariat which alone can obtain for the workers their proper control over their own labour ... Being also ... unsectarian and unpolitical, they prevent any organised attempt being made by the workers as a class to form a definite party of their own, apart from existing factions, with a view to dominate the social conditions ‚Äì a victory which ... can only be gained by resolute political action.\\" Hyndman went on to urge workers to devote \\"the Trade Union funds wasted on strikes or petty funds\\" instead to the building up of a strong Socialist Party on the German model. Other social democrats however were more convinced than Hyndman of the utility of Trade Union action. Trade unionism is criticised by those of council communist and left communist tendencies.\\"Unions Against the Working Class\\", International Communist Current http://en.internationalism.org/pamphlets/unions.htm Here, trade unionism is seen as being more useful to capitalists than to workers, and as a kind of \\"safety-valve\\" that helps to keep working-class discontent within reformist channels and prevent it from evolving into revolutionary action. They consider a global state composed of workers' councils to be the ultimate union to which all workers in the world belong; unions that organize based on trade further divide the working class and act as a mechanism to allow the working class to vent concerns without actually uniting and becoming revolutionary. In contrast to other left critiques of trade unionism, these tendencies do not accept that the problems they identify could be remedied by changing the structure, leadership or objectives of trade unions. They argue that trade unionism is inherently reformist because it is sectarian and is not founded in the workplace itself and that revolutionary action is possible only if workers act outside trade unionism through workers' councils or other channels. There is also a philosophical difference between the craft unionism of many AFL-type unions, and the industrial unionism of organizations such as the Industrial Workers of the World. Industrial unionists decry a practice that they call \\"union scabbing,\\" in which craft unionists are required by the no-strike clause in their contracts to cross the picket lines of other unions.Roughneck: The Life and Times of Big Bill Haywood. Peter Carlson, 1983, p. 80. There is also the left critique of the tendencies of some labor unions to become bureaucratic and for the union leaders and staff to become detached from the needs and interests of the rank and file union members, in contrast to the practices of union democracy. The Labor Notes, in the United States, is an example of an organization that attempts to fight this bureaucratic tendency.

It is very soluble in water. Uranyl fluoride also is hygroscopic and changes in color from brilliant orange to yellow after reacting with water. Uranyl fluoride is reported to be stable in air to 300 ¬∞C, above which slow decomposition to U3O8 occurs. When heated to decomposition, UO2F2 emits toxic fluorine fumes. In accidental releases of UF6, UO2F2, as a solid particulate compound, may deposit on the ground. The overall chemical reaction of this event can be represented as: : UF6 \\\\+ 2 H2O ‚Üí UO2F2 \\\\+ 4 HF. These reactions can take place whether the uranium hexafluoride is a solid or a gas, but will take place almost instantaneously when the UF6 is in a gaseous state. The resulting hydrofluoric acid and the presence of additional water results in formation of solids (primarily hydrofluoric adducts of hydrated uranyl fluoride (UO2F2.\\\\mathit{n}H2O).  Toxicology  Like any other uranium compound, it is radioactive, and precautions should be taken. It is also highly toxic. Uranyl fluoride is corrosive and harmful upon inhalation, ingestion, or skin absorption. Ingestion or inhalation may be fatal. Effects of exposure may be delayed.

History Waterfront records was started in 1982 by Steven Stavrakis who at the time was an employee of another independent label Phantom Records. The first release for Waterfront was the Careless Talk Costs Lives EP by JFK & The Cuban Crisis that was originally submitted to, but rejected by, the Phantom label. Stavrakis heard the recordings and when Phantom passed on it he decided to release it himself. Stavrakis was later joined by Chris Dunn who was instrumental in discovering a number of the acts that appeared on the Waterfront label. Over the next 15 years Waterfront put out over 170 releases. Acts like Tumbleweed and Ratcat who would later have success on the mainstream charts released their first records on Waterfront. Waterfront also licensed some recordings from the Sub Pop label that saw them handling the Australian releases for artist like Nirvana, Henry Rollins, L7 and Tad. The label later spawned a retail shop also called Waterfront that occupied various locations in the Sydney CBD.

Location Drammenselva is one of the largest rivers in Norway, with a drainage basin of about and a discharge of per second. Drammen River's total length is making it the fifth longest river in Norway. Its 48 km course runs from Tyrifjorden in the north to Drammensfjord in the south, where it cuts through the centre of the city of Drammen. The Drammen River gathers inflow from several streams and rivers. The largest include the Simoa River.Drammen River (GoNorway) The whole drainage system which includes the Drammenselva as the lowest part is known as Drammensvassdraget and is located in the provinces of Oppland and Buskerud. Development and usage For centuries the river was used for log driving, transporting timber from the forests in Eiker to the many paper mills and other industry along the river. From the 1850s onwards, many steam-powered sawmills and planing mills were established along the lower section of the river, and products became exports moving through the Port of Drammen. During the 20th century this activity caused the river to be heavily polluted. However, the majority of the paper and pulp factories in Drammen shut down in the 1960s and 1970s, and the river is now clean and safe. On its way to the sea, Drammen River passes a series of rapids and waterfalls. The largest are Vikerfoss, Geithusfoss, Kattfoss, Gravfoss, Embretsfoss, D√∏vikfoss and Hellefoss. There are a number of power plants on the Drammen River several with dams. The owner and operator is EB Kraftproduksjon which is headquartered in Drammen. The power company is owned by Buskerud Energy Power Generation (Energiselskapet Buskerud AS). *Hellefoss has a hydroelectric dam in Hokksund in √òvre Eiker municipality *D√∏vikfoss and Embretsfoss have hydroelectric dams in √Ömot in Modum municipality *Gravfoss and Geithusfoss have hydroelectric power station in Geithus Modum municipality Since then the city of Drammen has spent substantial resources on developing attractive park areas along the riverside. The area between the City and the Holmen bridges in Drammen has also been developed into parkland, and is now known as Bragernes Riverside Park. Hundreds of trees and thousands of perennials have been planted here in order to create a pleasant leisure area. Today Drammenselva is used for recreational purposes, and is known for its excellent salmon fishing. It is the site of the annual Drammen River Festival (Drammen Elvefestival). The festival features music concerts, dragon boats, raft racing and bathtub rowing. More than 100 different events take place during the River Festival.Tourist in the river city of Drammen (Drammen kommune) Drammen the capital of Buskerud (GoNorway) Gallery File:Mj√∂ndalen bru IMG 2928.JPG Mj√∂ndalen bridge on the Drammenselva File:Ypsilon binder sammen Union Brygge med Bragernes.JPGYpsilon bridge betsween Str√∏ms√∏ and Bragernes File:MG Drammenselven og Union Brygge.JPGUnion Brygge area along the Drammenselva File:Bybrua Drammen.JPGBybrua bridge and Bragernes ship pier File:Drammen IMG 3996 √∂vre sund bro.JPG√òvre Sund bridge in Drammen File:Drammen Bragernes IMG 4000.JPG Bragernes along the Drammenselva File:Jernbanebroa i Drammen.jpgJernbanebroa bridge in Drammen ReferencesExternal links *Drammen Elvefestival Category:Rivers of Viken Category:Drammen Category:Rivers of Norway ","title":"Drammenselva"},{"id":"4443570","text":"The National Polytechnic University of Armenia (), is a technical university located in Yerevan, Armenia.

The annual awards recognise achievements in the disciplines of musical theatre, contemporary music, comedy, opera, classical music, theatre, dance and physical theatre. They are named in honour of ballet dancer, choreographer, director and actor Sir Robert Helpmann. Over forty awards are given to productions, festivals and concerts, and for individuals for their work in performance, direction, choreography, lighting, sound, music, costume and scenic design. Non-competitive awards are also presented including the lifetime achievement awards, of the JC Williamson Award, and the Sue Nattress Award, as well as an award for Best Special Event. Background The awards are named after Sir Robert Helpmann (pictured). The Helpmann Awards were established in 2001 by the Australian Entertainment Industry Association (now known as Live Performance Australia (LPA)). They are named in honour of Australian actor, choreographer, dancer and theatre director, Sir Robert Helpmann. The accolade was created to be the Australian equivalent of the Tony Awards for Broadway theatre in the United States, and the Laurence Olivier Awards for West End theatre in the United Kingdom. The aim of the awards is to promote Australia's live entertainment industry, both locally and internationally, by: recognising artistic achievements; administering the awards with integrity; ensuring the awards are celebrated by the industry and Australian community; and ensuring the ceremony is the most prestigious awards in the local industry and the highlight of each season. At the inaugural Helpmann Awards, twenty six accolades were handed out for achievements in performance, direction, choreography, lighting, sound, music, costume and scenic design and production, in the disciplines of musical theatre, contemporary music, comedy, opera, classical music, theatre, dance and physical theatre. Over the years the categories have expanded and now include over forty honours. Special non-competitive prizes are also bestowed upon individuals: the JC Williamson Award (named after theatre manager James Cassius Williamson), for one's life's work in Australia's live entertainment industry and the highest honour presented by Live Performance Australia. Eligibility and voting To be eligible for the Helpmann Awards, a production must: be produced or presented by an LPA Member, or professionally produced by a non-Member that has paid an Industry Service Fee for the production; fall within the artistic or industry award categories; and officially open in Australia during the season (or for Best Regional Touring Production Award, undertake its first Australian regional tour during the season). Exemptions from the entry criteria can be granted in exceptional circumstances by a committee consisting of the LPA president, chief executive and chair of the Helpmann Awards Administration Committee (HAAC). Nine nominating panels determine the nominees for their respective fields. These are: cabaret, children's presentation, comedy, contemporary music, dance and physical theatre, industry awards, musicals, opera and classical music, and theatre. The nominating panels comprises artists, creatives, arts administrators, writers, journalists, producers, promoters, venue managers and educators. The HAAC selects the chair of each panel, who in turn chooses the members of their respective fields. The nominations are then determined by each of them, who choose four per category. The winners are determined in a secret online ballot by the voters who are employees of LPA members, panelists and previous Helpmann winners and nominees.

Its terraced fields are what gives this part of Uganda its distinctive character. Kigezi was popularly known as the Switzerland of Africa. The coordinates for the region are: Latitude:01 13 20S, 29 53 20E. Constituencies Before its division into the districts shown as above, Kigezi consisted of counties of: * Rukiga County, southeast of modern-day Kabale District, which bordered on the then Ankole District. * Ndorwa County, this is the central area of modern-day Kabale District, where Kabale town is still located and Lake Bunyonyi is shared with the county of Rubanda. * Rubanda County, southwest of modern-day Kabale District, bordering Kanungu District and Kisoro District and Kinkizi County, where the famous Nyamasizi Hot Springs are located. * Kinkizi County, northwest of modern-day Kabale District. This county shares its borders with the Democratic Republic of the Congo. It also touches on Lake Edward on the border with DRC * Bufumbira County, southwest of modern-day Kabale District, bordering with Rubanda County, the Republic of Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Bufumbira County is the location of Lake Mutanda and Lake Chahafi. * Rujumbura County, which was the most northerly county of the district and bordered on the former Ankole District and on Lake Edward. After the division of Kigezi into the four (4) current districts, they were named after their respective main towns, namely Kabale, Kanungu, Kisoro and Rukungiri. People The four modern district of the former Kigezi District are inhabited predominantly by the Bakiga, Bahororo, Bafumbira and Banyarwanda people. All these ethnic groups share the same characteristics and traditions. Paul Ngologoza‚Äôs book Kigezi and Its People provides detailed information about the Bakiga people, their traditions and history. The region is uniquely characterized by the Albertine Rift, or Western Rift Valley, and the African Great Lakes, which include Lake Bunyonyi, Lake Edward, Lake Mutanda and Lake Kyahafi. Kigezi is also the home to the chain of volcanic mountains, the Virunga Mountains, located in what is now Kisoro District, and which also form the south-west Uganda border with the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. Located in the Ugandan part of the Virunga Mountains is Mgahinga Gorilla National Park which, along with the nearby Bwindi Impenetrable National Park are home to the internationally famous mountain gorilla populations. The mountains also form part of the watershed between the two major African rivers, the Nile and the Democratic Republic of the Congo, with the highest peak on the Uganda side of the border being Mount Muhabura. In the intervening valleys, often one finds expansive swampy areas, some of which, particularly those in Kabale District, have been reclaimed for pastureland.

After performing his Hajj pilgrimage in 1923, Mirzali Khan settled in Ipi, a village located near Mir Ali in North Waziristan, from where he started his campaign of guerrilla warfare against the British Empire. In 1938, he shifted from Ipi to Gurwek, a remote village in North Waziristan on the border with Afghanistan, where he declared an independent state and continued the raids against the British Empire, using bases in Afghanistan, with the support of Nazi Germany. On 21 June 1947, Faqir Ipi, along with his allies including the Khudai Khidmatgars and members of the Provincial Assembly, declared the Bannu Resolution. The resolution demanded that the Pashtuns be given a third choice to have an independent state of Pashtunistan, composing all Pashtun majority territories of British India, instead of being made to join only either India or Pakistan. The British Raj, however, refused to comply with the demand of this resolution, and no other group in British India was granted a third option. After the creation of Pakistan in August 1947, Afghanistan and India financially sponsored the Pashtunistan movement under the leadership of Faqir Ipi. He continued the guerilla warfare against the new nation‚Äôs government.The Faqir of Ipi of North Waziristan. The Express Tribune. November 15, 2010. However, later on he said that Afghanistan deceived him in the name of Islam. He also instructed his supporters that they should never help Afghanistan with any plan made against Pakistan. He didn't surrender to the government of Pakistan and died a natural death in 1960 in Gurwek.The legendary guerilla Faqir of Ipi unremembered on his 115th anniversary. The Express Tribune. April 18, 2016.  Early life  Mirzali Khan was born in 1897 at Shankai Kirta, a village near Khajuri in the Tochi Valley of North Waziristan, present day Pakistan to Sheikh Arsala Khan Wazir. He belonged to the Torikhel branch of the Utmanzai Wazir tribe. His father died when he was twelve. He studied till fourth grade at a government school and later pursued religious studies at Bannu. He built a mosque and a house at Spalga, further south in North Waziristan agency in 1922. He went to perform Hajj at Mecca and later moved to Ipi in mid 1920s. He became a religious figure among the locals and was called \\"Haji Sahab\\".  Restoration of King Amanullah Khan  In 1933, Faqir Ipi went to Afghanistan to fight against the Mohammadzai Afghan King at Khost to support the restoration of King Amanullah Khan. In 1944, Faqir Ipi joined his fellow Loya Paktia tribesmen again to support the restoration of Amanullah Khan in the Afghan tribal revolts of 1944‚Äì1947. Until his death, Faqir Ipi remained involved in Afghan politics as he did not recognize Pakistan.The legendary guerilla Faqir of Ipi unremembered on his 115th anniversary. The Express Tribune. April 18, 2016.  Ram Kori case  In March 1936, a British Indian court ruled against the marriage of Islam Bibi, n√©e Ram Kori, a Hindu-converted Muslim girl at Jandikhel, Bannu, after the girl's family filed case of abduction and forced conversion. The ruling was based on the fact that the girl was a minor and was asked to make her decision of conversion and marriage after she reaches the age of majority, till then she was asked to live with a third party. The verdict enraged the Pashtuns, and further mobilized Faqir Ipi for a guerrilla war against the British Empire. The Dawar Maliks and mullahs left the Tochi for the Khaisor Valley to the south to rouse the Torikhel Wazirs. A month after the incident, Faqir Ipi called a tribal jirga in the village of Ipi near Mir Ali to declare war against the British imperialists.  Conflict with the British Raj  Faqir's decision to declare war against the British was endorsed by the local Pashtun tribes, who mustered two large lashkars 10,000 strong to battle the British. Interestingly, many Pashtun women also took part in the freedom movement, who not only actively participated in the war but also sung landai (a short folk-song sung by Pashtun women) to inspire the Pashtun fighters. Widespread lawlessness erupted as the Pashtuns blocked roads, overran outposts and ambushed convoys. In November 1936, the British sent two columns to the Khaisor river valley to crush the freedom movement, but suffered heavy casualties. Soon after the Khaisor campaign a general uprising broke out throughout Waziristan campaign, realising the futility of confronting the British Army directly especially with their advantage of air power, tribesmen switched to guerrilla warfare. Squadrons of the two air forces (RAF and RIAF) tried many tactics including scorched earth retaliation involving the burning of standing crops with jerry can petrol bombs and the killing of cattle with strafing attacks. In 1937, the British sent over 40,000 British-Indian troops, mostly Sikhs from the Punjab, to crush the freedom movement in Waziristan. This was in response to an ambush by Waziristani tribesmen in which they had killed over 50 British soldiers. However, the British operation failed and by Decemberÿå the troops were sent back to cantonments. In 1939, the British claimed that the war capacity of Faqir Ipi's forces was enhanced by support from Nazi Germany and Italy, alleging that the Italian diplomat Pietro Quaroni drove the Italian policy for involvement in Waziristan, although the British could not find any valid evidence for Pietro Quaroni's involvement. The British suppressed the agitation by imposing fines and by destroying the houses of their leaders, including that of Faqir Ipi. However, the pyrrhic nature of the victory and the subsequent withdrawal of the troops was credited by the Wazirs to be a manifestation of Faqir Ipi's miraculous powers. He succeeded in inducing a semblance of tribal unity, as the British noticed with dismay, among various sections of Wazirs, Dawar, Mahsuds and Bettanis. He cemented his position as religious leader by declaring a Jihad against the British. This move also helped rally support from Pashtun tribesman across the border. In 1946, the British again attempted to crush Faqir Ipi's movement but failed. Jirga in Bannu On 21 June 1947, Faqir Ipi, Abdul Ghaffar Khan, and other Khudai Khidmatgars held a jirga in Bannu during which they declared the Bannu Resolution, demanding that the Pashtuns be given a choice to have an independent state of Pashtunistan composing all Pashtun majority territories of British India, instead of being made to join the new dominions of India or Pakistan. However, the British Raj refused to comply with the demand of the Bannu Resolution and only the options for Pakistan and India were given. In response, Faqir Ipi and the Khudai Khidmatgars boycotted the 1947 North-West Frontier Province referendum on joining India or Pakistan, citing that it did not have the options for the province to become independent or join Afghanistan.  Pashtunistan movement  Faqir Ipi rejected the creation of Pakistan after the partition of India, considering Pakistan to be a continuation of British imperialism. In 1948, Faqir Ipi took control of North Waziristan's Datta Khel area and declared the establishment of an independent Pashtunistan, forming ties with regional leaders including Jawaharlal Nehru and Prince Mohammed Daoud Khan. On 29 May 1949, Faqir Ipi called a tribal jirga in his headquarters of Gurwek and asked Pakistan to accept Pashtunistan as an independent state. He published a Pashto-language newspaper, GhƒÅzƒ´, from Gurwek to promote his ideas. Afghanistan and India also provided financial support to the Pashtunistan movement under the leadership of Faqir Ipi. In January 1950, a Pashtun loya jirga in Razmak symbolically appointed Faqir Ipi as the first president of the \\"National Assembly for Pashtunistan\\". In 1953-54, the Pakistan Air Force led an operation from Miramshah airbase and heavily bombarded Faqir Ipi's compound in Gurwek. Although he himself never surrendered until his death, his movement diminished after 1954 when his Commander-in-chief Mehar Dil Khan Mehsud surrendered to the Pakistani authorities and became loyal to the state of Pakistan. Gathering at Razmak Faqir Ipi, while addressing a gathering at Razmak, said that the Government of Afghanistan had misled him and deceived him in the name of Islam. He instructed his supporters that if the Government of Afghanistan made any future plan against Pakistan in his name, they should never support it. As a result, Afghanistan on 7 September 1948 was compelled to issue an open warning to Faqir Ipi and told him to refrain from any anti-Pakistan activities.  Death  Faqir Ipi died at night on April 16, 1960. A long term sufferer of asthma during his last days, he became so sick that it was not possible for him to walk for a few steps. People from far away often used to come and see him and ask for his blessing. His funeral prayers or Namaz-I-Janaza was held at Gurwek led by Maulavi Pir Rehman. Thousands of people came for his Namaz-I- Janaza. He was buried at Gurwek. Faqir Aipee Road, a main artery connecting I.J.P. Road to the Kashmir Highway in the federal capital of Pakistan, Islamabad; is named after him.

The party was the most consistent advocate of human rights, democratisation and free market economics in parliament. Because the main challenge to liberal values comes from Islamists, the party often found itself in a de facto alliance with the former communists of the Democratic Bloc (another party that lost all its seats in 2006's election). While generally supportive of the government, it has not been uncritically so. The party campaigned for compensation for those that suffered past human rights abuses, with the party's President Jassim Abdula'al MP forwarding a motion to parliamentary speaker, Khalifa Al Dhahrani. Mr Abdula'al said that the national interest required closing the human rights file for good, between the leadership, the government and those affected. Another prominent member is lawyer Fareed Ghazi MP, who is also an activist with the Al Muntada liberal think tank. Fareed Ghazi has urged liberals against imposing their will on a conservative public, adding that it was not the right approach politically and morally. \\"We should find a common ground with the conservative element rather than just sit on a high horse and tell them that our way is the right way,\\" he said.

The building is in the Eclectic style and is an architectural and artistic monument. The country of Latvia was proclaimed in this building in the year 1918. On 23 February, the theatre will celebrate its 100th anniversary. The director of National Theatre of Latvia since 2006 has been OjƒÅrs Rubenis.  Mission  The mission of Latvia's National Theatre is to be the centre of national culture and art with the goal of introducing the art of theatre and current events in culture, through national values, to an even larger part of society. The National Theatre's vision for the future is to theatrically concentrate theatre's, art's and culture's most valuable pieces, by regularly introducing Latvian classics, original work, foreign theatre experience and current events to the viewer. There are also plans to include the most interesting and the most talented professionals, continue the development of theatre as an art form, as well as strengthen the collaboration between theatres and other cultural organizations. The guidelines for the National Theatre's development ensure the chance for the viewer to be introduced to all the events happening in the life of theatre in Latvia and with the most valuable foreign plays, as well as an opportunity to be a part of some of the best of the National Theatre's plays that are in the international circle.  Location  The Latvian National Theatre is situated in the centre of Latvia's capital city Riga, on the bank of the Riga Canal. Located just outside the Old Town, it stands in a park where the Citadel used to be.  History  In 1897 Riga‚Äôs city council decided that it was not enough to have just one theatre in Riga. Riga‚Äôs first theatre was the German Theatre, currently the Opera House. A competition was held to choose the design of the new building. The Augusts Reinbergs project \\"Dum spiro, spero\\" (\\"While I breathe, I hope\\") won and construction began, mainly funded by local Russian merchants and some nobility. The theatre was opened to the public on 14 September 1902 as Riga's Second Russian theatre and held both theatre and opera performances. Although this was Russian language theatre, by 1917 Riga Latvian Society was renting the premises to hold plays in Latvian. During the First World War the theatre was evacuated, but by 1918 it was already back in business, and on 15 October staged Richard Wagner's The Flying Dutchman. Just over a month later, Latvia announced its independence for the first time, with the declaration being read from the theatre's stage. The only remaining photograph from this historic event was taken in the theatre's main hall. In 1919, during a brief period of Bolshevik rule, the makeshift government named it the Workers‚Äô Theatre, but it became the Latvian National Theatre soon after and on 30 November the official opening took place with a staging of R≈´dolfs Blaumanis \\"Ugunƒ´\\" (\\"In Fire\\"). The creative program was authored by JƒÅnis AkurƒÅters, a Latvian writer, then head of the Art department of the Ministry of Education. During the Soviet occupation, the Latvian National Theatre could not keep its nationalistic name, so it became Riga's Dramatic Theatre, only to revert to the previous name upon the restoration of independence 40 years later. The current managing director of the theatre is OjƒÅrs Rubenis and the artistic director is Edmunds Freibergs  Layout  The building is a combination of style; the facade has both eclectic and baroque features as well as elements of Art Nouveau, which was extremely popular in Riga at the time. The interior is very functional, but in the various ornaments you can find elements of classicism. There are three halls in the theatre: the Great Hall (with 750 seats), the Actors Hall (with, depending on the play, 50‚Äì90 seats), and the LMT New Hall (with, depending on the play, 60‚Äì120 seats). Some seasons there is a fourth hall, \\"The Horror Bus\\", where a play by that name is held for children.  Actors  There are 49 actors, 23 freelance actors and 17 directors in the group.

The village is well known for the Arak liquor it produces; some local residents claim that it is one of the best made in the country. A well known producer is the legendary Doumit who is the son of the late Hanna Doumit, the beloved shopkeeper. Climate Roumieh is characterized by a temperate climate, including dry summers, rainy winters, and transitional fall and spring seasons. It is located 550 to 700 meters above sea level. Demographics The village's community is mainly constituted of Maronite Catholics and Greek Catholics, plus also Greek Orthodox and Armenian Orthodox. It is populated by approximately 5,000 permanents residents, excluding the prison's population. Topography The word \\"Roumieh\\" comes from Aramaic, meaning \\"hills\\" and refers to this characterising feature of the local terrain. This is understandable when one sees the \\"bumpy\\" pinetree-covered hills in the pastures of the village. Like all Lebanese mountain villages, Roumieh is marked with very beautiful terraces (Jleleh), designed to optimise the use of its land for agriculture and horticulture. Indeed, as cited above, some of the crops grown in Roumieh are exceptionally good given that the community ceased being agrarian nearly half a century ago. There used to be several natural streams (Ain) that surfaced in the village which were a good source of water for the residents. However, due to disorganised and sporadic construction in some of the marginal parts of town, most of these have disappeared. There is only one that remains properly functional, at the fountain in the centre of the village. The square surrounding the fountain has always been very pretty but has now been somewhat diminished by political graffiti and political propaganda posters. One can find some very pretty traditional Lebanese houses (pyramidal red brick roofs, white or sandstone walls with overlooking balconies and verandas shaped with arches in the old Levantine style) in Roumieh. Examples of this are some surrounding the Saydeh Church, and others in the Naas and Haret el Tahta and Fawka neighbourhoods. History and People Whilst the village itself is quite old (founded circa 1500), the 20th Century saw the village coming to a more prominent role in the area. With the ongoing diaspora towards the West including both North and Latin America, the village acquired wealth. Relatively to other similar villages, its inhabitants became increasingly educated (partially thanks to the proximity of Beirut and its institutions). Lebanon has been plagued by sectarian violence since the 19th century, when Maronite and Druze communities were fighting in the mountains. More recently, the Civil War that erupted in 1975 was the scene of severe sectarian tensions. Makdissi, Ussama. \\"Understanding Sectarianism, ISIM Newsletter, 2001. Retrieved on 2013-02-25. Although Roumieh is known for its people quarrelling over politics and even fighting from time to time, it is a tight-knit community that has survived the most divisive horrors of the Lebanese Civil War and the ongoing political turmoil. The village's diversity of opinions underlines its development that outdoes by far other villages in the area. The villagers may strongly disagree with each other on matters of politics, and given how seriously they take this, they may even go as far as being hostile to each other. However, Roumieh remains a community that its forefathers built and will remain so thanks to some outstanding members who have been known to put family and village before anything else. Lebanese villages have always been collectivistic societies. Lebanon's villagers have always put the family in the first place, followed by the individual. The family, the church and the community at large dictate group patterns in Lebanese villages.Tannous, Afif, The University of Chicago Press, 1948. Retrieved on 2013-02-25. Roumieh's population has changed due to the relocation of many people to the center of Lebanon, Maten and its areas. But Roumieh maintained its look and vision, unlike surrounding towns, due to its closed-knit community and people of the town.

There is road access to the terrace near Miramar Shopping Centre and further road access from Observatory Road. The street is strictly for pedestrians. Instead of vehicles, it is full of tables and chairs for the restaurants. History Before the construction of Knutsford Terrace, the slope consisted of gardens north of Kimberley Road. Starting from 1875, Kowloon Land and Building Company bought the land lots piece by piece and completed its purchases in 1888. The terrace was possibly built in 1895 with a row of sixteen small villas. It was then accessible from Observatory Road. Below the terrace were communal gardens with a tennis court on Kimberley Road. An access path was built to the terrace. In 1923, the premises was sold to Wong's family and more houses were built on the garden along Kimberley Road. When the premises were sold house by house in the 1950s and 1960s, they were quickly replaced with multi-storey buildings.

While marketed under the Rexona name in most countries, it is known as Sure in the United Kingdom, Ireland and India, Degree in the United States and Canada, Rexena in Japan and South Korea and Shield in South Africa. History It was developed in 1908 by Australian Samuel Fuller Sheffer and his wife, Alice. The products are available in varying forms including as aerosols, pumps, roll-ons, sticks and creams. In 2015 the brand launched a new range of fragrances with a new canister design, at the same time changing the formula. This has resulted in wide spread consumer backlash with many product review websites and forums giving very poor reviews and airing complaints that the new formula simply doesn't have the deodorant effect of the old formula. India In India, it was launched in 1947 as a rival to Hamam, then a Tata product, then Hindustan Unilever. As Hindustan Unilever already uses Rexona as a soap brand, the Sure brand was used instead for deodorants, as it is in the United Kingdom and Ireland. United States Degree is a brand of antiperspirant for men and women that is manufactured by Unilever. It comes in stick, gel, and spray forms. The stick form often comes with slogans pressed into the deodorant itself by the protective seal. For example, the \\"Cool Rush\\" variety comes with the slogan \\"Take The Risk\\". The Degree brand name was created by Helene Curtis, which Unilever acquired in 1996.  Other Sure brands  In the United States, Sure is an antiperspirant brand created by Procter & Gamble in 1972, marketed to both men and women. The brand's ownership transferred to Helen of Troy Limited, which acquired the brand from Innovative Brands in March 2010. Innovative Brands, LLC, a portfolio company of Jahm Najafi Companies, had acquired the brand from Procter & Gamble in September 2006, after P&G; had acquired Gillette. Although the brand already exists in the United States, Sure exists as brand in the UK, Ireland and India. Since being acquired by Helen of Troy in the United States, Sure is now marketed exclusively as a women's antiperspirant.  Marketing  The Rexona and Sure brands are sponsors for the Williams Formula 1 team. The brands had previously sponsored the Lotus F1 team before from the 2014 F1 season onwards.

Cerritos Auto Square states that it is the largest auto mall in the world with 29 import and domestic marques. The Cerritos Auto Square sign seen from Interstate 605 southbound at the South Street exit.  History  In 1979, the Cerritos Redevelopment Agency began work on the improvement of Studebaker Road, and in October of that year, S & J Chevrolet broke ground for the first auto dealership in the Cerritos Auto Square, directly west of Interstate 605 and the Los Cerritos Center, between 183rd and South streets. Eventually it would be joined by other dealerships in buildings that featured a distinctive \\"New Orleans\\" style. One of the first business locations in Cerritos was the General Telephone Company's service yard, replacing a turkey ranch on the northwest corner of Studebaker Road and 183rd Street. In 1988, the Los Cerritos Redevelopment Agency purchased the and made $1.2 million in improvements, including road improvements, landscaped medians and parkways, rocky waterfalls, and decorative street lights. The site was soon the new home of Moothart Chrysler-Plymouth and Victory Pontiac-GMC. A few years later, a Saturn dealer was added to make twenty-two dealer franchises in the Cerritos Auto Square. It started in 1995 Today, the Cerritos Auto Square provides the city of Cerritos with approximately $12 million a year in sales tax, and is its single largest source of revenue. In 2006, the Auto Square sold 48,241 automobiles, totaling over $1.1 billion in sales, or half of the total retail sales in the city.  Marketing  The Cerritos Auto Square has an aggressive marketing campaign throughout Southern California. The Cerritos Auto Square Association advertises collectively via radio, television, and signage, as well as individual dealership advertisements through similar media.  Radio  The various advertisements heard throughout Southern California radio is perhaps the most widespread example of the Auto Square's collective advertising. Although no one dealership receives extra air time, the advertisements generally proclaim the low prices, sales, and reputation of the auto mall as the highest volume dealer. The popular jingles, \\"Take the 605 to South Street, come on, it's all there! Take the 605 to South Street, Cerritos Auto Square!\\" (Sung to the tune of The Orlons \\"South Street\\") or \\"We sell more, so you save more, Cerritos...Auto Square!\\" are ubiquitous and are good examples of effective advertising strategies using simple, easy-to- remember lyrics.  Television  Local television stations and cable companies throughout the Southland air or insert advertisements for the Cerritos Auto Square collectively or as individual dealerships located within the auto mall. The television advertisements play the same jingle mentioned above and characteristically involve computer animations of non sequitur images or of Jim Varney as his popular character Ernest P. Worrell, who served as a spokesperson for the Cerritos Auto Square throughout the 1990s. A more recent spokesman for the Cerritos Auto Square was stuntman Super Dave Osborne, and he was featured prominently in the television ads. Since January 2005, the Auto Square has also been launching television spots that depict the \\"downside to buying in bulk\\" in order to save money. Clips and the jingle can be found in the Auto Square's web site here .  Signage  The Cerritos Auto Square sign overlooking Interstate 605 is perhaps the most well known symbol of the auto mall. It is a tall blue and white sign that states: \\"Cerritos Auto Square: South Street Exit: World's Largest.\\" It also features a flashing marquee that is used for individual advertisements for dealers in the Auto Square, as well as for shows at the Cerritos Center for the Performing Arts. Future expansion On February 14, 2006 meeting of the Cerritos Economic Commission, Applied Development Economics discussed and suggested the diversification of the Cerritos Auto Square to possibly include RVs, motorcycles, trucks and marine vehicles. The expansion of the nearby Interstate 5 in the coming years in southeast Los Angeles would provide several opportunities for diversifying the Auto Square's selection. It was also stated in the meeting that more luxury lines were needed to expand the selection and increase Cerritos' lead in the automobile retail sector.  Challenges  \\"Although the current consensus among economists and automotive experts portends a slight softening of the nationwide demand for cars and trucks, the Auto Square will continue to benefit from its location and reputation,\\" states the Cerritos City Manager.

Scott (1986). The Butterflies of North America. Stanford University Press, Stanford, CA. ) is a North American butterfly first described by the French naturalists Jean Baptiste Boisduval and John Eatton Le Conte from the state of Georgia, United States. Description Upperside of the male This small butterfly has slim, triangular wings. The upperside of the male's wings is mostly orange with the margins being dark brown. The underside of the male's wings is mainly yellow orange with the margins being dark brown.Rick Cech and Guy Tudor (2005). Butterflies of the East Coast. Princeton University Press, Princeton, NJ. There is a yellow basal spot enclosed with brown.Jim P. Brock and Kenn Kaufman (2003). Butterflies of North America. Houghton Mifflin, New York, NY. The upperside of the female's wings is dark brown with large, glassy spots near the forewing outer margin. The underside of the female's wings is a brownish-burgundy color with the hindwing having a white streak on the costal edge. The wing margins are broadly frosted. The wingspan measures to inches (35‚Äì41 mm).\\"Zabulon Skipper,\\" Similar species Underside of the male Upperside of the female The only similar species in the Zabulon skipper's range is the Hobomok skipper. The Hobomok skipper has a more northern range and different flight period than the Zabulon skipper. They also have more rounded wings. The upperside of the male Hobomok skipper's wings has thicker dark margins. The underside of the male's hindwing lacks the enclosed yellow basal spot. While the female Zabulon skipper has one form, the female Hobomok skipper has two; the normal form and the pocahontas form. The upperside of the pocahontas form has smaller glassy spots and has one glassy spot near the forewing costa. Distribution This species ranges from Wisconsin east to the East Coast, south to Georgia, Texas, and Panama. Habitat The Zabulon skipper can be found in a wide range of habitats such as woodland edges, woodland openings, and near roads, especially if there are streams nearby. It can adapt to other habitats including suburban areas, parks, and gardens. Flight This butterfly is on the wing from March to April and again in August to October in the south; and from May to July and again in August to September in the north. Life cycle Males perch all day in search for females. Usually, courtship takes place in the afternoon. However, it will occasionally happen as early as 8:20 a.m. Females lay their eggs singly on the underside of host plant leaves. The larva is either brown or green, both sometimes having a pinkish hue. It is often indistinguishable from closely related larvae.Allen J. Thomas, Jim P. Brock, and Jeffrey Glassberg (2005). Caterpillars in the Field and Garden. Oxford University Press, New York, NY. The chrysalis is often formed inside a leaf shelter. It is brown with the abdomen being a lighter brown and having small black dots. The overwintering stage is unknown. The Zabulon skipper has two broods per year. Host plants Recorded food plants of the caterpillars are grasses such as Agrostis, Dactylis, Elytrigia, Eragrostis, Leymus, Poa, Puccinellia and Tridens.

The BPP quantifies the quality of a laser beam, and how well it can be focused to a small spot. A Gaussian beam has the lowest possible BPP, \\\\lambda/\\\\pi, where \\\\lambda is the wavelength of the light. The ratio of the BPP of an actual beam to that of an ideal Gaussian beam at the same wavelength is denoted M2 (\\"M squared\\"). This parameter is a wavelength-independent measure of beam quality. The quality of a beam is important for many applications. In fiber-optic communications beams with an M2 close to 1 are required for coupling to single-mode optical fiber. Laser machine shops care a lot about the M2 parameter of their lasers because the beams will focus to an area that is M4 times larger than that of a Gaussian beam with the same wavelength and D4œÉ waist width; in other words, the fluence scales as 1/M4. The rule of thumb is that M2 increases as the laser power increases. It is difficult to obtain excellent beam quality and high average power (100 W to kWs) due to thermal lensing in the laser gain medium.  Measurement  There are several ways to define the width of a beam. When measuring the beam parameter product and M2, one uses the D4œÉ or \\"second moment\\" width of the beam to determine both the radius of the beam's waist and the divergence in the far field.A. E. Siegman, \\"How to (Maybe) Measure Laser Beam Quality,\\" Tutorial presentation at the Optical Society of America Annual Meeting, Long Beach, California, October 1997. The BPP can be easily measured by placing an array detector or scanning-slit profiler at multiple positions within the beam after focusing it with a lens of high optical quality and known focal length. To properly obtain the BPP and M2 the following steps must be followed:ISO 11146-1:2005(E), \\"Lasers and laser-related equipment ‚Äî Test methods for laser beam widths, divergence angles and beam propagation ratios ‚Äî Part 1: Stigmatic and simple astigmatic beams.\\" # Measure the D4œÉ widths at 5 axial positions near the beam waist (the location where the beam is narrowest). # Measure the D4œÉ widths at 5 axial positions at least one Rayleigh length away from the waist. # Fit the 10 measured data points to W^2(z) = W_0^2 + M^4 \\\\left(\\\\frac{\\\\lambda}{\\\\pi W_0}\\\\right)^2(z-z_0)^2 ,A. E. Siegman, \\"How to (Maybe) Measure Laser Beam Quality,\\" Tutorial presentation at the Optical Society of America Annual Meeting Long Beach, California, October 1997, p.9. (Note that there is a typo in equation on page 3. Correct form comes from equations on page 9.) where W(z) = 2\\\\sigma(z) = \\\\tfrac 1 2 \\\\text{D4}\\\\sigma(z) and \\\\sigma^2(z) is the second moment of the distribution in the x or y direction (see section on D4œÉ beam width), and z_0 is the location of the beam waist with second moment width of \\\\sigma_0 . Fitting the 10 data points yields M2, z_0 , and \\\\sigma_0 . Siegman showed that all beam profiles ‚Äî Gaussian, flat top, TEMxy, or any shape ‚Äî must follow the equation above provided that the beam radius uses the D4œÉ definition of the beam width. Using other definitions of beam width does not work. In principle, one could use a single measurement at the waist to obtain the waist diameter, a single measurement in the far field to obtain the divergence, and then use these to calculate the BPP. The procedure above gives a more accurate result in practice, however. High-power lasers, such as those used in laser welding and cutting are typically measured by using a beamsplitter to sample the beam. The sampled beam has much lower intensity and can be measured by a scanning-slit or knife-edge profiler. Good beam quality is very important in laser welding and cutting operations.

Early life  Shinwari was born in Landi Kotal, Khyber district, as the fifth son of Brameer Khan. In 1915, he enrolled in a primary school. When the teacher asked him to write the Urdu alphabet he instead displayed his artistic abilities and drew a human figure. He went to Islamia Collegiate School in the fifth grade and started writing poetry in Urdu. Once his teacher Khawaja Syed Abdul Sattar Shah advised him to write in his mother tongue Pashto. As he was not proficient in Urdu, he obeyed his teacher's instructions and began writing in Pashto.  Career  When Shinwari worked on the railways, he had very little money. He received a low-income certificate and quit. He travelled to Mumbai to work in the film industry, but failed to establish himself. Hamza was inspired by Mirza Khan Ansari and Khushal Khan Khattak.

Munthe A vignette, in graphic design, is a unique form for a frame to an image, either illustration or photograph. Rather than the image's edges being rectilinear, it is overlaid with decorative artwork featuring a unique outline. This is similar to the use of the word in photography, where the edges of an image that has been vignetted are non-linear or sometimes softened with a mask ‚Äì often a darkroom process of introducing a screen. An oval vignette is probably the most common example. Originally a vignette was a design of vine-leaves and tendrils (vignette = small vine). The term was also used for a small embellishment without border, in what otherwise would have been a blank space, such as that found on a title-page, a headpiece or tailpiece. The use in modern graphic design is derived from book publishing techniques dating back to the Middle Ages Analytical Bibliography (ca. 1450 to 1800) when a vignette referred to an engraved design printed using a copper- plate press, on a page that has already been printed on using a letter press (Printing press). Vignettes are sometimes distinguished from other in-text illustrations printed on a copper-plate press by the fact that they do not have a border; such designs usually appear on title-pages only. Woodcuts, which are printed on a letterpress and are also used to separate sections or chapters are identified as a headpiece, tailpiece or printer's ornament, depending on shape and position. Cellphone, Picasa, Photoshop, and other modern software apps and devices possess photo-manipulating functions which have the capability of editing images to create vignettes of varying styles and degrees of size and color.

It is calculated from the ratio of the beam parameter product (BPP) of the beam to that of a Gaussian beam with the same wavelength. It relates the beam divergence of a laser beam to the minimum focussed spot size that can be achieved. For a single mode TEM00 (Gaussian) laser beam, M2 is exactly one. The M2 value for a laser beam is widely used in the laser industry as a specification, and its method of measurement is regulated as an ISO Standard. Utility M2 is useful because it reflects how well a collimated laser beam can be focused to a small spot, or how well a divergent laser source can be collimated. It is a better guide to beam quality than Gaussian appearance because there are many cases in which a beam can look Gaussian, yet have an M2 value far from unity. Tutorial presentation at the Optical Society of America Annual Meeting, Long Beach, California Likewise, a beam intensity profile can appear very \\"un-Gaussian\\", yet have an M2 value close to unity. The value of M2 is determined by measuring D4œÉ or \\"second moment\\" width. Unlike the beam parameter product, M2 is unitless and does not vary with wavelength. Multi- mode beam propagation Real laser beams are often non-Gaussian, being multi- mode or mixed-mode. Multi-mode beam propagation is often modeled by considering a so-called \\"embedded\\" Gaussian, whose beam waist is M times smaller than that of the multimode beam. The diameter of the multimode beam is then M times that of the embedded Gaussian beam everywhere, and the divergence is M times greater, but the wavefront curvature is the same. The multimode beam has M2 times the beam area but 1/M2 less beam intensity than the embedded beam. This holds true for any given optical system, and thus the minimum (focussed) spot size or beam waist of a multi-mode laser beam is M times the embedded Gaussian beam waist. Applications The quality of a beam is important for many applications. In fiber-optic communications beams with an M2 close to 1 are required for coupling to single-mode optical fiber. M2 determines how tightly a collimated beam of a given diameter can be focused: the diameter of the focal spot varies as M2, and the irradiance scales as 1/M4. For a given laser cavity, the output beam diameter (collimated or focused) scales as M, and the irradiance as 1/M2. This is very important in laser machining and laser welding, which depend on high fluence at the weld location. Generally, M2 increases as a laser's output power increases. It is difficult to obtain excellent beam quality and high average power at the same time due to thermal lensing in the laser gain medium.

Two demos were recorded. A gig in Germany with Pungent Stench led to a deal with Nuclear Blast in 1989. The first outcome of that deal was a split with country-mates Pungent Stench. After they released two full-length albums with Nuclear Blast they signed a new deal and released their third album on Steamhammer. The albums sound rather different from each other. The band took a break in 1994 . This timeout lasted until 2002 after their debut album Expositionsprophylaxe had been re-issued they released studio album, titled Ahead. In October 2016 after a long break the band released their new album called Fear of Angst.

Throughout its history it has been one of the largest Greek companies, in fact a reflection of the history of Greek Industry itself. Moreover, since its foundation it has been a crucial supplier during all the military conflicts this nation faced, and historically a well-established exporter to five continents.  Establishment and development  The company \\"Elliniko Pyritidopoieio A.E.\\" (Greek Powder, Chemical and Industrial products) was founded in 1874 and \\"Maltsiniotis Brothers\\" (Cartridges and metal products) in 1887. The merger of the two companies in 1908 was done to overcome an odd competition between the two for ammunition orders by the Greek state. Thus, a new company was formed, named \\"Etairia (Ellinikou) Pyritidopoieiou kai Kalykopoieiou\\" with the initials EEPK or EPK (ŒïŒ†Œö) - the acronym Pyrkal used later; internationally it has been known as \\"Greek Powder and Cartridge Company\\" (GPCC) in English, and \\"Poudrerie et Cartoucherie Hellenique\\" (PCH) in French. Starting with the production of 6.5√ó54mm Mannlicher‚ÄìSch√∂nauer for the Mannlicher‚ÄìSch√∂nauer, and in addition to ammunition and explosives, the company has been engaged in a variety of additional activities including arms manufacture (which included own development of the advanced EPK machine gun type immediately before Greece's entrance to World War II), construction of machinery (including Diesel engines), vehicle bodies, tools, factory infrastructure, boilers, aircraft (as it undertook constructions for the AEKKEA-RAAB company) etc.  Part of the Bodossakis \\"empire\\"; events up to, during and after WWII  Prodromos Bodosakis-Athanasiadis From 1934 the company was controlled by Prodromos Bodosakis-Athanasiadis, one of the most important figures in 20th century Greek industrial history. Pyrkal eventually became part of a huge industrial empire created by Bodosakis in Greece and Cyprus, involved in mining operations (several companies, holding dominant position in Greece), textiles, chemicals and fertilizers, beverages, glass manufacturing, engineering & constructions, as well as services (shipping, insurances etc.). EPK (Pyrkal) machine gun (1939) In 1936-37 during the Spanish Civil War German arms were supplied to the Spanish Republicans from Rheinmetall-Borsig, then controlled by Hermann G√∂ring, even though German forces were fighting with the Spanish Nationalists. Arms shipped to Greece with a Greek end-user certificate were split by Bodosakis, with arms for the Republicans transferred to ships supposedly sailing to Mexico. But the Nationalists got the best and latest weapons while the Republicans got the oldest and least serviceable. This supply peaked in 1937-38, with shipments from Rheinmetall-Borsig worth up to 40 million Reichsmarks each. Nationalists identified 18 vessels sent to Republican ports from 3 January 1937 to 11 May 1938, and estimated that Goering received the equivalent of one pound sterling per rifle. In November 1937 Bodosakis travelled to Barcelona in a Soviet aircraft, and signed a contract to supply ammunition to the Republic for ¬£2.1 million, in hard currency in advance.Beevor pages 366-8 & 538 There have also been reports that the company assembled airplanes for the nationalist forces. Pyrkal's production was particularly crucial for Greece up to and during World War II. The company facilities were used by the German forces during Greece's occupation by the Axis (as a planned last-moment transfer of equipment and/or destruction of the company facilities to prevent such usage was not realized). The end of the War found the company in ruins, with equipment and material looted by retreating German forces. The machine works (once called \\"the largest in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Middle East\\") were almost completely destroyed. The rebirth of Pyrkal resembles a miracle. The company started producing metal products and consumer items, but it recovered fast to its pre-War status as it benefited greatly from orders by the Hellenic Army, NATO and, ironically, West Germany. The next two decades were a period of prosperity and expansion, with new facilities built and new products developed.  1970s and 1980s: change of fortunes  The company suffered a serious blow when the Greek state decided to create EBO in 1976, which initially undertook production of the Heckler and Koch G3 rifle adopted by the Greek Army in place of the FN FAL that Pyrkal had already started producing under licence (a number of FN FAL's had originally been bought by the Greek Military from Belgium, and about 30,000 built by Pyrkal were exported to other countries). The development of EBO seriously hurt Pyrkal's performance, as the two companies offered partially overlapping products. Pyrkal was hurt further by the loss of traditional export markets in the 1970s. Other parts of Bodossakis's \\"empire\\" also faced problems, and the state finally intervened in the early 1980s. In 1982 Pyrkal, almost bankrupt and a shadow of its former self (but still employing thousands), was nationalized. Ever since, its financial performance has been shaky at best.  New efforts and merger with EBO  The company has nonetheless invested in diversification and Research & Development, expanding its activities beyond production of a wide range of ammunition types, mines, bombs, fuses for high explosive large caliber ammunition, electronics, etc. to participation in programs like the Stinger missile European post-production program and, as an equal partner, in the development and production of the IRIS-T missile. Moreover, it introduced its own advanced (although controversial) cluster bomb in the early 1990s and constructed Greek-designed modern wind generators in 2002. In a move reflecting one made almost a hundred years earlier, it merged with EBO in 2004, to eliminate the odd competition between the two companies for state orders, forming EAS.

Following Henry Hudson‚Äôs exploration of the east coast of North America on behalf of the Dutch East India Company in 1609, several Dutch merchants sent ships to trade with the Native Americans (mainly fur) and to search for the Northwest Passage. In order to maximize their profits these merchants decided to form the New Netherland Company and on October 11, 1614 they successfully petitioned the Estates-General for a charter of trading privileges.

In 1618 the Company's charter wasn't renewed because negotiations for the formation of the Dutch West India Company were well advanced.

Population: History Settlements located in the current area of Okulovsky district were first mentioned in chronicles in 1495 as belonging to Derevskaya pyatina. However, the settlement of Okulovka has only been known since 1851 and appeared in connection with the construction of the Nikolayevskaya Railway which connected Moscow and St. Petersburg. Okulovka developed first as a settlement serving the railway stations and eventually industries proliferated. It initially was a part of Borovichsky Uyezd in Novgorod Governorate. In the beginning of the 20th century, it was the administrative center of Okulovskaya Volost of Malovishersky Uyezd in Novgorod Governorate. In August 1927, the uyezds were abolished and, effective October 1, 1927, Okulovsky District was established, with the administrative center in Okulovka.Snytko et al., pp. 85‚Äì86 Novgorod Governorate was abolished as well and the district became a part of Borovichi Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. Okulovka was granted urban-type settlement status on June 25, 1928. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. During World War II, Okulovsky District was not occupied by German troops; however, being adjacent to the front line, Okulovka played an important role. On July 5, 1944, Okulovsky District was transferred to newly established Novgorod Oblast and remained there ever since.Snytko et al., p. 93 On January 12, 1965, the urban-type settlements of Okulovka and Parakhino-Poddubye were merged to form the town of Okulovka, which became the administrative center of Okulovsky District. Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Okulovka serves as the administrative center of Okulovsky District.Law #559-OZ As an administrative division, it is, together with two rural localities, incorporated within Okulovsky District as the town of district significance of Okulovka.Resolution #121 As a municipal division, the town of district significance of Okulovka is incorporated within Okulovsky Municipal District as Okulovskoye Urban Settlement.Law #355-OZ Economy=Industry There are three big factories in Okulovka, producing wire, electronics, and furniture. There are also smaller-scale enterprises of textile industry and of food industry. Transportation Okulovka is an important station on the Moscow‚ÄìSt. Petersburg Railway, the first long-distance railway constructed in Russia, opened in 1851 and built as a straight line. Another line to Nebolchi via Lyubytino branches off to the northeast. Okulovka is a terminal station for suburban trains, which leave in three directions: to Bologoye, Malaya Vishera, and Nebolchi. Most of the long-distance trains call at Okulovka as well. The historical building of the railway station was demolished in 2003 under the pretext of the construction of the speed rail tracks for the Sapsan train. Money was allocated for the construction of the new station building, but as of 2011, the construction did not start. Okulovka is connected by roads with Borovichi, Tikhvin (via Lyubytino), Bologoye via (Lykoshino), and Kresttsy. There are also local roads. Culture and recreation G. de Roerich Okulovka contains twenty-nine cultural heritage monuments of local significance. These include pre-1917 houses and workshops, monuments to fallen soldiers, and one archaeological site. Okulovka is home to the Miklukho-Maklay Okulovka District Museum. It is named after Nicholas Miklouho-Maclay, a Russian ethnographer notable for his studies of indigenous population of Papua. Miklouho-Maclay was born on the territory of what now is Okulovsky District, where his father, a construction engineer, was involved in the railroad construction. George de Roerich was born in Okulovka in August 1902. Later George became a scientist, orientalist, and guru. He is known for his contributions to Tibetan dialectology, his monumental translation of the Blue Annals, and his 11-volume Tibetan-Russian-English dictionary with Sanskrit parallels. After spending almost 30 years in India George returned in 1957 to Russia.

Life His capital was Tƒìrvete hillfort. During the first decades of the 13th century he was allied with the Livonian Brothers of the Sword against Lithuanians, who looted Semigallia on several occasions. In 1205, joint forces of semigallians and crusaders defeated Lithuanians and killed duke ≈Ωvelgaitis. In 1208 Viestards led a united Semigallian and crusader army into Lithuania but was heavily defeated. In 1219 Viestards came into conflict with German bishop Albert when German crusaders placed their garrison in Semigallian castle of Me≈æotne. Viestards unsuccessfully attacked Me≈æotne but managed to defeat the reinforcement of crusaders coming on Lielupe river after that crusaders left Me≈æotne. Viestards became an enemy of the Livonian Brothers of the Sword and made an alliance with his neighbors, the Samogitians. Together they fought against the crusaders. In 1225 Viestards allowed William of Modena to preach in Semigallia however he refused to accept Christianity. In 1228 Semigallian forces under Viestards joined the Curonians in their attack against main crusader stronghold- Riga. However they were unsuccessful in storming the city. In 1229 Viestards led semigallian revenge raid in crusader lands around Aizkraukle where he had a duel with komtur of Aizkraukle Marquart von Burbach. Viestards died in 1230, but the Semigallians still were not conquered until the end of the 13th century. Viestards never accepted Christianity and accepted only one monk in Semigallia as a preacher. Although in Rhymed Chronicle Viestards is referred as king of Semigallia today it is believed that he reigned only in western part of Semigallia with a centre in Tƒìrvete. Eastern part of Semigallia with a centre in Me≈æotne hillfort most likely was not under Viestards rule until 1219. After Viestards death in 1230 area around Me≈æotne fell in the hands of German crusaders.

The channel initially launched on 17 September 1993 as a larger pan-European feed, serving the UK market along with Western and Northern Europe. In 1999, Cartoon Network further nationalized its feed by adding different language tracks to certain programmes. On 15 October of that year, the British arm of the feed was split off. History=Pre-launch In October 1992, the original version of Cartoon Network was launched at CNN Center, Atlanta, U.S. Cartoon Network was created in response of Turner Entertainment acquiring MGM's Cartoon and Film library in 1986 and the acquisition of the Hanna-Barbera animation studio and cartoon library in 1991. As a result of Turner purchasing MGM's Cartoon and Film library, Warner Bros. pre-1948 content was also acquired, including early Looney Tunes and Merrie Melodies shorts. At launch in the United States, Cartoon Network had an 8,500-hour cartoon library, and it became the first channel dedicated to cartoons. In April 1993, Cartoon Network expanded into foreign markets by launching a Latin American version of Cartoon Network dubbed in both Spanish, Portuguese and English. Cartoon Network's large animation library was in high demand in Western Europe and as a response to consumer demand, Astra 1C, the satellite on which Cartoon Network broadcast on, was launched in May 1993 on board an Ariane 42L rocket from Kourou, French Guiana. Cartoon Network Europe was launched on 17 September 1993, broadcasting from London. It launched only less than 12 months after the original American version and only 16 days after Nickelodeon. Launch The original Cartoon Network logo, used from 17 September 1993 to 11 April 2005. The logo is still used today on some occasions. Cartoon Network was originally twinned with TNT and ran from 5am until 7pm, with TNT taking over from 7pm to 5am. Sunday afternoons saw \\"Super Chunk\\", which showed back to back episodes of one show for two hours between 1pm and 3pm. Another feature was \\"The Longest Day\\", in which Cartoon Network ran for an extra four hours until 11pm in June 1994, every year beginning in 1994. This slot was dedicated to full-length cartoon movies. The first theme was the Checkerboard theme, which showed graphics from its US counterpart and lasted until 1999. The Checkerboard branding package was developed by Hatmaker Studios, now merged and part of its sister company - Corey, McPherson and Nash. Also unlike Nickelodeon, which was part of Sky Multichannels, Cartoon Network was free-to-air across Europe. Introduction of 24-hour service In August 1996, Cartoon Network began running for an extra two hours until 9pm, and in December 1996, it became a 24-hour channel, as did TNT on the Astra 1G satellite. However, a timesharing version of the channel called TNT & Cartoon Network continued to appear on some providers. In December 1998, Cartoon Network launched as part of the Sky Digital satellite platform on the Astra 2A satellite. Also, in February 1997, Dutch cable provider A2000/KTA added the 24-hour Cartoon Network and TNT channels to its programming lineup. From November 1998, Cartoon Network was part of ITV Digital's channel package, airing 24 hours a day until the service collapsed in May 2002. Separation from Pan-European version In October 1999, Cartoon Network officially stopped being a pan-European feed, this was when the shared transponder analogue feed on Astra 1C became scrambled with VideoCrypt and when the short-lived analogue UK and Ireland only version of TNT launched. Prior to this date, the European version of Cartoon Network moved to Sirius II for serve Central Europe in August 1999 and the French and Spanish version launched at the same time the same month, leaving the ex pan- European version on Astra 1C acting as a de facto free to air secondary/transitional European feed for countries preparing to switchover to their own newly launched local versions of Cartoon Network up until encryption in October 1999. TNT changed its programming from classic movies to general entertainment as the movies were moved to TCM, TNT UK ceased to exist in July 2000 and was replaced with an analogue version of TCM. During the late 90s and the early 2000s, Turner Entertainment Networks International started localising their channels to suit different audiences across different countries around Europe, Middle East and Africa. Post-pan European split After the pan-European split, Cartoon Network revamped in October 1999 with the launch of a unique and more intensive variant of the \\"Powerhouse\\" theme which had shapes and tiles with lines and footage of characters from various shows shown on Cartoon Network. This lasted until September 2002 and was used throughout Europe. The European version of Powerhouse was produced by now- defunct London based animation and design studio AMGFX. A DJ theme was used during the AKA Cartoon Network programming block, bumpers include a live- action DJ scratching a record, which affects the playback of a cartoon clip. In June 2001, the analogue feed on Astra 1C of Cartoon Network and TCM ceased broadcasting, this was when Sky ended its analogue services. An example of a bumper during the 2002-2005 Casillas Era. Each box shows a different video clip from the same or different cartoon. In each box, a character does an action, when they leave a box, they move to another box or their action is taken over by another character in another box. Cartoon Network's second logo, used in various forms and styles from 11 April 2005 to 27 September 2010. In April 2005, after it was introduced in the United States, Cartoon Network adopted the CN City era until May 2007. Current events In May 2007, Cartoon Network changed its branding to a similar look to ones used during 1999 to 2005, this branding was known as the Arrow Era. There were also alternate Arrow Era idents designed by the design studio, Stardust, which had a 3D style, rather than the 2D style used by the other Arrow Era idents. The British and Irish version of Cartoon Network used both 2D and 3D Arrow Era idents, while other Cartoon Network channels that used the Arrow Era usually either used only one. This branding lasted until September 2010. A variation of the network's current logo which resembles its original logo, used . In September 2010, the British version of Cartoon Network introduced its current branding and logo. Designed by Brand New School, it makes heavy use of a black and white checkerboard motif, as well as various CMYK color variations and patterns. This branding was used in the American version since May 2010. The DOG was moved from the top right corner to the bottom right corner, like in United States. In April 2014, Cartoon Network's DOG moved back to the top- right corner and a new Next banner using graphics from the Check It 3.0. branding package was introduced. Also the same month Cartoon Network Too was closed and was replaced with a reinstated one-hour timeshift service called Cartoon Network +1. Cartoon Network's Check It 3.0 was fully implemented on Cartoon Network in July 2014 for the official start of the school summer holidays in the UK, Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu also premiered on the channel on the same day. In November 2015, Cartoon Network launched their anti-bullying campaign in conjunction with Childline called Cartoon Network Buddy Network. After nearly two years of the Laughternoons programming block was replaced with Mega Mondays in April 2014, Laughternoons returned to Cartoon Network for a short period in January 2016. Mega Mondays was the name of Cartoon Network's new episodes programming block for three years before being discontinued in July 2017. It was replaced with New Fridays in March 2018. In October 2015, Cartoon Network launched their own localised version of the Cartoon Network Anything app, featuring short-form content such as mini- games and video-clips. In February 2016, Cartoon Network used graphics from the Check It 4.0 branding package for the first time on a new episode promo for Transformers: Robots in Disguise. In July 2016, Cartoon Network fully rebranded using graphics from the Check It 4.0 branding package. In April 2016, Cartoon Network signed a deal with Sky for exclusive on-demand boxset rights for a selection of its animated shows. In November 2016, Cartoon Network won two PromaxBDA UK awards for their Where's Ice King and Weetabix Weetabuddies television campaigns. In July 2017, Cartoon Network fully rebranded using graphics from the Dimensional branding package. Cartoon Network programs=Original scheduling When Cartoon Network initially launched, its schedule was mainly made up of short cartoons from both Warner Bros. and other studios, such as Looney Tunes, Merrie Melodies and Tom and Jerry. A few years after, it started to broadcast its own programming such as The Powerpuff Girls and Dexter's Laboratory. Eventually, most of Cartoon Network's acquired programming was shifted to the sidelines, with the company's original animated series taking up the majority of Cartoon Network's timeslots. Programming blocks In September 2000, Toonami began broadcasting weekdays for two hours between 4pm until 6pm, and from 9pm until 11pm, as well as weekends from 10am until noon and 10pm until midnight. Dragonball Z had already been airing on Cartoon Network since March 2000, and had been attracting very good ratings, which may have contributed to the decision to launch Toonami in the UK. Its output consisted almost solely of Japanese anime such as the cult Dragonball Z, Tenchi Muyo, and Gundam Wing. The only non-Japanese shows for quite some time were The Real Adventures of Jonny Quest and Batman Beyond. As time went on, Toonami started to shift away from Japanese anime and action programming, eventually morphing into CN Too. Around the same time, there was almost completely new programming on the channel, and so Boomerang began in a late night slot; it ultimately branched off into its own channel after the block was discontinued. From February 2012 until July 2017, Cartoon Network shifted its major night of premieres to Monday evenings, under the names \\"Meaty Mondays\\", and as of April 2014 \\"Mega Mondays\\". Additionally, the block's name would change to \\"Mince Pie Mondays\\" every December, sporting a more festive look and airing Christmas specials to boot. In May 2014, a much smaller Friday variety block, titled \\"Funsize Fridays\\" was launched. This block only ran for around 2014, and consisted of playing \\"a different show every fifteen minutes\\". The shows featured in the block were Adventure Time, The Amazing World of Gumball, Clarence, Johnny Test, Regular Show, Steven Universe, Teen Titans Go!, and Uncle Grandpa. Only one of these shows would air new episodes in this block, passing the baton to a different show monthly. Eventually, both of these blocks were discontinued, and Cartoon Network was completely devoid of programming blocks for some time. However, in March 2018, a brand new Friday night premiere block launched, under the simple name \\"New Fridays\\". The block aired on Friday nights from 4pm to 9pm, and it was based upon the United States feed's \\"NEW NEW NEW NEW\\" block, carrying the same neon light branding from its international counterpart. Despite only lasting around four months, the block had a large variety of shows rotating in and out of premiere slots, including Adventure Time, The Amazing World of Gumball, Ben 10, Clarence, Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs, Mighty Magiswords, Ninjago: Masters of Spinjitzu, OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes, The Powerpuff Girls, Regular Show, Steven Universe, Supernoobs, Teen Titans Go!, We Bare Bears, Uncle Grandpa, and Unikitty!. The Canadian import Wishfart also had its premiere and new episodes restricted to the block. In July 2018, the block was unceremoniously discontinued. Sister networks=Boomerang In May 2000, Boomerang was launched by Cartoon Network in the UK and Ireland, and most \\"classic\\" cartoons were moved from Cartoon Network to Boomerang, which initially broadcast from 6am to 12am. In October 2001, Boomerang became a 24-hour channel and the remaining \\"classic\\" cartoons like The Smurfs, also moved to Boomerang. Cartoonito In May 2007, Cartoonito was launched as a pre-school channel replacing Cartoon Network Too. Cartoonito aired from 4am to 9pm daily. In January 2018, Cartoonito officially began airing 24 hours a day. Defunct sister networks=CNX CNX was a channel operated by Turner Broadcasting System Europe in the UK and Ireland between 2002 and 2003. It was aimed at a male audience, with daytime programming aimed at older children and teenagers, and evening programming aimed at older teenagers and young adults. CNX was carried in the 'Entertainment' section of the Sky programme guide, and was also available on cable Toonami Toonami launched in September 2003 showing action programming. Toonami had originally replaced CNX, which launched in October 2002. In May 2007, Toonami was replaced with Cartoon Network Too. Cartoon Network Too In April 2006, Cartoon Network Too was launched on Sky on the same day as sister TCM 2 and Nick Jr. 2, broadcasting cartoons primarily made by Hanna-Barbera such as Dexter's Laboratory, The Powerpuff Girls, Johnny Bravo and Wacky Races. Cartoon Network Too aired from 3 am to 7 pm every day until May 2007, when it became a 24-hour channel, taking Toonami's slot and getting a new identity. In April 2014, Cartoon Network Too was replaced by a relaunched of Cartoon Network +1.  Related services =Cartoon Network +1 Cartoon Network +1 originally launched in 1998 as a one-hour timeshift of Cartoon Network before it was replaced by Cartoon Network Too in April 2006. Cartoon Network +1 was relaunched in April 2014 replacing Cartoon Network Too, just as Cartoon Network Too had replaced them in 2006. In July 2018, Cartoon Network +1 was temporarily replaced by a Ben 10 thematic pop-up channel, the channel reverted to Cartoon Network +1 in July 2018.  Cartoon Network HD  In September 2011, Cartoon Network HD launched on Sky. In January 2013, Cartoon Network HD launched on Virgin Media's cable TV platform. Virgin On Demand service In April 2007, Cartoon Network launched onto Virgin Media's On Demand system, thus allowing Virgin Media customers to watch Cartoon Network programmes whenever they like. They can also take advantage of pause, rewind and fast forward functions, when watching these programmes.

On February 24, 1918, Malovishersky Uyezd was established and Malaya Vishera became its seat.Snytko et al., p. 35 In 1921, Malaya Vishera was granted town status. In August 1927, the uyezds were abolished and, effective October 1, 1927, Malovishersky District was established, with the administrative center in Malaya Vishera.Snytko et al., p. 85 Novgorod Governorate was abolished as well and the district became a part of Novgorod Okrug of Leningrad Oblast. On July 23, 1930, the okrugs were abolished and the districts were directly subordinated to the oblast. During World War II, between October 23 and December 22, 1941, Malaya Vishera was occupied by German troops.Snytko et al., p. 114 It became the eighth Soviet town liberated by Soviet troops in 1941 and the first one among those which were not subsequently re-occupied. On July 5, 1944, Malovishersky District was included into the newly established Novgorod Oblast and remained there ever since.Snytko et al., p. 93 Administrative and municipal status Within the framework of administrative divisions, Malaya Vishera serves as the administrative center of Malovishersky District.Law #559-OZ As an administrative division, it is, together with seven rural localities, incorporated within Malovishersky District as the town of district significance of Malaya Vishera.Resolution #121 As a municipal division, the town of district significance of Malaya Vishera is incorporated within Malovishersky Municipal District as Malovisherskoye Urban Settlement.Law #356-OZ Economy=Industry In the past, the economy of Malaya Vishera was dependent on the glass-making factory, which started to experience serious difficulties in the 1990s‚Äì2000s. Currently, it relies on timber industry (including production of furniture), food industry, and production of instruments. Transportation Malaya Vishera railway station A train depot was opened in Malaya Vishera in 1860. Many long-distance trains (including Moscow‚ÄìSt. Petersburg) stop at this station. The station is also an important terminus of the regional suburban trains from Okulovka, Volkhovstroy, and St. Petersburg. Malaya Vishera is connected by roads with the M10 Highway and with Lyubytino. The M10 passes west of the town. Culture and recreation Malaya Vishera contains eight objects protected as cultural and historical heritage of local significance. Malaya Vishera hosts the Malaya Vishera District Museum, the only museum in the district. The museum exhibits collections of local interest.

This makes it the larger of the two major steel plants in the UK and one of the largest in Europe. Over 4,000 people work at the plant. The majority of the slab is rolled on-site at Port Talbot and at the Newport Llanwern site to make a variety of steel strip products. The remainder is processed at other Tata Steel plants or sold in slab form. The works covers a large area of land which dominates the south of the town. Its two blast furnaces and steel production plant buildings are major landmarks visible from both the M4 motorway and the South Wales Main Line when passing through the town. History Blast Furnace #5 The site at Margam is made up of a number of plants across a large site, developed since 1901. Port Talbot works The original works were built by Gilbertson, and situated south of Port Talbot railway station. Constructed in 1901‚Äì5, the works was named after Christopher Rice Mansel Talbot of Margam Castle, the principal sponsor of the developments at Port Talbot docks, which had opened in 1837. The site was closed in 1961 and demolished in 1963. The General Offices housed Port Talbot magistrates' court until 2012, but the rest of the site is an industrial estate. Margam works Steelmaking at the Port Talbot complex began with the Margam Iron and Steel Works, completed between 1923 and 1926. Abbey works Ironworks at Port Talbot Abbey Steelworks was planned in 1947, but today is correctly termed Tata Steel Strip Products UK Port Talbot Works. It is believed to be named after the Cistercian Margam Abbey that used to be on the site ‚Äì a small amount of the original building still stands (protected) within the site that survived the dissolution of the monasteries. Several steel manufacturers in South Wales pooled their resources to form the Steel Company of Wales, to construct a modern integrated steelworks on a site then owned by Guest, Keen and Baldwins. However, political manoeuvring led to tinplate production being retained in its original heartland further west, at two new works in Trostre and Felindre. Opened in 1951, it was fully operational by 1953. Once the new No.4 and 5 furnaces began production, the older furnaces, numbers 1 and 2 built in the 1920s, were demolished. No.3 furnace, built in 1941, was retained and used as a stand-by, until demolished in the mid-2000s.https://www.architecture.com/image-library/RIBApix/image- information/poster/margam-steel-works-abbey-works-for-the-steel-company-of- wales-limited-port-talbot-west-glamorgan-the/posterid/RIBA25361.html At the time of peak employment in the 1960s, the Abbey Works was Europe's largest steelworks and the largest single employer in Wales, with a labour force of 18,000. In 1967, The Steel Company of Wales was nationalised and absorbed into British Steel Corporation, which was subsequently privatised and merged to form Corus Group. Tata Group agreed to purchase all Corus' ordinary shares in March 2007, and the deal was concluded in April 2007. In 2010 it was announced that Corus was to be rebranded to the group name of Tata Steel Europe. Today EWS Class 66 heads towards Margam Knuckle Yard with a load of steel empties An integrated steelmaking site using imported ore and coal, together with Llanwern steelworks, the plants produced up to 3.5 million tonnes of hot rolled and cold rolled annealed in steel coils per annum, for a variety of different end uses. Output is taken by rail from Margam Knuckle Yard to: Shotton for coating; Trostre for tinplating; or direct to the Midlands motor industry and domestic goods. On the extensive steelworks site, fume and water vapour from, predominantly, Coke Oven Quench towers, Sinter Plant Stacks and cooling towers can be observed from many miles away together with ignited by- product gasses from various production units. When exiting Port Talbot in an easterly direction, the Abbey Works steel products plant (which is over long) is clearly visible. The smell of sulphur often hangs over this part of the town. Top Gear have used the Port Talbot steelworks a number of times to film. Director Terry Gilliam cited the Port Talbot Steelworks as a major initial influence in developing the movie Brazil. Divestment Tata Steel announced on 30 March 2016 it is to pull out of its UK operations, including Port Talbot. It provided as reasons \\"imports of Chinese steel, high energy costs and weak demand \\". Plans to save the steelworks were put on hold when potential buyers indicated their intention to withdraw from the bidding process due to the UK voting in favour of withdrawing from the EU. The jobs of 4000 employees at the site are at stake. Fatal accidents An explosion at the Port Talbot plant in November 2001 killed three men. Len Radford, 53, Stephen Galsworthy, 25, and Andrew Hutin, 20, died when blast furnace five erupted, sending molten liquid down on them. Twelve other men were seriously injured in the blast. The blast had effectively destroyed No.5, which was rebuilt and resumed operation from 2003 onwards.https://www.letsrecycle.com/news/latest-news/corus-to-rebuild-port- talbot-furnace/ In July 2012 Tata Steel were fined ¬£500,000 over the 2006 death of worker Kevin Downey at the Port Talbot plant. Engulfed in steam and left disorientated during a night shift, Downey wandered into a channel of molten slag heated to 1500¬∞C. He was rescued by colleagues, but suffered 85% burns and died later that day. At the time of the accident the Port Talbot plant was controlled by Corus Steel UK, and taken over by Tata in 2007.

History Originating as a 15-minute program at WMBI in Chicago by host Mike Flynn, it only aired for 13 episodes. After taking a job in Tulsa, Oklahoma, Flynn began broadcasting another early version of The Folk Sampler, from first KBEZ then at KRAV. This incarnation ended following Flynn's graduation. After moving to Siloam Springs, Arkansas, he began broadcasting the now hour-long program in 1978. In 1982 the program became syndicated initially through American Public Radio then through NPR. Each week's show has a theme which all songs featured fit into either by release date or actual song theme. It is reported that he spends 15‚Äì20 hours a week preparing each show. Host Flynn grew up in sparsely populated rural Kansas. He studied broadcasting at the University of Tulsa, Oklahoma and worked on stations KRAV and KBEZ, with a period working in Chicago on WMBI. He then worked as a news anchor and weatherman on KOTV Channel 6 in Tulsa. He moved to John Brown University to teach communications, retiring as head of department in 1999. In 1977 he and his wife, Sandy Flynn, moved to Siloam Springs, Arkansas bordering the Arkansas Ozarks, starting The Folk Sampler, with his wife as co-producer. In 1993, Sandy died; although Mike had threatened to quit doing music if she died before him, she had been able to convince him that carrying on the folk music tradition would be just what he needed. He continues to carry the tradition with each week's broadcast. In the broadcast of April 21, 2018, Flynn announced that he will be retiring and that The Folk Sampler will be ceasing production with episodes airing through June. Repeats still air on some public radio stations that carried the show first-run.

In Jewish mysticism the Chamber of Guf, also called the Otzar (◊î÷∏◊ê◊ï÷π◊¶÷∏◊®, Hebrew for \\"treasury\\"), is the Treasury of Souls, located in the Seventh Heaven. Tree of Souls According to Jewish mythology, in the Garden of Eden there is a Tree of life, or the \\"Tree of Souls\\",Origins of the Kabbalah that blossoms and produces new souls, which fall into the Guf, the \\"Treasury of Souls\\". Gabriel reaches into the treasury and takes out the first soul that comes into his hand. Then Lailah, the Angel of Conception, watches over the embryo until it is born. According to Rabbi Isaac Luria, the trees are resting places for souls; sparrows can see the soul's descent, explaining their joyous chirping. The Tree of Souls produces all the souls that have ever existed, or will ever exist. When the last soul descends, the world will come to an end.Tree of Souls: The Mythology of Judaism According to the Talmud, Yevamot 62a, the Messiah will not come until the Guf is emptied of all its souls. In keeping with other Jewish legends that envision souls as bird-like, the Guf is sometimes described as a columbarium, or birdhouse. The mystic significance of the Guf is that each person is important and has a unique role which only he or she, with his or her unique soul, can fulfill. Even a newborn baby brings the Messiah closer simply by being born. The peculiar idiom of describing the treasury of souls as a \\"body\\" may be connected to the mythic tradition of Adam Kadmon, the primordial man. Adam Kadmon, God's \\"original intention\\" for humanity, was a supernal being, androgynous and macro-cosmic (co-equal in size with the universe). When this Adam sinned, humanity was demoted to the flesh and blood, bifurcated and mortal creatures we are now. According to Kabbalah, every human soul is just a fragment (or fragments) cycling out of the great \\"world-soul\\" of Adam Kadmon. Hence, every human soul comes from the guf [of Adam Kadmon].

The body, as she expressed it, is multiple: it is more than one but it is also less than many (since the different versions of the body also overlap in health care practices). This is an empirical argument about ontology (which is the branch of philosophy that explores being, existence, or the categories of being.) As a part of this she also developed the notion of 'ontological politics', arguing that since realities or the conditions of possibility vary between practices, this means that they are not given but might be changed.

Surging glaciers cluster around a few areas. High concentrations of surging glaciers occur in the Karakoram, Pamir Mountains, Svalbard, the Canadian Arctic islands, Alaska and Iceland, although overall it is estimated that only one percent of all the world‚Äôs glaciers ever surge.Jiskoot, Hester and Murray, Tavi; ‚ÄòControls on the distribution of surge-type glaciers in Svalbard‚Äô; Journal of Glaciology, 46(154), pp. 412-422 (June 2000) In some glaciers, surges can occur in fairly regular cycles, with 15 to 100 or more surge events per year. In other glaciers, surging remains unpredictable.Summerfield, Michael A., 1991, Global Geomorphology, an introduction to the study of landforms, Pearson, Prentice Hall. Harlow, England In some glaciers, however, the period of stagnation and build-up between two surges typically lasts 10 to 200 years and is called the quiescent phase. Dowdeswell, J. A., B. Unwin, A. M. Nuttall and D. J. Wingham. 1999. Velocity structure, flow instability and mass flux on a large Arctic ice cap from satellite radar interferometry. Elsevier Science B.V. During this period the velocities of the glacier are significantly lower, and the glaciers can retreat substantially. Types Glacier surges have been divided into two categories depending on the character of the surge event. Glaciers in Alaska exhibit surges with a sudden onset, an extremely high maximum flow rate (tens of meters/day) and a sudden termination, often with a discharge of stored water. These are called Alaskan- type surges and it is suspected that these surges are hydrologically controlled.Sharp, M., 1988, Surging glaciers: geomorphic effects, Progress in Physical geography, http://ppg.sagepub.com Surges in Svalbard typically exhibit different behavior. Svalbard surges are typically associated with slower onset with an acceleration phase, rising to a maximum velocity which is typically slower (up to four or five meters per day) than Alaskan surges, and a return to quiescence often taking years.Jiskoot, H. and D. T. Juhlin, 2009, Surge of a small East Greenland glacier, 2001‚Äì2007, suggests Svalbard-type surge mechanism, Journal of Glaciology, Vol. 55, No. 191, pp. 567‚Äì570Murray, T., T. Strozzi, A.

Res., 108(B5), 2237, Features observed during the active or surge phase include potholes, known as lacunasPost, A. 1969, Distribution of surging glaciers in western North America, J. Glaciol., 8(53), 229-240. and medial moraines.Benn, Douglas I. and David J. A. Evans, Glaciers and Glaciation, Hodder Arnold, 1997 (verification and page number needed) Examples of events In the Norwegian Arctic, Svalbard is an archipelago containing hundreds of glaciers. Svalbard is more than 60% covered by glaciers and of these glaciers, hundreds have been observed to surge. Glacial surges in the Karakoram occur in the presence of \\"extreme uplift and denudation.\\" In 1980, there were several mini-surges of Variegated Glacier in Alaska. Mini surges typically show lag times of basal flow of 5‚Äì10 hours, which correlates to differences between the surging part of a glacier and the output of water and sediment. When the 1982 surge ended on July 5, there was a large flood event that day, and more flooding in the following days. What Humphrey found in his study is that behind the glacial surge zone, there are predominantly low basal water velocities, and high sliding rates before the rapid release of large quantities of water.Humphrey, Neil Frank. Basal Hydrology of a Surge-Type Glacier: Observations and Theory Relating to Variegated Glacier. University of Washington, 1987 Causes There have been many theories of why glacial surges occur. Hydrological control Surges may be caused by the supply of meltwater to the base of a glacier. Meltwater is important in reducing frictional forces to glacial ice flow. The distribution and pressure of water at the bed modulates the glacier's velocity and therefore mass balance. Meltwater may come from a number of sources, including supraglacial lakes, geothermal heating of the bed, conduction of heat into the glacier and latent heat transfers. There is a positive feedback between velocity and friction at the bed, high velocities will generate more frictional heat and create more meltwater. Crevassing is also enhanced by greater velocity flow which will provide further rapid transmission paths for meltwater flowing towards the bed. However, Humphrey found no precise correlation between ice-slow down and the release of water inside of a glacier. The evolution of the drainage system under the glacier plays a key role in surge cycles. Thermal regime Glaciers that exhibit surges like those in Svalbard; with slower onset phase, and a longer termination phase may be thermally controlled rather than hydrologically controlled.Fowler, A. C., Murray, T. and Ng, F.S.L., Thermal regulation of glacier surging, Journal of Glaciology, 47(159), 527-538, 2001 These surges tend to last for longer periods of time than hydrologically controlled surges. Deformable bed hypothesis In other cases, the geology of the underlying country rock may dictate surge frequency. For example, poorly consolidated sedimentary rocks are more prone to failure under stress; a sub-glacial \\"landslip\\" may permit the glacier to slide. This explains why surging glaciers tend to cluster in certain areas. Critical mass Meier and PostMeier, M.F. and Post, A.S., 1969, What are glacier surges? Canadian Journal of Earth Sciences 6, 807-817 suggest that once mass accumulates to a critical point, basal melting begins to occur. This provides a buoyancy force, \\"lifting\\" the glacier from the bed and reducing the friction force. ReferencesBibliography *[Dowdeswell,J.A., B. Unwin, A. -M. Nuttall and D. J. Wingham. 1999.

One source states he was ejected from the Cortona studio in 1631, soon after joining the workshop. Getty Biography. Others state Testa trained under Pietro Paolini or under Domenichino, for whom he worked under the patronage of Cassiano dal Pozzo.Wittkower, p. 323. He was friends with Nicolas Poussin and Francesco Mola. Some of his etchings, which often include work in drypoint, have a fantastic quality reminiscent of Jacques Callot, or embellishments of his Genoese contemporary Giovanni Benedetto Castiglione and even presciently suggest William Blake. His Sacrifice of Iphigenia appears to have influenced Tiepolo's rendition at Villa Valmarana (Ai Nani) in Vicenza. His early prints, from the 1630s, were often religious and were influenced by Federico Barocci. These achieve very delicate effects of light; his later ones became harder and more austere in style, as he attempted a personal version of neo-classicism, under the influence of the Carracci. Many of his later subjects were original classical subjects, the most ambitious reflecting his personal struggles. His prints were successful and frequently copied. Between 1638 and 1644, Testa completed what is perhaps his most important work, a set of complex and highly detailed etchings on the theme of The Seasons, which served as an expression of his interest in Platonic philosophy. Sympathetic contemporaries considered these his \\"finest and most important works.\\"Kammen, pp. 57-8. Testa was influenced by Leonardo da Vinci to favor direct observation of natural phenomena, a fact that may have limited his productivity as an artist and might even have caused his death. Accounts of Testa's death are confused and contradictory, some suggesting murder or suicide (Testa was described as melancholic in temperament). Yet his earliest biographer, the 17th-century author Filippo Baldinucci, indicates that the death was accidental. Commenting on Testa's habit of \\"depicting night scenes and changes in the atmosphere and in the sky,\\" Baldinucci states that Testa was standing on a Tiber riverbank, \\"drawing and observing some reflections of the rainbow in the water,\\" when he fell in and drowned.Gage, p. 96. Testa was the protagonist of a series of frustrated projects and problematic dealings wit his various patrons, among which there was his closely friend Niccol√≤ Simonelli.

Customers provide the company with specific information about the essay, including: a page length, a general topic, and a time frame with which to work. The customer is then charged a certain amount per page. The similar essay bank concept is a company from which students can purchase pre-written but less expensive essays on various topics, at higher risk of being caught. Both forms of business are under varying legal restraints in some jurisdictions. History The idea behind term paper mills can be dated back to the mid-nineteenth century in which \\"paper reservoirs\\" were located in the basements of fraternity houses. Otherwise known as \\"fraternity files,\\" these essay banks were practices in which students shared term papers and submitted work that had been done by other students. These essay banks inspired the commercialization of ghostwritten essay-writing practices. As early as the 1950s, advertisements were circulating college campus that described services that included ghostwritten work for dissertations, theses, and term papers. In conjunction with this practice, the changing attitudes of students in the 1960s and 1970s started to stray away from diligent and engaged course work because they saw an emphasis on the benefits of community involvement. A new focus on activities outside of the classroom took away from time to focus on class work, thus promoting these writing services throughout college campuses. Soon, actual businesses were providing custom-written essays for students in exchange for compensation. They were located near college campuses. One could walk into a building and peruse pricing pamphlets, speak to someone directly to place an order, or possibly make a selection from a vault of recycled research papers stored in the basement of these businesses. Products and services \\"Essay mill\\" companies hire university students, graduates, and professional writers to ghostwrite essays and term papers, and solicit business from university and college students by posting advertisements. Until the early 1990s, most essay mill companies were 'bricks and mortar' businesses offering their services by mail-order or from offices located in university or college towns. By the 2000s, most essay mill businesses have switched to an e-commerce business model, soliciting business and selling essays using an Internet website. Companies often provide free sample essays on popular topics to attract Internet searches. To obtain an essay, a customer usually submits a form that describes the assignment that he or she wants completed, how many pages it needs to be, and when it needs to be completed by. On the opposite end of the transaction, the employee searches through requests until he or she finds something that looks interesting, that he or she can write quickly and that will satisfy the page requirement. It does not matter if the writer has previous knowledge about the subject; if it is easy to research, he or she will get the job done. Depending on how much a student pays an essay mill, a student can receive a number of different products. The most expensive of these products would be a full-written essay (or even a dissertation) that a student can turn in. Requested papers can follow specific guidelines laid out by the student including the use of a certain amount of sources, a preselected topic, and the receiving of specific grade by the student. Some students may request to receive a high mark on a purchased essay in order to boost their Grade Point Average (GPA), while some may deliberately order an essay that will give them a \\"C\\" in order to reduce suspicion of academic fraud. One of the cheaper options an essay mill might offer is just a detailed outline of information a student should include in an essay that a student will write themselves. Due to the nature of this type of transaction, purchasing an outline is very hard for schools to catch as a form of an academic dishonesty. Similar to essay mills, an essay bank is a company where students can go to purchase pre-written essays. Due to the nature of essay bank essays, students may find themselves more likely to be caught for committing academic dishonesty. As a result of this, essay bank essays in general may cost less than those from essay mills. Legal status The first major legal battle against an essay mill came in 1972 in the case of State of New York v. .Decision, State of New York v. Saksniit , 69 Misc.2d 554 (1972). New York State Supreme Court, Special Term, New York County. April 18, 1972. Via Leagle.com. Accessed: August 12, 2015. This case involved the state challenging an essay mill's business with reference to the New York Education Law. The law \\"condemns the obtaining of a degree by fraudulent means or 'aiding and abetting' another to do the same.\\" The state claimed that the students were using the term papers they purchased for credit and even though the company stated that the essays they wrote were for research purposes only, their advertising scheme encouraged otherwise by boasting about grades. The court determined that the disclaimers did not sufficiently protect the company because their encouragement of cheating and plagiarism hurt the educational system. The ruling called for the company to cease business in the State of New York. Several other legal battles have been fought since and have largely resulted in the punishment of the term paper writers rather than the students purchasing them. California Education Code Section 66400 \\"penalizes the preparation or sale of term papers, thesis, or dissertations for compensation ....\\" The law is applicable when the preparer/seller knew or should have known that the recipient would submit the paper for academic credit. State residents or academic institutions \\"acting for the interest of itself, its students, or the general public\\" can file suit against offenders for \\"any relief as is necessary.\\" This law differs from that of New York in various ways, including holding the vendor responsible even if it claims that the paper was not intended to be turned in for credit, if the court concludes that it should have known that it would, or if the claim is not credible. For example, while some essay mills state that their products are not intended to be submitted for credit, they may also boast of the high grades that their papers have received. The 2011 Florida Statutes Section 877.17 states that it is a second degree misdemeanor to \\"sell, offer to sell, or advertise for sale\\" a \\"written, recorded, pictorial, artistic, or other assignment\\" to another for submission \\"unaltered to a substantial degree.\\" In the state of Florida, second degree misdemeanors are punishable by up to sixty days in prison. Criticism and controversy The academic community has criticized essay mill companies for helping students to commit academic fraud. Some essay mills have defended themselves against criticism by claiming that they are selling pre-written examples which students can use as guidelines and models for the student's own work. In 2002, a UK-based essay mill called Elizabeth Hall Associates required students purchasing essays to sign a disclaimer stating that \\"any material provided by Elizabeth Hall Associates [is] on the understanding that it is a guidance model only.\\" Other essay mills claim that they are \\"scholarly publishing houses\\" that provide students with essays that the student can then cite in the student's own work. Students from different academic backgrounds have used essay mills. Many prestigious universities and colleges have caught their students turning in papers they bought from essay mills. The University of California, San Diego caught 600 students cheating in one year. One of the forms of cheating was turning in papers bought from essay mills. Using term paper mills brings up some ethical controversies. Some people view essay mills as unethical while others view it as completely moral. People view essay mills as ethical for different reasons. Some customers indicate that they use essay mills as a form of proof reading. Essay mill writers will read their writing only to make comments and feedback about content and grammar mistakes. They also turn to essay mills to insure that all citations are correct. Some customers claim that they turn to essay mills because society has put too much pressure on students to achieve academic success. GPAs and grades are greatly stressed in schools which causes students to worry and make them feel like they cannot meet their deadlines. In order to get the paper handed in on time, students seek out term paper mills. Essay mills have been compared to business situations. Certain students and customers view term paper mills as equivalent to companies outsourcing labor. Outsourcing labor is a norm for businesses which insinuates that the use of term paper mills should be socially acceptable. Conversely, there are people who view purchasing essays from essay mills as unethical: it is a form of cheating and plagiarism because one person is taking credit of another individual's work. Academic institutions are concerned about how essay mills affect learning. Students who use essay mills do not go through the process of gathering research, which is a learning experience in itself. Some professors, such as Dan Ariely, a professor of psychology and behavioral economics at Duke University and the author of The (Honest) Truth About Dishonesty, worry about the message that term paper mills send to students. He believes that the existence of essay mills encourages laziness to be seen as acceptable. Ariely found essay mills that use plagiarism-encouraging language on their websites. Students generally know that using essay mill services is unethical; according to a study conducted Patrick Scanlon and David Neumann, 90% of students surveyed admitted that the practice is unethical. The same study showed that students believe around 20% of their peers frequently use these online services. Many customers believe that when they are ordering an essay online, that they are going to be receiving one from their own country; however, this is not always the case, as many essay mill companies are hosted around the world. Not only are many of the essay mill companies hosted overseas, but many of the writers for these companies do not have graduate degrees, and have learned English as their second language. Having essay mills set up internationally allows for the owners of these companies to make high profits by paying wages in low-wage countries while selling the work of their employees in high-wage countries. A 2009 article in The Chronicle of Higher Education stated that overseas writers only get paid between $1 and $3 per page out of the $20 to $30 US-customers pay per page. Compared to US-based writers that work for essay mills, this is a very low rate. Another article in The Chronicle of Higher Education from 2010 interviewed an American essay mill writer, who stated that he receives half of the money paid by a client for a paper. Within the US, the amount that writers are paid varies by up to a factor of five . Some US writers earn around $1,000 per month in their highest paying months, which, , is a low wage. Some of the better writers are able to earn up to $5,000 per month. Strategies for combating academic fraud Universities and colleges have developed several strategies to combat this type of academic misconduct. Some professors require students to submit electronic versions of their term papers, so that the text of the essay can be compared by anti-plagiarism software (such as Turnitin) against databases of known \\"essay mill\\" term papers, and new software called Authorship Investigate, also by Turnitin, can look at a paper and compare it against a student's other writings to yield a probabilistic estimate of whether the student is the real author. Other universities have enacted rules allowing professors to give students oral examinations on papers which a professor believes to be ghostwritten; if the student is unfamiliar with the content of an essay that he has submitted, or its sources, then the student can be charged with academic fraud, a violation of the rules by which a student agrees to be bound when he enters a university or college program. When a student is charged with academic fraud, his case is typically heard by a quasi-judicial administrative committee, which reviews the evidence. For students who are found guilty, the punishments range from a grade of zero on the specific assignment, to failure in the course in which the plagiarism occurred, to (in extreme or repeated cases) suspension or expulsion from the institution. In some cases, students who have committed academic fraud may also have academic honors, degrees, or awards revoked.

It was written by Charlotte Gordon Cumming during a trip to Kenya, Africa, where she was inspired to compose it based on her experiences there. Produced by Ron Tom, \\"Soul Sound\\" is a pop song featuring guitar and bass instrumentation. It was released in the United Kingdom on 16 July 2001 as the album's fourth and final single. Critics praised the song for the group's demeanour although some regarded it as inferior in comparison to the album's other tracks. To promote the song, a music video was directed by Max & Dania; it features the Sugababes in an apartment where their souls are released by the music. The trio performed \\"Soul Sound\\" at Manchester Ampersand and at the London Notre Dame Hall. The song became the group's lowest-charting single at the time, peaking at number thirty on the UK Singles Chart, and remains one of their lowest-selling singles to date. It was the final single that they released through London Records. It was also their last single to feature original member Siobh√°n Donaghy, who left the group shortly after the song's release, until the original group members reformed as Mutya Keisha Siobhan (later regaining the Sugababes name) in 2011.https://uk.news.yahoo.com/original-sugababes-name-new- music-143506245.html Background and composition \\"Soul Sound\\" was written by the Scottish musician Charlotte Gordon Cumming during her trip to Kenya. Her inspiration to write the song stemmed from Africa, a continent which she visited frequently with her family as a child. According to Cumming, \\"In Africa I feel extremely alive, but also very small. The song was the essence of how I felt: seeing the beauty and horror of a place, and going into a heightened state.\\" She elaborated, \\"My songs are all about who I am and what I am feeling, which is why they can take so much out of me to perform‚Äîand I always feel a lot when I go to Africa\\". Cumming had spent a year with the Sugababes while they recorded their debut studio album One Touch (2000); according to the Daily Record, the trio's management were desperate for them to sing \\"Soul Sound\\". The song was produced by Ron Tom, who mixed and programmed it in collaboration with Mark Frank. Individuals who provide backing vocals on the song include Xavier Barnet and the Kenyan-born British singer Lamya. \\"Soul Sound\\" was recorded at the Matrix Recording Studios in London, England. \\"Soul Sound\\" is a pop record that experiments with pop-rock balladry. The song features guitar and bass instrumentation, and according to the Daily Mail, evokes the music of harmony groups from the 1960s. John Mulvey of NME characteristed the song as having \\"tasteful slippery beats, tasteful acoustic guitars, [and] the usual indolent harmonies\\". The song's lyrics immediately begin with a sense of decision through the line \\"I Touch the sky\\", and largely focus on the enjoyment of life. Reception=Critical \\"Soul Sound\\" received mixed to positive reviews from critics. The Sunday Mirrors Ian Hyland rated the song nine out of ten stars and described it as \\"[p]ure class from the ever-smiling teens\\". According to AllMusic's Dean Carlson, \\"Soul Sound\\" is a representation that \\"the jitters of youth are [on One Touch] though tempered by shrewd ambition and a clever and unpredictable production aesthetic\\". John Mulvey of NME stated that while the song lacked the quality of the trio's debut single \\"Overload\\", it \\"is pretty good nevertheless\\". He elaborated, \\"the best thing about Sugababes is how they sound like they really can't be arsed with anything, let alone any of this pop star business [...] Enough with the dance routines and shit-eating grins‚Äîdoes this mean total lack of enthusiasm's the way forward for teen pop?\\" Stylus Magazine writer Scott Plagenhoef described the single as \\"marvelous lilting [and] hopeful\\", while Stephen Robinson from Hot Press was less favourable and criticised the song's pop-rock experimentation, which according to him \\"doesn't work quite so well\\". Neil Western of the South China Morning Post felt that \\"Soul Sound\\", along with the album's title track, \\"lack sparkle\\". Commercial The song was released in the United Kingdom on 16 July 2001 as the fourth and final single from One Touch. Upon release, it debuted and peaked at number thirty on the UK Singles Chart, the group's lowest-charting single in the United Kingdom at the time. In the UK, \\"Soul Sound\\" is one of the group's lowest-selling singles to date. Unlike the previous singles from One Touch, \\"Soul Sound\\" failed to make an impact on the Irish Singles Chart. The song earned the Sugababes a 2001 MTV Awards nomination for Best European Single. Promotion Shortly following the release of \\"Soul Sound\\", Donaghy left the group, which was later dropped by London Records. Music video The accompanying music video for \\"Soul Sound\\" was directed by Max & Dania and filmed in London. Band member Siobh√°n Donaghy stated that around the time of the video's filming, her and the other group members were not performing as a group frequently: \\"It's been fairly quiet recently, but it usually is between singles. The other two have been doing their exams, and I have been doing some interviews for newspapers and magazines abroad. Apart from the video for 'Soul Sound' we have not been doing too much together.\\" During the video, the group's members are featured in an apartment and are seated on couches and chairs. The plot involves their inner souls being released by the music, while outside in the neighbourhood the music takes control of other people's lives and causes their souls to be lifted too. The video was included on the CD release of \\"Soul Sound\\". In a 2020 interview on Clara Amfo's \\"This City\\" podcast, Keisha recalled that during the filming of the video, the group had their first true \\"music industry\\" moment, where she felt the record label executives were trying to mould the group into something it wasn't. \\"We were told, you've got to smile, you've got to be more smiley [in this video]. When I look at that moment, that was the start of trying to be controlled. Whereas, up until that point, we were... just being ourselves. I remember them saying, you guys need to be more approachable. The more voices that were coming in, the more it was about needing to smile more.\\" Siobhan chimed in: \\"I didn't love the Soul Sound video, probably for that very reason.\\" Live performances The Sugababes played \\"Soul Sound\\" on 27 March 2001 at Manchester Ampersand, in conjunction with many of the album's tracks such as \\"Overload\\" and \\"Run for Cover\\". This was their second-ever live performance, which was sponsored by NME. Donaghy commented, According to Kitty Empire of NME, during the performance, \\"'Soul Sound' [grew] lovelier with every croon of its chorus\\". Later that month, the trio performed the song at London's Notre Dame Hall as part of a set list. The Guardians John Aizlewood commented that during its performance, the group \\"[created] a tidal wave of melody\\". Impact The group's members were dissatisfied with the release of \\"Soul Sound\\" as a single, because they wanted to venture into an R&B; sound whereas their record label London Records pushed them into a more pop direction. Soon after the song's release, Donaghy left the group and was replaced by former Atomic Kitten member Heidi Range, making it the last Sugababes single to feature her vocals.Sheridan, 2007. pp 81‚Äì82. Further, the sales of One Touch and its last three singles, \\"New Year\\", \\"Run for Cover\\" and \\"Soul Sound\\", failed to meet the expectations of London Records and the group was subsequently dropped. Band member Keisha Buchanan has stated that the song's release and subsequent commercial underperformance was a positive experience because, saying: \\"Everything happens for a reason and it looks like it has all worked out\\". \\"Soul Sound\\" was featured in the 2001 film Summer Catch, which stars such actors as Freddie Prinze Jr. and Jessica Biel.

Like the surrounding towns, it has seen a sharp increase in its population in the last ten years as people migrate south from the South Wales Valleys, and west from the capital city of Cardiff. Pontyclun translates from the Welsh language as 'bridge [over] the River Clun', the Clun being a tributary of the River Ely that runs through Pontyclun. A bridge crosses the Afon Clun just above its confluence with the Ely. The village is served by Pontyclun railway station on the South Wales Main Line. It has its own local rugby club. The village falls under the remit of Pontyclun Community Council, which represents the communities of Brynsadler, Castell y Mwnws, Groes-faen, Miskin, Mwyndy, Pontyclun, Talygarn, and Ynysddu History It was the influx of workers for the iron ore and coal mining industries, together with the coming of the South Wales Railway (in 1851) that changed Pontyclun from a farm with just four to five households into a burgeoning Victorian industrial town. The Coedcae Colliery (first listed in 1856) and the Bute iron ore mine (which opened in October 1852) caused the population growth. By 1871, the census returns record an influx of Cornish miners who had suffered from the collapse of the copper mining industry in Cornwall. By 1870 the industries of the area had been expanded by the coming of the Ely Tin Plate Works, The Pipe Works and The Steam Joinery Company. Administration The Community Council was formed in 1985 and consists of eleven elected Community Councillors who are all residents of the area. They act on behalf of local people to try and preserve the best aspects of the villages, while also encouraging and supporting developments that will benefit the whole community and ensure that it will continue to thrive. The Community Council monitors all local planning applications and, where appropriate, suggests amendments or submits written objections. Electoral ward Pont-y-clun was an electoral ward to Mid Glamorgan County Council electing one county councillor from 1989 and 1993 elections, subsequently (from 1995) becoming a ward to Rhondda Cynon Taf County Borough Council, electing two councillors. Religion Bethel Baptist Chapel was built circa 1876. Bethel relocated to Bethel Baptist Church Centre on Heol Miskin in 1993. Cwrt Bethel is on the site of the old chapel. St Paul's church, Pontyclun was erected in 1895 as a district church within the Anglican parish of Llantrisant. In 1924, the new parish of Pontyclun and Talygarn was constituted from the parish of Llantrisant. Bethel Baptist Church, Hope Presbyterian Church and St Paul's Church are still active places of worship. Schools & education The village is served by Y Pant School, a secondary school with about 1,150 pupils, situated in the village of Talbot Green. In 2000 it was ranked 49th in Wales in terms of its GCSE results (based on 5 GCSEs, grades A-C). Since then, exam results have improved dramatically and according to the latest inspection report from Estyn, the school now has a pass rate of 72% which means it is in equal 19th place in Wales, or in the top 10%. It is also the best performing secondary school in Rhondda Cynon Taf, just ahead of St. John the Baptist School (Aberdare). The village also houses Pontyclun Primary school which achieved above average results in all foundation subjects in the most recent Estyn reports.Contents Sport Pontyclun rugby union club Pontyclun has both a football and rugby union team. Pontyclun Football Club were formed in 1896 and joined the Football Association of Wales in 1922. Pontyclun Rugby Football Club (otherwise known as the Pontyclun Badgers), were formed in 1886 and joined the Welsh Rugby Union in 1887. Pontyclun has produced at least one Welsh international, Tommy Rees who later played rugby league for Great Britain, and Oldham. Pontyclun also has produced an International Footballer - Keith Pontin (Cardiff City and Wales) Pontyclun also has a number of other sports clubs including Pontyclun Flyers (Cycling) and Pontyclun Road Runners (Running) Crown Brewery The South Wales & Monmouth United Clubs Brewery Co. Ltd. purchased the small family brewery owned by D & T Davies in 1919. This Company had been formed to supply the expanding number of Workingmen's Clubs, which were having difficulties with supply of beer from the many local breweries throughout the area. The Sunday Closing (Wales) Act of 1881 had fuelled the expanding number of clubs that did not have to close on Sunday, as was the case with public houses. By 1936 the brewery was producing 500 barrels per week, which continued to increase to 900 in 1938. This growth was halted by the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939 but when the war ended in 1945 the growth took off again. By 1954 the old brewery had been replaced by a completely new building that was big enough to produce the 1,200 barrels per week that the clubs demanded at that time. In 1984 Bob Smith was head brewer for the company and was only the fifth in the 65 years the company had been trading. In 1988 Crown merged with Wales' oldest brewery, Buckley's of Llanelly to form the Crown Buckley Brewery. In the spring of 1999, after 80 years of trading, the brewery closed following the takeover of the company by Cardiff based Brains Brewery.

It was performed by Khattak warriors before going to wars in the time of Malik Shahbaz Khan Khattak, and then Khushal Khan Khattak. It was used as a war-preparation exercise and is known to be the only dance with swordplay. Aside from the Pashtun's classical literature, popular ballads, the Pashtunwali (the common code of social values), the khattak is part of the group's collective identify. History First World War It originated in the Pashtun regions of present-day Pakistan amongst the Khattak tribe of Pashtuns. It is a varied form of Athan, or Attan, which has been preserved in one of its earliest forms by members of the Khattak and other Pashtun tribes, including the Ghilzais. There are many regional variations of Athan. In traditional Pashtun areas, the dance Athena had the same definition and reverence attached to it as Pashtuns accord to Athan. Athena seems to appeared era while Athan survived in present eastern Afghanistan and north western Pakistan amongst Pashtuns. A journalist of Pashtun origin, Amanullah Ghilzai, traced the roots of Khattak to an ancient Greek dance. According to his theory, Khatak, or Athan, is one of the earliest forms of the ancient Greek dance dedicated to Athena. The Greeks brought this dance with them to Bactria. The Greeks had bequeathed the conventional dance for ancient Pashtun- dominated regions when they had colonised this region for several centuries ago. In ancient Greece, Athena had the same definition and reverence attached to it as Pashtuns accord to Athan. Athena seems to have disappeared in Greece during the Christian era while Athan survived in Afghanistan and Pashtun Details of the Khattak dance thumbnail Khattak style is men performing this dance with their weapons in their hands. A Khattak dancer performs with the zeal of a hero, displaying his physical fitness through body movements while holding one, two or even three swords at a time. Each sword weighs about kilograms. The dance is a 5-step routine involving spins, with the swords crossed over their backs and elbows outward, or it can be performed with the swords out to the sides and typically attain half spin in place leading to a full spin. Depending on the rhythm of the beat, this spin can be completely reversed in full synchronicity. This dance is performed with the musician tuning the beat to the technique of the performers. It is performed very quickly, set to uptempo music featuring the piper, Clarion, and drums beaten with sticks. Up to forty men dance together wielding swords or handkerchiefs and performing acrobatic feats. The fast tempo of Khattak distinguishes it from other attan, which start slowly and pick up speed as the dance progresses. A khattak dance performed at night begins with an introductory music, dominated by the slow and irregular beating of the drum called dhol, as the dancers begin to circle a couple of lanterns placed at the center. In some cases, the dancers perform around a bonfire. The steps could appear strange for an onlooker since they involve exaggerated backward and forward strides, punctuated by swordplays such as air thrusts and parries. The pace of the dance quickens along with the beat. The rhythm transitions are often accompanied by hand movements while the finale features the continuous twirling on the dancers' toes until they were completely exhausted. At this point, the dance resembled the Sufi's whirling dervishes in that it goes on until no one is left dancing. Various forms The Khattak dance and individual performance. Bangrai is derived from word Bangrai or Bhangrai (Bangle). This dance has to performed in circle. A bird's view of the performance looks like a bangle so this is why it is called Bangra or Bhangra. This is merely an exercise to warm up body muscles it is slow in rhythm and with pauses to hold sword like today soldiers hold rifle in Musketry. In the Bangra, every member swirls while carrying swords. In 1‚Äì3 circles, an unlimited number of elders, young, and children, each carrying a sword and a handkerchief, start dancing in a circle having band and surnai in the centre. At the beginning of Bhangra, few performers turn by turn sing love songs or quotations which is called \\"Takkay\\" (5-7 Takkay by each, Takkay is commonly popular in sheep herders, they sit on the hills and sing on the top of hill with high pitch, if someone there on other hill he will reply the Takkay in return and some play it with their floats), at a high pitch, which is meant to convey to the audience that they would like to be tipped for their performance. At the end of the song, the drumbeat increases and the dance goes on. Balbala is performed immediately by the same group stage with fast rhythm to sweat up the body. Balballa is staged without swords. Qamar balbala is exercise to get control on stepping and stable body balance at the top of hill and it is performed with swords. A sword is used to keep balance while moving quickly on the uneven surface of the hill. Individual performance of Khattak dance comprises 12 steps, which require great skill on the part of the dancers. The dancer alternates between performing solo and synchronizing with the rest of the troupe. Groups of two or four performers carrying a sword and a handkerchief, perform turn by turn, while the rest of the troupe members wait for their turn. In the Laila, a group of four performers holding two swords each perform stunts while moving in a circle. Braghoni is the fastest and the most adventurous of all the steps: A single dancer performs with three swords. He swings two swords in the air while holding the third in his mouth.

The first preparations for the synagogue's construction date to 1903, while the construction itself had begun on 13 November 1905. The construction of a grand new synagogue was part of the reorganization efforts of the Bulgarian Jewish community under Lemberg-born Chief Rabbi Marcus Ehrenpreis and local leaders Ezra Tadjer and Avram Davidjon Levy. Prior to the construction of the new synagogue, the lot in central Sofia had been occupied by an older synagogue. Synagogue interior One of the architectural monuments of Sofia, the synagogue, located in the very centre of the city near the Central Market Hall, can accommodate 1,300 worshippers. The Sofia Synagogue's main chandelier weighs 1.7 tons and is the largest in the country. Despite the building's size, the services are normally only attended by some 50 to 60 worshippers due to the aliyah of most of Bulgaria's Jews to Israel and the secularity of the local Jewish population. The architectural style is essentially Moorish Revival, with elements of the Vienna Secession and, in the facade, Venetian architecture. The main premise has a diameter of 20 m and is 31 m high. It is topped by an octagonal dome. The interior is richly decorated, featuring columns of Carrara marble and multicoloured Venetian mosaics, as well as decorative woodcarving. The entire building takes up 659 m¬≤. The biggest chandelier in the Balkans is there and the rumor said it is made from gold from Ancient Palestine. Since 8 May 1992 the Sofia Synagogue also houses the Jewish Museum of History, which includes the Jewish Communities in Bulgaria and the Holocaust and the Salvation of the Jews in Bulgaria expositions. A souvenir shop is also in operation.

Published in December 1899, Ibsen wrote the play between February and November of that year. The first performance was at the Haymarket Theatre in London, a day or two before publication.Watts, Peter. 1964, Notes to When We Dead Awake, p. 298 (Penguin) Plot summary Ibsen's When We Dead Awaken character pictures The first act takes place outside a spa overlooking a fjord. Sculptor Arnold Rubek and his wife Maia have just enjoyed breakfast and are reading newspapers and drinking champagne. They marvel at how quiet the spa is. Their conversation is lighthearted, but Arnold hints at a general unhappiness with his life. Maia also hints at disappointment. Arnold had promised to take her to a mountaintop to see the whole world as it is, but they have never done so. The hotel manager passes by with some guests and inquires if the Rubeks need anything. During their encounter, a mysterious woman dressed in white passes by, followed closely by a nun in black. Arnold is drawn to her for some reason. The manager does not know much about her, and he tries to excuse himself before Squire Ulfheim can spot him. Unable to do so, Ulfheim corners him and requests breakfast for his hunting dogs. Spotting the Rubeks, he introduces himself and mocks their plans to take a cruise, insisting that the water is too contaminated by other people. He is stopping at the spa on his way to a mountain hunt for bears, and he insists that the couple should join him, as the mountains are unpolluted by people. Maia takes Ulfheim up on his offer to watch his dogs eat breakfast, leaving Arnold alone with the mysterious woman. He quickly realizes that she is Irena, his former model. Irena constantly refers to herself as being 'dead'. During their conversation, she explains that posing for Arnold was akin to a kind of 'self murder', where he captured her soul and put it into his masterpiece, a sculpture called Resurrection. He confesses that he has never been the same since working with Irena. Though Resurrection brought him great fame and an abundance of other work, he feels a similar kind of death as Irena feels. Irena mysteriously alludes to killing all of her lovers since posing for Arnold. She claims to always possess a knife, and also admits to murdering every child she has had, sometimes while they are still in the womb. When Irena asks where Arnold is going after his stay at the spa, she dismisses the idea of the cruise and asks him to meet her up in the high mountains. Maia returns with Ulfheim, asking Arnold if they can abandon the cruise and join Ulfheim on his mountain hunt. Arnold tells her that she is free to do so and says that he is thinking of going that way himself. The second act takes place outside a health resort in the mountains. Maia finds Arnold beside a brook. She has spent the morning with Ulfheim. The couple return to their discussion of Arnold's unhappiness, and he confesses that he has grown tired of Maia. He wants to live with Irena because she had the key to the lock which holds his artistic inspiration. Their relationship was never sexual, because Arnold felt it would have ruined Resurrection. Maia is hurt but insists that Arnold should do as he pleases. She even suggests that perhaps the three of them could live together if she cannot find a new place to live. Irena enters, and Maia urges Arnold to speak with her. The pair cast flower petals into the brook and reminisce sentimentally about their long-ago collaboration. At one point, Arnold refers to their 'episode', and Irena draws her knife, preparing to stab him in the back. When he turns around, she hides the knife. Arnold asks Irena to come live with him and work with him again, explaining that she can unlock his artistic vision once more. She insists that there is no way to resurrect a partnership like theirs, but they agree to pretend they can. Maia returns with Ulfheim, on their way to a hunt. She is happy and explains that she feels like she is finally awake. She sings a little song to herself, \\"I am free...No longer in prison, I'll be! I'm as free as a bird, I am free!\\" The final act takes place on the rocky mountainside, with narrow paths and a shabby hunting hut. Maia and Ulfheim enter already in an argument over his sexual advances. Maia demands to be taken down to the resort. Ulfheim points out that the path is too difficult for her and she will surely die on her own. Arnold and Irena come up the path from the resort. Ulfheim is surprised that they have made it on their own, since the path is so difficult. He warns them that a storm is coming. Since he can only guide one person at a time, he agrees to take Maia down the path, and urges Irena and Arnold to take shelter in the hut until he can return with help. Irena is horrified at being rescued. She is convinced that the nun will commit her to an asylum. She draws the knife again to kill herself. Arnold insists that she should not. Irena confesses that she almost killed him earlier, but she stopped because she realized he was already dead. She explains that the love that belongs to their earthly life is dead in both of them. However, Arnold points out that they are both still free, insisting that \\"we two dead things live life for once to the full\\". Irena agrees but urges that they must do it above the clouds of the gathering storm. They agree to climb the mountain so that they can be married by the sunlight. As they happily ascend out of view, Maia's song is heard in the distance. Suddenly, an avalanche roars down the mountain. Arnold and Irene can be seen carried to their deaths. The nun has followed Irena up the mountain and witnesses the horror with a scream. After a moment of silence, she says \\"Pax vobiscum!\\" (Peace be with you), as Maia's song still lingers in the air. Themes and style The play is dominated by images of stone and petrification. The play charts a progression up into the mountains, and Rubek is a sculptor. One of Ibsen's most dreamlike plays, When We Dead Awaken is also one of his most despairing. \\"When we dead awaken,\\" Irene explains, \\"we find that we have never lived.\\" The play is suffused by an intense desire for life, but whether it can be achieved is left problematic, given the play's ironic conclusion (which is, incidentally, reminiscent of the first of Ibsen's two major verse dramas, Brand, and one of his last works in prose, The Master Builder). Some authors argue that the dark romance in the play is based on Auguste Rodin's relationship with his student, co-worker, and lover Camille Claudel. History Ibsen originally named the play The Resurrection Day, after Arnold Rubek's sculpture. Newly returned to Norway, after twenty-seven years abroad, he was thrilled to be back home. The Rubeks have also been traveling away from home for some time.Watts, Peter. 1964, Notes to When We Dead Awake, p. 298 (Penguin) Though he does not specify any location names in the play, Ibsen set the final two acts at Hardangervidda.Watts, Peter. 1964, Notes to When We Dead Awake, p. 300 (Penguin) Ibsen could not decide on a surname for his leads, pivoting between Stubow and Rambow. In the first draft, the name became Stubek on the first few pages, until he finally settled on Rubek. Although Squire Ulfheim twice refers to his hunting servant directly by name as Lars, Lars is not listed in the cast of characters.Watts, Peter. 1964, Notes to When We Dead Awake, p. 298 (Penguin) The hotel manager initially had a name, Brager, and in the original, he is an Inspector, which also means 'overseer' in Norwegian. Ibsen refers to the nun as a 'Deaconess' in the original.Watts, Peter. 1964, Notes to When We Dead Awake, p. 299 (Penguin) Part of Rubek's artistic death is what he considers hack work doing \\"portrait-busts\\". This is another reference to Ibsen's own life, as he considered many of his later plays to be 'portrait plays' (The Master Builder, Little Eyolf, John Gabriel Borkman), which simply recycled his central message.Watts, Peter. 1964, Notes to When We Dead Awake, p. 298-9 (Penguin) Furthermore, Rubek characterizes his early work with Irena as a form of 'poetry', with the implication being that his later, less significant works are prose. Ibsen felt similarly, wishing that he had continued writing poetry after Peer Gynt.Watts, Peter. 1964, Notes to When We Dead Awake, p. 300 (Penguin) Irena's outfit is also a reference to one worn by Laura Kieler in her last visit to Ibsen. The author was the basis for A Doll's House, and she resented Ibsen using her life in his work, just as Irena feels violated by Rubek.Watts, Peter. 1964, Notes to When We Dead Awake, p. 299 (Penguin) The final scene was originally much different and more restrained. Ulfheim has a bottle of champagne atop the mountain, and all four characters drink a toast to freedom. When Ulfheim and Maia descend, Irena comments that \\"She has awakened from life's deep, heavy sleep\\". After disappearing into the mists on their way to the mountain top, there is no avalanche. The nun simply appears, looking for Irena, and the sun is seen gleaming high above the clouds.Watts, Peter. 1964, Notes to When We Dead Awake, p. 301 (Penguin) ReferencesFurther reading *Hurt, James.

Biography Mola was born at Coldrerio (now in Ticino, Switzerland).Ecstasy in the Wilderness: Pier Francesco Mola's \\"The Vision of Saint Bruno\\" , Dawson W. Carr, The J. Paul Getty Museum Journal, Vol. 19 (1991), 99. At the age of four, he moved to Rome with his father Giovanni Battista Mola, a painter. With the exception of the years 1633‚Äì40 and 1641‚Äì47, during which he resided in Venice and Bologna, respectively, he lived for the rest of his life in Rome. His early training was with the late mannerist painter Cavalier d'Arpino, and he worked under the classicizing Francesco Albani. His masterpiece as a fresco painter is widely considered to be the fresco in the gallery of Alexander VII in the Quirinal Palace Gallery, entitled Joseph making himself known to his Brethren (1657).Qurinale Gallery.. However, Mola is considered to have been better as a painter of small pictures, especially landscapes.Wittkower, Rudolph. Art and Architecture in Italy, 1600‚Äì1750. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1999. II.136. He made six versions of The Flight into Egypt, the earliest and best of which is the first one, The Rest on the Flight into Egypt. He was elected Principe of the Accademia di San Luca, the Roman artists' professional association, in 1662, but his last years were neither profitable nor prolific. Among his pupils were Jean-Baptiste Forest, Antonio Gherardi, and Giuseppe Bonati. With his looser style and handling, more naturalistic palette, and interest in exploring landscape elements, Mola differs from the prevailing, highly-theoretical classicism of such leading 17th-century Roman painters as Andrea Sacchi.

The island is in Aberffraw Community, about west of Aberffraw village. The island can be reached on foot at low tide. It is notable for the 13th-century Church in Wales church of St Cwyfan, called in (\\"the little church in the sea\\") or simply Cwyfan. Church St Cwyfan's church was in existence by 1254 and was enlarged in the 14th and 15th centuries. The building later fell into disrepair, and in the 19th century parts of the church were demolished. By 1891 the surviving part was roofless, so an appeal was launched which paid for the building of a new roof. In about the 1970s all the windows were restored, but now the building is deteriorating again and a new restoration appeal has been launched. Sea erosion A Jacobean map dated 1636 shows the church standing on the mainland of Anglesey. Written evidence submitted in 1770 in the case against Dr Thomas Bowles (see below) says that the road from Aberffraw to Llangwyfan was bad, but makes no mention of the tide restricting access to the church. Therefore, it seems to be after that date that sea erosion of the boulder clay cliffs turned Cribinau into an island. By the 19th century, erosion was causing graves in the churchyard to fall into the sea, so a seawall was built around the island to protect the remaining graves and the church.

Zimmerman (eds.). 1989. South Dakota Leaders: From Pierre Chouteau, Jr., to Oscar Howe. Vermillion: University of South Dakota Press, p. 439.) was a state historian of South Dakota. He is known for conceiving of the idea for the Mount Rushmore National Memorial in the Black Hills, which he believed would stimulate tourism to the area. Doane Robinson had introduced a bill to the South Dakota State legislature asking for permission and funds to scout a location for a massive carvings project; the sculpture was to include the Sioux Nation chief as well as local famous South Dakotans. While denied funding, he was granted permission to look for an area. He had initially suggested a well known area of the Black Hills, Needles, named after large distinct eroded granite pillars. Early on, Robinson originally wrote Lorado Taft about the project idea and potential Needles location. At the time Taft was quite ill and unable to attend any expedition to survey the area. Not giving up, in September of 1924 Robinson met with Gutzon Borglum, writing Borglum about the potential project. During Robinson and Borglum's first expedition to the Needles, Borglum declared his dislike of Robinson's proposed location because of the soft rock and controversy attached to it by the Lakota Nation. In August of 1925, Borglum had made a second trip to South Dakota and declared Mount Rushmore would be the site of this grand Sculpture project. Appeasing the protests from the Sioux Nation and local media. Doane Robinson, then 69 years old, joined an expedition party in scaling the mountain. He became the de facto project manager of the Rushmore Memorial from that point on. Robinson gained support from then US Senator, Peter Norbeck from South Dakota, and in 1929, during the last months of his presidency, President Calvin Coolidge approved the project after Congress authorized funding. The project was completed in 1941. Doane Robinson had lived to 1946, seeing his idea fully completed. Early life Jonah LeRoy Robinson was born in Sparta, Wisconsin. His sister could not pronounce his name and called him \\"Doane\\" when young, and he continued to use this name throughout his life. Robinson first became a farmer in Minnesota. He soon abandoned that work to become a lawyer, reading law with an established firm to prepare for the bar. He moved to South Dakota, where he set up his practice in Pierre, the state capital. Later, he took interest in history, and began to publish work about South Dakota history. He was eventually appointed as South Dakota's state historian. In that position, Robinson conceived the idea of the Mt. Rushmore monument to attract tourism to the Black Hills area. Mount Rushmore Robinson conceived the idea for Mount Rushmore After reading about Stone Mountain near Atlanta, Georgia, Robinson was inspired to create a sculpture project at the Needles, to have several granite pillars carved as likenesses of famous people. He hoped that such a sculpture would attract greater tourism to South Dakota. After failing to contact sculptor Lorado Taft, who was ill, Robinson gained the support of Gutzon Borglum. His concept was also backed by US Senator Peter Norbeck from South Dakota. Robinson began efforts to raise funds for the project and to receive permission to carve the Needles. The funds were denied, and many groups disliked the idea, including the Lakota people (Sioux), who considered the Black Hills to be sacred ground. Environmentalist Cora Johnson of the Hot Springs Star newspaper believed that such a carving would destroy the natural landscape. On Borglum‚Äôs second meeting with Robinson, the sculptor recommended changing the location for the sculpture project from the Needles to Mount Rushmore. Borglum also decided that the sculptures should have a larger national focus, and he selected four presidents representing different elements and eras of United States history. In 1929, president Calvin Coolidge finally signed a bill passed by Congress, which created a commission to oversee the sculpting. Robinson was not appointed as a member of the commission, which greatly disappointed him. Following his retirement as state historian, Robinson returned to farming. He lived to see the completion of the Mount Rushmore project in 1941, to the extent allowed by funding. He died on November 27, 1946 at age 90, in Pierre, South Dakota. Legacy In addition to the Mount Rushmore project, Robinson was recognized by the naming of Doane Mountain in his honor. Located south of Mount Rushmore, it was the site for the headquarters of the project.

The ceremony was directed by Ric Birch. The chairman for the XII Commonwealth Games was Sir Edward Williams, KBE, KCMG. Sir Edward was later decorated Australian of the Year for 1982. Description Matilda the mascot for the 1982 Commonwealth Games during the opening ceremony winking to the crowd The opening ceremony was held during the afternoon of a fine and sunny, but extremely windy and somewhat cool, afternoon. The starting of the Opening Ceremony was signaled with a kookaburra's call, followed by the traditional cry of \\"cooeee\\". Already on the field were two Commonwealth Games logos. After the announcement welcoming the audience to the opening ceremony, thousands of high school students dressed in red, white, or blue came running onto the field. Some of the children carried fabric placards while others picked up coloured boards once they were on the field. While the Opening Prelude / Commonwealth Games Song was performed by the Queensland Symphony Orchestra and the Sydney Philharmonia Choir), the children formed the Australian flag. As this was breaking up, marching girls, wearing white and blue, green and black, or red and white, came along the athletics track from the right. From the left, came Surf Lifesavers bearing a variety of flags. The following music was played: * March Past (Queensland Symphony Orchestra and the Sydney Philharmonia Choir) * Medley: instrumental music: :::(\\"The Drover's Dream\\" / \\"Brown Slouch Hat\\" / ::: \\"Click Go the Shears\\" / \\"The Overlanders\\") * \\"I Still Call Australia Home\\" * \\"Tie Me Kangaroo Down Sport\\" / \\"Along the Road to Gundagai\\" The high school students then formed red and blue circles, outlined in white, surrounded by a blue square. Again, on either side they formed the Commonwealth Games logo. The circles broke up to form a stylised map of Australia again surrounded by a blue square representing the sea. The map was the source of controversy as it omitted Tasmania. The centre of the map was now filled with young people in the native costumes of the many different nationalities which make up Australia. While \\"I Still Call Australia Home\\" was playing, these young people stood in rows, holding hands, and swaying to represent waves on the sea. The dances within the map included an ethnic folk dance medley of some of the countries from which some Australian people came. The dances were; * \\"Bomba\\" (Butterfly Dance), which was sung and performed by Arnhem Land Aborigines * \\"Seri-Seri\\" (Sun Dance), which was sung and performed by The Torres Strait Islands Dance Group of Murray and Darnley * \\"Ethnic Dance Medley\\" (an original medley of 15 dances) -- a Yugoslav hora, Irish soft shoe reel, Italian tarantella, Polynesian tamure, German schuhplatter, Spanish sevillanas, Filipino tinikling, Scottish country dance and Highland reel o'tulloch, Latin American los andinos, Sri Lankan harvest dance, Polish polka, Greek pergousiko, Hungarian czardas and a Ukrainian gopak As the dancers ran out of the stadium Matilda the games' mascot entered and performed a lap of honour. Matilda was represented in both the Opening and Closing Ceremonies of the Games by a \\"winking\\" Matilda -- a gigantic-size 13-metre (42 feet 8 inches) high mechanical kangaroo built around a forklift truck. As she travelled around the athletics track, she winked several times at the crowd, including a personal wink at the Duke of Edinburgh who was representing the Crown at the Ceremony. Once her lap was completed, her pouch opened and children representing joey kangaroos ran out towards small trampolines which had been set up in the centre of the stadium. As they bounced, Rolf Harris, standing on the tray of a small truck wearing a sky blue leisure suit and with his trademark wobble board, performed a special version of \\"Tie Me Kangaroo Down\\" which included the added lyrics: ::Let me welcome you to the Games, friends, ::Welcome you to the Games ::Look, I don't know all of your names, friends, ::But let me welcome you to the Games, As the trampolines were moved out, Rolf Harris sang a slow-paced version of the song \\"Waltzing Matilda\\". Many of the crowd joined in during the chorus of the song. The children, meanwhile, had formed the Commonwealth Games logo in the centre of a blue circle. When the song finished, 50,000 red, white, and blue balloons were released. This was touted by Geraldine Doogue who was co-presenting the ABC's coverage of the event, as \\"the largest balloon display ever\\". Geraldine added that it had taken \\"120 people ... five hours and 100 cylinders of helium and balloon gas to blow 'em up.\\" The school children then left the field. At approximately 3:35 pm, the Parade of Nations, which was estimated to run for 45 minutes, commenced, led by the athletes from Canada, which had hosted the previous games, with Australia's athletes coming in last. When the team from the Falkland Islands entered the stadium, they received an enormous cheer from the crowd because of the recently fought Falklands War. The Commonwealth Games Ceremonial flag was brought into the stadium and raised. The Athlete's Oath was taken by Tracey Wickham. The final runner in the Queen's Baton Relay was Raelene Boyle, who handed the baton to the Duke of Edinburgh. The Duke read out the message which Elizabeth II had sent in the Queen's Baton, officially opening the Games (the Duke opened the Games because the Queen was unable to arrive in Australia in time to attend the Opening Ceremony). Because the Opening Ceremony was held during daylight hours, there were no fireworks to accompany the ceremony. However, both doves and colourful balloons of red, white and blue, were released. There were also supposed to be parachute jumpers, with parachutes of red, white and blue, taking part during the display at the opening ceremony, with the parachute jumpers landing within the stylised map of Australia within the stadium, but it was too risky, because of the extreme wind conditions, to have this segment as the strong wind might have blown the parachute jumpers off course if they had jumped (the parachute jumpers appeared during the Closing Ceremony, instead). The Queen, who arrived in Brisbane during the Games, presented some of the medals, including presenting the gold medal to Australian swimmer Tracey Wickham. The Queen also closed the Games. Matilda legacy following the Games The massive Matilda prop from the opening ceremony was relocated to Wet'n'Wild Water World, a water park in the Gold Coast hinterland. Matilda was dismantled for maintenance in 2007 but never reassembled. It was relocated and assembled at a Matilda fuel station at Kybong in 2011.

The One-Twenty model designation was replaced by the Packard 200. The One-Twenty signified the first time that Packard had entered into the highly competitive mid-priced eight-cylinder car market. Packard enthusiasts view the production of the One- Twenty and the Six/One-Ten models as the start of Packard's losing its hold on the market as the premier American luxury automotive brand. It was a marketing strategy shared with GM's LaSalle, the Chrysler Airstream, and the Lincoln- Zephyr. It was introduced after Rolls-Royce brought to market the Rolls-Royce 20, which was manufactured between 1922 and 1929, and replaced by the Rolls- Royce 20/25 which was built between 1929‚Äì1936. The introduction of the One- Twenty (and later the Six/One-Ten models) was a necessary move to keep Packard in business during the final years of the Great Depression, expanding on an earlier approach with the Packard Light Eight. Branding the One-Twenty a Packard afforded buyers the cachet of owning a Packard, a name long regarded as one of America's most prestigious cars. Other reasons the company decided to forgo the development of a companion brand name to sell the less expensive models may have been linked to its single production line capability at its Grand Boulevard manufacturing plant or to the expense of launching a new brand of automobile. It also ushered in a novel advertising approach, commissioning an advertising \\"jingle\\" called \\"When Heaven Was at the Corner of Sycamore and Main\\".  The Safe-T-Flex suspension  This car introduced the independent front suspension to the Packard line. Its so-called \\"Safe-T-Flex\\" suspension was an unequal upper and lower A-arm type with the largest possible lower A-arm composed of two different arms bolted together at a ninety-degree angle. The support arm was a heavy steel forging reaching a few degrees forward of lateral from the front wheel support to as close to the centerline of the car as is practicable. An integral pad socketed the helical spring, whose upper end reached a high frame cross-beam. A tubular, hence lighter, steel torque arm was bolted to the support arm somewhat inboard of the wheel to permit a sufficient steering arc. It reached the frame nearly at the dashboard with a spherical rubber bearing. The upper A-arm was conventionally welded and oriented parallel to the lower one. Between it and the frame was an old- fashioned horizontal shock absorber whose two cylinders were side by side. The support arm carried all the load; the torque arm carried the accelerating and decelerating torque; the upper A-arm controlled the camber. Advantages claimed for the system included superior maintenance of wheel alignment from the wide spread of the lower A-arm, a permanent fixing of the caster angle, and an increased percentage of the braking force transmitted to the frame through the torque arm.  First generation (1935‚Äì1937)  In its introduction year, the Packard One-Twenty was available in a broad array of body styles including two and four-door sedans, convertible and Club Coupe. The One-Twenty, weighing in at ,Old Car Advertising Retrieved 12 September 2013 was powered by an all-new Packard aluminum-head L-head inline eight producing at 3850 rpm. Prices ranged from $980 for the three-passenger business coupe to $1,095 for the Touring Sedan. Introduced in January 1935, the car was an immediate success with consumers, with Packard producing 24,995 One-Twentys, compared to 7,000 of all other type Packards for the year. For 1936 Packard increased the displacement on the L-head eight, increasing its output to , making the car capable of reaching a top speed of .

When it opened, the mall was originally called Rotterdam Square and owned by Wilmorite Properties (who also owned Wilton Mall in Wilton) until 2005, when Wilmorite was acquired by The Macerich Company, who then took over ownership and management of most of their properties. The mall has an area of on one level with 58 stores, a 450-seat food court as well as restaurants, an aquarium, entertainment center, and a seven-screen Sony-Loews Cineplex, now operated by Zurich Cinemas (independent company). The mall was purchased by Kohan Retail Investment Group in January 2014, and was later sold to Via Properties in June 2015. In 2016, Via Properties renamed the mall to Via Port Rotterdam. History The mall is situated on a site once owned by the Vedder Family. Harman Albertse Vedder of Schenectady bought the land in 1672 and built a home on it. In 1832 Harmens' great-grandson Johannes sold it to Colonel Daniel David Schermerhorn Campbell, who constructed a 26-bedroom mansion on the site. At the time of construction, the area around the mall was a nature preserve, and environmental groups were concerned that the building of the mall would endanger wildlife and pollute the wet lands on the opposite side of Route 337, now the Great Flats Nature Trail and Preserve. Mike Kohan bought the mall from Macerich in January 2014 for $8.5 million. In January 2015, Macy's, originally Hess's and later Filene's, announced that its store would be closing as part of a plan to close 14 stores nationwide. The space is now the location of a NYS taxation call center. On February 12, 2015, local power company National Grid disconnected electric service due to a rumored $300,000.00 unpaid utility bill. The service was turned back on the next day. In June 2015, the mall was sold for $9.25 million to Via Properties, which renamed the mall to Viaport Rotterdam in 2016. They plan to invest $10 million into mall improvements, including exterior upgrades, a aquarium, and a nearly entertainment center with a bowling alley, sports bar, restaurant, and arcade. On April 21, 2016, it was announced that Sears would also be closing as part of a plan to close 78 stores nationwide. The store closed in July 2016. On October 15, 2018, Sears Holdings announced that Kmart would be closing as well in December 2018 as part of a plan to close 142 stores nationwide which left the mall with no anchor stores left. As of January 2019, only several in-line tenants are remaining in Via Port Rotterdam as well as a call center for the New York State Department of Taxation and Finance. Carousel The carousel in the food court From 1988 until January 2007, Rotterdam Square featured a full-size Italian carousel in the food court. The management sold the carousel in late 2006 and in January 2007 it was dismantled and removed. Graveyard The mall features a graveyard within the complex. Located in a corner between the food court entrance and the front side entrance, the graveyard is the family cemetery of the Vedder Family dating back to around 1715. Theater A basic mall-based theater that was previously part of the Sony-Loews Cineplex (and then AMC) circuit. The theater is a six-screen cinema now operated by an independently owned theater company named Zurich Cinemas. The theater added a 7th screen and has been refitted with stadium seating, and digital projectors along with 3D capabilities.

Irish Breakfast tea leaves are sought from India, Rwanda,and Kenya. It is said that its the African leaves that make a good refreshing breakfast tea.  Blend  The Irish Breakfast tea Blend has no standard formula for its manufacture. However, most blends share common traits that collectively define \\"Irish Breakfast\\" as opposed to other British tea blends. The base of the Irish tea blend is a strong black Assam tea from India that is well known for its dark colour, strong flavour and malty aroma. The Assam is usually blended with one other, softer tea to bring out different flavours and to support the Assam. These additional teas are usually sourced from Kenya. with a popular choice being Kenyan Broken Pekoe. The proportion of Assam tea to the ancillary leaves is what gives Irish Breakfast tea its defining flavour. The strength of the tea blend not only comes from the type of tea leaves used in the preparation, but also from the processing of the leaves before packaging. Irish Breakfast tea tends to be made with leaves that have been broken, meaning leaves that have been dried and then lightly crushed before packaging. This process allows the tea to steep more rapidly and release more flavour per leaf than an unbroken leaf. Packaging  The majority of tea is sold as boxes of tea bags, but all of the major brands are available in loose leaf form, allowing the consumer to inspect the proportion of hand-picked buds and whole tea leaves as against broken fannings of indeterminate origin. When brewed, the tea varies in colour from very dark red to brown.

He gave up his Fifth Congressional District seat to challenge Democratic incumbent Lloyd M. Bentsen, Jr., in the 1976 election. Steelman was born in Little Rock, Arkansas. He attended Baylor University in Waco, Texas, on a baseball scholarship. He graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in political science in 1964 and was president of his class. He led the Republican Party of Dallas County from 1966-1969, and received an MLA degree in 1971 from Southern Methodist University in Dallas. Political Career=U.S. Representative In 1972, Steelman was a visiting fellow at the John F. Kennedy Institute of Politics at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. From 1969 to 1972, he was a member of President Richard M. Nixon's Advisory Council on Minority Business Enterprise, when he was elected to Congress. Steelman unseated incumbent Democratic Congressman Earle Cabell, a former mayor of Dallas who had served since 1965 and had previously unseated the Republican incumbent Bruce Alger in 1964. Steelman polled 74,932 votes (55.7 percent) to Cabell's 59,601 (44.3 percent). His campaign manager was the later Texas Republican state chairman Fred Meyer, a Dallas businessman originally from suburban Chicago. At the date of his election in 1972, Steelman was the youngest Republican member of the House at age 29. In 1974, a heavily Democratic year both in Texas and nationally, Steelman barely survived the challenge of Mike McCool. In a low- turnout election, Steelman polled 28,446 (52.1 percent) to McCool's 26,190 (47.9 percent). Time magazine listed Steelman among its \\"200 Emerging Young National Leaders\\" in 1974, in a special edition devoted to leadership in America. The defunct Dallas Times Herald, in endorsing his re-election bid that year called him one of \\"the best ever sent to Congress for Texas.\\" Texas Monthly magazine named him one of the top five most effective members of the then 26-person Texas congressional delegation during only his second term. New Times, a Washington-based national magazine, named him one of the \\"Ten Best Congressmen\\" of the 435-member body in 1973. Steelman served on two committees: Government Operations and Interior and Insular Affairs. He focused on environmental issues, namely the fight against the Trinity River Canal and for Big Thicket National Preserve. Additional priorities included energy, transportation, veterans, wage and price controls, and Social Security.Alan W. Steelman Papers #90, Baylor Collections of Political Materials, W. R. Poage Legislative Library, Baylor University. 1976 U.S. Senate campaign Steelman did not seek a third term in the U.S. House in 1976 but instead opposed the reelection of Senator Lloyd Bentsen. Senate returns gave Bentsen 2,199,956 (56.8 percent) to Steelman's 1,631,370 (42.2 percent). Bentsen not only defeated the 34-year-old Steelman by a comfortable margin, but he helped to bring Democratic presidential nominee Jimmy Carter to victory in Texas. Carter became thus far the last Democrat to win the electoral votes of Texas, which prior to the 1970s was one of the most loyal of Democratic states. Steelman's U.S. House seat also reverted to the Democrats in 1976, with the winner being future Texas Attorney General James Albon \\"Jim\\" Mattox, who defeated the Republican Nancy Judy. Personal Life Steelman never again sought office after the loss to Bentsen. In 1977, he began work with Alexander Proudfoot, a listed company on the London Stock Exchange, and is Vice Chairman. He has served as Group President for the Asia-Pacific region of Proudfoot and lived in Singapore for eight years to build the start-up there. In 1978, he was elected to the Common Cause National Governing Board. He was appointed by Governor George W. Bush to the Texas Growth Fund Board, a $600 million venture capital fund run by the State of Texas. He has also served as Vice Chairman of the Board at the John Tower Center for Political Studies at SMU and the Trinity Foundation, Chairman of the Dallas Council on World Affairs, and former President of Maxager Technology, Inc. (Profit Velocity Solutions). In August 2020, Steelman endorsed Joe Biden for president. He is a member of the steering committee of Republicans and Independents for Biden. Steelman resides in Dallas and is married to Susan Seligman Fuller Steelman. He is the father of five children and the stepfather of two. He is an avid golfer and reads history and biography.

The One-Ten designation replaced the Packard Six. Packard reintroduced a line of six-cylinder cars in 1937 after a ten-year absence as a response to the economic depression and ongoing recovery cycle in the United States. As an independent automaker, Packard could not look to other internal divisions to support its luxury models, so the inclusion of the Six, and the later 110, was necessary to aid in supporting the firm's bottom line until better times returned. Critics of the Packard Six and One-Ten have long maintained they hurt Packard's reputation of being America's premier luxury marque. Still, the reintroduction of the Six could not have come at a better time for the automaker, just prior to the nation's 1938 economic depression. By offering the less expensive model, the company was able to attract buyers who would otherwise be unable to purchase more expensive cars. Built on a shorter wheelbase than the senior Packards, the One-Ten was introduced in August 1939. The One-Ten was available in a broad range of Body styles, including both two and four-door sedans, station wagon and convertible. Total output for the 1940 model year was 62,300 units. Following its successful first year, the 1941 One-Ten model range was expanded, and a second trim level, the Deluxe was added. Packard also added a taxi line within the One-Ten model range. Options for the One-Ten included heater, radio, spotlight, and despite its low-line status, air conditioning. For 1942, Packard made a decision to retain numerical designated models within its senior line and the One-Ten reverted to being called Packard Six.

Biography  Feldberg was born in Hamburg to a wealthy middle class Jewish family. He studied medicine at Heidelberg, Munich and Berlin, graduating in 1925. In the same year he moved with his new wife to England and studied first under John Newport Langley at Cambridge and then Henry Dale at Hampstead. In 1927 he returned to the Physiological Institute in Berlin but he was dismissed in 1933 during the Nazi purge of Jewish scientists. With the aid of Archibald Hill's Academic Assistance Council, Feldberg was relocated to Britain's National Institute for Medical Research in 1934‚Äì36. Here, he worked with Henry Hallett Dale, providing a significant impetus for Dale's Nobel Prize winning research into chemical neurotransmission. Feldberg was subsequently offered a place in Australia, at the behest of Charles Kellaway, director of the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research. He spent two years (1936‚Äì38) in Melbourne, joining Kellaway's snake venom research programme. This work developed into a study of tissue responses to direct and indirect insult, focusing particularly on the liberation of histamine and other endogenous mediators. A finding of lasting pharmacological interest from these studies was the identification and partial isolation of the slow-reacting substance of anaphylaxis. Although Feldberg had earned a fellowship supported by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, in 1938 he was offered a readership in physiology at Cambridge University. He returned to England to take up this post, remaining there throughout World War II until 1949. Feldberg's subsequent appointments include: Head of Physiology and Pharmacology Division, National Institute for Medical Research, London, 1949‚Äì65 (Honorary Head of Division, 1965‚Äì66); Head, Laboratory of Neuropharmacology, National Institute for Medical Research, 1966‚Äì74. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1947 and made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1963. Wilhelm Feldberg assisted many research workers who came to England as a part of their Commonwealth Medical Fellowship and Wellcome Research Fellowship. Under this Fellowships, Professor PN Saxena and Prof. KP Gupta of the Department of Pharmacology, Jawaharlal Nehru Medical College, Aligarh Muslim University, during the 1970s got many papers published together with Wilhelm Feldberg while their vocation at National Institute for Medical Research, Mill Hill. Controversy Feldberg's career was ended in 1990 when two animal rights activists gained access to his lab on the pretence of writing a biography and filming an educational video. Their claims were printed in The Independent. An investigation by the Medical Research Council found that some breaches of regulations had occurred. While these may not have been Feldberg's fault, he was deemed responsible and his Home Office Project Licence was revoked. One of the animal rights activists involved, Melody MacDonald, detailed her claims in her 1994 book Caught in the Act: The Feldberg Investigation (). Feldberg became infamous, as MacDonald puts it, for his severe cruelty during animal research experiments. In the year of 1990, an investigation by the animal rights group Advocates for Animals revealed experiments in which rabbits were regularly burned and operated on without adequate anaesthesia, or even at all, and sometimes even without being covered by a licence. These revelations came when Feldberg was 89 years old. These experiments took place at the National Institute for Medical Research laboratories, Mill Hill, in London, which relate to the functions and decisions of the Home Department. These experiments took place between 1989 and 1990. Along with Feldberg's technician Mr. Stean, the Medical Research Council Inquiry found that he caused both unnecessary suffering to animals. MacDonald reports that Feldberg experimented by pouring various chemicals into the brains of cats while alive and fully conscious. However, as MacDonald and the inquiry found, it was his experiments on rabbits that brought about his downfall and subsequent sacking in 1990. This was just four months after he was awarded the Wellcome Gold Medal in Pharmacology by the British Pharmacological Society.Stop 2. Animalliberationfront.com.

Retrieved on 23 June 2014. On 26 May 1994 the book Caught in the Act: The Feldberg Investigation by Melody MacDonald exposed his alleged malpractice to the world. Dr. Vernon Coleman writes that \\"Just before Christmas 1989 two undercover operators finally persuaded Feldberg to allow them to take video and still photographs of him at work. Flattered by the attention he was getting (one of the investigators, Melody MacDonald, was a former fashion model (she published her investigation in the above mentioned book)) Feldberg agreed.\\" Vernon goes on to state that \\"As a result of film which the investigators took just after Feldberg's eightyninth birthday, the Medical Research Council held an inquiry. The published report of the inquiry shows that according to the Medical Research Council Feldberg failed to ensure that four of the rabbits he used were sufficiently anaesthetized during experiments performed at the National Institute for Medical Research, in Mill Hill, London. The Medical Research Council's report describes the benefit likely to accrue from Feldberg's work as 'negligible' and admitted that 'applied to the methodology the word \\"crude\\" is not inappropriate'. They conclude that 'a number of animals perished for no discernible beneficial reason' and criticized the British Home Secretary for the fact that he 'failed to weigh adequately the likely benefit of the research against the likely adverse effects on the animals involved'. In some ways Feldberg was probably unlucky. I very much doubt if he was the only scientist in Britain who was failing to anaesthetize laboratory animals properly. He certainly wasn't the only scientist doing research work of negligible value. It's quite clear from this case history that it is a lie to say that animals which are experimented on are invariably and adequately anaesthetized. The truth is that most animals have no anaesthetic at all; and even when an anaesthetic is used the chances are high that it will be inadequate.\\" ReferencesExternal links * Autobiography ‚Äì Fifty Years On: Looking back on some Developments in Neurohumoral Physiology, Feldberg, Wilhelm; Liverpool University Press, 1982, pl * 'The Life of Professor Feldberg' (also known as \\"Why Animal Experiments Must Stop\\") by Dr. Vernon Coleman. * Professor Feldberg by the Animal Cruelty Investigation Group Category:20th-century British biologists Category:British physiologists Category:Fellows of the Royal Society Category:Jewish scientists Category:1900 births Category:1993 deaths Category:Animal rights Category:Jewish emigrants from Nazi Germany to the United Kingdom Category:Royal Medal winners Category:WEHI alumni Category:Commanders Crosses of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany Category:National Institute for Medical Research faculty ","title":"Wilhelm Feldberg"},{"id":"4444265","text":"Barrett Willoughby (May 18, 1901 ‚Äì July 29, 1959),Library of Congress Card Catalogue Florance Barrett, was a best-selling novelist who wrote works of romantic fiction and nonfiction from the 1920s through the 1940s.

The district was based at the time around Irving in Dallas County. Background Collins was born in Hallsville in Harrison County in East Texas. His father, Carr Collins Sr., had founded the Fidelity Union Life Insurance Company; his sister was Ruth Sharp Altshuler. He graduated from Woodrow Wilson High School in Dallas. In 1989, Collins was inducted into the Woodrow Wilson High School Hall of Fame the same year it was created in celebration of the sixtieth anniversary of the institution. Collins graduated thereafter from Southern Methodist University in University Park (a part of the Park Cities enclave that is surrounded by Dallas) and from Harvard Business School in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Collins then entered the United States Army, having served as a lieutenant in the Third Army of General George S. Patton, Jr., during the Battle of the Bulge in World War II. In 1966, Collins ran for the U.S. House in the 3rd District, a newly created district in north Dallas. He lost to incumbent Democrat Joe R. Pool in a close race, taking 46 percent of the vote to Pool's 53 percent. Pool died in July 1968, and Collins won the ensuing special election, defeating Pool's widow, Elizabeth, with over 60 percent of the vote. His victory was part of a strong trend toward the GOP in north Dallas; this district has been in Republican hands without interruption since then. He won a full term in the general election that fall, he received 81,696 votes (59.4 percent) to 55,939 (40.6 percent) for Democrat Robert H. Hughes. He would never face another contest nearly that close, never dropping below 64 percent of the vote and even running unopposed in 1978. Barbara Staff, later one of the three co-chairmen in Texas for the Ronald W. Reagan challenge to U.S. President Gerald R. Ford, Jr. in the 1976 Republican presidential primary, worked in Collins' campaigns and in the congressional office for a time. As the president of the Council of Republican Women's Clubs of Dallas County, she had launched a successful membership program known as \\"I Believe\\" and was known in particular for her conservative political views and organizational skills.Billy Hathorn, \\"Mayor Ernest Angelo, Jr., of Midland and the 96-0 Reagan Sweep of Texas, May 1, 1976,\\" West Texas Historical Association Yearbook Vol. 86 (2010), p. 81 Opposing Lloyd Bentsen, 1982 At sixty-six in 1982, Collins relinquished his House seat to challenge the entrenched Texas Democratic U.S. Senator Lloyd Bentsen, of Houston, at sixty- one a political icon in Texas. The conservative Collins won the Republican primary for senator by defeating an even more conservative rival, Walter Mengden, also of Houston. As a state senator, Mengden had been an advocate of instituting the initiative and referendum in Texas, two reforms never implemented. Collins polled 152,469 (58 percent) in the primary to Mengden's 91,780 (34.9 percent). A third contender received 7.1 percent of the vote. Collins subsequently lost the general election by a large margin. Bentsen polled 1,818,223 (58.6 percent) to Collins' 1,256,759 (40.5 percent). The 1982 elections ended the political careers of both Mengden and Collins, but they represented a triumph for Lloyd Bentsen, who led his party to victory in all statewide races that year, including judgeships, the last year thus far that Democrats have swept all statewide races, including judgeships, in Texas. Personal life Collins' former son-in-law, Richard W. Fisher of Dallas, who married Collins's daughter, Nancy Miles Collins, worked for the Independent presidential campaign of H. Ross Perot in 1992. In 1994, five years after Collins' death, Fisher ran unsuccessfully as the Democratic nominee against freshman Republican Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison, who emerged as Bentsen's long-time Senate successor. Collins' grandson, Miles Fisher, is an actor, musician, and entrepreneur. Collins was succeeded in Congress by fellow Republican Steve Bartlett, who had defeated future U.S. Senator Hutchison in the GOP primary in 1982. Bartlett left Congress in 1991, when he was elected mayor of Dallas. Bartlett was succeeded by Sam Johnson, a popular former POW from the Vietnam War.

Feed  Marbling can also be influenced by time on feed, and type of feed, and relative feed value of feedstuffs. The longer cattle are fed a high-energy diet, the better chance they will grade higher on quality scores, but will have much lower yield grades (percentage of carcass lean to fat ratio). Feeding a high amount of cereal grains, such as corn or barley, will change the color of the carcass fat from a yellowish to a white and increase the chance of obtaining a higher quality grade, according to the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Veal has little to no marbling since young cattle develop subcutaneous fat first, kidney, pelvic and heart (KPH) fat second, intermuscular (between the muscle, or \\"seam fat\\") third and then intramuscular fat - \\"marbling\\" - last.  Important terms defined  Beef quality grades - A quality grade is a composite evaluation of factors that affect palatability of meat (tenderness, juiciness, and flavor). These factors include carcass maturity, firmness, texture, and color of lean, and the amount and distribution of marbling within the lean. Beef carcass quality grading is based on (1) degree of marbling and (2) degree of maturity. Marbling - (intramuscular fat) is the intermingling or dispersion of fat within the lean. Graders evaluate the amount and distribution of marbling in the ribeye muscle at the cut surface after the carcass has been ribbed between the 12th and 13th ribs. Degree of marbling is the primary determination of quality grade. Maturity refers to the physiological age of the animal rather than the chronological age. Because the chronological age is virtually never known, physiological maturity is used; and the indicators are bone characteristics, ossification of cartilage, color and texture of ribeye muscle. Cartilage becomes bone, lean color darkens and texture becomes coarser with increasing age. Cartilage and bone maturity receives more emphasis because lean color and texture can be affected by other postmortem factors. Beef yield grades - In beef, yield grades estimate the amount of boneless, closely trimmed retail cuts from the high-value parts of the carcass‚Äìthe round, loin, rib, and chuck. However, they also show differences in the total yield of retail cuts. We expect a YG 1 carcass to have the highest percentage of boneless, closely trimmed retail cuts, or higher cutability, while a YG 5 carcass would have the lowest percentage of boneless, closely trimmed retail cuts, or the lowest cutability. The USDA Yield Grades are rated numerically and are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5. Yield Grade 1 denotes the highest yielding carcass and Yield Grade 5, the lowest.  United States grading system  The USDA's grading system, which has been designed to reward marbling, has eight different grades; Prime, Choice, Select, Standard, Commercial, Utility, Cutter and Canner. Prime has the highest marbling content when compared to other grades, and is capable of fetching a premium at restaurants and supermarkets. Choice is the grade most commonly sold in retail outlets, and Select is sold as a cheaper, but still nutritious, option in many stores. Prime, Choice, Select and Standard are commonly used in the younger cattle (under 42 months of age), and Commercial, Utility, Canner and Cutter are used in older cattle carcasses which are not marketed as wholesale beef \\"block\\" meat, but as material used in ground products and cheaper steaks for family restaurants.

(formerly known as Murton Colliery Welfare) were a football team based in Murton near Durham in County Durham, England who last played Wearside League. They were affiliated to the Durham Football Association and were Full Members of The Football Association. They play at Welfare Park, which has one stand (one covered standing area) with a capacity of about 150. After repeated vandalism over the years demolition of the main stand began in June 2007. The floodlights were removed in early 2008 after being declared unfit for purpose. A second covered stand behind the top goal was removed prior to the beginning of the 2009‚Äì10 season. The average attendance from season to season stands at around 25‚Äì30 but the record attendance is 3,500 spectators for a Durham County Cup game against Spennymoor United in 1951. Club history Murton AFC was founded in 1891 as Murton Colliery Welfare. They moved to their current ground of Recreation Park from the Fatten Pasture ground in 1928. The club's only success while playing at Fatten Pasture was winning the 1921-22 Monkwearmouth Cup. In the first season at Recreation Park Murton won the Wearside League and the Monkwearmouth Cup. They again won the Monkwearmouth Cup in the 1934-35 and 1935-36 seasons. In the 1936-37 season Murton took the Wearside League championship again. After the war Murton joined the newly reformed North Eastern League but found it hard going with their best position being 13th out of 20 clubs. Murton rejoined the Wearside League for the 1951-52 season. Murton became Wearside League champions for a 3rd time in the 1959-60 season having in the previous season won the Wearside League Cup. In the same season that Murton became League champions they also won for the first time in their history the Ship Owners Cup. The 1960s saw Murton win the Monkwearmouth Cup in the 1963-64 season and the Ship Owners Cup in the 1969-70 season. In the 1970-71 season Murton emerged triumphant in three cup competitions winning the Wearside League Cup, the Monkwearmouth Cup and the Ship Owners Cup. During the 1970s and 80s Murton often undertook summer tours playing teams in Jersey, Spain, United States and Germany. Murton decided to seek pastures new in the late 80s and in the 1988-89 season Murton competed in the Northern League Division Two. In their first season Murton finished 11th out of 20 but the following season Murton became Second Division champions. In Murton's first season in the First Division they finished 13th out of 20 teams but in the second season Murton once again improved by finishing runner up on goal difference to Gretna. In the 1992-93 season Murton won the top cup competition in County Durham by winning the Durham Challenge Cup after beating Northern Premier League team Bishop Auckland. That was the last success Murton had, the money eventually ran out and Murton suffered relegation in 1997-98 having conceded 170 goals and scored only 20. A decision was made to resign the club from the league unless more committee members were prepared to come along and help. People did come on board and the club survived, then in the summer of 2000 a hole appeared in the pitch overnight. A collapsed culvert had caused water to erode the soil underneath the pitch causing part of the pitch to collapse in on itself. The pitch was eventually repaired thanks to a grant from the Football Foundation and Murton returned home in October 2001 after playing their home games at Peterlee Town and Kennek Ryhope Community Association (now known as Sunderland Ryhope Community Association). In 2004 the club was expelled from the Northern League as its facilities were deemed not up to standard. Murton joined the Northern Alliance Premier Division for the following season but were relegated in the 2005-06 season. On 11 April 2007 they played in their first cup final since winning the Durham Challenge Cup in the 1992-93 season. They took on Gillford Park from Carlisle and after conceding a late first half goal lost the final 1-0. On 21 April 2008 Murton won the Durham FA Trophy for the first time in their history defeating Whitehill Welfare of the Durham Alliance 3-1. This was also their debut in the competition, previously competing the Durham FA Challenge Cup. They subsequently gained promotion to the Premier Division finishing as runners up in the First Division. The 2008‚Äì09 season saw the club struggle again in the Premier Division and towards the end of the season, manager Brian Maxwell resigned. He was replaced by senior players Andrew Upperton and Stephen Turner who were at the time joint managers of Murton Victoria in the Peterlee & District Sunday League. Relegation was avoided by virtue of the decision by the Northern Alliance committee to only relegate the bottom team, Peterlee Town . Early in the 2011‚Äì12 season manager Brian Maxwell and assistant Paul Carter resigned and Andrew Upperton took over as caretaker manager with Stephen Bridge as assistant. In late September Murton appointed former player Lee Beeston as their new manager. Murton finished the season bottom of the table with 17 points and effectively relegated. However they had earlier in the season submitted their resignation and applied to become members of the Wearside League. Manager Lee Beeston was subsequently dismissed from his post and a new manager was advertised for. Following the AGM Murton's application was unsuccessful and they were without a league for 2012‚Äì13. The club was later accepted into the Durham Alliance. They appointed a new management team in Andy Colledge and Don Naylor. In season 2015/2016 the club were reelected to the Wearside League under the new Manager of John Davison. Team Secretary Callum Milne and long serving Chairman Tom Torrence.

It can transfer a 3D design into a 2D engineering drawing format and also create photo-realistic views using Album Views. It is part-compatible with Pro/ENGINEER, and uses the Granite kernel,Granite Kernel - PTC, http://www.ptc.com/product/creo/granite-interoperability-kernel but otherwise is a freestanding CAD system.

The original software is registered to Cyril Slug of Bimorcad Ltd. (language.dll dialog box 307) no doubt a fictitious company. A picture of the author is contained within dialog box 356. He can be seen wearing a red and black checked jacket sat on a wall, drinking a cup of tea outside his house. The software was built using Microsoft Visual C++ (Microsoft Foundation Class 4.X) and also software modules from D-Cubed to implement geometric constraint solution (2d44nt6.dll of Pro/DESKTOP software) as well as parametric sketching and other part features required for file support with Pro/Engineer (3d27nt6.dll of Pro/DESKTOP software). Different languages were supported e.g. French. There were multiple versions of the software release: * 2001i * 2001i Express * 8.0 * 8.0 Express The Express versions did not support some features of the full software such as the use of bitmaps for rendering images. Threads were represented as cosmetics rather than geometry on the part. This limited use with say STL exports as the resultant exported surface in the data would be a smooth rod rather than a thread form. The 2008 Express release also removed support for VBA available in the 2001i version. The resolution of STL exports was also limited in the express versions e.g. external diameters limited to 0.1¬∞ resolution in the export dialog box. License keys were required, for the Express variants which were obtained from the PTC website without charge (e.g. http://www.ptc.com/cgi/products/desktop_register.pl?lang=en&code;=aaaaaaaaaaaaaa). The returned keys (8 groups of 4 numeric digits) had expiry dates encoded to prevent use of the software after a certain date. The key obtained was based on data from the computer, which limited use of the key to the computer generating the license request. The key was based on the computers hard disk's Volume Serial Number (8 characters) and additional data about the computer (5 bytes). The number was passed to the web server in an obfuscated by alphabetic shift re-arrangement technique in order to make decoding of the transferred data more difficult. e.g. a Hard disk Volume ID of 0000-0000 would be encoded as petssssssssscs where the s is equal to the 0. Pro/DESKTOP had particularly distinguished itself in the education market. From a start in the CAD/CAM in Schools Initiative in the UK, Pro/DESKTOP has been donated free of charge to over 14,000 secondary schools worldwide, and is used by nearly 4 million students each school year. Its main educational rival was AutoCAD, which is widely used in secondary schools to teach 2D drafting and technical drawing. The use of Pro/DESKTOP in schools for 3D design has far exceeded AutoCad as it is generally considered too technical for the education market. Its minimal system requirements further cement the software as the program of choice for those just starting out in CAD. However, Pro/DESKTOP's user interface provides difficulty due to the lack of a multiple string undo function and the program's grouping of entities into work-planes that must have the same characteristics. Pro/DESKTOP is no longer available for download or activation, but PTC instead now offers up to 300 seats of Pro/ENGINEER Schools Edition to high schools free of charge.PTC Pro/ENGINEER Schools Edition page, accessed May 19, 2010 In 2012 PTC continued its support of schools by making its latest Creo 3D Modelling software available free to schools. Creo represents a major update of ProENGINEER with ribbon style menus, streamlined workflows and the addition of several major new features including; direct modelling, flexible modelling and freestyle Sub Division surfacing tools. The use of a common data model supports seamless movement between the different modelling tools with no loss of data. PTC Schools Programme.

It is a short, descriptive passage, more about evoking meaning through imagery than about plot. A blog or web series can also provide a form of vignette or be presented as a series of vignettes. An example of this is the critically acclaimed web series High Maintenance, which presents a different set of characters in each episode, focusing intensely on their specific traits, ideas, and worlds. Vignettes are more commonly used and have been particularly influential in the development of the contemporary notions of a scene as shown in postmodern theater, film and television, where less emphasis is placed on adhering to the conventions of traditional structure and story development. It is also a part of something bigger than itself: for example, a vignette about a house belonging to a collection of vignettes or a whole story, such as The House On Mango Street, by Sandra Cisneros. A vignette contains less action and drama than Flash fiction, and more focus on vividly capturing a single moment. Vignettes are often stand-alone and do not need to connect with other ideas, chapters or stories.  Etymology  The word vignette means \\"little vine\\" in French, and the name of the literary form comes from vignettes, drawings of little vines that nineteenth-century printers used to decorate the title pages and beginnings of chapters.

Also part of Bragernes are several surrounding residential areas, including √òren, Underlia, Hotvet, Landfall√∏ya, Toppenhaug, Str√∏tvet and Braker√∏ya. Immediately north of Bragernes is the Bragernes Hill (Bragernes√•sen), a large recreational woodland area with an extensive network of trails and paths, some with magnificent views of central Drammen. Bragernes Church The main church in Bragernes dates from 1871. Bragernes Church (Bragernes kirke) was erected in neo-Gothic style and located in the heights towards the hill. Its well-known altarpiece with the Resurrection by Adolph Tidemand has been copied in many other churches within Norway. The beautiful carillon has 35 bells. Drammen Theater Interior of Drammen Theater Old Firehouse in Bragernes dating from 1867 Drammen Theater Drammen Theater (Drammens Teater) in Drammen was built in 1869 and was designed by Swedish architect Emil Victor Langlet (1824-1898). The theater was designed by the same model as Parisian theaters as the Ch√¢telet, and performed in a complex Renaissance style with symmetrical facades and round arched windows. The theater was the first modern theater house in the country and was regarded as one of the most beautiful in the Nordic countries. In December 1993, Drammen Theater suffered the total destruction of a fire. The new theater was rebuilt on the model of the original house. It was finished during February 1997 under the direction of architect Jan √òyvind Berntzen.Drammen Theatre Bragernes Square Bragernes Square (Bragernes Torg) is the main square in Drammen. Bragernes Torg is Norway's largest square and one of the largest within Scandinavia. Bragernes Torg maintains a number of urban functions and provides the setting for numerous events. It is both a public place and trade market. Its history starts in 1866, when most of Bragernes was affected by a great fire that devastated 388 buildings. The square is lined by several old, interesting buildings that were built after the fire of 1866.Bragernes Torg ReferencesExternal links *Bragernes Hill Category:Drammen ","title":"Bragernes"},{"id":"4444391","text":"Yu Man Ching () is a Hong Kong composer.

Carmack, 329 U.S. 230 (1946), was a unanimous decision of the Supreme Court of the United States which held that the United States federal government was empowered by Condemnation Act of August 1, 1888; the Public Buildings Act of 1926; and the United States Constitution to exercise its right of eminent domain over land containing buildings owned by a state or local government.Dimitrakopoulos, Dionyssis G. Individual Rights and Liberties Under the U.S. Constitution: The Case Law of the U.S. Supreme Court. Boston: M. Nijhoff, 2007, p. 820. Background The Carmack family owned substantial tracts of land in which would eventually become the city of Cape Girardeau, Missouri. In 1807, the Carmack family conveyed, in trust, title to a plot of land to the City of Cape Girardeau with the restriction that the land only be used for public purposes.. An adjacent plot of land was also conveyed in trust in 1820, with an identical restriction. In the late 1930s, pursuant to their authority under the Condemnation Act of 1888 and the Public Buildings Act of 1926, the site was selected by the Federal Works Agency and the United States Postmaster General as the site for a future federal courthouse and a federal post office.Carmack, 329 U.S. at 232. In 1941, the United States sought permission to condemn that land and exercise its right of eminent domain from a United States district court.Carmack, 329 U.S. at 233. After judicial proceedings, the condemnation was approved. Iska W. Carmack, an heir of the Carmack family; the City of Cape Girardeau; and the state of Missouri contested the decision, but the district court held that Carmack had no right to contest the proceedings. All three parties appealed. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals reversed the decision of the district court and ordered the district court to reconsider the case and to include Carmack as a respondent.Carmack v. United States, 135 F.2d 196 (1943). In 1944, the district court held a second set of condemnation proceedings, and this time concluded that the United States had arbitrarily and capriciously selected the site in disregard for federal law and regulation.United States v. Certain Land, Etc., 55 F.Supp. 555 (1944). The United States appealed. The Eighth Circuit Court of Appeals affirmed the judgment of the district court, but on different grounds. The appellate court said that the Federal Works Agency and the Postmaster General did not have the statutory authority to begin condemnation proceedings.United States v. Carmack, 151 F.2d 881 (8th Cir. 1945). The United States appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court, which granted certiorari. Decision=Majority opinion In an opinion by Associate Justice Harold Hitz Burton, the unanimous Court reaffirmed the concept of eminent domain, recognizing the power of the government to seize land according to the Condemnation Act and Public Buildings Act. Burton asserted that the Court, far removed from the date of enactment of these laws, must be slow to read into them any limitation on public officials not expressly provided for by the acts.Carmack, 329 U.S. at 236. The majority also held as settled the concept (enunciated in Kohl v. United States, 91 U.S. 367 (1875)) that the federal government need not seek to enforce its eminent domain rights solely in state courts.Carmack, 329 U.S. at 237. It made little difference whether the federal government sought to condemn private or public land, Burton concluded.Carmack, 329 U.S. at 238-239. Nor did it matter that the land was held by the state in trust, for the federal government had notified all title holders of its decision to condemn the land.Carmack, 329 U.S. at 239. Burton reviewed the constitutional grants of power which gave the United States the power of eminent domain and concluded that this power was supreme:Carmack, 329 U.S. at 240-243. :The considerations that made it appropriate for the Constitution to declare that the Constitution of the United States, and the laws of the United States made in pursuance thereof, shall be the supreme law of the land make it appropriate to recognize that the power of eminent domain, when exercised by Congress within its constitutional powers, be equally supreme.Carmack, 329 U.S. at 240. Unwilling to read into the Condemnation Act or the Public Buildings Act limitations which were not there, Burton analyzed the process by which federal officials had chosen the site in question, and concluded that it represented a rational and reasonable exercise of the government's powers.Carmack, 329 U.S. at 243-248. Concurrence Associate Justice William O. Douglas concurred in the result and the opinion of the Court, but reserved judgment \\"as to the circumstances under which authority to condemn land owned by a city or a state should be inferred from a general condemnation statute if the local government challenged the taking.\\"Carmack, 329 U.S. at 248 (Douglas, J., concurring).

Vignettes are currently used in several European countries. The term originated in France in the 1950s, although vignettes there were not linked to motorway use and no longer exist; it is now used throughout Central Europe, as well as in Italy (vignetta). Vignettes are used in Austria, Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Hungary, Moldova, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Switzerland. In most of these countries a small, coloured sticker is affixed to a vehicle windscreen, but in Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania and SlovakiaeZnamka.sk these have been superseded by electronic vignettes. In Moldova, vignettes are required for the use of any road, while in Bulgaria and Romania they are required for the use of any road outside urban areas. In the other countries, vignettes are required only for the use of motorways and expressways. Prices for an annual vignette for passenger cars range from ‚Ç¨30 to ‚Ç¨150, depending on country. In all countries except Switzerland, short-period vignettes are sold for visiting or transiting vehicles. In Switzerland, visiting foreign motorists must buy an annual vignette to use the country's motorways. Vignettes can usually be obtained at border crossings, gas stations and other outlets. Improperly used or lost vignettes are usually not refunded.Car toll in Europe Vignette stickers are usually constructed in such a way that detaching and re-attaching them is impossible without destruction, ensuring that they cannot be used on more than one vehicle. Road traffic is often monitored by roadside cameras, and vignettes are verified by state officials, such as border guards and national police. Hefty cash fines are often charged to travelers using public roads without a valid and properly affixed vignette. Additional tolls are usually levied for passing through certain motorway tunnels and bridges.Vignettes and toll in Europe Vignette obligation by country=European Union The Eurovignette Directive introduced in the European Union in 1993 governs road tolls for trucks of minimum 12 metric tonnes. An international agreement, based on Article 8 of the Eurovignette Directive, signed in 1994 by Belgium, Denmark, Germany, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands established a common system of vignettes within the Eurovignette framework. Sweden signed a protocol to acceded to the agreement in 1997, while Germany denounced the agreement in 2017. Austria Austrian vignette, valid for 10 days, starting on 4 April 2011. Since 1997, vignettes are required for all vehicles of up to 3.5 tonnes, driving on motorways and expressways (prefixed with letters A and S) under federal administration. Vignettes are overseen by the police and toll-sheriff employees of the federal motorway administration. A ‚Ç¨240 fine with an additional obligatory payment of a substitute toll are charged to travelers without a valid vignette, and unpaid fines lead to penalties between ‚Ç¨300 and ‚Ç¨3,000. Furthermore, the vehicle may be confiscated from foreigners to guarantee payment of the penalty. Additional tolls are charged for certain motorway sections where tollgates and video tolling systems are installed. Several sections require drivers to buy electronic toll cards.

He was University Professor at Columbia University, where he was based in the Department of Chemistry and affiliated with the Departments of Biological Sciences and Pharmacology; he had also been on the faculty of its Department of Chemical Engineering. He had taught at Columbia since 1956 and was a former chair of the university's chemistry department.http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/nytimes/obituary.aspx?n=ronald- breslow&pid;=187067788&fhid;=2086 Life and career Breslow was born in Rahway, New Jersey, the son of Gladys (Fellows) and Alexander E. Breslow. He was interested in the design and synthesis of new molecules with interesting properties, and the study of these properties. Examples include the cyclopropenyl cation, the simplest aromatic system and the first aromatic compound prepared with other than six electrons in a ring. His seminal contributions include the correct site of reactivity of thiamin diphosphate in enzymes that promote the decarboxylation of pyruvate - based on his pioneering use of proton NMR with small molecule analogues - and the rate enhancement provided by binding to cyclodextrins produced major themes for study in modern organic and biological chemistry. He also co-discovered the histone deacetylase inhibitor SAHA (Vorinostat) which is FDA-approved for the treatment of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Breslow earned his B.A., M.A. and Ph.D. from Harvard University, where his doctoral advisor was R. B. Woodward. Among Breslow's former Ph.D. students is Robert Grubbs, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2005, and Doug La Follette, Secretary of State of Wisconsin. Breslow received many honors and awards, including the National Medal of Science in 1991,National Science Foundation - The President's National Medal of Science the Welch Award, the Arthur C. Cope Award (1987), the NAS Award in Chemical Sciences, the American Chemical Society's ACS Award in Pure Chemistry (1966), the Othmer Gold Medal (2006), the Priestley Medal, and the 2014 American Institute of Chemists (AIC) Gold Medal. In recognition of his classroom skills, Columbia awarded him both its Mark Van Doren Award and its Great Teacher Award. He served as president of the ACS in 1996 and chaired the chemistry division of the National Academy of Sciences from 1974 to 1977. In 1997 he was named one of the top 75 contributors to the chemical enterprise of the past 75 years by Chemical & Engineering News. He was the Myron L. Bender distinguished lecturer at Northwestern University in 1999. The Ronald Breslow Award for Achievement in Biomimetic Chemistry, awarded annually by the ACS, is named in his honor. He was a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the European Academy of Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. He is also a foreign member of the Royal Society and an honorary member of many other scientific bodies around the world. In 2012, his paper \\"Evidence for the Likely Origin of Homochirality in Amino Acids, Sugars, and Nucleosides on Prebiotic Earth\\" was retracted from the Journal of the American Chemical Society due to copyright concerns, leading to a debate on self-plagiarism and the distinction between a personal review and a paper. Synthesis of cyclopropenyl cation The cyclopropenyl cation, First prepared by mixing 3-chlorocyclopropene with antimony pentachloride, aluminum trichloride, or silver fluoroborate. Carbon-13 NMR shows singlets with a coupling constant of 265 ¬± 1 Hz. The authors suggest that this coupling constant is suggestive that the C-H bond is 53% s character. The overall bonding framework then consists of sp orbitals to all hydrogens, two sp3 orbitals for each sigma bond, and one p orbital for the œÄ framework. D-Orbital Conjugation It had been suggested that carbanion- sulfone double bonds will not show aromatic character-primarily as a result of the nodes present in d-orbitals.Breslow, R.; Mohacsi, E.; ‚ÄúStudies on d-Orbital Conjugation. II. Lack of Aromaticity in Systems Containing a Carbanion-Sulfone Double Bond‚Äù J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1962, 84, 684 Straight chain analogs were chosen based on the comparable acidity, combined with previous studies indicating that steric effects are largely negligible.Breslow, R.; Mohacsi, E.; ‚ÄúStudies on d-Orbital Conjugation. I. the Absence of a Through- Conjugation Effect in Some Sulfone Carbanions‚Äù J. Am. Chem. Soc. 1961, 83, 4100 The straight chain analogs are shown below. Straight Chain Analogs for Aromaticity Studies Compound II was treated with dimethoxyethane/D2O/triethylamine and was found to be completely deuterated upon recovery. The deuterated compound was then treated with butyllithium in ether, with dimethoxyethane and 2N HCl regenerating the starting material. The cyclic analog (III, shown below) was deuterated in the same manner, and addition of deuterated I, followed by quenching to regenerate the protonated form, was analyzed by NMR. There was one proton peak, and it was shown to equilibrate equally between compounds II and III, indicating that compounds had similar acidity. From this result, the researchers concluded that compound III was not aromatic, because stabilizing effect of aromaticity on the anion should increase the acidity of the parent compound. Cyclic Compounds for Aromaticity Studies The ester analogs were prepared (IV and V) and were found to be acidic enough for titration. The compounds were titraed under nitrogen with 0.2N NaOH with a Beckman Model GS meter with an E-2 electrode. Compound IV was found to have a pKa of 8.9 +/- 0.1, while compound V had a pKa of 11.1 +/- 0.2. Origins of Homochirality on Prebiotic Earth The essential building blocks of life (amino acids and key sugars-ribose and deoxyribose) can exist in one of two forms-L or D.Breslow, R.; Chen, Z.; ‚ÄúOn the Origin of Terrestrial Homochirality for Nucleosides and Amino Acids‚Äù PNAS 2009, 106, 9144-9146 However life has evolved such that the vast majority of amino acids are L and the sugars are D. If the amino acids and sugars present in life were racemic (consisting of both L and D), then proteins, DNA, and RNA would not adopt a well defined conformation, resulting in a loss of function. The question of how this preference first occurred has puzzled scientists for years while several theories have been proposed; there is still no clear answer. There is growing evidence that the chiral preference came from outer space as scientists discovered Œ±-methyl amino acids inside the Murchison meteorite that have a slight enantiomeric excess (ee) for the L conformation. These Œ±-methyl amino acids are believed to be from outer space as a result of their high abundance of 13C and deuterium. Furthermore, Œ±-methyl amino acids are generally not present in terrestrial chemistry. A common critique is that these amino acids would not be able to tolerate the high temperatures upon entering earth's atmosphere as the meteorite crashed into the planet. However, the amino acids have been found inside the meteorite, with the meteorite acting as an insulator. Unlike regular amino acids, Œ±-methyl amino acids are not capable of racemizing by enolization on an evolutionary time scale, shown below. Racemization of Amino Acids on an evolutionary time scale. Alpha methyl amino acids cannot racemize However, there is considerable debate as to how the L conformation of Œ±-methyl amino acids was selected for. The most widely accepted theory is that right circularly polarized light in outer space (somewhat) selectively destroyed the D conformation.Breslow, R.; Levine, M.; Cheng, Z.; ‚ÄúImitating Prebiotic Homochirality on Earth‚Äù Orig. Life Evol. Biosph. 2010, 40, 11-26 In theory, synchrotrons produce light of opposite handedness (right and left) above and below the circulation plane. This has been demonstrated in experiments on earth. The theory continues then that neutron stars could act as synchrotrons-with right polarized light pointing in our direction of the universe, and left polarized light pointing in the opposite direction. However, other astronomers claim that the polarization only occurs in the infrared region, which only has sufficient energy to cause molecular vibrations and stretches-far from being capable of destroying molecules.Buschermohle, M.; Whittet, D.; Chrysostomou, A.; Hough, J.; Adamson, A.; Whitney, B.; Wolff, M.; ‚ÄúAn Extended Search for Circularly Polarized Infrared Radiation from the OMC-1 Region of Orion.‚Äù Astrophys. J. 2005, 624, 821-826 A second problem encountered with the L Œ±-methyl amino acids is how to generate enantiomerically pure regular amino acids from the slight excess.Breslow, R.; Levine, M.; Cheng, Z.; ‚ÄúImitating Prebiotic Homochirality on Earth‚Äù Orig. Life Evol. Biosph. 2010, 40, 11-26 The issue is illustrated in the below figure. Decarboxylative transamination. Note that the final product shown can be protonated from either face, generating a racemic mixture after hydrolysis of the imine. Note that the above product can be protonated from either face with equal probability. The final acid is generated by hydrolysis of the imine. It's worth noting that the alpha keto acid is believed to be formed from a Strecker-like reaction, shown below. Formation of alpha keto acids. The product shown above is believed to be oxidized to the final alpha keto acid by oxidation by iron oxide, as oxygen was not present on prebiotic earth. From figure 5, we see that the L alpha-methyl amino acids do not directly act as a chiral directing group to generate the normal L amino acid. Researchers hoped that a second molecule of the alpha-methy amino acid could act as a directing group, however they found that the D enantiomer was slightly favored when only L alpha-methyl amino acids were present. The figure below shows how the D enantiomer is favored. The conformation of the alpha- methyl amino acid favors protonation on the top face of the molecule, leading to the D-enantiomer. Hydrolysis of the decarboxylation product generates the D-amino acid. When researchers added copper to the reaction, the resulting product was the L enantiomer. Meteors have been found to contain both copper and zinc-justifying the researchers' use of the metal. However, when zinc was used in the same reaction, the L enantiomer was not preferentially formed. Based on computational calculations, the copper forms a square planar complex (shown below) and sterics facilitate protonation to generate the L amino acid. Copper complex leading to the formation of L-amino acids. When a slight enantiomeric excess is present, the solubility's of the pure and racemic crystal can be manipulated to generate large ee's of the pure enantiomer. If we define certain solubility's as such: KL= [L] represents the solubility of the pure enantiomer KDL= [D][L] represents the solubility product of the racemic mixture such that [D]= KDL/[L] We can then define the ratio of [L]/[D] = [L]2/KDL When both enantiomers are present, a racemic crystal structure is formed-however it is lower in energy, has a higher melting point, and is less soluble than the enantiomerically pure crystal structure. As a result, when a slight excess of one enantiomer is present, the ee can be amplified by evaporating solvent-causing the racemate to precipitate. Researchers have been able to start with an ee of 1% L, and ultimately end up with 95:5 solution of L: D. The results discussed above (particularly the synchrotron argument) led Breslow to propose that the D amino acids and L sugars could generate life in other parts of the universe.Breslow, R. ‚ÄúThe Origin of Homochirality in Amino Acids and Sugars on Prebiotic Earth‚Äù Tetrahedron Lett. 2011, 52, 4228-4232 ReferencesExternal links *Official biography *A Video interview of Professor Breslow Category:1931 births Category:2017 deaths Category:People from Rahway, New Jersey Category:Columbia University faculty Category:National Medal of Science laureates Category:Foreign Members of the Royal Society Category:Members of the United States National Academy of Sciences Category:Foreign Fellows of the Indian National Science Academy Category:Harvard University alumni Category:Members of the American Philosophical Society ","title":"Ronald Breslow"},{"id":"4444436","text":"Sir Francis Simon (2 July 1893 ‚Äì 31 October 1956), was a German and later British physical chemist and physicist who devised the gaseous diffusion method, and confirmed its feasibility, of separating the isotope Uranium-235 and thus made a major contribution to the creation of the atomic bomb. Early life He was born Franz Eugen Simon to a Jewish family in Berlin and won the Iron Cross First Class during World War I. He received his doctoral degree from the University of Berlin, working in the research group of Walther Nernst on low-temperature physics related to the Nernst Heat Theorem (Third law of thermodynamics). In 1931 he was appointed Professor of Physical Chemistry at Breslau. Emigration The rise of anti-Semitic fascism in Germany in the 1930s caused him and his wife to consider emigrating. Aware of his concerns Frederick Lindemann, 1st Viscount Cherwell met him in Walther Nernst's laboratory during Easter 1933, and invited him to join the Clarendon Laboratory at the University of Oxford. He was also able to offer him a two- year grant research from Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI) of ¬£800. Simon resigned on 1 July 1933, but before he could leave an official demanded that he and his wife surrender their passports. Simon then flung his Iron Cross and other medals onto the table. Their passports were later returned, for reasons unknown.Medawar & Pyke. Page 81. Using the services of a corrupt customs official Simon was able to take his research equipment with him. His wife and children followed him two months later. Upon arrival in the UK, he started using the Anglicised name \\"Francis\\". Work in England Using the equipment he had brought with him from Germany he performed pioneering work in low temperature physics. In 1936 he was able to produce the first liquid helium by using magnetic cooling at a laboratory at Bellevue near Paris. His ICI grant was extended to 1938 which allowed him to turn down an offer of a 10-year contract as Professor of Physical Chemistry at Istanbul. In 1936 despite being supported by Einstein, Nernst, Planck and Rutherford he was unsuccessful in beating Mark Oliphant for the Chair of Physics at Birmingham University. His job security in Oxford improved in 1936 when he was appointed Reader in Thermodynamics and a Student of Christ Church. Because he was naturalised, until 1940 he was prevented from working on radar. Because he was also on the list of people targeted for retribution by the Nazis his wife and children took up an offer to spend the war in Canada. Simon remained behind in Oxford. In 1940 in collaboration with Nicholas Kurti and Heinrich Gerhard Kuhn, he was commissioned by the MAUD Committee to investigate the feasibility of separating uranium-235 by gaseous diffusion. He initially adapted his wife's wire kitchen strainer to assist in this work before commissioning a membrane from ICI containing 160,000 holes to the square inch. His resulting conclusions on the separation of uranium isotopes was transferred to the Manhattan Project and was the basis of the process that produced sufficient U235 to make the atomic bomb.Medawar & Pyke. Page 221. He spent the latter part of the Second World War at Los Alamos, returning in 1945 to Oxford to continue his low temperature research. He became a professor at the University of Oxford and a Student of Christ Church, Oxford in 1945. Upon the retirement of Lord Cherwell he became Dr. Lee's Professor of Experimental Philosophy and head of the Clarendon Laboratory in 1956, one month before his death from coronary disease. Personal life He married Charlotte M√ºnchhausen in 1922. They had two daughters, Kathrin and Dorothee.Medawar & Pyke. Page 80.

Service history Between 22 May 1944 and 15 May 1945, Fowler made six voyages to escort convoys from New York, Norfolk, and Boston to ports in northern Africa, guarding men and supplies destined for the operations in Italy and southern France. The fifth such voyage, between 1 February and 16 March 1945, was marked by the presence of submarines both outward and homeward bound. On 17 February, west of Gibraltar, two of the merchantmen were torpedoed, but both were brought safely into Gibraltar, one after Fowler had stood by to screen while a tug came out to help. Two days out of Oran homeward bound on 28 February, Fowler picked up a sound contact, and made an urgent attack which brought debris to the surface. A second attack, made in coordination with a French escort, was believed to have sunk , however, as this submarine was subsequently found off the coast of New Jersey, what, if anything, was attacked remains unknown. In June 1945, Fowler began serving as a target and escort to submarines training out of New London, Connecticut, then in September, arrived at Miami, Florida, to serve as schoolship for the Naval Training Center.

In 1960, he was awarded the Israel Prize for his contributions to science. Biography Franz Sondheimer was born in Stuttgart on 17 May 1926, the second son of Max and Ida Sondheimer. His father ran the family glue manufacturing business. His elder brother, Ernst, was Professor of Mathematics at Westfield College. Having business connections in England, Max Sondheimer managed to get his family to London in September 1937. Sondheimer, knowing no English, began his schooling in England first at Southend and then at Hailey School in Bournemouth. In 1940, having passed Common Entrance, he attended the part of Highgate School remaining in London, where he obtained School Certificate in nine subjects in 1942. A little over a year later he gained entrance to Imperial College, where he studied until the end of the war, coming top of his year in the final examination. He was awarded a PhD in 1948, having studied acetylenic compounds under the guidance of Ian Heilbron and E R H Jones. Sondheimer moved to Harvard in 1948, to join Woodward‚Äôs group in their project on steroid synthesis. He next moved, early in 1952, to Syntex in Mexico City to succeed Carl Djerassi as head of research. During his four year stay he helped create short direct routes to cortisone, and to all of the major sex hormones. He thoroughly enjoyed his time there and was much loved and respected. He explored much of the region in his own Beechcraft Bonanza aircraft.U.S. Customs, Immigration and Health form, Brownsville TX, flight from Tampico, 7 May 1954 In 1956, aged 30, Sondheimer was appointed head of the Department of Organic Chemistry at the Weizmann Institute.

He had considerable freedom, set up a large international group, and was made a Fellow of Churchill College. Nonetheless, he was not happy at Cambridge and transferred in 1967 to University College London. In May of that year he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. His membership citation read: Professor Sondheimer is distinguished for his work on the total synthesis of a range of natural products, the partial synthesis of steroid hormones and analogues, and especially for his syntheses of the hitherto unknown class of conjugated unsaturated macrocyclic compounds which has led to some interesting theoretical conclusions. On these topics he has so far published 167 papers. However, funding problems, the difficulty of recruiting foreign postdoctoral students, and his continued focus on now- unfashionable areas of research, all contributed to this not being a satisfactory chapter in his career. Franz Sondheimer suffered from prolonged depression. He died on 11 February 1981 in his office at Stanford‚Äôs Stauffer Laboratory, where he had been on sabbatical. He had apparently committed suicide by taking cyanide. Sondheimer's notable students include K. C. Nicolaou, Raphael Mechoulam, Timothy Walsgrove, and Henry N. C. Wong.

Weiskrantz is credited with discovering the phenomenon of blindsight, and with establishing the role of the amygdala in emotional learning and emotional behavior. Blindsight is when a person with a brain injury causing blindness can nevertheless detect, point accurately at, and discriminate visually presented objects.Weiskrantz, Lawrence (1986). Blindsight: A Case Study and Implications. Oxford University Press. Early life Weiskrantz originally attended Girard College, a boarding school in Philadelphia, due in part to the death of his father when he was six. After graduating, he attended Swarthmore College and served in World War II. Shortly before his graduation, he was awarded a Catherwood fellowship at Oxford University. Career Weiskrantz became Professor of Psychology at Oxford University where he remained a full professor until retirement in 1993. He then became an emeritus professor of the university and an emeritus fellow of Magdalen College. Weiskrantz had a lifelong interest in the writings and research of the Russian neuropsychologist Alexander Luria, whom he had met and befriended while Luria was still doing research. The two remained colleagues until Luria's death in 1977. In the 1950s Weiskrantz went on to ellucidate the region of the temporal lobe responsible for the erratic emotional behaviors in Kl√ºver-Bucy syndrome, a phenomenon known since the 1930 which came to inspire the limbic brain hypothesis of emotion. Although this hypothesis did not live to its claims, Weiskrantz used instrumental fear conditioning in lesioned animals to indentify the temporal structure responsible for Kl√ºver-Bucy syndrome. Ever since, the amygdala has remained crucial in the scientific understanding of emotion. Weiskrantz is generally credited with having discovered the phenomenon of blindsight following his book on this subject in 1986, which is the voluntary visually evoked response to a stimulus presented within a scotoma. Academic and service positions he held included: * Part-time Lecturer, Tufts University, 1952 * Research Associate, Inst. of Living, 1952‚Äì55 * Senior Postdoctoral Fellow, US National Research Council, 1955‚Äì56 * Research Associate, University of Cambridge, 1956‚Äì61 * Assistant Director of Research, Cambridge, 1961‚Äì66 * Reader in Physiological Psychology, Cambridge Univ., 1966‚Äì67. * Founding President of the European Brain and Behaviour Society, 1969 * Professor of Psychology, Oxford University, and Fellow, Magdalen College, Oxford, 1967‚Äì1993; * Professor Emeritus, Oxford University, 1993‚Äì2018 and Emeritus Fellow, Magdalen College, Oxford, 1993‚Äì2018. * Honorary President of European Society for Philosophy and Psychology. * Inaugural President of European Brain and Behaviour Society. * President of Association for Scientific Study of Consciousness. Weiskrantz supervised at least 10 PhDs, including Alan Cowey, Charles Gross, Nicholas Humphrey, Susan Iversen, and Melvyn A. Goodale. Honours Weiskrantz was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1980. He was on its council in 1988‚Äì1989. He was a member of the U.S. National Academy of Sciences, and of Academia Europaea. Weiskrantz served on the Council of the Fyssen Foundation. Weiskrantz was a medalist of the Royal Society of Medicine and a medalist of the American Association for Advancement of Science.

The house was designed by architect James Kelley and built in 1889 for the noted inventor, electrical engineer, and industrialist Elihu Thomson (1853-1937). Thomson was, with Edwin J. Houston, co-founder of the Thomson-Houston Electric Company which would later merge with Thomas Edison's Edison General Electric Company to become the General Electric Company. The house was built with an observatory, which no longer exists. It has housed Swampscott town offices since 1944, when it was given to the town by Thomson's heirs. The building was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1976 for its association with Thomson. and Description Swampscott Town Hall is set on an expansive lot overlooking the town's soldiers memorial and Linscott Park in the town center. It is a two-story brick Georgian Revival structure with a tiled hip roof that is crowned by a low balustrade with turned balusters and urn-topped posts. The main facade is asymmetrically fenestrated, but there are symmetrically placed gable dormers in the roof, and the entrance is in a slightly off-center gable- topped projection. The building corners, as well as those of the entry section, have Ionic stone pilasters at the corners. The main entrance is sheltered by a round portico supported by fluted Corinthian columns, which supported an entablature with a carved frieze. The portico is topped by a balcony with a low railing slightly different from that on the roof. Above the entrance is a French door flanked by stone fluted Corinthian pilasters, and topped by a scrollwork pediment. Large windows on either side of the entrance on the first floor are topped by similar pediments. Upon entry through the front door, there is a vestibule lit through stained-glass windows, followed by a panelled entry hall, which leads to a large two-story living space in the rear of the house, from which a grand staircase rises to the second floor. Pocket doors from these halls lead to what were formerly living and dining rooms at the front of the house, and there is a small guest bathroom immediately left of the vestibule in the front projection. A significant portion of the woodwork in the downstairs has been lost due to the building's conversion for municipal use, but the living room, which now serves as the selectmen's office, and the central hall are largely intact. Also well- preserved is one of the children's bedrooms upstairs, which has a Moorish theme. Behind the main house is Thomson's original carriage house, which was originally connected to the main house by a covered walkway, since replaced by an enclosed passage. This alteration resulted in the loss of a projecting bow window. Above the carriage house is a space that was used by Elihu Thomson as a laboratory. History The house was designed by James T. Kelley in collaboration with Harold T. Graves, a team that also designed the Swampscott Public Library (completed 1917). Elihu Thomson, their client, is said to have taken an active role in the design of the structure, selecting interior finishes and other details. Thomson lived, and frequently also worked on his inventions, at the property until his death in 1937. It was presented by his heirs to the town in his memory, and is now known as the Elihu Thomson Memorial Administration Building. Elihu Thomson was born in Manchester, England, and came to the United States as a child. Showing an early aptitude for research and experimentation, he taught at a Philadelphia high school, and developed a practical arc lamp system with a colleague. Funded by New England businessmen, this idea was commercialized, and the Thomson-Houston Electric Company was by 1890 a leading maker of electrical equipment. In 1892 it merged with Thomas Edison's Edison General Electric Company to form the company known today as General Electric. His contributions to science and engineering thereafter include a wide range of practical advances in the application of electricity, and included more than 700 patents. Thomson is also credited with establishing the idea that industrial research and development was an important component of a successful business, including the creation of laboratories that perform pure scientific research.

Alec Young was the son of refugees from Russia who raised him in Stepney, London. He attended Central Foundation Boys' School for his secondary education. He first noticed his future wife Dora Caplan when they were both studying at a public library. In December 1931 he sat for examination at Cambridge University and was successful at winning an Exhibition to Gonville and Caius College. In order to achieve matriculation in one of the classical languages, a condition of entry at the time, he was obliged to make an intense study of Latin over a 6 month period and was duly awarded a School Certificate in the subject in June 1932. Beyond his studies at Cambridge, Alec played tennis, swam, was cox of a rowing eight, and courted Dora. After graduation he continued study with Melvill Jones who had written \\"The Streamline Aeroplane\\" for the Royal Aeronautical Society in 1929. Their study aimed to reduce parasitic drag of an aircraft. Alec published his findings with the Aeronautical Research Council. In 1936 he went to the Aerodynamics Department of the Royal Aircraft Establishment at Farnborough, Hampshire. There he became a member of the Civil Service and was able to marry his sweetheart Dora. They were to have two sons, Robert and Jonathan. Minimization of drag was his focus, even measuring drag of rivet heads, lap joints, gaps and paint. He was able to give corrective instructions for the Hampden bomber and some trainers. In 1942 he began to work with wind tunnels and William Hawthorne in development of jet engines. The work sought to determine high-speed flow characteristics in inlets, curved and straight ducts, and diffusers. He also worked with Sydney Goldstein of the National Physical Laboratory to extend the Prandtl-Glauert transformation from two to three dimensions. In July 1946 Alec became Senior Lecturer at the College of Aeronautics, Cranfield. One of Alec's collaborations there was with Abraham Robinson on 3D flows approaching the speed of sound. Another project attempted noise control of jet engines by modification of the efflux nozzle to improve mixing with external flow. He was awarded a patent and collected some royalties. Daughter Judith arrived in 1949, and the following year Alec became Professor at Cranfield. In 1951 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society. In 1954 he became Professor of Aeronautical Engineering, Queen Mary College, University of London. In 1962 he was elected Dean of the Faculty of Engineering. A bachelor's degree in avionics was pioneered in collaboration with Marconi Electronic Systems. In 1966 he became Vice- Principal at the College. His research following up the causes of the tragic Munich air crash of 1958, which resulted in the deaths of most of the Manchester United football team, was of great interest to the media, because in pinpointing the slush on the runway as the key factor, rather than the ice on the wings, the pilot of the aircraft was vindicated and the airport authorities were seen to be at fault in giving the go-ahead for take-off. Dora Young developed a brain tumor in 1968 and died in 1970. The following year daughter Judith married Herman Waldmann. His mother, a widow, then married Alec the widower. He formally retired in 1978 but continued to be very active academically with some collaborations on the research front, with consultancy both in the UK and abroad, guest lectures and the authorship of articles and several books. He was awarded an OBE in 1964, and elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in 1973. He was awarded the Ludwig-Prandtl-Ring from the Deutsche Gesellschaft f√ºr Luft- und Raumfahrt (German Society for Aeronautics and Astronautics) for \\"outstanding contribution in the field of aerospace engineering\\" in 1976.

In 1756, at the beginning of the Seven Years' War against France, Austria, and Saxony (and subsequently the Mughal Empire, Spain, Russia and Sweden) Britain urgently needed to recruit men for the navy. Jonas Hanway (1712‚Äì1786), who had already made his mark as a traveller, Russia Company merchant, writer and philanthropist, must take the chief credit for founding the society which both contributed to the solution of that particular problem, and has continued for the next two and a half centuries to assist many thousands of young people in preparing for a career at sea. In 2004, in a merger with the Sea Cadet Association, the Marine Society & Sea Cadets was formed. Formation Plaque marking site of the foundation of the Marine Society The Marine Society, the world's oldest public maritime charity, was an initiative of a group of London merchants and gentlemen, who first met at the King's Arms Tavern, Cornhill, London on 25 June, 1756 to discuss a plan to supply two or three thousand seafarers for the navy. Recruitment began immediately. Sponsors were sought and advertisements for volunteers appeared in newspapers and on the street: > \\"Notice is hereby given, that all stout lads and boys, who incline to go on > board His Majesty‚Äôs Ships, with a view to learn the duty of a seaman, and > are, upon examination, approved by the Marine Society, shall be handsomely > clothed and provided with bedding, and their charges born down to the ports > where His Majesty‚Äôs Ships lye, with all other proper encouragement.\\" Ten men were duly clothed and delivered to ships of the King's navy. In this small way began the work of the Marine Society. The main object of the charity when founded was sending unemployed or orphaned teenagers to sea as officers' servants. The Royal Navy was estimated to need about 4,500 boys as servants during wartime. Approximately a thousand were 'young gentlemen' intending to be officers, and many of the remainder were supplied by the Society. As the boys were for the most part from non-seafaring families the Society probably provided a real increase of several thousand to the pool of naval recruitment. The Society also provided over ten thousand naval recruits with free clothing, which helped reduce the typhus problem.N. A. M. Rodger, The Command of the Ocean: A Naval History of Britain 1649‚Äì1815 (New York: W.W. Norton & Company: 2004), 313. Incorporated by Act of Parliament The scheme really took off. By 1763, the Society had recruited over 10,000 men and boys; in 1772, such was its perceived importance in the life of the nation, it was incorporated in an Act of Parliament. Admiral Nelson became a stalwart supporter and trustee of the charity, such that by the time of the Battle of Trafalgar (1805) at least 15% of British manpower was being supplied, trained and equipped by the Marine Society. The relative professionalism of these men, the great British naval hero readily acknowledged, played a part in his victories. Hostilities cease, Education starts But the end of hostilities meant that naval recruitment was no longer the nation's first priority, although Admiral Boscawen was later to write: \\"No scheme for manning the navy, within my knowledge, has ever had the success as the Marine Society‚Äôs.\\" Hanway now formulated plans for transferring boys to the merchant service on their discharge from naval ships and from then on, the Society was equally involved with both Royal and Merchant navies. Early reports from commanding officers had indicated that the number of desertions might be reduced if boys equipped by the Society were given a period of training before being sent to sea. Initially the Society hired a schoolmaster and bandmaster to teach some of the boys and in 1786 purchased a merchant ship the Beatty, which was converted to a training ship and renamed Marine Society. The Society thus became the first organisation in the world to pioneer nautical training for boys in its special school ship which was moored in the Thames between Deptford and Greenwich. This example was followed in the nineteenth century by many other organisations in ports round the British Isles. From 1799 until 1918 The Admiralty provided a succession of training ships, the last two of which were renamed Warspite; starting with HMS Warspite (1807) in 1846, and later HMS Conqueror renamed in 1877. In 1922 the Society commissioned HMS Hermione as the third Warspite. However the outbreak of the second world war forced the Society to evacuate the ship owing to the probability of air attack. From 1756 to 1940 the Society recruited over 110,000 men and boys for the Royal Navy, the British East India Company and Merchant service. Records show that from 1756 to 1815 the charity provided some twelve percent of naval manpower, all the more valuable to the nation since each one was a volunteer. In February 1945 the vice-president of the Society, Frederick Mead, retired from the chairmanship of the Society, following 51 years as a committee member. Mead was 97 years old. After the Second World War After the Second World War, the Society concluded that there were by then sufficient facilities for sea- training provided by national authorities. It continued to provide sea-kits for many young seafarers and, where necessary, offered grants for their education, but in the 1950s the Society began to insist that cadets thus helped should have completed a good general education, obtaining a minimum of four GCE passes at O level. In this way the Marine Society pioneered what was subsequently accepted as standard practice for the entry of officers into the Merchant Navy. Between 1940 and 1987, as the Society's reserves increased, it was not only able to help individual seafarers but also to make grants to many maritime charities. In 1981 it provided the base funds for the Marine Adventure Sailing Trust, a limited life investment trust fund, which enabled it to make further substantial grants to the Sea Cadet Corps, TS Foudroyant, Ocean Youth Club and other maritime youth charities. In 1976 the Society amalgamated with various other maritime charities with similar aims, including the Incorporated Thames Nautical Training Trust (Thames Nautical Training College located four times on a HMS Worcester), the Seafarers Education Service, the Sailors' Home and Red Ensign Club, the Merchant Navy Comforts Service Trust and the British Ship Adoption Society. The merger of the Seafarers Education Service with the Marine Society at this time was hugely significant and helped to ensure the continued relevance of both operations. The Service consisted of the Marine Society College of the Sea and Seafarers Libraries, and had been inaugurated in 1919 by Albert Mansbridge who had earlier founded the Workers Educational Association. Both the College of the Sea and Seafarers Libraries continue to flourish today. For the past 30 years,This article was written in 2006 the principal objectives of the Marine Society have been to facilitate and to provide practical and financial support for the education, training and well-being of all professional seafarers and to encourage young people to embark on maritime careers. For many years the Marine Society has had strong ties with the Sea Cadet Corps, not only as benefactor and landlord to the Sea Cadet Association, but also by providing sea training opportunities for hundreds of sea cadets each year. It was because of these ties plus the complementary objectives of the two charities and, more specifically, the mutual desire to introduce an element of Merchant Navy ethos to the Sea Cadet Corps, that the merger of the Sea Cadet Association with the Marine Society came about 30 November 2004. The new charity thereby created became known as The Marine Society & Sea Cadets. As the UK's largest non-profit maritime organisation, the Marine Society & Sea Cadets (usually abbreviated to MSSC) is the holding brand for the two distinct organisations: the Marine Society, and the Sea Cadets. It is based in a Victorian building close to the river Thames and adjacent to Lambeth Palace in south London. The Marine Society continues as a charity involved in lifelong learning for maritime professionals.

Roll of coarse cloth 2. Cloth 3. Bath 4. Liquid material 5. Rollers 6. Oven 7. Scrapers 8. Excess liquid falls back 9. A coating remains on the fabric cloth. Dip coating is an industrial coating process which is used, for example, to manufacture bulk products such as coated fabrics and condoms and specialised coatings for example in the biomedical field. Dip coating is also commonly used in academic research, where many chemical and nano material engineering research projects use the dip coating technique to create thin-film coatings. The earliest dip-coated products may have been candles. For flexible laminar substrates such as fabrics, dip coating may be performed as a continuous roll- to-roll process. For coating a 3D object, it may simply be inserted and removed from the bath of coating. For condom-making, a former is dipped into the coating. For some products, such as early methods of making candles, the process is repeated many times, allowing a series of thin films to bulk up to a relatively thick final object. The final product may incorporate the substrate and the coating, or the coating may be peeled off to form an object which consists solely of the dried or solidified coating, as in the case of a condom. As a popular alternative to Spin coating, dip-coating methods are frequently employed to produce thin films from sol-gel precursors for research purposes, where it is generally used for applying films onto flat or cylindrical substrates. Process The dip-coating process can be separated into five stages: * Immersion: The substrate is immersed in the solution of the coating material at a constant speed (preferably jitter-free). * Start-up: The substrate has remained inside the solution for a while and is starting to be pulled up. * Deposition: The thin layer deposits itself on the substrate while it is pulled up. The withdrawing is carried out at a constant speed to avoid any jitters. The speed determines the thickness of the coating (faster withdrawal gives thicker coating material). * Drainage: Excess liquid will drain from the surface. * Evaporation: The solvent evaporates from the liquid, forming the thin layer. For volatile solvents, such as alcohols, evaporation starts already during the deposition and drainage steps. In the continuous process, the steps are carried out directly after each other. Many factors contribute to determining the final state of the dip coating of a thin film. A large variety of repeatable dip coated film structures and thicknesses can be fabricated by controlling many factors: functionality of the initial substrate surface, submersion time, withdrawal speed, number of dipping cycles, solution composition, concentration and temperature, number of solutions in each dipping sequence, and environment humidity. The dip coating technique can give uniform, high quality films even on bulky, complex shapes.  Applications in research  The dip coating technique is used for making thin films by self- assembly and with the sol-gel technique. Self-assembly can give film thicknesses of exactly one mono layer. The sol-gel technique creates films of increased, precisely controlled thickness that are mainly determined by the deposition speed and solution viscosity. As an emerging field, nano particles are often used as a coating material. Dip coating applications include: * Multilayer sensor coatings * Implant functionalist * Hydro gels * Sol-Gel nano particle coatings * Self-assembled mono layers * Layer-by-layer nano particle assemblies.  Nanoparticle coatings  Dip coating have been utilized for example in the fabrication of bioceramic nanoparticles, biosensors, implants and hybrid coatings. For example, dip coating has been used to establish a simple yet fast nonthermal coating method to immobilize hydroxyapatite and TiO2 nanoparticles on polymethyl methacrylate. In another study, porous cellulose nanocrystals and poly(vinyl alcohol) CNC/PVA nanocomposite films with a thickness of 25‚àí70 nm were deposited on glass substrates using dip coating.  Sol-gel technique  Dip coating of inorganic sols (or so-called sol-gel synthesis) is a way of creating thin inorganic or polymeric coatings. In sol-gel synthesis the speed of deposition is an important parameter that affects, for example, layer thickness, density and porosity. The sol-gel technique is a deposition method that is widely used in material science to create protective coatings, optical coatings, ceramic coatings and similar surfaces. This technique starts with the hydrolysis of a liquid precursor (sol), which undergoes poly-condensation to gradually obtain a gel. This gel is a bi-phasic system containing both a liquid phase (solvent) and a solid phase (integrated network, typically polymer network). The proportion of liquid is reduced stepwise. The rest of the liquid can be removed by drying and can be coupled with a thermal treatment to tailor the material properties of the solid.

Its main uses are surveillance and intelligence gathering, The first generation (Pegasus I) had a length of 2.1 meters, wingspan 5 m, maximum speed 160 kilometers/hour, minimum speed 75 km/h, takeoff load 130 kilograms and autonomy 3.5 hours. After initial delays in the relevant program of the Greek Air Force, ten units (including the ground station infrastructure) were produced (a number of them by KEA) to facilitate its performance optimization. By 2003 it was already operational, while in 2005 a redesigned upgrade was introduced (Pegasus II) with advanced electronics, length 4.3 m, wingspan 6.2 m, takeoff load 250 kg and autonomy 15 hrs. Four units (each one including the aircraft and ground stations and equipment) are currently operational, with 12 more under construction by KEA. Pegasus II can carry a maximum payload weight of 50 kg, and thanks to the wide use of composite materials for its construction represents a substantial improvement of the Pegasus I design. Its technical features make it suitable for surveillance, target acquisition, and damage assessment and it is evaluated as an ELINT payload carrier. Expectations for its use as a weapons carrier are limited by its relatively small payload capacity (a payload capacity of 100 kg would render it more suitable for these type of missions).

Overview Repellents generally work by taking advantage of an animal's natural aversion to something, and often the thing chosen is something that the animal has learned to avoid (or instinctively avoids) in its natural environment. For example, some animals will avoid anything that has the odor of the urine of predators. Tiger urine is thus very effective at keeping away animals. Coyote urine has gained currency as a deer repellent. Fox urine is used to repel rabbits, groundhogs, woodchucks, squirrels and chipmunks. Bobcat urine repels moles, mice, voles and other rodents. Wolf urine is used to repel moose. Used cat litter is also effective, but needs repeated application. Chemical repellents mimic natural substances that repel or deter animals, or they are designed to be so irritating to a specific animal or type of animal that the targeted animal will avoid the protected object or area. Some chemical repellents combine both principles. For example, the lawn fertilizer Milorganite is claimed to be an effective repellent due to its smell. Repellents fall into two main categories, odor and taste. Odor repellents work better in the warm seasons and taste repellents work better in the cold months. Taste repellents only work after the deer or other animal has taken a bite out of the plant. If you have a plant you don't want nibbled on at all, use an odor repellent or a combination of both. The scientists from University of Florida explain that ‚ÄúMost of these deterrents operate through one of several mechanisms: odor aversion, taste aversion, or fear inducement‚Äù.http://edis.ifas.ufl.edu/uw371 Pepper, peppermint, tarragon, garlic, various essential oils, castor oil, diatomaceous earth, and putrescent egg solids, considered to be contact plant origin repellents, operate through the first and the second mechanisms. The third type of repellent contains ingredients of animal origin, such animals' enemies urine (such as coyotes or foxes), dried blood and hair, inducing pest animals' panic, to make them flee, as confirmed by University of Massachusetts Amherst specialists. Other types of non-chemical repellents are sometimes used. A simple electrified or barbed wire fence can mechanically repel livestock or predator animals. Some electrical repellent systems have been tested against sharks. High-frequency whistles have been used on vehicles to drive deer away from highways, and similar devices have been used to deter and repel certain types of insects or rodents. Repellents for domestic cats and dogs can also be found; these include ultrasonic devices which emit a high frequency noise that does not affect humans. These types of non-chemical repellents are quite controversial because their effectiveness varies from person to person. Furthermore, there have been few scientific studies conducted to prove that they do work. They are, however, a safe and humane way of detering pests. There are also few alternative ways to repel cats and dogs which are effective, such as repellent chemical Spray, electronic pet barrier, motion activated sprinkler etc. In Addition, vinegar can be used as organic pet repellent. Flashing lights are used to repel lions in Kenya. The ideal repellent is completely specific for the target animal; that is, it drives away the animal that one wishes to repel without affecting or harming any other animals or people. One type of animal repellent may be effective for raccoons, while another animal repellent may be more effective for skunks. It can be difficult to design a repellent method that drives away only undesirable animals while having no effect on people or other creatures. Snake repellents *Research has shown that cinnamon oil, clove oil, and eugenol are effective snake repellents. Snakes will retreat when sprayed directly with these oils and will exit cargo or other confined spaces when these oils are introduced to the area. *In ancient times the Greek historian Herodotus noted that Arabian harvesters of frankincense used burning resin from Styrax trees to repel poisonous snakes that lived in the trees.Herodotus 3,107 *Camphor *Moth balls *The roots and other parts of Acacia polyacantha subsp. campylacantha emit chemical compounds that repel animals including rats, snakes and crocodiles.

Many of the Strange Company team also worked on the Boingboing- featured scientific cookery show Kamikaze Cookery, although it is not indicated as an official Strange Company production. In March 2010, Strange Company announced a high-profile project, a performance capture/Machinima hybrid title Death Knight Love Story, featuring the voices of Joanna Lumley, Jack Davenport, Anna Chancellor and Brian Blessed. Death Knight Love Story is a short romance/action adventure, and was released in 2014. In November 2017, Strange Company released the VR RPG game \\"Left-Hand Path\\" on Steam. It received \\"Very Positive\\" reviews rating on the site. On February 5, 2018, founder Hugh Hancock died of a heart attack.

This scale is just over half the length of the 34-inch scale of an ordinary bass guitar. When amplified, the Ashbory produces a low, resonant bass tone similar to the tone of a pizzicato (plucked) double bass. Comparison in size between an Ashbory Bass (blue) and a standard sized bass guitar. Features The Ashbory uses silicone rubber strings and an acoustic piezo- transducer pickup to create the instrument's tone. The lower string tension of the instrument means that no truss rod is used in the Ashbory's neck. Unlike electric basses and electric guitars, neither the bridge nor the neck is adjustable. The manufacturer recommends that the silicone strings be dusted with talc powder to make the strings easier to play. Playing styles The manufacturer recommends \\"standard electric bass 'fingerstyle' playing\\", and acknowledges that electric bass techniques such as slapping and popping and pick playing do not work as well on the Ashbory. On the other hand, the Ashbory can be used to create additional sounds. By muting the strings with the left hand and using the right hand to strike the strings, an analog synth- like sound can be created. Snapping the strings with the right hand can create an upright-bass-like slap sound.

Constructed originally by the Caledonian Railway, the station is operated today by Abellio ScotRail and is also served by one TransPennine Express trains service per day between Manchester Airport and Glasgow Central. All other services by TransPennine Express and services operated by Avanti West Coast, Caledonian Sleeper, CrossCountry and London North Eastern Railway pass the station, but do not stop.  Locale  Just south of the station, there is an important triangular junction (Carstairs Junction) where the West Coast Main Line (WCML) divides. The north-westerly route goes via Motherwell to Glasgow and the north-easterly route goes towards Edinburgh, where the East Coast Main Line begins. The southbound route goes towards and London Euston. The line between Edinburgh and Glasgow is the only part of the West Coast Main Line used by London North Eastern Railway services. Carstairs is also a marshalling point and the final boarding point (both sleeping car and overnight coach) in Scotland for the Lowland Caledonian Sleeper trains from Glasgow and Edinburgh to London Euston. Northbound (Down) WCML services usually pass the station on an avoiding line (known as the Down Main), away from the platform line (known as the Down platform), but northbound services coming off the chord from Edinburgh (LNER and CrossCountry) usually pass Platform 1: they cannot be signalled from Platform 2, . However, all southbound (Up) services pass through Platform 2 (on the Up Main), they can also be diverted through the down platform(1). The Up Main and Down Platform lines are both signalled for bi-directional working, and are often used as passing loops for passenger and freight services. For example, the early morning departure for Glasgow Central from North Berwick will wait at the Down Platform as a fast TransPennine Express service from Manchester passes. There is also the Down Passenger Loop (which is adjacent to the station) and the Up Passenger Loop (immediately to the north of the station) which are both used to stop freight services while faster passenger services pass. It is also common for northbound freights to be stopped in both the Down Platform line and Down Passenger Loop and for fast passenger services to be passed between them on the Down Main.  Electrification  Down platform and old station building in June 1983 The route through the station was electrified in the 1974 electrification scheme that covered the West Coast Main Line between Weaver Junction and . As part of this the station was re- signalled. The critical point was the connection from Edinburgh on a minimum radius curve to provide a connection into the Down platform whilst avoiding the installation of a diamond crossing. The provision of superelevation through the Up platform for 90 mph running required deep ballasting; this required the platform to be raised. The original station buildings were being retained, and continuous railings were provided to prevent passengers accidentally falling down from one level to the other. This height difference has now been removed as the original station buildings were demolished and replaced with a more modern alternative and the entire platform was levelled off. The only remnant of the original station buildings was the integral footbridge, now adapted as a stand-alone structure. The route to Edinburgh was not part of the 1970s scheme; however, it was included as part of the late 1980s ECML scheme, with electric services starting to use the line in 1989 (before the main East Coast Main Line (ECML) electric services started).  Services = Historical  Carstairs was an important junction station where northbound West Coast Main Line trains were split into separate portions for Glasgow, Edinburgh and (to a lesser extent) Stirling and Perth, and for the corresponding combining of southbound trains. However, the introduction of push-pull operation on the WCML and the availability of surplus HST sets for Cross Country traffic (as a result of the ECML electrification) largely eliminated this practice in the early 1990s. Apart from the sleeping car trains, express traffic through Carstairs now consists of fixed-formation trains which do not require to be remarshalled en route. As a result, few express trains now call at Carstairs. There were some local stopping services to Edinburgh and Glasgow, but they were relatively infrequent. Before December 2012, only two trains per day to North Berwick called, and only five trains to Glasgow (three trains went to Dalmuir and two to Central and one terminated at Motherwell). There were very large gaps in between trains with the two Edinburgh-bound trains calling at 07:49 and then again at 15:40; similarly, for the Glasgow trains there was a gap from 07:55 to 18:41.  2019  The following services call at Carstairs: On Monday to Saturdays, there is a roughly two-hourly service to both Glasgow Central and Edinburgh Waverley (with a few longer gaps) for most of the day, with a few services extended to Ayr and North Berwick; the last northbound service from Edinburgh terminates at Motherwell. There are also a few extra trains operated by ScotRail to/from Glasgow Central Low Level which call at peak times. These operate to Motherwell, Garscadden and Dalmuir. These services do not run on Saturdays, so a slightly reduced service operates from the station on Saturday mornings, In addition, TransPennine Express also provide one train per day to Glasgow Central and one train per day to Liverpool Lime Street via Preston. As of 2019, there is no Sunday service.

The aircraft was named after German aeronautical engineer Brunolf Baade, the principal designer involved in the programme. It had the distinction of being the first jet airliner to be developed in Germany. The Baade 152 represents the final development in the Junkers aircraft family which ended with the \\"development planes\\" (Entwicklungsflugzeug ‚Äì EF). Its development drew upon the OKB-1 150, an aborted bomber that was developed in the Soviet Union with assistance from captured German scientists. The Baade 152's basic configuration shares many similarities, including shape, size, wing-area, landing gear configuration, empty weight, range, altitude, speed, power per engine, and double-engine cowling arrangement with the American-built Boeing B-47 Stratojet, a bomber/aerial reconnaissance aircraft which entered service with the United States Air Force during 1951. Work on the Baade 152 formally commenced during 1955. On 4 December 1958, the maiden flight of the first prototype V1/I (DM- ZYA) took place. A total of three Baade 152s would be manufactured, two of which would participate in a test flight programme based out of Dresden Airport between 1956 and 1961. On 4 March 1959, the first prototype was lost in an accident, killing all crew on board; the cause is unclear. Testing continued using the second prototype. At one stage, there were reports that around 20 aircraft were in various stages of production on behalf of the East German state airline Deutsche Lufthansa. However, all flight tests of the Baade 152 were abandoned after a fuel supply problem was uncovered. The type failed to enter service, and production was terminated without any follow-on being produced. Design and development=Background Following the end of the Second World War in Europe, Germany was divided into West Germany and East Germany. In the East, the Soviet Union became politically dominant over the region; Soviet officials sought to obtain all possible aerospace-related material in East Germany, the engineers and scientists associated with such projects were deported to the Soviet Union.Hirschel, Prem and Madelung 2012, p. 109. During October 1946, it was announced that all East German aerospace- related projects would be transferred to the Soviet Union, while material that could not be transferred was deliberately destroyed. Following the formation of German Democratic Republic during 1949, many of the deported German scientists were allowed to return to East Germany and to practice their professions once more.Hirschel, Prem and Madelung 2012, pp. 109-110. During 1952, new aeronautical facilities were established in East Germany; initially, these were operated with a focus upon military aircraft, however, following a popular uprising during the following year, military ambitions were renounced in favour of civil aircraft. The revival of the East German aerospace industry had occurred at a faster rate than that of neighbouring West Germany.Hirschel, Prem and Madelung 2012, pp. 357-358. Development of what would become known as the Baade 152 can be traced back as early as 1953 to a team of German aeronautical engineers headed by Brunolf Baade, for whom the type is named after, working in Sawjelowo, Russia. However, when members of the team were allowed to return to East Germany, all documentation relating to the 152 had to be left behind; the Soviets retained this cache and eventually released it to East Germany after a protracted period.Hirschel, Prem and Madelung 2012, p. 358. Based in East Germany, a new aerospace company, VEB Flugzeugwerke Dresden, was able to recruit Baade and several other returning engineers, and decided to commit itself to completing development of the envisaged 152. VEB planned to develop the 152 as a four-engined commercial transport aircraft; an assembly line capable of producing up to 18 aircraft per year was to be established in Dresden to manufacture the type. As intended, the 152 would have been developed initially as a 57-seater airliner, plans were made to accommodate alternative seating layouts, such as a high-capacity 72-passenger configuration or a more spacious 42-passenger arrangement. During 1955, VEB formally commenced work on the 152, having to effectively redesign the aircraft in the process. During the previous year, work had also commenced at Berlin-based Industriewerke Ludwigsfelde (IWL) on the development of the Pirna 014 turbojet engine; it was this powerplant that would be selected for the 152.Hirschel, Prem and Madelung 2012, p. 360. According to Baade, work was hindered by a lack of optimal facilities present in East Germany. According to aviation periodical Flight International, East Germany was keen to involve Western industry in the project as well, particularly in the provision of components and materials; it was also hoped the sales of the 152 could be garnered from the west as well. Reportedly, East German officials regarded the 152 as filling a relatively unique niche upon the global airliner market, and that its nearest competitor was the French-built Sud Aviation Caravelle. Testing and termination Sketch of the two prototype variants of the 152 that flew between 1958 and 1961 A total of three airworthy prototypes were constructed; two of them being flown on three flights. The design of the first prototype was largely derived from the OKB-1 150, an early jet bomber designed by former Junkers engineers in the Soviet Union. It included a tandem landing gear and glazed nose for the navigator, which was a common feature in many Eastern Bloc aircraft. The 152's landing gear was unusual for a passenger plane in that the main gear was housed along the centerline of the fuselage with outrigger wheels in the wing-tips, similar to the better-known Boeing B-47. The tail of the airplane was tested on a VEB 14. On 4 December 1958, the maiden flight of the first prototype V1/I (DM-ZYA) took place, which lasted for 35 minutes. Tragedy struck during its second flight, the aircraft being lost in a crash at Ottendorf-Okrilla on 4 March 1959, killing the entire crew. It is believed that the pilots, having lacked experience with operating jet- propelled aircraft, may have been unfamiliar with the slow response time of such engines, contributing to a stall and subsequent crash. The reasons for the crash were never fully investigated and the results of the limited investigation were only made public in 1990. The loss has been attributed as having been a major setback to the programme and later having played a factor in its termination. Following the accident, test flights continued using the second prototype V4/II (DM-ZYB), although this aircraft did not fly until 1960.Hirschel, Prem and Madelung 2012, p. 109. It would be the first to be powered by the indigenously-developed Pirna 014 turbojet engine.Hirschel, Prem and Madelung 2012, p. 358. Other changes made on the second prototype included a different landing gear configuration, involving an unusual configuration of the main landing gear that shared the same pylon as the engines, as well as the glazed nose for the navigator being dispensed with. The third prototype, V5/II (DM-ZYC), would never be flown, being solely used for ground-based testing. The flight test programme was abruptly terminated after conducting only three flights; reportedly, a serious malfunction involving the fuel tanks, which interrupted sufficient fuel supply during a steep descent, had been discovered. The question of whether this design flaw had contributed to the crash of the first prototype remains unanswered. There were still about 20 aircraft in production for the East German state airline Deutsche Lufthansa until mid-1961. On 28 February 1961, the East German government issued an order for the dissolution of its national aeronautical industry; this decision was reportedly heavily influenced by the Soviet Union, which was then promoting its own similar-sized airliner, the Tupolev Tu-124; despite earlier promises, it no longer wanted to purchase any Baade 152s or provide further support towards its development. Similar curtailing of autonomous aviation- related programmes was carried out throughout the Eastern Bloc during this period.Hirschel, Prem and Madelung 2012, pp. 109, 359-360. All examples of the aircraft were scrapped. However, during 1995, a restoration effort involving the abandoned 152/II #011 fuselage was initiated at EADS EFW (Elbe Flugzeugwerke GmbH) in Dresden, which is the direct successor company of VEB Flugzeugwerke Dresden. Furthermore, one consequence of the project's cancellation was that engine manufacturer Industriewerke Ludwigsfelde (IWL) was left with 30 completed Pirna 014 powerplants without any customer for them.Kirchberg 2000, p. 439. These surplus engines were subsequently used to power a number of minesweepers operated by the Volksmarine.

Vithoba Temple, Pandharpur is his main temple. Vithoba legends revolve around his devotee Pundalik who is credited for bringing the deity to Pandharpur, and around Vithoba's role as a saviour to the poet-saints of the Varkari faith. The Varkari poet-saints are known for their unique genre of devotional lyric, the abhang, dedicated to Vithoba and composed in Marathi. Other devotional literature dedicated to Vithoba includes the Kannada hymns of the Haridasa and the Marathi versions of the generic aarti songs associated with rituals of offering light to the deity. The most important festivals of Vithoba are held on Devshayani Ekadashi in the month of Ashadha, and Prabodhini Ekadashi in the month of Kartik. The historiography of Vithoba and his cult is an area of continuing debate, even regarding his name. Various Indologists have proposed a prehistory for Vithoba worship where he was previously: a hero stone, a pastoral deity, a manifestation of Shiva, a Jain saint, or even all of these at various times for various devotees. Though the origins of both his cult and his main temple are likewise debated, there is clear evidence that they already existed by the 13th century.  Etymology and other names  A 1922 photograph of the Vithoba icon in Pandharpur adorned with jewellery and clothes. Vithoba (, ) is known by many names, including: Vitthala, Panduranga, Pandharinath, Hari and Narayan. There are several theories about the origins and meanings of these names. Varkari tradition suggests that the name Vitthala (also spelled as Vitthal, Viththal, Vittala and Vithal; , '; , and ; ) is composed of two Sanskrit-Marathi words: ', which means 'brick'; and thal, which may have originated from the Sanskrit sthala, meaning 'standing'. Thus, Vitthala would mean 'one standing on a brick'.Novetzke (2005) pp. 115‚Äì16 William Crooke, orientalist, supported this explanation.Crooke (2003) pp. 607‚Äì08 The prescribed iconography of Vithoba stipulates that he be shown standing arms-akimbo upon a brick, which is associated with the legend of the devotee Pundalik. However, the Varkari Tukaram proposed a different etymology‚Äîthat Vitthala is composed of the words vittha (ignorance) and la (one who accepts), thus meaning 'one who accepts innocent people who are devoid of knowledge'.Pande (2008) p. 449 Historian Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar offers yet another possibility‚Äîthat Vitthu () is a Kannada corruption of the name Vishnu adopted in Marathi. The suffixes -la and -ba (meaning 'father' in Marathi) were appended for reverence, producing the names Vitthala and Vithoba.Bhandarkar (1995) p. 124 This corruption of Vishnu to Vitthu could have been due to the tendency of Marathi and Kannada people to pronounce the Sanskrit ' () as ' (), attested since the 8th century.Tagare in Mahipati: Abbott, Godbole (1988) p. xxxvi According to research scholar M. S. Mate of the Deccan College, Pundalik‚Äîwho is assumed to be a historical figure‚Äîwas instrumental in persuading the Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana alias Bittidev to build the Pandharpur temple dedicated to Vishnu. The deity was subsequently named as Vitthala, a derivative of Bittidev, by the builder- king.Sand (1990) p. 38 Other variants of the name include (King Vitthala), and (Mother Vitthala). The people of Gujarat add the suffix -nath (Lord) to Vitthala, which yields the name Vitthal-nath. The additional honorific suffix -ji may be added, giving the name Vitthalnathji. This name is generally used in the Pushtimarg sect. Panduranga (, , ; all ), also spelt as Pandurang and Pandaranga, is another popular epithet for Vithoba, which means 'the white god' in Sanskrit. The Jain author-saint Hemachandra (1089‚Äì1172 AD) notes it is also used as an epithet for the god Rudra-Shiva. Even though Vithoba is depicted with dark complexion, he is called a \\"white god\\". Bhandarkar explains this paradox, proposing that Panduranga may be an epithet for the form of Shiva worshipped in Pandharpur, and whose temple still stands. Later, with the increasing popularity of Vithoba's cult, this was also transferred to Vithoba.Bhandarkar (1995) p. 125 Another theory suggests that Vithoba may initially have been a Shaiva god (related to Shiva), only later identified with Vishnu, thus explaining the usage of Panduranga for Vithoba.Eaton (2005) pp. 139‚Äì40 Crooke, however, proposed that Panduranga is a Sanskritised form of Pandaraga (belonging to Pandarga), referring to the old name of Pandharpur. Another name, Pandharinath, also refers to Vithoba as the lord of Pandhari (yet another variant for Pandharpur). Finally, Vithoba is also addressed by the names of Vishnu like Hari and Narayana, in the Vaishnava sect.Zelliot (1988) p. 170  Origins and development  Reconstruction of the historical development of Vithoba worship has been much debated. In particular, several alternative theories have been proposed regarding the earliest stages as well as the point at which he came to be recognised as a distinct deity. The Pandurangashtakam stotra, a hymn attributed to Adi Shankaracharya of the 8th century, indicates that Vithoba worship have already existed at an early date.Pande (2008) p. 508 According to Richard Maxwell Eaton, author of A Social History of the Deccan, Vithoba was first worshiped as a pastoral god as early as the 6th century. Vithoba's arms-akimbo iconography is similar to Bir Kuar, the cattle-god of the Ahirs of Bihar, who is now also associated with Krishna.For Bir Kuar, Tagare in Mahipati: Abbott, Godbole (1988) p. xxxiv Vithoba was probably later assimilated into the Shaiva pantheon and identified with the god Shiva, like most other pastoral gods. This is backed by the facts that the temple at Pandharpur is surrounded by Shaiva temples (most notably of the devotee Pundalik himself), and that Vithoba is crowned with the Linga, symbol of Shiva. However, since the 13th century, the poet-saints like Namdev, Eknath and Tukaram identified Vithoba with Vishnu. Christian Lee Novetzke of the University of Washington suggests that Vithoba's worship migrated from Karnataka to the formerly Shaiva city of Pandharpur some time before 1000 CE; but under the possible influence of a Krishna-worshipping Mahanubhava sect, the town was transformed into a Vaishnava center of pilgrimage. This proposal is consistent with contemporary remnants of Shaiva worship in the town.Novetzke (2005) p. 116 Pundalik's temple at Pandharpur The religious historian R.C. Dhere, winner of the Sahitya Akademi Award for his book Sri Vitthal: Ek Mahasamanvaya, opines that Vithoba worship may be even older‚Äî\\"Vedic or pre-Vedic\\", hence pre-dating the worship of Krishna.Dhere p. 62 According to this theory, the rise of the Yadava dynasty, which had cowherd ancestry, could have led to the glorification of Vithoba as Krishna, who is often depicted as a cowherd. This Vaishnavization of Vithoba also led to conversion of the Shaiva Pundarika shrine to the Vaishnava shrine of the devotee Pundalik, who‚Äîaccording to legend‚Äîbrought Vithoba to Pandharpur.Sand (1990) p. 40 There may have been an attempt to assimilate Vithoba into Buddhism; today, both are viewed as a form of Vishnu in Hinduism.Kelkar (2001) p. 4179 Vithoba is associated more with \\"compassion, an infinite love and tenderness for his bhaktas (devotees) that can be compared to the love of the mother for her children pining for the presence of his devotees the way a cow pines for her far-away calf.\\"Vaudeville (1987) pp. 223‚Äì24 G. A. Deleury, author of The cult of Vithoba, proposes that the image of Vithoba is a viragal (hero stone), which was later identified with Vishnu in his form as Krishna, and that Pundalik transformed the Puranic, ritualistic puja worship into more idealised bhakti worship‚Äî\\"interiorized adoration prescinding caste distinction and institutional priesthood ..\\"Deleury as quoted in Sand (1990) p. 38 Indologist Dr. Tilak suggests that Vithoba emerged as \\"an alternative to the existing pantheon\\" of brahminical deities (related to classical, ritualistic Hinduism). The emergence of Vithoba was concurrent with the rise of a \\"new type of lay devotee\\", the Varkari. While Vishnu and Shiva were bound in rigid ritualistic worship and Brahmin (priestly) control, Vithoba, \\"the God of the subaltern, became increasingly human.\\" Vithoba is often praised as the protector of the poor and needy.Tilak (2006) pp. 243‚Äì46 Stevenson (1843) suggests that Vithoba could have been a Jain saint, as the Vithoba images were similar to Jain images.Stevenson (1843) pp. 5‚Äì6 \\"The want of suitable costume in the images (of Vithoba and Rakhumai) as originally carved, in this agreeing exactly with images the Jains at present worship.\\"  Pandharpur temple and inscriptions  shikhara of the Vithoba's chief temple at Pandharpur Scholastic investigation of Vithoba's history often begins with consideration of the dating of the chief temple at Pandharpur, which is believed to be the earliest Vithoba temple. Karve (1968) pp. 188‚Äì89 The oldest part of the temple dates to the Yadava period of the 12th and 13th centuries. Most of the temple is believed to have been built in the 17th century, though addition to the temple has never ceased.Zelliot, Eleanor in Mokashi (1987) p. 35 The date the temple was first established is unclear to Bhandarkar, but he insists there is clear evidence to suggest it existed by the 13th century. According to S. G. Tulpule, the temple stood as early as 1189. In fact, a monument dated 1189 records establishment of a small Vithoba shrine at the present location of the temple; thus, Tulpule concludes, the worship of Vithoba predates 1189.Shima (1988) p. 184 A stone inscription dated 1237, found on an overhead beam of the present Vithoba temple, mentions that the Hoysala king Someshvara donated a village for the expense of the bhoga (food offering) for \\"Vitthala\\".Gokhale (1985) pp. 42‚Äì52 An inscription on a copper plate, dated 1249, records the Yadava king Krishna granting to one of his generals the village Paundrikakshetra (kshetra of Pundarik), on the river Bhimarathi, in the presence of the god Vishnu. Another stone inscription in Pandharpur narrates a sacrifice at Pandurangapura due to which \\"people and Vitthal along with the gods were gratified\\". Thus from the 13th century, the city is known as the city of Panduranga. Inside the temple, a stone inscription records gifts to the temple between 1272 and 1277 from various donors, notably the Yadava king Ramachandra's minister Hemadri. Ranade believes that an inscription, found in Alandi and referring to Vitthala and Rakhumai, is the oldest related to Vithoba, and dates it to 1209.Ranade (1933) p. 183 However, the name Pandaranga is found on a Rashtrakuta copper plate inscription, dated 516. Citing this, Pande infers that Vithoba's cult was well established by the 6th century.Pande (2008) pp. 449, 508  Central image  An arms-akimbo Vishnu from Udaygiri Caves. The physical characteristics of the central murti (image) of Vithoba at Pandharpur, and various textual references to it, have inspired theories relating to Vithoba worship. Sand concludes, from a version of Pundalik's legend in the Skanda Purana (see Legend below), that two distinct murtis must have existed at Pandharpur‚Äîone each of tirtha and kshetra type. The earlier one was a tirtha murti, an image purposely sited near a holy body of water (tirtha), in this case facing west, on the Bhima riverbed, near the Pundalik shrine. The later murti, according to Sand, was a kshetra murti, located at a place of holy power (kshetra), in this case facing east, on the hill where the current temple has stood since about 1189. Thus, Sand proposes that the worship of Vithoba may predate the temple itself.Sand (1990) pp. 43, 58 Deleury suggests that although the temple may have been built in the 13th century, given the Hemadpanthi style architecture, the statue of Vithoba is of an earlier style so may have been carved for an earlier, smaller shrine that existed in Pandharpur. The workmanship of the image is earlier than the style of the Yadava (1175‚Äì1318), the Anhivad Chalukya (943‚Äì1210) and even the Ajmer Chohans (685‚Äì1193) eras. Although no other existing Vishnu temple has iconography like Pandharpur's Vithoba, Deleury finds similarities between the Pandharpur image and the third-century, arms-akimbo Vishnu images at Udaygiri Caves, Madhya Pradesh but declares that they are from different schools of sculpture.  Pundalik  The devotee Pundalik, thrower of the brick (see Legend below), is a major character in the legends of Vithoba. He is commonly perceived to be a historical figure, connected with the establishment and propagation of the Vithoba-centric Varkari sect.Sand (1990) p. 35 Ramakrishna Gopal Bhandarkar considers Pundalik to be the founder of the Varkari sect and the one who promulgated the sect in Maratha country.Bhandarkar (1995) pp. 125‚Äì26 Stevenson (1843) goes further, suggesting he might have been a Jain or a Buddhist, since Varkari tradition is a combination of Jain and Buddhist morals, and Vithoba is viewed as Vishnu in his form as Buddha.Stevenson (1843) p. 66 Frazer, Edwards and P.R. Bhandarkar (1922) all suggest that Pundalik tried to unify Shiva and Vishnu, and that this sect originated in Karnataka.Sand (1990) p. 37 Ranade (1933) thinks that Pundalik, a Kannada saint, was not only the founder of the Varkari sect but also the first great devotee or first high priest of the Pandharpur temple.Ranade (1933) pp. 183‚Äì84 Upadhyaya supports the priest theory but declines the Kannada origin theory. According to M. S. Mate, Pundalik was instrumental in coaxing the Hoysala king Vishnuvardhana to build the Pandharpur temple to Vishnu, placing him in the early 12th century. Other scholars like Raeside (1965), Dhanpalvar (1972), and Vaudeville (1974) have questioned the historicity of Pundalik altogether, and dismissed him as a mythical figure.Sand (1990) pp. 39‚Äì40  Identifications  Dashavatar‚Äîten avatars (of Vishnu)‚Äîon the door of Sree Balaji Temple, Goa. Primarily, there are three Hindu deities associated with Vithoba: Vishnu, Krishna and Shiva. Gautama Buddha is also associated with Vithoba, consistent with Hindu deification of the Buddha as the ninth incarnation of Vishnu. However, Varkari consider Vithoba to be the svarup (original) Vishnu himself, not an Avatar (manifestation) of Vishnu like Krishna,Zelliot, Eleanor in Mokashi (1987) p. 37 despite legends and consorts linking Vithoba to Krishna. However, even the Mahanubhavas, who rose in the 13th century as a Krishna-worshipping sect, not only dismissed the notion that Vithoba is Krishna but also frequently vilified Vithoba.Novetzke p. 117 In some traditions though, Vithoba is also worshipped as a form of Shiva. The Dhangars still consider Vithoba to be a brother of the god Viroba, and view Vithoba as a Shaiva god rather than a Vaishnava one.Zelliot (1988) p. 114 Underhill proposes that the shrine of Pandharpur is a combined form of Vishnu-Shiva established by the Bhagavata sect that worships Vishnu-Shiva‚Äîthe Lord, which is what bhagavata means.Underhill (1991) p. 171 However, for the chief priests of the Pandharpur temple‚ÄîBrahmins of the Badva family ‚Äî\\" is neither nor . is \\" (IAST original).Raeside, I. M. P. (1965) p. 82. Cited in Sand (1990) p. 33 Despite this, some priests of the temple point to marks on the Vithoba image's chest as proof of Vithoba being Vishnu, in his form as Krishna. Vithoba's image replaces the traditional representation of Buddha, when depicted as the ninth avatar of Vishnu, in some temple sculptures and Hindu astrological almanacs in Maharashtra. In the 17th century, Maratha artists sculpted an image of Pandharpur's Vithoba in the Buddha's place on a panel showing Vishnu's avatars. This can be found in the Shivneri Caves. Stevenson goes so far as to call devotees of Vithoba (Vithal-bhaktas) Buddhist Vaishnavas (Bauddho-Vaishnavas), since they consider Vithoba to be the ninth‚Äînamely Buddha‚Äîavatar of Vishnu.Stevenson (1843) p. 64 Some of the poet-saints praised Vithoba as a form of Buddha.Tagare in Mahipati: Abbott, Godbole (1988) p. xxxiv B. R. Ambedkar, an Indian political leader and Buddhist convert, suggested that the image of Vithoba at Pandharpur was in reality the image of the Buddha.Keer (2005) p. 482  Iconography  This bronze image from a home shrine inherits the traditional attributes of Vithoba's Pandharpur image like the conical headgear, the fish shaped earrings, the gem stubbed necklace, and the brick. This image shows Vithoba's right hand making a blessing gesture and his left hand holding a shankha. All Vithoba images are generally modelled on his central image in Pandharpur. The Pandharpur image is a black basalt sculpture that is tall. Vithoba is depicted as dark young boy. The poet-saints have called him \\"Para-brahman with a dark complexion\\". He wears high, conical headgear or a crown, interpreted as Shiva's symbol‚Äîthe Linga. Thus, according to Zelliot, Vithoba represents Shiva as well as Vishnu.Zelliot, Eleanor in Mokashi (1987) pp. 35‚Äì36 The first Varkari poet-saint, Dnyaneshwar (13th century), states that Vithoba (Vishnu) carries Shiva, who according to Vaishnavism is Vishnu's first and foremost devotee, on his own head.Ranade (1933) p. 41 Vithoba is shown standing arms-akimbo on the brick thrown by the devotee Pundalik. He wears a necklace of tulsi-beads, embedded with the legendary kaustubha gem, and makara-kundala (fish-shaped earrings) that the poet-saint Tukaram relates to the iconography of Vishnu. Pandharpur's Vithoba holds a shankha (conch) in his left hand and a chakra (discus) or lotus flower in his right, all of which are symbols traditionally associated with Vishnu. Some images depict Vithoba's right hand making a gesture that has been traditionally misunderstood as a blessing; no gesture of blessing is present in the Pandharpur image. Though usually depicted two-armed, four-armed representations of the deity also exist. The Pandharpur image, when not clothed by its attendant priest to receive devotees, provides Vithoba with the detailed features distinctive of a male body, visible in full relief. However, close inspection of the stonework reveals the outline of a loincloth, supported by a kambarband (waist belt), traced by thin, light carvings. Other images and pictures depict Vithoba clothed, usually with pitambara ‚Äì a yellow dhoti and various gold ornaments‚Äîthe manner in which he is attired by the priests in the daily rites. The Pandharpur image also bears, on the left breast, the mark known as the srivatsalanchhana‚Äîsaid to be a curl of white hair, usually found on the breast of Vishnu and Krishna images. The image is also dignified with a ring-shaped mark called shriniketana on the right breast, mekhala (a three-stringed waist-belt), a long stick (kathi) embedded in the ground between the legs, and double ring and pearl bracelets on the elbows.  Consorts  Sion Vitthal temple, Mumbai, decorated with jewellery during the Hindu festival of Diwali Vithoba is usually depicted with his main consort, Rakhumai, on his left side. Rakhumai (or Rakhamai) literally means 'mother Rukmini'. Rukmini is traditionally viewed as the wife of Krishna. Hindus generally consider Krishna to be a form of Vishnu, hence his consort as a form of Lakshmi. Just like her consort, Rakhumai is also depicted in the arms-akimbo posture, standing on a brick. She has an independent cella in the Pandharpur temple complex. According to Ghurye, Rukmini‚Äîa princess of the Vidarbha region of Maharashtra. According to Dhangar tradition, Rukhumai is worshipped by the community as Padmavati or Padubai, a protector of the community and cattle in particular. 447 Apart from Rakhumai, two other consorts Satyabhama and Rahi (derived from Radha) are worshipped too. All three consorts are regarded as Krishna's in Hindu mythology.Pillai (1997) pp. 366‚Äì67  Worship  Vithoba is a popular deity in Maharashtra; devotees also exist in Goa but not in the same numbers. Vithoba is worshipped and revered by most Marathis, but he is not popular as a kuldevta (family deity).Karve (1968) p. 183 The main temple of Vithoba, which includes a distinct, additional shrine for his consort Rakhumai, is located at Pandharpur. In this context, Pandharpur is affectionately called \\"Bhu-Vaikuntha\\" (the place of residence of Vishnu on earth) by devotees.Tagare in Mahipati: Abbott, Godbole (1987) p. xxxv Devotees, from across Maharashtra, Karnataka and Telangana, have visited Vithoba's central temple at Pandharpur, since the times of Dnyaneshwar (13th century). Two distinct traditions revolve around the worship of Vithoba in Maharashtra: ritual worship inside the temple by the Brahmin priests of the Badva family; and spiritual worship by the Varkaris.Engblom, Philip C. in Mokashi (1987) pp. 7‚Äì10, 15 The ritual worship includes five daily rites. First, at about 3 am, is an arati to awaken the god, called . Next comes the , a puja that includes a bath with five (pancha) sweet substances called panchamrita. The image is then dressed to receive morning devotions. The third rite is another puja involving re-dressing and lunch at noon. This is known as . Afternoon devotions are followed by a fourth rite for dinner at sunset‚Äîthe . The final rite is , an arati for putting the god to sleep.Shima (1988) p. 188 In addition to the rites at the main temple in Pandharpur, Haridasa traditions dedicated to Vitthala flourish in Karnataka.  Varkari sect  The Varkari Panth (Pilgrim Path) or Varkari Sampradaya (Pilgrim Tradition) is one of the most important Vaishnava sects in India.Flood (1996) p. 135 According to Raeside, it is an essentially monotheistic, bhakti sect, focused on the worship of Vithoba and based on traditional Bhagavata dharma. The sect is a \\"Shaiva-Vaishnava synthesis\\" and \\"nominal Vaishnavism, containing a free mix of other religions\\". It is believed to have originated in Karnataka and migrated to Maharashtra. This last theory is based on a reference to Vithoba as \\"Kannada\\" (belonging to Karnataka) in the work of the first of the poet- saints, Dnyaneshwar.Researchers debate whether Vitthala is a Karnataki or Kannada deity rather than a Marathi deity. Jnaneshwar says: ‚Äòkanada ho vitthalu karnataku, yene maja lavile vedhi; this Vitthala who is kanada (difficult to understand) and karnataku (from Karnataka, or kara nataku, playful) has put me in the state of constant remembrance.‚Äô Saints like Eknath and Namdev have also referred to him as kanada vitthala. However, this word can also be interpreted as \\"difficult to understand\\". Varkaris and scholars who believe Pundalik to have been a historical figure also consider him to be founder of the cult of Vithoba. This is evidenced by the liturgical call‚ÄîPundalikavarada Hari Vitthala!‚Äîwhich means \\"O Hari Vitthala (Vithoba), who has given a boon to Pundalik!\\"anon. (1987) pp. 966‚Äì68 However, according to Zelliot, the sect was founded by Dnyaneshwar (also spelled Jnaneshwar), who was a Brahmin poet and philosopher and flourished during the period 1275‚Äì1296.Zelliot, Eleanor in Mokashi (1990) p. 38 Varkaris also give him credit with the saying‚ÄîDnyanadev rachila paya‚Äîwhich means \\"Dnyaneshwar laid the foundation stone\\".Pawar p. 350 A Varkari journeys from Alandi to Pandharpur. He carries a veena (lute) with saffron flag attached, and cymbals tied to strings in his hands. Namdev (c. 1270‚Äì1350), a Shudra tailor, wrote short Marathi devotional poems in praise of Vithoba called abhangas (literally 'unbroken'), and used the call-and-response kirtan (literally 'repeating') form of singing to praise the glory of his Lord. Public performance of this musical devotion led to the spread of the Vithoba faith, which accepted \\"untouchables\\", something forbidden in classical brahminical Hinduism. In the times of Muslim rulers, the faith faced stagnation. However, after the decline of the Vijayanagara empire, when wars erupted in the Deccan region, the Muslim rulers had to accept the faiths of Maharashtra in order to gather the support of its people. In this period, Eknath (c. 1533‚Äì99) revived the Varkari tradition. With the foundation of the Maratha empire under Shivaji, Tukaram (c. 1568‚Äì1650), a Shudra grocer, further propagated the Vithoba-centric tradition throughout the Maharashtra region.Shima (1988) pp. 184‚Äì86 All these poet-saints, and others like Janabai, the maidservant of Namdev, wrote poetry dedicated to Vithoba. This Marathi poetry advocates pure devotion, referring to Vithoba mostly as a father, or in the case of the female saint Janabai's poetry, as a mother (Vithabai).Flood (1996) pp. 142‚Äì44 Not only women, like Janabai, but also a wide variety of people from different castes and backgrounds wrote abhangas in praise of Vithoba: Visoba Khechara (who was an orthodox Shaiva and teacher of Namdev), Sena the barber, Narhari the goldsmith, Savata the gardener, Gora the potter, Kanhopatra the dancing girl, Chokhamela the \\"untouchable\\" Mahar, and even the Muslim Sheikh Muhammad (1560‚Äì1650).Zelliot, Eleanor in Mokashi (1987) p. 40see Pawar pp. 350‚Äì62 for a review of Varkari literature Anyone born Shaiva or Vaishnava who considers Vithoba his maya-baap (mother-father) and Pandharpur his maher (maternal house of a bride) is accepted as a Varkari by the sect irrespective of the barriers of caste. Varkaris often practice Vithoba japa (meditative repetition of a divine name), and observe a fast on the ekadashi of each month.Tagare in Mahipati: Abbott, Godbole (1988) p. xxxvii  Haridasa sect  The Vitthala temple in Hampi, Karnataka, was built by Krishnadevaraya, whose guru Vyasatirtha was a key Haridasa figure. Haridasa means servant (dasa) of Vishnu (Hari). According to Haridasa tradition, their sampradaya, also known as Haridasa-kuta, was founded by Achalananda Vitthala (c. 888). It is a distinct branch within Vaishnavism, centered on Vitthala (the Haridasa‚ÄìKannada name for Vithoba).Flood (2003) pp. 252‚Äì53 Where Varkari are normally associated with Maharashtra, Haridasa are normally associated with Karnataka. The scholar Sharma considers Vithoba worship first emerged in Karnataka, only later moving to Maharashtra. He argues this on the basis of the reference by Dnyaneshwar, mentioned in section \\"Varkari sect\\" above.Sharma (2000) pp. 514‚Äì16 Lutgendorf credits the movement to Vyasatirtha (1478‚Äì1539), the royal guru (rajguru) to king Krishnadevaraya of the Vijayanagara empire. Vitthala enjoyed royal patronage in this era. Krishnadevaraya is also credited with building Vitthala's temple at the then capital city Vijayanagara (modern Hampi).Lutgendorf (2007) pp. 69, 70, 72 Haridasas consider the temple of Pandharpur to be sacred, as well that of Hampi, and worship Vitthala along with forms of Krishna.Rao (1966) pp. 7‚Äì8 Haridasa literature generally deals with praise dedicated to Vitthala and Krishna. Haridasa poets like Vijaya Vitthala, Gopala Vitthala, Jagannatha Vitthala, Venugopala Vitthala and Mohana Vitthala assumed pen-names ending with \\"Vitthala\\", as an act of devotion.Rao (1966) p. 28 The Haridasa poet Purandara Dasa or Purandara Vitthala (1484‚Äì1564), \\"father of Carnatic music\\", often ended his Kannada language compositions with a salutation to Vitthala.Iyer (2006) p. 93Kiehnle (1997) p. 39  Pushtimarg sect  The founder of the Hindu sect Pushtimarg ‚Äì Vallabhacharya (1479‚Äì1531) is believed to have visited Pandharpur at least twice and was ordered to marry by Vithoba (called Vitthalnath or Vitthalnathji in the sect) and have children so that he could be born as Vallabhacharya's son. Later, Vallabhacharya married. His second son and successor was recognized as a manifestation of Vithoba and named Vitthalnath, also known as Gusainji.  Festivals  Dnyaneshwar's palkhi (palanquin), holding the footwear of the saint, is carried with honour in a silver bullock cart from Alandi to Pandharpur. The festivals associated with Vithoba primarily correspond to the bi-annual yatras (pilgrimages) of the Varkaris. The pilgrims travel to the Pandharpur temple from Alandi and Dehu, towns closely associated with poet-saints Dnyaneshwar and Tukaram respectively. Along the way, they sing abhangas (devotional songs) dedicated to Vithoba and repeat his name, carrying the palkhis (palanquins) of the poet-saints. Varkaris do not engage in ritual worship but only practice darshan (visual adoration) of the deity. The ritual worship by the priests is restricted to five days each around the Ashadha (June‚ÄìJuly) and Kartik (October‚ÄìNovember) Ekadashis, when a large number of Varkaris participate in the yatras. In smaller numbers, the Varkaris also visit the temple on two other Ekadashis‚Äîin the Hindu months of Magha and Chaitra. More than 800,000 Varkaris travel to Pandharpur for the yatra on Shayani Ekadashi, the 11th day of the waxing moon in the lunar month of Ashadha.Each of the 12 Hindu months‚Äîsuch as Ashadha, Chaitra, Magha, and Kartik‚Äîis divided into two fortnights of 15 days each. The moon waxes over the bright fortnight (Shukla Paksha), from day 1 to day 15 (full moon day); and it wanes over the following dark fortnight (Krishna Paksha) until new moon day.Engblom, Philip C. in Mokashi (1987) p. 2 Both Shayani Ekadashi and Prabodhini Ekadashi (in the waxing half of Kartik), are associated with the mythology of Vishnu. Hindus believe that Vishnu falls asleep in Ksheersagar (a cosmic ocean of milk), while lying on the back of Shesha-nƒÅga (the cosmic serpent). His sleep begins on Shayani Ekadashi (literally the 'sleeping 11th') and he finally awakens from his slumber, four months later, on Prabodhini Ekadashi. The celebrations in Ashadha and Kartik continue until the full-moon in those months, concluding with torchlight processions. Inscriptions dating to the 11th century mention the Ekadashi pilgrimages to Pandharpur. On Shayani Ekadashi and Prabodini Ekadashi, the chief minister or a minister of Maharashtra state performs ritual components of worship on behalf of the Government of Maharashtra. This form of worship is known as sarkari-mahapuja. Apart from the four Ekadashis, a fair is held on Dussera night at Pandharpur, when devotees dance on a large slab (ranga-shila) before Vithoba, accompanied with torchlight processions. Other observances at the Pandharpur temple include: Ranga-Panchami, when gulal (red powder) is sprinkled on the god's feet; and Krishna Janmashtami, Krishna's birthday, when devotees dance and sing in front of Vithoba for nine days.Shima (1988) p. 189 Other sacred days include Wednesdays, Saturdays and all other Ekadashis, all of which are considered holy in Vaishnavism.  Devotional works  A four-armed Vithoba, a 19th-century painting from Tiruchchirappalli, Tamil Nadu. Here, Vithoba is depicted as an arms-akimbo Vishnu. Devotional works dedicated to Vithoba can be categorised into the Varkari tradition, the Brahmin tradition and what Raeside calls a \\"third tradition\\", that includes both Varkari and Brahmin elements. The Varkari texts are written in Marathi, the Brahmin texts in Sanskrit, and the \\"third tradition\\" are Marathi texts written by Brahmins. The Varkari texts are: Bhaktalilamrita and Bhaktavijaya by Mahipati, Pundalika- Mahatmya by Bahinabai, and a long abhanga by Namdev. All these texts describe the legend of Pundalik. The Brahmin texts include: two versions of Panduranga- Mahatmya from the Skanda Purana (consisting of 900 verses); Panduranga- Mahatmya from the Padma Purana (consisting of 1,200 verses); Bhima-Mahatmya, also from the Padma Purana; and a third devotional work, yet again called Panduranga-Mahatmya, which is found in the Vishnu Purana.Sand (1990) p. 56Sand (1990) p. 33For the complete English translation of Bhaktavijaya, which narrates the legend of Pundalik and also tells stories of reported interactions between the saints and Vithoba, see Stories of Indian Saints (1988) by Mahƒ´pati, Justin Edwards Abbott, and Narhar R. Godbole. The \\"third tradition\\" is found in two works: Panduranga-Mahatmya by the Brahmin Sridhara (consisting of 750 verses), and another work of the same name written by Prahlada Maharaj (consisting of 181 verses).Sand (1990) p. 34For a complete Marathi text and English translation of Panduranga-Mahatmya by Sridhara see Raeside (1965) pp. 81‚Äì100 In addition to the above, there are many abhangas, the short Marathi devotional poems of the Varkaris, and many stutis (songs of praise) and stotras (hymns), some of them originating from the Haridasa tradition. The best known of these is \\"Pandurangastaka\\" or \\"Pandurangastrotra\\", attributed to Adi Shankaracharya, although this attribution is questioned. A text called \\"Tirthavali-Gatha\\", attributed to Namdev or Dnyaneshwar but possibly a collection of writings of many poet- saints, also centers on the propagation of Varkari faith and Vithoba worship.Novetzke (2005) p. 120 Other devotional works include aratis like \\"Yuge atthavisa vitevari ubha\\" by Namdev and \\"Yei O Vitthala maje mauli re\\". These aratis sing of Vithoba, who wears yellow garments (a characteristic of Vishnu) and is served by Garuda (mount of Vishnu) and Hanuman (the monkey god, devotee of Rama‚Äîan avatar of Vishnu). Finally, the Telugu poet Tenali Ramakrishna (16th century) refers to Vithoba, as Panduranga, in his poem Panduranga-Mahatmyamu: \\"(O Parvati), accepting the services of Pundarika and Kshetrapala (Kala-bhairava), becoming the wish fulfilling tree by assuming a subtle body for the sake of devotees, fulfilling their wishes, the deity Panduranga resides in that temple.\\"Pande (2008) p. 448  Temples  The chief gate of Vithoba's Pandharpur temple. The first step of the temple is regarded as saint Namdev's memorial and the small blue temple in front of the gate is saint Chokhamela's memorial. There are many Vithoba temples in Maharashtra,Singh (2004) p. 13 and some in Karnataka, Tamil Nadu, Gujarat, Goa and Andhra Pradesh. However, the main centre of worship is Vithoba's temple in Pandharpur. The temple's date of establishment is disputed, though it is clear that it was standing at the time of Dnyaneshwar in the 13th century. Along with Vithoba and his consorts‚ÄîRukmini, Satyabhama and Radha‚Äîother Vaishnava deities are worshipped. These include: Venkateshwara, a form of Vishnu; Mahalakshmi, a form of Vishnu's consort Lakshmi; Garuda and Hanuman (see previous section). Shaiva deities are also worshipped, such as: Ganesha, the elephant-headed god of wisdom and beginnings; Khandoba, a form of Shiva; and Annapurna, a form of Shiva's consort Parvati. The samadhis (memorials) of saints like Namdev, Chokhamela and Janabai, and of devotees such as Pundalik and Kanhopatra, are in and around the temple.Shima (1988) pp. 189‚Äì96Pande (2008) pp. 445‚Äì48 Other significant temples in Maharashtra are located: at Dehu, the birthplace of Tukaram, which attracts visitors at all ekadashis of the year; at Kole (Satara district), in memory of Ghadge Bova, which has a fair on the fifth day of the bright fortnight (waxing moon) in Magha month; at Kolhapur and Rajapur, which host fairs on Shayani Ekadashi and Prabodini Ekadashi;Underhill (1991) pp. 165‚Äì66, 172 Madhe ‚Äî a refuge of the Pandharpur image when it was moved to protect from Muslim invaders and finally at the Birla Mandir in Shahad. Several temples are found in Goa, the well-known ones being the temples at Sanquelim, Sanguem and Gokarna Math. Similarly temple festivals celebrated in Vitthala temples in Margao, Ponda attract a lot a pilgrims. Vitthal is also worshipped as Vitthalnath at the Nathdwara in Rajasthan. Thennangur temple, Tamil Nadu Vithoba was introduced to South India during the Vijayanagara and Maratha rule.T. Padmaja (2002) pp. 92, 108, 121‚Äì22, fig 87 In South India he is generally known as Vitthala. The Hampi temple (mentioned above) is a World Heritage site and the most important of Vitthala's temples outside Maharashtra. Constructed in the 15th century, the temple is believed to have housed the central image from Pandharpur, which the Vijayanagara king Krishnadevaraya took \\"to enhance his own status\\" or to save the image from plunder by Muslim invaders. It was later returned to Pandharpur by Bhanudas (1448‚Äì1513), the great-grandfather of poet-saint Eknath. Today, the temple stands without a central image,Eleanor Zelliot in Mokashi (1987) p. 42Ranade (1933) p. 213 though between 1516 and 1565, most important transactions, which would have been carried out previously in the presence of the original state deity Virupaksha (a form of Shiva), were issued in presence of the central image of Vitthala.Eaton (2005) p. 83 Three of Madhvacharya's eight mathas (monasteries) in Karnataka‚ÄîShirur, Pejavara and Puttige‚Äîhave Vitthala as their presiding deity.Sharma (2000) p. 612Rao (2002) pp. 54‚Äì55 A Vitthaleshwara temple stands at Mulbagal, Karnataka. In Tamil Nadu, Vitthala shrines are found in Srirangam, Vittalapuram near thiruporur and in Tirunelveli district, and Thennangur, Govindapuram near Kumbakonam and sculptures are also found in Kanchi.  Legend  Image of a gopuram of a Pandharpur temple near Vithoba's central temple. The leftmost panel depicts Tukaram, the central panel depicts Vithoba (standing dark figure, left) waiting on the brick as Pundalik (centre) serves his parents, the right panel depicts Dnyaneshwar. Legends regarding Vithoba usually focus on his devotee Pundalik or on Vithoba's role as a savior to the poet-saints of the Varkari faith. As discussed in the devotional works section above, the Pundalik legend appears in the Sanskrit scriptures Skanda Purana and Padma Purana. It is also documented in Marathi texts: Panduranga-Mahatmya by a Brahmin called Sridhara; another work of the same name written by Prahlada Maharaj; and also in the abhangas of various poet-saints. There are three versions of the Pundalik legend, two of which are attested as textual variants of the Skanda Purana (1.34‚Äì67). According to the first, the ascetic Pundarika (Pundalik) is described as a devotee of god Vishnu and dedicated to the service of his parents. The god Gopala-Krishna, a form of Vishnu, comes from Govardhana as a cowherd, accompanied by his grazing cows, to meet Pundarika. Krishna is described as in digambar form, wearing makara-kundala, the srivatsa mark (described above), a head-dress of peacock feathers, resting his hands on his waist and keeping his cow-stick between his thighs. Pundarika asks Krishna to remain in this form on the banks of the river Bhima. He believes that Krishna's presence will make the site a tirtha and a kshetra.Sand (1990) pp. 41‚Äì42 The location is identified with modern-day Pandharpur, which is situated on the banks of the Bhima. The description of Krishna resembles the characteristics of the Pandharpur image of Vithoba.Bakker (1990) p. 78 The second version of the legend depicts Vithoba appearing before Pundalik as the five-year-old Bala Krishna (infant Krishna). This version is found in manuscripts of both Puranas, Prahlada Maharaj, and the poet-saints, notably Tukaram.Sand (1990) p. 50 The remaining version of the Pundalik legend appears in Sridhara and as a variant in the Padma Purana. Pundalik, a Brahmin madly in love with his wife, neglected his aged parents as a result. Later, on meeting sage Kukkuta, Pundalik underwent a transformation and devoted his life to the service of his aged parents. Meanwhile, Radha, the milkmaid-lover of Krishna, came to Dwarka, the kingdom of Krishna, and sat on his lap. Radha did not honour Rukmini, the chief queen of Krishna, nor did Krishna hold Radha accountable for the offence. Offended, Rukmini left Krishna and went to the forest of Dandivana near Pandharpur. Saddened by Rukmini's departure, Krishna searched for his queen and finally found her resting in Dandivana, near Pundalik's house. After some coaxing, Rukmini was pacified. Then Krishna visited Pundalik and found him serving his parents. Pundalik threw a brick outside for Krishna to rest on. Krishna stood on the brick and waited for Pundalik. After completing his services, Pundalik asked that his Lord, in Vithoba form, remain on the brick with Rukmini, in Rakhumai form, and bless His devotees forever. Other legends describe Vithoba coming to the rescue of his devotees in the form of a commoner, an outcast Mahar \\"untouchable\\" or a Brahmin beggar.Eleanor Zelliot in Mokashi (1987) p. 35 Mahipati, in his work Pandurangastrotra, narrates how Vithoba helped female saints like Janabai in their daily chores, such as sweeping the house and pounding the rice.Tilak (2006) p. 247 He narrates how Vithoba came to the aid of Sena the barber. The king of Bidar had ordered Sena to be arrested for not coming to the palace despite royal orders. As Sena was engrossed in his prayers to Vithoba, Vithoba went to the palace in the form of Sena to serve the king, and Sena was saved.For complete tale, see Mahipati pp. 22‚Äì27 Another tale deals with a saint, Damaji, the keeper of the royal grain store, who distributed grain to the people in famine. Vithoba came as an outcaste with a bag of gold to pay for the grain.For complete story, see Mahipati pp. 85‚Äì99 Yet another story narrates how Vithoba resurrected the child of Gora Kumbhar (potter), who had been trampled into the clay by Gora while singing the name of Vithoba.For the complete legend, see Mahipati pp. 286‚Äì289  Notes  References   * Translated into English:            *  Further reading    External links  * Official site of Shri Vitthal Rukmini Temple, Pandharpur ** Images of the central image of Vithoba and Rukmini * Video of the Pandharpur Vithoba's \\"Maha-puja\\" (worship), Maharashtra Times * Article on the Pandharpur temple * The Haridasa movement * * A summary of Viththal ek mahasamanvaya by R C Dhere on author's website Category:Forms of Krishna Category:Forms of Vishnu Category:Regional Hindu gods Category:Titles and names of Krishna ","title":"Vithoba"},{"id":"4444739","text":"First edition (publ. Jonathan Cape) The Dead Sea Scrolls Deception (1991, ) is a book by authors Michael Baigent and Richard Leigh. Rejecting the established scholarly consensus that the Dead Sea scrolls were the work of a marginal Jewish apocalyptic movement, and following primarily the thesis of Robert Eisenman, the authors argue that the scrolls were the work of Jewish zealots who had much in common with, and may have been identical to, the early followers of Jesus led by his brother James the Just. Their unconventional hypothesis provides a different version of the history of early Christianity and challenges the divinity of Jesus. Leigh and Baigent claim that the scrolls were kept under wraps for decades by a team dominated by Catholic scholars under the leadership of a Dominican friar, Roland de Vaux. They contend that the preconceptions of de Vaux and other members of the team led them to ignore evidence of the probable 1st-century provenance of many of the scrolls, and instead, to consign these scrolls safely to the distant past. Criticism The book was severely criticised by Hershel Shanks of Biblical Archaeology Review. Joseph Fitzmyer has described it as consisting largely of a \\"pattern of errors and misinformed statements\\". The book makes a number of incorrect claims and has been ridiculed by scholars who have worked with the Dead Sea scrolls and who have come to the conclusion that Jesus and early Christianity are very different from the ideas and people represented in the Dead Sea scrolls.

It was founded on 12 October 1847 as Telegraphen-Bauanstalt von Siemens & Halske by Werner von Siemens and Johann Georg Halske. The company, located in Berlin-Kreuzberg, specialised in manufacturing electrical telegraphs according to Charles Wheatstone's patent of 1837. In 1848, the company constructed one of the first European telegraph lines from Berlin to Frankfurt am Main. Siemens & Halske quickly expanded with representatives in Great Britain (Carl Wilhelm Siemens) and Russia (Carl Heinrich von Siemens) as well as its own cable-manufacturing plants at Woolwich and Saint Petersburg. The company's rise was supported by Werner von Siemens' patent of the electrical generator (dynamo) in 1867. Fort Klapperkop, Pretoria In 1881, Siemens & Halske built the Gross-Lichterfelde Tramway, the world's first electric streetcar line, in the southwestern Lichterfelde suburb of Berlin, followed by the M√∂dling and Hinterbr√ºhl Tram near Vienna, the first electrical interurban tram in Austria‚ÄìHungary. 1882 saw the opening of the experimental \\"Elektromote\\" track, an early trolleybus concept in the Berlin suburb of Halensee. The rising popularity of telegraphs and electrical tramways, as well as in generators and electric motors, ensured steady growth for Siemens & Halske. Siemens & Halske was not alone in the realm of electrical engineering. In 1887, Emil Rathenau had established Allgemeine Elektrizit√§ts-Gesellschaft (AEG), which became a long-time rival. Werner von Siemens retired in 1890, while Johann Georg Halske had already left the company in 1867. Werner von Siemens' brother Karl Heinrich, together with Werner's sons Arnold and Georg Wilhelm, grew the firm and erected new Siemens & Halske premises along the banks of the western Spree river, in the Berlin suburb of Charlottenburg, in 1897. The firm's vast new site continued to grow, and from 1899 onwards it was known as Siemensstadt. Siemens & Halske Cable Factory in Berlin-Siemensstadt around 1900 When Siemens & Halske merged parts of its activities with Schuckert & Co., Nuremberg in 1903 to become Siemens-Schuckert, Siemens & Halske AG specialized in communications engineering. During World War I, rotary engines of advanced and unusual design were produced under the Siemens- Halske brand, like the Siemens-Halske Sh.I and Sh.III. Later, Siemens established several company subsidiaries for which the Siemens & Halske AG functioned as a holding company. During the Second World War, Siemens & Halske employed slave labour from concentration camps.http://www.rosalux.de/publication/14103/siemens-amp-halske-im- frauenkonzentrationslager See also *Siemens *Siemens-Schuckert ReferencesExternal links * * Category:Siemens Category:Defunct aircraft engine manufacturers of Germany Category:Werner von Siemens Category:Ravensbr√ºck concentration camp Category:Companies involved in the Holocaust ","title":"Siemens &amp; Halske"},{"id":"4444773","text":"Jalandhar district (Jalandhar ZilƒÅ) is a district in Doaba region of the state of Punjab, India.

The Court held that the regulation of relations between Ontario government and employees of a nuclear power plant was under federal jurisdiction under the federal declaratory power of section 92(10)(c) of the Constitution Act, 1867, and the national concern branch of the peace, order and good government. Background Ontario Hydro is a power generating corporation owned by the Ontario government. Among their power generating plants include five nuclear generators. These nuclear plants fall under the jurisdiction of the federal Atomic Energy Control Act. Section 18 of that Act provides that all works and undertakings \\"constructed for the production, use and application of atomic energy\\" are works that are \\"for the general advantage of Canada\\". The Society of Ontario Hydro Professional and Administrative Employees applied for certification under the Ontario Labour Relations Act to represent the employees of Ontario Hydro including those who work at the nuclear plants. The Coalition to Stop the Certification of the Society, another group of employees, attempted to prevent the society from getting certification on the grounds that nuclear stations were in the jurisdiction of the Canada Labour Code which would require them to apply to the Canada Industrial Relations Board. The Ontario Labour Relations Board agreed with the Coalition and held that they did not have jurisdiction to certify the bargaining unit. On appeal to the Court of Appeal for Ontario the ruling of the Board was upheld. The issue before the Supreme Court was stated as: :Does the Labour Relations Act of Ontario or the Canada Labour Code constitutionally apply to the matter of labour relations between Ontario Hydro and those of its employees who are employed in Ontario Hydro's nuclear electrical generating stations which have been declared to be for the general advantage of Canada under s. 18 of the Atomic Energy Control Act? In a four to three decision the Court denied the appeal and held that employees who are connected with the nuclear facilities are subject to the federal Labour Relations Code. Opinion of the Court Three opinions were written. One by LaForest, with L'Heureux-Dub√© and Gonthier JJ concurring, a second by Lamer C.J., and a dissent by Iacobucci, with Sopinka and Cory JJ concurring. LaForest La Forest first considered the invocation of the declaratory power under section 92(10)(c) of the Constitution by the Atomic Energy Act. He observed that if it was properly invoked the work would automatically fall within the jurisdiction of the federal government by virtue of section 91(29). The question is what matters would be included. When a work is declared, stated La Forest, it includes \\"work as a going concern\\" or \\"functioning unit\\", which necessarily involves control over its management and its operation. Consequently, labour relations would presumably be included in the declaration and so the province cannot legislate in relation to the labour of the declared work. La Forest dismisses the proposition that the work also falls under section 92A and consequently cannot be granted to the federal government. La Forest considered the application of the \\"peace, order and good government\\" power. He found that nuclear generators are a matter of national concern and so must fall under federal jurisdiction in section 91 of the Constitution. The production and use of nuclear energy has clear international and intra- provincial implications, and it is sufficiently distinct and separate to fall under the p.o.g.g. power. Lamer Lamer's opinion emphasized that federal power under both p.o.g.g. and the declaratory power must be carefully described and been respectful of the division of powers. Consequently, the p.o.g.g. power will only encompass the production of nuclear power and related safety concerns, but not employment at the plant. However, Lamer added that the power to regulate labour relations is \\"an integral and essential part of Parliament's declaratory and p.o.g.g. jurisdictions.\\" As well there was a clear intention of the government to include the matters in the preamble to the Act as well as the regulations. Lamer further noted that internationally practices of regulating nuclear plants have included supervising employees. Lamer held that it is not possible to make a distinction between what is considered part of the \\"undertaking\\" and the \\"integrated activities related to\\" it. There must be a prima facie presumption that jurisdiction of labour relations is held by the federal government. The \\"normal and habitual\\" activities of the employees are intimately related to control of the facilities. Lastly, Lamer rejects the argument that the federal government is precluded from regulating labour relations on the grounds that the provincial government has been exercising jurisdiction for a long period of time. Iacobucci Justice Iacobucci wrote a dissent, which was joined by Justices Cory and Sopinka. Iacobucci agreed with the majority that the declaratory power only extended to matters that were \\"integral to the federal interest in the work\\". He found that this was consistent with general approach to constitutional interpretation where no head of power had the power to subsume the other. Iacobucci disagreed with the majority that labour relations of the plant's employees were integral to the effective regulation of the plants. From reading the preamble there is no indication that labour was to be included, which said that the federal interest was for the safety, health and security concerns. Labour relations only aims at \\"industrial peace\\" and better working conditions for employees, which is not directly related to the plant. This is supported by section 92A of the Constitution Act, 1867. If Parliament wants to include labour relations they could easily do so with their declaratory power. Iacobucci also found that the p.o.g.g. power does not include labour relations. He emphasized the application of \\"balancing principles\\" between the two heads of power. He held that labour relations for plant employees was not part of a \\"single, distinctive, and indivisible matter identified as atomic energy.\\" See also * List of Supreme Court of Canada cases (Lamer Court) External links * Category:Canadian federalism case law Category:Supreme Court of Canada cases Category:Labour relations in Canada Category:Canadian labour case law Category:1993 in Canadian case law ","title":"Ontario Hydro v Ontario (Labour Relations Board)"},{"id":"4444832","text":"WRSE is a college radio station in Elmhurst, Illinois, a western suburb of Chicago.

It is the largest district of Punjab, by both area and population. Ludhiana city, the district headquarters, is the hub of industry in Punjab. The main industries are bicycle parts and hosiery. Ludhiana is the biggest city of the state. It has eight tehsils, seven sub-tehsils and twelve development blocks. Ludhiana district has the highest HDI in Punjab at 0.761 (2004 UNDP). History Ludhiana gets its name from the Lodhi Dynasty, which is believed to have founded the city in 1480. During the reign of the Mughal emperor Akbar the area formed part of the Sarkar of Sirhind. Chakar, Talwandi Rai in 1478 AD, Raikot in 1648 AD and Jagraon in 1688 AD were founded by the Rai family of Raikot.Ludhiana Dist. Gazetteer 1888-89 & 1904\\\\. Chiefs of Punjab 1890, 1909 & 1940 In the latter period of Mughal rule the western part of the district was leased to the Rais of Raikot. By the early eighteenth century, they had become semi-independent of the Mughals. The villages in Ludhiana district remained independent and under the rule of local powerful village Sikh chieftains, from 1707 to 1835. In 1747 Ahmad Shah Durrani invaded and battled the imperial army near Khanna. Although the Mughals were able to stop Ahmad Shah, his subsequent invasions weakened the Mughals, which allowed the Rais to take control of Ludhiana town in 1760. During the reign of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, Ludhiana became an important British cantonment. Initially, in 1805, Ranjit Singh occupied Ludhiana. However, in 1809, the British decided to curb his advance eastward and sent troops to confront him. Ranjit Singh was forced to sign the treaty of 'perpetual friendship' with the British, which confined his activities to the right bank of the Sutlej. British troops were permanently stationed in Ludhiana and the Cis-Sutlej states came under British protection. There was also the battle of Saragarahi fought on 12 September 1897 According to the 1901 census, Hindus numbered 269,076, or 40% of the total; Muslims, 235,937, or 35%; and Sikhs, 164,919, or 24%. In 1947 due to violence and strife between the communities, most of the Muslim population left for Pakistan.  Demographics  According to the 2011 census, Ludhiana district has a population of 3,498,739 roughly equal to the nation of Panama or the US state of Connecticut. Ludhiana district has a total of 2,560,225 literates which constitutes 73.5% of the population, of which male literary is 76.5% and female literacy is 69.4%. The effective literacy of 7+ population of Ludhiana district is 82.20%, of which male is 86% and female literacy is 77.9%. The sex ratio of 873 females for every 1,000 males. The total Scheduled Caste population is 923,358. There were 716826 households in the district in 2011. The number of workers in the district is 1285,000, which means a work participation rate of 36.7%. Out of the total workforce of the district, 18.7% are engaged in the agriculture sector, 5.6% are working in the household industry, and the rest are employed in other sectors/industries. Location Ludhiana is a centrally located city of Punjab, which is on the Grand Trunk Road from Delhi to Amritsar at latitude 30.55 North and longitude 75.54 East in Northern India. Ludhiana is the most centrally located district in the Malwa region of the state of Punjab. For administrative purposes, it has been placed in the Patiala Division. It lies between north latitude 30¬∞-34' and 31¬∞-01' and east longitude 75¬∞-18' and 76¬∞-20'. It is bounded on the north by the Satluj River, which separates it from Jalandhar district. The river forms its northern boundary with Hoshiarpur district. On other sides it shares common boundaries with Rupnagar district in the east, Moga district in the west, and Barnala, Sangrur and Patiala districts in the south and southeast, respectively. Topography The topography of the district is a typical representative of an alluvial plain. It owes its origin to the aggravation work of the Satluj River. The alluvium deposited by the river has been worked over by the wind, which gave rise to a number of small dunes and sand mounds. Most of these dunes have been leveled by farmers. The district can be divided into the flood plain of the Satluj and the upland plain. Climate Ludhiana features a semi-arid climate under the K√∂ppen climate classification, with three defined seasons; summer, monsoon, and winter. This climate is characterized by dryness except for a brief spell of monsoon season, a very hot summer, and a bracing winter. The cold season is from mid-November to the early part of March. The succeeding period until the end of June is the hot season. July, August and half of September constitute the southwest monsoon. The period of mid-September to about the middle of November may be termed as a post-monsoon or transitional period. June is generally the hottest month. Hot and scorching dust-laden winds blow during the summer season. December and January are the coldest months. Ludhiana on average sees roughly of precipitation annually. The official weather station for the city is in the compound of the Civil Surgeon's Office to the west of Ludhiana. Weather records here data back to 1 August 1868. Rainfall The rainfall in the district increases from the southwest toward the northeast. About 70% of the rainfall is received during the period of July through September. The rainfall between December and March accounts for 16% of the rainfall; the remaining 14% rainfall is received in the other months. Pollution Ludhiana has one of the worst air pollution problems in India, with particulate matter being over six times the World Health Organization recommended standard, making it the 13th most polluted city in the world. Industrial water pollution is also of significant concern in portions of Ludhiana, notably along the Budha Dariya. Rivers and drains The Sutlej and its tributary, the Buddha Nala, constitute the chief hydrographic features of the district. A brief description of these is as follows. ; Sutlej River: originates from Lake Manasarovar in Tibet. After flowing through Himachal Pradesh, it debouches from the Shivaliks. Just about Rupnagar, 32 km east of the boundary of Samrala Tehsil, it flows due west along the top of the district for 96 km and turns, as it leaves Jagraon Tehsil, slightly north toward its junction with the Beas at Harike. It maintains an east-west direction. It can be devastating during floods. The Sutlej has experienced a westward drift during recent times. Old towns and villages, such as Bahlulpur, Machhiwara, and Kum Kalan, were built on its banks. The river has since been dammed at Bhakhra, which has considerably checked its flooding menace in the district. ; Buddha Nala: It runs parallel to the Satluj on its south for a fairly large section of its course in the district and ultimately joins the Satluj at Gorsian Kadar Baksh in the northwestern corner of the district. It floods during the rainy season, but in the dry season, it can be crossed on foot at certain points. Ludhiana and Machhiwara are to the south of the Buddha Nala. The water of the stream is polluted after it enters Ludhiana City. Ludhiana Tehsil Ludhiana West Tehsil is a tehsil in Ludhiana district.

The town of Rupnagar (formerly known as Rupar or Ropar) is said to have been founded by a Raja called Rokeshar, who ruled during the 11th century and named it after his son Rup Sen. It is also the site of an ancient town of the Indus Valley Civilization. The major cities in Ropar District are Morinda, Nangal and Anandpur Sahib. Morinda is also known as BaghwƒÅla \\"[The City] of Gardens.\\" Morinda is located on the Chandigarh- Ludhiana Highway. The Bhakra Dam in Nangal lies on the boundary with the neighboring state of Himachal Pradesh. Dadhi is one of the most important villages of the district, particularly because of Gurudwara Sri Hargobindsar Sahib. Ropar Ropar is a 21-meter-high ancient mound overlaying the Shiwalik (also spelled as Sivalik or Shivalik) deposition on the left bank of the river Sutlej where it merges into the plains. It has yielded a sequence of six cultural periods or phases with some breaks from the Harappan times to the present day. The excavations were carried out by Dr. Y.D. Sharma of Archaeological Survey of India. The migration of the Harappans to Ropar has been postulated through the lost Saraswati River to the Sutlej as both rivers once belonged to one system.  Period I  At Ropar excavation, the lowest levels yielded the Harappan traits in Period 1, which falls in the proto- historic period. A major find was a steatite seal in the Indus script used for the authentication of trading goods, impression of the seal on a terracotta lump of burnt clay, chert blades, copper implements, terracotta beads, and bangles and typically standardized pottery of Indus Valley Civilization. They flourished in all the Harappan cities and townships. The dead were buried with head generally to the north and with funerary vessels as unearthed in cemetery R-37 at Harappa (Sind, Pakistan). What led the Harappans to desert the site is not known. Period II Period II belongs to Painted grey ware people who followed the Harappans. Typical pottery of this period consisted of fine grey ware painted black, terracotta bangles, semi-precious stones, glass, bone arrowheads, ivory kohl sticks, and copper implements. This period is identified as the period belonging to the Great War Epic - Mahabharata. A new settlement sprang up here by about 600 BC - chronologically Period III at Rupar. Grey pottery of Period II still continued. This period belongs to circa 600 BC to 200 BC. It yielded the earlier coins (punch-marked and uninscribed cast coins), copper, and implements. An important find was an ivory seal inscribed in Mauryan Brahmi script (4th and 3rd century BC) Minutely carved and polished stone discs with a figure and motif associated with the cult of the Mother goddess of fertility have also been unearthed in the excavations from Taxila (now in Pakistan), Patna in the state of Bihar and other Mauryan sites. Houses of mud and kiln burnt bricks were by no means rare. A 3.6-meter wide burnt brick wall traced to a length of about 75 m probably endorsed a tank that collected water through inlets. The upper levels have soak wells lined with terracotta rings of Shunga and Kushana periods. Period III To V From Period III to V there are fairly rich dwelling complexes with houses of stone and mud bricks. The full plans of the houses could not be exposed owing to the vertical nature of excavations carried out. Period VI In the next phase, Period VI revealed the evidence of the Shungas, Kushanas, and Guptas and their successors. Excavations also revealed successive building levels of various dynasties. In the upper levels, a hoard of copper coins of Kushan and Gupta rules were found. This includes a gold coin issued by Chandragupta-Kumerdevi of the Gupta dynasty, which is also known as the golden age in ancient Indian history. A large number of terracotta figurines of Shunga, Kushana, and Gupta periods were also discovered. Amongst them were a Yakshi figure with cherubic expression and a beautiful seated figure of a lady playing on the lyre reminiscent of Samudragupta‚Äôs figure in a similar position on the famous gold coins of the Gupta dynasty. A set of three silver utensils for ritualistic purposes with Greek influence depicts the fine craftsmanship of the Gupta dynasty in its chased decoration. The pottery of this period in the upper levels is for the most part redware and is frequently decorated with incised motifs. After a short break, there is evidence of a fresh occupation identified as Period V commencing around the early 6th century and continuing for three or four centuries. The coins of Toramana (circa AD 500) and Mihirakula (circa 510-40) have been recovered from these levels. The spacious brick building of the fifth period was constricted neatly and evidence showed a good measure of prosperity during this period. Probably after desertion, a new town sprang up here around 13th century AD on the same site named Period VI and it continues to flourish to the present day. An archaeological site museum has been set up to house some of the antiquities of Rupar along with the photographs displaying excavation material.

Accessed 30-03-2008. The court transcripts explain that √âlectro Sant√© Inc., a competitor, developed similar technology that used a microcontroller rather than the circuits. Free World Trust sued √âlectro Sant√© for patent infringement on the ground that although the means may be different the end result of the inventions were the same. The Quebec Superior Court found that √âlectro Sant√©'s invention was not novel and so their invention was invalidated. The Court of Appeal overturned the decision and found that there was no violation. In a unanimous decision, the Supreme Court upheld the appellate court ruling. Opinion of the court Justice Binnie wrote the decision for a unanimous Court. He began by describing the process of interpreting a patent through \\"claim construction\\". Claim construction is the process where the inessential part of the patent are distinguished from its essential elements which are protectable by patent. In this case, the essential elements of the two patents held by Free World included controls that regulated the electro-magnetic waves \\"by circuit means\\". This invention, Binnie found, was more than a mere aggregation of known components and was not anticipated by publications. The primary issue to Binnie was how to resolve the conflict between \\"literal\\" and \\"substantive\\" infringement. He states that one of the purposes of the Patent Act is to achieve fairness and predictability in order to promote research and development. He was concerned that protection provided by a broad reading of a patent would scare innovators from exploring similar ideas surrounding a claimed patent. According to Binnie, predictability could be achieved by \\"tying the patentee to its claims\\" and fairness would be achieved by \\"interpreting those claims in an informed and purposive way\\". Binnie was hesitant for courts to attempt to find the \\"spirit of the invention\\" which would create more uncertainty and unpredictability. His proposed \\"purposive construction\\" approach would avoid literal interpretation while limiting the scope of substantive claims in attempt to balance fairness between the patentee and the public. Purposive construction identifies the essential from the non-essential. The analysis is from the perspective of a \\"worker skilled in the art to which the patent relates as of the date the patent is published\\". If an essential element is different or missing from the challenged invention then there is no infringement. However, there may still be infringement where only non- essential elements are different or missing. A non-essential element is one that, from the words of the claim, are not clearly intended to be essential, or where a skilled reader would have been able to identify a substitute. In applying these principles to the facts of the case, Binnie found that Electro Sante's invention did not infringe upon Free World's patent. The essential elements of these inventions are not the results they produce but the way of producing them. The patent holder cannot monopolize all means of producing a particular result. The use of a microcontroller was significantly different that it constituted a different invention.

It is the headquarters of Fatehgarh Sahib district, located about north of Sirhind. Fatehgarh Sahib is named after Fateh Singh, the 7-year-old son of Guru Gobind Singh who was seized and buried alive along with his 9-year-old brother Zoravar Singh, by the Mughal Army under the orders of commander Wazir Khan during the ongoing Muslim-Sikh war of early 18th century.Gurmukh Singh (2009), Fatehgarh Sahib, Encyclopedia of Sikhism, Editor in Chief: Harbans Singh, Punjab University The town experienced major historical events after the martyrdom of the sons in 1705, with repeated change of control between the Sikh and Muslim rulers. The town features historic Gurdwaras, including the underground Bhora Sahib marking the location where the two boys refused to convert to Islam and fearlessly accepted being bricked alive. In contemporary times, the town is the site of educational institutions such as the SGPC run Guru Granth Sahib University and Baba Banda Singh Bahadur Engineering College. History The city is a historically important settlement north of the city of Patiala and 42 kilometers (26 mi) west of Punjab's capital, Chandigarh. It is a major pilgrimage center in Sikhism. The Gurdwara Fatehgarh Sahib is the major landmark in the town. It marks the location where two youngest sons of Guru Gobind Singh Ji ‚Äì 7 year old Fateh Singh and 9 year old Zorawar Singh ‚Äì were betrayed by their cook and servant Gangu to the Mughal army, seized, asked to convert to Islam and when they refused they were buried alive under the orders of Wazir Khan. Their martyrdom on 9 December 1705 has been remembered by the Sikhs by naming the site as Fatehgarh after the youngest boy killed, and by building a large Gurdwara in 1843. The town is also the location where the Sikhs took revenge by capturing it from Wazir Khan in 1710 and killing him. However, the Sikh militia was defeated again few years later and the town remained in the control of Muslim rulers, including later an appointee of Ahmed Shah Durrani till 1764, when Khalsa recaptured it by defeating and killing the appointee Zain Khan. Bhora Sahib, the sanctum remembering the spot where two sons of Guru Gobind Singh were buried alive. The wall is visible to the side of the golden dome. Backview of the entrance gateway to the Fatehgarh Sahib Gurdwaras complex, Punjab The town is home to major Sikh Gurdwaras: *Bhora Sahib: the underground location within Fatehgarh Sahib Gurdwara where the two sons were buried alive. This monument was built by Karam Singh of Patiala in early 19th- century. *Fatehgarh Sahib Gurdwara: the main Sikh temple in the town, in whose basement is Bhora Sahib. The Gurdwara stands on a high point of the town, has an Indo-Islamic architecture with a square plan, a ribbed lotus dome and cusped arches. The floor is made of marble and is decorated with a mosaic. It is three storeyed consisting of a basement, a central pavilion and dome level above. The basement has a copy of the Sikh scripture, Khalsa swords, dagger and other holy historic relics. It is marked with silence, usually with visitors as well as pilgrims seated and praying. The upper level with the central pavilion also houses the Guru Granth Sahib and features kirtan singing. The upper levels and domes were added by Yadavinder Singh in 1955, after India gained its independence from the colonial British Empire. *Gurdwara Jyoti Sarup lies about southeast from Fatehgarh Sahib on the Sirhind-Chandigarh road. At this place, Mata Gujri ‚Äì the mother of Guru Gobind Singh, and her two youngest grandchildren, Fateh Singh and Zorawar Singh were cremated. *Gurdwara Bimangarh is close to the Fatehgarh Sahib Gurdwara. It is a location where the dead bodies of the two children and their grandmother was kept for the night before the cremation. *Banda Bahadur platform is believed in the Sikh tradition as the place where 6,000 Sikhs died fighting the Muslim army in the Battle of Chapparchiri. There also exists remains of an ancient Royal inn in the city named Aam Khas Bagh that was initially built by Akbar and rebuilt by Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan. Festivals and fairs Every year between 11th and 14th of the month of Poh (usually about 25 to 27 December), Fatehgarh Sahib is the pilgrimage site for many Sikhs who visit it to remember the martyrdom, locally known as Shaheedi Jor Mela of the sons of Guru Gobind Singh.

Dewan Banna Mal's sons Dewan Acchru Mal Gautam (Revenue Minister) and Dewan Sundri Mal Gautam (Revenue Minister) of Kapurthala State built Brahmkund Mandir at backside of Shalimar Bagh in Kapurthala. Dewan Banna Mal was the owner of 3000 acres of land in Mand area of Kapurthala on the Bank of River Beas \\"Bana Mal Wala\\" after Dewan Banna Mal Gautam's name and Brahampur villages in Tehsil Phagwara.

It has about 29,000 inhabitants. It lies in the historical region of Cieszyn Silesia. The name is most probably possessive in origin, derived from the personal name Orel (Czech) (Orze≈Ç in Polish), the same as eagle in English, although it may also be of topographic origins. History According to legend, Mieszko, a Silesian duke from the lower branch of the Piast dynasty, went hunting with his pregnant wife, Ludmi≈Ça. As they rested upon a hill, an eagle suddenly took flight, frightening the couple. The eagle dropped his prey, which fell to earth near them. Ludmi≈Ça prematurely gave birth to her child, Kazimierz. The couple, seeing a sign from God in this incident, founded a chapel on that spot and later named the subsequent settlement after the eagle (, ). Thus, it is not clear when the settlement was really founded; however, it was first mentioned in a document of Pope Gregory IX issued on 7 December 1227 for Benedictine abbey in Tyniec as Orlova. Around 1268 a separate but dependent from Tyniec Benedictine monastery was founded.I. Panic, 2010, p. 428 Politically it belonged then to the Duchy of Opole and Racib√≥rz and the Castellany of Cieszyn, which was in 1290 formed in the process of feudal fragmentation of Poland into the Duchy of Teschen, ruled by a local branch of Silesian Piast dynasty. In 1327 the duchy became a fee of the Kingdom of Bohemia, which after 1526 became a part of the Habsburg Monarchy. During the Middle Ages it was a settlement of agricultural character. Major change came in the 19th century with the coal mining boom. The population grew rapidly together with urban development. After the Revolutions of 1848 in the Austrian Empire, a modern municipal division was introduced in the re-established Austrian Silesia. The village as a municipality was subscribed at least since 1880 to political district and legal district of Freistadt. In 1908 the municipality gained market town rights. At the beginning of the 20th century Orlov√° became an important center of Polish and Czech education and home to many cultural and sport organizations of both communities. There were also a Jewish and a German community in the town. According to the censuses conducted in 1880, 1890, 1900 and 1910 the population of the municipality grew from 2,955 in 1880 to 8,334 in 1910. The dominant language spoken colloquially was alternating through the censuses. In 1880 and 1900 the majority were Polish-speakers (2,287 or 79.8% in 1880 and 3.919 or 60.3% in 1900), whereas in 1890 and 1910 the majority were Czech-speakers (2.199 or 65.8% in 1890 and 4.799 or 58.5% in 1910). They were accompanied by a German-speaking minority (at least 4.7% in 1890, at most 7.3% in 1910). In terms of religion, in 1910 the majority were Roman Catholics (6,140 or 73.6%), followed by Protestants (1,801 or 21.6%), Jews (374 or 4.5%) and others (19 or 0.3%). The village was also traditionally inhabited by Silesian Lachs, speaking Cieszyn Silesian dialect, additionally industrial growth lured a large influx of migrant workers, mostly from western Galicia. After World War I, fall of Austria-Hungary, Polish‚ÄìCzechoslovak War and the division of Cieszyn Silesia in 1920, Orlov√° became a part of Czechoslovakia. Orlov√° gained town rights in 1922. During the workers' strike in 1925 four workers were killed by the police. Following the Munich Agreement, in October 1938 together with the Zaolzie region it was annexed by Poland, administratively organised in Frysztat County of Silesian Voivodeship. The village was then annexed by Nazi Germany at the beginning of World War II. After the war it was restored to Czechoslovakia. In 1946 the villages of Lazy (≈Åazy), Poruba (Porƒôba) and Horn√≠ Lutynƒõ were administratively joined to the town. Widespread coal mining, especially during the communist era, had a devastating impact on the town, its buildings and architecture, especially in Lazy. Many buildings in Orlov√° were demolished, including the Polish grammar school built in 1909. The architectural character of the town was completely changed. Landmarks The most important landmark in Orlov√° is the Neo-Gothic church, which replaced an older wooden one. It was almost completely rebuilt in 1903‚Äì1906, when it became the dominant edifice of the town. An important feature of the church is the stair leading up to it. The church was damaged by extensive coal mining in the town and the surroundings, and renovation work began in the 1990s and still continues. Another notable landmark is the town hall from 1928. There is also a Lutheran church in the town, consecrated in 1862. Education There are several primary schools in Orlov√°, mostly Czech, one Polish. Several high schools are located there. Most notable is a Czech gymnasium which was rebuilt in modern architectural style and opened in 1996. Juliusz S≈Çowacki Polish Gymnasium was located in Orlov√° before relocating to Karvin√° and eventually ƒåesk√Ω Tƒõ≈°√≠n.

Biography  David Milne was born in the southwestern Ontario village of Burgoyne (near Paisley) in 1882. He was the last of 10 children born to Scottish immigrant parents. His early education was in Paisley, followed by high school in Walkerton; he performed well in school and soon after graduation began teaching in a country school near Paisley. During 1902 and 1903 he studied art through correspondence, eventually deciding to move to New York City in 1903 at the age of 21. In New York, he spent two years (and a third year of night school) studying at the Art Students League. He had five paintings exhibited in the Armory Show of 1913, and he was also represented by the N. E. Montross Gallery (same as 'The Eight' or Ashcan School artists). In 1912, he married Frances May (known as Patsy) and later they moved to Boston Corners, a small hamlet where Milne painted with oils and watercolours. Milne left Boston Corners in 1917 for basic training in Toronto for World War I. He was stationed in Quebec and then quarantined in England for a month, during which time World War I ended. Because of his background as an artist, he was asked to complete paintings and drawings as a war artist. Milne produced artworks of battlefields in France and Belgium as well as of soldiers in Kinmel Park Camp in England. Between the years of 1919 and 1929, Milne lived in Boston Corners and the surrounding areas, focusing his artistic work on the landscape. In 1929, Milne returned to Canada to paint in Temagami, Weston and Palgrave. He separated from his wife in 1933, moved to Port Severn, Ontario and sold many of his paintings to prominent art patrons Vincent Massey and Alice Massey. In the late 1930s, Milne settled down in Uxbridge, Ontario with Kathleen Pavey, a nurse, and the two had a son (also David) in 1941. During the later years of his life, Milne worked again in watercolours, and changed his subject matter to more whimsical, fantasy and childlike inspirations. He continued to travel to Algonquin Park and Baptiste Lake to paint the Canadian landscape. On November 14, 1952, Milne had a stroke. Over the next year he continued to suffer from small strokes and died in the hospital in Bancroft, Ontario on December 26, 1953. Art and technique David Milne worked predominantly in oil paint, watercolour and drypoint printmaking. Like the Group of Seven, Milne primarily chose landscape as his subject matter; however, his approach to this subject was considerably less \\"impressionistic\\" than the Group's and had a more \\"modernist\\" feel. Milne was influenced in part by the European and American modernists exhibited through Alfred Stieglitz's gallery, 291. He also pushed himself to develop his own particular style that was stark yet beautiful and very expressively realized. Milne chose simple, ordinary subjects which he imbued with dignity and significance. His landscapes and still lifes reveal a decorative sense and fluidity of touch. His frequent use of black in his paintings is a characteristic trait. Often one type of object, trees for example, would be depicted in black in one part of the image and white in another creating an intriguing internal tension in the work. For Milne, white was an extension of the palette ‚Äì a way to express the stillness of the landscape he was viewing. In both his watercolour and oil painting techniques, Milne was experimental in his approach. He paid careful attention to composition but also to the qualities of line, colour and texture that were revealed in his work. James Clark, a friend, supporter and patron of Milne's, sent him an etching press while he was at Boston Corners in 1926, and Milne was able to experiment with printmaking in new and unusual ways. He developed a method of making colour drypoints, printing one colour over another with different plates for each. Milne had first tried etching and drypoint while he was a student at the Art Students‚Äô League and his idea of colour drypoint was unprecedented, as the tradition was to only use black and the white of the paper. He had thought of creating colour drypoints years before, but lacked the equipment to carry through his experiments, as the printmaking technique requires metal plates which are scratched or etched into, then inked, wiped and finally run through a printing press. It took many months for Milne to achieve the sparsely layered look that he envisioned with his prints, but the results were very compelling. In his later years Milne began to experiment with content far removed from the simple, albeit highly original, landscapes that make up the better part of his oeuvre. Although he had espoused a pure aestheticism in his younger years (insisting that a painting's content was merely secondary) he went on to produce a number of works that invite an allegorical interpretation. The canvas left on his easel at the time of his death showed a group of angels childishly amusing themselves with cosmetics purchased from a wandering salesman. Recognition and legacy The American art critic Clement Greenberg described Milne as one of the three greatest North American artists of his generation. Although he was overshadowed by the Group of Seven during his early career, Milne is now recognized as one of Canada's foremost artists. After his death, the National Gallery of Canada organized a retrospective exhibition of his work (1955‚Äì56), and then another retrospective was shown in Toronto at Hart House in 1962. In 2005, an exhibit of Milne's watercolours traveled from the British Museum to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York and then to the Art Gallery of Ontario. In 1952, works by Milne along with those of Emily Carr, Goodridge Roberts and Alfred Pellan represented Canada at the Venice Biennale. In June 1992 Canada Post issued 'Red Nasturtiums, David B. Milne, 1937' in the Masterpieces of Canadian art series. The stamp was designed by Pierre-Yves Pelletier based on a painting in the National Gallery of Canada, Ottawa, Ontario.Canada Post stamp In a 2018 exhibition of his work at London's Dulwich Picture Gallery, the critic Jonathan Jones rated it one star out of five, \\"very little sign of development ... embarrassingly repetitive.\\" Art critic Mark Hudson gave it 4 stars out of 5 and wrote, \\"I‚Äôd rather have minor art like this, that takes you somewhere you‚Äôve never been and from an intensely personal perspective, than much of the repetitive, conventionally \\"challenging\\" work served up as major by larger galleries.\\" Florence Hallett writing in the Economist said, \\"The strikingly original Canadian used paint sparingly but to dramatic effect.\\" See also * Canadian official war artists * War artist * War art References=CitationsSources   * * External links * The Canadian Encyclopedia * The Art Gallery of Ontario * The National Film Board of Canada * Cybermuse, National Gallery of Canada * David Milne, Lethbridge College Buchanan Art Collection Category:1882 births Category:1953 deaths Category:Canadian illustrators Category:20th-century Canadian painters Category:Canadian male painters Category:Canadian printmakers Category:Artists from Ontario Category:Writers from Ontario Category:Canadian landscape painters Category:Canadian war artists Category:Canadian people of Scottish descent Category:World War I artists Category:20th-century printmakers Category:Persons of National Historic Significance (Canada) ","title":"David Milne (artist)"},{"id":"4445056","text":"Artists from Genoa were influential during the 17th century.

The foundation stone was laid on 23 April 1901, St George's Day, in the presence of Knyaz Ferdinand I of Bulgaria, and the monument was completed on 15 September 1903. Ferdinand also attended the monument's inauguration on 30 August 1907 together with his sons Boris and Kiril, Grand Duke Vladimir Alexandrovich of Russia, son of Alexander II, together with his wife and his son, as well as other notable figures. Erected of black polished granite from Vitosha, the Monument to the Tsar Liberator consists of a pedestal, a middle part with figures and a massive Neo-Renaissance cornice finished with the sculpture of the Russian Tsar on a horse. The bronze wreath at the foot was donated by Romania in memory of the Romanian soldiers that died during the war.

He is known for his role in the conquests of Kasur, Sialkot, Attock, Multan, Kashmir, Peshawar and Jamrud. Hari Singh Nalwa was responsible for expanding the frontier of Sikh Empire to beyond the Indus River right up to the mouth of the Khyber Pass. At the time of his death, the western boundary of the empire was Jamrud. He served as governor of Kashmir, Peshawar and Hazara. He established a mint on behalf of the Sikh Empire to facilitate revenue collection in Kashmir and Peshawar.  Early life  Hari Singh Nalwa was born in Gujranwala, in the Majha region of Punjab to Dharam Kaur and Gurdial Singh Uppal, in a Sikh Khatri family. After his father died in 1798, he was raised by his mother. In 1801, at the age of ten, he took Amrit Sanchar and was initiated as a Sikh. At the age of twelve, he began to manage his father's estate and took up horse riding. In 1804, at the age of fourteen, his mother sent him to the court of Ranjit Singh to resolve a property dispute. Ranjit Singh decided the arbitration in his favor because of his background and aptitude. Hari Singh had explained that his father and grandfather had served under Maha Singh and Charat Singh, the Maharaja's ancestors, and demonstrated his skills as a horseman and musketeer. Ranjit Singh gave him a position at the court as a personal attendant.  Military career  Coin issued by Hari Singh, minted in Peshawar. Dated 1837 During a hunt in 1804, a tiger attacked him and also killed his horse. His fellow hunters attempted to protect him but he refused their offers and allegedly killed the tiger by himself bare handedly by tearing the tiger apart from its mouth, thus earning the cognomen Baghmar (Tiger-killer). Whether he was by that time already serving in the military is unknown but he was commissioned as Sardar, commanding 800 horses and footmen, in that year. The twenty major battles of Hari Singh Nalwa (either participated or was in command): Battle of Kasur (1807) Hari Singh's first significant participation in a Sikh conquest on assuming charge of an independent contingent was in 1807, at the capture of Kasur. This place had long been a thorn in the side of Ranjit Singh's power because of its proximity to his capital city of Lahore. It was captured in the fourth attempt. This attack was led by Maharaja Ranjit Singh and Jodh Singh Ramgarhia. During the campaign the Sardar showed remarkable bravery and dexterity. The Sardar was granted a Jagir in recognition of his services. Battle of Sialkot (1808) Ranjit Singh nominated Hari Singh Nalwa to take Sialkot from its ruler Jiwan Singh. This was his first battle under an independent command. The two armies were engaged for a couple of days, eventually seventeen year old Hari Singh carried the day.Nalwa lead the army to victory and planted the Sikh Flag on top of the fort. Battle of Attock (1813) The fort of Attock was a major replenishment point for all armies crossing the Indus. In the early 19th century, Afghan appointees of the Kingdom of Kabul held this fort, as they did most of the territory along this frontier. This battle was fought and won by the Sikhs on the banks of the Indus under the leadership of Dewan Mokham Chand, Maharaja Ranjit Singh's general, against Wazir Fatteh Khan and his brother Dost Mohammad Khan, on behalf of Shah Mahmud of Kabul. Besides Hari Singh Nalwa, Hukam Singh Attariwala, Shyamu Singh, Khalsa Fateh Singh Ahluwalia and Behmam Singh Malliawala actively participated in this battle. With the conquest of Attock, the adjoining regions of Hazara-i-Karlugh and Gandhgarh became tributary to the Sikhs. In 1815, Sherbaz Khan of Gandhgarh challenged Hari Singh Nalwa's authority and was defeated. Abortive attempt on Kashmir (1814) The Sikhs made an attempt to take Kashmir soon after the Battle of Attock. The army was under the general command of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, who camped at Rajauri. The troops were led towards Srinagar by Ram Dayal, grandson of Dewan Mokham Chand, while Jamadar Khushal Singh commanded the van, Hari Singh Nalwa and Nihal Singh Attariwala brought up the rear. Lack of provisions, delay in the arrival of reinforcements, bad weather and treachery of the allies lead to the Sikhs to retreat.The next few years were spent in subduing Muslim chiefs within the Kashmir territory, en route Srinagar Valley. In 1815‚Äì16, Hari Singh Nalwa attacked and destroyed the stronghold of the traitorous Rajauri chief. Conquest of Mahmudkot (Mehmood Kot, Muzaffargarh) (1816) In preparation of the conquest of the strongly fortified Mankera, Ranjit Singh decided to approach it from its southern extremity. After the Baisakhi of 1816, Misr Diwan Chand, Illahi Bakhsh, Fateh Singh Ahluwalia, Nihal Singh Attariwala and Hari Singh Nalwa accompanied by seven paltans and the topkhana went towards Mahmudkot. When news of its conquest arrived, it left the Maharaja so elated at the success of Sikh arms that he celebrated this victory with the firing of cannons. Two years later, on their way to Multan, the Sikhs captured the forts of Khangarh and Muzzaffargarh. Battle of Multan (1818) The winter of 1810 saw a jubilant Sikh army stationed near Multan in the Bari Doab. They were riding high on the success of having conquered the Chuj Doab. The possession of the city of Multan was taken with little resistance; however, the fort could not be captured. The fort was bombarded and mined without effect. Sardar Nihal Singh Attariwala and the young Hari Singh Nalwa were seriously wounded. A fire pot thrown from the walls of the fort fell on Hari Singh and he was so badly burnt that it was some months before he was fit for service. Ranjit Singh was disconcerted beyond measure at the length of the siege and perforce had to abandon the attempt. Multan was finally conquered under the nominal command of Kharak Singh and the actual command of Misr Diwan Chand. It was a fiercely contested battle in which Muzzaffar Khan and his sons defended the place with exemplary courage, but they could not withstand the onslaught of the Sikhs. Hari Singh Nalwa was \\"chiefly instrumental\\" in the capture of the citadel. Peshawar becomes tributary (1818) When Shah Mahmud's son, Shah Kamran, killed their Barakzai Vazir Fateh Khan in August 1818 the Sikhs took advantage of the resulting confusion and their army formally forded the Indus and entered Peshawar, the summer capital of the Kingdom of Kabul (modern-day Afghanistan), for the first time. Thereafter, Hari Singh Nalwa was deputed towards Peshawar in order to keep the Sikh dabdaba kayam ‚Äî maintain the pressure. Mitha Tiwana becomes his jagir (1818) In the beginning of 1819, Hari Singh accompanied Misr Diwan Chand to collect tribute from the Nawab of Mankera. On completion of the mission, Diwan Chand crossed the river Chenab along with his topkhana and set up his camp in Pindi Bhattian near Chiniot. He was asked to leave Hari Singh stationed in the suburbs of Nurpur and Mitha Tiwana. Hari Singh must have achieved significant success for soon thereafter the Maharaja bestowed all the possessions of the Tiwana chiefs in jagir on the Sardar. Kashmir becomes a part of the Punjab (1819) In April 1819, the Sikh army marched towards Kashmir. On this occasion, Prince Kharak Singh held nominal command. Misr Diwan Chand led the vanguard, while Hari Singh Nalwa brought up the rear for the support of the leading troops. The third division, under the personal command of Maharaja Ranjit Singh, expedited supplies and conveyed these to the advance troops. On the morning of 5 July 1819, the Sikh columns advanced to the sound of bugles. A severe engagement took place between the two armies and the Sikhs captured Kashmir. Great rejoicing followed in the Sikh camp and the cities of Lahore and Amritsar were illuminated for three successive nights. Thus came to an end the five centuries of Muslim rule in Kashmir. Two years later, as Governor of Kashmir, Hari Singh Nalwa put down the rebellion of the most troublesome Khakha chief, Gulam Ali. Battle of Pakhli (1819) Under the Afghans, Hazara-i-Karlugh, Gandhgarh and Gakhar territory were governed from Attock. Kashmir collected the revenue from the upper regions of Pakhli, Damtaur and Darband. Numerous attempts by the Sikhs to collect revenue from Hazara-i-Karlugh not only met with failure, but also the loss of prominent Sikh administrators and commanders. Following the Sikh conquest of Kashmir, tribute was due from Pakhli, Damtaur, and Darband. On his return to the Punjab plains from the Kashmir Valley, Hari Singh and his companions followed the traditional kafila (caravan) route through Pakhli hoping to collect tribute from the region. The Sikh request for Nazrana resulted in the usual \\"fighting and mulcting\\"; the party however, was successful in their mission. Battle of Mangal (1821) Hari Singh's most spectacular success in the region of Hazara came two years later. On the successful conclusion of his governorship of Kashmir, he departed from the Valley and crossed the river Kishenganga at Muzaffarabad with 7000 foot soldiers. Hari Singh Nalwa traversed the hazardous mountainous terrain successfully, however when his entourage reached Mangal he found his passage opposed. Mangal, the ancient capital of Urasa was now the stronghold of the chief of the Jaduns who controlled the entire region of Damtaur. Hari Singh requested the tribesmen for a passage through their territory, but they demanded a tax on all the Kashmir goods and treasure he was taking with him. All trade kafilas routinely paid this toll. Hari Singh's claim that the goods he carried were not for trade purposes was not accepted. When parleying produced no result, a battle was to occur. Hari Singh then left to join forces with the Sikh army poised for an attack on Mankera, but after he had collected a fine from every house and built a fort in this vicinity. Battle of Mankera (1822) The Sindh Sagar Doab was chiefly controlled from Mankera and Mitha Tiwana. Nawab Hafiz Ahmed Khan, a relative of the Durranis, exerted considerable influence in this region. Besides Mankera, he commanded a vast area protected by 12 forts. With the weakening of Afghan rule in Kabul, the governors of Attock, Mankera, Mitha Tiwana and Khushab had declared their independence. Ranjit Singh celebrated the Dussehra of 1821 across the river Ravi, at Shahdera. Hari Singh, Governor of Kashmir, was most familiar with the territory that the Maharaja had now set his eyes on. Nalwa was summoned post- haste to join the Lahore Army already on its way towards the river Indus. The Maharaja and his army had crossed the Jehlum when Hari Singh Nalwa, accompanied by his Kashmir platoons, joined them at Mitha Tiwana. The Sikhs commenced offensive operations in early November. Nawab Hafiz Ahmed's predecessor, Nawab Mohammed Khan, had formed a cordon around Mankera with 12 forts‚ÄîHaidrabad, Maujgarh, Fatehpur, Pipal, Darya Khan, Khanpur, Jhandawala, Kalor, Dulewala, Bhakkar, Dingana and Chaubara. The Sikh army occupied these forts and soon the only place that remained to be conquered was Mankera itself. A few years earlier, the Nawab of Mankera had actively participated in the reduction of Mitha Tiwana. The Tiwanas, now feudatories of Hari Singh Nalwa, were eager participants in returning that favour to the Nawab. The force was divided into three parts‚Äîone column being under Hari Singh‚Äîand each column entered the Mankera territory by a different route; capturing various places en route all three columns rejoined near Mankera town. Mankera was besieged, with Nalwa's force being on the west of the fort. The Nawab were allowed to proceed towards Dera Ismail Khan, which was granted to him as jagir. His descendants held the area until 1836. Battle of Nowshera (Naushehra) (1823) The Sikhs forayed into Peshawar for the first time in 1818, but did not occupy the territory. They were content with collecting tribute from Yar Mohammed, its Barakzai governor. Azim Khan, Yar Mohammed's half- brother in Kabul, totally disapproved of the latter's deference to the Sikhs and decided to march down at the head of a large force to vindicate the honour of the Afghans. Azim Khan wanted to avenge both, the supplication of his Peshawar brethren and the loss of Kashmir. Hari Singh Nalwa was the first to cross the Indus at Attock to the Sikh post of Khairabad; he was accompanied by Diwan Kirpa Ram and Khalsa Sher Singh, the Maharaja's teenaged son, beside 8,000 men. The Afghan army was expected near Nowshera, on the banks of the river Kabul (Landai). Hari Singh's immediate plan was to capture the Yusafzai stronghold to the north of the Landai at Jehangira, and the Khattak territory to its south at Akora Khattak. Jehangira was a masonry fort with very strong towers and the Afghan Yusafzais offered tough resistance. Hari Singh entered the fort and established his thana there. The remaining troops re-crossed the Landai River and returned to their base camp at Akora. Mohammed Azim Khan had encamped roughly ten miles north-west of Hari Singh's position, on the right bank of the Landai, facing the town of Nowshera, awaiting Ranjit Singh's approach. The Sikhs had scheduled two battles ‚Äì one along either bank of the Landai. After Hari Singh had successfully reduced the Afghan tribal strongholds on either side of the river, Ranjit Singh departed from the fort of Attock. He crossed the Landai River at a ford below Akora, and set up his camp near the fort of Jehangira. The famous army commander Akali Phula Singh and Gurkha commander Bal Bahadur, with their respective troops, accompanied the Maharaja. The Afghan Barakzais witnessed the battle from across the river. They were not able to cross the Landai river. Eventually, the inheritors of Ahmed Shah Abdali's legacy withdrew from the area, toward the direction of Jalalabad. Battle of Sirikot (1824) Sirikot lay less than ten miles to the north-west of Haripur. This Mashwani village was strategically placed in a basin at the top of the north-east end of the Gandhgarh Range, which made its secure location a haven for the rebellious chiefs in the entire region. Hari Singh Nalwa went towards Sirikot before the rains of 1824. It was another six months before the attempt produced conclusive results. The Sardar almost lost his life in the course of this expedition. Ranjit Singh's military campaign for the winter of 1824 was scheduled towards Peshawar and Kabul. While stationed at Wazirabad, he received an arzi (written petition) from Sardar Hari Singh\\"The Akhbars\\". (11 March 1825). The Times, London informing him that he and his men were overwhelmingly outnumbered ‚Äì one Sikh to ten Afghans. Ranjit Singh marched to [Rohtas], from there to [Rawalpindi] and via [Sarai Kala] reached Sirikot. With news of the approach of the Sikh army, the Afghans withdrew. Battle of Saidu (1827) The redeemer of the Yusafzais came in the form of one Sayyid Ahmad , who despite being a 'Hindki' was accepted as a leader by them. Budh Singh Sandhanwalia, accompanied by 4,000 horsemen, was deputed towards Attock to assist in suppressing the Yusafzai rebellion. The Maharaja's brief required him to thereafter to proceed towards Peshawar and collect tribute from Yar Mohammed Khan Barakzai. Budh Singh first heard of the Sayyid after he had crossed the Indus and encamped near the fort of Khairabad. Ranjit Singh was still on the sickbed when the news of the Sayyid's arrival, at the head of a large force of the Yusafzai peasantry, reached him. The gallantry of the Yusafzai defence in the Battle of Nowshera was still vivid in his mind. On receiving this news, he immediately put into motion all the forces that he could muster and immediately dispatched them towards the frontier. The Barakzais in Peshawar, though outwardly professing allegiance to the Sikhs, were in reality in league with the other Afghans. The Sayyid marched from Peshawar in the direction of Nowshera. Sardar Budh Singh wrote to the Sayyid seeking for a clarification of his intention. The Sayyid replied that he wished to first take the fort of Attock and then engage Budh Singh in battle. Hari Singh Nalwa stood guard at the fort of Attock with the intention of keeping the Sayyid and his men from crossing the river until reinforcements arrived from Lahore. News had reached the Sikhs that the jihadis accompanying the Sayyid numbered several thousand. The battle between the Sayyid and the Sikhs was fought on 14 Phagun (23 February) 1827. The action commenced at about ten in the morning. The Muslim war cry of Allah hu Akbar, or \\"God is the greatest\\", was answered by the Sikhs with Bole so nihal, Sat Sri Akal, or \\"they who affirm the name of God, the only immortal truth, will find fulfilment\\". Ironically, the opposing forces first professed the glory of the very same God Almighty, albeit in different languages, before they commenced slaughtering each other. The cannonade lasted about two hours. The Sikhs charged at their opponents, routed them, and continued a victorious pursuit for six miles, taking all their guns, swivels and camp equipment. Occupies Peshawar (1834) The occupation of the great city of Peshawar and its ruinous fort, the Bala Hisar showered that it was a reflection of Sardar Hari Singh Nalwa's formidable reputation in the region. Masson arrived in Peshawar just in time to see the Sikhs take control of the city. His eyewitness‚Äò account reports that the Afghans withdrew from the region and Hari Singh Nalwa occupied Peshawar without conflict. Dost Mohammad Khan withdraws (1835) Hari Singh Nalwa was the governor of Peshawar when Dost Mohammed personally came at the head of a large force to challenge the Sikhs. Following his victory against Shah Shuja at Kandahar, in the first quarter of 1835, Dost Mohammed declared himself padshah (king), gave a call for jihad and set off from Kabul to wrest Peshawar from the Sikhs. Ranjit Singh directed his generals to amuse the Afghans with negotiations and to win over Sultan Mohammed Khan. He directed them that on no account, even if attacked, were they to enter into a general engagement until his arrival. Hari Singh Nalwa and the other Sikh chieftains requested Ranjit Singh to permit them to engage with the Afghans. On 30 Baisakh (10 May 1835), Sardar Hari Singh, Raja Gulab Singh, Misr Sukh Raj, Sardar Attar Singh Sandhanwalia, Jamadar Khushal Singh, the Raja Kalan (Dhian Singh), Monsieur Court, Signor Avitabile, Sardar Tej Singh, Dhaunkal Singh, Illahi Bakhsh of the topkhana, Sardar Jawala Singh and Sardar Lehna Singh Majithia were ordered to move. The troops fanned out over five kos, forming a semicircle in front of the Amir's encampment. Sardar Hari Singh proposed that the water of the stream Bara, which flowed in the direction of Dost Mohammed Khan's camp, be dammed. When the Ghazis appeared, Sardar Hari Singh commenced firing his guns. The Maharaja, however, prohibited him from indulging in battle and dispatched his Vakils to negotiate with the Amir. Dost Mohammed Khan was assured that the Sikhs would affect a truce until their Vakils were in his camp. He accused Fakir Aziz-ud-din of making \\"use of much language, having plenty of leaves but little fruit\\". On finding both his step brothers, Jabbar and Sultan, irredeemably lost to him, Dost Mohammed decided to retire from the field with the whole of his army, armament and equipage. He left at night, making sure that the Fakir did not return to the Sikh camp until after he had gone through the Khyber Pass. Jamrud (Khyber Pass) (1836) In October 1836 following the Dussehra celebrations in Amritsar, Hari Singh made a sudden attack on the village of Jamrud, at the mouth of the Khyber Pass. The Misha Khel Khyberis, the owners of this village, were renowned for their excellent marksmanship and total lack of respect for any authority. Hari Singh Nalwa's first encounter with this tribe had taken place following the Battle of Nowshera when he had pursued the fleeing Azim Khan; and once again, when he chased Dost Mohammed Khan in 1835. The occupation of Jamrud was rather strongly contested but it appeared that the place was taken by surprise. On its capture, Hari Singh Nalwa gave instructions to fortify the position without delay. A small existing fort was immediately put into repair. News of this event was immediately transmitted to Kabul. Masson informed Wade of the passage of events along this frontier in a letter dated 31 October 1836. With the conquest of Jamrud, at the very mouth of the Khyber, the frontier of the Sikh Empire now bordered the foothills of the Hindu Kush Mountains. Panjtaar defeated (1836) The defeat of the Khyberis sent shock waves through the Afghans. Hari Singh Nalwa accompanied by Kanwar Sher Singh, now proceeded towards the Yusafzai strongholds, north-east of Peshawar, which had withheld tribute for three years. The Sikhs defeated the Yusafzais, with their chief, Fateh Khan of Panjtar, losing his territory. It was reported that 15,000 mulkia fled before the Sikhs, many being killed and the remaining taking refuge in the hills. After burning and levelling Panjtar to the ground, Hari Singh returned to Peshawar realising all the arrears of revenue. Fateh Khan was obliged to sign an agreement to pay tribute on which condition Panjtar was released. When news of the conquest of Panjtar reached the Court of Lahore, a display of fireworks was proposed. Battle of Jamrud (1837) The Maharaja's grandson, Nau Nihal Singh was getting married in March 1837. Troops had been withdrawn from all over the Punjab to put up a show of strength for the British Commander-in-chief who was invited to the wedding. Dost Mohammed Khan had been invited to the great celebration. Hari Singh Nalwa too was supposed to be at Amritsar, but in reality was in Peshawar (some accounts say he was ill) Dost Mohammed had ordered his army to march towards Jamrud together with five sons and his chief advisors with orders not to engage with the Sikhs, but more as a show of strength and try and wrest the forts of Shabqadar, Jamrud and Peshawar. Hari Singh had also been instructed not to engage with the Afghans till reinforcements arrived from Lahore. Hari Singh's lieutenant, Mahan Singh, was in the fortress of Jamrud with 600 men and limited supplies. Hari Singh was in the strong fort of Peshawar. He was forced to go to the rescue of his men who were surrounded from every side by the Afghan forces, without water in the small fortress. Though the Sikhs were totally outnumbered, presence of Hari Singh Nalwa put the Afghan army into panic. In the melee, Hari Singh Nalwa was grievously wounded. Before he died, he told his lieutenant not to let the news of his death out till the arrival of reinforcements, which is what he did. While the Afghans knew that Hari Singh had been wounded, they waited for over a week doing nothing, till the news of his death was confirmed. The Afghans withdrew after witnessing Nalwa‚Äôs body hung outside the fort. Hari Singh Nalwa had not only defended Jamrud and Peshawar, but had prevented the Afghans from ravaging the entire north-west frontier, in turn was not able to invade Afghanistan himself. The loss of Hari Singh Nalwa was irreparable and this Sikh defeat was costly for that precise reason. The victories in battles that were achieved over the Afghans, were a favourite topic of conversation for Ranjit Singh. He was to immortalise these by ordering a shawl from Kashmir at the record price of Rs5000, in which were depicted the scenes of the battles fought with them. Following the death of Hari Singh Nalwa, no further conquests were made in this direction. The Khyber Pass continued as the Sikh frontier till the annexation of the Punjab by the British.  Administrator  Hari Singh's administrative rule covered one- third of the Sikh Empire. He served as the Governor of Kashmir (1820‚Äì21), Greater Hazara (1822‚Äì1837) and was twice appointed the Governor of Peshawar (1834-5 & 1836-his death). He worked closely with 2nd in command of the Khalsa Army, the Hindu 'Raja Mahan Singh Mirpuri'' on many affairs related to administrationThe history of the Muhiyals: The militant Brahman race of India (English,1911) by T.P. Russell Stracey. In his private capacity, Hari Singh Nalwa was required to administer his vast jagir spread all over the kingdom. He was sent to the most troublesome spots of the Sikh empire in order to \\"create a tradition of vigorous and efficient administration\\". The territories under his jurisdiction later formed part of the British Districts of Peshawar, Hazara (Pakhli, Damtaur, Haripur, Darband, Gandhgarh, Dhund, Karral and Khanpur), Attock (Chhachch, Hassan Abdal), Jehlum (Pindi Gheb, Katas), Mianwali (Kachhi), Shahpur (Warcha, Mitha Tiwana and Nurpur), Dera Ismail Khan (Bannu, Tank, and Kundi), Rawalpindi (Rawalpindi, Kallar) and Gujranwala. In 1832, at the specific request of William Bentinck, the Maharajah proposed a fixed table of duties for the whole of his territories. Sardar Hari Singh Nalwa was one of the three men deputed to fix the duties from Attock (on the Indus) to Filor (on the Satluj). In Kashmir, however, Sikh rule was generally considered oppressive, protected perhaps by the remoteness of Kashmir from the capital of the Sikh empire in Lahore. The Sikhs enacted a number of anti- Muslim laws, which included handing out death sentences for cow slaughter, closing down the Jamia Masjid in Srinagar, and banning the azaan, the public Muslim call to prayer. Kashmir had also now begun to attract European visitors, several of whom wrote of the abject poverty of the vast Muslim peasantry and of the exorbitant taxes under the Sikhs. The Sikh rule in lands dominated for centuries by Muslims was an exception in the political history of the latter. To be ruled by 'kafirs' was the worst kind of ignominy to befall a Muslim. Before the Sikhs came to Kashmir (1819 CE), the Afghans had ruled it for 67 years. For the Muslims, Sikh rule was the darkest period of the history of the place, while for the Kashmiri Pandits (Hindus) nothing was worse than the Afghan rule. The Sikh conquest of Kashmir was prompted by an appeal from its Hindu population. The oppressed Hindus had been subjected to forced conversions, their women raped, their temples desecrated, and cows slaughtered. Efforts by the Sikhs to keep peace in far-flung regions pressed them to close mosques and ban the call to prayer because the Muslim clergy charged the population to frenzy with a call for 'jihad' at every pretext. Cow-slaughter (Holy Cow) offended the religious sentiments of the Hindu population and therefore it met with severe punishment in the Sikh empire. In Peshawar, keeping in view \\"the turbulence of the lawless tribes ... and the geographical and political exigencies of the situation\\" Hari Singh's methods were most suitable.  Diplomatic mission  In 1831, Hari Singh Nalwa was deputed to head a diplomatic mission to Lord William Bentinck, Governor- General of British India. The Ropar Meeting between Maharaja Ranjit Singh and the head of British India followed soon thereafter. The Maharaja saw this as a good occasion to get his son, Kharak Singh, acknowledged as his heir-apparent. Hari Singh Nalwa expressed strong reservations against any such move. The British desired to persuade Ranjit Singh to open the Indus for trade.  Legacy  'The Rock Aornos from Huzara. From Nature by General James Abbott 1850' Nalwa was also a builder. At least 56 buildings were attributed to him, which included forts, ramparts, towers, gurdwaras, tanks, samadhis, temples, mosques, towns, havelis, sarais and gardens. He built the fortified town of Haripur in 1822. This was the first planned town in the region, with a superb water distribution system. His very strong fort of Harkishengarh, situated in the valley at the foothill of mountains, had four gates. It was surrounded by a wall, four yards thick and 16 yards high. Nalwa's presence brought such a feeling of security to the region that when H√ºgel visited Haripur in 1835-6, he found the town humming with activity. A large number of Khatris migrated there and established a flourishing trade. Haripur, tehsil and district, in Hazara, North-West Frontier Province, are named after him.Tehsils & Unions in the District of Haripur ‚Äì Government of Pakistan Nalwa contributed to the prosperity of Gujranwala, which he was given as a jagir sometime after 1799, which he held till his death in 1837. He built all the main Sikh forts in the trans-Indus region of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa ‚Äî Jehangira and Nowshera on the left and right bank respectively of the river Kabul, Sumergarh (or Bala Hisar Fort in the city of Peshawar), for the Sikh Kingdom. In addition, he laid the foundation for the fort of Fatehgarh, at Jamrud (Jamrud Fort). He reinforced Akbar's Attock fort situated on the left bank of the river Indus by building very high bastions at each of the gates. He also built the fort of Uri in Kashmir. A religious man, Nalwa built Gurdwara Panja Sahib in the town of Hassan Abdal, south-west of Haripur and north-west of Rawalpindi, to commemorate Guru Nanak's journey through that region. He had donated the gold required to cover the dome of the Akal Takht within the Harmandir Sahib complex in Amritsar. Following Hari Singh Nalwa's death, his sons Jawahir Singh Nalwa and Arjan Singh Nalwa fought against the British to protect the sovereignty of the Kingdom of the Sikhs, with the former being noted for his defence in the Battle of Chillianwala.  Plaudits  A tribute to the Champion of the Khalsaji. Hari Singh Nalwa's leadership qualities continued to inspire the Sikhs 81 years after his death (front page of a book published in 1918) A commemorative postage stamp was issued by the Government of India in 2013, marking the 176th anniversary of Nalwa's death.  Death  Hari Singh Nalwa died fighting the Pathan forces of Dost Mohammed Khan of Afghanistan. He was cremated in the Jamrud Fort built at the mouth of the Khyber Pass in Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. Babu Gajju Mall Kapur, a Hindu resident of Peshawar, commemorated his memory by building a memorial in the fort in 1892.  Popular culture  Hari Singh Nalwa's life became a popular theme for martial ballads. His earliest biographers were poets, including Qadir Bakhsh urf Kadaryar, Misr Hari Chand urf Qadaryaar and Ram Dayal, all in the 19th century. In the 20th century, the song Mere Desh Ki Dharti from the 1967 Bollywood film Upkaar eulogises him. Amar Chitra Katha first published the biography of Hari Singh Nalwa in 1978 (see List of Amar Chitra Katha comics). On April 30, 2013 Kapil Sibal released a commemorative postage stamp honouring Hari Singh.  Notes  References = Citations  Sources           Further reading   * *Niara, Gurabacana (1995).

However, Berlin said, \\"I never meant it very seriously. I meant it as a kind of enjoyable intellectual game, but it was taken seriously. Every classification throws light on something\\".. Origins The title is a reference to a fragment attributed to the Ancient Greek poet Archilochus: (\\"a fox knows many things, but a hedgehog one important thing\\"). In Erasmus's Adagia from 1500, the expression is recorded as Multa novit vulpes, verum echinus unum magnum. The fable of The Fox and the Cat embodies the same idea. Summary Berlin expands upon this idea to divide writers and thinkers into two categories: hedgehogs, who view the world through the lens of a single defining idea (examples given include Plato, Lucretius, Dante Alighieri, Blaise Pascal, Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, Friedrich Nietzsche, Henrik Ibsen, Marcel Proust and Fernand Braudel), and foxes, who draw on a wide variety of experiences and for whom the world cannot be boiled down to a single idea (examples given include Herodotus, Aristotle, Desiderius Erasmus, William Shakespeare, Michel de Montaigne, Moli√®re, Johann Wolfgang Goethe, Aleksandr Pushkin, Honor√© de Balzac, James Joyce and Philip Warren Anderson). Turning to Leo Tolstoy, Berlin contends that at first glance, Tolstoy escapes definition into one of the two groups. He postulates that while Tolstoy's talents are those of a fox, his beliefs are that one ought to be a hedgehog and so Tolstoy's own voluminous assessments of his own work are misleading. Berlin goes on to use this idea of Tolstoy as a basis for an analysis of the theory of history that Tolstoy presents in his novel War and Peace. In the latter half of the essay, Berlin illuminates Tolstoy by an extended comparison between him and the early 19th-century thinker Joseph de Maistre, a comparison that gains in piquancy because while Tolstoy and de Maistre held violently contrasting views on more superficial matters, they held some profoundly similar views about the fundamental nature of existence and the limits of a rational, scientific approach to it. In the final few paragraphs of the essay, Berlin reasserts his thesis that Tolstoy was by nature a fox but by conviction a hedgehog and goes on to say that the division within himself caused him great pain at the end of his life. The essay has been published separately and as part of the collection Russian Thinkers, edited by Henry Hardy and Aileen Kelly. The essay also appears in a widely representative anthology of Berlin's essays, The Proper Study of Mankind. Influence Some authors such as Michael Walzer have used the same pattern of description for Berlin himself, as a person who knows many things, compared to the purported narrowness of many other contemporary political philosophers. Berlin's former student, Canadian philosopher Charles Taylor, has been dubbed a hedgehog by Berlin and readily admitted to it in an interview after receiving the 2007 Templeton Prize.. Philip E. Tetlock, a political psychology professor at the University of Pennsylvania, drew heavily on this distinction in his exploration of the accuracy of experts and forecasters in various fields (especially politics) in his 2005 book Expert Political Judgment: How Good Is It? How Can We Know?. In his Founding Brothers about key figures of the American Revolution, the historian Joseph Ellis, uses Berlin's \\"Hedgehog and Fox\\" concept in evaluating George Washington, noting that \\"Washington was an archetypal hedgehog. And the one big thing he knew was that America's future as a nation lay to the West, in its development over the next century of a continental empire,\\" which was one of the reasons, according to Ellis, of Washington being devoted to construction of canals.. James C. Collins refers to the story in his book Good to Great where he clearly shows his preference towards Hedgehog mentality. Claudio V√©liz uses Berlin's construction to contrast Anglo-American and Spanish patterns of settlement and governance in his 1994 book The New World of the Gothic Fox Culture and Economy in English and Spanish America. The artist Richard Serra referenced the name in the title of his sculpture installed at Princeton University campus in 2000. Legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin's book Justice for Hedgehogs (2011), which argues the case for a single, overarching, and coherent framework of moral truth, takes its title from Berlin's conceit of the hedgehog. Music historian Berthold Hoeckner applies and extends Berlin's distinction in his 2007 essay \\"Wagner and the Origin of Evil\\". One of Hoeckner's key insights is that the historiography of Wagner's antisemitism, much like that of the Holocaust, has two main branches: a hedgehog-like functionalist branch that sees the composer's polemic jabs at Jewish culture as mere assimilationist rhetoric, and a fox-like intentionalist branch that sees them instead as violent expressions of genuinely eliminationist Judenhass. In his book Wittgenstein's Place in Twentieth-Century Analytic Philosophy, Oxford philosopher Peter Hacker uses this metaphor to contrast Berlin's Tolstoy, \\"a fox by nature, but a hedgehog by conviction\\", with the Austrian-born philosopher Ludwig Wittgenstein, who was \\"by nature a hedgehog, but after 1929 transformed himself, by great intellectual and imaginative endeavour, into a paradigmatic fox\\".Hacker, P. M. S. (1996), Wittgenstein's Place in Twentieth Century Analytic Philosophy (Blackwell, Oxford, UK and Cambridge, Mass., USA), p. 98 In his 2012 The New York Times bestselling book The Signal and the Noise, forecaster Nate Silver urges readers to be \\"more foxy\\" after summarising Berlin's distinction. He cites the work of Philip E. Tetlock on the accuracy of political forecasts in the United States during the Cold War while he was a professor of political science at the University of California, Berkeley. Silver's news website, fivethirtyeight.com, when it was launched in March 2014, also adopted the fox as its logo \\"as an allusion to\\" Archilochus' original work. In 2018, the author John Lewis Gaddis refers to Berlin's essay as well as the work of Tetlock in his book On Grand Strategy. In Woody Allen's 1992 film Husbands and Wives, the character of Sally, played by Judy Davis, muses while having sex about various people she knows as to whether they are Hedgehogs or Foxes. Philosopher of art Peter Kivy refers to Berlin's essay when he contrasts current philosophy of art as the age of the Fox, best represented by No√´l Carroll, to the previous age of the Hedgehog, best represented by Arthur Danto. Harvard political economist Dani Rodrik applies the distinction to \\"hedgehog\\" mainstream orthodox economists who apply \\"the Liberal Paradigm\\" to everything everywhere always and \\"fox\\" heterodox (political) economists who have different answers to different times, places, and situations in his 2015 book Economics Rules: The Rights and Wrongs of the Dismal Science.Rodrik, Dani (2015).

Notable features It is notable due to large portion of the game content and its core mechanics, the Solar System have been released under a Creative Commons license, as well as being published using only Open Source tools. TSoY won Best Free Game of the Year at the 2004 Indie RPG Awards, and was a runner-up for the 2004 Indie Game of the Year. Translations The Shadow of Yesterday has been translated intoFinnish (2006), Spanish (2007), German (2007) and Polish (two editions: abridged in 2009 and a new, extended and modified in 2011, also published on paper in a short limited run of 250 copies). An Italian translation is in the works. Eero Tuovinen, the editor of the Finnish version, republished an edited and slightly revised generic version of the core rules as \\"Solar System\\" in 2008. Setting The Shadow of Yesterday takes place in Near, a post- apocalyptic fantasy world set three hundred years after the destruction of the previous civilization. It is undergoing a rebirth. The races in TSOY (elves, goblins, and ratkin) are not seen as genetically separate races at all, but rather an evolution or devolution from human. Each of them can inclusively become \\"human\\" if they give up what makes them different. The setting differs depending on the release. The Finnish edition has expanded the setting with minor cultures and other details and a revised map. The Spanish setting is faithful in regards to the text but has an entirely new map. The German setting has additions inspired by online discussions, but not to the extent of the Finnish version. The World of Near for Solar System is a separate 190-page treatment of the setting from the creator of the Finnish translation. The Polish version combines the original setting with rules modifications taken from The World of Near for Solar System and original rules expansions and modifications; it also includes a map from Spanish edition. History , the game has been through two revisions. The second edition has different cover art and more game detail, but its primary observable difference is Nixon's move to using FUDGE dice.

The band's last concert film and album, released on 19 November 2012, took their name from this song. Composition and recording The song starts with guitar chords played over a monotonic drone created by a synthesiser. This connects the song musically with the preceding track on the album, \\"Friends\\", which ends with the same drone. Originally, one of John Bonham's drum tracks was to be used in the intro of \\"Celebration Day\\", but an engineer accidentally erased the recording. Unable or unwilling to re-record it, they used the synthesizer drone from the end of \\"Friends\\" to fill up the gap.Interview with Jimmy Page , Guitar World magazine, 1993 The recording took place at Headley Grange, England, with the Rolling Stones' mobile recording studio. Robert Plant's lyrics were inspired by his initial impressions of New York City.

The southern section, between Hilo and Kailua-Kona is numbered as Route 11. The section between Hilo and Waimea is Route 19. Between Waimea and Kailua-Kona, the road is split in two: the original \\"mauka\\" route (now Route 190) and a \\"makai\\" Route 19, completed in 1975, which serves as access to the Kona and Kohala Coast resorts. In the Hawaiian language, mauka means \\"towards the mountain\\" and makai means \\"towards the sea\\". These terms are commonly used in travel directions. Parts of the southern half of the Hawaii Belt Road were known during the Territorial days as the Ka≈´ Belt Road. The names \\"Hawaii Belt Road\\" and \\"MƒÅmalahoa Highway\\" refer to the road system that encircles the entire island; many sections are also referenced by local names. History MƒÅmalahoa Highway was named for the royal decree by King Kamehameha I after an incident he and his party experienced in 1783. As he prepared to unite the islands of Hawaii, Kamehameha I would conduct shoreline raids on the neighboring ahupuaa (traditional land divisions). It was on one such incursion that the King's warriors encountered two local fishermen along the Puna coast. The two fled to warn others of the pending attack and Kamehameha and his men took chase. When they crossed a lava field, one of the King's feet got caught in a crevice. The fishermen, seizing the opportunity to retaliate, returned and attacked. In the ensuing brawl, one of the King's steersmen was killed and Kamehameha himself received a blow to the head that was so hard that it splintered the man's weapon ‚Äì a solid koa canoe paddle. The two Puna men escaped. Kamehameha I opted not to retaliate but instead took this as a lesson: The strong must not mistreat the weak, his people must be assured protection from harm's way in their pursuits and that safe passage must be everyone's entitlement. A decade later, King Kamehameha I, upon reflecting on his deliverance that day in Puna and on the memory of his fallen warrior, proclaimed Ke KƒÅnƒÅwai MƒÅmalahoe ‚Äì \\"The Law of the Splintered Paddle\\" ‚Äì at Kahaleioleole in the Kaipalaoa area of Hilo. is considered such an important law to the Hawaiians that at the 1978 Constitutional Convention it was added to the Constitution of Hawaii. In it, the law protects the public and the safety of all who travel throughout the Islands, including fishermen, gatherers, hunters and visitors alike. : Hawaii Constitution (Article IX, Section 10) ‚Äî Public Safety : The Law of the Splintered Paddle, , [as] decreed by Kamehameha I, [that] every elderly person, woman and child lie by the roadside in safety, shall be a unique and living symbol of the State's concern for public safety. The State shall have the power to provide for the safety of the people from crimes against persons and property. : (Add ConCon 1978 and election November 7, 1978.) The MƒÅmalahoa trail was a foot trail built in the nineteenth century, which developed into this highway. Various parts were widened and re-aligned over the years. Much of the Hawaii Belt Road through North Hilo and HƒÅmƒÅkua districts was built on the roadbed and bridges of the Hawaii Consolidated Railway as part of the recovery from a tsunami that ravaged the island's northeast coast in 1946. In 2007, Queen Ka‚Äòahumanu Highway was widened to four lanes from Henry Street in Kailua-Kona to Kealakehe Parkway. In September 2015, ground broke to extend the widening project from Kealakehe Parkway to KeƒÅhole Airport Road, which provides access to Ellison Onizuka Kona International Airport. The project is expected to cost $105 million and be completed in November 2018. Route description=Route 11 The mile 0 marker is at the intersection of Kamehameha Avenue (Route 19), Banyan Drive and Kanoelehua Avenue in Hilo. After about a mile is the intersection with P≈´ƒÅinak≈ç Street (Route 2000), which connects to the Saddle Road. Route 11 then continues along Kanoelehua Avenue towards Keaau where it becomes Volcano Highway near milepost 4 before crossing into Puna District. Volcano Highway intersects with the terminus of Keaau-PƒÅhoa Road (Route 130) past mile 6 and Old Keaau-PƒÅhoa Road (Route 130), then continues through the towns of Kurtistown, Mountain View, Glenwood and Volcano Village. A sign across the road from the Hawaii Volcanoes National Park entrance Just beyond the Ka≈´ District line, the entrance to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park at mile 28 marks another name change, back to MƒÅmalahoa Highway. The two lane road crests () just before the mile 30 marker and then heads down a long downhill stretch through the Ka≈´ desert towards the black sands of Punaluu Beach Park, passing macadamia orchards near the town of PƒÅhala at mile 51 and the Sea Mountain Resort in Nƒ´nole at mile 56. Next are NƒÅƒÅlehu (mile 63), the southernmost community in the US, and Wai≈çhinu (mile 65) which was a retreat for Mark Twain. A winding uphill climb yields to a meandering country lane where South Point Road, near mile 69, leads to Ka Lae (south point). Another comfortable stretch of two lane road and a return to highway speeds begins past the mile 71 marker. MƒÅmalahoa Highway crosses Mauna Loa's 1907 Lava Flow ‚Äî there is a scenic point at mile 75 ‚Äî before passing through Ocean View between Tiki Lane and Aloha Boulevard. Just past mile 82 is the South Kona District line. Starting at mile 89, MƒÅmalahoa Highway has sharp curves and a steep drop-off along the coastal side. Many small fishing villages dot the coast, including Milolii, PƒÅpƒÅ Bay, Kona Paradise and Hookena. The macadamia orchards soon give way to another tree crop. This is Kona coffee Country. Keala o Keawe Road (Route 160), just before mile 104, serves as access to Puuhonua o H≈çnaunau National Historic Park and St. Benedict's Catholic Church. Further along is the town of Captain Cook, named for the famed English explorer Captain James Cook. NƒÅp≈çopoo Road (Route 160) leads down to NƒÅp≈çopoo and Kealakekua Bay, site of the monument to Cook's death. After mile 111 come the towns of Kealakekua, Kainaliu and Honalo. At \\"Coffee Junction\\" (mile 114), MƒÅmalahoa Highway continues straight and eventually becomes Route 180, Route 11 veers to left and becomes Kuakini Highway. A stretch from Honalo and then along the upper road until it rejoins the main Belt Road at Palani Junction is under consideration to be designated a National Scenic Byway. It was called the Kona Heritage Corridor by the state. A somewhat steep descent off Puuloa drops into the town of Kailua-Kona. Just past Lako Street is where Kuakini Highway branches to the left and Highway 11 becomes Queen Kaahumanu Highway. In the vicinity of mile 121, HualƒÅlai Road (Route 182, incorrectly signed as \\"180\\") crosses at an exaggerated angle (a rare concurrent route). Route 11 finally reaches the crossroads of the ‚ÄúQueen K‚Äù and Palani Road, pinpointing the termini of all three Hawaii Belt Road route numbers. 1960 Tsunami memorial clock Route 19 Tucked away at the gates to Hilo Wharf on K≈´hi≈ç Street is the mile 0 marker for Route 19. One block later, it then turns right onto Kalanianaole Avenue, running between the waters of Hilo Bay and the Runway 8/26 of Hilo International Airport, before crossing Kanoelehua Avenue (Route 11) and Banyan Drive where the name changes to Kamehameha Avenue. Flanking the Wailoa River (Hawaii) Bridge is the 1960 Tsunami Memorial Clock with its hands frozen at the moment the killer waves struck early morning on May 23, 1960. The highway continues along Kamehameha Avenue, paralleling a closed section of Bayfront Highway (used as access and parking for Hilo Bayfront Park), then turns right onto Pauahi Street before quickly turning left onto the open section of Bayfront Highway. Bayfront Highway, which serves as a bypass for the downtown business district of Hilo, is often closed to traffic by the Hawaii County Police Department in times of high surf. Past the intersection with WaiƒÅnuenue Avenue (Route 200, known as the Saddle Road), Route 19 crosses over the Wailuku River via a converted railroad plate girder bridge with a metal grate roadway that causes tires to ‚Äúsing‚Äù as vehicles pass over it. Leaving Hilo, the route assumes the name Hawaii Belt Road, leaving MƒÅmalahoa Highway to the older decommissioned portions of the original thoroughfare. Many former sugarcane plantation towns dot the highway, including Wainaku, Paukaa and PƒÅpaikou. Shortly after the mile 7 marker, part of the old MƒÅmalahoa Highway crosses Hawaii Belt Road. The road to the right leads down the ‚ÄúOnomea Scenic Drive,‚Äù a loop road that crosses several one-lane wooden bridges and past the Hawaii Tropical Botanical Garden overlooking Onomea Bay before returning to Hawaii Belt Road at mile 10 in Pepeeke≈ç. Hawaii Belt Road crosses over Kolekole Beach Park Hawaii Belt Road meets the rugged HƒÅmƒÅkua coastline near mile 12. A left turn onto Honom≈´ Road (Route 220) leads to Akaka Falls State Park, home of the namesake tall waterfall and the slightly shorter Kah≈´nƒÅ Falls. These waters empty in the Pacific Ocean at Kolekole Beach Park past mile 14. The Hakalau Bridge carries Route 19 from the South Hilo District to North Hilo District. A number of cascades are visible from the road on the ‚Äúmauka‚Äù side of the highway. Umauma Falls lies inside the World Botanical Gardens, but two other falls are viewed from the Umauma Bridge (between mile 16 and mile 17). Between mile 18 and mile 19 is NƒÅnue Stream with another picturesque waterfall. The highway negotiates three sharp curves: Maulua (mile 22), LaupƒÅhoehoe (mile 26) and Kaawalii (mile 28). Maulua Gulch has a small waterfall emptying into the ocean (visible from the Hilo side by looking across the gulch) and another in the back part of the gorge near the base of the radio tower. Also, an abandoned railroad tunnel is sometimes visible from the HƒÅmƒÅkua side. The LaupƒÅhoehoe Railroad Museum is located on the ‚Äúmauka‚Äù side past mile 25. On the other side of LaupƒÅhoehoe Gulch, an access road leads down to LaupƒÅhoehoe Point Beach Park where the victims of the 1946 ‚ÄúApril Fool‚Äôs Day‚Äù tsunami are memorialized. Past Kaawalii Gulch lie the much-welcomed passing lanes as Highway 19 goes by the old sugarmill town of O≈çkala. The HƒÅmƒÅkua District begins on the opposite side of Kaula Bridge (mile 30). Highway speeds are now the norm but caution must be observed when crossing the narrow ‚ÄúCurved Bridge‚Äù near mile 32. This bridge was replaced in May 2010 by a new bridge with less curvature. Hamlets with names like K≈´kaiau, Paauilo, Kal≈çpƒÅ and PƒÅauhau were once homes for sugar plantation workers from places like the Philippines, China and Japan. MƒÅmane Street (Route 240, mile 42) spurs off to the right to become the main street of Honokaa before providing access to Waipio Valley. Old MƒÅmalahoa Highway branches uphill to wind through rugged hills of ƒÄhualoa and is a scenic but slower route to Waimea. Meanwhile, Hawaii Belt Road makes its way through fog-shrouded eucalyptus stands. The Old MƒÅmalahoa Highway rejoins Route 19 near mile 52 where they cross into South Kohala District. Now again called MƒÅmalahoa Highway, Route 19 continues into the town of Waimea (known as Kamuela by the Post Office), the headquarters for Parker Ranch and the heart of paniolo (Hawaiian cowboy) country. A \\"Mamalohoa Highway\\" sign at the intersection in Waimea where Route 19, coming from right, makes a right turn, and where Route 190 depart to left. At mile 57, the route turns right onto Lindsey Road (see Route 190). One block down, Route 19 spurs left onto Kawaihae Road, past a row of restaurants and before starting downhill towards the coast. Just beyond mile 59 is a ‚ÄúY‚Äù junction with Kohala Mountain Road (Route 250) in front of Hawaii Preparatory Academy. Queen Kaahumanu Highway begins at the \\"T\\" intersection with Akoni Pule Highway (Route 270) past mile 67 outside Kawaihae. Completed in 1975, ‚ÄúThe Queen K‚Äù connects the resort properties of Mauna Kea Beach (mile 68), Mauna Lani (mile 73), Waik≈çloa Beach (mile 76) and Ka≈´p≈´lehu (mile 87) with the KeƒÅhole-Kona International Airport (mile 83) and the town of Kailua-Kona. Some beaches include HƒÅpuna, Holoholokai, Anaehoomalu, Makalawena, Kekaha Kai State Park and Kaloko-Honok≈çhau. The terminus of Route 19 is at the crossroads of Palani Road (Route 190) at mile 100 where Queen Kaahumanu Highway continues as Route 11. Route 190 Route 190 The continuation of MƒÅmalahoa Highway from the Lindsey Road (Route 19) intersection is the beginning of Route 190 with the mile 0 marker posted on the corner. This was the original Hilo-to-Kona link which served as Highway 19 until the route was reassigned in 1975 to the newly opened Queen Kaahumanu Highway along the coast. The road subsequently runs past Camp Tarawa, the Parker Ranch headquarters and the Waimea-Kohala Airport before traversing the rolling pasturelands of the South Kohala District. Few intersections are found along the next . Saddle Road (Route 200) comes to its western terminus near mile 6 and Waik≈çloa Road ends its climb from Queen Kaahumanu Highway at MƒÅmalahoa Highway's mile 11 marker. There are some sharp curves as the old road passes Puu Lani Ranch (mile 20) in Puuanahulu and the entrance to Puu Waawaa Forest Reserve. A long narrow strip of asphalt stretches across the windswept rangelands and lava fields covered with fountain grass. As the road passes through a stand of eucalyptus and ohia trees near mile 31, the upland neighborhoods of the North Kona District come into view: Kalaoa, Kona Palasades Estates, Koloko Mauka and Honok≈çhau. On the other side of mile 35, a traffic light at the top of Hina Lani Street provides access to a Costco store. At a 3-way intersection, the MƒÅmalahoa Highway turns left and becomes Route 180, while Route 190 continues straight, becoming Palani Road. Palani descends steeply towards Kailua-Kona, making many quick turns and narrow curves. Palani Road meets Queen Kaahumanu Highway, marking the end of the route, though Palani Road continues downhill to its junction with Kuakini Highway and Alii Drive.

According to the 2011 census, the town of Drenas had 6,143 inhabitants, while the municipality had 58,531 inhabitants. Geography and population Glogovac municipality is located in central Kosovo, between the ƒåiƒçavica mountains in the east and the Drenica hills in the north and west. The main road from Pristina to Peja crosses the municipality. At a junction at Komorani village, a smaller road extends north from the highway, passing through Glogovac town and continuing to Skenderaj. There are a total of 36 villages in the municipality, including the town of Glogovac. The municipality's population prior to the 1999 bombing was approximately 58,579 made up almost entirely of Albanians, with a small number of Serbs and others only in the Glogovac town. No minorities remained in the municipality, thus Glogovac today reflects a mono-ethnic environment.  History  Train passing the \\"Guri i Plakes\\" in Dobro≈°evac (Dritan) The municipality of Glogovac was established before World War II. During Yugoslavia economic growth was low. Lately, there has been a gradual improvement in economic, agricultural, educational, medical and industrial growth. Municipal development has affected the construction of network- educational system, health and service network intensifying agricultural development has become especially after the construction of the irrigation system \\"Iber Lepenci\\", while a positive movement for the economy of Glogovac is marked by complex building \\"Ferronikeli\\". Prior and during the Kosovo War (1998‚Äì99), the ethnic Albanian separatist Kosovo Liberation Army (KLA) had a strong level of influence and during the war controlled large areas of the municipality. Drenica, including the Glogovac municipality was consequently badly affected. During the war, there were instances of massacres carried out by Yugoslav forces. Mass graves were later exhumed in an attempt to conceal crimes.  Services, media and organizations = Internet services  The strongest local Internet providing company at the area at the time is Kujtesa. Other companies like Sky Net and Galaktika were established after the war at 2002 and are some of leading companies at the region.  Local and international NGOs  The presence of the international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) in the municipality remains unchanged. The number of international NGOs is reduced, while their activity level can be described as modest. Only the International Committee of Red Cross (ICRC) continues to be based in Glogovac while the few other international NGOs working in Glogovac are mainly based in Pristina. These include Swiss CARITAS and the Danish Refugee Council (DRC). The most prominent local NGOs are Mother Theresa Society (MTS), the ‚ÄòCouncil for Defense of Human Rights and Freedoms‚Äô, Shpresa, Aureola, Gresa, Nora, and Handikos. The KLA War Veterans Association, KLA Invalids Association, Friends of KPC, Pensioners Association, Glogovac Hearing Impaired Association, Union Fund of the Republic of Kosova (UFORK) or the so- called \\"Bukoshi Fund\\" are active in the municipality as well.  Local media  There are no local newspapers, except two temporary magazines \\"Realiteti\\" (a youth magazine) and \\"Spektri\\" (local magazine). However, there are four correspondents residing in Glogovac working for major newspapers based in Pristina. There are two Radio Stations, \\"92.1 Capital FM\\" broadcasting on a regional coverage, and \\"Radio Dodona\\" of which at the moment is not operating for unknown reasons, and there is a local TV station \\"Star TV\\" broadcasting on cable only.  Police, civil protection, and military presence  Police in Glogovac is under the KPS management since July 2003. 15 UNMIK International police officers are mainly assisting and advising. The number of KPS is 99. They are all Kosovo Albanians. The Norwegian Kosovo Force (KFOR) contingent was taken over by the Finnish Battalion of KFOR in July 2003. The Finnish team enjoy the support of the community and has excellent co-operation with UNMIK Police, UN Civil Administration, Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe and other members of international and local communities. The Kosovo Protection Corps (KPC), a civilian defence unit and the successor of the KLA, numbers 60 members and is still dependent on the Regional Training Group (RTG) 1 Zone located in Skenderaj.  Economy  UNMIK, KFOR and NGOs are the main employers in the municipality, while the majority of the population is employed in family-owned, small sized, private businesses like shops, car washes, and petrol stations. Most businesses have officially registered with UNMIK. Glogovac is an agricultural-based, rural municipality with wheat and maize as the primary crops. Before the conflict, a socially owned agricultural enterprise dominated the production but was destroyed. As a result, a large portion of the arable land is not cultivated as of today. The cattle farm in Krajkovo is now utilised as the temporary community shelter. The Ferronikel Factory provided jobs for more than 2,000 people at the peak of its production in 1988. Heavy damages were inflicted on the facility during the 1999 conflict, leaving it inoperable. Nevertheless, the recently privatised factory is still contributing to the infrastructure of Glogovac town with power, including water supply and an electric grid. A major development is the building of the Trade Centre in Glogovac town, which was completed by mid-2004. The municipality played a central role in the whole process by co-ordinating the financing, construction and management of the project. The Trade Centre contains 134 shops and offices for small businesses. Two quarries at Korrotic√´ e Ul√´t and √áikatov√´ e Vjeter have become operational since the conflict. There are four nickel mines operating at the territory of Glogovac: ƒåikatovo, Dushkaja, Gllavica and Suke.  Infrastructure  The roads in the municipality range from good to poor. The main road has been redone. Local roads in the town and roads in the majority of villages remain a primary concern. During rainy or icy weather conditions it is difficult to reach some of the more remote villages due to the poor road conditions. All over the municipality there is a great lack of appropriate sewage systems in place, although in some areas the system was rehabilitated during 2001 and 2002. Telephone land lines are operational and the usage of mobile phones is the main form of communication. Electricity is available with daily power cuts, similar to the rest of the country. Latest developments include work done on the sewage network in Bushat and Drenasi II, construction of Court building and restoration of the Town Hall. Furthermore, the decision by EAR to discontinue the housing reconstruction program negatively impacted on the municipality where 1171 homes remain to be rebuilt.  Social services, health, and education  According to the information from the Social Centre, there are 2,166 families receiving social assistance. A specialized team is dispatched to deal with traumatized people and domestic violence problems. A Health Center and six small Clinics serve the immediate need of population in Glogovac. A lack of sufficient amount of medicine and specialized equipment is notable. The outstanding issue of reimbursing the additional staff has been a major issue during 2003 and 2004. Despite the allocation of funds during the course of last year, no similar provisions have been made for 2004. In 2002 eight new buildings, including elementary schools and one pre-primary school were built, while in 2003 an additional primary school was constructed. In Glogovac municipality there are 21 primary schools, 2 secondary schools and 2 pre-primary school. The quality of teachers is less than desirable as many of them do not have the necessary qualifications. The overcrowding of schools presents one of the most persisting dilemmas for the municipality. The additional of ‚Äú9th‚Äù class has further overburdened an existing malfunctioning system. There is a need for more kindergarten facilities, pre-primary and primary schools, and upgrading of the existing schools. Another persisting problem is the effective de-politicization of educational institutes, intensive training for the teachers and revision of the curriculum.

She is also the founder of an adult film production company of the same name. Shane is a member of the AVN Hall of Fame.  Career  At the age of 17, she began working as a stripper. Shane started her adult film career in 1993. According to her Adult Video News magazine profile she and a girlfriend were impressed by a video made by Seymore Butts and decided to make a video of her own which she sent to him. He invited her to Los Angeles and soon after she began making videos with him and for other production companies. The videos she made with Butts became among the most popular titles in 'reality porn'. In 1994, Shane and Butts caused controversy when Shane performed a sex act on an volunteer firefighter at an Elmont, NY fire department without permission of the department for the video Seymore and Shane Playing with Fire. In addition to performing and appearing in Seymore Butts videos and those for her own production company, she worked predominantly in non-sex roles for a variety of adult film studios such as Evil Angel, Flying Leap Productions, Odyssey Entertainment, VCA Pictures, and Wicked Pictures. Shane broke up with her fianc√© Seymore Butts in 1995 and started her own production company, Shane's World. In the spring of 1998, Shane's line of videos became condom-only. In 1999, after the release of Shane‚Äôs World, Vol. 18: The Roller Coaster of Love, she retired from the adult industry to start a family with her husband. After her retirement, Shane was involved in a trademark dispute with two former employees: her personal assistant and cameraman, who go by the industry pseudonyms of Jennie and Brian Grant. This resulted in a licensing deal for the Shane's World name and the production company continued under the ownership of the Grants. Shane was inducted into the AVN Hall of Fame in 2005. In June 2007, Shane came out of retirement to shoot a video called Shane and Friends for Odyssey Video.  Directing  Shane's World movies revolve around taking porn stars out of their element on trips to exotic or interesting locations and filming everything that happens in a documentary style. The premise of the studio's movies can be summed up as \\"MTV's The Real World meets gonzo style pornography\\". Shane's World gave many stars their start, which helped to increase their fan base.  Personal life  Shane was born Shannon Hewitt in Simi Valley, California.

Throughout German- speaking countries, especially in Bavaria and Austria, he is famous for publicly criticizing the German government and political systems in general to a vast extent. His lyrics are like stories, as they mainly deal with being in conflict with the law and everyday life problems.  Biography  Johann Michael S√∂llner was born to a Catholic family in the Bavarian town of Bad Reichenhall on December 24, 1955. He attended school in the district of Marzoll, where, in his teenage years, he decided to grow out his hair in defiance of social convention. From 1970 to 1973, he trained to become a cook, but was eventually unable to find employment; a brief spell of mandatory service in the German armed forces failed to inspire a professional commitment ‚Äì neither did a subsequent apprenticeship as a mechanic. Unemployed on and off for years in Munich, S√∂llner took to music as he taught himself to play guitar and began to write his own songs. In 1979, he had his first live appearance at a small venue in Munich. After winning a singing competition three years later, he was offered a recording contract with the independent label PPM (Powerplay Music Records) and made his debut in 1983 with Endlich eine Arbeit. In 1986, PPM released the album F√ºr Marianne und Ludwig, followed a year later by Wos reimt se scho auf Nicki. S√∂llner left PPM for the well-regarded independent label Trikont, based in Munich, on which he made his debut with Hey Staat! (1989). Considered by many to be his greatest album, Hey Staat! established him as a protest singer and an up-and-coming talent in the alternative music scene. In 1989, he recorded the studio album Bayerman Vibration, which was released the following year and turned out to be an instant success. In 1991, S√∂llner and his band Bayerman Vibration released the album Live!, a record that is no longer being published and has hence become a rarity. In 1992, S√∂llner released Der Charlie, which is, along with Hey Staat!, thought of as one of his greatest and simultaneously most controversial works to date. Der Charlie includes a long narration of his 1986‚Äì1987 trip to Jamaica and its influence on him in terms not only of reggae music and marijuana use, but also politics and religion. In August 1993, S√∂llner announced that he was abandoning the Roman Catholic faith and converting to the Rastafari movement; he further declared himself a vegetarian and a pacifist. In 1995, he released the album Grea G√∂ib Roud, a studio record dedicated to a friend who had died. In 1997, he released the studio album a jeda. One year later, Trikont reissued his first three albums (Endlich eine Arbeit, F√ºr Marianne und Ludwig, and Wos reimt se scho auf Nicki), which had gone out of print following the demise of PPM. In the late 90s, S√∂llner was fighting criminal charges of cannabis cultivation and insulting public officials. He argued that it was his religious right as a Rastafarian to smoke marijuana, but was ultimately fined heavily and faced enormous legal expenses. In 2000, S√∂llner returned with 241255, a double album composed of various live recordings from the previous years. A year on, he released Babylon, another live album, which first featured the Austrian reggae band Bayaman'Sissdem. In 2004, he released Oiwei I, his first studio effort in seven years; like his other albums from this era, it features Bayaman'Sissdem. A live CD, Im Regen, followed in 2005. In 2007, S√∂llner and Bayaman'Sissdem returned with a new studio album, Viet Nam. On November 18, 2011, S√∂llner released the studio album Mei Zuastand, which features re-recorded songs from his entire career. On October 26, 2012 he released SoSoSo, a studio record that contains new songs. On 12. October 2018, S√∂llners new album \\"Genug\\" was released. It was the first album that contained new songmaterial since 2012¬¥s \\"SoSoSo\\" and the first album since 2000¬¥s \\"241255\\" on that he recorded all songs only with his acoustic guitar and without his band \\"Bayaman Sissdem\\". The only exception is the live version of the song \\"Rassist\\", which he recorded with the Dresden- based reggae combo \\"BANDA INTERNATIONALE\\" on the Afrika-Karibik-Festival in Wassertr√ºdingen.

It has several independent origins. One of the origins of the surname, in England and Wales, is from the Norman personal name Lowis, Lodovicus. This name is from the post-Classical Latin name Ludovicus meaning victorious in athletic games (ludus, game; vicus, var. of victor, winner).

In the United Kingdom Lewis is most commonly associated with Wales, and is a common Welsh Patronym. The name developed as an Anglicised or diminutive form of native Welsh names such as Llywelyn. Among the earliest examples being the Lewis family of Glamorgan in the 1540s.The National Library of Wales Other derivations include the Gaelic surname Mac Lughaidh, meaning \\"son of Lughaidh\\", which has also been Anglicised as Lewis. The surname Lewis is also an Anglicisation of several like-sounding Jewish surnames, which cited for the surname \\"Lewis\\". such as \\"Levy\\" or \\"Levi\\", and of the Arab form of the name \\"Elias\\".

It has about 7,000 inhabitants. Geography The town is located on the Mastn√≠k river, a tributary of the Vltava, about east of P≈ô√≠bram. It is the third largest municipality of P≈ô√≠bram District. History Sedlƒçany with St Martin Church, 1602 woodcut The settlement in the Duchy of Bohemia was first mentioned in a 1057 deed, when the area was colonised by the ruling P≈ôemyslid dynasty. A parish church dedicated to Saint Martin was erected about 1275, and already in 1294 Sedlƒçany held market rights. Then held by the V√≠tkovci Neuhaus (Hradec) family, the estates were given in pawn to the House of Rosenberg by King John of Bohemia in 1337. Sedlƒçany received town privileges in 1353 and numerous further royal privileges under the rule of Emperor Sigismund. Nevertheless the citizens joined the Hussite movement and during the Hussite Wars the town temporarily was controlled by radical Taborites. In 1475 the noble House of Lobkowicz took over Sedlƒçany in exchange for Ro≈æmberk Castle, given in pawn by the Bohemian chamberlain John II of Rosenberg in 1464. The Rosenbergs regained the town, however, in 1580 William of Rosenberg relinquished it to his custodian Jakub Krƒç√≠n. Upon his death in 1604 the last Rosenberg scion Peter Vok sold Sedlƒçany to the Bohemian chancellor Zdenƒõk Vojtƒõch Popel of Lobkowicz, who administered stern Counter- Reformation measures to its citizens. The town was devastated by Swedish troops during the Thirty Years' War and did not recover until the mid 18th century. From 1804 Sedlƒçany/Selƒçan was part of the Austrian Empire and after the Compromise of 1867 belonged to the Cisleithanian half of Austria-Hungary. The town was the administrative seat of a district (Bezirk) of the same name, one of the 94 Bezirkshauptmannschaften in the crown land of Bohemia.Die postalischen Abstempelungen auf den √∂sterreichischen Postwertzeichen-Ausgaben 1867, 1883 und 1890, Wilhelm KLEIN, 1967 Sedlƒçany developed to a centre of textile industry, the local economy was further promoted when the town received access to the railway line to Olbramovice in 1894. Under the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia the nearby SS-Truppen√ºbungsplatz B√∂hmen was laid out from 1941, whereby numerous villages were cleared and the inhabitants expelled. Economy For many decades, Sedlƒçany was famous for its production of Hermel√≠n cheese. However, in 2019 the production was moved by dairy's owner from Sedlƒçany to P≈ôibyslav.

Her career included 21 NCAA tournament appearances including a Final Four appearance in 2000, one AIAW national tournament appearance (1977, St. Joseph's), five Big Ten Conference championships and eight conference tournament titles (the first six in the Atlantic 10). Portland was one of a few women's basketball coaches to have won 600 or more games at a single school, with a career record of 606‚Äì236 at Penn State. Her notoriety grew when it was revealed that she had for decades discriminated against homosexual players on the Penn State women's basketball team. Career Born and raised in Broomall, Pennsylvania, Portland first became head coach at Penn State in 1980, following two seasons at St. Joseph's and two seasons at Colorado. Portland was previously one of the star players at Immaculata College, one of the early powers in women's college basketball, where Portland helped lead the team to three national titles. Several of her teammates also went on to become prominent women's coaches, such as Theresa Grentz and Marianne Stanley. Portland served 27 seasons as the Lady Lions head coach. She won over 600 games at Penn State, making her sixth in most wins in Division I women‚Äôs basketball. Although she had coached many Lady Lions teams to the NCAA tournament, she had been unable to win a national championship. Portland had a demonstrated commitment to charitable causes, most notably participating in the first annual ‚ÄúThink Pink‚Äù day to raise funds for breast cancer research. On March 22, 2007, Penn State Intercollegiate Athletics announced Portland's resignation, effective immediately. On April 23, 2007, the university announced Coquese Washington as her successor. Anti-lesbian controversy Portland forbade lesbian athletes in her program, as she explained in a newspaper article: The statement was made prior to adoption of Penn State's policy on nondiscrimination and harassment in 1991; however, according to the 2009 documentary film Training Rules, no action was taken against Portland's prohibition. In 2006, former player Jennifer Harris accused Portland of removing her from the team because of her perceived sexual orientation. Harris filed a federal lawsuit against Portland, athletic director Tim Curley, and the university. An internal university review found that Portland created a \\"hostile, intimidating, and offensive environment\\" based on Harris's perceived sexual orientation. Portland was fined $10,000, required to attend diversity training sessions, and placed on \\"zero tolerance\\" for future violations of the nondiscrimination policy. In responding to the sanctions, Portland stated that \\"the process that was used to reach these conclusions was flawed.\\" Kate Kendell, executive director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, said that \\"consequences faced by Rene Portland are insulting and inadequate.\\" In February 2007, the lawsuit was settled out of court‚Äîbefore Portland's resignation the following month‚Äîunder confidential terms and described in a joint statement as \\"amicable.\\" Despite being forced out of the Penn State job, many of her fellow Big Ten coaches continued to support her. The documentary film Training Rules, co-directed by Dee Mosbacher and Fawn Yacker, explores this issue further, interviewing numerous players about their experience with Portland and the anti-homosexual environment she perpetuated during her tenure. Under Portland‚Äôs 27-year career as Penn State‚Äôs women‚Äôs basketball coach (from the 1980‚Äì81 season through 2006-07), there were 113 student-athletes who appeared on the Penn State roster. Seven players from Portland‚Äôs final season remained on the squad when Coquese Washington became the next head coach. Hence, there were 106 players who concluded their time as Lady Lions under Portland. Of these, 57 completed 4-year college careers at Penn State; however, the rest (49, or nearly half) stayed less than four seasons. Thus, close to 46% of Portland‚Äôs players left Penn State while they still had college eligibility remaining. The comparable attrition rate under Washington has been 21%. USA Basketball In 1993, Portland served as an assistant coach to Head Coach Jim Foster at the FIBA Junior World Championship. The event was held in Seoul, South Korea August 1‚Äì8, 1993. The USA improved their record from the 1985 and 1989 events to 5‚Äì2, but that finish placed the team seventh overall. In 1997, Portland became the head coach of the USA team competing in the Junior World Championship. That event was held in Natal, Brazil July 5‚Äì13, 1997. After beating Japan in the opening game, the USA played defending champion Australia in the second round. Despite having a 13-point lead at one time, the USA let the lead slip away and lost 80‚Äì74. However, the USA team then went on to win a four-point game against Cuba, and won easily against Russia and Spain to move to the medal rounds. In the semi-final the USA team faced Slovakia, and won 90‚Äì77 to move the team into their first ever finals for a FIBA Junior World team. The final was against Australia who had beaten the US in the second game. The USA team had a three-point lead with three seconds to go, but Australia hit a three pointer to send the game to overtime. Australia scored first, the USA out scored the Australians 7‚Äì2 to take a small lead. The lead was down to two points with 30 seconds left in the game, but the USA hit free throws to win 78‚Äì74, notching the first ever gold medal for a Junior World Championship team from the USA. Portland served as the head coach of the USA representative to the 1999 World University Games (also known as the Universiade). The event was held in Palma de Mallorca, Spain. The USA team won their opening two games easily, including a mismatch against South Africa with a final score of 140‚Äì32, but lost against the Ukraine, 81‚Äì70. They earned a position in the medal rounds and defeated Lithuania in the quarterfinals. USA then took on undefeated Russia and won a close game 87‚Äì79, setting up the championship game between the US and host Spain. After falling behind early, the USA team kept the game close, and got within five points with under two minutes to go, but Spain held on to win the gold medal. The USA team received the silver medal. Death Portland died in Tannersville, Pennsylvania following a three-year battle with peritoneal cancer on July 22, 2018, aged 65.

It connects the Alabama state line with the city of Atlanta. The highway travels through Carrollton, McWhorter, and East Point. Except for the Carrollton and East Point/Atlanta areas, the highway is fairly rural. In Atlanta, it has a limited-access freeway portion that is known as the Arthur B. Langford Jr. Parkway (formerly named the Lakewood Freeway). SR 166 was originally the Georgia segment of U.S. Route 78S (US 78S), which was later redesignated as US 78 Alt. The Lakewood Freeway portion of this highway was, at one time, slated to become designated as Interstate 420 (I-420), but that project was cancelled. Route description Douglas County Carroll County SR 166 begins at the Alabama state line, on the northeastern edge of Ranburne, Alabama, where the roadway continues as Alabama State Route 46 (Main Street). It travels to the northeast, through Carroll County. After curving to an east- northeast direction, and then beginning an east-southeast routing, it crosses over Big Indian Creek. The highway enters Bowdon and curves back to the east- northeast just before intersecting the northern terminus of Elm Street. Just to the east of Griffins Alley, it curves to a due-east direction and intersects SR 100 (Wedowee Street/North Carroll Street). Almost immediately, the highway travels to the northeast. After leaving the city limits of Bowdon, and just before an intersection with Dixson Road and West Jonesville Road, SR 166 begins to curve to an easterly direction. It passes just north of Anderson Lake shortly before crossing over the Little Tallapoosa River. Nearly later, it enters the city limits of Carrollton. At an intersection with Maple Street, which leads to downtown Carrollton, SR 166 turns to the right onto what is essentially a bypass of the main part of the city. It passes to the south of Sunset Hills Country Club and then reaches the Wayne Shackelford Interchange with US 27/SR 1/SR 16 (Martha Berry Highway). SR 166 continues to the east- northeast, concurrent with SR 16, as well as US 27 Alt., which begins at that interchange. The three highways curve to the northeast and travel to the southeast of Richards Lake. At an intersection with Newnan Road, US 27 Alt./SR 16 depart to the southeast, while SR 166 continues to the northeast. Just after Old Newnan Road, it curves to a due-north direction. Just to the east of Lake Carroll, it intersects the eastern terminus of SR 166 Conn. (Northside Drive). At this intersection, SR 166 turns to the right, traveling northeast on Bankhead Highway. At an intersection with the southern terminus of SR 61 (Carrollton-Villa Rica Highway), SR 166/Bankhead Highway turn right and resume their eastward trek. They weave through rural portions of the county. At the Douglas county line, the Bankhead Highway name ends and the J. Ebb Duncan Memorial Highway name begins. Douglas County SR 166 continues winding its way through mainly farmland and rural areas on its way to McWhorter. Here, it intersects SR 5 (Bill Arp Road) by way of a traffic circle. A short distance after crossing over the Dog River, the highway begins paralleling the western shore of the Chattahoochee River. It travels through mostly wooded land on its way to an intersection with SR 70/SR 92/SR 154 (Campbellton- Fairburn Road). The four-highway concurrency travels to the north-northeast, bypassing the Boundary Waters Aquatic Center. The highways reach an intersection with Fairburn Road, where SR 92 departs to the north. At this same intersection, SR 70/SR 154/SR 166 turn right and travel to the southeast. They curve to the east-southeast and cross over the Chattahoochee River into southern Fulton County on the Dick Lane Bridge. Fulton County SR 70/SR 154/SR 166 continue to the east-southeast for about , where SR 70 departs the concurrency by turning left onto Fulton Industrial Boulevard SW. SR 154/SR 166 curve to the northeast and gradually travel in more of an eastern direction and enter Sandtown. Here, they intersect SR 6 (Camp Creek Parkway). Just over later, they pass Sandtown Middle School and Asa Philip Elementary School. After the schools is an entrance to Sandtown Park. The highways curve to the southeast and leave the city limits of Sandtown and enter those of Atlanta. They pass Southwest Atlanta Christian Academy and just north of Ben Hill Park. Less than later, the Arthur B. Langford Jr. Parkway designation begins, and then they have an interchange with Interstate 285 (I-285; Atlanta Bypass). Almost immediately, SR 154/SR 166 pass the Greenbriar Mall and have an interchange with Greenbriar Parkway. Just over later, along the Atlanta-East Point city line, they have an interchange with DeLowe Drive and Stanton Road. The highways enter East Point proper and have an interchange with US 29/SR 14/SR 139 (although the last two are not signed on the exit signs. At this interchange, SR 154 departs the concurrency to the north. SR 166 re-enters Atlanta and has an interchange with Sylvan Road and Cleveland Avenue. About later is an interchange with Perkerson Road, which leads to US 19/US 41/SR 3 (Metropolitan Parkway). SR 3 is not signed on the exit sign. Almost immediately is an interchange with I-75/I-85 (Downtown Connector). Approximately later, SR 166 and the Langford Parkway meet their eastern terminus, and interchange with Lakewood Avenue SW. History=1920s and 1930s The road that would eventually become SR 166 was established in 1920 as part of SR 34 from Carrollton to just northeast of the city (at today's intersection of SR 166 and SR 61). By the end of the third quarter of 1921, SR 16 was designated from the Alabama state line, west of Bowdon to Carrollton. By late 1926, SR 16 and SR 34 were redesignated as a southern branch of SR 8. In 1927, US 78 split into two divided routes, with US 78S being designated from Heflin, Alabama to just northeast of Carrollton, via Bowdon and Carrollton, on the southern branch of SR 8. By 1932, US 78S/SR 8 were paved from Carrollton to just northeast of town. In the middle of 1934, US 78S/SR 8 were paved from the Alabama state line to about Bowdon. By November of that year, US 78S was redesignated as US 78 Alt. In early 1936, US 78S/SR 8 were paved from Bowdon to Carrollton. In August 1938, SR 41 was designated along the current path of SR 70 on the east side of the Chattahoochee River. 1940s to 1960s At the end of 1940, SR 166 was designated from Carrollton to the SR 92 intersection northwest of Fairburn (this intersection currently also carries SR 70 and SR 154, as well). By April, it was extended across the Chattahoochee River and paralleled SR 41 to the east as it entered Atlanta on Campbellton Road, and intersected US 29 at Dill Avenue, farther north than it does today. Prior to the next year, all of the Fulton County section of SR 166 was paved. By the end of 1946, SR 41 was redesignated as SR 154\\\\. SR 92 and SR 166 traveled concurrently (as they do today). SR 166 crossed the Chattahoochee River farther to the north than it used to. SR 154 and SR 166 traveled concurrently from just east of the river to about the current SR 6 intersection. By the beginning of 1948, the southern branch of SR 8 was redesignated as SR 8 Alternate. Also, SR 166 was paved from the northern SR 92 intersection to the Chattahoochee River. In either 1952 or 1953, US 78 Alt. was decommissioned. By the middle of 1954, an extension of SR 74 was designated along SR 154/SR 166 west of Atlanta. By the middle of 1955, SR 8 Alternate was redesignated as SR 166 from the Alabama state line to northeast of Carrollton. Also, SR 166 was paved from northeast of Carrollton to McWhorter. By the middle of 1960, all of the then-current length of SR 166 was paved. By 1966, the limited-access portion of SR 166 was under construction from I-285 to US 19/US 41/SR 3. Later that year, the construction was complete along that section. In 1967. the extension of SR 70 was renumbered as part of SR 70. In 1969, the limited access portion was proposed to be extended from its current eastern terminus, at Lakewood Avenue, past SR 54 and McDonough Boulevard (today's SR 42 Spur) to end at a proposed piece of SR 400. 1970s to 2010s By the beginning of 1978, the proposed extension (and possibly the rest of the limited-access portion) was proposed to be designated as I-420. Also, the proposed eastern terminus was extended to I-20 between its crossing of Sugar Creek and its interchange with Gresham Road. Along the way, the proposed interchange with SR 400 was changed to one with the northern terminus of I-675. In 1985, the proposed northern part of I-675 and the I-420 proposal were both removed from the GDOT maps. Also, the yearly map reverted the eastern terminus back to I-75/I-85. In 1992, SR 154 was rerouted on a concurrency with SR 166, from just west of the Chattahoochee River to the interchange with US 29, as it does today. In 2007, SR 70 was partially rerouted from the east side of the Chattahoochee River to follow the SR 92/SR 154/SR 166 concurrency on the west side of the river and cross back over west of Atlanta. It wasn't until the 2015-2016 edition of GDOT's state map that the section from I-75/I-85 to Lakewood Avenue was returned to the map. Miscellaneous notes SR 166 was originally supposed to extend (as I-420) from I-20 near Douglasville in the west to the DeKalb County seat of Decatur in the east. The eastern portion of this was fought bitterly by residents in court, and was eventually cancelled, along with a number of other interstate highways in Atlanta. In 1995, the Georgia Senate moved to rename the then- Lakewood Freeway to the Arthur Langford, Jr. Memorial Parkway in honor of the former Atlanta City Councilman and Georgia State Senator. Since 2003, GDOT has widened SR 166 between Greenbriar Parkway and Perkerson Road. Major intersectionsRelated routes=Interstate 420 Interstate 420 (I-420) was an Auxiliary Interstate Highway that was planned to split off I-285 on the west side of Atlanta, then continue east to a point south of downtown Atlanta, merging at an interchange with proposed I-675 and traveling northeastward on to I-20 near Gresham Park. It would have had a length of . The only portion of it actually built was SR 166, known as Lakewood Freeway and now, Langford Parkway. The portion east of I-75/I-85 was never built, due to public opposition from communities in its path. I-675 was built, however, and currently travels between I-75 near Stockbridge in Henry County to I-285 near Panthersville in DeKalb County. If I-420 had been built, it would have had the hidden designation of State Route 414. I-420 was proposed in 1978, and was approved to be designated on September 29, 1983; had it been built, it would have cost $96.4 million. Carrollton connector route State Route 166 Connector (SR 166 Conn.) is a connector of SR 166 that is mostly within the city limits of Carrollton. It is entirely within Carroll County. It is known as Linda Lane from its western terminus to its intersection with SR 113 and Northside Drive from SR 113 to its eastern terminus. SR 166 Conn. begins at an intersection with US 27/SR 1 on the northern edge of Carrollton, where the roadway continues as Columbia Drive. The highway leaves the city limits and travels on a nearly due east direction until it intersects SR 113\\\\. It travels in a southeasterly direction and crosses over the Little Tallapoosa River, where it re-enters the city limits of Carrollton. After a gradual curve to the south-southeast, it meets its eastern terminus, an intersection with the SR 166 mainline. The highway was proposed in 1998 on a routing from Shady Grove Road to its current eastern terminus. In 2000, the proposal was extended to include all of its current length. In 2001, it was proposed to be numbered as SR 166 Spur, on at least the US 27/SR 1-to-SR 113 segment. In 2004, it was completed, and signed as SR 166 Conn.

Occupying a portion of Lloyd Road, SR 633 has its southern terminus at a signalized intersection with U.S. Route 20 (US 20) in Wickliffe. Its northern terminus is also in Wickliffe, but at a signalized intersection with Lakeland Boulevard (former SR 2), which provides access to current SR 2 freeway by way of a trumpet interchange just to the east. Route description The entirety of SR 633 is located within the city limits of Wickliffe in Lake County. The state route begins at a signalized intersection with US 20 (Euclid Avenue), and travels to the northwest from that point. It is bounded by a commercial real estate on the west side, and some small fields and woods on the east side through the Anderson Road intersection, after which commercial businesses appear on that side, as well. SR 633 then crosses a set of CSX and Norfolk Southern railroad tracks. Just after that crossing, the state highway comes to an end at a signalized intersection with Lakeland Boulevard, just three blocks southwest of a trumpet interchange that connects the SR 2 freeway with Lakeland Boulevard. Lloyd Road continues northwest after SR 633 terminates. It crosses underneath SR 2 a very short distance after the intersection. About 6,320 vehicles travel on SR 633 on average every day. For its entire length, SR 633 is a three-lane roadway, featuring one through lane in each direction plus a center-turn lane. History The 1923 Ohio Department of Highways map shows a road running along the corridor of modern SR 2 from Cleveland to Wickliffe, then turning south along the route of Lloyd Road to US 20 in Wickliffe. This routing is designated as a state highway by the 1932 map. On the 1939 map, the northeast-southwest road, now labelled as SR 2, is extended eastward, but the Lloyd Road section is still designated as a state highway. Starting with the 1940 Lake county map, this segment is labelled SR 633. In approximately 1963, SR 2 is rerouted onto the Lakeland Freeway, but SR 633's terminus remains at Lakeland Boulevard.

A typical assignment for a professional F√§nrik is as junior instructor of recruits. Finland The rank V√§nrikki is used in active service by reserve officers who remain in service as for 6-to-12-months-long volunteer contract period. In addition, it is the lowest reserve officer rank. Conscript officer The rank has been mainly a reserve rank. The future conscript officers are selected from the whole pool of conscripts. After a basic training of two months, a portion of the conscripts are selected for NCO training. After 2 months of NCO training, the most suitable are selected for reserve officer training and promoted to officer students. The 3¬Ω-month-long reserve officers training usually takes place in the Reserve Officer School, and afterwards, the candidates are promoted to officer cadets (). They serve the remaining 5¬Ω months of their conscription practicing as platoon commanders as well as training other conscripts. Finally, successful officer cadets are discharged with the rank of v√§nrikki. In the reserve, reserve officers may be promoted up to majuri (Major), although there have been extraordinarily promotions to everstiluutnantti (Lieutenant Colonel). The Navy equivalent rank is aliluutnantti (Sub-Lieutenant). If mobilization is effected, officers in the reserve fill most junior officer duties of the war-time Finnish army. Especially, most platoon and company commander positions and junior staff officer duties are filled with reservists. Professional officer The National Defence College accepts both reserve officers and reserve NCOs. Those cadets who did not receive reserve officer training during their conscription are usually promoted to the personal rank of v√§nrikki during their studies. However, upon graduation, professional officers are promoted to luutnantti. During the early 21st century, the National Defence College also had a one- year program to commission professional officers with the rank of v√§nrikki and a fixed service term of five years. The rank is the lowest commissioned officer rank. Formerly a school called Maanpuolustusopisto (MpO) had v√§nrikki as the rank given to new graduates. These officers were known as opistoupseeri (usually translated \\"Warrant Officer\\"), and could be promoted up to yliluutnantti, senior lieutenant, (company vice-commander), and later, to kapteeni (company commander). The opisto level ceased to exist in Finland (other schools were redefined as ammattikorkeakoulu) in the end of 1990's. However, in the military, the MpO was decommissioned. All officers are now trained by the National Defence College. Any existing MpO graduates may obtain further education to upgrade their degree to a university degree. Extraordinary Simo H√§yh√§, the deadliest sniper in history, was extraordinarily promoted to v√§nrikki, from alikersantti (Corporal), personally by Marshal Gustaf Mannerheim. Sweden Promotion requires passing out of the three-year program at the F√∂rsvarsh√∂gskolan (FHS). As F√§nrik the officer is typically a platoon leader at competence level A, (Basic).Karri√§rv√§garna f√∂r officerare. 2020-02-15. History The name of the rank means company color bearer (Ensign. The color was usually maintained by a non-commissioned officer, the F√∂rare or Colour Sergeant, and handed over to the F√§nrik just before a battle. His role was to align the company and the flag was an important tool in achieving that. This duty was highly prestigious, and as such, could not be trusted to other than an officer, but required no particular officer training. The F√§nrik together with the F√∂rare were responsible for the medical care within the company. The term F√§nika was used as a battalion sized military unit during the Middle Ages and Renaissance. 1835-1937 The corresponding rank in the cavalry was Kornett. In 1835 both F√§nrik and Kornett were replaced with the rank Underl√∂jtnant, but in 1914 the rank was reintroduced for newly promoted officers who only held a temporary commission for the first two years of service. F√§nrik had, however, the same rank as Underl√∂jtnant. By 1926 F√§nrik became junior to Underl√∂jtnant. In 1937 the rank Underl√∂jtnant was abolished. Reform 1972 Holders of the rank of F√§nrik were given the rank L√∂jtnant in the Regimental Officers Corps. Holders of the following ranks were given the rank F√§nrik, in the separate Company Officers Corps: *Fanjunkare (with less than 3 years of service) *Sergeant (with less than 3 years of service) Reform 1983 The meaning of the term officer broadened to include all professional and reserve military personnel. F√§nrik was subsequently set to be the lowest rank for professional and reserve military personnel. To be employed as an officer in the Armed Forces, the candidate was required to complete two years of Officers College (OHS). Reform 2009 The objective of the reform was to produce officers who are specialized at commanding troops at platoon, company and higher level as well as providing officers of academic status.

The current representative for District 64 is Republican Lynn Stucky, who succeeded Myra Crownover on January 9, 2017. District description (after 2000 Census) After the 2000 Census the district was realigned. The current District 64 is located wholly within Denton County. It is one of three serving Denton County. In terms of geography it runs diagonally from Denton in the northwest end to The Colony in the southeast, and includes nearly all of the area surrounding Lewisville Lake. Major cities in the district include Denton, The Colony, Corinth, Shady Shores, Lake Dallas. Hickory Creek, Little Elm, Lakewood Village, and Oak Point. District 64 also includes the University of North Texas, Texas Woman's University, and the Denton County campus of North Central Texas College. Prior incarnations of District 64 During the 1980s the district was located in West Texas. It is most notable as the home district (1984‚Äì1990) of Rick Perry who would later become Governor of Texas. Elections=2006 candidates Crownover ran unopposed in the Republican primary in 2006. John McLeod opposed Crownover as the Democratic candidate; the Libertarian Party did not field a candidate. Though McLeod reported outraising Crownover by a nearly 2-to-1 margin, indicating her support might have been in decline, Crownover won re-election 59.92% to 40.08% to serve District 64 in the Eightieth Texas Legislature. 2008 candidates Myra Crownover won an unopposed Republican Primary, earning 8,249 votes. John J. McClelland won an unopposed Democratic Primary, earning 10,854 votes. Jason Jordan was the Libertarian nominee. However, Crownover won re-election.  2014 candidates  Crownover was challenged in the Republican primary by Read King. Crownover won the primary with 54.97% of the vote to King's 45.03%. She was challenges by Democratic Party candidate Emy Lyons and Green Party candidate Braeden Wright. Crownover won reelection with 63.39% of the vote.  2016 candidates  Myra Crownover opted against running for reelection in 2016. Rick Hagen, Dr. Lynn Stucky, and Read King ran for the Republican nomination, while Connor Flanagan and Paul Greco ran for the Democratic nomination. Flanagan won 51.88% (4,077 votes) in the Democratic primary, narrowly defeating Greco, who won 48.12% (3,781 votes). No Republican yielded a majority on the March 1st vote so, per Texas law, the two candidates with the most votes ran in a runoff election.

It was used by the future emperor at his coronation on Christmas Day 800, when he placed three fingers of his right hand on the first page of the Gospel of Saint John and took his oath.Kunsthistorisches 1991, p. 168. Traditionally, it is considered to be the same manuscript that was found in the tomb of Charlemagne when it was opened in the year 1000 by Emperor Otto III. The Coronation Evangeliar cover was created by Hans von Reutlingen, c. 1500.Leithe-Jasper 2004, p. 55. The Coronation Evangeliar is part of the Imperial Treasury (Schatzkammer) in the Hofburg Palace in Vienna, Austria (Schatzkammer, Inv. XIII 18). History The Coronation Evangeliar is the principal work among a small group of manuscripts produced at the court of Charlemagne at Aachen, some time between 794 and late 800. Description Coronation Evangeliar portrait of Saint John Manuscript The Coronation Evangeliar manuscript consists of 236 crimson- dyed parchment pages with gold and silver ink text. The pages measure , and contain text presented in one column, 26 lines per page. The incipit page of each Gospel shows the three writing styles common to valuable illustrated manuscripts from the late antique period‚Äîthe capitalis rustica of the first line, followed by the monumental capitalis quadrata of the second line, which introduces the Latin text of the Gospel in gold ink, which is presented in continuous uncial script with no spaces between the words or punctuation. The book is decorated with 16 plates and four portraits depicting the Evangelists‚Äîone at the start of each Gospel. The portrait paintings are in a Carolingian style derived from Byzantine art. In the margin of the first page of the Gospel of Luke the Greek name Demetrius presbyter is written in gold capital letters. This may be the signature of the scribe or illuminator and may indicate that there were Byzantine artists in the court of Charlemagne. Cover The Coronation Evangeliar cover was created by the goldsmith Hans von Reutlingen of Aachen c. 1500. Designed in high relief, the gold cover shows God the Father seated in front of the canopy of his throne. His left hand is closed over the Bible, and his right hand is raised in a gesture of blessing directed at Mary, who is shown grasping her heart during the Annunciation. The right side of the cover shows the Angel of the Annunciation. God the Father is dressed in imperial vestments and wearing a mitre crown, similar to the one worn by Maximilian I, who was Holy Roman Emperor at the time the cover was produced. The four corners of the front cover are decorated with four medallions bearing symbols of the Four Evangelists.

Early life Sassoon was the only child of the poet Siegfried Sassoon and Hester Sassoon (n√©e Gatty), and was born in London, where his parents had rented a house in order to be closer to specialist help than at their home in Heytesbury, Wiltshire. He was christened at St Martin-in-the-Fields by Rev Dick Sheppard. George's father wrote playfully to Max Beerbohm in November 1936: \\"Will he, I wonder, become Prime Minister, Poet Laureate, Archbishop of Canterbury, or merely Editor of The Times Literary Supplement? Or Master of The Quorn? Or merely Squire of Heytesbury?\\"Ian Sansom, The Truth About Babies: From A-Z (2003) p. 6 at books.google.com In 1947, Sassoon's parents separated, and he thereafter spent much of his childhood with his mother on the Scottish island of Mull. He was educated at Greenways Preparatory School, Ashton Gifford House, near Codford, then at Oundle School and King's College, Cambridge. Career He was noted for his prodigious linguistic ability, learning languages including Serbo-Croat, Hebrew, Aramaic and Klingon. He investigated extraterrestrial phenomena and helped his mother to run a sheep farm on Mull. Between 1978 and 1980, he published three books, two of which were about his theories on extraterrestrial visitations, and also spoke at conferences on alien phenomena. Personal life After his father died in 1967, Sassoon inherited and occupied his father's large country house, Heytesbury House at Heytesbury, Wiltshire. He found it much neglected and worked to restore it, and also battled unsuccessfully to stop a planned A36 bypass from going through the park of the house; in the process, he sold many of his father‚Äôs papers to raise additional funds. The southern part of the park was subject to a compulsory purchase order in 1985 to allow construction of the bypass, separating the house from its cricket field and requiring a new entrance to be made from the west. He sold the house in 1996 after a serious fire and moved to a smaller property in the nearby village of Sutton Veny; but spent part of the year on Mull, where he had inherited his mother's property Ben Buie on her death in 1973. Sassoon married four times: Stephanie Munro, at Inverness in 1955 (dissolved 1961); Marguerite Dicks in 1961 (dissolved 1974); Susan Christian-Howard in 1975 (dissolved 1982); and lastly, Alison Pulvertaft in 1994.

This postcard is believed to depict the store before the 1909 expansion. A postcard believed to be depicting the downtown flagship store after it was expanded in 1909, but before the Art Deco facade was added in 1939. Joske's, founded by German immigrant Julius Joske in 1867, was a department store chain originally based in San Antonio, Texas. In December 1928, Hahn Department Stores acquired the company along with the Titche- Goettinger department store of Dallas, and three years later Hahn became part of Allied Stores. Allied was taken over by Campeau in 1986, and Campeau in turn sold the Joske's chain in 1987 to Dillard's. All Joske's stores were then quickly converted into Dillard's locations. Origins Joske's first store, located on Main Plaza in San Antonio and known as J. Joske, opened in 1867 and operated until 1873, when Joske sold it and went back to Berlin for his family. After returning to San Antonio the same year, Joske opened a new store on Austin Street called J. Joske and Sons. Joske moved the store to Alamo Plaza and changed its name to Joske Brothers. Flagship store St. Joseph's Catholic Church (affectionately referred to by locals as \\"St. Joske's\\" even years after the acquisition by Dillard's) is surrounded on three sides by the former Joske's flagship store. Dillard's occupied only two floors of the flagship store's southwest wing. The store closed in August 2008 and the building now awaits redevelopment. In 1887 the store was moved across the street to the corner of Alamo and Commerce Streets, overlooking historic Alamo Plaza. New floors and elevators were added during a 1909 expansion. In 1936, the five-level store became the first fully air-conditioned store in Texas, and the store became known as \\"The Big Store.\\" The store was expanded and renovated again in 1939, sporting a new Art Deco facade as well as the first escalators installed in a Texas store. To make way for this expansion, the rooftop electric sign, the largest in Texas, where a cowboy was shown lassoing a steer came down. When Joske's wanted to expand again in 1945, nearby St. Joseph's Catholic Church refused to sell its land. Nevertheless, Joske's kept expanding, and St. Joseph's was eventually surrounded on three sides by the store and was jokingly called \\"St. Joske's.\\" By 1953 the flagship store had been expanded several times. The five-level store was the largest department store west of the Mississippi until its closure in 1987. The long-time slogan for the chain was \\"the biggest store in the biggest state.\\" At one time, a shopper could get a custom-made saddle in the downtown store. Departments included spurs and saddles; appliances; a travel agency; an Oriental rug gallery; a lending library; a bakery; gourmet foods; books, toys and even a large postage stamp collecting area. Joske's flagship store also featured the Camellia Room (for formal dining), the Chuck Wagon, and the Fountain Room (a coffee shop). During the Christmas holidays, the flagship store was well known for its fourth-floor \\"Fantasyland\\"; its holiday-themed window displays, including a large window with a toy train set; and the 40-foot-tall Santa Claus that sat atop the roof. \\"Rusty the Reinsteer\\" was the Joske's holiday mascot. Expansion The Joske's logo Concentrating on keeping the downtown flagship store a destination location, Joske's of Texas (as the chain became known) did not expand to a suburban location until 1957, when it opened its second store in the Las Palmas Shopping Center in southwest San Antonio. Built by Bartlett Cocke & Associates now known as Mu√±oz & Company. In January 1965, Joske's purchased rival Wolff and Marx with its downtown flagship and North Star Mall locations. Joske's stated that there would be no immediate changes in operation of Wolff and Marx, however, in less than a month the seven-story downtown Wolff and Marx store was closed because the store did not have escalators and the building had passed its useful life as a modern department store. Joske's sold the downtown Wolff and Marx building in 1968, and the building is now known as the Rand Building. The North Star Mall Wolff and Marx location was replaced in 1969 with a new five-level Joske's, its third San Antonio-area store. The chain expanded into Houston in 1948 and opened a location at the Highland Mall in Austin in 1971. Joske's purchased two mall locations in El Paso, and Phoenix, Arizona (Joske's first and only location outside Texas), from Liberty House in 1978. In 1979 Allied's Titche- Goettinger's stores (more commonly known as Titche's) in Dallas were renamed Joske's. In 1985 Allied Stores consolidated Joske's three Texas divisions‚ÄîDallas, Houston and San Antonio‚Äîinto one central division based in downtown Dallas. The three independent operating and merchandising staffs in the separate divisions were consolidated into a single, larger unit, and Robert T. Mettler was named president and chief executive officer of the combined organization. The corporate office was located at its Downtown Dallas store at Main and St. Paul streets, occupying the top three floors of the seven-story building. At the time, Allied's Joske's division had 6,200 employees, including 800 at its corporate offices, and 27 stores. Civil Rights era In the wake of the Greensboro sit-ins in North Carolina that received wide publicity, desegregation in San Antonio was carried out voluntarily by most eating places in March 1960 after hearing demands from African-American leaders and both black and white churches. However, the management of Joske's declared that blacks could eat in its basement lunch counter, but its two restaurants would remain open to whites only, and hired guards to keep blacks out. However, after a number of protests and an incident of pushing and slapping, Joske's management changed course and by late summer admitted blacks to all its eating facilities. End of an era Joske's former flagship store in 2018 Limited Express on the street level. In 1987 after Allied's acquisition by Campeau, the then 27-store Joske's chain was sold to Dillard's, a then 115-store chain based in Little Rock, Arkansas, ending over 100 years of Texas-based retailing. The San Antonio Conservation Society requested that Dillard's keep the Joske's name on the downtown San Antonio flagship store. The society wrote a letter to then Dillard's President William E. Dillard II urging that the store name be retained. After the acquisition, the massive flagship store was divided up, with Dillard's occupying only a portion of the five-level building. The remaining area of the building was converted into lease space and a retail atrium for Rivercenter (which was under construction at the time of the buyout) and an AMC movie theater. Even with the division of the building into other uses, portions of the structure, including the old \\"bargain basement,\\" remain unoccupied to this day. A redevelopment plan was revealed in October 2006, in which the Joske's facade along Commerce Street would be restored, bringing back the windows and brick that were covered in one of Joske's own renovations before Rivercenter was built, and tenants would be added for the of retail space currently vacant on two upper floors. San Antonio's Historic and Design Review Commission approved the redevelopment plan on October 4, 2006. It was reported in June 2008 that the historic Joske's building was purchased by the Rivercenter property owners from Dillard's, with plans to revitalize the landmark property as part of the property's redevelopment. Dillard's closed its doors in August 2008, and the building currently sits empty, awaiting redevelopment. It was the last traditional downtown department store operated by Dillard's.

The building was used during World War II by American forces and used for various secret and high level planning. This included the reserve headquarters of the D Day Landings, should the primary location become unserviceable. Early history The current House was built around 1740 with red brick. A water-supply system was installed during the period, but it is not clear where the supply originated. The parts examined in 1960 by Mr Wilfred Carpenter Turner, an expert on older buildings, were found to be still operating and in very good condition. *986. The lands were owned by the Abbey of Wherwell, when it was founded Queen Aelfrida, the widow of King Edgar. *1086. The area is recorded in the Domesday book.Domesday records http://www.domesdayextracts.co.uk *c1534. Around the time of the dissolution of the Monasteries, the Abbey's lands were granted to Thomas West, Lord De La Warr of Delaware. *1710. The origin of the house is unclear. Abbotts Ann was the property of Thomas Pitt who purchased Little Ann in 1710, and probably acquired the neighbouring manor about the same date.British History Online http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=56825 *1726. Governor Pitt dies. *1730. It is believed a map of about 1730 shows the 'Rice Field' and that no house appears on maps until 1760. *1740. The house may have been built by General John Richmond Webb, a subordinate of the Duke of Marlborough, in about 1740. It is claimed that the trees in the park surrounding the house represent the troop line-up at the battle of Malplaquet in 1709.A handbook for Travellers in Surrey, Hampshire and the Isle of Wight. By R J King. 1865. Page 306. There is no evidence the park's trees showed battle lines, other than the row of beeches from St John's cross along the Fullerton towards Red Rice; which could have appeared like two rows of soldiers. *1760. The House appears in maps of 1760 and suggests it still belonged to the Pitt family, along with lands in Abbotts Ann Errington family *1730. Mr John Errington lives at Red Rice, married to Maria Levery.

Appears on Isaac Taylor's survey of Hampshire.Geography Department, Portsmouth University http://www.geog.port.ac.uk/webmap/hantsmap/hantsmap/taylor4/ty35.htm The 1759 maps suggests a rectangular area and the existence of a single 'red' building at the northern edge of a wooden parkland with ornamental pathways. The main road passes along the north border, and the eastern edge has a footpath marked. *1763. Leases describe Redrice House as a:'genteel, modern built house with large and pleasant gardens or walks, all in thorough repair at present, it is very well adapted for the reception of any nobleman or gentleman of fortune with a small family as a hunting seat, as it stands in fine healthy and sporting country, but it is not fit for a large family, nor a constant residence, there not being a foot of land belonging to it but yards and gardens. It is at present well tenanted but as the lease expires within a year, it is not certain that a good tenant can readily be got for it, and if it happens to be untenanted it will be attended with the expense of keeping servants there to take care of both house and gardens which, if once suffered to run out of order will cost money to repair these circumstances reducing the value of it greatly as it is not for everybody's money.

Sir Brian Broughton Delves of Broughton (co. Staffs.), bought various estates in Hampshire, including the Abbotts Ann property, which he contracted to purchase from 'the Honourable Thomas Pitt, esquire,' great- grandson of Governor Pitt and afterwards first Lord Camelford. He may also have purchased the manor of Upper Clatford and lands in Upper Clatford for 10,000 UKP, from the heirs-at-law of Maynard Guerin and of Sir Thomas Gatehouse. *1766. Sir Brian Broughton-Delves, 5th Baronet (1740‚Äì1766), dies childless. His younger brother ( Thomas) became the 6th Baronet, but Brian left all his real estate in Hampshire to his wife Mary (Lady Delves). *1769. Henry Errington marries Sir Brian's widow and lives at Red Rice. *1774. At Henry Errington's house, Red Rice, Maria Smythe, his niece, met a future husband, Mr. Edward Weld (aged 45, with no children) who died 3 months later (1775) by accident or illness. Henry was more or less Maria's guardian, since her father had become an invalid.Mrs Fitzherbert and George IV. Book. https://archive.org/stream/mrsfitzherbertge01wilkiala#page/84/mode/2up/search/errington It is likely that Maria often visited and stayed at Red Rice. *1785. Henry Errington is heavily involved with his niece's attachment to the Prince of Wales. The secret and illegal marriage did not take place at Red Rice; the wedding occurred in the drawing room of Mrs Maria Fitzherbert's house in Park Street on the evening of 15 December. Her uncle, Henry Errington, gave her away. *1791. Referenced in map.Geography Department, Portsmouth University http://www.geog.port.ac.uk/webmap/hantsmap/hantsmap/milne1/mln45.htm The map shows the single building (appearing in a changed position since the 1759 map). No ornamental pathways are shown, and the land appears to be separated between a wooded, and less wooded area. The eastern corner of the land appears truncated; suggesting that some land was no longer part of the estate. The southern path is not shown, and appears to have been replaced by a new road on the western boundary. *1794.

A possible walled area is shown at the northern edge. The main building(s) are shown; and a second set of building appear on the southern side. There is also a small square area; possibly containing a set of building with a 'T' shaped courtyard. *1819. Henry Errington died and the property came to his nephews, the Hon. William and the Rev. the Hon. Richard Hill, afterwards Noel-Hill, who succeeded in turn as third and fourth Lords Berwick. Henry Errington's character appears in a 1947 film named \\"Mrs. Fitzherbert\\". Lords Berwick At times before 1913, the external walls were rendered with cement. Creepers were planted. There were Flemish gables and sashes of cavernous plate-glass. The road at the front was diverted. A stable block (with a mounting block) and archway was built of red brick. A wide variety of trees were planted. It is not clear who was living in the House after 1819. It probably remained to be owned by Thomas, the childless 2nd Baron Berwick. Thomas died in 1832, leaving his estate to his brother, the new Baron. *1820. The Salisbury and Winchester Journal reports that the family make their (usual) donation of a good fat ox and two fat sheep to the poor of the parishes of Abbotts Ann and Clatford. *1826. Appears in map. *1827. 8 December, authority is given authorising the diversion of part of the Abbotts Ann to Titcomb Bridge and the Winchester Highway for 4 furlongs and 97 yards, of medium breadth of 40 feet. It was signed by Lord Berwick. *1840. The Tithe map shows the old road discontinued and the route marked by an avenue of trees. A track is shown arriving from the lodge gates to the stables. After the enclosure and diversion of the Fullerton road the grounds probably had two entrances. The main one where the North and South Lodges now stand, another on the Fullerton Road about three-quarters of a mile beyond the crossroads outside the school gates. Here a lodge still remains. *1842.

His estate was administered in June 1843. Best family Three generations of Thomas Best lived there. Rev Thomas Best (1796-1880) purchased it in late 1845 or early 1846. He was a Magistrate, a Clerk in Holy Orders and Lord of the Manor. His son Thomas Best Esq, Magistrate (1828-1886) was the second generation, and his son Captain Thomas George Best of the Royal Horse Artillery (1861-1926), the third generation, became the new Lord of the Manor; and then sold it. In 1844, they planned to divert the road that ran in front of the park (to make a more imposing drive leading to the house), build stables, start an arboretum, create pleasure grounds and develop a large, productive kitchen garden. The legacy of those early trees provided sequoias, mighty green and copper beeches, cedars, a rare weeping beech (outside Errington House) and innumerable elms. At the back of the house a great variety of trees were planted in such a way that a large number of different species of tree could be seen individually from the house. *1841/2. The Manor was purchased from the 3rd Lord Berwick by the Rev. Thomas Best. Thomas's wife, Sophia (Hardwick) came from a wealthy family. *1844. Plans drawn by architect William Burn to remodel the house to become a mansion. *1845/46. In 1846 a red-brick stable block was built with archway (described as 'delightful, if architecturally uncouth'). The date of 1846 was still visible in the drain pipe heads 120 years later. *1846. The building works were delayed. The newspapers, Hampshire Advertiser and Worcestershire Chronicle report on a shooting at Red Rice. On 7 March, Thomas Mullard Shurmur, a foreman overseeing restorations at Red Rice, shot (almost mortally) Thomas Brealey (a 'time-keeper'). On 22 July at Winchester assizes, Shurmur was found guilty of 'Shooting with intent', and was sentenced to 14 years' transportation. *1858. Thomas Best, Esq, only son of Rev.

Publisher: Hutchinson 1954. ASIN B0017AIV44 The family removed a number of rooms on two floors to construct a very fine Great Hall with plasterwork in a coved ceiling and pillared entrance. A new ceiling, in the style of Adam, was added to the dining-room. Several marble fireplaces were installed. General Edwardian alterations included plaster cherubs in the morning-room. More trees were added. *1913. Lord Grantley (John Richard Brinsley Norton), 5th Baron Grantley (1855‚Äì1943) purchased the Red Rice estate from Captain Best. The sale was for more than 5,500 acres; including parts of the village of Abbots Ann and Upper Clatford. The mansion was described as having 'excellent shooting and trout fishing' and cost over 100,000 UKP.The Times, Friday, 16 May 1913; pg. 6; Issue 40213 The purchase occurred close to the birth of his first (and male) grandchild, by his eldest daughter's marriage to a Thomas Bevan. Perhaps he bought the estate for her. *1919 Lord Grantley's son, Richard Henry Brinsley married; and the estate was sold shortly afterwards.Family records http://www.cracroftspeerage.co.uk/online/content/index603.htm *1915/1924.

Outbuildings were built to accommodate estate workers involved in the family's interests in sport, shooting and rearing pheasants and livestock. Four tennis courts and a secluded Japanese water-garden, trees and a path leading to two discreet rose-gardens, each containing a fountain, were built. In 1933 there were major renovations. The old, decaying, grey rendering was removed and the red brick walls were encased in honey-coloured Clipsham stone with the ground floor boldly rusticated and a beetling cornice at the top. All windows replaced by chain-hung sashes with proportioned panes. The roof was renewed and drains re-designed. Fire hydrants and static water-tanks were built around the house, fed from the original Regency water-supply system. Almost all internal timber was replaced due to damage from death-watch beetle and woodworm. Rooms were grouped into suites, plumbing and bathrooms improved, electrical outlets were added. They built some form of early oil-fired central heating. The interior was decorated throughout with a durable paint of beige colour. A nursery wing was built onto the main House, linking it to the stables. The new floorspace was used for a 'studio and a boudoir', and working and living areas for the senior house servants. * 1920 ‚Äì The Miller-Mundy family buy the estate, having moved from their estate at Shipley Park, Derbyshire.

They may have included Alfred's widow (his second wife, Catherine Louisa Cradock-Hartopp); and his unmarried daughter Esme Sybil. Certainly Alfred's only son, Major Godfrey Edward Miller Mundy, the inheritor, moved there with his first wife Mollie and children (Edward) Peter Godfrey, and Maureen Angela. They were attracted by the agricultural and sporting potential of Red Rice. They set about building up the shoot and the estate to a record production of livestock and pheasants, in improving the grounds with, among other things, four tennis courts and a romantic, conveniently secluded Japanese style water-garden, and trees. The water garden contained a ginkgo tree and a great thicket of bamboo. * 1921 ‚Äì Two lodges (or gatehouses), gate piers and gates are built Each lodge has stone with the date (1921) and the Miller Mundy family crest.http://www.myfamilysilver.com/pages/crestfinder- crest.aspx?id=161543&name;=Mundy * 1933 ‚Äì Major restoration work is undertaken.

The estate had already passed to the already married, eldest son, Major Godfrey Edward. * 1937 ‚Äì A local story relates how Peter Miller Mundy, at his 21st birthday party, turned fire-hoses on his guests, and released and shot a pheasant in the Great Hall (where the chapel is now). The war years *1939/1945. The house had been taken over in the Second World War as a planning centre, mainly used by the American army; it was visited by the Supreme Commander, U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower, and it is part of local folklore that the bomb which destroyed the pub in Goodworth Clatford was aimed at him. Members of the Women's land army worked in the farm on the estate. *1939. Early in September, eight of the rooms were filled with specimens of butterflies, birds, mammals, etc., which were sent there for safe keeping by the British Museum. *1940. In the spring, Red Rice became the centre of a bomb disposal unit. *1940. In the summer, the House was occupied by Women's Air Force personnel from RAF Middle Wallop, which had opened that year.Wartime memories http://www.wartimememoriesproject.com/ww2/airfields/middlewallop.php *1941. Major Peter marries for the first time; to Margaret. Their first son, Edward Simon Peter Mundy was born in November. *1941. A liaison unit of the United States Air Force was installed, and the entrance hall and the present library were divided by partitions into a number of small offices. Meanwhile, most of the furniture and pictures had been put into store, except for the contents of the main suite (later to be Sherwin and Bryant dormitories) and the library (now the Masters' Common Room), which were used by Major Miller-Mundy throughout. Outside, owing to war-time conditions, maintenance had been reduced to a minimum and the grounds had become very overgrown. *1943. Major Geoffrey Edward marries Julia Dorothea \\"Ullu\\" Brodnitz. *1944. Major Edward Peter has a son, Andrew Godfrey Miller Mundy; who was brought up on the estate.Obituary http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-23786120.html *1944. Red Rice was transformed into an American VIP centre. In one week the internal partitions were removed, damage was made good, the floors were sanded and polished. Many vans arrived bringing back the furniture, pictures and carpets. Rooms were redecorated, the grounds were tidied up, and in general the house was restored, at the request of the U.S. army authorities, to its pre-war splendour. The depleted Redrice staff, supplemented by large numbers of American troops both inside and outside, worked to meet a tight schedule. In addition to the work of restoration various other changes took place. Three or four direct telephone links between Redrice and Washington were installed, and the Servants' Hall became a telephone exchange. One room - probably the Major's 'Studio' room - was used as the map room, in which the plans for D-Day were recorded with coloured flags, as was later the progress of the troops after the invasion of France. It was during this period that General Eisenhower paid his two short visits to Red Rice, sleeping in the suite of rooms (later to become the infirmary and Matron's room in Redrice School). His leisure hours were spent fishing in the River Anton at Upper Clatford. *1944. Royal Air Force Substitution Unit: IX Fighter Command.

In August, a conference was held at Red Rice, attended by Secretary Henry R. Morgenthau Jr and the UK War Cabinet Minister Brendan Bracken. It was to discuss the Morgenthau Plan, the 'Treasury Plan for the Treatment of Germany'. The plan was ratified by Churchill and Eisenhower three weeks later in Canada. However, the Morgenthau Plan eventually lost out to the philosophy of the Marshall Plan of 1947. *1945. The Army attempted to return the house to civilian use in good order after the war.

After the war, Major Edward Peter Godfrey Miller Mundy (July 1916, d. 27 July 1981) made a gift of a plot of land at the top of the village to be used as a council house estate and a sports field, and perhaps 5 acres situated between Goodworth and Upper Clatford to the Parish Council for use.British Army Officers 1939-1945 http://www.unithistories.com/officers/Army_officers_M02.html A photograph exists of the Andover Ladies football team, pictured at a \\"Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen and Families Association\\" fete in Red Rice Park.http://www.sopse.org.uk/asset_arena/image/2000/hs/hl/hs-hl- hs2698-i-00-000.jpg *1949.

The land sold was the middle part of the Red Rice estate extending to approximately 1800 acres.Country Life Volume 128 With the departure in 1961 of Major Miller Mundy, the main entity of Redrice was divided into two main parts, the house and immediate grounds, and Home Farm. Redrice School The H-shaped estate workshop buildings and most of the stable block perimeter wall were removed. The stable yard was reconstructed to provide three classrooms and two day-rooms, together with changing rooms, ablutions and a housemaster's study below, and upstairs dormitories for 28 and studies for 30, as well as bathrooms and three master's rooms. The courtyard was floored with paving and chippings. A refectory area was created and roofed in over the old backyard of the house, between the kitchen and the house's 1933 wing. Trees were cleared for playing fields. *1960. A sale was advertised in the pages of The Times where it was spotted by Veronica Stokes, wife of a future Headmaster at Redrice School. The eastern portion of his 5,000 acre estate would become the School, consisting of the main house and stable block with its clock tower, plus the two lodges at the gate and 46 surrounding acres. On 17 February, at an auction at the Star and Garter Hotel in Andover, it was purchased by its consortium of new owners for 41,100 UKP plus the sixpenny stamp for Stamp Duty. *1961. Redrice School opened. Parts were adapted to school use and new buildings were built behind the house. The park had shrunk in size and the arboretum had suffered from neglect. *1962.

The earliest known existing photograph is an aerial photograph; probably taken between 1933 and 1960. Home Farm On 28 April 1961, the farming side of the hamlet (approximately 850 acres) was purchased by the Scott family. This was farmed with their relatives the Barnes-Gorell family. This included the parkland to the south east of the main house, 16 farm workers cottages, the market garden, farm buildings, outlying barns and woodland. Over the years, the houses were improved and modernized. Several were knocked into larger accommodation to increase the quality of the homes. The farm infrastructure was improved and in 1967 the dairy herd was sold and the output switched solely to arable crops. Unusually the farm retained extensive soil, climate and other key data from every growing season. This enabled it to be competitive by specializing in growing seed crops for the major seed producers. Before the First World War, the farm employed 40 men and about 80 horses. There were required for all aspects of the farming process. The introduction of traction engines did little to reduce their numbers. When they were being used, up to 8 horses were required to pull the water bowsers from the Pill Hill Brook, a tributary of the River Anton that runs through the Clatfords, to Red Rice to keep their boilers supplied. The introduction of modern tractors reduced the number of horses required. In 1963, the Scott family built their family home in the Horse Meadow field. It was aptly named Horse Meadow. Mary Scott was an internationally acclaimed sculptress, whose work includes the plaque commemorating the battle at Gallipoli during the First World War which is found in the Crypt of St Paul's Cathedral, London. Her husband, Edward Scott was part of the small photographic unit that recorded the devastation from Britain's atomic weapons test in Montebello in 1952. The family sold the majority of the farm land and Home Farm in 2004, and retained their home, a cottage and surrounding lands of 40 acres around the family home, and a small paddock and 18 acres of woodland to the south of Redrice House called Home Covert.

The local South Slavic-speaking peasants were accustomed to defining itself in terms of their religion, locality, and occupation. After the national states were established, peasantry was indoctrinated through the schools and military conscription, the official Church, and the governmental press. It was through these instruments of the state administration, that a national identity came into real and rapid development.K.

Some Serbian sources from the mid 19th century, continued to claim, the areas southeast of Nis, including Southern Pomoravlje and Macedonia, were mainly Bulgarian populated.The Serbian newspaper Srbske Narodne Novine (Year IV, pp. 138 and 141-43, May 4 and 7, 1841), described the towns of Ni≈°, Leskovac, Pirot, and Vranja as lying in Bulgaria, and styles their inhabitants Bulgarians.

The map was based on Davidoviƒá‚Äòs work placing Serbians into the limited area north of ≈†ar Planina. Per Serbian newspaper, Vidovdan (No. 38, March 29, 1862), the future Bulgarian-Serbian frontier would extend from the Danube in North, along the Timok and South Morava, and then on the ridge of Shar Mountain towards the Black Drin River to the Lake of Ohrid in South.Ethnic Mapping on the Balkans (1840‚Äì1925): a Brief Comparative Summary of Concepts and Methods of Visualization, Demeter, G√°bor and al.

In the sub-district of Prokuplje, the most numerous ethnic group were the Albanians, while in Vranje, Bulgarians and Albanians were equally distributed alongside minority Serbian population. In Pirot and Leskovac sub-districts, the Bulgarians were the main ethnic group. The Turks lived mainly in the bigger towns.Engin Deniz Tanƒ±r, The Mid- nineteenth Century Ottoman Bulgaria from the Viewpoints of French Travellers (Ph.D. diss, METU, 2005), p. 71. In Ottoman usage then the Sanjak of Ni≈° was included in an area designated as \\"Bulgaristan\\", i.e. Bulgaria.Mark Pinson, Ottoman Bulgaria in the First Tanzimat Period ‚Äî The Revolts in Nish (1841) and Vidin (1850), p. 103; Middle Eastern Studies, Vol. 11, No 2 (May, 1975), pp. 103-146. Territorial expansion of Serbia (1817‚Äì1913) Serbian elites after the mid of the 19th century, claimed that the Bulgarians located south-east of Ni≈° were Old Serbians, which was an implementation of Gara≈°anin's expansionist plan called Naƒçertanije.: \\"...a Balkan alliance, which alarmed both Bulgarians and Turks with its implications of Serbian expansionism as expounded two decades previously, in Garasanin's Nacertanie, the Serbian equivalent of Greek Megali Idea.\\" In 1870, the Southern Pomoravlje was included in the Bulgarian Exarchate. Milan Savic still claimed that at this time (1878) Nis and environs were Bulgarian populated. After the war between Russia and the Ottoman Empire (1877‚Äì1878), the lands in the regions of Ni≈°, Pirot and Vranje became a part of Serbia. Serbia had successfully homogenized and modernized these new territories and in this way it assimilated the local Bulgarians of the Timok and Morava river valleys toward the end of the nineteenth century. Afterwards Serbia turned its attention to the region of Macedonia. Kingdom of Serbia In 1878 Serbia became independent and pressure developed in the state for people from different ethnic groups to Serbianise religious denominations and their personal names. Serbianisation of identity along with ideological and cultural Serbianisation followed. Belgrade was reconstructed as a new capital by the Serb elite that removed elements of the Ottoman era. While Serb commonfolk looked for ways to aid the Serb cause and assist other Serbs still residing in areas ruled by the Muslim Ottoman Empire. Austro- Hungarian Serbs who had integrated within Serbia and promoted Serbianisation opened the country up to cultural and economic influences of Austria-Hungary in the 1880s. Principality of Montenegro According to jurist and sociologist Valtazar Bogi≈°iƒá all Eastern Orthodox citizens of Montenegro were Serbs. He states that they Serbianised a small number of Romani people who mostly worked as blacksmiths.} Ottoman Macedonia Representatives from Serbia, such as the statesmen, diplomat and historian Stojan Novakoviƒá encouraged a separate Slavic Macedonian identity to counter the strong Bulgarian influence, to separate the local population from the rest of the Bulgarians, and to instill the \\"Serbian idea\\". Serbianising directly the local Slavic population through propaganda and education was difficult due to strong Bulgarian sentiments at the time in the region. The spread and promotion of Serbian Macedonianism was seen by Serbs as the first move toward eventually Serbianing the Macedonians. Serbian nationalist-oriented politicians in the 19th century traveled to the area of Ottoman Macedonia and spread national propaganda with intent to build a Serbian national feeling among the local population. One of these nationalist was Milo≈° Milojeviƒá who claimed that Serbia in ancient times has been far bigger, with expansion to more continents.Darko Gavriloviƒá; (2009) Mitovi nacionalizma i demokratija (in Serbian) p. 30; Centar za istoriju, demokratiju i pomirenje, Novi Sad, Vlachs Pre-Ottoman Serbian Empire and its institutions had no time to serbicize the Balkan Vlachs in medieval Serbia, since it soon fell under the Turkish dominance; that process was not finished until the 19th century. Furthermore, the process of serbization, of Vlachs has been accomplished through the Serbian Orthodox Church in Dalmatia and the Military Frontiers (Vojna Krajina), i. e., in the territories of the Croatian Kingdom, together with Bosnia, where Vlachs found their final domicil. The Church had the most decisive role in the serbization process of Vlachs in the initial and middle phases. At that 16-18th century the amalgamation of the process of sedentarization of the Orthodox Vlachs and their gradual fusion into the Serbian rural population reached a high level and was recognized by the Ottoman authorities. In the final phase, the most significant role was played by the newspaper \\"Srbobran\\" in the 80's and 90's of the 19th century.Mirko Valentiƒá;(1992) The ethnic roots of the Croatian and Bosnian Serbs p. 1-21; Octavian Ciobanu; (2018) The heritage of Western Balkan Vlachs p. 1-9; According to Ivo Banac almost whole civil authority of the former Serbian state Ottomans transfer to the patriarchs of Peƒá. The millet system that the Serbs transferred to the Habsburg Monarchy was a good instrument for transmitting the Serbian national identity. Patriarchate of Peƒá and later Metropolitanate of Karlovci Serbianized parts of Balkan Orthodox people such as Bulgars, Vlachs, Albanians, Romanians and significant number of Catholic Croats.Ivo Banac; (1984) The National Question in Yugoslavia: Origins, History, Politics p. 64-66; Cornell University Press, According to Vjeran Kursar although Catholic and Muslim Vlachs, or other, non-Serbian elements which exist in the western Balkans should not be underestimated still the vast majority of Vlachs in that area were Orthodox Christians and Serbian(ised), often still bilingual. All Slavic or Slavicised Orthodox Christians under the jurisdiction of Patriarchate of Peƒá ie Serbian patriarchs were eventually identified as Serbs, this process did not finish until modern times.

In Belgrade a new government was formed after the war that quickly Serbianised the gendarmerie and made non-Serbs in the country view the new Kingdom as an extension of the old Kingdom of Serbia. =Vardar Macedonia= A World War I era ethnographic map of the Balkans by Serbian ethnologist Jovan Cvijiƒá. The western parts of today Bulgaria and northwestern parts of present day North Macedonia are shown as populated by Serbs. There are depicted also distinct \\"Slavic Macedonians\\". However, in this way he promoted the idea that Macedonian Slavs were in fact Southern Serbs.Up until the early twentieth century, the international community viewed Macedonians as a regional variety of Bulgarians, i.e. Western Bulgarians. However, during the Paris Peace Conference of 1919 the Allies sanctioned Serbian control of much of Macedonia, because they accepted the belief that Macedonians were, in fact, Southern Serbs. This extraordinary change in opinion can largely be attributed to one man, Jovan Cvijiƒá, a prominent geographer at the University of Belgrade. Nationalism and Territory: Constructing Group Identity in Southeastern Europe, Geographical perspectives on the human past, George W. White, Rowman & Littlefield, 2000, , p. 236. The region of present-day North Macedonia until 1912 was part of the Ottoman Empire. According to Encyclop√¶dia Britannica 1911 Edition, at the beginning of the 20th century the Slavs constituted the majority of the population in Macedonia. Per Britannica itself the bulk of the Slavs there were regarded as \\"Bulgarians\\". Immediately after annexation of Vardar Macedonia to the Kingdom of Serbia, the Macedonian Slavs were faced with the policy of forced serbianisation. Those who declare as the Bulgarians were, harassed or deported to Bulgaria.Report of the International Commission to Inquire into the Causes and Conduct of the Balkan Wars (p. 52) The high clergymen of the Bulgarian Exarchate were also deported.Report of the International Commission to Inquire into the Causes and Conduct of the Balkan Wars (p. 165) Bulgarian schools were closed and teachers expelled. The population of Macedonia was forced to declare as Serbs. Those who refused were beaten and tortured.Report of the International Commission to Inquire into the Causes and Conduct of the Balkan Wars (p. 53) Prominent people and teachers from Skopje who refused to declare as Serbs were deported to Bulgaria. International Commission concluded that the Serbian state started in Macedonia wide sociological experiment of \\"assimilation through terror.\\" All Bulgarian books gave way to Serbian. The government Serbianized personal names and surnames for all official uses. Between 1913 and 1915 all people who spoke a Slavic language in Vardar Macedonia were presented by Serbia as Serbs. During the Kingdom of Serbs, Croats and Slovenes, the government of the Kingdom pursued a linguistic Serbisation policy towards population of the Macedonia, then called \\"Southern Serbia\\" (unofficially) or \\"Vardar Banovina\\" (officially). The dialects spoken in this region were referred to as dialects of Serbo-Croatian. Southern dialects were suppressed with regards to education, military and other national activities, and their usage was punishable. Following the First World War Serbian rule was reinstated over Vardar Macedonia, the local Bulgarian or Macedonian population was not recognised and an attempted Serbianisation occurred. \\"Macedonian Slavs are ethnically closest to Bulgarians, and were subjected to Serbianization during the interwar period.\\" Yugoslavia aimed to incorporate Macedonia through \\"assimilation\\" and \\"nationalisation\\" through two main goals. Firstly, to legitimate its control, the state based its claims to Macedonia as an inheritance of the medieval monarch Stefan Du≈°an or as a promised land given by God to the Serb people. Secondly, the state used the modernist idea of the nation and spread it through schools. Both processes merged as myths, people, symbols and dates originating from Serbian history were also used in the endeavour. During 1920 the Orthodox community of Vardar Macedonia was placed under the Serbian Orthodox Church after payment was made to the Constantinople Patriarchate who sold its control for 800,000 francs in 1919. In Vardar Macedonia, Bulgarian signage and literature was removed and societies were shut down along with the expulsion of Bulgarian teachers and clergy who had returned during the war. Names of people were forcefully Serbianised such as Atanasov becoming Atanasoviƒá and Stankov as Stankoviƒá along with a spate of repression that followed through arrests, internment and detention. Serbian colonisation in Kosovo and Vardar Macedonia between 1920 and 1930. Colonised areas are in thick hatched black lines and colonised settlements are shown as black squares The Kingdom was also interested to change the ethnic composition of the population in Vardar Macedonia. Yugoslavia commenced a policy of forced Serbianisation through such measures as the Agrarian Reform which was a settlement plan. In 1919 there were announced the orders for preparing for colonization of Southern Serbia. The Serbian colonization was maintained through \\"agricultural\\" and \\"administrative\\" actions. In the Interbellum, the Kingdom has settled 3,670 families (18,384 persons). The colonists were given properties. Also, in the same time, almost all clerks in the area were Serbs. This means that in the period between the two World wars the Kingdom succeeded through the agricultural and the administrative colonizations to create significant Serbian ethnic minority in Vardar Macedonia.–°—Ç–æ—ò–∞–Ω –ö–∏—Å–µ–ª–∏–Ω–æ–≤—Å–∫–∏, –ï—Ç–Ω–∏—á–∫–∏—Ç–µ –ø—Ä–æ–º–µ–Ω–∏ –≤–æ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏—ò–∞: 1913-1995, –ò–Ω—Å—Ç–∏—Ç—É—Ç, 2000, . Total numbers were 4,200 Serb families with 50,000 Serb gendermes and troops relocated from Serbia to Vardar Macedonia to advance the Serbianisation of the region and population. Politicians based in Belgrade thought that ideology alongside repression could generate the \\"correct national\\" sentiments among local inhabitants. Serb officials, gendarmes and teachers, often poorly trained and little interested in their job according to reports of the time were given the task to \\"nationalise and assimilate\\" the region. The initiation of an educational campaign made children to learn that \\"I am a true Serb like my father and my mother\\" while their parents were not receptive of the Yugoslav state. A small number of inhabitants did declare themselves as South Serbs and Serbs, often done for reasons of opportunism. Government authorities due to maladministration had difficulties in Serbianising the local population as they were strongly attached to the Bulgarian Orthodox Church (Exarchate) and Bulgarian nationalism. The same authorities held conflicting views toward the population, whom they told were Serbian, whereas local inhabitants noticed they were treated unequally in relation to their Serb counterparts. Some state officials let locals know that they viewed them as Bulgarians and used the term bugara≈°i for people that supported Bulgarians or were not recognised as Serbs.. The state considered individuals that supported local autonomy, culture or language as a Bulgaroman and sought their suppression. In Vardar Macedonia Bulgarian newspapers were banned in many areas and mail from Bulgaria remained undelivered within the region due to \\"a technicality\\". As a counteraction to Serb efforts the paramilitary IMRO began sending armed bands into Yugoslav Macedonia to assassinate officials and stir up the spirit of the locals. After 1923 the IMRO had de facto full control of Bulgarian Macedonia and acted as a \\"state within a state\\". It used Bulgaria as a base for terrorist attacks against Yugoslavia with the unofficial agreement of the right-wing governments. Because of this, contemporary observers described the Yugoslav-Bulgarian border as the most fortified in Europe. Meanwhile, several hundred political assassinations were organized by the Yugoslav security police led by Dobrica Matkoviƒá. Following regular attacks by pro-Bulgarian IMRO komitadjis on Serbian colonists and gendarmes, the government appealed to Association against Bulgarian Bandits, responsible for the massacre of 53 inhabitants of the village of Garvan in 1923.Tomic Yves, Massacres in Dismembered Yugoslavia, 1941-1945.

Regions with pro-Bulgarian sentiments such as Tikve≈° and Bregalnica were violently Serbianised by Serb ƒçetniks that resulted in the population being gathered up for forced labour and local leaders killed. In 1930s a more homogeneous generation was growing up in Vardar Macedonia, which resisted Serbianisation and increasingly identified itself as Macedonian, but which also made it clear that Bulgarian idea was no more the only option for them. A sizable part of the local population nonetheless had undergone a transformation as Serbianised Slavs. The government and its widespread massive Serbianisation campaign was unsuccessful in trying to eliminate the traces of an emerging Macedonian national consciousness among the local population.. The failed assimilation of the region was due to Serb policies that were exploitative and colonial and not directed toward integration. Funds were controlled from Belgrade and the economy was geared toward resource extraction whose raw materials were bought by the government at low prices it determined for itself.. The state controlled the local tobacco monopoly and acquired a steady and sizable amount of revenue without investing much in return to raise the living standards of the inhabitants. The government in Belgrade or the wider administration showed little concern toward conditions within the region.. A high rate of turnover existed among ministers and officials who mainly showed up prior to elections or to advance their own career and often staff in the local administration from other parts of the country were incompetent and corrupt.. Locals were excluded from involvement in the sociopolitical system, suppression of elites occurred and state security forces instilled an environment of fear among inhabitants. New arrivals to the region were favoured over the local population regarding state employment, loans and agricultural reform and both groups continued to be separate from each other. During the interwar period the Croatian question dominated politics, Macedonia was sidelined and the view of the time was that discontent within the region could be contained through use of repressive measures. Local inhabitants were mistrusted by the political elite of Belgrade whom designated them as being pure Serbs or through terms such as the \\"classical south\\".. During the interwar period Bulgaria resented the Serbianisation policy in Vardar Macedonia. In World War Two, the Bulgarian Army occupied southern Yugoslavia and their troops were welcomed as liberators from Serbianisation by the local Macedonian Slavs.Dimitris Livanios, The Macedonian Question: Britain and the Southern Balkans 1939-1949, Oxford Historical Monographs, 2008, , p. 179. =Kosovo= The attempt at the Serbianisation of Kosovo and Albanian reaction toward resisting those efforts has been a factor contributing to conflict among Albanians and the Serbs. The region was strategically important for the state and its security with the local Albanian population deemed as \\"unreliable\\". Kosovo from the early twentieth century was exposed to the politics of Serbianisation through violence and administrative measures such as replacing Albanians with another population. \\"Kosovars have not forgotten the continuous politics of Serbisation of their homeland by administrative measures or violence, dating back to the beginning of the twentieth century.\\" \\"Les Serbes men√®rent une politique d'√©migration forc√©e et de serbisation du Kosovo. Ils voulaient ainsi remplacer une population peu fiable par une autre, plus loyale, sur un territoire dont la position strat√©gique rendait la possession indispensable pour la s√©curit√© du Royaume.\\" In the aftermath of the First World War Serbian control over Kosovo was restored and the Kingdom attempting to counteract Albanian separatism pursued a policy to alter the national and religious demographics of Kosovo and to Serbianise the area. The government implemented policies such as the Agrarian Reform. It was a settlement plan to encourage Serb and Montenegrin settlers from other parts of Yugoslavia to resettle in Kosovo through preferential treatment of financial and land incentives to strengthen the Slavic element. The process involved the construction of new settlements in Kosovo and due to serbianisation efforts some were named Lazarevo, Obiliƒá, Milo≈°evo after heroes from Serbian epic poetry. Other places such as Ferizoviƒá (Alb: Ferizaj) had their name changed to Uro≈°evac. Albanian land was illegally confiscated and often through expropriations, whereas Serb settlers gained possession of prime land. The Albanian population was encouraged to leave the region, as they were perceived to be immigrants in need of repatriation to either Turkey, Albania or expected to assimilate within Yugoslavia. The state closed Albanian schools in 1918 as part of its efforts toward Serbianising the local Albanian population. Between 1918 and 1923, as a result of state policies 30,000 and 40,000 mainly Muslim Albanians migrated to the Turkish regions of Izmir and Anatolia. Albanian historians state that during the whole interwar period 300,000 Albanians left Yugoslavia due to duress. By 1931 the Serbianisation efforts had failed as Albanians still composed 63% of the Kosovan population. Other parts of the Serbianisation policy in Kosovo included establishing an effective government administration and refusing autonomous Albanian cultural development in the region. =Vojvodina= During the interwar period, the government through its policy subjected ethnic Hungarians in Vojvodina to Serbianisation. \\"At the same time, the interwar government made no serious attempt to win over the Vojvodinian Hungarians. Instead, they were subjected to a policy of Serbianization\\" Communist YugoslaviaSR Macedonia= Decision about the Macedonian Alphabet 1 May 1945. Note it is written on Bulgarian typewriter using –ô and there are hand-written –Ö, –à and –è, and diacritics added to create –É and –å. The rejection of the –™, together with the adoption of –à, –è, –â and –ä, led some authors to consider it to be \\"Serbianization\\".When Blaze Koneski, the founder of the Macedonian standard language, as a young boy, returned to his Macedonian native village from the Serbian town where he went to school, he was ridiculed for his Serbianized language.Cornelis H. van Schooneveld, Linguarum: Series maior, Issue 20, Mouton., 1966, p. 295....However this was not at all the case, as Koneski himself testifies. The use of the schwa is one of the most important points of dispute not only between Bulgarians and Macedonians, but also between Macedonians themselves ‚Äì there are circles in Macedonia who in the beginning of the 1990s denounced its exclusion from the standard language as a hostile act of violent serbianization...

After WWII Marshal Tito formed out SR Macedonia of a part of 1929‚Äì1941 Vardar Banovina, and encouraged the development of Macedonian identity and Macedonian as a separate South Slavic language. The Macedonian national feelings were already ripe, but some researchers argue that even then, it was questionable whether the Macedonian Slavs considered themselves to be a nationality separate from the Bulgarians.The Macedonian conflict: ethnic nationalism in a transnational world, Loring M. Danforth, Princeton University Press, 1997, , pp. 65-66. Yugoslav Communists recognized the existence of a separate Macedonian nation to quiet the fears of the Slavic population that a new Yugoslavia would continue to follow the policies of forced serbianization. For the Yugoslav authorities to recognize the local Slavs as Bulgarians would be to admit, they should be part of Bulgaria. In fact, the recognition of the Macedonian language and nation aimed to de- bulgarize the local population and to create a national consciousness that would support the identification with Yugoslavia.Stephen E. Palmer, Robert R. King, Yugoslav communism and the Macedonian question, Archon Books, 1971, , Chapter 9: The encouragement of Macedonian culture. As result, persons continuing to declare Bulgarian identity were again imprisoned or went into exile, and so Vardar Macedonia was finally de-bulgarised.Europe Since 1945: An Encyclopedia by Bernard Anthony Cook [] Some researchers have described the process of codifying the Macedonian language during 1945 - 1950 as 'Serbianization'.Voss C., The Macedonian Standard Language: Tito‚ÄîYugoslav Experiment or Symbol of ‚ÄòGreat Macedonian‚Äô Ethnic Inclusion? in C. Mar- Molinero, P. Stevenson as ed. Language Ideologies, Policies and Practices: Language and the Future of Europe, Springer, 2016, , p. 126.Lerner W. Goetingen, Formation of the standard language - Macedonian in the Slavic languages, Volume 32, Walter de Gruyter, 2014, , chapter 109. Within the period of Macedonian language codification, two tendencies emerged: one language majority, that was pro-Macedonian, with some pro-Bulgarian biases, and one language minority openly pro-Serbian. The language minority, with the help of the Yugoslav political establishment defeated the language majority.Stojan Kiselinovski, Historical Roots of the Macedonian Language Codification, Polish Academy of Sciences, 2016, Studia Srodkowoeuropejskie i Ba≈Çkanistyczne, pp. 133-146. DOI: 10.4467/2543733XSSB.16.009.6251 Macedonian became a ‚Äúfirst‚Äù official language in the newly proclaimed SR Macedonia, where Serbian was declared as ‚Äúsecond‚Äù language, while Bulgarian was prohibited.The Macedonian partisans established a commission to create an ‚Äúofficial‚Äù Macedonian literary language (1945), which became the Macedonian Slavs' legal ‚Äúfirst‚Äù language (with Serbo-Croatian a recognized ‚Äúsecond‚Äù and Bulgarian officially proscribed). D. Hupchick, The Balkans: From Constantinople to Communism, Springer, 2002, , p. 430. The irreversible turning point of Serbianisation of the Macedonian standard took place in the late 1950s.Voss C., The Macedonian Standard Language: Tito‚ÄîYugoslav Experiment or Symbol of ‚ÄòGreat Macedonian‚Äô Ethnic Inclusion? in C. Mar-Molinero, P. Stevenson as ed. Language Ideologies, Policies and Practices: Language and the Future of Europe, Springer, 2016, , p. 126. On the other hand during the time of federation in Socialist Yugoslavia, Yugoslav citizens learned Serbo-Croatian at school. This bilingualism was stimulated by the subordinated pro-Serbian elites in Yugoslav Macedonia.Language ideologies, policies and practices by Clare Mar-Molinero, Patrick Stevenson (Editor) - The Macedonian standard language: Tito-Yugoslav experiment or symbol for ‚ÄúGreat Macedonian‚Äù ethnic inclusion? Christian Voss, , Palgrave Macmillan, 2009, pp. 120-122.The languages and linguistics of Europe: A comprehensive guide, Hans Henrich, Bernd Kortmann, Johan van der Auwera, Walter de Gruyter, 2011, , p. 420. In this way the influence of Serbo-Croatian arose to such a level, that the colloquial speech of the capital Skopje has been described as a \\"creolized form of Serbian\\". For Bulgarians, Macedonian nationalism represents the result of the Serbification process in the region. Bulgarian scholars and politicians maintain that the Macedonian language was Serbified as it adopted words from the Serbian language in the postwar codification process under Yugoslavia that the Bulgarian government has denounced. =\\"Western Outlands\\"= The territories called Western Outlands were ceded by Bulgaria to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in 1920 as a result of the Treaty of Neuilly, following the First World War. All Bulgarian schools and churches there were closed. Serbian primary schools were opened, teaching and learning in Serbian, while Bulgarian was prohibited. In 1920 a Law on the Protection of the State was adopted, which forced the Bulgarians there to accept Serbian names and surnames. A large part of the population emigrated to Bulgaria. An armed conflict started in 1922 when pro-Bulgarian separatist IWORO carried out numerous assaults on the Tzaribrod‚ÄìBelgrade railway. Bulgarians have received the status of a national minority after WWII. They live in the Caribrod and Bosilegrad municipalities and in some villages in Pirot, Babu≈°nica and Surdulica municipalities. However, in 1948 there was a sharp deterioration for several decades of the Bulgarian-Yugoslav relations, due to the Tito-Stalin split. The Bulgarian teachers there were expelled again. The population was subjected to humiliation and systematic psychological terror. Bulgarians made the highest percentage among the minorities detained on Goli Otok labour camp after the WWII. The decades of geographic isolation of other Bulgarians, and the repressions additionally led this community to inability to build its own minority space for many years.Alternative Report submitted pursuant to Article 25 Paragraph 1 of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities, September 2007. CHRIS - Network of the Committees for Human Rights in Serbia, p. 4. Yugoslav wars During the 1980s, some Serb intellectuals criticised and the League of Communists and held them responsible for Yugoslavia's political and economic troubles while offering solutions to the \\"Serbian question\\" through discussions and explanations of the Serb predicament. One of the narratives that emerged claimed that under communism Serbs had abandoned their old traditions resulting in a loss of Serbian identity and unawareness of Serb interests with looming historical defeat in a process called \\"de-Serbisation\\". \\"The second narrative stated that because the Serbs had renounced their central cultural traditions during the years of communist rule, they started losing their cultural identity, and thus became unaware of their real national interests. As a result, they were facing historical defeat. The process was referred to by using terms like \\"de- racination\\", de-nationalisation\\", or \\"de-Serbisation\\". =Yugoslav army= The Yugoslav army (JNA) prior to the 1990s was a multi-ethnic force consisting of conscripts, regulars, commissioned and non-commissioned officers that for the highest ranks was determined through an ethnic principle of representative proportionality reflected in Yugoslavia's multi-ethnic composition. Serbs overall held most senior, middle and junior ranks. Following 1990-1991 during the later stages of the breakup of Yugoslav federation that descended into war the JNA underwent a process of Serbianisation. It transformed from being multi-ethnic into a mainly Serb organisation under the Serbian republic's President Slobodan Milo≈°eviƒá who held control and command over the force. During the period non-Serb personnel defected to the new armies of the new post-Yugoslav republics and others who felt disillusioned yet were unable to defect resigned. Slovene, Croat, Macedonian and Muslim (Bosniak) officers left the ranks of the Yugoslav army. \\"with their drive to establish independent states near the end of June 1991 were the beginning of the complete dissolution of the Yugoslav federation. The eruption of war in Croatia prompted a Serbianization of the YNA as Slovene and Croat officers, and later other non-Serb officers (especially Muslims and Macedonians), left its ranks.\\" As the army became dominated more by Serbs a program has instituted to retire non-Serb personnel that resulted in 24 generals remaining out of 150 on the eve of when the JNA was formally disbanded on 19 May 1992. In that time 42 of those generals had been removed by General Bo≈æidar Stevanoviƒá during his campaign of Serbianisation. He belonged to a clandestine network called Vojna Linija (Military Line) that backed the Serbianisation of the JNA and Milo≈°eviƒá placed Stevanoviƒá as head of the air force to accelerate the removal of military personnel deemed unreliable and non-Serb. Following these processes the JNA was impacted due to the realisation that Yugoslavia no longer existed and its priority shifted toward creating the frontiers of a new Serbian state. A campaign to shift the political orientation of the JNA to a Serbian character also occurred. At the end of May 1992, over 90% of the JNA was composed of Serbs. The Serbianisation of the Yugoslav army created the conditions for their support of Serbs in the Krajina region of Croatia and Bosnia. Following the independence of Bosnia and formation of a new Yugoslav federation of Serbia and Montenegro, the old Yugoslav army was divided into two new armed forces due to UN sanctions imposed on the federation. Several months prior to May 1992 a division of armies and its assets was planned as authorities in Belgrade assessed its involvement in Bosnia would receive a hostile international reaction along with being accused of aggression. JNA General Veljko Kadijeviƒá was appointed to carry out the task by redeploying all Serbs from Bosnia to local Bosnian army units and removing any Serbs not from the area. As such Belgrade later claimed to be uninvolved in the Bosnian War while Bosnian Serb military forces remained under its control. Seen as reliable by Belgrade, Ratko Mladiƒá was promoted to general and given command over the Serbian armed forces in Bosnia while maintaining the fiction of a separate armed force as the old Yugoslav chain of command remained. Mladiƒá and Serb Bosnian forces under his command followed Belgrade's Serbian nationalist aims and objectives. Serb military forces in Croatia were also under the control of Belgrade. On 25‚Äì26 August 1993 at a gathering the Supreme Defense Council of retired generals, Milo≈°eviƒá's full control over the Yugoslav army was complete as the few remaining traces of the JNA were done away with. It was succeeded by the Army of Yugoslavia (Vojska Jugoslavije -VJ). Serbianisation continued during the first few years of the new military force through purges of personnel arising out of a need to ensure the loyalty of the armed forces to Milo≈°eviƒá. During the Yugoslav Wars, the Serbianised Yugoslav National Army was involved in the destruction of urban centres such as Sarajevo, Mostar and Vukovar. Territories within Bosnia conquered during the war by Bosnian Serbs were subjected to homogenisation and assimilation through Serbianisation. \\"Quoiqu'ils n'aient perdu aucune opportunit√© de les critiquer, ce ne sont donc pas ses dispositions juridiques qui ont emp√™ch√© les Serbes bosniaques de ratifier le document de Gen√®ve. A ce degr√© d'impr√©cision, forts de la licence d'interpr√©tation et d'action que leur ont toujours conc√©d√©e les responsables internationaux, ils √©taient d√©j√† assur√©s de poursuivre leur ≈ìuvre d'homog√©n√©isation et d'assi milation. Ainsi que, dans une moindre mesure, la ¬´ croatisation ¬ª au sud et au centre du pays, la ¬´ serbisation ¬ª continue dans les territoires conquis, gr√¢ce √† des m√©thodes plus discr√®tes - mais pas toujours moins brutales - que celles appliqu√©es le long des lignes de front et que les Musulmans √† leur tour sont condamn√©s √† em prunter pour √©largir leurs r√©duits.\\" The processes of Serbianisation of the Yugoslav army resulted in the creation of three Serbian armies under the control of Milo≈°eviƒá. Following the conclusion of the Yugoslav Wars of the early 1990s, the Serbianisation process of the Yugoslav army (JNA) was confirmed at the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) by witnesses. =Kosovo= In the late 1980s Milo≈°eviƒá promoted a Serbian nationalist platform that entailed the re-Serbianisation of two autonomous Yugoslav provinces, Kosovo and Vojvodina. \\"Belgrade envisagea d√®s 1986, puis d√©cida en 1989-1990, date o√π l'autonomie a √©t√© annul√©e par amendement de la Constitution, une serbisation √† marche forc√©.\\" On 23 March 1989, the autonomy of Kosovo within the Yugoslav federation was revoked by the government of the Serb Republic and Serbianisation of the province followed. During the 1990s under the government of Milo≈°eviƒá the Serbianisation of Kosovo occurred. Laws were passed by the parliament of Serbia that sought to change the power balance in Kosovo relating to the economy, demography and politics. Various measures included prohibiting the official use of Albanian, prevention of Albanian involvement in education, severely limiting the usage of Albanian symbols and efforts to deal with the imbalances of demography between Albanians and Serbs. In the education sector Serbian authorities pressed Albanian schools to follow the Serbian language curriculum and to achieve those aims Albanian teachers in the thousands were replaced with Serbs. The government imputed the mass dismissal of Albanian teachers to incompetence in the Serbian language, and that Kosovo educational institutions were centres for resistance and counterrevolution that indoctrinated Albanian students. Other reforms of the Kosovo education system segregated Albanian and Serb students within schools while funding, teaching staff and educational facilities were allocated for Serbian students and Albanian students received little. An entrance exam in Serbian literature and language became compulsory for students to pass in secondary schools. The Kosovo police force underwent Serbianisation after accusations of maltreatment toward non-Albanian civilians (mainly Serbs and Montenegrins) were made against ethnic Albanian police that resulted in their dismissal. The Kosovo Albanian police force was replaced with Serb special police units of the Serbian Interior Ministry. Albanians were against the measures and as such riot police and troops prevented them through force from going to school with some educational facilities being surrounded by tanks to stop attendance by students. The Kosovo police force that was newly Serbianised maltreated the Albanian population. \\"In 1989 Milosevic revoked the autonomous status of Kosovo and seriously marginal- ized the ethnic Albanian majority by banning the use of their language in schools and government, and allowing the newly Serbianized police force to abuse the Kosovar Albanian citizenry.\\" At the University of Pristina similar reforms occurred and lecturers that were not dismissed were required to use Serbian as the medium of instruction, with the level of Albanians at the university declining toward the conclusion of 1991. Pristina University along with its students became an important centre of Albanian resistance to Serbianisation. The parliament of Kosovo repudiated Serbianisation and made a declaration of the province's independence, established an alternative government and ministry of education. Demonstrations by Albanians were followed by more dismissals and reprisals in the education sector which led to the establishment of an Albanian parallel education system consisting of previously dismissed teachers giving lessons in private homes. Kosovan Albanian school textbooks of the interwar period of the 1990s referred to the Serbianisation of Kosovo through attempted colonisation and mass expulsion of Albanians by Serbs for a prolonged period of Kosovo's history in the twentieth century. Hospitals had their Albanian nurses and physicians dismissed. Another aspect of Serbianisation in Kosovo was the implementation of a discriminatory language policy. In 1991 public discourse was Serbianised through a campaign by the government such as targeting signs and government organs that became unfamiliar to many monolingual Albanians. Kosovo media was Serbianised as 1,300 employees of Radio & TV Pristina were dismissed with television coming under Belgrade control and a propaganda tool for the government. \\"Dans le domaine culturel par exemple, la pro c√©dure est all√©e d'une suppression pure et simple des organismes (du quotidien Rilindja, en juillet 1990, de l'Acad√©mie des sciences, en octobre 1991, des mus√©es et th√©√¢tres), √† une serbisation du personnel, d√©cr√©t√©e sur la base de l'artifice l√©gal que repr√©sente le d√©cret de ¬´ mesures temporaires ¬ª : tous les employ√©s albanais ont √©t√© chass√©s de la radio, de la t√©l√©vision (dont aussi bien les r√©dactions albanaises ont √©t√© supprim√©es en juin 1990), de la biblioth√®que, des maisons d'√©dition.\\" Albanian language newspapers were shut down and the most popular newspapers placed under the control of the government while other independent papers allowed to exist were under constant pressure from the state. Cultural institutions of Kosovo only showed Serbian productions. Albanian municipal officials and industrial workers were also dismissed from their employment. State sanctioned Serbianisation overall resulted in more than 100,000 Kosovo Albanians losing employment with many made to leave their apartments while their jobs were given to Serbs that migrated into the region. \\"Serbia's leaders strengthened the state's repressive apparatus and, over the course of the decade, revoked Kosovo's autonomy, fired over 100,000 ethnic Albanians from their posts, and limited political and property rights of Albanians in a process of forced \\"Serbianization\\".\\" At the time, for Serb nationalists the process of Serbianisation entailed the resettlement of Serbs to Kosovo and limiting the favorable demographic position Albanians held. Originating from the 1930s, the works of Vaso ƒåubriloviƒá, a Serb nationalist writer became popular in Serbia during the 1990s and their content called for the dislocation of Albanians through mass resettlement. In 1995, a Serb Radical politician Vojislav ≈†e≈°elj wrote in the publication Velika Srbija (Greater Serbia) a memorandum that outlined the Serbianisation of Kosovo. ≈†e≈°elj called for violence and expulsion against Albanians and their leadership with aims toward discrediting them within Western public opinion. Following similar themes the parliament of Serbia on 11 January 1995 passed the Decree for Colonisation of Kosovo of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It outlined government benefits for Serbs who desired to live in Kosovo with loans to build homes or purchase other dwellings and offered free plots of land. \\"The Serbian parliament proceeded to pass a series of laws designed to reshape the demographic, economic and political balance of power in Kosovo. In an attempted 'Serbization' programme, tens of thousands of Kosovo Albanian doctors, municipal officials, teachers and industrial workers were sacked from their jobs, while ethnic Serbs were given economic incentives to live in Kosovo. The Serbian government replaced local Albanian police officers with special police units from the Serbian Ministry of the Interior.\\" Few Serbs took up the offer due to the worsening situation in Kosovo at the time. The government in 1995 resorted to forcefully resettling in Kosovo Serb refugees from Croatia, with most leaving thereafter and few remaining that increased tensions in the area. Serbs selling property to Albanians was made illegal by the government. Fines existed for ethnic Albanians that did not undertake military service in Bosnia and Croatia. The government also made if difficult for Albanians living oversees to return, and penalties existed for ethnic Albanian families that had more than one child while Kosovo Serbs were rewarded for having multiple children. Serbianisation of the Kosovo economy also occurred with areas inhabited by Serbs receiving investment, new infrastructure and employment opportunities, while Albanians overall were either excluded or had limited economic participation. The Kosovo war began in 1998. In January 1999, the government authoritires initiated a planned offensive against Kosovo Albanians that involved the violent liquidation of assets aimed at their displacement and Serbianisation of the region. =Serbian language= Following the breakup of Yugoslavia, the official language Serbo-Croatian broke up into separate official languages and the process in relation to Serbian involved the Serbianisation of its lexicon. 21st century=North Macedonia The historical event that created the Yugoslav Macedonian republic on 2 August 1944 is viewed differently through political party rivalries. The Social Democrats (SDSM) celebrate it and the VMRO-DPMNE condemn it as part of a Serbification project. Under the leadership of Nikola Gruevski (2006‚Äì2016), the then-governing VMRO-DPMNE would embrace a pro-Serbian policy.Jasmin Mujanovic, Hunger and Fury: The Crisis of Democracy in the Balkans, Oxford University Press, 2018, , pp. 115; 162. In 2015 the former Prime Minister and leader of the VMRO-NP, Ljubƒço Georgievski told Radio Free Europe that the authorities had a clear goal: to keep the country closer to Serbia, and at some future stage to join the northern neighbour. According to him a classical pro-Yugoslav policy was being conducted, where confrontation with all the other neighbors was taking place, but the border between Macedonian and Serbian national identity had been erased.–†–∞–¥–∏–æ –°–ª–æ–±–æ–¥–Ω–∞ –ï–≤—Ä–æ–ø–∞, —ò–∞–Ω—É–∞—Ä–∏ 23, 2015, –ú–∞—Ä–∏—ò–∞ –ú–∏—Ç–µ–≤—Å–∫–∞, –°—Ä–±–∏–∑–∞—Ü–∏—ò–∞ –Ω–∞ –ú–∞–∫–µ–¥–æ–Ω–∏—ò–∞? \\"Stop the Serbian assimilation of the Macedonian nation\\" was the motto of the billboards that were placed then on Skopje streets, through which the Party launched a campaign for preserving the Macedonian national identity.

The program was formally inaugurated with a series of listings on October 9, 1960; as of February 16, 2017, there are 2,596 designated landmarks. A National Historic Landmark (NHL) is generally a building, district, object, site, or structure, that is officially recognized by the United States government for its national historical significance. A National Historic Landmark District (NHLD) is a historic district that is recognized as an NHL. Its geographic area may include contributing properties that are buildings, structures, sites or objects, and it may include non-contributing properties. The program is administered by the National Park Service (NPS), a branch of the Department of the Interior. The National Park Service determines which properties meet NHL criteria and makes nomination recommendations after an owner notification process. The Secretary of the Interior reviews nominations and, based on a set of predetermined criteria, makes a decision on NHL designation or a determination of eligibility for designation. Both public and privately owned properties can be designated as NHLs. This designation provides indirect, partial protection of the historic integrity of the properties via tax incentives, grants, monitoring of threats, and other means. Owners may object to the nomination of the property as a NHL. When this is the case the Secretary of the Interior can only designate a site as eligible for designation. All NHLs are also included on the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), a list of some 80,000 historic properties that the National Park Service deems to be worthy of recognition. The primary difference between a NHL and a NRHP listing is that the NHLs are determined to have national significance, while other NRHP properties are deemed significant at the local or state level. Tabular listing Most landmark designations are in one of the 50 states. New York is the state with the most (270), and New York City, with 114 designations, is the city with the largest number of designations. Of the states, North Dakota has the fewest designations with seven. Three cities (New York City, Philadelphia, and Boston) have enough listings to warrant lists separate from their respective states. A small number of designations have been made outside the 50 states. Most of these appear in United States possessions. The Virgin Islands have five listings, Puerto Rico has four, and island possessions in the South Pacific have six. Five listings are found in Pacific island nations with which the U.S. has established a free association agreement, and one listing, the American Legation in Tangier (the nation's first foreign public property), is found in the unaffiliated Kingdom of Morocco. {class=\\"wikitable sortable\\" align=\\"center\\" ! scope=\\"col\\" State or region ! scope=\\"col\\"Number of landmarks ! scope=\\"col\\"Earliest declared ! scope=\\"col\\"Latest declared ! class=\\"unsortable\\" scope=\\"col\\" Example - align=\\"center\\"  Alabama 100px - align=\\"center\\"  Alaska Holy Assumption Orthodox Church - align=\\"center\\"  Arizona  Hoover Dam overlaps and is counted in both Arizona and Nevada.  100px - align=\\"center\\"  Arkansas Central High School - align=\\"center\\"  California  Yuma Crossing and Associated Sites included in both Arizona and California  The Mission San Carlos Borromeo de Carmelo - align=\\"center\\"  Colorado A steam locomotive of the D&SNG; - align=\\"center\\"  Connecticut 100px - align=\\"center\\"  Delaware 100px - align=\\"center\\"  Florida The Ernest Hemingway House in Key West. - align=\\"center\\"  Georgia Etowah Indian Mounds - align=\\"center\\"  Hawaii The church established by Father Damien at the Kalaupapa Leprosy Settlement. - align=\\"center\\"  Idaho Experimental Breeder Reactor No. 1. - align=\\"center\\"  Illinois  Eads Bridge overlaps and is counted in both Illinois and Missouri  Lincoln's Tomb - align=\\"center\\"  Indiana North Christian Church, a historic example of modern architecture. - align=\\"center\\"  Iowa 100px - align=\\"center\\"  Kansas Grant Hall at Fort Leavenworth. - align=\\"center\\"  Kentucky Belle of Louisville - align=\\"center\\"  Louisiana Louisiana State Capitol - align=\\"center\\"  Maine 100px - align=\\"center\\"  Maryland  Washington Aqueduct included in both Maryland and Washington, D.C.

History Partiz√°nske is a relatively young town. Its history starts in 1938‚Äì1939, when Jan Anton√≠n Ba≈•a of Zl√≠n and his powerful network of companies built a shoe factory in the cadastral area of ≈†imonovany municipality. The newly created settlement for workers carried the name of Ba≈•ovany and was part of ≈†imonovany. With the growth of the factory, so grew the settlement. The whole municipality was renamed to Ba≈•ovany in 1948 and given town status. As a sign of recognition of local inhabitants fighting in the Slovak National Uprising, the town was renamed Partiz√°nske on 9 February 1949. (Slovak) The factory was renamed by communists to Z√°vody 29. augusta (29 August works) and it produced 30 million pairs of shoes and employed around 10,000 people. However, after a failed privatisation in the 1990s, only a fraction is left now. Demographics According to the 2001 census, the town had 24,907 inhabitants. 97.71% of inhabitants were Slovaks, 0.69% Czechs and 0.35% Roma.

They have been with several independent labels, including Upper Cut, Poptones, Alternative Tentacles, Bittersweet, Shock, Cheap Lullaby, Vicious Circle, and Anodyne. History Kekaula and Vennum founded the BellRays on the dissolution of previous group The Rosethorns, a group formed by Vennum in 1986, which Kekaula joined in 1988; the band released an album Ralph's Mom & Dad in 1990; songs from the album were later rerecorded by the BellRays. The BellRays released their first album In the Light of the Sun on cassette in 1993, featuring drummer Ray Chin and keyboardist Jim Kerwin. Tony Bramel (aka Tony Fate) produced and played bass on the recording and joined the band permanently as guitarist in 1996, with Vennum switching to bass. The following albums Let It Blast and Grand Fury were recorded live in the band's rehearsal space. Fourth album The Red, White & Black (2003) was released on the Poptones label in the UK and Alternative Tentacles in the US. Craig Waters replaced Chin as drummer for the band's next two records Have a Little Faith and Hard, Sweet and Sticky, the latter featuring Billy Mohler on production and bass guitar, Bob Vennum having switched back to lead guitar with the departure of Tony Fate.

The House of Lords does not have such committees, as Bills are usually considered by the House as a whole. When a Bill has received its Second Reading in the House of Commons, it reaches its committee stage. The Bill is then usually sent to a public bill committee for consideration. However, some bills are considered not by a public bill committee but by a Committee of the Whole House; in this case, amendments are proposed and discussed by the entire House of Commons. This applies to some key clauses of Finance Bills, which are proposed by the Chancellor of the Exchequer every year in March/April, and to some occasional bills such as the 1998/99 House of Lords Reform Bill. The job of public bill committees is to debate and consider amendments to a Bill. The committee considers each Bill clause by clause, and may amend it (the House then considers the bill as amended at the Bill's Report Stage). Under the post-2006 House of Commons procedure, public bill committees may take a limited amount of evidence (akin to a select committee) on certain bills committed to them. Members of the public can make written submissions to public bill committees after the Second Reading debate, by emailing the Scrutiny Unit.House of Commons - Public Bill Committee Written Submissions The composition of the committee is roughly proportional to that of the House itself, so it is rare that amendments are accepted that are contrary to a majority Government's wishes. As the overall purpose of a Bill has been set by its Second Reading in the House, amendments at the committee stage may not make drastic changes.

These plant viruses cause diseases in their host plants. Typical symptoms are chlorotic stripes on the affected leaves. This group of viruses also make viral inclusions in infected cells which can be used to diagnose infection. Virology The virion particle consists of non-enveloped nucleocapsids that exhibit helical symmetry, forming thin, filamentous structures between 500‚Äì2100 nm long. The genomes are segmented and consist of four to six strands of negative-sense single-stranded RNA and the N-protein. These viruses are transmitted by an arthropod vectors in the families Cicadellidae or Delphacidae. Tenuivirus genome is segmented and has an ambisense coding strategy. Diseases Maize stripe disease, thought to be caused by Maize stripe virus, is a disease of Maize that is characterized by leaf blight and stunting of the plant. Rice stripe virus and Rice hoja blanca virus has been shown to cause Rice stripe disease and Rice hoja blanca disease respectively, resulting in leaf blight and death of rice plants . Rice grassy stunt disease is caused by Rice grassy stunt virus which results in stunting of rice plants and an excessive tiller Taxonomy Tenuivirus has close phylogenic relationship with members of the genus Tospovirus, the virions of which are bounded with an envelope. Tenuivirus encodes a membrane protein precursor that is homologue to the virion envelope protein of Tospoviridae, although no envelope was found to associate with Tenuivirus virion.

He also played in Japan with the Orix Blue Wave in . Cabrera started his career with the Blue Jays, playing three games with them before being traded to the Braves for Jim Acker in the middle of the 1989 season. Cabrera was a reserve for most of his career and had his best season in in which he played sixty-three games and had 137 at-bats, getting 38 hits, with seven home runs. Career highlights=August 21, 1991 Cabrera is credited with hitting the home run that marked the turning point in the history of the Atlanta Braves. On Wednesday, August 21, 1991, the Braves played the Reds and entered the ninth inning trailing, 9‚Äì6. Reds ace reliever Rob Dibble was on the mound with two outs. Cabrera had started the game to give Braves starter Greg Olson a much-needed rest. With two outs, David Justice doubled, and Brian Hunter walked to bring Cabrera to the plate with the tying run. He responded with a three-run homer off Dibble to tie the game, and the Braves eventually won in 13 innings. The game kept them 2.5 games behind the Dodgers in a race they eventually won by one game. The Braves went 29‚Äì12 after Cabrera's home run and eventually reached the World Series before losing to the Twins in seven games. 1992 National League Championship Series Cabrera is best known for his two out game-winning pinch hit off of Stan Belinda in the 9th inning of the 7th and deciding game of the 1992 National League Championship Series that put the Braves into the World Series. Cabrera hit a line drive over shortstop Jay Bell on a 2‚Äì1 pitch to left field that scored David Justice and a slow footed Sid Bream, who barely beat a left-field throw from Barry Bonds to win the pennant for the Braves. Amazingly, before this pinch hit, Cabrera had batted only ten times during the 1992 season. This marked the end of the three-year divisional championship run of the Pittsburgh Pirates, who after the 1992 season lost Bonds, Doug Drabek, and other key players from those championship teams. The Pirates did not have another winning season until 2013.

Name development The name of the settlement has gone through multiple developments. Prior to 1237, the settlement was known as a place with a toll station. In 1237, first name of the settlmenet emerges, as a combination of Latin and Hungarian, with the town called Cristur (later Kerest√∫r), which translates to The Cross of the Lord. Back then, the settlement was split between the dominions of the ≈†√°≈°ov Castle and the Benedictine Abbey of Hronsk√Ω Be≈àadik. In 1773, the village was known as Holy Cross, in various language versions, including Latin (Sancta Crux), Hungarian (Szent Kereszt), German (Heiligs Cre√ºtz) or Slovak (Swaty Kriss). Similar names were recorded in 1808, despite minor influence caused by linguistic developments. In 1873, Hungarian name Barsszentkereszt is used, but the same changes at the turn of the 19th and 20th century into Garamszentkereszt (translates to: The Holy Cross upon Hron). After the formation of the First Czechoslovak Republic, the settlmenet was known as Sv√§t√Ω Kr√≠≈æ nad Hronom in Slovak, copying the earlier Hungarian name. Although, historically synonymous with the settlement, the name Kerest√∫r was used by Zempl√≠nska Teplica in the early 20th century.In May 1953, when aluminium manufacturing and metallurgy began to flourish in the settlement, it impacted the life and the name of the city. In combination with the anti- religious sentiment of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic, the name was changed to the current version ≈Ωiar nad Hronom, which translates to glare upon Hron. Geography It is located in the ≈Ωiar Basin, on the Hron river, around 40 km from Bansk√° Bystrica and 170 km from Bratislava. In addition to the main settlement, the city includes two annexed neighbourhoods: ghost village of Horn√© Opatovce (since 1969) and a ≈†√°≈°ovsk√© Podhradie, south-east of the city, annexed in 1971. The city is the administrative seat of ≈Ωiar nad Hronom District. Average year temperature is 8 ¬∞C, with frequent rainfall. History=Earliest settlement Celtic tribes had lived in the area, as documented by sizable archeologic discoveries dating to 6th century. Following the 10th century, the local population was mostly Slavic and the Celtic culture and settlement had receded. Middle Ages The first written record is dated to 1075, when a charter, issued by Hungarian king G√©za I of Hungary, had established the Benedictine Abbey of Hronsk√Ω Be≈àadik. On 4 February 1246 the landowner and the Archbishop of Esztergom, Stephen I B√°ncsa, had elevated the status of the settlement, submitting surrounding villages to the dominion and granting the citizens further rights. The settlement was submitted to the ≈†√°≈°ov Castle. In the same period, the village had developed into a small town and became known as an administrative and cultural core of the region, due to the growth of commerce and the rise of trade guilds. Late Middle Ages and early Modernity The following period, until the 16th century, saw the flourishment of guilds, like that of tailors or shoemakers. A chateau (manor house) was erected and became the town's landmark in 1631, building on a preceding structure, on the orders of P√©ter Cardinal P√°zm√°ny. Later, it became a summer residence for the Archbishop of Esztergom. The manor had undergone multiple renovations due to various unrests and uprisings. One such uprising in the area was a late sequel of Anti-Habsburg rebellions, which lasted until 1621. Following the suppression of the uprising Habsburg army had remained in the area to protect from the advancing Ottoman troops, which had worried the local population. The Ottomans, eventually, had failed to conquer Bansk√° ≈†tiavnica some 25 kilometers south. Even later 17th century was not easy for the local population, as the region had suffered from continued armed conflicts and plague, originating in Italy. During the conflicts the town and the ≈†√°≈°ov castle, a hub of the rebels, were besieged and conquered. The area was badly struck by the events and it had recovered for a long time, as its economy had to be renewed. The town received the right to host fairs in 1690. After the establishment of Diocese of Bansk√° Bystrica and following a renovation, the chateu became the seat of the Bishop and a representative building. ≈†tefan Moyses had resided here in the 19th century. 20th century The city becomes a seat of a District in 1923. The district was split between districts based in Kremnica and Nov√° Ba≈àa. This was caused by the administrative reorganisation of the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic. The city had regained the status of the district seat in the 1960 and retained it after Slovak independence in 1993. The cities importance declined after 1996, when cities of ≈Ωarnovica and Nov√° Ba≈àa and nearby villages, which were previously a part of the District, became the seats of two independent administrative districts. During World War II the city was occupied by the German Army until 1945, when it was liberated by the advancing Red Army. The city and the surrounded areas were known hubs for partisan fighters of the Slovak National Uprising. Major socio-economic growth in the city began with the development of an aluminium plant, which was established in 1953, under the name Slovak National Uprising Works (Z√°vody Slovensk√©ho n√°rodn√©ho povstania). This had caused a boom of employment opportunities in the city. Industrial development had essentially completed the transformation of the village or a small town into a city, as it encouraged construction of schools and housing, in form of standardised apartment blocks, as well as individual construction. Overall, the city became largely self-sufficient. Between 1969 and 1991 the city had annexed nearby villages of Lutila and Ladomersk√° Vieska, which are now independent. ≈†√°≈°ovsk√© Podhradie and a ghost village of Horn√© Opatovce, annexed in the same period, remain a part of the city to this day. Demographics The population of the city grew until 1996 and dropped below 20,000 in 2002, not exceeding the mark since. According to the 2001 census, the town had 19,945 inhabitants. 94.27% of inhabitants were Slovaks, 1.97% Roma, 0.95% Czechs and 0.69% Hungarians. The religious make-up was 62.07% Roman Catholics, 25.54% people with no religious affiliation and 3.19% Lutherans. In 2011 census, had shown a population of 19 883 citizens. Of these 78,9% identified themselves as Slovaks, 2,84% as Roma, 0,5% as Czechs and 0,4% as Hungarians. Over 18% did not chose a national identification. The 2011 census was first national census with this option. In the same year, 48.75% of the city identified as Roman Catholic, 2.4% identified as Lutheran. Only one person identified as a Jew, despite city's significant Jewish population before the war. Economy The main employer is company Nemak Slovakia, member of Nemak Group, worldwide largest producer of aluminum powertrain parts for vehicles and the metallurgy factory company Slovalco, formerly called Z√°vody Slovensk√©ho n√°rodn√©ho povstania (\\"Slovak National Uprising Works\\"), built in the 1950s. Healthcare Hospital in ≈Ωiar nad Hronom is a part of the network of regional hospitals - Svet zdravia, a.s, which is owned by Penta Investments. Culture=Landmarks *≈†√°≈°ov Castle - A ruin of gothic castle, dated first half of the 13th century, guarding the Hron gorge. It is located in the city's part of ≈†√°≈°ovsk√© Podhradie. The first written record dates back to 1253. The castle became a royal castle in the 14th century. It had multiple owners in the difficult 17th century. It was captured by the anti-Habsburg Kuruc troops of Emeric Th√∂k√∂ly and later regained by the imperial army. As its importance declined and due to numerous falls, the fortress was abandoned in the 18th century. *Roman Catholic Church of the Exaltation of the Holy Cross - A single-nave, classical church with two towers and a rectangular presbytery. It was built on top of an older structure at the initiative of the Bishop of Bansk√° Bystrica Gabriel Zerdahely. The facade is dominated by a portico of Toscan pillars, topped by a triangular tympanum, bearing Bishop Zerdahely's coat of arms. The segmented attic is decorated by a Latin inscription reading: \\"Fugite partes adversae\\" (\\"Begone, all evil powers!\\", as written in the prayer of exorcism by St. Anthony of Padua). The towers are lined with pilasters and topped with a crowning ledge. A crypt below the church contains the remains of ≈†tefan Moyses and Michal Chr√°stek. *Roman Catholic Church of St. Lawrence in Horn√© Opatovce - The historically gothic structure with polygonal presbytery and an ejected tower was reconstructed between 1710 ‚Äì 1711, 1777 and finally in 1911, which added some Neo-Roman elements. Facade is decorated by frieze, supportive pillars and chambranles. The tower is topped by a pyramid helmet. *Bishop's chateau - The four-wing, three-level building with two corner towers and from the late- Renaissance and Baroque era, from 1631. It is built on top of medieval foundation. The last major reconstruction took place between 1850 ‚Äì 1869, when the upper floor was built. Chateau's facade is decorated by chambranle windows and window cornices. The chateau neighbours a park, which was developed in the second half of the 18th century. Monuments *≈†tefan Moyses Statue at Matica slovensk√° Square *Ladislav Exn√°r Monument at Dr. J√°nsky Street *Michal Chr√°stek Monument *Karol D√∫bravsk√Ω Monument Museums *Archeological Exposition and Gallery of the Archeological Institute of Slovak Academy of Sciences Observatories *Regional Maximili√°n Hell Observatory and Planetarium EventsNatives' Meeting in Horn√© Opatovce= The village of Horn√© Opatovce had been through a turbulent period after the construction of aluminium plant in ≈Ωiar nad Hronom. The plant was in the immediate proximity of the village. When the production had commenced, technological standards and processes were insufficient to sustain the life in the settlement. Fauna had begun to disappear from the area and the public health had deteriorated. The village was repeatedly covered by fine ashes from the nearby plant chimneys. The government had decided to abolish the village by decree in 1969. Majority of the original population had resettled to then- expanding town of ≈Ωiar nad Hronom, as well as nearby village of Hlin√≠k nad Hronom, or other major cities across the country. Natives and their relatives meet annually in the St. Lawrence Church in the village and commemorate their village of origin. =≈Ωiar Fair= ≈Ωiarsky jarmok (translates to 'Fair of ≈Ωiar nad Hronom') is annual event hosted in October. It is a continuation of a historic tradition of trading fairs hosted by towns and cities across the country, where craftsman, artisans and other smiths met and traded their works. The Fair was one of the better-known fairs across Slovakia. Contemporarily, it is popular for its entertainment, rides, musical performances, traditional food or game stalls. =City ball= During the ball season (in Slovakia the season usually lasts between the Epiphany, lasting until Ash Wednesday), the municipality organises a City ball. It serves as an opportunity for socialisation of citizens, as well as persons of domestic and foreign cultural, social and professional lives. It enjoys relatively high turnouts and good reviews among the attendees. =City Fest= City Fest is an annual one-day summer festival, taking place in ≈†tefan Moyses Park. It usually take place in August. It enjoys large crowds from the city, region and beyond. Annually, it features leading artists of Slovak and Czech pop music. Usually, in the early hours, it features children's artists, followed by local and regional musicians in the afternoon, followed by headliners until the night. Transportation The city is intersected by the R1 Expressway, with an exit near ≈†√°≈°ovsk√© Podhradie. Road I/9 leads to Prievidza. R2 serves for transit purposes, surpassing the city, connecting on to I/9 and R1. R2 line was required due to urban roads having insufficient capacity, to accommodate contemporary traffic. The connection to the highway system and the geographical location make ≈Ωiar nad Hronom a notable crossroad. Road I/65 passes through Horn√© Opatovce and the neighbouring village of Ladomersk√° Vieska. Public transportation Public transport in the city is appropriate for its size and population, consisting entirely of a bus fleet. Services are more frequent in the morning and in the afternoon. Its serves two major purposes: commute of the workforce to and from the industrial park south of the city and the commute of children to and from schools. It also serves the population of nearby villages, mainly Lutila and Ladomersk√° Vieska. Train The Nov√© Z√°mky - Zvolen railway passes through the city, allowing travel to Bratislava, as well as Ko≈°ice. The train station became more notable with the construction of the SNP Works in the 1950s, due to the railways being a major mean of sourcing raw materials and shipment of the products. Education There are 4 primary schools in the city (numbered I., II., IV. and a Catholic ≈†tefan Moyses' Primary School), for children aged 6‚Äì15. Additionally, there are multiple kindegartens in the city. Middle (high) schools, for students aged 15‚Äì19, number five: *Milan R√∫fus' Gymnasium at J√°n Koll√°r St. *Private Business Academy *Private Technical High Schools *Hotel Academy *Private Pedagogical and Social Academy EBG Economy At the start of the 20th century, the town was an agricultural settlement, with citizens cultivating the fields of the ≈Ωiar Basin. After World War II, the only aluminium plant in Czechoslovakia was developed in the town, with production commencing in 1953, securing thousands of work places. The Works have been a base for town's transformation into an industrial city. With the growth of the aluminium plant came the population boom, supported by domestic migration. The SNP Works were privatised in 2002, with Penta winning over 40% of the shares. Some of the old parts of the plant are no longer in use. The industrial park now houses multiple private companies.

A spur route of Autoroute 40, the A-740 runs for on a north-south axis (parallel to the St. Lawrence River through the boroughs of Sainte-Foy‚ÄìSillery‚ÄìCap-Rouge and Les Rivi√®res, with interchanges at the A-440 at exit 4 and the A-40 at exit 9. Originally named the Autoroute du Vallon for the 17th century road it replaced, in 2006, the Quebec government under then-Premier Jean Charest renamed the highway Autoroute Robert-Bourassa, in honour of a long serving former Quebec Premier. Route description The A-740 begins at an intersection with Route 175 (Also called Boulevard Laurier) in suburban Sainte-Foy, tracing the western limits of Universit√© Laval along the northbound lanes and Place Sainte-Foy (a regional shopping mall) along the southbound lanes. Once past the university, the A-740 enters a 300 m tunnel, passing under heavily travelled chemin Sainte-Foy and chemin Quatre-Bourgeois. Passing to the west of C√©gep de Sainte-Foy, the A-740 approaches the interchange with the A-440 at exit 4. From here, motorists on the A-440 can travel east (which becomes Boulevard Charest) towards the city centre or west to an interchange with the A-40 and A-73, affording access to Jean Lesage International Airport and points south and west. Continuing north, the A-440 passes to the west of an industrial park, meets Route 138 at exit 7, then crosses the Saint-Charles River to an interchange with Boulevard P√®re-Leli√®vre at exit 8 on the north shore. The autoroute provides the eastern boundary for a municipal park before meeting the A-40/A-73 (a concurrent route) at a cloverleaf interchange. The A-740 ends shortly after the A-40/A-73 interchange, passing to the west of the Galeries de la Capitale (another regional shopping mall) to an intersection with Boulevard Lebourgneuf. The original plans called for the A-740 to continue northward after the first section opened in 1982, and so the government preserved the autoroute's intended path. Instead, in 2006, an urban boulevard (Boulevard Robert- Bourassa) was opened on this right of way, running for from the northern terminus of the A-740 to Route 369 (Boulevard Bastien). This new route was intended to provide an alternative to the heavily travelled Boulevard St. Jacques (which it parallels).

As the Turkic states developed and grew, there were many instances of this cultural shift. An early form of Turkification occurred in the time of the Seljuk Empire among the local population of Anatolia, involving intermarriages, religious conversion, linguistic shift and interethnic relationships, which today is reflected in the genetic makeup of the modern Turkish people. Diverse peoples were affected by Turkification including Anatolian, Balkan, Caucasian, and Middle Eastern peoples with different ethnic origins, such as Albanians, Armenians, Assyrians, Circassians, Georgians, Greeks, Jews, Romani, Slavs, Kurds living in Anatolia, as well as Lazs from all the regions of the Ottoman Empire.Janissaries in the Ottoman army were largely of Christian origin.Goodwin, Jason (1998). Lords of the Horizons: A History of the Ottoman Empire. New York: H. Holt, 59,179‚Äì181. .The New Encyclopedia of Islam, ed. Cyril Glass√©, Rowman & Littlefield, 2008, p.129  Etymology  Prior to the 20th century, Anatolian, Balkan, Caucasian, and Middle Eastern regions were said to undergo Ottomanization. \\"Turkification\\" started being used interchangeably with \\"Ottomanization\\" after the rise of Turkish nationalism in the 20th century. The term has been used in the Greek language since the 1300s or late-Byzantine era as \\"ŒµŒ∫œÑŒøœÖœÅŒ∫ŒπœÉŒºœåœÇ\\", or \\"œÑŒøœçœÅŒ∫ŒµŒºŒ±\\". It literally means \\"becoming Turk\\". Apart from persons, it may refer also to cities that were conquered by Turks or churches that were converted to mosques. It is more frequently used in the form of the verb \\"œÑŒøœÖœÅŒ∫Œµœçœâ\\" (turkify, become Muslim or Turk). Emile Louis Jean Legrand, Chrestomathie grecque moderne, 1899, p. 479. \\"œÑŒøœÖœÅŒ∫Œµœçœâ, rendre turc, se faire turc.  History  By 750 the Turkification of Kashgar by the Qarluq Turks was underway. The Qarluqs were ancestors of the Karakhanids, who also Islamized the population. The Iranian language of Khwarezm, a Central Asian oasis region, eventually died out as a result of Turkification. Native Iranian population of Central Asia and the steppes part of the region, had also been turkified by the migrating Turkic tribes of Inner Asia by the 6th century A.D. The process of Turkification of Central Asia, besides those parts that today constitute the territory of the present-day Tajikistan, accelerated with the Mongol conquest of Central Asia.Hooman Peimani, \\"Conflict and Security in Central Asia and the Caucasus\\", ABC-CLIO, LLC, 2009, p.144  Arrival of Turks to Anatolia  Illustration of the registration of Christian boys for the dev≈üirme. Ottoman miniature painting, 1558.) Anatolia was home to many different peoples in ancient times who were either natives or settlers and invaders. These different people included the Armenians, Anatolian peoples, Persians, Hurrians, Greeks, Cimmerians, Galatians, Colchians, Iberians, Arameans, Assyrians, Corduenes, and scores of others. The presence of many Greeks, the process of Hellenization, and the similarity of some of the native languages of Anatolia to Greek (cf. Phrygian), gradually caused many of these peoples to abandon their own languages in favor of the eastern Mediterranean lingua franca, Koine Greek, a process reinforced by Romanization. By the 5th century the native people of Asia Minor were entirely Greek in their language and Christian in religion. These Greek Christian inhabitants of Asia Minor are known as Byzantine Greeks, and they formed the bulk of the Byzantine Empire's Greek-speaking population for one thousand years, from the 5th century until the fall of the Byzantine state in the 15th century. In the northeast along the Black Sea these peoples eventually formed their own state known as the Empire of Trebizond, which gave rise to the modern Pontic Greek population. In the east, near the borderlands with the Persian Empire, other native languages remained, specifically Armenian, Assyrian Aramaic, and Kurdish.Mitchell, Stephen. 1993. Anatolia: land, men and gods in Asia Minor. Vol. 1, The Celts, and the impact of Roman rule. Clarendon Press. pp.172‚Äì176. Byzantine authorities routinely conducted large-scale population transfers in an effort to impose religious uniformity and quell rebellions. After the subordination of the First Bulgarian Empire in 1018, for instance, much of its army was resettled in Eastern Anatolia. The Byzantines were particularly keen to assimilate the large Armenian population. To that end, in the eleventh century, the Armenian nobility were removed from their lands and resettled throughout western Anatolia with prominent families subsumed into the Byzantine nobility, leading to numerous Byzantine generals and emperors of Armenian extraction. These resettlements spread the Armenian- speaking community deep into Asia Minor, but an unintended consequence was the loss of local military leadership along the eastern Byzantine frontier, opening the path for the inroads of Turkish invaders. Beginning in the eleventh century, war between the Turks and Byzantines led to the deaths of many in Asia Minor, while others were enslaved and removed.(Vryonis 1971: 172) As areas became depopulated, Turkic nomads moved in with their herds.(Vryonis 1971: 184‚Äì194) =Number of pastoralists of Turkic origin in Anatolia = The number of nomads of Turkic origin that migrated to Anatolia is a matter of discussion. According to Ibn Sa'id al-Maghribi, there were 200,000 Turkmen tents in Denizli and its surrounding areas, 30,000 in Bolu and its environment, and about 100,000 in Kastamonu and its environment. According to a Latin source at the end of the 12th century there were 100,000 nomadic tents in the regions of Denizli and Isparta. According to Ottoman tax archives, in modern-day Anatolia, in Anatolia Eyalet, Karaman Eyalet, Dulkadir Eyalet and R√ªm Eyalet provinces there were about 872,610 households in the 1520s and 1530s; 160,564 of those households were nomadic, and the remainder were sedentary. Of four provinces, province of Anatolia had the largest nomadic population with 77,268 households. (note: province of Anatolia does not include entire Anatolia, it includes Western Anatolia and some parts of Northwestern Anatolia only) Between 1570 and 1580, 220,217 households of the total 1,360,474 households in the four provinces were nomadic which means, at least 20% of Anatolia was still nomadic in the 16th century. The province of Anatolia, which had the largest nomadic population with 77,268, saw an increase in its nomadic population. 116,219 households in those years in province of Anatolia were nomadic. = Dev≈üirme = Dev≈üirme (literally \\"collecting\\" in Turkish), also known as the blood tax, was chiefly the annual practice by which the Ottoman Empire sent military to press second or third sons of their Christian subjects (Rum millet) in the villages of the Balkans into military training as janissaries. They were then converted to IslamThe New Encyclopedia of Islam, Ed. Cyril Glass√©, (Rowman & Littlefield, 2008), 129. with the primary objective of selecting and training the ablest children for the military or civil service of the Empire, notably into the Janissaries.Basgoz, I. & Wilson, H. E. (1989), The educational tradition of the Ottoman Empire and the development of the Turkish educational system of the republican era. Turkish Review 3(16), 15. Started by Murad I as a means to counteract the growing power of the Turkish nobility, the practice itself violated Islamic law. Yet by 1648, the practice was slowly drawing to an end. An attempt to re-institute it in 1703 was resisted by its Ottoman members who coveted its military and civilian posts. Finally in the early part of Ahmet III's reign, the practice of devshirme was abolished.  Late Ottoman era  The late Ottoman government sought to create \\"a core identity with a single Turkish religion, language, history, tradition, culture and set of customs\\", replacing earlier Ottoman traditions that had not sought to assimilate different religions or ethnic groups. The Ottoman Empire had an ethnically diverse population that included Turks, Arabs, Albanians, Bosniaks, Greeks, Persians, Bulgarians, Serbs, Armenians, Kurds, Zazas, Circassians, Assyrians, Jews and Laz people. Turkish nationalists claimed that only Turks were loyal to the state. Ideological support for Turkification was not widespread in the Ottoman Empire. One of its main supporters was sociologist and political activist Ziya G√∂kalp who believed that a modern state must become homogeneous in terms of culture, religion, and national identity.Akcam, Taner. A Shameful Act. 2006, page 88. This conception of national identity was augmented by his belief in the primacy of Turkishness, as a unifying virtue. As part of this belief, it was necessary to purge from the territories of the state those national groups who could threaten the integrity of a modern Turkish nation state.Bloxham. p. 150 Levene (1998) The 18th article of the Ottoman Constitution of 1876 declared Turkish the sole official language, and that only Turkish speaking people could be employed in the government. After the Young Turks assumed power in 1909, the policy of Turkification received several new layers and it was sought to impose Turkish in the administration, the courts and education in the areas where the Arabic speaking population was the majority. Another aim was to loosen ties between the Empire's Turk and ethnically non-Turkish populations through efforts to purify the Turkish language of Arabic influences. In this nationalist vision of Turkish identity, language was supreme and religion relegated to a subordinate role. Arabs responded by asserting the superiority of Arabic language, describing Turkish as a \\"mongrel\\" language that had borrowed heavily from the Persian and Arabic languages. Through the policy of Turkification, the Young Turk government suppressed Arabic language. Turkish teachers were hired to replace Arabic teachers at schools. The Ottoman postal service was administrated in Turkish. Those who supported Turkification were accused of harming Islam. Rashid Rida was an advocate who supported Arabic against Turkish. Even before the Young Turk Revolution of 1908, the Syrian Reformer Tahrir al-Jazairi had convinced Midhat Pasha to adopt Arabic as the official language of instruction at state schools. The language of instruction was only changed to Turkish in 1885 under Sultan Abdulhamid. Though writers like Ernest Dawn have noted that the foundations of Second Constitutional Era \\"Arabism\\" predate 1908, the prevailing view still holds that Arab nationalism emerged as a response to the Ottoman Empire's Turkification policies. One historian of Arab nationalism wrote that: \\"the Unionists introduced a grave provocation by opposing the Arab language and adopting a policy of Turkification\\", but not all scholars agree about the contribution of Turkification policies to Arab nationalism. European critics who accused the CUP of depriving non-Turks of their rights through Turkification saw Turk, Ottoman and Muslim as synonymous, and believed Young Turk \\"Ottomanism\\" posed a threat to Ottoman Christians. The British ambassador Gerard Lowther said it was like \\"pounding non-Turkish elements in a Turkish mortar\\", while another contemporary European source complained that the CUP plan would reduce \\"the various races and regions of the empire to one dead level of Turkish uniformity.\\" Rifa'at 'Ali Abou-El-Haj has written that \\"some Ottoman cultural elements and Islamic elements were abandoned in favor of Turkism, a more potent device based on ethnic identity and dependent on a language based nationalism\\". The Young Turk government launched a series of initiatives that included forced assimilation. Uƒüur √úng√∂r writes that \\"Muslim Kurds and Sephardi Jews were considered slightly more 'Turkifiable' than others\\", noting that many of these nationalist era \\"social engineering\\" policies perpetuated persecution \\"with little regard for proclaimed and real loyalties.\\" These policies culminated in Armenian and Assyrian genocides. During World War I, the Ottoman government established orphanages throughout the empire which included Armenian, Kurdish and Turkish children. Armenian orphans were given Arabic and Turkish names. In 1916 a Turkification campaign began in which whole Kurdish tribes were to be resettled in areas where they were not to exceed more than 10% of the local population. Talaat Pasha ordered that Kurds in the eastern areas be relocated in western areas. He also demanded information regarding if the Kurds turkefy in their new settlements and if they get along with their Turkish population. Also non-Kurdish immigrants from Greece, Albania, Bosnia and Bulgaria were to be settled in the Diyarbakƒ±r province, where the deported Kurds have lived before. By October 1918, with the Ottoman army retreating from Lebanon, a Father Sarlout sent the Turkish and Kurdish orphans to Damascus, while keeping the Armenian orphans in Antoura. He began the process of reversing the Turkification process by having the Armenian orphans recall their original names. It is believed by various scholars, that at least two million Turks have at least one Armenian grandparent. Around 1.5 million Ottoman Greeks remained in the Ottoman Empire after losses of 550,000 during WWI. Almost all, 1,250,000, except for those in Constantinople, had fled before or were forced to go to Greece in 1923 in the population exchanges mandated by the League of Nations after the Greco-Turkish War (1919‚Äì1922).Peoples on the Move, Pertti Ahonen, page 8, 2008 The lingual Turkification of Greek-speakers in 19th-century Anatolia is well documented. According to Speros Vryonis the Karamanlides are the result of partial Turkification that occurred earlier, during the Ottoman period. Fewer than 300,000 Armenians remained of 1.8 million before the war; fewer than 100,000 of 400,000 Assyrians.  Modern Turkey  When the modern Republic of Turkey was founded in 1923, nationalism and secularism were two of the founding principles. Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk, the leader of the early years of the Republic, aimed to create a nation state () from the Turkish remnants of the Ottoman Empire. The Turkish Ministry of National Education in 2008 defines the \\"Turkish People\\" as \\"those who protect and promote the moral, spiritual, cultural and humanistic values of the Turkish Nation.\\" One of the goals of the establishment of the new Turkish state was to ensure \\"the domination of Turkish ethnic identity in every aspect of social life from the language that people speak in the streets to the language to be taught at schools, from the education to the industrial life, from the trade to the cadres of state officials, from the civil law to the settlement of citizens to particular regions.\\"Ayhan Aktar, \\"Cumhuriyet‚Äôin ƒêlk Yƒ±llarƒ±nda Uygulanan ‚ÄòT√ºrklestirme‚Äô Politikalarƒ±,\\" in Varlƒ±k Vergisi ve 'T√ºrklestirme' Politikalarƒ±,2nd ed. (Istanbul: Iletisim, 2000), 101. The process of unification through Turkification continued within modern Turkey with such policies as: * According to Art. 12 of the Turkish Constitution of 1924, citizens who could not speak and read Turkish were not allowed to become members of parliament. *A law from December 1925 demanded that clothes worn by employees in all companies must be of Turkish production. *On the 18 March 1926 a Civil Servants Law came into effect, which allowed only Turks to become civil servants and explicitly excluded Armenians and Greeks to become such. *On the 28 Mai 1927 it was decided that the business correspondence must be in Turkish language and foreign assurance companies must employ Turks except for the director and the deputy director. *The Law 1164 from September 1927, enabled the creation of regional administrative areas called Inspectorates-General (), where extensive policies of Turkififaction were applied. The Inspectorates Generals existed until 1952. *Citizen, speak Turkish! (Turkish: Vatanda≈ü T√ºrk√ße konu≈ü!) ‚Äì An initiative created by law students but sponsored by the Turkish government which aimed to put pressure on non-Turkish speakers to speak Turkish in public in the 1930s. In some municipalities, fines were given to those speaking in any language other than Turkish. * The Law 2007 of 11 June 1932 reserved a wide number of professions like lawyer, construction worker, artisan, hairdresser, messenger etc. to Turkish citizens and forbade foreigners also to open shops in rural areas. Most affected by the Law were the Greek.Vryonis, Speros (2005). The Mechanism of Catastrophe: The Turkish Pogrom of September 6‚Äì7, 1955, and the Destruction of the Greek Community of Istanbul. New York: Greekworks.com, Inc. . *1934 Resettlement Law (also known as the Law no. 2510) ‚Äì A policy adopted by the Turkish government which set forth the basic principles of immigration. The law was issued to impose a policy of forceful assimilation of non-Turkish minorities through a forced and collective resettlement. * Surname Law ‚Äì The surname law forbade certain surnames that contained connotations of foreign cultures, nations, tribes, and religions. As a result, many ethnic Armenians, Greeks, and Kurds were forced to adopt last names of Turkish rendition. Names ending with \\"yan, of, ef , vi√ß, is, dis , poulos, aki, zade, shvili, madumu, veled, bin\\" (names that denote Armenian, Russian, Greek, Albanian, Arabic, Georgian, Kurdish, and other origins) could not be registered, they had to be replaced by \\"-oƒülu.\\" *From 1932 on, it was implemented by the Diyanet that the Adhan and the Salah shall be called in Turkish. Imams who delivered the Adhan in Arabic were prosecuted according to the article 526 of the Turkish Criminal Code for \\"being opposed to the command of officials maintaining public order and safety\\". 1941 a new paragraph was added to Article 526 of the Turkish Criminal Code and from then on Imams who refused to deliver the Adhan in Turkish could be imprisoned for up to 3 months or be fined with between 10 and 300 Turkish Lira. After the Democrat Party won the elections in 1950, on 17 June 1950 it was decided that the prayers could be given in Arabic again. *The conscription of the 20 Classes working battalions in the years 1941-1942. Only non-Muslims, mainly Jews, Greeks and Armenians were conscripted to work under difficult conditions.Rifat Bali, Model Citizens of the State: The Jews of Turkey during the Multi-Party Period, Lexington Books, 2012, , p. 12. *Varlƒ±k Vergisi (\\"Wealth tax\\" or \\"Capital tax\\") ‚Äì A Turkish tax levied on the wealthy citizens of Turkey in 1942, with the stated aim of raising funds for the country's defense in case of an eventual entry into World War II. Those who suffered most severely were non-Muslims like the Jews, Greeks, Armenians, and Levantines, who controlled a large portion of the economy; the Armenians who were most heavily taxed. According to Klaus Kreiser for President In√∂n√º the aim of the tax was to evict the foreigners who control the Turkish economy and move the economy to the Turks *Article 16 of the Population Law from 1972 prohibited to give newborns names that were contrary to the national culture. * Animal name changes in Turkey ‚Äì An initiative by the Turkish government to remove any reference to Armenia and Kurdistan in the Latin names of animals. \\"A species of red fox known as Vulpes Vulpes Kurdistanica will henceforth be plain Vulpes Vulpes, while a species of wild sheep called Ovis Armeniana has been renamed Ovis Orientalis Anatolicus.

The policy is considered a nationalization and Turkification of the country's economy by eliminating ownership of non-Turkish minorities which in this case would be of the Armenian community. * Geographical name changes in Turkey ‚Äì An initiative by the Turkish government to replace non-Turkish geographical and topographic names within the Turkish Republic or the Ottoman Empire, with Turkish names, as part of a policy of Turkification. The main proponent of the initiative has been a Turkish homogenization social-engineering campaign which aimed to assimilate or obliterate geographical or topographical names that were deemed foreign and divisive against Turkish unity. The names that were considered foreign were usually of Armenian, Greek, Laz, Slavic, Kurdish, Assyrian, or Arabic origin. For example, words such as Armenia were banned in 1880 from use in the press, schoolbooks, and governmental establishments and was subsequently replaced with words like Anatolia or Kurdistan. Modern History of Armenia in the Works of Foreign Authors [Novaya istoriya Armenii v trudax sovremennix zarubezhnix avtorov], edited by R. Sahakyan, Yerevan, 1993, p. 15 Assyrians have increased their protest regarding the forced Turkification of historically Aramaic-named cities and localities and they see this process as continuing the cultural genocide of their identity and history (as part of the wider erasure of Assyrian, Kurdish and Armenian cultures).√áaƒüatay, Soner 2002 'Kemalist d√∂nemde g√∂√ß ve iskan politikalarƒ±: T√ºrk kimliƒüi √ºzerine bir √ßalƒ±≈üma' (Policies of migration and settlement in the Kemalist era: a study on Turkish identity), Toplum ve Bilim, no. 93, pp. 218-41. * Article 301 (Turkish Penal Code) ‚Äì An article of the Turkish Penal Code which makes it illegal to insult Turkey, the Turkish nation, or Turkish government institutions. It took effect on 1 June 2005, and was introduced as part of a package of penal-law reform in the process preceding the opening of negotiations for Turkish membership of the European Union (EU), in order to bring Turkey up to the Union standards.\\"Turkey's new penal code touches raw nerves ,\\" EurActiv June 2, 2005, updated November 14, 2005. * Turkification was also prevalent in the educational system of Turkey. Measures were adopted making Turkish classes mandatory in minority schools and making use of the Turkish language mandatory in economic institutions.  Imprecise meaning of T√ºrk  During the 19th century, the word T√ºrk was a derogatory term used to refer to Anatolian villagers. The Ottoman elite identified themselves as Ottomans, not as Turks.(Kushner 1997: 219; Meeker 1971: 322) In the late 19th century, as European ideas of nationalism were adopted by the Ottoman elite, and as it became clear that the Turkish-speakers of Anatolia were the most loyal supporters of Ottoman rule, the term T√ºrk took on a much more positive connotation.(Kushner 1997: 220-221)Berfin Emre √áetin, The Paramilitary Hero on Turkish Television: A Case Study on Valley of the Wolves; Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2015, , p. 31. During Ottoman times, the millet system defined communities on a religious basis, and a residue remains today in that Turkish villagers will commonly consider as Turks only those who profess the Sunni faith, and they consider Turkish-speaking Jews, Christians, or even Alevis to be non-Turks.(Meeker 1971: 322)Ceren Lord, Religious Politics in Turkey: From the Birth of the Republic to the AKP; Cambridge University Press, 2018, , p. 135. The imprecision of the appellation T√ºrk can also be seen with other ethnic names, such as K√ºrt, which is often applied by western Anatolians to anyone east of Adana, even those who speak only Turkish. On the other hand, Kurdish-speaking or Arabic-speaking Sunnis of eastern Anatolia are often considered to be Turks.(Meeker 1971: 323) Thus, the category T√ºrk, like other ethnic categories popularly used in Turkey, does not have a uniform usage. In recent years, centrist Turkish politicians have attempted to redefine this category in a more multicultural way, emphasizing that a T√ºrk is anyone who is a citizen of the Republic of Turkey.(Kushner 1997: 230) Now, article 66 of the Turkish Constitution defines a \\"Turk\\" as anyone who is \\"bound to the Turkish state through the bond of citizenship\\".  Genetic testing of language replacement hypothesis in Anatolia, Caucasus and Balkans  The region of Anatolia represents an extremely important area with respect to ancient population migration and expansion, and the spread of the Caucasian, Indo- European and Turkic languages. During the late Roman Period, prior to the Turkic conquest, the population of Anatolia had reached an estimated level of approximately 4 million people. Several studies examined the extent to which gene flow from Central Asia has contributed to the current gene pool of the Turkish people, and the role of the 11th century invasion by Turkic peoples. A 2002 study concluded that Turks do not significantly differ from other Mediterranean populations, indicating that while the Asian Turks carried out an invasion with cultural significance (language and religion), the genetic significance is lesser detectable. A genetic research from 2001 has suggested the local Anatolian origins of the Turkic Asian peoples might have been slight. In 2003, DNA results suggested there was no strong genetic relationship between the Mongols and the Turkish people despite the historical relationship of their languages. In 2014, however, the largest autosomal study on Turkish genetics (on 16 individuals) concluded the weight of East Asian (presumably Central Asian) migration legacy of the Turkish people is estimated at 21.7%. The authors conclude on the basis of previous studies that \\"South Asian contribution to Turkey's population was significantly higher than East/Central Asian contributions, suggesting that the genetic variation of medieval Central Asian populations may be more closely related to South Asian populations, or that there was continued low level migration from South Asia into Anatolia.\\" They note that these weights are not direct estimates of the migration rates as the original donor populations are not known, and the exact kinship between current East Asians and the medieval Oghuz Turks is uncertain. For instance, genetic pools of Central Asian Turkic peoples is particularly diverse and modern Oghuz Turkmens living in Central Asia are with higher West Eurasian genetic component than East Eurasian on average . These findings are consistent with a model in which the Turkic languages, originating in the Altai-Sayan region of Central Asia and northwestern Mongolia, were imposed on the indigenous peoples with genetic admixture, shows both ethnic mixing and linguistic replacement.The Turkish and Azeri populations are atypical among Altaic speakers (Table (Table1)1) in having low frequencies of M130, M48, M45, and M17 haplotypes. Rather, these two Turkic-speaking groups seem to be closer to populations from the Middle East and Caucasus, characterized by high frequencies of M96- and/or M89-related haplotypes. This finding is consistent with a model in which the Turkic languages, originating in the Altai-Sayan region of Central Asia and northwestern Mongolia (31), were imposed on the Caucasian and Anatolian peoples with relatively little genetic admixture‚Äîanother possible example of elite dominance-driven linguistic replacement. For more see: Genetically, Anatolian Turks were more closely related also with Balkan populations than to the Central Asian populations in early history. After eleven decades of Turkic migration to Anatolia including Oghuz and Kipchak Turkic people from Central Asia, Persia, Caucassia and Crimea, today's population is genetically in between Central Asia and indigenous historic Anatolia. Similar results come from neighbouring Caucasus region by testing Armenian and Turkic speaking Azerbaijani populations, therefore representing language replacements and intermarriages. As of 2004, the haplogroups in Turkey are shared with European and neighboring Near Eastern populations and haplogroups related to Central Asian, South Asian and African affinity, which supports both the mass migration, and language replacement hypothesis on the region and ethnic mixing. A 2011 haplogroup study concluded \\"that the profile of Anatolian populations today is the product not of mass westward migrations of Central Asians and Siberians, or of small-scale migrations into an emptied subcontinent, but instead of small- scale, irregular punctuated migration events that engendered large-scale shifts in language and culture among the diverse\\" indigenous inhabitants (p. 32). Results of a 2012 genetic study by Hodoƒülugil and Mahley showed the admixture of Turkish people, which is primarily European (French, Italian, Sardinian) and Middle Eastern (Druze, Palestinian), with a Central Asian (Uyghur, Kyrgyz, Hazara) component of only 9%-15% of their genepool.

Launched in 1927, she was named for the 18th-century French admiral Pierre Andr√© de Suffren de Saint Tropez, becoming the sixth vessel to bear the name Suffren. Design and description The design of the Suffren class was derived from the preceding with more armor exchanged for less speed. The ships had an overall length of , a beam of , and a draft of . They displaced at standard load and at deep load. Their crew normally consisted of 647 men and increased by 84 when serving as flagships.Jordan & Moulin, pp. 50, 71‚Äì72 Service history=Onset of war At the outbreak of the Second World War, Suffren was part of the Force X, under Vice Admiral Godfroy. In early June 1940, at the outset of World War II, the cruisers Suffren, , and , along with three destroyers, operated against the Italian-occupied Dodecanese Islands. Later in that same month, Suffren participated in a joint operation with the Royal Navy - the last such operation before the French surrender to Nazi Germany on 22 June 1940. Surrender At the time of the French surrender, Suffren was stationed in Alexandria, Egypt, with other French warships. In contrast to the violent confrontation that took place at the same time at Mers-el-K√©bir, Algeria, Suffren surrendered peacefully after the British admiral Andrew Browne Cunningham and the French admiral Ren√©-√âmile Godfroy reached an agreement. The ship was disarmed and interned by the British on 3 July 1940. Allied career Suffren rejoined the Allied cause and was rearmed on 30 May 1943. On 17 July 1943, Suffren rescued survivors of the vessel City of Canton, which was torpedoed off Beira, Mozambique. Postwar service Suffren reentered service with the French Navy after World War II. She was wrongly alleged to have participated in the shelling of the Vietnamese port of Haiphong on 23 November 1946, an event that caused over six thousand casualties and contributed to the start of the First Indochina War; three avisos were the actual perpetrators. On 1 October 1947, after almost twenty years of service, Suffren was decommissioned, and was used as a hulk in Toulon. She was renamed Oc√©an in 1963, and was ultimately broken up in 1974.

Principal and students of Catholic St Louis High School, Surabaya at the chapel The Catholic Church in Indonesia () is part of the worldwide Catholic Church, under the spiritual leadership of the pope in Rome. Catholicism is one of the six approved religions in Indonesia, the others being Islam, Protestantism, Hinduism, Buddhism, and Confucianism. According to official figures, Catholics made up 2.9% percent of the population in 2010. The number of the Catholics is therefore nearly 7.5 million. Indonesia is primarily Muslim, but Catholicism is the dominant faith in certain areas of the country. The Church is organised into 10 archdioceses and 27 dioceses, all of which are members of the Indonesian Catholic Bishops Conference (KWI) led by Archbishop Ignatius Cardinal Suharyo Hardjoatmodjo. There are several Catholic religious institutes active in the country including the Jesuits, the Missionaries of the Sacred Heart (MSC) and the Divine Word Missionaries. Catholicism in Indonesia began with the arrival of the Portuguese in search of the Spice Islands in the 16th century. Currently, East Nusa Tenggara is the only province in Indonesia where Catholicism is the majority, around 55% of its population.Statistics Indonesia [Central Statistics Bureau] (2012), Statistik Indonesia, Statistical yearbook of Indonesia 2011, Jakarta. There is also a significant Catholic population in North Sumatra, West Kalimantan, South Sulawesi, Maluku, and Central Java, especially in and around Muntilan. History=Brief History In the 14th century, the first Catholic mission that reached Indonesia was led by Italian Franciscan friar Mattiussi. In his book \\"Travels of Friar Odoric of Pordenone\\", he visited several places in today's Indonesia: Sumatra, Java, and Banjarmasin in Borneo, between 1318‚Äì1330. He was sent by the Pope to launch a mission into the Asian interiors. In 1318 he departed from Padua, crossed the Black Sea into Persia and then to Calcutta, Madras, and Sri Lanka. Thence he headed to Nicobar island and Sumatra, before visiting Java and Banjarmasin. He returned to Italy by land through Vietnam, China, and the silkroad to Europe in 1330. The Javanese kingdom mentioned in his record was the Hindu-Buddhist Majapahit kingdom. This mission was a pioneer one, providing the church with some information about Asia. At that time the Catholic church was not yet established in the region, with Hinduism and Buddhism being the religions of the majority of the population. In the 16th century, the Portuguese sailed east to Asia and eventually captured Malacca in 1511. They came for the spice but Catholic missionaries soon arrived in the region, most notably Francis Xavier who worked in Ambon, Ternate and Morotai (Halmahera) in 1546‚Äì1547. Dominican missionaries also converted many in Solor. With the expulsion of Portugal from Ternate in 1574, many Catholics in the northern Moluccas were killed or converted to Islam. Ambon was conquered and occupied by the Dutch East India Company in 1605. Subsequently, the Catholics were forced to convert to Protestantism. The same happened in Manado and the islands of Sangihe- Talaud. In 1613 Solor also fell to the Dutch, and Catholic mission activities declined in Flores and Timor, even though these were still under Portuguese administration.Robert Cribb, Historical Atlas of Indonesia (2000:48) It was not until 1808 under H.W. Daendels, as Governor-General, that Catholics were permitted freedom of worship in the Dutch Indies, though this measure was mainly intended for European Catholics since Daendels ruled under the authority of Napoleonic France. This freedom was consolidated by Thomas Raffles. From 1835 the Catholic Church was affiliated with the colonial state: clergy received a salary from the colonial government which in turn had the right to reject church appointments. In 1846, clashes over policy led the Dutch authorities to expel all but one of the Catholic priests in the colony. In 1848 there were Catholic churches in only four centres in the colony. Active mission work resumed in the second half of the 19th century and was concentrated in a few areas. Larantuka in the island of Flores was a particularly important mission field under the Jesuits because the freedom of the Catholic Church was guaranteed there under an 1859 treaty with Portugal, which settled conflicting territorial claims in the region. Bengkulu, Bangka, West Borneo, and the islands south of New Guinea were also important. In other regions, Catholic mission work was banned. Many Batak people in the interior of North Sumatra adopted Catholicism at this time, even though authorities banned Catholic missionaries in other parts of the province. In 1898, a mission program also began in Muntilan, though the first ethnic Javanese priest was not installed until 1926. After Indonesian independence, the Church grew steadily although the Dutch and other Europeans were expelled. Catholicism and other religions grew phenomenally after the Overthrow of Sukarno in 1965. The Portuguese Era Portuguese explorers arrived in the Maluku Islands in 1534, with the goal of converting the natives to Catholicism and to obtain valuable spices endemic to the region. The Spaniard Francis Xavier, a co-founder of the Jesuit Order, worked in the islands from 1546 to 1547 and baptised several thousand locals of the islands of Ambon, Ternate and Morotai (or Moro), laying the foundations for a permanent mission there. Following his departure from Maluku, others carried on his work and by the 1560s there were 10,000 Catholics in the area, mostly on Ambon; by the 1590s there were 50,000 to 60,000. Portuguese Dominican priests also had some success in missionary activities on Solor whereby the 1590s the Portuguese and local Catholic population is thought to have numbered 25,000. The VOC Era Cornelis de Houtman was the first Dutchman who sailed east to modern- day Indonesia, in 1595. Although his expedition could be considered a commercial failure, it showed the Dutch they were able to sail east in search of the spices. In 1602 the Dutch East India Company (VOC) was created. The Netherlands, like Britain, had a staunchly Protestant government at the time, which extended to the VOC; even though there were many Dutch Catholics, they had little influence. Ambon was conquered and occupied by the VOC in 1605, and the Catholics were forced to convert to Protestantism. The same happened in Manado and the islands of Sangihe-Talaud. In 1613 Solor also fell to the Dutch, and Catholic mission activity was reduced in Flores and Timor, which were still under Portuguese administration. The Catholic priests were replaced with Protestant clergy from the Netherlands. Many Christians at the time converted to Protestantism. For some time, Catholic priests were threatened with capital punishment if found to be residing in VOC territory. In 1624, Father Egidius d'Abreu SJ was executed in Batavia during the administration of Governor-General Jan Pieterszoon Coen, for celebrating Mass in prison. Father Alexander de Rhodes, a French Jesuit who invented the Vietnamese westernized alphabet system, was forced to watch his cross and Mass accessories burned underneath where two convicted thieves were just hung to their deaths. De Rhodes was then expelled from VOC territories in 1646. John Gaspard Cratz, an Austrian, was forced to leave Batavia due to difficulties with the administrators when he helped Catholic priests who were in transit in Batavia. He was moved to Macau, joined the Jesuit Order, and died as a martyr in Vietnam in 1737. At the end of the 18th century Western Europe saw intense warfare between France and Great Britain and their respective allies. The sympathies of the people of the Netherlands were divided, and the Netherlands lost its independence. In 1799 the VOC went bankrupt and was dissolved. In 1806 Napoleon assigned his brother Louis Bonaparte, a Catholic, to the throne of the Netherlands. The East Indies Era The change of politics in the Netherlands, mainly because of the accession of Louis Bonaparte, a fervent Catholic, brought a positive effect. Religious freedom was recognised by the government. On 8 May 1807, the pope in Rome was given permission from King Louis to establish an Apostolic Prefecture of East Indies in Batavia. On 4 April 1808, two Dutch priests arrived in Batavia. They were Fr. Jacobus Nelissen and Fr. Lambertus Prinsen. Nelissen became the first Apostolic Prefect when the Apostolic Prefecture of Batavia was created in 1826. Governor-General Daendels (1808‚Äì1811) replaced VOC with the government of Dutch East Indies. Religious freedom was then practised, although Catholicism was still difficult. The Van Lith Era Catholicism started to spread in Central Java when Fr. Frans van Lith from the Netherlands came to Muntilan, Central Java, in 1896. His effort showed little progress until 1904 when four chiefs (the heads of the town) from Kalibawang region came to his house and demanded that he catechize them. On 15 December 1904, a group of 178 Javanese were baptised at Semagung, between two trees called \\"Sono\\". This place is now called Sendangsono in Muntilan, district Magelang, Central Java, near the border of the province of DI Yogyakarta. Van Lith also established a school for teachers in Muntilan called \\"Normaalschool\\" in 1900 and \\"Kweekschool (also for teachers)\\" in 1904. In 1918, all Catholic schools were put under the jurisdiction of an institute named \\"Yayasan Kanisius\\", which produced the first priests and bishops of Indonesia. In the 20th century, the Catholic Church grew quickly. In 1911, Van Lith established the \\"Seminari Menengah\\" (minor seminary). Three out of the six candidates that were at the school during 1911-1914 were received into the priesthood in 1926-1928. Those priests were FX Satiman SJ, Adrianus Djajasepoetra SJ, and Albertus Soegijapranata SJ. World War II and the War of Independence Albertus Soegijapranata, a national hero of Indonesia, an ex-Muslim, was the first native Indonesian bishop and known for his pro-nationalistic stance, often expressed as \\"100% Catholic, 100% Indonesian\\". Albertus Soegijapranata SJ became the first Indonesian bishop in 1940 and later Archbishop of Semarang. On 20 December 1948, Father Sandjaja and Brother Hermanus Bouwens SJ were killed in a village called Kembaran, near Muntilan, when Dutch soldiers attacked Semarang. Father Sandjaja is recognised as a martyr by the Indonesian Catholics, (not officially canonized or approved by the Holy See). Monsignor Soegijapranata with Bishop Willekens SJ faced Japanese colonial rule. They managed, however, to keep Saint Carolus Hospital operating normally. Some of the most notable Indonesian national heroes are Catholics, including Agustinus Adisoetjipto (1947) after whom is named Yogyakarta International Airport, Adisutjipto Airport, Ignatius Slamet Riyadi (1945), and Yos Soedarso (1961). The Post- Independence Era Purnomo Yusgiantoro, former Indonesian Minister of Defence and a prominent Catholic. The first Indonesian archbishop to be made cardinal was Justinus Darmojuwono on 29 June 1967. Indonesian Bishops took part in the second Vatican Council, which was convened from 1962 to 1965. Pope Paul VI visited Indonesia in 1970, followed in 1989 by Pope John Paul II. The places visited were Jakarta (capital of Indonesia), Medan (North Sumatra), Yogyakarta (DI Yogyakarta), cities of Central Java province, Maumere (Flores), and Dili (Timor Timur) (now the country of East Timor). The head Archdiocese of Jakarta (\\"Keuskupan Agung Jakarta\\"), is Archbishop Ignatius Suharyo Hardjoatmodjo. Indonesia's only cardinal is Julius Darmaatmadja SJ. He took part in the conclave which elected Pope Benedict XVI. For health reasons, however, he declined to take part in the recent conclave that elected Pope Francis. In 1965, after the overthrow of Sukarno, a purge was carried out against Indonesian communists and alleged communists, especially in Java and Bali. Hundreds of thousands, perhaps millions, of civilians were killed in the ensuing turmoil by the army and vigilantes.In Central Java, the mass killings were carried out by the army much while in East Java the mass killings were also carried out by others. Robert Cribb (2000:170). Communism was associated with atheism and since that time every Indonesian citizen has been expected to adopt one of the then five official state-endorsed religions.Adolf Heuken (2005:107) Catholicism and other minority religions have experienced enormous growth especially in areas inhabited by large numbers of Chinese Indonesians and ethnic Javanese. For example, in 2000 in Jakarta alone there were 301,084 Catholics, while in 1960 there were only 26,955. This means the Catholic population increased elevenfold while in the same period the population of Jakarta merely tripled, from 2,800,000 to 8,347,000. This growth may also be attributed to increased migration to the capital from Christian parts of Indonesia when in 1960 there were not so many from the regions residing in Jakarta as now. The dramatic increase of the number of Catholics in particular, and Christians in general, has led to enmity and unfounded allegations of \\"Christianization\\".For instance, when Pope John Paul II visited Yogyakarta, Indonesia in 1989, he received a letter full of such accusations. The letter was written by Moh. Natsir, K.H. Masykur, K.H. Rusli Abd Wahid, and H.M. Rasyidi. These gentlemen were prominent Muslim leaders at that time. Panji Masyarakat 31-10-1989. This information is cited from Adolf Heuken (2005:107) The second half of the 1990s and beginning of the 2000s were also marked by violence against Catholics in particular and Christians in general. However, former president Abdurrahman Wahid, himself a leader of Nahdatul Ulama, one of the biggest Muslim organisations in Indonesia, made several contributions in reconciling the simmering antipathy among the different religious groups. As recently as 2010, there were incidents where Catholics and other Christians were banned from celebrating Christmas services.Christians refuse to cancel Christmas Demographics Rawaseneng Monastery (Pertapaan Santa Maria Rawaseneng), in Temanggung Regency, Central Java Ignatius Suharyo Hardjoatmodjo, the Archbishop of Jakarta The Indonesian Central Statistic Bureau (BPS) conducts a census every 10 years. Data available from 2000 drew on 201,241,999 survey responses. BPS estimated that the census missed 4.6 million people. The BPS report indicated that 85.1 per cent of the population label themselves Muslim, 9.2 per cent Protestant, 3.5 per cent Catholic, 1.81 per cent Hindu, 0.84 per cent Buddhist, and 0.2 per cent \\"other,\\" including traditional indigenous religions, other Christian groups, and Judaism. The country's religious composition remains a politically charged issue; as some Christians, Hindus, and members of other minority faiths argue that the census undercounted non-Muslims.
