They are adapted for life in sandy deserts with fringe-like scales on their hind toes hence their common name. Descriptions Lizards of the genus Uma have a brown and tan coloration that helps them to blend in with the sand. The dorsal surface has a velvety texture with intricate markings. In addition, they also have prominent elongated scales which form a fringe on the sides of their hind toes. These fringes aid with traction and speed, and help the lizard avoid sinking into loose, sandy dunes. Fringe-toed lizards also possess upper jaws which overlap the lower ones, preventing the intrusion of sand particles, and nostrils that can be closed at will. Flaps also close against the ear openings when moving through sand, and the upper and lower eyelids have interlocking scales that prevent sand from getting into the eyes. Geographic range Fringe-toed lizards range throughout southeast California and southwest Arizona, and extend into northwest Sonora and northeast Baja California. Habitat Lizards of the genus Uma are found in low desert areas having fine, loose sand. Diet Fringe-toed lizards primarily eat insects, including ants, beetles, grasshoppers, and caterpillars. Flower buds, stems, leaves and seeds of plants are also eaten. Behavior Lizards of the genus Uma bury themselves underground in the winter. They sleep in their burrows, and use their burrows for protection from predators and extreme temperatures.

They commonly grow to 6 in including the tail, with the males normally being the larger sex. Males often have bright throat colors. These lizards are prey for many desert species. Snakes, larger lizards, and birds all make formidable predators to side-blotched lizards. Larger lizard species, such as collared, leopard, and spiny lizards, and roadrunners are the main predators. In turn, the side-blotched lizards eat arthropods, such as insects, spiders, and occasionally scorpions. As a result of their high predation rate, these lizards are very prolific breeders. From April to June, they breed, with the young emerging as early as late May. These inch-long young appear all through the summer, and into September. The diploid chromosome number in most if not all species is 34, consisting of 12 macro- and 22 microchromosomes.Pennock et al. (1968) Sex Side-blotched lizards are notable for having the highest number of distinct male and female morphs within a species: three male and two female.

Yellow stripe-throated males (\\"sneakers\\") do not defend a territory, but cluster on the fringes of orange-throated lizard territories, and mate with the females on those territories while the orange-throat is absent, as the territory to defend is large. Blue-throated males are less aggressive and guard only one female; they can fend off the yellow stripe-throated males, but cannot withstand attacks by orange-throated males. Orange-throated females lay many small eggs and are very territorial. Yellow-throated females lay fewer, larger eggs, and are more tolerant of each other.Roughgarden, Joan (2004).

The orange and blue-throated males can sometimes be seen approaching a human \\"intruder\\". One speculation is that he could be giving the female(s) a chance to escape, but whether he is defending the female has not been documented. Another speculation is that he is highly motivated to engage whenever he sees movement on his territory, which he may be interpreting as a possible intruding male, or another female.

With more than 425 species, it represents the world's most species-rich amniote tetrapod genus, although it has been proposed that many of these should be moved to other genera, in which case only about 45 Anolis species remain. Abstract Previously, it was classified under the family Polychrotidae that contained all the anoles as well as Polychrus, but recent studies place it under Dactyloidae.  Taxonomy  This very large genus displays considerable paraphyly, but phylogenetic analysis suggests a number of subgroups or clades. Whether these clades are best recognized as subgenera within Anolis or separate genera remains a matter of dispute. If the clades are recognized as full genera, about 45 species remain in Anolis, with the remaining moved to Audantia (9 species), Chamaelinorops (7 species), Ctenonotus (more than 40 species), Dactyloa ( 95 species), Deiroptyx (almost 35 species), Norops ( 190 species) and Xiphosurus ( 15 species). Some of these can be further subdivided. For example, Phenacosaurus was often listed as a full genus in the past, but it is a subclade within Dactyloa (Dactyloa heteroderma species group). Among the subgroups within Anolis are: * carolinensis species group (13 species) * isolepis species group (3 species) In 2011 the green (or Carolina) anole (Anolis carolinensis) became the first reptile to have its complete genome published. Closely related, recently diverged anole lizards exhibited more divergence in thermal biology than in morphology. These anole lizards are thought to have the same structural niche and have similarities in their size and shape. However they inhabited different climatic niches in which there was variability in temperature and openness of the environment. This suggests that thermal physiology is more associated with recently diverged anole lizards.Losos, J. B. (2009). Lizards in an evolutionary tree: ecology and adaptive radiation of anoles. University of California Press, Berkeley, CA. Ecomorphs Anolis lizards are some of the best examples of both adaptive radiation and convergent evolution. Populations of lizards on isolated islands diverge to occupy separate ecological niches, mostly in terms of the location within the vegetation where they forage (such as in the crown of trees vs. the trunk vs. underlying shrubs). These divergences in habitat are accompanied by morphological changes primarily related to moving on the substrate diameter they most frequently encounter, with twig ecomorphs having short limbs, while trunk ecomorphs have long limbs. In addition, these patterns repeat on numerous islands, with animals in similar habitats converging on similar body forms repeatedly. This demonstrates adaptive radiation can actually be predictable based on habitat encountered, and experimental introductions onto formerly lizard-free islands have proven Anolis evolution can be predicted. After appearing on each of the four Greater Antillean Islands about 50 million years ago, Anolis lizards spread on each island to occupy niches in the island's trees. Some living in the tree canopy area, others low on the tree trunk near the ground; others in the mid-trunk area, others on twigs. Each new species developed its own distinct body type, called an ecomorph, adapted to the tree niche where it lived. Together the different species occupied their various niches in the trees as a \\"community\\". A study of lizard fossils trapped in amber shows that the lizard communities have existed for about 20 million years or more. Four modern ecomorph body types, trunk-crown, trunk-ground, trunk and twig are represented in the amber fossils study. Close comparison of the lizard fossils with their descendants alive today in the Caribbean shows the lizards have changed little in the millions of years. Species The anolis lizards that are less susceptible to predation are those with a dewlap that has both the scales and the skin in between match the expected pale gray or white like color of its ventral surface.

They are native to Mexico, South and Central America, and the West Indies. Depending on the exact species, adults have a snout-to-vent of between about , ranging from the small five- striped grass anole to the Jamaican giant anole. Taxonomy The first recognition of this group happened in 1959‚Äì1960 when it was proposed that Anolis could be split into two groups, the so-called \\"alpha anoles\\" and \\"beta anoles\\". The former comprised most anole subgroups, while the latter essentially equalled Norops. The \\"beta anoles\\" form a monophyletic group, but the \\"alpha anoles\\" do not. In 1986, the \\"beta anoles\\" were recognized as a genus, Norops, while the \\"alpha anoles\\" were split into multiple genera (some of which had already been proposed earlier) based primarily on skeletal characters. This was adopted by some (including many scientists working with reptiles in Central America) and rejected by others (including many scientists in the West Indies), who continued placing all in Anolis. Later studies confirmed that Norops was monophyletic, but a few of the other genera proposed in 1986 were not. A resolution to this was proposed in 2012 when Anolis was split into eight genera, including Norops. This move was criticized, especially because some considered the change unnecessary when it was possible to maintain a status quo by keeping all anoles in the genus Anolis. Later studies have confirmed that the genera proposed in 2012 essentially are monophyletic, but prefer to only treat them as clades within Anolis. There are three primary subclades within Norops: The N. auratus group (\\"Draconura\\") alone contains about 150 species, including the vast majority of anoles from Mexico and Central America, but also some from South America (as far south as Paraguay) and nearby small islands. The two remaining groups have far fewer species and are native to the West Indies. The N. sagrei group (\\"Trachypilus\\") contains almost 20 species from Cuba and nearby small islands, as well as the Bahamas, Cayman Islands and Swan Island. The N. valencienni group (\\"Placopsis\\") contains less than 10 species from Jamaica and Grand Cayman. Among these, the brown anole has been widely introduced to regions outside its native range, both in the Americas (including Florida and Texas) and other continents. The Graham's anole has been introduced to Bermuda. =Species= Norops auratus Norops conspersus Norops garmani Norops grahami Norops poecilopus Norops sagrei Norops vittigerus Norops includes the following species:Norops, The Reptile Database  Morphological characteristics  Whether Norops is classified as a clade or a genus, most taxonomists have agreed on what morphological characteristics warrant the placement of a species inside the group. Etheridge classified his beta anoles as species that shared the certain aspects of vertebral morphology; Nicholson et al. went further by defining Norops as species that shared the following specific aspects of skeletal morphology: # structure of caudal vertebrae and mechanism of autotomy # location of pineal foramen # absence of pterygoid teeth # usual absence of splenial # lower jaw morphology # number of lumbar vertebrae There is remarkable morphological variation within this clade, even relative to other clades in Anolis; however most Norops species share a set of similar characteristics that are readily observable even to the untrained eye; they are usually small to mid-size anoles, though a few species such as Anolis (Norops) garmani can grow much larger. They typically have robust bodies and stout, blunt heads; they exist in a variety of ecomorphs. References *Losos, J.B. (2009).

Common name No widely common name is used solely for species of the genus Tropidurus. In their native range, they are simply called \\"iguanas\\" as are most similar animals. If anything, the Brazilian term calango is used to particularly refer to lizards of the genus Tropidurus. Taxonomy The genus Tropidurus contains 30 described species, but new ones continue to be discovered. An additional seven species--the Gal√°pagos lava lizards endemic to the Gal√°pagos Islands--are sometimes placed here, too, but more commonly separated in the genus Microlophus, instead. Similarly, the green thornytail iguana and tropical thorny iguana are now often separated into the minor, but probably distinct Uracentron lineage, instead. In this article, these two genera are kept separate, while Platynotus, Strobilurus, and Tapinurus are included in Tropidurus. Description Males and females of all Tropidurus species are marked differently. The male is usually much larger than the female, and his body is more brightly coloured and distinctly patterned.

Some taxonomic authorities still consider it a subspecies. It is the national bird of Japan. Declared national bird by a non-government body in 1947 Taxonomy and systematics Some sources claim that the green pheasant is a subspecies of the common pheasant, though others claim that they are separate, though closely related, species. The green pheasant has three subspecies. The nominate subspecies, P. v. versicolor, is called the Southern Green Pheasant or Kiji. The Pacific Green Pheasants, P. v. tamensis, and Northern Green Pheasant, P. v. robustipes, are the other two subspecies. There are some cases of hybrids between the green pheasant and the copper pheasant or common pheasant. Description The male (cock) has dark green plumage on the breast, neck, mantle, and flanks. The male also has bluish-purplish hood with clear ear-tufts, red wattle, and long, pale grey-banded tail. The female is smaller than the male, with a shorter tail, and has brownish black colored plumage, with dark brown feather fringed pale brown. The males of this subspecies have the darkest plumage, which is mainly green. The male Pacific Green Pheasants, P. v. tamensis, have lighter plumage than the nominate subspecies. Their feathers are more purple and blue. The male Northern Green Pheasant P. v. robustipes have the lightest plumage and their crown and mantle are more bronze than those of the other subspecies. The females of all three subspecies look much more similar, though, like with the males, the females of P.v versicolor normally have the darkest plumage and the females of P. v. robustipes have the lightest. Behavior =Diet= In the wild, green pheasants eat small animals, such as worms and insects, grains and plants. They are, in captivity, sometimes fed pellets, seeds, plants and live food. =Breeding= The green pheasants' breeding season starts during March or April and ends in June. Green pheasants can first breed when they about one year old. One clutch has between six and fifteen eggs. The eggs are incubated for 23 to 25 days. Egg In culture In Japan, many people claim that green pheasants are scared by earthquakes and 'scream'. They are the national bird of Japan. Habitat and distribution It is found throughout Honshu, Shikoku, and Kyushu as well as some smaller islands; it has also been introduced in Hawaii and (unsuccessfully) in North America as a gamebird. It inhabits woodlands and forest edges, brush, grassland, and parkland. This species is common and widespread throughout its native range. It often frequents farmlands and human settlements. The introduced populations in Hawaii are stable. Populations in Western Europe have perhaps bred with the common pheasant for a number of years and no pure green pheasants exist there any longer. This species has been crossed with the common pheasant on some game farms in North America and released. Conservation Though the green pheasant has a decreasing population, its population is not severely fragmented. On a local and national level, they are used for food, sport hunting, specimen collecting and as pets or display animals. None of these practices are found on an international level. The Green pheasant is one of the 29 designated 'game species' in Japan. These are the only species that can legally be hunted. A hunting license is required.

He took this very hard. The biochemist Simon El'evich Shnoll, at the Institute for Theoretical and Experimental Biophysics in Pushchino, heard of Belousov's work and tried to encourage him to continue. Belousov gave Schnoll some of his experimental notes and agreed to publish an article in a rather obscure, non- reviewed, journal, but then essentially quit science.

It is used extensively on amateur packet radio networks. AX.25 v2.0 and later occupies the data link layer, the second layer of the OSI model. It is responsible for establishing link-layer connections, transferring data encapsulated in frames between nodes, and detecting errors introduced by the communications channel. As AX.25 is a pre-OSI-model protocol, the original specification was not written to cleanly separate into OSI layers. This was rectified with version 2.0 (1984), which assumes compliance with OSI level 2. AX.25 v2.2 (1998) added improvements to improve efficiency, especially at higher data rates. Stations can automatically negotiate payload sizes larger than the previous limitation of 256 bytes. Extended sequence numbers (7 vs. 3 bits) allow a larger window size, the number of frames that can be sent before waiting for acknowledgement. \\"Selective Reject\\" allows only the missing frames to be resent, rather than having to wastefully resend frames that have already been received successfully. Despite all these advantages, few implementations have been updated to include these improvements published more than 20 years ago. AX.25 is commonly used as the data link layer for network layer such as IPv4, with TCP used on top of that. AX.25 supports a limited form of source routing. Although it is possible to build AX.25 switches similar to the way Ethernet switches work, this has not yet been accomplished. Specification AX.25 does not define a physical layer implementation. In practice 1200 baud Bell 202 tones and 9600 baud G3RUH DFSK are almost exclusively used on VHF and UHF. On HF the standard transmission mode is 300 baud Bell 103 tones, although very little use of AX.25 on HF exists today. At the physical layer, AX.25 defines only a \\"physical layer state machine\\" and some timers related to transmitter and receiver switching delays. At the link layer, AX.25 uses HDLC frame syntax and procedures. (ISO 3309)ISO/IEC 3309: \\"Information technology. Telecommunications and information exchange between systems. High-level Data Link Control (HDLC) procedures. Frame structure\\" (1984). frames are transmitted with NRZI encoding. HDLC specifies the syntax, but not the semantics, of the variable-length address field of the frame. AX.25 specifies that this field is subdivided into multiple addresses: a source address, zero or more repeater addresses, and a destination address, with embedded control fields for use by the repeaters. To simplify compliance with amateur radio rules, these addresses derive from the station call signs of the source, destination and repeater stations. Media access control follows the Carrier sense multiple access approach with collision recovery (CSMA/CR). AX.25 supports both virtual-circuit connected and datagram-style connectionless modes of operation. The latter is used to great effect by the Automatic Packet Reporting System (APRS). A simple source routing mechanism using digipeaters is available at the datalink level. Digipeaters act as simplex repeaters, receiving, decoding and retransmitting packets from local stations. They allow multi-hop connections to be established between two stations unable to communicate directly. The digipeaters use and modify the information in the frame's address field to perform this function. The AX.25 specification defines a complete, albeit point to point only network layer protocol, but this has seen little use outside of keyboard-to-keyboard or keyboard-to-BBS connections. NET/ROM, ROSE, and TexNet exist to provide routing between nodes. In principle, a variety of layer 3 protocols can be used with AX.25, including the ubiquitous Internet protocol. This approach is used by AMPRNet, which is an amateur radio TCP/IP network using AX.25 UI-frames at the datalink layer. Implementations Traditionally, amateur radio operators have connected to AX.25 networks through the use of a terminal node controller, which contains a microprocessor and an implementation of the protocol in firmware. These devices allow network resources to be accessed using only a dumb terminal and a transceiver. AX.25 has also been implemented on personal computers. For example, the Linux kernel includes native support for AX.25. The computer connects to a transceiver via its audio interface or via a simple modem. The computers can also interconnect to other computers or be bridged or routed to TNCs and transceivers located elsewhere using BPQ over Ethernet framing, which is also natively supported by the Linux kernel to facilitate more modern setups with the actual transceivers directly placed under or in the antenna mast, creating a 'low loss', shorter RF wiring need, and replacing expensive and long and thick coax cables and amplifiers with cheap fiber (RFI (both ways)/EMP/lightning resistant) or copper Ethernet wiring. BPQ Ethernet framing allows to connect entire stacks of TNC+transceiver pairs to any existing network of computers which then can all access all radio links offered simultaneously (transparently bridged), communicate with each other internally over AX.25, or with filtered routing select specific TNCs/radio frequencies. Note that the Linux kernel AX.25 implementation does contain some bugs, mainly in disconnecting sessions (this bug appears to have slipped in over time due to maintenance by some people using it exclusively for APRS and not in virtual channel connected mode), and for example TAP interfaces not supporting the full 7 bytes of call sign string length as some interface drivers expect a 6 byte HW address (MAC), not an up-to-7 byte one like AX.25 use requires. =KISS-mode framing= :See full article at KISS (TNC) AX.25 is often used with a TNC that implements the KISS framing as a low-cost alternative to using expensive and uncommon HDLC controller cards. The KISS framing is not part of the AX.25 protocol itself nor is it sent over the air. It merely serves to encapsulate the protocol frames in a way that can successfully pass over a serial link to the TNC. The KISS framing is derived from SLIP, and makes many of the same assumptions, such as there only being two \\"endpoints\\" involved in the conversation. With SLIP, these were the two SLIP-connected hosts; with KISS, it is assumed that the KISS framing link is over serial with only the host computer and the TNC involved. Among other things, this makes it awkward to address multiple TNCs without having multiple (serial) data channels. Alternatives to KISS do exist that address these limitations, such as 6PACK. Applications AX.25 has most frequently been used to establish direct, point-to-point links between packet radio stations, without any additional network layers. This is sufficient for keyboard-to-keyboard contacts between stations and for accessing local bulletin board systems and DX clusters. In recent years, APRS has become a popular application. For tunneling of AX.25 packets over IP, AXIP and AXUDP are used to encapsulate AX.25 into IP or UDP packets. Limitations At the speeds commonly used to transmit packet radio data (rarely higher than 9,600 bit/s, and typically 1,200 bit/s), the use of additional network layers with AX.25 is impractical due to the data overhead involved. This is not a limitation of AX.25 per se, but places constraints on the sophistication of applications designed to use it. HDLC protocols identify each frame by an address. The AX.25 implementation of HDLC includes sender and destination station call-sign plus four-bit Secondary Station Identifier (SSID) value in range 0 through 15 in the frame address. At ITU WARC2003 the radio amateur station callsign specification was amended so that the earlier maximum length of six characters was raised to seven characters. However AX.25 has a built-in hard limit of six characters, which means a seven-character callsign cannot be used in an AX.25 network. AX.25 lacks an explicit port (or SAP); the SSID often assumes this role. Thus there can be only one service per AX.25 station SSID address, which is often kludged around with varying degrees of success. Some amateurs, notably Phil Karn KA9Q, have argued that AX.25 is not well-suited to operation over noisy, limited-bandwidth radio links, citing its lack of forward error correction (FEC) and automatic data compression. However, a viable widely adopted successor to AX.25 has yet to emerge. Likely reasons may include: * a large existing deployment of recycled narrowband FM radios and especially existing APRS applications, * easy availability of cheap, low-power FM transmitters, especially for the 430 MHz UHF band, to match existing legacy radio gear, * new radio level modulations would need different radio gear than what is currently in use and the resulting system would be incompatible with the existing one thus requiring a large initial investment in new radio gear, * adoption of newer line codings potentially including forward error correction takes more effort than the 1,200 bit/s AFSK of Bell 202\\\\. Previously sufficient small 8-bit microprocessors with 128 bytes of RAM would not be enough, and new ones might cost US$30 instead of US$3. Phil Karn did demo decoding of this new modulation of his by running it on a Pentium II machine some 10 years later, mid-level embedded microprocessors are capable enough to do the same with under US$50 system cost. Despite these limitations, an extension to the AX.25 protocol, supporting forward error correction, has been created by the TAPR. This extension is called FX.25. Small gadget transmitters do not need to know what is being transmitted. There is only a need to monitor channel occupation by radio receiver RSSI (Received Signal Strength Indication) to know when not to send. Transmitting interleaved Reed-Solomon FEC signal in some smart modulation needs a lot fewer resources than reception of the same signal, thus a sufficient microprocessor might cost just US$5 instead of US$30 and a system cost might stay below US$50, transmitter included. However, in recent years, the ability to receive as well as send using cheap microcontrollers (such as the Atmel AVR or the Motorola 68HC08 families) has been demonstrated. It seems, however, that any new system that is not compatible with the current Bell 202 modulation is unlikely to be widely adopted. The current modulation seems to fulfill sufficient need that little motivation exists to move to a superior design, especially if the new design requires significant hardware purchases. Most recently, a wholly new protocol with forward error correction has been created by Nino Carillo, KK4HEJ, called Improved Layer 2 Protocol (IL2P).

Irish nationalism celebrates the culture of Ireland, especially the Irish language, literature, music, and sports. It grew more potent during the period in which all of Ireland was part of the United Kingdom, which led to most of the island seceding from the UK in 1921. Irish nationalists assert that foreign rule has been detrimental to Irish interests. Politically, Irish nationalism gave way to many factions which created conflict, often violent, throughout the island. The chief division affecting nationalism in Ireland was religious. The majority of the island's population was Roman Catholic, which is the part that seceded, but a portion of the northern part has a Protestant majority that elected to stay a part of the United Kingdom. Since the partition of Ireland, Irish nationalism often refers to support for Irish reunification. History =Early development= Generally, Irish nationalism is regarded as having emerged following the Renaissance revival of the concept of the patria and the religious struggle between the ideology of the Protestant Reformation and the Catholic Counter- Reformation. At this early stage in the 16th century, Irish nationalism represented an ideal of the native Gaelic Irish and the Old English banding together in common cause, under the banner of Catholicism and Irish civic identity (\\"faith and fatherland/motherland\\"), hoping to protect their land and interests from the New English Protestant forces sponsored by England. This vision sought to overcome the old ethnic divide between Gaeil (the native Irish) and Gaill (the Normans) which had been a feature of Irish life since the 12th century, following the Norman invasion of Ireland. Protestantism in England introduced a religious element to the 16th-century Tudor conquest of Ireland, as many of the native Gaels and Hiberno-Normans remained Catholic. The Plantations of Ireland dispossessed many native Catholic landowners in favour of Protestant settlers from England and Scotland. In addition, the Plantation of Ulster, which began in 1609, \\"planted\\" a sizeable population of English and Scottish Protestant settlers into the north of Ireland. Irish aristocrats waged many campaigns against the English presence. A prime example is the rebellion of Hugh O'Neill which became known as the Nine Years War of 1594‚Äì1603, which aimed to expel the English and make Ireland a Spanish protectorate. The green harp flag was first used by Irish Confederate troops in the Eleven Years War, and became the main symbol of Irish nationalism from the 17th to the early 20th century. A more significant movement came in the 1640s, after the Irish Rebellion of 1641, when a coalition of Gaelic Irish and Old English Catholics set up a de facto independent Irish state to fight in the Wars of the Three Kingdoms (see Confederate Ireland). The Confederate Catholics of Ireland, also known as the Confederation of Kilkenny, emphasised the idea of Ireland as a Kingdom independent from England, albeit under the same monarch. They demanded autonomy for the Irish Parliament, full rights for Catholics and an end to the confiscation of Catholic-owned land. However, the Cromwellian conquest of Ireland (1649‚Äì53) destroyed the Confederate cause and resulted in the permanent dispossession of the old Catholic landowning class. A similar Irish Catholic monarchist movement emerged in the 1680s and 1690s, when Irish Catholic Jacobites supported James II after his deposition in England in the Glorious Revolution of 1688‚Äì1689. The Jacobites demanded that Irish Catholics have a majority in an autonomous Irish Parliament, the restoration of confiscated Catholic land, and an Irish-born Lord Deputy of Ireland. Similarly to the Confederates of the 1640s, the Jacobites were conscious of representing the \\"Irish nation\\", but were not separatists and largely represented the interests of the landed class as opposed to all the Irish people. Like the Confederates, they also suffered defeat, in the Williamite War in Ireland (1689‚Äì1691). Thereafter, the largely English Protestant Ascendancy dominated Irish government and landholding. The Penal Laws discriminated against non-Anglicans. (See also History of Ireland 1536‚Äì1691.) This coupling of religious and ethnic identity ‚Äì principally Roman Catholic and Gaelic ‚Äì as well as a consciousness of dispossession and defeat at the hands of British and Protestant forces, became enduring features of Irish nationalism. However, the Irish Catholic movements of the 16th century were invariably led by a small landed and clerical elite. Professor Kevin Whelan has traced the emergence of the modern Catholic-nationalist identity that formed in 1760‚Äì1830.The Tree of Liberty: Radicalism, Catholicism and the Construction of Irish Identity 1760‚Äì1830 1996, Cork UP; and see some online notes on Whelan. Irish historian Marc Caball, on the other hand, claims that \\"early modern Irish nationalism\\" began to be established after the Flight of the Earls (1607), based on the concepts of \\"the indivisibility of Gaelic cultural integrity, territorial sovereignty, and the interlinking of Gaelic identity with profession of the Roman Catholic faith\\". =Early nationalism= Pre-Union \\"Daniel O'Connell: The Champion of Liberty\\" poster published in Pennsylvania, 1847. The exclusively Protestant Parliament of Ireland of the eighteenth century repeatedly called for more autonomy from the British Parliament ‚Äì particularly the repeal of Poynings' Law, which allowed the latter to legislate for Ireland. They were supported by popular sentiment that came from the various publications of William Molyneux about Irish constitutional independence; this was later reinforced by Jonathan Swift's incorporation of these ideas into Drapier's Letters.Jonathan Swift: Volume III by Irvin EhrenpreisJonathan Swift and Ireland by Oliver W. Ferguson Parliamentarians who wanted more self-government formed the Irish Patriot Party, led by Henry Grattan, who achieved substantial legislative independence in 1782‚Äì83. Grattan and radical elements of the 'Irish Whig' party campaigned in the 1790s for Catholic political equality and a reform of electoral rights.Kelly, J. Henry Grattan (Dundalgan Press 1993) pp.27‚Äì35 He wanted useful links with Britain to remain, best understood by his comment: 'The channel [the Irish sea] forbids union; the ocean forbids separation'. Grattan's movement was notable for being both inclusive and nationalist as many of its members were descended from the Anglo/Irish minority. Many other nationalists such as Samuel Neilson, Theobald Wolfe Tone and Robert Emmet were also descended from plantation families which had arrived in Ireland since 1600. From Grattan in the 1770s to Parnell up to 1890, nearly all the leaders of Irish separatism were Protestant nationalists. Modern Irish nationalism with democratic aspirations began in the 1790s with the founding of the Society of the United Irishmen. It sought to end discrimination against Catholics and Presbyterians and to found an independent Irish republic. Most of the United Irish leaders were Catholic and Presbyterian and inspired by the French Revolution, wanted a society without sectarian divisions, the continuation of which they attributed to the British domination over the country. They were sponsored by the French Republic, which was then the enemy of the Holy See. The United Irishmen led the Irish Rebellion of 1798, which was repressed with great bloodshed. As a result, the Irish Parliament voted to abolish itself in the Act of Union of 1800‚Äì01 and thereafter Irish MPs sat in London. Post-Union Two forms of Irish nationalism arose from these events. One was a radical movement, known as Irish republicanism. It believed the use of force was necessary to found a secular, egalitarian Irish republic, advocated by groups such as the Young Irelanders, some of whom launched a rebellion in 1848. The other nationalist tradition was more moderate, urging non-violent means to seek concessions from the British government. While both nationalist traditions were predominantly Catholic in their support base, the hierarchy of the Catholic Church were opposed to republican separatism on the grounds of its violent methods and secular ideology, while they usually supported non-violent reformist nationalism. Daniel O'Connell was the leader of the moderate tendency. O'Connell, head of the Catholic Association and Repeal Association in the 1820s, '30s and '40s, campaigned for Catholic Emancipation ‚Äì full political rights for Catholics ‚Äì and then \\"Repeal of the Union\\", or Irish self-government under the Crown. Catholic Emancipation was achieved, but self-government was not. O'Connell's movement was more explicitly Catholic than its eighteenth-century predecessors. It enjoyed the support of the Catholic clergy, who had denounced the United Irishmen and reinforced the association between Irish identity and Catholicism. The Repeal Association used traditional Irish imagery, such as the harp, and located its mass meetings in sites such as Tara and Clontarf which had a special resonance in Irish history. =Repeal Association and Young Ireland= The Great Famine of 1845‚Äì49 caused great bitterness among Irish people against the British government, which was perceived as having failed to avert the deaths of up to a million people. British support for the 1860 plebiscites on Italian unification prompted Alexander Martin Sullivan to launch a \\"National Petition\\" for a referendum on repeal of the union; in 1861 Daniel O'Donoghue submitted the 423,026 signatures to no effect. The Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB) and Fenian Brotherhood were set up in Ireland and the United States, respectively, in 1858 by militant republicans, including Young Irelanders. The latter dissolved into factions after organising unsuccessful raids on Canada by Irish veterans of the American Civil War, and the IRB launched Clan na Gael as a replacement. In Ireland itself, the IRB tried an armed revolt in 1867 but, as it was heavily infiltrated by police informers, the rising was a failure. In the late 19th century, Irish nationalism became the dominant ideology in Ireland, having a major Parliamentary party in the Parliament of the United Kingdom at Westminster that launched a concerted campaign for self- government. =Land League= Mass nationalist mobilisation began when Isaac Butt's Home Rule League (which had been founded in 1873 but had little following) adopted social issues in the late 1870s ‚Äì especially the question of land redistribution. Michael Davitt (an IRB member) founded the Irish Land League in 1879 during an agricultural depression to agitate for tenant's rights. Some would argue the land question had a nationalist resonance in Ireland as many Irish Catholics believed that land had been unjustly taken from their ancestors by Protestant English colonists in the 17th-century Plantations of Ireland. Indeed, the Irish landed class was still largely an Anglo-Irish Protestant group in the 19th century. Such perceptions were underlined in the Land league's language and literature. However, others would argue that the Land League had its direct roots in tenant associations formed in the period of agricultural prosperity during the government of Lord Palmerston in the 1850s and 1860s, who were seeking to strengthen the economic gains they had already made. Following the depression of 1879 and the subsequent fall in prices (and hence profits), these farmers were threatened with rising rents and eviction for failure to pay rents. In addition, small farmers, especially in the west faced the prospect of another famine in the harsh winter of 1879. At first, the Land League campaigned for the \\"Three Fs\\" ‚Äì fair rent, free sale and fixity of tenure. Then, as prices for agricultural products fell further and the weather worsened in the mid-1880s, tenants organised themselves by withholding rent during the 1886‚Äì1891 Plan of Campaign movement. Militant nationalists such as the Fenians saw that they could use the groundswell of support for land reform to recruit nationalist support, this is the reason why the New Departure ‚Äì a decision by the IRB to adopt social issues ‚Äì occurred in 1879. Republicans from Clan na Gael (who were loath to recognise the British parliament) saw this as an opportunity to recruit the masses to agitate for Irish self-government. This agitation, which became known as the \\"Land War\\", became very violent when Land Leaguers resisted evictions of tenant farmers by force and the British Army and Royal Irish Constabulary was used against them. This upheaval eventually resulted in the British government subsidising the sale of landlords' estates to their tenants in the Irish Land Acts authored by William O'Brien. It also provided a mass base for constitutional Irish nationalists who had founded the Home Rule League in 1873. Charles Stewart Parnell (somewhat paradoxically, a Protestant landowner) took over the Land League and used its popularity to launch the Irish National League in 1882 as a support basis for the newly formed Irish Parliamentary Party, to campaign for Home Rule. =Cultural nationalism= A flowchart illustrating all the political parties that have existed throughout the history of Northern Ireland and leading up to its formation (1889 onwards). Nationalist parties are in green. An important feature of Irish nationalism from the late 19th century onwards was a commitment to Gaelic Irish culture. A broad intellectual movement, the Celtic Revival, grew up in the late 19th century. Though largely initiated by artists and writers of Protestant or Anglo-Irish background, the movement nonetheless captured the imaginations of idealists from native Irish and Catholic background. Periodicals such as United Ireland, Weekly News, Young Ireland, and Weekly National Press (1891‚Äì92), became influential in promoting Ireland's native cultural identity. A frequent contributor, the poet John McDonald's stated aim was \\"to hasten, as far as in my power lay, Ireland's deliverance\\". Other organisations promoting of the Irish language or the Gaelic Revival were the Gaelic League and later Conradh na Gaeilge. The Gaelic Athletic Association was also formed in this era to promote Gaelic football, hurling, and Gaelic handball; it forbade its members to play English sports such as association football, rugby union, and cricket. Most cultural nationalists were English speakers, and their organisations had little impact in the Irish speaking areas or Gaeltachta√≠, where the language has continued to decline (see article). However, these organisations attracted large memberships and were the starting point for many radical Irish nationalists of the early twentieth century, especially the leaders of the Easter Rising of 1916 such as Patrick Pearse,Sean Farrell Moran, \\"Patrick Pearse and the European Revolt Against Reason,\\" Journal of the History of Ideas, 1989; Patrick Pearse and the Politics of Redemption, (1994), Thomas MacDonagh,Johann Norstedt, Thomas MacDonagh, (1980) and Joseph Plunkett. The main aim was to emphasise an area of difference between Ireland and Germanic England, but the majority of the population continued to speak English. The cultural Gaelic aspect did not extend into actual politics; while nationalists were interested in the surviving Chiefs of the Name, the descendants of the former Gaelic clan leaders, the chiefs were not involved in politics, nor noticeably interested in the attempt to recreate a Gaelic state. =Home Rule beginnings= Although Parnell and some other Home Rulers, such as Isaac Butt, were Protestants, Parnell's party was overwhelmingly Catholic. At local branch level, Catholic priests were an important part of its organisation. Home Rule was opposed by Unionists (those who supported the Union with Britain), mostly Protestant and from Ulster under the slogan, \\"Home Rule is Rome Rule.\\" At the time, some politicians and members of the British public would have seen this movement as radical and militant. Detractors quoted Charles Stewart Parnell's Cincinnati speech in which he claimed to be collecting money for \\"bread and lead\\". He was allegedly sworn into the secret Irish Republican Brotherhood in May 1882. However, the fact that he chose to stay in Westminster following the expulsion of 29 Irish MPs (when those in the Clan expected an exodus of nationalist MPs from Westminster to set up a provisional government in Dublin) and his failure in 1886 to support the Plan of Campaign (an aggressive agrarian programme launched to counter agricultural distress), marked him as an essentially constitutional politician, though not averse to using agitational methods as a means of putting pressure on parliament. Coinciding as it did with the extension of the franchise in British politics ‚Äì and with it the opportunity for most Irish Catholics to vote ‚Äì Parnell's party quickly became an important player in British politics. Home Rule was favoured by William Ewart Gladstone, but opposed by many in the British Liberal and Conservative parties. Home Rule would have meant a devolved Irish parliament within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland. The first two Irish Home Rule Bills were put before the House of Commons of the United Kingdom in 1886 and 1893, but they were bitterly resisted and the second bill ultimately defeated in the Conservative's pro-Unionist majority controlled House of Lords. Following the fall and death of Parnell in 1891 after a divorce crisis, which enabled the Irish Roman Catholic hierarchy to pressure MPs to drop Parnell as their leader, the Irish Party split into two factions, the INL and the INF becoming practically ineffective from 1892 to 1898. Only after the passing of the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 which granted extensive power to previously non- existent county councils, allowing nationalists for the first time through local elections to democratically run local affairs previously under the control of landlord dominated \\"Grand Juries\\", and William O'Brien founding the United Irish League that year, did the Irish Parliamentary Party reunite under John Redmond in January 1900, returning to its former strength in the following September general election. =Transformation of rural Ireland= The first decade of the twentieth century saw considerable advancement in rural economic and social development in Ireland where 60% of the population lived. The introduction of local self-government in 1898 created a class of experienced politicians capable of later taking over national self-government in the 1920s. O'Brien's attainment of the 1903 Wyndham Land Act (the culmination of land agitation since the 1880s) abolished landlordism, and made it easier for tenant farmers to purchase lands, financed and guaranteed by the government. By 1914, 75 per cent of occupiers were buying out their landlords' freehold interest through the Land Commission, mostly under the Land Acts of 1903 and 1909.Ferriter, Diarmaid, The Transformation of Ireland 1900‚Äì2000 (2005) pp. 38+62 O'Brien then pursued and won in alliance with the Irish Land and Labour Association and D.D. Sheehan, who followed in the footsteps of Michael Davitt, the landmark 1906 and 1911 Labourers (Ireland) Acts, where the Liberal government financed 40,000 rural labourers to become proprietors of their own cottage homes, each on an acre of land. \\"It is not an exaggeration to term it a social revolution, and it was the first large-scale rural public- housing scheme in the country, with up to a quarter of a million housed under the Labourers Acts up to 1921, the majority erected by 1916\\",Ferriter, Diarmaid, The Transformation of Ireland 1900‚Äì2000, (2004) pp 159 changing the face of rural Ireland. The combination of land reform and devolved local government gave Irish nationalists an economic political base on which to base their demands for self-government. Some in the British administration felt initially that paying for such a degree of land and housing reform amounted to an unofficial policy of \\"killing home rule by kindness\\", yet by 1914 some form of Home Rule for most of Ireland was guaranteed. This was shelved on the outbreak of World War I in August 1914. A new source of radical Irish nationalism developed in the same period in the cities outside Ulster. In 1896, James Connolly, founded the Irish Socialist Republican Party in Dublin. Connolly's party was small and unsuccessful in elections, but his fusion of socialism and Irish republicanism was to have a sustained impact on republican thought. In 1913, during the general strike known as the Dublin Lockout, Connolly and James Larkin formed a workers militia, the Irish Citizen Army, to defend strikers from the police. While initially a purely defensive body, under Connolly's leadership, the ICA became a revolutionary body, dedicated to an independent Workers Republic in Ireland. After the outbreak of the First World War, Connolly became determined to launch an insurrection to this end. =Home Rule crisis 1912‚Äì14= Carson meeting, hosted by Protestants of Ballymoney. Speakers included Roger Casement and Robert Glendinning. Home Rule was eventually won by John Redmond and the Irish Parliamentary Party and granted under the Third Home Rule Act 1914. However, Irish self-government was limited by the prospect of partition of Ireland between north and south. This idea had first been mooted under the Second Home Rule Bill in 1893. In 1912, following the entry of the Third Home Rule Bill through the House of Commons, unionists organised mass resistance to its implementation, organising around the \\"Ulster Covenant\\". In 1912 they formed the Ulster Volunteers, an armed wing of Ulster Unionism who stated that they would resist Home Rule by force. British Conservatives supported this stance. In addition, in 1914 British officers based at the Curragh Camp indicated that they would be unwilling to act against the Ulster Volunteers should they be ordered to. In response, Nationalists formed their own paramilitary group, the Irish Volunteers, to ensure the implementation of Home Rule. It looked for several months in 1914 as if civil war was imminent between the two armed factions. Only the All-for- Ireland League party advocated granting every conceivable concession to Ulster to stave off a partition amendment. Redmond rejected their proposals. The amended Home Rule Act was passed and placed with Royal Assent on the statute books, but was suspended after the outbreak of World War I in 1914, until the end of the war. This led radical republican groups to argue that Irish independence could never be won peacefully and gave the northern question little thought at all. =World War I and the Easter Rising= The Irish Volunteer movement was divided over the attitude of their leadership to Ireland's involvement in World War I. The majority followed John Redmond in support of the British and Allied war effort, seeing it as the only option to ensure the enactment of Home Rule after the war, Redmond saying \\"you will return as an armed army capable of confronting Ulster's opposition to Home Rule\\". They split off from the main movement and formed the National Volunteers, and were among the 180,000 Irishmen who served in Irish regiments of the Irish 10th and 16th Divisions of the New British Army formed for the War. A minority of the Irish Volunteers, mostly led by members of the Irish Republican Brotherhood (IRB), refused to support the War and kept their arms to guarantee the passage of Home Rule. Within this grouping, another faction planned an insurrection against British rule in Ireland, while the War was going on. Critical in this regard were Patrick Pearse,Sean Farrell Moran, \\"Patrick Pearse and the Politics of Redemption\\", (1995), Ruth Dudley Edwards, \\"Patrick Pearse and the Triumph of Failure,\\" (1974), Joost Augustin, \\"Patrick Pearse,\\" (2009). Thomas MacDonagh, and Thomas Clarke. These men were part of an inner circle that were operating in secret within the ranks of the IRB to plan this rising unknown to the rest of the volunteers. James Connolly, the labour leader, first intended to launch his own insurrection for an Irish Socialist Republic decided early in 1916 to combine forces with the IRB. In April 1916, just over a thousand dissident Volunteers and 250 members of the Citizen's Army launched the Easter Rising in the Dublin General Post Office and, in the Easter Proclamation, proclaimed the independence of the Irish Republic. The Rising was put down within a week, at a cost of about 500 killed, mainly unengaged civilians. Although the rising failed, Britain's General Maxwell executed fifteen of the Rising's leaders, including Pearse, MacDonagh, Clarke and Connolly, and arrested some 3,000 political activists which led to widespread public sympathy for the rebel's cause. Following this example, physical force republicanism became increasingly powerful and, for the following seven years or so, became the dominant force in Ireland, securing substantial independence but at a cost of dividing Ireland. The Irish Parliamentary Party was discredited after Home Rule had been suspended at the outbreak of World War I, in the belief that the war would be over by the end of 1915, then by the severe losses suffered by Irish battalions in Gallipoli at Cape Helles and on the Western Front. They were also damaged by the harsh British response to the Easter Rising, who treated the rebellion as treason in time of war when they declared martial law in Ireland. Moderate constitutional nationalism as represented by the Irish Party was in due course eclipsed by Sinn F√©in ‚Äî a hitherto small party which the British had (mistakenly) blamed for the Rising and subsequently taken over as a vehicle for Irish Republicanism. Two further attempts to implement Home Rule in 1916 and 1917 also failed when John Redmond, leader of the Irish Party, refused to concede to partition while accepting there could be no coercion of Ulster. An Irish Convention to resolve the deadlock was established in July 1917 by the British Prime Minister, Lloyd George, its members both nationalists and unionists tasked with finding a means of implementing Home Rule. However, Sinn F√©in refused to take part in the Convention as it refused to discuss the possibility of full Irish independence. The Ulster unionists led by Edward Carson insisted on the partition of six Ulster counties from the rest of Ireland,ME Collins, Ireland 1868‚Äì1966, page 240 stating that the 1916 rebellion proved a parliament in Dublin could not be trusted. The Convention's work was disrupted in March 1918 by Redmond's death and the fierce German Spring Offensive on the Western Front, causing Britain to attempt to contemplate extending conscription to Ireland. This was extremely unpopular, opposed both by the Irish Parliamentary Party under its new leader John Dillon, the All-for-Ireland Party as well as Sinn F√©in and other national bodies. It resulted in the Conscription Crisis of 1918. In May at the height of the crisis 73 prominent Sinn F√©iners were arrested on the grounds of an alleged German Plot. Both these events contributed to a widespread rise in support for Sinn F√©in and the Volunteers.Sovereignty and partition, 1912‚Äì1949, p. 59, M. E. Collins, Edco Publishing (2004) The Armistice ended the war in November, and was followed by elections. =Militant separatism and Irish independence= In the General election of 1918, Sinn F√©in won 73 seats, 25 of these unopposed, or statistically nearly 70% of Irish representation, under the British \\"First past the post\\" voting-system, but had a minority representation in Ulster. They achieved a total of 476,087 (46.9%) of votes polled for 48 seats, compared to 220,837 (21.7%) votes polled by the IPP for only six seats, who due to the \\"first past the post\\" voting system did not win a proportional share of seats.Sovereignty and partition, 1912‚Äì1949, p.62, M. E. Collins, Edco Publishing (2004) Unionists (including Unionist Labour) votes were 305,206 (30.2%)B.M. Walker Parliamentary Election Results in Ireland, 1801‚Äì1822 The Sinn F√©in MPs refused to take their seats in Westminster, 27 of these (the rest were either still imprisoned or impaired) setting up their own Parliament called the D√°il √âireann in January 1919 and proclaimed the Irish Republic to be in existence. Nationalists in the south of Ireland, impatient with the lack of progress on Irish self-government, tended to ignore the unresolved and volatile Ulster situation, generally arguing that unionists had no choice but to ultimately follow. On 11 September 1919, the British proscribed the D√°il, it had met nine times, declaring it an illegal assembly, Ireland being still part of the United Kingdom. In 1919, a guerilla war broke out between the Irish Republican Army (IRA) (as the Irish Volunteers were now calling themselves) and the British security forces (See Irish War of Independence). The campaign created tensions between the political and military sides of the nationalist movement. The IRA, nominally subject to the D√°il, in practice, often acted on its own initiative. At the top, the IRA leadership, of Michael Collins and Richard Mulcahy, operated with little reference to Cathal Brugha, the D√°il's Minister for Defence or √âamon de Valera, the President of the Irish Republic ‚Äì at best giving them a supervisory role. At local level, IRA commanders such as Dan Breen, Sean Moylan, Tom Barry, Sean MacEoin, Liam Lynch and others avoided contact with the IRA command, let alone the D√°il itself. This meant that the violence of the War of Independence rapidly escalated beyond what many in Sinn F√©in and D√°il were happy with. Arthur Griffith, for example, favoured passive resistance over the use of force, but he could do little to affect the cycle of violence between IRA guerrillas and Crown forces that emerged over 1919‚Äì1920. The military conflict produced only a handful of killings in 1919, but steadily escalated from the summer of 1920 onwards with the introduction of the paramilitary police forces, the Black and Tans and Auxiliary Division into Ireland. From November 1920 to July 1921, over 1000 people lost their lives in the conflict (compared to c.400 until then). Present day Northern Ireland is not a part of the Republic, but it has a nationalist minority who would prefer to be part of a united Ireland. In Northern Ireland, the term \\"nationalist\\" is used to refer either to the Catholic population in general or the supporters of the moderate Social Democratic and Labour Party. \\"Nationalism\\" in this restricted meaning refers to a political tradition that favours an independent, united Ireland achieved by non-violent means. The more militant strand of nationalism, as espoused by Sinn F√©in, is generally described as \\"republican\\" and was regarded as somewhat distinct, although the modern-day party claims to be a constitutional party committed to exclusively peaceful and democratic means. 56% of Northern Irish voters voted for the United Kingdom to remain a part of the European Union in the 23 June 2016 Referendum in which the country as a whole voted to leave the union. The results in Northern Ireland were influenced by fears of a strong border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland as well as by fears of a hard border breaking the Good Friday Agreement.

Early life and education Born in Sheffield into an old recusant family, he was head boy at Ampleforth College in North Yorkshire during his youth; later, he read law at Balliol College, Oxford, and worked for the Yorkshire Post in Leeds from 1961. In 1963, he spent a year as a Harkness Fellow in the US and he spent the next year working as a congressional fellow. Journalistic career In 1965, Young returned to the United Kingdom. He was recruited by Denis Hamilton of The Sunday Times. In his second year there, he became chief leader writer, a position he kept until 1977. From 1973‚Äì84, he was also the paper's political editor. He established a Sunday column, \\"Inside Politics\\", that made him famous. Beginning in 1981, he also held the position of joint deputy editor. However, Young's relationship with The Sunday Times cooled notably when Rupert Murdoch took over the paper in 1981. The conflict culminated in a series of battles with editor Andrew Neil, particularly over the US invasion of Grenada in 1983. This ultimately led to Young's leaving The Sunday Times and joining The Guardian in 1984.Hugo Young obituary, The Guardian; accessed 20 April 2014. Young continued to write a twice-weekly political column at The Guardian until his death, and was widely acclaimed as one of the most important and influential figures in modern British journalism. Young was a strong proponent of European integration, and sharply expressed his disappointment with the British government's eurosceptic politics in his columns, including Prime Minister Tony Blair's decision to side with George W. Bush instead of his EU partners in the 2003 invasion of Iraq.Column archive, The Guardian; accessed 20 April 2014. Despite these differences, Young remained on good terms with British government ministers, including Tony Blair and Margaret Thatcher. He wrote a critical biography of the latter, One of Us (1989), in addition to a very critical article he wrote two weeks before his death but which was not published until after Thatcher's death, nearly ten years after his own. He wrote other books, including This Blessed Plot: Britain And Europe From Churchill To Blair, which was published in 1998. From 1989 onwards, Young was the chairman of the Scott Trust, which owns The Guardian and other news media, and helped the paper through important developments such as the purchase of The Observer. His papers are held at the Guardian News & Media Archive in London. The Hugo Young Lecture There is now an annual Hugo Young lecture, organised by The Guardian in Young's memory. It has been delivered by figures such as David Cameron, Nick Clegg, Ed Miliband, Marjorie Scardino and Alex Salmond. Personal life Young married twice. His first wife, Helen Mason, with whom he had three daughters, including the film director Emily Young, and one son, died in 1989 of lung cancer. He remarried a year later, this time to American artist Lucy Waring. He died at age 64 of colon cancer.Hugo Young obituary, The Times; accessed 20 April 2014.

In Anglo-Saxon England, it was commonly applied to aristocratic retainers of a king or senior nobleman. As the ranks of ealdormen, or high-reeve were purely political and administrative, neither were noble titles at the time. It was also used in early medieval Scandinavia for classes of the greater nobility.  Etymology  Seal of Godwin the thegn (minister), first half of 11th century. British Museum. Old English ' (, \\"servant, attendant, retainer\\") is cognate with Old High German and Old Norse (\\"thane, franklin, freeman, man\\").Northvegr - Zo√´ga's A Concise Dictionary of Old Icelandic The thegn had a military significance, and its usual Latin translation was miles, meaning soldier, although minister was often used. The 'Anglo-Saxon Dictionary' describes a thegn as \\"one engaged in a king's or a queen's service, whether in the household or in the country\\". It adds: \\"the word...seems gradually to acquire a technical meaning,...denoting a class, containing several degrees\\", but what remained consistent throughout was its association with military service. After the Norman conquest of England in 1066, William the Conqueror replaced the Anglo-Saxon aristocracy with Normans, who replaced the previous terminology with their own. Those previously known as King\`s Thanes became Princes, Middle-thegns became Counts, and ordinary thegns became barons; thus the thegnly class all belonged to the greater nobility and the Vanafor-class merged with the Norman knights, and untitled nobility of which they formed the majority.  Gesith and thegns  The precursor of thegn was the gesith, the companion of the king or great lord, a member of his comitatus. The concept of personal association is traceable in all applications of gesith; 'thegn' began to be used to describe a military gesith. It is only used once in the laws before the time of Aethelstan (), but more frequently in the charters. Apparently unconnected to the German and Dutch word , or serve, H. M. Chadwick suggests \\"the sense of subordination must have been inherent...from the earliest time\\". It gradually expanded in meaning and use, to denote a member of a territorial nobility, while thegnhood was attainable by fulfilling certain conditions. The nobility of pre-Conquest England was ranked according to the heriot paid in the following order: earl, king's thegn, median thegn. In Anglo-Saxon society, a king's thegn attended the king in person, bringing his own men and resources. A \\"median\\" thegn did not hold his land directly from the king, but through an intermediary lord. Status and ranking The word gesiths, used in the Beowulf saga While inferior to the √¶theling, or of a kingly family, the thegn was superior to the ceorl. Chadwick states; \\"from the time of √Üthelstan, the distinction between thegn and ceorl was the broad line of demarcation between the classes of society\\". His relative status was reflected in the level of weregild, generally fixed at 1,200 shillings, or six times that of the ceorl. He was the twelfhynde man of the laws, as distinct from the twyhynde man, or ceorl. While some inherited the rank of thegn, others acquired it through property ownership, or wealth. A hide of land was considered sufficient to support a family; the Ge√æync√∞o states; \\"And if a ceorl throve, so that he had fully five hides of his own land, church and kitchen, bellhouse and burh-gate-seat, and special duty in the king's hail, then was he thenceforth of thegn-right worthy.\\" This also applied to merchants, who \\"fared thrice over the wide sea by his own means.\\" In the same way, a successful thegn might hope to become an earl. Over time, the increase in the number of thegns, or thanes, led to the creation of three distinct classes; the King's Thanes, Middle-Thanes, and ordinary Thanes. A King's Thane was a person of great importance, with special privileges. No one save the king had the right of jurisdiction over him; in return, one of Canute's laws makes it clear he paid a larger heriot than an ordinary thegn. The distinction between the ordinary Thanes and the King\`s Thanes, or those of the first class, has been defined by folklorist Sir George Laurence Gomme as \\"a Baron, or petty Prince, ruling under the Sovereign\\". This is analogous to the evolution of a warlord's henchman to vassal, one of Charlemagne's great companions. In Domesday Book, OE has become in the Latin form, but the word does not imply high status. Domesday Book lists the who hold lands directly from the king at the end of their respective counties, but the term became devalued, partly because there were so many thegns. Modern survival Map of Scandinavia; red dots show location of runestones, describing the deceased as a thegn. Blue dots indicate stones that mention the junior position \\"drengr\\". Although their exact role is unclear, the twelve senior thegns of the hundred played a part in the development of the English system of justice. Under a law of Aethelred they \\"seem to have acted as the judicial committee of the court for the purposes of accusation. This indicates some connection with the modern jury trial. In Norway, and elsewhere in Scandinavia, the members of the dynastic family House of Rosensverd (sometimes called Handingman) Royal descendants of king Haakon V still hold the title of King's Thanes, amongst other titles. The rank of Middle-Thane persists in the modern title of Count, from the Latin comes. During the later part of the 10th and in the 11th centuries in Denmark and Sweden, it became common for families or comrades to raise memorial runestones, and approximately fifty of these note that the deceased was a thegn. Examples of such runestones include S√∂ 170 at N√§lberga, Vg 59 at Norra H√§rene, Vg 150 at Velanda, DR 143 at Gunderup, DR 209 at Glavendrup, and DR 277 at Rydsg√•rd.

Biography Born in Derbyshire in 1788, Bosworth was educated at Repton School as a 'Poor Scholar' but left in his early teens and did not go to university. Despite the lack of a degree he somehow gained sufficient academic standing for the Church of England to allow him to become a priest. He became a curate in Bunny, Notts in 1814 and three years later became vicar of Little Horwood, Buckinghamshire. He was proficient in many European languages and made a particular study of Anglo-Saxon. This suggests that his years between leaving Repton and becoming a priest were spent working for someone whose own interests lay in these directions and who greatly encouraged Bosworth's academic development. There is no proof as to who this was but possible candidates are Sharon Turner (1768-1847), a London solicitor turned researcher or Alexander Crombie (1762-1840), a Scottish-born philologist and proprietor of a school in London. Bosworth was awarded an M.A. in 1822 by the University of Aberdeen on the recommendation of three other Buckinghamshire clergymen. In 1823, his Elements of Anglo-Saxon Grammar appeared, and he also matriculated at Trinity College, Cambridge as a 'ten-year man' (mature student). In July 1825 he was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society,American Antiquarian Society Members Directory and in June 1829, he was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society. In 1829, Bosworth went to the Netherlands as a chaplain, first in Amsterdam and then in Rotterdam. In 1831, the degree of Ph.D. was conferred on him by the University of Leyden. Trinity College, Cambridge granted him the degree of B.D. in 1834 and D.D. in 1839. He remained in the Netherlands until 1840, working on his A Dictionary of the Anglo-Saxon Language (1838), his best-known work. Thomas Northcote Toller later compiled a new edition of the dictionary based on Bosworth's work, both printed and in manuscript, and added a supplement (2 vols. 1898-1921). The University of Aberdeen granted him a LL.D. in 1838 on the recommendation of Alexander Crombie (see above) and Thomas Orger. In 1858 Bosworth became Rector of Water Stratford, Buckinghamshire, and Rawlinsonian Professor of Anglo-Saxon at Oxford. He gave ¬£10,000 to the University of Cambridge in 1867 for the establishment of the professorship of Anglo-Saxon. He died on 27 May 1876 leaving behind him a mass of annotations on the Anglo-Saxon charters and was buried on 2 June 1876 in Water Stratford churchyard. Income from his estate was left to various relatives for their lifetimes but as they died it was added to the endowment of his Oxford professorship. Legacy Bosworth was succeeded by John Earle (1824‚Äì1903) and Arthur Sampson Napier (1853‚Äì1916). In 1916, the chair was renamed to Rawlinson and Bosworth Professor of Anglo-Saxon in honour of Bosworth and his endowment, the first \\"Rawlinson and Bosworth\\" professor being Sir William Alexander Craigie (1867‚Äì1957), who in 1925 moved to a post at the University of Chicago (in order to work on his Dictionary of American English) and was succeeded by J.

Crashaw was the son of a famous Anglican divine with Puritan beliefs who earned a reputation as a hard-hitting pamphleteer and polemicist against Catholicism. After his father's death, Crashaw was educated at Charterhouse School and Pembroke College, Cambridge. After taking a degree, Crashaw taught as a fellow at Peterhouse, Cambridge and began to publish religious poetry that expressed a distinct mystical nature and an ardent Christian faith. Crashaw was ordained as a clergyman in the Church of England and in his theology and practice embraced the High Church ritual reforms enacted by Archbishop Laud. Rev. Crashaw became infamous among English Puritans for his use of religious art to decorate his church, for his devotion to the Virgin Mary, for his use of Catholic vestments, and for many other reasons. During these years, however, the University of Cambridge was a hotbed for such practices and for Royalist politics. Adherents of both positions were violently persecuted by Puritan forces during and after the English Civil War (1642‚Äì1651). When Puritan General Oliver Cromwell seized control of the city in 1643, Crashaw was ejected from his post and became a refugee in France and in the Papal States. He found employment as an attendant to Cardinal Giovanni Battista Maria Pallotta at Rome. While in exile he converted from Anglicanism to Catholicism. In April 1649, Cardinal Pallotta appointed Crashaw to a minor benefice as canon of the Shrine of the Holy House at Loreto where he died suddenly four months later. Crashaw's poetry, although often categorised with those of the contemporary English metaphysical poets, exhibits similarities with the Baroque poets and influenced in part by the works of Italian and Spanish mystics. It draws parallels \\"between the physical beauties of nature and the spiritual significance of existence\\".Editors, \\"Richard Crashaw\\", Encyclop√¶dia Britannica (online edition, last updated 21 February 2013).

Life =Early life= Thomas Sutton bequeathed money to maintain a chapel, hospital, and school at the London Charterhouse, a former Carthusian monastery, where Crashaw studied from 1629 to 1631. Richard Crashaw was born in London, England, circa 1612 or 1613. He is the only son of Anglican divine William Crashaw (1572‚Äì1626). The exact date of his birth and the name of his mother are not known, but it is thought that he was born either during Advent Season in 1612 or near the Feast of the Epiphany (6 January) in 1613.Albert J. Gerlitz, \\"Richard Crashaw, c. 1613-1649\\", The Age of Milton: An Encyclopedia of Major 17th-century British and American Authors edited by Alan Hagar. (Westport, CT: Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004), 93. It is possible that Richard Crashaw was baptised by James Ussher, later the Archbishop of Armagh.Edmund W. Gosse, \\"Richard Crashaw\\", in Eliakim Littell and Robert S. Littell (editors), Littell's Living Age, Volume 157, No. 2027 (Boston: Littell & Co., 28 April 1883), 195‚Äì204. His father‚Äîa Cambridge-educated clergyman who was appointed as a preacher at London's Inner Temple‚Äîwas born in or near Handsworth, a village near Sheffield, West Riding of Yorkshire, and came from a prosperous family. It is thought that Crashaw's mother, his father's first wife, died during her son's infancy. William Crashaw's second wife, Elizabeth Skinner, whom he married in 1619, died the following year in childbirth. William Crashaw wrote and published many pamphlets advocating Puritan theology and sharply critical of Catholicism. He was \\"a man of unchallenged repute for learning in his day, an argumentative but eloquent preacher, strong in his Protestantism, and fierce in his denunciation of 'Romish falsifications' and 'besotted Jesuitries'\\". Despite this opposition to Catholic thought, the elder Crashaw was attracted by Catholic devotion as exhibited by his translation of verse by Catholic poets.Itrat Husain, The Mystical Element in the Metaphysical Poets of the Seventeenth Century (New York: Biblo & Tannen Publishers, 1948), 159‚Äì192, at 160. While there is nothing certain about young Richard's early education, it is thought he benefited from his father's private library, which contained many Catholic works and was described as \\"one of the finest private theological libraries of the time\\".LC Martin, 1957, xviJack Dalglish, Eight Metaphysical Poets (Oxford: Harcourt/Heinemann Education Publishers, 1961), 155. At an early age, he could have been exposed to works including Bernard of Clairvauxs Sermons on the Song of Songs, the life of Catherine of Siena, the Revelations of Saint Bridget, and the writings of Richard Rolle.Austin Warren, Richard Crashaw: A Study in Baroque Sensibility (London: Faber and Faber, 1939), 210‚Äì11. fn. 2 William's death in 1626 rendered Richard an orphan when he was 13 or 14 years old. However, England's attorney general, Sir Henry Yelverton and Sir Ranulph Crewe, a prominent judge, friends and colleagues of his late father through the Inner Temple, were appointed as the young orphan's guardians. The two men supported Richard's entry into the Charterhouse School in 1629 and subsequently entry into Pembroke Hall, Cambridge in 1631 where he formally matriculated the following year. =Education= The Old Court at Pembroke College, Cambridge From 1629 to 1631, Crashaw attended the Charterhouse School in London. The school was established on the grounds of a former Carthusian monastery. At Charterhouse, Crashaw was a pupil of the school's headmaster, Robert Brooke, required students to write epigrams and verse in Greek and Latin based on the Epistle and Gospel readings from the day's chapel services.(Martin, 1957, xx, 415) Crashaw continued this exercise as an undergraduate at Cambridge and a few years later would assemble many these epigrams for his first collection of poems, Epigrammatum Sacrorum Liber (trans. \\"A Book of Sacred Epigrams\\"), published in 1634. According to clergyman and editor Alexander Grosart, Crashaw was \\"as thoroughly Protestant, in all probability, as his father could have desired\\" before his graduation from Pembroke Hall in 1634.Grosart, \\"Essay on the Life and Poetry of Crashaw\\", in The Complete Works of Richard Crashaw (1873), vol. 2, p. xlii. During the course of his education, Crashaw gravitated to the High Church tradition in Anglicanism, particularly towards the ideals and ritual practices that emphasised the church's Catholic heritage and were advocated by William Laud, Archbishop of Canterbury. Laud, with the support of King Charles I, reoriented the practices of the Church of England with a programme of reforms that sought \\"beauty in holiness\\", and sought to incorporate \\"more reverence and decorum in church ceremonial and service, in the decoration of churches, and in the elaboration of the ritual\\".Husain, at 159 This movement, called Laudianism, rose out of the influence of the Counter-Reformation. The University of Cambridge was a centre of the Laudian movement at the time of Crashaw's attendance. Richard formally matriculated as a scholar at Pembroke on Easter, 26 March 1632. at a time that the college's master was the Rev'd Benjamin Lany, an Anglican clergyman and friend of William Crashaw. Early in his career, Lany shared many of the elder Crashaw's Puritan beliefs. However, Lany's beliefs evolved toward more High Church practices. It is likely that Richard was under Lany's influence while at Pembroke. It is also thought that at this time, Crashaw became acquainted with Nicholas Ferrar and participated in Ferrar's religious community at Little Gidding, near the city of Cambridge, noted for its adherence to High Church rituals centred around Ferrar's model of a humble spiritual life of devoted to prayer and eschewing material, worldly life. Little Gidding was criticised by its Puritan detractors as a \\"Protestant Nunnery\\". Pembroke Hall (now known as Pembroke College) conferred on Crashaw a Bachelor of Arts (B.A.) degree in 1634. This degree was promoted to a Master of Arts in 1638 by Cambridge, and through incorporation ad eundem gradum by the University of Oxford in 1641. =High Churchman and Cambridge fellow= The Old Court at Peterhouse, Cambridge, the oldest constituent college of the university, which Crashaw described as \\"a little contentfull kingdom\\" For eight years, beginning in 1636, Crashaw was appointed as a fellow of Peterhouse, the oldest constituent college at the University of Cambridge. In 1638 Crashaw took holy orders in the Church of England, and was installed as curate of the Church of St Mary the Less, Cambridge. This church, commonly known as \\"Little St Mary's\\", is adjacent to Peterhouse and had served as the college's chapel until the opening of a new chapel within the college in 1632. Peterhouse's master, John Cosin, and many of the college's fellows, adhered toward Laudianism and embraced the Anglican faith's catholic heritage. In these years, also, Crashaw became more intimately connected with the Ferrar family and frequently visited Little Gidding. Crashaw incorporated these influences into his conduct at St Mary the Less including holding late night prayer vigils, and adorning the chapel with relics, crucifixes, and images of the Madonna.(Husain) According to an early Crashaw biographer, David Lloyd, Crashaw attracted Christians who came to his services eager to hear his sermons, \\"that ravished more like Poems, than both the Poet and Saint... scattering not so much Sentences as Extasies\\".David Lloyd, Memoires (1668) Because of the tensions between Laudian adherents and their Puritan detractors, the Puritans often sent people to attend church services in order to identify and gather evidence of \\"superstitious\\" or \\"Popish\\" idolatry. In 1641, Crashaw would be cited for Mariolatry (excessive devotion to the Virgin Mary) and for his superstitious practices of \\"diverse bowings, cringeings\\" and incensing before the altar\\". With the advance of Cromwell's forces on Cambridge, Crashaw was forced to resign from his fellowship at Peterhouse. He and five of his colleagues were ousted because of their refusal to sign the Solemn League and Covenant.Edward Hutton, The Cities of Romagna and the Marches (New York: Macmillan, 1913), 177. This began his exile from \\"the contentfull little kingdom\\" at Peterhouse that he cherished. Shortly after Crashaw's departure from the city, Little St Mary's was ransacked on 29 and 30 December 1643 by William Dowsing, an iconoclast who was ordered by Edward Montagu, 2nd Earl of Manchester, a parliamentary commander during the Civil War, to rid Anglican churches in Suffolk and Cambridgeshire of any ornaments or images connected to Roman Catholic \\"superstitions\\" or \\"popery\\". Dowsing faithfully kept a journal of his destructive efforts at over 250 churches, recording that at Little St Mary's \\"we brake downe 60 superstitious pictures, some popes, and crucifixes, and God the Father sitting in a chayer, and holding a globe in his hand\\".Edmund Carter, The History of the Country of Cambridge (Cambridge: T. James, printer, 1753), 37; William Dowsing, \\"The Journal of William Dowsing\\", William Dowsing (website).

Crashaw's poetry took on decidedly Catholic imagery, especially in his poems written about of Spanish mystic St Teresa of Avila. Teresa's writings were unknown in England and unavailable in English. However, Crashaw had been exposed to her work, and the three poems he wrote in her honor‚Äî\\"A Hymn to Sainte Teresa,\\" \\"An Apologie for the fore-going Hymne,\\" and \\"The Flaming Heart\\"‚Äî are, arguably, his most sublime works. Crashaw began writing poems influenced by the George Herbert's collection The Temple‚Äîan influence likely derived from Herbert's connection to Nicholas Ferrar. Several of these poems Crashaw later collected in a series titled Steps to the Temple and The Delights of the Muses by an anonymous friend and published in one volume in 1646. This collection included Crashaw's translation of Giambattista Marinis Sospetto d'Herode. In his preface, the collection's anonymous editor described the poems as having the potential to induce a considerable effect on the reader‚Äîit would \\"lift thee Reader, some yards above the ground.\\" The sermons of the subject were powerful and well-attended, but have not come down to us.Warren, Austin. ‚ÄúRichard Crashaw, ‚ÄòCatechist and Curate.‚Äô‚Äù Modern Philology, vol. 32, no. 3, 1935, pp. 261‚Äì269. JSTOR website Retrieved 26 June 2019. =Exile, conversion, and death= Little St Mary's, Cambridge Having been expelled from his fellowship in 1644, Crashaw fled into exile. Before departing he arranged for Ferrar Collet to assume his fellowship. Collete, one of his pupils at Peterhouse was the son of Mary Collet, the niece of Nicholas Ferrar. Crashaw then accompanied Mary Collet, whom he revered as his \\"gratious mother\\", into exile on the Continent settling first in Leiden.(\\"Richard Crashaw and Mary Collett\\" Church Quarterly Review, vol. lxxiii) It was at the onset of his exile that Crashaw is thought to have formally converted from Anglicanism to Catholicism. According to the Athanae Oxoniensis (1692), antiquarian Anthony √† Wood explains the reasoning for Crashaw's conversion as the result of fearing the destruction of his beloved religion by the Puritans: \\"an infallible foresight that the Church of England would be quite ruined by the unlimited fury of the Presbyterians\\".Anthony √† Wood, Fasti Oxonienses, in Athanae Oxonienses (London: Printed for Thomas Bennet, 1692), 2:688. However, according to Husain, During this period, Queen Henrietta Maria, the wife of King Charles I and her court fled in exile‚Äîat first at Oxford, a royalist stronghold, and later to Paris in July 1644. At some point in 1645, Crashaw appeared in Paris, where he encountered Thomas Car, whose original name was Miles Pinkney,\\"Crashaw, Richard\\", in British Authors before 1800: A Biographical Dictionary (1952), New York: Wilson. the experienced confessor to English refugees. The poet's vagrant existence made a lasting impression on Car, as shown by \\"The Anagramme\\": > He seeks no downes, no sheetes, his bed's still made. If he can find a > chaire or stoole, he's layd, When day peepes in, he quitts his restlesse > rest. And still, poore soule, before he's up he's dres't. It was at this time Abraham Cowley discovered Crashaw living in abject poverty in Paris. Cowley sought the Queen's influence in securing Crashaw a position in Rome. Crashaw's friend and patron, Susan Feilding, Countess of Denbigh, also used her influence at court to persuade the Queen to recommend Crashaw to the Pope. Crashaw made his way as a pilgrim to Rome in November 1646 where he continued to struggle with poverty and ill health, and while waiting for some papal retainer. Crashaw was introduced to the Pope as \\"the learned son of a famous Heretic\\".(Martin 1957, xxxvn4) Coincidentally, according to literary historian Maureen Sabine, though the Puritans who forced Crashaw into exile would have described him as the heretical son of a learned performer.Maureen Sabine, \\"Crashaw and Abjection: Reading the Unthinkable in His Devotional Verse\\", in John Donne and the Metaphysical Poets, edited by Harold Bloom. (New York: Bloom's Literary Criticism/Infobase Publishing, 2010), 111-129. After renewed diplomatic entreaties to the pope in 1647, Crashaw secured a post with the virtuous Cardinal Palotto who was closely associated with the English College.Pope Alexander the Seventh and the College of Cardinals by John Bargrave, edited by James Craigie Robertson (reprint; 2009) and stayed at the Venerable English College. Crashaw moral sensitivities caused him to express shock at some of the amoral behaviour of some of the Cardinal's entourage and express his complaints directly to the Cardinal. When some of these complaints became public, several in the cardinal's retinue protested about his presence and expressed outright animosity toward Crashaw. The Italians who had evil designs toward the subject prompted the Cardinal to discharge him for his safety.\\"Richard Crashaw\\". (1959-1960 reprint of 1885-1901 edition).

Finally, in April 1649, the cardinal procured him a cathedral benefice at the Basilica della Santa Casa at Loreto, Marche. Weakened by his precarious existence in exile, Crashaw set out for Loreto in May and died there of a fever on 21 August 1649. There were suspicions that Crashaw was poisoned, possibly by persons within the Cardinal's circle. Crashaw was buried in the lady chapel of the shrine at Loreto. Poetry =Writing and publication history= Three collections of Crashaw's poetry were published during his lifetime and one small volume posthumously‚Äîthree years after his death. The posthumous collection, Carmen Del Nostro, included 33 poems. For his first collection of poems, Crashaw turned to the epigrams composed during his schooling, assembling these efforts to form the core of his first book, Epigrammatum Sacrorum Liber (trans. \\"A Book of Sacred Epigrams\\"), published in 1634. Among its well-known lines is Crashaw's observation on the miracle of turning water into wine (): Nympha pudica Deum vidit, et erubuit, often translated as \\"the modest water saw its God, and blushed\\". For instance, this quatrain, titled Dominus apud suos vilis from the collection, was based on a passage from the Gospel of Luke:Richard Crashaw, translated by Clement Barksdale, \\"III. Dominus apud suos vilis\\" (\\"The Lord despised and rejected by his own people\\"). See Alexander B. Grosart (ed), The Complete Works of Richard Crashaw, (London: printed for private circulation by Robson and Sons, 1873), vol. 2, p. 37. Crashaw's epigram (1634) : III. : En consanguinei! Patriis en exul in oris : Christus! et haud alibi tam peregrinus erat. : Qui socio demum pendebat sanguine latro, : O consanguineus quam fuit ille magis Clement Barksdale's translation (1873) : III. : See, O Kinsman, what strange thing is this! : Christ in's own country a great stranger is. : The thief which bled upon the Cross with Thee : Was more ally'd in consanguinity. A literal translation : III. : Behold kinsmen! He who was an exile in his homeland‚Äî : The Christ, who was as a stranger there and not so elsewhere. : He, the thief who bled at the end, hanging with him‚Äî : Oh!‚Äîhe was closer a blood relation. =Themes= Title page of Crashaw's Steps to the Temple (1646) which was published during Crashaw's exile Crashaw's work has as its focus the devotional pursuit of divine love. According to Sabine, his poems \\"reveal new springs of tenderness as he became absorbed in a Laudian theology of love, in the religious philanthropy practiced by his Pembroke master, Benjamin Laney, and preached by his tutor, John Tournay, and in the passionate poetic study of the Virgin Mother and Christ Child\\". Sabine asserts that as a result of his Marian devotion and Catholic sensibilities, \\"In expressing his Christian love for all men, even the archenemy of his father and most English Protestants, Crashaw began to feel what it was like for Christ to be a stranger in his own land.\\" He depicts women, most notably the Virgin Mary, but also Teresa of √Åvila and Mary Magdalene, as the embodiment of virtue, purity and salvation.Paul A. Parrish, \\"Crashaw's Life and Art\\", The Muses Common-Weale: Poetry and Politics in the Seventeenth Century, edited by Claude J. Summers and Ted-Larry Pebworth (Columbia, MO: University of Missouri Press, 1988), 162. Indeed, Crashaw's three poems in honour of the mystical Saint Teresa of Avila--\\"A Hymn to Sainte Teresa,\\" \\"An Apologie for the fore-going Hymne,\\" and \\"The Flaming Heart\\" are considered his most sublime works. According to Maureen Sabine, \\"In his finest contemplative verse, he would reach out from the evening stillness of the sanctuary to an embattled world that was deaf to the soothing sound of Jesus, the name which, to his mind, cradled the cosmos.\\"Maureen Sabine. \\"Richard Crashaw, 1612-1649\\" Poetry Foundation. Retrieved 12 January 2015. According to Husain, Crashaw is not a mystic‚Äîand not by traditional definitions of mysticism‚Äîhe is simply a devotee who had a mystic temperament because he \\"often appears to us as an ecstatic poet writing about the mystical experiences of a great saint (St. Teresa) rather than conveying the richness of his own mystical experience\\".Husain, 164 Husain continued to categorise Crashaw's poems into four topic areas: While Crashaw is categorised as one of the metaphysical poets, his poetry differs from those of the other metaphysical poets by its cosmopolitan and continental influences. As a result of this eclectic mix of influences, literary scholar Maureen Sabine states that Crashaw is usually \\"regarded as the incongruous younger brother of the Metaphysicals who weakens the 'strong line' of their verse or the prodigal son who 'took his journey into a far country', namely the Continent and Catholicism.\\" Lorraine M. Roberts writes Crashaw \\"happily set out to follow in the steps of George Herbert\\" with the influence of The Temple (1633), and that \\"confidence in God's love prevails in his poetry and marks his voice as distinctly different from that of Donne in relation to sin and death and from that of Herbert in his struggle to submit his will to that of God.\\"Lorraine M. Roberts, \\"Crashaw's Sacred Voice: A Commerce of Contrary Powers\\", (Roberts, New Perspectives, 70), 66‚Äì79. =Critical reception= Much of the negative criticism of Crashaw's work stems from an anti-Catholic sentiment in English letters‚Äîespecially among critics who claim that his verse suffered as a result of his religious conversion. Conversely, the Protestant poet Abraham Cowley memorialised Crashaw in an elegy expresses a conciliatory opinion of Crashaw's Catholic character\\" Today, Crashaw's work is largely unknown and unreadThomas F. Healy, Richard Crashaw (Leiden: Brill Archive, 1986), 1.‚Äî if he is not the \\"most important\\" he is certainly one of the most distinguished of the metaphysical poets. Crashaw's poetry has inspired or directly influenced the work of many poets in his own day, and throughout the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twentieth centuries. According to literary scholars Lorraine Roberts and John Roberts, \\"those critics who expressed appreciation for Crashaw's poetry were primarily impressed not with its thought, but with its music and what they called 'tenderness and sweetness of language'\\"‚Äîincluding a roster of writers such as Samuel Taylor Coleridge, William Wordsworth, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry Wadsworth Longfellow, Amy Lowell, and A. Bronson Alcott.Lorraine M. Roberts and John R. Roberts, \\"Crashavian Criticism: A Brief Interpretative History\\", New perspectives on the life and art of Richard Crashaw, edited by John R. Roberts (Columbia, MO: University of Missouri Press, 1990), 1‚Äì11. During and after his life, friends and poets esteemed Crashaw as a saint‚ÄîAbraham Cowley called him such in his elegy \\"On the Death of Mr. Crashaw\\" (1656);Abraham Cowley, \\"On the Death of Mr. Crashaw\\" from Poems: Viz I, II.

In the Years 1705 &c.; to 1717 (London: printed for J. Roberts, 1735), 145-48. Pope first identified the influence of Italian poets Petrarch and Marino on Crashaw, which he criticised as yielding thoughts \\"oftentimes far fetch'd and strain'd\\", but that one could \\"skim off the froth\\" to get to Crashaw's \\"own natural middle-way\\". However, contemporary critics were quick to point out that Pope owed Crashaw a debt and in several instances, plagiarised from him.Henry Headley, Select Beauties of Ancient English Poetry (London: Printed for T. Cadell, 1787); Robert Anderson, \\"The Poetical Works of Richard Crashaw\\", A Complete Edition of the Poets of Great Britain (Edinburgh: Mundell and Sons, 1793), 4:699-754. In 1785 Peregrine Philips disparaged those who borrowed from and imitated Crashaw without giving proper acknowledgement‚Äîsingling out Pope, Milton, Young, and Gray‚Äîsaying that they \\"dress themselves in his borrowed robes\\"Peregrine Philips (editor), Poetry by Richard Crashaw, with Some Account of the Author, and an Introductory Address to the Reader (London: Printed by Rickaby for the Editor, 1785) Early 20th- century literary critic Austin Warren identified that Pope's The Rape of the Lock borrowed heavily from Crashaw's style and translation of Sospetto d'Herode.Austin Warren, \\"The Reputation of Crashaw in the Seventeenth and Eighteenth Centuries,\\" Studies in Philology, 31 (1934): 396, at 403. In a 1751 edition of in The Rambler, critic Samuel Johnson called attention to a direct example of Pope's plagiaristic borrowing from Crashaw:Samuel Johnson, \\"The Criterions of Plagiarism\\", The Rambler No. 143, 30 July 1751; in The Works of Samuel Johnson in Sixteen Volumes (Troy, NY: Pafraets, 1903), 3:198.

The festival anthem Lo, the full, final sacrifice, Op. 26, composed in 1946 by British composer Gerald Finzi (1901‚Äì1956) is a setting of two Crashaw poems, \\"Adoro Te\\" and \\"Lauda Sion Salvatorem\\"‚Äîtranslations by Crashaw of two Latin hymns by Thomas Aquinas (c. 1225-1274). \\"Come and let us live\\", a translation by Crashaw of a poem by Roman poet Catullus (84‚Äì54 BC), was set to music as a four-part choral glee by Samuel Webbe, Jr. (1770‚Äì1843).

(2 July 1864 - 13 October 1927) was an Anglo-French journalist and writer. He was also a diplomat (honorary consul for San Marino), a traveller (in Europe, the Balkans and North Africa), a flying buff who officiated at the first British air meeting at Doncaster in 1909, and a wireless pioneer who broadcast music from his own station long before radio was generally available; his claims regarding his own abilities and exploits, however, were usually exaggerated. His best-known works are the anti-French and anti-Russian invasion fantasy The Great War in England in 1897 (1894) and the anti-German invasion fantasy The Invasion of 1910 (1906), the latter becoming a bestseller. Early life Le Queux was born in London. His father was a French draper's assistant and his mother was English. He was educated in Europe and studied art under Ignazio (or Ignace) Spiridon (Spiridon, Spyridon, and Spridion are different renderings of the same Greek name.) in Paris. He carried out a foot tour of Europe as a young man before supporting himself writing for French newspapers. In the late 1880s he returned to London where he edited the magazines Gossip and Piccadilly before joining the staff of The Globe as a parliamentary reporter in 1891. In 1893 he abandoned journalism to concentrate on writing and travelling. His partial French ancestry did not prevent him from depicting France and the French as the villains in works of the 1890s, though later he assigned this role to Germany. Career Cover of Zoraida, signed lower left by another flying buff, Harold H. Piffard Le Queux mainly wrote in the genres of mystery, thriller, and espionage, particularly in the years leading up to World War I, when his partnership with British publishing magnate Lord Northcliffe led to the serialised publication and intensive publicising (including actors dressed as German soldiers walking along Regent Street) of pulp-fiction spy stories and invasion literature such as The Invasion of 1910, The Poisoned Bullet, and Spies of the Kaiser. These works were a common phenomenon in pre-World War I Europe, involving fictionalised stories of possible invasion or infiltration by foreign powers; Le Queux's specialty, much appreciated by Northcliffe, was the German invasion of Britain. He was also the original editor of Northcliffe's War of the Nations. =The Invasion of 1910= The Invasion of 1910, which originally appeared in serial form in the Daily Mail newspaper from 19 March 1906, was a huge success. The newspaper's circulation increased greatly, and it made a small fortune for Le Queux, eventually being translated into twenty-seven languages and selling over one million copies in book form. The idea for the novel is alleged to have originated from Field Marshal Earl Roberts, who regularly lectured English schoolboys on the need to prepare for war. Le Queux was reportedly less than happy about an abridged German translation (with an altered ending) appeared the same year: Die Invasion von 1910: Einfall der Deutschen in England translated by Traugott Tamm. =World War I= At the beginning of World War I Le Queux became convinced that the Germans were out to get him for \\"rumbling their schemes\\" and from then on became involved in a continual struggle with his local police force and the Metropolitan Police over his request for special protection from German agents. The authorities, however, in the words of Edward Henry (head of the Metropolitan Police) saw him as \\"not a person to be taken seriously\\" and saw no need to fulfill his request. =Radio work= Le Queux was interested in radio communication; he was a member of the Institute of Radio Engineers and carried out some radio experiments in 1924 in Switzerland with Dr. Petit Pierre and Max Amstutz. That same year he was elected the first President of the Hastings, St. Leonard's and District Radio Society, whose inaugural lecture was delivered on 28 April 1924 by John Logie Baird. Le Queux was eager to help Baird with his television experiments but said that all his money was tied up in Switzerland. He did however write an article, Television-a fact which appeared in the Radio Times in April 1924 which praised Baird's efforts. =Other work= Apart from fiction, Le Queux also wrote extensively on wireless broadcasting, produced various travel works including An Observer in the Near East and several short books on Switzerland, and wrote an unrevealing and often misleading autobiography, Things I Know about Kings, Celebrities and Crooks (1923). The latter contains, among other fantastic stories, the claim by Le Queux that he saw a manuscript in French written by Rasputin stating that Jack the Ripper was a Russian doctor named Alexander Pedachenko who committed the murders to confuse and ridicule Scotland Yard. Bibliography Le Queux wrote 150 novels dealing with international intrigue, as well as books warning of Britain's vulnerability to European invasion before World War I: =Novels and stories= * Guilty Bonds (1891) * Strange Tales of a Nihilist (1892) * The Great War in England in 1897 (1894) * Zoraida (1894) * Guilty (1895) * The Temptress (1895) * The Great White Queen.

Life and career Muzenda was born in the Gutu District of the Victoria Province of Southern Rhodesia as a son of a peasant farmer, and brought up by his grandmother Mbuya Maweni, who ensured his regular attendance for his primary education at Nyamandi Primary School. A relatively bright child, he was sent for teacher training after spending his teenage years herding the family's cattle with his close friend and advisor Edward 'Jaben' Mushandu in Makonese Village under Chief Nyamandi, and, following the advice of his tutor, travelled to the Marianhill mission in Natal, South Africa, where he showed proficiency in carpentry. Between completing his carpentry course and furthering his studies, Muzenda became aware of politics during contacts with fellow students, which included several men prominent in black activism South Africa and Rhodesia; after his return to Rhodesia in 1950, he worked in a furniture factory in Bulawayo and became involved with Benjamin Burombo, an activist who was among the earliest to challenge discriminatory laws. After marrying his wife Maud, a nurse, Muzenda moved to the Midlands town of Mvuma in 1955 and started his own carpentry business; he also stayed active in political activism and eventually become administrative secretary of the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU), attracting the attention of Rhodesian security forces and being imprisoned in Salisbury Central Prison for two years, which he described as a \\"place of study\\" later in his life, as it gave him and his fellow inmates the opportunity to complete their educations. In 1964, he was arrested again, this time for possession of a pistol after having been elected deputy organising secretary of ZANU; at this time, Muzenda had become convinced that the only way to overthrow white colonial dominance was an armed revolution, and began organising young blacks to receive military training in other African countries, in the Soviet Union and in China. He was soon imprisoned again and remained in jail until being released under the Anglo-Rhodesia agreement in 1971. Following his release, Simon Muzenda went into exile in Zambia, and later in Mozambique. Failing to draw Joshua Nkomo and his ZAPU movement into a unified political front, he backed Robert Mugabe, who was then also hiding in Mozambique, as the leader of the ZANU Patriotic Front (PF). After the ensuing guerilla war, which ended with the Lancaster House Agreement, and a brief interregnum of British government while new elections were organised, Mugabe was elected as the first prime minister of the new independent Zimbabwe and made Muzenda the deputy prime minister and foreign minister in 1980; Muzenda also retained political power over his home area. In 1987, when Mugabe became executive president, Muzenda was appointed as his vice-president. In Zimbabwe's early years, Muzenda was generally respected by the people as a no-nonsense, plain-spoken man from the working class, but in later years, he appeared more and more crude. In 1990, his campaign for a seat in Zimbabwe's parliament suffered a blow after opposition candidate Patrick Kombayi was shot and left permanently disabled; two state agents were convicted of attempted murder, but pardoned by Mugabe shortly after the trial ended, and even though Muzenda was not publicly accused of being involved in the shooting, it affected his standing with the public. During the years of Mugabe's rule, Muzenda always gave unreserved backing to the president, even when the regime began muzzling the independent press, curb the activities of foreign correspondents and crushing political opposition. He also participated in Mugabe's land redistribution programme, taking over the Chindito farm, south of Harare, in April 2002 and ejecting the white farm owner, Chris Nel; this incident caused a controversy with the Commercial Farmers Union.\\"Mugabe's right-hand man grabs white farm\\", Sapa, 26 April 2002. Death In the two years preceding his death, Muzenda was in failing health, with problems including hypertension and diabetes; after returning from medical treatment in China in July 2003, he was admitted to the coronary care unit of Harare's main government facility, the Parirenyatwa Hospital, where, according to medical sources, he fell into a semi-conscious state. Two weeks before his death, Zimbabwe's state-owned media dismissed reports that he was in declining health, instead announcing that he was making \\"remarkable progress\\" towards a full recovery. Muzenda died on 20 September 2003; he was 80 years old. He was survived by a wife and six children. He had a State funeral, and he is buried at the National Heroes Acre.

Formerly known as Hasle Jungfrau, it is one of three summits on a mountain named the \\"Wetterh√∂rner\\", the highest of which is the Mittelhorn (3,704 m) and the lowest and most distant the Rosenhorn (3,689 m). The latter peaks are mostly hidden from view from Grindelwald. The Grosse Scheidegg Pass crosses the col to the north, between the Wetterhorn and the Schwarzhorn. Ascents The Wetterhorn summit was first reached on August 31, 1844, by the Grindelwald guides Hans Jaun and Melchior Bannholzer, three days after they had co-guided a large party organized by the geologist √âdouard Desor to the first ascent of the Rosenhorn. The Mittelhorn was first summitted on 9 July 1845 by the same guides, this time accompanied by a third, Kaspar Abplanalp, and by British climber Stanhope Templeman Speer. The son of a Scottish physician, Speer lived in Interlaken, Switzerland. Chromolithograph Christmas card, of the Wetterhorn, seen from the Little Scheideck, by Helga von Cramm, c. 1880 Joseph Anton Koch, The Wetterhorn with the Reichenbachtal, 1824 A September 1854 summit by a party which included Alfred Wills, who apparently believed he'd made the first ascent, is much celebrated in Great Britain. Wills' description of this trip in his book \\"Wanderings Among the High Alps\\" (published in 1856) helped make mountaineering fashionable in Britain and ushered in the so-called golden age of alpinism, the systematic exploration of the Alps by British mountaineers. Despite several by then well- documented earlier ascents and the fact that he was guided to the top, Willis was lauded in his 1912 obituary as \\"Certainly the first who can be said with any confidence to have stood upon the real highest peak of the Wetterhorn proper\\" (i.e. the 3,692 m summit)In memoriam. Rt. Hon. Sir Alfred Wills, The Alpine Journal 27, 1912, pp. 47- In a subsequent corrigendum, the editors admitted two earlier ascents, but considered his still \\"the first completely successful\\" one.Addenda and Corrigenda: The Wetterhorn, The Alpine Journal 27, 1912, p. 235 In 1866, Lucy Walker was the first documented female to summit the peak. The 24-year-old English mountaineer William Penhall and his Meiringen guide Andreas Maurer were killed by an avalanche high up on the Wetterhorn on 3 August 1882. The famed guide and Grindelwald native Christian Almer climbed the mountain many times in his life, including on his first of many trips with Meta Brevoort and her nephew W. A. B. Coolidge in 1868. His last ascent was in 1898 at the age of 72 together with his wife to celebrate their golden anniversary on the summit. Winston Churchill climbed the Wetterhorn in 1894. Aerial tramway The Wetterhorn summit was the intended terminal for the world's first passenger carrying aerial tramway, but only the first quarter was built. It was in operation until the beginning of World War I.

Mago was the third son of Hamilcar Barca, was the brother of Hannibal and Hasdrubal, and was the brother-in-law of Hasdrubal the Fair. Little is known about his early years, except that, unlike his brothers, he is not mentioned during the ambush in which his father was killed in 228 BC. Name The name Mago was a common masculine given name among the Carthaginian elite. It meant \\"Godsent\\". The cognomen or epithet means \\"thunderbolt\\" or \\"shining\\". It is cognate with the Arabic name Barq and the Hebrew name Barak and equivalent to the Greek Keraunos, which was borne by contemporary commanders.S. Lancel, Hannibal p. 6. It had been used for Mago's father Hamilcar and is used to distinguish his three sons from others who shared their names. On the Italian Peninsula Carthaginian shekel, dated 237‚Äì227 BC, depicting the Punic god Melqart (equivalent of Hercules/Heracles), most likely with the features of Hamilcar Barca, father of Hannibal Barca; on the reverse is a man riding a war elephant Hannibal included Mago among the Carthaginian officers who accompanied him to the Italian Peninsula. Among them were Maharbal, Hanno the Elder, Muttines (, ), and Carthalo. Mago fought at the side of Hannibal in the invasion of Italy, and played a key role in many battles. At the Battle of the Trebia, he commanded the detachment that ambushed the Romans, breaking down their battle array. After the battle, Mago commanded the rearguard of the Carthaginian column as it marched south towards Latium through the marshes of Aino. In the Battle of Cannae, Mago and Hannibal took position with the Gallic infantry at the center, in the most vulnerable and crucial position of the formation. After the victory of Cannae, Hannibal sent Mago with a detachment to Bruttium (southern Italy). While marching through Lucania and Bruttium, Mago subdued several towns and brought over several to the Carthaginian side. From Bruttium, Mago sailed to Carthage, leaving Hanno the Elder in command of the Carthaginian garrison. Mago presented the golden rings of Roman equites fallen at Cannae to the Carthaginian Senate, requesting reinforcements for Hannibal at the end of his speech. This prompted the supporters of the Barcid party in the Senate to taunt their opponents, who had bitterly opposed any aid to Hannibal. In response, Hanno the Great, leading opponent of the Barcids, placed several questions to Mago, which took most of the gloss off Mago's presentation. Still, the Senate members were impressed enough to vote the raising of an army, made up of 12,000 infantry, 1,500 cavalry and 20 elephants, as reinforcements for Hannibal. However, when the news of the disastrous Battle of Dertosa reached Carthage, Mago and his army were sent to Hispania (the Iberian Peninsula) as reinforcements for Hasdrubal instead. But the Carthaginian Senate did not entirely ignore the Italian front for once. A force of 4,000 Numidian cavalry and 40 elephants was sent to Locri in Bruttium, escorted by the Punic fleet under Bomilcar.Livy 22.32 These were the only significant reinforcements Hannibal was to receive from his government. Iberian campaigns Although Hasdrubal nominally commanded all Carthaginian forces in the Iberian Peninsula (the Roman Hispania), Mago received an independent command, a division that was to have grave consequences later. The two Barca brothers, aided by Hasdrubal Gisco, battled the Romans under the command of the Scipio brothers (Gnaeus Cornelius Scipio Calvus and Publius Cornelius Scipio) throughout 215-212 BC. Mago, in a cavalry ambush of Publius Cornelius Scipio, killed 2,000 Romans near Akra Leuke in 214 BC, and also aided in keeping the Hispanic tribes loyal to Carthage. On the whole, the Carthaginians managed to maintain the balance of power in Hispania despite the efforts of the Scipios, but failed to send any aid to Hannibal. The situation was favorable enough, as in 212 BC Hasdrubal managed to cross over to Africa with an army to crush the rebellion of Syphax, king of Numidian tribes, without the Scipios causing any disruptions in Hispania. Mago and Hasdrubal Gisco guarded the Carthaginian possessions in Iberia without difficulty, despite the Scipios outnumbering their armies during the absence of Hasdrubal. The Scipio brothers launched a major offensive in 211 BC. The Carthaginian armies were separated, Hasdrubal Gisco being near Gades (modern C√°diz) with 10,000 troops, Mago near Castulo with another 10,000, and Hasdrubal with 15,000 soldiers near Amtorgis. The Scipios planned to confront the Carthaginians simultaneously and comprehensively destroy their armies. The coordination of the three Carthaginian armies was crucial in defeating and killing the Scipio brothers and destroying most of the Roman forces in Hispania in the battles that followed. The Scipios had split their army‚ÄîPublius Scipio marching west with 20,000 soldiers to attack Mago near Castulo, while Gnaeus Scipio took 35,000 to attack Hasdrubal. Hasdrubal Gisco's force marched to join Mago who, aided by Indibilis and Masinissa, defeated and killed Publius Scipio, then with the combined armies joined Hasdrubal to defeat and kill Gnaeus Scipio, all in a span of 23 days. However, the lack of coordination after the battle led to the escape of the Roman survivors, about 8,000 men, to the north of the Ebro river. These men checked Carthaginian attacks twice, and were reinforced by 20,000 troops from Italy in 210 BC. Publius Cornelius Scipio the Younger, exploiting the lack of coordination between the Carthaginian generals, and the scattered location of their armies, ended up taking Cartagena in a daring expedition in 209 BC. Mago and his army was three days' march from Cartagena at that time. The Carthaginians moved their base to Gades. In 208 BC, after the Battle of Baecula, Hasdrubal left Hispania to invade Italy and bring reinforcements to his brother Hannibal, who was operating in Lucania. Mago moved with his army to the area between the Tagus and Douro rivers in a recruiting mission of Spanish mercenaries with Hanno, a newly arrived general. Their mission was successful, as they gathered large masses of Spanish fighters, among them Cantabrians led by Larus, but they divided the army into two camps and relaxed their vigilance. Their army was surprised and scattered by Roman forces commanded by Marcus Junius Silanus in 207 BC; Hanno was captured, but Mago managed to lead a few thousand survivors to Gades, where he joined forces with Hasdrubal Gisco.Moore, Frank Gardner (transl.) Livy: Ab Urbe Condita, vol. VIII, bk. xxviii Loeb Classical Edn, pp. 3‚Äì9, at openlibrary.org The Carthaginians dispersed their army in several towns and focused on recruiting new mercenaries. This tactic frustrated the strategy of Scipio to force a decisive battle that year. Mago enjoyed joint command of the new army and raided the Roman army with his cavalry. The foresight of Scipio Africanus, who had kept his cavalry outside camp in a hidden position, led to the defeat of this raid. After suffering defeat at the Battle of Ilipa in 206 BC, Hasdrubal Gisco returned to Africa and Mago retreated to Gades with the remnants of his army. His deputy, another Hanno, was defeated by L. Marcius at the Battle of the Guadalquivir, and Mago was unable to take advantage of the rebellion of Hispanic tribes under Indibilis or the mutiny of the Roman troops at Sucro in 206 BC. He led an assault on Cartagena, believing the city to be lightly held, and was beaten back with severe losses. On returning, he found the gates of Gades barred. After crucifying the city magistrates for treason, he sailed away to the Balearic Islands. Third Carthaginian expedition to Italy Mago then led a campaign to invade Italy (this time by sea) with 15,000 men in early summer of 205 BC. The army sailed from Menorca to Liguria under the escort of 30 Carthaginian quinqueremes. Mago managed to capture Genoa, and he held control of Northern Italy for nearly three years, warring with the mountain tribes and gathering troops. The Romans devoted seven legions to maintain watch over him and guard Northern Italy, but no general action was fought. In 204 BC, Mago was reinforced with 6,000 infantry and some cavalry from Carthage. The Romans refused to give battle and blocked Mago, preventing him from reaching Hannibal. Finally, the Romans engaged him in battle in Cisalpine Gaul. The Battle of Insubria was an indecisive Roman victory, but Mago was severely wounded. Soon after the battle, he was recalled back to Carthage along with Hannibal to aid in its defence, as the future Scipio Africanus major had shattered the armies of Hasdrubal Gisco, Hanno, son of Bomilcar, and had captured Syphax, who was allied to Carthage, in Africa. Mago and his army sailed from Italy in 202 BC under the escort of the Punic fleet, and was unmolested by the Roman navy as he made for Africa. Before arriving in Carthage, however, he died of his wound at sea. According to Cornelius Nepos, however, Mago survived the war and stayed with his brother Hannibal for several years, until the Carthaginians ordered his arrest around 193 BC. He managed to escape, but either died in a shipwreck or was killed by his slaves. Most historians, however, give little credit to Nepos and prefer Livy's version.Cornelius Nepos, Hannibal, 7 and 8. The ability of Mago as a field commander can be glimpsed from his actions at the battles of Trebbia and Cannae, where his failure might have doomed the Carthaginian army. He was a capable cavalry leader, as his repeated ambushes of the Romans in Iberia and Italy demonstrate. Legacy The Port of Mah√≥n in the Balearics was allegedly founded by him and still bears his name. The local egg sauce that is now consumed all over the world is called mayonnaise after the city.

The word cormous usually means plants that grow from corms, parallel to the terms tuberous and bulbous to describe plants growing from tubers and bulbs. Structure Crocosmia corm with the tunic partly stripped to show its origin at the nodes on the corm cortex Crocosmia corm anatomy, showing tunic, cortex of storage tissue, central medulla, and emergence of a new corm from a bud near the top. Crocosmia corm with stolons emerging through the tunic. The stolons originate at the axillary buds of the corm scales, and generally produce new corms at their tips A corm consists of one or more internodes with at least one growing point, generally with protective leaves modified into skins or tunics. The tunic of a corm forms from dead petiole sheaths‚Äîremnants of leaves produced in previous years. They act as a covering, protecting the corm from insects, digging animals, flooding, and water loss. The tunics of some species are thin, dry, and papery, at least in young plants, however, in some families, such as Iridaceae, the tunic of a mature corm can be formidable protection. For example, some of the larger species of Watsonia accumulate thick, rot- resistant tunics over a period of years, producing a structure of tough, reticulated fibre. Other species, such as many in the genus Lapeirousia, have tunics of hard, woody layers.Dyer, R. Allen, The Genera of Southern African Flowering Plants. , 1975 Internally, a typical corm mostly consists of parenchyma cells, rich in starch, above a circular basal node from which roots grow. Long-lived cormous plants vary in their long-term development. Some regularly replace their older corms with a stack of younger corms, increased more or less seasonally. By splitting such a stack before the older corm generations wither too badly, the horticulturist can exploit the individual corms for propagation. Other species seldom do anything of that kind; their corms simply grow larger in most seasons. Yet others split when multiple buds or stolons on a large corm sprout independently, forming a tussock. Corms can be dug up and used to propagate or redistribute the plant (see, for example, taro). Plants with corms generally can be propagated by cutting the corms into sections and replanting. Suitably treated, each section with at least one bud usually can generate a new corm. = Comparison to bulbs = Corms are sometimes confused with true bulbs; they are often similar in appearance to bulbs externally, and thus erroneously called bulbs. Corms are stems that are internally structured with solid tissues, which distinguishes them from bulbs, which are mostly made up of layered fleshy scales that are modified leaves. As a result, a corm cut in half appears solid inside, but a true bulb cut in half reveals that it is made up of layers. Corms are structurally plant stems, with nodes and internodes with buds and produce adventitious roots. On the top of the corm, one or a few buds grow into shoots that produce normal leaves and flowers. Gladiolus corm, showing the formation of small cormels at the ends of short stolons  Cormels  Corms can form many small cormlets called cormels, from the basal areas of the new growing corms, especially when the main growing point is damaged. These propagate corm-forming plants. A number of species replace corms every year by growing a new corm. This process starts after the shoot develops fully expanded leaves. The new corm forms at the shoot base just above the old corm. As the new corm grows, short stolons appear that end with the newly growing small cormels. As the plants grow and flower, they use up the old corm, which shrivels away. The new corm that replaces the old corm grows in size, especially after flowering ends. The old corm produces the greatest number of cormels when close to the soil surface. Small cormels normally take one or two more years of growth before they are large enough to flower. Cormels do have a reproductive function, but in the wild they also are important as a survival strategy. In most places where geophytes are common, so are animals that feed on them, whether from above like pigs, or from below like bulb weevils, mole rats, or pocket gophers. Such animals eat through protective tunics, but they generally miss several cormels that remain in the soil to replace the consumed plant. Plants such as Homeria, Watsonia and Gladiolus, genera that are vulnerable to such animals, are probably the ones that produce cormels in the greatest numbers and most widely distributed over the plant. Homeria species produce bunches of cormels on underground stem nodes, and Watsonia meriana for example actually produces cormels profusely from under bracts on the inflorescences.  Roots  Many corms produce two different types of roots. Those growing from the bottom of the corm are normal fibrous roots, they are formed as the shoots grow, and are produced from the basal area at the bottom of the corm. The second type of roots are thicker layered roots that form as the new corms are growing, they are called contractile roots and they pull the corm deeper into the soil. In some species contractile roots are produced in response to fluctuating soil temperatures and light levels. In such species, once the corm is deep enough within the soil where the temperature is more uniform and there is no light, the contractile roots no longer grow and the corm is no longer pulled deeper into the soil. In some other species however, contractile roots seem to be a defence against digging animals and can bury the corm surprisingly deeply over the years. Wurmbea marginata is one example of a small plant that can be challenging to dig unharmed out of a hard, clayey hillside.

Kircher's fanciful method of translation is displayed in this attempt to produce a panegyric to his patron Ferdinand III in Egyptian. In Kircher's reading, the Eye of Horus and a glyph depicting a chessboard (the syllable mn) are interpreted as \\"instrument of divine providence, eye of the political universe\\". (divinae providentiae instrumentum, politici Universi oculus) Oedipus Aegyptiacus is Athanasius Kircher's supreme work of Egyptology. The three full folio tomes of ornate illustrations and diagrams were published in Rome over the period 1652‚Äì54. Kircher cited as his sources Chaldean astrology, Hebrew kabbalah, Greek myth, Pythagorean mathematics, Arabian alchemy and Latin philology. Hieroglyphs The third volume of Oedipus Aegyptiacus deals exclusively with Kircher's attempts to translate Egyptian hieroglyphs. The primary source for Kircher's study of hieroglyphs was the Bembine Tablet, so named after its acquisition by Cardinal Bembo, shortly after the sack of Rome in 1527. The Bembine Tablet is a bronze and silver tablet depicting various Egyptian gods and goddesses. In its centre sits Isis representing \\"the polymorphic all-containing Universal Idea.\\" Kircher's Oedipus Aegyptiacus is an example of syncretic and eclectic scholarship in the late Renaissance and representative of antiquarian scholarship before the modern scientific era. His renditions of hieroglyphic texts tended to be wordy and portentous; for example, he translated a frequently occurring phrase in Egyptian, _d_ d W _s_ r, \\"Osiris says,\\" as \\"The treachery of Typhon ends at the throne of Isis, the moisture of nature is guarded by the vigilance of Anubis.\\" Kircher was respected in the seventeenth century for his study of Egyptian hieroglyphs; his contemporary Sir Thomas Browne (1605‚Äì1682) who owned several books by Kircher, including Oedipus Aegyptiacus, paid tribute to him as an Egyptologist and his study of hieroglyphs: On the other hand, modern experts on hieroglyphic writing have found Kircher's work to be of little value. According to E. A. Wallis Budge: The accurate meaning of Egyptian hieroglyphs were not deciphered until 1824 when Jean-Fran√ßois Champollion finally solved the riddle through his study of the Rosetta stone. In 1999 the University of Geneva exhibited one of the vast tomes of Oedipus Aegyptiacus in an exhibition to celebrate the centenary of Jorge Luis Borges as representative of books associated with the Argentinian author.

He was one of the leading English poets of the 17th century, with 14 printings of his Works published between 1668 and 1721.Oxford Dictionary of National Biography \\"Abraham Cowley\\" Early life and career Cowley's father, a wealthy citizen, who died shortly before his birth, was a stationer. His mother was wholly given to works of devotion, but it happened that there lay in her parlour a copy of The Faerie Queene. This became the favourite reading of her son, and he had read it twice before he was sent to school. As early as 1628, that is, in his tenth year, he composed his Tragicall History of Piramus and Thisbe, an epic romance written in a six- line stanza, a style of his own invention. It is not too much to say that this work is the most astonishing feat of imaginative precocity on record; it is marked by no great faults of immaturity, and possesses constructive merits of a very high order. Two years later the child wrote another and still more ambitious poem, Constantia and Philetus, being sent about the same time to Westminster School. Here he displayed extraordinary mental precocity and versatility, and wrote in his thirteenth year the Elegy on the Death of Dudley, Lord Carlton. These three poems of considerable size, and some smaller ones, were collected in 1633, and published in a volume entitled Poetical Blossoms, dedicated to Lambert Osbaldeston, the head master of the school, and prefaced by many laudatory verses by schoolfellows. The author at once became famous, although he had not, even yet, completed his fifteenth year. His next composition was a pastoral comedy, entitled Love's Riddle, a marvelous production for a boy of sixteen, airy, correct and harmonious in language, and rapid in movement. The style is not without resemblance to that of Randolph, whose earliest works, however, were at that time only just printed. In 1637 Cowley went up to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he \\"betook himself with enthusiasm to the study of all kinds of learning, and early distinguished himself as a ripe scholar\\". Portraits of Cowley, attributed to William Faithorne and Stephen Slaughter, are in Trinity College's collection. It was about this time that he composed his scriptural epic on the history of King David, one book of which still exists in the Latin original, the rest being superseded in favour of an English version in four books, called the Davideis, which were published after his death. The epic deals with the adventures of King David from his boyhood to the smiting of Amalek by Saul, where it abruptly closes. Abraham Cowley In 1638 Love's Riddle and a Latin comedy, the Naufragium Joculare, were printed, and in 1641 the passage of Prince Charles through Cambridge gave occasion to the production of another dramatic work, The Guardian, which was acted before the royal visitor with much success. During the civil war this play was privately performed at Dublin, but it was not printed till 1650. It is bright and amusing, in the style common to the \\"sons\\" of Ben Jonson, the university wits who wrote more for the closet than the public stage. Royalist in exile The learned quiet of the young poet's life was broken up by the Civil War; he warmly espoused the royalist side. He became a fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge, but was ejected by the Parliamentarians in 1643. He made his way to Oxford, where he enjoyed the friendship of Lord Falkland, and was tossed, in the tumult of affairs, into the personal confidence of the royal family itself. After the battle of Marston Moor he followed the queen to Paris, and the exile so commenced lasted twelve years. This period was spent almost entirely in the royal service, \\"bearing a share in the distresses of the royal family, or labouring in their affairs. To this purpose he performed several dangerous journeys into Jersey, Scotland, Flanders, the Netherlands, or wherever else the king's troubles required his attendance. But the chief testimony of his fidelity was the laborious service he underwent in maintaining the constant correspondence between the late king and the queen his wife. In that weighty trust he behaved himself with indefatigable integrity and unsuspected secrecy; for he ciphered and deciphered with his own hand the greatest part of all the letters that passed between their majesties, and managed a vast intelligence in many other parts, which for some years together took up all his days, and two or three nights every week.\\" In spite of these labours he did not refrain from literary industry. During his exile he met with the works of Pindar, and determined to reproduce their lofty lyric passion in English. However, Cowley misunderstood Pindar's metrical practice and therefore his reproduction of the Pindaric Ode form in English does not accurately reflect Pindar's poetics. But despite this problem, Cowley's use of iambic lines of irregular length, pattern, and rhyme scheme was very influential and is still known as English \\"Pindarick\\" Ode, or Irregular Ode. One of the most famous odes written after Cowley in the Pindaric tradition is Wordsworth's \\"Ode: Intimations of Immortality\\". During this same time, Cowley occupied himself in writing a history of the Civil War (which did not get published in full until 1973). In the preface to his 1656 Poems, Cowley mentioned that he had completed three books of an epic poem on the Civil War, but had left it unfinished after the First Battle of Newbury when the Royalist cause began to lose significant ground. In the preface Cowley indicated that he had destroyed all copies of the poem, but this was not precisely the truth. In 1697, twelve years after Cowley's death, a shortened version of the first book of the poem, called A Poem on the Late Civil War was published. It was assumed that the rest of the poem had indeed been destroyed or lost until the mid-20th century when scholar Allan Pritchard discovered the first of two extant manuscript copies of the whole poem among the Cowper family papers. Thus, the three completed books of Cowley's great (albeit unfinished) English epic, The Civill Warre (otherwise spelled \\"The Civil War\\"), was finally published in full for the first time in 1973.Ed. Allan Pritchard. Abraham Cowley, The Civil War, Toronto,(UTPress: 1973) p.3 In 1647 a collection of his love verses, entitled The Mistress, was published, and in the next year a volume of wretched satires, The Four Ages of England, was brought out under his name, with the composition of which he had nothing to do. In spite of the troubles of the times, so fatal to poetic fame, his reputation steadily increased, and when, on his return to England in 1656, he published a volume of his collected poetical works, he found himself without a rival in public esteem. This volume included the later works already mentioned, the Pindarique Odes, the Davideis, the Mistress and some Miscellanies. Among the latter are to be found Cowley's most vital pieces. This section of his works opens with the famous aspiration: : \\"What shall I do to be for ever known, : And make the coming age my own?\\" It contains elegies on Wotton, Vandyck, Falkland, William Hervey and Crashaw, the last two being among Cowley's finest poems, brilliant, sonorous and original; the amusing ballad of The Chronicle, giving a fictitious catalogue of his supposed amours; various gnomic pieces; and some charming paraphrases from Anacreon. The Pindarique Odes contain weighty Lines and passages, buried in irregular and inharmonious masses of moral verbiage. Not more than one or two are good throughout, but a full posy of beauties may easily be culled from them. The long cadences of the Alexandrines with which most of the strophes close, continued to echo in English poetry from Dryden down to Gray, but the Odes themselves, which were found to be obscure by the poet's contemporaries, immediately fell into disesteem. The Mistress was the most popular poetic reading of the age, and is now the least read of all Cowley's works. It was the last and most violent expression of the amatory affectation of the 17th century, an affectation which had been endurable in Donne and other early writers because it had been the vehicle of sincere emotion, but was unendurable in Cowley because in him it represented nothing but a perfunctory exercise, a mere exhibition of literary calisthenics. He appears to have been of a cold, or at least of a timid, disposition; in the face of these elaborately erotic volumes, we are told that to the end of his days he never summoned up courage to speak of love to a single woman in real life. The \\"Leonora\\" of The Chronicle is said to have been the only woman he ever loved, and she married the brother of his biographer, Sprat. Return to England Soon after his return to England he was seized in mistake for another person, and only obtained his liberty on a bail of ¬£1000. In 1658 he revised and altered his play of The Guardian, and prepared it for the press under the title of The Cutter of Coleman Street, but it did not appear until 1661. Late in 1658 Oliver Cromwell died, and Cowley took advantage of the confusion of affairs to escape to Paris, where he remained until the Restoration brought him back in Charles's train. He published in 1663 Verses upon several occasions, in which The Complaint is included. He is also known for having provided the earliest reference to coca in English literature, in a poem called \\"A legend of coca\\" in his 1662 collection of poems Six Books of Plants.Peru. History of coca, \\"the divine plant\\" of the Incas; with an introductory account of the Incas, and of the Andean Indians of to-day. W. Golden Mortimer, M.D. Ed. J. H. Vail & Co, 1901. Abraham Cowley's poem \\"A Legend of Coca\\" : in chapter I An introduction to the history of coca, pp. 25‚Äì27. Abraham Cowley's Chertsey house Cowley obtained permission to retire into the country; and through his friend, Lord St Albans, he obtained a property near Chertsey, where, devoting himself to botany and books, he lived in comparative solitude until his death. He took a practical interest in experimental science, and he was one of those advocating the foundation of an academy for the protection of scientific enterprise. Cowley's pamphlet on The Advancement of Experimental Philosophy, 1661, immediately preceded the foundation of the Royal Society; to which Cowley, in March 1667, at the suggestion of John Evelyn, addressed an ode. He died in the Porch House, in Chertsey, in consequence of having caught a cold while superintending his farm-labourers in the meadows late on a summer evening. On 3 August, Cowley was buried in Westminster Abbey beside the ashes of Chaucer and Spenser, where in 1675 the Duke of Buckingham erected a monument to his memory. His Poemata Latina, including six books \\"Plantarum\\", were printed in 1668. The poetry of Cowley rapidly fell into neglect. Frontispice and titlepage to a 1678 edition of the collected works of Abraham Cowley The works of Cowley were collected in 1668, when Thomas Sprat brought out an edition in folio, to which he prefixed a life of the poet. There were many reprints of this collection, which formed the standard edition till 1881, when it was superseded by Alexander Balloch Grosart's privately printed edition in two volumes, for the Chertsey Worthies library. The Essays have frequently been revived. A Satire Against Separatists, printed in 1675, has been variously attributed to Cowley and to Peter Hausted.

He is best known for giving up an important home run to Boston Red Sox outfielder Dave Henderson in the 1986 American League Championship Series. He committed suicide shortly after his professional career ended. Early life Moore was born on February 13, 1954, in Lubbock, Texas, and was the cousin of MLB player Hubie Brooks. Moore attended Paris Junior College and Ranger College before he was selected by the Chicago Cubs in the first round of the January secondary phase of the 1973 Major League Baseball draft.  Playing career  In a 13-season career, Moore posted a 43‚Äì40 record with 89 saves, 416 strikeouts, and a 3.67 earned run average in 655 innings. Moore also compiled a .281 batting average with 11 runs batted in. He was selected as an All-Star in 1985 after developing a splitter with a slider and a breaking ball. Moore is most remembered for the home run he gave up to Dave Henderson while pitching for the California Angels in Game 5 of the 1986 American League Championship Series. With only one more strike needed to clinch the team's first-ever pennant, he allowed the Boston Red Sox to come back and eventually win the game. Boston then won Games 6 and 7 to take the series. = Game 5 of the 1986 American League Championship Series = The game took place on October 12, 1986 in Anaheim. The Angels held a 3‚Äì1 series lead against the Boston Red Sox. In the game, the Angels held a 5‚Äì2 lead going into the ninth inning. A home run by Boston's Don Baylor made it a 5‚Äì4 game. When Moore came in to pitch, there were two outs and Rich Gedman, who had been hit by a pitch, was on first base. The Angels were one strike away from advancing to the World Series for the first time in franchise history. Dave Henderson hit a 2‚Äì2 pitch off Moore for a home run to give the Red Sox a 6‚Äì5 lead. The Angels were able to score a run in the bottom of the ninth, pushing the game into extra innings. Moore remained in the game for the Angels; he was able to stifle a tenth inning Red Sox rally by getting Jim Rice to ground into a double play. Nonetheless, the Red Sox were able to score off Moore in the 11th inning via a sacrifice fly by Henderson. The Angels did not score in the bottom of the 11th, and lost the game 7‚Äì6. The defeat left the Angels with a 3‚Äì2 series advantage with two more games to play at Fenway Park. However, the Angels lost both games, by scores of 10‚Äì4 and 8‚Äì1. After Game 5, Moore admitted that he made a bad pitch to Henderson. \\"I was throwing fastballs and Henderson was fouling them off, so I went with the split-finger, thought maybe I'd catch him off guard, but it was right in his swing.\\"Ostler, Scott (October 13, 1986) \\"Moore Didn't Have Anywhere Near Enough\\" The Los Angeles Times, page 20 = Later career = Moore was battling injury at the time of the 1986 American League Championship Series and was never able to remain injury-free afterward. After saving nine more games in 41 appearances over the next two seasons, Moore was released by the Angels. He signed with the Kansas City Royals for the 1989 season, but played only in the minor leagues before being released in June of that year, ending his 14-year career in baseball.  Suicide  On July 18, 1989, Moore had an argument with his wife Tonya and shot her three times with a .45 pistol. The incident occurred at their Anaheim Hills home, with their three children in the house at the time. Tonya Moore and daughter Demetria, then 17 years of age, fled from the house and Demetria drove her mother to the hospital. Tonya survived the shooting. Back inside the house, still in the presence of at least one of his sons, Moore then put the gun to his head and committed suicide. He was 35.

Early life and family Thomas was born at Newnham, Northamptonshire, near Daventry, England to William (1572-1660) and Elizabeth Smith Randolph, daughter of Thomas Smith of Newnham. He was baptized on 18 June 1605. Thomas and Elizabeth had one daughter and three sons, including William, Robert, and Anntonette Randolph, who married George Dilliard. Around 1613 his mother died, shortly after giving birth to Randolph's sister. His father remarried about 1615 to Dorothy Lane West, the daughter of gentleman Richard Lane of Curteenhall and sister of Richard Lane (barrister). She was the widowed wife of Thomas West of Cotton End and mother of Richard West S.T.D. William and Dorothy were married two years after the family moved to a house in Little Houghton where his father was steward to Lord Zouche. They had three daughters and four sons. His half-brothers included Richard, Thomas, and Henry Randolph I (1623-1673), the first member of the Randolph family to emigrate to Colonial Virginia. He was the uncle of American colonist William Randolph. Education Randolph was admitted in 1618 as a King's Scholar to the College of St. Peter, better known as Westminster SchoolRICHEK, ROSLYN G. \\"THOMAS RANDOLPH (1605-1635): CHRISTIAN HUMANIST, ACADEMIC AND LONDON THEATER PLAYWRIGHT.\\" Order No. 8215916 The University of Oklahoma, 1982.

He was awarded his Bachelor of Arts degree in 1628, promoted to Master of Arts in 1631, and became a major fellow of his college in the same year. Prior to official publication, Randolph wrote several pieces before entering Westminster, including several epitaphs for people close to the family, the first written when he was 16 in the year 1621. While at Cambridge, he contributed what was probably his first official literary contribution: a poem that was included in a collection celebrating the marriage of King Charles to Princess Henrietta Maria. Around 1626, Thomas' first dramatic production was produced at Cambridge: Aristippus or The Jovial Philosopher. He also revived the tradition of Saltings at Cambridge and his Salting is one of the few that have survived to our day. The revival was repeated the following year by a student one year below Randolph: John Milton. Randolph continued writing throughout his educational career. Career He soon gave promise as a writer of comedy. Ben Jonson, not an easily satisfied critic, adopted him as one of his \\"sons.\\" He addressed three poems to Jonson, one on the occasion of Thomas's formal \\"adoption\\" as a Son of Ben, another on the failure of Jonson's The New Inn, and the third an eclogue, describing Thomas's own studies at Cambridge. Randolph was one of the most popular playwrights of his time and was expected to become Poet Laureate after Ben Jonson. It was his untimely death at age 29, two years before Jonson's death, that prevented this. After Cambridge, Randolph lived with his father at Little Houghton, Northamptonshire for some time, and afterwards with William Stafford of Blatherwycke Hall, where he died aged 29. He was buried in Blatherwycke church on 17 March 1635 and his epitaph was written by Peter Hausted, the author of The Rival Friends, on his monument, commissioned by Christopher Hatton, 1st Baron Hatton. Randolph's reputation as a wit is attested by the verses addressed to him by his contemporaries and by the stories attached to his name. His earliest printed work is Aristippus, Or, The Joviall Philosopher. Presented in a private shew, To which is added, The Conceited Pedlar (1630). It is a gay interlude burlesquing a lecture in philosophy, the whole piece being an argument to support the claims of sack against small beer. The Conceited Pedlar is an amusing monologue delivered by the pedlar, who defines himself as an \\"individuum vagum, or the primum mobile of tradesmen, a walking-burse or movable exchange, a Socratical citizen of the vast universe, or a peripatetical journeyman, that, like another Atlas, carries his heavenly shop on shoulders.\\" He then proceeds to display his wares with a running satirical comment. The drama, The Jealous Lovers, was presented by the students of Trinity College, Cambridge, before the king and queen in 1632. The Muse's Looking-Glass is hardly a drama. Roscius presents the extremes of virtue and vice in pairs, and last of all the \\"golden mediocrity\\" who announces herself as the mother of all the virtues. Amyntas, or The Impossible Dowry, a pastoral printed in 1638, with a number of miscellaneous Latin and English poems, completes the list of Randolph's authenticated work. Hey for Honesty, down with Knavery, a comedy, is doubtfully assigned to him. Randolph has been proposed as the author of the anonymous manuscript play, The Fairy Knight, though the attribution has not won much approval from critics. His works were edited by W. C. Hazlitt in 1875.

Having grown up trilingually, Artmann had an interest in language from an early age on; in 1947, his first publications appeared on radio and in the newspaper Neue Wege. He joined the Art-Club in 1951, and worked with Gerhard R√ºhm and Konrad Bayer from 1952 on. The same year, he also founded the so-called Wiener Gruppe of avantgarde poets, which he left in 1958. Starting in 1954, Artmann travelled Europe extensively; he stayed in Sweden from 1961 to 1965, living in Stockholm, Lund and Malm√∂, then went to live in Berlin until 1969, to settle down in Salzburg in 1972. As Ib Hansen he had sung at DMGP 1966 with the song \\"Lille Veninde\\" placing equal 3rd with 9 points. He was a founding member of the Anti P.E.N. club in 1973; later that year, he became and stayed president of the Grazer Autorenversammlung until leaving the organization in 1978. He earned several awards for his achievements in literature during his lifetime, including the Grand Austrian State Prize in 1974, the title of honorary doctor from the University of Salzburg in 1991 and the Georg-B√ºchner Preis for literature in 1997. Artmann wrote a number of humorous stories, including parodies of Dracula, (dracula dracula, 1966), Frankenstein, (Frankenstein in Sussex, 1969) Franz Rottensteiner, \\"Austria\\", in John Clute and John Grant, The Encyclopedia of Fantasy. London, Orbit, 1999\\\\. (pp. 74-75) and Hollywood fantasy films (\\"In the Gulf of Carpentaria\\").Mike Mitchell (editor), The Dedalus book of Austrian Fantasy: 1890-2000. Sawtry : Dedalus, 2002. (p.25) Artmann was a prolific translator; he rendered Edward Lear, Lars Gustafsson, Daisy Ashford and H.P. Lovecraft into German.Harriet Watts, H. C. Artmann and the Austrian Literary Renaissance, Tempo, New Series, No. 126 (Sep., 1978), pp. 3-8. He also translated one volume of the Asterix series into Viennese language, Da Legion√§a Asterix, which was released in 1999. H. C. Artmann (‚Ä†79) died from a heart attack on 4 December 2000 in Vienna. He was cremated at Feuerhalle Simmering, where his ashes are also buried.

Unlike descriptive knowledge (also known as \\"declarative knowledge\\" or \\"propositional knowledge\\" or \\"knowing-that\\"), which involves knowledge of specific facts or propositions (e.g. \\"I know that snow is white\\"), procedural knowledge involves one's ability to do something (e.g. \\"I know how to change a flat tire\\"). A person doesn't need to be able to verbally articulate their procedural knowledge in order for it to count as knowledge, since procedural knowledge requires only knowing how to correctly perform an action or exercise a skill. The term \\"procedural knowledge\\" has narrower but related technical uses in both cognitive psychology and intellectual property law, which are discussed below.  Overview  Procedural knowledge (i.e., knowledge-how) is different from descriptive knowledge (i.e., knowledge-that) in that it can be directly applied to a task. For instance, the procedural knowledge one uses to solve problems differs from the declarative knowledge one possesses about problem solving because this knowledge is formed by doing.Koedinger, K.R. & Corbett, A. (2006). Technology Bringing Learning Sciences to the Classroom. In Sawyer, R. K. (Ed.), The Cambridge Handbook of the Learning Sciences (61‚Äì75). New York: Cambridge University Press The distinction between knowing-how and knowing-that was brought to prominence in epistemology by Gilbert Ryle who used it in his book The Concept of Mind.  Technical uses of the phrase  = Artificial intelligence = In artificial intelligence, procedural knowledge is one type of knowledge that can be possessed by an intelligent agent. Such knowledge is often represented as a partial or complete finite- state machine or computer program. A well-known example is the procedural reasoning system, which might, in the case of a mobile robot that navigates in a building, contain procedures such as \\"navigate to a room\\" or \\"plan a path\\". In contrast, an AI system based on declarative knowledge might just contain a map of the building, together with information about the basic actions that can be done by the robot (like moving forward, turning, and stopping), and leave it to a domain-independent planning algorithm to discover how to use those actions to achieve the agent's goals. = Cognitive psychology = In cognitive psychology, procedural knowledge is the knowledge exercised in the accomplishment of a task, and thus includes knowledge which, unlike declarative knowledge, cannot be easily articulated by the individual, since it is typically nonconscious (or tacit). Many times, the individual learns procedural knowledge without even being aware that they are learning (Stadler,1989). For example, most individuals can easily recognize a specific face as \\"attractive\\" or a specific joke as \\"funny\\", but they cannot explain how exactly they arrived at that conclusion or they cannot provide a working definition of \\"attractiveness\\" or being \\"funny\\". This example illustrates the difference between procedural knowledge and the ordinary notion of knowing how, a distinction which is acknowledged by many cognitive psychologists (Stillings, et al. Cognitive Science: An Introduction, 2nd edition, Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1995, p. 396). Ordinarily, we would not say that one who is able to recognize a face as attractive is one who knows how to recognize a face as attractive. One knows how to recognize faces as attractive no more than one knows how to recognize certain arrangements of leptons, quarks, etc. as tables. Recognizing faces as attractive, like recognizing certain arrangements of leptons, quarks, etc. as tables, is simply something that one does, or is able to do. It is, therefore, an instance of procedural knowledge, but it is not an instance of know-how. Of course, both forms of knowledge are, in many cases, nonconscious. For instance, research by a cognitive psychologist Pawel Lewicki has demonstrated that procedural knowledge can be acquired by nonconscious processing of information about covariations. = Educational implications = In the classroom, procedural knowledge is part of the prior knowledge of a student. In the context of formal education procedural knowledge is what is learned about learning strategies. It can be the \\"tasks specific rules, skills, actions, and sequences of actions employed to reach goals\\" a student uses in the classroom (Cauley,1986). As an example for procedural knowledge Cauley refers to how a child learns to count on their hands and/or fingers when first learning math. The Unified Learning Model explicates that procedural knowledge helps make learning more efficient by reducing the cognitive load of the task. In some educational approaches, particularly when working with students with learning disabilities, educators perform a task analysis followed by explicit instruction with the steps needed to accomplish the task.Glaser, R., \\"Education and thinking: The role of knowledge\\", American Psychologist, 39(2): 93‚Äì104, 1984. One advantage of procedural knowledge is that it can involve more senses, such as hands-on experience, practice at solving problems, understanding of the limitations of a specific solution, etc. Thus procedural knowledge can frequently eclipse theory. One limitation of procedural knowledge is its job-dependent nature. As a result, it tends to be less general than declarative knowledge. For example, a computer expert might have knowledge about a computer algorithm in multiple languages, or in pseudo-code, but a Visual Basic programmer might know only about a specific implementation of that algorithm, written in Visual Basic. Thus the 'hands-on' expertise and experience of the Visual Basic programmer might be of commercial value only to Microsoft job-shops, for example. = Intellectual property law = In intellectual property law, procedural knowledge is a parcel of closely held information relating to industrial technology, sometimes also referred to as a trade secret which enables its user to derive commercial benefit from it. In some legal systems, such procedural knowledge has been considered the intellectual property of a company, and can be transferred when that company is purchased. It is a component of the intellectual property rights on its own merits in most legislations but most often accompanies the license to the right-of-use of patents or trademarks owned by the party releasing it for circumscribed use. Procedural knowledge is not however solely composed of secret information that is not in the public domain; it is a \\"bundled\\" parcel of secret and related non-secret information which would be novel to an expert in the field of its usage.

Biography He was born in Paris. His two brothers Salomon Reinach and Th√©odore Reinach would later be known in the field of archaeology. After studying at Lyc√©e Condorcet, he was called to the bar in 1887. He attracted the attention of L√©on Gambetta by writing articles on Balkan politics for the Revue bleue, and joined the staff of the Republique fran√ßaise. In Gambetta's grand minist√®re, Reinach was his secretary and tried to obtain a partial revision of the constitution and list proportional representation. In the R√©publique fran√ßaise he waged a steady war against General Boulanger, which resulted in three duels, one with Edmond Magnier and two with Paul D√©roul√®de. Between 1889 and 1898, he sat for the Chamber of Deputies for Digne. As a member of the army commission, reporter of the budgets of the ministries of the interior and of agriculture he brought forward bills for the better treatment of the insane, for the establishment of a colonial ministry, for the taxation of alcoholic beverages, and for the reparation of judicial errors. He advocated complete freedom of the theatre and the press, the abolition of public executions, and denounced political corruption of all kinds. However, Reinach is best known as the champion of Alfred Dreyfus. At the time of the original trial, he attempted to secure a public hearing of the case, and, in 1897, he allied himself with Auguste Scheurer-Kestner to demand its revision. He denounced in the Si√®cle the Henry forgery and Esterhazy's complicity. His articles in the Si√®cle aroused the fury of the anti-Dreyfus party, especially as Reinach was a Jew and was accused by some of taking up Dreyfus's defence on racial grounds. He lost his seat in the Chamber of Deputies and, having refused to fight Henri Rochefort, an anti-Dreyfus journalist, eventually brought an action for libel against the latter. Finally, Dreyfus was pardoned, Reinach wrote a history of the case that was completed in 1905. Henri Dutrait-Croyon's Joseph Reinach, historien (Paris: A. Sava√®te, 1905), a violent detailed rebuttal of Reinach's history that \\"became a bible for that anti-Semitic section of French public opinion convinced of the culpability of Dreyfus.\\"Evi Gkotzaridis, Revisionism in the Twentieth Century: A Bankrupt Concept or Permanent Practice? in The European Legacy, Vol. 13, No. 6, pp. 729‚Äì730, 2008. International Society for the Study of European Ideas In 1906, Reinach was re-elected for Digne. In that year, he became a member of the commission of the national archives, and the following year a member of the council on prisons. Reinach was a prolific writer on political subjects. He published three volumes on L√©on Gambetta in 1884 and also edited Gambetta's speeches. Joseph and his wife Henriette-Cl√©mentine had a son, Adolphe Reinach, born in 1887. Adolphe became an archaeologist and Egyptologist known mainly for his discovery of the Coptos Decrees. He was killed in the first month of the First World War, in August 1914.

Biography The brother of Joseph Reinach and Th√©odore Reinach, he was born at St Germain-en-Laye and educated at the √âcole normale sup√©rieure before joining the French school at Athens in 1879. He made valuable archaeological discoveries at Myrina near Smyrna in 1880-82, at Cyme in 1881, at Thasos, Imbros and Lesbos (1882), at Carthage and Meninx (1883‚Äì84), at Odessa (1893) and elsewhere. He received honours from the chief learned societies of Europe. In 1887 he obtained an appointment at the National Museum of Antiquities at Saint-Germain-en-Laye; in 1893 he became assistant curator, and in 1902 curator of the national museums. In 1903 he became joint editor of the \\"Revue arch√©ologique\\", and in the same year officer of the Legion of Honour. The lectures he delivered on art at the √âcole du Louvre in 1902-3 were published by him under the title of \\"Apollo : histoire g√©n√©rale des arts plastiques profess√©e en 1902-1903 √† l'√âcole du Louvre\\". These were translated into most European languages, and became a standard handbook on the subject. Publications Reinach's first published work was a translation of Arthur Schopenhauer's \\"Essay on Free Will\\" (\\"Essai sur le libre arbitre\\", 1877), which passed through many editions. His \\"Manuel de philologie classique\\" (1880-1884) was crowned by the French association for the study of Greek; his \\"Grammaire latine\\" (1886) received a prize from the Society of Secondary Education; \\"La N√©cropole de Myrina\\" (1887), written with Edmond Pottier, and \\"Antiquit√©s nationales\\" were crowned by the Academy of Inscriptions. He compiled an important \\"R√©pertoire de la statuaire grecque et romaine\\" (3 volumes, 1897‚Äì98); also \\"R√©pertoire de peintures du Moyen √¢ge et de la Renaissance 1280-1580\\" (1905, etc.); \\"R√©pertoire des vases peints grecs et √©trusques\\" (1900). In 1905 he began his \\"Cultes, mythes et religions\\"; and in 1909 he published a general sketch of the history of religions under the title of \\"Orpheus; histoire g√©n√©rale des religions\\" (translated into English and published as \\"Orpheus, a general history of religions\\"). He also translated from the English HC Lea's \\"History of the Inquisition\\" as \\"Histoire de l'Inquisition au Moyen-√¢ge\\". In 1936 his updated bibliography was published -- \\"Bibliographie de Salomon Reinach\\".Bibliographie de Salomon Reinach OCLC WorldCat It has been said his bibliography runs to 262 pages and includes more than ninety lengthy works and at least seven thousand articles.

On March 8, 1821, Isaac married Frances Anne Carey (1799‚Äì1873), daughter of Mathew Carey, the Philadelphia publisher whose business he ultimately took over. Mathew Carey, born in Ireland in 1760, came to the United States in 1784, escaping prosecution by the British government for his outspoken criticism of Britain's Irish policy. During a period of exile in Paris, Carey had met Benjamin Franklin, for whose print shop he worked. Carey and Isaac Lea's highly successful publishing house printed the works of Thomas Jefferson, Parson Weems, Walter Scott, James Fenimore Cooper, and the first quarto Bible of American manufacture (both the Douay version and the Authorized version). =Education= His bookplate Irish American theoretical mathematician Eugenius Nulty tutored both Henry Charles Lea and his elder brother the later, pioneer photographic chemist Mathew Carey Lea (called by family ‚ÄúCarey‚Äù) at their home in Philadelphia.The Biographical Encyclopedia of Pennsylvania of the Nineteenth Century Philadelphia: Galaxy Publishing Company (1874) Nulty not only helped mold Henry Charles Lea as a scholar but also (along with his father's and grandfather's connections) opened many an academic door for Lea. The erudite Nulty gave the Lea brothers a classical education. He singlehandedly taught the pair the entirety of the trivium (grammar, logic and rhetoric) and quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music and celestial navigation) and classical languages and history of its standard curriculum. Nulty immersed the boys in a single subject for long periods to encourage its complete mastery. Observing Henry's precocity, Nulty early on encouraged him to master far more difficult lessons than usually expected of a student his age. Henry Lea also demonstrated a facility for languages and analytical thought.Edward Sculley Bradley Henry Charles Lea. A Biography Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press (1931) p 42 Edward Peters ‚ÄúHenry Charles Lea and the Libraries within a Library‚Äù 2 from the Penn Library Collections at 250, page 35.‚Äù During their years under Nulty's tutelage, Henry and Carey also worked in the Booth & Boy chemical laboratory. This led to Henry's first published paper‚Äîat age 13‚Äîabout manganese salts. The avocational interests of Lea's father (a noted natural scientist and conchologist as well as publisher) and Lea's mother (a knowledgeable botanist and classical linguist as well as homemaker) supplemented Henry's and Carey's education and shaped their interests. Henry also followed his father's interest in natural history and wrote several papers on descriptive conchology. He also displayed drawing talent and illustrated his own early articles about fossil shells that he had collected. His drawings were also used for the engravings illustrating his father's revision of the Synopsis of the Naiades in 1838. Henry Charles Lea developed an interest in poetry and at his mother's suggestion, translated Greek poets and composed original verse. Later, he often wrote satirical parodies of popular songs about politics. =Marriage= On 27 May 1850, Henry Charles Lea married his first cousin and orphan Anna Caroline Jaudon (1824‚Äì1912). Her father, merchant William Latta Jaubon (1798‚Äì1832) of Bucks County, Pennsylvania had died in Cincinnati, Ohio when she was a child, followed four years later by her mother, Susan Gibson Lea Jaudon (1799‚Äì1836). The Jaudons were a wealthy Huguenot family from Soubise, France, and after the Edict of Nantes Peter Jaudon emigrated to Bucks County (and his family became Presbyterians), and Elie Jaudon emigrated to South Carolina. Perhaps the most noteworthy members were the teacher Daniel Jaudon (1767‚Äì1826, Anna Caroline's grandfather) and the financier Samuel Jaudon. Two years later Lea's brother Matthew Carey Lea married her sister Elizabeth (1827‚Äì1881), whose husband merchant William Bakewell had died in Cincinnati in 1850, leaving her with a young daughter.Edwin Jaquett Seller, The Jaubon family of Pennsylvania, (Allen, Lane & Scott, Philadelphia, 1924) p. 19 available at from Bucks County, Pennsylvania https://books.google.com/books?id=l6HRAAAAMAAJ&pg;=PA10&lpg;=PA10&dq;=jaudon+philadelphia&source;=bl&ots;=48BIOA6Igf&sig;=9r0coBVYHpCm7C673qAB- ANDwtE&hl;=en&sa;=X&ei;=AnoFVeHxI4iYgwTZ34OACA&ved;=0CCUQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&q;=jaudon%20philadelphia&f;=false, also available at Hathi Trust The Leas had three sons (who succeeded their father in the publishing business) and a daughter: Francis Henry Lea (1851‚Äì1902), Charles Matthew (1853‚Äì1886), Anna (Nina) Lea (1855‚Äì1927) and Arthur Henry Lea (1859‚Äì1939). Career In 1843 Henry Charles Lea joined his father in business and continued with the firm (renamed Lea, Brothers & Co. and even later Lea & Febinger) until 1880 when his sons took over the business. In 1847, after working in the family publishing firm for four years, Lea suffered a nervous breakdown and the twenty-two-year-old abandoned his intellectual and scientific work for some time. Dr. S. Weir Mitchell, one of the country's most prominent doctors in the field of nervous disorders, treated Lea and became a family friend. During his convalescence, Lea began reading French memoirs of the medieval period. They kindled his interest in medieval history and changed his career course from scientist to historian. =Historian= Thereafter Lea focused on history, mainly on church history in the later Middle Ages, and on institutional, legal, and ecclesiastical history, as well as magic and witchcraft. He also did significant work on the history of the Italian city-states. His active writing career on historical subjects spanned more than fifty years, during which Lea published ten books and numerous articles. His literary reputation rests largely on those books. Highly disciplined work habits (and the ability to purchase manuscripts in Europe and Latin America and have them shipped to Philadelphia) led Lea to continue writing despite even headaches and eye problems. His productivity increased during his final twenty-five years after he retired as a publisher and built an extension to his house at 2000 Walnut Street, for his extensive manuscript collection. Lea became an authority on the Spanish Inquisition, and his multi-volume work was considered groundbreaking, though opinionated. Although some criticized him for anti-Catholic bias,Dewey, R. S. \\"The Last Historian of the Inquisition,\\" The American Catholic Quarterly Review, Vol. XIII, N¬∞. 51, July 1888. Lea received honorary degrees from universities including Harvard, Princeton, Pennsylvania in the United States, as well as the Giessen and Moscow. His study of the Inquisition was also criticized for anti-Spanish bias, which Juli√°n Juder√≠as in 1914 termed the 'leyenda negra' (a/k/a Black legend). Lea became a member of the newly formed American Historical Association in 1884, contributed several articles to its American Historical Review, and was elected its president in 1903. He was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1888.American Antiquarian Society Members Directory When the second annual meeting of the newly formed American Folklore Society was held in Philadelphia in 1889, Lea met with some of the founders, sent an article for publication in the Society's journal, and became the first life-member of the organization. =Civic activist= During the American Civil War Lea was a member of the Union League of Philadelphia and headed its publication committee, writing many of the League's published pamphlets. In 1863 Lea was appointed one of the Bounty Commissioners under the Enrollment Act and served until 1865, working closely with Provost Marshal General James B. Fry accounting for the city's quotas of enlisted men. He thus he became involved with recruiting African American regiments to fight in the Union army. Outspoken about public works and health projects in Philadelphia, Lea founded the public hygiene program at the University of Pennsylvania. He strongly opposed the building of City Hall at the Penn Square location at the intersection of Broad Street and Market Street (then known as High Street) where it now stands, preferring instead that it be built in Washington Square, near Independence Hall. Lea believed that the project cost too much, and was angered by the political corruption involved in the awarding of contracts and purchase of building materials. Lea planned and held a large public meeting to recruit support for his alternative to the Penn Square project. The National Republican League chose Lea as its president in 1880 (the year he retired from his publishing business) and five years later, Lea served as president of the Association of Republicans and Independents. In 1891 he helped found \\"The Reform Political League of Pennsylvania\\", with Herbert Welsh as president, himself and Justus C. Strawbridge as vice-presidents, and Charles E. Richardson as secretary. Lea joined with others in 1884 and filed a lawsuit to oppose building a large slaughterhouse on the Schuylkill River at Thirtieth and Spruce streets on land owned by the Pennsylvania Railroad Company, citing the pollution of the river, the stench, and devaluation of properties near the plant. He also opposed the construction of the Market Street elevated train, over properties he owned on Market Street, as well as building the \\"boulevard\\" from City Hall northwest to Fairmount Park, where the Philadelphia Museum of Art was later built. Death and legacy The tomb of Henry Charles Lea tomb at Laurel Hill Cemetery is adorned with a sculpture of Clio, the muse of history, by Alexander Stirling Calder Lea died in Philadelphia and was buried at Laurel Hill Cemetery. His children ultimately conveyed his collection of purchased manuscripts and incunabula as well as other early printed books to the University of Pennsylvania. In 1925, the University dedicated a library, which it named in his honor and which includes much of that personal collection of books and manuscripts. Speakers at the dedication included Professor George Lincoln Burr of Cornell University, who worked to complete the manuscript of Lea's Materials Toward a History of Witchcraft ; Professor Dana C. Munro of Princeton University, vice president of the American Historical Association, who had used Lea's collections as a young scholar; and Hampton L. Carson, Philadelphia historian and former attorney general of Pennsylvania. Works * Superstition and Force: Essays on the Wager of Law, the Wager of Battle, the Ordeal, Torture Henry C.

Academic career Educated at the Lyc√©e Condorcet, Ecole des Hautes Etudes, Ecole des Sciences Politiques, Reinach had a brilliant career as a scholar and was called to the Parisian bar where he practised from 1881 to 1886 but eventually devoted himself to the study of numismatics. He became Chair in ancient numismatics at the Coll√®ge de France and was a director of various journals. In 1916, he was awarded the medal of the Royal Numismatic Societyhttp://numismatics.org.uk/medals-honorary-fellowship-prizes/the- societys-medal/ and in 1917, during World War I, he worked on assignment in the United States. He wrote important works on the ancient kingdoms of Asia Minor‚ÄìTrois royaumes de l'Asie Mineure, Cappadoce, Bithynie, Pont (1888), Mithridate Eupator (1890); also a critical edition and translation with Henri Weil of Plutarch's Treatise on Music; and an Histoire des Isra√©lites depuis la ruine de leur ind√©pendance nationale jusqu'√† nos jours (2nd ed., 1901). From 1888 to 1897 Th√©odore Reinach edited the Revue des √©tudes grecques. He received an honorary Doctorate of Letters (D.Litt.) from the University of Dublin in June 1902. Family and Villa Kerylos In 1886, Th√©odore Reinach married Charlotte Marie Evelyne Hirsch. They had two daughters but she died at age twenty-six in 1889. Th√©odore Reinach married a second time in 1891 to Fanny Kann, a daughter of Maximilien Kann and Betty Ephrussi. They made their home in a chateau at La Motte-Servolex in the Savoie department in southeastern France. As a resident there, Th√©odore Reinach was elected to the Chamber of Deputies of France as a member of the Bloc des gauches, serving from 1906‚Äì1914. The Reinachs spent time on the French Riviera and in 1902 hired the architect Emmanuel Pontremoli to design a villa at Beaulieu-sur-Mer. Completed in 1908 the Greek-style property was named Villa Kerylos. Fanny Reinach died in 1917 and Theodore in 1928. He was a member of the Institut de France and on his death he bequeathed the Villa Kerylos to the Institut. Th√©odore's son, L√©on (1893‚Äì1943), became the keeper of the archives at Villa Kerylos. L√©on Reinach was married to B√©atrice de Camondo with whom he had two children. Following the German occupation of France during World War II the Villa was seized by the Nazis and L√©on and B√©atrice Reinach and their two children were sent to Auschwitz concentration camp where they were murdered. After the War, other of the Reinach children and grandchildren continued to live there until 1967. Today, the Villa Kerylos is a museum open to the public. Fanny Reinach's mother was a member of the Ephrussi family whose cousin Maurice was married to B√©atrice de Rothschild. Inspired by the beauty of the Reinach's Villa Grecque K√©rylos and the area, nearby they built Villa Ephrussi de Rothschild.

It is the sequel to Myst and second in the Myst series of games. Developed by Cyan Worlds, it was initially published by Red Orb Entertainment, a division of Broderbund. Riven was distributed on five compact discs and released on October 31, 1997, in North America; it was later released on a single DVD-ROM on August 17, 1998, \\"Broderbund is becoming one of the first game companies to jump on the DVD platform, with a DVD release of Riven: The Sequel to Myst... with improved audio and a fourteen-minute \\"making-of\\" video. In addition to the PC versions, Riven has been ported to several other platforms. The story of Riven is set immediately after the events of Myst. Having been rescued from the efforts of his sons, the main non-player protagonist Atrus enlists the help of the player character to free his wife from his power-hungry father, Gehn. Unlike Myst, which took place on several worlds known as Ages linked together by special books, Riven takes place almost entirely on the Age of Riven, a world slowly falling apart due to Gehn's destructive rule. Development of Riven began soon after Myst became a success, and spanned more than three years. In an effort to create a visual style distinct from that of Myst, director Robyn Miller and his brother, producer Rand Miller recruited former Aladdin production designer Richard Vander Wende as a co-director. Broderbund employed a US$10 million advertising campaign to publicize the game's release. Riven was praised by reviewers, with the magazine Salon proclaiming that the game approaches the level of art. Critics positively noted the puzzles and immersive experience of the gameplay, though publications such as Edge felt that the nature of point- and-click gameplay limited the title heavily. The best-selling game of 1997, Riven sold 1.5 million copies in one year. After the game's release, Robyn Miller left Cyan to form his own development studio, ending the professional partnership of the two brothers. Rand stayed at Cyan and continued to work on Myst-related products including The Myst Reader and the real-time rendered game Uru: Ages Beyond Myst. The next entry in the Myst series, Myst III: Exile, was developed by Presto Studios and published by Ubisoft. Gameplay A screenshot of Riven, showing the prison island where the non-player character Catherine is held captive. Like its predecessor, Riven is a point and click adventure game played from a first-person perspective. The player explores immersive environments depicted through a large series of computer generated stills using mouse clicks for movement or to manipulate objects within reach. By operating mechanical contraptions and deciphering codes and symbols discovered in the surroundings, the vaguely explained goal can eventually be reached. To navigate the world, the player simply clicks in the direction they want to walk or turn. The cursor changes in appearance, depending on its position on the screen and what it is hovering over, to show what effect clicking will have. For instance, if the player positions the cursor hand near the side of the screen, it may show a pointing finger, indicating that clicking will turn the view in that direction. The cursor also changes in context to show when players can drag or toggle switches, or when certain items can be picked up and carried. Such items can then be examined at any time, and either reveal clues to puzzles or provide information on the game's setting and story. Like Myst, Riven has an optional method of navigation known as Zip Mode, which allows players to skip to areas already explored, but may cause them to miss important clues. Riven has more complex and numerous puzzles than its forerunner and is set in a larger virtual world for players to explore. Whereas in Myst the objective of the game is to travel to different Ages to solve puzzles before returning to a \\"hub Age\\", Rivens gameplay takes place on the five islands of the Age of Riven. Much of it consists of solving puzzles to access new areas of the islands, though players are also able to explore without fulfilling objectives. The volcanic landscape depicted, with its steep cliffs and crater lakes, is bestrewn with mechanical, Victorian-style artifacts such as elevators, pipes, levers and roller coaster- like transports. To solve the game, players must consider the purpose and physical principles of these artifacts as well as their role in the fictional culture. Plot Rivens story continues where Myst and its companion novel, The Book of Atrus, left off. The player assumes the role of the Stranger, the protagonist of the first game and friend of Atrus (Rand Miller). Atrus knows the ancient art of creating \\"linking books\\", specially written books that serve as portals to other worlds known as \\"Ages\\". Atrus needs the Stranger's help to free his wife, Catherine (Sheila Goold; voice by Rengin Altay), who is held hostage in her home Age of Riven, which is slowly collapsing. Her captor is Gehn (John Keston), Atrus' manipulative father and self-declared ruler of Riven. Thirty years earlier, Atrus and Catherine trapped Gehn on Riven by removing all of the linking books that led out of the Age; the very last book to be removed, linking to the Age of Myst, was the one they held to escape Riven. In the belief that it would be destroyed, they let the book fall into the Star Fissure, a rift leading out of the damaged Age of Riven into a mysterious, space-like void. Catherine was later tricked into returning to Riven by her sons, Sirrus and Achenar, whereupon she was taken hostage by Gehn. Eventually, the player discovered the unharmed Myst book, leading to the events in Myst. At the beginning of Riven, Atrus equips the player with a trap book‚Äîa snare that functions as a one-man prison, yet looks identical to a linking book‚Äîand his personal diary. This diary summarizes the history of events leading to the present situation; Atrus cannot explain in depth as he is engaged in rewriting the descriptive book of Riven, in an attempt to slow its deterioration. The player must enter the Age with no way of leaving, as Atrus cannot risk sending a real linking book to Riven until Gehn is safely imprisoned lest he use it to escape Riven. Instructing the player to capture Gehn in the trap book, find Catherine, and then signal him, Atrus holds out the link book that will transport the player to Riven. Once there, the player explores the islands of Riven, eventually discovering Catherine's prison. The player also travels to Tay, the Age of the Moiety (rebellious Rivenese under the leadership of Catherine who are attempting to end Gehn's tyrannical rule), and the \\"233rd Age\\", Gehn's personal sanctuary, where the player meets Gehn himself. Gehn attempts to convince the player that his intentions to rebuild D'ni (the civilization responsible for originating the art of the link books) were honorable and that he seeks atonement for his past transgressions. Because of the decay of Riven's structure, the only way to clearly signal Atrus is to bring about a massive disturbance in the Age's stability‚Äîaccomplished by reopening the Star Fissure, which Gehn had closed. When it opens, Atrus immediately links to Riven to investigate and meets the player at the brink of the Fissure. Depending on the player's actions, the ending to Riven varies. In the best ending, the player tricks Gehn into the prison book and releases Catherine. Atrus and Catherine thank the Stranger before linking back to the Age of Myst. The Stranger then falls into the Star Fissure to be taken on the path back to his world. The worst ending involves neither capturing Gehn nor releasing Catherine, which allows Gehn to kill Atrus (and then the player) and escape from his imprisonment. Other endings include capturing Gehn without saving Catherine, or being trapped in the prison book. Development Taos Pueblo, a Native American settlement near Santa Fe. The artists spent a day at a famous pueblo in Santa Fe, gathering textures for the game. Cyan began work on Riven in 1993, immediately after Mysts release. Before development began, when even the name of the game was undecided, the brothers Robyn and Rand Miller said they wanted a \\"natural flow\\" from the first game to the sequel. As Myst proved to be a popular and commercial success, the two developers were able to expand their four-person team to a much larger crew of designers, artists, programmers, and sound designers. Development spanned more than four years, and was a much larger undertaking than for the first game; Riven had a budget of between US$5 and $10 million, more than ten times the cost of developing Myst. The design for Riven stemmed from a desire to create something different and more dynamic than the romantic style of Myst. At an early point, the game's world was to be called Equiquay. The first stage of development was to create the puzzles, in an attempt to integrate them as smoothly as possible into the areas in the game. The Millers met their co-designer, Richard Vander Wende, at a demonstration of Myst for the Digital World Expo in Los Angeles. Vander Wende had previously worked for ILM, and at Disney as a designer for the animated feature Aladdin. As the third member of Rivens conceptual team, Vander Wende ended up contributing what Robyn Miller described as an \\"edgier\\" and complementary vision, that made the game dramatically different than its predecessor. At the time of Rivens development, publisher Broderbund was facing falling revenues as development costs rose. Two years into the project, Cyan still had nothing they could show them. Broderbund's stock dropped from $60 a share to $22 in 1996, because of a delay in the publishing of Riven. The plan had been to ship the game in time for the 1996 holiday season; Riven was finally published on October 31, 1997. Even though Rivens sales were expected to be higher than any other game that holiday season, Broderbund launched a $10 million marketing campaign and developed a retail marketing partnership with Toshiba America. Anticipation for the game was high even among non- gamers, helped by web-based word of mouth and well-placed media coverage. =Graphics= As in Myst, the topography of the islands was originally created as grayscale images, where brightness corresponded to elevation. In Softimage, these maps were turned into the terrain models seen in the game. The large island objects were broken apart to facilitate efficient rendering, which required them to be created using polygonal geometry. All other objects were modeled using B-splines and NURBS. Many of the textures were accumulated during a three-day trip to Santa Fe, New Mexico. The artists took hundreds of photos of wood, adobe, sand, stucco and other materials, which were treated in Photoshop before being mapped onto the 3D geometry. Whereas many computer- generated environments of the time ended up looking smooth, like plastic, the Millers and Vander Wende developed a more gritty and weathered design, with corroded and aged elements, to imply reality. The artists considered how objects would look and function if they were real, where and how they would be worn, and created corresponding details. While bump maps were occasionally used to simulate geometry, even small details such as screws were often individually modeled. Rendering was executed in Mental Ray, using numerous custom-made shaders to produce lifelike lighting, water and landscapes. Wireframes also served as a guide to model the backgrounds. In total Riven has over three hours of video and almost five thousand images; rendering was a major bottleneck in production despite the use of 18 dedicated workstations. Some scenes consisted of tens of thousands of individual models and textures and more than a hundred virtual light sources. Loading a single island model could take two hours. Runtime animation effects were created by Mark DeForest, to add flying insects and simple water ripples. Riven combined the pre- rendered backgrounds with live action footage, in order to increase the player's immersion level. Riven was the first game in which any of its designers had directed live actors, and Vander Wende was apprehensive about their use. Rand Miller had to reprise his role of Atrus from Myst, even though he hated acting. All the actors were filmed with a blue screen as a backdrop, which was removed in post-production by chroma key, so that the actors would blend into the virtual environment. Real world stairs, doorways and studio lights had to be meticulously positioned on the live stage to match their CG equivalents. Some sequences were seamlessly cut together with morphing, to allow for partial variations due to the nonlinearity of the gameplay. =Audio= Robyn Miller composed Rivens music, which was later packaged and released by Virgin Records as Riven: The Soundtrack. Miller designed the liner notes and packaging, which included English translations of the language found in the game. Whereas the music to Myst was, at first, only available by mail- order from Cyan, Virgin Records had bought the rights to release it initially, prompting Miller to make sure that it could stand alone in CD form. The compact disc was released on February 24, 1998, with 54 minutes of music. Miller established three leitmotifs for the game's three central characters, Atrus, Catherine, and Gehn. Gehn's theme is only heard in its complete form near the end of the game, but portions of the melody can be heard throughout Riven, highlighting his control of the Age. Miller tried to let the environment dictate the resulting sound in order to make the music as immersive as possible. He blended live instrumentation with synthesizers: \\"By mixing and matching conventional instrumentation, you can create an odd, interesting mood,\\" Miller said. Ultimately, he wanted the music of Riven to reflect the game itself, which he described as having \\"a familiar-yet-strange feel to it.\\" Miller described his biggest challenge in writing Rivens music as reconciling the linear, pleasing construction of music with the nonlinearity of the gameplay. As players can freely explore all areas, Miller explained in an interview, \\"the music can't say anything too specific. If it says something, if it builds in intensity and there starts to be a climax, and people are just standing in a room looking around, and they're thinking 'What's going on in here? Is something about to jump out from behind me?' You can't have the basic parts of music that you'd like to have, you can't have a basic structure. It's all got to be just flowing, and continue to flow.\\" Allmusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine argued that the soundtrack is \\"appealingly atmospheric\\", but \\"lacks definition\\", and that the music loses impact when separated from the game. =Ports= Sunsoft, who previously published Myst for the Sega Saturn, were initially set to publish the Saturn version of Riven in PAL regions, but the rights were later picked up by Acclaim Entertainment. Atari Corporation were in talks with Sunsoft in regards for a potential conversion of Riven to the Atari Jaguar that never materialized. On December 17, 2017, ScummVM added support for Riven. Reception Riven was generally positively received by critics, with the PC version garnering an average critic score of 83/100 at Metacritic. The game sold more than 1.5 million units within a year of its release, and was the best-selling game of 1997, despite having only been on the market for less than three months. Myst or Riven held the number one and two spots on the PC Data sales charts from June 1997 until January 1998. By 2001, over 4.5 million units had been sold. Jeff Segstack of GameSpot gave the game high marks, explaining that it is \\"a leisurely paced, all-encompassing, mentally challenging experience. If you enjoyed Myst, you'll thoroughly enjoy Riven.\\" Computer Gaming World stated that the graphics were the best they had seen in any adventure game. Laura Miller of Salon declared that \\"Art [...] is what Riven approaches,\\" and praised the gameplay as having \\"a graceful elegance that reminds [her] of a masterfully constructed novel.\\" The game's sound and graphics were consistently praised. Macworlds Michael Gowan highlighted the game's \\"rich, engrossingly mysterious world\\", and he argued that the quality of its storytelling made Riven \\"more like a good novel than a computer game.\\" Nevertheless, several publications found fault with aspects of Riven. Computer Gaming World felt that the gameplay was too similar to the original Myst, making Riven the \\"same game with a new title\\"; the magazine also criticized the minimal character interaction. Gaming magazine Edge felt that although Riven was a good game, the solitary atmosphere and lack of mobility was steadily becoming outdated, as games like Super Mario 64 sacrificed graphical fidelity for an increase in freedom. They stated \\"the question is whether Cyan can incorporate its almost Tolkien-esque world-building skills into a more cutting-edge game vehicle next time.\\" Even long-time players of the Myst games, such as Heidi Fournier of Adventure Gamers, felt that a few puzzles were too difficult; Computer and Video Games, meanwhile, believed that the story clues were too symbolic and scant, which made following the plot difficult. Next Generation reviewed the PC version of the game, rating it three stars out of five, and stated that \\"Your aunt who just bought a Packard Bell will no doubt be enthralled, but anyone with a mature palate has surely seen it all before.\\" Despite the success of the game, the Miller brothers eventually pursued other projects. Robyn Miller said: \\"I think it would be a detriment to always, for the rest of our lives, be creating Myst-like projects. [‚Ä¶] We're going to change, evolve and grow, just like any person does in any manner.\\" Robyn would leave Cyan to form a new development company called Land of Point; Vander Wende would also leave to pursue other projects. The next video game entry in the Myst franchise would be 2001's Myst III: Exile, which was not developed by Cyan nor published by Broderbund. Presto Studios took over development; Ubisoft acquired Broderbund's entertainment library from The Learning Company and published the Myst sequels. The reviewer from Pyramid #29 (Jan./Feb., 1998) stated that \\"Myst, and now Riven, are worlds to be explored, with complex puzzles to be solved, and without time limitations or enemies to worry about. Take all the time you like; the basic problems of the game will still be there, waiting for you to solve them.\\" References  External links   Category:1997 video games Category:Acclaim Entertainment games Category:Android (operating system) games Category:Cancelled Atari Jaguar games Category:Cyan Worlds games Category:First-person adventure games Category:Interactive Achievement Award winners Category:iOS games Category:Mac OS games Myst II Category:PlayStation (console) games Category:ScummVM supported games Category:Sega Saturn games Category:Sega video games Category:Single-player video games Category:Ubisoft games Category:Video game sequels Category:Video games developed in the United States Category:Video games set on islands Category:Windows games ","title":"Riven"},{"id":"334543","text":"The Ahom script or Tai Ahom Script, is an abugida that is used to write the Ahom language, a dead (but being revived) Tai language spoken by the Ahom people till the late 18th-century, who established the Ahom kingdom and ruled the eastern part of the Brahmaputra valley between the 13th and the 18th centuries.Diller, A. (1993). Tai Languages. In International Encyclopedia of Linguistics (Vol. 4, pp. 128-131). Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press. The old Ahom language today survives in the numerous manuscripts written in this script currently in institutional and private possession.  History  The Ahom script was probably ultimately derived from the Indic, or Brahmi script, the root of almost all the Indic and Southeast Asian abugidas. It is probably of South Indic origin.French, M. A. (1994). Tai Languages. In The Encyclopedia of Language and Linguistics (Vol. 4, pp. 4520-4521). New York, NY: Pergamon Press Press. The Brahmi script spread in a peaceful manner, Indianization, or the spread of Indian learning. It spread naturally to Southeast Asia, at ports on trading routes.Court, C. (1996). Introduction. In P. T. Daniels & W. Bright (Eds.) The World's Writing Systems (pp. 443). Oxford: Oxford University Press. At these trading posts, ancient inscriptions have been found in Sanskrit, using scripts that originated in India. At first, inscriptions were made in Indian languages, but later the scripts were used to write the local Southeast Asian languages. Hereafter, local varieties of the scripts were developed. By the 8th century, the scripts had diverged and separated into regional scripts.Court, C. (1996). The spread of Brahmi Script into Southeast Asia. In P. T. Daniels & W. Bright (Eds.) The World's Writing Systems (pp. 445-449). Oxford: Oxford University Press. It is believed that the Ahom people adopted their script from either Old Mon or Old Burmese, in Upper Myanmar before migrating to the Brahmaputra Valley in the 13th century. This is supported based on similar shapes of characters between Ahom and Old Mon and Old Burmese scripts. It is clear, however, that the script and language would have changed during the few hundred years it was in use. The earliest attestation of the Ahom script is in the form of coins minted during the reign of Suklenmung (1539-1552). Samples of writing in the Ahom Script (Buranji's) remain stored in Assamese collections. The manuscripts were reportedly traditionally produced on paper prepared from agarwood (locally known as sachi) bark. Assamese replaced Ahom during the 17th century.Assam. (2008). In Columbia Encyclopedia Retrieved April 12, 2009, from http://www.credoreference.com/entry/8256016/. The Ahom script is no longer used by the Ahom people to read and write in everyday life. However, it retains cultural significance and is used for religious chants and to read literature. Ahom's literary tradition provides a window into the past, of Ahom's culture.Hongladarom, K. (2005). Thai and Tai Languages. In Encyclopedia of linguistics (Vol. 2, pp. 1098-1101). New York, NY: Fitzroy Dearborn. A printed form of the font was developed in 1920, to be used in the first \\"Ahom- Assamese-English Dictionary\\".Terwiel, B. J., & Wichasin, R. (eds.), (1992). Tai Ahoms and the stars: three ritual texts to ward off danger. Ithaca, NY: Southeast Asia Program.  Characteristics  Like most abugidas, each letter has an inherent vowel of /a/. Other vowels are indicated by using diacritics, which can appear above, below, to the left, or to the right of the consonant. The script does not, however, indicate tones used in the language. The Ahom script is further complicated as it contains inconsistencies; a consonant may be written once in a word, but pronounced twice, common words may be shortened, and consecutive words with the same initial consonant may be contracted.

It has a somewhat smokey flavor, but is usually un-smoked. The cheese is handmade and covered in a hard, dark brown, inedible rind. It is aged for a few months and develops a nutty, buttery flavor, eaten fresh, often with quince jam. If aged longer, it becomes firm, dry and sharp and can be used for grating. The Denomination of Origin for Idiazabal cheese was created in 1987 and defines the basic regulations for the product's manufacture. Typically, unpasteurized milk from latxa breed of sheep is used, although in some cases the D.O. permits the use of milk from Carranzana breed, from the Encartaciones in Biscay. The D.O. also stipulates that the milk be curdled with the natural lamb rennet, and permits external smoking of the cheese. The cheeses produced in the following towns in accordance with all the D.O. regulations, are therefore also protected by the Idiazabal D.O. : Urbia, Entzia, Gorbea, Ordu√±a, Urbasa and Aralar. Recently some Basque Country farmers have begun to use hybrid Assaf sheep, which some maintain does not meet the Denomination of Origin for the cheese. Production process Idiazabal is an aged cheese, from semi-cured to cured, made exclusively from whole unpasteurized sheep's milk. It is produced by strong enzymatic coagulation. The pressed paste can be either uncooked or semi-cooked. It can eventually be externally smoked. The milk used to produce Idiazabal must be whole unpasteurized, with a minimum of 6% fat. The milk coagulates at a temperature of , with the addition of natural lamb curd, resulting in a compact curdle after 30 to 45 minutes. The curdle is cut in order to obtain rice-size grains, and then reheated to . In the case of coagulation at higher temperatures, the reheating temperature can reach . The reheated and shrunken paste dehydrates and is placed in molds where it may or may not be seasoned before pressing. Salting of the cheese is performed by rubbing the rind with dry salt or immersing the cheese in highly salted water for 24 hours. Finally, the cheeses are aged under cold and humid conditions avoiding mold, for at least two months. The optional smoking takes place at the end of the aging process, using woods from the beech-tree, birch-tree, cherry tree or white pine. The intensity of the smoked qualities depends upon the type of wood and length of smoking. The cheeses are usually cylindrical in shape, although they are occasionally cone- or octagonal-shaped. The rinds of artisan cheeses may be engraved with drawings or symbols characteristic of the Basque culture. The rind is closed, smoked, waxy, without mold. The unsmoked cheeses have a yellow-beige color, while smoked cheeses are brownish. The interior is compact, without air pockets or with only pin-head size holes, and is beige or pale yellow in color. The interior of the smoked cheeses has a brownish border. The taste is strong and pronounced, slightly acidic and piquant, buttery and consistent, with a characteristic sheep milk flavor. The smoked version is somewhat drier and stronger, with a pleasant aroma. The size of every cheese ranges from small to medium, with weights between .

Dough is typically made by mixing flour with a small amount of water and/or other liquid, and sometimes includes yeast or other leavening agents as well as other ingredients such as various fats or flavorings. The process of making and shaping dough is a precursor to making a wide variety of foodstuffs, particularly breads and bread-based items, but also including biscuits, cakes, cookies, dumplings, flatbreads, noodles, pasta, pastry, pizza, piecrusts, and similar items. Doughs are made from a wide variety of flours, commonly wheat but also flours made from maize, rice, rye, legumes, almonds, and other cereals and crops used around the world. Types of dough A statue of a servant kneading dough, from Egypt, Old Kingdom, 5th Dynasty, c. 2494‚Äì2345 BCE Acaraj√© is a fried dough food Doughs vary widely depending on ingredients, the kind of product being produced, the type of leavening agent (particularly whether the dough is based on yeast or not), how the dough is mixed (whether quickly mixed or kneaded and left to rise), and cooking or baking technique. There is no formal definition of what makes dough, though most doughs have viscoelastic properties. Leavened or fermented doughs (generally made from grain cereals or legumes that are ground to produce flour, mixed with water and yeast) are used all over the world to make various breads. Salt, oils or fats, sugars or honey and sometimes milk or eggs are also common ingredients in bread dough. Commercial bread doughs may also include dough conditioners, a class of ingredients that aid in dough consistency and final product. Flatbreads such as pita, lafa, lavash, matzah or matzo, naan, roti, sangak, tortilla, and yufka are eaten around the world and are also made from dough. Some flatbreads, such as naan, use leavening agents; others, such as matzo, do not. Crackers are also made from dough, and some (such as saltine crackers) are leavened. Pasta and noodles are generally based on unleavened doughs that are worked until they are dry and smooth, and then shaped into their final form. The finished pasta may be cooked immediately or dried before cooking. Doughs with higher fat content have a lesser water content, develop less gluten and are therefore generally less elastic than bread doughs; these doughs are often called \\"short\\" by bakers. This category includes many cookie and pie crust doughs, such as shortcrust pastry. In many parts of central India, people use the quick method of making an instant roasted dough ball or baati. In countries in the Sahel region of Africa, dough balls called aiysh or biya are made from sorghum or millet, and are ground and boiled. Quick breads use leavening agents other than yeast (such as baking powder or baking soda), and include most cookies, cakes, biscuits, and more; these may be based on a batter or a dough.  Techniques  Techniques used in dough production depend on the type of dough and final product. For yeast-based and sponge (such as sourdough) breads, a common production technique is the dough is mixed, kneaded, and then left to rise. Many bread doughs call for a second stage, where the dough is kneaded again, shaped into the final form, and left to rise a final time (or proofed) before baking. Kneading is the process of working a dough to produce a smooth, elastic dough by developing gluten. This process is both temperature and time-dependent; temperatures that are either too hot or too cold will cause the yeast to not develop, and rising times that are either too short or too long will affect the final product. Pasta is typically made from a dry dough that is kneaded and shaped, either through extrusion, rolling out in a pasta machine, or stretched or shaped by hand (as for gnocchi or dumplings). Pasta may be cooked directly after production (so-called \\"fresh pasta\\") or dried, which renders it shelf-stable. Doughs for biscuits and many flatbreads which are not leavened with yeast are typically mixed but not kneaded or left to rise; these doughs are shaped and cooked directly after mixing. While breads and other products made from doughs are often baked, some types of dough-based foods are cooked over direct heat, such as tortillas, which are cooked directly on a griddle. Fried dough foods are also common in many cultures. Pancakes, waffles, some kinds of bar cookies such as brownies, and many cakes and quick breads (including muffins and the like) are often made with a semi-liquid batter of flour and liquid that is poured into the final shape, rather than a solid dough. Unlike bread dough, these batters are not stabilized by the formation of a gluten network.Stanley P. Cauvain. (2012) Chapter 12: Baking. in Food Processing Handbook. 2 ed. Wiley. p. 422 .

Vergina was established in 1922 in the aftermath of the population exchanges after the Treaty of Lausanne and was a separate municipality until 2011, when it was merged with Veroia under the Kallikratis Plan. Vergina is best known as the site of ancient Aigai (Œë·º∞Œ≥Œ±ŒØ, Aiga√≠, Latinized: Aegae), the first capital of Macedon. In 336 BC Philip II was assassinated in Aigai's theatre and his son, Alexander the Great, was proclaimed king. The most important recent finds were made in 1977 when the burial sites of several kings of Macedon were found, including the tomb of Philip II which had not been disturbed or looted, unlike so many of the other tombs there. It is also the site of an extensive royal palace. The archaeological museum of Vergina was built to house all the artifacts found at the site and is one of the most important museums in Greece. Aigai has been awarded UNESCO World Heritage Site status as \\"an exceptional testimony to a significant development in European civilization, at the transition from classical city-state to the imperial structure of the Hellenistic and Roman periods\\". History From 1000 BC the area within a 7km radius of the later city was already intensively occupied by villages forming an important population centre, as shown by archaeology since 1995, and similar to other ancient Greek cities' development.Angeliki Kottaridi, Aegae, the Macedonian metropolis, Treasures from the Royal Capital of Macedon, Ashmolean Museum 2011. p 155 In the 7th century BC, the Temenids' dominance led to the Macedonians expanding and subduing local populations until the end of the 6th century BC, and establishing the dynasty at Aigai. Ancient sources give conflicting accounts of the origins of the Argead dynasty.Justin: Historiarum PhilippicarumStrabo. Geography, Book 7 Alexander I is the first truly historic figure and, based on the line of succession, the beginnings of the Macedonian dynasty have been traditionally dated to 750 BC.Hammond, Nicholas Geoffrey Lempri√®re; Griffith, Guy Thompson (1972). A History of Macedonia: Historical Geography and Prehistory I. Oxford, United Kingdom: Clarendon Press. Herodotus saysHerodotus. Histories, 8.137.8 that the Argead dynasty was an ancient Greek royal house led by Perdiccas I who fled from Argos, in approximately 650 BC. Aigai is the name of several ancient cities (see Aegean Sea#Etymology), derived from the name of a legendary founder, Aegeus, but also etymologized as \\"city of goats\\" (from Œ±·º¥Œæ, a√≠ks, \\"goat\\") by Diodorus Siculus, who reports it was named so by Perdiccas I who was advised by the Pythian priestess to build the capital city of his kingdom where goats led him.Sikeliotis, Diodoros or Diodorus Siculus 80-20 B.C., Historical, 7.16: \\" and then/Where thou shalt see white-horned goats, with fleece/Like snow, resting at dawn, make sacrifice/Upon the blessed gods upon that spot/And raise the chief city of a state.\\" From archaeology it now seems certain that Aigai developed and remained until the end an organised collection of villages and without a regular plan spatially representing the aristocratic structure of tribes centred on the power of the king. Indeed, Aigai never became a large city and most of its inhabitants lived in surrounding villages. The walled asty (acropolis) was built at the centre of Aigai.https://www.aigai.gr/en/explore/asty/aiges/vergina From Aigai the Macedonians spread to the central part of Macedonia and displaced the local population of Pierians. From 513 to 480 BC Aigai was part of the Persian Empire, but Amyntas I managed to maintain its relative independence, avoid Satrapy and extend its possessions. In the Ô¨Årst half of the 5th century BC Aigai became the capital of Macedonia, the most important northern Hellenic state. Life reached unseen levels of luxury and to meet the needs of the court merchants from all over the ancient world brought to Aigai valuable goods including perfume, carved ornaments and jewellery.>Angeliki Kottaridi, Aegae, the Macedonian metropolis, Treasures from the Royal Capital of Macedon, Ashmolean Museum 2011. p 158 The city wall was built in the 5th century, probably by Perdiccas II. At the end of the 5th century Archelaus I brought to his court artists, poets, and philosophers from all over the Greek world: it was, for example, at Aigai that Euripides wrote and presented his last tragedies. At the beginning of the 4th century BC, Archelaus transferred the Macedonian capital north-east to Pella on the central Macedonian plain. Nevertheless, Aegae retained its role as the sacred city of the Macedonian kingdom, the site of the traditional cult centres, a royal palace and the royal tombs. For this reason it was here that Philip II was attending the wedding of his daughter Cleopatra to King Alexander of Epirus when he was murdered by one of his bodyguard in the theatre. His was the most lavish funeral ceremony of historic times held in Greece. Laid on an elaborate gold and ivory deathbed wearing his precious golden oak wreath, the king was surrendered, like a new Hercules, to the funeral pyre. The bitter struggles between the heirs of Alexander in the 3rd century adversely affected the city; in 276 BC Gaulish mercenaries of Pyrrhus plundered many of the tombs. After the overthrow of the Macedonian kingdom by the Romans in 168 BC, both old and new capitals were destroyed, the walls pulled down and all buildings burned. In the 1st century AD, a landslide destroyed what had been rebuilt (excavations establish that parts were still inhabited at that time.‚ÄúVergina 2012: The excavation at the ‚ÄòTsakiridis‚Äô Section‚Äù: Styliani Drougou, professor of History and Archaeology Department, Aristotle University of Thessaloniki. http://archaeologynewsnetwork.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/vergina-2012-excavation- at-tsakiridis.html Between the 2nd and 5th centuries AD the population gradually moved down from the foothills of the Pierian range to the plain, and all that remained was a small settlement whose name alone Palatitsia (palace) indicated its former importance. The modern settlement of Vergina was established in 1922, between the two pre-existing villages of \\"Kutlesh\\" (ŒöŒøœçœÑŒªŒµœÇ, Ko√∫tles) and \\"Barbes\\" (ŒúœÄŒ¨œÅŒºœÄŒµœÇ, B√°rmpes), formerly part of the Ottoman Beylik of Palatitsia. In the 19th century, both Kutlesh and Barbes were Greek villages in the Ber Kaza of the Ottoman Empire. Several inhabitants of the two villages took part in the Greek uprising of 1821. Alexander Sinve (Les Grecs de l‚ÄôEmpire Ottoman. Etude Statistique et Ethnographique) wrote in 1878 that 120 Greeks lived in Barbas. According to the statistics of Vasil Kanchov (\\"Macedonia. Ethnography and Statistics\\"), in 1900, 60 Greek Christians lived in Kutlesh and 50 in Barbes. The town of Vergina was settled in the course of the population exchange between Greece and Turkey following the Treaty of Lausanne, by Greek families from Asia Minor. The name \\"Vergina\\" was a suggestion by the metropolitan of Veroia, chosen from a legendary queen Vergina (Bergina), who was said to have ruled somewhere north of the Haliacmon and to have had her summer palace near Palatitsia.Alexander Eliot, The Penguin Guide to Greece (1991), p. 291. Vergina was a separate municipality from 1922 until 2011, when it was incorporated into Veroia.Kallikratis law Greece Ministry of Interior The population of Vergina municipality as of 2011 was 2,464, of whom 1,242 lived in Vergina proper. Archaeology Archaeologists were interested in the burial mounds around Vergina as early as the 1850s, supposing that the site of Aigai was in the vicinity. Excavations began in 1861 under the French archaeologist Leon Heuzey, sponsored by Napoleon III. Parts of a large building that was considered to be one of the palaces of Antigonus III Doson (263‚Äì221 BC), partly destroyed by fire, were discovered near Palatitsa, which preserved the memory of a palace in its modern name. However, the excavations had to be abandoned because of the risk of malaria. The excavator suggested that this was the site of the ancient city Valla, a view that prevailed until 1976.M. Andronikos,\\"Anaskafi sti Megali Toumpa tis Verginas\\" Archaiologica Analekta Athinon 9(1976), 127‚Äì129. In 1937, the University of Thessaloniki resumed the excavations. More ruins of the ancient palace were found, but the excavations were abandoned on the outbreak of war with Italy in 1940. After the war the excavations were resumed, and during the 1950s and 1960s the rest of the royal capital was uncoved including the theatre. The Greek archaeologist Manolis Andronikos became convinced that a hill called the Great Tumulus (ŒúŒµŒ≥Œ¨ŒªŒ∑ Œ§ŒøœçŒºœÄŒ±) concealed the tombs of the Macedonian kings. In 1977, Andronikos undertook a six-week dig at the Great Tumulus and found four buried tombs, two of which had never been disturbed. Andronikos claimed that these were the burial sites of the kings of Macedon, including the tomb of Philip II, father of Alexander the Great (Tomb II) and also of Alexander IV of Macedon, son of Alexander the Great and Roxana (Tomb III). This view was challenged by some archaeologists, but in 2010 research based on detailed study of the skeletons, vindicated Andronikos and supports the evidence of facial asymmetry caused by a possible trauma of the cranium of the male, evidence that is consistent with the history of Philip II.Musgrave J, Prag A. J. N. W., Neave R., Lane Fox R., White H. (2010) The Occupants of Tomb II at Vergina. Why Arrhidaios and Eurydice must be excluded, Int J Med Sci 2010; 7:s1-s15 From 1987 the burial cluster of the queens was discovered including the tomb of Queen Eurydice. In March 2014, five more royal tombs were discovered in Vergina, possibly belonging to Alexander I of Macedon and his family or to the family of Cassander of Macedon. Some artifacts excavated at Vergina may be treated as influenced by Asian practices or even imported from Achaemenid Persia in late 6th and early 5th centuries BC,. which is during the time Macedon was under the Persian sway. =Royal burial cluster of Philip II= Model of Philip II's tomb The museum of the tumulus of Philip II, which was inaugurated in 1993, was built over the tombs leaving them in situ and showing the tumulus as it was before the excavations. Inside the museum there are four tombs and one small temple, the heroon built as the temple for the burial cluster of Philip II. The two most important tombs (II and III) were not sacked and contained the main treasures of the museum. Tomb II of Philip II, the father of Alexander was discovered in 1977 and was separated in two rooms. The main room included a marble chest, and in it was the larnax made of 24 carat gold and weighing , embossed with the Vergina Sun symbol. Inside the golden larnax the bones of the dead were found and a golden wreath of 313 oak leaves and 68 acorns, weighing . In the room were also found the golden and ivory panoply of the dead, the richly carved burial bed on which he was laid and later burned and exquisite silver utensils for the funeral feast. Other magnificent items include several gold-adorned suits of armour, weapons and bronze funeral utensils. larnax and the golden grave crown of Philip. In the antechamber was another chest with another golden larnax containing the bones of a woman wrapped in a golden-purple cloth with a golden diadem decorated with flowers and enamel, indicating a queen (probably Philip's Thracian wife, Meda) who by tradition sacrificed herself at the funeral. Also included was another burial bed partially destroyed by the fire and on it a golden wreath representing leaves and flowers of myrtle. Above the Doric order entrance of the tomb is a magnificent wall painting measuring representing a hunting scene, believed to be the work of the celebrated Philoxenos of Eretria, and thought to show Philip and Alexander. Remains from the funerary pyre of Philip II Next to him in Tomb I a distinctive member of his family (probably Nikissipoli, another of his queens), was buried just a few years before in a cist grave, found unfortunately plundered. The only wall painting in the tomb pictures the Abduction of Persephone by the God of the Underworld, the silent Demeter and the three unprejudiced Fates with Hermes, the Guide of Souls, leading the way, and a scared nymph witnessing the horrifying event. This is a unique example of ancient painting, believed to be the work of the famous painter Nikomachos, as well as one of the few surviving depictions of the ancient mystic views of afterlife. The couch of Philip II ornamented with ivory The collapsed Heroon In 1978 Tomb III was discovered, also near the tomb of Philip, which is thought to belong to Alexander IV of Macedon son of Alexander the Great, murdered 25 years after Philip's assassination. It is slightly smaller than the tomb II and was also not sacked. It was also arranged in two parts, but only the main room contained a cremated body. On a stone pedestal was found a fine silver hydria, which contained the cremated bones, and on it a golden oak wreath. There were also exquisite silver utensils and weaponry indicating royal status. A narrow frieze with a chariot race by a great painter decorated the walls of the tomb. The remains of a wooden mortuary couch adorned with gold and ivory is notable for an exquisite representation of Dionysos with a flute-player and a satyr. Tomb IV, discovered in 1980, had an impressive entrance with four Doric columns though is heavily damaged and may have contained valuable treasures. It was built in the 4th century BC and may have belonged to Antigonus II Gonatas. The great tumulus was constructed at the beginning of the third century BC (by Antigonos Gonatas) perhaps over smaller individual tumuli to protect the royal tombs from further pillaging after marauding Galati had looted and destroyed the cemetery. The hill material contained many earlier funeral stele. =Palace= The most important building discovered is the monumental palace; located on a plateau directly below the acropolis this building of two or perhaps three storeys is centred on a large open courtyard flanked by Doric colonnades. On the north side was a large gallery that commanded the stage of the neighbouring theatre and the whole Macedonian plain. It was sumptuously decorated, with mosaic floors, painted plastered walls, and fine relief tiles. Excavations have dated construction of the palace to the reign of Philip II, even though he also had a palace in the capital, Pella. This huge building was visible from the whole Macedonian basin; a remarkable landmark, a symbol of power and beauty. This unique building, utterly revolutionary and avant-garde for its time, was designed for Philip by an ingenious architect (probably Pytheos, known for his contribution to the construction of the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus and to the development of urban planning and the theory of proportion) would become an archetype of all basileia (kingdoms), i.e. the palaces in the Hellenistic world and beyond. The masonry and architectural members, all artfully processed, were covered with lustrous high-quality marble stucco that resembles marble and reminds us of Vitruvius's description of the plaster used in Mausolus's palace that shined as if made of glass. The theatre, also from the second half of the 4th century BC, forms an integral part of the palace. The palace is considered to be not only the biggest but, together with the Parthenon, the most significant building of classical Greece. Restoration works on the palace are due to be completed by 2022. =Other tombs= Scene from the throne of Queen Eurydice Tomb of Thessalonike of Macedon found near the palace of Aigai by K. Romaios The cemetery of the tumuliThe Cemetery of the Tumuli, https://www.aigai.gr/en/explore/necropolis/tombs/aiges/vergina extends for over and contains over 500 grave-mounds of significant wealth, some dating as early as the 11th century BC. To the north-west of the ancient city is the important group of tombs from the 6th and 5th centuries BC belonging to members of the Macedonian dynasty and their courts. The Cluster of the Queens includes cist and pit tombs dating to the Greco-Persian Wars era, two of which probably belong to the mother and spouse of Alexander I: the all golden \\"Lady of Aigai\\" and her female relative, in whose funeral at least twenty-six (26) small terracotta statues. One from around 340 BC with an imposing marble throne is identified as that of Eurydice, mother of Philip II. The so-called \\"Ionian Tomb\\" or \\"Tomb of the Roman\\" is an elegant Macedonian tomb containing a throne, probably belonging to queen Thessalonike.

These formatting conventions can adjust positioning and spacing (indent style), add color and contrast (syntax highlighting), adjust size, and make similar modifications intended to make the content easier for people to view, read, and understand. Prettyprinters for programming language source code are sometimes called code beautifiers. Pretty-printing mathematics A typeset mathematical expression Pretty-printing usually refers to displaying mathematical expressions similar to the way they would be typeset professionally. For example, in computer algebra systems such as Maxima or Mathematica the system may write output like \\"\`x ^ 2 + 3 * x\`\\" as Some graphing calculators, such as the Casio 9860 series, HP-49 series, TI-84 Plus, TI-89, and TI-Nspire, the TI-83 Plus with the PrettyPtPrettyPt add-on, or the TI-84 Plus with the same add-on or the \\"MathPrint\\"-enabled OSes, can perform pretty-printing. Additionally, a number of newer scientific calculators are equipped with dot matrix screens capable of pretty-printing such as the Casio FX-ES series (Natural Display), Sharp EL-W series (WriteView), HP SmartCalc 300s, and TI-30XB. Many text formatting programs can also typeset mathematics: TeX was developed specifically for high-quality mathematical typesetting. Pretty-printing markup and tag-based code Pretty-printing in markup language instances is most typically associated with indentation of tags and string content to visually determine hierarchy and nesting. Although the syntactical structures of tag-based languages do not significantly vary, the indentation may vary significantly due to how a markup language is interpreted or due to the data it describes. In MathML, whitespace characters do not reflect data, meaning, or syntax above what is required by XML syntax. In HTML, whitespace characters between tags are considered text and are parsed as text nodes into the parsed result. While indentation may be generously applied to a MathML document, sufficient additional care must be taken in prettyprinting an HTML document to ensure additional text nodes are not created or destroyed in general proximity to the content or content- reflective tag elements. This difference in complexity is non-trivial from the perspective of an automated pretty-print operation where no special rules or edge cases are necessary, as in the more simple MathML example. The HTML example may require a series of progressive interrelated algorithms to account for various patterns of tag elements and content that conforms to a uniform style and is consistent in application across various instances, as evidenced by the markup.tsmarkup.ts application component used to beautify HTML, XML, and related technologies for the Pretty Diff tool. Programming code formatting and beautification Programmers often use tools to format programming language source code in a particular manner. Proper code formatting makes it easier to read and understand. Different programmers often prefer different styles of formatting, such as the use of code indentation and whitespace or positioning of braces. A code formatter converts source code from one format style to another. This is relatively straightforward because of the unambiguous syntax of programming languages. Code beautification involves parsing the source code into component structures, such as assignment statements, if blocks, loops, etc. (see also control flow), and formatting them in a manner specified by the user in a configuration file. Code beautifiers exist as standalone applications and built into text editors and integrated development environments. For example, Emacs' various language modes can correctly indent blocks of code attractively. =HTML= =Lisp pretty-printer= An early example of pretty-printing was Bill Gosper's \\"GRINDEF\\" (i.e. 'grind function') program (c. 1967), which used combinatorial search with pruning to format LISP programs. Early versions operated on the executable (list structure) form of the Lisp program and were oblivious to the special meanings of various functions. Later versions had special read conventions for incorporating non-executable comments and also for preserving read macros in unexpanded form. They also allowed special indentation conventions for special functions such as \`if\`.Ira Goldstein, \\"Pretty Printing : Converting List to Linear Structure\\", Artificial Intelligence Memo 279, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, February 1973. full textRichard C. Waters, \\"Using the new common Lisp pretty printer\\", ACM SIGPLAN Lisp Pointers 5:2:27-34, April‚ÄìJune 1992. full text The term \\"grind\\" was used in some Lisp circles as a synonym for pretty-printing.Jargon File, s.v. grind =Project style rules= Many open source projects have established rules for code layout. The most typical are the GNU formattingGNU style and the BSD style.BSD style The biggest difference between the two is the location of the braces: in the GNU style, opening and closing braces are on lines by themselves, with the same indent. BSD style places an opening brace at the end of the preceding line, and the closing braces can be followed by else. The size of indent and location of whitespace also differs. =Example of formatting and beautifying code= The following example shows some typical C structures and how various indentation style rules format them. Without any formatting at all, it looks like this: int foo(int k){if(k<1k>2){printf(\\"out of range \\"); printf(\\"this function requires a value of 1 or 2 \\");}else{ printf(\\"Switching \\");switch(k){case 1:printf(\\"1 \\");break;case 2:printf(\\"2 \\");break;}}} The GNU indent program produces the following output when asked to indent according to the GNU rules: int foo (int k) { if (k < 1  k > 2) { printf (\\"out of range \\"); printf (\\"this function requires a value of 1 or 2 \\"); } else { printf (\\"Switching \\"); switch (k) { case 1: printf (\\"1 \\"); break; case 2: printf (\\"2 \\"); break; } } } It produces this output when formatting according to BSD rules: int foo(int k) { if (k < 1  k > 2) { printf(\\"out of range \\"); printf(\\"this function requires a value of 1 or 2 \\"); } else { printf(\\"Switching \\"); switch (k) { case 1: printf(\\"1 \\"); break; case 2: printf(\\"2 \\"); break; } } } Formatted text Formatted text can be considered a generalized form of pretty-printing.

Biography Henry was born in Grantham, Lincolnshire on 12 October 1614. He was the seventh son of Alexander More, mayor of Grantham, and Anne More (n√©e Lacy). Both his parents were Calvinists but he himself \\"could never swallow that hard doctrine.\\" He was schooled at The King's School, Grantham and at Eton College. In 1631 he entered Christ's College, Cambridge, at about the time John Milton was leaving it. He took his BA in 1635, his MA in 1639, and immediately afterwards became a fellow of his college, turning down all other positions that were offered. He would not accept the mastership of his college, to which, it is understood, he would have been preferred in 1654, when Ralph Cudworth was appointed. In 1675, he finally accepted a prebend in Gloucester Cathedral, but only to resign it in favour of his friend Edward Fowler, afterwards bishop of Gloucester. More taught many notable pupils, including Anne Finch, sister of Heneage Finch, subsequently Earl of Nottingham. She later became Lady Conway, and at her country seat at Ragley in Warwickshire, More would spend \\"a considerable part of his time.\\" She and her husband both appreciated him, and amidst the woods of this retreat he wrote several of his books. The spiritual enthusiasm of Lady Conway was a considerable factor in some of More's speculations, even though she at length joined the Quakers. She became the friend not only of More and William Penn, but of Franciscus Mercurius van Helmont (1614‚Äì1699) and Valentine Greatrakes, mystical thaumaturgists of the 17th-century. Ragley became a centre of devotion and spiritualism. Views More was a rationalist theologian. He attempted to use the details of 17th- century mechanical philosophy‚Äîas developed by Ren√© Descartes‚Äîto establish the existence of immaterial substance.Henry, John, \\"Henry More\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy. More rejected Cartesian dualism on the following grounds: \\"It would be easier for me to attribute matter and extension to the soul, than to attribute to an immaterial thing the capacity to move and be moved by the body.' His difficulties with Cartesian dualism arose, not from an inability to understand how material and immaterial substances could interact, but from an unwillingness to accept any unextended entity as any kind of real entity. More continues \\"...it is plain that if a thing be at all it must be extended.\\" So for More 'spirit' too must be extended. This led him to the idea of a 'fourth dimension' (a term which he coined) in which the spirit is extended (to which he gave the curious name of \\"essential spissitude\\")More, H. The Immortality of the Soul. London (4th edition). 1712. For further comments on this idea see Burtt, E.A. The Metaphysical Foundations of Science. London.

Influence More appears to be the origin of the still-popular slur against medieval Scholasticism that it engaged in useless speculative debates, such as how many angels might dance on the head of a pin (or \\"on a needles [sic] point,\\" as he puts it), in the second chapter of The Immortality of the Soul. A quotation from More is used as the epigraph of Ralph Waldo Emerson's essay \\"The Over-soul.\\" Helena Blavatsky, the founder of Theosophy, quoted More and gave an exposition of his ideas in chapter VII of \\"Isis Unveiled\\". Works Works (Henrici Mori Cantabrigiensis Opera Omnia), 1679 More was a prolific writer of verse and prose. The Divine Dialogues (1688) condenses his general view of philosophy and religion. Like many others, he began as a poet and ended as a prose writer. His first work, published in 1642, but written two years earlier, was Psychodoia Platonica: or, a Platonicall Song of the Soul, consisting of four several Poems. It was followed in 1647 by his full collection of Philosophical Poems, which includes The Song of the Soul, enlarged and is dedicated to his father. A second edition was published in the same year, and it was included by A. B. Grosart in his Chertsey Worthies Library (1878).Dictionary of National Biography; More, Henry (1614‚Äì1687). More's prose works are: *Observations upon Anthroposophic Theomagica and Anima Magica Abscondita, by Alazonomastix Philalethes (pseudonym, see -mastix), 1650; in answer to Thomas Vaughan, who replied in The Man-mouse took in a Trape. * The Second Lash of Alazonomastix, a rejoinder to Vaughan, 1651. *An Antidote against Atheism, or an Appeal to the Natural Faculties of the Minde of Man, whether there be not a God, 1653: 2nd edit. corrected and enlarged, with an Appendix, 1655. *conjecture Cabbalistica ... or a Conjectural Essay of Interpreting the Minde of Moses, according to a Threefold Cabbala: viz. Literal, Philosophical, Mystical, or Divinely Moral, 1653; dedicated to Ralph Cudworth. * enthusiasm Triumphatus, or a Discourse of Nature, Causes, Kinds, and Cure of Enthusiasm; written by Philophilus Parrasiastes, and prefixed to Alazonomastix his Observations and Reply, 1656. * The Immortality of the Soul, so far forth as it is demonstrable from the Knowledge of Nature and the Light of Reason, 1659; dedicated to Viscount Conway. *An Explanation of the Grand Mystery of Godliness; or a True and Faithful Representation of the Everlasting Gospel of our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ, 1660. * A Modest Enquiry into the Mystery of Iniquity, and an Apologie, 1664. *Enchiridion Ethicum, praecipua Moralis Philosophiae Rudimenta complectens, illustrate ut plurimum Veterum Monuments, et ad Probitatem Vitae perpetuo accommodate, 1667, 1668, 1669, 1695, 1696, and 1711. *Divine Dialogues, containing sundry Disquisitions and Instructions concerning the Attributes of God and His Providence in the World, 1668. The most authentic edition appeared in 1713. *An Exposition of the Seven Epistles to the Seven Churches; Together with a Brief Discourse of Idolatry, with application to the Church of Rome. The title of the latter in the volume itself is An Antidote against Idolatry, and it elicited from More in reply to attacks A brief Reply to a late Answer to Dr. Henry More his antidote against Idolatry, 1672, and An Appendix to the late Antidote against Idolatry, 1673. *Enchiridion Metaphysicum: sive, de rebus incorporeal succinct et luculent dissertatio; pars prima, 1671, an attack on Cartesian philosophy, which he had in earlier life admired. *Remarks upon two late ingenious Discourses [by Matthew Hale]; the one, an Essay, touching the Gravitation and non-Gravitation of Fluid Bodies; the other, touching the Torricellian Experiment, so far forth as they may concern any passages in his \\"Enchiridion Metaphysicum,\\" 1676. *Apocalypsis Apocalypseos; or the Revelation of St. John the Divine unveiled: an exposition from chapter to chapter and from verse to verse of the whole Book of the Apocalypse, 1680. *A Plain and continued Exposition of the several Prophecies or Divine Visions of the Prophet Daniel, which have or may concern the People of God, whether Jew or Christian, 1681. *A Brief Discourse of the Real Presence of the Body and Blood of Christ in the Celebration of the Holy Eucharist; wherein the Witty Artifices of the Bishop of Meaux [Bossuet] and of Monsieur Maimbourg are obviated, whereby they would draw in the Protestants to imbrace the doctrine of Transubstantiation, 1681. More is also believed to have written Philosophiae Teutonicae Censura, 1670, a criticism of the theosophy of Jacob Boehme; and to have edited Joseph Glanvill's Saducismus Triumphatus, 1681. He certainly contributed largely to the volume, and also wrote many of the annotations to Glanvill's Lux Orientalis, 1682. More agreed with Glanvill on belief in witchcraft and apparitions. Several letters from More to John Worthington are printed in Worthington's Diary, and some Letters Philosophical and Moral between John Norris and Henry More are added to Norris's Theory and Regulation of Love, 1688. A Collection of several Philosophical Writings of Dr. Henry More was first published in 1662 and includes his Antidote against Atheism, with the Appendix, Enthusiasmus Triumphatus, Letters to Des Cartes, &c.;, Immortality of the Soul, and Conjectura Cabbalistica. A fourth edition, corrected and much enlarged, was published in 1712, with notes.' More issued complete editions of his works, his Opera theologica in 1675, and his Opera philosophica in 1678. Between 1672 and 1675 he was principally engaged in translating his English works into Latin. In 1675 appeared Henrici Mori Cantabrigiensis Opera Theologica, Anglice quidem primitius scripta, mine vero per autorem Latine reddita. Hisce novus praefixus est De Synchronismis Apocalypticis Tractatulus. It was followed in 1679 by a larger work in two volumes, Henrici Mori Cantabrigiensis Opera Omnia, tum quae Latine tum quae Anglice scripta sunt; nunc vero Latinitate donata instigatu et impensis generosissimi juvenis Johannis Cockshutt nobilis Angli. John Cockshutt of the Inner Temple had left a legacy of ¬£300 to More to have three of his principal pieces translated into Latin; and More complied with the terms of the legacy by translating into Latin many more of his English works. In 1692 were published Discourses on Several Texts of Scripture, with a preface signed \\"John Worthington\\"; and in 1694 Letters on Several Subjects, published by Edmund Elys. Abridgments of and extracts from the works of More were numerous; and in 1708 a volume was published for charitable libraries, The Theological Works of the most Pious and Learned Henry More. The work is in English, but \\"according to the author's Improvements in his Latin edition\\". The main authorities for More's life are Richard Ward's Life (1710); the prefatio generalissima prefixed to his Opera omnia (1679); and also an account of his writings in an Apology published in 1664. His Philosophical Poems appeared (1647), with his Echief speculations and experiences\\". Analysis of his life and works is given in John Tulloch's Rational Theology, vol. ii. (1874); see also Johann Georg Ritter von Zimmermann, Henry More und die vierte Dimension des Raums (Vienna, 1881); Henry More: Tercentenary Studies, ed. by Sarah Hutton (Dordrecht, 1990).

A member of the Democratic Party, he served as a U.S. Representative (1935‚Äì39) and a U.S. Senator (1943‚Äì77) from Arkansas. At the time of his death, he was the second most senior member of the Senate and chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee. He is the longest-serving senator in Arkansas history. Early life and career John Little McClellan was born on a farm near Sheridan, Arkansas to Isaac Scott and Belle (n√©e Suddeth) McClellan. His parents, who were strong Democrats, named him after John Sebastian Little, who served as a U.S. Representative (1894‚Äì1907) and Governor of Arkansas (1907). His mother died only months after his birth, and he received his early education at local public schools. At age 12, after graduating from Sheridan High School, he began studying law in his father's office. He was admitted to the state bar in 1913, when he was only 17, after the Arkansas General Assembly approved a special act waiving the normal age requirement for certification as a lawyer. As the youngest attorney in the United States, he practiced law with his father in Sheridan. McClellan married Eula Hicks in 1913; the couple had two children, and divorced in 1921. During World War I, he served in the U.S. Army as a first lieutenant in the aviation section of the Signal Corps from 1917 to 1919. Following his military service, he moved to Malvern, where he opened a law office and served as city attorney (1920‚Äì26). In 1922, he married Lucille Smith, to whom he remained married until her death in 1935; they had three children. He was prosecuting attorney of the seventh judicial district of Arkansas from 1927 to 1930. U.S. House of Representatives In 1934, McClellan was elected as a Democrat to the U.S. House of Representatives from Arkansas's 6th congressional district. He was re-elected to the House in 1936. In March of that year, he condemned CBS for airing a speech by Communist leader Earl Browder, which he described as \\"nothing less than treason.\\" During his tenure in the House, he voted against President Franklin D. Roosevelt's court-packing plan, the Gavagan anti- lynching bill, and the Reorganization Act of 1937. In 1937, he wed for the third and final time, marrying Norma Myers Cheatham. In 1938, McClellan unsuccessfully challenged first-term incumbent Hattie Caraway for the Democratic nomination for the United States Senate. During the campaign, he criticized Caraway for her support for the 1937 Reorganization Act and accused her of having \\"improper influence\\" over federal employees in Arkansas. Nevertheless, he was defeated in the primary election by a margin of about 8,000 votes. He subsequently resumed the practice of law in Camden, where he joined the firm Gaughan, McClellan and Gaughan. He served as a delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1940 (Chicago), 1944 (Chicago), and 1948 (Philadelphia). U.S. Senate In 1942, after G. Lloyd Spencer decided not to seek re-election, McClellan ran for the Senate again and this time won. He served as senator from Arkansas from 1943 to 1977, when he died in office. During his tenure, he served as chairman of the Appropriations Committee and served 22 years as chairman of the Committee on Government Operations. McClellan was the longest serving United States Senator in Arkansas history. During the later part of his Senate service, Arkansas had, perhaps, the most powerful Congressional delegations with McClellan as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, Wilbur Mills as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, Oren Harris as chairman of the House Commerce Committee, Senator J. William Fulbright as chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Took Gathings as chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, and James William Trimble as a member of the powerful House Rules Committee. McClellan also served for eighteen years as chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (1955‚Äì73) and continued the hearings into subversive activities at U.S. Army Signal Corps, Fort Monmouth, New Jersey, where Soviet spies Julius Rosenberg, Al Sarant and Joel Barr all worked in the 1940s. He was a participant in the famous Army-McCarthy Hearings and led a Democratic walkout of that subcommittee in protest of Senator Joseph McCarthy's conduct in those hearings. McClellan appeared in the 2005 movie Good Night, and Good Luck in footage from the actual hearings. McClellan led two other investigations which were both televised uncovering spectacular law-breaking and corruption. The first, under the United States Senate Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management, also known as the McClellan Committee, investigated union corruption and centered on Jimmy Hoffa and lasted from January 1957 to March 1960. In April 1961, during a Senate Investigations Committee hearing, contractor Henry Gable asserted that Communists would not be able to do the same amount of damage to the American missile effort as done by labor at Cape Canaveral. McClellan suggested that the comments bordered on subversion and called for more testimony from the unions. The second in 1964, known as the Valachi hearings, investigated the operations of organized crime and featured the testimony of Joseph Valachi, the first American mafia figure to testify about the activities of organized crime. He continued his efforts against organized crime, supplying the political influence for the anti-organized crime law Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO) until 1973 when he switched to investigating political subversion. During this period, he hired Robert F. Kennedy as chief counsel and vaulted him into the national spotlight. He investigated numerous cases of government corruption including numerous defense contractors and Texas financier Billie Sol Estes. In 1956, McClellan was one of 82 representatives and 19 senators who signed the Southern Manifesto in opposition to the 1954 U.S. Supreme Court decision Brown v. Board of Education and racial integration. One of McClellan's law partners prior to his Senate service, Maud Crawford, went missing in March 1957 in Camden, Arkansas. There had been speculation that she had been kidnapped by the Mafia in an attempt to intimidate McClellan, but no ransom note was ever forthcoming. The disappearance, which remains unsolved, received international attention. Senator John Little McClellan However, in 1986 the local paper ran a series of articles suggesting that she was killed as she was obstructing the attempt by another partner in McClellan's law firm to subvert the will of one of her clients. It is unclear whether McClellan would have been aware of this matter although, since it involved matters of legal ethics and a $15m will it is probable that he was at least aware of the dispute. If so he was complicit in hiding this matter until his death. In 1957, McClellan opposed U.S. President Dwight D. Eisenhower's decision to send federal troops to enforce the desegregation of Central High School in Little Rock. Prior to the sending of the troops under the command of Major General Edwin A. Walker, McClellan had expressed \\"regret [regarding] the ... use of force by the federal government to enforce integration. I believe it to be without authority of law. I am very apprehensive that such action may precipitate more trouble than it will prevent.\\"Quoted in Osro Cobb, Osro Cobb of Arkansas: Memoirs of Historical Significance, Carol Griffee, ed. (Little Rock: Rose Publishing Company, 1989), p. 237, 238 McClellan and fellow Senator Robert S. Kerr of Oklahoma were the sponsors of the bill that authorized construction of the McClellan-Kerr Arkansas River Navigation System, maintained by the Army Corps of Engineers. The system transformed the once-useless Arkansas River into a major transportation route and water source. Although his Select Committee on Improper Activities in Labor and Management had already been dissolved by 1960, McClellan began a related three-year investigation in 1963 through the Permanent Investigations Senate Subcommittee into the union benefit plans of labor leader George Barasch, alleging misuse and diversion of $4,000,000 of benefit funds. McClellan's notable failure to find any legal wrongdoing led to his introduction of several pieces of new legislation including his own bill on October 12, 1965 setting new fiduciary standards for plan trustees. Senator Jacob K. Javits (R-NY) introduced bills in 1965 and 1967 increasing regulation on welfare and pension funds to limit the control of plan trustees and administrators. Provisions from all three bills ultimately evolved into the guidelines enacted in the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). In his last Senate election in 1972, McClellan defeated fellow Democrat David Hampton Pryor, then a U.S. representative, by a narrow 52-48 percent margin in the party runoff. He then defeated the only Republican who ever ran against him, Wayne H. Babbitt, then a North Little Rock veterinarian, by a margin of 61-39 percent. Pryor was elected to the seat in 1978, three weeks before the one-year anniversary of McClellan's death. In 1974, McClellan informed President Gerald R. Ford, Jr., that he would not support the renomination of Republican Lynn A. Davis as U.S. marshal for the Eastern District of Arkansas based in Little Rock. McClellan claimed that Davis, who as the temporary head of the Arkansas state police had conducted sensational raids against mobsters in Hot Springs, was too partisan for the position. In an effort to appease the powerful McClellan, Ford moved to replace Davis with Len E. Blaylock of Perry County, the mild-mannered Republican gubernatorial nominee in the 1972 campaign against Dale Bumpers.Arkansas Outlook, Republican Party newsletter, February and March 1975 In 1977, McClellan was one of five Democrats to vote against the nomination of F. Ray Marshall as United States Secretary of Labor. Personal life McClellan's second wife died of spinal meningitis in 1935 and his son Max died of the same disease in 1943 while serving in Africa during World War II. His son, John L. Jr., died in 1949 in an automobile accident, and his son James H. died in a plane crash in 1958. Both men were members of the Xi chapter of Kappa Sigma fraternity at the University of Arkansas. To honor their two fallen brothers, the Chapter initiated Senator McClellan into Kappa Sigma in 1965. McClellan died in his sleep on November 28, 1977, in Little Rock, Arkansas, following surgery to implant a pacemaker.State Capitol News Report; Benton Courier; Benton, Arkansas; Page 2; December 1, 1977 He was buried at Roselawn Memorial Park in Little Rock. A VA Hospital in Little Rock is named in his honor. Ouachita Baptist University is the repository for his official papers.

Life and works Die Zerst√∂rung von Lisabon (1756) He studied at G√∂ttingen, where he took the degree of a doctor of medicine, and established his reputation by the dissertation, De irritabilitate (1751). After traveling in the Netherlands and France, he practised as a physician in Brugg, and wrote √úber die Einsamkeit (\\"Of solitude\\", 1756, 1784‚Äì85) and Vom Nationalstolz (\\"Of national pride\\", 1758). These books made a great impression in Germany, and were translated into almost every European language. In Zimmermann's character there was a strange combination of sentimentalism, melancholy and enthusiasm; and it was by the free and eccentric expression of these qualities that he excited the interest of his contemporaries. Another book by him, written at Brugg, Von der Erfahrung in der Arzneiwissenschaft (\\"Of experience in pharmacology\\", 1764), also attracted much attention. In 1768 he settled at Hanover as private physician of George III with the title of a Hofrat. Catherine II invited him to the court of St Petersburg, but this invitation he declined. He attended Frederick the Great during that monarch's last illness, and afterwards issued various books about him, of which the chief were √úber Friederich den Grossen und meine Unterredung mit ihm kurz vor seinem Tode (\\"On Frederick the Great and my conversation with him shortly before his death\\", 1788) and Fragmente √ºber Friedrich den Grossen (\\"Fragments on Frederick the Great\\", 1790). According to the Encyclop√¶dia Britannica Eleventh Edition, \\"[t]hese writings display extraordinary personal vanity, and convey a wholly false impression of Frederick's character.\\" He has a daughter named Katharina von Zimmermann, who died in her 20s because of Tuberculosis that also killed her mother and grandmother.

Edward Fowler (1632 ‚Äì 26 August 1714) was an English churchman, Bishop of Gloucester from 1691 until his death.  Early life and education  He was born at Westerleigh, Gloucestershire, and was educated at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, later moving to Trinity College, Cambridge.  Writings  Fowler was suspected of Pelagian tendencies, and his earliest book was a Free Discourse in defence of The Practices of Certain Moderate Divines called Latitudinarians (1670). This supported Samuel Parker and his Discourse of Ecclesiastical Polity of 1669. It also took aim at Thomas Hobbes, by means of positions set out by Daniel Scargill, an apostate Hobbist.Jon Parkin, Science, Religion and Politics in Restoration England: Richard Cumberland's De Legibus Naturae (1999), pp. 45-6. The Design of Christianity, published in the following year, in which he laid stress on the moral design of revelation, was criticized by Richard Baxter in his How far Holiness is the Design of Christianity (1671) and by John Bunyan in his Defence of the Doctrine of Justification by Faith (1672). Bunyan described the Design as \\"a mixture of Popery, Socinianism and Quakerism,\\" an accusation to which Fowler replied in a scurrilous pamphlet entitled Dirt Wip'd Off. He also published, in 1693, Twenty-Eight Propositions, by which the Doctrine of the Trinity is endeavoured to be explained, challenging with some success the Socinian position.  Offices  He was successively rector of Norhill, Bedfordshire (1656) and of All Hallows, Bread Street, London (1673), and in 1676 was elected a canon of Gloucester; his friend, Henry More, one of the Cambridge Platonists, resigned in his favour. In 1681 he became vicar of St Giles, Cripplegate, but after four years was suspended for being a Whig. When the Declaration of Indulgence was published in 1687 he successfully influenced the London clergy against reading it.  Bishopric  In 1691 he was consecrated Bishop of Gloucester and held the see until his death.

C. Williams High School is a public high school in the City of Alexandria, Virginia, just outside of Washington, D.C. The school has an enrollment of about 3,800 students. It is named after former superintendent Thomas Chambliss Williams of Alexandria City Public Schools (ACPS), who served from the mid-1930s to the mid-1960s. The high school is located near the geographic center of the city, at 3330 King Street and is referred to informally as \\"T.C.\\" (rather than \\"Williams\\") by students, faculty and locals. Approximately 4,000 students, primarily from grades 10‚Äì12, are enrolled at T.C's main campus. About 1400 ninth graders have most or all of their classes at the branch Minnie Howard campus (0.6 miles (1.0 km) distant) and participate in T.C. Williams sports and extracurricular activities as well as some classes. The school offers numerous Advanced Placement courses for its students. Every year, dozens of graduates go on to elite colleges, and T.C. Williams has won statewide academic and scientific competitions. T.C. has an Army Junior ROTC program which participated in President Barack Obama's Inaugural Parade. The T.C. Williams Marching Band travels to competitions up and down the East Coast. The school's football team was the subject of the 2000 film Remember the Titans. History T. C. Williams, a four-year high school, initially opened its doors to eighth graders, freshmen, sophomores, and juniors in 1965, and graduated its first class in June 1967. It was Alexandria's third public high school and Minnie Howard Middle School was its \\"feeder\\" school, for seventh and eighth graders. In 1965 the city integrated schools. In 1971 the city consolidated all high school students into T. C. Williams, so that the school became Alexandria's only public senior high school serving 11th and 12th graders. The city's freshmen and sophomores attended Francis C. Hammond and George Washington, the other former four-year schools involved in the three school consolidation. While T. C. Williams and George Washington were already integrated in 1971, Hammond was nearly all white, while the city was about one-fifth black. Currently, \\"T. C.\\" serves 10th through 12th grades while freshmen go to the T. C. Williams Minnie Howard Campus, located 0.6 miles (1.0 km) from the main building. Two middle schools, Francis C. Hammond Middle School (1.8 miles west), and George Washington Middle School (2.0 miles south east), serve 6th through 8th grade students and are housed in the former high schools. Increasing enrollment prompted plans for a new school. In January 2004, the Alexandria School Board approved a plan to build an entirely new school building at the existing location to provide more space. The new building opened on September 4, 2007. The original T. C. Williams building was demolished in January 2008.See for a photo of the demolition of the gymnasium. The new T. C. Williams campus was certified LEED Gold by the U.S. Green Building Council in 2009. The gym of the original T. C. Williams building was named after Gerry Bertier, a member of the Titans' 1971 state championship football team who was paralyzed in a car crash and died 10 years later in a second auto accident near Charlottesville, VA. The newly constructed basketball court was named in honor of the late Earl Lloyd on December 1, 2007. Lloyd attended Parker-Gray High School, which was Alexandria's all-black high school at the time. Lloyd was the first African-American to play in the NBA. The football stadium is named Parker-Gray Stadium in deference to the former pre-segregation high school whose campus was sold for office buildings in the 1980s. The football field was grass until an artificial turf was installed in 2006. During his run for the Democratic nomination, Barack Obama held a rally at T. C. Williams on February 10, 2008. =2020 Name Change Movement= In 2020, in part inspired by the civil rights protests across the United States, a push to rename T.C. Williams began. Advocates for the change argued that the school's namesake, Former Superintendent Thomas Chambliss Williams was a segregationist, and had been unwilling to integrate Alexandria City schools. A petition was circulated in June of 2020 and submitted to the school board later that month. ACPS announced it would begin a review of the school's name, with a public engagement portion to be held in the fall of 2020. A report with recommendations is expected to be completed and sent to the school board in the spring of 2021. The move to rename T.C. Williams sparked a similar movement to name another ACPS school, Matthew Maury Elementary. Demographics As of November 2017, T. C. Williams High School's student body is 42.3% Hispanic, 28.8% African American, 22.0% White, 4.6% Asian, 0.2% Native Hawaiian/Pacific Islander and 2.1% Multi-racial. T.C. also has a thriving International Academy program, part of the wider International Academy Network, which serves to accommodate the large surge of immigrants to the Washington, DC area by teaching English to non-native speakers alongside a rigorous, credit-earning high school curriculum. The International Academy currently has an enrollment of around 600 students, and contains speakers of over 60 languages. Academics T. C. Williams offers more than a dozen different AP courses. It has been ranked by the 2016 Washington Post \\"Challenge Index\\" with an index of 2.836. Under the leadership of Dr. Manu Patel, T. C. was the first Virginia high school to defeat Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology in Fairfax County, Virginia at the Science Bowl. The school also offers five foreign languages to students: Spanish, German, French, Latin, and Chinese. T.C. Williams allows students to apply into specialized academies within the school. These include the STEM academy and Governor's Health Sciences Academy, a collaborative effort with George Washington University that when successfully completed provides students with guaranteed admissions into the George Washington University School of Medicine & Health Sciences. In March 2010, T. C. Williams school was a persistently low achieving school based on its average standardized test scores. =Technology Initiative= T. C. offers Google Chromebooks to all of its students. The initiative, which began in the 2004‚Äì2005 school year, provides every student with their own personal computer, as well as campus- wide wireless Internet access. Wireless access is available at the school during daytime hours and in the evenings at the school library. Internet access is restricted and blocks download sites, entertainment sites, and others that could distract students from their work during class. For students that may have trouble obtaining internet access outside of school, mobile broadband devices are available to students who need them. Extra-curricular activities T. C. teams play in the AAA Patriot District of the AAA Northern Region. The school mascot is a Titan. The school colors are a synthesis of the former colors of the three Alexandria pre-1971 four-year schools: white (from Hammond), blue (G. W.) and red (T. C. W.). The Titans are best known for their football program, which the movie Remember the Titans was based upon. The boys' basketball program, a consistent powerhouse with 12 district, 10 regional, and 2 state championships (most recently in 2008) has also gained statewide recognition. The rowing team has won numerous state and national championships. T. C. has won state championships in football, soccer, cross country, indoor and outdoor track. The football program has won three Virginia AAA state championships: 1971, 1984, and 1987, all of which the Titans finished ranked in the top ten nationally, and the 1971 team was made famous in the movie Remember the Titans, released in 2000. T. C. students managed the feat of winning all three boys' state running championships in consecutive school years, winning the 1991 Cross Country, 1992 Indoor Track, 1992 Outdoor Track, 1992 Cross Country, 1993 Indoor Track, and 1993 Outdoor Track State Championships. They were nationally recognized in 1993 when they became the first ever U.S. high school 4 √ó 100 meter relay team to defeat the Jamaicans at Penn Relays. T. C. boys soccer won the Virginia 6A state championship in 2014 and finished the season ranked number one in the Washington, DC, area and number 9 nationally, evoking the slogan \\"Remember These Titans.\\" Girls' basketball and boys' tennis teams have all captured district championships since 2006. Additionally, the soccer team captured a state title in 2014, with a 2-0 win over Washington-Lee High School. Because T. C. is the only public high school in Alexandria City, and the only non-Fairfax County high school in the Patriot District, the Titans do not have a sole rival school. The Titans do have a rivalry against Lake Braddock Secondary School because of recent competition. The Titans have developed rivalries against Hayfield Secondary School in recent years due to the success of both schools' basketball teams, as well as West Potomac High School, which is located close to Alexandria. Recently, T.C.'s rivalry with Hayfield was partially severed as Hayfield moved into another district due to a decline in enrollment. The two schools, which competed against each other in the 2009 Boys' Basketball Northern Region Championship Game, both missed the regional playoffs in 2010 due to eligibility issues of players. T. C. had to forfeit 12 wins and lost two players including a key starter for the rest of the season. They lost in the first round of the district tournament. =Football and Remember the Titans= T. C. and its former football coaches, Herman Boone and Bill Yoast, were the subject of the 2000 motion picture Remember the Titans, starring Denzel Washington and Will Patton. The movie was a dramatization of the consolidation of Alexandria's three public high schools into one in the fall of 1971. That year, ACPS consolidated its three four-year high schools into a single two- year school, teaching solely juniors and seniors. As a result, the best of the varsity football squads at George Washington High School (converted to a middle school), Hammond High School (converted to a middle school) and T. C. Williams High School united in what amounted to an all-city, all-star team at T. C. Williams. The city's public schools were legally desegregated in 1959, but the three high schools had become racially imbalanced during the 1960s, due to red lining. Racial tension is one of the themes of the film. Yoast was the head coach at Hammond, who won the state title in 1970, while Boone was a head coach at E.J. Hayes High School in Williamston, North Carolina, with five state championships and a 99‚Äì8 () record in nine seasons, from 1961 through 1969. He was not retained after a consolidation and integration of two high schools. Boone was hired as an assistant at T.C. Williams, and expected to be to Yoast's assistant after the Alexandria consolidation in 1971. The climax of the movie is the fictionalized 1971 AAA state championship football game between T. C. Williams and George C. Marshall High School. The dramatic license taken in the movie was to convert what was actually a mid-season matchup between T. C. Williams and Marshall into a made-for-Hollywood state championship. In reality, the Marshall game was the toughest game T. C. Williams played all year and the actual state championship (against Andrew Lewis High School of Salem) was a 27‚Äì0 blowout. As depicted in the movie, the real Titans won the Marshall game on a fourth down come-from-behind play at the very end of the game. T. C. Williams was referenced in the \\"My No Good Reason\\" episode of the television show Scrubs. Three actors wearing T. C. Williams letter jackets appear towards the end of the episode. Donald Faison, who plays Dr. Turk on the sitcom, also starred in Remember the Titans as Petey Jones. Jones died in July 2019, aged 65. = Rugby = T.C. Williams has both boys and girls varsity rugby teams. Coached for the last 16 years by Jeff Murphy, they currently compete against teams in the DC metro area; including Gonzaga College High School, Landon, and The Heights School. The Titans program has produced notable players such as US Air force and Seattle Seawolves forward Capt. Eric Duechle. =Rowing= T. C. is known for its nationally and internationally competitive rowing program, which has its own boathouse on the Alexandria bank of the Potomac River. T. C. Crew has claimed state, national, and international championships. The program has produced several Olympic athletes, most recently Nick Peterson and Linda Miller, who represented the United States at the 2000 Summer Games in Sydney, Australia. The TC Williams boys crew is the successor to the first high school rowing program in the Washington metro area. In 1947, Jack Franklin and Julian Whitestone began training young men from Alexandria's George Washington High School (now Middle School) at the Old Dominion Boat Club. Francis Hammond High School opened in 1956 and soon had its own crew, as did the new TC Williams High School in 1964. George Washington and Hammond merged with TC in 1971. Over the years, these crews have won medals at local, state, national and international competitions including the Stotesbury Cup, the SRAA Nationals and the Canadian Scholastic Championship. Rowers trained at TC have gone on to college success, and the program has produced Olympic rowers, and members of the US National and Junior National teams. =Arts= T.C. is also known for its strides in the arts. Its band program continues to grow and get national coverage, playing across the country, most recently at the 2014 Sugar Bowl. The school also houses thriving programs in Orchestra, Choir, Visual Art, and Theater, the latter of which is continuing to rise in popularity. The T.C. Theater department participates in both the Cappies program and the VHSL's One-Act Competition, faring very well in both arenas. In recent memory, two one-act plays, \\"Ladying\\" and \\"Shuffling\\", have made it to the Regional level of One-Acts, in 2010 and 2013, respectively. The TC Drama Department has also received attention for choosing shows that are considered risky for high schools, including 2010's Chicago; Rent and The Laramie Project in 2011; 2012's The Island of Doctor Moreau, the 2014 production of A Chorus Line, and the 2015 production of Twilight: Los Angeles, 1992.

Life Tulloch was born at Dron, south of Bridge of Earn, Perthshire, and educated at Perth Grammar School.https://archive.org/stream/fastiecclesiaesc00scot/fastiecclesiaesc00scot_djvu.txt He studied Divinity at the University of St Andrews and University of Edinburgh. He was licensed to preach by the Presbytery of Perth in March 1844. In March 1845 (following a period as assistant) he was ordained as minister of St Paul's church in Dundee, and in 1849 was translated to Kettins, in Strathmore, where he remained for six years. In 1854 he was appointed Principal of St Mary's College, St Andrews. The appointment was immediately followed by the appearance of his Burnet prize essay on Theism. At St Andrews, where Tulloch was also professor of systematic theology and apologetics, his teaching was distinguished by several novel features. He lectured on comparative religion and treated doctrine historically, as being not a fixed product but a growth. He was appointed as one of Her Majesty's Chaplains for Scotland and preached a number of sermons before Her Majesty the Queen in Scotland between 1866 and 1876.John Tulloch, Some Facts of Religion and of Life: Sermons Preached Before Her Majesty the Queen (Edinburgh and London: William Blackford and Sons, 1877) Tulloch was popular with his students. In 1862 he was appointed a clerk of the General Assembly, and from then on he took a leading part in the councils of the Church of Scotland. Tulloch was also deeply interested in the reorganization of education in Scotland, both in school and university, and acted as one of the temporary board which settled the primary school system under the Education Act of 1872. In 1878 Tulloch was chosen to be Moderator of the General Assembly, and did much to widen the national church. Two positions on which he repeatedly insisted took a firm hold‚Äîfirst, that a church must be comprehensive of various views and tendencies, and that a national church especially should seek to represent all the elements of the life of the nation; secondly, that subscription to a creed can bind no one to all its details, but only to the sum and substance, or the spirit, of the symbol. For three years before Tulloch's death he was convener of the church interests committee of the Church of Scotland, which had to deal with agitation for disestablishment. In 1884, he was a guest at Haddo House for a dinner hosted by John Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair in honour of William Ewart Gladstone on his tour of Scotland. Tulloch died at Torquay, in 1886. A biography was written by Mrs Oliphant. His body was returned to Scotland for burial. He is buried beneath a large memorial at the centre of the Eastern Cemetery in St Andrews. His wife, Jane Anne Sophia (1826-1887) is buried with him. Family His older brother was Rev David Tulloch (d.1841).https://archive.org/stream/fastiecclesiaesc00scot/fastiecclesiaesc00scot_djvu.txt Works Tulloch's best-known works are collections of biographical sketches of leaders in church history, including those of the Reformation and Puritanism. His major work, Rational Theology and Christian Philosophy (1872), treats the Cambridge Platonists and other 17th century latitudinarians in a similar way. He delivered the second series of the Croall lectures, on the Doctrine of Sin, which were afterwards published. He also published a small work, The Christ of the Gospels and the Christ of History, in which the views of Ernest Renan on the gospel history were dealt with; a monograph on Blaise Pascal for Blackwood's Foreign Classics for English Readers series; and a little work, Beginning Life, addressed to young men, written at an earlier period. =Books= * Beginning Life a Book for Young Men.

In 1609 he finally obtained his doctoral degree in medicine. The same year he married Margaret van Ranst, who was of a wealthy noble family. Van Helmont and Margaret lived in Vilvoorde, near Brussels, and had six or seven children. The inheritance of his wife enabled him to retire early from his medical practice and occupy himself with chemical experiments until his death on 30 December 1644.  Career as chemistry pioneer  The Roman tower of the old church in the house] where van Helmont performed an alchemical transmutation. Drawing by Leon Van Dievoet, 1963. Posthumous portrait of van Helmont Monument for Jan Baptist van Helmont in Brussels Portrait of van Helmont by Mary Beale, c.1674, misidentified for a time as Robert Hooke Van Helmont is regarded as the founder of pneumatic chemistry, as he was the first to understand that there are gases distinct in kind from atmospheric air and furthermore invented the word \\"gas\\". He perceived that his \\"gas sylvestre\\" (carbon dioxide) given off by burning charcoal, was the same as that produced by fermenting must, a gas which sometimes renders the air of caves unbreathable. For Van Helmont, air and water were the two primitive elements. Fire he explicitly denied to be an element, and earth is not one because it can be reduced to water. On the one hand, Van Helmont was a disciple of Paracelsus (though he scornfully repudiated his errors as well as those of most other contemporary authorities), a mystic and alchemist. On the other hand, he engaged in the new learning based on experimentation that was producing men like William Harvey, Galileo Galilei and Francis Bacon. Van Helmont was a careful observer of nature; his analysis of data gathered in his experiments suggests that he had a concept of the conservation of mass. He performed an experiment to determine where plants get their mass. He grew a willow tree and measured the amount of soil, the weight of the tree and the water he added. After five years the plant had gained about 164 lbs (74 kg). Since the amount of soil was basically the same as it had been when he started his experiment (it lost only 57 grams), he deduced that the tree's weight gain had come from water. Since it had received nothing but water and the soil weighed practically the same as at the beginning, he argued that the increased weight of wood, bark and roots had been formed from water.  Religious and philosophical opinions  Although a faithful Catholic, he incurred the suspicion of the Church by his tract De magnetica vulnerum curatione (1621), against Jean Roberti, which was thought to derogate from some of the miracles. His works were collected and edited by his son Franciscus Mercurius van Helmont and published by Lodewijk Elzevir in Amsterdam as Ortus medicinae, vel opera et opuscula omnia (\\"The Origin of Medicine, or Complete Works\\") in 1648. Ortus medicinae was based on, but not restricted to, the material of Dageraad ofte Nieuwe Opkomst der Geneeskunst (\\"Daybreak, or the New Rise of Medicine\\"), which was published in 1644 in Van Helmont's native Dutch. His son Frans's writings, Cabbalah Denudata (1677) and Opuscula philosophica (1690) are a mixture of theosophy, mysticism and alchemy. Over and above the archeus, he believed that there is the sensitive soul which is the husk or shell of the immortal mind. Before the Fall the archeus obeyed the immortal mind and was directly controlled by it, but at the Fall men also received the sensitive soul and with it lost immortality, for when it perishes the immortal mind can no longer remain in the body. Van Helmont described the archeus as \\"aura vitalis seminum, vitae directrix\\" (\\"The chief Workman [Archeus] consists of the conjoyning of the vitall air, as of the matter, with the seminal likeness, which is the more inward spiritual kernel, containing the fruitfulness of the Seed; but the visible Seed is onely the husk of this.\\"). In addition to the archeus, van Helmont believed in other governing agencies resembling the archeus which were not always clearly distinguished from it. From these he invented the term blas (motion), defined as the \\"vis motus tam alterivi quam localis\\" (\\"twofold motion, to wit, locall, and alterative\\"), that is, natural motion and motion that can be altered or voluntary. Of blas there were several kinds, e.g. blas humanum (blas of humans), blas of stars and blas meteoron (blas of meteors); of meteors he said \\"constare gas materi√¢ et blas efficiente\\" (\\"Meteors do consist of their matter Gas, and their efficient cause Blas, as well the Motive, as the altering\\"). Van Helmont \\"had frequent visions throughout his life and laid great stress upon them\\". His choice of a medical profession has been attributed to a conversation with the angel Raphael., and some of his writings described imagination as a celestial, and possibly magical, force. Though Van Helmont was skeptical of specific mystical theories and practices, he refused to discount magical forces as explanations for certain natural phenomena. This stance, reflected in a 1621 paper on sympathetic principles, may have contributed to his prosecution and subsequent house arrest.  Observations on digestion  Van Helmont wrote extensively on the subject of digestion. In Oriatrike or Physick Refined (1662, an English translation of Ortus medicinae), van Helmont considered earlier ideas on the subject, such as food being digested through the body's internal heat. But if that were so, he asked, how could cold-blooded animals live? His own opinion was that digestion was aided by a chemical reagent, or \\"ferment\\", within the body, such as inside the stomach. Harr√© suggests that van Helmont's theory was \\"very near to our modern concept of an enzyme\\". Van Helmont proposed and described six different stages of digestion.  Spontaneous generation   Disputed portrait  In 2003, the historian Lisa Jardine proposed that a portrait held in the collections of the Natural History Museum, London, traditionally identified as John Ray, might represent Robert Hooke. Jardine's hypothesis was subsequently disproved by William Jensen of the University of Cincinnati and by the German researcher Andreas Pechtl of Johannes Gutenberg University of Mainz, who showed that the portrait in fact depicts van Helmont.

He was instrumental in organizing the Cambridge Biological School and acted as Secretary of the Royal Society. Biography Foster was born in Huntingdon, Huntingdonshire, in March 1836, the son of Michael Foster, FRCS. He was educated at Huntingdon Grammar school and University College School, London. After graduating in medicine in 1859, he began to practise in his native town, but in 1867 he returned to London as teacher of practical physiology at University College London, where two years afterwards he became professor. In 1870 he was appointed by Trinity College, Cambridge, to its praelectorship in physiology, and thirteen years later he became the first occupant of the newly created chair of physiology in the university, holding it till 1903. One of his most famous students at Cambridge was Charles Scott Sherrington who went on to win the Nobel Prize in 1932. He married first, in 1864, Georgina Edmonds, daughter of Cyrus Read Edmonds. Following her death in 1869, he married secondly, in 1872, Margaret Rust, daughter of George Rust, JP, of Huntingdon. Career John Collier He excelled as a teacher and administrator, and had a very large share in the organization and development of the Cambridge biological school. From 1881 to 1903 he was one of the secretaries of the Royal Society, and in that capacity exercised a wide influence on the study of biology in Britain. In the 1899 Birthday Honours, he was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB), and served as president of the British Association at its meeting at Dover in September 1899. Foster was elected to represent the University of London in parliament in a by-election in February 1900, and returned unopposed in the 1900 general election held later the same year. He stood for the Liberal Unionist Party, and though returned as a Unionist, his political action was not to be dictated by party considerations, and he gravitated towards Liberalism. He played no prominent part in parliament and at the election of 1906 was defeated. He was joint editor with E. Ray Lankester of The Scientific Memoirs of Thomas Henry Huxley. His chief writings were a Textbook of Physiology (1876), which became a standard work, and Lectures on the History of Physiology during the 16th, 17th and 18th Centuries (1901), which consisted of lectures delivered at the Cooper Medical College, San Francisco, in 1900. He died suddenly in London. Foster was also the binomial author of many iris species. One of many irises he introduced includes Iris lineata Foster ex RegelIris lineata was originally described and published in Gartenflora XXXXVI. (1887) 201, t. 1244. (or A.Regel), which was originally described and published in Gartenflora (1887), and later cited in Curtis's Botanical Magazine (1888).

He was the literary father of what has been called \\"the university school of humour\\". Early life He was born at Martley, Worcestershire, and given the name Charles Stuart Blayds. In 1852, his father, the Rev. Henry Blayds, resumed the old family name of Calverley, which his grandfather had exchanged for Blayds in 1807. Charles went up to Balliol College, Oxford, from Harrow School in 1850, and was soon known in Oxford as the most daring and high-spirited undergraduate of his time. He was a universal favourite, a delightful companion, a brilliant scholar and the playful enemy of all \\"dons.\\" In 1851 he won the Chancellor's prize for Latin verse, but it is said that the entire exercise was written in an afternoon, when his friends had locked him into his rooms, refusing to let him out until he had finished what they were confident would prove the prize poem. A year later, to avoid the consequences of a college escapade (he had been expelled from Oxford), he too changed his name to Calverley and moved to Christ's College, Cambridge. Here he was again successful in Latin verse, the only undergraduate to have won the Chancellor's prize at both universities. In 1856 he took second place in the first class in the Classical Tripos. Later life He was elected fellow of Christ's (1858), published Verses and Translations in 1862, and was called to the bar in 1865. Injuries sustained in a skating accident prevented him from following a professional career, and during the last years of his life he was an invalid. He died of Bright's disease.Collected Works, p. xxxvi. Works Ode to Tobacco (plaque in Cambridge) Nowadays he is best-known (at least in Cambridge, his adoptive home) as the author of the \\"Ode to Tobacco\\" which is to be found on a bronze plaque in Rose Crescent, on the wall of what used to be Bacon's the tobacconist. His Translations into English and Latin appeared in 1866; his Theocritus translated into English Verse in 1869; Fly Leaves in 1872; and Literary Remains in 1885. His Complete Works, with a biographical notice by Walter Joseph Sendall, a contemporary at Christ's and his brother-in-law, appeared in 1901. George W. E. Russell said of him: > He was a true poet; he was one of the most graceful scholars that Cambridge > ever produced; and all his exuberant fun was based on a broad and strong > foundation of Greek, Latin, and English literature.George W. E. Russell, > Collections & Recollections (revised edition, Smith, Elder & Co, 1899), at > page 307. Notes References *  External links   * Index entry for Charles S.

He was the eldest son of the poet Samuel Taylor Coleridge. His sister Sara Coleridge was a poet and translator, and his brother Derwent Coleridge was a scholar and author. Hartley was named after the philosopher David Hartley. Biography =Early life= Hartley was born in Clevedon, a small village near Bristol. His father mentions Hartley in several poems, including the well-known Frost at Midnight, where he addresses him as his \\"babe so beautiful\\", and in his The Nightingale: A Conversation Poem, both of which are concerned with young Hartley's future. In the autumn of 1800 Samuel Taylor Coleridge moved his wife and young son Hartley to the Lake District. They took a home in the vale of Derwentwater, on the bank of the Greta River, about a mile away from Greta Hall, Keswick, the future home of the poet Robert Southey, which was then being built. Hartley spent his early years in the care of Robert Southey at Greta Hall, which possessed the best library in the neighbourhood. Hartley's brother Derwent wrote the following about Hartley's time at Greta Hall: > \\"The unlimited indulgence with which he was treated at Greta Hall, tended, > without doubt, to strengthen the many and strong peculiarities of his > nature, and may perhaps have contributed to that waywardness and want of > control, from which in later-life he suffered so deeply.\\" =Education= Hartley at the age of 10 Hartley received his early education from his father. In 1807 he was taken by his father and William Wordsworth to Coleorton in North West Leicestershire, and then to London. Here he visited the London theatres, and the Tower of London with Walter Scott. He was also introduced to the study of chemistry by Humphry Davy. Hartley spent the next eight years in constant companionship with his younger brother Derwent, at home and at school. Beginning in the summer of 1808 they attended school as day-scholars at Ambleside, under the tutelage of the Rev. John Dawes. During their time at the school they resided in Clappersgate. Their fellow students included the sons of their father's friend, the poet Charles Lloyd. Hartley and Derwent lived in the home of an elderly woman, and enjoyed total freedom in their after-school hours. Hartley, who had no aptitude for sports, spent much of his time reading and taking walks by himself, or telling stories. He had one close friend at the time, a boy named Robert Jameson, not a fellow student, to whom he afterwards addressed a series of sonnets. Somewhere along the way, Hartley conceived the idea of an underground stream of water that would eventually erupt onto the surface, eventually creating a mighty river that would soon attract merchants and land developers, leading to the formation of a new island-continent. He called this imaginary paracosm Ejuxria, and laid out its geography and history with great care, explaining everything to Derwent as he went along. Derwent believed that Hartley kept up Ejuxria into adulthood.'Monkshood', Hartley Coleridge. Bentley's Miscellany, Volume 45]: Charles Dickens, William Harrison Ainsworth, Albert Smith, eds. London: Richard Bentley, New Burlington St., 1859.Rev. F. Jacox, About Ejuxria and Gombroon: Glimpses of Day-Dreamland. In Cues from All Quarters, Or, The Literary Musings of a Clerical Recluse. London: Hodder & Stoughton, 27 Paternoster Row, 1871. In his time at the school, Hartley was in constant contact with William Wordsworth and his family. He pursued his studies of English in Wordsworth's library at Allan Bank in Grasmere. His privilege of studying in the Wordsworth library was continued after the Wordsworth family moved to Rydal Mount. He went to Oxford in 1815, as a scholar of Merton College. From 1816 to 1820 he was in receipt of an exhibition funded from the bequest of James Wood administered by the Worshipful Company of Bowyers of the City of London. Derwent Coleridge made this comment about his brother's time at Oxford: > \\"Though far from a destructive in politics, he was always keenly alive to > what he supposed to be the evils and abuses of the existing state of things > both in Church and State, while he remained constant in his allegiance to > what he believed to be the essentials of both... On all subjects he spoke > his mind, often, through whim or impatience, more than his mind, freely, > without regard to consequences.\\" On a vacation in 1818 Hartley met the poet Chauncy Hare Townshend, who said the following of him: > \\"I cannot easily convey to you the impression of interest which he made on > my mind at that time. There was something so wonderfully original in his > method of expressing himself, that on me, then a young man, and only > cognisant externally of the prose of life, his sayings, all stamped with the > impress of poetry, produced an effect analogous to that which the mountains > of Cumberland, and the scenery of the North, were working on my southern- > born eye and imagination.\\" He had inherited much of his father's character, and his lifestyle was such that, although he was successful in gaining a fellowship at Oriel College, at the close of the probationary year (1820) he was judged to have forfeited it, mainly on the grounds of intemperance. The authorities would not reverse their decision; but they awarded him a gift of ¬£300. This incident deeply saddened his father, who did everything he could to try to get the decision reversed, but without success. Hartley suffered from a dependency on alcohol for the rest of his life. =Career= He then spent two years in London, where he wrote short poems for the London Magazine. It was around this time that he composed the fragment Prometheus, which his father regarded with much interest. His next step was to become a partner in a school at Ambleside, at the suggestion of his family and friends, a venture which he himself carried out with reluctance, but this scheme failed. After a struggle of four or five years, Hartley abandoned teaching, and moved to Grasmere. From 1826 to 1831, he wrote occasionally in Blackwood's Magazine, to which he was introduced by his friend, John Wilson. His contributions to this periodical form part of the general collection of his Essays. In 1830 a Leeds publisher, F. E. Bingley, made a contract with him to write biographies of Yorkshire and Lancashire worthies. These were afterwards republished under the title of Biographia Borealis (1833) and Worthies of Yorkshire and Lancashire (1836). Bingley also printed a volume of his poems in 1833, and Coleridge lived in his house until the contract came to an end through the bankruptcy of the publisher. Nab Cottage, Hartley's home in Rydal, Cumbria From this time, except for two short periods in 1837 and 1838 when he acted as master at Sedbergh School, he lived quietly at Grasmere and (1840‚Äì1849) Rydal, spending his time in study and wanderings about the countryside. His figure was as familiar as Wordsworth's, and he made many friends among the locals. In 1834 he lost his father. Hartley made the following comment about his father's death in a letter to his mother: > \\"though I cannot say that I was much surprised, yet so little had I prepared > my mind for the loss, that it fell upon me as the fulfilment of an > unbelieved prophecy: and even yet, though I know it, I hardly believe it. I > do not feel fatherless. I often find my mind disputing with itself- What > would my father think of this? and when the recollection awakes, that I have > no father, it appears more like a possible evil than an actual bereavement.\\" In 1839 he brought out his edition of Philip Massinger and John Ford, with biographies of both dramatists. The closing decade of Coleridge's life was wasted in what he himself called \\"the woeful impotence of weak resolve\\". On the death of his mother in 1845, he was placed, by means of an annuity on his life, on a footing of complete independence, but he lived for only three more years. Hartley Coleridge's literary reputation chiefly rests on his works of criticism, on his Prometheus, an unfinished lyric drama, and on his sonnets (a form which suited his particular skills).

The label was owned by the Vocalion record company (known in the United Kingdom as the Aeolian Co, Ltd.), and was part of a competitive market for small, inexpensive discs existing at the time in the United Kingdom and Germany. Little Marvel records were sold exclusively at UK Woolworth's chain stores at a retail price of 6d (sixpence). The Woolworth's logo appeared on the label of the discs. The first issues appeared in 1921, at select Woolworth's locations, but in 1923 the product became available at all Woolworth's stores. As with many records of this type, the recording artists are not credited. The labels on the records mention only the song title, the style of music (e.g. foxtrot, waltz), and in some cases the name of the songwriter or composer. The records were popular not only for their price, but also because of the peppiness of the performances. In addition to popular fare, some children's discs were also issued. Most issues paired a popular number which was under copyright and for which royalties were paid, while the other side was a recording of a title under public domain, or with the copyright controlled by the record company.

In the United States and Canada, \\"telephone booth\\" (or \\"phone booth\\") is the commonly used term for the structure, while in the Commonwealth of Nations (particularly the United Kingdom and Australia), it is a \\"telephone box\\" (or \\"phone box\\"). Such a booth usually has lighting, a door to provide privacy, and windows to let others know if the booth is in use. The booth may be furnished with a printed directory of local telephone numbers, and a booth in a formal setting, such as a hotel, may be furnished with paper and pen and even a seat. An outdoor booth may be made of metal and plastic to withstand the elements and heavy use, while an indoor booth (once known as a silence cabinet) may have more elaborate architecture and furnishings. Most outdoor booths feature the name and logo of the telephone service provider. History K6 telephone box Telephone booth in La Crescent, Minnesota, May 2012 Telephone booth with internet access in M√ºnster, Germany. March 2014 Public Phone Booths in Kashmar, Iran The world's first telephone box called \\"Fernsprechkiosk\\", was opened on 12 January 1881 at Potsdamer Platz, Berlin. To use it, one had to buy paper tickets called Telefonbillet which allowed for a few minutes of talking time. In 1899, it was replaced by a coin-operated telephone. William Gray is credited with inventing the coin payphone in the United States in 1889, and George A. Long was its developer. The first telephone booth in London, England, was probably installed near the Staple Inn in High Holborn in May 1903. In the UK, the creation of a national network of telephone boxes commenced in 1920 starting with the K1 which was made of concrete, however the city of Kingston upon Hull is noted for having its individual phone service, Kingston Communications, with cream coloured phone boxes, as opposed to classic royal red in the rest of Britain. Also, The Post Office was forced into allowing a less strident grey with red glazing bars scheme for areas of natural and architectural beauty. Ironically, some of these areas that have preserved their telephone boxes have now painted them red. =Design= An example of a person using a Telstra phone box in Victoria, Australia Starting in the 1970s, pay telephones were less and less commonly placed in booths in the United States. In many cities where they were once common, telephone booths have now been almost completely replaced by non-enclosed pay phones. In the United States, this replacement was caused, at least in part, by an attempt to make the pay telephones more accessible to disabled people. However, in the United Kingdom, telephones remained in booths more often than the non-enclosed setup. Although still fairly common, the number of phone boxes has declined sharply in Britain since the late 1990s due to the boom of mobile phones. Many locations that provide pay-phones mount the phones on kiosks rather than in booths‚Äîthis relative lack of privacy and comfort discourages lengthy calls in high-demand areas such as airports. Special equipment installed in some telephone booths allows a caller to use a computer, a portable fax machine, or a telecommunications device for the deaf. A Telstra payphone booth in Australia that also serves as a Wi-Fi hotspot to access the internet. Paying for the call =Coins= The user of the booth pays for the call by depositing coins into a slot on the telephone. With some telephones the deposit is made before making the call, and the coins are returned if the call attempt is unsuccessful (busy, no answer, etc.). With other types of telephone coins are not deposited until the call has been made and the caller hears their party answer. The deposit of coins then permits two-way conversation to proceed. =Cards= Calls may be paid for by entering a payment code on the telephone's keypad, by swipe-card (\\"Swipe & Call\\") or by using a telephone card. Some pay phones are equipped with a card reader that allows a caller to make payment with a credit card. =Collect call= A caller who possesses no means of payment may have the phone company's operator ask the call recipient if the recipient is willing to make payment for the call; this is known as \\"reversing the charges\\", \\"reverse charged call\\" or a \\"collect call\\". It is also sometimes possible to place a call to a phone booth if the intended recipient is known to be waiting at the booth, but not all phone booths allow such incoming calls. Long before \\"computer hacking\\" was a common phenomenon, creative mischief-makers devised tactics for obtaining free phone usage through a variety of techniques, including several for defeating the electro- mechanical payment mechanisms of telephone booths‚Äîearly methods of phone phreaking. =Emergency calls= Some jurisdictions require phone booths to provide dial-tone first services, allowing coinless access to the emergency telephone number and the switchboard operator, and do not require any coins or credit card payments for dialing such calls (Verizon New York Inc. v. Environmental Control Board of the City of New York, New York State Appellate Division First Department December 29, 2009). Recent developments vandalized KX+ phone box in London Tart cards are often found in phone boxes in London advertising the services of call girls Telephone booth in Brazil, popularly called orelh√£o (\\"big ear\\") because of its format V-Day anniversary celebration in Hampshire Phone booth in North Carolina Booth in an office, for using your own phone. =Wireless services= The increasing use of mobile phones has led to a decreased demand for pay telephones, but the increasing use of laptops is leading to a new kind of service. In 2003, service provider Verizon announced that they would begin offering wireless computer connectivity in the vicinity of their phone booths in Manhattan. As of 2006, the Verizon wifi telephone booth service was discontinued in favor of the more expensive Verizon Wireless' EVDO system. This allows a computer user to connect with remote computer services by means of a short-range device stationed within the booth. The caller pays for usage by means of a pre- arranged account code stored inside the caller's computer. Wireless access is motivating telephone companies to place wireless stations at locations that have traditionally hosted telephone booths, but stations are also appearing in new kinds of locations such as libraries, caf√©s, and trains. Phone booths have been slowly disappearing since the advent of the mobile phone in 1973. =Vandalism= A rise in vandalism in certain regions has prompted several companies to manufacture simpler booths with extremely durable pay phones. =Dual currencies= Most telephone booths in Northern Ireland are able to accept two currencies. They are able to accept both pound sterling and euro coins, due to the proximity to the Republic of Ireland. Similarly, mainly in large cities in Great Britain, certain telephone booths accept both sterling and euro. Other services provided by these booths are internet access, SMS text messaging and ordinary phone services. Most telephone booths in the United States and Canada can accept both American and Canadian 5¬¢, 10¬¢, and 25¬¢ coins, due to their similar size and weight. =Withdrawal of services= Pay phones may still be used by mobile/cellular phone users if their phones become unusable, get stolen, or for other emergency uses. These uses may make the complete disappearance of pay phones in the near future less likely. Often, at least in an emergency, a phone call can be made from a hotel or a shop, making public pay phones less needed. Australia Under the Universal Service Obligation (USO), the Government legally requires telco Telstra to ensure standard phone services and payphones are ‚Äúreasonably accessible to all people in Australia\\". Some communities, particularly in remote regional areas, rely on payphones, as well as people who do not have access to a mobile phone. At their peak in the early 1990s, there were more than 80,000 public phone boxes across the country. By June 30 2016, according to the ACMA there were about 24,000 payphones across Australia. Telstra is continuing to remove them, especially in suburban areas. Belgium In Belgium, majority state-owned telco Belgacom took the last remaining phone booths out of service on 1 June 2015.Belgacom hangs up on Belgium's last phone booths, eurocomms.com; accessed 11 October 2017. Denmark On 13 December 2017 the last three public telephone booths in Denmark had their telephones removed. They were situated in the town of Aarhus. Finland By 2007, Finnet companies and TeliaSonera Finland had discontinued their public telephones, and the last remaining operator Elisa Oyj did that during the beginning of that year. Ireland Eir, the Universal Service Obligation carrier with regard to payphones, has been systematically removing payphones which fall under the minimum requirement for retention, of a rolling average of one minute of usage a day over six months https://www.independent.ie/business/technology/ever-wonder-why-there-are- still-payphones-around-ireland-heres-why-34934483.html As of June 2019, 456 locations retain payphones (with none in the entirety of County Leitrim); down from 1320 in March 2014. https://www.eir.ie/regulatoryinformation/public- payphones/ Jordan In 2004, Jordan became the first country in the world not to have telephone booths generally available. The mobile/cellular phone penetration in that country is so high that telephone booths have hardly been used at all for years. The two private payphone service companies, namely ALO and JPP, closed down, and currently there's no payphone service to speak of. Norway The last functioning phone box in Norway was taken out of service in June 2016. However, 100 of the phone boxes have been preserved around the country and are protected under cultural heritage laws.https://www.ba.no/hva-skjer-i-bergen/telenor/kulturvern/en-ny-tid-venter- kioskene/s/5-8-733933 Sweden The first telephone booth in Sweden was erected in 1890. In 1981 there were 44,000 of them,S√§llsynt telefonkiosk √∂verlever (Swedish) but in 2013, there were only 1,200, with a withdrawal of the last one in 2015.Telefonkiosken tackar f√∂r sig A survey showed that in 2013, only 1% of the population in Sweden used one the previous year. United Kingdom The red telephone kiosk is recognised as a British icon.http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2006/01_january/27/culture.shtml The telephone company BT is steadily removing public telephone kiosks from the streets of the UK. It is permitted to remove a kiosk without consultation provided that there is another kiosk within walking distance. In other cases, it is required to comply with Ofcom rules in consultation with the local authority.http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/consultations/uso/statement/removals.pdf United States In 1999, there were approximately 2 million phone booths in the United States. Only 5% of those remained in service by 2018. About a fifth of America's 100,000 remaining pay phones are in New York, according to the FCC. However, only 4 phone booths remain in New York City, all on Manhattan‚Äôs Upper West Side; the rest have been converted into WiFi hotspots. Incoming calls are no longer available, but outgoing calls are free. In February 2020, the city confirmed that despite a plan to remove dozens of pay phones, the iconic booths would continue to be maintained. =Smoking ban= Following the commencement of the smoking ban in England in 2007, it became illegal to smoke in red telephone boxes (types K2 to K8), due to these boxes being completely enclosed spaces. The smoking ban requires owners to display no smoking signs, which has resulted in BT displaying a no smoking sticker which refer to the telephone box as \\"premises\\". Despite smoking in red telephone boxes being banned, smoking in other telephone boxes remains legal as these boxes are not completely enclosed spaces. =Advertising= Many telephone boxes in the United Kingdom have become locations for advertisements, bearing posters, with the development of \\"StreetTalk\\" by JCDecaux. This is in addition to the ST6 public telephone introduced in 2007 which is designed to feature a phone on one side and a JCDecaux-owned advertising space on the otherside. The advertising pays for the running of the phone. In 2018, the UK Local Government Association drew attention to \\"Trojan\\" telephone boxes. These are telephone boxes whose main purpose is advertising. A loophole in planning law allows these to be erected without planning permission and the LGA is seeking to close this loophole. In popular culture *In comic books published by DC Comics, the telephone booth is occasionally the place where reporter Clark Kent discards his street clothing and transforms into the costumed superhero Superman. Some of the films and television series featuring the character have also used, referenced, or spoofed this plot device. *The BBC science-fiction television series Doctor Who features the TARDIS, a time machine disguised as a Mackenzie Trench-style police box (a phone booth used by police). *La cabina is a disturbing 1972 Spanish short film about a man trapped in a phone booth. Nobody is able to free him, and the whole booth ‚Äî with the man still inside ‚Äî is carted away to a warehouse. *Phone Booth is a 2002 thriller film where a man in a phone booth is targeted by a sniper. *The Bill and Ted films from 1989 (Bill & Ted's Excellent Adventure) and 1991 (Bill & Ted's Bogus Journey) set in San Dimas, CA used a phone booth as a means of time travel and transport of historical figures. *In Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix, Harry and Mr. Weasley enter a London phone booth and dial 62442 (MAGIC). The booth is an elevator used as the visitor's entrance to the Ministry of Magic. *In the famous opening credits to the 1960s T.V. satire comedy Get Smart, Maxwell Smart (played by comedian Don Adams), a Bond-like secret agent a.k.a Agent 86, would go through a corridor, armed with steel doors which would close after his passage, to an American style phone booth in which he would enter, close its door, dial a special number on the rotary dial and, after hanging up, would get lowered into CONTROL's secret offices. *Whilst being constantly interrupted during a phone call by a man waiting to use a phone booth in the 1994 film Dumb and Dumber (Frederick Stoller), Joe 'Mental' Mentalino (Mike Starr) punches him, smashing the glass in the phone booth and knocking the man out.

Early life and education Contrary to popular belief, Collins is not related to funk legend Bootsy Collins, although the two are close friends. Career =Death Row Records= RBX joined Death Row Records in 1992 with his cousins Snoop Dogg and Daz Dillinger of Tha Dogg Pound. A former college student and retail manager, Collins wisely declined to sign blank contracts like his Death Row brethren and his tenure on the label would be brief but memorable. Having made commanding cameos on The Chronic in 1992 and Doggystyle in 1993, RBX left the label in 1994 and signed with the lesser known Premeditated Records. He released The RBX Files in 1995, his debut solo album that was produced by former Chronic production team member Greg \\"Gregski\\" Royal. The album abandoned the popular West coast G-Funk style in favor of a \\"gritty, dungeon-like\\" sound more associated with New York. The single \\"A.W.O.L.\\" was an attack on Death Row, Suge Knight, Dre and others with X comparing the dubious business practices there to the days of Ruthless Records, Jerry Heller, and Eazy-E. In an YouTube interview with VladTV he talked about an altercation over food between him and Suge Knight, where Knight pulled out a gun during the altercation. =Aftermath Entertainment= In 1996, RBX visited Dr. Dre at home and apologized for his harsh words on record and in magazines and immediately signed to Dre's new Aftermath label. He was featured on the 1996 compilation Dr. Dre Presents... The Aftermath on the solo song \\"Blunt Time\\" and the group track \\"East Coast/West Coast Killaz\\" with KRS-One and Nas, with both songs produced by Dre. Lost in the infamous reshuffling of Aftermath in 1998, RBX once again went solo and released his follow up album No Mercy, No Remorse on an independent label in 1999. He reappeared with Aftermath to cameo on Eminem's second album in 2000.

The living species Metasequoia glyptostroboides is native to Lichuan county in Hubei province, China. Although the shortest of the redwoods, it grows to at least in height. Local villagers refer to the original tree from which most others derive as Shui- shan (Ê∞¥ÊùâÔºâ, or \\"water fir\\", which is part of a local shrine. Since its rediscovery in 1944, the dawn redwood has become a popular ornamental, with examples found in various parks in a variety of countries. Together with Sequoia sempervirens (coast redwood) and Sequoiadendron giganteum (giant sequoia) of California, Metasequoia is classified in the Cupressaceae subfamily Sequoioideae. M. glyptostroboides is the only living species in its genus, but three fossil species are known. Sequoioideae and several other genera have been transferred from the former family Taxodiaceae to Cupressaceae based on DNA analysis. Paleontology Metasequoia redwood fossils are known from many areas in the Northern Hemisphere; more than 20 fossil species have been named (some were even identified as the genus Sequoia), but are considered as just three species, M. foxii, M. milleri, and M. occidentalis. Fossils are known from the Cenomanian onwards. During the Paleocene and Eocene, extensive forests of Metasequoia occurred as far north as Strathcona Fiord on Ellesmere Island and sites on Axel Heiberg Island (northern Canada) at around 80¬∞ N latitude. Metasequoia was likely deciduous by this time. Given that the high latitudes in this period were warm and tropical, it is hypothesized that the deciduous trait evolved in response to the unusual light availability patterns, not to major seasonal variations in temperature. During three months in the summer, the sun would shine continuously, while three months of the winter would be complete darkness. It is also hypothesized that the change from evergreen to deciduous trait occurred before colonizing the high latitudes and was the reason Metasequoia was dominant in the north. In LePage et al (2005). Large petrified trunks and stumps of the extinct Metasequoia occidentalis (sometimes identified as Sequoia occidentalis) also make up the major portion of Tertiary fossil plant material in the badlands of western North Dakota. The trees are well known from late Cretaceous to Miocene strata, but no fossils are known after that. Before its discovery, the taxon was believed to have become extinct during the Miocene; when it was discovered extant, it was heralded as a \\"living fossil\\". Appearance Dawn redwood foliage - note opposite arrangement The bark and foliage are similar to Sequoia, but Metasequoia is deciduous like Taxodium distichum (bald cypress), and, similarly, older specimens form wide buttresses on the lower trunk. It is a fast-growing tree to 130‚Äì150 feet (40‚Äì45 m) tall and 6 feet (2 m) in trunk diameter in cultivation so far (with the potential to grow even higher). The leaves are opposite, 0.4-1.25 inches (1‚Äì3 cm) long, and bright fresh green, turning foxy red-brown in fall. The pollen cones are 0.25 inch (6 mm) long, produced on long spikes in early spring; they are only produced on trees growing in regions with hot summers. The cones are globose to ovoid, 0.6-1.0 inches (1.5-2.5 cm) in diameter with 16‚Äì28 scales, arranged in opposite pairs in four rows, each pair at right angles to the adjacent pair; they mature in about 8‚Äì9 months after pollination. Metasequoia has experienced morphological stasis for the past 65 million years: the modern Metasequoia glyptostroboides appears identical to its late Cretaceous ancestors. In LePage et al (2005).  History  Eocene (Ypresian) age M. occidentalis branchlet The fossil of this genus was discovered by Shigeru Miki in 1939. In 1941, Miki published the description of the fossil plant which he gave the name \\"Metasequoia\\". In the winter of the same year, a Chinese botanist Toh Gan (Âπ≤ÈìéÔºâ discovered an unusual big tree in Modaoxi (Á£®ÂàÄÊ∫™; presently, Moudao (Ë∞ãÈÅì), in Lichuan County, Hubei In LePage et al (2005). ). The locals called this tree shui-sha (Ê∞¥Ê°´). Because it was winter, the tree already lost all its leaves, so no specimens were collected by Mr. Gan. In 1942, another botanist, Mr. Zhan Wang (ÁéãÊàòÔºâvisited Modaoxi and collected living specimens. Mr. Wang believed this tree belonged to an known species Glyptostrobus pensilis (Ê∞¥ÊùæÔºâ and filed the specimens away. In 1945, Mr. Wang showed the specimen to botanist Wan-Chun Cheng ÔºàÈÉë‰∏áÈíßÔºâ. Mr. Cheng determined that the tree did not belong to Glyptostrobus pensilis, but was a new species. Mr. Cheng then sent specimen to prominent botanist H.H.Hu, the director of Fan Memorial Institute of Biology. Hu, despite the chaos of war between China and Japan, was still keeping track of international botanic literature. Hu recognized the living specimen was of the same genus of Miki's fossil genus Metasequoia. After more study, Hu and Cheng published the new species Metasequoia glyptostroboides Hu et Cheng) in May 1948 in the Bulletin of Fan Memorial Institute of Biology. The discovery of \\"living fossil\\" instantly attracted attention from botanist around the world. It was widely regarded as \\"the greatest discovery of botany in 20th century\\". In 1948, the Arnold Arboretum of Harvard University, through the help of Hu and Cheng, funded an expedition by Chinese collectors to collect seeds. Soon after, seeds were distributed to various universities and arboreta worldwide for growth trials. Presently, a number of natural Metasequoia populations exist in the hills and wetlands of Hubei's Lichuan County. Most of them are small, with fewer than 30 trees each; however, the largest of them, in Xiaohe Valley, is estimated to consist of around 5,400 trees. A few trees are also said to exist in neighboring Hunan Province.  Metasequoia in gardens, parks and streets  Dawn redwoods are fast-growing trees. They sometimes grow too large in smaller gardens under favorable conditions, but they can be a good choice for a wide range of larger gardens and parks. Although they live in wet sites in their native habitat they will also tolerate dry soils. In Hibberd (1989). Unlike most conifers, their deciduous habit means they do not cast too much shade in winter. They are grown as street trees in London and elsewhere. Strawberry Fields is a landscaped section in New York City's Central Park dedicated to Beatle John Lennon. At the northern end of the lawns are three dawn redwood trees. The trees drop their needles each fall and regrow them each spring, a symbol of eternal renewal. The trees are expected to reach a height of , making them visible from great distances.

It was developed in the 1960s by Soviet psychiatrist Andrei Snezhnevsky and his colleagues, and was used exclusively in the USSR and several Eastern Bloc countries, until the fall of Communism starting in 1989.; ; ; ; ; The diagnosis has long been discredited because of its scientific inadequacy and its use as a means of confining dissenters. It has never been used or recognized outside of Soviet Union, or by international organizations such as the World Health Organization. It is considered a prime example of the political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union. Sluggish schizophrenia was the most infamous of diagnoses used by Soviet psychiatrists, due to its usage against political dissidents. After being discharged from a hospital, persons diagnosed with sluggish schizophrenia were deprived of their civic rights, credibility and employability. The usage of this diagnosis has been internationally condemned. In the Russian version of the 10th revision of the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems (ICD-10), which has long been used throughout present-day Russia, sluggish schizophrenia is no longer listed as a form of schizophrenia, but it is still included as a schizotypal disorder in section F21 of chapter V. According to Sergei Jargin, the same Russian term \\"vyalotekushchaya\\" for sluggish schizophrenia continues to be used and is now translated in English summaries of articles not as \\"sluggish\\" but as \\"slow progressive\\". Development of theory In the 1960s, professor Andrei Snezhnevsky, the most prominent theorist of Soviet psychiatry and director of the Institute of Psychiatry of the USSR Academy of Medical Sciences, developed a novel classification of mental disorders postulating an original set of diagnostic criteria. Snezhnevsky and his colleagues who developed the concept were supported by Soviet psychiatrists Fedor Kondratev, Sergei Semyonov, and Yakov Frumkin. All were members of the \\"Moscow school\\" of psychiatry. A majority of experts believe that the concept was developed under instructions from the Soviet secret service KGB and the Communist Party.  Use against political dissidents  Psychiatric diagnoses such as sluggish schizophrenia were used in the USSR for political purposes; the diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia was most frequently used for Soviet dissidents. Sluggish schizophrenia as a diagnostic category was created to facilitate the stifling of dissidents and was a root of self-deception among psychiatrists to placate their consciences when the doctors acted as a tool of oppression in the name of a political system. American psychiatrist Peter Breggin points out that the term ‚Äúsluggish schizophrenia‚Äù was created to justify involuntary treatment of political dissidents with drugs normally used for psychiatric patients. Critics implied that Snezhnevsky designed the Soviet model of schizophrenia (and this diagnosis) to make political dissent a mental illness. St. Petersburg academic psychiatrist professor Yuri Nuller notes that the concept of Snezhnevsky's school allowed psychiatrists to consider, for example, schizoid psychopathy and even schizoid character traits as early, delayed in their development, stages of the inevitable progredient process, rather than as personality traits inherent to the individual, the dynamics of which might depend on various external factors. The same also applied to a number of other personality disorders. It entailed the extremely broadened diagnostics of sluggish (neurosis-like, psychopathy-like) schizophrenia. Despite a number of its controversial premises, but in line with the traditions of then Soviet science, Snezhnevsky's hypothesis immediately acquired the status of dogma, which was later overcome in other disciplines but firmly stuck in psychiatry. Snezhnevsky's concept, with its dogmatism, proved to be psychologically comfortable for many psychiatrists, relieving them from doubt when making a diagnosis. On the covert orders of the KGB, thousands of social and political reformers‚ÄîSoviet dissidents‚Äîwere incarcerated in mental hospitals after being labelled with diagnoses of sluggish schizophrenia. Snezhnevsky himself diagnosed, or was otherwise involved in, a series of famous dissident cases, and in dozens of cases he personally signed a commission decision on the legal insanity of dissidents who were in fact mentally healthy, including Vladimir Bukovsky, Natalya Gorbanevskaya, Leonid Plyushch, Mikola Plakhotnyuk, and Pyotr Grigorenko. Revaz Korinteli, a professor of the Grigol Robakidze University, says that Snezhnevsky broadened the borders of schizophrenia, and in this connection there was legal and theoretical justification for employing compulsory, involuntary treatment of dissenters in mental hospitals.  Premises for using the diagnosis  According to the Global Initiative on Psychiatry chief executive Robert van Voren, the political abuse of psychiatry in the USSR arose from the concept that people who opposed the Soviet regime were mentally ill (since there was no logical reason to oppose the sociopolitical system considered the best in the world). The diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia furnished a framework for explaining this behavior. This seemed to many Soviet psychiatrists a logical explanation for why someone would be willing to abandon his happiness, family, and career for a conviction so different from what most individuals seemed to believe.  Popularity of diagnosis  Because of diagnoses of sluggish schizophrenia, Russia in 1974 had 5‚Äì7 cases of schizophrenia per 1,000 population, compared to 3‚Äì4 per 1,000 in the United Kingdom. In the 1980s, Russia had three times as many schizophrenic patients per capita as the USA, twice as many schizophrenic patients as West Germany, Austria and Japan, and more schizophrenic patients than any Western country. The city with the highest diagnosed prevalence of schizophrenia in the world was Moscow. Along with paranoia, sluggish schizophrenia was the diagnosis most frequently used for the psychiatric incarceration of dissenters. Darrel Regier of the National Institute of Mental Health, one of the U.S. experts who visited Soviet psychiatric hospitals in 1989, testified that a \\"substantial number\\" of political dissenters had been recognized as mentally sick on the basis of such symptoms as \\"anti-Soviet thoughts\\" or \\"delusions of reformism\\". According to Moscow psychiatrist Alexander Danilin, the nosological approach in the Moscow psychiatric school established by Andrei Snezhnevsky (whom Danilin considered a state criminal) boiled down to the ability to diagnose schizophrenia.  Systematics by Snezhnevsky  The Soviet model of schizophrenia is based on the hypothesis that a fundamental characteristic (by which schizophrenia spectrum disorders are distinguished clinically) is its longitudinal course. The hypothesis implies three main types of schizophrenia: *Continuous: unremitting, proceeding rapidly (\\"malignant\\") or slowly (\\"sluggish\\"), with a poor prognosis *Periodic (or recurrent): characterized by an acute attack, followed by full remission with little or no progression *Mixed (; in German, schub means \\"phase\\" or \\"attack\\"): mixture of continuous and periodic types which occurs periodically and is characterized by only partial remission. The classification of schizophrenia types attributed to Snezhnevsky is still used in Russia, and considers sluggish schizophrenia an example of the continuous type. The prevalence of Snezhnevsky's theories has particularly led to a broadening of the boundaries of disease such that even the mildest behavioral change is interpreted as indication of mental disorder. = Conditions posed as symptoms = A carefully crafted description of sluggish schizophrenia established that psychotic symptoms were non-essential for the diagnosis, but symptoms of psychopathy, hypochondria, depersonalization or anxiety were central to it. Symptoms considered part of the \\"negative axis\\" included pessimism, poor social adaptation and conflict with authorities, and were themselves sufficient for a formal diagnosis of \\"sluggish schizophrenia with few symptoms\\". According to Snezhnevsky, patients with sluggish schizophrenia could present as seemingly sane but manifest minimal (and clinically relevant) personality changes which could remain unnoticed by the untrained eye. Patients with non-psychotic mental disorders (or who were not mentally ill) could be diagnosed with sluggish schizophrenia. Harold Merskey and Bronislava Shafran write that many conditions which would probably be diagnosed elsewhere as hypochondriacal or personality disorders, anxiety disorders or depressive disorders appear liable to come under the banner of slowly progressive schizophrenia in Snezhnevsky's system. The incidence of sluggish schizophrenia increased because, according to Snezhnevsky and his colleagues, patients with this diagnosis were capable of socially functioning almost normally. Their symptoms could resemble those of a neurosis or paranoia. Patients with paranoid symptoms retained insight into their condition, but overestimated their significance and had grandiose ideas of reforming society. Sluggish schizophrenia could have such symptoms as \\"reform delusions\\", \\"perseverance\\" and \\"struggle for the truth\\". As Viktor Styazhkin reported, Snezhnevsky diagnosed a reform delusion in every case where a patient \\"develops a new principle of human knowledge, drafts an ideal of human happiness or other projects for the benefit of mankind\\". During the 1960s and 1970s, theories which contained ideas about reforming society, struggling for the truth, and religious convictions were not considered delusional paranoid disorders in nearly any foreign classifications; however, Soviet psychiatry (for ideological reasons) considered critiques of the political system and proposals to reform it as delusional behavior. The diagnoses of sluggish schizophrenia and paranoid states with delusions of reform were used only in the Soviet Union and several Eastern European countries. An audience member at a lecture by Georgi Morozov on forensic psychiatry in the Serbsky Institute asked, ‚ÄúTell us, Georgi Vasilevich, what is actually the diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia?‚Äù Since the question was asked ironically Morozov replied ironically: ‚ÄúYou know, dear colleagues, this is a very peculiar disease. There are not delusional disorders, there are not hallucinations, but there is schizophrenia!‚Äù The two Soviet psychiatrists Marat Vartanyan and Andrei Mukhin in their interview to the Soviet newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda issued on 15 July 1987 explained how it was possible that a person might be mentally ill, while people surrounding him did not notice it, for example, in the case of \\"sluggish schizophrenia\\". What was meant by saying that a person is mentally ill? Marat Vartanyan said, \\"‚Ä¶ When a person is obsessively occupied with something. If you discuss another subject with him, he is a normal person who is healthy, and who may be your superior in intelligence, knowledge and eloquence. But as soon as you mention his favourite subject, his pathological obsessions flare up wildly.\\" Vartanyan confirmed that hundreds of people with this diagnosis were hospitalized in the Soviet Union. According to Mukhin, it took place because \\"they disseminate their pathological reformist ideas among the masses.\\" A few months later the same newspaper listed \\"an exceptional interest in philosophical systems, religion and art\\" among symptoms of sluggish schizophrenia from a Manual on Psychiatry of Snezhnevsky's Moscow school.  Recognizing method, treatment and study  The Leningrad Special Psychiatric Hospital of Prison Type of the USSR Ministry of Internal Affairs where Vladimir Bukovsky, Pyotr Grigorenko, Alexander Yesenin-Volpin and Viktor Fainberg were imprisoned was one of the psychiatric hospitals of a special type used to \\"treat\\" litigiousness and reformism Only specially instructed psychiatrists could recognize sluggish schizophrenia to indefinitely treat dissenters in a \\"Special Psychiatric Hospital\\" with heavy doses of antipsychotic medication. Convinced of the immortality of the totalitarian USSR, Soviet psychiatrists, especially in Moscow, did not hesitate to form \\"scientific\\" articles and defend dissertations by using the cases of dissidents. For example, Snezhnevsky diagnosed dissident Vladimir Bukovsky as schizophrenic on 5 July 1962 and on 12 November 1971 wrote to writer Viktor Nekrasov that the characteristics of Bukovsky's mental disease were included in the dissertation by Snezhnevsky's colleague. All the paper products were available in medical libraries. As Semyon Gluzman recollects, when he returned to Kiev in 1982 after his absence of ten years, he was amazed to see all this \\"scientific\\" literature in open storage at the Kiev medical library and was even more amazed to read all the \\"ridiculous stuff\\" hardly put into scientific psychiatric terminology. In their papers and dissertations on treatment for litigiousness and reformism, Kosachyov and other Soviet psychiatrists recommended compulsory treatment for persons with litigiousness and reformism, in the same psychiatric hospitals used for murderers:  Western criticism  Westerners first became aware of sluggish schizophrenia and its political uses in the mid-1970s, as a result of the high reported incidence of schizophrenia in the Russian population. Snezhnevsky was personally attacked in the West as an example of psychiatric abuse in the USSR. He was charged with cynically developing a system of diagnosis that could be bent for political purposes. American psychiatrist Alan A. Stone stated that Western criticism of Soviet psychiatry focused on Snezhnevsky personally because he was responsible for the diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia for \\"reformism\\" and other such symptoms.  Recurrence in post-Soviet Russia  In 2010, Yuri Savenko, the president of the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia, warned that Professor Anatoly Smulevich, author of the monographs Problema Paranoyi (The Problem of Paranoia) (1972) and Maloprogredientnaya Shizofreniya (Continuous Sluggish Schizophrenia) (1987), which had contributed to the hyperdiagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia, had again begun to play the same role. Under his influence, therapists have begun to widely use antidepressants and antipsychotics but often in inadequate cases and in inappropriate doses, without consulting psychiatrists. This situation has opened up a huge new market for pharmaceutical firms, and the flow of the mentally ill to internists. In their joint book Sociodinamicheskaya Psikhiatriya (Sociodynamic Psychiatry), Doctor of Medical Sciences professor of psychiatry Caesar Korolenko and Doctor of Psychological Sciences Nina Dmitrieva note that Smulevich's clinical description of sluggish schizophrenia is extremely elusive and includes almost all possible changes in mental status and conditions that occur in a person without psychopathology: euphoria, hyperactivity, unfounded optimism, irritability, explosiveness, sensitivity, inadequacy and emotional deficit, hysterical reactions with conversive and dissociative symptoms, infantilism, obsessive-phobic states and stubbornness. At present, the hyperdiagnosis of schizophrenia becomes especially negative due to a large number of schizophreniform psychoses caused by the increasing popularity of various esoteric sects. They practice meditation, sensory deprivation, special exercises with rhythmic movements which directly stimulate the deep subconscious and, by doing so, lead to the development of psychoses with mainly reversible course. Smulevich bases the diagnosis of continuous sluggish schizophrenia, in particular, on appearance and lifestyle and stresses that the forefront in the picture of negative changes is given to the contrast between retaining mental activity (and sometimes quite high capacity for work) and mannerism, unusualness of one's appearance and entire lifestyle. In his 2014 interview, Anatoly Smulevich says, \\"Now everything has slightly turned in a different way, sluggish schizophrenia has been transformed into schizotypal disorder, etc. I think it is not the end of his [Snezhnevsky's] teaching, because after a while, everything will get back into a rut, but it will not be a simple repetition but will get some new direction.\\" In 2009, Tatyana Dmitrieva, the then director of the Serbsky Center, said to the BBC Russian Service, \\"A diagnosis is now made only according to the international classification, so called ICD-10. In this classification, there is no sluggish schizophrenia, and therefore, even this diagnosis has not just been made for a long time.\\" However, according to the 2012 interview by the president of the Ukrainian Psychiatric Association Semyon Gluzman to Radio Liberty, though the diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia no longer exists in Ukraine, in Russia, as far as he knows, this diagnosis still exists, and was given to Mikhail Kosenko, one of the accused in the Bolotnaya Square case. The prosecution's case for his forced hospitalization rested on confirmation of the diagnosis of sluggish schizophrenia that he has been treated for over the last 12 years, until 2013 when the diagnosis was changed to that of paranoid schizophrenia by the Serbsky Center experts who examined Kosenko and convinced the court to send him for compulsory treatment to a psychiatric hospital. Zurab Kekelidze (ru), who heads the Serbsky Center and is the chief psychiatrist of the Ministry of Health and Social Development of the Russian Federation, confirmed that Kosenko was diagnosed with sluggish schizophrenia. According to the commentary by the Independent Psychiatric Association of Russia on the 2007 text by Vladimir Rotstein, a doctrinist of Snezhnevsky's school, there are sufficient patients with delusion of reformism in psychiatric inpatient facilities for involuntary treatment. In 2012, delusion of reformism was mentioned as a symptom of mental disorder in Psychiatry: National Manual. In the same year, Vladimir Pashkovsky in his paper reported that he diagnosed 4.7 percent of 300 patients with delusion of reform. As Russian sociologist Alexander Tarasov wrote, \\"you will be treated in a hospital so that you and all your acquaintances get to learn forever that only such people as Anatoly Chubais or German Gref can be occupied with reforming in our country.\\" According to Raimonds Krumgolds, a former member of the political party The Other Russia, he was examined because of his \\"delusion of reformism\\", which gave rise to an assumption of slow progressive schizophrenia. In 2012, Tyuvina and Balabanova in their joint paper reported that they used sulpiride to treat slow progressive schizophrenia.

It is a shared information infrastructure for locating, managing, administering and organizing everyday items and network resources, which can include volumes, folders, files, printers, users, groups, devices, telephone numbers and other objects. A directory service is a critical component of a network operating system. A directory server or name server is a server which provides such a service. Each resource on the network is considered an object by the directory server. Information about a particular resource is stored as a collection of attributes associated with that resource or object. A directory service defines a namespace for the network. The namespace is used to assign a name (unique identifier) to each of the objects. Directories typically have a set of rules determining how network resources are named and identified, which usually includes a requirement that the identifiers be unique and unambiguous. When using a directory service, a user does not have to remember the physical address of a network resource; providing a name locates the resource. Some directory services include access control provisions, limiting the availability of directory information to authorized users.  Comparison with relational databases  Several things distinguish a directory service from a relational database. Data can be redundant if it aids performance. Directory schemas are object classes, attributes, name bindings and knowledge (namespaces) where an object class has: * Must - attributes that each instances must have * May - attributes which can be defined for an instance but can be omitted, with the absence similar to NULL in a relational database Attributes are sometimes multi-valued, allowing multiple naming attributes at one level (such as machine type and serial number concatenation, or multiple phone numbers for \\"work phone\\"). Attributes and object classes are usually standardized throughout the industry; for example, X.500 attributes and classes are often formally registered with the IANA for their object ID. Therefore, directory applications try to reuse standard classes and attributes to maximize the benefit of existing directory-server software. Object instances are slotted into namespaces; each object class inherits from its parent object class (and ultimately from the root of the hierarchy), adding attributes to the must-may list. Directory services are often central to the security design of an IT system and have a correspondingly-fine granularity of access control.  Replication and distribution  Replication and distribution have distinct meanings in the design and management of a directory service. Replication is used to indicate that the same directory namespace (the same objects) are copied to another directory server for redundancy and throughput reasons; the replicated namespace is governed by the same authority. Distribution is used to indicate that multiple directory servers in different namespaces are interconnected to form a distributed directory service; each namespace can be governed by a different authority.  Implementations  Directory services were part of an Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) initiative for common network standards and multi-vendor interoperability. During the 1980s, the ITU and ISO created a set of standards for directory services, initially to support the requirements of inter-carrier electronic messaging and network-name lookup. The Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) is based on the X.500 directory-information services, using the TCP/IP stack and an X.500 Directory Access Protocol (DAP) string-encoding scheme on the Internet. Systems developed before the X.500 include: * Domain Name System (DNS): The first directory service on the Internet, still in use * Hesiod: Based on DNS and used at MIT's Project Athena * Network Information Service (NIS): Originally Yellow Pages (YP) Sun Microsystems' implementation of a directory service for Unix network environments. It played a role similar to Hesiod. * NetInfo: Developed by NeXT during the late 1980s for NEXTSTEP. After its acquisition by Apple, it was released as open source and was the directory service for Mac OS X before it was deprecated for the LDAP-based Open Directory. Support for NetInfo was removed with the release of 10.5 Leopard. * Banyan VINES: First scalable directory service * NT Domains: Developed by Microsoft to provide directory services for Windows machines before the release of the LDAP-based Active Directory in Windows 2000. Windows Vista continues to support NT Domains after relaxing its minimum authentication protocols. = LDAP implementations = LDAP/X.500-based implementations include: * 389 Directory Server: Free Open Source server implementation by Red Hat, with commercial support by Red Hat and SUSE. * Active Directory: Microsoft's directory service for Windows, originating from the X.500 directory, created for use in Exchange Server, first shipped with Windows 2000 Server and supported by successive versions of Windows * Apache Directory Server: Directory service, written in Java, supporting LDAP, Kerberos 5 and the Change Password Protocol; LDAPv3 certified * Apple Open Directory: Apple's directory server for Mac OS X, available through Mac OS X Server * eDirectory: NetIQ's implementation of directory services supports multiple architectures, including Windows, NetWare, Linux and several flavours of Unix and is used for user administration and configuration and software management; previously known as Novell Directory Services. * Red Hat Directory Server: Red Hat released Red Hat Directory Server, acquired from AOL's Netscape Security Solutions unit, as a commercial product running on top of Red Hat Enterprise Linux as the community-supported 389 Directory Server project.

Life Drummond was born at Hawthornden Castle, Midlothian, to John Drummond, the first laird of Hawthornden, and Susannah Fowler, sister of the poet and courtier William Fowler and daughter of Janet Fockart. Sir Robert Drummond of Carnock, one-time Master of Work to the Crown of Scotland, was his grandfather. Drummond received his early education at the Royal High School of Edinburgh, and graduated in July 1605 as M.A. of the recently founded University of Edinburgh. His father was a gentleman usher at the English court (as he had been at the Scottish court from 1590) and William, in a visit to London in 1606, describes the festivities in connection with the visit of the king of Denmark. Drummond spent two years at Bourges and Paris in the study of law; and, in 1609, he was again in Scotland, where, by the death of his father in the following year, he became laird of Hawthornden at the early age of 24. The list of books he read up to this time is preserved in his own handwriting. It indicates a strong preference for imaginative literature, and shows that he was keenly interested in contemporary verse. His collection (now in the library of the University of Edinburgh) contains many first editions of the most famous productions of the age. On finding himself his own master, Drummond naturally abandoned law for the muses; \\"for,\\" says his biographer in 1711, \\"the delicacy of his wit always run on the pleasantness and usefulness of history, and on the fame and softness of poetry\\". In 1612 began his correspondence with Sir William Alexander of Menstrie, afterwards Earl of Stirling, which ripened into a lifelong friendship after Drummond's visit to Menstrie in 1614. Drummond's first publication appeared in 1613, an elegy on the death of Henry, Prince of Wales, called Teares on the Death of Meliades (Moeliades, 3rd edit. 1614). The poem shows the influence of Spenser's and Sidney's pastoralism. In the same year he published an anthology of the elegies of Chapman, Wither and others, entitled Mausoleum, or The Choisest Flowres of the Epitaphs. In 1616, the year of Shakespeare's death, appeared Poems: Amorous, Funerall, Divine, Pastorall: in Sonnets, Songs, Sextains, Madrigals, being substantially the story of his love for Mary Cunningham of Barns, who was about to become his wife when she died in 1615. The poems bear marks of a close study of Sidney, and of the Italian poets. He sometimes translates direct from the Italian, especially from Giambattista Marino. Forth Feasting: A Panegyricke to the King's Most Excellent Majestie (1617), a poem written in heroic couplets of remarkable facility, celebrates James's visit to Scotland in that year. In 1618 Drummond began a correspondence with Michael Drayton. The two poets continued to write at intervals for thirteen years, the last letter being dated in the year of Drayton's death. The latter had almost been persuaded by his \\"dear Drummond\\" to print the later books of Poly-Olbion at Hart's Edinburgh press. In the winter of 1618‚Äì1619, Drummond had included Ben Jonson in his circle of literary friends, and at Christmas 1618 was honoured with a visit of a fortnight or more from the dramatist. The account of their conversations, long supposed to be lost, was discovered in the Advocates' Library, Edinburgh, by David Laing, and was edited for the Shakespeare Society in 1842 and printed by Gifford & Cunningham. The conversations are full of literary gossip, and embody Jonson's opinion of himself and of his host, whom he frankly told that \\"his verses were too much of the schooles, and were not after the fancie of the time,\\" and again that he \\"was too good and simple, and that oft a man's modestie made a fool of his witt\\". But the publication of what was obviously intended merely for a private journal has given Jonson an undeserved reputation for harsh judgements, and has cast blame on Drummond for blackening his guest's memory. In 1623 appeared the poet's fourth publication, entitled Flowers of Sion: By William Drummond of Hawthornedenne: to which is adjoyned his Cypresse Grove. From 1625 till 1630 Drummond was probably for the most part engaged in travelling on the Continent. On 29 September 1626 he received a sixteen patents for diverse devices, mainly military. These included Glasses of Archimedes which could set ships afire at sea and an early form of machine gun \\"in which a number of musket barrels are fastened together in such a manner as to allow one man to take the place of a hundred musketeers in battle.The Social History of the Machine Gun, by John Ellis, Croom Helm, London 1975, p. 11 However, there is no evidence that he actually produced any of these devices. In 1627, however, he seems to have been home for a short time, as, in that year, he appears in the entirely new character of the holder of a patent for the construction of military machines, entitled \\"Litera Magistri Gulielmi Drummond de Fabrica Machinarum Militarium, Anno 1627\\". The same year, 1627, is the date of Drummond's munificent gift (referred to above) of about 500 volumes to the library of the University of Edinburgh. In 1630 Drummond again began to reside permanently at Hawthornden, and in 1632 he married Elizabeth Logan, by whom he had five sons and four daughters. In 1633 Charles made his coronation-visit to Scotland; and Drummond's pen was employed in writing congratulatory speeches and verses. He was involved in organising the King's triumphal procession through Edinburgh.Restoring the Temple of Vision by Marsha Keith Schuchard, Brill 2002 As Drummond preferred Episcopacy to Presbytery, and was an extremely loyal subject, he supported Charles's general policy, though he protested against the methods employed to enforce it. When John Elphinstone, 2nd Lord Balmerino was put on his trial on the capital charge of retaining in his possession a petition regarded as a libel on the king's government, Drummond in an energetic \\"Letter\\" (1635) urged the injustice and folly of the proceedings. About this time a claim by the earl of Menteith to the earldom of Strathearn, which was based on the assertion that Robert III, husband of Annabella Drummond, was illegitimate, roused the poet's pride of blood and prompted him to prepare an historical defence of his house. The burial vault of William Drummond of Hawthornden, Lasswade Kirkyard Plaque to William Drummond dating from the restoration of his vault in 1892 Partly to please his kinsman the earl of Perth, and partly to satisfy his own curiosity, the poet made researches in the genealogy of the family. This investigation was the real secret of Drummond's interest in Scottish history; and so we find that he now began his History of Scotland during the Reigns of the Five Jameses, a work which did not appear till 1655, and is remarkable only for its good literary style. His next work was called forth by the king's enforced submission to the opposition of his Scottish subjects. It is entitled Irene: or a Remonstrance for Concord, Amity, and Love amongst His Majesty's Subjects (1638), and embodies Drummond's political creed of submission to authority as the only logical refuge from democracy, which he hated. In 1639 Drummond had to sign the Covenant in self-protection, but was uneasy under the burden, as several political squibs by him testify. In 1643 he published Œ£Œ∫ŒπŒ±ŒºŒ±œáŒØŒ±: or a Defence of a Petition tendered to the Lords of the Council of Scotland by certain Noblemen and Gentlemen, a political pamphlet in support of those royalists in Scotland who wished to espouse the king's cause against the English parliament. Its burden is an invective on the intolerance of the then dominant Presbyterian clergy. His later works may be described briefly as royalist pamphlets, written with more or less caution, as the times required. Drummond took the part of Montrose; and a letter from the Royalist leader in 1646 acknowledged his services. He also wrote a pamphlet, A Vindication of the Hamiltons, supporting the claims of the Duke of Hamilton to lead the Scottish army which was to release Charles I. It is said that Drummond's health received a severe shock when news was brought of the king's execution. He died on 4 December 1649. He was buried in a stone vault in his parish church of Lasswade. His tomb was restored in the 1880s and a bronze relief added over the entrance. Public Memorials Drummond is one of the sixteen poets and writers whose heads appear on the Scott Monument on Princes Street in Edinburgh. He appears on the far right side on the north face. Works Drummond's most important works are the Cypresse Grove and the poems. The Cypresse Grove exhibits great wealth of illustration, and an extraordinary command of musical English. It is an essay on the folly of the fear of death. \\"This globe of the earth,\\" says he, \\"which seemeth huge to us, in respect of the universe, and compared with that wide pavilion of heaven; is less than little, of no sensible quantity, and but as a point.\\" This is one of Drummond's favourite moods; and he uses constantly in his poems such phrases as \\"the All,\\" \\"this great All.\\" Even in such of his poems as may be called more distinctively Christian, this philosophic conception is at work. A noteworthy feature in Drummond's poetry, as in that of his courtier contemporaries Aytoun, Lord Stirling and others, is that it manifests no characteristic Scottish element, but owes its birth and inspiration rather to the English and Italian masters. Drummond was essentially a follower of Spenser, but, amid all his sensuousness, and even in those lines most conspicuously beautiful, there is a dash of melancholy thoughtfulness‚Äîa tendency deepened by the death of his first love, Mary Cunningham. Drummond was called \\"the Scottish Petrarch\\"; and his sonnets, which are the expression of a genuine passion, stand far above most of the contemporary Petrarcan imitations. A remarkable burlesque poem Polemo Middinia inter Vitarvam et Nebernam (printed anonymously in 1684) has been persistently, and with good reason, ascribed to him. It is a mock-heroic tale, in macaronic Latin enriched with Scottish Gaelic expressions, of a country feud on the Fife lands of his old friends the Cunninghams. English composer Gerald Finzi's Three Short Elegies Op. 5 (1926) consists of musical settings for unaccompanied chorus of three of Drummond's poems: \\"Life a Right Shadow Is\\", \\"This World A Hunting Is\\" and \\"This Life, Which Seems So Fair\\".

He is also known as the \\"Hero of Quit India Movement\\" and he is remembered for leading the mid-1970s opposition against Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, for whose overthrow he had called for a \\"total revolution\\". His biography, Jayaprakash, was written by his nationalist friend and an eminent writer of Hindi literature, Rambriksh Benipuri. In 1999, he was posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, in recognition of his social work. Other awards include the Magsaysay award for Public Service in 1965. Early life Jayprakash Narayan was born on 11 October 1902 in the village of Sitabdiara, Saran district, Bengal Presidency, British India (present-day Ballia district, Uttar Pradesh, India). Sitabdiara is a large village, straddling two states and three districts ‚Äî Saran and Bhojpur in Bihar and Ballia in Uttar Pradesh. His house was near the banks of the flood-prone Ghaghara river. Every time the river swelled, the house would get a little bit damaged, eventually forcing the family to move a few kilometres away to a settlement which is now known as Jay Prakash Nagar and falls in Uttar Pradesh. He came from a Kayastha family. He was the fourth child of Harsu Dayal and Phul Rani Devi. His father Harsu Dayal was a junior official in the Canal Department of the State government and was often touring the region. When Narayan was 9 years old, he left his village to enroll in the 7th class of the collegiate school at Patna. This was his first break from village life. JP stayed at a student hostel‚ÄîSaraswati Bhawan‚Äîin which most of the boys were a bit older. Among them were some of Bihar's future leaders including its first chief minister, Krishna Singh, his deputy Anugrah Narayan Sinha and several others who were to widely become known in politics and academic world. In October 1920, 18-year-old Narayan married Braj Kishore Prasad's 14-year-old daughter Prabhavati Devi, a freedom fighter in her own right., their ages being normal marriageable ages at those times. After their wedding, since Narayan was working in Patna and it was difficult for his wife to stay with him, on the invitation of Gandhi, Prabhavati became an inmate at Sabarmati Ashram (Ahmedabad). Jayaprakash, along with some friends, went to listen to Maulana Abul Kalam Azad speak about the Non-co-operation movement launched by Gandhi against the passing of the Rowlatt Act of 1919. The Maulana was a brilliant orator and his call to give up English education was \\"like leaves before a storm: Jayaprakash was swept away and momentarily lifted up to the skies. That brief experience of soaring up with the winds of a great idea left imprints on his inner being\\". Jayaprakash took the Maulana's words to heart and left Bihar National College with just 20 days remaining for his examinations. Jayaprakash joined the Bihar Vidyapeeth, a college founded by Rajendra Prasad and became among the first students of Gandhian Anugraha Narayan Sinha. = Higher education in the United States = After exhausting the courses at the Vidyapeeth, Jayaprakash decided to continue studies in the United States. At age 20, Jayaprakash sailed aboard the cargo ship Janus while Prabhavati remained at Sabarmati. Jayaprakash reached California on 8 October 1922 and was admitted to Berkeley in January 1923. To pay for his education, Jayaprakash picked grapes, set them out to dry, packed fruits at a canning factory, washed dishes, worked as a mechanic at a garage and at a slaughterhouse, sold lotions and taught. All these jobs gave Jayaprakash an insight into the difficulties of the working class. After a semester studying chemistry at UC Berkeley, Jayaprakash was forced to transfer to The University of Iowa when fees at Berkeley were doubled. He was forced to transfer to many universities thereafter. He pursued his favourite subject, sociology, and received much help from Professor Edward Ross. In Wisconsin, Jayaprakash was introduced to Karl Marx's Das Kapital. News of the success of the Russian revolution of 1917 made Jayaprakash conclude that Marxism was the way to alleviate the suffering of the masses. He delved into books by Indian intellectual and Communist theoretician M. N. Roy. His paper on sociology, Cultural VariationNarayan, JP. Cultural variation. Diss. The Ohio State University, 1929., was declared the best of the year. Politics Narayan with Israeli Prime Minister David Ben-Gurion in Tel Aviv, 1958 Narayan returned from the US to India in late 1929 as a Marxist. He joined the Indian National Congress on the invitation of Jawaharlal Nehru in 1929; Mahatma Gandhi became his mentor in the Congress. He shared a house at Kadam Kuan in Patna with his close friend and nationalist Ganga Sharan Singh (Sinha). with whom he shared the most cordial and lasting friendship. He won particular fame during the Quit India movement. After being jailed in 1932 for civil disobedience against British rule, Narayan was imprisoned in Nasik Jail, where he met Ram Manohar Lohia, Minoo Masani, Achyut Patwardhan, Ashok Mehta, Basawon Singh (Sinha), Yusuf Desai, C K Narayanaswami and other national leaders. After his release, the Congress Socialist Party, or (CSP), a left- wing group within the Congress, was formed with Acharya Narendra Deva as President and Narayan as General secretary. When Mahatma Gandhi launched the Quit India Movement in August 1942, Yogendra Shukla scaled the wall of Hazaribagh Central Jail along with Jayaprakash Narayan, Suraj Narayan Singh, Gulab Chand Gupta, Pandit Ramnandan Mishra, Shaligram Singh and Shyam Barthwar, with a goal to start an underground movement for freedom. Many young socialist leaders like Ram Manohar Lohia, Chhotubhai Puranik, Aruna Asaf Ali, etc. took part in underground movement. As Jayaprakash Narayan was ill, Yogendra Shukla walked to Gaya with Jayaprakash Narayan on his shoulders, a distance of about 124 kilometres.Distance between Hazaribagh Central Jail and Gaya. Maps.google.co.in. Retrieved on 20 November 2018. He also served as the Chairman of Anugrah Smarak Nidhi (Anugrah Narayan Memorial Fund). Between 1947 and 1953, Jayaprakash Narayan was President of All India Railwaymen's Federation, the largest labour union in the Indian Railways. Bihar Movement and Total Revolution Narayan returned to prominence in State politics in the late 1960s. 1974 ushered in a year of high inflation, unemployment and lack of supplies and essential commodities. Nav Nirman Andolan movement of Gujarat asked Jayaprakash to lead a peaceful agitation. Following Jayaprakash Narayan's call for social justice, and a demand for dissolution of the Bihar assembly. The Bihar government used brutal force to suppress the movement and on 18 March 1974, police fired on unarmed demonstrators and eight people were killed in police firing. On 8 April 1974, aged 72, he led a silent procession at Patna. As, Jayaprakash Narayan crossed the barricaded area followed by Satyendra Narain Sinha, Shyam Nandan Mishra, Digvijay Narayan Singh & B.R. Chandwar, the procession was lathi charged. On 5 June 1974, Jayaprakash addressed a large crowd at Gandhi Maidan in Patna. He declared, \\"This is a revolution, friends! We are not here merely to see the Vidhan Sabha dissolved. That is only one milestone on our journey. But we have a long way to go... After 27 years of freedom, people of this country are wracked by hunger, rising prices, corruption... oppressed by every kind of injustice... it is a Total Revolution we want, nothing less!\\" In 1974, he led the students' movement in the state of Bihar which gradually developed into a popular people's movement known as the Bihar Movement. It was during this movement that JP gave a call for peaceful Total Revolution. Together with V. M. Tarkunde, he founded the Citizens for Democracy in 1974 and the People's Union for Civil Liberties in 1976, both NGOs, to uphold and defend civil liberties. Emergency Indira Gandhi was found guilty of violating electoral laws by the Allahabad High Court. Narayan called for Indira and the CMs to resign and the military and police to disregard unconstitutional and immoral orders. He advocated a program of social transformation which he termed Sampoorna kraanti, \\"total revolution\\". Immediately afterwards, Gandhi proclaimed a national Emergency on the midnight of 25 June 1975. Desai, opposition leaders, and dissenting members of her own party were arrested that day. Jayaprakash Narayan attracted a gathering of 100,000 people at the Ramlila grounds and thunderously recited Rashtrakavi Ramdhari Singh 'Dinkars wonderfully evocative poetry: Singhasan Khaali Karo Ke Janata Aaati Hai. Narayan was kept as detenu at Chandigarh even after he asked for one month parole to mobilise relief in flooded parts of Bihar. His health suddenly deteriorated on 24 October, and he was released on 12 November; diagnosis at Jaslok Hospital, Bombay, revealed kidney failure; he would be on dialysis for the rest of his life. In the UK, Surur Hoda launched the \\"Free JP\\" campaign chaired by Nobel Peace Prize winner Noel-Baker for the release of Jayaprakash Narayan. Indira Gandhi revoked the emergency on 18 January 1977 and announced elections. The Janata Party, a vehicle for the broad spectrum of the opposition to Indira Gandhi, was formed under JP's guidance. The Janata Party was voted into power and became the first non-Congress party to form a government at the Centre. On the call of Narayan, many youngsters joined the JP movement. Death Narayan died in Patna, Bihar, on 8 October 1979, three days before his 77th birthday, due to effects of diabetes and heart ailments. In March 1979, while he was in hospital, his death had been erroneously announced by the Indian prime minister, Morarji Desai, causing a grief wave of national mourning, including the suspension of parliament and regular radio broadcasting, and the closure of schools and shops. When he was told about the gaffe a few weeks later, he smiled. Family At the age of 17, Jayaprakash was married to Prabhavati Devi, daughter of lawyer and nationalist Brij Kishore Prasad in October 1919. Prabhavati was very independent and on Gandhi's invitation, went to stay at his ashram while Jayaprakash continued his studies. Prabhavati Devi died on 15 April 1973 after a long battle with cancer.

Early life Higginson was born in 1826 in Marlow, Buckinghamshire, England. He was the son of General George Powell Higginson, Grenadier Guards, who distinguished himself at the Battle of Corunna, and Lady Frances Elizabeth Needham, daughter of the 1st Earl of Kilmorey. He spent his childhood in West London, which at that time consisted of villages and fields, and was educated at Eton College. Military career On 14 February 1845, Higginson was commissioned by purchase in the 1st Regiment of the Grenadier Guards with the regimental rank of ensign (army rank of lieutenant). He was promoted by purchase to regimental lieutenant (army rank of captain) on 12 July 1850. He was appointed as the regimental adjutant on 5 December 1851. As Adjutant of the 3rd Battalion, he served throughout the Crimean War. He participated in the battles of Alma, Balaclava and Inkerman, having his horse shot from under him at Inkerman. He was promoted to the brevet rank of major in the army on 12 December 1854. He was also present at the siege and fall of Sebastopol, following which he served as Brigade Major of his regiment, until the end of the war. He was promoted to brevet lieutenant colonel in the army on 2 November 1855, and was promoted by purchase to lieutenant colonel on 10 April 1857. Higginson, throughout his career, travelled extensively on military affairs, to Ireland, Canada, France, Italy and Russia. He also spent time in the United States during the American Civil War, where he had family ties. He was promoted to the brevet rank of colonel on 30 September 1863, to regimental major (army rank of lieutenant colonel) on 10 July 1870 and to regimental lieutenant colonel (army rank of colonel) on 15 September 1877.

He was knighted as a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath in the 1889 Birthday Honours, promoted to general on 11 October 1890, and retired on 21 June 1893 after 38 years of service. Later life He was a personal friend of the Royal Family, and had close ties with King Edward VII. King George V and Queen Mary were regular visitors to Gyldernscroft, his home in Marlow. In 1923, aged 96, he became a godfather to George Lascelles, later 7th Earl of Harewood, the first grandson of King George V and Queen Mary, and elder son of Princess Mary and Viscount Lascelles. On 24 June 1918, he was appointed a deputy lieutenant of Buckinghamshire. Higginson's 100th birthday was celebrated with great splendour in his native Marlow. To mark that birthday, the inhabitants of Marlow organised a public collection and, with its proceeds, purchased Higginson Park, alongside the River Thames, as a memorial to what they considered their town's most famous son. Higginson himself contributed generously to the collection. At a ceremony in the town, Princess Mary, the Princess Royal, presented the deeds of the park to Higginson. Higginson was associated for many years with the Gordon Boys' Home (now Gordon's School) at West End near Woking, Surrey, which was founded as the national memorial to Major General Charles Gordon, who was killed at Khartoum, Sudan, in 1885. Higginson wrote an autobiography in 1916, entitled 71 Years of a Guardsman's Life. Higginson died in February 1927, and his funeral, with full military honours, was described by observers as the grandest Marlow had seen, with hundreds lining the streets.

Dunfermline is close to the principal crossing point on the Fife side. Robert Henryson (Middle Scots: Robert Henrysoun) was a poet who flourished in Scotland in the period c. 1460‚Äì1500. Counted among the Scots makars, he lived in the royal burgh of Dunfermline and is a distinctive voice in the Northern Renaissance at a time when the culture was on a cusp between medieval and renaissance sensibilities. Little is known of his life, but evidence suggests that he was a teacher who had training in law and the humanities, that he had a connection with Dunfermline Abbey and that he may also have been associated for a period with Glasgow University. His poetry was composed in Middle Scots at a time when this was the state language. It is one of the most important bodies of work in the canon of early Scottish literature. His writing consists mainly of narrative works highly inventive in their development of story- telling techniques. He generally achieved a canny balance of humour and high seriousness which is often multi-layered in its effects. This is especially so in his Morall Fabillis, in which he expresses a consistent but complex world view that seems standard, on the surface, vis a vis the major ruling power of the church, while containing critical and questioning elements. This range is further extended in his Testament of Cresseid with its more tragic vision. Overall, his themes and tone convey an attractive impression of humanity and compassionate intellect. He was a subtle rhetorician and remains to this day one of the finest in the Scots language. Although his writing usually incorporated a typically medieval didactic purpose, it also has much in common with other artistic currents of northern Europe which were generally developing, such as the realism of Flemish painting, the historical candour of Barbour or the narrative scepticism of Chaucer. An example is his subtle use of psychology to convey individual character in carefully dramatised, recognisable daily-life situations which tend to eschew fantastic elements. west door of Dunfermline Abbey. Abbot House which purports to imagine Henryson; more strictly speaking, the image depicts Aesop as portrayed in Henryson's Morall Fabillis Dunfermline Abbey from a 17th-century engraving which gives a more complete impression of the original building complex than survives today. His surviving body of work amounts to almost exactly 5000 lines. Works Henryson's surviving canon consists of three long poems and around twelve miscellaneous short works in various genres. The longest poem is his Morall Fabillis, a tight, intricately structured set of thirteen fable stories in a cycle that runs just short of 3000 lines. Two other long works survive, both a little over 600 lines each. One is his dynamic and inventive version of the Orpheus story and the other, his Testament of Cresseid, is a tale of moral and psychological subtlety in a tragic mode founded upon the literary conceit of \\"completing\\" Criseyde's story-arc from Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde. The range of Henryson's shorter works includes a highly original pastourelle on a theme of love, as well as a bawdy passage of comic flyting which targets the medical practises of his day, a highly crafted and compressed poem of Marian devotion, some allegorical works, some philosophical meditations, and a prayer against the pest. As with his longer works, his outward themes often carry important subtexts. Constructing a sure chronology for Henryson's writings is not possible, but his Orpheus story may have been written earlier in his career, during his time in Glasgow, since one of its principal sources was contained in the university library. Internal evidence has been used to suggest that the Morall Fabillis were composed during the 1480s. Biographical inferences Leuven's University Library in 1915, illustrating just one of the ways in which historical records can be lost. There is no record of when or where Henryson was born or educated. The earliest found unconfirmed reference to him occurs in September 1462 when a man of his name with license to teach is on record as having taken a post in the recently founded University of Glasgow. If this was the poet, as is usually assumed, then the citation indicates that he had completed studies in both arts and canon law.The University of Glasgow, Munimenta, II, 69, dated 10 September 1462, admits a Robert Henryson, licenciate in Arts and bachelor of Decreits (Canon Law), as a member of the University. It is considered strongly likely, from secondary evidence, that this was the poet. With no record of him as a student in Scotland, it is normally thought that he graduated in a university furth of the land, possibly in Leuven, Paris or Bologna. This has not been established. Almost all early references to Henryson firmly associate his name with Dunfermline.These are all posthumous references, such as on the title pages of the early printed editions of his work that started to appear after his lifetime. He probably had some attachment to the city's Benedictine abbey, the burial place for many of the kingdom's monarchs and an important centre for pilgrimage close to a major ferry-crossing en route to St Andrews. Direct unconfirmed evidence for this connection occurs in 1478 when his name appears as a witness on abbey charters.The dates are 18 and 19 March and 6 July 1478 and the signature is Magistro Roberto Henrison publico notario. See McDiarmid, M.P. 1981: Robert Henryson, Scottish Academic Press, p.3. If this was the poet, then it would establish that one of his functions was as notary for the abbey, an institution which possessed and managed a vast portfolio of territory across Scotland.The scholar John MacQueen contextualises this record of the poet as a notary in Scotland against the Act of 1469 which gave James III power to appoint notaries public over and above the rights of the Pope and the Holy Roman Emperor and the consequent expulsion of notaries appointed by the Emperor Frederick III of Germany. MacQueen, J. 2006: Complete and Full with Numbers: the Narrative Poetry of Robert Henryson, Rodopi, Amsterdam, pp.10 and 12. The almost universal references to Henryson as schoolmaster are usually taken to mean that he taught in and had some duty to run the grammar school for Dunfermline's abbatial burgh.The title page of the 1570 edition of Henryson's Fables, for instance, refers to the poet as \\"scholemaister of Dunfermeling\\". A partial picture of what this meant in practice may be derived from a confirmatio of 1468 which granted provision to build a \\"suitable\\" house for the habitation of a \\"priest\\" (as master of grammar) and \\"scholars\\" in Dunfermline, including \\"poor scholars being taught free of charge\\".Confirmatio, dated 26 November 1468. Published in Kirk, J. ed. 1997: Calendar of Scottish Supplications to Rome: 1447‚Äì1471, Scottish Academic Press. p.396. Period portrait showing typical appearance of the day Abbot House Window, Dunfermline, depicting Henryson's Lion and the Mouse. Dunfermline, as a royal burgh with capital status, was routinely visited by the court with residences directly linked to the abbey complex. There is no record of Henryson as a court poet, but the close proximity makes acquaintance with the royal household likely. He was active during the reigns of James III and James IV, both of whom had strong interests in literature. According to the poet William Dunbar, Henryson died in Dunfermline. An apocryphal story by the English poet Francis Kynaston in the early 17th century refers to the flux as the cause of death, but this has not been established.See Robert L Kindrick, Introduction which quotes Kynaston's general thoughts on Henryson and the \\"merry, though somewhat unsauory tale\\". The year of death also is unknown, although c.1498-9, a time of plague in the burgh, has been tentatively suggested.See McDiarmid, M.P. 1981: Robert Henryson, Scottish Academic Press, p.12 However, Dunbar gives the terminus ad quem in a couplet (usually considered to have been composed c.1505) which simply states that Death in Dunfermelyne :...hes done roune (has whispered in private) :with Maister Robert Henrysoun. (William Dunbar, Lament for the Makaris, lines 81‚Äì2)The title maister is a further indication that the poet was indeed the university-educated Henryson associated with Glasgow University. Almost nothing else is known of Henryson outside of his surviving writing. It is not known if he originated from Dunfermline and a suggestion that he may have been linked to the Fife branch of the Clan Henderson is not possible to verify,Laing, David (1865) The Poems and Fables of Robert Henryson pp. x-xii. although his name is certainly of that ilk. General style Henryson generally wrote in a first-person voice using a familiar tone that quickly brings the reader into his confidence and gives a notable impression of authentic personality and beliefs. The writing stays rooted in daily life and continues to feel grounded even when the themes are metaphysical or elements are fantastic. His language is a supple, flowing and concise Scots that clearly shows he knew Latin, while scenes are usually given a deftly evocative Scottish setting which can only have come from close connection and observation.See Wittig, K. 1958: The Scottish Tradition in Literature, Oliver and Boyd, chapter 2, for appraisals of Henryson's descriptive technique. This detailed, intimate and realistic approach, at times, strongly suggests matters of personal experience and attitudes to actual contemporary events, yet the specifics remain elusive in ways that tantalise readers and critics. Some of this sense of intrigue may be in part accidental, but it is also heightened by his cannily controlled application of a philosophy of fiction, a frequently self-proclaimed feature of the work.\\"Certainly the present writer would like to know more about Robert Henryson as he lived outside his verse than about any other Scots poet.\\" (McDiarmid, M.P. 1981: Robert Henryson, Scottish Academic Press, p.1.) McDiarmid's first chapter goes on to develop a surprisingly full speculative picture of the poet's life gleaned from evidence in his poetry, secondary historical evidence for the period and the surviving citations of his name in an extremely broken record. No concrete details of his life can be directly inferred from his works, but there are some passages of self-reflection that appear to contain autobiographical implications, particularly in the opening stanzas of his Testament of Cresseid. Henryson's Scots Henryson wrote using the Scots language of the 15th century. This was in an age when the use of vernacular languages for literature in many parts of Europe was increasingly taking the place of Latin, the long-established lingua franca across the continent. Extant poems All known and extant writings attributed to Robert Henryson are listed here. In addition, the scholar Matthew P McDiarmid identified from an index a lost poem by Henryson which began: On fut by Forth as I couth found (not listed below).McDiarmid, M.P. 1981: Robert Henryson, Scottish Academic Press, p.4 =Long works= * The Morall Fabillis of Esope the Phrygian (See below for list of individual fables in the cycle) * The Tale of Orpheus and Erudices his Quene * The Testament of Cresseid =Short works= * Robene and Makyne * Sum Practysis of Medecyne * The Annuciation * Ane Prayer for the Pest * The Garment of Gud Ladeis * The Bludy Serk * The Thre Deid-Pollis * Against Hasty Credence * The Abbay Walk * The Praise of Age * The Ressoning Betwix Aige and Yowth * The Ressoning Betwix Deth and Man =Individual fables= Seven of the stories in Henryson's cycle are Aesopian fables derived from elegiac Romulus texts, while the other six (given in italics) are Reynardian in genre.

Life He was born on a farm near Boyndie, three miles from Banff in Banffshire, where his father was a farmer.Grants Old and New Edinburgh He was educated locally, then studied at the University of Aberdeen. Initially from 1695 he was schoolmaster in Laurencekirk.Monuments and monumental inscriptions in Scotland: The Caledonian Society of Scotland Then in 1700, through the influence of Dr Archibald Pitcairne, he became an assistant in the Advocates' Library, Edinburgh. He founded (1715) a successful printing business, and in 1728 was appointed printer to the University of Edinburgh. He acquired the Caledonian Mercury in 1729, and in 1730 was appointed keeper of the Advocates' Library, resigning in 1752. He is buried at Greyfriars Kirkyard, Edinburgh. The monument was erected in 1801 by his relative, Dr William Ruddiman.Monuments and monumental inscriptions in Scotland: The Caledonian Society of Scotland It stands in the north-west section of the graveyard. Family He was married to Anna Smith (1694‚Äì1769).Inscription on tomb His nephew Walter Ruddiman (1719‚Äì1781) also from Banff, similarly established a successful business in Edinburgh as a printer and publisher. Works His main early writings were editions of Florence Wilson's De Animi Tranquillitate Dialogus (1707), and the Cantici Solomonis Paraphrasis Poetica (1709) of Arthur Johnston (1587‚Äì1641), editor of the Deliciae Poetarum Scotorum. On the death of Dr Pitcairne he edited his friend's Latin verses, and arranged for the sale of his valuable library to Peter the Great of Russia. In 1714 he published Rudiments of the Latin Tongue, which was long used in Scottish schools. In 1715 he edited, with notes and annotations, the works of George Buchanan in two volumes folio. As Ruddiman was a Jacobite, Buchanan's liberal views invited his criticism. A society of scholars was formed in Edinburgh to \\"vindicate that incomparably learned and pious author from the calumnies of Mr Thomas Ruddiman\\"; but Ruddiman's remains the standard edition, though George Logan, John Love, James Man and others attacked him with vehemence. Other works were: An edition of Gavin Douglas's translation of Virgil's Aeneid (1710), with an extensive Older Scots glossary; the editing and completion of James Anderson's Selectus Diplomatum et Numismatum Scotiae Thesaurus (1739); Catalogue of the Advocates' Library (1733‚Äì42); and a famous edition of Livy (1751). He also helped Joseph Ames with his Typographical Antiquities. Ruddiman was for many years the representative scholar of Scotland. Writing in 1766, Dr Johnson, after reproving James Boswell for some bad Latin, significantly adds--\\"Ruddiman is dead.\\" When Boswell proposed to write Ruddiman's life, \\"I should take pleasure in helping you to do honour to him\\", said Johnson.

Editorial Debate. Random House Mondadori. p. 35, Madrid. 2005. ; (26 August 1914 ‚Äì 12 February 1984) was an Argentine novelist, short story writer, and essayist. Known as one of the founders of the Latin American Boom, Cort√°zar influenced an entire generation of Spanish-speaking readers and writers in America and Europe. He is considered one of the most innovative and original authors of his time, a master of history, poetic prose and short story in general and a creator of important novels that inaugurated a new way of making literature in the Hispanic world by breaking the classical moulds through narratives that escaped temporal linearity. As the content of his work travels on the border between the real and the fantastic, it is often placed within the genres of magical realism and surrealism. He lived his childhood and adolescence and incipient maturity in Argentina and, after the 1950s, in Europe. He lived in Italy, Spain, Switzerland and France, where he settled in 1951 and composed some of his works. Early life Julio Cort√°zar was born on August 26, 1914, in Ixelles,Cort√°zar sin barba, by Eduardo Montes-Bradley. Random House Mondadori, Editorial Debate, Madrid, 2004 a municipality of Brussels, Belgium. According to biographer Miguel Herr√°ez, his parents, Julio Jos√© Cort√°zar and Mar√≠a Herminia Descotte, were Argentine citizens, and his father was attached to the Argentine diplomatic service in Belgium.Herr√°ez, Miguel. Julio Cort√°zar, Una Biograf√≠a Revisada Alrev√©s, 2011 p. 25 At the time of Cort√°zar's birth, Belgium was occupied by the German troops of Kaiser Wilhelm II. After German troops arrived in Belgium, Cort√°zar and his family moved to Z√ºrich where Mar√≠a Herminia's parents, Victoria Gabel and Louis Descotte (a French National), were waiting in neutral territory. The family group spent the next two years in Switzerland, first in Z√ºrich, then Geneva, before moving for a short period to Barcelona. The Cort√°zars settled outside of Buenos Aires by the end of 1919.Montes-Bradley, Eduardo. \\"Cort√°zar sin barba\\". Editorial Debate. Random House Mondadori, p. 110, Madrid, 2005. Cort√°zar's father left when Julio was six, and the family had no further contact with him.Herr√°ez, Miguel. Julio Cort√°zar, Una Biograf√≠a Revisada Alrev√©s, 2011, , pp. 38 & 45, Cort√°zar spent most of his childhood in Banfield, a suburb south of Buenos Aires, with his mother and younger sister. The home in Banfield, with its back yard, was a source of inspiration for some of his stories.Banfield is mentioned in the short story \\"Conducta en los velorios\\" from Historias de cronopios y de famas. Despite this, in a letter to Graciela M. de Sol√° on December 4, 1963, he described this period of his life as \\"full of servitude, excessive touchiness, terrible and frequent sadness.\\" He was a sickly child and spent much of his childhood in bed reading. His mother, who spoke several languages and was a great reader herself, introduced her son to the works of Jules Verne, whom Cort√°zar admired for the rest of his life. In the magazine Plural (issue 44, Mexico City, May 1975) he wrote: \\"I spent my childhood in a haze full of goblins and elves, with a sense of space and time that was different from everybody else's\\". Education and teaching career Cort√°zar in his youth Cort√°zar obtained a qualification as an elementary school teacher at the age of 18. He would later pursue higher education in philosophy and languages at the University of Buenos Aires, but left for financial reasons without receiving a degree.Herr√°ez, Miguel. Julio Cort√°zar, Una Biograf√≠a Revisada. Alrev√©s, 2011, , p. 343. According to biographer Montes-Bradley, Cort√°zar taught in at least two high schools in Buenos Aires Province, one in the city of Chivilcoy, the other in Bolivar. In 1938, using the pseudonym of Julio Denis, he self-published a volume of sonnets, Presencia, Omar Prego, Muchnik Editores, 1985 (p. 33). which he later repudiated, saying in a 1977 interview for Spanish television that publishing it was his only transgression to the principle of not publishing any books until he was convinced that what was written in them was what he meant to say. TVE 1977. In 1944, he became professor of French literature at the National University of Cuyo in Mendoza, but owing to political pressure from Peronists, he resigned the position in June 1946. He subsequently worked as a translator and as director of the C√°mara Argentina del Libro, a trade organization.Herr√°ez, Miguel. Julio Cort√°zar, Una Biograf√≠a Revisada. Alrev√©s, 2011, , pp. 118-119. In 1949 he published a play, Los Reyes (The Kings), based on the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur. In 1980, Cort√°zar delivered eight lectures at the University of California, Berkeley. Years in France In 1951, Cort√°zar emigrated to France, where he lived and worked for the rest of his life, though he traveled widely. From 1952 onwards, he worked intermittently for UNESCO as a translator. He wrote most of his major works in Paris or in Saignon in the south of France, where he also maintained a home. In later years he became actively engaged in opposing abuses of human rights in Latin America, and was a supporter of the Sandinista revolution in Nicaragua as well as Fidel Castro's Cuban revolution and Salvador Allende's socialist government in Chile. Cort√°zar had three long-term romantic relationships with women. The first was with Aurora Bern√°rdez, an Argentine translator, whom he married in 1953. They separated in 1968Herr√°ez, Miguel. Julio Cort√°zar, Una Biograf√≠a Revisada Alrev√©s, 2011 pp. 245-252. when he became involved with the Lithuanian writer, editor, translator, and filmmaker Ugnƒó Karvelis, whom he never formally married, and who reportedly stimulated Cort√°zar's interest in politics, although his political sensibilities had already been awakened by a visit to Cuba in 1963, the first of multiple trips that he would make to that country throughout the remainder of his life. He later married Canadian writer Carol Dunlop. After Dunlop's death in 1982, Aurora Bern√°rdez accompanied Cort√°zar during his final illness and, in accordance with his longstanding wishes, inherited the rights to all his works.¬´Las cartas de Cort√°zar¬ª, article in the newspaper El Mundo (Madrid), 15 July 2012.Julio Cort√°zar. Cartas, 3 (2000 edition, Alfaguara), p. 1785. . He died in Paris in 1984, and is interred in the cimeti√®re du Montparnasse. The cause of his death was reported to be leukemia, though some sources state that he died from AIDS as a result of receiving a blood transfusion.Una nueva biograf√≠a sostiene que Cort√°zar habr√≠a muerto de sida clarin.com, 7.06.2001¬´Peri Rossi: ‚ÄúCort√°zar muri√≥ de sida por una transfusi√≥n‚Äù¬ª, article in the newspaper ABC from 25 January 2009. Works Cort√°zar photographed in Buenos Aires in December 1983, when he returned after 10 years of exile in France Cort√°zar wrote numerous short stories, collected in such volumes as Bestiario (1951), Final del juego (1956), and Las armas secretas (1959). In 1967, English translations by Paul Blackburn of stories selected from these volumes were published by Pantheon Books as End of the Game and Other Stories; it was later re-titled Blow-up and Other Stories. Cort√°zar published four novels during his lifetime: Los premios (The Winners, 1960), Hopscotch (Rayuela, 1963), 62: A Model Kit (62 Modelo para Armar, 1968), and Libro de Manuel (A Manual for Manuel, 1973). Except for Los premios, which was translated by Elaine Kerrigan, these novels have been translated into English by Gregory Rabassa. Two other novels, El examen and Divertimento, though written before 1960, only appeared posthumously. The open-ended structure of Hopscotch, which invites the reader to choose between a linear and a non- linear mode of reading, has been praised by other Latin American writers, including Jos√© Lezama Lima, Giannina Braschi, Carlos Fuentes, Gabriel Garc√≠a M√°rquez, and Mario Vargas Llosa. Cort√°zar's use of interior monologue and stream of consciousness owes much to James JoyceJulio Cort√°zar y James Joyce and other modernists, but his main influences were Surrealism,Pic√≥n Garfield, Evelyn. Es Julio Cort√°zar un surrealista?, 1975 the French Nouveau roman and the improvisatory aesthetic of jazz.\\"El jazz en la obra de Cort√°zar\\" , p. 41. This last interest is reflected in the notable story \\"El perseguidor\\" (\\"The Pursuer\\"), which Cort√°zar based on the life of the bebop saxophonist Charlie Parker.Doris Sommer, \\"Grammar Trouble for Cort√°zar\\", in Proceed with Caution, When Engaged by Minority Writing in the Americas, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, p. 211. Cort√°zar also published poetry, drama, and various works of non-fiction. In the 1960s, working with the artist Jos√© Silva, he created two almanac-books or libros-almanaque, La vuelta al d√≠a en ochenta mundos and √öltimo Round, which combined various texts written by Cort√°zar with photographs, engravings, and other illustrations, in the manner of the almanaques del mensajero that had been widely circulated in rural Argentina during his childhood.Herr√°ez, Miguel. Julio Cort√°zar, Una Biograf√≠a Revisada Alrev√©s, 2011, , p. 242. One of his last works was a collaboration with Carol Dunlop, The Autonauts of the Cosmoroute, which relates, partly in mock-heroic style, the couple's extended expedition along the autoroute from Paris to Marseille in a Volkswagen camper nicknamed Fafner. As a translator, he completed Spanish-language renderings of Robinson Crusoe, Marguerite Yourcenar's novel M√©moires d'Hadrien, and the complete prose works of Edgar Allan Poe.Biblioteca Julio Cort√°zar, Fundaci√≥n Juan March. Influence and legacy Cort√°zar's grave in Montparnasse Cemetery, Paris. Michelangelo Antonioni's film Blowup (1966) was inspired by Cort√°zar's story \\"Las babas del diablo\\", which in turn was based on a photograph taken by Chilean photographer Sergio Larra√≠n during a shoot outside of Notre Dame Cathedral in Paris. Cort√°zar's story \\"La autopista del sur\\" (\\"The Southern Thruway\\") influenced another film of the 1960s, Jean-Luc Godard's Week End (1967).Jean Franco, \\"Comic Stripping: Cort√°zar in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction\\", in Critical Passions: Selected Essays, eds. Mary Louise Pratt and Kathleen Newman, Durham, NC: Duke University Press, 1999, p. 416.

Chilean novelist Roberto Bola√±o cited Cort√°zar as a key influence on his novel The Savage Detectives: \\"To say that I'm permanently indebted to the work of Borges and Cort√°zar is obvious.\\"Roberto Bola√±o, Between Parentheses: Essays, Articles, and Speeches, 1998-2003, trans. Natasha Wimmer, New York: New Directions, 2011, 353. Puerto Rican novelist Giannina Braschi used Cort√°zar's story \\"Las babas del diablo\\" as a springboard for the chapter called \\"Blow-up\\" in her bilingual novel Yo-Yo Boing! (1998), which features scenes with Cort√°zar's characters La Maga and Rocamadour.Debra A. Castillo, editor, Redreaming America: Toward a Bilingual American Culture, \\"Language Games,\\" by Ilan Stavans, pp. 172-186, SUNY, New York, 2005. Cort√°zar is mentioned and spoken highly of in Rabih Alameddine's 1998 novel, Koolaids: The Art of War. North American novelist Deena Metzger cites Cort√°zar as co- author of her novel Doors: A Fiction for Jazz Horn,Deena Metzger, Doors: A Fiction for Jazz Horn, Red Hen Press, Pasadena CA, 2004 written twenty years after his death. In Buenos Aires, a school, a public library, and a square in the Palermo neighborhood carry Cort√°zar's name.

During his long career in politics, he held many important posts in government such as Chief Minister of Bombay State, Home Minister, Finance Minister and 2nd Deputy Prime Minister of India. Following the passing of Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri, Desai was a strong contender for the position of Prime Minister, only to be defeated by Indira Gandhi in 1966. He was appointed as Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Finance in Indira Gandhi's cabinet, until 1969. He resigned from the Congress during the split of 1969, and joined the INC (O). After the controversial emergency was lifted in 1977, the political parties of the opposition fought together against the Congress, under the umbrella of the Janata Party, and won the 1977 election. Desai was elected Prime Minister, and became the first non-Congress Prime Minister of India. On the international scene, Desai holds international fame for his peace activism and created efforts to initiate peace between two rival South Asian states, Pakistan and India. After India's first nuclear test in 1974, Desai helped restore friendly relations with China and Pakistan, and vowed to avoid armed conflict such as Indo-Pakistani war of 1971. He was honoured with the highest civilian award of Pakistan, the Nishan-e-Pakistan on 19 May 1990. He is the oldest person to hold the office of prime minister, at the age of 81, in the history of Indian politics. He subsequently retired from all political posts, but continued to campaign for the Janata Party in 1980. He was conferred with India's highest civilian honour, the Bharat Ratna. He died at the age of 99 in 1995.  Early life  =Birth= Morarji Desai was born into a Gujarati Anavil Brahmin family. His father name is Ranchhodji Nagarji Desai and his mother name is Vajiaben Desai. He was born in Bhadeli village, Bulsar district, Bombay Presidency, British India (present-day Valsad district, Gujarat, India) on 29 February 1896, the eldest of eight children. His father was a school teacher. =School education and early career= Desai underwent his primary schooling in The Kundla School (now called J.V. Modi school), Savarkundla and later joined Bai Ava Bai High School, Valsad. After graduating from Wilson College, Mumbai, he joined the civil service in Gujarat. Desai resigned as deputy collector of Godhra in May 1930 after being found guilty of going soft on Hindus during the riots of 1927-28 there. =Freedom fighter= Desai then joined the freedom struggle under Mahatma Gandhi and joined the civil disobedience movement against British rule in India. He spent many years in jail during the freedom struggle and owing to his sharp leadership skills and tough spirit, he became a favourite amongst freedom-fighters and an important leader of the Indian National Congress in the Gujarat region. When provincial elections were held in 1934 and 1937, Desai was elected and served as the Revenue Minister and Home Minister of the Bombay Presidency. In government =Chief Minister of Bombay and Partition of two state= Morarji Desai in 1937, as Congress Home Minister of Bombay Presidency Before the independence of India, he became Bombay's Home Minister and was later elected Chief Minister of Bombay state in 1952. It was a period when movements for linguistic states were on the rise, particularly in South India. Bombay was a bi-lingual state, home to Gujarati-speaking and Marathi- speaking people. Since 1956, activist organisation Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti led a movement for a Marathi-speaking state of Maharashtra. Morarji Desai was opposed to such movements, including the Mahagujarat Movement led by Indulal Yagnik demanding a new state of Gujarat. Desai proposed that the metropolitan Mumbai be made a Union territory. His logic was that a separate development region would suit the city's cosmopolitan nature, with citizens from diverse settings across various linguistic, cultural, and religious backgrounds living there for generations. Despite his Gandhian ideals, Desai ordered the police to open fire on the Samyukta Maharashtra Samiti demonstrators who had gathered at Flora Fountain to demand a Marathi-speaking state. The protesters were led by Senapati Bapat. In the carnage that followed, 105 protesters, including an eleven-year-old girl, were killed. The issue escalated and is believed to have forced the Central Government to agree to two separate states based on language. After the formation of the present State of Maharashtra, Bombay, now Mumbai became its state capital. Flora Fountain was renamed \\"Hutatma Chowk\\" (\\"Martyrs' Square\\" in Marathi) to honour the people killed in the firing. Later Desai moved to Delhi when he was inducted as finance Minister in the cabinet of Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru. =Nehru cabinet= Desai was socially conservative, pro-business, and in favour of free enterprise reforms, as opposed to Prime Minister Jawaharlal Nehru's socialistic policies. Rising in Congress leadership, as a fierce nationalist with anti-corruption leanings, Desai was at odds with Prime Minister Nehru and his allies, and with Nehru's age and health failing, he was considered as a possible contender for the position of Prime Minister. =Congress party leadership contest= In 1964 after prime minister's Nehru's death, Desai was outflanked in the leadership contest by the Nehru's protege, Lal Bahadur Shastri. Desai was invited but did not join the short lived Shastri cabinet. In early 1966, the unexpected passing away of Prime Minister Lal Bahadur Shastri after only 18 months in power made Morarji Desai once again a contender for the top position. However, he was defeated by Nehru's daughter, Indira Gandhi, in the Congress party leadership election by a big margin. =Indira Gandhi cabinet= Desai served as Deputy Prime Minister and Finance Minister of India in the Indira Gandhi government until July 1969 when Prime Minister Gandhi took the finance portfolio from him but asked him to serve as the deputy prime minister. However, to save his self-respect, Desai tendered his resignation from the Gandhi cabinet. Gandhi also nationalised the fourteen largest banks in India at the same time. =In opposition= When the Congress party split in 1969, Morarji joined the Indian National Congress (Organisation) faction of the party, whereas Indira Gandhi formed a new faction called Indian National Congress (Ruling). Alternatively, the two factions of Desai and Indira were called Syndicate and Indicate respectively. The 1971 general elections to the Indian parliament were won by Indira Gandhi's faction in a landslide. Morarji Desai, however, was elected as a member of the Lok Sabha or lower house of Parliament. Morarji Desai went on indefinite hunger strike on 12 March 1975 to support Nav Nirman movement of Gujarat. In 1975, Indira Gandhi was convicted of electoral fraud by the Allahabad High Court, after opponents alleged she had used government civil servants and equipment during the campaign for the 1971 General Elections. During the subsequent Emergency rule in 1975‚Äì77, Desai and other opposition leaders were jailed by the Indira Gandhi government as part of a massive crackdown. =Janata wave of 1977= The popular anti- corruption movement led by Jayaprakash Narayan and the Janata-wave in 1977 led to the complete routing of the Congress party in Northern India, and a landslide victory for the opposition Janata alliance in the National elections held in March 1977. Morarji Desai was selected by the Janata alliance, later Janata Party as their parliamentary leader, and thus became the first non- Congress Prime Minister of India.

Morarji Desai on Indian Postal Stamp 1996 Morarji Desai on Indian Postal Stamp 1997 =First term as a Prime Minister= In January 1977, Indira Gandhi dissolved the Lok Sabha and declared that elections to the body were to be held during March 1977. Opposition leaders were also released and promptly formed the Janata alliance to fight the elections. The alliance registered a landslide victory in the election. On the urging of Jayaprakash Narayan, the Janata alliance selected Desai as their parliamentary leader and thus the Prime Minister. Foreign policy Desai restored normal relations with China, for the first time since the 1962 war. He also communicated with the military ruler of Pakistan, General Zia-ul-Haq and established friendly relations.Despite his pacifist leanings, he refused to sign the non-nuclear proliferation treaty despite the threat of stopping supply of uranium for power plants by the USA Congress. =Nuclear programme= Domestically, Desai played a crucial role in the Indian nuclear program after it was targeted by major nuclear powers after India conducted a surprise nuclear test in 1974. Desai kept India's nuclear reactors stating \\"they will never be used for atomic bombs, and I will see to it if I can help it\\". Internationally, he reaffirmed India's stand that it would not manufacture nuclear weapons and would refrain from conducting even peaceful nuclear explosions. In 1977, the Carter administration offered to sell heavy water and uranium to India for its nuclear reactors but required American on-site inspection of nuclear materials. Desai declined, seeing the American stance as contradictory, in light of its own nuclear arsenal. =Decimation of R&AW;= Morarji Desai had described the Research and Analysis Wing (R&AW;), India's external intelligence agency, as the praetorian guard of Indira Gandhi and had promised to stop all activities of the R&AW; after becoming prime minister. He closed down much of the agency, and reduced its budget and operations, such as closing its Information Division. B. Raman, the former head of the Counter- Terrorism Division of R&AW; and noted security analyst, revealed that in an informal discussion, Morarji Desai indiscreetly told Pakistan's Chief Martial Law Administrator General Zia ul-Haq that his government was well aware of Pakistan's nuclear development.\\"Kaoboys of R&AW;: Down Memory Lane\\" by B. Raman =Intra-party squabbles and collapse of Janata government= His government undid many amendments made to the constitution during emergency and made it more difficult for any future government to impose a national emergency. However, the Janata Party coalition was full of personal and policy friction and thus failed to achieve much, owing to continuous in-wrangling and much controversy. With no party in leadership of the coalition, rival groups vied to unseat Desai. Controversial trials of prominent Congress leaders, including Indira Gandhi over Emergency-era abuses worsened the fortunes of his administration. In 1979, Raj Narain and Charan Singh pulled out of the Janata Party, forcing Desai to resign from office and retire from politics. The chief reason for the collapse was the demand by the duo and other left-leaning members, like Madhu Limaye, Krishan Kant, and George Fernandes that no member of the Janata party could simultaneously be a member of an alternative social or political organisation. This attack on \\"dual membership\\" was directed specifically at members of the Janata party who had been members of the Jan Sangh, and continued to be members of Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh, the Jan Sangh's ideological parent.Lloyd I. Rudolph and Susanne H. Rudolph, In Pursuit of Lakshmi: The Political Economy of the Indian State (1987), University of Chicago Press, pp 457‚Äì459. Retirement and death Morarji Desai campaigned for the Janata Party in 1980 General Election as a senior politician but did not contest the election himself. In retirement, he lived in Mumbai and died on 10 April 1995 at the age of 99. When former French Prime Minister Antoine Pinay died on 13 December 1994, Desai became the world's oldest living former head of government. He was much honoured in his last years as a freedom- fighter of his generation. Morarji Desai was a strict follower of Mahatma Gandhi's principles and a moralist. He was a vegetarian \\"both by birth and by conviction.\\"Shri Morarji Desai, In my view, 1966, pp. 234‚Äì235. Social service Morarji Desai was a Gandhian follower, social worker, institution builder and a great reformer. He was the Chancellor of Gujarat Vidyapith. Even during his term as the Prime Minister he used to visit and stay at Vidyapith during the month of October. He lived simply and used to write post cards himself even when he held the office of Prime Minister. Sardar Patel deputed him to conduct meetings of farmers in Kaira district which finally led to the establishment of the Amul Cooperative movement. During his rule, he withdrew intervention in Public Distribution System and rationing shops were literally lost due to cheap sugar and oil available in the market. Personal life Morarji Desai married Gujraben in 1911, at the age of 15. Gujraben lived to see her husband becoming Prime Minister, but she predeceased him. He has a son, Kanti Desai, and grandsons Jagdeep and Bharat Desai. Madhukeshwar Desai, one of his great-grandsons, son of Jagdeep Desai, took it upon himself to revive the legacy of his illustrious great grandfather. Madhukeshwar Desai is currently the National Vice-President of the Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha, the youth wing of the BJP. Vishaal Desai, son of Bharat Desai, is a writer and filmmaker. Desai, a longtime practitioner of 'urine therapy', spoke in 1978 to Dan Rather on 60 Minutes about the benefits of drinking urine. The prime minister stated that urine therapy was the perfect medical solution for the millions of Indians who cannot afford medical treatment.Wasson, R.G., 1979. Soma brought up-to-date. Journal of the American Oriental Society, 99(1), pp.100-105. He also attributed his longevity to drinking urine - which he called \\"the water of life\\".

He was born in Caskieben (later renamed Keithhall) near Inverurie in Aberdeenshire. His father, Sir George Johnston, was an Aberdeenshire laird, and his mother Christian Forbes was the daughter of Lord Forbes. Johnston is thought to have begun his university studies at one, or both, of the colleges at the University of Aberdeen, but around 1608 he went to Italy and received an M.D. at Padua in 1610. Afterwards he lived at Sedan, France as professor at the Academy of Sedan, in the company of the exiled Andrew Melville, and in 1619 was in practice in Paris. He appears to have returned to Scotland about the time of James I's death in 1625, and to have been in Aberdeen in about 1628. He met William Laud in Edinburgh at the time of Charles I's Scottish coronation (1633). In that year, he had published a volume entitled Cantici Salomonis paraphrasis poetica, which, dedicated to Charles I, brought him to Laud's notice. Johnston was encouraged by Laud in his literary efforts, possibly as a strike against George Buchanan's reputation as a Latin poet. Johnston was appointed rector of King's College, Aberdeen, in June 1637. Four years later he died at Oxford, on his way to London at Laud's invitation. Johnston left more than ten works, all in Latin. Only two of these, published in the same year, are notable: (a) his version of the Psalms (Psalmorum Davidis paraphrasis poetica et canticorum evangelicorum, Aberdeen, 1637), and (b) his anthology of contemporary Latin verse by Scottish poets (Deliciae poetarum Scotorum huius aevi illustrium, Amsterdam, 1637). The full version of the Psalms was the result of Laud's encouragement. It was for some time a strong rival of Buchanan's work, though not superior to the latter. The Deliciae, in two small thick volumes of 699 and 575 pages, was a patriotic effort in imitation of the various volumes (under a similar title) which had been popular on the Continent during the second decade of the century. The volumes are dedicated by Johnston to John Scot of Scotstarvet, at whose expense the collected works were published after Johnston's death, at Middelburg (1642). Selections from his own poems occupy pages 439-647 of the first volume, divided into three sections, Parerga, Epigrammata and Musae Aulicae. He published a volume of epigrams at Aberdeen in 1632. In these pieces he shows himself at his best. His sacred poems, which had appeared in the Opera (1642), were reprinted by Lauder in his Poetarum Scotorum musae sacrae (1739). The earliest lives are by Lauder and Benson (in Psalmi Davidici, 1741). Ruddiman's Vindication of Mr George Buchanan's Paraphrase (1745) began a pamphlet controversy regarding the merits of the rival poets.

R. Eddison. His notable works include The Worm Ouroboros (1922) and the Zimiamvian Trilogy (1935‚Äì1958). Biography Born in Adel, Leeds, Eddison's early education came from a series of private tutors, whom he shared with the young Arthur Ransome. Ransome recalls Eddison's daring and Machiavellian methods of getting rid of unpopular teachers in his autobiography.Arthur Ransome, The Autobiography of Arthur Ransome, ed. R. Hart-Davis (London: Jonathan Cape, 1976), 37‚Äì40. Afterwards Eddison was educated at Eton and Trinity College, Oxford and joined the Board of Trade in 1906, retiring in 1938 to work full-time on his fiction. He was also a member of the Viking Society for Northern Research.\\"Books and Authors\\", The New York Times Book Review, 13 June 1926, p. 23 During a distinguished career he was appointed a Companion of the Order of St. Michael and St. George in 1924 and a Companion of the Order of the Bath In 1929 for public service with the Board of Trade. He and his wife, Molly Eddison, had one child, a daughter. Their son-in-law, Kenneth Hesketh Higson, a Royal Air Force pilot, died in an air fight over Italy in the Second World War.A Fish Dinner in Memison, dedication Writing Eddison is best known for the early romance The Worm Ouroboros (1922) and for three volumes set in the imaginary world Zimiamvia, known as the Zimiamvian Trilogy: Mistress of Mistresses (1935), A Fish Dinner in Memison (1941), and The Mezentian Gate (1958). Eddison was an occasional member of the Inklings, an informal literary discussion group associated with the University of Oxford, and his early works of high fantasy drew strong praise from J. R. R. TolkienJ.R.R. Tolkien, Letters, ed. Humphrey Carpenter (Houghton Mifflin, 1981), Letter No. 199. and C. S. Lewis,C. S. Lewis, On Stories and Other Essays on Literature, \\"Tribute to E. R. Eddison. both of whom where also members of the group. Later, these early works would also draw praise from Ursula K. Le Guin.Ursula Le Guin, The Language of the Night, \\"From Elfland to Poughkeepsie\\". Tolkien generally approved Eddison's literary style, but found the underlying philosophy rebarbative; while Eddison in turn thought Tolkien's views \\"soft\\". Other admirers of Eddison's work included James Stephens, who wrote the introduction to the 1922 edition; James Branch Cabell, who provided a foreword for the 1926 American edition; Robert Silverberg, who described The Worm Ouroboros as \\"the greatest high fantasy of them all\\";Quoted in The Worm Ouroboros, Millenium Fantasy Masterworks Series, 2000 (pg. 1). and Clive Barker.Douglas E. Winter, Clive Barker: The Dark Fantastic, HarperCollins, 2002, pp. 67, 305. Eddison's books are written in a meticulously recreated Jacobean prose style, seeded throughout with fragments, often acknowledged but often directly copied from his favorite authors and genres: Homer and Sappho, Shakespeare and Webster, Norse sagas and French medieval lyric poems. Critic Andy Sawyer has noted that such fragments seem to arise naturally from the \\"barbarically sophisticated\\" worlds Eddison has created.Andy Sawyer, \\"Eddison, E(ric) R(√ºcker)\\", St. James Guide To Fantasy Writers, ed. David Pringle, St. James Press, 1996, , pp. 176‚Äì8. The books exhibit a thoroughly aristocratic sensibility; heroes and villains alike maintain an Olympian indifference to convention. Fellow fantasy author Michael Moorcock wrote that Eddison's characters, particularly his villains, are more vivid than Tolkien's.Michael Moorcock, Wizardry & Wild Romance: A Study of Epic Fantasy, , p. 47. Others have observed that while it is historically accurate to depict the great of the world trampling on the lower classes, Eddison's characters often treat their subjects with arrogance and insolence, and this is depicted as part of their greatness.L. Sprague de Camp, Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy, , pp. 132‚Äì3. Indeed, at the end of The Worm Ouroboros, the heroes, finding peace dull, pray for ‚Äì and get ‚Äì the revival of their enemies, so that they may go and fight them again.L. Sprague de Camp, Literary Swordsmen and Sorcerers: The Makers of Heroic Fantasy, , p. 116. Fantasy historian Brian Attebery notes that \\"Eddison's fantasies uphold a code that is unabashedly Nietzschean; had he written after World War II, his enthusiasm for supermen and heroic conflict might perhaps have been tempered\\".Brian Attebury, \\"E.R. Eddison\\", Supernatural Fiction Writers: Fantasy and Horror, ed. E. F. Bleiler, Scribner, 1985. , pp. 529‚Äì534 The Zimiamvia books were conceived not as a trilogy but as part of a larger work left incomplete at Eddison's death. The Mezentian Gate itself is unfinished, though Eddison provided summaries of the missing chapters shortly before his death. C. S. Lewis wrote a blurb for the cover of The Mezentian Gate when it was published calling Eddison's works \\"first and foremost, of art.\\" Some additional material from this book was published for the first time in the volume Zimiamvia: A Trilogy (1992). Eddison wrote three other books: Poems, Letters, and Memories of Philip Sidney Nairn (1916), Styrbiorn the Strong (1926) and Egil's Saga (1930). The first was his tribute to a Trinity College friend, a poet, who, according to this source, died May 18, 1914, age 30, in Malaya, where he was a colonial administrator. According to another, possibly less reliable source, he is said to have died in his youth during World War I. The other two relate to the saga literature; the first is a historical novel which retells Styrbjarnar √æ√°ttr Sv√≠akappa (alluded to in Eyrbyggja Saga and Heimskringla). The second is a direct translation from Egil's saga, supplemented with extensive notes, some which explain Eddison's aesthetic and philosophical outlook.

Andrew Melville (1 August 1545 - 1622) was a Scottish scholar, theologian, poet and religious reformer. His fame encouraged scholars from the European continent to study at Glasgow and St. Andrews. He was born at Baldovie, on 1 August 1545, the youngest son of Richard Melville of Baldovie, and Geills, daughter of Thomas Abercrombie of Montrose. He was educated at the Grammar School, Montrose, and University of St Andrews. He later went to France in 1564, and studied law at Poitiers. He became regent in the College of Marceon, and took part in the defence of Poitiers against the Huguenots. He then proceeded to Geneva, where he was appointed Professor of Humanity. He returned to Scotland in 1574 and was appointed Principal of the University of Glasgow in autumn of that year. He did much to establish the University on a proper footing and founded four chairs in Languages, Science and Philosophy. He was admitted as minister of Govan in conjunction 13 July 1577. Melville was elected Moderator of the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland on 24 April 1578. He opposed the Episcopal tendency in the Church, and did much to establish the Presbyterian form of government. He further did much to remodel the Scottish Universities, especially St Andrews; St Mary's thereafter being devoted to Divinity, Melville being appointed Principal thereof in November 1580. He was again elected Moderator of the General Assembly 24 April and 27 June 1582, and 20 June 1587. In the Assembly of October 1581, he took an active part in the libel against Robert Montgomery, Bishop of Glasgow, for simoniacal practices. Melville was appointed on a commission to wait upon James VI in 1582, with a remonstrance and petition which, notwithstanding the entreaties of his friends, he presented. On 15 February 1584 he was summoned before the Privy Council for alleged treason in a sermon preached at St Andrews the June previous, and ordered to be imprisoned at Blackness, but his friends assisted him to escape to England. On Arran's fall he returned to Scotland and was restored by Parliament at Linlithgow in December 1585. In 1590 he became rector of the University of St Andrews, which office he held until 1597, and at the coronation of the Queen, 17 May 1590, he recited a Latin poem, the Stephaniskion. He was again appointed Moderator of the General Assembly, 7 May 1594, but on a visitation of the University by the King in June 1597, he was deprived of his rectorship. He attended the General Assembly at Dundee, March 1598, but was ordered to withdraw by the King. In 1599 he was appointed Dean of the Faculty of Theology. He caused the Synod of Fife in 1599 to censure certain propositions in the Basilieon Doron by the King. At the Assembly at Montrose in March 1600 he unsuccessfully claimed his right to sit, but was successful in that at Burntisland May 1601. He took part in that held at Aberdeen in 1605 and offered, with others, a protest to Parliament at Perth in 1606 in favour of the right of free Assembly. For this he was summoned with others to London, where he was cited before the English Privy Council for writing a bitter Latin epigram against the accessories of Anglican worship and placed under the custody of John Overal, D.D., Dean of St Paul's, and afterwards of Bilson, Bishop of Winchester. Again brought before the Privy Council, he broke into a violent tirade against that Court and was committed to solitary confinement in the Tower. Henri de la Tour, Duke de Bouillon, having obtained his release, appointed him to the Chair of Biblical Theology in the University of Sedan, and Melville embarked for France 19 April 1611. He died unmarried after a series of illnesses at Sedan in 1622. Early life and early education He was born at Baldovie near Montrose, Angus, the youngest son of Richard Melville (brother to Melville of Dysart). Andrew was the youngest of nine sons of Richard Melville of Baldovy, near Montrose, where he was born 1 August 1545. He is described as the ninth son, yet speaks in a letter of 1612 as having outlived his ‚Äòfourteen brethren.‚Äô His father lost his life in the battle of Pinkie, when Andrew was only two years old and, his mother dying soon after, he was brought up under the care of his eldest brother Richard (1522‚Äì1575), afterwards minister of Maryton, who, at a proper age, sent him to the grammar school of Montrose. At an early age Melville began to show a taste for learning, and his brother did everything in his power to give him the best education. He learned the rudiments of Latin at the grammar school of Montrose, after leaving which he learned Greek for two years under Pierre de Marsilliers, a Frenchman whom John Erskine of Dun had persuaded to settle at Montrose; such was Melville's proficiency that on going to the University of St Andrews he astonished the professors by using the Greek text of Aristotle, which no one else there understood. On completing his course, Melville left St Andrews with the reputation of \\"the best poet, philosopher, and Grecian of any young master in the land.\\" Travels and study in Europe In 1564, at nineteen years of age, he set out for France to complete his education at the University of Paris. Having graduated at St. Andrews, he repaired to France in the autumn of 1564, reaching Paris from Dieppe after a roundabout and stormy voyage. He now attained great fluency in Greek, made acquirements in oriental languages, studied mathematics and law, and came under the direct influence of Peter Ramus, whose new methods of teaching he subsequently transplanted to Scotland. He also attended the last course of lectures delivered by Adrianus Turnebus, professor of Greek, as well as those of Petrus Ramus, whose philosophical method and plan of teaching Melville later introduced into the universities of Scotland. It was also in Paris where Melville studied Hebrew under Jean Mercier, one of the leading hebraists of that time. From Paris he went to Poitiers (1566) to study civil law, and though only twenty-one was apparently at once made a regent in the college of St Marceon. After three years, however, political troubles compelled him to leave France, and he went to Geneva, where he was welcomed by Theodore Beza, at whose instigation he was appointed to the chair of humanity in the academy of Geneva. Scottish academic A fanciful Victorian depiction of Melville upbraiding bishops in the presence of James VI In addition to teaching, Melville continued to study Oriental literature, and in particular acquired from Cornelius Bertram, one of his brother professors, a knowledge of Syriac. At Geneva as early as 1570 he met Joseph Scaliger and Francis Hottoman, who in 1572, after the massacre on St. Bartholomew's day, took up their abode in that city. While he lived at Geneva the massacre of St Bartholomew in 1572 drove immense numbers of Protestant refugees to that city, including several of the most distinguished French men of letters of the time. Among these were several men learned in civil law, and political science, and associating with them increased Melville's knowledge and enlarged his ideas of civil and ecclesiastical liberty. In 1574 Melville returned to Scotland, and almost immediately received the appointment of Principal of the University of Glasgow, and began its renewal. Besides his duties in the university, he officiated as minister of the church of Govan, in the vicinity. Melville set himself to establish a good educational system. He enlarged the curriculum, and established chairs in languages, science, philosophy and divinity, which were confirmed by charter in 1577. His fame spread, and students flocked from all parts of Scotland and beyond. He assisted in the reconstruction of the University of Aberdeen in 1575, and to do for St Andrews what he had done for Glasgow, he was appointed Principal of St Mary's College, St Andrews, in 1580. His duties there comprised the teaching of theology, Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac and Rabbinical languages. As a member of the General Assembly, he took a prominent part in all the measures of that body against episcopacy ; and as he was unflinching in his opposition to that form of church government, he received the name of Episcopomastix, or The Scourge of Bishops. A remarkable instance of his intrepidity occurred at an interview, which took place in October 1577, between him and the Regent Morton, when the latter, irritated at the proceedings of the Assembly, exclaimed, \\"There will never be quietness in this country till half a dozen of you be hanged or banished!\\" \\"Hark! Sir\\", said Melville, \\"threaten your courtiers after that manner! It is the same to me whether I rot in the air, or in the ground. The earth is the Lord's. Patria est ubicunque est bene. I have been ready to give up my life where it would not have been half so well wared, at the pleasure of my God. I have lived out of your country ten years, as well as in it. Let God be glorified, it will not be in your power to hang or exile his truth.\\" This bold language Morton did not venture to resent. Melville created a fashion for the study of Greek literature. The reforms, however, which his new modes of teaching involved, and even some of his new doctrines, such as the non-infallibility of Aristotle, brought him into conflict with other teachers in the university. Moderator of the Church's General Assembly Henderson, Knox, Melville. Valley Cemetery, Stirling Disruption brooch showing the graves of Andrew Melville, John Knox, David Welsh, James Renwick, and Alexander Henderson Melville was moderator of the General Assembly which met at Edinburgh 24 April 1578, in which the second Book of Discipline was approved of. The attention of the Assembly was about this time directed to the reformation and improvement of the universities, and Melville was, in December 1580, removed from Glasgow, and installed principal of St. Mary's college, St. Andrews. Here, besides giving lectures in divinity, he taught the Hebrew, Chaldee, Syriac, and Rabbinical languages, and his prelections were attended, not only by young students in unusual numbers, but also by some of the masters of the other colleges. He was moderator of the Assembly which met at St. Andrews on 24 April 1582, and also of an extraordinary meeting of the Assembly, convened at Edinburgh on 27 June thereafter, in consequence of the arbitrary measures of the court, in relation particularly to the case of Robert Montgomery, the excommunicated Archbishop of Glasgow. He opened the proceedings with a sermon, in which he boldly inveighed against the absolute authority claimed by the government in ecclesiastical matters. A spirited remonstrance being agreed to by the Assembly, Melville and others were appointed to present it to the king, then with the court at Perth. When the remonstrance was read before his majesty in council, the king's unworthy favourite, the earl of Arran, menacingly exclaimed, \\"Who dare subscribe these treasonable articles?\\" \\"We dare\\", said the undaunted Melville, and taking a pen, immediately signed his name. His example was followed by the other commissioners, and so much were Lennox and Arran over-awed by their intrepidity, that they dismissed them peaceably. For about three years Melville had preached, assisted by his nephew, in the parish church of St. Andrews. In February 1584 he was cited before the privy council, to answer a charge of treason, founded on some seditious expressions, which it was alleged he had made use of in a sermon on the 4th chapter of Daniel, on the occasion of a fast kept during the preceding month; particularly that he had compared the king's mother to Nebuchadnezzar, who was banished from the kingdom, and would be restored again. At his appearance, he denied using these words, entered into a full defence of those he had actually used, and presented a protest and declinature, claiming to be tried by the ecclesiastical court. When brought before the king and council, he boldly told them that they had exceeded their jurisdiction in judging of the doctrine, or calling to account any of the ambassadors or messengers of a king and council greater than they, and far above them. Then loosing a little Hebrew bible from his belt, and throwing it on the table before them, he said, \\"That you may see your weakness, oversight, and rashness, in taking upon you that which neither you ought nor can do, there are my instructions and warrant. Let me see which of you can judge of them or control me therein, that I have passed by my injunctions.\\" Arran, finding the book in Hebrew, put it into the king's hands, saying, \\" Sir, he scorns your majesty and council.\\" \\"No, my lord\\", replied Melville, \\" I scorn not, but with all earnestness, zeal, and gravity, I stand for the cause of Jesus Christ and his church.\\" Not being able to prove the charge against him, and unwilling to let him go, the council declared him guilty of declining their jurisdiction, and of behaving irreverently before them, and sentenced him to be imprisoned in the castle of Edinburgh, and to be further punished in his person and goods at the pleasure of the king. Before, however, being charged to enter himself in ward, his place of confinement was ordered to be changed to Blackness Castle, which was kept by a dependant of Arran. While at dinner the king's macer was admitted and gave him the charge to enter within 24 hours: but he avoided being sent there by secretly withdrawing from Edinburgh. After staying some time at Berwick, he proceeded to London, and in the ensuing July visited the universities of Oxford and Cambridge, at both of which he was received in a manner becoming his learning and reputation. From England to St Andrews Andrew Melville Hall at the University of St Andrews He returned to Scotland in November 1585 after an absence of twenty months, and in March 1586 resumed his lectures in St Andrews, where he continued for twenty years; he became rector of the University in 1590. On the disgrace of the earl of Arran, Melville returned to Scotland with the banished lords, in November 1585. Having assisted in re-organising the college of Glasgow, he resumed, in the following March, his duties at St. Andrews. The synod of Fife, which met in April, proceeded to excommunicate Patrick Adamson, Archbishop of St. Andrews, for his attempts to overturn the presbyterian form of government in the church; and, in return, that prelate issued a sentence of excommunication against Melville, and his nephew, James Melville, with others of their brethren. In consequence of this difference with the archbishop, Melville received a written mandate from the king to confine his residence to the north of the Tay, and he was not restored to his office in the university till the following August. Some time after, when Adamson had been deprived of his archbishopric, and was reduced to great poverty, finding himself deserted by the king, he addressed a letter to his former antagonist, Melville, expressing regret for his past conduct, and soliciting his assistance. Melville hastened to visit him, and not only procured contributions for his relief among his friends, but continued for several months to support him from his own resources. In June 1587, Melville was again elected moderator of the Assembly, and nominated one of the commissioners for attending to the proceedings in parliament. He was present at the coronation of the queen, 17 May 1590, and recited a Latin poem composed for the occasion, which was immediately published at the desire of the king. In the same year he was elected rector of the university of St. Andrews, an office which, for a series of years, he continued to hold by re-election. In May 1594 he was again elected moderator of the Assembly. Shortly after, he appeared on behalf of the church before the lords of the articles, and urged the forfeiture of the popish lords, and along with his nephew and two other ministers, he accompanied the king, at his express request, on his expedition against them. In October 1594 he was with the king at Huntly Castle and argued for its demolition.Robert Pitcairn, Autobiography and diary of James Melville (Edinburgh, 1842), pp. 314, 319. In the following year, when it was proposed to recall the popish nobles from exile, he went with some other ministers to the convention of estates at St. Andrews, to remonstrate against the design, but was ordered by the king to withdraw, which he did, after a most resolute reply. The commission of the Assembly having met at Cupar in Fife, they sent Melville and some other members to expostulate with the king. Being admitted to a private audience, James Melville began to address his majesty with great mildness and respect; but the king becoming impatient, charged them with sedition, on which Andrew took him by the sleeve, and calling him \\"God's silly vassal\\", said, > This is not a time to flatter, but to speak plainly, for our commission is > from the living God, to whom the king is subject. We will always humbly > reverence your majesty in public, but having opportunity of being with your > majesty in private, we must discharge our duty, or else be enemies to > Christ: And now, Sire, I must tell you that there are two kingdoms‚Äîthe > kingdom of Christ, which is the church, whose subject King James VI. is, and > of whose kingdom he is not a head, nor a lord, but a member; and they whom > Christ hath called, and commanded to watch over his church, and govern his > spiritual kingdom, have sufficient power and authority from him so to do, > which no Christian king nor prince should control or discharge, but assist > and support, otherwise they are not faithful subjects to Christ. The king listened patiently to this bold admonition, and dismissed them with many fair promises which he never intended to fulfil. For several years following King James made repeated attempts to control the church, according to his own arbitrary notions, but he invariably encountered a strenuous opponent in Andrew Melville; and he had recourse at last to one of those stratagems which he thought the very essence of \\"king-craft\\", to secure the removal of this champion of presbyterianism from Scotland altogether. During the whole time he protected the liberties of the Scottish Church against all encroachments of the government. That in the main he was fighting for the constitutionally guaranteed rights of the Church is generally accepted. The chief charge against Melville is that his fervour often led him to forget the reverence due to an \\"anointed monarch\\". When the king acted in an arbitrary and illegal manner he needed the reminder that though he was king over men he was only \\"God's silly vassal.\\" Melville's rudeness (if it is to be called so) was the outburst of just indignation from a man zealous for the purity of religion and regardless of consequences to himself. His nephew James Melville, who was present, records the famous statement he made in Falkland in private to King James VI of Scotland, later to become King James I of England . Calling him \\"God's sillie vassal\\" and taking him by the sleeve, he said, > Sir, we will humblie reverence your Majestie always, namlie in public, but > sen we have this occasioun to be with your Majestie in privat, and the > treuthe is, yie ar brought in extream danger bathe of your lyff and croun, > and with yow, the country and Kirk of Christ is lyk to wrak, for nocht > telling yow the treuthe, and giffen of yow fathfull counsall, we mon [must] > discharge our dewtie thairin, or els be trators bathe to Christ and yow!

King James and imprisonment In 1599 he was deprived of the rectorship, but was made dean of the faculty of theology. The close of Melville's career in Scotland was at length brought about by James in characteristic fashion. In May 1606, Melville, with his nephew, and six of their brethren, were called to London by a letter from the king, on the specious pretext that his majesty wished to consult them as to the affairs of the church. Soon after their arrival they attended the famous conference held 23 September, in presence of the king at Hampton Court, at which Melville spoke at great length, and with a boldness which astonished the English nobility and clergy. On St. Michael's day, Melville and his brethren were commanded to attend the royal chapel, when, scandalized at the popish character of the service, on his return to his lodging he vented his indignation in a Latin epigram, for which, a copy having been conveyed to the king, he was brought before the council at Whitehall. Being by them found guilty of \\"scandalum magnatum,\\" he was committed first to the custody of the dean of St. Paul's, and afterwards to the charge of the bishop of Winchester; but was ultimately sent to the Tower, where he remained a prisoner for four years. * The following is the epigram: Cur stant clausi Anglis libri duo regia in ara, Lumina casca duo, pollubra sicca duo? Num sensum cultumque Dei tenet Anglia clausum, Luniine exca suo, sorde sepulta sua? Romano an ritu, dum regalem instruit aram, Turpuream pingit religiosa lupam ? *Thus rendered in an old translation: Why stand there on the altar high Two closed books, blind lights, two basins dry? Doth England hold God's mind and worship close. Blind of her sight, and buried in her dross? Doth she, with chapel put in Romish dress, The purple whore religiously express? *And for this Melville was sent to the tower. At first he was treated with the utmost rigour, and denied even the use of pen, ink, and paper; but his spirit remained unsubdued, and he beguiled his solitary hours by composing Latin verses, which, with the tongue of his shoe buckle, he engraved on his prison walls. By the interference of some friends at court, his confinement was, after the lapse of nearly ten months, rendered less severe. About the end of 1607 the Protestants of Rochelle endeavoured to obtain his services as professor of divinity in their college, but the king would not consent to his liberation. Freed to France At length, in February 1611, at the intercession of the duke of Bouillon, he was released from confinement, on condition of his becoming professor of theology in the Protestant university of Sedan, in France, where he spent the remainder of his life, and died there in 1622, at the advanced age of 77. On being freed, but refused permission to return to his own country, he was invited to fill a professor's chair in the Academy of Sedan, and there he spent the last eleven years of his life. Personal life His biographer, Dr. M'Crie, says that Andrew Melville \\"was the first Scotsman who added a taste for elegant literature to an extensive acquaintance with theology.\\" Although he sustained a conspicuous part in all the important public transactions of his time, he neither was nor affected to be the leader of a party. In private he was an agreeable companion, remarkable for his cheerfulness and kindliness of disposition. He was never married. Beyond the statement that he was of low stature there is no description of his personal appearance extant, nor is there any known portrait of him. The greater part of his writings consists of Latin poems. Dr. M'Crie, whose Life of Andrew Melville was published in 1824, in 2 volumes, has given the names of all his works, printed and left in manuscript, and there is none of any great extent among them.

The section which first opened in November 1962, was the Athens-Corinth route, forming part of European route E94 (although the section Megara-Kineta (Kakia Skala pass) opened in late 1964, with motorway characteristics). The section Corinth-Patras was the next to follow in 1969, as a 14m width undivided road (except for the Aigio bypass, which opened in 1973 also with motorway characteristics). Throughout the 1990s, the E94 part of the route was upgraded to motorway standards; while between 1999 and 2006, further upgrades took place at the Kakia Skala pass, converting a rather narrow and hazardous section of motorway into a state-of-the-art modern motorway, with 3 lanes per direction and a network of five tunnels and several bridges. Between 1997 and 2015, the expanded section ended near Corinth, from which it continued as a limited-access single carriageway. In 2015 the upgraded section ended near Zevgolateio and in 2016 it ended at Kiato. The remainder, between Kiato and Rio, was opened in April 2017, and the EO8a has ceased to exist.

OHIP is funded by a payroll deduction tax by residents who are gainfully employed, by businesses in the province of Ontario, and by transfer payments from the Government of Canada. Every Ontario resident with his or her primary and permanent home in Ontario is entitled to access emergency and preventive care under OHIP free of charge. Ontario residents may go to a participating doctor--essentially every doctor practising in the province--any time they wish (subject to the consent of the doctor) and the services are billed through OHIP to the government. OHIP does not generally cover prescription drugs outside of hospitals or dental care. However, the Ontario Drug Benefit program pays for prescription drugs for seniors covered by OHIP and the Trillium Drug Program covers households with high prescription drug costs. As of 1 January 2018, prescription drugs for those under 25 years of age are covered by OHIP through OHIP+. In 2018, the Ontario Health Insurance Plan announced a new program designed to assist individuals struggling with food addiction. As of 1 April 2019, the Ontario government will no longer offer free prescriptions to children and young adults with private coverage. Funding While Ontario receives transfer payments from the Government of Canada to partially fund health care, OHIP is also supported by general provincial tax revenues and premiums (taxes) paid by employers and individuals. Employers are charged a payroll health care tax (with an exemption for small businesses), and residents of the province pay a health premium (introduced in 2004) as part of their income taxes. Similarly, Ontario publicly funds hospitals. The Ontario Health Premium (OHP) is a component of Ontario's Personal Income Tax system. The OHP is based on taxable income for a taxation year. As of May 2010, an Ontario resident with taxable income (i.e., income after subtracting allowable deductions) of $21,000 pays $60 per year. With a taxable income of $22,000, the premium doubles to $120. With a taxable income of $23,000, the premium is $180. With a taxable income of $24,000, the premium is $240. The premium increases at a decreasing rate thereafter for taxable incomes up to $200,600 at which point the maximum premium of $900 is reached.Ontario Health Premium Rate Chart Delisted care Until 2004, OHIP also paid for an eye examination every two years and limited chiropractic and physical therapy/physiotherapy services. The May 2004 budget, however, announced that most eye exams and all chiropractic and physical therapy would be \\"delisted\\" (removed) from coverage, by the Liberal government of Dalton McGuinty. Physiotherapy ended up never being delisted from OHIP. Instead, effective April 1, 2005, OHIP coverage for physiotherapy was restricted to those 65 years of age and over, those 19 years of age and under, residents of long-term care homes (regardless of age), individuals who had been hospitalized (regardless of age) and individuals on the Ontario Disability Support Program, Family Benefits and Ontario Works (regardless of age). OHIP covers up to 50 visits per year post-hospitalization and up to 100 visits per year for residents of long-term care homes. The McGuinty government at the time promised to expand OHIP coverage for residents of long-term care homes and for residents of rural and remote areas. The provision continues to be made for free coverage to minors. Annual eye examinations are free for children (19 or younger), seniors (65 or older), adults ages 20‚Äì64 with certain ocular health conditions (including glaucoma, cataracts, and diabetes), as well as those receiving ODSP or Ontario Works (every two years). Eligibility In order to be eligible for coverage under OHIP, a person normally must be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident or a holder of a work permit as set out in Ontario's Health Insurance Act, must make his or her permanent and principal home in Ontario, and must be physically present in Ontario 153 days in any 12-month period. Canadian citizens or permanent residents returning to Canada from another country are not normally covered by OHIP until they have been resident in Ontario for three months. In 2009 applicants for permanent residence from within Canada were added to the plan following the \\"Approval In Principle\\" (AIP) stage of the process. Applicants from outside Canada continue to be ineligible for OHIP until they complete the landing process and actually become permanent residents, at which point the usual three-month waiting period begins. It is recommended to obtain private health insurance to cover the waiting period. For those Canadian citizens or permanent residents moving to Ontario from another province, the province of the previous residency will continue to cover them during the three-month waiting period.health.gov.on.ca Waiting period *Transfer from another province, territory, or country: 3 months *Military spouses: Immediate regardless of origin *Applicants for permanent residence from inside Canada: as long as it takes for AIP *Applicants for permanent residence from outside Canada: as long as it takes for PR (15‚Äì24 months as of April 2014) Precursors Ontario's first government-run health plan was known as OMSIP (Ontario Medical Services Insurance Plan), established and enacted on 1 July 1966.

Biography The son of Sir John Erskine, Laird of Dun, he was educated at King's College, University of Aberdeen. At the age of twenty-one Erskine was the cause ‚Äî probably by accident ‚Äî of a priest's death, and was forced to go abroad, where he came under the influence of the new learning. It was through him that Greek was first taught in Scotland by Pierre de Marsilliers, whom he brought to live at Montrose. This was a factor in the progress of the Reformation. Erskine was also drawn towards the new faith, being a close friend of George Wishart, the reformer, from whose fate he was saved by his wealth and influence, and of John Knox, who advised him to discountenance the mass openly. Erskine was a supporter of Mary of Guise during the war of the Rough Wooing and she wrote to him in March 1548 to thank him for his support of Mary, Queen of Scots, and recommended him to Henri II of France. In August 1549 Erskine objected to the appointment of Captain Beauchastell and a French garrison to the fort of Montrose. Guise wrote that he was still technically in command, and that, \\"Otherwise it is not best that such thing should be done, considering we have written so much good of your part to the king, and that now any thing should be shown of you in the contrary\\".HMC 5th Report (A. J. Erskine) (London, 1874), p. 635 (in Scots). In the stormy controversies of the time of Mary, Queen of Scots, and her son, James VI, Erskine was a conspicuous figure and a moderating influence. He was able to soothe the queen when her feelings had been outraged by Knox's denunciations ‚Äî being a man \\"most gentill of nature\\" ‚Äî and frequently acted as mediator both between the Roman Catholic and reforming parties, and among the reformers themselves. In 1560 he was appointed ‚Äî though a layman ‚Äî superintendent of the reformed church of Scotland for Angus and Mearns, and in 1572 he gave his assent to the modified episcopacy proposed by James Douglas, 4th Earl of Morton at the Leith convention. Following his ordination to the ministry in 1561,Fasti Ecclesiae Scoticanae, Revised and Enlarged edition 1925, Volume 5 p. 387. because he was held in such high esteem by the leaders of the church that he was elected moderator of the general assembly several times (first in 1564), and he was amongst those who in 1588 drew up the Second Book of Discipline. From 1579 he was a member of the king's council. Erskine owed his peculiar influence among the Scottish reformers to his personality; Queen Mary described him as \\"a mild and sweet-natured man, with true honesty and uprightness\\". Erskine married Agnes Ogilvy, daughter of Katherine Campbell (d. 1578) and James Ogilvy, Master of Ogilvy.

He served for two years and attained the rank of corporal. Snyder earned a degree in Chemistry in 1975 from Willamette and earned his M.D. degree from the University of Oregon Health Sciences Center (now Oregon Health & Science University) in Portland, Oregon in 1979. Snyder moved to Little Rock, Arkansas and served his residency at the University of Arkansas for Medical Sciences. In 1982 after completing his residency he worked as a family practice physician for 15 years. During this time he travelled overseas to volunteer his medical services at Cambodian refugee camps in Thailand, Salvadoran refugee camps in Honduras, and Ethiopian refugee camps in Sudan.

George Wishart or Wisehart was the son of James and brother of Sir John of Pitarrow, both ranking themselves on the side of the Reformers. He was educated at the University of Aberdeen, then recently founded, and travelled afterwards on the Continent. It is thought that it was while he was abroad that he first turned attention to the study of the Reformed doctrines. He engaged for some time in teaching at Montrose. Wishart afterwards proceeded to Cambridge and resided there for about six years, from 1538 to 1543. He returned to Scotland in the train of the Commissioners who had been appointed to arrange a marriage with Prince Edward and the Queen of Scots. He preached to the people with much acceptance at Montrose, Dundee, and throughout Ayrshire. On passing East to the Lothians, Wishart, who spoke latterly as in near prospect of death, was apprehended by Bothwell in the house of Cockburn, of Ormiston, and carried captive to St. Andrews, where he was tried by a clerical Assembly, found guilty, and condemned as an obstinate heretic. He was executed next day at the stake on Castle Green, his persecutor, Bethune (Cardinal Beaton), looking on the scene from the windows of the castle, where he himself was to be assassinated within three months. A woodcut portraying the martyrdom of Wishart Life He belonged to a younger branch of the Wisharts of Pitarrow near Fordoun, Kincardineshire. His mother was Elizabeth, sister of Sir James Learmonth, married James Wishart of Pitarrow in April 1512. He was probably called George after his maternal grandfather of granduncle Prior George Leirmont, the name was certainly derived from his mother's family. George's father, James Wishart, died in May 1525, therefore, his mother, Eliyabeth together with her brother, Sir James Learmont of Balcomie, were the two people who were responsible for George's upbringing. He may have graduated M.A., probably at King's College, Aberdeen, and was certainly a student at the University of Leuven, from which he graduated in 1531. He taught the New Testament in Greek as schoolmaster at Montrose in Angus, until investigated for heresy by the Bishop of Brechin in 1538. He fled to England, where a similar charge was brought against him at Bristol in the following year by Thomas Cromwell. Under examination by Archbishop Thomas Cranmer he recanted some utterances. In 1539 or 1540 he may have visited Germany and Switzerland, but by 1542 he had entered Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he studied and taught. In 1543 he returned to Scotland, in the train of a Scottish embassy which had come to London to consider the treaty of marriage between Prince Edward (later Edward VI of England) and the infant Mary, Queen of Scots. He returned to Montrose, where again he taught Scripture. He may have been the \\"Scottish man called Wishart\\" acting as a messenger to England for Alexander Crichton of Brunstane in a 1544 plot against Cardinal David Beaton. Some historians such as Alphons Bellesheim and Richard Watson Dixon have accepted this identification; others are sceptical. Other possibilities include a George Wishart, Baillie of Dundee, who allied himself with Beaton's murderers; and Sir John Wishart (died 1576), afterwards a Scottish judge. His career as an itinerant preacher began in 1544, from when he traveled Scotland from east to west. The story has been told by his disciple John Knox. He went from place to place, in danger of his life, denouncing the errors of the Papacy and the abuses in the churches of Montrose, Dundee (where he escaped an attempt on his life), Ayr, Perth, Edinburgh, Leith, Haddington (where Knox accompanied him) and elsewhere. At Ormiston in East Lothian, in January 1546, he was seized by Lord Bothwell on the orders of Cardinal Beaton, taken to Elphinstone Castle, and transferred by order of the privy council to Edinburgh castle on 19 January 1546. Thence he was handed over to Beaton, who had a \\"show trial\\", with John Lauder prosecuting Wishart. He was hanged on a gibbet and his body burned at St Andrews on 1 March 1546. Foxe and Knox attribute to him a prophecy of the death of the Cardinal, who was assassinated on 29 May following, partly in revenge for Wishart's death. Wishart's preaching in 1544-45 helped popularize the teachings of Calvin and Zwingli in Scotland. He translated into English the first Helvetic Confession of Faith in 1536. At his trial he refused to accept that confession was a sacrament, denied free will, recognized the priesthood of all believing Christians, and rejected the notion that the infinite God could be \\"comprehended in one place\\" between \\"the priest's hands\\". He proclaimed that the true Church was where the Word of God was faithfully preached and the two dominical sacraments rightly administered. Wishart's initials at the site of his execution Memorials The Martyrs Memorial at St Andrews was erected to the honour of George Wishart, Patrick Hamilton, and other martyrs of the Reformation era. Dundee's East Port (also known as Cowgate Port), the remains of a gateway in the town's walls, is known as the Wishart Arch. The Arch is the only surviving portion of the town's walls, and probably survived owing to a story that George Wishart preached from it in 1544 to plague victims. However this story has been described as 'probably-mythical' and the structure is thought to have been built around 1590, long after Wishart's death. Wishart was also commemorated in Dundee with a United Presbyterian church being named after him. Wishart church was built in Dundee' Cowgate in 1841 and could seat over 700 people. It was this church that the missionary Mary Slessor was a member of when she lived in Dundee. It was renamed Wishart Memorial Church in 1901, a year after it had become part of the United Free Church of Scotland, and 1929 became part of the Church of Scotland. In 1975 the church congregation was united with Dundee church and the building was sold to Dundee Cyrenians who turned it into a hostel for people with alcohol problems called the Wishart Centre. There is a house at Saint Kentigern College in Auckland, New Zealand, named after him. A lodge of the Scottish Orange Order, formed with a warrant in Dundee but often meeting in near by Forfar, is named The Wishart Arch Defenders in his honour. Bibliography *Reg. PC.

Career Cardinal Beaton was the sixth and youngest son of eleven children of John Beaton (Bethune) of Balfour in the county of Fife, and his wife Mary, daughter of Sir David Boswell of Balmuto. The Bethunes of Balfour were part of Clan Bethune, the Scottish branch of the noble French House of Bethune. The Cardinal is said to have been born in 1494. He was educated at the universities of St Andrews and Glasgow, and in his sixteenth year was sent to Paris, where he studied civil and canon law. In 1519 King James V of Scotland named him ambassador in France. In 1520, his uncle, James Beaton, Archbishop of Glasgow, named David Beaton Rector and Prebendary at Cambuslang. After his uncle became Archbishop of St. Andrews in 1522, he resigned the position of Commendator of Arbroath in favour of his nephew. In 1525 David Beaton returned from France and took a seat as Lord Abbot of Arbroath in the Scottish Parliament. In 1528 the King named him Lord Privy Seal. Between 1533 and 1542 he acted several times as King James V of Scotland's ambassador to France. He took a leading part in the negotiations connected with the King's marriages, first with Madeleine of France, and afterwards with Mary of Guise. In 1537 he was made coadjutor to his uncle at St. Andrews, with right of succession. In December 1537 Beaton was made Bishop of Mirepoix in Languedoc on the recommendation of King Francis I, and consecrated the following summer. Presumably he was ordained around that time. Also in 1538 he was appointed a Cardinal by Pope Paul III, under the title of St Stephen in the Caelian Hill. In February 1539 Cardinal Beaton succeeded his uncle as Archbishop of St. Andrews. In 1544, he was made Papal legate in Scotland. Politically, Beaton was preoccupied with the maintenance of the Franco-Scottish alliance, and opposing Anglophile political attitudes, which were associated with the clamour for Protestant reform in Scotland. Relations became strained between James V and his uncle, Henry VIII of England, who sought to detach Scotland from its allegiance to the Holy See and bring it into subjection to himself. Henry sent two successive embassies to Scotland to urge James to follow his example in renouncing the authority of the Pope in his dominions. King James declined to be drawn into Henry's plans and refused to leave his kingdom for a meeting with Henry. Hostilities broke out between the two kingdoms in 1542. The Cardinal was blamed by many for the war with England that led to the defeat at Solway Moss in November 1542. Cardinal Beaton's lodging in Edinburgh's Cowgate During Mary's reign 19th-century engraving of Cardinal Beaton Statue of Cardinal David Beaton, Scottish National Portrait Gallery Beaton saw himself as a devoted servant of the Crown. These royal arms are from his apartments in St. Andrews Castle, Fife. James V died at Falkland Palace on 14 December 1542. Beaton tried to become one of the regents for the infant sovereign Mary, Queen of Scots. He based his claim on an alleged will of the late King; but the will was generally regarded as forged, and The 2nd Earl of Arran, heir presumptive to the throne, was declared regent. A copy of the alleged will was preserved by Regent Arran. Dated 14 December 1542 in the King's bedchamber at Falkland Palace, it was witnessed by James Learmonth of Dairsie, Master Household; Henry Kemp of Thomastoun, Gentleman of the Chamber; Michael Durham, the King's doctor; John Tennent, William Kirkcaldy of Grange, Master Michael Dysart, Preceptor of St Anthony's at Leith; John Jordan, Rector of Yetham; Francis Aikman, perfumerer, and others at the bedside. However, the clerk who wrote the instrument, Henry Balfour, a canon of Dunkeld, was not a recognised notary.HMC, 11th Report, part VI, Manuscripts of the Duke of Hamilton, London (1887), pp.205,219-220 By order of the Regent, Beaton was committed to the custody of Lord Seton, and imprisoned at Dalkeith Palace and then Blackness Castle. A papal interdict followed the arrest of the Cardinal Primate, according to which all churches of the country should be closed and administering the sacraments should be suspended.Miranda, Salvador. \\"Beaton, David (1494‚Äì1546)\\", The Cardinals of the Holy Roman Church With Beaton out of power, the Anglophile party persuaded Regent Arran to make a marriage treaty with England on behalf of the infant Queen, and to appoint a number of Protestant preachers. The treaties signed at Greenwich in July 1543 stipulated that Mary would be accompanied by an English nobleman/gentleman (and his wife) until she was ten years old and afterwards would reside in England until the time of her marriage. The union of the thrones of England and Scotland which the treaty envisaged was controversial from the start. Its Anglo-centric policy was resisted by many who preferred to continue the Auld Alliance with France. Resistance to the treaty resulted in a surge in the popularity of the French faction and the release of Beaton from prison. The Treaty of Greenwich was rejected by the Scottish Parliament on 11 December 1543, leading to eight years of Anglo-Scottish conflict known as the Rough Wooing.Loades, David Michael. John Dudley, Duke of Northumberland, 1504‚Äì53. Oxford University Press, 1996. In 1543 Beaton regained power, having earlier drawn up the Secret Bond. Two English invasions followed - and for these many blamed Beaton. In December 1545 Beaton arranged for the arrest, trial and execution of Protestant preacher George Wishart, who on 28 March 1546 was strangled and afterwards burned. Wishart had many sympathisers, and this led to the assassination of the Cardinal soon afterwards. Death St. Andrews Castle Plots against Cardinal Beaton had begun circulating as early as 1544. The conspirators were led by Norman Leslie, master of Rothes, and William Kirkcaldy of Grange. The Leslies had suffered from the expansion of Beaton's interest in Fife; while Kirkcaldy's uncle, James Kirkcaldy of Grange, held Protestant sympathies and had been removed in 1543 as treasurer of the realm, through Beaton's influence. They were joined by John Leslie of Parkhill, one of the Fife lairds angered at the murder of Wishart.Merriman, Marcus. \\"Castilians in St Andrews (act. 1546‚Äì1547)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 accessed 15 Nov 2013 Leslie and Kirkcaldy managed to obtain admission to St Andrews Castle at daybreak of 29 May 1546, killing the porter in the process. They then murdered the Cardinal, mutilating the corpse and hanging it from a castle window.Lamont, Stewart. \\"Murder comes to the Archbishop\\", Christian History and Biography, 1 July 2008 At the time it was widely believed that his death was in the interests of Henry VIII of England, who regarded Beaton as the chief obstacle to his policy in Scotland; the Cardinal's murder was certainly a significant point in the eventual triumph of Protestantism north of the Border. At the time of his death, David Cardinal Beaton was Lord Chancellor of Scotland, Archbishop of St Andrews, and Cardinal Legate in Scotland.Herkless, John. Cardinal Beaton, Priest and Politician, William Blackwood & sons, Edinburgh, 1891 He was succeeded as Archbishop of Saint Andrews by Dr. John Hamilton. Marion Ogilvy Like many medieval prelates, Cardinal Beaton had a long-term mistress. His mistress, Marion Ogilvy, was born in 1500, the youngest daughter of James Ogilvy, 1st Lord Ogilvy of Airlie. After the deaths of her parents, she managed the family estates in Angus. Around 1520 she met and fell in love with David Beaton. They lived in Ethie Castle and produced eight children. According to Margaret H.B. Sanderson, their relationship, which appeared little different from marriage, offended those who wanted serious reform of the church, and who deplored the double standard by which prelates punished those who advocated the marriage of the clergy yet lived in open concubinage in violation of the rule of clerical celibacy.Sanderson, Margaret H. B., \\"Ogilvy, Marion (d. 1575)\\", Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2005 accessed 15 Nov 2013 Cardinal Beaton's oldest surviving son, David Beaton of Melgund, became a Protestant, and later became master of the household to James VI and to Anne of Denmark. His daughter Margaret married David Lindsay, 10th Earl of Crawford, and Agnes married Alexander Gordon of Gight. See also * Cardinal Beaton, a play based on his life.

Henry Wardlaw (died 6 April 1440) was a Scottish church leader, Bishop of St Andrews and founder of the University of St Andrews. Ancestors He was descended from an ancient Saxon family which came to Scotland with Edgar Atheling, and was hospitably received by Malcolm Canmore. His grandfather, Sir H. Wardlaw of Torry, Fifeshire, married a niece of Walter Stewart, 6th High Steward of Scotland, and had by her Andrew, his successor, and Walter Wardlaw (d. 1390), Bishop of Glasgow, who is said to have been made a cardinal by the antipope Clement VII in 1381. Sir Andrew married the daughter and heiress of James de Valoniis, and had Walter and Henry, the bishop. In 1378 Cardinal Wardlaw petitioned the pope for a canonry of Glasgow with expectation of a prebend for his nephew, who must have been then a mere boy, as he lived for sixty-two years afterwards. Early Life He was educated at the universities of Oxford and of Paris. In the book of the procurators of the English nation in the latter university his name appears among the ‚Äòdeterminantes‚Äô of 1383. In a petition to the pope of 1388 he is described as ‚Äòa licentiate in arts who has studied civil law for two years at Orleans.‚Äô He afterwards studied the canon law, and took the degree of doctor. During the papal schism Scotland was on the side of the anti-popes, and, through the favour of Antipope Clement VII and Antipope Benedict XIII (Peter de Luna), Wardlaw held simultaneously canonries and prebends in Glasgow, Moray, and Aberdeen, the precentorships of Glasgow and Moray, and the church of Cavers. Bishop He passed some time at Avignon, and it was while at the papal court that he was chosen Bishop of St Andrews; he was consecrated in 1403. Returning to Scotland, he acted as tutor to the future King James I of Scotland, and finished the work of restoring the cathedral at St Andrews. He greatly improved the interior and enriched it with encaustic tiles and stained-glass windows. He also built the Gare bridge at the mouth of the Eden, which was then considered one of the finest in Scotland. Having helped to bring about the release of James from his captivity in England, he crowned the king in May 1424, and afterwards acted as one of his principal advisers. He appears to have been an excellent bishop. The chief blot on his episcopate was the burning of John Resby, an English priest, at Perth in 1407, and of Pavel Krava≈ô, a Bohemian, at St. Andrews in 1432, for teaching the tenets of Wycliffe. He does not appear to have been himself an active promoter of persecution. Resby was apprehended by Lawrence of Lindores, and the king conferred the abbey of Melrose on John Fogo for his zeal in convicting Krava≈ô. It may also be pleaded in extenuation of Wardlaw's conduct that the spirit of persecution then raged throughout Christendom, and that the Scottish parliament in 1425 enacted that all bishops should make inquisition of Lollards and other heretics in their dioceses. University of St Andrews Wardlaw's chief claim to fame is the fact that he was the founder of the University of St Andrews, the first university in Scotland. He issued the charter of foundation in February 1411, and the privileges of the new seat of learning were confirmed by a bull of the Avignon Pope Benedict XIII, dated 28 August 1413. The university was to be \\"an impregnable rampart of doctors and masters to resist heresy.\\" References  Category:1440 deaths Category:Bishops of St Andrews Category:15th-century Roman Catholic bishops Category:Chancellors of the University of St Andrews Category:Year of birth unknown ","title":"Henry Wardlaw"},{"id":"334705","text":"This is a list of the most prominent historians of Canada.

It was previously a company that was family-owned-and-operated by the Henry family that was based in New Braunfels, Texas. Schlitterbahn opened its first location, Schlitterbahn Waterpark Resort, in 1979. At its peak, the company consisted of five outdoor waterparks, two indoor waterparks, and three resorts. Schlitterbahn's outdoor water parks are seasonally-operated, typically open from late April through mid-September, while its indoor locations operate year-round. Two parks are located in Texas. On June 13, 2019, Cedar Fair entered an agreement to acquire two of Schlitterbahn's properties in Galveston and New Braunfels for $261 million. The deal, which closed in early July 2019, gives Cedar Fair the option to purchase Schlitterbahn Waterpark Kansas City for $6 million within 120 days of the transaction which Cedar Fair declined to do. Additionally, the rights to the Schlitterbahn name were included in the acquisition. Current parks =New Braunfels, Texas= Entrance to Schlitterbahn in New Braunfels, Texas The first of the parks was in New Braunfels and opened in 1979. The park was named \\"slippery road\\" in German because of the local area's German heritage. It originally consisted of four waterslides. The park expanded three times. Surfenberg was the first part of the expansion and had the world's first inland surfing ride, the Boogie Bahn, in 1992, created the first uphill water coaster, the Dragon Blaster in 1994. In 1996 the next section opened - Blastenhoff - and featured the world's first wave river, the Torrent, and the world's most award-winning uphill water coaster, the Master Blaster. In 2011, the park expanded again, adding The Falls, the world's longest tubing river, featuring rapids and tube chutes. As of 2019, the park had won Amusement Today's Golden Ticket Award for 22 years straight. In total Schlitterbahn New Braunfels has received 39 Golden Ticket Awards. The park currently employs 2,000 seasonal workers. =Galveston, Texas= Schlitterbahn in Galveston, Texas The 26-acre Schlitterbahn park in Galveston opened in 2006, and is open for part of every month of the year. The park features the most thrill rides of any of the Schlitterbahn parks and is home to the world's tallest water coaster, MASSIV. MASSIV opened in 2016 and features the most current technology including water and power saving features never used before. MASSIV holds the Guinness Book of World Records title for the Tallest Water Coaster and is 81 feet, 6 inches tall. Former parks =South Padre Island, Texas= The park in South Padre Island opened in 2001. An indoor section opened in 2012. The park features Transportainment - a system where guests can ride through the majority of the park's attractions while floating in their tubes. In fact, this park has floating queue lines for three of the four uphill water coasters. When the Henrys sold the company to Cedar Fair, they retained the ownership of this property and will rebrand it. The park was rebranded as Beach Park at Isla Blanca in December 2019.https://schlitterbahnnews.com/2019/08/schlitterbahn-south-padre-begins- roll-out-of-new-name-beach-park/ =Corpus Christi, Texas= In May 2012, Schlitterbahn announced that it would move forward with plans to begin construction of a new water park in the Corpus Christi-Padre Island area. It was announced that the park would open during the summer of 2013, but due to various delays groundbreaking didn't take place until February 2013. A 574-acre plan for the city includes a marina, the Schlitterbahn water park with lodging, and a golf course. Vendors complained, and even sued, Schlitterbahn over $500,000 in unpaid bills on the Corpus Christi project. After several months, Schlitterbahn paid the vendors and threw them a party. Schlitterbahn Corpus Christi opened on June 20, 2015, with a full-service restaurant, the Veranda, two kids areas, the Krystal river system, the Sky Blaster and the Aquaveyer. In 2016 the southern end of the park opened along with a resort. Christened Schlitterbahn Riverpark - Corpus Christi, the park features nearly 2 miles of river and multiple blasters. In 2017 Padre's Plunge, a SkyTrans Manufacturing Shoot the Chute, opened in the southern end of the park. The ride had previously operated as \\"Buzzsaw Falls\\" at Alabama Splash Adventure. This park features four types of rivers, two children's area, a massive swim-up bar, a stage for concerts, a resort with several event spaces, and a full-service restaurant. On May 1, 2018, IBC Bank took over ownership of the park at foreclosure auction. Schlitterbahn continues to operate and market the park for the new owner. The property was rebranded as Waves Resort Corpus Christi. =Kansas City, Kansas= The first phase of the park in Kansas City opened in July 2009. The park opened each year in May. It is the former site of the Verr√ºckt water slide, where an accident on the slide resulted in the death of a 10-year-old boy. The park was home to more than a mile of interconnected river rides. The park was closed after the 2018 season and has not reopened. Cedar Fair declined to exercise its option to purchase the property. Proposed Projects =Fort Lauderdale, Florida= A long- stalled project in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, Schlitterbahn received final approval from the Federal Aviation Administration to construct a 64-acre water park at the old Fort Lauderdale Stadium. The initial project would have used portions of the old stadium to construct a castle-like entrance to include lodging, dining and shopping facilities. Other projects included incorporating the neighboring Lockhart Stadium into the plan by expanding the park around that stadium. A lawsuit between Fort Lauderdale and nearby Rapids Water Park delayed the project. On March 29, 2017, federal U.S. District Judge Jose Martinez ruled against the City of Fort Lauderdale in the case stating they \\"did not follow their own charter\\" in awarding the property lease to Schlitterbahn without conducting a competitive bid process and declared the lease \\"invalid, null and void.\\" Premier Parks LLC eventually won the bid for the project with plans to build a Wet'n'Wild brand water park on the site. However, in September 2018, the CEO of Premier, Kieran Burke, cancelled the deal. =Cedar Park, Texas= There were plans for a waterpark in Cedar Park, Texas, but plans for the park are currently on hold, although conversations continue. Incidents *On March 6, 2013, Nicolas ‚ÄúNico‚Äù Benavidez, a 20 year old seasonal employee at Schlitterbahn South Padre was fatally injured when an overhead gate slammed down and pinned him. He was left on life support for organ donation and later died from the injuries on March 11. OSHA investigated and fined Schlitterbahn $96,000 for six safety violations related to the fatal incident. *On August 7, 2016, a 10-year-old child, Caleb Thomas Schwab, son of Kansas representative Scott Schwab, was killed in the park while riding the Verr√ºckt, a water raft ride touted as the world's tallest water slide. Schwab died before reaching the bottom. Two other unrelated riders in the same raft sustained injuries. The ride was decommissioned and later demolished. The park settled with all parties in 2016. In March 2018, a Wyandotte County grand jury filed indictments against the park and three park employees, including the park's co-owner, Verr√ºckt's designer and a former park executive. The indictment accused the park and its employees of negligence, as well as concealing design flaws and other issues with the ride. On February 22, 2019 all charges were dropped by Judge Robert Burns against the construction company and Schlitterbahn owners. In Popular Culture The Ewing family had a day out at the Schlitterbahn Water Park in New Braunfels, Texas in an episode of Dallas titled \\"Shadow of a Doubt\\", which originally aired on November 2, 1984.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5iHz0T1qNvQ References External links * Category:Water parks in Texas Category:Companies based in New Braunfels, Texas Category:Tourist attractions in Galveston, Texas Category:Tourist attractions in Cameron County, Texas Category:1979 establishments in Texas Category:Amusement parks opened in 1979 ","title":"Schlitterbahn"},{"id":"334709","text":"NTT may refer to: *National Native Title Tribunal (NTT), Australian government instrumentality *Nippon Telegraph and Telephone (NTT), a Japanese telecommunications company *NTT Docomo, a mobile phone operator, subsidiary of NTT founded in 1991 *NTT Ltd., a global technology and services provider, subsidiary of NTT founded in 2019 *New Technology Telescope, a 3.6m telescope at La Silla Observatory, Chile *Number theoretic transform, a mathematical transform *East Nusa Tenggara, a province of Indonesia known as Nusa Tenggara Timur in Indonesian language. *New trade theory, an economic theory *Niuatoputapu Airport, IATA code *New Technology Train of the New York City Subway ","title":"NTT"},{"id":"334710","text":"This is a list of highways maintained by the government of Quebec.

It gets its generic name from two Greek words (eri and gnathos) that refer to its heavy jaw. The other part of its Linnaean name means bearded and refers to its most characteristic feature, the conspicuous and very abundant whiskers. When dry, these whiskers curl very elegantly, giving the bearded seal a \\"raffish\\" look. Bearded seals are the largest northern phocid. They have been found to weigh as much as 300 kg with the females being the largest. However, male and female bearded seals are not very dimorphic. The only member of the genus Erignathus, the bearded seal is unique in that it is an intermediate. Bearded seals belong to the family Phocidae which contains two subfamilies: Phocinae and Monachinae. The bearded seal possesses characteristics of both of these subfamilies. Fossils first described in 2002 indicated that, during the Pleistocene epoch, bearded seals ranged as far south as South Carolina. Description Distinguishing features of this earless seal include square fore flippers and thick bristles on its muzzle. Adults are greyish-brown in colour, darker on the back; rarely with a few faint spots on the back or dark spots on the sides. Occasionally the face and neck are reddish brown. Bearded seal pups are born with a greyish-brown natal fur with scattered patches of white on the back and head. The bearded seal is unique in the subfamily Phocinae in having two pairs of teats, a feature it shares with monk seals. Bearded seals reach about in nose-to-tail length and from in weight.Erignathus barbatus. The Animal Diversity Web The female seal is larger than the male, meaning that they are sexually dimorphic. Bearded seals, along with ringed seals, are a major food source for polar bears. They are also an important food source for the Inuit of the Arctic coast. The Inuit language name for the seal is ugjuk (plural: ugjuit) or oogrook or oogruk. The Inuit preferred the ringed seal for food and light; the meat would be eaten and the blubber burnt in the kudlik (stone lamp). The skin of the bearded seal is tougher than regular seal and was used to make shoes, whips, dog sled harnesses, to cover a wooden frame boat, the Umiak and in constructing summer tents known as tupiq.Ugjuk ‚Äî Bearded Seal The body fat content of a bearded seal is about 25‚Äì40%.  Distribution  Bearded seals are extant in Arctic and sub-Arctic regions. In the Pacific region, they extend from the Chukchi Sea in the Arctic, south into the Bering Sea where they span from Bristol Bay on the Alaskan coast to the Sea of Okhotsk on the Russian coast, up to but not including the northern coast of Japan. In the Arctic Ocean, they are found along the northern coasts of Russia, Norway, Canada, and Alaska, including the Norwegian Archipelago of Svalbard and Canadian Arctic Archipelago. In the Atlantic, Bearded seals are found along the northern coast of Iceland, the east and west coasts of Greenland and the Canadian mainland as far south as Labrador. Although the range typically only extends down into sub-arctic areas bearded seals have been seen in Japan and China, as well as extremely far south of their range in Germany, Netherlands, United Kingdom, France, Spain and Portugal. Hunting and diet Primarily benthic, bearded seals feed on a variety of small prey found along the ocean floor, including clams, squid, and fish. Their whiskers serve as feelersSaundry, Peter. 2010. Bearded seal . Encyclopedia of Earth. Topic editor C. Michael Hogan, Ed.in Chief: Cutler Cleveland, NCSE, Washington DC in the soft bottom sediments. Adults tend not to dive very deep, favoring shallow coastal areas no more than deep. Pups up to one year old, however, will venture much deeper, diving as deep as . In a study conducted during the summer months, the seals have been found to feed on invertebrates such as anemones, sea cucumbers, and polychaete worms. The same study found that sculpins and arctic cod made up most of their summer diet. Sculpin were also found to be the largest fish consumed by the seals. Bearded seals are capable of preying on pelagic and demersal fish in addition to their benthic prey. Reproduction and lifecycle Bearded seal pup Bearded seals give birth in the spring. In the Canadian Arctic, seal pupping occurs in May. In Svalbard, bearded seals reach sexual maturity at 5 or 6 years of age. Further south, in Alaska, most pups are born in late April. Pups are born on small drifting ice floes in shallow waters, usually weighing around . They enter the water only hours after they are born, and quickly become proficient divers. Mothers care for the pups for 18‚Äì24 days, during which time the pups grow at an average rate of per day. During this time, pups consume an average of of milk a day. By the time they are weaned, the pups have grown to about . Just before the pups are weaned, a new mating cycle takes place. Females ovulate at the end of their lactation period, but remain close to their pups, ready to defend them if necessary. During the mating season, male seals will \\"sing,\\" emitting a long-drawn-out warbling note that ends in a sort of moan or sigh. This sound may attract females, or may be used by the males to proclaim their territory or their readiness for breeding. Males occupy the same areas from one year to the next. Like many Arctic mammals, bearded seals employ a reproductive strategy known as delayed implantation. This means that the blastocyst is not implanted for two months after fertilization, most often becoming implanted in July. Thus, the seal's total gestation period is around eleven months, though its active gestation period is nine months. Natural predators of the bearded seal include polar bears, who rely on these seals as a major food source. Killer whales also prey on these seals, sometimes overturning ice floes to reach them. Walruses also eat these seals, mainly pups, but such predation is rare.Folkens, Peter (2002). National Audubon Society Guide to Marine Mammals of the World. New York, pg. 117. Bearded seals are believed to live up to 31 years.National Marine Mammal Laboratory Bearded Seals Retrieved May 1, 2016  Vocalization  The vocalizations produced by the bearded seal are very unique, possibly because their trachea is different from that of other Northern Pacific phocids. A majority of the rings in the trachea are incomplete with only a membrane attaching the two ends. Sample of underwater bearded seal vocalizations taken using a hydrophone.The sounds of the bearded seal usually consist of a long oscillating trill lasting for a minute or more followed by a short, deep moan. This \\"song\\" is often repeated frequently. The number of call types within a population can vary geographically, with four types found in Svalbard and eleven in the Western Canadian Arctic. The most frequent sounds are trills, moans, and sweeps. A sweep can be compared to a short trill. Bearded seals produce distinct trills from late March to late June, with a decline in rhythmicity in late May and June. This timeline coincides with their breeding and pupping season, which is from April to May. The repetitive and transmittable nature of bearded seal trills leads researchers to believe that they are utilized for communication, likely during courtship and breeding. Males use these sounds to establish mating territories and communicate their fitness, but it is likely that females produce these sounds as well. Underwater, bearded seal trills can be heard from a distance of over 30 km, with some types of sounds traveling farther than others. This makes it possible for one animal to communicate with another animal that is far away, although acoustic degradation does occur as the sound passes through the environment. A seal must produce a trill with a sound-pressure of at least 100 dB at 1 m in order for the sound to propagate 30 km, meaning that bearded seals can likely produce sounds at this level.Bearded seal on ice, Svalbard Conservation status On March 28, 2008, the U.S. National Marine Fisheries Service initiated a status reviewFederal Register /Vol. 73, No. 61 / March 28, 2008 / Proposed Rules. National Marine Fisheries Service under the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to determine if listing this species under the ESA is warranted. All bearded seals are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act, and determined by the IUCN to be classified as a \\"least concern\\" for extinction. This classification was determined due to various factors including, widespread distribution, stable population size, as well as alternating prey resources. NOAA determined that the factors influencing any change in conservancy status of the bearded seal may include: loss of sea ice by climate change, bycatch from commercial fishing gear, and hunting. Their main predators include polar bears, however, typically pups around age 2 are attacked within birthing lairs, leaving older juveniles and adults commonly unharmed. Due to climate change, factors such as loss of sea ice, as well as decrease in prey population may create negative results on the bearded seal population in the future. Therefore, monitoring of the species as well as influences of human activity, will be vital to ensure species stability. Subspecies There are two recognized subspecies of this seal: *Erignathus barbatus barbatus *Erignathus barbatus nautica While the validity of these subspecies has been questioned, and is not yet supported by any molecular data, analysis of the animals' calls does indicate a differentiation between different populations. thumb  Evolutionary history  Bearded seal fossils have been found to be as old as the early to mid Pleistocene. These early fossils were found in northern regions like England, Alaska, and Sweden, as well as the North Sea and the Champlain Sea. Bearded seals, like all true seals, belong to the family phocidae which is one of the three families in the clade pinnipedia along with otariidae and odobenidae. Pinnipeds are thought to have originated 27 to 25 million years ago during the late Oligocene period. One hypothesis for the evolution of pinnipeds is that pinnipeds are a diphyletic group and otariids and odobenids are more closely related to bears, and phocids are more closely related to mustelids like weasels. Another hypothesis suggests that pinnipeds are a monophyletic group that descended from a single ancestor. this has been more supported by phylogenetic analysis than the diphylectic hypothesis. One such study suggests that phocids are sister taxa to the common ancestor to both otariids and odobenids. Bearded seals belong to the subfamily phocinae. This subfamily is thought to have evolved after the subfamily monachinae Alternative phylogenies show the bearded seal being most closely related to the ribbon seal or the hooded seal however, molecular evidence suggests that hooded seals are their close relatives.

During World War II's early stages, Volvo decided that a new, smaller car that could deliver good fuel economy would assure the company's future. A raw materials shortage during the war drove home the point that an automobile should be smaller, and also complicated Volvo's ability to mass-produce the product. In 1944, when the car was finally introduced to a car-hungry public, response was very positive and orders poured in from the Swedish population. It was another three years though, until 1947, before series production began. The PV quickly earned a reputation for being strong and rugged, although the design was considered outdated from early on. The PV also competed successfully, in the American SCCA class but also internationally, with a second-hand PV544 memorably winning the Safari Rally in 1965. PV444 The PV444 was Volvo's first uni- body car. Its body structure was influenced by the 1939 Hanomag 1,3 litre, which was purchased and studied by Volvo engineers. It was also the first Volvo in almost 20 years to come with a 4-cylinder engine (earlier models had used side-valve straight sixes). The first PV444s were powered by a 40 PS 1.4 L inline-four engine designated the B4B, with three main bearings, overhead valves, and a single downdraft carburettor. The power of this engine increased to in October 1950, and to in October 1955. US models, beginning to appear in the US in early 1956, received an up-rated version called the B14A which was given twin side-draft 1¬Ω in S.U. carburetors for a total of 70 hp. Most early US sales were limited to Texas and southern California. American customers also had the option of European delivery, in which case they could also get a cheaper model with the basic B4B engine. By the 1957 model year, engine displacement was increased to 1.6 L and both single downdraft- B16A and twin side-draught carburetted B16B versions were offered. File:1954 Volvo PV444 HS rear side.jpg1954 PV 444 HS, showing the new full-sized rear windscreen PV544 In 1958, the PV544 was phased in. Subtle differences with the PV444 included the introduction of a curved one-piece windshield to replace the two panes of flat glass, larger taillights, and a ribbon-type speedometer. The 444's 3-speed manual transmission was also supplanted by a 4-speed unit in the 544. The interior was modified to accommodate 5 persons instead of 4 by increasing the width of the back seat and using thinner backrests of the front seats. This way the car could become a little roomier on the inside while keeping the same body. The next significant change occurred in 1962, when the B16 was replaced by Volvo's new B18 engine, initially developed for the P1800 sports car introduced the previous year. This 1.8 L engine had five main bearings. Again single and twin carburettor versions were offered, designated B18A and B18D, respectively. The U.S. market saw very few B18A cars since the United States' public prioritised performance over fuel economy. Also in 1962, Volvo changed from 6- to 12-volt electrical systems. In 1963 Volvo began producing the 544 at their new Canadian Dartmouth/Halifax plant, the first Volvo plant to be located outside of Sweden. The PV544 was also made as an estate (wagon) version, the Duett, initially designated the P445 and later the P210. The 544 received incremental mechanical revisions and trim changes until its final production year of 1965. Exactly 440,000 units were built during the 18-year run. The car had so endeared itself to its owners that Volvo ran self- deprecating advertisements in late 1965 and early 1966 imploring PV owners not to be angry with the company. The Duett's utility allowed Volvo to continue the wagon's production through the 1969 model year. These were then replaced in some markets by a high-roof version of the Volvo 145, called the Express.

Thomas said that he was one of 29 children and belonged to a set of triplets, which seems an impossibility and for which there is no other evidence. A modern Dempster, James, reasons, on a website established by him at , that 9 is a plausible figure. As it has been established by other documentation that Thomas was the third son, fourth child, and that his parents were married in 1568, allowing an interval of 18 months James arrives at 1574 or 1575, which makes Thomas considerably less precocious.

Born into the aristocracy in Aberdeenshire, which comprises regions of both the Scottish highlands and the Scottish lowlands, he was sent abroad as a youth for his education. The Dempsters were Catholic in an increasingly Protestant country and had a reputation for being quarrelsome. Thomas' brother James, outlawed for an attack on his father, spent some years as a pirate in the northern islands, escaped by volunteering for military service in the Low Countries and was drawn and quartered there for insubordination. Thomas' father lost the family fortune in clan feuding and was beheaded for forgery. For these and political and religious reasons in these often violent Elizabethan times Thomas was unable to come home except for visits. Of uncommon and impressive height and intellectual ability he became an itinerant professor in France and Italy, driven from place to place by a series of colourful personal incidents in which he fought duels or opposed officers of the law. He eventually found refuge and patronage under Grand Duke Cosimo II of Tuscany, who commissioned a work on the Etruscans. Three years later Thomas handed the duke a magnum opus, the manuscript of De Etruria Regali Libri Septem, \\"Seven Books about Royal Etruria\\",\\"Royal Hetruria\\" was Dempster's own English name for the book, used in a letter recounting its loss to him. Rowland, pages 98‚Äì99. Dempster's Hetruria has been mainly altered to Etruria in this article, following Coke's convention. in the Latin language, the first detailed study of every aspect of Etruscan civilisation, considered a brilliant work. In 1723 Thomas Coke finally undertook to publish an enhanced edition of it. The original manuscript remains in Coke's library at Holkham. Biography =Early life= Clan Dempster Thomas DempsterDempster alternates with Dempstar in the land charters abbreviated by Robertson. was born at Cliftbog, Aberdeenshire (near Turriff),A minority view places his birth at Brechin. to the sister of the Baron of Balquhain,The 10th. Her father was Willam Lesley, 9th Baron of Balquhain. according to him in his autobiography, and Thomas Dempster Laird of Muiresk,Often spelled Muresk. Auchterless and Killesmont, sheriff (until 1586) of Banff and Buchan. A Laird had the rank of Baron. As the Baron of Balquhain was a member of Clan Leslie, a lowland clan (as was Clan Dempster), Thomas' mother is identified with Jean Leslie. A land charter from the king of Scotland in 1592Robertson pages 570‚Äì571. defines or redefines the lands to be owned by Thomas and his wife Jeanne Leslie (Jean elsewhere in the charters) and inherited by his heirs Robert (2nd son), Thomas (3rd son), and George, who are called \\"legitimate offspring\\", and also John, Archibald and Charles Dempster. Girls could not inherit, so they are not listed. The oldest son, James, is missing from the record. By birth Jeanne was connected to Clan Forbes.Her mother, Janet, daughter of 6th Lord Forbes. The marriage seems to have taken place a few years before Clan Leslie joined with Clan Gordon in their feud against Clan Forbes. The Leslie's were supporters of Mary, Queen of Scots, Catholic pretender to the throne of England, who was imprisoned (and eventually executed) by Queen Elizabeth I and her son, the future James I of England, taken away to be raised protestant. These events may or may not have something to do with the later accusations that Thomas was an intelligencer for James I. A permanent tutor was hired for Thomas: Andrew Ogston. Thomas reported that under Andrew he learned the alphabet in a single hour at age three. He may have been older; in any case, Andrew recognised talent in his pupil. He sent him to Grammar SchoolThere were no public schools as Americans know them in the British Isles at that time. The public in general had no right to an education and did not receive one. The school in Aberdeen was for a paying clientele. briefly in Aberdeen, and in 1588, the year the Spanish Armada was defeated, at the age of ten (or 14) Thomas left home to enter Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, an Anglican institution. The fall of the clan Meanwhile, Thomas senior had taken a mistress, Isabella, from Clan Gordon, which must have been a bitter blow to his wife. Apparently Isabella charmed not only Thomas but James, who married her. Thomas reaction was swift: he disinherited his oldest son. James and a band of Gordons waylaid Thomas and party on the road between estates. Thomas was shot several times in the legs and suffered a sword blow to the head, as a result of which James became an outlaw, surviving by banditry in Shetland and Orkney. The younger Thomas' uncle, John Dempster, an Edinburgh lawyer, insisted he be educated abroad to remove him from the environment.Mor√©r. The elder Dempster continued to make decisions that were the ruin of the family. Clan feuding was an expensive activity from which every clan suffered. The elder Thomas had already lost much of his estate to pay for feuds with Clan Currer and Clan Grant. He decided now to sell the estate at Muiresk to the Earl of Erroll to prevent his eldest son from ever inheriting it. The earl took advantage of some fine print in the law, now obscure, to evade payment.Dictionary of National Biography. =Education abroad= Scots College of Paris Thomas and tutor started out for Paris. He was ten in the most precocious dating scheme, possibly as old as 14 in others. They had no sooner reached the continent when they were robbed of all their possessions and probably beaten as well, as Ogston died not long after. Their assailants remain unknown except that they were French soldiers. However, a good Samaritan stepped forward: Walter Brus, an officer in the French army, who was of Scottish descent, and judging from the name, perhaps not of the humblest birth. Walter sent him on to Paris, where other officers of Scottish descent in the French army took up a subscription to place him at the University of Paris.Stephen page 336. According to the structure of the university at the time, Thomas would have entered the Scots College there; the fact that the subscription was of Scottish officers indicates that that is the most likely possibility. If true, it shows that Brus' motivations were not entirely altruistic. The Scots Colleges abroad were being used as training and staging areas for Scottish priests intended to enter Scotland in the wake of the invading army and play the most significant role in its reconversion. The failure of the invasion left them in place (without much work to do other than intelligence and conspiracy). Diversions to Belgium and Rome At the University of Paris Thomas became deathly ill with \\"the plague\\"This is the Dictionary of National Biography term. Thomas' own term (page 674) is lues horrenda. and on recovering was sent by someone in charge of his destiny to the University of Louvain in the Southern Netherlands (now Belgium), to study under Justus Lipsius. Thomas himself gives that as a reason,Page 675. but otherwise does not have a clear explanation for the change, stating only that Belgium was a \\"safe refuge\\".Tutum portum (accusative case), page 674. Instead he was diverted from this plan by William Crichton, Jesuit,1535‚Äì1617, recruited into the Jesuits by William Hay on the latter's mission to Mary, Queen of Scots, 1592, subsequent member of an unsuccessful mission to convert James VI and I, even though he had been released from the Tower of London on condition that he not return to England. then Superior of the Scots College, Douai, which is a good indication that forces unknown to young Thomas were at work in his life. He did not matriculate at Louvain. The University of Douai was founded by Philip II of Spain as part of his military build-up against England and was at first identical to the English College there. This college was a refuge and rallying point for English Catholics fleeing the re-establishment of Protestantism after the death of Mary I and the accession of Elizabeth I. Mary had won for herself the popular title \\"Bloody Mary\\" for her methods in attempting to reimpose Catholicism on England. Philip II, who had been married to Mary 1554‚Äì1558, used the seminarians from Douai openly as agents. They were often in England illegally to establish contacts and maintain a bridgehead, so to speak, for reconversion. The mastermind in the strategy to reconquer Great Britain for Catholicism and Spain was that of Philip II. He was supported in this effort by a long series of short-term popes (some very short-term), such as Innocent IX (1591), Gregory XIV (1590‚Äì1591), etc., who basically followed his strategy. Clement VIII (1592‚Äì1605), Cardinal Aldobrandini since 1585, changed the policy and stood against Philip, after his military defeat by the English. In the latter part of the 16th century, deeming that the reconversion structure needed strengthening, the popes established a number of Scots Colleges, typically through the Jesuits. One of these was the Scots College at Douai, founded by its first Superior, Father William Crighton (P. Gulielmus Creighton), who held the office 1581‚Äì1597, according to the records of the college.Records of the Scots Colleges, page 96. Apparently Crighton had been asked by \\"the pope\\": perhaps Pope Sixtus V (1585‚Äì1590) to provide Scottish students for seminary study at Rome. The Scots College at Rome did not receive its foundation bull from Clement VIII until 1600, but the request specifically for Scotsmen evidences an early interest in that direction. How Crighton got Dempster's name remains as unknown as why he was deported from Paris, but Thomas was one of four selected and did not enroll at Louvain, but journeyed straight to Rome. He mentions that Cardinal Aldobrandini was raising an army there and calls him also Clement VIII, perhaps in anticipation of later events. Dempster says that he was in a seminarium Romanum with \\"the choicest nobility of Italy\\", which he would not have been if the Scots College had existed then. Scots College of Douai The Roman plan came to nothing when, as Dempster says, \\"the lethal disease recurred.\\" Acting on medical advice the church authorities returned him to Belgium for a change of climate. After an arduous and dangerous journey north of the Alps he connected at Tournai with James Cheyne, a member of his network of Scottish patrons. Securing funding from \\"the king of Spain\\", who must have been Philip II, and \\"Archduke Albert\\",Dempster page 675. Cheyne sent him to the Scottish College, Douai, from which, after a few years, he graduated. The name of Thomas Demster appears as Item Number 64 in the Register of Alumni for the college, applying to the year 1593, with a very brief entry next to his name, \\"etiam seminarii alumnus.\\" Apparently the college accepted both seminarians and seculars, and this notification identified Thomas as a seminarian. If the 1579 birthdate is true, Thomas would have been 14. Of his stay there he had little to say, only that he took first prize in poetry and second in philosophy. He showed such ability that, when still in his teens, he became lecturer on the Humanities at the University of Douai. After a short stay, he returned to Paris, to take his degree of doctor of Canon law. =Itinerant professor= Preface to the Lectura Institutionum, manuscript, 16th century. Paris, Biblioth√®que Nationale de France. Dempster's first position as a doctor was a regent, or full professor, of the Coll√®ge de Navarre, at age 17. He soon left Paris for Toulouse, which in turn he was forced to leave by the hostility of the city authorities, aroused by his violent assertion of university rights. He was than elected professor of eloquence at the academy of N√Æmes. A murderous attack upon him by one of the defeated candidates and his supporters was followed by a libel case, which, though he ultimately won, forced him to leave the town. A short stay in Spain, as tutor to the son of Marshal de Saint Luc, was terminated by another quarrel; and Dempster returned to Scotland in 1608 with the intention of claiming his father's estates. Finding his relatives unsympathetic, and falling into heated controversy with the Presbyterian clergy, he returned to Paris in 1609, where he remained for seven years, becoming professor in several colleges. In the end, his temporary connection with the Coll√®ge de Beauvais was ended by a fight, in which he defeated officers of the king's guard, forcing him once again to change his place of residence. The story is told in Latin by Gian Vittorio Rossi, a contemporary. He begins with a characterisation of Dempster that has been much repeated:In Pinotheca, \\"Picture Gallery\\", written by Rossi under the pen-name in Latin of Janus Nicius Erythraeus, in Italian Giano Nicio Eritreo. The Latin is given in The Classical Journal of March and June 1821, Volume XXIII, Sketch of the Character of Thomas Dempster by M., pages 119 following. Downloadable Google Books. \\"But, I don't know by what pact, those most mild-mannered sisters (the Muses) ... have embraced Thomas Dempster, a Scot, a man made for war and contention ... he allowed almost no day to go by empty of strife ... but that he should fight another by sword, or, if he had no sword, with fists ....\\" In the story, Dempster whips a student on the bare back for dueling, but the student, unable to bear the insult, brings in three relatives who happen to belong to the custodes corporis Regis, the king's own bodyguard. In response Dempster arms the other students, surrounds the guardsmen and puts them in chains in the bell tower. In the resulting inquiry, \\"such a storm arose\\" that Thomas departed for England. The story says distinctly that England was a \\"safe refuge\\", meaning between the lines that Catholic prosecutors could not extradite him or threaten him with agents. The story goes on to say that in England he met a woman (Susanna Valeria) \\"so abundant, so favored by Venus that nothing else would do but that he have her to wife.\\" At this point the story skips over a small matter, intentionally or not, that might well explain Thomas' future apparent inability to settle in one place, even as a renowned and successful scholar. The dedication of his edition of Rosinus' Antiquitatum romanarum corpus absolutissimum to King James I, a Protestant (the king of the King James Bible), even though he, Dempster, was a Catholic, had won him an invitation to the English court; and in 1615 he went to London. There James I appointed him historiographer royal. =\\"Escape\\" to Italy= He was not there long. Even though England was totally safe for him, and he had already been preferred by a king who admired him, and had married an English girl, complaining that he was not accepted by the Protestants and could not find advancement because of them he set sail for Rome with his wife. Pope Paul V immediately drew what may have been the correct conclusion and threw him into prison as a spy. However, the good pope changed his mind shortly, perhaps still hoping to reconvert the son of Mary, Queen of Scots, and decided accept the matter graciously, placing Thomas in Italy. He used his influence with Cosimo II de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, to get Thomas appointed to the professorship of the Pandects at Pisa. The Grand Duke commissioned him also to write a definitive work on the Etruscans. In 1619 his daughter died shortly after birth, the only child he was to have. In 1620 after the execution of his father he began to call himself the Baron of Muiresk, which in Scotland was considered an illegitimate claim. His brother James, though disinherited from the estate, still had a claim to the title, which was considered to end with his death, as he had no heir. In any case Thomas was not the second son but the third. The second (Robert) had no heirs, either, which did not strengthen the case of the Dempsters. They were forced to accept the end of their clan; that is, there were no further charters to Dempsters from the king, nor was anyone entitled to be called Baron Dempster or use the coat of arms. Modern Dempsters, of course, may do as they please in accordance with the laws of the countries in which they reside. At Pisa Thomas worked very hard on his commission, sometimes 14 hours per day. The strain was too much for his wife, perhaps depressed also by her loss. She ran off with an Englishman, but later returned. The issue of adultery came up again. Violent accusations followed, indignantly repudiated; a diplomatic correspondence ensued, and a demand was made, and supported by the grand duke, for an apology, which the professor refused to make, preferring to lose his chair. He set out once more for Scotland, but was intercepted by the Florentine cardinal Luigi Capponi, who persuaded him to remain at Bologna as professor of Humanity. This was the most distinguished post in the most famous of continental universities, and Dempster was at the height of his fame. Though his Roman Antiquities and Scotia ilustrior had been placed on the Index pending correction, Pope Urban VIII made him a knight and gave him a pension. It was in Bologna that Thomas made friends with Matteo Pellegrini, who was to complete his autobiography posthumously and described \\"Dempsterus\\" as a man \\"outstanding in body and mind: his height was above the average height of the common man: his hair was nearly black and the colour of his skin not far from that: his head was huge and the carriage of his body completely regal; his strength and ferocity were as outstanding as that of a soldier ....\\"Burton, pages 260‚Äì261. =End= Thomas was not to enjoy his honours long. His wife ran off again, this time with a student. He pursued them as far as Vicenza. Becoming ill with a fever he returned to Bologna, where he died on 6 September at age 46 (or 50). He is buried there. Publications Keraunos kai obelos in glossas librorum quatuor Institutionum, 1622 Dempster was equally at home in philology, criticism, law, biography, and history. He was a master of the Latin language and wrote in Latin, as was still the academic custom of the times. His works are: *An edition of Rosinus' Antiquitatum Romanarum corpus absolutissimum \\"The Most Complete Body of Roman Antiquities\\" (Paris, 1613). Dedicated to James I. This is the work that came to the attention of the king. *Panegyricus Jacobo M. (Magnae) Britanniae Regi, \\"Panegyric to James, King of Great Britain (London, 1616)\\" *Poetic contributions In Obitum Aldinae Catellae: lachrymae poeticae, \\"On the Death of the Puppy Aldina: Poetic tears\\" (Paris, 1622). * *An edition of Benedetto Accolti's De bello a Christianis contra barbaros, \\"Of the Christian War against the Barbarians\\" (1623). *Historia ecclesiastica gentis Scotorum, \\"Ecclesiastical History of the Scottish Nation\\" (Bologna, 1627). Mor√©r asserts that this \\"is one of the most discredited works ever written in the field of Scottish history.\\"Below. The 1911 Encyclop√¶dia Britannica says: \\"In this he tries to prove that Bernard (Sapiens), Alcuin, Saint Boniface and Johannes Scotus Eriugena were all Scots, and even Boadicea becomes a Scottish author.\\" The last chapter was intended as his autobiography, which Matteo Pellegrini, a friend at Bologna, completed posthumously. Much of what it says about him; for example, that his mother had 29 children and that he himself was one of triplets, is counted as prevarication. The low quality of this work after so much brilliance remains unexplained. *Some of his Latin verse is printed in the first volume (pp. 306‚Äì354) of Delitiae poetarum Scotorum (Amsterdam, 1637). The rescue of De Etruria Regali Dempster's major work was rescued from oblivion by Thomas Coke (1697‚Äì1759) later Earl of Leicester. Aged 15, he started on the Grand Tour, and in Etruria befriended the Grand Duke Cosimo III. Through him he discovered the existence of Dempster's manuscript, which he purchased from its then owner, Antonio Maria Salvini.The abbot, 1653‚Äì1729, Greek scholar and Italian dictionarist. It isn't clear how Dempster's manuscript descended from ownership by Cosimo II to Salvini's extensive and famous collection. This he published apparently at his own expense; however, the publication was not exactly of the original. Filippo Buonarroti of Florence emended the text and added a critical apparatus. The duke had his own engravers enhance Dempster's illustrations with new ones drawn from artefacts in various collections. In all the work came to contain about 100 copperplate engravings.In the process he had Biscioni copy the manuscript, which took about a year. He had intended to keep only the copy, but Biscioni sent him both, which remained at Holkhom.

A Latin dedication to Cosimo III, dated 1725, London, was added in 1726 by Coke. A folio supplement was published by Passeri, 1767. The publication of the book sparked the first public wave of interest in the Etruscans throughout academic Italy. Notes Bibliography * Available Google Books. * Viewable Google Books.

Allegationes et consilia, 14th-15th-century manuscript. Naples, Biblioteca Nazionale Vittorio Emanuele III, Fondo Nazionale, ms. I.D.64. - ff. 327. He was born at Arezzo in Tuscany, of a prominent family, several members of which were distinguished like himself for their attainments in law. He was for some time professor of law in the University of Florence, and after the dismissal in 1456 from the Florentine chancellorship of the renowned humanist Poggio Bracciolini for incompetence and an interregnum of two years, Accolti himself became Chancellor of the Florentine Republic in 1458. Accolti's memory was prodigious. Having, one day, heard a speech delivered by an ambassador from the king of Hungary to the Florentine government, he afterwards repeated it, word for word. Accolti wrote in Latin a history of the First Crusade, entitled De Bello a Christianis contra Barbaros gesto pro Christi Sepulchro et Judaea recuperandis libri IV (1464), or \\"On the War carried on by the Christians against the Barbarians, for the Recovery of Christ's Sepulchre, and of Judea\\", which is said to have furnished Torquato Tasso with the historical basis for his Jerusalem Delivered. Another work of Accolti's, a \\"Dialogue\\" (1461‚Äì63), was published at Parma in 1689; in this work the author compares the achievements of the moderns to the ancients, in order to prove that the former are in no respect inferior to the latter. Both works were dedicated to members of the Medici family, the \\"Dialogue\\" to Cosimo \\"il vecchio\\", the history to his son Piero. Accolti's younger brother Francesco was also a distinguished jurist. His son Pietro became a cardinal, while another son Bernardo was a notable vernacular poet. Benedetto Accolti the Younger, the chancellor's grandson, also became a cardinal.

It derives from four key propositions: that Hell exists; that it is for the punishment of people whose lives on Earth are judged to have sinned against God; that some people go there; and there is no escape. Issues There are several major issues to the problem of Hell. The first is its definition, as there are several words in the original languages of the Bible that are translated into the word \\"hell\\" in English. A second issue is whether the existence of Hell is compatible with justice. A third is whether Hell is compatible with God's mercy, especially as articulated in Christianity. An issue particular to Christianity is whether Hell is actually populated forever or they perish, or if God will ultimately restore all immortal souls (universal reconciliation) in the World to Come. In some aspects, the problem of Hell is similar to the problem of evil, assuming the suffering of Hell is caused by free will and something God could have prevented. The discussion regarding the problem of evil may thus also be of interest for the problem of Hell. The problem of Hell can be viewed as the worst and most intractable instance of the problem of evil. =Criticisms of the doctrines of Hell= Criticisms of the doctrines of Hell can focus on the intensity or eternity of its torments, and arguments surrounding all these issues can invoke appeals to the omnipotence, omniscience, and omnibenevolence of God. If one believes in the idea of eternal Hell, unending suffering, or the idea that some souls will perish (whether destroyed by God or otherwise), author Thomas Talbott says that one has to either let go of the idea that God wishes to save all beings, or accept the idea that God wants to save all, but will not \\"successfully accomplish his will and satisfy his own desire in this matter.\\"Talbott, Thomas, \\"Heaven and Hell in Christian Thought\\", The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2017 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.), forthcoming . \\"Theists who accept the traditional idea of everlasting punishment, or even the idea of an everlasting separation from God, must either reject the idea that God wills or desires to save all humans and thus desires to reconcile them all to himself (see proposition (1) in section 1 above) or reject the idea that God will successfully accomplish his will and satisfy his own desire in this matter \\" Judaism Judaism teaches that the soul exists both before its stay in the body, and after. It believes that the soul is immortal, and that it is subject to both reward and punishment after death. However, punishment is held to be temporary, normally only lasting up to 12 months after death. After this period, the soul is able to bask in the light of God. Because the punishment is temporary, the \\"Problem of Hell\\" in the Christian sense is inapplicable in Judaism. Jewish religious thinking has traditionally held, even among different schools ranging from Jewish Orthodox teachings to Reform Jewish thinking to Conservative Jewish thinking and more, that \\"The righteous of all peoples have a place in the World-To-Come\\", in the words of the Talmud, with humanity as a whole being \\"saved\\". Thus, rabbinical scholars have broadly held the inclusive view that the vast majority of people in existence, both Jewish and gentile, will be reconciled with God in the afterlife given the power of his grace and the fundamental goodness of humanity. Christianity In Christianity, Hell has traditionally been regarded as a place of punishment for wrongdoing or sin in the mortal life, as a manifestation of divine justice. Nonetheless, the extreme severity and/or infinite duration of the punishment might be seen as incompatible with justice. However, Hell is not seen as strictly a matter of retributive justice even by the more traditionalist churches. For example, the Eastern Orthodox see it as a condition brought about by, and the natural consequence of, free rejection of God's love. The Roman Catholic Church teaches that Hell is a place of punishmentCatechism of the Catholic Church, 1035, Libreria Editrice Vaticana, , 1994 ‚Äì the revised version issued 1997 has no changes in this section brought about by a person's self-exclusion from communion with God.Catechism of the Catholic Church, 1033, Libreria Editrice Vaticana, , 1994 The Catholic Church believes that hell is the free and continual rejection of God's forgiveness of sins.Catechism of the Catholic Church 1037 The church believes that this rejection is by committing and refusing to repent of a mortal sin.Catechism of the Catholic Church 1861 The church believes that those who die only in original sin are not predestined to hell,Catechism of the Catholic Church 1037 since God is not bound by baptism.Catechism of the Catholic Church 1257 The church believes that hell is eternal because the sinner refuses to turn away from his mortal sin to God's forgiveness of sins.Catechism of the Catholic Church 1033 The church believes that hell is its own chief punishment.Catechism of the Catholic Church 1057 In some ancient Eastern Christian traditions, Hell and Heaven are distinguished not spatially, but by the relation of a person to God's love. In terms of the Bible itself, issues of salvation and access to heaven or to hell are mentioned frequently. Examples include John 3:16 \\"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\\" which tends to show the wicked perish and the saints have everlasting life or (NIV), \\"Whoever believes in the Son has eternal life, but whoever rejects the Son will not see life, for God's wrath remains on them\\", and (NIV), \\"Those who do not know God and do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus, they will be punished with everlasting destruction and shut out from the presence of the Lord and from the glory of his might.\\" The minority Christian doctrine that sinners perish and are destroyed rather than punished eternally such as is found in John 3:16 \\"That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life.\\", is referred to as Christian mortalism; annihilation for those not awarded immortal life, conditional immortality for those who are. This Christian view is found in very early Christianity, resurfaced in the Reformation, and since 1800 has found increasing support among Protestant theologians.Richard Bauckham \\"Universalism: a historical survey\\" (@ theologicalstudies.org.uk), Themelios 4.2 (September 1978): 47‚Äì54. \\"Here and there, outside the theological mainstream, were some who believed that the wicked would be finally annihilated (in its commonest form. this is the doctrine of 'conditional immortality').\\" \\"Since 1800 this situation has entirely changed, and no traditional Christian doctrine has been so widely abandoned as that of eternal punishment.3 Its advocates among theologians today must be fewer than ever before. The alternative interpretation of hell as annihilation seems to have prevailed even among many of the more conservative theologians.\\" =Justice= Some opponents of the traditional doctrine of Hell claim that the punishment is disproportionate to any crimes that could be committed. Because human beings have a finite lifespan, they can commit only a finite number of sins, yet Hell is an infinite punishment. In this vein, Jorge Luis Borges suggests in his essay La duraci√≥n del Infierno that no transgression can warrant an infinite punishment on the grounds that there is no such thing as an \\"infinite transgression\\". Philosopher Immanuel Kant argued in 1793 in Religion within the Bounds of Bare Reason that since morality lies ultimately in a person's disposition, and as disposition is concerned with the adoption of universal principles, or as he called them: \\"maxims\\", every human being is guilty of, in one sense, an infinite amount of violations of the law, and so consequently an infinite punishment is not unjustified. =Divine mercy= Another issue is the problem of harmonizing the existence of Hell with God's infinite mercy or omnibenevolence which is found in scripture. Some modern critics of the doctrine of Hell (such as Marilyn McCord Adams) claim that, even if Hell is seen as a choice rather than as punishment, it would be unreasonable for God to give such flawed and ignorant creatures as ourselves the responsibility of our eternal destinies.Richard Beck. \\"Christ and Horrors, Part 3: Horror Defeat, Universalism, and God's Reputation\\". Experimental Theology. March 19, 2007. Jonathan Kvanvig, in The Problem of Hell (1993), agrees that God would not allow one to be eternally damned by a decision made under the wrong circumstances.Jonathan Kvanvig, The Problem of Hell, New York: Oxford University Press, , 1993 One should not always honor the choices of human beings, even when they are full adults, if, for instance, the choice is made while depressed or careless. On Kvanvig's view, God will abandon no person until they have made a settled, final decision, under favorable circumstances, to reject God, but God will respect a choice made under the right circumstances. Once a person finally and competently chooses to reject God, out of respect for the person's autonomy, God allows them to be annihilated. Islam In Islam, Jahannam is the final destiny of evildoers and is regarded as necessary for God's divine justice. God's punishments are by definition considered to be justified, since God holds absolute sovereignty. Furthermore, with regard to predestination, one of six articles of faith in Islam, the question of how creatures be punished for their deeds arises. =The inhabitants of Hell= The inhabitants of afterlife places are not dogmatically determined in Islam, thus it is up to individual and critical interpretation of the Qur'an as to who enters Hell. A common concern is the fate of non-Muslims and if they will be punished for not belonging to the right religion. An often-recited quranic verse implies that righteous non- Muslims will be saved on Judgement Day: > Indeed, those who believed and those who were Jews or Christians or > Sabeans‚Äîthose who believed in Allah and the Last Day and did > righteousness‚Äîwill have their reward with their Lord, and no fear will there > be concerning them, nor will they grieve. However some scholars hold this verse may be set aside as only applying before the arrival of Muhammad.David Marshall Communicating the Word: Revelation, Translation, and Interpretation in Christianity and Islam Georgetown University Press 2011 p. 8 Some non-pluralist scholars like Ibn Arabi state that every human will receive a proper message and will not be doomed for ignorance, while others claim non-Muslims are judged by their own moral standards, because of God's all-embracing mercy.Adis Duderija The Imperatives of Progressive Islam Adis Duderija p. 58 Another criterion to determine the justice of Hell's punishment derives from its duration, on which Islamic scholars disagree. Some scholars state that Hell is eternal, others hold that Hell exists to purify rather than inflict pain,Christian Lange Paradise and Hell in Islamic Traditions Cambridge University Press 2015 p. 170 and others state that Hell itself will cease to exist. With the increasing urgency of pluralism, modern writers such as Edip Y√ºksel and Mouhanad Khorchide hold Hell to be finite rather than eternal: Y√ºksel argues that evildoers will be punished in Hell for an appropriate period then cease to exist, so that their suffering (which is described in the Quran and is balanced with descriptions of heaven) will be only a just amount.Eternal Hell and a Merciful God Edip Y√ºksel, 2003 Other universalist-leaning scholars include Tariq Ramadan, Sayyid Qutb and possibly Ibn Qayyim who some argue, like his teacher Ibn Taymiyya, was not a universalist. =Concerning predestination= The degree of free will differs in Islamic thought. Based on Sunni traditions, God wrote everything that will happen on a tablet before creating the world, therefore human free will is not beyond God's influence. This results in the problem: how punishment is justified since God made humans the way they will sin. In this tradition, in Ashari thought, God created good and evil deeds, which humans decide upon--humans have their own possibility to choose, but God retains sovereignty of all possibilities. This still leaves the question of why God set out those people's lives (or the negative choice of deeds) which result in Hell, and why God created the possibility to become evil. In Islamic thought, evil is considered to be movement away from good, and God created this possibility so that humans are able to recognize good.Reinhold Loeffler Islam in Practice: Religious Beliefs in a Persian Village SUNY Press p. 110 (In contrast, angels are unable to move away from good, therefore angels generally rank lower than humans as they have reached heaven because they lack the ability to perceive the world as humans do.)Mohamed Haj Yousef The Single Monad Model of the Cosmos: Ibn Arabi's Concept of Time and Creation ibnalarabi 2014 p. 292 Proposed answers =Annihilationism= As with other Jewish writings of the Second Temple period, the New Testament text distinguishes two words, both translated \\"Hell\\" in older English Bibles: Hades, \\"the grave\\", and Gehenna where God \\"can destroy both body and soul\\". A minority of Christians read this to mean that neither Hades nor Gehenna are eternal but refer to the ultimate destruction of the wicked in the Lake of Fire in a consuming fire, but which because of the Greek words used in translating from the Hebrew text has become confused with Greek myths and ideas. From the sixth century BC onward, the Greeks developed pagan ideas for the dead, and of reincarnation and even transmigration of souls. Christians picked up these pagan beliefs inferred by the Greek of immortality of the soul, or spirit being of a mortal individual, which survives the death of the body of this world and this lifetime, which is at odds and in contrast to the scriptural teaching that the dead go to the grave and know nothing and then at the end, an eternal oblivion of the wicked and an eternal life for the saints. Scripture makes clear that the dead are awaiting resurrection at the last judgment, when Christ comes and also when each person will receive his reward or are part of those lost with the wicked. The Greek words used for those Bibles written in Greek, came loaded with ideas not in line with the original Hebrew, but since at the time, Greek was used as basically English is used today to communicate between people across the world, it was translated into these Greek words, and giving an incorrect understanding of the penalty of sin. In the Hebrew text when people died they went to Sheol, the grave and the wicked ultimately went to Gehenna which is the consuming by fire. So when the grave or the eternal oblivion of the wicked was translated into Greek, the word Hades was sometimes used, which is a Greek term for the realm of the dead. Nevertheless, the meaning depending on context was the grave, death, or the end of the wicked in which they are ultimately destroyed or perish. So we see where the grave or death or eventual destruction of the wicked, was translated using Greek words that since they had no exact ones to use, became a mix of mistranslation, pagan influence, and Greek myth associated with the word, but its original meaning was simple death or the destruction of the wicked at the end. Christian mortalism is the doctrine that all men and women, including Christians, must die, and do not continue and are not conscious after death. Therefore, annihilationism includes the doctrine that \\"the wicked\\" are also destroyed rather than tormented forever in traditional \\"Hell\\" or the lake of fire. Christian mortalism and annihilationism are directly related to the doctrine of conditional immortality, the idea that a human soul is not immortal unless it is given eternal life at the Second Coming of Christ and the resurrection of the dead. Such a belief is based on the many texts which state that the wicked perish: :\\"For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life.\\" (KJV). :\\"For the day of the Lord is near upon all the heathen: as thou hast done, it shall be done unto thee: thy reward shall return upon thine own head. For as ye have drunk upon my holy mountain, so shall all the heathen drink continually, yea, they shall drink, and they shall swallow down, and they shall be as though they had not been.\\" (KJV). Annihilationism asserts that God will eventually destroy or annihilate the wicked when they are consumed in the Lake of Fire at the end, leaving only the righteous to live on in immortality. Conditional immortality asserts that souls are naturally mortal, and those who reject Christ are separated from the sustaining power of God, thus dying off on their own. This is seen in the texts making clear the alternatives at the end are to perish or to have eternal, everlasting life: :\\"For the wages of sin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life in Christ Jesus our Lord.\\" (KJV) And that the consequence for sin at the day of judgment when God will judge both the living and the dead when He appears is death, not burning forever. God's gift is eternal life, very different from the penalty of sin: :\\"The Lord knoweth how to deliver the godly out of temptations, and to reserve the unjust unto the day of judgment to be punished.\\" . (KJV). :\\"As therefore the tares are gathered and burned in the fire; so shall it be in the end of this world.\\" (KJV). :\\"So shall it be at the end of the world: the angels shall come forth, and sever the wicked from among the just, And shall cast them into the furnace of fire: there shall be wailing and gnashing of teeth.\\" (KJV). The mortality of the soul has been held throughout the history of both Judaism and Christianity, with many biblical scholars looking at the issue through the Hebrew text, have denied the teaching of innate immortality. Rejection of the immortality of the soul, and advocacy of Christian mortalism, was a feature of Protestantism since the early days of the Reformation with Martin Luther himself rejecting the traditional idea, though his view did not carry into orthodox Lutheranism. One of the most notable English opponents of the immortality of the soul was Thomas Hobbes who describes the idea as a Greek \\"contagion\\" in Christian doctrine.Stephen A. State Thomas Hobbes and the Debate Over Natural Law and Religion 2013 \\"The natural immortality of the soul is in fact a pagan presumption: \\"For men being generally possessed before the time of our Saviour, by contagion of the Daemonology of the Greeks, of an opinion, that the Souls of men were substances distinct from their Bodies, and therefore that when the Body was dead\\" Modern proponents of conditional immortality include as denominations the Seventh-day Adventists, Bible Students, Jehovah's Witnesses, Christadelphians, and some other Protestant Christians. =Free will= Some apologists argue that Hell exists because of free will, and that Hell is a choice rather than an imposed punishment. Jonathan L. Kvanvig writes: Similarly, Dave Hunt (1996) writes: An example from popular culture can be found in the graphic novel series The Sandman. In it, souls go to Hell because they believe that they deserve to, rather than being condemned to it by God or Satan.Gaiman, Neil Season of Mists DC Comics/Vertigo, 1990 p. 18 =Universal reconciliation= Universal reconciliation is the doctrine or belief of some Christians that all will receive salvation because of the love and mercy of God. Universal reconciliation does not commit one to the position that one can be saved apart from Christ. It only commits one to the position that all will eventually be saved through Christ. Neither does universal reconciliation commit one to the position that there is no Hell or damnation‚ÄîHell can well be the consuming fire through which Christ refines those who turn from him. Universal reconciliation only claims that one day Death and Hades themselves will be destroyed and all immortal souls will be reconciled to Him. It was traditionally claimed by some western scholars such as the Universalist historian George T. Knight (1911) and Pierre Batiffol (English translation 1914) that a form of universal salvation could be found among some theologians in early Christianity.Knight claims that in the first five or six centuries of Christianity, there were six known theological schools, of which four (Alexandria, Antioch, Cesarea, and Edessa or Nisibis) were Universalist, one (Ephesus) accepted conditional immortality, and one (Carthage or Rome) taught the endless punishment of the lost. The Schaff- Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge, 1953, vol. 12, p. 96; retrieved 30/04/09 Origen interpreted the New Testament's reference (Acts 3:21) to a \\"restoration of all things\\", (Greek: apocatastasis of all things), as meaning that sinners might be restored to God and released from Hell, returning the universe to a state identical to its pure beginnings.Westminster Origen Handbook This theory of apocatastasis could be easily interpreted to imply that even devils would be saved, as was the case during the later Origenist controversies. Greek orthodox scholars do not count Gregory of Nyssa (AD 331‚Äì395) as a believer in Universal Salvation.\\"We know well that all evil that happens admits of being annihilated by its opposite (Against Eunomius, Book I). Then he affirms apocatastasis stating that \\"The Son has accomplished the Father's will, and this, in the language of the Apostle, is 'that all men should be saved, '\\" (Against Eunomius, Book XII). In the 17th century, a belief in Christian universalism appeared in England and traveled over to what has become the present-day US Christian Universalists such as Hosea Ballou argued that Jesus taught Universalist principles including universal reconciliation and the divine origin and destiny of all souls. Ballou also argued that some Universalist principles were taught or foreshadowed in the Old Testament. Critics of universalism maintain that the Bible does not teach universal salvation,Robin A. Parry Universal salvation?: the current debate p. 55 while proponents insist that it does. Recent examples of advocates for the position are Kallistos Ware, a Greek Orthodox bishop and retired University of Oxford theologian who states that many of the 'Fathers of Church' postulated the idea of salvation for all, and Saint Silouan of Mt. Athos, who argued that the compassion and love of those in heaven and on earth will extend to eliminating suffering even in hell. In terms of Biblical citations, Father David A. Fisher, Pastor of St. Anthony of Padua Maronite Church and professor of philosophy at Ohio Central State University, has argued that total reconciliation seems to arise from the First Epistle to the Corinthians such as , \\"As all die in Adam, so all will be made alive in Christ\\", and , \\"God will be all in all.\\" Verses that seem to contradict the tradition of complete damnation and come up in arguments also include (NIV), \\"For no one is cast off by the Lord forever. Though he brings grief, he will show compassion, so great is his unfailing love\\", and (NIV), \\"We have put our hope in the living God, who is the Savior of all people, and especially of those who believe.\\" = Theodicy = With regards to the problem of hell, as one that can be traced to the more fundamental theological dilemma of God and the existence of good and evil, theodicy offers its own answers. The main issue holds that if God is all good, powerful, and perfect, then how can he allow evil and, by extension, hell to exist? For some thinkers, the existence of evil and hell could mean that God is not perfectly good and powerful or that there is no God at all. Theodicy tries to address this dilemma by reconciling an all-knowing, all- powerful, and omnibenevelont God with the existence of evil and suffering, outlining the possibility that God and evil can coexist. There are several thoughts or theodicies such as biblical theodicy, the theodicy attributed to Gottfried Leibniz, Plotinian, Irenean, and Augustinian, among others. These differ in their respective arguments but, overall, these theodicies - as opposed to a defense that demonstrates the existence of God and evil or hell - seek to demonstrate a framework where God's existence is plausible. It is, therefore, a logical instead of evidential answer to the problem. A theodicy explains God's reason for allowing evil, that there is a greater good that justifies such permission. Empty Hell theory Some Catholic theologians such as Karl Rahner, Gisbert Greshake, and Cardinal Hans Urs von BalthasarHans Urs von Balthasar ¬´Hoffnung auf das Heil aller?¬ª. Dare we hope: \\"that all men be saved\\"?; with, A short discourse on hell have at length discussed the possibility that any man may be led by a final grace to freely willed repentance if necessary at least at some point in the process of dying. This possible process is described thus by the late Munich dogmatic Prof. Michael Schmaus: \\"If in terms of theology death is a meeting of a man with God in so far as God calls man and he answers obedience, readiness and love, it would be surprising if in the moment of dying the chances of taking position never were given, even contrary to the outward look. [...] One cannot apply to experience as counter-argument, because [...] what happens then in the interior and behind the physiological processes is only known by someone who experiences dying itself, and this unto its very end. We may assume that in the dissolving process of the earthly union of body and soul and with the progressing breakaway from earthly entanglements, a special awakeness accrues to man [...] in which he can say yea or nay to God.\\"Michael Schmaus, Der Glaube der Kirche (\\"The Faith of the Church\\") VI/II p. 84 Balthasar was careful to describe his opinion that Hell might be empty as merely a hope, but even this claim was rejected by most conservative Catholics, including Cardinal Avery Dulles.David L. Schindler Hans Urs von Balthasar: his life and work \\"Until then he had not published very much about obedience and marriage in paradise. The controversy about Hell was left entirely to the final years of von Balthasar's life. At the time no one could have known how much these themes owed to the inspiration of Adrienne von Speyr\\". The Syllabus says in no. 17 that we may not (even) hope for the salvation of all non-Catholics; this seems to mean conversely that there is at least one non-Catholic in all history who will not be saved. seems to say that \\"many\\" will be reproved, which may imply hell (not some lesser purgatory). On the other hand, error no. 17 in question only speaks of those \\"in the true Church of Christ,\\" which need not imply the visible Church. Roman Catholicism allows for the possibility that non-Catholics can be saved, and rejected the view known as Feeneyism, which held that only people in visible communion with the Catholic Church could be saved.

He travelled to Europe, where he met several of the leading reformed thinkers, before returning to Scotland to preach. He was tried as a heretic by Archbishop James Beaton, found guilty and handed over to secular authorities to be burnt at the stake in St Andrews. Early life He was the second son of Sir Patrick Hamilton of Kincavil and Catherine Stewart, daughter of Alexander, Duke of Albany, second son of James II of Scotland. He was born in the diocese of Glasgow, probably at his father's estate of Stanehouse in Lanarkshire, and was most likely educated at Linlithgow. In 1517 he was appointed titular Abbot of Fearn Abbey, Ross-shire. The income from this position paid for him to study at the University of Paris, where he became a Master of the Arts in 1520. It was in Paris, where Martin Luther's writings were already exciting much discussion, that he first learnt the doctrines he would later uphold. According to sixteenth century theologian Alexander Ales, Hamilton subsequently went to Leuven, attracted probably by the fame of Erasmus, who in 1521 had his headquarters there. Return and flight Returning to Scotland, Hamilton selected St Andrews, the Scottish capital of the church and of learning, as his residence. On 9 June 1523 he became a member of St Leonard's College, part of the University of St Andrews, and on 3 October 1524 he was admitted to its faculty of arts, where he was first a student of, and then a colleague of the humanist and logician John Mair. At the university Hamilton attained such influence that he was permitted to conduct, as precentor, a musical mass of his own composition in the cathedral. The reforming doctrines had now obtained a firm hold on the young abbot, and he was eager to communicate them to his fellow-countrymen. Early in 1527 the attention of James Beaton, Archbishop of St Andrews, was directed to the heretical preaching of the young priest, whereupon he ordered that Hamilton should be formally tried. Hamilton fled to Germany, enrolling himself as a student, under Franz Lambert of Avignon, in the new University of Marburg, opened on 30 May 1527 by Philip of Hesse. Among those he met there were Hermann von dem Busche, one of the contributors to the Epistol√¶ Obscurorum Virorum, John Frith and William Tyndale. Late in the autumn of 1527 Hamilton returned to Scotland, living up to his convictions. He went first to his brother's house at Kincavel, near Linlithgow, where he preached frequently, and soon afterwards he married a young lady of noble rank; her name is unrecorded. David Beaton, the Abbot of Arbroath, avoiding open violence through fear of Hamilton's high connections, invited him to a conference at St Andrews. The reformer, predicting that he was going to \\"confirm the pious in the true doctrine\\" by his death, accepted the invitation, and for nearly a month was allowed to preach and dispute. With the publication of Patrick's PlacesPatrick\`s Places (1528) in 1528, he introduced into Scottish theology Martin Luther's emphasis of the distinction of Law and Gospel. Trial and execution St. Salvator's College and Chapel Patrick Hamilton's initials, set into paving at the place of his execution, to commemorate his martyrdom. At length, he was summoned before a council of bishops and clergy presided over by the archbishop. There were thirteen charges, seven based on the doctrines affirmed in Philip Melanchthon's Loci Communes, the first theological exposition of Martin Luther's scriptural study and teachings in 1521. On examination Hamilton maintained their truth, and the council condemned him as a heretic on all thirteen charges. Hamilton was seized, and, it is said, surrendered to the soldiery on an assurance that he would be restored to his friends without injury. However, the council convicted him, after a sham disputation with Friar Campbell, and handed him over to the secular power, to be burnt at the stake as a heretic, outside the front entrance to St Salvator's Chapel in St Andrews. The sentence was carried out on the same day to preclude any attempted rescue by friends. He burnt from noon to 6 p.m.. His last words were \\"Lord Jesus, receive my spirit\\". The spot is today marked with a monogram of his initials set into the cobblestones of the pavement of North Street. His courageous bearing attracted more attention than ever to the doctrines for which he suffered, and greatly helped to spread the Reformation in Scotland. It was said that the \\"reek of Master Patrick Hamilton infected as many as it blew upon\\". His fortitude during martyrdom won over Alexander Ales, who had been appointed to convince Hamilton of his errors, to the Lutheran cause. His martyrdom is unusual in that he was almost alone in Scotland during the Lutheran stage of the Reformation. His only known writings, based upon Loci communes and known as \\"Patrick's Places\\", echoed the doctrine of justification by faith and the contrast between the gospel and the law in a series of clear-cut propositions.'\\"Patrickes Places\\"' was not Hamilton's own title, but was given in the translation into English by John Fryth in 1564, and are presented in Book 8 of the 1570 edition of John Foxe's \\"Acts and Monuments\\".. Students at the University of St Andrews traditionally avoid stepping on the monogram of Hamilton's initials outside St Salvator's Chapel for fear of being cursed and failing their final exams. To lift the curse students may participate in the annual May dip where they traditionally run into the North Sea at 05.00 to wash away their sins and bad luck. A school in Auckland, New Zealand called 'Saint Kentigern College' has a house named after Patrick Hamilton Katherine Hamilton Patrick's sister, Katherine Hamilton, was the wife of the Captain of Dunbar Castle and also a committed Protestant. In March 1539 she was forced in exile to Berwick upon Tweed for her beliefs. She had been in England before and met the Queen, Jane Seymour.State Papers Henry VIII, vol. 5 part 4 cont. (1836), p.155 & note According to the historian John Spottiswood, Katherine was brought to trial for heresy before James V at Holyroodhouse in 1534, and her other brother James Hamilton of Livingston fled. The King was impressed by her conviction shown in her short answer to the prosecutor. He laughed and spoke to her privately, convincing her to abandon her profession of faith. The other accused also recanted for the time.Spottiswood, John, The History of the Church of Scotland, (1668), Bk. 2, pp.65-66 Bibliography For a more extensive bibliography see George M.

Origins  Yarrow was born of humble origins in East London, the son of Esther (Lindo) and Edgar William Yarrow.https://www.gracesguide.co.uk/Alfred_Yarrow His mother was of Spanish Sephardic Jewish background and his father was from an English Christian family; Yarrow was raised a Christian.HighBeam He was educated at University College School.  Shipbuilding  After serving an apprenticeship in Stepney, he opened a yard ‚Äì Yarrow and Hedley (a partnership) ‚Äì at Folly Wall, Poplar on the Isle of Dogs in 1865 to build steam river launches. Yarrow's stern wheel steamers, designed with a shallow draft suitable for river navigation, were used in the early stages of the 1884 Nile Expedition. Yarrow ventured into military vessels from the early 1870s, building torpedo boats for the Argentine and Japanese navies, among other customers. Then in 1892 he built the first two destroyers for the Royal Navy: Havock and Hornet of the Havock class. He struck up a strong friendship and correspondence with Lord Fisher (\\"Jackie Fisher\\"), and subsequently Yarrow Shipbuilders became a lead contractor for the Royal Navy for smaller, but almost always fast, boats. By this time, the Hedley partnership had been dissolved (1875), and the company was known as Yarrow & Co, and around 1898 moved out of Folly shipyard to the nearby London Yard. It was to be a short-lived move, for less than 10 years later (1906‚Äì1908) Yarrow gradually moving his yard northwards to Scotstoun on the banks of the River Clyde on the west coast of Scotland, closing the London shipyard in 1908. An operation in Esquimalt, Canada, was purchased in 1913, renamed Yarrows Ltd., and after the Second World War sold to Burrard Dry Dock. Yarrow's strong naval engineering capabilities and inventive mind were behind a number of inventions designed to drive ships ever faster, and in 1912 he was appointed to the Royal Commission on Fuel and Engines. Long after he died, the shipyard remained famous throughout navies of the world for building smaller fast vessels.  Personal life  This photo of Woodlands House appeared in the November 1897 edition of Cassier's Magazine as part of an article about Alfred Yarrow.Eric Yarrow, son of Sir Alfred Yarrow He lived in Greenwich, London for some years, occupying Woodlands House in Mycenae Road, Westcombe Park for some years from 1896. In 1899, Yarrow encouraged a young engineer who lived nearby in Greenwich, Alexander Duckham, to specialise in lubricants, leading to the establishment of the Duckhams oil company. Created a baronet in 1916, Sir Alfred displayed extensive philanthropic tendencies throughout his later years, donating towards: a convalescent home on the Isle of Dogs for the benefit of children; residences for soldiers' widows in Hampstead Garden Suburb (the Barnett Homestead, Erskine Hill); a school, the Royal Merchant Navy College, in Berkshire; a home and hospital for children in Broadstairs, Kent; a scholarship at University College London; a gallery at Oundle School in Northamptonshire; and medical research at the Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel, among other noble causes. He also left a bequest to the Institution of Civil Engineers. His first wife was Minnie Florence Franklin, daughter of Theodosia (n√©e Balderson; daughter of Major G. R. Balderson) and Frank Franklin. Frank's family were Jewish emigrants from Germany. Yarrow's daughter Minnie Ethel Yarrow was invested as an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE); she married on 18 December 1900 Bertrand Edward Dawson, 1st Baron Dawson of Penn and 1st Viscount Dawson of Penn. The actor Damian Lewis is their great-grandson. He was succeeded by his son Harold (1884‚Äì1962). His younger son, 2/Lt Eric Fernandez Yarrow (born 5 January 1895), was killed in action, aged 20, on 8 May 1915, whilst serving with the Argyll & Sutherland Highlanders. In 1918, he donated an Art Gallery to Oundle School in Eric's memory which is known as the Yarrow Gallery. Son Norman Alfred Yarrow (10 July 1891-d. 1956) ran Yarrows shipyards in Victoria, British Columbia. Yarrow had two other daughters, Florence Yarrow (d. 8 March 1948) and Evelyn Yarrow (d. 13 January 1963).

Life Originally Alexander Alane, he was born at Edinburgh. He studied at St Andrews in the newly founded college of St Leonard's, where he graduated in 1515. Some time afterwards he was appointed a canon of the collegiate church, where he contended vigorously for the scholastic theology as against the doctrines of the Reformers. His views entirely changed, however, on the execution of Patrick Hamilton, abbot of Fern, in 1528. He had been chosen to meet Hamilton in controversy, with a view to convincing him of his errors, but the arguments of the Scottish proto- martyr and, above all, the spectacle of his heroism at the stake impressed Alesius so powerfully that he was won over to the cause of the Reformers. A sermon he preached before the Synod at St Andrews against the dissoluteness of the clergy offended the provost, who placed him in prison, and might have carried his resentment further if Alesius had not escaped to Germany in 1532. After travelling through northern Europe, he settled down at Wittenberg, where he made the acquaintance of Martin Luther and Philipp Melanchthon, and signed the Augsburg confession. Meanwhile, he was tried in Scotland for heresy and condemned without a hearing. In 1533 a decree of the Scottish clergy, prohibiting the reading of the New Testament by the laity, drew from Alesius a defence of the right of the people, in the form of a letter to King James V of Scotland. A reply to this by Johann Cochlaeus, also addressed to the Scottish king, occasioned a second letter from Alesius, in which he amplified his argument with great force and entered into more general questions. In August 1534 he and a few others were excommunicated at Holyrood by the deputy of the archbishop of St Andrews. When King Henry VIII of England (1509‚Äì47) broke with the church of Rome Alesius was persuaded to go to England, where he was cordially received (August 1535) by the king and his advisers, Thomas Cranmer and Thomas Cromwell. He briefly attended the court of Henry's queen, Anne Boleyn, of whom he thought very highly and he was actually in London during the circumstances of her downfall, although it was his belief that she was not guilty of adultery or any of the crimes for she was put to death. Later, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth I, Anne Boleyn's daughter, he wrote a letter to the new Queen detailing his memories of her mother's final weeks in power. After a short stay at Lambeth Palace he was appointed, through the influence of Cromwell, then chancellor of the university, to lecture on theology at the Queens' College, Cambridge; but when he had delivered a few expositions of the Hebrew psalms, he was prevented from continuing by the papal party. Returning to London he supported himself for some time by practising as a physician. In 1537 he attended a convocation of the clergy, and at the request of Cromwell conducted a controversy with John Stokesley, Bishop of London, on the nature of the sacraments. His argument was published in 1544 under the title In 1539 Alesius was compelled to flee for a second time to Germany, as a result of Thomas Cromwell's fall from power and the enactment of the statute of the Six Articles. He was appointed to a theological chair at the university of Frankfurt (Oder), where he was the first professor to teach the reformed doctrines. He was in England again for a short time during Edward VI's reign, and was commissioned by Cranmer to make a Latin version of the First Prayer- Book (1549) for the information of Martin Bucer, whose opinion was desired. Returning to Leipzig he passed the remainder of his days in peace and honour, and was twice elected Rector of the University. Works His writings were both exegetical and controversial, but chiefly the latter. They include Expositio Libri Psalmorum Davidis (1550). His controversial works refer to such subjects as the translation of the Bible into the vernacular, against Servetus, etc. Alesius published a large number of exegetical, dogmatic and polemical works, of which over twenty are mentioned by Bale in his List of English Writers. In his controversial works he upholds the synergistic views of the Scottish theologian John Major. He displayed his interest in his native land by the publication of a Cohortatio ad Concordiam Pietatis, missa in Patriam suam (1544), which had the express approval of Luther, and a Cohortatio ad Pietatis Concordiam ineundam (1559).

Johann Cochlaeus (Cochl√§us) (1479 ‚Äì January 10, 1552) was a German humanist, music theorist, and controversialist. Life Originally Johann Dobneck, he was born of poor parents at Wendelstein (near Nuremberg), from which he obtained the punning surname Cochlaeus (spiral), for which he occasionally substituted Wendelstinus. Educated at Nuremberg by the humanist Heinrich Grieninger, he entered the University of Cologne in 1504, and there associated with Hermann von Neuenahr, Ulrich von Hutten, and other humanists. He also knew well Carl von Miltitz, who later became papal chamberlain.Schaff- Herzog Encyclopedia, article on Cochlaeus by T. Kolde. In 1507 he graduated; he left Cologne in May 1510 to become schoolmaster at Nuremberg, where he brought out several school manuals. During the years 1515-19 he traveled in Italy as tutor to three nephews of Willibald Pirkheimer. In 1515 he was at Bologna, hearing (with disgust) Eck's disputation on the subject of usury, and associating with von Hutten among the humanists. He took his doctor's degree at Ferrara (1517), and spent some time in Rome, where he was ordained priest. In 1520 he became dean of the Liebfrauenkirche at Frankfurt. He maintained good relations with the episcopal court of Mainz and with Hieronymus Aleander of Worms, who applied to him for the purpose of a discussion on the best means of opposing Martin Luther. Cochlaeus became a controversialist against the Lutherans. He was present at the Diets of Worms (1521), and later at Speyer (1526 and 1529), Augsburg (1530) and Regensburg (1541). In the autumn of 1523 he went to Rome as he did not feel safe at Frankfurt, but returned early in 1524. Meanwhile, his patrons and friends at Frankfurt had joined the reformers. Cochlaeus accompanied Lorenzo Campeggio, the papal nuncio in Holy Roman Empire, to the Convention of Regensburg as interpreter and member of the commission which discussed the reform of the clergy. His position at Frankfurt becoming untenable during the German Peasants' War, he fled to Cologne in 1525, and in 1526 received a canonry at St. Victor's in Mainz. He attended the Diet of Speyer in 1526, but his hope of holding a disputation with Luther was not fulfilled. In 1529 he became secretary to George, Duke of Saxony, at Dresden and Meissen. The death of his patron (1539) compelled him to take flight. In September 1539 he became canon at Breslau, where he died. Works Cochlaeus was a prolific writer and a feared opponent, who attracted very little sympathy from any side. His humanist ideas raised the suspicion of many Catholics, and his polemical writings won him the hatred of the Reformers. He published under the name of Wendelstein his first piece, Musica (1507). His first theological works were De Utroque Sacerdotio (1520) and some smaller writings published in rapid succession. In During the following years he wrote tracts against Luther's principal theses on the doctrine of justification, on the freedom of the will, and on Catholic teaching in De Gratia Sacramentorum, 1522; De Baptismo parvulorum, 1523; A commentary on 154 Articles and others. Luther engaged with Cochl√¶us only in a single work, Adversus Armatum Virum Cocleum. In his Colloqium Cochlaei cum Luthero, Cochlaeus reported on his discussion with Luther on April 24, 1521, about issues, such as the origin of Luther's doctrine of predestination, the Eucharist, and the authority of the Bible.Paul Arblaster, Gergely Juh√°sz & Guido Latr√© (eds.), Tyndale‚Äôs Testament, Turnhout: Brepols, 2002, pp. 150-1. After writing a series of pamphlets discussing the main themes of Luther's theology, Cochlaeus became convinced that any further argumentation with Luther was futile. Accordingly, instead of convincing Luther, Cochlaeus attempted to come to an agreement with Melanchthon at the Diet of Augsburg in 1530, but without much success. His historical biography of LutherCommentaria de actis et scriptis Martini Lutheri Saxonis chronographice ex ordine ab anno Domini 1517 usque ad annum 1546 inclusive fideliter conscripta (Mainz, 1549). was popular and influential. It became a model and source for later polemics, and the view expounded in it that the Protestant Reformation was nothing but an incidental jealousy between the Dominican and Augustinian orders had a wide circulation. He left one of the few contemporary notices of the young Michael Servetus as well as notes on Tyndale's abortive attempt to print his New Testament at Cologne in 1525.

In his career, he rose from a petty nobleman to a magnate holding one of the highest offices in the Commonwealth, something that was unprecedented in the Commonwealth history. On 22 July 1664 he received the office of the voivode of Kiev and on 2 January 1665, a few weeks before his death, he was given the office of Field Hetman (one of top military commanders) of the Crown of the Polish Kingdom. He is remembered as an accomplished military commander, and regarded as a Polish national hero. His status in Polish history is acknowledged by a mention of his name in the Polish national anthem. Czarniecki made significant contributions fighting the Khmelnytsky Uprising, during the Russo-Polish War, and the Polish‚ÄìSwedish war (The Deluge). His use of guerrilla warfare against Swedes is credited as one of the main reasons for the eventual Polish victory in this war.  Biography  = Early career = Stefan Czarniecki was born in 1599 on the family estate of Czarnca near W≈Çoszczowa in southern Poland, into the szlachta (nobility) Czarniecki family. The date of his birth is only an assumption, as no documents exist to prove it without a doubt; most historians, as noted by historians Leszek Podhorodecki and Adam Kersten, accept the 1599 date, although historian Zdzis≈Çaw Spieralski argued for 1604. His father, Krzysztof Czarniecki, was a soldier who participated in several wars in the late 16th and early 17th century, and eventually became a courtier to Polish queen Constance of Austria. Whereas historian Miros≈Çaw Nagielski notes that the Czarniecki family was not well off, which limited some of Stefan's life chances, Podhorecki points out that they owned several villages and even a small town, and the family wealth was \\"not small\\". However, Stefan had ten siblings (he himself was the sixth out of nine brothers), and divided into that many parts, the family resources would be stretched rather thinly. However, involvement with the queen's court allowed Krzysztof to boost his sons' careers with his court influence, where they were often able to serve as young courtiers themselves. Nothing is known about Stefan's childhood. His family could not afford to send him to a university abroad (only one of his brothers would do so); therefore he embarked on a military career at an early age. Before that, he attended a jesuit college, either in Krak√≥w or Sandomierz, achieving a solid secondary education. After finishing his schooling, he became a courtier to then-royal prince and future king of Poland John II Casimir Vasa. As Stefan could not afford the equipment needed to join a hussar unit, he learned the art of war serving with the Lisowczycy mercenaries, joining them as towarzysz (companion, a junior cavalry officer) in the spring of 1621. Already an officer at the age of eighteen, he took part in the battle of Chocim (Khotyn) in 1621, where the Commonwealth army stopped the Ottomans and ended the Polish‚ÄìOttoman War (1620‚Äì21). His years with the brutal Lisowczycy mercenaries would impact his strategy in the latter years, where he would not hesitate to use any means necessary ‚Äì including mistreatment of civilians ‚Äì to achieve victory. The next time he took arms was in 1623, when his brother Pawe≈Ç received a nomination as a rotmistrz of light (cossack) cavalry of the regular army (wojsko kwarciane), and recruited some of his siblings, including Stefan, into his unit. They served under hetman Stanis≈Çaw Koniecpolski in the campaigns against the Tatars in 1624 (participating in the battle of Martyn√≥w). In 1625 they took part in the quelling of a Cossack Zhmaylo Uprising. He fought later against Gustavus Adolphus (1626‚Äì1629) (part of the Polish‚ÄìSwedish War). His light cavalry was used in reconnaissance, diversion, and raiding the enemy territory. In 1627 Stefan, serving in his brother's chorƒÖgiew, was promoted to chorƒÖ≈ºy. On 6‚Äì7 August that year he participated in the battle of Tczew, where Gustavus Adolphus was nearly killed. During those years, he learned much from observing a master of military arts, hetman Koniecpolski, who often commanded the Polish army in which he served, and from Poland's Swedish opponents, and earlier from the Cossacks and Tatars they fought. As the Polish‚ÄìSwedish war ended, in 1630, Czarniecki enlisted in the Habsburg forces and continued to fight against the Swedes, participating in the battle of Breitenfeld. In 1633 he joined the Commonwealth forces again, to fight under the new Polish king, W≈Çadys≈Çaw IV, in the Smolensk War against Muscovy that lasted until 1634. During the Smolensk War he learned Western tactics used by the foreign mercenary troops. In December 1633 he commanded a raiding unit that successfully raided and pillaged behind the Russian lines, spreading terror, disrupting supply lines, and burning down the town of Kozelsk. For his achievements in that war, in which he advanced to a porucznik rank in the light \\"cossack\\" cavalry unit under hetman Marcin Kazanowski, he received some land in the Smolensk Voivodeship near Starodub. After that war, he moved to a more prestigious hussar unit (rota), and likely due to a reduction of the royal army, he served in the private formation of W≈Çadys≈Çaw Myszkowski and later, voivode Stanis≈Çaw Lubomirski. In 1635 he might have served as a military adviser to John II Casimir Vasa, and possibly accompanied the king to Vienna. In 1637 he married Zofia Kobierzycka, and later that year he fought in the Pawluk Uprising against the rebellious Cossacks under Pavel Mikhnovych, participating in the battle of Kumejki. He led a cavalry charge at Kumejki which was instrumental in the Polish victory there. Earlier that year he served as a military delegate to the Sejm (parliament) in Warsaw. = Struggles against the Cossacks = Stefan Czarniecki For the next several years he would serve on the hostility-plagued south-eastern border, where he made his home in the city of Ill≈Ñce. In 1644 under Koniecpolski he took part in the battle of Ochmat√≥w where Commonwealth forces dealt a crushing defeat to Toƒüay bey's (Tuhaj Bej) Tatars. He served as one of seven pu≈Çkowniks in Koniecpolski's army, and once again his cavalry unit charge proved to be a decisive moment of the battle, bringing him much fame. That year he also became a regimentarz in his own light cavalry unit, but he still held the rank of a porucznik of hussars. He took an active part in the battles against the Cossacks in the Khmelnytsky Uprising. On 16 May 1648 he was one of the many noble Polish prisoners who fell into the hands of Bohdan Khmelnytsky at the battle of Zhovti Vody, but he was quickly ransomed. He participated in the defense of the Kudak Fortress, which surrendered on 26 September; he was once again captured and not released until the autumn of 1649, in the aftermath of the Treaty of Zborov. He served as a porucznik in the hussar chorƒÖgiew of hetman Miko≈Çaj Potocki, a military judge deputized by the hetman, and a member of his staff, meeting with the new king of Poland, John Casimir Vasa. He was part of the fighting at the battle of Berestechko and battle of Bila Tserkva in 1651. He received the title of chorƒÖ≈ºy of Sandomierz, and was elected the military deputy for the Sejm in January 1652. According to Nagielski, Czarniecki, while returning from the Sejm, witnessed the massacre of Polish prisoners in the aftermath of the battle of Batoh; This scene made him reject the notions that a compromise with the enemies of the Commonwealth was a likely or desired outcome. Podhorodecki however notes that another historian, Wojciech Jacek D≈Çugo≈Çƒôcki, questions Czarniecki's presence there, and concludes that we have no conclusive proof whether Czarniecki was present at Batoh, The massacre further escalated the hostilities and the surrounding hatred; illustrating that is a letter Czariecki wrote soon after the battle, in which he promised that if enough military forces are gathered and given to him, he will leave few Ruthenians alive. Later that year Czarniecki received territories from the king, along with the office of Crown obo≈∫ny. In 1653 he led a unit to Ukraine, ransacking much of the Cossack-held lands, although the attrition among the troops was high. During that campaign Czarniecki was wounded at Monastyryska. He continued his suppression campaign in 1654, and the following January took part in the battle of Okhmativ. In May 1655 he was called from Ukraine to Warsaw, as the king John Casimir Vasa, respected his experience and requested his presence at a new war council, convened to discuss the looming thread of the war with Sweden. At that time his reputation was significant; Sejm often passed resolutions applauding him for his efforts to reclaim Ukraine, and he was even held in much consideration by the Ottomans, then temporarily allied with the Commonwealth. On 14 May 1655 he received the office of the castellan of Kiev, a position that made him a member of the Senate of Poland. = The Swedish Deluge = Czarniecki near P≈Çock, painting by Juliusz Kossak When Charles X of Sweden invaded Poland in 1655, Czarniecki distinguished himself by his defence of Krak√≥w, which he eventually surrendered on good terms, retreating with his army. He remained loyal to the Polish king, even when much of the army, including most of the senators and the hetmans, temporarily joined the Swedes. His vocal support for the wavering king, which at that time found refuge abroad, and was considering abdication, was instrumental. For his continuing support, the Polish king rewarded him with more lands, and the office of the royal army regimentarz. He led guerrilla warfare against Swedish troops of Charles X, a type of a campaign he authored, despite the objections of the hetmans, who by that time returned to serve under John Casmimir Vasa. The mobile Swedish forces, even with their significant firepower, proved to be rather vulnerable to Czarniecki's guerrilla-style warfare. Czarniecki was defeated at the battle of Go≈ÇƒÖb in mid-February 1656, but later inflicted serious defeats upon the Swedes, notably at the Battle of Warka in April that year. The tide of the war turned several times that year, and he was again defeated at the battle of K≈Çecko and battle of Kscynia. His defeats, however, were limited, and in most cases he was able to retreat with most of his army in good order. Under his direction the popular rising against the Swedish troops in Greater Poland proved highly successful. It was against his advice that the battle of Warsaw was fought, and his subsequent strategy neutralized the ill effects of this defeat. Despite support from the king, Czarniecki was seen by many older, established noble family as an arrogant newcomer, and they prevented him from getting the hetman office that year; instead early next year he received the office of the voivode of Ruthenia, and an extraordinary title of the \\"general and vice commander of the royal forces\\", which put him in a position of an unofficial hetman-like authority. The Field Crown Hetmanship went to Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski, also an accomplished commander, if not so much as Czarniecki ‚Äì but from a magnate Lubomirski family; Czarniecki commented famously that \\"Not of salt, or fields, I am, but from what hurts me\\", alluding to the fact that Lubormirski family built its fortune on salt trade and agriculture, whereas his smaller one was built through military service ‚Äì yet it was money and politics, not military experience, that decided who was to get the hetman's office. = Final battles = In 1657 he was instrumental in defeating the forces of George II R√°k√≥czi at the battle of Magier√≥w. In 1658 and 1659 he aided Danes during the Danish‚ÄìSwedish War, fighting at Als and at the battle of Kolding. Czarniecki at the battle of Kolding. Painting by J√≥zef Brandt. On the conclusion of the Peace of Oliwa, which adjusted the long outstanding differences between Poland and Sweden, Czarniecki was transferred to the eastern frontier where the war with Russia reignited. He distinguished himself in the campaign of 1660, where he won the victories of the battle of Po≈Çonka, battle of Basia, and battle of Kuszliki. This campaign, however, marked the zenith of his popularity. King John II Casimir Vasa attempted to involve him in the unpopular plan of vivente rege ‚Äì to bypass the traditions of the royal elections in Poland and instead chose the next successor to the Polish throne (John II Casimir favored Louis, Grand Cond√©) still during the life of the previous king. His reputation among the unpaid and dissenting military took a dive; and many criticized him for appropriating the entire ransom that the Russians paid for their prisoners from Po≈Çonka. During the Sejm of 1662 some military representatives demanded sanctions and punishments to be levied on him. His last campaign took place at the end of 1664. He led an army against the Russians, but the Siege of Hlukhiv was not successful, and a new Cossack uprising of Ivan Sirko forced the Polish troops to fall back. On 22 July 1664 he received the office of the voivode of Kiev, and on 2 January 1665 he was appointed Field Crown Hetman. Before receiving the news of the nomination he desired for years, he was wounded at Lysianka. Called back by the king, who feared that magnate Jerzy Sebastian Lubomirski that he just banished might start a rebellion, his recent wound became infected, and he died on 16 February 1665 in Soko≈Ç√≥wka (now Sokol√≠vka) near Lw√≥w, six weeks after receiving this supreme distinction.  Legacy  A bust of Czarniecki by Andrzej Le Brun, held in Royal Castle, Warsaw. Czarniecki received a state funeral in Warsaw, and has been interred in the tomb chapel of the church founded by him in Czarnca. He left his estates to a nephew, Stefan Stanis≈Çaw Czarniecki, but the Czarniecki name did not last long, and the wealth he gathered became instead the foundation of the Branicki family of magnates. Czarniecki is remembered as one of the most able Polish commanders of all times. Podhorecki called him the greatest Polish military expert in \\"hit-and-run tactics\\", and notes that he was the longest-serving of the major Polish military commanders of his era, that he participated in 27 large battles, commanding 17 of them. He is seen as instrumental in defeating the Swedes during the Deluge, although he was even more successful in his battles against the Russians. His career, rising from a simple noble family to the rank of a hetman and a wealthy magnate, was unprecedented in the Commonwealth's history. His legend had begun growing even during his lifetime, as he became a hero of poems and songs. Few negative rumors about him, popular in the last few years of his life, survived after his death. During the period of Enlightenment in Poland he was written about by poets and writers such as Stanis≈Çaw Potocki, Franciszek Karpi≈Ñski, Julian Ursyn Niemcewicz and Franciszek Ksawery Dmowski. A biography by Micha≈Ç Krajewski cemented his legend of a hero rescuing Poland from anarchy and invasion. That legend that became even stronger during the times of the partitions of Poland in the 19th century, where the artists of the Polish romanticism period used him as a symbol of patriotism, and a reminder of military successes. He appears in the poem Przed≈õwit of Zygmunt Krasi≈Ñski, but much more significant was his portrayal in The Trilogy of Henryk Sienkiewicz, particularly the second book, The Deluge. It was during that time that his pursuit of the retreating Swedes to Pomerania and Denmark (1658‚Äì1659), particularly his crossing with his entire army to the Danish isle of Alsen, was commemorated in the song of the Polish Napoleonic Legions that would eventually become the Polish national anthem, the \\"DƒÖbrowski's Mazurka\\", with the words commemorating his marine excursion to the island of Als: It was only during the time of the Second Polish Republic when more modern, serious historical work begun analyzing his history that a less hagiographic account begun emerging; W≈Çadys≈Çaw Czapli≈Ñski wrote that Czarniecki was \\"first and foremost a soldier\\", and noted his faults such as brutality and greed. Modern historiography of Czarniecki includes works of Czapli≈Ñski, Stanis≈Çaw Herbst, Adam Kersten and Zdzis≈Çaw Spieralski; however Podhorecki notes that while he has been a major figure in the Polish history, and is discussed extensively in Polish historiography, he has never been a subject of much interest to foreign historians, concluding that he was a major persona in Polish, but not European, history.

These were cast iron engines, and used just three main bearings. B4B Introduced in 1944, the B4B displaced and powered the Volvo PV444. It was a departure for Volvo who had not produced an automobile with a four-cylinder engine in nearly 20 years. The B4B was equipped with a single down-draught carburetor. Suppliers of ancillaries included Autolite (ignition distributors and generators), Zenith and Carter Carburetors, and Bosch (ignition distributors, generators and starter motors.) B14A The B14A was essentially a twin carb version of the B4B. These two engines were nearly identical, except for the induction systems. The B14A carb system was supplied by the British SU Carburettor concern and the carbs used were designated HS2. These diminutive carbs, familiar to any English sports car fan, improved the acceleration and overall performance of the B4B which in turn accomplished Volvo's corporate desire to make the PV444 cars powered by these engines more attractive to the American audience, whose attention Volvo hoped to gain. While B14A engines are considered rare in the US setting, they were even rarer in Europe. The production run lasted for one year. Some of the earliest P1900 roadsters were built with B14s but many of the short production of 67 of these open fiberglass cars received the replacement for the B14 -- the B16. B16 The B16A and B16B (single carb and twin carbs respectively) were a bored out development of the B14A which in turn was sired by the B4B. These engines were fitted to the PV444 in its final two years (1957 and 1958), the Volvo PV544 in its 1958 introduction, as well as the companion estate and van versions known as Volvo P445, Volvo P210, and Volvo Duett. A new Volvo automobile introduced in 1956, known in some markets as the Volvo Amazon or Volvo 122 was the first production Volvo to sport this engine in any significant number although some of the later examples of the short-lived Volvo P1900 were also fitted with them. Other applications of this engine found use in marine, industrial and agricultural settings. The Volvo BM T425 tractor is one such example of a non-automotive use for the B16. The appearance of the B16 was not unlike its predecessor, the B14. The block and cylinder heads bore no particular difference at a glance. The B16B sported twin SU HS4 carbs, notably larger than the B14A's HS2 carbs. Also, the remote oil filter attached next to the water pump on the ignition distributor side of the engine on the B14 had been relocated to a housing under the intake and exhaust manifold side on the B16. The exhaust manifold which dumped centrally on the B14 now was made to exit towards the rear of the B16 manifold. In automotive applications, the B16 was featured from 1957 to 1961 model years although in marine and industrial applications it was used for a number of years after. It was replaced in 1962 model year cars by the 5 main-bearing B18 engine of 1.8 litres which had been first seen by the automotive public in the 1961 Volvo P1800 sports car. With the discontinuation of the B16 also came the end of 6 volt electrical systems in Volvo cars.

Sayyid Hamoud bin Mohammed Al-Said, GCSI, (1853 - 18 July 1902) (ruled 27 August 1896 - 18 July 1902) () was the British-controlled Omani sultan of the protectorate of Zanzibar, who outlawed slavery on the island. Portrait on a Zanzibar 1899 issue stamp Hamoud became sultan with the support of the British consul, Sir Basil Cave, upon the death of Sayyid Hamad bin Thuwaini. Before he could enter the palace, another potential contender for the throne, Sayyid Khalid bin Barghash, seized the palace and declared himself sultan. The British responded the next day, 26 August 1896, by issuing an ultimatum to Khalid and his entourage to evacuate the palace by 9:00 am on 27 August. When he refused, British warships fired on the palace and other strategic locations in the city, destroying them and causing Khalid and his group to flee. According to the Guinness Book of World Records the resultant Anglo-Zanzibar War was the shortest war in history, and the same day Hamoud was able to assume the title of sultan, more indebted to the British than ever. Hamoud demanded that slavery be banned in Zanzibar and that all the slaves be freed.

He served in the administrations of Presidents Gerald Ford, Jimmy Carter, and Bill Clinton. He was Secretary of Labor from 1993 to 1997. He was a member of President Barack Obama's economic transition advisory board. Reich has been the Chancellor's Professor of Public Policy at the Goldman School of Public Policy at UC Berkeley since January 2006. He was formerly a professor at Harvard University's John F. Kennedy School of Government and professor of social and economic policy at the Heller School for Social Policy and Management of Brandeis University. He has also been a contributing editor of The New Republic, The American Prospect (also chairman and founding editor), Harvard Business Review, The Atlantic, The New York Times, and The Wall Street Journal. Reich is a political commentator on programs including Erin Burnett OutFront, CNN Tonight, Anderson Cooper's AC360, Hardball with Chris Matthews, This Week with George Stephanopoulos, CNBC's Kudlow & Company, and APM's Marketplace. In 2008, Time magazine named him one of the Ten Best Cabinet Members of the century, and in the same year The Wall Street Journal placed him sixth on its list of Most Influential Business Thinkers. He has published 18 books which have been translated into 22 languages, including the best-sellers The Work of Nations, Reason, Saving Capitalism, Supercapitalism, Aftershock: The Next Economy and America's Future, and a best-selling e-book, Beyond Outrage. He is also chairman of Common Cause and writes his own blog about the political economy at Robertreich.org. The Robert Reich‚ÄìJacob Kornbluth film Saving Capitalism was selected to be a Netflix Original, and debuted in November 2017, and their film Inequality for All won a U.S. Documentary Special Jury Award for Achievement in Filmmaking at the 2013 Sundance Film Festival in Utah. In 2015 Reich and Kornbluth founded Inequality Media, a nonprofit digital media company. Inequality Media's videos feature Reich discussing topics relating to inequality and power primarily in the United States, including universal basic income, the racial wealth gap, affordable housing, and gerrymandering.  Early life and career  Reich was born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the son of Mildred Dorf (n√©e Freshman) and Edwin Saul Reich (1914‚Äì2016), who owned a women's clothing store. His family is Jewish. As a child, he was diagnosed with multiple epiphyseal dysplasia, also known as Fairbank's disease, a bone disorder that results in short stature among other symptoms. This condition made him a target for bullies and he sought out the protection of older boys; one of them was Michael Schwerner, who was later a victim in the murders of Chaney, Goodman, and Schwerner by the Ku Klux Klan in 1964 for the registration of African-American voters. Reich cites this event as an inspiration to \\"fight the bullies, to protect the powerless, to make sure that the people without a voice have a voice\\". He attended John Jay High School in Cross River, New York, and Dartmouth College, graduating with an A.B. summa cum laude in 1968 and winning a Rhodes Scholarship to study Philosophy, Politics, and Economics at University College, Oxford. While at Dartmouth, Reich went on a date with Hillary Rodham, the future Hillary Clinton, then an undergraduate at Wellesley College. While a Rhodes Scholar at Oxford, Reich first met Bill Clinton, also a Rhodes Scholar. Although he was drafted to serve in the Vietnam War, he did not pass the physical as he was under the required minimum height of five feet. Reich subsequently earned a J.D. from Yale Law School, where he was an editor of the Yale Law Journal. At Yale, he was classmates with Bill and Hillary Clinton, Clarence Thomas, Michael Medved, and Richard Blumenthal. From 1973 to 1974, he served as law clerk to Judge Frank M. Coffin, chief judge of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the First Circuit; and from 1974 to 1976 was assistant to the U.S. Solicitor General, Robert Bork. In 1977, President Jimmy Carter appointed him director of the Policy Planning Staff at the Federal Trade Commission. From 1980 until 1992, Reich taught at the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, where he wrote a series of influential books and articles, including The Next American Frontier and The Work of Nations.  Secretary of Labor  Official Department of Labor portrait of Robert Reich Bill Clinton incorporated Reich's thinking into his 1992 campaign platform, \\"Putting People First\\", and after being elected invited Reich to head his economic transition team. Reich later joined the administration as Secretary of Labor. During his tenure, he implemented the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA), successfully lobbied to increase the minimum wage, lobbied to pass the School-to-Work Jobs Act, and to integrate all job-training and job-displacement programs so workers who lost their jobs could get access to all the help they needed to get new ones that paid at least as much as the old. In addition, Reich used the office as a platform for focusing national attention on the need to help American workers to adapt to the new economy. He popularized the term \\"corporate welfare\\"‚Äîarguing that the nation could get the money it needed to retrain people and move them from welfare to work by cutting \\"aid for dependent corporations\\". He advocated that the country provide more opportunities for workers to learn technological skills.  After the Clinton administration  In 1996, between Clinton's re-election and second inauguration, Reich decided to leave the department to spend more time with his sons, then in their teen years. He published his experiences working for the Clinton administration in Locked in the Cabinet. After publication of the book, Reich received criticism for embellishing events with invented dialogue. The paperback release of the memoir revised or omitted the inventions. Reich became a professor at Brandeis University, teaching courses for undergraduates as well as in the Heller School for Social Policy and Management. In 2003, he was elected the Professor of the Year by the undergraduate student body. In 2002, he ran for Governor of Massachusetts. He also published an associated campaign book, I'll Be Short. Reich was the first Democratic candidate for a major political office to support same-sex marriage. He also pledged support for abortion rights and strongly condemned capital punishment. His campaign staff was largely made up of his Brandeis students. Although his campaign had little funding, he came in a close second out of six candidates in the Democratic primary with 25% of the vote; Shannon O'Brien, the first-place finisher, went on to lose the general election to Republican Mitt Romney. In 2003, he was awarded the V√°clav Havel Foundation VIZE 97 Prize, by the former Czech President, for his writings in economics and politics. In 2004, he published Reason: Why Liberals Will Win the Battle for America. In addition to his professorial role, he was a weekly contributor to the American Public Media public radio program Marketplace, and a regular columnist for The American Prospect, which he co-founded in 1990. He has also frequently contributed to CNBC's Kudlow & Company and On the Money. Robert Reich in 2011 In early 2005, there was speculation that Reich would once again seek the Democratic nomination for Governor of Massachusetts. He instead endorsed the then-little-known candidacy of Deval Patrick, who had previously served as Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights in the Clinton Administration. Patrick won the party's endorsement, a three-way primary with nearly 50% of the vote, and the general election in November 2006. In September 2005 Reich testified against John Roberts at his confirmation hearings for Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court. On January 1, 2006, Reich joined the faculty of UC Berkeley's Goldman School of Public Policy. Since then, he has taught a popular undergraduate course called Wealth and Poverty, in addition to his graduate courses. Reich is also a member of the board of trustees for the Blum Center for Developing Economies at the University of California, Berkeley. The center is focused on finding solutions to address the crisis of extreme poverty and disease in the developing world. On April 18, 2008, Reich endorsed Barack Obama for President of the United States. During the 2008 primaries, Reich published an article that was critical of the Clintons, referring to Bill Clinton's attacks on Barack Obama as \\"ill-tempered and ill- founded\\", and accusing the Clintons of waging \\"a smear campaign against Obama that employs some of the worst aspects of the old politics\\". On April 3, 2009, Reich commented that published U6 employment figures indicated that the United States was in a depression. In 2010, his weekly column is syndicated by Tribune Content Agency. In 2013, he teamed up with filmmaker Jacob Kornbluth to produce the documentary Inequality for All, based on his book Aftershock which won a Special Jury Award at the Sundance Film Festival. On February 26, 2016, he endorsed Bernie Sanders for President of the United States. After Sanders ended his campaign, Reich urged Sanders's supporters to back eventual Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. Since at least summer 2016, Reich has contributed an opinion column to Newsweek. In 2020, he again endorsed Bernie Sanders for President. In 2017, he again teamed up with Jacob Kornbluth to produce the documentary Saving Capitalism, based on his book of that name. Netflix chose the film to be a Netflix Original Documentary. In the documentary, Reich posits that large corporations began in the late 1960s to use financial power to purchase influence among the political class and consolidate political power, highlighting in particular the influence of the 2010 Citizens United ruling that allowed corporations to contribute to election campaigns. In the documentary, he advocates for grassroots political mobilization among working class Americans to countervail the political power of corporate America. In February 2017, Reich criticized UC Berkeley's decision to host Donald Trump supporter Milo Yiannopoulos. Following protests on the Berkeley Campus Reich stated that although he didn't \\"want to add to the conspiratorial musings\\" he wouldn't rule out the possibility the \\"agitators\\" were a right-wing false flag for Trump to strip universities of federal funding. On May 31, 2020, Reich declared that \\"by having no constructive response to any of the monumental crises now convulsing America, Trump has abdicated his office.\\"Reich, Robert, Fire, pestilence, and a country at war with itself: the Trump presidency is over, The Guardian, May 31, 2020  Political stances  Reich speaking in 2009 In an interview with The New York Times, he explained that \\"I don't believe in redistribution of wealth for the sake of redistributing wealth. But I am concerned about how we can afford to pay for what we as a nation need to do [...] [Taxes should pay] for what we need in order to be safe and productive. As Oliver Wendell Holmes once wrote, 'taxes are the price we pay for a civilized society.'\\" In response to a question as to what to recommend to the incoming president regarding a fair and sustainable income and wealth distribution, Reich said: \\"Expand the Earned Income Tax Credit‚Äîa wage supplement for lower-income people, and finance it with a higher marginal income tax on the top five percent. For the longer term, invest in education for lower income communities, starting with early- childhood education and extending all the way up to better access to post- secondary education.\\" Reich is pro-union, saying: \\"Unionization is not just good for workers in unions, unionization is very, very important for the economy overall, and would create broad benefits for the United States.\\" He also favors raising the federal minimum wage to $15/hr across three years, believing that it will not adversely impact big business, and will increase higher value worker availability. Reich also supports an unconditional and universal basic income. On the eve of a June 2016 popular vote in Switzerland on basic income, he declared that countries will have to introduce this instrument sooner or later. While affordable housing is one of his major talking points, in July 2020 Reich opposed a high-density development project in his own neighborhood in Berkeley. He supported making a 120 year old triplex a landmark to prevent the construction of a 10-apartment building, one of which would be deed restricted to be rented to a low income tenant, citing \\"the character of the neighborhood\\". During an interview with W. Kamau Bell the following month, Reich reaffirmed his support for affordable housing \\"in every community I've been involved in,\\" and critiqued the development for replacing the house with \\"condos selling for one and a half million dollars each.\\" A supporter of Israel, Reich has criticized Israel's settlement building in the occupied Palestinian territories.  Social media  In 2013, with Jacob Kornbluth, Reich founded Inequality Media, which produces videos, live interviews on Facebook, portions of his undergraduate class at Berkeley, and long-form videos. The purpose is to educate the public about the implications of the widening inequalities of income, wealth, and political power. Reich and Kornbluth have produced more than 90 videos of two minutes each about the economy and current events, that have been watched by more than 50 million people. Fed? Reich explaining the Federal Reserve Since shortly after the 2017 inauguration Reich began producing a \\"Resistance Report\\" program, offering contextual analysis of latest White House and Cabinet activities, typically a 15- to 30-minute presentation, available on social media sites such as Facebook and YouTube. In late January 2020, Reich and Inequality Media launched a new YouTube weekly talk show called The Common Good.  Personal life  Reich married British-born lawyer Clare Dalton in 1973, and they have two sons, Sam, an American producer, director, writer, actor, and performer, and Adam, a sociology professor at Columbia University. The couple divorced in 2012. In 2020, the City of Berkeley Landmarks Preservation Commission published letters that he had written to them with regards to a housing project being constructed near his home.

It was one of the UK's earliest ISPs, offering dial-up Internet access services from 1 June 1992. In 1997 Demon was bought by Scottish Telecom, a wholly owned subsidiary of the private utility company Scottish Power. Scottish Telecom rebranded as Thus plc in October 1999 and floated on the London Stock Exchange. Thus plc fully demerged from Scottish Power in 2002. Thus became part of Cable & Wireless plc, and then part of Cable & Wireless Worldwide following a split of its parent. The company was purchased as part of the acquisition of Cable & Wireless Worldwide by Vodafone Group on 27 July 2012. Demon then operated as a brand of Vodafone. From 1996 to 2006 Demon operated a subsidiary ISP business in the Netherlands. It was sold to KPN in June 2006 and its operations transferred to their XS4ALL subsidiary.XS4ALL company news item In January 2019, Vodafone announced its intention to close Demon and migrate its 15,000 remaining customers to more modern services. History A setup floppy for the Amiga OS for April 1995. Demon Internet was born out of Demon Systems, a bespoke business software development company formed by Cliff Stanford, Grahame Davies and Owen Manderfield. In a discussion of the need for a home- oriented dialup IP service on the CIX boards, Stanford suggested that if 200 people stepped up with a year's subscription, he would use Demon's infrastructure to create such a service. Dismissing the idea that the Demon name might upset those with religious convictions, Cliff Stanford laughingly said he had considered getting the numbers \\"666\\" incorporated in the dial up. The original Demon service was hosted using mainly Apricot servers including a gigantic pair of LSI towers named \\"gate\\" and \\"post\\". When Demon started, WinSock was still a new concept that was not widely available and MS-DOS users were generally expected to download Internet connection software based on the KA9Q implementation of TCP/IP. Other platforms able to connect to the service included OS/2 Warp, Amiga, Archimedes, Atari, Linux and Mac. In 1995 the company acquired Chris Hall and Richard Clayton's Turnpike suite for Windows. Its first service was the \\"standard dial-up\\" (SDU) - full TCP/IP access on a static IP address with a user chosen 4 to 8 character \\"nodename\\" (later 3-16 character \\"hostname\\") in the .demon.co.uk domain e.g. example.demon.co.uk. This allowed users to receive SMTP mail and other IP traffic direct to their computers. It was possible to operate independently of Demon or to make use of Demon's mail, news and IRC servers. Demon was the first ISP to pioneer SDU service priced at ¬£10 a month plus VAT (¬£10 only for the founder members), described in the sales literature as a \\"tenner a month\\". The low price attracted enough new customers that it was profitable and served to expand Internet usage in the UK. Demon Internet received a healthy boost in user numbers when the UK Internet Book, written by pioneering internet writer Sue Schofield, negotiated with Demon to include a discount coupon in the book for newcomers to Demon. The book needed a change to Demon's mail systems. Schofield demanded and got a POP3 mail option added to the Demon service. The book sold 15,000 copies of the first print run, many readers subscribing to Demon. Thanks to Demon Systems, Demon Internet always had a strong programming team allowing it to create solutions to emerging issues in-house. All three directors were programmers and Stanford wrote many business-critical pieces of software, writing modules to adapt MMDF to Demon's purposes. Mark Turner, originally one of Demon System's developers, wrote many of the accounts and operational systems. As Stanford was increasingly absorbed with corporate activities, Neil McRae eventually took over the work on the mail system. Oliver Smith moved from Systems to Internet to automate services for internal and corporate customers, establish Demon as a technical leader in industry forums such as the RIPE, DNS registry communities, e.g. .uk, and emerging open-source development communities etc. Later Peter Galbavy was brought in to develop solutions for interoperability issues and Ronald Khoo developed low-level networking solutions that allowed the company to run on free operating systems and PC-based hardware. Many other key Demon people started out as developers ‚Äì Giles Todd, Clive Feather, Richard Clayton. Armed with so many developers, many of whom made names for themselves within the developing industry, Stanford used the company's ability to contribute its developments to the Open Source community as a means of developing Demon's reputation beyond what its Internet service commanded. Demon's home-dialup focus was also its Achilles heel. The company had some exposure after sponsoring Fulham F.C., but British Telecom were sceptical of Demon's projected growth and did not provide for expansion, resulting in a regular shortage of lines and regular redigs of the top end of Hendon Lane, Finchley, north London to lay down additional cables. Demon moved initially to Energis lines with a Regionally Organised Modem Pool (ROMP) and later added Colt lines to the service so they had more control over which lines new customers used over separate 0845 numbers. In 1995, Demon acquired a 25% stake in competing UK Internet provider Cityscape Internet Services, as part of a deal to move Cityscape's backbone from Pipex to Demon.\\"CITYSCAPE DROPS PIPEX FOR DEMON DEAL\\" Retrieved 15 March 2014 On 29 September, they acquired the remaining 75% of the company.\\"Demon Internet Limited stock issue values Demon at 26.7 million pounds\\" Retrieved 6 June 2011 Demon's early days are described in an interview with Cliff Stanford published in The Independent on 15 January 1996.\\"Even a millionaire has his demons\\" Retrieved 6 June 2011 The public telephone number of the company, and many of the dialup access numbers, end with 666 (the supposed Number of the Beast), a deliberate pun on the name Demon. When Thus plc was formed as a parent of Demon, its randomly allocated company number also ended in 666. Also, after a spate of \\"access\\" related names (e.g. gate, post) many of its original servers' hostnames started with dis, being the initial letters of Demon Internet Services as well as the name of a part of Hell in Dante's Inferno and another name for Lucifer. Ownership In June 2008 Cable & Wireless plc made a predatory offer for Demon's parent, Thus. On 1 October 2008, Cable & Wireless completed the takeover of Thus. Cable & Wireless split into two separate businesses on 26 March 2010. Thus and Demon came under the ownership of the original business, which was renamed Cable & Wireless Worldwide. This was purchased by Vodafone in July 2012 which began integrating the business with its own. Thus and Demon were integrated into Vodafone on 1 April 2013. During 2016‚Äì2019, the Demon Internet service was slowly wound down with a view to migrating customers over to Vodafone branded products, a process that took longer than expected with some customers still being provided with Demon ADSL at the end of May 2019 due to a large backlog in the processing of migration requests. IRC servers Demon has run IRC servers on both the IRCnet and EFnet networks since 1993 and QuakeNet later. In 2009, Demon delinked their server from QuakeNet and EFnet.

He committed suicide on 23 July 1942 by swallowing a cyanide pill, a day after the commencement of mass extermination of Jews known as the Grossaktion Warsaw.Israel Gutman, Resistance. Houghton Mifflin. p. 200.Gutman, Resistance, p. 203.  Life and career  Czerniak√≥w was born on 30 November 1880 in Warsaw, Poland (then part of the Russian Partition). He studied engineering in Warsaw and Dresden and taught in the Jewish community's vocational school in Warsaw. From 1927 to 1934 he served as member of the Warsaw Municipal Council, and in May 1930 was elected to the Polish Senate.Marcin Urynowicz, Adam Czerniak√≥w 1880-1942. Prezes Getta Warszawskiego, Instytut Pamiƒôci Narodowej, Warszawa 2009, p. 138 On 4 October 1939, a few days after Warsaw surrendered to Nazi Germany, Czerniak√≥w was made head of the 24 member Jewish Council (Judenrat), responsible for implementing German orders in the new Jewish Ghetto. The Warsaw Ghetto was closed to the outside world on November 15, 1940.Czerniak√≥w's Biography, at www.diapozytyw.pl =The Warsaw Ghetto deportations= 184x184px Czerniak√≥w's diary As the German authorities began preparing for mass deportations of Jews from the Warsaw Ghetto to the newly built Treblinka extermination camp in July 1942, the Jewish Council was ordered to provide lists of Jews and maps of their residences. On 22 July 1942, the Judenrat received instructions from the SS that all Warsaw Jews were to be \\"resettled\\" to the East. Exceptions were made for Jews working in Nazi German factories, Jewish hospital staff, members of the Council and the Jewish Ghetto Police with their families. Over the course of the day Czerniak√≥w obtained exemptions for a handful of individuals, including sanitation workers, husbands of women working in factories, and some vocational students. Despite pleading he was unable to obtain an exemption for the children in Janusz Korczak's orphanage or other ghetto orphanages. The orders stated that deportations would begin immediately at the rate of 6,000 people per day, to be supplied by the Jewish Council and the Ghetto Police. Failure would result in the execution of 100 hostages, including Council employees and Czerniak√≥w's wife. Jewish council building at 26/28 Grzybowska Street, Warsaw where Czerniak√≥w committed suicide on 23 July 1942 Realizing that deportation meant death, Czerniak√≥w went to plead for the orphans. When he failed, he returned to his office at 26/28 Grzybowska Street and killed himself by taking a cyanide capsule. He left a suicide note to his wife, reading ‚ÄúThey demand me to kill children of my nation with my own hands. I have nothing to do but to die,‚Äù and one to his fellow members of the Council, explaining: \\"I can no longer bear all this. My act will prove to everyone what is the right thing to do.\\" He was succeeded by his deputy Marek Lichtenbaum. =Diary of Adam Czerniak√≥w= Czerniak√≥w kept a diary from 6 September 1939 until the day of his death. It was published in 1979 and has been translated into English. His wife, Niunia (dr Felicja Czerniak√≥wa), survived the war and preserved his diaries; their only son, Ja≈õ (Jan), fled to Soviet territory but did not survive the war. Adam Czerniak√≥w is interred in the Okopowa Street Jewish Cemetery in Warsaw.Okopowa street cemetery in Warsaw Adam Czerniak√≥w's and his wife's grave at Jewish Cemetery in Warsaw In the 2001 Warner Bros motion picture, Uprising, actor Donald Sutherland portrayed Adam Czerniak√≥w. Excerpts of his diary are featured in the 2010 documentary film A Film Unfinished. The theatre company Voices of the Holocaust toured England during 2013-14 with the play Fragile Fire based on the Warsaw Ghetto uprising which featured scenes depicting Czerniak√≥w. In 2015 the actor and writer Tim Dalgleish (formerly of Voices of the Holocaust) wrote a full-length play based on Czerniak√≥w's journals called The Last Days of Adam: The true story of Adam Czerniak√≥w. The play depicted Czerniak√≥w as a conflicted character, torn between the need to ameliorate the worst excesses of the Nazis and the danger of being manipulated into becoming a collaborator. American composer Arnold Rosner's From the Diaries of Adam Czerniak√≥w, Op. 82 is a half-hour classical music work composed in 1986 and scored for full orchestra and a narrator, who reads selected diary entries. The work was commissioned and later recorded by the conductor David Amos. According to the work's only commercial recording, made in 2015, the English translation of Czerniak√≥w's words was made by Raul Hilberg and Stanislaw Staron, in collaboration with Josef Kermisz of Yad Vashem in Jerusalem.

It consists of a handle and a U-shaped metal frame, made of brass or bronze and between 30 and 76 cm in width. When shaken, the small rings or loops of thin metal on its movable crossbars produce a sound that can be from a soft clank to a loud jangling. Its name in the ancient Egyptian language was sekhem (s·∏´m) and sesheshet (s≈°≈°t). Sekhem is the simpler, hoop-like sistrum, while sesheshet (an onomatopoeic word) is the naos-shaped one. The modern day West African disc rattle instrument is also called a sistrum.Smithsonian National Museum of African Art https://africa.si.edu/collections, search for sistrum The Egyptian sistrum Nefertari, wife of Ramesses II, holding a sistrum The sistrum was a sacred instrument in ancient Egypt. Perhaps originating in the worship of Bat, it was used in dances and religious ceremonies, particularly in the worship of the goddess Hathor, with the U-shape of the sistrum's handle and frame seen as resembling the face and horns of the cow goddess. It also was shaken to avert the flooding of the Nile and to frighten away Set. Isis in her role as mother and creator was depicted holding a pail, symbolizing the flooding of the Nile, in one hand and a sistrum in the other. The goddess Bast often is depicted holding a sistrum also, with it symbolizing her role as a goddess of dance, joy, and festivity. Sistra are still used in the Alexandrian Rite and Ethiopic Rite. Besides the depiction in Egyptian art with dancing and expressions of joy, the sistrum was also mentioned in Egyptian literature.The Instruction of Amenemope in The hieroglyph for the sistrum is shown. The Minoan sistrum The ancient Minoans also used the sistrum, and a number of examples made of local clay have been found on the island of Crete. Five of these are displayed at the Archaeological Museum of Agios Nikolaos. A sistrum is also depicted on the Harvester Vase, an artifact found at the site of Hagia Triada. Researchers are not sure yet if the clay sistra were actual instruments that were used to provide music, or instead were models with only symbolic significance. But, experiments with a ceramic replica show that a satisfactory clacking sound is produced by such a design in clay, so a use in rituals is probably to be preferred.Philip P. Betancourt, Costis Davaras, and Eleni Stravopodi, \\"Excavations in the Hagios Charlambos Cave: A Preliminary Report\\", Hesperia 77 (2008): 539‚Äì605. The sistrum today The sistrum has remained a liturgical instrument in the Ethiopian Orthodox Church throughout the centuries and is played during the dance performed by the debtera (cantors) on important church festivals. It is also occasionally found in Neopagan worship & ritual. The sistrum was occasionally revived in nineteenth century Western orchestral music, appearing most prominently in Act 1 of the opera Les Troyens (1856‚Äì1858) by the French composer Hector Berlioz. Nowadays, however, it is replaced by its close modern equivalent, the tambourine. The effect produced by the sistrum in music ‚Äì when shaken in short, sharp, rhythmic pulses ‚Äì is to arouse movement and activity. The rhythmical shaking of the sistrum, like the tambourine, is associated with religious or ecstatic events, whether shaken as a sacred rattle in the worship of Hathor of ancient Egypt, or, in the strident jangling of the tambourine in modern-day Evangelicalism, in Romani song and dance, on stage at a rock concert, or to heighten a large-scale orchestral tutti. =West Africa= Various modern West African and Gabon rattle instruments are also called sistra (plural of sistrum): the calabash sistrum, the West Africa sistrum or disc rattle (n'goso m'bara) also called Wasamba or Wassahouba rattle. It typically consists of a V-shaped branch with some or many concave calabash discs attached, which can be decorated.Mus√©e virtuel Canada museevirtuel.ca/edu Calabash Sistra, Gabon Gallery Broken Sistrum (1890) - TIMEA.jpgBroken Egyptian Sistrum C+B-Music- Fig5-EgyptianSistrum.PNGEgyptian Sistrum Louvres-antiquites- egyptiennes-p1010937.jpgCollection of sistrums at the Louvre Egyptian - Naos- sistrum - Walters 48465 (2).jpgA Saite naos-shaped \\"sesheshet\\" sistrum.

Founded in 1983 by Frank and Sylvia Thornley, it began as a FidoNet bulletin board system, but in 1987 was relaunched commercially as CIX. At the core of the service were many thousands of \\"conferences\\" - groups established by users to discuss particular topics, conceptually not unlike newsgroups but limited to CIX subscribers (who sometimes describe themselves as 'Cixen'). These conferences still exist today although the CIX service has since expanded to include many other features. The service is funded by a monthly subscription charge rather than by advertising. In 1988 it provided the first commercial Internet email and Usenet access in the UK. CIX then grew rapidly, reaching a peak of more than 16,000 users in 1994, before starting to lose customers to the newly formed Internet service providers that offered free access to the mass market using 0845 dial-up, such as Demon (which was started by Cixen Cliff Stanford, whose CIX nickname was 'Demon'), Pipex, AOL and Freeserve. In 2011, it still had almost 9,000 users. In its heyday, CIX was one of the UK's premier online locations for both technical and social interaction. It hosted several official online support areas for companies such as Borland and Novell and counted among its subscribers many of the UK's technology journalists (some of them wooed with free accounts), which ensured regular mention in the computing press. The Liberal Democrats have used CIX as a conferencing system and a branded version of the off-line reader Ameol (A Most Excellent Offline-reader) is provided for their use. Later company history In 1996 the Thornleys decided to expand CIX's services to include full 0845 dialup Internet access known as CIX Internet. However, take up was limited (possibly due to an above-average cost) even though technically it was rated for many years as one of the best internet providers in the UK. In March 1998 a management buy-in backed by Legal & General Ventures was successful. The buy-in team, none of whom were previously employed at CIX, comprised Doug Birtley, Managing Director; Niels Gotfredsen, Finance Director; Graham Davies, Sales and Marketing Director and Lisa Pennington. Frank and Sylvia Thornley contracted to remain with the company for a minimum of three years. In 2000 CIX was sold to Telenor, a Norwegian telecommunications company. CIX was re- branded and merged with XTML of Manchester and Norsk Data of Newbury to form the UK arm of Nextra, the UK Internet subsidiary of Telenor. In June 2002 the CIX service was outsourced by Telenor to Parkglobe, a company specially set up for the purpose by several long-term CIX staffers and directors, Graham Davies, Charlie Brook and Mat Sims. In July 2002 Telenor sold the business to GX Networks aka PIPEX. In February 2001 CIX WCS (Web Conferencing System) was released as beta to a select group then made public beta in May 2001. In 2004 CIX Conferencing was made accessible via a new service CIX Online by CIX Online Ltd, giving a Web interface as an alternative to the text interface. Customer acceptance of the web interface was limited compared to the OLRs (Off Line Readers - this allowed the upload and download of new messages with messages editing performed off-line) that most Cixen use. In April 2007 the first prototype of the CIX Forums website was launched by CIX Online Ltd. This new online way to access the content is designed to attract more users. In September 2008 Graham Davies of CIX Online Ltd. announced that the API behind CIX Forums would be available in October 2008 allowing interested parties to create additional user add-ons. On 25 May 2011, CIX Online Ltd. was purchased by ICUK, an ISP, hosting and telecoms provider formed in November 2001 by an ex-employee of Compulink Information eXchange Ltd. ICUK in its press release has said it intends to grow and expand CIX Conferencing for new and existing users of both companies. In April 2012, version 2 of CIX Forums was released. Version 2 contained numerous bug fixes, enhancements, speed optimisations and an improved user interface. July 2012 brought version 3 of CIX Forums, featuring further design improvements and a new notification system, allowing users to receive instant replies to messages posted. Technical information CIX Conferencing is based on the CoSy Conferencing System, though it has been heavily modified by generations of staff to add new features. The CoSy conferencing system used by CIX was initially run on a UNIX server. (This was initially the same CoSy code-base on which BIX, the US-centric Byte Information eXchange, was based.) At first, users read the text-based (ISO 8859-1) CIX messages online, but the UK's practice of charging per minute for telephone calls led to the development of off-line readers (OLRs). The first CIX OLR was TelePathy (DOS-based), which developed into the first Windows OLR - WigWam (now an open-source project, under the name Virtual Access). The first official Windows OLR for CIX was called Ameol, from A Most Excellent Off-Line Reader. This handled email, CIX conferencing and Usenet, and is still freely available. It was written independently by Steve Palmer in 1994. The official desktop client is now CIXReader and runs on Windows XP or later and is freely available to all subscribers. Many other OLRs, written by CIX users, are also available for other operating systems, such as Nicola on the Amiga, and Polar for Psion PDAs. Augur is an Open Source OLR designed for CIX. In 1996, it was decided to port the system to Sun hardware, and upgrade the bank of modems. ISDN dial up access, and ability to use the Internet to blink (a term used to collect messages) were also introduced. Example conferences Some of the busiest conferences on CIX are enquire_within (general discussion), bikers, windows_xp (support for, and discussion of, Windows XP), windows_vista, digital_tv, philology (words and their derivations), cultmedia, mac (support for, and discussion of, Apple computers and macOS), Amiga (discussion of the 68k/PPC Amiga platforms), carp (the Campaign for Real Pedantry - discussion of any fine points of detail, often concentrating on the use and abuse of the English language), internet, own.business, gussets_live! and gps (Global Positioning System). Another busy conference is sasha_lubetkin, a conference for a much loved member of the system with the same name.

He was leader of the Liberal Party from 1996 to 2010. He was a member of the Storting from 1993 to 2009, and a government minister from 1997 to 2000 and from 2001 to 2005. He is the current County Governor of Vestland, having served as the County Governor of Hordaland from 2010 until the office was merged with that of neighboring Sogn og Fjordane in 2019. Sponheim was born in Halden, √òstfold. In 1981 he achieved a degree in agricultural science at the Agricultural University of Norway. From 1988 to 1991, he was mayor of his home municipality, Ulvik in Hordaland. He is also a farmer, and with his family he runs the ancestral farm, Sponheim, in Ulvik. He was elected to parliament as the Liberal Party's only representative in the 1993 election. During his campaign he pledged that he would walk from his home in Ulvik to Oslo if elected, which he did. During his first term in parliament he tried to carve a place in Norwegian politics for the Liberal Party, who had been out of parliament since the 1985 election, and to make the party a potential partner in a new non-socialist government. In this he succeeded in the 1997 elections when the Liberal Party gained 5 new seats in parliament and became junior partner in the centrist first cabinet of Kjell Magne Bondevik. Sponheim became party leader in 1996, succeeding Odd Einar D√∏rum, before stepping down in 2010. He is the longest serving leader in the party's history. In the first cabinet of Bondevik, from October 1997 to March 2000, Sponheim was Minister of Trade and Industry. His main project in this position was to reduce the number of laws and regulations restricting business, especially small business. In the second Bondevik cabinet, from October 2001 to October 2005, he was Minister of Agriculture and Food. He used this position to promote Norwegian food in general and local agricultural specialties in particular, and to implement reforms aimed at making Norwegian agriculture more competitive. He also gained much publicity for criticizing Norwegians traveling to Sweden in order to buy cheaper food, calling it \\"Harry\\". Sponheim was elected to a fourth consecutive term in the Storting in the 2005 election. In the 2009 election, the Liberal Party suffered a major defeat and lost eight out of their ten seats in parliament, including Sponheim's seat in Hordaland. Following this defeat, Sponheim announced on the election night that he would resign as party leader when the Liberal Party convenes in the spring 2010. On 19 March 2010, it was announced that Sponheim would become the new County Governor of Hordaland, replacing the retiring Svein Alsaker. As county governor, Sponheim came into a dispute with the Bergen city government when he agreed with the opposition that the 2011 budget for Bergen illegally considered extraordinary dividend from BKK as regular income, and not as income which must be used for investments.

Some species of box jellyfish produce extremely potent venom: Chironex fleckeri, Carukia barnesi and Malo kingi. Stings from these and a few other species in the class are extremely painful and can be fatal to humans.  Taxonomy and systematics  At least 51 species of box jellyfish were known as of 2018. These are grouped into two orders and eight families. A few new species have since been described, and it is likely that additional undescribed species remain. Class Cubozoa * Order Carybdeida ** Family Alatinidae ** Family Carukiidae ** Family Carybdeidae ** Family Tamoyidae ** Family Tripedaliidae * Order Chirodropida ** Family Chirodropidae ** Family Chiropsalmidae ** Family Chiropsellidae  Description  \\"Cubomedusae\\", from Ernst Haeckel's Kunstformen der Natur, 1904 The medusa form of a box jellyfish has a squarish, box-like bell, from which its name is derived. From each of the four lower corners of this hangs a short pedalium or stalk which bears one or more long, slender, hollow tentacles. The rim of the bell is folded inwards to form a shelf known as a velarium which restricts the bell's aperture and creates a powerful jet when the bell pulsates. As a result, box jellyfish can move more rapidly than other jellyfish; speeds of up to per minute have been recorded. In the center of the underside of the bell is a mobile appendage called the manubrium which somewhat resembles an elephant's trunk. At its tip is the mouth. The interior of the bell is known as the gastrovascular cavity. It is divided by four equidistant septa into a central stomach and four gastric pockets. The eight gonads are located in pairs on either side of the four septa. The margins of the septa bear bundles of small gastric filaments which house nematocysts and digestive glands and help to subdue prey. Each septum is extended into a septal funnel that opens onto the oral surface and facilitates the flow of fluid into and out of the animal. The box jellyfish's nervous system is more developed than that of many other jellyfish. They possess a nerve ring around the base of the bell that coordinates their pulsing movements, a feature found elsewhere only in the crown jellyfish. Whereas some other jellyfish have simple pigment-cup ocelli, box jellyfish are unique in the possession of true eyes, complete with retinas, corneas and lenses. Their eyes are set in clusters called rhopalia, located in pockets halfway up the outer, flat surfaces of the bell. Each contains two rhopalial ocelli with lenses, one directed upwards and the other downwards and inwards towards the manubrium. This enables the animal to see specific points of light, as opposed to simply distinguishing between light and dark. Box jellyfish also have twenty ocelli (simple eyes) that do not form images, but detect light and dark; they therefore have a total of twenty-four eyes. Near the rhopalia are statoliths which detect gravitational pull and help the animal to orient itself. Box jellyfish also display complex, probably visually-guided behaviors such as obstacle avoidance and fast directional swimming. Research indicates that, owing to the number of rhopalial nerve cells and their overall arrangement, visual processing and integration at least partly happen within the rhopalia of box jellyfish. The complex nervous system supports a relatively advanced sensory system compared to other jellyfish, and box jellyfish have been described as having an active, fish- like behavior. A fully grown box jellyfish can measure up to along each box side ( in diameter), and the tentacles can grow up to in length. Its weight can reach . There are about 15 tentacles on each corner. Each tentacle has about 500,000 cnidocytes, containing nematocysts, a harpoon-shaped microscopic mechanism that injects venom into the victim. Many different kinds of nematocysts are found in cubozoans.  Distribution  Although the notoriously dangerous species of box jellyfish are largely restricted to the tropical Indo-Pacific region, various species of box jellyfish can be found widely in tropical and subtropical oceans, including the Atlantic Ocean and the east Pacific Ocean, with species as far north as California (Carybdea confusa), the Mediterranean Sea (Carybdea marsupialis) and Japan (such as Chironex yamaguchii), and as far south as South Africa (for example, Carybdea branchi) and New Zealand (such as Copula sivickisi). There are three known species in Hawaiian waters, all from the genus Carybdea: C. alata, C. rastoni, and C. sivickisi.  Ecology  = Age and growth = It has been found that the statoliths, which are composed of calcium sulfate hemihydrate, exhibit clear sequential incremental layers, thought to be laid down on a daily basis. This has enabled researchers to estimate growth rates, ages, and age to maturity. Chironex fleckeri, for example, increases its inter-pedalia distance (IPD) by per day, reaching an IPD of when 45 to 50 days old. The maximum age of any individual examined was 88 days by which time it had grown to an IPD of . = Behavior = The box jellyfish actively hunts its prey (small fish), rather than drifting as do true jellyfish. They are capable of achieving speeds of up to 1.5 to 2 metres per second or about . The venom of cubozoans is distinct from that of scyphozoans, and is used to catch prey (small fish and invertebrates, including prawns and bait fish) and for defence from predators, which include the butterfish, batfish, rabbitfish, crabs (blue swimmer crab) and various species of turtle including the hawksbill sea turtle and flatback sea turtle. It seems that sea turtles are unaffected by the stings because they seem to relish box jellyfish.  Danger to humans  Box jellyfish warning signpost at a Cape Tribulation beach in Queensland, Australia Jellyfish/stinger net exclosure at Ellis Beach, Queensland, Australia Although the box jellyfish has been called \\"the world's most venomous creature\\", only a few species in the class have been confirmed to be involved in human deaths, and some species pose no serious threat at all. In Australia, fatalities are most often caused by the largest species of this class of jellyfish, Chironex fleckeri. Researchers at the University of Hawaii's Department of Tropical Medicine found the venom causes cells to become porous enough to allow potassium leakage, causing hyperkalemia, which can lead to cardiovascular collapse and death as quickly as within 2 to 5 minutes. It was postulated that a zinc compound may be developed as an antidote. In Australia, C. fleckeri has caused at least 64 deaths since the first report in 1883, but even in this species most encounters appear to result only in mild envenoming. Most recent deaths in Australia have been in children, which is linked to their smaller body mass. In parts of the Malay Archipelago, the number of lethal cases is far higher (in the Philippines alone, an estimated 20-40 die annually from Chirodropid stings), probably owing to limited access to medical facilities and antivenom, and the fact that many Australian beaches are enclosed in nets and have vinegar placed in prominent positions allowing for rapid first aid. Vinegar is also used as treatment by locals in the Philippines. A vinegar post in Queensland, Australia The recently discovered and very similar Chironex yamaguchii may be equally dangerous, as it has been implicated in several deaths in Japan. It is unclear which of these species is the one usually involved in fatalities in the Malay Archipelago. In 1990, a 4-year-old child died after being stung by Chiropsalmus quadrumanus at Galveston Island in the Gulf of Mexico, and either this species or Chiropsoides buitendijki are considered the likely perpetrators of two deaths in West Malaysia. Warning signs and first aid stations have been erected in Thailand following the death of a 5-year-old French boy in August 2014. A woman died in July 2015 after being stung off Ko Pha Ngan, and another at Lamai Beach at Ko Samui on 6 October 2015. At least two deaths in Australia have been attributed to the thumbnail-sized Irukandji jellyfish. Those who fall victim to these may suffer severe physical and psychological symptoms, known as Irukandji syndrome. Nevertheless, most victims do survive, and out of 62 people treated for Irukandji envenomation in Australia in 1996, almost half could be discharged home with few or no symptoms after 6 hours, and only two remained hospitalized approximately a day after they were stung. In Hawaii, box jellyfish numbers peak approximately seven to ten days after a full moon, when they come near the shore to spawn. Sometimes the influx is so severe that lifeguards have closed infested beaches, such as Hanauma Bay, until the numbers subside. = Protection during swimming or diving = Wearing pantyhose, full body lycra suits, dive skins, or wetsuits is an effective protection against box jellyfish stings. The pantyhose were formerly thought to work because of the length of the box jellyfish's stingers (nematocysts), but it is now known to be related to the way the stinger cells work. The stinging cells on a box jellyfish's tentacles are not triggered by touch, but by chemicals found on skin, which are not present on the hose's outer surface, so the jellyfish's nematocysts do not fire. = First aid for stings = Once a tentacle of the box jellyfish adheres to skin, it pumps nematocysts with venom into the skin, causing the sting and agonizing pain. Flushing with vinegar is used to deactivate undischarged nematocysts to prevent the release of additional venom. A 2014 study reported that vinegar also increased the amount of venom released from already-discharged nematocysts; however, this study has been criticized on methodological grounds. Removal of additional tentacles is usually done with a towel or gloved hand, to prevent secondary stinging. Tentacles can still sting if separated from the bell, or after the creature is dead. Removal of tentacles may cause unfired nematocysts to come into contact with the skin and fire, resulting in a greater degree of envenomation. Although commonly recommended in folklore and even some papers on sting treatment, there is no scientific evidence that urine, ammonia, meat tenderizer, sodium bicarbonate, boric acid, lemon juice, fresh water, steroid cream, alcohol, cold packs, papaya, or hydrogen peroxide will disable further stinging, and these substances may even hasten the release of venom. Heat packs have been proven for moderate pain relief. The use of pressure immobilization bandages, methylated spirits, or vodka is generally not recommended for use on jelly stings. In severe Chironex fleckeri stings cardiac arrest can occur quickly. = Possible antidotes in humans = In 2011, researchers at the University of Hawaii announced that they had developed an effective treatment against the stings of Hawaiian box jellyfish by \\"deconstructing\\" the venom contained in their tentacles.UHMedNow, \\"Angel Yanagihara's box jellyfish venom research leads to sting treatment\\", March 4, 2011 Its effectiveness was demonstrated in the PBS Nova episode \\"Venom: Nature's Killer\\", originally shown on North American television in February 2012.PBS Nova, Venom: Nature's Killer (transcript) Their research found that zinc gluconate prevented the disruption of red blood cells and reduced the toxic effects on the cardiac activity of research mice. In April 2019, a team of researchers at the University of Sydney announced that they had found a possible antidote to Chironex fleckeri venom that would stop pain and skin necrosis if administered within 15 minutes of being stung. The research was the result of work done with CRISPR whole genome editing in which the researchers selectively deactivated skin-cell genes until they were able to identify ATP2B1, a calcium transporting ATPase, as a host factor supporting cytotoxicity. The research showed the therapeutic use of existing drugs targeting cholesterol in mice, although the efficacy of the approach has not yet been demonstrated in humans.

Public sectors include public goods and governmental services such as the military, law enforcement, infrastructure (public roads, bridges, tunnels, water supply, sewers, electrical grids, telecommunications, etc.), public transit, public education, along with health care and those working for the government itself, such as elected officials. The public sector might provide services that a non-payer cannot be excluded from (such as street lighting), services which benefit all of society rather than just the individual who uses the service.\\"public sector\\". Investorwords, WebFinance, Inc. 2016. Public enterprises, or state-owned enterprises, are self-financing commercial enterprises that are under public ownership which provide various private goods and services for sale and usually operate on a commercial basis. Organizations that are not part of the public sector are either a part of the private sector or voluntary sector. The private sector is composed of the economic sectors that are intended to earn a profit for the owners of the enterprise. The voluntary, civic or social sector concerns a diverse array of non-profit organizations emphasizing civil society. Organization The organization of the public sector can take several forms, including: * Direct administration funded through taxation; the delivering organization generally has no specific requirement to meet commercial success criteria, and production decisions are determined by government. * State-owned enterprises; which differ from direct administration in that they have greater management autonomy and operate according to commercial criteria, and production decisions are not generally taken by a government (although goals may be set for them by the government). * Levels of Public sector are organized at three levels: Federal or National, Regional (State or Provincial), and Local (Municipal or County). * Partial outsourcing (of the scale many businesses do, e.g. for IT services) is considered a public sector model. A borderline form is as follows: * Complete outsourcing or contracting out, with a privately owned corporation delivering the entire service on behalf of the government. This may be considered a mixture of private sector operations with public ownership of assets, although in some forms the private sector's control and/or risk is so great that the service may no longer be considered part of the public sector (Barlow et al., 2010). (See the United Kingdom's Private Finance Initiative.) *Public employee unions represent workers.\\"The Center for Responsive Politics.\\" OpenSecrets.org. Center for Responsive Politics, 16 May 2017. Web. 11 June 2017. Since contract negotiations for these workers are dependent on the size of government budgets, this is the one segment of the labor movement that can actually contribute directly to the people with ultimate responsibility for its livelihood. While their giving pattern matches that of other unions, public sector unions also concentrate contributions on members of Congress from both parties who sit on committees that deal with federal budgets and agencies. Criticism Libertarian and Austrian economists have criticized the idea of public sector provision of goods and services as inherently inefficient.Rothbard, M. N. (1961). The fallacy of the ‚Äòpublic sector.‚Äô. The Logic Of Action Two, Application and Criticism from the Austrian School.. Libertarians and anarcho-capitalists have also argued that the system by which the public sector is funded, namely taxation, is itself coercive and unjust.Murray N. Rothbard (May 1998). \\"The Moral Status of Relations to the State\\", chapter 24 of The Ethics of Liberty. Humanities Press 1982, New York University Press 1998. . However, even notable small-government proponents have pushed back on this point of view, citing the ultimate necessity of a public sector for provision of certain services, such as national defense, public works and utilities, and pollution controls.Ellickson, R.

Routes of administration are generally classified by the location at which the substance is applied. Common examples include oral and intravenous administration. Routes can also be classified based on where the target of action is. Action may be topical (local), enteral (system-wide effect, but delivered through the gastrointestinal tract), or parenteral (systemic action, but delivered by routes other than the GI tract). Route of administration and dosage form are aspects of drug delivery. Classification Routes of administration are usually classified by application location (or exposition). The route or course the active substance takes from application location to the location where it has its target effect is usually rather a matter of pharmacokinetics (concerning the processes of uptake, distribution, and elimination of drugs). Exceptions include the transdermal or transmucosal routes, which are still commonly referred to as routes of administration. The location of the target effect of active substances are usually rather a matter of pharmacodynamics (concerning e.g. the physiological effects of drugs). An exception is topical administration, which generally means that both the application location and the effect thereof is local. Topical administration is sometimes defined as both a local application location and local pharmacodynamic effect, and sometimes merely as a local application location regardless of location of the effects.thefreedictionary.com > topical Citing: The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language, Fourth Edition, 2000 =By application location= Enteral/gastrointestinal Administration through the gastrointestinal tract is sometimes termed enteral or enteric administration (literally meaning 'through the intestines'). Enteral/enteric administration usually includes oral (through the mouth) and rectal (into the rectum) administration, in the sense that these are taken up by the intestines. However, uptake of drugs administered orally may also occur already in the stomach, and as such gastrointestinal (along the gastrointestinal tract) may be a more fitting term for this route of administration. Furthermore, some application locations often classified as enteral, such as sublingual (under the tongue) and sublabial or buccal (between the cheek and gums/gingiva), are taken up in the proximal part of the gastrointestinal tract without reaching the intestines. Strictly enteral administration (directly into the intestines) can be used for systemic administration, as well as local (sometimes termed topical), such as in a contrast enema, whereby contrast media is infused into the intestines for imaging. However, for the purposes of classification based on location of effects, the term enteral is reserved for substances with systemic effects. A medical professional injects medication into a gastric tube. Many drugs as tablets, capsules, or drops are taken orally. Administration methods directly into the stomach include those by gastric feeding tube or gastrostomy. Substances may also be placed into the small intestines, as with a duodenal feeding tube and enteral nutrition. Enteric coated tablets are designed to dissolve in the intestine, not the stomach, because the drug present in the tablet causes irritation in the stomach. Administering medication rectally The rectal route is an effective route of administration for many medications, especially those used at the end of life. The walls of the rectum absorb many medications quickly and effectively. Nee, Douglas, Pharm D, MS. \\"Rectal Administration of Medications at the End of Life\\". HPNA Teleconference, December 6, 2006, accessed November 2013. Medications delivered to the distal one-third of the rectum at least partially avoid the \\"first pass effect\\" through the liver, which allows for greater bio-availability of many medications than that of the oral route. Rectal mucosa is highly vascularized tissue that allows for rapid and effective absorption of medications. A suppository is a solid dosage form that fits for rectal administration. In hospice care, a specialized rectal catheter, designed to provide comfortable and discreet administration of ongoing medications provides a practical way to deliver and retain liquid formulations in the distal rectum, giving health practitioners a way to leverage the established benefits of rectal administration. Parenteral Needle insertion angles for 4 types of parenteral administration of medication: intramuscular, subcutaneous, intravenous, and intradermal injection. The parenteral route is any route that is not enteral (par- + enteral). Parenteral administration can be performed by injection, that is, using a needle (usually a hypodermic needle) and a syringe, or by the insertion of an indwelling catheter. Locations of application of parenteral administration include: * central nervous system :* epidural (synonym: peridural) (injection or infusion into the epidural space), e.g. epidural anesthesia :* intracerebral (into the cerebrum) administration by direct injection into the brain. Used in experimental research of chemicals and as a treatment for malignancies of the brain. The intracerebral route can also interrupt the blood brain barrier from holding up against subsequent routes. :* intracerebroventricular (into the cerebral ventricles) administration into the ventricular system of the brain. One use is as a last line of opioid treatment for terminal cancer patients with intractable cancer pain. A transdermal patch which delivers medication is applied to the skin. The patch is labelled with the time and date of administration as well as the administrator's initials. A medical professional applies nose drops. * epicutaneous (application onto the skin). It can be used both for local effect as in allergy testing and typical local anesthesia, as well as systemic effects when the active substance diffuses through skin in a transdermal route. *sublingual and buccal medication administration is a way of giving someone medicine orally (by mouth). Sublingual administration is when medication is placed under the tongue to be absorbed by the body. The word \\"sublingual\\" means \\"under the tongue.\\" Buccal administration involves placement of the drug between the gums and the cheek. These medications can come in the form of tablets, films, or sprays. Many drugs are designed for sublingual administration, including cardiovascular drugs, steroids, barbiturates, opioid analgesics with poor gastrointestinal bioavailability, enzymes and, increasingly, vitamins and minerals. * extra-amniotic administration, between the endometrium and fetal membranes * nasal administration (through the nose) can be used for topically acting substances, as well as for insufflation of e.g. decongestant nasal sprays to be taken up along the respiratory tract. Such substances are also called inhalational, e.g. inhalational anesthetics. * intra-arterial (into an artery), e.g. vasodilator drugs in the treatment of vasospasm and thrombolytic drugs for treatment of embolism * intra-articular, into a joint space. It is generally performed by joint injection. It is mainly used for symptomatic relief in osteoarthritis. * intracardiac (into the heart), e.g. adrenaline during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (no longer commonly performed) * intracavernous injection, an injection into the base of the penis * intradermal, (into the skin itself) is used for skin testing some allergens, and also for mantoux test for tuberculosis * intralesional (into a skin lesion), is used for local skin lesions, e.g. acne medication * intramuscular (into a muscle), e.g. many vaccines, antibiotics, and long-term psychoactive agents. Recreationally the colloquial term 'muscling' is used. Intraocular administration * intraocular, into the eye, e.g., some medications for glaucoma or eye neoplasms * intraosseous infusion (into the bone marrow) is, in effect, an indirect intravenous access because the bone marrow drains directly into the venous system. This route is occasionally used for drugs and fluids in emergency medicine and pediatrics when intravenous access is difficult. * intraperitoneal, (infusion or injection into the peritoneum) e.g. peritoneal dialysis * intrathecal (into the spinal canal) is most commonly used for spinal anesthesia and chemotherapy * Intrauterine * intravaginal administration, in the vagina * intravenous (into a vein), e.g. many drugs, total parenteral nutrition * Intravesical infusion is into the urinary bladder. * intravitreal, through the eye * Subcutaneous (under the skin). This generally takes the form of subcutaneous injection, e.g. with insulin. Skin popping is a slang term that includes subcutaneous injection, and is usually used in association with recreational drugs. In addition to injection, it is also possible to slowly infuse fluids subcutaneously in the form of hypodermoclysis. * transdermal (diffusion through the intact skin for systemic rather than topical distribution), e.g. transdermal patches such as fentanyl in pain therapy, nicotine patches for treatment of addiction and nitroglycerine for treatment of angina pectoris. * perivascular administration (perivascular medical devices and perivascular drug delivery systems are conceived for local application around a blood vessel during open vascular surgery). * transmucosal (diffusion through a mucous membrane), e.g. insufflation (snorting) of cocaine, sublingual, i.e. under the tongue, sublabial, i.e. between the lips and gingiva, nitroglycerine, vaginal suppositories. =Topical= The definition of the topical route of administration sometimes states that both the application location and the pharmacodynamic effect thereof is local. In other cases, topical is defined as applied to a localized area of the body or to the surface of a body part regardless of the location of the effect. By this definition, topical administration also includes transdermal application, where the substance is administered onto the skin but is absorbed into the body to attain systemic distribution. If defined strictly as having local effect, the topical route of administration can also include enteral administration of medications that are poorly absorbable by the gastrointestinal tract. One poorly absorbable antibiotic is vancomycin, which is recommended by mouth as a treatment for severe Clostridium difficile colitis.  Choice of routes  The reason for choice of routes of drug administration are governing by various factors: * Physical and chemical properties of the drug. The physical properties are solid, liquid and gas. The chemical properties are solubility, stability, pH, irritancy etc. * Site of desired action: the action may be localised and approachable or generalised and not approachable. * Rate of extent of absorption of the drug from different routes. * Effect of digestive juices and the first pass metabolism of drugs. * Condition of the patient. In acute situations, in emergency medicine and intensive care medicine, drugs are most often given intravenously. This is the most reliable route, as in acutely ill patients the absorption of substances from the tissues and from the digestive tract can often be unpredictable due to altered blood flow or bowel motility. =Convenience= Enteral routes are generally the most convenient for the patient, as no punctures or sterile procedures are necessary. Enteral medications are therefore often preferred in the treatment of chronic disease. However, some drugs can not be used enterally because their absorption in the digestive tract is low or unpredictable. Transdermal administration is a comfortable alternative; there are, however, only a few drug preparations that are suitable for transdermal administration. =Desired target effect= Identical drugs can produce different results depending on the route of administration. For example, some drugs are not significantly absorbed into the bloodstream from the gastrointestinal tract and their action after enteral administration is therefore different from that after parenteral administration. This can be illustrated by the action of naloxone (Narcan), an antagonist of opiates such as morphine. Naloxone counteracts opiate action in the central nervous system when given intravenously and is therefore used in the treatment of opiate overdose. The same drug, when swallowed, acts exclusively on the bowels; it is here used to treat constipation under opiate pain therapy and does not affect the pain-reducing effect of the opiate. =Oral= The oral route is generally the most convenient and costs the least. However, some drugs can cause gastrointestinal tract irritation. For drugs that come in delayed release or time-release formulations, breaking the tablets or capsules can lead to more rapid delivery of the drug than intended. The oral route is limited to formulations containing small molecules only while biopharmaceuticals (usually proteins) would be digested in the stomach and thereby become ineffective. Biopharmaceuticals have to be given by injection or infusion. However, recent research (2018) found an organic ionic liquid suitable for oral insulin delivery (a biopharmaceutical) into the blood stream. Oral administration is often denoted \\"PO\\" from \\"per os\\", the Latin for \\"by mouth\\". The bioavailability of oral administration is affected by the amount of drug that is absorbed across the intestinal epithelium and first- pass metabolism. =Local= By delivering drugs almost directly to the site of action, the risk of systemic side effects is reduced. Skin absorption (dermal absorption), for example, is to directly deliver drug to the skin and, hopefully, to the systemic circulation. However, skin irritation may result, and for some forms such as creams or lotions, the dosage is difficult to control. Upon contact with the skin, the drug penetrates into the dead stratum corneum and can afterwards reach the viable epidermis, the dermis, and the blood vessels. =Mouth inhalation= A dummy wears a nebulizer mask, used to administer inhaled medications. Diagram for conducting zoneDiagram for respiratory zoneDiagram for upper respiratory tractDiagram for lower respiratory tractDiagram for majour zones of respiratory system Inhaled medications can be absorbed quickly and act both locally and systemically. Proper technique with inhaler devices is necessary to achieve the correct dose. Some medications can have an unpleasant taste or irritate the mouth. In general, only 20‚Äì50% of the pulmonary-delivered dose rendered in powdery particles will be deposited in the lung upon mouth inhalation. The remainder of 50-70% undeposited aerosolized particles are cleared out of lung as soon as exhalation. An inhaled powdery particle that is >8 Œºm is structurally predisposed to depositing in the central and conducting airways (conducting zone) by inertial impaction. An inhaled powdery particle that is between 3 and 8 Œºm in diameter tend to largely deposit in the transitional zones of the lung by sedimentation. An inhaled powdery particle that is <3 Œºm in diameter is structurally predisposed to depositing primarily in the respiratory regions of the peripheral lung via diffusion. Particles that deposit in the upper and central airways are rarely absorbed systemically because they are going to be removed by mucociliary clearance in an efficient and rapid fashion. =Nasal inhalation= Inhalation by smoking a substance is likely the most rapid way to deliver drugs to the brain, as the substance travels directly to the brain without being diluted in the systemic circulation. The severity of dependence on psychoactive drugs tends to increase with more rapid drug delivery. =Parenteral= A peripheral IV placed on the hand. A medical professional performs an intradermal (ID) injection. The term injection encompasses intravenous (IV), intramuscular (IM), subcutaneous (SC) and intradermal (ID) administration. Parenteral administration generally acts more rapidly than topical or enteral administration, with onset of action often occurring in 15‚Äì30 seconds for IV, 10‚Äì20 minutes for IM and 15‚Äì30 minutes for SC. They also have essentially 100% bioavailability and can be used for drugs that are poorly absorbed or ineffective when they are given orally. Some medications, such as certain antipsychotics, can be administered as long-acting intramuscular injections.Stahl SM, Stahl's Essential Psychopharmacology: Neuroscientific basis and practical applications, New York: Cambridge University Press, 2008 Ongoing IV infusions can be used to deliver continuous medication or fluids.Smeltzer SC Bare BG, Textbook of Medical-Surgical Nursing, 9th ed, Philadelphia: Lippincott, 2000. Disadvantages of injections include potential pain or discomfort for the patient and the requirement of trained staff using aseptic techniques for administration. However, in some cases, patients are taught to self-inject, such as SC injection of insulin in patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. As the drug is delivered to the site of action extremely rapidly with IV injection, there is a risk of overdose if the dose has been calculated incorrectly, and there is an increased risk of side effects if the drug is administered too rapidly. =Intranasal= Drug administration via the nasal cavity yields rapid drug absorption and therapeutic effects. This is because drug absorption through the nasal passages doesn't go through the gut before entering capillaries situated at tissue cells and then systemic circulation and such absorption route allows transport of drugs into the central nervous system via the pathways of olfactory and trigeminal nerve. Intranasal absorption features low lipophilicity, enzymatic degradation within the nasal cavity, large molecular size, and rapid mucociliary clearance from the nasal passages, which explains the low risk of systemic exposure of the administered drug absorbed via intranasal. Involved subjects' positions. =Sublingual= Sublingual administration is fulfilled by placing the drug between the tongue and the lower surface of the mouth. The sublingual mucosa is highly permeable and thereby provides access to the underlying expansive network composed of capillaries, leading to rapid drug absorption. =Buccal= Buccally administered a medication is achieved by placing the drug between gums and the inner lining of the cheek. In comparison with sublingual tissue, buccal tissue is less permeable resulting in slower absorption. =Sublabial administration= Sublabial administration Research Neural drug delivery is the next step beyond the basic addition of growth factors to nerve guidance conduits. Drug delivery systems allow the rate of growth factor release to be regulated over time, which is critical for creating an environment more closely representative of in vivo development environments.Lavik, E. and R.

France In the history of art, prehistoric art is all art produced in preliterate, prehistorical cultures beginning somewhere in very late geological history, and generally continuing until that culture either develops writing or other methods of record-keeping, or makes significant contact with another culture that has, and that makes some record of major historical events. At this point ancient art begins, for the older literate cultures. The end-date for what is covered by the term thus varies greatly between different parts of the world.\\"The term \\"prehistoric\\" ceases to be valid some thousands of years B.C. in the Middle East but remains a warranted description down to about 500 A.D. in Ireland\\", Review by \\"A. T. L.\\" of Prehistoric Art by T. G. E. Powell, The Journal of the Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, Vol. 97, No. 1 (1967), p. 95, Royal Society of Antiquaries of Ireland, JSTOR The earliest human artifacts showing evidence of workmanship with an artistic purpose are the subject of some debate. It is clear that such workmanship existed by 40,000 years ago in the Upper Paleolithic era, although it is quite possible that it began earlier. In September 2018, scientists reported the discovery of the earliest known drawing by Homo sapiens, which is estimated to be 73,000 years old, much earlier than the 43,000 years old artifacts understood to be the earliest known modern human drawings found previously. Engraved shells created by Homo erectus dating as far back as 500,000 years ago have been found, although experts disagree on whether these engravings can be properly classified as ‚Äòart‚Äô. From the Upper Paleolithic through to the Mesolithic, cave paintings and portable art such as figurines and beads predominated, with decorative figured workings also seen on some utilitarian objects. In the Neolithic evidence of early pottery appeared, as did sculpture and the construction of megaliths. Early rock art also first appeared during this period. The advent of metalworking in the Bronze Age brought additional media available for use in making art, an increase in stylistic diversity, and the creation of objects that did not have any obvious function other than art. It also saw the development in some areas of artisans, a class of people specializing in the production of art, as well as early writing systems. By the Iron Age, civilizations with writing had arisen from Ancient Egypt to Ancient China. Many indigenous peoples from around the world continued to produce artistic works distinctive to their geographic area and culture, until exploration and commerce brought record-keeping methods to them. Some cultures, notably the Maya civilization, independently developed writing during the time they flourished, which was then later lost. These cultures may be classified as prehistoric, especially if their writing systems have not been deciphered. Paleolithic era =Lower and Middle Paleolithic= Homo Erectus shell with geometric incisions, circa 500,000 BP, has been claimed as the first known work of art. Naturalis Biodiversity Center, Netherlands. Acheulean hand axe. The earliest undisputed art originated with the Homo sapiens Aurignacian archaeological culture in the Upper Paleolithic. However, there is some evidence that the preference for the aesthetic emerged in the Middle Paleolithic, from 100,000 to 50,000 years ago. Some archaeologists have interpreted certain Middle Paleolithic artifacts as early examples of artistic expression.New York TimesThe Metropolitan Museum of New York City Introduction to Prehistoric Art Retrieved 2012-5-12 The symmetry of artifacts, evidence of attention to the detail of tool shape, has led some investigators to conceive of Acheulean hand axes and especially laurel points as having been produced with a degree of artistic expression. Claimed \\"Oldest known drawing by human hands\\", discovered in Blombos Cave in South Africa. Estimated to be 73,000 years old. Similarly, a zig-zag etching made with a shark tooth on a freshwater clam-shell around 500,000 years ago (i.e. well into the Lower Paleolithic), associated with Homo erectus, was proposed as the earliest evidence of artistic activity in 2014. There are other claims of Middle Paleolithic sculpture, dubbed the \\"Venus of Tan-Tan\\" (before 300 kya)Chase, pp. 145-146 and the \\"Venus of Berekhat Ram\\" (250 kya). In 2002 in Blombos cave, situated in South Africa, stones were discovered engraved with grid or cross-hatch patterns, dated to some 70,000 years ago. This suggested to some researchers that early Homo sapiens were capable of abstraction and production of abstract art or symbolic art. Several archaeologists including Richard Klein are hesitant to accept the Blombos caves as the first example of actual art. In September 2018 the discovery in South Africa of the earliest known drawing by Homo sapiens was announced, which is estimated to be 73,000 years old, much earlier than the 43,000 years old artifacts understood to be the earliest known modern human drawings found previously. The drawing shows a crosshatched pattern made up of nine fine lines. The sudden termination of all of the lines on the fragment edges indicate that the pattern originally extended over a larger surface. It is also estimated that the pattern was most likely more complex and structured in its entirety then shown on the discovered area. Initially, when this drawing was found, there was much debate. To prove that this drawing was created by Homo Sapiens, French team members who specialized in chemical analysis of pigments, reproduced the same lines using a variety of techniques. They concluded that the lines making up the drawing were intentional and were most likely made with ocher. This discovery adds further dimensions to understanding the behavior and cognition of early homo sapiens. =Upper Paleolithic= Probably the oldest known painting, from the cave of Lubang Jeriji Sal√©h on the Indonesian island of Borneo, circa 40,000 BC Aurochs on a cave painting in Lascaux, France In November 2018, scientists reported the discovery of the oldest known figurative art painting, over 40,000 (perhaps as old as 52,000) years old, of an unknown animal, in the cave of Lubang Jeriji Sal√©h on the Indonesian island of Borneo. One of the oldest undisputed works of figurative art were found in the Schw√§bische Alb, Baden-W√ºrttemberg, Germany. The earliest of these, the Venus figurine known as the Venus of Hohle Fels and the Lion-man figurine, date to some 40,000 years ago. Venus of Willendorf Further depictional art from the Upper Palaeolithic period (broadly 40,000 to 10,000 years ago) includes cave painting (e.g., those at Chauvet, Altamira, Pech Merle, Arcy- sur-Cure and Lascaux) and portable art: Venus figurines like the Venus of Willendorf, as well as animal carvings like the Swimming Reindeer, Wolverine pendant of Les Eyzies, and several of the objects known as b√¢tons de commandement. Paintings in Pettakere cave on the Indonesian island of Sulawesi are up to 40,000 years old, a similar date to the oldest European cave art, which may suggest an older common origin for this type of art, perhaps in Africa. Monumental open-air art in Europe from this period includes the rock- art at C√¥a Valley and Mazouco in Portugal, Domingo Garc√≠a and Siega Verde in Spain, and in France. A cave at Turobong in South Korea containing human remains has been found to contain carved deer bones and depictions of deer that may be as much as 40,000 years old.Portal, p. 25 Petroglyphs of deer or reindeer found at Sokchang-ri may also date to the Upper Paleolithic. Potsherds in a style reminiscent of early Japanese work have been found at Kosan-ri on Jeju island, which, due to lower sea levels at the time, would have been accessible from Japan.Portal, p. 26 The oldest petroglyphs are dated to approximately the Mesolithic and late Upper Paleolithic boundary, about 10,000 to 12,000 years ago. The earliest undisputed African rock art dates back about 10,000 years. The first naturalistic paintings of humans found in Africa date back about 8,000 years apparently originating in the Nile River valley, spread as far west as Mali about 10,000 years ago. Noted sites containing early art include Tassili n'Ajjer in southern Algeria, Tadrart Acacus in Libya (A Unesco World Heritage site), and the Tibesti Mountains in northern Chad.Coulson, pp. 150‚Äì155 Rock carvings at the Wonderwerk Cave in South Africa have been dated to this age.Thackeray. Contentious dates as far back as 29,000 years have been obtained at a site in Tanzania. A site at the Apollo 11 Cave complex in Namibia has been dated to 27,000 years. G√∂bekli Tepe in Turkey has circles of massive T-shaped stone pillars dating back to the 10th‚Äì8th millennium BCE; the world's oldest known megaliths. Many of the pillars are decorated with abstract, enigmatic pictograms and carved animal reliefs. Asia Dancing Girl of Mohenjo Daro\\", Indus Valley civilization Asia was the cradle for several significant civilizations, most notably those of China and South Asia. The prehistory of eastern Asia is especially interesting, as the relatively early introduction of writing and historical record-keeping in China has a notable impact on the immediately surrounding cultures and geographic areas. Little of the very rich traditions of the art of Mesopotamia counts as prehistoric, as writing was introduced so early there, but neighbouring cultures such as Urartu, Luristan and Persia had significant and complex artistic traditions. A possible representation of a \\"yogi\\" or \\"proto-Shiva\\", 2600‚Äì1900 BCE =Azerbaijan= The Gobustan National Park reserve located at the south-east of the Greater Caucasus Mountains in Azerbaijan, 60 km away from Baku date back more than 12 thousand years ago. The reserve has more than 6,000 rock carvings depicting mostly hunting scenes, human and animal figures. There are also longship illustrations similar to Viking ships. Gobustan is also characterized by its natural musical stone called Gavaldash (tambourine stone). =Indian sub-continent= The earliest Indian paintings were the rock paintings of prehistoric times, the petroglyphs as found in places like the Rock Shelters of Bhimbetka, and some of them are dated to circa 8,000 BC. The Indus Valley civilization produced fine small stamp seals and sculptures, and may have been literate, but after its collapse there are relatively few artistic remains until the literate period, probably as perishable materials were used. =China= Two bronze heads from Sanxingdui, covered with gold leafs Prehistoric artwork such as painted pottery in Neolithic China can be traced back to the Yangshao culture and Longshan culture of the Yellow River valley. During China's Bronze Age, Chinese of the ancient Shang Dynasty and Zhou Dynasty produced multitudes of Chinese ritual bronzes, which are elaborate versions of ordinary vessels and other objects used in rituals of ancestor veneration, decorated with taotie motifs and by the late Shang Chinese bronze inscriptions. Discoveries in 1987 in Sanxingdui in central China revealed a previously unknown pre-literate Bronze Age culture whose artefacts included spectacular very large bronze figures (example left), and which appeared culturally very different from the contemporary late Shang, which has always formed part of the account of the continuous tradition of Chinese culture. =Japan= A J≈çmon statue According to archeological evidence, the J≈çmon people in ancient Japan were among the first to develop pottery, dated from the 11th millennium BCE. With growing sophistication, the J≈çmon created patterns by impressing the wet clay with braided or unbraided cord and sticks. =Korea= A Korean Neolithic pot found in Busan, 3500 BCE The earliest examples of Korean art consist of Stone Age works dating from 3000 BCE. These mainly consist of votive sculptures, although petroglyphs have also been recently rediscovered. Rock arts, elaborate stone tools, and potteries were also prevalent. This early period was followed by the art styles of various Korean kingdoms and dynasties. In these periods, artists often adopted Chinese style in their artworks. However, Koreans not only adopted but also modified Chinese culture with a native preference for simple elegance, purity of nature and spontaneity. This filtering of Chinese styles later influenced Japanese artistic traditions, due to cultural and geographical circumstances. The prehistory of Korean ends with the founding of the Three Kingdoms of Korea, which are documented in the Samguk Sagi, a 12th-century CE text written in Classical Chinese (the written language of the literati in traditional Korea), as beginning in the 1st century BCE; some mention of earlier history is also made in Chinese texts, like the 3rd-century CE Sanguo Zhi. Jeulmun period Clearer evidence of culture emerges in the late Neolithic, known in Korea as the Jeulmun pottery period, with pottery similar to that found in the adjacent regions of China, decorated with Z-shaped patterns. The earliest Neolithic sites with pottery remains, for example Osan-ri, date to 6000‚Äì4500 BCE. This pottery is characterized by comb patterning, with the pot frequently having a pointed base. Ornaments from this time include masks made of shell, with notable finds at Tongsam-dong, Osan-ri, and Sinam-ri. Hand-shaped clay figurines have been found at Nongpo-dong.Portal, p. 27 Mumun period Large Middle Mumun (c. 800 BCE) storage vessel unearthed from a pit-house in or near Daepyeong During the Mumun pottery period, roughly between 1500 BCE and 300 BCE, agriculture expanded, and evidence of larger-scale political structures became apparent, as villages grew and some burials became more elaborate. Megalithic tombs and dolmens throughout Korea date to this time. The pottery of the time is in a distinctive undecorated style. Many of these changes in style may have occurred due to immigration of new peoples from the north, although this is a subject of debate.Portal, p. 29 At a number of sites in southern Korea there are rock art panels that are thought to date from this period, mainly for stylistic reasons.Portal, p. 33 While the exact date of the introduction of bronzework into Korea is also a matter of debate, it is clear that bronze was being worked by about 700 BCE. Finds include stylistically distinctive daggers, mirrors, and belt buckles, with evidence by the 1st century BCE of a widespread, locally distinctive, bronzeworking culture.Portal, pp. 34‚Äì35 Protohistoric Korea Goguryeo tomb mural The time between 300 BCE and the founding and stabilization of the Three Kingdoms around 300 CE is characterized artistically and archaeologically by increasing trade with China and Japan, something that Chinese histories of the time corroborate. The expansionist Chinese invaded and established commanderies in northern Korea as early as the 1st century BCE; they were driven out by the 4th century CE.Portal, p. 38 The remains of some of these, especially that of Lelang, near modern Pyongyang, have yielded many artifacts in a typical Han style.Portal, p. 39 Chinese histories also record the beginnings of iron works in Korea in the 1st century BCE. Stoneware and kiln-fired pottery also appears to date from this time, although there is controversy over the dates.Portal, p. 40 Pottery of distinctly Japanese origin is found in Korea, and metalwork of Korean origin is found in northeastern China.Portal, p. 41 =Steppes Art= Late 7th-century Scythian plaque of a leopard Superb samples of Steppes art - mostly golden jewellery and trappings for horse - are found over a vast expanses of land stretching from Hungary to Mongolia. Dating from the period between the 7th and 3rd centuries BCE, the objects are usually diminutive, as may be expected from nomadic people always on the move. Art of the steppes is primarily an animal art, i.e., combat scenes involving several animals (real or imaginary) or single animal figures (such as golden stags) predominate. The best known of the various peoples involved are the Scythians, at the European end of the steppe, who were especially likely to bury gold items. Among the most famous finds was made in 1947, when the Soviet archaeologist Sergei Rudenko discovered a royal burial at Pazyryk, Altay Mountains, which featured - among many other important objects - the most ancient extant pile rug, probably made in Persia. Unusually for prehistoric burials, those in the northern parts of the area may preserve organic materials such as wood and textiles that normally would decay. Steppes people both gave and took influences from neighbouring cultures from Europe to China, and later Scythian pieces are heavily influenced by ancient Greek style, and probably often made by Greeks in Scythia. Near East Pillar from G√∂bekli Tepe with low reliefs of what are believed to be a bull, fox, and crane, 9600 to 8800 BCE. The Ain Sakhri Lovers from modern Israel, is a small Natufian carving in calcite, from about 9,000 BCE. Around the same time, the extraordinary site of G√∂bekli Tepe in eastern Turkey was begun. During the first phase, belonging to the Pre- Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA), circles of massive but neatly shaped T-shaped stone pillars were erected ‚Äì the world's oldest known megaliths. More than 200 pillars in about 20 circles are currently known through geophysical surveys. Each pillar has a height of up to and weighs up to 10 tons. They are fitted into sockets that were hewn out of the bedrock. In the second phase, belonging to the Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB), the erected pillars are smaller and stood in rectangular rooms with floors of polished lime. On the smoothed surfaces of the pillars there are reliefs of animals, abstract patterns, and some human figures. By convention, prehistory in the Near East is taken to continue until the rise of the Achaemenid Empire in the 6th century BCE, although writing existed in the region from nearly 2,000 years earlier. On that basis the very rich and long tradition of the art of Mesopotamia, as well as Assyrian sculpture, Hittite art and many other traditions such as the Luristan bronzes all fall under prehistoric art, even if covered with texts extolling the ruler, as many Assyrian palace reliefs are. Europe =Stone Age= Hand stencil, Cosquer Cave, France, c. 27,000 years old The Art of the Upper Paleolithic includes carvings on antler and bone, especially of animals, as well as the so-called Venus figurines and cave paintings, discussed above. Despite a warmer climate, the Mesolithic period undoubtedly shows a falling- off from the heights of the preceding period. Rock art is found in Scandinavia and northern Russia, and around the Mediterranean in eastern Spain and the earliest of the Rock Drawings in Valcamonica in northern Italy, but not in between these areas.Sandars, 75-98 Examples of portable art include painted pebbles from the Azilian culture which succeeded the Magdalenian, and patterns on utilitarian objects, like the paddles from Tybrind Vig, Denmark. The Mesolithic statues of Lepenski Vir at the Iron Gate, Serbia date to the 7th millennium BCE and represent either humans or mixtures of humans and fish. Simple pottery began to develop in various places, even in the absence of farming. Mesolithic Compared to the preceding Upper Paleolithic and the following Neolithic, there is rather less surviving art from the Mesolithic. The Rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin, which probably spreads across from the Upper Paleolithic, is a widespread phenomenon, much less well known than the cave-paintings of the Upper Paleolithic, with which it makes an interesting contrast. The sites are now mostly cliff faces in the open air, and the subjects are now mostly human rather than animal, with large groups of small figures; there are 45 figures at Roca dels Moros. Clothing is shown, and scenes of dancing, fighting, hunting and food-gathering. The figures are much smaller than the animals of Paleolithic art, and depicted much more schematically, though often in energetic poses.Sandars, Nancy K., Prehistoric Art in Europe, Penguin (Pelican, now Yale, History of Art), pp. 87-96, 1968 (nb 1st edn.) A few small engraved pendants with suspension holes and simple engraved designs are known, some from northern Europe in amber, and one from Starr Carr in Britain in shale.\\"11,000 year old pendant is earliest known Mesolithic art in Britain\\", University of York The rock art in the Urals appears to show similar changes after the Paleolithic, and the wooden Shigir Idol is a rare survival of what may well have been a very common material for sculpture. It is a plank of larch carved with geometric motifs, but topped with a human head. Now in fragments, it would apparently have been over 5 metres tall when made.

In Central Europe, many Neolithic cultures, like Linearbandkeramic, Lengyel and Vinƒça, produced female (rarely male) and animal statues that can be called art, and elaborate pottery decoration in, for example, the ≈Ωeliesovce and painted Lengyel style. Megalithic (i.e., large stone) monuments are found in the Neolithic Era from Malta to Portugal, through France, and across southern England to most of Wales and Ireland. They are also found in northern Germany and Poland, as well as in Egypt in the Sahara desert (at Nabta Playa and other sites). The best preserved of all temples and the oldest free standing structures are the Megalithic Temples of Malta. They start in the 5th millennium BC, though some authors speculate on Mesolithic roots. One of the best-known prehistoric sites is Stonehenge, part of the Stonehenge World Heritage Site which contains hundreds of monuments and archaeological sites. Monuments have been found throughout most of Western and Northern Europe, notably at Carnac, France. Entrance stone with megalithic art at Newgrange The large mound tomb at Newgrange, Ireland, dating to around 3200 BC, has its entrance marked with a massive stone carved with a complex design of spirals. The mound at nearby Knowth has large flat rocks with rock engravings on their vertical faces all around its circumference, for which various meanings have been suggested, including depictions of the local valley, and the oldest known image of the Moon. Many of these monuments were megalithic tombs, and archaeologists speculate that most have religious significance. Knowth is reputed to have approximately one third of all megalithic art in Western Europe. In the central Alps, the Camunni made some 350,000 petroglyphs: see Rock Drawings in Valcamonica. =Bronze Age= Three men performing a ritual, Bohusl√§n, Sweden During the 3rd millennium BCE, the Bronze Age began in Europe, bringing with it a new medium for art. The increased efficiency of bronze tools also meant an increase in productivity, which led to a surplus ‚Äî the first step in the creation of a class of artisans. Because of the increased wealth of society, luxury goods began to be created, especially decorated weapons. Examples include ceremonial bronze helmets, ornamental ax-heads and swords, elaborate instruments such as lurer, and other ceremonial objects without a practical purpose, such as the oversize Oxborough Dirk. Special objects were made in gold; many more gold objects have survived from Western and Central Europe than from the Iron Age, many mysterious and strange objects ranging from lunulas, apparently an Irish speciality, the Mold Cape and Golden hats. Pottery from Central Europe can be elaborately shaped and decorated. Rock art, showing scenes from the religious rituals have been found in many areas, for example in Bohusl√§n, Sweden and the Val Camonica in northern Italy. In the Mediterranean, the Minoan civilization was highly developed, with palace complexes from which sections of frescos have been excavated. Contemporary Ancient Egyptian art and that of other advanced Near Eastern cultures can no longer be treated as \\"prehistoric\\". =Iron Age= Gold shoe plaques from the Iron Age Hochdorf Chieftain's Grave, Germany, BC. The Iron Age saw the development of anthropomorphic sculptures, such as the warrior of Hirschlanden, and the statue from the Glauberg, Germany. Hallstatt artists in the early Iron Age favored geometric, abstract designs perhaps influenced by trade links with the Classical world. The more elaborate and curvilinear La T√®ne style developed in Europe in the later Iron Age from a centre in the Rhine valley but it soon spread across the continent. The rich chieftain classes appear to have encouraged ostentation and Classical influences such as bronze drinking vessels attest to a new fashion for wine drinking. Communal eating and drinking were an important part of Celtic society and culture and much of their art was often expressed through plates, knives, cauldrons and cups. Horse tack and weaponry were also decorated. Mythical animals were a common motif along with religious and natural subjects and their depiction is a mix between the naturalistic and the stylized. Megalithic art was still sometimes practiced, examples include the carved limestone pillars of the sanctuary at Entremont in modern-day France. Personal adornment included torc necklaces whilst the introduction of coinage provided a further opportunity for artistic expression. The coins of this period are derivatives of Greek and Roman types, but showing the more exuberant Celtic artistic style. A 1st century BCE mirror found in Desborough, England, showing the spiral and trumpet motif The famous late 4th century BCE Waldalgesheim chariot burial in the Rhineland produced many fine examples of La T√®ne art including a bronze flagon and bronze plaques with repouss√© human figures. Many pieces had curvy, organic styles though to be derived from Classical tendril patterns. In much of western Europe elements of this artistic style can be discerned surviving in the art and architecture of the Roman colonies. In particular in Britain and Ireland there is a tenuous continuity through the Roman period, enabling Celtic motifs to resurface with new vigour in the Christian Insular art from the 6th century onwards. The sophisticated Etruscan culture developed from the 9th to 2nd centuries, with considerable influence from the Greeks, before finally being absorbed by the Romans. By the end of the period they had developed writing, but early Etruscan art can be called prehistoric. Africa Ancient Egypt falls outside the scope of this article; it had a close relationship with the Sudan in particular, known in this period as Nubia, where there were advanced cultures from the 4th millennium BCE, such as the \\"A-Group\\", \\"C-Group\\", and the Kingdom of Kush. =Southern Africa= San rock painting of an eland at Drakensberg In September 2018, scientists reported the discovery of the earliest known drawing by Homo sapiens, which is estimated to be 73,000 years old, much earlier than the 43,000 years old artifacts understood to be the earliest known modern human drawings found previously. There is a significant body of rock painting in the region around Matobo National Park of Zimbabwe dating from as early as 6000 BCE to 500 CE.Coulson, p. 86 Significant San rock paintings exist in the Waterberg area above the Palala River and around Drakensberg in South Africa, some of which are considered to derive from the period 8000 BCE. These images are very clear and depict a variety of human and wildlife motifs, especially antelope. There appears to be a fairly continuous history of rock painting in this area; some of the art clearly dates into the 19th century. They include depictions of horses with riders, which were not introduced to the area until the 1820s.Coulson, pp. 80‚Äì82 Namibia, in addition to the Apollo 11 Cave complex, has a significant array of San rock art near Twyfelfontein. This work is several thousand years old, and appears to end with the arrival of pastoral tribes in the area.Unesco World Heritage designation. =Horn of Africa= Long-horned cattle and other rock art in the Laas Geel complex. Laas Geel is a complex of caves and rock shelters in northwestern Somalia. Famous for their rock art, the caves are located in a rural area on the outskirts of Hargeisa. They contain some of the earliest known cave paintings in the Horn of Africa, many of which depict pastoral scenes. Laas Geel's rock art is estimated to date back to somewhere between 9,000‚Äì8,000 and 3,000 BCE. In 2008, archaeologists also announced the discovery of cave paintings in Somalia's northern Dhambalin region, which the researchers suggest includes one of the earliest known depictions of a hunter on horseback. The rock art is in the Ethiopian-Arabian style, dated to 1000 to 3000 BCE. Other prehistoric art in the Horn region include stone megaliths and engravings, some of which are 3,500 years old. The town of Dillo in Ethiopia has a hilltop covered with stone stelae. It is one of several such sites in southern Ethiopia dating from historic period (10th-14th centuries).Coulson, p. 147 =Saharan Africa= A petroglyphic Saharan rock carving from southern Algeria depicting an antelope or gazelle. The early art of this region has been divided into five periods: * Bubalus Period, roughly 12-8 kya * Round Head Period, roughly 10-8 kya * Pastoral Period, roughly 7.5-4 kya * Horse Period, roughly 3-2 kya * Camel Period, 2,000 years ago to the present Rock carving of an elephant at Tadrart Acacus Works of the Bubalus period span the Sahara, with the finest work, carvings of naturalistically depicted megafauna, concentrated in the central highlands. The Round Head Period is dominated by paintings of strangely shaped human forms, and few animals, suggesting the artists were foragers. These works are largely limited to Tassili n'Ajjer and the Tadrart Acacus. Toward the end of the period, images of domesticated animals, as well as decorative clothing and headdresses appear. Pastoral Period art was more focused on domestic scenes, including herding and dancing. The quality of artwork declined, as figures became more simplified.Coulson, pp. 156‚Äì160 The Horse Period began in the eastern Sahara and spread west. Depictions from this period include carvings and paintings of horses, chariots, and warriors with metal weapons, although there are also frequent depictions of wildlife such as giraffes. Humans are generally depicted in a stylized way. Some of the chariot art bears resemblance to temple carvings from ancient Egypt. Occasionally, art panels are accompanied by Tifinagh script, still in use by the Berber people and the Tuareg today; however, modern Tuareg are generally unable to read these inscriptions. The final Camel period features carvings and paintings in which camels predominate, but also include humans with swords, and later, guns; the art of this time is relatively crude.Coulson, pp. 160‚Äì162,205 =North Africa= The Americas =North America= Great Serpent Mound, a 411-meter long (1,348 ft) effigy mound in Adams County, Ohio, ca. 1070 CE Belonging in the Lithic stage, the oldest known art in the Americas is the Vero Beach bone, possibly a mammoth bone, etched with a profile of walking mammoth that dates back to 11,000 BCE.\\"Ice Age Art from Florida.\\" Past Horizons. 23 June 2011 (retrieved 23 June 2011) The oldest known painted object in the Americas is the Cooper Bison Skull from 10,900‚Äì10,200 BCE.Bement, Leland C. Bison hunting at Cooper site: where lightning bolts drew thundering herds. Norman: University of Oklahoma Press, 1999: 37, 43, 176. . =Mesoamerica= An Olmec stone head The ancient Olmec \\"Bird Vessel\\" and bowl, both ceramic and dating to circa 1000 BC as well as other ceramics were produced in kilns capable of exceeding approximately 900 ¬∞C. The only other prehistoric culture known to have achieved such high temperatures is that of Ancient Egypt. Much Olmec art is highly stylized and uses an iconography reflective of the religious meaning of the artworks. Some Olmec art, however, is surprisingly naturalistic, displaying an accuracy of depiction of human anatomy perhaps equaled in the pre-Columbian New World only by the best Maya Classic-era art. Olmec art-forms emphasize monumental statuary and small jade carvings. A common theme is to be found in representations of a divine jaguar. Olmec figurines were also found abundantly through their period. =South America= Lithic age art in South America includes Monte Alegre culture rock paintings created at Caverna da Pedra Pintada dating back to 9250‚Äì8550 BCE.Wilford, John Noble. Scientist at Work: Anna C. Roosevelt; Sharp and To the Point In Amazonia. New York Times. 23 April 1996\\"Dating a Paleoindian Site in the Amazon in Comparison with Clovis Culture.\\" Science. March 1997: Vol. 275, no. 5308, pp. 194801952. (retrieved 1 Nov 2009) Guitarrero Cave in Peru has the earliest known textiles in South America, dating to 8000 BCE.Stone- Miller, 17 Peru and the central Andes =Lithic and preceramic periods= Stirrup handled Cupinisque ceramic vase 1250 BCE from the Larco Museum Peru, including an area of the central Andes stretching from the northern part of the country to northern Chile, has a rich cultural history, with evidence of human habitation dating to roughly 10,000 BCE.Lavall√©e, p. 88 Prior to the emergence of ceramics in this region around 1850 BCE, cave paintings and beads have been found. These finds include rock paintings that controversially date as far back as 9500 BCE in the Toquepala Caves.Lavall√©e, p. 94 Burial sites in Peru like one at Telarmachay as old as 8600-7200 BCE contained evidence of ritual burial, with red ocher and bead necklaces.Lavall√©e, p. 115 The earliest ceramics that appear in Peru may have been imported from the Validivia region; indigenous pottery production almost certainly arrived in the highlands around 1800 BCE at Kotosh, and on the coast at La Florida c. 1700 BCE. Older calabash gourd vessels with human faces burned into them were found at Huaca Prieta, a site dating to 2500-2000 BCELavall√©e, p. 186 Huaca Prieta also contained some early patterned and dyed textiles made from twisted plant fibers.Bruhns, p. 80 =Initial Period and First Horizon= An image of the Lanz√≥n deity on the great wall at Chav√≠n de Huantar, a First Horizon site The Initial Period in Central Andean cultures lasted roughly from 1800 BCE to 900 BCE. Textiles from this time found at Huaca Prieta are of astonishing complexity, including images such as crabs whose claws transform into snakes, and double-headed birds. Many of these images are similar to optical illusions, where which image dominates depends in part on which the viewer chooses to see. Other portable artwork from this time includes decorated mirrors, bone and shell jewelry, and unfired clay female effigies.Stone-Miller, pp. 19‚Äì20 Public architecture, including works estimated to require the movement of more than 100,000 tons of stone, are to be found at sites like Kotosh, El Para√≠so, Peru, and La Galgada (archaeological site). Kotosh, a site in the Andean highlands, is especially noted as the site of the Temple of the Crossed Hands, in which there are two reliefs of crossed forearms, one pair male, one pair female.Stone-Miller, p. 21 Also of note is one of South America's largest ceremonial sites, Sech√≠n Alto. This site's crowning work is a twelve-story platform, with stones incised with military themes.Stone-Miller, p. 27 The architecture and art of the highlands, in particular, laid down the groundwork for the rise of the Chav√≠n culture.Stone-Miller, p. 22 The Chav√≠n culture dominated the central Andes during the First Horizon, beginning around 900 BCE, and is generally divided into two stages. The first, running until about 500 BCE, represented a significant cultural unification of the highland and coastal cultures of the time. Imagery in all manner of art (textiles, ceramics, jewelry, and architectural) included sometimes fantastic imagery such as jaguars, snakes, and human‚Äìanimal composites, much of it seemingly inspired by the jungles to the east.Stone-Miller, pp. 28‚Äì29 The later stage of the Chav√≠n culture is primarily represented by a significant architectural expansion of the Chav√≠n de Huantar site around 500 BCE, accompanied by a set of stylistic changes. This expansion included, among other changes, over forty large stone heads, whose reconstructed positions represent a transformation from human to supernatural animal visages. Much of the other art at the complex from this time contains such supernatural imagery.Stone-Miller, p. 40 The portable art associated with this time included sophisticated metalworking, including alloying of metals and soldering.Stone-Miller, p. 44 Textiles found at sites like Karwa clearly depict Chav√≠n cultural influences,Stone-Miller, p. 46 and the Cupisnique style of pottery disseminated by the Chav√≠n would set standards all across the region for later cultures.Stone-Miller, p. 49 (The vessel pictured at the top of this article, while from the later Moche culture, is representative of the stirrup-spouted vessels of the Chav√≠n.) =Early Intermediate Period= A Paracas Mantle dating from 200 CE The Early Intermediate Period lasted from about 200 BCE to 600 CE. Late in the First Horizon, the Chav√≠n culture began to decline, and other cultures, predominantly in the coastal areas, began to develop. The earliest of these was the Paracas culture, centered on the Paracas Peninsula of central Peru. Active from 600 BCE to 175 BCE, their early work clearly shows Chav√≠n influence, but a locally distinctive style and technique developed. It was characterized by technical and time-consuming detail work, visually colorful, and a profusion visual elements. Distinctive technical differences include painting on clay after firing, and embroidery on textiles.Stone-Miller, p. 50 One notable find is a mantle that was clearly used for training purposes; it shows obvious indications of experts doing some of the weaving, interspersed with less technically proficient trainee work.Stone-Miller, p. 58 Nazca line figure known as The Dog The Nazca culture of southern Peru, which is widely known for the enormous figures traced on the ground by the Nazca lines in southern Peru, shared some similarities with the Paracas culture, but techniques (and scale) differed. The Nazca painted their ceramics with slip, and also painted their textiles.Stone-Miller, p. 67 Nazca ceramics featured a wide variety of subjects, from the mundane to the fantastic, including utilitarian vessels and effigy figures. The Nazca also excelled at goldsmithing, and made pan pipes from clay in a style not unlike the pipes heard in music of the Andes today.Stone-Miller, pp. 74‚Äì75 The famous Nazca lines are accompanied by temple-like constructions (showing no sign of permanent habitation) and open plazas that presumably had ritual purposes related to the lines. The lines themselves are laid out on a sort of natural blackboard, where a thin layer of dark stone covers lighter stone; the lines were thus created by simply removing the top layer where desired, after using surveying techniques to lay out the design.Stone-Miller, pp. 78‚Äì82 Gold Moche headdress representing a condor In the north of Peru, the Moche culture dominated during this time. Also known as Mochica or Early Chim√∫, this warlike culture dominated the area until about 500 CE, apparently using conquest to gain access to critical resources along the desert coast: arable land and water. Moche art is again notably distinctive, expressive and dynamic in a way that many other Andean cultures were not. Knowledge of the period has been notably expanded by finds like the pristine royal tombs at Sip√°n.Stone-Miller, p. 83 The Moche very obviously absorbed some elements of the Chav√≠n culture, but also absorbed ideas from smaller nearby cultures that they assimilated, such as the Recuay culture and the Vic√∫s.Stone-Miller, p. 88 They made fully sculpted ceramic animal figures, worked gold, and wove textiles. The art often featured everyday images, but seemingly always with a ritual intent.Stone- Miller, p. 86 In its later years, the Moche came under the influence of the expanding Huari empire. The Cerro Blanco site of Huaca del Sol appears to have been the Moche capital. Largely destroyed by natural events around 600 CE, it was further damaged by Spanish conquistadors searching for gold, and continues with modern looters.Stone-Miller, p. 92 =Middle Horizon= Ponce monolith in the sunken courtyard of the Tiwanaku's Kalasasaya temple The Middle Horizon lasted from 600 CE to 1000 CE, and was dominated by two cultures: the Huari and the Tiwanaku. The Tiwanaku (also spelled Tiahuanaco) culture arose near Lake Titicaca (on the modern border between Peru and Bolivia), while the Wari culture arose in the southern highlands of Peru. Both cultures appear to have been influenced by the Pukara culture, which was active during the Early Intermediate in between the primary centers of the Wari and Tiwanaku.Stone-Miller, pp. 121‚Äì123 These cultures both had wide- ranging influence, and shared some common features in their portable art, but their monumental arts were somewhat distinctive.Stone-Miller, p. 119 The monumental art of the Tiwanaku demonstrated technical prowess in stonework, including fine detailed reliefs, and monoliths such as the Ponce monolith (photo to the left), and the Sun Gate, both in the main Tiwanaku site. The portable art featured \\"portrait vessels\\", with figured heads on ceramic vessels, as well as natural imagery like jaguars and raptors.Stone-Miller, pp. 131‚Äì134 A full range of materials, from ceramics to textiles to wood, bone, and shell, were used in creative endeavours. Textiles with a weave of 300 threads per inch (80 threads per cm) have been found at Tiwanaku sites.Stone- Miller, p. 136 The ruins of Pikillacta, a Wari site The Wari dominated an area from northern to central Peru, with their main center near Ayacucho. Their art is distinguished from the Tiwanaku style by the use of bolder colors and patterns.Stone-Miller, pp. 138‚Äì139 Notable among Wari finds are tapestry garments, presumed to be made for priests or rulers to wear, often bearing abstract geometric designs of significant complexity, but also bearing images of animals and figures.Stone-Miller, pp. 146‚Äì148 Wari ceramics, also of high technical quality, are similar in many ways to those of the preceding cultures, where local influences from fallen cultures, like the Moche, are still somewhat evident. Metalwork, while rarely found due to its desirability by looters, shows elegant simplicity and, once more, a high level of workmanship.Stone-Miller, pp. 149‚Äì150 =Late Intermediate Period= Following the decline of the Wari and Tiwanaku, the northern and central coastal areas were somewhat dominated by the Chim√∫ culture, which included notable subcultures like the Lambayeque (or Sic√°n) and Chancay cultures. To the south, coastal cultures dominated in the Ica region, and there was a significant cultural crossroads at Pachacamac, near Lima.Stone-Miller, p. 151 These cultures would dominate from about 1000 CE until the 1460s and 1470s, as the Inca Empire began to take shape and eventually absorbed the geographically smaller nearby cultures. Chim√∫ and Sic√°n Cultures Sic√°n funerary mask, Metropolitan Museum The Chim√∫ culture in particular was responsible for an extremely large number of artworks. Its capital city, Chan Chan, appears to have contained building that appeared to function as museums‚Äîthey seem to have been used for displaying and preserving artwork. Much of the artwork from Chan Chan in particular has been looted, some by the Spanish after the Spanish conquest. The art from this time at times displays amazing complexity, with \\"multimedia\\" works that require artists working together in a diversity of media, including materials believed to have come from as far away as Central America. Items of increasing splendor or value were produced, apparently as the society became increasing stratified.Stone-Miller, p. 153 At the same, the quality of some of the work declined, as demand for pieces pushed production rates up and values down.Stone-Miller, p. 154 The Sic√°n culture flourished from 700 CE to about 1400 CE, although it came under political domination of the Chim√∫ around 1100 CE, at which time many of its artists may have moved to Chan Chan. There was significant copperworking by the Sic√°n, including what seems to be a sort of currency based on copper objects that look like axes.Stone-Miller, p. 156 Artwork includes burial masks, beakers and metal vessels that previous cultures traditionally made of clay. The metalwork of the Sic√°n was particularly sophisticated, with innovations including repouss√© and shell inlay. Sheet metal was also often used to cover other works.Stone- Miller, pp. 156‚Äì158 Prominent in Sic√°n iconography is the Sic√°n deity, which appears on all manner of work, from the portable to the monumental. Other imagery includes geometric and wave patterns, as well as scenes of fishing and shell diving.Stone-Miller, p. 160 Chancay culture Chancay culture, before it was subsumed by the Chim√∫, did not feature notable monumental art. Ceramics and textiles were made, but the quality and skill level was uneven. Ceramics are generally black on white, and often suffer from flaws like poor firing, and drips of the slip used for color; however, fine examples exist. Textiles are overall of a higher quality, including the use of painted weaves and tapestry techniques, and were produced in large quantities.Stone-Miller, pp. 175‚Äì177 The color palette of the Chancay was not overly bold: golds, browns, white, and scarlet predominate.Stone-Miller, p. 179 Pachacamac Pachacamac is a temple site south of Lima, Peru that was an important pilgrimage center into Spanish colonial times. The site boasts temple constructions from several periods, culminating in Inca constructions that are still in relatively good condition. The temples were painted with murals depicting plants and animals. The main temple contained a carved wooden sculpture akin to a totem pole. Ica culture The Ica region, which had been dominated by the Nazca, was fragmented into several smaller political and culture groups. The pottery produced in this region was of the highest quality at the time, and its aesthetics would be adopted by the Inca when they conquered the area.Stone-Miller, p. 180 =Late Horizon and Inca culture= An 1860 map of Cusco. The puma shape is discernible, with the head at the upper left and the tail at the lower right. The twelve angle stone, in the Hatum Rumiyoc street of Cusco, is an example of Inca masonry. This time period represents the era in which the culture of the central Andes is almost completely dominated by the Inca Empire, which began its expansion in 1438. It lasted until the Spanish conquest in 1533. The Inca absorbed much technical skill from the cultures they conquered, and disseminated it, along with standard shapes and patterns, throughout their area of influence, which extended from Quito, Ecuador to Santiago, Chile. Inca stonework is notably proficient; giant stones are set so tightly without mortar that a knife blade will not fit in the gap.Stone- Miller, p. 181 Many of the Inca's monumental structures deliberately echoed the natural environment around them; this is particularly evident in some of the structures at Machu Picchu.Stone-Miller, p. 190 The Inca laid the city of Cusco in the shape of a puma, with the head of the puma at Sacsayhuaman,Stone- Miller, p. 194 a shape that is still discernible in aerial photographs of the city today. The iconography of Inca art, while clearly drawing from its many predecessors, is still recognizably Inca. Bronzework owes a clear debt to the Chim√∫, as do a number of cultural traditions: the finest goods were reserved to the rulers, who wore the finest textiles, and ate and drank from gold and silver vessels.Stone-Miller, p. 186 As a result, Inca metalwork was relatively rare, and an obvious source of plunder for the conquering Spanish. An Inca period tunic Textiles were widely prized within the empire, in part as they were somewhat more portable in the far-flung empire.Stone-Miller, p. 209 Ceramics were made in large quantities, and, as with other media, in standardized shapes and patterns. One common shape is the urpu, a distinctive urn shape that came in a wide variety of standard capacities, much as modern storage containers do.Stone-Miller, p. 215 In spite of this standardization, many local areas retained some distinctive aspects of their culture in the works they produced; ceramics produced in areas under significant Chim√∫ control prior to the Inca rule still retain characteristics indicative of that style.Stone-Miller, p. 216 Following the Spanish conquest, the art of the central Andes was significantly affected by the conflict and diseases brought by the Spanish. Early colonial period art, began to show influences of both Christianity and Inca religious and artistic ideas, and eventually also began to encompass new techniques brought by the conquerors, including oil painting on canvas.Stone-Miller, p. 217 Early ceramics in northern South America The earliest evidence of decorated pottery in South America is to be found in two places. A variety of sites in the Santar√©m region of Brazil contain ceramic sherds dating to a period between 5000 and 3000 BCE. Sites in Colombia, at Mons√∫ and San Jacinto contained pottery finds in different styles, and date as far back as 3500 BCE. This is an area of active research and subject to change.Lavall√©e, pp. 176‚Äì182 The ceramics were decorated with curvilinear incisions. Another ancient site at Puerto Hormiga in the Bol√≠var Department of Colombia dating to 3100 BCE contained pottery fragments that included figured animals in a style related to later Barrancoid cultural finds in Colombia and Venezuela.Bruhns, pp. 116‚Äì117 Valdivia, Ecuador also has a site dated to roughly 3100 BCE containing decorated fragments, as well as figurines, many represent nude females. The Valdivian style stretched as far south as northern Peru,Bruhns, pp. 117‚Äì118 and may, according to Lavall√©e, yet yield older artifacts.Lavall√©e, p. 182 By 2000 BCE, pottery was evident in eastern Venezuela. The La Gruta style, often painted in red or white, included incised animal figures in the ceramic, as well as ceramic vessels shaped as animal effigies. The Rancho Peludo style of western Venezuela featured relatively simple textile-type decorations and incisions. Finds in the central Andes dating to 1800 BCE and later appear to be derived from the Valdivian tradition of Ecuador.Bruhns, p. 119 Early art in eastern South America Relatively little is known about the early settlement of much of South America east of the Andes. This is due to the lack of stone (generally required for leaving durable artifacts), and a jungle environment that rapidly recycles organic materials. Beyond the Andean regions, where the inhabitants were more clearly related to the early cultures of Peru, early finds are generally limited to coastal areas and those areas where there are stone outcrops. While there is evidence of human habitation in northern Brazil as early as 8000 BCE,Lavall√©e, p. 113 and rock art of unknown (or at best uncertain) age, ceramics appear to be the earliest artistic artifacts. The Mina civilization of Brazil (3000‚Äì1600 BCE) had simple round vessels with a red wash, that were stylistic predecessors to later Bahia and Guyanese cultures. Southern South America The southern reaches of South America show evidence of human habitation as far back as 10,000 BCE. A site at Arroio do Fosseis on the pampa in southern Brazil has shown reliable evidence to that time,Lavall√©e, p. 108 and the Tierra del Fuego at the southern tip of the continent has been occupied since 7000 BCE.Lavall√©e, p. 112 Artistic finds are scarce; in some parts of Patagonia ceramics were never made, only being introduced by contact with Europeans.Lavall√©e, p. 187 Oceania =Australia= rock painting in the Namadgi National Park From earliest times Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders have been creating distinctive patterns of art. Much of the art is transitory, drawn in sand or on the human body to illustrate a place, a totem, or a cultural story. Early surviving artworks are mostly rock paintings. Some are called X-ray paintings because they show the bones and organs of the animals they depict. Some Aboriginal art appears as abstract to modern viewers; Aboriginal art employs geometrical figures, dots and lines to present the story being told. Gwion Gwion rock art found in the north-west Kimberley region of Western Australia The Gwion Gwion rock art are one of many styles of rock art found in Western Australia. They are predominantly human figures drawn in fine detail with accurate anatomical proportioning. They are usually dated to be at least 17,000 years old, and there have been suggestions they are as much as 70,000 years old. The Sydney rock engravings are also a prominent rock art site in the country. =Polynesia= The natives of Polynesia have a distinct artistic heritage. While many of their artifacts were made with organic materials and thus lost to history, some of their most striking achievements survive in clay and stone. Among these are numerous pottery fragments from western Oceania, from the late 2nd millennium BCE. Also, the natives of Polynesia left scattered around their islands Petroglyphs, stone platforms or Marae, and sculptures of ancestor figures, the most famous of which are the Moai of Easter Island.

Subcutaneous injections are highly effective in administering medications such as insulin, morphine, diacetylmorphine and goserelin. Subcutaneous (as opposed to intravenous) injection of recreational drugs is referred to as \\"skin popping.\\" Subcutaneous administration may be abbreviated as SC, SQ, sub-cu, sub-Q, SubQ, or subcut. Subcut is the preferred abbreviation for patient safety. Subcutaneous tissue has few blood vessels and so drugs injected here are for slow, sustained rates of absorption.Taylor, C. R., Lillis, C., LeMone, P., Lynn, P. (2011) Fundamentals of nursing: The art and science of nursing care. Philadelphia: Lippincott Williams & Wilkins, page 749. It is slower than intramuscular injections but still faster than intradermal injections. Injection sites Subcutaneous injection sites Sites include, * The outer area of the upper arm. * The abdomen, from the rib margin to the iliac crest and avoiding a 2-inch circle around the navel. This has the fastest rate of absorption among the sites. * The front of the thigh, midway to the outer side, 4 inches below the top of the thigh to 4 inches above the knee. This has a slower rate of absorption than the upper arm. * The upper back. * The upper area of the buttock, just behind the hip bone. This has the slowest rate of absorption among the sites. Equipment A 25 to 31 gauge thick, 3/8\\" to 1\\" long needle can be used. The size is determined by the amount of subcutaneous tissue present, which is based on patient build. The 3/8\\" and 5/8\\" needles are most commonly used. Usually, no more than 1 mL of solution is given, compared to intradermal injections, where no more than 0.5 mL is usually given. Subcutaneous injections may also be given using an injector pen. Procedure Subcutaneous injections are inserted at 45 to 90 degree angles, depending on amount of subcutaneous tissue present and length of needle- a shorter, 3/8\\" needle is usually inserted 90 degrees and a 5/8\\" needle is usually inserted at 45 degrees. Medication is administered slowly, about 10 seconds/milliliter. Subcutaneous insulin injections in diabetes mellitus An insulin pump with a subcutaneous injection site A person with insulin-dependent (either type 1 or type 2) diabetes mellitus typically injects insulin subcutaneously. The injection should be given under the skin, into the fat layer.

In medicine, it is one of several methods for parenteral administration of medications. Intramuscular injection may be preferred because muscles have larger and more numerous blood vessels than subcutaneous tissue, leading to faster absorption than subcutaneous or intradermal injections. Medication administered via intramuscular injection also is not subject to the first-pass metabolism effect which affects oral medications. Common sites for intramuscular injections include the deltoid muscle of the upper arm and the gluteal muscle of the buttock. In infants, the vastus lateralis muscle of the thigh is commonly used. The area must be cleaned prior to administering the injection, and the injection should be administered in a fast, darting motion to decrease the discomfort to the individual. The volume to be injected in the muscle is usually limited to 2-5 milliliters, depending on injection site. A site should not be chosen which has signs of infection or muscle atrophy. Intramuscular injections should not be used in people with myopathies or clotting problems. Intramuscular injections commonly result in pain, redness, and swelling or inflammation around the injection site. These side effects are generally mild and last no more than a few days at most. Rarely, nerves or blood vessels around the injection site can be damaged, resulting in severe pain or paralysis. If proper technique is not followed, intramuscular injections can result in localized infections such as abscesses and gangrene. While historically aspiration was recommended to prevent inadvertent administration into a vein, it is no longer recommended for most injection sites. Uses Vaccines are often administered as IM injections. Intramuscular injection is commonly used for medication administration. Medication administered in the muscle is generally quickly absorbed in the bloodstream, and avoids the first pass metabolism which occurs with oral administration. The medication may not be considered 100% bioavailable as it must still be absorbed from the muscle, which occurs over time. An intramuscular injection can be administered faster and is less invasive than an intravenous infusion, as the site of injection (a muscle versus a vein) is much larger. Medications administered in the muscle may also be administered as depot injections, which provide slow continuing release of medicine over a long period of time. Certain substances, including ketamine, may be injected intramuscularly for recreational purposes. Disadvantages of intramuscular administration include skill and technique required, pain from injection, anxiety or fear (especially in children), and difficult proper self- administration of medications. Vaccines, especially inactivated vaccines, are commonly administered via intramuscular injection. However, it has been estimated that for every vaccine injected intramuscularly, over 20 injections are given to administer drugs or other therapy. This can include medications such as antibiotics, immunoglobulin, and hormones such as testosterone and medroxyprogesterone. In a case of severe allergic reaction, or anaphylaxis, a person may use an epinephrine autoinjector to self-administer epinephrine in the muscle. Contraindications Intramuscular administration of medication is contraindicated in people with an active infection at the injection site, and those with thrombocytopenia or clotting problems. It is also not recommended in people who are suffering from hypovolemic shock, myopathies, or muscle atrophy, as these may affect the absorption of the medication. Other forms of administration are preferred in people with a myocardial infarction, as the damage to the muscle from an injection may affect tests used in the evaluation thereof. Risks and complications As with any injection which pierces the skin, there is a risk of infection from bacteria or other organisms present in the environment or on the skin prior to the injection. This risk is lessened with proper aseptic technique and cleansing of the area prior to administration. Intramuscular injections may also cause an abscess or gangrene at the injection site, depending on the specific medication and amount administered. There is also a risk of nerve or vascular injury if a nerve or blood vessel is inadvertently hit during injection. If single-use or sterilized equipment is not used, there is the risk of transmission of infectious disease between users. Injections into the deltoid site in the arm can result in unintentional damage to the radial and axillary nerves. In rare cases when not performed properly, the injection may result in shoulder dysfunction. The most frequent complications of a deltoid injection include pain, redness, and inflammation around the injection site, which are almost always mild and last only a few days at most. The dorsogluteal site of injection is associated with a higher risk of skin and tissue trauma, muscle fibrosis or contracture, haematoma, nerve palsy, paralysis, and infections such as abscesses and gangrene. Furthermore, injection in the gluteal muscle poses a risk for damage to the sciatic nerve, which may cause shooting pain or a sensation of burning. Sciatic nerve damage can also affect a person's ability to move their foot on the affected side, and other parts of the body controlled by the nerve. Damage to the sciatic nerve can be prevented by using the ventrogluteal site instead, and by selecting an appropriate size and length of needle for the injection. Technique An intramuscular injection can be administered in multiple different muscles of the body. Common sites for IM injection include: deltoid, dorsogluteal, rectus femoris, vastus lateralis and ventrogluteal muscles. Sites that are bruised, tender, red, swollen, inflamed or scarred are generally avoided. The specific medication and amount being administered will influence the decision of the specific muscle chosen for injection. The injection site is first cleaned using an antimicrobial and allowed to dry. The injection is performed in a quick, darting motion perpendicular to the skin, at an angle between 72 and 90 degrees. The practitioner will stabilize the needle with one hand while using their other hand to depress the plunger to slowly inject the medication - a rapid injection causes more discomfort. The needle is withdrawn at the same angle inserted. Gentle pressure may be applied with gauze if bleeding occurs. Pressure or gentle massage of the muscle following injection may reduce the risk of pain. The CDC does not recommend the practice of aspirating for blood to rule out injecting into a blood vessel, as aspiration may increase the risk of pain. There is no evidence that aspiration is useful to increase safety of intramuscular injections when injecting in a site other than the dorsogluteal site. =Injection sites= The deltoid muscle (upper arm) is used for injections of small volume, usually equal or less than 2 ml. This includes most intramuscular vaccinations. It is not recommended to use the deltoid for repeated injections due to its small area, which makes it difficult to space out injections from each other.The Joanna Briggs Institute. Recommended Practice. Injection: Intramuscular. The Joanna Briggs Institute EBP Database, from the JBI@Ovid database, published 2019; JBI2138. Accessed on 12 September 2020. The deltoid site is located by locating the lower edge of the acromion process, and injecting in the area which forms an upside down triangle with its base at the acromion process and its midpoint in line with the armpit. An injection into the deltoid muscle commonly uses a 1-inch long needle, but may use a -inch long needle for younger people or very frail elderly people. The ventrogluteal (hip) site is used for injections which require a larger volume to be administered, greater than 1 ml, and for medications which are known to be irritating, viscous, or oily. It is also used to administer narcotic medications, antibiotics, sedatives and anti-emetics. The ventrogluteal site is located in a triangle formed by the anterior superior iliac spine and the iliac crest, and may be located using a hand as a guide. The ventrogluteal site is less painful for injection than other sites such as the deltoid site. The vastus lateralis site is used for infants less than 7 months old and people who are unable to walk or who have loss of muscular tone. The site is located by dividing the front thigh into thirds vertically and horizontally to form nine squares; the injection is administered in the outer middle square. This site is also the usual site of administration for epinephrine autoinjectors, which are used in the outer thigh, corresponding to the location of the vastus lateralis muscle. Last revised 03/15/2017 The dorsogluteal (buttock) site is not routinely used due to its location near major blood vessels and nerves, as well as having inconsistent depth of adipose tissue. Many injections in this site do not penetrate deep enough under the skin to be correctly administered in the muscle. While current evidence based practice recommends against using this site, many healthcare providers still use this site, often due to a lack of knowledge about alternative sites for injection. This site is located by dividing the buttock into four using a cross shape, and administering the injection in the upper outer quadrant. This is the only intramuscular injection site for which aspiration is recommended of the syringe prior to injection, due to higher likelihood of accidental intravenous administration in this area. However, aspiration is not recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which considers it outdated for any intramuscular injection. =Special populations= In some populations, a change in injection site, needle length, or technique is necessary. For example, in very young people or frail elderly people, a normal length needle may be too long to safely inject in the desired muscle. For this reason, in these people, a shorter needle is recommended to decrease the risk of injecting too deep. It is also recommended to consider using the anterolateral thigh as an injection site in infants under one year old. To help infants and children cooperate with injection administration, the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices in the United States recommends using distractions, giving something sweet, and slow lateral swaying. In people who are overweight, a 1.5-inch needle may be used to ensure the injection is given below the subcutaneous layer of skin, while a -inch needle may be used for people who weigh under . In any case, the skin does not need to be pinched up prior to injecting when the appropriate length needle is used. History Injections into muscular tissue may have taken place as early as the year 500. Beginning in the late 1800s, the procedure began to be described in more detail and techniques began to be developed by physicians practicing at the time. In the early days of intramuscular injections, the procedure was performed almost exclusively by physicians. In the mid 1900s, nurses began preparing equipment and patients for intramuscular injections as part of their delegated duties from physicians, and by 1961 they had \\"essentially taken over the procedure\\". To this time, there was not uniform procedures or education for nurses in proper administration of intramuscular injections, and complications from improper injection were common. Intramuscular injections began to be used for administration of vaccines for diphtheria in 1923, whooping cough in 1926, and tetanus in 1927. By the 1970s, researchers and instructors began forming guidance on injection site and technique to reduce the risk of injection complications and side effects such as pain. Also in the early 1970s, botulinum toxin began to be injected into muscles to intentionally paralyze them for therapeutic reasons, and later for cosmetic reasons. Until the 2000s, aspiration after inserting the needle was recommended as a safety measure, to ensure the injection was being administered in a muscle and not inadvertently in a vein. However, this is no longer recommended as evidence shows no safety benefit and it lengthens the injection, which causes more pain.

The art of pre-literate societies is normally referred to as Prehistoric art and is not covered here. Although some Pre-Columbian cultures developed writing during the centuries before the arrival of Europeans, on grounds of dating these are covered at Pre-Columbian art, and articles such as Maya art and Aztec art. Olmec art is mentioned below. Middle East and Mediterranean =Mesopotamia= Mesopotamia (from the Greek ŒúŒµœÉŒøœÄŒøœÑŒ±ŒºŒØŒ± \\"[land] between the rivers\\", in Syriac called ‹í‹ù‹¨ ‹¢‹ó‹™‹ù‹¢ pronounced \\"Beth Nahrain\\", \\"Land of rivers\\", rendered in Arabic as ÿ®ŸÑÿßÿØ ÿßŸÑÿ±ÿßŸÅÿØŸäŸÜ bilƒÅd al-rƒÅfidayn) is a toponym for the area of the Tigris-Euphrates river system, largely corresponding to modern-day Iraq, as well as some parts of northeastern Syria, southeastern Turkey, and southwestern Iran. Mesopotamia is often considered the \\"cradle of civilization.\\" Within its boundaries, some of the most ancient civilizations known first developed writing and agriculture. Many civilizations flourished there, leaving behind a rich legacy of ancient art. Widely considered to be the cradle of civilization, Bronze Age Mesopotamia included Sumer and the Akkadian, Babylonian and Assyrian empires. In the Iron Age, it was ruled by the Neo-Assyrian and Neo-Babylonian empires. The indigenous Sumerians and Akkadians (including Assyrians & Babylonians) dominated Mesopotamia from the beginning of written history (c. 3100 BC) to the fall of Babylon in 539 BC, when it was conquered by the Achaemenid Empire. It fell to Alexander the Great in 332 BC and after his death it became part of the Greek Seleucid Empire. Around 150 BC, Mesopotamia was under the control of the Parthians. Mesopotamia became a battleground between the Romans and Parthians, with parts of Mesopotamia (particularly Assyria) coming under periodic Roman control. In 226 AD, it fell to the Sassanid Persians, and remained under Persian rule until the 7th-century Arab Islamic conquest of the Sassanid Empire. A number of primarily Christian native Mesopotamian states existed between the 1st century BC and 3rd century AD, including Adiabene, Oshroene and Hatra. Etymology: The regional toponym Mesopotamia (from the root words \\"meso\\" < ŒºŒ≠œÉŒøœÇ = middle and \\"potamia\\" < œÄŒøœÑŒ±ŒºœåœÇ = river, literally \\"between rivers\\") was coined in the Hellenistic period to refer to a broad geographical area without definite boundaries, and was probably used by the Seleucids. The term biritum/birit narim corresponded to a similar geographical concept and was coined during the Aramaicization of the region, in the 10th century BC. It is widely accepted, however, that early Mesopotamian societies simply referred to the entire alluvium by the Sumerian term kalam (\\"land\\"). More recently, terms like \\"Greater Mesopotamia\\" or \\"Syro-Mesopotamia\\" have been adopted to refer to wider geographies corresponding to the Near East or Middle East. These later euphemisms are Eurocentric terms attributed to the region in the midst of various 19th-century Western encroachments. Sumerian Archaeological evidence attests to their existence during the 5th millennium BC. The Sumerians decorated their pottery with cedar oil paints. The Sumerians also developed jewelry. One of the most remarkable artifacts remaining from the Sumerian civilization is known as the Standard of Ur. Dated to approximately 2500 B.C., the Standard is a wooden box inlaid with shells and lapis lazuli. It depicts, on one side, soldiers presenting their king with prisoners and, on the other side, peasants presenting him with gifts‚Äîstunning evidence that attests to the vibrancy of art in this ancient culture. Sumer had made many great advances; for example, there is the wheel, which had made transportation easier for the Sumerians. The arch was the greatest architectural achievement of Sumer. The ziggurats were pyramid-shaped temples the Sumerian architects built. They believed that the gods lived at the tops of the temples. The kings would declare that the gods had sent them to rule, and the Sumerians would happily follow the king's laws. The king had many important jobs like leading the army and looking after irrigation, with which Sumerians could control rivers. The rulers would have battles over land, and life went on for the Sumerians.

The Babylonians took advantage of the abundance of clay in Mesopotamia to create bricks. The use of brick led to the early development of the pilaster and column, as well as of frescoes and enameled tiles. The walls were brilliantly coloured, and sometimes plated with bronze or gold as well as with tiles. Painted terra-cotta cones were also embedded in the plaster. The sean were also great metal-workers, creating functional and beautiful tools with copper. It is possible that Babylonia was the original home of copper-working, which spread westward with the civilization to which it belonged. In addition, the want of stone in Babylonia made every pebble precious and led to a high perfection in the art of gem-cutting. The arts of Babylon also included tapestries, and Babylonian civilization was from an early date famous for its embroideries and rugs.

When Babylon fell into decline it was eventually conquered by Assyria, one of its former colonies, Assyria inherited its arts as well as its empire. At first, Assyrian architects and artists copied Babylonian styles and materials, but as time went by, however, the later Assyrians began to shake themselves free of Babylonian influences. The walls of the Assyrian palaces were lined with slabs of stone instead of brick, and were colored instead of painted as in Chaldea. In place of the bas relief we have sculpted figures, the earliest examples being the statues from Girsu which are realistic but somewhat clumsy. No remarkable specimens of metallurgic art from early Assyria have been found, but at a later epoch great excellence was attained in the manufacture of such jewellery as ear-rings and bracelets of gold. Copper was also worked with skill. The forms of Assyrian pottery were graceful; the porcelain, like the glass discovered in the palaces of Nineveh, was derived from Egyptian originals. Transparent glass seems to have been first introduced in the reign of Sargon II. Stone as well as clay and glass were employed in the manufacture of vases. Vases of hard stone have been disinterred at Tello similar to those of the early dynastic period of Egypt. Ashurbanipal had promoted art and culture and had a vast library of cuneiform tablets at Nineveh.

This period falls under the Anatolian Bronze Age. It is characterized by a long tradition of canonized images and motifs rearranged, while still being recognizable, by artists to convey meaning to a largely illiterate population. > \\"Owing to the limited vocabulary of figural types [and motifs], invention > for the Hittite artist usually was a matter of combining and manipulating > the units to form more complex compositions\\" Many of these recurring images revolve around the depiction of Hittite deities and ritual practices. There is also a prevalence of hunting scenes in Hittite relief and representational animal forms. Much of the art comes from settlements like Alaca H√∂y√ºk, or the Hittite capital of Hattusa near modern- day Boƒüazkale. Scholars do have difficulty dating a large portion of Hittite art, citing the fact that there is a lack of inscription and much of the found material, especially from burial sites, was moved from their original locations and distributed among museums during the nineteenth century.

Its sites were discovered and named by the Soviet archaeologist Viktor Sarianidi (1976). Monumental urban centers, palaces and cultic buildings were uncovered, notably at Gonur-depe in Turkmenistan. BMAC materials have been found in the Indus Valley Civilisation, on the Iranian Plateau, and in the Persian Gulf.C.C. Lamberg-Karlovsky, \\"Archaeology and Language: The Indo-Iranians\\", Current Anthropology, vol. 43, no. 1 (Feb. 2002). Finds within BMAC sites provide further evidence of trade and cultural contacts. They include an Elamite-type cylinder seal and a Harappan seal stamped with an elephant and Indus script found at Gonur-depe. The relationship between Altyn-Depe and the Indus Valley seems to have been particularly strong. Among the finds there were two Harappan seals and ivory objects. The Harappan settlement of Shortugai in Northern Afghanistan on the banks of the Amu Darya probably served as a trading station.V. M. Masson, \\"The Bronze Age in Khorasan and Transoxiana,\\" chapter 10 in A.H.

A famous type of Bactrian artworks are the \\"Bactrian princesses\\" (a.k.a. \\"Oxus ladies\\"). Wearing large stylized dresses with puffed sleeves, as well as headdresses that merge with the hair, they embody the ranking goddess, character of the central Asian mythology that plays a regulatory role, pacifying the untamed forces. These statuettes are made by combining and assembling materials of contrasting colors. The preferred materials are chlorite (or similar dark green stones), a whitish limestone or mottled alabaster or marine shells from the Indian Ocean. The different elements of body and costume were carved separately and joined, as in a puzzle, by tenon and mortices glue.

Most survivals of court art are monumental sculpture, above all the reliefs, double animal-headed Persian column capitals and other sculptures of Persepolis.Cotterell, 161‚Äì162 Although the Persians took artists, with their styles and techniques, from all corners of their empire, they produced not simply a combination of styles, but a synthesis of a new unique Persian style.; Cotterell, 162 Cyrus the Great in fact had an extensive ancient Iranian heritage behind him; the rich Achaemenid gold work, which inscriptions suggest may have been a specialty of the Medes, was for instance in the tradition of earlier sites. There are a number of very fine pieces of jewellery or inlay in precious metal, also mostly featuring animals, and the Oxus Treasure has a wide selection of types. Small pieces, typically in gold, were sewn to clothing by the elite, and a number of gold torcs have survived.

This is due to its being highly influenced by foreign artistic cultures: primarily Egypt, Greece and Assyria.

Pre-Islamic Yemen produced stylized alabaster heads of great aesthetic and historic charm. Most of the pre-Islamic sculptures are made of alabaster. Archaeology has revealed some early settled civilizations in Saudi Arabia: the Dilmun civilization on the east of the Arabian Peninsula, Thamud north of the Hejaz, and Kindah kingdom and Al-Magar civilization in the central of Arabian Peninsula. The earliest known events in Arabian history are migrations from the peninsula into neighbouring areas.Philip Khuri Hitti (2002), History of the Arabs, Revised: 10th Edition In antiquity, the role of South Arabian societies such as Saba (Sheba) in the production and trade of aromatics not only brought such kingdoms wealth but also tied the Arabian peninsula into trade networks, resulting in far-ranging artistic influences. It seems probable that before around 4000 BC the Arabian climate was somewhat wetter that today, benefitting from a monsoon system that has since moved south. During the late fourth millennium BC permanent settlements began to appear, and inhabitants adjusted to the emerging dryer conditions. In south-west Arabia (modern Yemen) a moister climate supported several kingdoms during the second and first millennia BC. The most famos of these is Sheba, the kingdom of the biblical Queen of Sheba. These societies used a combination of trade in spices and the natural resources of the region, including aromatics such as frankincense and myrrh, to build wealthy kingdoms. MƒÅrib, the Sabaean capital, was well positioned to tap into Mediterranean as well as Near Eastern trade, and in kingdoms to the east, in what is today Oman, trading links with Mesopotamia, Persia and even India were possible. The area was never a part of the Assyrian or Persian empires, and even Babylonian control of north-west Arabia seems to have been relatively short-lived. Later Roman attempts to control the region's lucrative trade foundered. This impenetrability to foreign armies doubtless augmented ancient rulers' bargaining power in the spice and incense trade. Although subject to external influences, south Arabia retained characteristics particular to itself. The human figure is typically based on strong, square shapes, the fine modeling of detail contrastingwith a stylized simplicity of form.

Ancient Egyptian art is characterized by the idea of order. Clear and simple lines combined with simple shapes and flat areas of color helped to create a sense of order and balance in the art of ancient Egypt. Ancient Egyptian artists used vertical and horizontal reference lines to maintain the correct proportions in their work. Political and religious, as well as artistic, order was also maintained in Egyptian art. To clearly define the social hierarchy of a situation, figures were drawn to sizes that were based not on their distance from the painter's perspective but on relative importance. For instance, the Pharaoh would be drawn as the largest figure in a painting no matter where he was situated, and a greater God would be drawn larger than a lesser god. Symbolism also played an important role in establishing a sense of order. Symbolism, ranging from the Pharaoh's regalia (symbolizing his power to maintain order) to the individual symbols of Egyptian gods and goddesses, was omnipresent in Egyptian art. Animals were usually also highly symbolic figures in Egyptian art. Color, as well, had extended meaning‚Äîblue and green represented the Nile and life; yellow stood for the sun god; and red represented power and vitality. The colors in Egyptian artifacts have survived extremely well over the centuries because of Egypt's dry climate. Despite the stilted form caused by a lack of perspective, ancient Egyptian art is often highly realistic. Ancient Egyptian artists often show a sophisticated knowledge of anatomy and a close attention to detail, especially in their renderings of animals. During the 18th Dynasty of Egypt a Pharaoh by the name of Akhenaton took the throne and abolished the traditional polytheism. He formed a monotheistic religion based on the worship of Aten, a sun god. Artistic change followed political upheaval. A new style of art was introduced that was more naturalistic than the stylized frieze favored in Egyptian art for the previous 1700 years. After Akhenaton's death, however, Egyptian artists reverted to their old styles. Faience that was produced in ancient Egyptian antiquity as early as 3500 BC was in fact superior to the tin-glazed earthenware of the European 15th century. Ancient Egyptian faience was not made of clay but instead actually of a ceramic composed primarily of quartz.

Minoan civilization was known for its beautiful ceramics, but also for its frescos, landscapes, and stone carvings. In the early Minoan period, ceramics were characterized by spirals, triangles, curved lines, crosses, and fishbone motifs. In the middle Minoan period, naturalistic designs such as fish, squid, birds, and lilies were common. In the late Minoan period, flowers and animals were still the most characteristic, but variability had increased. The 'palace style' of the region around Knossos is characterized by strong geometric simplification of naturalistic shapes and by monochromatic painting. The Palace at Knossos was decorated with frescoes that showed aspects of daily life, including court ritual and entertainment such as bull-leaping and boxing. The Minoans were also skilled goldsmiths who created beautiful pendants and masks.

As may be seen from this item, the Mycenaeans specialized in gold-working. Their artworks are known for a plethora of decorative motifs employed. At some point in their cultural history, the Mycenaeans adopted the Minoan goddesses and associated these goddesses with their sky-god; scholars believe that the Greek pantheon of deities does not reflect Mycenaean religion except for the goddesses and Zeus. These goddesses, however, are Minoan in origin.

Greek sculpture is known for the contrapposto standing of the figures. The art of Ancient Greece is usually divided stylistically into three periods: the Archaic, the Classical and the Hellenistic. The history of Ancient Greek pottery is divided stylistically into periods: the Protogeometric, the Geometric, the Late Geometric or Archaic, the Black Figure and the Red Figure. Ancient Greek art has survived most successfully in the forms of sculpture and architecture, as well as in such minor arts as coin design, pottery and gem engraving. The most prestigious form of Ancient Greek painting was panel painting, now known only from literary descriptions; they perished rapidly after the 4th century AD, when they were no longer actively protected. Today not much survives of Greek painting, except for late mummy paintings and a few paintings on the walls of tombs, mostly in Macedonia and Italy. Painting on pottery, of which a great deal survives, gives some sense of the aesthetics of Greek painting. The techniques involved, however, were very different from those used in large-format painting. It was mainly in black and gold and was painted using different paints than the ones used on walls or wood, because it was a different surface.

From around 600 BC it was heavily influenced by Greek art, which was imported by the Etruscans, but always retained distinct characteristics. Particularly strong in this tradition were figurative sculpture in terracotta (especially life-size on sarcophagi or temples), wall- painting and metalworking especially in bronze. Jewelry and engraved gems of high quality were produced. Etruscan sculpture in cast bronze was famous and widely exported, but relatively few large examples have survived (the material was too valuable, and recycled later). In contrast to terracotta and bronze, there was relatively little Etruscan sculpture in stone, despite the Etruscans controlling fine sources of marble, including Carrara marble, which seems not to have been exploited until the Romans. The great majority of survivals came from tombs, which were typically crammed with sarcophagi and grave goods, and terracotta fragments of architectural sculpture, mostly around temples. Tombs have produced all the fresco wall-paintings, which show scenes of feasting and some narrative mythological subjects.

Indeed, the villas of the wealthy Romans unearthed in Pompeii and Herculaneum show a strong predilection for all things Greek. Many of the most significant Greek artworks survive by virtue of their Roman interpretation and imitation. Roman artists sought to commemorate great events in the life of their state and to glorify their emperors as well as record the inner life of people, and express ideas of beauty and nobility. Their busts, and especially the images of individuals on gravestones, are very expressive and lifelike, finished with skill and panache. In Greece and Rome, wall painting was not considered as high art. The most prestigious form of art besides sculpture was panel painting, i.e. tempera or encaustic painting on wooden panels. Unfortunately, since wood is a perishable material, only a very few examples of such paintings have survived, namely the Severan Tondo from circa 200 AD, a very routine official portrait from some provincial government office, and the well-known Fayum mummy portraits, all from Roman Egypt, and almost certainly not of the highest contemporary quality. The portraits were attached to burial mummies at the face, from which almost all have now been detached. They usually depict a single person, showing the head, or head and upper chest, viewed frontally. The background is always monochrome, sometimes with decorative elements. In terms of artistic tradition, the images clearly derive more from Greco-Roman traditions than Egyptian ones. They are remarkably realistic, though variable in artistic quality, and may indicate the similar art which was widespread elsewhere but did not survive. A few portraits painted on glass and medals from the later empire have survived, as have coin portraits, some of which are considered very realistic as well. Pliny the Younger complained of the declining state of Roman portrait art, \\"The painting of portraits which used to transmit through the ages the accurate likenesses of people, has entirely gone out‚Ä¶Indolence has destroyed the arts.\\" Bronze statuette of a philosopher on a lamp stand MET DT2527.jpgBronze statuette of a philosopher on a lamp stand; late 1st century BC; bronze; overall: 27.3 cm; weight: 2.9 kg; Metropolitan Museum of Art (New York City) Statue-Augustus.jpgAugustus of Prima Porta; circa 20 BC; white marble; height: 2.06 m; Vatican Museums (Vatican City) Cubiculum (bedroom) from the Villa of P.

During China's Bronze Age, Chinese of the ancient Shang Dynasty and Zhou Dynasty produced multitudes of artistic bronzeware vessels for practical purposes, but also for religious ritual and geomancy. The earliest (surviving) Chinese paintings date to the Warring States period, and they were on silk as well as lacquerwares. One of ancient China's most famous artistic relics remains the Terracotta warriors, an assembly of 8,099 individual and life-size terracotta figures (such as infantry, horses with chariots and cavalry, archers, and military officers), buried in the tomb of Qin Shi Huang, the First Qin Emperor, in 210 BC. This tradition was carried into the subsequent Han Dynasty, although their tombs contained miniature versions of the soldiers in addition to domestic servants to serve rulers and nobility in the afterlife. Chinese art arguably shows more continuity between ancient and modern periods than that of any other civilization, as even when foreign dynasties took the Imperial throne they did not impose new cultural or religious habits and were relatively quickly assimilated.

European prehistoric art started as mobile Upper Paleolithic rock and cave painting and petroglyph art and was characteristic of the period between the Paleolithic and the Iron Age. Written histories of European art often begin with the art of the Ancient Middle East and the Ancient Aegean civilizations, dating from the 3rd millennium BC. Parallel with these significant cultures, art of one form or another existed all over Europe, wherever there were people, leaving signs such as carvings, decorated artifacts and huge standing stones. However a consistent pattern of artistic development within Europe becomes clear only with the art of Ancient Greece, adopted and transformed by Rome and carried; with the Roman Empire, across much of Europe, North Africa and the Middle East.Boardman, John ed., The Oxford History of Classical Art, pp. 349-369, Oxford University Press, 1993, The influence of the art of the Classical period waxed and waned throughout the next two thousand years, seeming to slip into a distant memory in parts of the Medieval period, to re-emerge in the Renaissance, suffer a period of what some early art historians viewed as \\"decay\\" during the Baroque period,Banister Fletcher excluded nearly all Baroque buildings from his mammoth tome A History of Architecture on the Comparative Method.

(2001). A History of European Society. Essentials of Western Civilization (Vol. 2, pp. 245‚Äì246). Belmont, CA: Thomson Learning, Inc. Before the 1800s, the Christian church was a major influence upon European art, the commissions of the Church, architectural, painterly and sculptural, providing the major source of work for artists. The history of the Church was very much reflected in the history of art, during this period. In the same period of time there was renewed interest in heroes and heroines, tales of mythological gods and goddesses, great wars, and bizarre creatures which were not connected to religion. Most art of the last 200 years has been produced without reference to religion and often with no particular ideology at all, but art has often been influenced by political issues, whether reflecting the concerns of patrons or the artist. European art is arranged into a number of stylistic periods, which, historically, overlap each other as different styles flourished in different areas. Broadly the periods are, Classical, Byzantine, Medieval, Gothic, Renaissance, Baroque, Rococo, Neoclassical, Modern, Postmodern and New European Painting. Prehistoric art European prehistoric art is an important part of the European cultural heritage. Prehistoric art history is usually divided into four main periods: Stone Age, Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. Most of the remaining artifacts of this period are small sculptures and cave paintings. Venus of Willendorf; c. 26,000 BC (the Gravettian period); limestone with ocre coloring; Naturhistorisches Museum (Vienna, Austria) Much surviving prehistoric art is small portable sculptures, with a small group of female Venus figurines such as the Venus of Willendorf (24,000‚Äì22,000 BC) found across central Europe;Sandars, 8-16, 29-31 the 30 cm tall L√∂wenmensch figurine of about 30,000 BCE has hardly any pieces that can be related to it. The Swimming Reindeer of about 11,000 BCE is one of the finest of a number of Magdalenian carvings in bone or antler of animals in the art of the Upper Paleolithic, though they are outnumbered by engraved pieces, which are sometimes classified as sculpture.Hahn, Joachim, \\"Prehistoric Europe, ¬ßII: Palaeolithic 3. Portable art\\" in Oxford Art Online, accessed 24 August 2012; Sandars, 37-40 With the beginning of the Mesolithic in Europe figurative sculpture greatly reduced,Sandars, 75-80 and remained a less common element in art than relief decoration of practical objects until the Roman period, despite some works such as the Gundestrup cauldron from the European Iron Age and the Bronze Age Trundholm sun chariot.Sandars, 253-257, 183-185 The oldest European cave art dates back 40,800, and can be found in the El Castillo Cave in Spain. Other cave painting sites include Lascaux, Cave of Altamira, Grotte de Cussac, Pech Merle, Cave of Niaux, Chauvet Cave, Font-de-Gaume, Creswell Crags, Nottinghamshire, England, (Cave etchings and bas-reliefs discovered in 2003), Coliboaia cave from Romania (considered the oldest cave painting in central Europe) and Magura, Belogradchik, Bulgaria. Rock painting was also performed on cliff faces, but fewer of those have survived because of erosion. One well-known example is the rock paintings of Astuvansalmi in the Saimaa area of Finland. When Marcelino Sanz de Sautuola first encountered the Magdalenian paintings of the Altamira cave, Cantabria, Spain in 1879, the academics of the time considered them hoaxes. Recent reappraisals and numerous additional discoveries have since demonstrated their authenticity, while at the same time stimulating interest in the artistry of Upper Palaeolithic peoples. Cave paintings, undertaken with only the most rudimentary tools, can also furnish valuable insight into the culture and beliefs of that era. The Rock art of the Iberian Mediterranean Basin represents a very different style, with the human figure the main focus, often seen in large groups, with battles, dancing and hunting all represented, as well as other activities and details such as clothing. The figures are generally rather sketchily depicted in thin paint, with the relationships between the groups of humans and animals more carefully depicted than individual figures. Other less numerous groups of rock art, many engraved rather than painted, show similar characteristics. The Iberian examples are believed to date from a long period perhaps covering the Upper Paleolithic, Mesolithic and early Neolithic. Prehistoric Celtic art comes from much of Iron Age Europe and survives mainly in the form of high- status metalwork skillfully decorated with complex, elegant and mostly abstract designs, often using curving and spiral forms. There are human heads and some fully represented animals, but full-length human figures at any size are so rare that their absence may represent a religious taboo. As the Romans conquered Celtic territories, it almost entirely vanishes, but the style continued in limited use in the British Isles, and with the coming of Christianity revived there in the Insular style of the Early Middle Ages.

The Minoan culture existed in Crete and consisted of four periods: Prepalatial, Protopalatial, Neopalatial, and the Postpalatial period between 3650 BC and 1100 BC. Not much of the art remained from the Prepalatial times, and most of artefacts still existing today are Cycladic statuettes and pottery fragments. The most prosperous period of the Cretan civilization was Neopalatial period and most of the artefacts are from this era. A large number of artefacts from the Protopalatial can be seen today in Cretan museums. Pottery ‚Äì most popular in the Protopalatial period (1900-1700 BC) ‚Äì was characterized by thin walled vessels, subtle, symmetrical shapes, elegant spouts, and decorations, and dynamic lines. Dark and light values were often contrasted in Minoan pottery. The spontaneity and fluidity of the Protopalatial period later were transformed to a more stylized form of art with dissociation of naturalism in the Neopalatial period. The palaces served as organizational, commercial, artistic, worshipping, and agricultural centres in the Cretan civilization. Cretan palaces were built without defensive walls and exhibited a central courtyard which was embraced by a number of buildings. The central courtyard served as the main meeting place of the people. The palaces had throne rooms, cult chambers, and theatres where people could gather at special events. Columns and staircases were part of the artistic expression and it is believed that they served as metaphorical elements. The Minoan palaces are richly painted with paintings. Minoan painting was unique in that it used wet fresco techniques; it was characterized by small waists, fluidity, and vitality of the figures and was seasoned with elasticity, spontaneity, vitality, and high-contrasting colours. Not much of the sculpture survived from the Minoan civilization. The best known example of sculptures is the Snake Goddess figurine. The sculpture depicts a goddess or a high priestess holding a snake in both hands, dressed in traditional Minoan attire, cloth covering the whole body and leaving the breasts exposed. Exquisite metal work was also a characteristic of the Minoan art. Minoan metal masters worked with imported gold and copper and mastered techniques of wax casting, embossing, gilding, nielo, and granulation.

The Parthenon is an example of their architecture that has lasted to modern days. Greek marble sculpture is often described as the highest form of Classical art. Painting on the pottery of Ancient Greece and ceramics gives a particularly informative glimpse into the way society in Ancient Greece functioned. Black-figure vase painting and Red-figure vase painting gives many surviving examples of what Greek painting was. Some famous Greek painters on wooden panels who are mentioned in texts are Apelles, Zeuxis and Parrhasius, however no examples of Ancient Greek panel painting survive, only written descriptions by their contemporaries or by later Romans. Zeuxis lived in 5‚Äì6 BC and was said to be the first to use sfumato. According to Pliny the Elder, the realism of his paintings was such that birds tried to eat the painted grapes. Apelles is described as the greatest painter of Antiquity for perfect technique in drawing, brilliant color and modeling.

Roman sculpture, is primarily portraiture derived from the upper classes of society as well as depictions of the gods. However, Roman painting does have important unique characteristics. Among surviving Roman paintings are wall paintings, many from villas in Campania, in Southern Italy, especially at Pompeii and Herculaneum. Such painting can be grouped into four main \\"styles\\" or periods and may contain the first examples of trompe-l'oeil, pseudo-perspective, and pure landscape. Almost all of the surviving painted portraits from the Ancient world are a large number of coffin-portraits of bust form found in the Late Antique cemetery of Al-Fayum. They give an idea of the quality that the finest ancient work must have had. A very small number of miniatures from Late Antique illustrated books also survive, and a rather larger number of copies of them from the Early Medieval period. Early Christian art grew out of Roman popular, and later Imperial, art and adapted its iconography from these sources.

Many had specific liturgical functions‚Äîprocessional crosses and altarpieces, for example. One of the central questions about Medieval art concerns its lack of realism. A great deal of knowledge of perspective in art and understanding of the human figure was lost with the fall of Rome. But realism was not the primary concern of Medieval artists. They were simply trying to send a religious message, a task which demands clear iconic images instead of precisely rendered ones. Time Period: 6th century to 15th century =Early Medieval art= Migration period art is a general term for the art of the \\"barbarian\\" peoples who moved into formerly Roman territories. Celtic art in the 7th and 8th centuries saw a fusion with Germanic traditions through contact with the Anglo-Saxons creating what is called the Hiberno-Saxon style or Insular art, which was to be highly influential on the rest of the Middle Ages. Merovingian art describes the art of the Franks before about 800, when Carolingian art combined insular influences with a self-conscious classical revival, developing into Ottonian art. Anglo-Saxon art is the art of England after the Insular period. Illuminated manuscripts contain nearly all the surviving painting of the period, but architecture, metalwork and small carved work in wood or ivory were also important media.

After 843 until 1453 there is a clear Byzantine art tradition. It is often the finest art of the Middle Ages in terms of quality of material and workmanship, with production centered on Constantinople. Byzantine art's crowning achievement were the monumental frescos and mosaics inside domed churches, most of which have not survived due to natural disasters and the appropriation of churches to mosques.

This was a period of increasing prosperity, and the first to see a coherent style used across Europe, from Scandinavia to Switzerland. Romanesque art is vigorous and direct, was originally brightly coloured, and is often very sophisticated. Stained glass and enamel on metalwork became important media, and larger sculptures in the round developed, although high relief was the principal technique. Its architecture is dominated by thick walls, and round- headed windows and arches, with much carved decoration.

The term originated with Gothic architecture in 1140, but Gothic painting did not appear until around 1200 (this date has many qualifications), when it diverged from Romanesque style. Gothic sculpture was born in France in 1144 with the renovation of the Abbey Church of S. Denis and spread throughout Europe, by the 13th century it had become the international style, replacing Romanesque. International Gothic describes Gothic art from about 1360 to 1430, after which Gothic art merges into Renaissance art at different times in different places. During this period forms such as painting, in fresco and on panel, become newly important, and the end of the period includes new media such as prints.

The drawing is inspired and subsequently named after the 1st century BC Roman architect-author Vitruvius and his notions on the \\"ideal\\" human body proportions, found in his De architectura. The drawing highlights the movement's fascination with Graeco-Roman civilisations and appropriation of classical art, as well as his pursuit for the correlation between body structure and nature. The Renaissance is characterized by a focus on the arts of Ancient Greece and Rome, which led to many changes in both the technical aspects of painting and sculpture, as well as to their subject matter. It began in Italy, a country rich in Roman heritage as well as material prosperity to fund artists. During the Renaissance, painters began to enhance the realism of their work by using new techniques in perspective, thus representing three dimensions more authentically. Artists also began to use new techniques in the manipulation of light and darkness, such as the tone contrast evident in many of Titian's portraits and the development of sfumato and chiaroscuro by Leonardo da Vinci. Sculptors, too, began to rediscover many ancient techniques such as contrapposto. Following with the humanist spirit of the age, art became more secular in subject matter, depicting ancient mythology in addition to Christian themes. This genre of art is often referred to as Renaissance Classicism. In the North, the most important Renaissance innovation was the widespread use of oil paints, which allowed for greater colour and intensity. =From Gothic to the Renaissance= During the late 13th century and early 14th century, much of the painting in Italy was Byzantine in character, notably that of Duccio of Siena and Cimabue of Florence, while Pietro Cavallini in Rome was more Gothic in style. During the 13th century, Italian sculptors began to draw inspiration not only from medieval prototypes, but also from ancient works. In 1290, Giotto began painting in a manner that was less traditional and more based upon observation of nature. His famous cycle at the Scrovegni Chapel, Padua, is seen as the beginnings of a Renaissance style. Other painters of the 14th century were carried the Gothic style to great elaboration and detail. Notable among these painters are Simone Martini and Gentile da Fabriano. In the Netherlands, the technique of painting in oils rather than tempera, led itself to a form of elaboration that was not dependent upon the application of gold leaf and embossing, but upon the minute depiction of the natural world. The art of painting textures with great realism evolved at this time. Dutch painters such as Jan van Eyck and Hugo van der Goes were to have great influence on Late Gothic and Early Renaissance painting. =Early Renaissance= The ideas of the Renaissance first emerged in the city-state of Florence, Italy. The sculptor Donatello returned to classical techniques such as contrapposto and classical subjects like the unsupported nude‚Äîhis second sculpture of David was the first free-standing bronze nude created in Europe since the Roman Empire. The sculptor and architect Brunelleschi studied the architectural ideas of ancient Roman buildings for inspiration. Masaccio perfected elements like composition, individual expression, and human form to paint frescoes, especially those in the Brancacci Chapel, of surprising elegance, drama, and emotion. A remarkable number of these major artists worked on different portions of the Florence Cathedral. Brunelleschi's dome for the cathedral was one of the first truly revolutionary architectural innovations since the Gothic flying buttress. Donatello created many of its sculptures.

The 15th-century artistic developments in Italy (for example, the interest in perspectival systems, in depicting anatomy, and in classical cultures) matured during the 16th century, accounting for the designations \\"Early Renaissance\\" for the 15th century and \\"High Renaissance\\" for the 16th century. Although no singular style characterizes the High Renaissance, the art of those most closely associated with this period‚ÄîLeonardo da Vinci, Raphael, Michelangelo, and Titian‚Äîexhibits an astounding mastery, both technical and aesthetic. High Renaissance artists created works of such authority that generations of later artists relied on these artworks for instruction. These exemplary artistic creations further elevated the prestige of artists. Artists could claim divine inspiration, thereby raising visual art to a status formerly given only to poetry. Thus, painters, sculptors, and architects came into their own, successfully claiming for their work a high position among the fine arts. In a sense, 16th- century masters created a new profession with its own rights of expression and its own venerable character.

Hieronymus Bosch (1450?‚Äì1516), a Dutch painter, is another important figure in the Northern Renaissance. In his paintings, he used religious themes, but combined them with grotesque fantasies, colorful imagery, and peasant folk legends. His paintings often reflect the confusion and anguish associated with the end of the Middle Ages. Albrecht D√ºrer introduced Italian Renaissance style to Germany at the end of the 15th century, and dominated German Renaissance art.

Mannerism, a reaction against the idealist perfection of Classicism, employed distortion of light and spatial frameworks in order to emphasize the emotional content of a painting and the emotions of the painter. The work of El Greco is a particularly clear example of Mannerism in painting during the late 16th, early 17th centuries. Northern Mannerism took longer to develop, and was largely a movement of the last half of the 16th century. Baroque art took the representationalism of the Renaissance to new heights, emphasizing detail, movement, lighting, and drama in their search for beauty. Perhaps the best known Baroque painters are Caravaggio, Rembrandt, Peter Paul Rubens, and Diego Vel√°zquez. A rather different art developed out of northern realist traditions in 17th-century Dutch Golden Age painting, which had very little religious art, and little history painting, instead playing a crucial part in developing secular genres such as still life, genre paintings of everyday scenes, and landscape painting. While the Baroque nature of Rembrandt's art is clear, the label is less use for Vermeer and many other Dutch artists. Flemish Baroque painting shared a part in this trend, while also continuing to produce the traditional categories. Baroque art is often seen as part of the Counter-Reformation‚Äîthe artistic element of the revival of spiritual life in the Roman Catholic Church. Additionally, the emphasis that Baroque art placed on grandeur is seen as Absolutist in nature. Religious and political themes were widely explored within the Baroque artistic context, and both paintings and sculptures were characterised by a strong element of drama, emotion and theatricality. Famous Baroque artists include Caravaggio or Rubens. Artemisia Gentileschi was another noteworthy artist, who was inspired by Caravaggio's style. Baroque art was particularly ornate and elaborate in nature, often using rich, warm colours with dark undertones. Pomp and grandeur were important elements of the Baroque artistic movement in general, as can be seen when Louis XIV said, \\"I am grandeur incarnate\\"; many Baroque artists served kings who tried to realize this goal. Baroque art in many ways was similar to Renaissance art; as a matter of fact, the term was initially used in a derogative manner to describe post-Renaissance art and architecture which was over-elaborate. Baroque art can be seen as a more elaborate and dramatic re-adaptation of late Renaissance art. By the 18th century, however, Baroque art was falling out of fashion as many deemed it too melodramatic and also gloomy, and it developed into the Rococo, which emerged in France. Rococo art was even more elaborate than the Baroque, but it was less serious and more playful. Whilst the Baroque used rich, strong colours, Rococo used pale, creamier shades. The artistic movement no longer placed an emphasis on politics and religion, focusing instead on lighter themes such as romance, celebration, and appreciation of nature. Rococo art also contrasted the Baroque as it often refused symmetry in favor of asymmetrical designs. Furthermore, it sought inspiration from the artistic forms and ornamentation of Far Eastern Asia, resulting in the rise in favour of porcelain figurines and chinoiserie in general. The 18th-century style flourished for a short while; nevertheless, the Rococo style soon fell out of favor, being seen by many as a gaudy and superficial movement emphasizing aesthetics over meaning. Neoclassicism in many ways developed as a counter movement of the Rococo, the impetus being a sense of disgust directed towards the latter's florid qualities. =Mannerism (16th century)= Jacopo Pontormo - Kreuzabnahme Christi.jpgEntombment; by Jacopo da Pontormo; 1525-1528; oil on panel; 3.12 x 1.9 m; Santa Felicita (Florence, Italy) Parmigianino - Madonna dal collo lungo - Google Art Project.jpgMadonna with the Long Neck; by Parmigianino; 1534-1540; oil on panel; 2.19 x 1.32 m; Uffizi Gallery (Florence) Angelo Bronzino - Venus, Cupid, Folly and Time - National Gallery, London.jpgVenus, Cupid, Folly and Time; by Bronzino; mid-1540s; oil on panel; 1.46 x 1.16 m; National Gallery (London) Giuseppe Arcimboldo - Summer - Google Art Project.jpgSummer; by Giuseppe Arcimboldo; 1563; oil on panel; 67 x 50.8 cm; Kunsthistorisches Museum (Vienna, Austria) =Baroque (early 17th century to mid-early 18th century)= Peter Paul Rubens - The Four Continents.jpgThe Four Continents; by Peter Paul Rubens; circa 1615; oil on canvas; 209 x 284 cm; Kunsthistorisches Museum (Vienna, Austria) Olanda, guardaroba (kast), 1625-50 ca.jpgDutch wardrobe; 1625-1650; oak with ebony and rosewood veneers; overall: 244.5 x 224.3 x 85.2 cm; Cleveland Museum of Art (Cleveland, Ohio, US) La ronda de noche, por Rembrandt van Rijn.jpgThe Night Watch; by Rembrandt; 1642; oil on canvas; 363 √ó 437 cm; Rijksmuseum (Amsterdam, the Netherlands) Ecstasy of St. Teresa HDR.jpgThe Ecstasy of Saint Teresa; by Gian Lorenzo Bernini; 1647‚Äì1652; marble; height: 3.5 m; Santa Maria della Vittoria (Rome) Las Meninas, by Diego Vel√°zquez, from Prado in Google Earth.jpgLas Meninas; by Diego Vel√°zquez; 1656‚Äì1657; oil on canvas; 318 cm √ó 276 cm; Museo del Prado (Madrid, Spain) Cour de Marbre du Ch√¢teau de Versailles October 5, 2011.jpgThe entrance of the Palace of Versailles (Versailles, France), the most iconic Baroque building LouisXIV- Bernini.jpgThe 'Bust of Louis XIV; by Gian Lorenzo Bernini; 1665; marble; 105 √ó 99 √ó 46 cm; Palace of Versailles Jan Vermeer - The Art of Painting - Google Art Project.jpgThe Art of Painting; by Johannes Vermeer; 1666-1668; oil on canvas; 1.3 x 1.1 m; Kunsthistorisches Museum Carpet with Fame and Fortitude MET DP212204.jpgCarpet with fame and fortitude; 1668-1685; knotted and cut wool pile, woven with about 90 knots per square inch; 909.3 x 459.7 cm; Metropolitan Museum of Art Dome of Church of the Ges√π (Rome).jpgDome of the Church of the Ges√π (Rome), made in 1674 by Giovanni Battista Gaulli Louis XIV of France.jpgThe Portrait of Louis XIV; by Hyacinthe Rigaud; 1701; oil on canvas; 277 √ó 194 cm; Louvre Karlskirche Vienna June 2006 475.jpgThe Karlskirche in Vienna (Austria), built between 1716 and 1737 =Rococo (early to mid-18th century)= Chinesisches Teehaus Potsdam IMG 3489.jpgThe Chinese House, a chinoiserie garden pavilion in Sanssouci Park, from Potsdam (Germany) Stift Wilhering Kirche Orgel 01.jpgThe amazing interior of the Wilhering Abbey (Wilhering, Austria).

In the image Antonio Canova's Psyche Revived by Cupid's Kiss (1787-1793) Throughout the 18th century, a counter movement opposing the Rococo sprang up in different parts of Europe, commonly known as Neoclassicism. It despised the perceived superficiality and frivolity of Rococo art, and desired for a return to the simplicity, order and 'purism' of classical antiquity, especially ancient Greece and Rome. The movement was in part also influenced by the Renaissance, which itself was strongly influenced by classical art. Neoclassicism was the artistic component of the intellectual movement known as the Enlightenment; the Enlightenment was idealistic, and put its emphasis on objectivity, reason and empirical truth. Neoclassicism had become widespread in Europe throughout the 18th century, especially in the United Kingdom, which saw great works of Neoclassical architecture spring up during this period; Neoclassicism's fascination with classical antiquity can be seen in the popularity of the Grand Tour during this decade, where wealthy aristocrats travelled to the ancient ruins of Italy and Greece. Nevertheless, a defining moment for Neoclassicism came during the French Revolution in the late 18th century; in France, Rococo art was replaced with the preferred Neoclassical art, which was seen as more serious than the former movement. In many ways, Neoclassicism can be seen as a political movement as well as an artistic and cultural one. Neoclassical art places an emphasis on order, symmetry and classical simplicity; common themes in Neoclassical art include courage and war, as were commonly explored in ancient Greek and Roman art. Ingres, Canova, and Jacques-Louis David are among the best-known neoclassicists.James J. Sheehan, \\"Art and Its Publics, c. 1800,\\" United and Diversity in European Culture c. 1800, ed. Tim Blanning and Hagen Schulze (New York: Oxford University Press, 2006), 5-18. Eug√®ne Delacroix, Liberty Leading the People 1830, Romantic art. Just as Mannerism rejected Classicism, so did Romanticism reject the ideas of the Enlightenment and the aesthetic of the Neoclassicists. Romanticism rejected the highly objective and ordered nature of Neoclassicism, and opted for a more individual and emotional approach to the arts. Romanticism placed an emphasis on nature, especially when aiming to portray the power and beauty of the natural world, and emotions, and sought a highly personal approach to art. Romantic art was about individual feelings, not common themes, such as in Neoclassicism; in such a way, Romantic art often used colours in order to express feelings and emotion. Similarly to Neoclassicism, Romantic art took much of its inspiration from ancient Greek and Roman art and mythology, yet, unlike Neoclassical, this inspiration was primarily used as a way to create symbolism and imagery. Romantic art also takes much of its aesthetic qualities from medievalism and Gothicism, as well as mythology and folklore. Among the greatest Romantic artists were Eug√®ne Delacroix, Francisco Goya, J.M.W. Turner, John Constable, Caspar David Friedrich, Thomas Cole, and William Blake. Most artists attempted to take a centrist approach which adopted different features of Neoclassicist and Romanticist styles, in order to synthesize them. The different attempts took place within the French Academy, and collectively are called Academic art. Adolphe William Bouguereau is considered a chief example of this stream of art. In the early 19th century the face of Europe, however, became radically altered by industrialization. Poverty, squalor, and desperation were to be the fate of the new working class created by the \\"revolution\\". In response to these changes going on in society, the movement of Realism emerged. Realism sought to accurately portray the conditions and hardships of the poor in the hopes of changing society. In contrast with Romanticism, which was essentially optimistic about mankind, Realism offered a stark vision of poverty and despair. Similarly, while Romanticism glorified nature, Realism portrayed life in the depths of an urban wasteland. Like Romanticism, Realism was a literary as well as an artistic movement. The great Realist painters include Jean- Baptiste-Sim√©on Chardin, Gustave Courbet, Jean-Fran√ßois Millet, Camille Corot, Honor√© Daumier, √âdouard Manet, Edgar Degas (both considered as Impressionists), and Thomas Eakins, among others. The response of architecture to industrialisation, in stark contrast to the other arts, was to veer towards historicism. Although the railway stations built during this period are often considered the truest reflections of its spirit ‚Äì they are sometimes called \\"the cathedrals of the age\\" ‚Äì the main movements in architecture during the Industrial Age were revivals of styles from the distant past, such as the Gothic Revival. Related movements were the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, who attempted to return art to its state of \\"purity\\" prior to Raphael, and the Arts and Crafts Movement, which reacted against the impersonality of mass- produced goods and advocated a return to medieval craftsmanship. Time Period: *Neoclassicism: mid-early 18th century to early 19th century *Romanticism: late 18th century to mid-19th century *Realism: 19th century Modern art Impressionism was known for its usage of light and movement in its paintings, as in Claude Monet's 1902 Houses of Parliament, sunset 299x299px Out of the naturalist ethic of Realism grew a major artistic movement, Impressionism. The Impressionists pioneered the use of light in painting as they attempted to capture light as seen from the human eye. Edgar Degas, √âdouard Manet, Claude Monet, Camille Pissarro, and Pierre-Auguste Renoir, were all involved in the Impressionist movement. As a direct outgrowth of Impressionism came the development of Post-Impressionism. Paul C√©zanne, Vincent van Gogh, Paul Gauguin, Georges Seurat are the best known Post-Impressionists. Following the Impressionists and the Post-Impressionists came Fauvism, often considered the first \\"modern\\" genre of art. Just as the Impressionists revolutionized light, so did the fauvists rethink color, painting their canvases in bright, wild hues. After the Fauvists, modern art began to develop in all its forms, ranging from Expressionism, concerned with evoking emotion through objective works of art, to Cubism, the art of transposing a four-dimensional reality onto a flat canvas, to Abstract art. These new art forms pushed the limits of traditional notions of \\"art\\" and corresponded to the similar rapid changes that were taking place in human society, technology, and thought. Surrealism is often classified as a form of Modern Art. However, the Surrealists themselves have objected to the study of surrealism as an era in art history, claiming that it oversimplifies the complexity of the movement (which they say is not an artistic movement), misrepresents the relationship of surrealism to aesthetics, and falsely characterizes ongoing surrealism as a finished, historically encapsulated era. Other forms of Modern art (some of which border on Contemporary art) include: * Abstract expressionism * Art Deco * Art Nouveau * Bauhaus * Color Field painting * Conceptual Art * Constructivism * Cubism * Dada * Der Blaue Reiter * De Stijl * Die Br√ºcke * Body Art * Expressionism * Fauvism * Fluxus * Futurism * Happening * Surrealism * Lettrisme * Lyrical Abstraction * Land Art * Minimalism * Naive art * Op art * Performance art * Photorealism * Pop art * Suprematism * Video art * Vorticism Time Period: * Impressionism: late 19th Century * Others: First half of the 20th century Contemporary art and Postmodern art Charles Thomson. Sir Nicholas Serota Makes an Acquisitions Decision, 2000, Stuckism. Modern art foreshadowed several characteristics of what would later be defined as postmodern art; as a matter of fact, several modern art movements can often be classified as both modern and postmodern, such as pop art. Postmodern art, for instance, places a strong emphasis on irony, parody and humour in general; modern art started to develop a more ironic approach to art which would later advance in a postmodern context. Postmodern art sees the blurring between the high and fine arts with low-end and commercial art; modern art started to experiment with this blurring. Recent developments in art have been characterised by a significant expansion of what can now deemed to be art, in terms of materials, media, activity and concept. Conceptual art in particular has had a wide influence. This started literally as the replacement of concept for a made object, one of the intentions of which was to refute the commodification of art. However, it now usually refers to an artwork where there is an object, but the main claim for the work is made for the thought process that has informed it. The aspect of commercialism has returned to the work. There has also been an increase in art referring to previous movements and artists, and gaining validity from that reference. Postmodernism in art, which has grown since the 1960s, differs from Modernism in as much as Modern art movements were primarily focused on their own activities and values, while Postmodernism uses the whole range of previous movements as a reference point. This has by definition generated a relativistic outlook, accompanied by irony and a certain disbelief in values, as each can be seen to be replaced by another. Another result of this has been the growth of commercialism and celebrity. Postmodern art has questioned common rules and guidelines of what is regarded as 'fine art', merging low art with the fine arts until none is fully distinguishable.Ideas About Art, Desmond, Kathleen K. John Wiley & Sons, 2011, p.148International postmodernism: theory and literary practice, Bertens, Hans , Routledge, 1997, p.236 Before the advent of postmodernism, the fine arts were characterised by a form of aesthetic quality, elegance, craftsmanship, finesse and intellectual stimulation which was intended to appeal to the upper or educated classes; this distinguished high art from low art, which, in turn, was seen as tacky, kitsch, easily made and lacking in much or any intellectual stimulation, art which was intended to appeal to the masses. Postmodern art blurred these distinctions, bringing a strong element of kitsch, commercialism and campness into contemporary fine art; what is nowadays seen as fine art may have been seen as low art before postmodernism revolutionised the concept of what high or fine art truly is. In addition, the postmodern nature of contemporary art leaves a lot of space for individualism within the art scene; for instance, postmodern art often takes inspiration from past artistic movements, such as Gothic or Baroque art, and both juxtaposes and recycles styles from these past periods in a different context. Some surrealists in particular Joan Mir√≥, who called for the \\"murder of painting\\" (In numerous interviews dating from the 1930s onwards, Mir√≥ expressed contempt for conventional painting methods and his desire to \\"kill\\", \\"murder\\", or \\"rape\\" them in favor of more contemporary means of expression).M. Rowell, Joan Mirœå: Selected Writings and Interviews (London: Thames & Hudson, 1987) pp. 114‚Äì116. have denounced or attempted to \\"supersede\\" painting, and there have also been other anti-painting trends among artistic movements, such as that of Dada and conceptual art. The trend away from painting in the late 20th century has been countered by various movements, for example the continuation of Minimal Art, Lyrical Abstraction, Pop Art, Op Art, New Realism, Photorealism, Neo Geo, Neo-expressionism, New European Painting, Stuckism and various other important and influential painterly directions.

It is cultivated commercially in tropical and subtropical areas for its sweet, seedy fruit. The fruit is a pepo, a type of berry, round to oval, either yellow or dark purple at maturity, with a soft to firm, juicy interior filled with numerous seeds. The fruit is both eaten and juiced, the juice often added to other fruit juices to enhance aroma. Etymology The passion fruit is so called because it is one of the many species of passion flower, the English translation of the Latin genus name, Passiflora. Around 1700, the name was given by missionaries in Brazil as an educational aid while trying to convert the indigenous inhabitants to Christianity; its name was flor das cinco chagas or \\"flower of the five wounds\\" to illustrate the crucifixion of Christ, with other plant components also named after an emblem in the Passion of Jesus.  Description  P. edulis is a perennial vine; tendrils are borne in leaf axils, and have a red or purple hue when young. There are two main varieties: a purple-fruited type, P. edulis f. edulis, and the yellow-fruited P. edulis f. flavicarpa. Usually the vine produces a single flower 5‚Äì7.5 cm wide at each node. The flower has 5 oblong, green sepals and 5 white petals. The sepals and petals are 4-6mm in length and form a fringe. The base of the flower is a rich purple with 5 stamens, an ovary, and a branched style. The styles bend backward and the anthers, which are located on top of the styles, have a very distinct head. The fruit produced is entirely fleshy (making it botanically a berry), and is spherical to ovoid. The outside color of the berry ranges from dark-purple with fine white specks to light yellow. The fruit is 4‚Äî7.5 cm in diameter; purple fruits are smaller, weighing around 35 grams, while yellow fruits are closer to 80 grams. The smooth, leathery rind is 9‚Äì13 mm thick, including a thick layer of pith. Within the berry, there are typically 250 black seeds, each 2.4 mm in length. Each seed is surrounded by a membranous sac filled with pulpy juice. The flavor of the juice is slightly acidic and musky. The passion fruit's flavor can be compared to the guava fruit. = Varieties = Several distinct varieties of passion fruit with clearly differing exterior appearances exist. The bright yellow flavicarpa variety, also known as yellow or golden passionfruit, can grow up to the size of a grapefruit, has a smooth, glossy, light and airy rind, and has been used as a rootstock for purple passionfruit in Australia. The dark purple edulis variety is smaller than a lemon, though it is less acidic than yellow passionfruit, and has a richer aroma and flavour.  Uses  A passionfruit drink at a restaurant in Singapore Passion fruit oil and cross-section of passion fruit, showing seeds Passion fruit has a variety of uses related to its appealing taste as a whole fruit and juice. * In Australia and New Zealand, it is available commercially both fresh and tinned. It is added to fruit salads, and fresh fruit pulp or passion fruit sauce is commonly used in desserts, including as a topping for pavlova (a regional meringue cake) and ice cream, a flavouring for cheesecake, and in the icing of vanilla slices. A passionfruit-flavored soft drink called Passiona has also been manufactured in Australia since the 1920s. It can be used in some alcoholic cocktails. * In Brazil, the term applies to passion fruit (, or \\"sour\\") and granadillo (, or \\"sweet\\"). Passion fruit mousse is a common dessert, and passion fruit pulp is routinely used to decorate the tops of cakes. Passion fruit juice, ice pops and more recently soft drinks are also popular. When making caipirinha, one may use passion fruit instead of lime. * In Colombia, it is one of the most important fruits, especially for juices and desserts. It is widely available all over the country and three kinds of \\"maracuy√°\\" fruit may be found. * In the Dominican Republic, where it is locally called chinola, it is used to make juice and Fruit preserves. Passion fruit-flavored syrup is used on shaved ice, and the fruit is also eaten raw, sprinkled with sugar. * In East Africa, passion fruit is used to make fruit juice and is commonly eaten as a whole fruit. * In Hawaii, where it is known as liliko'i, passion fruit can be cut in half and the seeds scooped out with a spoon. Lilikoi-flavoured syrup is a popular topping for shave ice. It is used as a dessert flavouring for malasadas, cheesecakes, cookies, ice cream and mochi. Passion fruit is also favoured as a jam or jelly, as well as a butter. Lilikoi syrup can also be used to glaze or to marinate meat and vegetables. * In India, the government of Andhra Pradesh started growing passion fruit vines in the Chintapalli (Vizag) forests to make fruit available within the region. The fruit is eaten raw, sprinkled with sugar and is also used to make juice. * In Indonesia, there are two types of passion fruit (local name: markisa), white flesh and yellow flesh. The white one is normally eaten straight as a fruit, while the yellow variety is commonly strained to obtain its juice, which is cooked with sugar to make thick syrup. * In Mexico, passion fruit is used to make juice or is eaten raw with chilli powder and lime. * In Paraguay, passion fruit is used principally for its juice, to prepare desserts such as passion fruit mousse, cheesecake, ice cream, and to flavour yogurts and cocktails. * In Peru, passion fruit has long been a staple in homemade ice pops called \\"marciano\\" or \\"chupetes\\". Passion fruit is also used in several desserts, especially mousses and cheesecakes. Passion fruit juice is also drunk on its own and is used in ceviche variations and in cocktails, including the Maracuy√° sour, a variation of the Pisco sour. (, or \\"sweet\\") can be eaten raw. * In the Philippines, passion fruit is commonly sold in public markets and in public schools. Some vendors sell the fruit with a straw to enable sucking out the seeds and juices inside. * In Portugal, especially the Azores and Madeira, passion fruit is used as a base for a variety of liqueurs and mousses. * In Puerto Rico, where the fruit is known as \\"parcha\\", it is used in juices, ice cream or pastries. * In South Africa, passion fruit, known locally as Granadilla (the yellow variety as Guavadilla), is used to flavour yogurt. It is also used to flavour soft drinks such as Schweppes' \\"Sparkling Granadilla\\" and numerous cordial drinks (in cordial flavours it is referred to as passion fruit). It is often eaten raw or used as a topping for cakes and tarts. Granadilla juice is commonly available in restaurants. The yellow variety is used for juice processing, while the purple variety is sold in fresh-fruit markets. * In Sri Lanka, passion fruit juice, along with faluda, is one of the most popular refreshments. Passion fruit cordial is manufactured both at home as well as industrially by mixing the pulp with sugar. = Nutrition = Raw passion fruit is 73% water, 22% carbohydrates, 2% protein and 0.7% fat (table). In a 50 gram amount (roughly the size of one fruit), fresh passion fruit contains 18% of the Daily Value (DV) of vitamin C, 21% dietary fiber, B vitamins riboflavin (5.5% DV) and niacin (5% DV), 6% iron and 5% phosphorus (right table). No other micronutrients are in significant content. Several varieties of passionfruit are rich in polyphenol content, and yellow varieties of the fruit were found to contain prunasin and other cyanogenic glycosides in the peel and juice.  Cultivation  Passion fruit is widely grown in tropical and semitropical regions of the world. In the United States, it is grown in Florida, Hawaii, and California. They generally have to be protected from frost, although certain cultivars have survived light frosts after heavy pruning of affected areas. = Pollination = The flower of the yellow- fruited form of the passion fruit plant is self-sterile, while that of the purple-fruited form is self-compatible. In California, it is reported that Pollination of flowers is most effective when done by the carpenter bee. There are three types of yellow passion fruit flowers, classified by curvature of style. To help assure the presence of carpenter bees, place decaying logs near the vines, which provide shelter for the bees. = Diseases =  Viruses  Passion fruit woodiness virus is one of the most well known viruses to the passion fruit. It belongs to the Potyvirus group and can attack a plant at any age from nursery to mature plants. Some features include yellow leaves that display distortion in the leaf length and shape. As well as affecting the leaf, this virus influences fruit shape and size. Affected fruits become stone-like and much smaller than normal, with many fruits becoming scabbed and cracked. The virus is spread by sap-sucking insects such as aphids and mites. Woodiness can also spread through vegetation propagation such as infected scions or contaminated tools. There is no chemical control for this virus once the plant is infected, but the use of clean planting material can reduce its dissemination. One of the most serious viruses pertaining to vegetation is the Cucumber mosaic virus. In the passion fruit, this virus appears with yellow mottling on leaves starting at random points on the vine and diminishing in intensity towards the tip. Expanding leaves typically become twisted, curl downward, and develop a \\"shoestring\\" appearance as a result of a restriction of the leaf surface. It is mobile and can spread easily through interactions with other plants such as brushing between leaves. This virus is naturally transmitted through aphids and can also be transmitted mechanically through seedlings. Varietal resistance is the primary management tool, and eliminating weeds and infected perennial ornamentals that may harbor the virus is critical. Once the plant has been infected, there is no possible management of control for the virus.  Phytoplasma  Overshooting is the term used when Phytoplasma, a specialized bacterium, attacks the phloem of a plant. Phytoplasma infection is characterized by chlorotic small leaves, shortening of internodes, excessive lateral shoots and abnormal flowers. Although there have been reports of this disease within the passion fruit plant, many infected plants are affected without visible signs of disease. Although Phytoplasma can be spread through grafting, it can be inhibited by periodic inspection of plant nurseries and areas that have had past infections. Overshooting responds to treatment with tetracycline, a common broad-spectrum antibiotic.  Bacteria  Bacterial leaf spot, which causes vein clearing, forms bright yellow colonies causing infection and leaf wilt and, eventually, deterioration of fruit pulp, especially of young fruits. Under favorable conditions for the bacteria, infection occurs through natural openings or wounds from other pathogens that affect leaf inter-cellular spaces. Fertilizers or a copper chloride and mancozeb mixture can control the intensity of the disease, but are not a cure. The bacterial grease-spot of the passion fruit is caused by Pseudomonas syringae. It appears with olive-green to brown greasy-looking spots or brown, sunken circular lesions. On a later stage, a hard crust can cover the lesions showing a chlorotic halo. Affecting mainly the stomata, the grease-spot thrives in high temperatures and high relative humidity. To avoid infection, measures that may be adopted include planting seeds from healthy plants and using existing healthy areas. Fungicide controls can aid in preventing further infection.  Fungal diseases  Collar rot disease is caused by the fungus Fusarium solani. It is characterized by necrotic lesions at the collar region, browning of the stem at soil level, and dark discoloration of the stem. The rotting stem interferes with food and water transport within the plant, leading to withering of the plant until death. Infection occurs mostly through contaminated soil and infected plants which cause the plants to survive for only a few weeks. There are no chemical controls. Management includes planting seedlings in unaffected areas and using clean tools. The fungus called fusarium wilt commonly occurs in adult plants and is caused by Fusarium oxysporum. The pathogen has ability to survive for long periods, penetrating roots, invading the xylem and preventing the transport of water and nutrients to other organs of the plant. Once infected, this disease causes leaves to yellow and browning of the vascular system until it wilts and dies. It occurs in any type of soil infecting all plants. Management of crops include planting clean seedlings, uprooting and burning infected plants, and using sterilized tools. The anthracnose, a canker caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporiodes, is a pathogen of the passion fruit creating dark and sunken lesions of the trunk. By attacking mature passion fruit trees, these lesions cause intense defoliation and fruit rot. Many leaves die due to the foliar lesions and the skin of fruits becomes papery. Under warm and humid conditions, this disease can worsen, causing red and orange spores eventually killing the plant. Infection is carried out through the residues of the passion flower, infected seeds, seedlings, and cuttings. Managing this disease involves a combination of using pathogen-free seedlings, eliminating infected areas, and improving ventilation and light conditions. Copper-based fungicides on injured areas can prevent the spread of disease.  In culture  Passion fruit flower is the national flower of Paraguay.

The Shakyas formed an independent oligarchic republican state known as ≈öƒÅkya Ga·πáarƒÅjya. Its capital was Kapilavastu, which may have been located either in present-day Tilaurakot, Nepal or present-day Piprahwa, India. Gautama Buddha (c. 6th to 4th centuries BCE), whose teachings became the foundation of Buddhism, was the best-known Shakya.

Buddhagho·π£a's work (II, 1‚Äì24) traces the origin of the Shakyas to king Ikshvaku and gives their genealogy from Maha Sammata, an ancestor of Ikshvaku. This list comprises the names of a number of prominent kings of the Ikshvaku dynasty, which include Mandhata and Sagara. According to this text, Okkamukha was the eldest son of Ikshvaku. Sivisamjaya and Sihassara were the son and grandson of Okkamukha. King Sihassara had eighty-two thousand sons and grandsons, who were together known as the Shakyas. The youngest son of Sihassara was Jayasena. Jayasena had a son, Sihahanu, and a daughter, Yashodhara (not to be confused with Prince Siddhartha's wife), who was married to Devadahasakka. Devadahasakka had two daughters, Anjana and Kaccana. Sihahanu married Kaccana, and they had five sons and two daughters; Suddhodana was one of them. Suddhodana had two queens, Maya and Prajapati, both daughters of Anjana. Siddhartha (Gautama Buddha) was the son of Suddhodana and Maya. Rahula was the son of Siddhartha and Yashodara (also known as Bhaddakaccana), daughter of Suppabuddha and granddaughter of A√±jana.Misra, VS (2007).

Thomas, The Life of Buddha p. 22 Map of mahajanapadas with the Shakya Republic next to Shravasti and Kosala. =Shakya administration= The Shakya republic functioned as an oligarchy, ruled by an elite council of the warrior and ministerial class that chose its leader.Gombrich, 1988, pp. 49-50Hirakawa, 2007, p. 21 According to the MahƒÅvastu and the Lalitavistara S≈´tra, the seat of the Shakya administration was the santhagara (\\"assembly hall\\") at Kapilavastu. A new building for the Shakya santhagara was constructed at the time of Gautama Buddha, which was inaugurated by him. The highest administrative authority was the sidharth, comprising 500 members, which met in the santhagara to transact any important business. The Shakya Parishad was headed by an elected raja, who presided over the meetings. By the time of Siddharta's birth, the Shakya republic had become a vassal state of the larger Kingdom of Kosala. The raja, once chosen, would only take office upon the approval of the King of Kosala. While the raja must have held considerable authority in the Shakya homeland, backed by the power of the King of Kosala, he did not rule autocratically. Questions of consequence were debated in the santhagara, in which, though open to all, only members of the warrior class (\\"rajana\\") were permitted to speak. Rather than a majority vote, decisions were made by consensus.Schumann, 2016, p. 18 = Annexation by Kosala = Virudhaka, son of Pasenadi and , the servant of a Shakyan chief named , ascended the throne of Kosala after overthrowing his father.

The Shakyas were by tradition sun worshippers,Batchelor, 2015, Chapter 2, section 1, paragraph 10 who called themselves ƒÄdicca nƒÅma gottena (\\"kinsmen of the sun\\") and descendants of the sun. As Buddha states in the Sutta-NipƒÅta, \\"They are of the sun-lineage (adiccagotta), Sakiyans by birth.\\"Batchelor, 2015, Chapter 2, section 2, paragraph 2 It is uncertain whether, by the time of Siddhartha's birth, Vedic Brahmanism had been adopted to any significant extent by the Shakyans. Scholar Johannes Bronkhorst argues, \\"I do not deny that many vedic texts existed already, in oral form, at the time when Buddha was born. However, the bearers of this tradition, the Brahmins, did not occupy a dominant position in the area in which the Buddha preached his message, and this message was not, therefore, a reaction against brahmanical thought and culture.\\" Purportedly, many Shakyans joined people from other regions and became followers of the Buddha during his lifetime, and many young Shakyan men left their homes to become monastics.  Claimed descents  Significant population of Newars of Kathmandu valley in Nepal use the surname Shakya and also claim to be the descendants of the Shakya clan with titles such as ≈öƒÅkyavamsa (of the Shakya lineage) having been used in the past. According to Hmannan Yazawin, first published in 1823, the legendary king Abhiyaza, who founded the Tagaung Kingdom and the Burmese monarchy belonged to the same Shakya clan of the Buddha. He migrated to present-day Burma after the annexation of the Shakya kingdom by Kosala. The earlier Burmese accounts stated that he was a descendant of Pyusawhti, son of a solar spirit and a dragon princess.

They are mostly tendril-bearing vines, with some being shrubs or trees. They can be woody or herbaceous. Passion flowers produce regular and usually showy flowers with a distinctive corona. The flower is pentamerous and ripens into an indehiscent fruit with numerous seeds. List of species A list of Passiflora species is found at List of Passiflora species. Distribution Passiflora has a largely neotropic distribution, unlike its family Passifloraceae, which includes more Old World species (such as the genus Adenia). The vast majority of Passiflora are found in Mexico, Central and South America, although there are additional representatives in the United States, Southeast Asia, and Oceania. New species continue to be identified: for example, P. xishuangbannaensis and P. pardifolia have only been known to the scientific community since 2005 and 2006, respectively. Some species of Passiflora have been naturalized beyond their native ranges. For example, the blue passion flower (P. caerulea) now grows wild in Spain.Dana et al. [2001] The purple passionfruit (P. edulis) and its yellow relative flavicarpa have been introduced in many tropical regions as commercial crops. Ecology Passion flowers have unique floral structures, which in most cases require biotic pollination. Pollinators of Passiflora include bumblebees, carpenter bees (e.g., Xylocopa sonorina), wasps, bats, and hummingbirds (especially hermits such as Phaethornis); some others are additionally capable of self- pollination. Passiflora often exhibit high levels of pollinator specificity, which has led to frequent coevolution across the genus. The sword-billed hummingbird (Ensifera ensifera) is a notable example: it, with its immensely elongated bill, is the sole pollinator of 37 species of high Andean Passiflora in the supersection Tacsonia. Bud of the passion flower Passion flower bloom in water The leaves are used for feeding by the larvae of a number of species of Lepidoptera. Famously, they are exclusively targeted by many butterfly species of the tribe Heliconiini. The many defensive adaptations visible on Passiflora include diverse leaf shapes (which help disguise their identity), colored nubs (which mimic butterfly eggs and can deter Heliconians from ovipositing on a seemingly crowded leaf), extrafloral nectaries, trichomes, variegation, and chemical defenses. These, combined with adaptations on the part of the butterflies, were important in the foundation of coevolutionary theory. The following lepidoptera larvae are known to feed on Passiflora: * Longwing butterflies (Heliconiinae) ** Cydno longwing (Heliconius cydno), one of few Heliconians to feed on multiple species of Passiflora ** Gulf fritillary (Agraulis vanillae), which feeds on several species of Passiflora, such as Passiflora lutea, Passiflora affinis, stinking passion flower (P. foetida),Soule, J.A. 2012. Butterfly Gardening in Southern Arizona. Tierra del Soule Press, Tucson, AZ and Maypop (P. incarnata) ** American Sara longwing (Heliconius sara) ** Red postman (Heliconius erato) ** Asian leopard lacewing (Cethosia cyane). ** Postman butterfly (Heliconius melpomene) prefer P. menispermifolia and P. oerstedii ** Zebra longwing (Heliconius charithonia) feed on yellow passion flower, two-flowered passion flower (P. biflora), and corky-stemmed passion flower (P. suberosa) ** Banded orange (Dryadula phaetusa) feed on P. tetrastylis ** Julia butterfly (Dryas iulia) feed on yellow passion flower and P. affinis * Swift moth Cibyra serta * Tawny Coster (Acraea terpsicore) feed on Passiflora edulis, Passiflora foetida, Passiflora subpeltata The generally high pollinator and parasite specificity in Passiflora may have led to the tremendous morphological variation in the genus. It is thought to have among the highest foliar diversity among all plant genera, with leaf shapes ranging from unlobed to five-lobed frequently found on the same plant. Coevolution can be a major driver of speciation, and may be responsible for the radiation of certain clades of Passiflora such as Tacsonia. The bracts of the stinking passion flower are covered by hairs which exude a sticky fluid. Many small insects get stuck to this and get digested to nutrient-rich goo by proteases and acid phosphatases. Since the insects usually killed are rarely major pests, this passion flower seems to be a protocarnivorous plant.Radhamani et al. (1995) Banana passion flower or \\"banana poka\\" (P. tarminiana), originally from Central Brazil, is an invasive weed, especially on the islands of Hawaii. It is commonly spread by feral pigs eating the fruits. It overgrows and smothers stands of endemic vegetation, mainly on roadsides. Blue passion flower (P. caerulea) is holding its own in Spain these days, and it probably needs to be watched so that unwanted spreading can be curtailed. On the other hand, some species are endangered due to unsustainable logging and other forms of habitat destruction. For example, the Chilean passion flower (P. pinnatistipula) is a rare vine growing in the Andes from Venezuela to Chile between 2,500 and 3,800 meters altitude, and in Coastal Central Chile, where it occurs in woody Chilean Mediterranean forests. P. pinnatistipula has a round fruit, unusual in Tacsonia group species like banana passion flower and P. mixta, with their elongated tubes and brightly red to rose-colored petals. Notable and sometimes economically significant pathogens of Passiflora are several sac fungi of the genus Septoria (including S. passiflorae), the undescribed proteobacterium called \\"Pseudomonas tomato\\" (pv. passiflorae), the Potyvirus passionfruit woodiness virus, and the Carlavirus Passiflora latent virus. Uses =Ornamental= Passiflora incarnata, one of the most common passion flowers Passiflora entwine this 1880 Baxter process illustration by Joseph Martin Kronheim A number of species of Passiflora are cultivated outside their natural range for both their flowers and fruit. Hundreds of hybrids have been named; hybridizing is currently being done extensively for flowers, foliage and fruit. The following hybrids and cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit: *'Amethyst' *P. √ó exoniensis (Exeter passion flower) *P. √ó violacea During the Victorian era the flower (which in all but a few species lasts only one day) was very popular, and many hybrids were created using the winged-stem passion flower (P. alata), the blue passion flower (P. caerulea) and other tropical species. Many cool-growing Passiflora from the Andes Mountains can be grown successfully for their beautiful flowers and fruit in cooler Mediterranean climates, such as the Monterey Bay and San Francisco in California and along the western coast of the U.S. into Canada. One blue passion flower or hybrid even grew to large size at Malm√∂ Central Station in Sweden.Petersen (1966) Passion flowers have been a subject of studies investigating extranuclear inheritance; paternal inheritance of chloroplast DNA has been documented in this genus.E.g. Hansen et al. (2006) The plastome of the two-flowered passion flower (P. biflora) has been sequenced. The French name for this plant has lent itself to La Famille Passiflore, a highly successful children's book series by Genevi√®ve Huriet, and an animated series based upon it. These have been translated into English as Beechwood Bunny Tales and The Bellflower Bunnies. =Fruit= Unripened Passiflora fruit Most species have round or elongated edible fruit from two to eight inches long and an inch to two inches across, depending upon the species or cultivar. * The passion fruit or maracuj√° (P. edulis) is cultivated extensively in the Caribbean, South America, south Florida and South Africa for its fruit, which is used as a source of juice. A small pink fruit that wrinkles easily and a larger shiny yellow to orange fruit are traded under this name. The latter is usually considered just a variety flavicarpa, but seems to be more distinct in fact. * Sweet granadilla (P. ligularis) is another widely grown species. In large parts of Africa and Australia it is the plant called \\"passionfruit\\": confusingly, in South African English the latter species is more often called \\"granadilla\\" (without an adjective). Its fruit is somewhat intermediate between the two sold as P. edulis. * Maypop (P. incarnata), a common species in the southeastern US. This is a subtropical representative of this mostly tropical family. However, unlike the more tropical cousins, this particular species is hardy enough to withstand the cold down to before its roots die (it is native as far north as Pennsylvania and has been cultivated as far north as Boston and Chicago.) The fruit is sweet, yellowish, and roughly the size of a chicken's egg; it enjoys some popularity as a native plant with edible fruit and few pests. * Giant granadilla (giant tumbo or badea, P. quadrangularis), water lemon (P. laurifolia) and sweet calabash (P. maliformis) are Passiflora species locally famed for their fruit, but not widely known elsewhere yet. * Wild maracuja are the fruit of P. foetida, which are popular in Southeast Asia. * Banana passionfruits are the very elongated fruits of P. tripartita var. mollissima and P. tarminiana. These are locally eaten, but their invasive properties make them a poor choice to grow outside of their native range. =Ayahuasca analog= A native source of beta-Carbolines (e.g., passion flower in North America) is mixed with Desmanthus illinoensis (Illinois bundleflower) root bark to produce a hallucinogenic drink called prairiehuasca, which is an analog of the shamanic brew ayahuasca. =Traditional medicine and dietary supplement= P. incarnata (maypop) leaves and roots have a long history of use as a traditional medicine by Native Americans in North America and were adapted by European colonists. The fresh or dried leaves of maypop are used to make a tea that is used as a sedative. Passionflower as dried powder or an extract is used as a dietary supplement. There is insufficient clinical evidence for using passionflower to treat any medical condition. Passionflower is classified as generally recognized as safe (GRAS) for use as a food ingredient in the United States. Adverse effects Passionflower is not recommended during pregnancy because it may induce contractions. Consuming passion flower products may cause drowsiness, nausea, dizziness, abnormal heart rhythms, asthma, or rhinitis. Chemistry Many species of Passiflora have been found to contain beta-carboline harmala alkaloids,Duke (2008) some of which are MAO inhibitors. The flower and fruit have only traces of these chemicals, but the leaves and the roots often contain more. The most common of these alkaloids is harman, but harmaline, harmalol, harmine, and harmol are also present. The species known to bear such alkaloids include: P. actinea, P. alata (winged-stem passion flower), P. alba, P. bryonioides (cupped passion flower), P. caerulea (blue passion flower), P. capsularis, P. decaisneana, P. edulis (passion fruit), P. eichleriana, P. foetida (stinking passion flower), P. incarnata (maypop), P. quadrangularis (giant granadilla), P. suberosa, P. subpeltata and P. warmingii. Other compounds found in passion flowers are coumarins (e.g. scopoletin and umbelliferone), maltol, phytosterols (e.g. lutenin) and cyanogenic glycosides (e.g. gynocardin) which render some species, i.e. P. adenopoda, somewhat poisonous. Many flavonoids and their glycosides have been found in Passiflora, including apigenin, benzoflavone, homoorientin, 7-isoorientin, isoshaftoside, isovitexin (or saponaretin), kaempferol, lucenin, luteolin, n-orientin, passiflorine (named after the genus), quercetin, rutin, saponarin, shaftoside, vicenin and vitexin. Maypop, blue passion flower (P. caerulea), and perhaps others contain the flavone chrysin. Also documented to occur at least in some Passiflora in quantity are the hydrocarbon nonacosane and the anthocyanidin pelargonidin-3-diglycoside.Dhawan, et al. (2002) The genus is rich in organic acids including formic, butyric, linoleic, linolenic, malic, myristic, oleic and palmitic acids as well as phenolic compounds, and the amino acid Œ±-alanine. Esters like ethyl butyrate, ethyl caproate, n-hexyl butyrate and n-hexyl caproate give the fruits their flavor and appetizing smell. Sugars, contained mainly in the fruit, are most significantly d-fructose, d-glucose and raffinose. Among enzymes, Passiflora was found to be rich in catalase, pectin methylesterase and phenolase. Etymology and names The \\"Passion\\" in \\"passion flower\\" refers to the passion of Jesus in Christian theology. In the 15th and 16th centuries, Spanish Christian missionaries adopted the unique physical structures of this plant, particularly the numbers of its various flower parts, as symbols of the last days of Jesus and especially his crucifixion: Blue passion flower (P. caerulea) showing most elements of the Christian symbolism * The pointed tips of the leaves were taken to represent the Holy Lance. * The tendrils represent the whips used in the flagellation of Christ. * The ten petals and sepals represent the ten faithful apostles (excluding St. Peter the denier and Judas Iscariot the betrayer). * The flower's radial filaments, which can number more than a hundred and vary from flower to flower, represent the crown of thorns. * The chalice-shaped ovary with its receptacle represents a hammer or the Holy Grail. * The 3 stigmas represent the 3 nails and the 5 anthers below them the 5 wounds (four by the nails and one by the lance). * The blue and white colors of many species' flowers represent Heaven and Purity. * In addition, the flower keeps open three days, symbolising the three years' ministry. The flower has been given names related to this symbolism throughout Europe since that time. In Spain, it is known as espina de Cristo (\\"thorn of Christ'\\"). Older Germanic namesMarzell (1927) include Christus-Krone (\\"Christ's crown\\"), Christus- Strauss (\\"Christ's bouquet\\"\\"Christ's flower\\" is a mistranslation of Marzell (1927)), Dorn-Krone (\\"crown of thorns\\"), Jesus-Lijden (\\"Jesus' passion\\"), Marter (\\"passion\\"\\"Martyr\\" is a mistranslation of Marzell (1927)) or Muttergottes-Stern (\\"Mother of God's star\\"Muttergottes-Schuzchen (or -Schurzchen) is a nonsensical misreading of Marzell (1927)). Outside the Roman Catholic heartland, the regularly shaped flowers have reminded people of the face of a clock. In Israel they are known as \\"clock-flower\\" (◊©◊¢◊ï◊†◊ô◊™) and in Greece as \\"clock plant\\" (œÅŒøŒªŒøŒ≥ŒπŒ¨); in Japan too, they are known as tokeis≈ç (ÊôÇË®àËçâ, \\"clock plant\\"). In Hawaiian, they are called liliko ªi; lƒ´ is a string used for tying fabric together, such as a shoelace, and liko means \\"to spring forth leaves\\".Pukui et al. (1992) In India, blue passionflowers are called Krishna kamala (‡§ï‡•É‡§∑‡•ç‡§£‡§ï‡§Æ‡§≥) in Karnataka and Maharashtra, while in Uttar Pradesh and generally north it is colloquially called \\"Panch Pandav\\" (referring to the five Pandavas in the Hindu epic, the Mahabharata). The five anthers are interpreted as the five Pandavas, the divine Krishna is at the centre, and the radial filaments are opposing hundred. The colour blue is moreover associated with Krishna as the colour of his aura. Passiflora 'Soi Fah' aka Krishnakamala in India In northern Peru and Bolivia, the banana passionfruits are known as tumbos. This is one possible source of the name of the Tumbes region of Peru. In Turkey, the shape of the flowers have reminded people of Rota Fortunae, thus it called √áarkƒ±felek. Taxonomy Passiflora is the most species rich genus of both the family Passifloraceae and the tribe Passifloreae. With over 550 species, an extensive hierarchy of infrageneric ranks is required to represent the relationships of the species. The infrageneric classification of Passiflora not only uses the widely used ranks of subgenus, section and series, but also the rank of supersection. The New World species of Passiflora were first divided among 22 subgenera by Killip (1938) in the first monograph of the genus. More recent work has reduced these to 4, which are commonly accepted today (in order from most basally to most recently branching): * Astrophea (Americas, ~60 species), trees and shrubs with simple, unlobed leaves * Passiflora (Americas, ~250 species), woody vines with large flowers and elaborate corolla * Deidamioides (Americas, 13 species), woody or herbaceous vines * Decaloba (Americas, Asia and Australasia, ~230 species), herbaceous vines with palmately veined leaves Some studies have shown that the segregate Old World genera Hollrungia and Tetrapathaea are nested within Passiflora, and form a fifth subgenus (Tetrapathaea). Other studies support the current 4 subgenus classification. Relationships below the subgenus level are not known with certainty and are an active area of research. The Old World species form two clades - supersection Disemma (part of subgenus Decaloba) and subgenus Tetrapathaea. The former is composed of 21 species divided into sections Disemma (3 Australian species), Holrungiella (1 New Guinean species) and Octandranthus (17 south and east Asian species).Shawn Elizabeth Krosnick, PhD thesis, Phylogenetic relationships and patterns of morphological evolution in the Old Word species of Passiflora (subgenus Decaloba: supersection Disemma and subgenus Tetrapathaea) The remaining (New World) species of subgenus Decaloba are divided into 7 supersections. Supersection Pterosperma includes 4 species from Central America and southern Mexico. Supersection Hahniopathanthus includes 5 species from Central America, Mexico and northernmost South America. Supersection Cicea includes 19 species, with apetalous flowers. Supersection Bryonioides includes 21 species, with a distribution centered on Mexico. Supersection Auriculata includes 8 species from South America, one of which is also found in Central America. Supersection Multiflora includes 19 species. Supersection Decaloba includes 123 species.

Common names include box or boxwood. The boxes are native to western and southern Europe, southwest, southern and eastern Asia, Africa, Madagascar, northernmost South America, Central America, Mexico and the Caribbean, with the majority of species being tropical or subtropical; only the European and some Asian species are frost-tolerant. Centres of diversity occur in Cuba (about 30 species), China (17 species) and Madagascar (9 species). They are slow-growing evergreen shrubs and small trees, growing to 2‚Äì12 m (rarely 15 m) tall. The leaves are opposite, rounded to lanceolate, and leathery; they are small in most species, typically 1.5‚Äì5 cm long and 0.3‚Äì2.5 cm broad, but up to 11 cm long and 5 cm broad in B. macrocarpa. The flowers are small and yellow-green, monoecious with both sexes present on a plant. The fruit is a small capsule 0.5‚Äì1.5 cm long (to 3 cm in B. macrocarpa), containing several small seeds. The genus splits into three genetically distinct sections, each section in a different region, with the Eurasian species in one section, the African (except northwest Africa) and Madagascan species in the second, and the American species in the third.

In Britain and mainland Europe, box is subject to damage from caterpillars of Cydalima perspectalis which can devastate a box hedge within a short time. This is a recently introduced species first noticed in Europe in 2007 and in the UK in 2008 but spreading. There were 3 UK reports of infestation in 2011, 20 in 2014 and 150 in the first half of 2015.Invasive caterpillar 'could spread in UK' = Wood carving = The white pieces are made of boxwood. The black piece is ebonized, not made of ebony. Owing to its fine grain it is a good wood for fine wood carving, although this is limited by the small sizes available. It is also resistant to splitting and chipping, and thus useful for decorative or storage boxes. Formerly, it was used for wooden combs. As a timber or wood for carving it is \\"boxwood\\" in all varieties of English. Owing to the relatively high density of the wood, boxwood is often used for chess pieces, unstained boxwood for the white pieces and stained ('ebonized') boxwood for the black pieces, in lieu of ebony. The extremely fine endgrain of box makes it suitable for woodblock printing and woodcut blocks, for which it was the usual material in Europe. In the 16th century, boxwood was used to create intricate decorative carvings, including intricate rosary prayer beads. As of 2016, the largest collection of these carvings is at the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto.\\"Inner Space: In Small Wonders, the AGO's strangest possessions take centre stage\\". Toronto Star, November 13, 2016. Page E1. Murray White. High quality wooden spoons have usually been carved from box, with beech being the usual cheaper substitute. Boxwood was once called dudgeon, and was used for the handles of dirks, and daggers, with the result that such a knife was known as a dudgeon. Although one \\"in high dudgeon\\" is indignant and enraged, and while the image of a dagger held high, ready to plunge into an enemy, has a certain appeal, lexicographers have no real evidence as to the origin of the phrase. =Musical instruments= 19th-century English flute made of boxwood (detail) Due to its high density, resistance to chipping, and relatively low cost, boxwood has been used to make parts for various stringed instruments since antiquity.See Theocritus Idyll 24.110, where Heracles is taught to play a boxwood lyre. It is mostly used to make tailpieces, chin rests and tuning pegs, but may be used for a variety of other parts as well. Other woods used for this purpose are rosewood and ebony. Boxwood was a common material for the manufacture of recorders in the eighteenth century, and a large number of mid- to high-end instruments made today are produced from one or other species of boxwood. Boxwood was once a popular wood for other woodwind instruments, and was among the traditional woods for Great Highland bagpipes before tastes turned to imported dense tropical woods such as cocuswood, ebony, and African blackwood. =Historical= General Thomas F. Meagher decorated the hats of the men of the Irish Brigade with boxwood during the American Civil War, as he could find no shamrock.

He founded the Ashami company in 1932, which eventually became the Afghan National Bank (Bank-e-Mili Afghan ). Early life and Education Zabuli was born in Ghazni province, Nawa district, Husain Khail vilage in 1896. He was then educated in Tashkent before spending some time in Berlin. Mohammed Nadir Shah's government requested that Zabuli return to Afghanistan to assist with economic affairs of state. Early attempts to establish a national bank Until 1930, both public and private trade and banking in Afghanistan occurred through financing provided by money bazaars. When trade was disrupted due to a revolt against AmƒÅnullƒÅh KhƒÅn, Zabuli suggested the establishment of a national bank. This had been previously suggested by Amanulla and had been rejected on religious grounds. However, Zabuli was given permission by Mohammed Nadir Shah to establish a joint stock company in its place. Even though the company was given a monopoly over imports of sugar, petroleum and motor vehicles as well as exports of cotton, karakul and wool it was not a successful venture. Establishment of the Afghan National Bank (Bank-e-Mili Afghan) In 1931 Abdul Majid Zabuli was able to use the investment capital he had accrued through the cotton trade with Russia to establish Afghanistan's first investment bank. While privately owned, the Bank-e-Meli Afghan was given power over currency regulation and acted as a de facto government organisation. Abdul Majid Zabuli was the major shareholder of the bank until it was nationalized in 1975 by the Afghan President Sardar Daud. Until the bank was nationalized in 1975, Zabuli directed the affairs of the Bank from his residence in Nahant, Massachusetts, U.S.A. and appointed all the executives of the bank and the bank owned enterprises. Political career Zabuli was a supporter of the Weekh Zalmian movement. It called for the youth of Afghanistan to work for the common good of their country without recourse to outside interference, the eradication of bribery and oppression, legal rights for women and the furtherance of the national economy. In 1948 Abdul Majid Zabuli visited Washington in his role as Minister of National Economy. He requested that the US provide arms and financial assistance to Afghanistan to allay concerns in Afghanistan regarding possible Soviet aggressions following the British withdrawal from India. Both these requests were denied.Ludwig W.

Juran (credited as Nathan Hertz) and starring Allison Hayes, William Hudson and Yvette Vickers. It was produced by Bernard Woolner. The screenplay was written by Mark Hanna, and the original music score was composed by Ronald Stein. The film was distributed in the United States by Allied Artists as a double feature with War of the Satellites. The Allied Artists television version runs 75 minutes instead of 66, including a long printed crawl at the beginning and end, repeated sequences, and hold-frames designed to optically lengthen the film's running time. The film's storyline concerns the plight of a wealthy heiress whose close encounter with an enormous alien in his round spacecraft causes her to grow into a giantess, complicating her marriage which is already troubled by a philandering husband.eMoviePoster.com Attack of the 50 Foot Woman is a variation on other 1950s science fiction films that featured size-changing humans: The Amazing Colossal Man (1957), its sequel War of the Colossal Beast (1958), and The Incredible Shrinking Man (1957). In this case, a woman is substituted for a man as the film's protagonist.Keep Watching The Skies! American Science Fiction Movies of the 1950s, Vol. 2, 1958-1962 (New York: McFarland & Co, 1986), 16. Plot A television announcer reports sightings of a red fireball around the world. Facetiously, he calculates its path will take it to California. Nancy Archer (Allison Hayes), a wealthy but highly troubled woman with a history of emotional instability and immoderate drinking, is driving on a road that night in an American desert. A glowing sphere settles on the deserted highway in front of her, causing her to veer off the road. When she gets out to investigate the object, a huge creature exits and reaches for her (the viewer sees only an enormous hand falling upon the screaming woman). Nancy escapes and runs back to town, but nobody believes her story due to her known drinking problem and a recent stay in a mental institution. Her philandering husband, Harry Archer (William Hudson), is more interested in his latest girlfriend, town floozy Honey Parker (Yvette Vickers). He pretends to be the good husband in the hope that Nancy will \\"snap\\" and return to the \\"booby hatch,\\" leaving him in control of her $50 million estate. Nancy bargains with Harry, asking him to search the desert with her for the \\"flying satellite,\\" agreeing to a voluntary return to the sanatorium if they find nothing. As night falls, they find the spacecraft and the alien creature emerges, revealed as an enormous male human. Harry fires his pistol at the giant, but the gunfire has no effect. Harry flees, leaving Nancy behind. She is later discovered on the roof of her pool house in a delirious state and must be sedated by her family physician, Dr. Cushing (Roy Gordon). The doctor comments on scratches he finds on Nancy's neck, and theorizes that she was exposed to radiation. Egged on by his mistress Honey, Harry plans to inject Nancy with a lethal dose of her sedative, but when he sneaks up to her room, he discovers that she has grown to giant size. In a scene paralleling Nancy's first alien encounter, only an enormous hand is seen as Harry reacts in horror. Cushing and Dr. Von Loeb, a specialist brought in by Cushing, are at a loss on how to treat their giant patient. They keep her in a morphine-induced coma and restrain her with chains while waiting for the authorities to arrive. The sheriff and Jess (Ken Terrell), Nancy's faithful butler, track enormous footprints leading away from the estate to the alien sphere. Inside the sphere, they find Nancy's diamond necklace (containing the largest diamond in the world) and other large diamonds, each in a clear orb. They speculate that the jewels are being used as a power source for the alien ship. The huge human reappears, and the sheriff and Jess flee. Meanwhile, Nancy awakens and breaks free of her restraints. She tears off her mansion's roof and, clothed in a bikini-like arrangement of bed linens, heads to town to avenge herself on her unfaithful husband. Ripping the roof off the local bar, she spots Honey and drops a ceiling beam on her rival, killing her. Harry panics, grabs Deputy Charlie's pistol, and begins shooting, but she picks up Harry and walks away. The gunshots have no apparent effect on her. The sheriff fires a shotgun at her, which causes a nearby power line transformer to blow up, killing her. The doctors find Harry lying dead in her hand.

Director Nathan Juran was unhappy with the final film and changed his on-screen credit to \\"Nathan Hertz.\\" Critical reception On review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 75% based on 12 reviews, with an average rating of 6.17/10. Remakes and sequels With its low budget of around $88,000, Attack of the 50 Foot Woman made enough money to prompt discussion of a sequel. According to executive producer and cinematographer Jacques Marquette, the sequel was to be produced at a higher budget and in color. A script was written, but the project never advanced beyond the discussion phase.Bill Warren, Keep Watching The Skies! American Science Fiction Movies of the 1950s, Vol. 2, 1958-1962 (New York: McFarland & Co, 1986), 16. In early 1979, Dimension Pictures announced that producer Steve Krantz was developing a 5-million-dollar remake with director Paul Morrissey. It never came to fruition. In the mid-1980s, filmmaker Jim Wynorski considered doing a remake with Sybil Danning in the title role.See Femme Fatales 1:2. Wynorski made it as far as shooting a photo session with Danning dressed as the 50-foot woman.One image appears as the cover of Femme Fatales 1:2 The project never materialized because Wynorski opted instead to film Not of This Earth (1988), a remake of Roger Corman's 1957 film of the same name.Femme Fatales, 1:2. The film was remade in 1993 by HBO under the same title Attack of the 50 Ft. Woman. It was directed by Christopher Guest, with a script by Thirtysomething writer Joseph Dougherty. Daryl Hannah produced the film and starred in the title role. In 1995, Fred Olen Ray produced a parody entitled Attack of the 60 Foot Centerfold, starring J.J. North and Tammy Parks. Beyond the basic premise, the plot has little in common with the original film, being concerned with the side effects of a beauty-enhancing formula on two ambitious female models. The film was farcical and made on an extremely low budget. The illusion of size difference was achieved using forced perspective, unlike the earlier films which used composite imaging. In late 2011, Roger Corman produced a 3D film titled Attack of the 50 Foot Cheerleader, released on August 25, 2012. It was written by Mike MacLean (who also wrote Sharktopus for Corman) and was directed by Kevin O'Neill. The film stars Jena Sims (a former Miss Georgia Teen USA) in the title role as Cassie Stratford and Olivia Alexander, who co-plays Sims's rival, Brittany Andrews. In popular culture * The 2019 Netflix original, Raising Dion, episode 9, features the film's movie poster in Pat's condo after it is revealed that Pat shapeshifts into a 50-foot, human thunderstorm. *The 1987 TMNT cartoon episode \\"Attack of the 50 Foot Irma\\" (1989) includes a similar plot, where April O'Neil's friend Irma is hit by a beam created by a meteorite crashing to Earth. She grows to a massive size and ends up being chased by authorities. * Various animated television series have referenced the film, usually in episodes which involve a female character becoming giant-sized.

Maduro graduated from The Lawrenceville School (where he was awarded the Lawrenceville Medal, Lawrenceville's highest award to alumni) and later Stanford University. He was President between 27 January 2002, and 27 January 2006, representing the National Party of Honduras (PNH). Ricardo Maduro is a member of the Levy-Maduro family whose roots go through Portugal, the Netherlands and the Netherlands Antilles. Life and career Maduro's first marriage to Miriam Andr√©u produced three daughters and a son, Ricardo Ernesto, who was kidnapped at age 25 on 23 April 1997. Ricardo Ernesto's body was discovered two days later. His death inspired Maduro to aspire to the presidency and gave him the popularity that allowed him to first register and then be elected as a presidential candidate, in spite of a constitutional ban on those not born in Honduras from becoming President. This constitutional ban created great controversy before the 2001 elections. Having been chosen as the PNH candidate, he was eventually allowed to stand. In his campaign he promised to tackle crime and the Mara Salvatrucha gang (maras). He immediately brought troops out onto the streets of the larger cities to accompany the local police. The PNH-held National Congress passed laws making illicit association a crime, which have seen hundreds of gang members put behind bars. In October 2002, he married the Spaniard Aguas Santas Oca√±a Navarro, whom he met when she was a member of the Spanish Embassy in Honduras. Shortly after he left office, Maduro and Oca√±a filed for divorce. She consequently moved to Nicaragua with her adoptive children to direct a non-profit organization devoted to children. Maduro remained in Tegucigalpa. Maduro's eldest son is a United States citizen and lives in the U.S. On 1 May 2005 the plane Maduro was traveling in crashed into the Caribbean Sea off the shore of Tela. Maduro, his daughter Lorena, and the pilot were reportedly not seriously injured and were rescued by local residents. Maduro was taken to a hospital in Comayagua to recover. On 27 November 2005 Maduro presided over a new set of presidential and general elections. His party lost the presidency to the Liberal Party of Honduras (PLH) and its candidate Manuel Zelaya. Zelaya succeeded Maduro on 27 January 2006. Maduro currently serves as President of Inversiones la Paz in Tegucigalpa, and is active in the education organization he created in honor of his son, the Fundacion para la Educacion Ricardo Ernesto Maduro Andreu.

Burdell is a fictitious student officially enrolled at Georgia Tech in 1927 as a practical joke. Since then, he has supposedly received all undergraduate degrees offered by Georgia Tech, served in the military, gotten married, and served on Mad magazine's Board of Directors, among other accomplishments. Burdell at one point led the online poll for Times 2001 Person of the Year award. He has evolved into an important and notorious campus tradition; all Georgia Tech students learn about him at orientation. History =Origins= George P. Burdell was created by William Edgar \\"Ed\\" Smith (BS in Ceramic Engineering) in 1927. Smith conceived the idea for Burdell when he mistakenly received two Georgia Tech enrollment forms. In a 1977 Atlanta newspaper interview, Smith said that he originally intended to enroll his Academy of Richmond County principal, George P. Butler, but instead changed the last name to Burdell, the maiden name of his best friend's mother. After enrolling him, Smith signed Burdell up for all the same classes he had. With the help of friends, Smith would do all schoolwork twice, changing it slightly to avoid professors catching his sham. When he had a test, he would take it twice and then turn it in under both names. By 1930, the school had awarded Burdell a bachelor's degree, and a few years later awarded the fictitious student a master's degree. The college listed him as an official alumnus, even though his name has remained on the active student rolls. In 1930, the ANAK Society, Georgia Tech's oldest secret society, offered Burdell membership. An early prank using Burdell's name came after someone was snubbed by a fraternity he had intended to join. \\"That irritated [him]. He ordered a truckload of furniture to be delivered C.O.D. to that fraternity. Of course, the order was made by George P. Burdell.\\" =World War II= During World War II, service members continued the hoax, with Burdell's name appearing on various fronts. For example, he was listed on the flight crew of a B-17 bomber, flying twelve missions over Europe with the 8th Air Force in England, until a Georgia Tech graduate became the new operations officer, recognized the name on the flight log, and ended the charade. =Postwar= In 1958, members of the senior class of Agnes Scott College announced the wedding engagement of Burdell and fictional Agnes Scott student Ramona Cartwright in the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. The 50th wedding anniversary, of \\"Mr. and Mrs. George P. Burdell from Atlanta\\" was acknowledged on the September 23, 2006 broadcast of A Prairie Home Companion. A recording can be found at a time of 1:13:55. To this day, George P. Burdell is listed as a letterman in the official media guides of two Tech sports: from 1928 to 1930 in football and 1956 to 1958 in basketball. In 1969, Georgia Tech computerized its class registration, believing it had successfully found a way to keep students from registering Burdell for class that semester. As it turned out, hackers registered him for every class at the school that quarter, over 3,000 credit hours. He was subsequently re-enrolled several times, including in 1975 and 1980. George P. Burdell is listed as Georgia Tech Swimming & Diving's team captain of 1988 on their record board, even though there was no team that year after the demolition of the Heisman Gym. The publishers of Mad magazine listed Burdell as a member of its board of directors from 1969 until 1981. In 1991 a check from Kraft Foods bore the signature \\"George P. Burdell\\". When Time magazine was attempting to select their Person of the Year for 2001, George Burdell was the leading candidate (holding at least 57 percent of the votes) until the magazine removed him from the running. Credit cards have been issued in his name. WREK, the Georgia Tech student radio station, lists him as a staff member, and he is credited for playing baritone on the 1995 album Jesus Christ Superstar: A Resurrection, which was made in Atlanta by musicians from the local alternative rock scene.Jesus Christ Superstar: A Resurrection, bn.com. Retrieved 5-30-2012 In 2000, Burdell was named an alternate delegate to the Democratic National Convention from Georgia. Burdell was credited as a member of the choir of the 2006 album There is a Place. George's fictitious son, George P. Burdell Junior, has been a proctor for several classes at Georgia Tech. =Criminal Record= On November 27, 2014, George P. Burdell allegedly hacked into the University of Georgia's online master calendar to post a new event titled \\"Get Ass Kicked by GT\\" during the time of the annual Georgia Tech football game . This prank was meant to celebrate the 100-year old tradition of Clean, Old- Fashioned Hate. While the author of the new calendar event was marked as George P. Burdell, undergraduate Computer Engineering student, Ryan Pickren, was ultimately arrested and indicted for the crime . =Space Exploration= On June 25, 2019, George P. Burdell's name flew engraved on the Prox-1 satellite mission designed and built by the Guggenheim School of Aerospace Engineering at Georgia Tech. His name is listed along with all the other students who worked on the mission. The satellite was part of the Space Test Program 2 (STP-2) launch on a SpaceX Falcon Heavy Rocket. Legacy Burdell is a campus icon at Georgia Tech, and incoming freshmen are introduced to him as one of the greatest alumni to graduate from the school. George P. Burdell is often paged over the public address system during football games and also at airports, bars, and hotels. Georgia Tech students or alumni often use his name as an alias when they do not want to disclose their real name. There is a store in Georgia Tech's student center named \\"Burdell's\\". During a speech made by US President Barack Obama held at Georgia Tech in the McCamish Pavilion on March 10, 2015, the president jokingly indicated that he was supposed to be introduced by George P. Burdell, but no one could find George.

It was carved out of the original larger Mysore District in the year 1998. Chamarajanagar town is the headquarters of this district. It is the third least populous district in Karnataka (out of 30), after Kodagu and Bangalore Rural. History Chamarajanagara was earlier known as Sri Arikottara. Chamaraja Wodeyar, the Wodeyar king of Mysuru was born here and hence this place was renamed after him. The Vijaya Parsvanath Basadi, a holy Jain shrine was constructed by Punisadandanayaka, the commander of the Hoysala king Gangaraja in the year 1117 AD. Geography Being the southern most district of Karnataka, Chamarajanagar district borders the state of Tamil Nadu and Kerala. Specifically, it borders Mysore district of Karnataka to the west and north, Mandya and Ramanagara districts of Karnataka to the north-east, Dharmapuri and Krishnagiri districts of Tamil Nadu to the east, Salem and Erode districts of Tamil Nadu to the south-east, Nilgiris district of Tamil Nadu to the south, and to the extreme south-west, there is a very small border with Wayanad district of Kerala. Most of the district lies in the leeward region of the Nilgiris and consists of mainly semi-arid rain- dependent flatlands along with forested hills. Roads National Highway 948 ( previously NH 209), which starts from Bengaluru in Karnataka state and ends at Coimbatore in Tamil Nadu, passes through the following places namely Kanakapura, Sathanur, Halagur, Malavalli, Shivanasamudra, Kollegala, Chamarajanagara ,Attagulipura, Punajanur and enters tamilnadu.It further goes to Hasanur, Dhimbam ghat,Thalamalai, Bannari,Satyamangalam, Pullampatti, Annur ends at Coimbatore. Few KSRTC buses run on NH 948. There are many roads from Chamarajanagara district to neighbouring taminadu state. One road connects Kollegala to Hasanur via Dhondenling and Germalam. There is a buddhist monastery at Dhondeling. Another road connects Kollegala to Anthiyur via Hanur, Ramapura, Burgur and Moongilpalya. The road from Kollegala to Mettur goes through Hanur Kowdalli( Cowdalli), Male Mahadeshwara Betta( MM Hills), Palar, Govindapadi, Kaveripuram and Kolathur. The above mentioned three roads pass through forest teaming with wild animals like Elephant, Indian Bison, Leopard and Tiger, These Roads are isolated and narrow at many stretches without any human habitation and cellular phone signals. National Highway 181 connects Gundlupete town of Chamarajanagara district with Ooty via Bandipura and Gudalur. National Highway 766 connects Gundlupete with Kalpetta via Mulehole and Sulthan bathery. The national highways 181 and 766 are closed for private vehicles at night in stretch between Gundlupete and neighbouring states.. Only state government buses are allowed at night in these section of highway. Demographics According to the 2011 census Chamarajanagar district has a population of 1,020,791, roughly equal to the nation of Cyprus or the US state of Montana. This gives it a ranking of 441st in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001-2011 was 5.75%. Chamarajanagar has a sex ratio of 989 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 61.43%. According to the 2011 census, 86.11% of the population speaks Kannada, 4.58% Tamil, 4.42% Urdu and 3.29% Telugu as their first language. The district has a high percentage of Scheduled Castes, with a population of 259,000, making up a quarter of the district's population. Having a large percentage of forest cover the district also has a high population of forest-dwelling tribals, like the Soligas, Yeravas, Jenu Kurubas and Betta Kurubas. These tribals have their own languages and their total population is around 120,000, and make up 12% of the district population. Other communities include Lingayats, Muslims and Vokkaligas. Crime Since much of the southern area of the district is dense forest, it provided good refuge to the notorious bandit Veerappan, responsible for the death of over a hundred policemen in both states of Karnatak and tamilnad. He was shot dead in an encounter with the specially formed Special Task Force (STF) on 18 October 2004, in Dharmapuri district, Tamil Nadu. He had been on the run for over two decades. The presence of illegal quarrying for black stone imposes a great threat to the forests in the region.

It is the only member of the genus Potos and is also known as the \\"honey bear\\" (a name that it shares with the unrelated sun bear). Kinkajous are arboreal, a lifestyle they evolved independently; they are not closely related to any other tree-dwelling mammal group (primates, some mustelids, etc.). Native to Central America and South America, this mostly frugivorous mammal is not an endangered species, though it is seldom seen by people because of its strict nocturnal habits. However, they are hunted for the pet trade, for their fur (to make wallets and horse saddles) and for their meat. The species has been included in Appendix III of CITES by Honduras, which means that exports from Honduras require an export permit and exports from other countries require a certificate of origin or re-export. They may live up to 40 years in captivity. Etymology The common name \\"kinkajou\\" derives from , based on the Algonquian name for the wolverine. It is similar to the Ojibwe word kwi¬∑nkwa îa¬∑ke. Other names in English include honey bear, night ape and night walker. Throughout the range several regional names are used; for instance, the Dutch names nachtaap, rolbeer and rolstaartbeer are used in Suriname. Many names come from Portuguese, Spanish and local dialects, such as cuchicuchi, huasa, jupar√°, leoncillo, marta, perro de monte and yapara. Taxonomy A. M. Husson, of the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie (Leiden), discussed the rather complicated nomenclature of the kinkajou in The Mammals of Suriname (1978). In his 1774 work Die Saugthiere in Abbildungen nach der Natur, Schreber listed three items under the name \\"Lemur flavus Penn.\\": on page 145 is a short translation of Pennant's description of the yellow maucauco (later identified to be Lemur mongoz, presently known as the mongoose lemur) from his 1771 work A Synopsis of Quadrupeds (page 138, second figure on plate 16); on plate 42 is a depiction of the yellow maucauco by Schreber; the last item is a reference to A Synopsis of Quadrupeds itself. Husson noted that the last item is actually Pennant's description of an animal that is clearly a kinkajou. Husson therefore concluded that Lemur flavus is actually a \\"composite species\\" based on Schreber's specimen of the mongoose lemur and Pennant's specimen of the kinkajou, and identified the latter as the lectotype for the species. The type locality reported by Schreber for L. flavus (\\"the mountains in Jamaica\\") was clearly based on Pennant's description of the kinkajou, who claimed, however, that his specimen was \\"shown about three years ago in London: its keeper said it came from the mountains of Jamaica\\". This error was pointed out by Thomas in 1902, who corrected the type locality to Suriname. He used the name Potos flavus for the kinkajou. The genus Potos was erected by Saint-Hilaire and Cuvier in 1795, with the type species Viverra caudivolvula described by Schreber in 1778 (later identified as a synonym of Potos flavus). In 1977 the family Cercoleptidae was proposed with the kinkajou as the sole member, but this classification was later dismissed. = Subspecies = Eight subspecies have been proposed (type localities are listed alongside): *P. f. chapadensis : Chapadas of Mato Grosso (Brazil). *P. f. chiriquensis : Boquer√≥n, Chiriqu√≠ Province (Panama). *P. f. flavus : Suriname. Synonyms include Cercoleptes brachyotos, C. brachyotus, Mustela potto and Viverra caudivolvula. *P. f. megalotus : Santa Marta (Colombia). *P. f. meridensis : M√©rida (Venezuela). *P. f. modestus : Montes Balzar, Guayas Province (Ecuador). *P. f. nocturnus : S√£o Miguel dos Campos, Alagoas (Brazil). *P. f. prehensilis : Veracruz (Mexico). A 2016 phylogenetic study based on mitochondrial gene cytochrome b analyzed kinkajou specimens from a variety of locations throughout most of the range. The results showed 27 haplotypes split into five clades corresponding to geographical divisions: Costa Rica (clade 1); northern Brazil and the Guianas (clade 2); northern Peru (clade 3); Ecuador and Panama (clade 4); interfluves between the Branco River and Rio Negro in the Brazilian Amazon, low-lying Amazonian areas (in Bolivia, western Brazil and Peru), and eastern Atlantic Forest (clade 5). Given the diverse clades, the researchers suggested that some of the subspecies might be independent species.  Evolution  A 2007 phylogenetic study showed that kinkajous form a basal lineage sister to the rest of Procyonidae. They diverged 21.6‚Äì24 mya. Two clades, one leading to Bassaricyon (olingos and the olinguito) plus Nasua (coatis), and one leading to Bassariscus (the ring- tailed coati and the cacomistle) plus Procyon (racoons), appeared subsequently and radiated during the Miocene (). Kinkajous are thought to have evolved in Central America and invaded South America as part of the Great American Interchange that followed the formation of the Isthmus of Panama. The phylogenetic relationships obtained in the 2007 study are given below; these were supported by similar studies in the following years.  Physical characteristics  Kinkajou using its prehensile tail In a rehabilitation center, Panama The kinkajou has a round head, large eyes, a short pointed snout, short limbs and a long prehensile tail. The total head-and-body length (including the tail) is between , and the tail measures . The weight ranges from . Females are generally smaller than males. The short, rounded ears measure . The eyes reflect green or bright yellow against light. The long, narrow tongue is highly extrudable. The snout is dark brown to black. The claws are sharp and short. The coat color varies throughout the range and at different times of the year. Several shades such as tawny olive, wood brown and yellowish tawny have been reported for the upper part of the coat and the upper side of the tail, while the underparts and the lower side of the tail have been observed to be buff, tawny or brownish yellow. Some individuals have a black stripe running along the midline of the back. The color seems to become lighter from the south to the north, though no seasonal trends have been observed. The fur is short, woolly and dense. Hairs are of two types: light yellowish and darker with brown tips. The darker hairs reflect light poorly relative to the lighter ones, often creating an illusion of spots and dark lines on the coat. The tail is covered with thick fur up to the end. The kinkajou is distinguished from other procyonids by its small, rounded ears, extensible tongue and prehensile tail. Olingos are similar enough in appearance that many native cultures do not distinguish the two. Compared to olingos, kinkajous are larger, have foreshortened muzzles, and lack anal scent glands (in addition to the previously described differences). The binturong, a southeast Asian viverrid, has similar limb proportions and is the only other carnivoran with a prehensile tail. The kinkajou resembles neotropical monkeys in having a prehensile tail and big forward-facing eyes, but has a different dentition and heavy fur on the soles of the feet.  Range and habitat  Kinkajous range from east and south of the Sierra Madres in Mexico, throughout Central America to Bolivia east of the Andes and the Atlantic Forest of southeastern Brazil. Their altitudinal range is from sea level to 2500 m. They are found in closed-canopy tropical forests, including lowland rainforest, montane forest, dry forest, gallery forest and secondary forest. Deforestation is thus a potential threat to the species.  Diet  Kinkajou skull Although the kinkajou is classified in the order Carnivora and has sharp teeth, its omnivorous diet consists mainly of fruit, particularly figs. Studies have shown that 90% of their diet consists of (primarily ripe) fruit. To eat softer fruits they hold it with their forepaws, then scoop out the succulent pulp with their tongue. They may play an important role in seed dispersal. Leaves, flowers, and various herbs make up much of the other 10% of their diet. They sometimes eat insects, particularly ants. It has been suggested, without direct evidence, that they may occasionally eat bird eggs and small vertebrates. Their frugivorous habits are actually convergent with those of (diurnal) spider monkeys. The kinkajou's slender five-inch extrudable tongue helps the animal to obtain fruit and to lick nectar from flowers, so that it sometimes acts as a pollinator. (Nectar is also sometimes obtained by eating entire flowers.) Although captive specimens will avidly eat honey (hence the name \\"honey bear\\"), honey has not yet been observed in the diet of wild kinkajous.  Behavior  Skeleton at Museum of Osteology University Museum, Harvard Kinkajous spend most of their life in trees, to which they are particularly well adapted. Like raccoons, kinkajous' remarkable manipulatory abilities rival those of primates. The kinkajou has a short-haired, fully prehensile tail (like some New World monkeys), which it uses as a \\"fifth hand\\" in climbing. It does not use its tail for grasping food. It can rotate its ankles and feet 180¬∞, making it easy for the animal to run backward over tree limbs and climb down trees headfirst. Scent glands near the mouth, on the throat, and on the belly allow kinkajous to mark their territory and their travel routes. Kinkajous sleep in family units and groom one another. While they are usually solitary when foraging, they occasionally forage in small groups, and sometimes associate with olingos (which are also nocturnal arboreal frugivores). The larger kinkajous are dominant and will drive olingos away when food is scarce. Kinkajous have a much more extensive range than olingos and tend to be more common. However, olingos may have greater agility, perhaps facilitating their sympatry with kinkajous. As a nocturnal animal, the kinkajou's peak activity is usually between about 7:00 PM and midnight, and again an hour before dawn. During daylight hours, kinkajous sleep in tree hollows or in shaded tangles of leaves, avoiding direct sunlight. Kinkajous breed throughout the year, giving birth to one or occasionally two small babies after a gestation period of 112 to 118 days.  As pets  Kinkajou yawns in a Costa Rican animal shelter Kinkajous are sometimes kept as exotic pets. They are playful, generally quiet, docile, and have little odor. However, they can occasionally be aggressive. Kinkajous dislike sudden movements, noise, and being awake during the day. An agitated kinkajou may emit a scream and attack, usually clawing its victim and sometimes biting deeply. In 2011, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that pet kinkajous in the United States can be carriers (fecal‚Äìoral route) of the raccoon roundworm Baylisascaris procyonis, which is capable of causing severe morbidity and even death in humans, if the brain is infected. In El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras pet kinkajous are commonly called micole√≥n, meaning \\"lion monkey\\". In Peru pet kinkajous are frequently referred to as \\"lir√≥n\\", often described as a \\"bear-monkey\\". These names reflect its monkey-like body and obviously carnivoran head. They live an average of about 23 years in captivity, with a maximum recorded life span of 41 years.

He often wrote on spiritual themes. Education Ehrmann was of German descent; both his parents emigrated from Bavaria in the 1840s. Young Ehrmann was educated at the Terre Haute Fourth District School and the German Methodist Church. He received a degree in English from DePauw University in Greencastle, Indiana, which he attended from 1890 to 1894. While there, he was a member of Delta Tau Delta's Beta Beta chapter and was editor of the school newspaper, Depauw Weekly. Ehrmann then studied philosophy and law at Harvard University, where he was editor of Delta Tau Delta's national magazine The Rainbow, circa 1896. Professional life Ehrmann returned to his hometown of Terre Haute, Indiana, in 1898 to practice law. He was a deputy state's attorney in Vigo County, Indiana, for two years. Subsequently, he worked in his family's meatpacking business and in the overalls manufacturing industry (Ehrmann Manufacturing Co.) At age 40, Ehrmann left the business to write. At age 55, he wrote Desiderata, which achieved fame only after his death. Reproduced by Volkert Braren Legacy Ehrmann was awarded Doctor of Letters honorary degree from DePauw University in about 1937. He was also elected to the Delta Tau Delta Distinguished Service Chapter, the fraternity's highest alumni award. Ehrmann died in 1945 and is buried in Highland Lawn Cemetery in Terre Haute, Indiana. In 2010 the city honored Ehrmann with a life-size bronze statue by sculptor Bill Wolfe. He is depicted sitting on a downtown bench, pen in hand, with a notebook in his lap. \\"Desiderata\\" is engraved on a plaque next to the statue and lines from the poem are embedded in the walkway. The sculpture is in the collection of Art Spaces, Inc. ‚Äì Wabash Valley Outdoor Sculpture Collection. Art Spaces also holds an annual Max Ehrmann Poetry Competition.

Early life and education  Kimball was born and raised in Westchester County, New York, the son of Mary Alice White and Edward Norris Kimball. The family had a cabin in southwestern Vermont. He graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy and then Columbia University (1973) with a degree in Primitive Art.  Career  = Early career = After graduating from Columbia, he went to work with his stepbrother in a publishing company. Soon after, he worked for The Center for Direct Marketing in Westport, Connecticut and also started taking cooking courses. After securing $100,000 in angel investments from friends and family, he started Cook‚Äôs Magazine from a tiny office in Weston, Connecticut in 1980 when he was 29 years old. He sold the magazine to the Bonnier Group in 1989 and moved on to other publishing ventures. =America's Test Kitchen= Kimball was a co-founder and has been editor and publisher of America's Test Kitchen, which produces television and radio shows, and publishes magazines, including Cook's Illustrated, which Kimball launched in 1993. It also publishes Cook's Country magazine, which was launched in 2004,. The company's revenue comes from its readers, rather than advertisers, which differentiates them from the competitors. Its cookbook publisher division is Two Pigs Farm. Boston Common Press, a private partnership between Kimball, Eliot Wadsworth II, and George P. Denny III, owned Kimball's publishing activities. Kimball also hosted the syndicated Public Television cooking shows America's Test Kitchen and Cook's Country from America's Test Kitchen. On November 16, 2015, a news release from Boston Common Press, parent company of Cooks Country/Cooks Illustrated/America's Test Kitchen, announced the departure of Christopher Kimball. The 2016 TV programs had already been filmed and Kimball appeared as host, but his direct participation in the company ended immediately. He remained a minority stockholder until 2019 when he sold his shares back to the company as part of a lawsuit settlement. =Christopher Kimball's Milk Street= In 2016, he created Christopher Kimball's Milk Street, located on Milk Street in Boston, Massachusetts.Healy, Beth; Nanos, Janelle, \\"Chris Kimball to launch Milk Street Kitchen cooking venture\\", The Boston Globe, May 31, 2016 On October 31, 2016, Boston Common Press (the parent company of America's Test Kitchen and Cook's Illustrated) filed a lawsuit against Kimball in Suffolk Superior Court, claiming that Kimball \\"literally and conceptually ripped off\\" his former employer. In the lawsuit, Boston Common Press claims Kimball built his new venture while still on their payroll, using company resources in the form of recipes and databases to help shape Milk Street Kitchen into a direct competitor. The lawsuit was settled in August 2019. He was further sued by his ex-wife Adrienne, alleging his departure from Cook's Illustrated devalued the company and affected his payments to her. = Other = He is the author of The Cook's Bible, The Yellow Farmhouse Cookbook, Dear Charlie, The Dessert Bible and Fannie's Last Supper, and is a columnist for the New York Daily News and the Boston-based Tab Communications. Other television appearances include This Old House and the morning shows Weekend Today and The Early Show. He is a regular contributor on National Public Radio. On January 8, 2011, Kimball began hosting WGBH-FM's America's Test Kitchen Radio distributed by PRX.  Personal life  He has been married three times. He had a son and three daughters with his second wife, Adrienne. They divorced in December 2012. On June 30, 2013, Kimball married Melissa Lee Baldino, executive producer of the America's Test Kitchen television show.Laskey, Margaux, \\"Melissa Baldino, Christopher Kimball: All the Ingredients Were There\\", The New York Times, June 30, 2013 She is now co- founder of Christopher Kimball's Milk Street.

Anthropologist Ralph Solecki led a crew from Columbia University to explore the site. With the accompaniment of Kurdish workers, the group excavated the Shanidar Cave and found the remains of eight adult and two infant Neanderthals, dating from around 65,000‚Äì35,000 years ago . These individuals were uncovered amongst a Mousterian layer accompanied by various stone tools and animal remains. The cave also contains two later proto-Neolithic cemeteries, one of which dates back about 10,600 years and contains 35 individuals. The best known of the Neanderthals at the site are Shanidar 1, who survived several injuries during his life, possibly due to care from others in his group, and Shanidar 4, the famed 'flower burial'.‚ÄúShanidar Cave.‚Äù Shanidar Cave  Unbelievable Kurdistan - Official Tourism Site of Kurdistan, http://bot.gov.krd/erbil-province- mirgasor/history-and-heritage/shanidar-cave Until this discovery, Cro-Magnons, the earliest known H. sapiens in Europe, were the only individuals known for purposeful, ritualistic burials. The site is located within the Zagros Mountains.  Neanderthal remains  The ten Neanderthals at the site were found within a Mousterian layer which also contained hundreds of stone tools including points, side-scrapers, and flakes and bones from animals including wild goats and spur-thighed tortoises. The first nine (Shanidar 1‚Äì9) were unearthed between 1957 and 1961 by Ralph Solecki and a team from Columbia University. The skeleton of Shanidar 3 is held at the Smithsonian Institution. The others (Shanidar 1, 2, and 4‚Äì8) were kept in Iraq and may have been lost during the 2003 invasion, although casts remain at the Smithsonian. In 2006, while sorting a collection of faunal bones from the site at the Smithsonian, Melinda Zeder discovered leg and foot bones from a tenth Neanderthal, now known as Shanidar 10. = Shanidar 1 = Shanidar I's skull and skeleton, c. 60,000 to 45,000 BCE. Iraq Museum Reconstruction of the head of a Homo neanderthalensis (type of the humans found in Shanidar 1)Shanidar 1 was an elderly Neanderthal male known as ‚ÄòNandy‚Äô to his excavators. He was aged between 30 and 45 years, remarkably old for a Neanderthal. Shanidar 1 had a cranial capacity of 1,600 cm3, was around the height of 5 feet 7 inches, and displayed severe signs of deformity.Lewis, R. Barry., et al. Understanding Humans: Introduction to Physical Anthropology and Archaeology. Wadsworth, 2013. He was one of four reasonably complete skeletons from the cave which displayed trauma-related abnormalities, which in his case would have been debilitating to the point of making day-to-day life painful. During the course of the individual‚Äôs life, he had suffered a violent blow to the left side of his face, creating a crushing fracture to his left orbit which would have left him partially or totally blind in one eye. Research by J√°n Lietava shows that the individual exhibits ‚Äúatypically worn teeth‚Äù. Severe changes to the individuals incisors and a flattened capitulum show additional evidence towards Shanidar 1 suffering from a degenerative disease. Additionally, analysis shows that Shanidar 1 likely suffered from profound hearing loss, as his left ear canal was partially blocked and his right ear canal was completely blocked by exostoses. He also suffered from a withered right arm which had been fractured in several places. A fracture of the individual‚Äôs C5 vertebrae is thought to have caused damage to his muscle function (specifically the deltoids and biceps) of the right arm. Shanidar 1 healed, but this caused the loss of his lower arm and hand. This is thought to be either congenital, a result of childhood disease and trauma, or due to an amputation later in his life. The sharp point caused by a distal fracture of the individual's right humerus points towards this theory of amputation. If the arm was amputated, this demonstrates one of the earliest signs of surgery on a living individual. The arm had healed, but the injury may have caused some paralysis down his right side, leading to deformities in his lower legs and feet. Studies show that this individual had suffered from two broken legs. This would have resulted in him walking with a pronounced, painful limp. These findings in Shanidar 1‚Äôs skeleton propose that he was unlikely to be able to provide for himself in a Neandertal society. More recent analysis of Shanidar 1 by Washington University Professor Erik Trinkaus and Dr. S√©bastien Villotte of the French National Centre for Scientific Research confirm that bony growths in his ear canals would have resulted in extensive hearing loss. These bony growths support a diagnosis of diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH), also known as Forestier's disease. This diagnosis would make Shanidar 1 the oldest hominin specimen clearly presenting this systemic condition.The researchers found these bone growths in multiple places all over the partial skeleton. As a result of the healing of his injuries, Shanidar 1 lived a substantial amount of time before his death. If the Neandertals did perform surgery on Shanidar 1, this proves that their methods were successful in sustaining life. Considering that all the injuries were healed during this time period may lead to the reasoning that this individual was kept alive for a reason. According to paleoanthropologist Erik Trinkaus, Shanidar must have been aided by others in order to survive his injuries. Due to all of the injuries and side effects of trauma, it was very unlikely that this individual could provide for his family or contribute to society in a meaningful way. With that being said, this individual may have been kept alive due to a high status within society or a repository of cultural knowledge. This evidence has led to speculation that the Neandertals had some sort of altruistic characteristics with the possibility of the presence of ethos within the Neandertal community. The discovery of stone tools found in proximity to these individuals allows us to deduce that the Neandertals exhibited enough intelligence to make everyday life easier for themselves. Maybe this knowledge surpasses basic comprehension to include characteristics such as humility and compassion which have the most known presence in Homo sapiens. These individuals may have had the capacity to show empathy to others and come to the understanding that life has meaning - causing them to want to help Shanidar 1. = Shanidar 2 = Skeletal remains of Shanidar II, c. 60,000 to 45,000 BCE. Iraq Museum Shanidar 2 was a Neanderthal male around the age of 30 who suffered from slight arthritis, found lying on his right side. It is estimated that Shanidar 2 was 5 feet 2 inches in stature which places him just below the average height of a male Neanderthal. He was killed by rocks falling from the cave‚Äôs ceiling, which crushed his skull and bones significantly. The skull had been compressed by about 5-6 cm. Much of his bones were missing when discovered, and the left tibia had teeth marks. Scavengers likely disposed of parts of his remains. There is evidence that Shanidar 2 was given a ritual send-off: a small pile of stones with some worked stone points (made out of chert) were found on top of his grave. Also, there had been a large fire by the burial site.T. D. Stewart, The Skull of Shanidar II, Sumer, vol. 17, pp. 97-106, 1961 Shanidar 2 had a \\"higher cranial vault\\", and other skull proportions that did not quite match up to the average Neanderthal skull. This may prove that the Neanderthals of Shanidar had more of a \\"morphology of anatomically modern humans\\" than other Neanderthals, or that the group was very diverse. This points to similarities between the two species, Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, but it doesn‚Äôt show any inherit \\"relationships within that species\\". = Shanidar 3 = Inside the Shanidar Cave Shanidar 3 was a 40- to 50-year-old male, found in the same grave as Shanidar 1 and 2. A wound to the left 9th rib suggests that the individual died of complications from a stab wound by a sharp implement. Bone growth around the wound indicates that Shanidar 3 lived for at least several weeks after the injury with the object still embedded. The angle of the wound rules out self-infliction, but is consistent with an accidental or purposeful stabbing by another individual. Recent research has suggested that the injury may have been caused by a long range projectile. This would be the earliest example of inter-personal or inter-specific violence in the human fossil record and the only such example amongst Neanderthals. The presence of early-modern humans, possibly armed with projectile weapons, in western Asia around the same time also raises the possibility of inter-species conflict. Shanidar 3 also suffered from a degenerative joint disorder in his foot resulting from a fracture or sprain, which would have resulted in painful, limited movement. The skeleton is on display at the Hall of Human Origins at the National Museum of Natural History in Washington, D.C. = Shanidar 4, the \\"flower burial\\" = Shanidar Neanderthal skull, dated to 80,000-60,000 BP The skeleton of Shanidar 4, an adult male aged 30‚Äì45 years, was discovered by Solecki in 1960,Ralph S. Solecki, Shanidar IV, a Neanderthal Flower Burial in Northern Iraq, Science, vol. 190, iss. 4217, pp. 880-881, 1975 positioned on his left side in a partial fetal position. For many years, Shanidar 4 was thought to provide strong evidence for a Neanderthal burial ritual. Routine soil samples from around the body, gathered for pollen analysis in an attempt to reconstruct the palaeoclimate and vegetational history of the site, were analysed eight years after its discovery. In two of the soil samples in particular, whole clumps of pollen were discovered by Arlette Leroi-Gourhan in addition to the usual pollen found throughout the site, suggesting that entire flowering plants (or at least heads of plants) had been part of the grave deposit.Arlette Leroi- Gourhan, Shanidar et ses fleurs, Pal√©orient, vol. 24, pp. 79-88, 1998 Furthermore, a study of the particular flower types suggested that the flowers may have been chosen for their specific medicinal properties. Yarrow, cornflower, bachelor's button, St Barnaby's thistle, ragwort, grape hyacinth, horsetail and hollyhock were represented in the pollen samples, all of which have been traditionally used, as diuretics, stimulants, and astringents and anti-inflammatories. This led to the idea that the man could possibly have had shamanic powers, perhaps acting as medicine man to the Shanidar Neandertals.T. D. Stewart, Shanidar Skeletons IV and VI, Sumer, vol. 19, pp. 8-26, 1963 However, recent work has suggested that the pollen was perhaps introduced to the burial by animal action, as several burrows of a gerbil-like rodent known as the Persian jird were found nearby. The jird is known to store large numbers of seeds and flowers at certain points in their burrows and this argument was used in conjunction with the lack of ritual treatment of the rest of the skeletons in the cave to suggest that the Shanidar 4 burial had natural, not cultural, origins.D.J. Sommer, The Shanidar IV 'Flower Burial': a Re-evaluation of Neanderthal Burial Ritual, Cambridge Archaeological Journal, vol. 9(1), pp. 127-129, 1999 Paul B. Pettitt has stated that the \\"deliberate placement of flowers has now been convincingly eliminated\\", noting that \\"A recent examination of the microfauna from the strata into which the grave was cut suggests that the pollen was deposited by the burrowing rodent Meriones persicus, which is common in the Shanidar microfauna and whose burrowing activity can be observed today\\". Despite his conclusions that flowers were unlikely to have been deliberately placed, Petitt nevertheless concludes that the Shanidar burials, because they happened over so many years, represent a deliberate mortuary practice by Neanderthals.The Neanderthal Dead, exploring mortuary variability in Middle Paleolithic Eurasia.

The village was defended by the Arab Liberation Army's Second Yarmuk Battalion. Safsaf was the first village to fall in Operation Hiram, the aim of which, according to the IDF, was to \\"destroy the enemy in the central Galilee 'pocket,' to take control of the whole of the Galilee and to establish a defense line on the country's northern border.\\"Morris 2008, p. 341. The village was attacked by two platoons of armored cars and a tank company from the 7th Brigade, and a fierce battle lasted from the evening until seven o'clock the next morning.Khalidi, p. 491. Evidence of a massacre in which 52‚Äì64 villagers were killed by the IDF comes from several contemporaneous Israeli government sources and Arab oral history. The evidence suggests that 52 men had their hands tied, were shot and killed, and were buried in a pit. Several women reported allegations of rape by the IDF, including a 14-year- old, and they were possibly killed. At least two internal inquiries were initiated during 1948‚Äì49 by the IDF, but their reports remain classified. Massacre allegations =Israeli accounts= A key source are the diaries of Yosef Nachmani, a senior officer in the Haganah, who was also director of the Jewish National Fund in Eastern Galilee from 1935 until 1965. He visited Safsaf or the area around it on 6 November, accompanied by the Israeli Minority Affairs minister Bechor-Shalom Sheetrit. The men were briefed by Immanuel Friedman, a representative of the Minority Affairs ministry, who talked about \\"the cruel acts of our soldiers.\\" The Nachmani diary was released by the Israeli government in the early 1980s. It had been published before, but with the passages about the massacre omitted.Morris 1995, p. 53. On 6 November 1948, Nachmani wrote: \\"In Safsaf, after ... the inhabitants had raised a white flag, the [soldiers] collected and separated the men and women, tied the hands of fifty-sixty fellahin [peasants] and shot and killed them and buried them in a pit. Also, they raped several women...\\" After listing alleged atrocities in other villages‚ÄîEilaboun, Farradiyya, and Saliha‚ÄîNachmani writes: \\"Where did they come by such a measure of cruelty, like Nazis? ... Is there no more humane way of expelling the inhabitants than by such methods?\\"see Zertal, 2005, p. 171; Morris, 2004, p. 500; Morris 1995, p. 55. Moshe Erem reported on the massacre to a meeting of the Mapam Political Committee but his words were removed from the minutes. According to notes of the meeting taken by Aharon Cohen, Erem spoke of: \\"Safsaf 52 men tied together with a rope. Pushed down a well and shot. 10 killed. Women pleaded for mercy. 3 cases of rape ... A girl of 14 raped. Another four killed.\\"Morris, 2004, p. 500. =Arab accounts= The Israeli accounts in broad detail are supported by Arab witnesses who told their stories to historians. According to Nafez Nazzal, who interviewed survivors in Ain al-Hilweh camp in 1973, witnesses spoke of four rapes and the murder of about 70 men. Villagers said that when the attack began on the village, the militiamen were braced to defend it but were surprised by a three-pronged assault. One militiaman said later: \\"We did not expect them to fight on three fronts. When none of the Arab armies joined the fighting, we retreated, together with the ALA volunteers to Lebanon. We left behind most of the villagers, many dead or injure....\\"Nazzal 1948, pp. 93‚Äì95 Those left behind said that Israeli soldiers had entered Safsaf around sunrise and ordered the villagers to line up in a spot in the northern part of the village. One villager told Nazzal: \\"As we lined up, a few Jewish soldiers ordered four girls to accompany them to carry water for the soldiers. Instead, they took them to our empty houses and raped them. About seventy of our men were blindfolded and shot to death, one after the other, in front of us. The soldiers took their bodies and threw them on the cement covering of the village's spring and dumped sand on them.\\" In later days, Israeli troops visited the village, telling the inhabitants that they should forget what had occurred and could stay in their homes.

As the site of the Battle of Hattin in 1187, in which Saladin conquered most of Palestine from the Crusaders, it has become an Arab nationalist symbol. The shrine of Nabi Shu'ayb, venerated by the Druze and Sunni Muslims as the tomb of Jethro, is on the village land. The village was ruled by the Ottoman Empire from the 16th century until the end of World War I, when Palestine became part of the British Mandate for Palestine. In the 1948 Arab-Israeli war, the village was depopulated. History Horns of Hattin Hittin was located on the northern slopes of the double hill known as the \\"Horns of Hattin.\\" It was strategically and commercially significant due to its location overlooking the Plain of Hittin, which opens onto the coastal lowlands of Lake Tiberias to the east, and to the west is linked by mountain passes leading towards the plains of lower Galilee. These plains, with their east-west passages, served as routes for commercial caravans and military invasions throughout the ages.Khalidi, 1992, p. 521. =Prehistory= Archaeological excavations at the village have yielded pottery fragments from the Pottery Neolithic and Chalcolithic period.Nimrod Getzov, 2007, Hittin, Volume 119, Year 2007, Israel Antiquities Authority =Bronze Age to Byzantine Period= An Early Bronze Age wall was excavated at the village. The Arab village may have been built over the Canaanite town of Siddim or Ziddim (), which in the third century BCE acquired the Old Hebrew name Kfar Hittin (\\"village of grain\\"). It was known as Kfar Hittaya in the Roman period.Jerusalem Talmud, Megillah 1:1 (2a)See p. 77 [21] in: In the 4th century CE, it was a Jewish rabbinical town. =Crusader/Ayyubid and Mamluk periods= Hittin was located near the site of the Battle of Hattin, where Saladin defeated the Crusaders in 1187.Lane-Poole, 1898, pp. 197 ff It is described as having been near the base camp of Saladin's Ayyubid army, by Lieutenant-Colonel Claude Conder in Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem (1897).Conder, 1897, p. 149 Many prominent figures from the Islamic period in Palestine were born or buried in Hittin, according to early Arab geographers such as Yaqut al-Hamawi (1179‚Äì1229) and al-Ansari al-Dimashqi (1256‚Äì1327), who himself was called the Shaykh of Hittin. 'Ali al-Dawadari, the writer, Quranic exegetist, and calligrapher, died in the village in 1302. =Ottoman period= In 1596, Hittin was a part of the Ottoman NƒÅ·∏•iyah (, \\"Subdistrict\\") of Tiberias under the LiwƒÅ‚Äô (, \\"District\\") of Safed. The villagers paid taxes on wheat, barley, olives, goats and beehives.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 190. Quoted in Khalidi, p. 521.Note that Rhode, 1979, p. 6 writes that the register that H√ºtteroth and Abdul-Fattah studied was not from 1595/6, but from 1548/9 In 1646, the bulaydah (, \\"small village\\") was visited by Evliya √áelebi, who described it as follows: \\"It is a village in the territory of Safad, consisting of 200 Muslim houses. No Druzes live here. It is like a flourishing little town (bulayda) abounding with vineyards, orchards and gardens. Water and air are refreshing. A large fair is held there once a week, when ten thousand men would gather from the neighbourhood to sell and buy. It is situated in a spacious valley, bordered on both sides by low rocks. There is a mosque, a public bath and a caravanserei in it.\\" √áelebi also reported that there was a shrine called the Teyk√© Mughraby, inhabited by over one hundred dervishes, which held the grave of Sheikh 'ImƒÅd ed-dƒ´n, of the family of the prophet Shu'eib, who was reputed to have lived for two hundred years. Richard Pococke, who visited in 1727, writes that it is \\"famous for some pleasant gardens of lemon and orange trees; and here the Turks have a mosque, to which they pay great veneration, having, as they say, a great sheik buried there, whom they call Sede Ishab, who, according to tradition (as a very learned Jew assured me) is Jethro, the father-in-law of Moses.\\"Pococke, 1745, vol 2, p. 67 Around this time and until the late 18th century, Hittin was a small village in the autonomous sheikhdom of Zahir al-Umar. In 1767, Zahir's son Sa'id sought to control Hittin and nearby Tur'an, but was defeated by his father. Nonetheless, Zahir granted Sa'id both villages when he pardoned him.Joudah, 1987, pp. 51-52. A map from Napoleon's invasion of 1799 by Pierre Jacotin showed the place, named as Hattin.Karmon, 1960, p. 166. Johann Ludwig Burckhardt, a Swiss traveller to Palestine around 1817, noted Hittin as a village,Burckhardt, 1822, pp. 319, 336 while in 1838 Edward Robinson described it as a small village of stone houses.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, p. 250 William McClure Thomson, who visited in the 1850s, found \\"gigantic\\" hedges of cactus surrounding Hittin. He reported that visiting the local shrine was considered a cure for insanity.Thomson, 1859, vol 2, pp. 117-118 In 1863 H. B. Tristram, wrote about the \\"bright faces and bright colours\\" he saw there, and the \\"peculiar\\" costumes: \\"long tight gowns, or cassocks, of scarlet silk, with diagonal yellow stripes, and generally a bright red and blue or yellow jacket over them; while their cheeks were encircled by dollars and piastres, after Nazareth fashion, and some of the more wealthy wore necklaces of gold coins, with a doubloon for pendant in front.\\"Tristram, 1865, p. 451 In 1875 Victor Gu√©rin visited the village, mentioning in his writings that there was a local tradition that alleged that the tomb of Jethro (Neby Cha æƒ´b), the father-in- law of Moses, was to be found in the village.Gu√©rin, 1880, pp. 190-191 In 1881, the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine described Hittin as a large well- built village of stone, surrounded by fruit and olive trees. It had an estimated 400-700 villagers, all Muslim, who cultivated the surrounding plain.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p .360. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 521 A population list from about 1887 showed Hattin to have about 1,350 inhabitants; 100 Jews and 1,250 Muslims.Schumacher, 1888, p. 185 An elementary school was established in the village around 1897. Conder writes in his Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem (1897): \\"The place was surrounded by olives and fruit trees, and a good spring‚Äîcopious and fresh‚Äîflowed on the northwest into the gorge of Wadi Hammam.\\" In the early 20th-century, some of the village land in the eastern part of the Arbel Valley was sold to Jewish land purchase societies. In 1910, the first Jewish village, Mitzpa, was established there. =British Mandate= Hittin during the British Mandate, by Fadil Saba, Nazareth In 1924, the second Jewish village, Kfar Hittim, was established on land purchased from Hattin. In the 1922 census of Palestine, conducted by the Mandatory Palestine authorities, the population of Hattin was 889; 880 Muslims and 9 Jews,Barron, 1923, Table xi, Sub-district of Tiberias, p. 39 increasing in the 1931 census to 931, all Muslims, in a total of 190 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 82 In 1932 Sheikh Izz ad-Din al-Qassam and the local Palestinian leadership affiliated with the Istiqlal party inaugurated a celebration on the anniversary of Saladin's victory in Hittin. Hittin Day, held on August 27 of that year in the courtyard of a school in Haifa, was intended to be an anti- imperialist rally. It was attended by thousands of people from Palestine, Lebanon, Damascus, and Transjordan. The speeches delivered at the event centered around the independence of the Arab world and the importance of unity between Arab Muslims and Christians.Matthews, 2006, p. 153 In 1945, Hittin had a population of 1,190 Muslims with a total land area of 22,764 dunams (22.764 km2), of which 22,086 dunams were Arab-owned and 147 dunams were Jewish-owned. The remaining 531 dunams were public property. Cultivable land amounted to 12,426 dunams, while uncultivated land amounted to 10,268 dunams. Of the cultivated land, 1,967 dunams consisted of plantations and irrigable land, and 10,462 dunams were devoted to cereals.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 122 The built-up area of the village was 70 dunams and it was populated entirely by Arabs.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 172 =1948 War= In 1948 the village mukhtar was Ahmad ¬¥Azzam Abu Radi. According to the villagers, they did not feel threatened by their Jewish neighbours at Kfar Hittim, who had visited in November 1947 after the UN vote in favor of the United Nations Partition Plan, and assured the villagers they did not want war.Nazzal, 1978, p. 84A History of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, Mark Tessler, Indiana University Press There were 50 men in the village who had rifles, with 25-50 rounds of ammunition each. Mosque of Hittin, 2007 The villagers grew anxious listening to Radio Amman and Radio Damascus, but remained uninvolved until June 9, when Jewish fighters attacked the neighbouring village of Lubya and were repulsed. Shortly after an Israeli armoured unit, accompanied by infantry, advanced towards the village from the direction of Mitzpa. The attack was rebuffed, but all the local ammunition was used up.Nazzal, 1978, p. 85 On the night of July 16‚Äì17, almost all the inhabitants of the village evacuated. Many left for Sallama, between Deir Hanna and Maghar, leaving behind a few elderly people and 30-35 militiamen. On July 17, Hittin was occupied by the Golani Brigade as part of Operation Dekel.Morris, 2004, p. 423 When the villagers tried to return, they were chased off. On one occasion, some men and pack animals were killed.Yehuda, Golani Brigade\\\\Intelligence, Daily Summary 25-26.8, IDFA 1096\\\\49\\\\\\\\\\\\64. Cited in Morris, 2004, p. 445 The villagers remained at Salamah for almost a month, but as their food-supply dwindled and their hope of returning faded, they left together for Lebanon. Some resettled in Nazareth. The Israeli government considered allowing 560 internally displaced Palestinians from Hittin and Alut to return to their villages, but the army objected to Hittin for security reasons.Masalha, 2005, p. 107 =State of Israel= Village mosque, with minaret, in 2019 In 1949 and 1950, the Jewish villages of Arbel and Kfar Zeitim were founded on the lands of Hittin.Khalidi, 1992, p. 523 In the 1950s, the Druze community in Israel was given official custodianship over the Jethro shrine and 100 dunams of land around it. A request to build housing there for Druze soldiers was rejected. The Druze annual pilgrimage continued to be held and was officially recognized as a religious holiday by Israel in 1954.Firro, 1999, p. 236 According to Ilan Papp√©, a resident of Deir Hanna unsuccessfully applied to hold a summer camp on the site of the Hittin mosque, which he hoped to restore. The land is currently used as grazing pasture by the nearby kibbutzim. According to tradition, the mosque was built by Saladin in 1187 to commemorate his victory over the Crusaders.Papp√©, 2006, p. 218 In 2007, an Israeli-Palestinian advocacy organization, Zochrot, protested development plans that encroach on the site and threaten to \\"swallow up the abandoned remains of the Hittin village.\\" Nicolle, 1993, p. 91 Nabi Shu¬¥ayb shrine, the tomb of Jethro Ali of Herat wrote (c. 1173) that both Jethro and his wife were buried in Hittin. Yaqut al-Hamawi (1179‚Äì1229) wrote that another shrine near Arsuf that claimed to be the tomb of Shu¬¥aib was misidentified.le Strange, 1890, p.450, p.451 Sunni Muslims and Druze would make ziyarat pilgrimages to Hittin to the tomb of Jethro, and the Druze celebration attracted members of their sect from other parts of the region of Syria. Demographics In 1596 Hittin had a population of 605. In the 1922 census of Palestine Hittin had a population of 889, which rose to 931 in the 1931 census. There were 190 houses that year.Bitan, 1982, p. 101. In 1945 the population was estimated at 1,190 Arabs.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 72 The village had a number of large and influential families; Rabah, 'Azzam, Shaiyabtah, Sa'adah, Sha'ban, and Dahabra.

Bed and breakfasts are often private family homes and typically have between four and eleven rooms, with six being the average. In addition, a B&B; usually has the hosts living in the house. Bed and breakfast is also used to describe the level of catering included in a hotel's room prices, as opposed to room only, half-board or full-board. Overview Generally, guests are accommodated in private bedrooms with private bathrooms, or in a suite of rooms including an en suite bathroom. Some homes have private bedrooms with a bathroom which is shared with other guests. Breakfast is served in the bedroom, a dining room, or the host's kitchen. B&Bs; and guest houses may be operated as either a secondary source of income or a primary occupation. Often the owners themselves prepare the breakfast and clean the rooms, but some bed and breakfasts hire staff for cleaning or cooking. Properties with hired professional management are uncommon (unlike inns or hotels) but may exist if the same owner operates multiple B&Bs. Some B&Bs; operate in a niche market. Floating bed and breakfasts are boats or houseboats which offer B&B; accommodation; the CCGS Alexander Henry museum ship was one example. In some communities, former lighthouse keeper quarters have been turned into B&B; rooms after the light has been automated or decommissioned. International differences =China= In China expatriates have remodelled traditional structures in quiet picturesque rural areas and opened a few rustic boutique hotels with minimum amenities. Most patrons are foreign tourists but they are growing in popularity among Chinese domestic tourists. =Cuba= In Cuba, which opened up to tourism in the 1990s after the financial support of the Soviet Union ended, a form of B&B; called casa particular (\\"private home\\") became the main form of accommodation outside the tourist resorts. Not all casas particulares offer breakfast. =India= In India, the government is promoting the concept of bed & breakfast.Guidelines For Approval and Registration of 'Incredible India Bed And Breakfast' Establishments (MS Word Document) The government is doing this to increase tourism, especially keeping in view of the demand for hotels during the 2010 Commonwealth Games in Delhi. They have classified B&Bs; in 2 categories ‚Äì Gold B&Bs;, and Silver B&Bs.; All B&Bs; must be approved by the Ministry of Tourism, who will then categorize it as Gold or Silver based upon a list of pre-defined criteria. Enormous growth in metro cities like Delhi, Gurgaon, Pune, Bangalore and Mumbai have seen such rapid growth that people are rushing to these cities to find a respectable job for their respective trades, and operating or hosting a Bed & Breakfast is becoming a favourite option among them. Average B&B; service providers are offering standard services and other accoutrements that westerners have come to expect when traveling abroad. The basics include: air-conditioner or air cooler, free food, and free wi-fi internet. Premium providers may offer extra services to justify the increased price. Some of these services include, but are not limited to: buildings with a lift/elevator, no surcharge electricity use for the duration of a customers stay, and free geyser usage. 50Mbit/s to 100Mbit/s leased internet line for guests, an intercom system, and security with IP cameras (which is mandatory by local state government and police department) that are monitored by security guards 24*7 rounds out the services provided to premium properties. =Ireland= Registered Irish B&Bs; are star rated by F√°ilte Ireland. Generally, B&Bs; in Ireland are family owned & run, with a small percentage being leased/managed but still with the personal service expected in this sector. Owners or managers nearly always live on the premises. Breakfast can mean a cooked \\"Irish Fry\\" or continental style buffet. =Israel= Patio of a guest house in Tamchy, Kyrgyzstan The Israeli B&B; is known as a zimmer (German for 'room'). All over the country, but especially in northern Israel (Galilee, Upper Galilee and the Golan Heights) the zimmer has developed into an extensive industry. This industry began to develop in the 1990s, when agriculture became less profitable, and many families with farms in moshavim, kibbutzim, farms and even in cities decided to try their luck in the business of hospitality. In the last decade, there has been development of bed and breakfasts also in southern Israel in the Negev. =Italy= In Italy, regional law regulates B&Bs.; There is a national law \\"Legge 29 marzo 2001, n. 135\\" but each region maintains a specific regulation. Each region can adopt different regulations but they must observe the national law on Tourism (Law N¬∞ 135 /2001). =Netherlands= Bed & Breakfast in the Netherlands literally means what it says, namely 'bed with breakfast'. In the Netherlands, it is also often referred to as lodgings with breakfast, a guestroom or guesthouse. Bed & Breakfast is a small-scale type of accommodation, which is available to guests for a short stay. Nearly all bed & breakfasts are established in a residential home and are run by the owners of that particular residence. Dutch bed & breakfasts are commonly held in historic monumental houses or farms. =Pakistan= The trend of B&Bs; in Pakistan is quite widespread. Popular resorts like Murree, which attract many tourists from different parts of the country, have a number of such resthouses. The expenses can vary, depending on the quality of facilities. Most bed and breakfast facilities tend to expediently cater to families, given the high level of group tourism, and offer suitable overnight lodging. Carriage B&B; Hinto Panzio in Transylvania, Odorheiu Secuiesc, Romania =Romania= While exploring Romania's countryside, smaller cities or traditional villages, visitors can stay at a bed and breakfast (usually called \\"Pensiune\\"). Bed and Breakfast in Romania are rated with daisies, from one to three, three daisies being the best rating. =Spain= Bed and breakfast is a 21st-century phenomenon in Spain. In the past, the equivalent was Habitacion con derecho a cocina which means \\"room along with use of the kitchen area\\". In Spain, bed and breakfast offers are provided by hotels, hostels, apartments, houses and Inns. Normally bed and breakfast flats or houses consist of 5-7 rooms but as they are not heavily regulated, people are free to provide their houses as bed and breakfast to pay for some of the bills. =Sweden= Bed and breakfast was more or less a direct import from the British style B&B.; The B&B; isn't evenly spread over the country, most are in southern province of Sk√•ne or near one of the three larger cities, Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malm√∂. Some breakfast hotels and other minor hotels trying to profit from the name also call their accommodation B&B.; No laws in Sweden restrict such advertising; the only restriction is from the authority of traffic (Trafikverket), who only give permission to put up the bed and breakfast sign by the local road if the owner lives in the same building as the guests. If the proprietor has less than eight beds, no permissions from the police office is required to run public accommodations, but fire safety and food safety applies to all new facilities, regardless of the number of beds. In a Swedish B&B; there is often a guest kitchen available. Standard is usually acceptable but sometimes with en-suite bathroom or sometimes a shared bathroom in the corridor. =United Kingdom= Little Langford Farmhouse, Salisbury, Wiltshire There are numerous B&Bs; found in seaside towns, the countryside as well as city centres.http://home.bt.com/lifestyle/travel/holiday-inspiration/national-bed- and-breakfast-day-heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-history-of-the- b-b-11364258243456 B&Bs; are graded by VisitBritain on a star system. 3, 4 and 5-star establishments have a higher standard. A majority of B&Bs; in the UK have en-suite facilities. =United States= Front yard of a B&B; in the Dupont Circle neighborhood of Washington, D.C. The custom of opening one's home to travellers dates back the earliest days of Colonial America. Lodging establishments were few and far between in the 18th century and, apart from a limited number of coaching inns, wayfarers relied on the kindness of strangers to provide a bed for the night. Hotels became more common with the advent of the railroad and later the automobile; most towns had at least one prominent hotel. During the Great Depression, tourist homes provided an economic advantage to both the traveller and the host. Driving through town on US Highways (in a pre-Interstate highway era), travellers stopped at houses with signs reading Tourists or Guests, where one could rent a room for the night for approximately $2. While little more than short-stay boarding houses, the rooms brought needed income for the home owner and saved money for the traveller. A tourist home or guest house represented an intermediate option between inexpensive campgrounds or cabins and costly railway hotels. (The motel fad of the 1950s and 1960s later filled this niche, now occupied by economy limited service hotels.) Non-white travellers could consult The Negro Motorist Green Book, a printed directory, to find lodging at which they would be welcome despite racial segregation and widespread discrimination. After World War II, middle-class Americans began travelling in Europe in large numbers, many experiencing the European-style B&Bs; (Zimmer frei in Germany, chambres d'hotes in France) for the first time. Some were inspired to open B&Bs; in the U.S.; tourist home owners updated their properties as B&Bs.; The interest in B&Bs; coincided with an increasing interest in historic preservation, spurred by the U.S. Bicentennial in 1976 and assisted by two crucial pieces of legislation: the National Historic Preservation Act of 1966, and the Tax Reform Act of 1976, which provided tax incentives for the restoration and reuse of historic structures. Through the 1980s and 1990s, B&Bs; increased rapidly in numbers and evolved from homestay B&Bs; with shared baths and a simple furnishings to beautifully renovated historic mansions with luxurious d√©cor and amenities. Printed directories listed options in various cities. By the mid-1990s, the Internet made it more affordable for innkeepers to promote their properties worldwide; it provided online reservation software and allowed travellers to view detailed photos, videos, and reviews. B&B; and Inn owners have been adding amenities such as wireless Internet access, free parking, spa services or nightly wine and cheese hours. To stay competitive with the rest of the lodging industry, larger bed and breakfast inns have expanded to offer wedding services, business conference facilities, and meeting spaces as well as many other services a large hotel might offer. There are approximately 17,000 B&Bs; in the United States. B&Bs; are found in all states, in major cities and remote rural areas, occupying everything from modest cottages to opulent mansions, and in restored structures from schools to cabooses, churches, treehouses and yurts. Regulations Regulations and laws vary considerably between jurisdictions both in content and extent and in enforcement. The most common regulations B&Bs; must follow pertain to safety. They are usually required by local and national ordinances to have fire resistance, a sufficient fire escape plan in place, and smoke detectors in each guest room. Kitchens and equipment used to serve meals are also often required to be monitored for hygienic operation, but there are significant national and local differences. In Hawaii, it is illegal to open a new bed & breakfast on Oahu as of 1989. The reason for the moratorium is to force home owners with extra room to rent out their extra space to low income residents who otherwise cannot afford housing on crowded Oahu. Professional and trade associations Many inns and bed and breakfasts are members of professional associations. There are international, national, regional, and local associations, all of which provide services to both their members and the travelling public. Many require their members to meet specific standards of quality, while others simply require a lodging establishment to pay dues. These associations also facilitate marketing of the individual B&Bs; and provide a stamp of approval that the business in question is reputable. While various local governments have regulations and inspect lodging establishments for health and safety issues, membership in a state/provincial/national bed and breakfast association can indicate a higher standard of hospitality. Associations sometimes review their members' properties and tend to have additional standards of care. In the US for example, each state has an innkeeping association (usually non-profit) that exists to promote the industry and tourism. Within those state associations, many city and regional bed and breakfast associations can be found. Many state, city and regional associations, have inspection criteria that often exceed government requirements for safety and cleanliness. The two primary nationwide professional associations are the Professional Association of Innkeepers International (PAII), based in Wisconsin and founded in 1987 by two innkeepers, and the Association of Independent Hospitality Professionals (AIHP). In Australia, the industry is represented by the Bed & Breakfast, Farmstay and Accommodation Australia Ltd (BBFAA). In the British Isles the national approval boards set up by governments are far more stringent than others and standards are expected to be high.

Like other transmission systems on vehicles, it allows an internal combustion engine, best suited to run at a relatively high rotational speed, to provide a range of speed and torque outputs necessary for vehicular travel. The number of forward gear ratios is often expressed for manual transmissions as well (e.g., 6-speed manual). The most popular form found in automobiles is the hydraulic planetary automatic transmission. Similar but larger devices are also used for heavy-duty commercial and industrial vehicles and equipment. This system uses a fluid coupling in place of friction clutch, and accomplishes gear changes by hydraulically locking and unlocking a system of planetary gears. These systems have a defined set of gear ranges, often with a parking pawl that locks the output shaft of the transmission to keep the vehicle from rolling either forward or backward. Some machines with limited speed ranges or fixed engine speeds, such as some forklifts and lawn mowers, only use a torque converter to provide a variable gearing of the engine to the wheels. Besides conventional hydraulic automatic transmissions with torque converters, there are also other types of automated transmissions, such as belt-driven continuously variable transmissions (CVT), automated manual transmissions (AMT), dual-clutch transmissions (DCT), that free the driver from having to shift gears manually, by using the transmission's computer to change gear, if for example; the driver was redlining the engine. Despite superficial similarity to other transmissions, traditional automatic transmissions differ significantly in internal operation and driver's feel from automated manuals and CVTs. In contrast to conventional automatic transmissions, a CVT uses a belt or other torque transmission scheme to allow an \\"infinite\\" number of gear ratios instead of a fixed number of gear ratios. An automated manual retains a clutch like a conventional manual transmission, but controls and depresses the clutch through electrohydraulic means, and automates the clutch and shifting process. The ability to shift gears manually, often via paddle shifters, can also be found on certain automatic transmissions (manumatics such as Tiptronic), automated manuals (BMW SMG, Ferrari F1, VW Group DSG), and CVTs (such as Lineartronic). The obvious advantage of an automatic transmission to the driver is the lack of a clutch pedal and manual shift pattern in normal driving. This allows the driver to operate the car with as few as two limbs (possibly using assistive devices to position controls within reach of usable limbs), allowing individuals with disabilities to drive. The lack of manual shifting also reduces the attention and workload required inside the cabin, such as monitoring the tachometer and taking a hand off the wheel to move the shifter, allowing the driver to ideally keep both hands on the wheel at all times and to focus more on the road. Control of the car at low speeds is often easier with an automatic than a manual, due to a side effect of the clutchless fluid-coupling design called idle creep that causes the car to slowly move on its own while in a driving gear, even at idle. The primary disadvantage of the most popular hydraulic designs is reduced mechanical efficiency of the power transfer between engine and drivetrain, due to the fluid coupling connecting the engine to the gearbox. This can result in lower power/torque ratings for automatics compared to manuals with the same engine specs, as well as reduced fuel efficiency in city driving as the engine must maintain idle against the resistance of the fluid coupling. Advances in transmission and coupler design have narrowed this gap considerably, but clutch-based transmissions (manual or semi-automatic) are still preferred in sport-tuned trim levels of various production cars, as well as in many auto racing leagues. The automatic transmission was invented in 1921 by Alfred Horner Munro of Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, and patented under Canadian patent CA 235757 in 1923. (Munro obtained UK patent GB215669 215,669 for his invention in 1924 and US patent 1,613,525 on 4 January 1927). The first automatic transmission using hydraulic fluid was developed in 1932 by two Brazilian engineers, Jos√© Braz Araripe and Fernando Lehly Lemos; the prototype and design were later sold to General Motors, which exhibited a technology in the 1940s Oldsmobile model as a \\"Hydra-Matic\\" transmission. Being a steam engineer, Munro designed his device to use compressed air rather than hydraulic fluid, and so it lacked power and never found commercial application. One of the earliest examples of hydraulic fully automatic transmission is the Hydramatic, developed by General Motors in 1932. History Modern automatic transmissions can trace their origins to an early \\"horseless carriage\\" gearbox that was developed in 1904 by the Sturtevant brothers of Boston, Massachusetts. This unit had two forward speeds, the ratio change being brought about by flyweights that were driven by the engine. At higher engine speeds, high gear was engaged. As the vehicle slowed down and engine RPM decreased, the gearbox would shift back to low. Unfortunately, the metallurgy of the time wasn't up to the task, and owing to the abruptness of the gear change, the transmission would often fail without warning. One of the key developments in arriving at an automatic transmission was the use of planetary transmission in the vehicle's gearbox. Probably the first use of which was in the Wilson-Pilcher made between 1900 and 1907. The Wilson-Pilcher used two epicyclic gear trains allowing 4 forward gears to be selected by moving a single gear change lever. In this form of a gearbox, the planetary gears are in constant mesh, and all that is required is to use a mechanism to fix or release the rotation of the outer gear ring. The action of the gear change lever mechanically locked or freed the outer ring of each epicyclic gear by an internal brake/clutch. The vehicle also had a separate cone clutch operated by a foot pedal which could be latched in position to run the engine when stationary, e.g. for starting. Like more modern automatic transmissions the gears were helical to reduce noise and were sealed inside an oil-filled gearbox. There are no reports of the manufacturer seeking to automate the changing of the gears, though the design eliminated the requirement for using the foot clutch except when starting or stopping. A better-known car that also used planetary transmission was Henry Ford's Model T of 1908. The Model T, in addition to being cheap and reliable by the standards of the day, featured a simple, two speed plus reverse planetary transmission using straight cut gears whose operation was manually controlled by the driver using pedals. The pedals actuated the transmission's friction elements (bands and clutches) to select the desired gear. In some respects, this type of transmission was less demanding of the driver's skills than the contemporary, unsynchronized manual transmission, but still required that the driver know when to make a shift, as well as how to get the car off to a smooth start. The use of the automobile's speed to power the changing of gears without a clutch was first patented in the U.S. in 1923. On November 12, 1921, Henry R. Hoffman of Chicago, Illinois applied for a patent titled: \\"Automatic Gear Shift and Speed Control.\\" The Patent Office approved Mr. Hoffman's invention on November 27, 1923 (U.S. Patent Office # 1475,265.) The objectives of his patent were the elimination of manual shifting of gears and the need for a clutch. He summarized how the automatic function would work: \\". . . having a series of clutches disposed intermediate the engine shaft and the differential shaft and in which the clutches are arranged to selectively engage and drive the differential shaft dependent upon the speed at which the differential shaft rotates.\\" The U.S. Patent Office then approved two improvements of Mr. Hoffman's 1923 Patent in 1924 (#1,502,953) and 1925 (# 1,539,188). In 1934, both REO and General Motors developed semi-automatic transmissions that were less difficult to operate than a fully manual unit. These designs, however, continued to use a clutch to engage the engine with the transmission. The General Motors unit, dubbed the \\"Automatic Safety Transmission\\", was notable in that it employed a power- shifting planetary gearbox that was hydraulically controlled and was sensitive to road speed, anticipating future development. Parallel to the development in the 1930s of an automatically shifting gearbox was Chrysler's work on adapting the fluid coupling to automotive use. Invented early in the 20th century, the fluid coupling was the answer to the question of how to avoid stalling the engine when the vehicle was stopped with the transmission in gear. Chrysler itself never used the fluid coupling with any of its automatic transmissions, but did use it in conjunction with a hybrid manual transmission called \\"Fluid Drive\\" (the similar Hy-Drive used a torque converter). These developments in the automatic gearbox and fluid coupling technology eventually culminated in the introduction in 1939 of the General Motors Hydra-Matic, the world's first mass-produced automatic transmission. Available as an option in 1940 Oldsmobiles and later Cadillacs, the Hydra-Matic combined a fluid coupling with three hydraulically controlled planetary gearsets to produce four forward speeds plus reverse. The transmission was sensitive to engine throttle position and road speed, producing fully automatic up- and down-shifting that varied according to operating conditions. The Hydra-Matic was subsequently adopted by Cadillac and Pontiac, and was sold to various other automakers, including Bentley, Hudson, Kaiser, Nash, and Rolls-Royce. It also found use during World War II in some military vehicles. From 1950 to 1954, Lincoln cars were also available with the Hydra-Matic. Mercedes-Benz subsequently devised a four-speed fluid coupling transmission that was similar in principle to the Hydra-Matic, but of a different design. The original Hydra-Matic incorporated two features which are widely emulated in today's transmissions. The Hydra- Matic's ratio spread through the four gears produced excellent \\"step-off\\" and acceleration in first, a good spacing of intermediate gears, and the effect of overdrive in fourth, by virtue of the low numerical rear axle ratio used in the vehicles of the time. In addition, in third and fourth gear, the fluid coupling only handled a portion of the engine's torque, resulting in a high degree of efficiency. In this respect, the transmission's behavior was similar to modern units incorporating a lock-up torque converter. In 1956, GM introduced the \\"Jetaway\\" Hydra-Matic, which was different in design than the older model. Addressing the issue of shift quality, which was an ongoing problem with the original Hydra-Matic, the new transmission utilized two fluid couplings, the primary one that linked the transmission to the engine, and a secondary one that replaced the clutch assembly that controlled the forward gearset in the original. The result was much smoother shifting, especially from first to second gear, but with a loss in efficiency and an increase in complexity. Another innovation for this new style Hydra-Matic was the appearance of a Park position on the selector. The original Hydra-Matic, which continued in production until the mid-1960s, still used the reverse position for parking pawl engagement. The first torque converter automatic, Buick's Dynaflow, was introduced for the 1948 model year. It was followed by Packard's Ultramatic in mid-1949 and Chevrolet's Powerglide for the 1950 model year. Each of these transmissions had only two forward speeds, relying on the converter for additional torque multiplication. In the early 1950s, BorgWarner developed a series of three-speed torque converter automatics for American Motors, Ford Motor Company, Studebaker, and several other manufacturers in the US and other countries. Chrysler was late in developing its own true automatic, introducing the two-speed torque converter PowerFlite in 1953, and the three-speed TorqueFlite in 1956. The latter was the first to utilize the Simpson compound planetary gearset. General Motors produced multiple-turbine torque converters from 1954 to 1961. These included the Twin-Turbine Dynaflow and the triple-turbine Turboglide transmissions. The shifting took place in the torque converter, rather than through pressure valves and changes in planetary gear connections. Each turbine was connected to the drive shaft through a different gear train. These phased from one ratio to another according to demand, rather than shifting. The Turboglide actually had two- speed ratios in reverse, with one of the turbines rotating backward. In 1964, General Motors released a new second generation of the Hydra-Matic transmission, the Turbo Hydramatic three-speed transmission, among the first to have the basic gear selections (Park, Reverse, Neutral, Drive, Low) which are still used in automobiles to this day.Turbo-Hydramatic By the late 1960s, most of the fluid-coupling four-speed and two-speed transmissions had disappeared in favor of three-speed units with torque converters. Also around this time, whale oil was removed from the automatic transmission fluid.Almost Burned By the early 1980s, these were being supplemented and eventually replaced by overdrive-equipped transmissions providing four or more forward speeds. Many transmissions also adopted the lock-up torque converter (a mechanical clutch locking the torque converter pump and turbine together to eliminate slip at cruising speed) to improve fuel economy. As computerized engine control units (ECUs) became more capable, much of the logic built into the transmission's valve body was offloaded to the ECU. Some manufacturers use a separate computer dedicated to the transmission called a transmission control unit (TCU), also known as the transmission control module (TCM), which shares information with the engine management computer. In this case, solenoids turned on and off by the computer control shift patterns and gear ratios, rather than the spring-loaded valves in the valve body. This allows for more precise control of shift points, shift quality, lower shift times, and (on some newer cars) manual control, where the driver tells the computer when to shift. The result is an impressive combination of efficiency and smoothness. Some computers even identify the driver's style and adapt to best suit it. ZF Friedrichshafen and BMW were responsible for introducing the first six-speed (the ZF 6HP26 in the 2002 BMW 7 Series (E65)). Mercedes-Benz's 7G-Tronic was the first seven-speed in 2003, with Toyota introducing an eight- speed in 2007 on the Lexus LS 460 which was equivalent in size to a six-speed . Derived from the 7G-Tronic, Mercedes-Benz unveiled an automated manual transmission with the torque converter replaced with a wet multi clutch called the AMG SPEEDSHIFT MCT. The 2014 Jeep Cherokee has the world's first nine- speed automatic transmission for a passenger vehicle to market. In 2017 Toyota unveiled the Lexus LC coupe with the world's first ten-speed automatic transmission in a production car. General Motors and Ford followed soon after with their co-developed ten-speed automatic transmission for the Cadillac Escalade, Cadillac CT6, Chevrolet Camaro, Chevrolet Tahoe models for GM and the Ford Mustang, Ford F-150, Lincoln Navigator, Ford Ranger (T6) and Ford Everest models for Ford. Parts and operation =Hydraulic automatic transmissions= The predominant form of the automatic transmission is hydraulically operated; using a fluid coupling or torque converter, and a set of planetary gearsets to provide a range of gear ratios. 8-speed ZF 8HP showing the major stages of a hydraulic automatic transmission: the torque converter (left), the planetary gearsets and clutch plates (center), as well as hydraulic and electronic controls (bottom). Hydraulic automatic transmissions consist of three major components: Torque converter A type of fluid coupling, hydraulically connecting the engine to the transmission. This takes the place of friction clutch in a manual transmission. It transmits and decouples the engine power to the planetary gears, allowing the vehicle to come to stop with the engine still running and in gear without stalling. A torque converter differs from a fluid coupling, in that it provides a variable amount of torque multiplication at low engine speeds, increasing breakaway acceleration. A fluid coupling works well when both the impeller and turbine are rotating at similar speeds, but it is very inefficient at initial acceleration, where rotational speeds are very different. This torque multiplication is accomplished with a third member in the coupling assembly known as the stator, which acts to modify the fluid flow depending on the relative rotational speeds of the impeller and turbine. The stator itself does not rotate, but its vanes are so shaped that when the impeller (which is driven by the engine) is rotating at a high speed and the turbine (which receives the transmitted power) is spinning at a low speed, the fluid flow hits the vanes of the turbine in a way that multiplies the torque being applied. This causes the turbine (and the vehicle) to accelerate more quickly when the engine speed increases (ideally), and as the relative rotational speeds equalize, the torque multiplication diminishes. Once the impeller and turbine are rotating within 10% of each other's speed, the stator ceases to function and the torque converter acts as a simple fluid coupling. Planetary gear train The planetary gear train is composed of planetary gear sets as well as clutches and bands. It is the mechanical system that provides the various gear ratios, altering the speed of rotation of the output shaft depending on which planetary gears are locked. To effect gear changes, one of two types of clutches or bands are used to hold a particular member of the planetary gearset motionless, while allowing another member to rotate, thereby transmitting torque and producing gear reductions or overdrive ratios. These clutches are actuated by the valve body (see below), their sequence controlled by the transmission's internal programming. Principally, a type of device known as a sprag or roller clutch is used for routine upshifts/downshifts. Operating much as a ratchet, it transmits torque only in one direction, free-wheeling or \\"overrunning\\" in the other. The advantage of this type of clutch is that it eliminates the sensitivity of timing a simultaneous clutch release/apply on two planetaries, simply \\"taking up\\" the drivetrain load when actuated, and releasing automatically when the next gear's sprag clutch assumes the torque transfer. The bands come into play for manually selected gears, such as low range or reverse, and operate on the planetary drum's circumference. Bands are not applied when the drive/overdrive range is selected, the torque being transmitted by the sprag clutches instead. Bands are used for braking; the GM Turbo-Hydramatics incorporated this.. Hydraulic controls The transmission uses special transmission fluid sent under pressure by an oil pump to control various clutches and bands, modifying the speed of the output depending on the vehicle's running condition. Not to be confused with the impeller inside the torque converter, the pump is typically a gear pump mounted between the torque converter and the planetary gear set. It draws transmission fluid from a pump and pressurizes it, which is needed for transmission components to operate. The input for the pump is connected to the torque converter housing, which in turn is bolted to the engine's flexplate, so the pump provides pressure whenever the engine is running and there is enough transmission fluid, but the disadvantage is that when the engine is not running, no oil pressure is available to operate the main components of the transmission, and it is thus impossible to push-start a vehicle equipped with an automatic transmission with no rear pump. Early automatic transmissions had a rear pump for towing and push-starting purposes, ensuring the lubrication of the rear-end components. However, if this pump failed, pieces of metal would be drawn through the transmission requiring a complete rebuild. For this reason, to ensure reliability the rear pump was sometimes removed by importers of the vehicles concerned. The governor is connected to the output shaft and regulates the hydraulic pressure depending on the vehicle speed. The valve body is the hydraulic control center that receives pressurized fluid from the main pump operated by the fluid coupling/torque converter. The pressure coming from this pump is regulated and used to run a network of spring-loaded valves, check balls, and servo pistons. The valves use the pump pressure and the pressure from a centrifugal governor on the output side (as well as hydraulic signals from the range selector valves and the throttle valve or modulator) to control which ratio is selected on the gearset; as the vehicle and engine change speed, the difference between the pressures changes, causing different sets of valves to open and close. The hydraulic pressure controlled by these valves drives the various clutch and brake band actuators, thereby controlling the operation of the planetary gearset to select the optimum gear ratio for the current operating conditions. However, in many modern automatic transmissions, the valves are controlled by electro-mechanical servos which are controlled by the electronic [engine control unit] (ECU) or a separate transmission control unit (TCU, also known as transmission control module (TCM). Modern designs have replaced the mechanical governor with an electronic speed sensor and computer software. The engine load is monitored either by a throttle cable or a vacuum modulator. Modern designs have replaced these mechanical devices with an electronic signal transmitted via a CAN bus. The hydraulic and lubricating oil, called automatic transmission fluid (ATF), provides lubrication, corrosion prevention, and a hydraulic medium to convey mechanical power (for the operation of the transmission). Primarily made from refined petroleum, and processed to provide properties that promote smooth power transmission and increase service life, the ATF is one of the few parts of the automatic transmission that needs routine service as the vehicle ages. The multitude of parts, along with the complex design of the valve body, originally made hydraulic automatic transmissions much more complicated (and expensive) to build and repair than manual transmissions. In most cars (except US family, luxury, sport-utility vehicle, and minivan models) they have usually been extra-cost options for this reason. Mass manufacturing and decades of improvement have reduced this cost gap. In some modern cars, computers use sensors on the engine to detect throttle position, vehicle speed, engine speed, engine load, etc. to control the exact shift point. The computer transmits the information via solenoids that redirect the fluid the appropriate clutch or servo to control shifting. =Continuously variable transmissions= A fundamentally different type of automatic transmission is the continuously variable transmission, or CVT, which can smoothly and steplessly alter its gear ratio by varying the diameter of a pair of belt or chain-linked pulleys, wheels or cones. Some continuously variable transmissions use a hydrostatic drive ‚Äî consisting of a variable displacement pump and a hydraulic motor ‚Äî to transmit power without gears. Some early forms, such as the Hall system (which dates back to 1896Hydraulic Variable Transmission Mechanism, John Willam Hall, GB Patents, No 7479(1896), No 22406(1901), No 442(1903) and No 4148(1907)), used a fixed displacement pump and a variable displacement motor, and were designed to provide robust variable transmission for early commercial heavy motor vehicles.\\"The Hall Hydraulic Variable Speed-Gear - Part 1\\", Automotor Journal, June 25th, 1904, pp773-777 CVT designs are usually as fuel efficient as manual transmissions in city driving, but early designs lose efficiency as engine speed increases. A slightly different approach to CVT is the concept of toroidal CVT or infinitely variable transmission (IVT). These concepts provide zero and reverse gear ratios. E-CVT Some hybrid vehicles, notably those of Toyota, Lexus, and Ford Motor Company, have an electronically controlled CVT (E-CVT). In this system, the transmission has fixed gears, but the ratio of wheel-speed to engine-speed can be continuously varied by controlling the speed of the third input to a differential using motor-generators. =Dual- clutch transmissions= A dual-clutch transmission, or DCT (sometimes referred to as a twin-clutch transmission or double-clutch transmission), is a modern type of automated manual transmission. It uses two separate clutches for odd and even gear sets. It can fundamentally be described as two separate H-pattern manual transmissions (with their respective clutches) contained within one housing and working as one unit. They are usually operated in a fully automatic mode, and many also have the ability to allow the driver to manually shift gears in an automated manual mode, albeit still using the transmission's electro-hydraulics. =Automated Manual Transmission= The old design was commonly known as, and referred to a semi-automatic transmission because it was a conventional manual transmission with an automatic clutch, but it still required the driver to shift gears manually by hand, via the gearshift. On the most common design (e.g., VW Beetle) the driver pressed the gearshift, which disengaged the clutch electrically, shifted the transmission into a different gear, and then released the gear shift, which engaged the clutch. On another design (e.g. Citroen DS) the driver selected a gear via a column selector and lifted off the accelerator, which signaled the transmission to operate the clutch and change gears. Newer designs are a type of single-clutch automatic transmission that can be shifted using paddles or allowed to automatically select the gear. The new design that many people call an automatic with a single-clutch is the same as what many people call an automatic transmission on a motorcycle when really it's a semi-automatic transmission (also called an auto-clutch (manual) transmission). Sequential manual transmissions, on the other hand, have been used on fully-manual transmission motorcycles for decades. This automatic transmission type utilizes a regular clutch and gear setup (either the old design with a manual H-pattern gearbox or the new design with paddle-shifters) but automates the action by the use of sensors, actuators, processors, and pneumatics. The AMTs were born out of the need to make automatic cars affordable and fuel- efficient. These are very simple and affordable. They're also not very expensive to repair. Fuel efficiency is their top priority and it rivals that of manual transmissions. AMT is based on a TCU and an electro-hydraulic, electro-pneumatic, or electro-mechanical control system that supervises the use of the clutch and the gear shifting, allowing the driver to change gear without using a clutch, either manually (or sequentially), or fully automatically. Automatic transmission modes Conventionally, in order to select the transmission operating mode, the driver moves a selection lever located either on the steering column or on the floor (as with a manual on the floor, except that automatic selectors on the floor do not move in the same type of pattern as manual levers do). In order to select modes, or to manually select specific gear ratios, the driver must push a button in (called the shift-lock button) or pull the handle (only on column-mounted shifters) out. Some vehicles position selector buttons for each mode on the cockpit instead, freeing up space on the central console. It follows the classic PRND gate Vehicles conforming to US Government standardsfmcsa.dot.gov standards must have the modes ordered P-R-N-D-L (left to right, top to bottom, or clockwise). Previously, quadrant-selected automatic transmissions often used a P-N-D-L-R layout, or similar.\\"PRNDL ‚Äî why mess with it?\\". Toronto Star, Jim Kenzie Nov. 12, 2016 Such a pattern led to a number of deaths and injuries owing to driver error causing unintentional gear selection, as well as the danger of having a selector (when worn) jump into reverse from low gear during engine braking maneuvers. Ford Escort showing the P-R-N-[D]-D-L modes as well as the shift lock button on the top of the lever Depending on the model and make of the transmission, these controls can take several forms. However, most include the following: ; Park (P): This selection mechanically locks the output shaft of the transmission, restricting the vehicle from moving in any direction. A parking pawl prevents the transmission from rotating, and therefore the vehicle from moving. However, the vehicle's non-driven wheels are still free to rotate, and the driven wheels may still rotate individually (because of the differential). For this reason, it is recommended to use the hand brake (parking brake) because this actually locks (in most cases) the wheels and prevents them from moving. It is typical of front-wheel-drive vehicles for the parking brake to lock the rear (non-driving) wheels, so the use of both the parking brake and the transmission park lock provides the greatest security against unintended movement on slopes. This also increases the life of the transmission and the park pin mechanism, because parking on an incline with the transmission in park without the parking brake engaged will cause undue stress on the parking pin, and may even prevent the pin from releasing. A hand brake should also prevent the car from moving if a worn selector accidentally drops into reverse gear while idling. :A car should be allowed to come to a complete stop before setting the transmission into park to prevent damage. Usually, Park (P) is one of only two selections in which the car's engine can be started, the other being Neutral (N). This is typically achieved via a normally open inhibitor switch (sometimes called a \\"neutral safety switch\\") wired in series with the starter motor engagement circuit, which is closed when P or N is selected, completing the circuit (when the key is turned to the start position). In many modern cars and trucks, the driver must have the foot brake applied before the transmission can be taken out of park. The Park position is omitted on buses/coaches (and some road tractors) with automatic transmission (on which a parking pawl is not practical), which must instead be placed in neutral with the air-operated parking brakes set. ; Reverse (R): This engages reverse gear within the transmission, permitting the vehicle to be driven backward, and operates a switch to turn on the white backup lights for improved visibility (the switch may also activate a beeper on delivery trucks or other large vehicles to audibly warn other drivers and nearby pedestrians of the driver's reverse movement). To select reverse in most transmissions, the driver must come to a complete stop, depress the shift-lock button (or move the shift lever toward the driver in a column shifter, or move the shifter sideways along a notched channel in a console shifter) and select reverse. The driver should avoid engaging reverse while the vehicle is moving forwards, and likewise avoid engaging any forward gear while traveling backward. On transmissions with a torque converter, doing so at very low speed (walking pace) is not harmful, but causes unnecessary wear on clutches and bands, and a sudden deceleration that not only is uncomfortable but also uncontrollable since the brakes and the throttle contribute in the same direction. This sudden acceleration, or jerk, can still be felt when engaging the gear at standstill, but the driver normally suppresses this by holding the brakes. Traveling slowly in the right direction while engaging the gear minimizes the jerk further, which is actually beneficial to the wearing parts of the transmission. Electronically controlled transmissions may behave differently, as engaging a gear at speed is essentially undefined behavior. Some modern transmissions have a safety mechanism that will resist putting the car in reverse when the vehicle is moving forward; such a mechanism may consist of a solenoid-controlled physical barrier on either side of the reverse position, electronically engaged by a switch on the brake pedal, so that the brake pedal needs to be depressed in order to allow the selection of reverse. Some electronic transmissions prevent or delay the engagement of reverse gear altogether while the car is moving. : Some shifters with a shift button allow the driver to freely move the shifter from R to N or D without actually depressing the button. However, the driver cannot shift back to R without depressing the shift button, to prevent accidental shifting which could damage the transmission, especially at high speeds. ; Neutral / No gear (N): This disengages all gear trains within the transmission, effectively disconnecting the transmission from the driven wheels, allowing the vehicle to coast freely under its own weight and gain momentum without the motive force from the engine. Coasting in idle down long grades (where the law permits) should be avoided, though, with many transmission designs as the transmission's lubrication pump is commonly driven by the input (engine) side, which may not provide sufficient fluid flow at engine idle speed for high- speed travel. Similarly, emergency towing (with the driven wheels of the disabled and non-running vehicle on the ground) with an automatic transmission in neutral is not permitted by the manufacturer for many vehicles. Manufacturers understand emergency situations and list limitations of towing a vehicle in neutral (usually not to exceed 55 mph (88 km/h) and 50 miles (80 km). This is the only other selection in which the vehicle's engine may be started. ; Drive (D): This position allows the transmission to engage the full range of available forward gear ratios, allowing the vehicle to move forward and accelerate through its range of gears. The number of gear ratios within the transmission depends on the model, but three were initially predominant. In the 1990s four and five speeds became common. Six-speed automatic transmissions were probably the most common offering in cars and trucks from about 2010 and were still common (especially in older or less expensive models of vehicles) in 2017. However, seven-speed automatics had become available in some high-performance production luxury cars (found in Mercedes 7G gearbox, Infiniti), as are eight-speed autos in models from 2006 introduced by Aisin Seiki Co. in Lexus, ZF, Hyundai Motor Company and General Motors. From 2013 are available nine speeds transmissions produced by ZF and Mercedes 9G. In the 2017 model year Ford and General Motors introduced a 10-speed transmission. ; Overdrive ('D', 'OD', or a boxed [D] or the absence of an illuminated 'O/D OFF'): This mode is used in some transmissions to allow early computer- controlled transmissions to engage the automatic overdrive. In these transmissions, Drive (D) locks the automatic overdrive off but is identical otherwise. OD (Overdrive) in these cars is engaged under steady speeds or low acceleration at approximately . Under hard acceleration or below , the transmission will automatically downshift. Other vehicles with this selector (for example light trucks) will not only disable up-shift to the overdrive gear but keep the remaining gears available for use of engine braking. Drivers should verify the behavior of this switch and consider the benefits of reduced friction brake use when city driving where speeds typically do not necessitate the overdrive gear. Most automatic transmissions include some means of forcing a downshift (Throttle kick-down) into the lowest possible gear ratio if the throttle pedal is fully depressed. In many older designs, kick-down is accomplished by mechanically actuating a valve inside the transmission. Most modern designs use a solenoid-operated valve that is triggered by a switch on the throttle linkage or by the engine control unit (ECU) in response to an abrupt increase in engine power. Mode selection allows the driver to choose between preset shifting programs. For example, Economy mode saves fuel by upshifting at lower engine speeds, while Sport mode (aka \\"Power\\" or \\"Performance\\") delays upshifting for maximum acceleration. Some transmission units also have Winter mode, where higher gear ratios are chosen to keep revs as low as possible while on slippery surfaces. The modes also change how the computer responds to throttle input. Conventionally, automatic transmissions have selector positions that allow the driver to limit the maximum ratio that the transmission may engage. On older transmissions, this was accomplished by a mechanical lockout in the transmission valve body preventing an upshift until the lockout was disengaged; on computer-controlled transmissions, the same effect is accomplished by firmware. The transmission can still upshift and downshift automatically between the remaining ratios: for example, in the 3 range, a transmission could shift from first to second to third, but not into fourth or higher ratios. Some transmissions will still upshift automatically into the higher ratio if the engine reaches its maximum permissible speed in the selected range. ; Third (3): This mode limits the transmission to the first three gear ratios, or sometimes locks the transmission in third gear. This can be used to climb or going downhill. Some vehicles will automatically shift up out of third gear in this mode if a certain revolutions per minute (RPM) range is reached in order to prevent engine damage. This gear is also recommended while towing a trailer. ; Second (2 or S): This mode limits the transmission to the first two gear ratios, or locks the transmission in second gear on Ford, Kia, and Honda models. This can be used to drive in adverse conditions such as snow and ice, as well as climbing or going down hills in winter. It is usually recommended to use second gear for starting on snow and ice, and use of this position enables this with an automatic transmission. Some vehicles will automatically shift up out of second gear in this mode if a certain RPM range is reached in order to prevent engine damage. : Although traditionally considered second gear, there are other names used. Chrysler models with a three-speed automatic since the late 1980s have called this gear 3 while using the traditional names for Drive and Low. Oldsmobile has called second gear as the 'Super' range ‚Äî which was first used on their 4-speed Hydramatic transmissions, although the use of this term continued until the early 1980s when GM's Turbo Hydramatic automatic transmissions were standardized by all of their divisions years after the 4-speed Hydramatic was discontinued. Some automatics, particularly those fitted to a larger capacity or high torque engine, either when \\"2\\" is manually selected, or by engaging a winter mode, will start off in second gear instead of first, and then not shift into a higher gear until returned to \\"D.\\" Also note that as with most American automatic transmissions, selecting \\"2\\" using the selection lever will not tell the transmission to be in only 2nd gear; rather, it will simply limit the transmission to 2nd gear after prolonging the duration of 1st gear through higher speeds than normal operation. The 2000‚Äì2002 Lincoln LS V8 (the five-speed automatic without manumatic capabilities, as opposed to the optional sport package w/ manumatic 5-speed) started in 2nd gear during most starts both in winter and other seasons by selecting the \\"D5\\" transmission selection notch in the shift gate (for fuel savings), whereas \\"D4\\" would always start in 1st gear. This is done to reduce torque multiplication when proceeding forward from a standstill in conditions where traction was limited ‚Äî on snow- or ice-covered roads, for example. ; First (1 or L [Low]): This mode locks the transmission in first gear only. In older vehicles, it will not change to any other gear range. Some vehicles will automatically shift up out of first gear in this mode if a certain RPM range is reached in order to prevent engine damage. This, like second, can be used during the winter season, for towing, or for downhill driving to increase the engine braking effect. The \\"Austin Mini\\" automatic transmission is different in this respect - This mode locks the transmission in first gear, but the gearbox has a freewheel on the overrun. Closing the throttle after acceleration results in the vehicle continuing at the same speed and only slowing down due to friction and wind resistance. During this time, the engine RPM will drop back to idle until the throttle is pressed again. What this means is that in \\"First\\", engine braking is not available and \\"2\\" is the lowest gear that should be used whilst descending hills. The Mini's (and the 1100/1300's) 4-speed Automatic transmission was unusual in that it allowed manual selection of all forward gears, enabling the driver to \\"take off\\" from a standstill in any of the four ratios. It also provided no \\"Park\\" position. One type of manumatic shifting system available on automatic transmissions are paddle shifters. The paddle depicted here is the upshift paddle in a 2013 Honda Accord, with the driver's hand on it. Manumatic and paddle shifters may control any type of automatic transmission, including the continuously variable transmission in the Accord. =Manual controls= An electronic shift selector on a Mitsubishi Fuso Aero Star bus equipped with an Allison automatic transmission Some transmissions have a mode in which the driver has full control of ratios change (either by moving the selector or through the use of buttons or paddles), completely overriding the automated function of the hydraulic controller. Such control is particularly useful in cornering, to avoid unwanted upshifts or downshifts that could compromise the vehicle's balance or traction. \\"Manumatic\\" shifters, first popularized by Porsche in the 1990s under the trade name Tiptronic, have become a popular option on sports cars and other performance vehicles. With the near-universal prevalence of electronically controlled transmissions, they are comparatively simple and inexpensive, requiring only software changes, and the provision of the actual manual controls for the driver. The amount of true manual control provided is highly variable: some systems will override the driver's selections under certain conditions, generally in the interest of preventing engine damage. Since these gearboxes also have a throttle kick-down switch, it is impossible to fully exploit the engine power at low to medium engine speeds. =Manufacturer-specific modes= As well as the above modes there are other modes, dependent on the manufacturer and model. Some examples include: ; D5: In Hondas and Acuras equipped with five-speed automatic transmissions, this mode is used commonly for highway use (as stated in the manual), and uses all five forward gear ratios. ; D4: This mode is also found in Honda and Acura four or five-speed automatics, and only uses the first four gear ratios. According to the manual, it is used for stop-and-go traffic, such as city driving. ; D3 or 3: This mode is found in Honda, Acura, Volkswagen, and Pontiac four-speed automatics and only uses the first three gear ratios. According to the manual, it is used for stop-and-go traffic, such as city driving. ; D2 and D1: These modes are found on older Ford transmissions (C6, etc.). In D1, all three gears are used, whereas in D2 the car starts in second gear and upshifts to third. ; S or Sport: This is commonly described as Sport mode. It operates in an identical manner as \\"D\\" mode, except that the upshifts change much higher up the engine's rev range. This has an effect on maximizing all the available engine output, and therefore enhances the performance of the vehicle, particularly during acceleration. This mode will also down-change much higher up the rev range compared to \\"D\\" mode, maximizing the effects of engine braking. This mode will have a detrimental effect on fuel economy. Hyundai has a Norm/Power switch next to the gearshift for this purpose on the Tiburon. Some early GMs equipped with HYDRA-MATIC transmissions used (S) to indicate Second gear, being the same as the 2 positions on a Chrysler, shifting between only first and second gears. This would have been recommended for use on steep grades, or slippery roads like dirt, or ice, and limited to speeds under 40 mph. (L) was used in some early GMs to indicate (L)ow gear, being the same as the 1 position on a Chrysler, locking the transmission into first gear. This would have been recommended for use on steep grades, or slippery roads like dirt, or ice, and limited to speeds under 15 mph. ;+ ‚àí, and M: This is for the Manual mode selection of gears in certain automatics, such as Porsche and Honda's Tiptronic and BMW and Kia's Steptronic. The M feature can also be found in vehicles such as the Dodge Magnum and Journey; Pontiac G6; Mazda3, Mazda6, and CX-7; Toyota Camry, Corolla, Fortuner, Previa and Innova; Kia Forte (K3/Cerato), Optima (K5), Cadenza (K7) and K9 (Quoris). Mitsubishi montero sport / Pajero sport and some Audi models (Audi TT) do not have the M, and instead have the + and -, which is separated from the rest of the shift modes; the same is true for some Peugeot products like the Peugeot 206. Meanwhile, the driver can shift up and down at will by toggling the (console mounted) shift lever similar to an automated manual transmission. This mode may be engaged either through a selector/position or by actually changing the gears (e.g., tipping the gear-down paddles mounted near the driver's fingers on the steering wheel). ; Winter (W): In some Volvo, Mercedes-Benz, BMW, and General Motors models, a winter mode can be engaged so that second gear is selected instead of first when pulling away from stationary, to reduce the likelihood of loss of traction due to wheel spin on snow or ice. On GM cars, this was D2 in the 1950s, Second Gear Start after 1990, and Snow/Ice mode in the 2010s. On Ford, Kia, and Honda automatics, this feature can be accessed by moving the gear selector to 2 to start, then taking one's foot off the accelerator while selecting D once the vehicle is moving. ;Brake (B): A mode selectable on some Toyota models, as well as electric cars from several manufacturers. It can be used to decelerate, or maintain speed going downhill, without using the conventional brakes. In non-hybrid cars, B mode selects a lower gear to increase engine braking. GM called this \\"HR\\" (\\"hill retarder\\") and \\"GR\\" (\\"grade retarder\\") in the 1950s. In hybrids such as the Toyota Prius, which have a fixed gear ratio, B mode slows the car in part by increasing engine air intake, which enhances engine braking. In electric cars such as the Nissan Leaf and Mitsubishi i-MiEV, B mode increases the level of regenerative braking when the accelerator pedal is released. Some automatic transmissions modified or designed specifically for drag racing may also incorporate a transbrake as part of a manual valve body. Activated by electrical solenoid control, a trans brake simultaneously engages the first and reverse gears, locking the transmission and preventing the input shaft from turning. This allows the driver of the car to raise the engine RPM against the resistance of the torque converter, then launch the car by simply releasing the trans brake switch. Comparison with manual transmission Most cars sold in North America since the 1950s have been available with an automatic transmission, based on the fact that the three major American car manufacturers had started using automatics. Conversely, in Europe a manual gearbox is standard, with only 20% of drivers opting for an automatic gearbox compared to the United States. In some Asian markets and in Australia, automatic transmissions have become very popular since the 1980s. Vehicles equipped with automatic transmissions are not as complex to drive. Consequently, in some jurisdictions, drivers who have passed their driving test in a vehicle with an automatic transmission will not be licensed to drive a manual transmission vehicle. Conversely, a manual licence will allow the driver to drive both automatic or manual transmission vehicles. Countries in which such driving licence restrictions are applied include some states in Australia, Austria, Botswana, Belgium, Belize, China, Croatia, Czech Republic, Denmark, Dominican Republic, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, Hungary, India, Indonesia, Ireland, Israel, Italy, Japan, Latvia, Lebanon, Lithuania, Macau, Malaysia, Mauritius, the Netherlands, New Zealand (restricted licence only), Norway, Philippines, Poland, Portugal, Qatar, Romania, Russia (as of April 2014), Saudi Arabia (as of March 2012), Singapore, Slovenia, South Africa, South Korea, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, Trinidad and Tobago, Turkey, Vietnam, United Arab Emirates and the United Kingdom. A conventional manual transmission is frequently the base equipment in a car, with the option being an automated transmission such as a conventional automatic, automated manual, or CVT. =Effects on vehicle control= Cornering Unexpected gear changes can affect the attitude of a vehicle in marginal conditions. Maintaining constant speed Torque converters and CVT transmissions make changes in vehicle speed less apparent by the engine noise, as they decouple the engine speed from vehicle speed. Lockup torque converters that engage and disengage at certain speeds can make these speeds unstable ‚Äî the transmission wastes less power above the speed at which the torque converter locks up, usually causing more power to the wheels for the same throttle input. Controlling wheelspin Torque converters respond quickly to the loss of traction (torque) by increased speed of the driving wheels for the same engine speed. Thus, under most conditions, where the static friction is higher than the kinetic friction, the engine speed must be brought down to counteract wheelspin when it has occurred, requiring a stronger or quicker throttle reduction by the driver than with a manual transmission, making wheelspin harder to control. This is most apparent in driving conditions with much higher static friction than kinetic, such as packed hard snow (that turns to the ice by friction work), or snow on top of the ice. Climbing steep slippery slopes In situations where a driver with a manual transmission can't afford to change gear, in fear of losing too much speed to reach a hilltop, automatic transmissions are at a great advantage ‚Äî whereas driving a manual car depends on finding a gear that is not too low to enter the bottom of the hill at the necessary speed, but not too high to stall the engine at the top of the hill, sometimes an impossible task, this is not an issue with automatic transmissions, not just because gearshifts are quick, but they typically maintain some power on the driving wheels during the gear change. =Energy efficiency= Earlier hydraulic automatic transmissions were almost always less energy efficient than manual transmissions due mainly to viscous and pumping losses (parasitic losses), both in the torque converter and the hydraulic actuators. 21% is the loss on a 3-speed Chrysler Torqueflite compared to a modern GM 6L80 automatic. A relatively small amount of energy is required to pressurize the hydraulic control system, which uses fluid pressure to determine the correct shifting patterns and operate the various automatic clutch mechanisms. However, with technological developments some modern continuously variable transmissions are more fuel-efficient than their manual counterparts and modern 8-speed automatics are within 5% as efficient as a manual gearbox. Manual transmissions use a mechanical clutch to transmit torque, rather than a torque converter, thus avoiding the primary source of loss in an automatic transmission. Manual transmissions also avoid the power requirement of the hydraulic control system, by relying on the human muscle power of the vehicle operator to disengage the clutch and actuate the gear levers, and the mental power of the operator to make appropriate gear ratio selections. Thus the manual transmission requires very little engine power to function, with the main power consumption due to drag from the gear train being immersed in the lubricating oil of the gearbox. The on-road acceleration of an automatic transmission can occasionally exceed that of an otherwise identical vehicle equipped with a manual transmission in turbocharged diesel applications. Turbo-boost is normally lost between gear changes in a manual whereas in an automatic the accelerator pedal can remain fully depressed. This, however, is still largely dependent upon the number and optimal spacing of gear ratios for each unit, and whether or not the elimination of spool down/accelerator lift- off represent a significant enough gain to counter the slightly higher power consumption of the automatic transmission itself. Automatic transmission models Some of the best known automatic transmission families include: *General Motors: Dynaflow, Powerglide, Turboglide, Hydra-Matic, Dual Range Hydra-Matic, Jetaway Hydra-Matic, Whirlaway Hydra-Matic, Roto Hydra Matic, \\"Turbo-Hydramatic\\" TH350, TH400 and 700R4, 4L60-E, 4L80-E.

Each uses some arrangement of one or two central sun gears, and a ring gear, with differing arrangements of planet gears that surround the sun and mesh with the ring. An exception to this is the Hondamatic line from Honda, which uses sliding gears on parallel axes like a manual transmission without any planetary gearsets. Although Honda is quite different from all other automatics, it is also quite different from an automated manual transmission (AMT). Many of the above AMTs exist in modified states, which were created by racing enthusiasts and their mechanics by systematically re-engineering the transmission to achieve higher levels of performance. These are known as \\"performance transmissions\\". Examples of manufacturers of high-performance transmissions are General Motors and Ford.

Processes in BPEL export and import information by using web service interfaces exclusively. Overview One can describe Web-service interactions in two ways: as executable business processes and as abstract business processes. # An executable business process: models an actual behavior of a participant in a business interaction. # An abstract business process: is a partially specified process that is not intended to be executed. Contrary to Executable Processes, an Abstract Process may hide some of the required concrete operational details. Abstract Processes serve a descriptive role, with more than one possible use case, including observable behavior and/or process template. WS-BPEL aims to model the behavior of processes,Business Process Execution Language for Web Services, Version 1.1 (5 May 2003) via a language for the specification of both Executable and Abstract Business Processes. By doing so, it extends the Web Services interaction model and enables it to support business transactions. It also defines an interoperable integration model that should facilitate the expansion of automated process integration both within and between businesses. Its development came out of the notion that programming in the large and programming in the small required different types of languages. As such, it is serialized in XML and aims to enable programming in the large. Programming in the large/small The concepts of programming in the large and programming in the small distinguish between two aspects of writing the type of long- running asynchronous processes that one typically sees in business processes: # Programming in the large generally refers to the high-level state transition interactions of a process. BPEL refers to this concept as an Abstract Process. A BPEL Abstract Process represents a set of publicly observable behaviors in a standardized fashion. An Abstract Process includes information such as when to wait for messages, when to send messages, when to compensate for failed transactions, etc. # Programming in the small, in contrast, deals with short- lived programmatic behavior, often executed as a single transaction and involving access to local logic and resources such as files, databases, et cetera. History The origins of WS-BPEL go back to Web Services Flow Language (WSFL) and Xlang. In 2001, IBM and Microsoft had each defined their own fairly similar, \\"programming in the large\\" languages: WSFL (Web Services Flow Language) and Xlang, respectively. Microsoft even went ahead and created a scripting variant called XLANG/s which would later serve as the basis for their Orchestrations services inside their BizTalk Server. They specifically documented that this language \\"is proprietary and is not fully documented.\\" With the advent and popularity of BPML, and the growing success of BPMI.org and the open BPMS movement led by JBoss and Intalio Inc., IBM and Microsoft decided to combine these languages into a new language, BPEL4WS. In April 2003, BEA Systems, IBM, Microsoft, SAP, and Siebel Systems submitted BPEL4WS 1.1 to OASIS for standardization via the Web Services BPEL Technical Committee.Web Services BPEL Technical Committee. Although BPEL4WS appeared as both a 1.0 and 1.1 version, the OASIS WS-BPEL technical committee voted on 14 September 2004 to name their spec \\"WS-BPEL 2.0\\". (This change in name aligned BPEL with other Web Service standard naming conventions which start with \\"WS-\\" (similar to WS-Security) and took account of the significant enhancements made between BPEL4WS 1.1 and WS-BPEL 2.0.) If not discussing a specific version, the moniker BPEL is commonly used. In June 2007, Active Endpoints, Adobe Systems, BEA, IBM, Oracle, and SAP published the BPEL4People and WS-HumanTask specifications, which describe how human interaction in BPEL processes can be implemented. Topics =Design goals= There were ten original design goals associated with BPEL: # Define business processes that interact with external entities through web service operations defined using WSDL 1.1, and that manifest themselves as Web services defined using WSDL 1.1. The interactions are \\"abstract\\" in the sense that the dependence is on portType definitions, not on port definitions. # Define business processes using an XML-based language. Do not define a graphical representation of processes or provide any particular design methodology for processes. # Define a set of Web service orchestration concepts that are meant to be used by both the external (abstract) and internal (executable) views of a business process. Such a business process defines the behavior of a single autonomous entity, typically operating in interaction with other similar peer entities. It is recognized that each usage pattern (i.e., abstract view and executable view) will require a few specialized extensions, but these extensions are to be kept to a minimum and tested against requirements such as import/export and conformance checking that link the two usage patterns. # Provide both hierarchical and graph-like control regimes, and allow their use to be blended as seamlessly as possible. This should reduce the fragmentation of the process modeling space. # Provide data manipulation functions for the simple manipulation of data needed to define process data and control flow. # Support an identification mechanism for process instances that allows the definition of instance identifiers at the application message level. Instance identifiers should be defined by partners and may change. # Support the implicit creation and termination of process instances as the basic lifecycle mechanism. Advanced lifecycle operations such as \\"suspend\\" and \\"resume\\" may be added in future releases for enhanced lifecycle management. # Define a long-running transaction model that is based on proven techniques like compensation actions and scoping to support failure recovery for parts of long-running business processes. # Use Web Services as the model for process decomposition and assembly. # Build on Web services standards (approved and proposed) as much as possible in a composable and modular manner. =The BPEL language= BPEL is an orchestration language, and not a choreography language. The primary difference between orchestration and choreography is executability and control. An orchestration specifies an executable process that involves message exchanges with other systems, such that the message exchange sequences are controlled by the orchestration designer. A choreography specifies a protocol for peer-to-peer interactions, defining, e.g., the legal sequences of messages exchanged with the purpose of guaranteeing interoperability. Such a protocol is not directly executable, as it allows many different realizations (processes that comply with it). A choreography can be realized by writing an orchestration (e.g., in the form of a BPEL process) for each peer involved in it. The orchestration and the choreography distinctions are based on analogies: orchestration refers to the central control (by the conductor) of the behavior of a distributed system (the orchestra consisting of many players), while choreography refers to a distributed system (the dancing team) which operates according to rules (the choreography) but without centralized control. BPEL's focus on modern business processes, plus the histories of WSFL and XLANG, led BPEL to adopt web services as its external communication mechanism. Thus BPEL's messaging facilities depend on the use of the Web Services Description Language (WSDL) 1.1 to describe outgoing and incoming messages. In addition to providing facilities to enable sending and receiving messages, the BPEL programming language also supports: * A property-based message correlation mechanism * XML and WSDL typed variables * An extensible language plug-in model to allow writing expressions and queries in multiple languages: BPEL supports XPath 1.0 by default * Structured-programming constructs including if-then-elseif-else, while, sequence (to enable executing commands in order) and flow (to enable executing commands in parallel) * A scoping system to allow the encapsulation of logic with local variables, fault-handlers, compensation-handlers and event-handlers * Serialized scopes to control concurrent access to variables. =Relationship of BPEL to BPMN= There is no standard graphical notation for WS-BPEL, as the OASIS technical committee decided this was out of scope. Some vendors have invented their own notations. These notations take advantage of the fact that most constructs in BPEL are block-structured (e.g., sequence, while, pick, scope, etcetera.) This feature enables a direct visual representation of BPEL process descriptions in the form of structograms, in a style reminiscent of a Nassi‚ÄìShneiderman diagram. Others have proposed to use a substantially different business process modeling language, namely Business Process Model and Notation (BPMN), as a graphical front-end to capture BPEL process descriptions. As an illustration of the feasibility of this approach, the BPMN specification includes an informal and partial mapping from BPMN to BPEL 1.1. A more detailed mapping of BPMN to BPEL has been implemented in a number of tools, including an open-source tool known as BPMN2BPEL.BPMN2BPEL. However, the development of these tools has exposed fundamental differences between BPMN and BPEL, which make it very difficult, and in some cases impossible, to generate human-readable BPEL code from BPMN models. Even more difficult is the problem of BPMN-to-BPEL round-trip engineering: generating BPEL code from BPMN diagrams and maintaining the original BPMN model and the generated BPEL code synchronized, in the sense that any modification to one is propagated to the other. =Adding 'programming in the small' support to BPEL= BPEL's control structures such as 'if-then-elseif-else' and 'while' as well as its variable manipulation facilities depend on the use of 'programming in the small' languages to provide logic. All BPEL implementations must support XPath 1.0 as a default language. But the design of BPEL envisages extensibility so that systems builders can use other languages as well. BPELJBPELJ is an effort related to JSR 207JSR 207 that may enable Java to function as a 'programming in the small' language within BPEL. =BPEL4People= Despite wide acceptance of Web services in distributed business applications, the absence of human interactions was a significant gap for many real-world business processes. To fill this gap, BPEL4People extended BPEL from orchestration of Web services alone to orchestration of role-based human activities as well.  Objectives  Within the context of a business process BPEL4People * supports role-based interaction of people * provides means of assigning users to generic human roles * takes care to delegate ownership of a task to a person only * supports scenario as **four- eyes scenario **nomination **escalation **chained execution by extending BPEL with additional independent syntax and semantic. The WS-HumanTask specification introduces the definition of human tasks and notifications, including their properties, behavior and a set of operations used to manipulate human tasks. A coordination protocol is introduced in order to control autonomy and life cycle of service-enabled human tasks in an interoperable manner. The BPEL4People specification introduces a WS-BPEL extension to address human interactions in WS-BPEL as a first-class citizen. It defines a new type of basic activity which uses human tasks as an implementation, and allows specifying tasks local to a process or use tasks defined outside of the process definition. This extension is based on the WS- HumanTask specification. =WS-BPEL 2.0= Version 2.0 introduced some changes and new features: * New activity types: repeatUntil, validate, forEach (parallel and sequential), rethrow, extensionActivity, compensateScope * Renamed activities: switch/case renamed to if/else, terminate renamed to exit * Termination Handler added to scope activities to provide explicit behavior for termination * Variable initialization * XSLT for variable transformations (New XPath extension function bpws:doXslTransform) * XPath access to variable data (XPath variable syntax $variable[.part]/location) * XML schema variables in Web service activities (for WS-I doc/lit style service interactions) * Locally declared messageExchange (internal correlation of receive and reply activities) * Clarification of Abstract Processes (syntax and semantics) * Enable expression language overrides at each activity See also * BPEL4People * BPELscript * Business Process Model and Notation * Business Process Modeling * List of BPEL engines * Web Services Conversation Language * Workflow * WS-CDL * XML Process Definition Language * Yet Another Workflow Language References Further reading ;Books on BPEL 2.0 * SOA for the Business Developer: Concepts, BPEL, and SCA.

History The history of The General Association of The Baptists begins with the formation of the Duck River Association in 1826. The earliest church in the region was constituted circa 1790 by Kentucky ministers Ambrose Dudley and John Taylor. The Elk River Association was formed in south-central Tennessee in 1806, in the fertile valley region formed by the Elk and Duck Rivers. As most of the Baptists of middle Tennessee, the churches of the Elk River Association were strongly Calvinistic in theology. Early in the 19th century, Alexander Campbell became connected with the Baptists for a time, and began to preach Arminian doctrine among them. Some Baptists of the region found this modification of theology appealing, and began to preach against limited atonement and unconditional election, declaring that Christ died for all mankind. The new sentiment became so strong in the Elk River Association that it led to division, and the Duck River Association of Separate Baptists was formed. The original name appears to have been \\"Duck River Baptist Association of Christ.\\" An outspoken leader of the division was Elder William Keele. Others were soon embroiled in dispute over the new ideas, and other associations divided or had members withdraw from them. The majority of the Concord association held the more moderate Arminian position and the Calvinistic minority withdrew in 1827, creating two Concord associations. Some ministers and churches would move into the Campbell-Stone restoration movement. The Duck River Association would maintain a Baptist course. In the following years, several things developed among Tennessee Baptists, including the Baptist State Convention in 1833, the Union University of Murfreesboro, and the Baptist Publication and Sunday School Society. Discussion on whether to support these new endeavours caused friction that split the Duck River Association in 1843. Those who supported these new measures continue as the Duck River Association of Missionary Baptists and are affiliated with the Tennessee Baptist Convention and the Southern Baptist Convention. A mind of independence, coupled with opposition to the Calvinistic stance of the three organizations, would keep the Duck River Association of Separate Baptists from supporting them. According to the 1844 minutes of the missionary group, the dissenters could not \\"unite with you while you retain your Calvinistic doctrine.\\" The Duck River Baptists stayed their independent course and sought fellowship with like-minded Baptists. Through the years they developed correspondence with other Baptist associations - Mount Zion Association in 1835, Indian Creek in 1840, Union in 1848, Mount Moriah in 1851, Mount Pleasant circa 1860, East Union in 1890, Ebenezer and Mount Olive in 1891, Liberty in 1894, New Liberty in 1925, and Mount Pleasant No. 2 in 1965. Many of these fellowships are still maintained. In October 1939, delegates from Duck River, Mount Zion, Union, Mount Pleasant, Liberty, New Liberty and Ebenezer Associations, and the Pleasant Hill church of Kentucky, met at Garrison Fork Church, Bedford County, Tennessee, and organized The General Association of The Baptists. The stated purpose of this association is to \\"perpetuate a closer union and communion among us and to preserve and maintain a correspondence with each other.\\" In 1936 there were 52 churches with 4564 members [Religious Bodies, 1936, Vol. II, Part 1]. Faith and practice These \\"Duck River\\" churches are considered one of the \\"primitivistic\\" sects among Baptists. They are moderately Calvinistic, retaining the teachings of total depravity and eternal security, while asserting that Jesus Christ tasted death for every man. Most of the churches have Sunday Schools, but no organized support of missionary or benevolent institutions. In addition to baptism and the Lord's supper, they observe the rite of feet washing as an ordinance. Services are informal; preaching is extemporaneous. Most of the churches use musical instruments, though some do not, especially the northern Alabama churches which are heavily influenced by the Sacred Harp style of southern folk music.

(Acts 20:7; Colossians 2: 16-17) Status The General Association of The Baptists is currently made up of seven associations - Mt. Zion Association of Baptist (TN), Mt. Pleasant Association of Baptists [\\"No. 1\\"] (AL), Mt. Pleasant Association [No. 2] of The Baptists (AL), East Union Association of The Baptist (TN), Union Association of The Baptist (TN) - and one independent church - Pleasant Hill Regular Baptist Church of Marion, Kentucky. In 2002, these represented a total membership of 10,393 in 97 churches. Correspondence was dropped with the Duck River Association of Baptists (TN) in 2018. In addition to participation in the General Association, the local associations maintain correspondence with one another at their annual meetings. Each association is free to correspond with other like-minded associations that are not participating in the General Association, though there is no such correspondence at this time. In recent years there has been some interchange with the Town Creek Association of United Baptists (AL), and a failed attempt to achieve correspondence with the East Washington Association of Regular Baptists (AR).

In Israel, he was called Benjamin Ben- David. Biography =Early life= Benjamin Dunkelman was the son of Ashkenazim immigrants from the town of Makov (modern Mak√≥w Mazowiecki, Poland) in the Russian Empire. His father was David Dunkelman, the founder of the Canadian men's retailers, Tip Top TailorsHammond, Karen; Old Times: Leaders and Legends; Winter/Spring 2007; p. 32 and his mother Rose was a committed Zionist.biographical entry in Dunkelman and his siblings grew up on an estate, Sunnybrook Farm (now the site of Sunnybrook Medical Centre), northeast of Toronto built by his wealthy father. Dunkelman later recalled about growing on Sunnybrooke Farm that \\"it was a dreamland, a children‚Äôs paradise\\". He attended Upper Canada College in Toronto, where he was noted for his active social life and for excelling at football. Besides for his love of sports, Dunkelman enjoyed sailing Lake Ontario in his yacht. In 1931, financial losses caused by the Great Depression forced David Dunkelman to sell off Sunnybrook Farm. At the age of 18, Dunkelman went off to work on a kibbutz in Palestine, at that time a League of Nations Mandate administered by Great Britain. Dunkelman was inspired by his Zionist mother to go to the Palestine Mandate. At the kibbutz, he worked as a shomer, an armed watchman, whose duty it was to protect the kibbutz from being attacked by Palestinian raiders. Dunkelman recalled: \\"I went off a flabby, pampered boy; I returned as a tough young man who had seen the world.\\" He loved the Holy Land, and only reluctantly returned to Toronto. He returned to Toronto in 1932 to assist his father, but went again to Palestine in the late 1935 to develop new settlements. =Military career= He was back in Toronto in 1939 when the Second World War broke out. He attempted to join the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN), but anti-semitism in the RCN at the time precluded a naval career.Dunkelman, Ben (1984). Dual Allegiance: An autobiography, Goodread Biography. Instead Dunkelman enlisted as a private with The Queen's Own Rifles of Canada; as the war progressed he rose from Private to Major. Dunkelman enlisted with the Second Battalion of the Queen's Own Rifles in 1940. Dunkelman later gave his reasons for enlisting as an \\"active\\" (willing to fight overseas) member as: \\"I am a Canadian, proud of Canada‚Äôs heritage and proud-if need be-to fight for it.\\" He was in the second wave to land on Juno beach, the Canadian beach in the Normandy landings on D-Day 6 June 1944. During his career with the regiment he earned numerous commendations. He also fought in the difficult campaigns in northern France, Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany, including bloody battles at Caen, Falaise, and the Battle of the Scheldt to open up the critical port of Antwerp. During the Normandy campaign in June-August 1944 and then during the Battle of the Scheldt, the Canadian Army took heavy losses. At the same time, the policy of Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King of only sending \\"active\\" members who volunteered to fight overseas ensured there was a shortage of replacements for the losses as there were only a limited number of men who had enlisted voluntarily. Under Mackenzie King's policy, men were conscripted for the military, but only for the defense of Canada, leading to a situation where two divisions stood waiting on the coast of British Columbia and another division on the coast of Nova Scotia. At the time of the Battle of the Scheldt, Dunkelman wrote in disgust: \\"We knew why leaves were so scarce. Thanks to Prime Minister Mackenzie King's handling of the Conscription issue at home\\".Granatstein, Jack & Morton, Desmond Canada and the Two World Wars, Toronto: KeyPorter, 2003 page 308 In 1945, he was awarded a Distinguished Service Order (DSO) for his service in the Hochwald campaign in northwest Germany during the drive to the river Rhine. In March 1945, Dunkelman played a key role in taking the steep Balberger Wald ridge in the dark forests of the Hochwald. After the war, he was offered command of the Queen's Own Rifles but declined owing to business interests at home. Dunkelman returned to Canada, but again decided to travel to war, this time to fight for Israel in the spring of 1948. On 14 May 1948, the Palestine Mandate came to an end and the State of Israel was proclaimed. Israel was immediately invaded by the armies of Egypt, Saudi Arabia, Jordan, Iraq, Syria and Lebanon who joined the two Palestinian armies who had been fighting the Jewish population since December 1947. He arrived there at a time when the Israeli army was short of officers with combat experience. Initially, he took command of a mortar unit in the Mahal, the legion of Jewish and Christian foreign volunteers fighting for Israel. Dunkelman's skill with mortars brought him to the attention of the Israeli High Command, and he was instrumental in the breaking of the siege of Jerusalem, which had been besieged by the Jordanians almost since the beginning of the war. Shortly afterwards, he became the commander of the 7th Brigade, the country's best-known armored brigade. Dunkelman and the 7th Brigade were initially sent to Galilee to halt the advance of the Syrians. Under his command, the 7th Brigade stopped the Syrian advance and recaptured much of upper western Galilee. In his autobiography, called Dual Allegiance, Dunkelman tells the story of how, between July 8 and 18, 1948 during Operation Dekel, he led the 7th Brigade and its supporting units as it moved to capture the town of Nazareth. Nazareth surrendered after little more than token resistance. The Palestinians of Nazareth were overwhelmingly Christian. The Palestinian Christians of Nazareth had little interest in being incorporated into a Muslim state, whatever under the leadership of King Abdullah I of Jordan who wanted Palestine for himself or Muhammad Amin al-Husayni, the Grand Mufti of Jerusalem, the would-be future Palestinian leader who was being supported by King Farouk of Egypt and King Ibn Saud of Saudi Arabia. The surrender was formalized in a written agreement, where the town leaders accepted to cease hostilities in return for solemn promises from the Israeli officers, including Dunkelman, that no harm would come to the Palestinian civilians of the town. Shortly after the capture, Dunkelman received ordersAccording to Ben-Gurion's War Diary, Vol. II, these orders came from Moshe Zalitzky (Carmel), quoted in Gelber, Yoav (2006), Palestine 1948, Sussex Academic, Brighton, , p. 166. from General Chaim Laskov to expel the Palestinian civilian population from the town, which he refused to carry out. Israeli journalist and translator Peretz Kidron, with whom Dunkelman collaborated in writing Dual Allegiance, reproduced his record of Dunkelman's account of the capture of Nazareth in a book chapter entitled \\"Truth Whereby Nations Live\\": :\\"[less than a day later] Haim Laskov [came] to me with astounding orders: Nazareth's civilian population was to be evacuated! I was shocked and horrified. I told him I would do nothing of the sort‚Äîin view of our promises to safeguard the city's people, such a move would be both superfluous and harmful. I reminded him that scarcely a day earlier, he and I, as representatives of the Israeli army, had signed the surrender document in which we solemnly pledged to do nothing to harm the city or its population. When Haim saw that I refused to obey the order, he left.\\"Kidron, Peretz (1988). Truth Whereby Nations Live. In Edward Said and Christopher Hitchens (Eds.). Blaming the Victims: Spurious Scholarship and the Palestinian Question Verso. , p. 87. 12 hours after Dunkelman had refused to expel the inhabitants of Nazareth, Laskov had appointed another officer as military governor.Morris, Benny (2004). The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press. , pp. 419‚Äì20. :\\"Two days after the second truce came into effect, the Seventh Brigade was ordered to withdraw from Nazareth. Avraham Yaffe, who had commanded the 13th battalion in the assault on the city, now reported to me with orders from Moshe Carmel to take over from me as its military governor. I complied with the order, but only after Avraham had given me his word of honour that he would do nothing to harm or displace the Arab population. [....] I felt sure that [the order to withdraw from Nazareth] had been given because of my defiance of the evacuation order.\\"Kidron, Peretz (1988). Truth Whereby Nations Live. In Edward Said and Christopher Hitchens (Eds.). Blaming the Victims: Spurious Scholarship and the Palestinian Question Verso. , pp. 86, 87. Dunkelman's defiance of the evacuation order forced Laskov to attempt to obtain sanction from a higher level. However, David Ben-Gurion finally vetoed the order; the Arab inhabitants in Nazareth were never forced to evacuate. Dunkelman's argument that expelling the mostly Christian Palestinians of Nazareth would damage relations with the overwhelming Christian nations of the West seemed to have changed Ben-Gurion's mind.Haiduc-Dale, Noah Arab Christians in British Mandate Palestine: Communalism and Nationalism, 1917-1948, Edinburgh: Edinburg University Press, 2013 p.186 During the war, Dunkelman met and married Yael Lifshitz. Lifshitz was a corporal in the Israeli Army who served under Dunkelman. Civilian career After the war Dunkelman was offered, but refused, a commission in the peacetime Israeli Army; the Dunkelmans returned instead to Toronto where he went into the family business, which he expanded then sold to Dylex Limited in 1967. In recognition of Dunkelman's World War Two service, the Parliament of Canada voted to give Yael Dunkelman Canadian citizenship, instead of forcing her to apply for Canadian citizenship, which her husband called a \\"splendid gesture\\". The Dunkelmans were to have six children. He later became a developer. Among his developments were the Cloverdale Mall and the Constellation Hotel, later renamed the Regal Constellation Hotel. Dunkelman was one of the founders of the Island Yacht Club , which he founded in 1951 after the Royal Canadian Yacht Club refused to accept him on the account of his being Jewish. Dunkelman lived in retirement in Toronto until his death. In 1967, he almost died of a heart attack, which led him to retire from the family's business of running the Tip Top tailor company. After his heart attack, he decided to focus on his real passion, collecting art. He and his wife also ran the Dunkelman Gallery in Toronto as well as several restaurants. The Dunkelman Gallery, which he founded in 1967 became a \\"well-known as a showcase for Canadian and international artists\\". In September 1969, the Dunkelman Gallery hosted the personal archaeological collection of the Israeli Defense Minister, General Moshe Dayan, which mostly consisted of art from ancient Canaan and Phoenicia. There is a bridge on the Lebanese border called Gesher Ben in Dunkelman's honor. His story is told in the film Ben Dunkelman: The Reluctant Warrior.

Most frequently it is used for atrial fibrillation, atrial flutter, and heart failure. Digoxin is taken by mouth or by injection into a vein. Common side effects include breast enlargement with other side effects generally due to an excessive dose. These side effects may include loss of appetite, nausea, trouble seeing, confusion, and an irregular heartbeat. Greater care is required in older people and those with poor kidney function. It is unclear whether use during pregnancy is safe. Digoxin is in the cardiac glycoside family of medications. Digoxin was first isolated in 1930 from the foxglove plant, Digitalis lanata. It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines. In 2017, it was the 168th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than three million prescriptions.  Medical use  = Irregular heartbeat = The most common indications for digoxin are atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter with rapid ventricular response, though beta blockers and/or calcium channel blockers may be preferred in some patients, such as those without heart failure or hemodynamic instability. One 2015 review found that digoxin increases the risk of death, while another reported no change in mortality. It has been suggested that the effect on mortality seen in some studies was due to inappropriately high doses of digoxin and that the low doses often used in practice (levels <0.9 ng/ml) may not increase mortality. = Heart failure = Digoxin is no longer the first choice for heart failure; it has fallen out of favor in people with heart failure because it may increase the risk of death. Currently, the recommendation for heart failure is a triple therapy of ACE inhibitor, beta blocker and mineralocorticoid antagonists. Digoxin is a third- line therapy. = Abortion = Digoxin is also used intrafetally or amniotically during abortions in the late second trimester and third trimester of pregnancy. It typically causes fetal demise (measured by cessation of cardiac activity) within hours of administration.  Side effects  The occurrence of adverse drug reactions is common, owing to its narrow therapeutic index (the margin between effectiveness and toxicity). Gynaecomastia (enlargement of breast tissue) is mentioned in many textbooks as a side effect, thought to be due to the estrogen-like steroid moiety of the digoxin molecule, but when systematically sought, the evidence for this is equivocal . The combination of increased (atrial) arrhythmogenesis and inhibited atrioventricular (AV) conduction (for example paroxysmal atrial tachycardia with AV block ‚Äì so-called \\"PAT with block\\") is said to be pathognomonic (that is, diagnostic) of digoxin toxicity. Overdose In overdose, the usual supportive measures are needed. If arrhythmias prove troublesome, or malignant hyperkalemia occurs (inexorably rising potassium level due to paralysis of the cell membrane-bound, ATPase-dependent Na/K pumps), the specific antidote is antidigoxin (antibody fragments against digoxin, trade names Digibind and Digifab). Pharmacology = Pharmacodynamics = ECG from a person taking digoxin, explaining ST depressions in mainly precordial leads V4 and V5. Digoxin's primary mechanism of action involves inhibition of the sodium potassium adenosine triphosphatase (Na+/K+ ATPase), mainly in the myocardium. This inhibition causes an increase in intracellular sodium levels, resulting in decreased activity of the sodium-calcium exchanger, which normally imports three extracellular sodium ions into the cell and transports one intracellular calcium ion out of the cell. The reversal of this exchanger causes an increase in the intracellular calcium concentration that is available to the contractile proteins. Increased intracellular calcium lengthens phase 4 and phase 0 of the cardiac action potential, which leads to a decrease in heart rate. Increased amounts of Ca2+ also leads to increased storage of calcium in the sarcoplasmic reticulum, causing a corresponding increase in the release of calcium during each action potential. This leads to increased contractility (the force of contraction) of the heart without increasing heart energy expenditure. The inhibition of the sodium pump may also improve baroreceptor sensitivity in heart failure and may explain some of the neurohormonal effects of digoxin. Digoxin also has important parasympathetic effects, particularly on the atrioventricular node. While it does increase the magnitude of myocardial contractility, the duration of the contraction is only slightly increased. Its use as an antiarrhythmic drug, then, comes from its direct and indirect parasympathetic stimulating properties. Vagus nerve stimulation slows down conduction at the AV node by increasing the refractory period of cardiac myocytes. The slowed AV node gives the ventricles more time to fill before contracting. This negative chronotropic effect is synergistic with the direct effect on cardiac pacemaker cells. The arrhythmia itself is not affected, but the pumping function of the heart improves, owing to improved filling. Overall, the heart rate is decreased while stroke volume is increased, resulting in a net increase in blood pressure, leading to increased tissue perfusion. This causes the myocardium to work more efficiently, with optimized hemodynamics and an improved ventricular function curve. Other electrical effects include a brief initial increase in action potential, followed by a decrease as the K+ conductance increases due to increased intracellular amounts of Ca2+ ions. The refractory period of the atria and ventricles is decreased, while it increases in the sinoatrial and AV nodes. A less negative resting membrane potential is made, leading to increased irritability. The conduction velocity increases in the atria, but decreases in the AV node. The effect upon Purkinje fibers and ventricles is negligible. Automaticity is also increased in the atria, AV node, Purkinje fibers, and ventricles. ECG changes seen in people taking digoxin include increased PR interval (due to decreased AV conduction) and a shortened QT interval. Also, the T wave may be inverted and accompanied by ST depression. It may cause AV junctional rhythm and ectopic beats (bigeminy) resulting in ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation. = Pharmacokinetics = Digoxin is usually given orally, but can also be given by IV injection in urgent situations (the IV injection should be slow, and heart rhythm should be monitored). While IV therapy may be better tolerated (less nausea), digoxin has a very long distribution half-life into the cardiac tissue, which will delay its onset of action by a number of hours. The half-life is about 36 hours for patients with normal renal function, digoxin is given once daily, usually in 125 Œºg or 250 Œºg doses. Digoxin elimination is mainly by renal excretion and involves P-glycoprotein, which leads to significant clinical interactions with P-glycoprotein inhibitor drugs. Examples commonly used in patients with heart problems include spironolactone, verapamil and amiodarone. In patients with decreased kidney function the half-life is considerably longer, along with decrease in Vd (volume of distribution), calling for a reduction in dose or a switch to a different glycoside, such as digitoxin (not available in the United States), which has a much longer elimination half-life of around seven days and is eliminated by the liver. Effective plasma levels vary depending on the medical indication. For congestive heart failure, levels between 0.5 and 1.0 ng/ml are recommended. This recommendation is based on post hoc analysis of prospective trials, suggesting higher levels may be associated with increased mortality rates. For heart rate control (atrial fibrillation), plasma levels are less defined and are generally titrated to a goal heart rate. Typically, digoxin levels are considered therapeutic for heart rate control between 0.5 and 2.0 ng/ml (or 0.6 and 2.6 nmol/l).() In suspected toxicity or ineffectiveness, digoxin levels should be monitored. Plasma potassium levels also need to be closely controlled (see side effects, below). Quinidine, verapamil, and amiodarone increase plasma levels of digoxin (by displacing tissue binding sites and depressing renal digoxin clearance), so plasma digoxin must be monitored carefully when coadministered. A study which looked to see if digoxin affected men and women differently found that digoxin did not reduce deaths overall, but did result in less hospitalization. Women who took digoxin died \\"more frequently\\" (33%) than women who took placebo (29%). Digoxin increased the risk of death in women by 23%. There was no difference in the death rate for men in the study. Digoxin is also used as a standard control substance to test for P-glycoprotein inhibition. =Pharmacomicrobiomics= The bacteria Eggerthella lenta has been linked to a decrease in the toxicity of Digoxin. These effects have been studied through comparisons of North Americans and Southern Indians, in which a reduced digoxin metabolite profile correlates with E. lentum abundance. Further studies have also revealed an increase in digoxin toxcicity when used alongside erythromycin or tetracycline, the researches attributed this to the decrease in the E. lentum population.  History  Derivatives of plants of genus Digitalis have a long history of medical use. The English physician William Withering is credited with the first published description of the use of Digitalis derivatives in his 1785 book An Account of the Foxglove and some of its Medical Uses With Practical Remarks on Dropsy and Other Diseases. It effects were first explained by Arthur Robertson Cushny. The name is derived from that of digitoxin, which explains its pronunciation.  Society and culture  Charles Cullen admitted in 2003 to killing as many as 40 hospital patients with overdoses of heart medication‚Äîusually digoxin‚Äîat hospitals in New Jersey and Pennsylvania over his 19-year career as a nurse. On March 10, 2006, he was sentenced to 18 consecutive life sentences and is not eligible for parole. On April 25, 2008, the U.S. Federal Drug Administration (FDA) issued a press release alerting the public to a Class I recall of Digitek, a brand of digoxin produced by Mylan. Some tablets had been released at double thickness and therefore double strength, causing some patients to experience digoxin toxicity. A class-action lawsuit against the Icelandic generic drug maker Actavis was announced two weeks later. On March 31, 2009, the FDA announced another generic digoxin pill recall by posting this company press release on the agency's web site: \\"Caraco Pharmaceutical Laboratories, Ltd. Announces a Nationwide Voluntary Recall of All Lots of Digoxin Tablets Due to Size Variability\\". A March 31 press release from Caraco, a generic pharmaceutical company, stated: A 2008 study suggested digoxin has beneficial effects not only for the heart, but also in reducing the risk of certain kinds of cancer. However, comments on this study suggested that digoxin is not effective at reducing cancer risk at therapeutic concentrations of the drug, so the results need further investigation. In the Turkish film Once Upon a Time in Anatolia the prosecutor tells the doctor a story of a woman who died on the date she predicted she would die, well after delivering the baby. The doctor speculates that she may have taken high doses of digoxin to die of heart attack. There are hints that she may have been the prosecutor's wife who committed suicide because she could not take his one-time affair. = Trade names = Digoxin preparations are marketed under the trade names Cardigox; Cardiogoxin; Cardioxin; Cardoxin; Coragoxine; Digacin; Digicor; Digomal; Digon; Digosin; Digoxine Navtivelle; Digoxina-Sandoz; Digoxin-Sandoz; Digoxin-Zori; Dilanacin; Eudigox; Fargoxin; Grexin; Lanacordin; Lanacrist; Lanicor; Lanikor; Lanorale; Lanoxicaps; Lanoxin; Lanoxin PG; Lenoxicaps; Lenoxin; Lifusin; Mapluxin; Natigoxin; Novodigal; Purgoxin; Sigmaxin; Sigmaxin-PG; Toloxin.

Courier companies use bike messengers because bicycle travel is less subject to unexpected holdups in city traffic jams, and is not deterred by parking limitations, fees or fines in high-density development that can hinder or prevent delivery by motor vehicle, thereby offering a predictable delivery time. History Bicycle messenger boys, Salt Lake City, 1912 Almost immediately after the development of the pedal-driven velocipede in the 1860s, people began to use the bicycle for delivery purposes. David V. Herlihy's 2004 book on the early history of the bicycle contains several references to bicycle messengers working during the late 19th century, including a description of couriers employed by the Paris stock exchange in the 1870s. During the bicycle boom of the 1890s in the United States, Western Union employed a number of bicycle telegraph boys in New York City, San Francisco, and other large population centers. One of the earliest recorded post-war American bicycle courier companies was founded by Carl Sparks, in San Francisco, in 1945. According to the San Francisco Bicycle Messenger Association, \\"Sparkie's went on to become Aero, which was bought out in 1998 [and] later absorbed into CitySprint.\\" By the late 1970s, there were well- established companies offering bicycle messenger services in many major cities in the U.S. In Europe, the bicycle had fallen out of favour as a means of delivery in the third quarter of the 20th century. It was not until 1983 that bicycle messengers made their reappearance in Europe. London's \\"On Yer Bike\\" and \\"Pedal-Pushers\\" were pioneers of pedal over petrol, and the rest of the city's courier companies followed suit. By the late 1980s, cycle couriers were a common sight in central London and a British manufacturer named a range of mountain-bikes for them, the Muddy Fox 'Courier'. Entrepreneurs in continental Europe, some inspired by seeing couriers in the U.S. or in London, began to offer bicycle courier services in the late 1980s, and by 1993 there were sufficiently large numbers of bicycle couriers in Northern Europe and North America that over 400 attended the inaugural Cycle Messenger Championships in Berlin, Germany. Bicycle messengers have not become common in southern Europe, the heartland of world competitive cycling. There are very few bicycle couriers in Portugal, France, Spain, or Italy. Outside Europe and North America, there are now large bicycle messenger services in Japan, and also in New Zealand and Australia. More recently, several companies started offering bike messenger services in Central and South America, specifically in M√©xico City, M√©xico; San Jos√©, Costa Rica; Bogot√°, Colombia; Buenos Aires, Argentina; Santiago, Chile; Rio de Janeiro and S√£o Paulo, Brazil. Demand for courier services Messengers carry a huge variety of items, from things that could not be sent by digital means (corporate gifts, original artwork, clothes for photoshoots, original signed documents) to mundane items that could easily be emailed, albeit without the air of importance attached to an express courier delivery. Messengers deliver digital content on optical media or hard disks because, despite high speed broadband connections, companies find it easier to send a disc than to work out how to transmit larger amounts of data than an email account can handle. Legal documents, various financial instruments and sensitive information are routinely sent by courier, reflecting a distrust of digital cryptography. Commentators have claimed that technological innovation will significantly reduce the demand for same-day parcel delivery, predicting that the fax machine, and then the internet, would render the messenger business obsolete. There is still a demand for fast courier services, but there is certainly some truth in the predictions. Reliable data specifically relating to bicycle messenger occupational statistics is hard to find: the U.S. Department of Labor statistics does not track bicycle messengers specifically, and does not include \\"independent contractors\\" in statistics referenced for this industry occupation, but reports indicate the business is shrinking. Be that as may, in the current stae of pandemic the demand for food deliveries has surged to record levels. Bike Messengers report earning 100's of dollars in tips in a single evening. The gradual acceptance of electronic filing by U.S. courts has had a negative effect on the market. In San Francisco, bike messengers report a smaller work force coupled with decreased earnings. In New York City alone, the number of messengers dropped by approximately 1,000 between 1998 and 2008. Working conditions Bicycle messenger at the headquarters of the National Woman's Party, 1922 The conditions of employment of bicycle messengers vary from country to country, city to city, and even company to company. Contracts governing the relationship between individual courier and company are subject as much to customary practice, as a local ordinance. In some places messengers are independent contractors paid on commission and do not receive benefits such as health insurance. In other places, they will be regular employees of the courier company enjoying all the benefits thereof. The employment status of the bicycle messengers of one of the UK's biggest same-day courier services, CitySprint, was challenged by the GMB trade union in December 2007. The challenge arose after the firm terminated the contract of one of its riders. The GMB sought to establish that more than 1,500 CitySprint operatives currently classified as self-employed sub-contractors should be re-classified as employees. The job is poorly paid relative to the risk and effort required. In 2002, a Harvard Medical School study of injury rates among Boston bicycle messengers determined that the rate of injury requiring time off work among the sample group was more than thirteen times the U.S. average, and more than three times higher than the next highest group, workers in the meat-packing industry. Bike messengers have been killed while working in the United States. Eight bicycle messengers are known to have been killed while working in London between 1989 and 2003. Because payment is made at piece rates, it is hard to get reliable figures for messenger income. A study published in 2006 stated that the average daily wage of London bicycle messengers was ¬£65 a day, and that of bicycle messenger in Cardiff was ¬£45. The UK legal minimum wage at that time was ¬£5.52 an hour. Licensing In most cities, there are no legal requirements beyond those applying to all cyclists. Some jurisdictions, though, require the licensing of courier bicycles. In Calgary, Alberta for example, metal license plates must be fixed to bicycles used for courier work. Vancouver, British Columbia additionally requires bicycle messengers to complete a test in order to obtain a license, and to carry an identification card. Equipment The most essential piece of equipment for a bicycle messenger is a bicycle. Some large cities that employ significant numbers of bike messengers (e.g., New York City) have relatively flat terrain, and are especially conducive to the performance properties of fixed-gear bicycles. Because bicycle thefts are prevalent in many cities, a lock to secure the bike during deliveries is essential. U-locks are also popular. Messengers typically carry basic tools, weather-proof clothing and a street map. The majority of messengers use a bag to carry deliveries and personal effects. Bags with a single strap that wraps diagonally across the chest (popularly known as messenger bag) are popular because they can be swung around the messenger's body to allow access without removing the bag. Clasps which can be adjusted with one hand (ideal for riding), clips, pockets, and webbing loops on the strap for holding a cell phone or two-way radio and other equipment also feature on purpose-built messenger bags. Bags generally have large capacities (up to 50 liters or 3,000 cubic inches). Baskets and racks mounted on the bike are also used, and at least one messenger service (in New York City) equips its riders with specialized three-wheel cycles (sometimes known as cargo- trikes), with a large trunk in the rear. Many bicycle messengers also wear helmets and mount lights and fenders (mudguards) to their bicycles. Communications Messengers communicate and are dispatched to assignments via hand-held communication devices including two-way radios, cell phones, and personal digital assistants. Many of the larger messenger services equip their riders with GPS tracking devices, for ease of location. Messenger culture and influence =Media= 1902 US postal stamp depicting a bicycle messenger Messengers have been used in fiction media as symbols of urban living, and have been the subject of novels, memoirs, feature films,Quicksilver, 1986 film about a stock broker who becomes a NYC messenger television series, comic- books, and sociological studies. Mexican artist Jos√© Guadalupe Posada created a popular icon of a marijuana-smoking bicycle courier everyman in his 19th- century engravings. The 1986 film Quicksilver featuring a bicycle messenger, is an early expression of the mythology of the messenger as a daredevil stunt rider. Star Kevin Bacon rides a racing bike, a fixed gear bike and a trick bike with 1:1 gear ratio and zero-rake forks, to perform the stunts in the film. The 2000‚Äì2002 television series Dark Angel had the main character Max Guevara, played by Jessica Alba, as a bicycle messenger at a courier service named Jam Pony. The show took place in a post-apocalyptic Seattle where motorized transportation was costly and therefore couriers were more prevalent and bicycle messengers were seen as a prominent position. The 2012 film Premium Rush, starring Joseph Gordon-Levitt, is also set in the world of bike messengers. In the TV show Suits, Patrick J. Adams often has flashback scenes to the previous job as a bike messenger. The main character of the game inFAMOUS is also a bike messenger who possesses amazing skills in parkour and urban exploration. News media have made portrayals of messengers ranging from innocuous urban libertines to reckless, cliquish nihilists. The latter portrayal is often sparked by local incidents involving bike messengers in collisions with other road-users or run-ins with authority figures. These incidents also occasionally lead to proposals for, and dispute over, new ordinances and regulations on messengers and messengering. =Fashion= The influence of bicycle messengers can be seen in urban fashion, most notably the popularity of single-strap messenger bags, which are a common accessory among people who do not ride a bicycle regularly. The rise in popularity of fixed- gear bicycles in the mid-2000s, complete with affectations such as spoke cards (gathered from \\"alleycats\\" typically), is attributed to bicycle messengers. =Events= Since 1993, Cycle Messenger World Championships, CMWCs, have taken place at national, continental and world levels. These events are held as much for fun and messenger networking as for competition. Bicycle messengers also take part in formal cycle competitions at all levels, and in all disciplines. Nelson Vails, silver medalist on the velodrome in the 1984 Olympics, worked as a bicycle messenger in New York City in the early 1980s. Ivonne Kraft, who competed in the 2004 Olympic cross country mountain bike race, is a multiple former Cycle Messenger World Champion, and worked as a bicycle messenger in Germany for a number of years.

She served as a member of the Nova Scotia Legislature from 1981 to 1994, representing the Halifax Chebucto and Halifax Fairview electoral districts. She stepped down as the NSNDP's leader and as a member of the legislature in 1994. She subsequently ran for, and was elected, leader of the federal New Democratic Party (NDP) in 1995. McDonough was elected the Member of Parliament (MP) for the federal electoral district of Halifax in 1997. She stepped down as party leader in 2003, but continued to serve as an MP for two more terms, until 2008, when she retired from politics altogether. In 2009, she became the interim president of Mount Saint Vincent University and was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada in December of that year. Early life and education McDonough was born Alexa Ann Shaw in Ottawa, Ontario, on August 11, 1944. Her parents were Jean MacKinnon and Lloyd Robert Shaw, a wealthy businessman who was committed to progressive politics. He served as the first research director for the federal NDP's predecessor, the national Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (CCF), and an early financial backer of the NDP when it formed in 1961. McDonough was involved in social activism from an early age, when, at 14, she led her church youth group in publicizing the conditions of Africville, a low-income neighbourhood in Halifax. She attended Queen's University in Kingston, Ontario, which was her family's alma mater. After two-years, she transferred to Dalhousie University in Halifax, where she completed a sociology and psychology Bachelor of Arts degree in 1965. She became a social worker, and during the 1970 Nova Scotia general election, worked for Gerald Regan's Liberal Party, writing that party's social policy platform. She quickly became disenchanted with Regan and the Liberals, and joined the New Democratic Party in 1974. Provincial leadership McDonough's first foray into electoral politics occurred during the 1979 and 1980 federal elections. In both of those elections, she ran unsuccessfully in the federal riding of Halifax. In the 1980 federal election, she lost to former Nova Scotia premier Gerald Regan, the same politician that she once supported back in 1970. Just after the 1980 federal election, in the spring, Jeremy Akerman stepped down as the Nova Scotia NDP's leader. At this time, there was a growing rift between the Cape Breton Island and Mainland wings of the party. This rift exploded in June, when Paul MacEwan, the NDP MLA for Cape Breton Nova, was expelled from the party due to his constant public airing of internal party disputes, including the implication that Akerman resigned due to \\"Trotskyist elements\\" from the mostly mainland-based provincial council. To make this situation worse for an incoming leader, the NDP's four MLAs, all from Cape Breton constituencies, voted 3‚Äì1 to keep him in the caucus, with Len J. Arsenault ‚Äì the MLA for Cape Breton North ‚Äì being the only negative vote. MacEwan's expulsion became one of the dominant issues during the leadership race that fall. In late September, Akerman was appointed to a top Nova Scotia civil service job that required him to both resign from the Legislature and terminate his membership in the NDP. James 'Buddy' MacEachern, a leadership candidate, and MLA for Cape Breton Centre, was made the interim leader on October 2. Despite these internecine battles, and not having a seat in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly, McDonough decided to enter the leadership race. The other candidate in the race to replace Akerman was Arsenault. The leadership convention was convened in Halifax, with the leadership vote held on November 16, 1980. McDonough received 237 votes, compared to Arsenault's 42 votes, and MacEachern's 41 votes, giving her a first ballot landslide victory. As a result of her victory, she became the first woman in Canada to lead a major recognized political party. Her first order of business was to settle the Paul MacEwan question. On December 9, 1980, she managed to get her former leadership rivals to vote MacEwan out of the caucus and party. Since she did not have a seat in the Nova Scotia House of Assembly, the party was left with just two seats, because MacEwan was now an independent, and Akerman's seat was left vacant due to his resignation. For almost a year, she would sit in the Assembly's visitors gallery until she could run for a seat in the 1981 Nova Scotia general election. McDonough's first provincial election as leader was fought in the Halifax Chebucto riding, where the Liberals and Conservatives were more or less evenly matched in terms of voter support, and the NDP was a distant third in the previous election. She won her seat, the first one for the NDP in Mainland Nova Scotia, but the NDP lost all of its Cape Breton Island seats in the process. She spent the next three years as the only New Democrat, and the only woman in the House of Assembly. She took on the \\"old boys' network\\", that permeated within Nova Scotia's politics at the time, by attempting to dismantle the province's entrenched patronage system. McDonough was personally popular throughout Nova Scotia, consistently being the voters' top choice in leadership polls, but her popularity did not rub-off on the party. She led the party through three more elections, eventually building the caucus up to three members: all from the mainland, including future Nova Scotia NDP leader, Robert Chisholm. After fourteen years as the Nova Scotia NDP leader, which at the time made her the longest-serving leader of a major political party, she stepped down on November 19, 1994. John Holm, the NDP's Sackville-Cobequid MLA, took over as interim leader, until Chisholm was elected leader in 1996. Federal leadership As the fortunes of the Nova Scotia NDP were slowly rising during the mid-1990s, the same could not be said of its federal counterpart. The 1993 Canadian federal election was nothing short of an unmitigated disaster for the NDP. Under Audrey McLaughlin's leadership, the party suffered its worst defeat since the late 1950s, in terms of seats, when it was then called the CCF. When looking at the popular vote, it was the worst ever election for a federal social-democratic party in the 20th century, with just seven percent of the vote. The party only had nine seats, three short of the twelve seats needed to have official party status in the House of Commons, and all the extra funding, research, office space and Question Period privileges it accords. In the aftermath of the 1993 election, the party set about reforming its policies and purpose, with McLaughlin announcing on April 18, 1994, that she would step down as leader by 1996. McLaughlin, faced with internal squabbles similar to those that occurred in the Nova Scotia party back in 1980, advanced her departure from the end of 1996 to the end of 1995. With an internal party atmosphere that could best be described as toxic, McDonough entered the leadership race in the spring of 1995. The conditions were similar to the ones she faced during her first leadership campaign in 1980: a divided party that was self-immolating. However, the party was also hobbled by unpopular provincial NDP governments in Ontario and British Columbia. Indeed, the NDP had suffered particularly severe losses in those two provinces at the federal level in 1993, losing all of its Ontario MPs and all but two of its British Columbia MPs, more than half of its caucus. Prior to the NDP leadership convention on October 14, 1995, McDonough was widely viewed as an also-ran behind the leading contenders, Svend Robinson and Lorne Nystrom, but at the convention she placed second on the first ballot, ahead of Nystrom in what was almost a three-way split. Although Robinson had placed first on that ballot, he felt that most of Nystrom's supporters would go to McDonough on the second ballot, giving her the victory. Thus, he conceded to McDonough before a second ballot could be held. On a motion by Robinson, the convention formally acclaimed McDonough as the party's new leader. McDonough became the first person from Atlantic Canada to lead a major party since Robert Stanfield retired as the Progressive Conservatives' leader in 1976. Unusually for a major-party leader, she did not have one of her MPs in a safe seat resign so she could get into Parliament via a by- election, opting instead to make a third bid for her home riding of Halifax in the next general election. In the 1997 election, her first as leader, the party won 21 seats. This included a historic breakthrough in the Atlantic provinces, a region where it had only won three seats in its entire history prior to 1997. McDonough herself won Halifax by 11,000 votes, pushing Liberal incumbent Mary Clancy into third place. She would continue to win it consecutively three more times until she retired from politics in 2008. During the next few years, McDonough's leadership of the party elicited controversy. Union leaders were lukewarm in their support of her, often threatening to break away from the NDP, in particular, the Canadian Auto Workers's president Buzz Hargrove. She was widely seen within the NDP as trying to pull the party toward the centre of the political spectrum, in the Third Way mode of Tony Blair although when she made her leader's speech at the party's August 1999 Ottawa policy convention, she attempted to distance herself from \\"Third Way\\" policies by stating: \\"We must lay out a new way for Canadians to navigate in the 21st century. Not an old way, not a 'third way,' but a made-in-Canada way....\\" A vote on a resolution to adopt Third Way policies in the party's platform formally was defeated, as many union leaders opposed it and McDonough's \\"Canadian Way.\\" The Canadian Alliance and its new leader, Stockwell Day, presented a further challenge to McDonough's NDP. Fearful of the prospect of an Alliance government, many NDP supporters moved to the Liberals. As well, two NDP MPs, Rick Laliberte and Angela Vautour, crossed the floor to other party caucuses, reducing the NDP caucus to 19 seats. In the 2000 federal election, the NDP was held to just 13 seats, and its 8.5 percent of the popular vote, was near its historic low from the 1993 campaign. About the only solace the NDP and McDonough could take from the 2000 campaign was that they kept official party status in the House of Commons (if only barely), unlike McLaughlin in the 1993 campaign. After the disappointing performance in the 2000 federal election, there were more calls for party renewal,. Some party activists perceived that the NDP had moved to the centre of the political spectrum and wanted to change that by bringing in social/political activists outside of the parliamentary process. They called their movement the New Politics Initiative, or NPI. Another group, called NDProgress, wanted to reform the party's internal structures, with procedural changes to how leaders were elected and limiting how much control Labour Unions had in the party. The NPI proposal to create a new party from the ashes of the NDP, was opposed by McDonough, and by former NDP leader, Ed Broadbent. The NPI resolution was voted down when it was presented at the party's November 2001 Winnipeg policy convention. NDProgress's resolution to have a \\"one member one vote\\" election for party leader, with a provision to limit organized labour's allotment of ballots to a maximum of 25 percent, passed. The 2001 Winnipeg convention was also where McDonough easily defeated a leadership challenge by Socialist Caucus member Marcel Hatch, who was also an NPI supporter. The issue that highlighted McDonough's federal leadership, occurred during the twilight of her career: the fight against Islamophobia and general anti-Arab sentiment, which swept through Canada and the United States in the wake of the 9/11 attacks in September 2001. She led the charge on the national scene to repatriate Mahar Arar, an Arab-Canadian who was wrongly detained as a terrorist by United States border officials, on an erroneous tip from Canada's secret service. Throughout 2002 and 2003, McDonough campaigned for his release. When he was released, his wife, Monia Mazigh, joined the NDP and became a candidate for them in the 2004 federal election, out of recognition for the support McDonough and the party showed for her and her husband. With Brian Masse's May 2002 by-election victory, in the Windsor West riding, the party's caucus grew to 14 members. A few weeks later, on June 5, 2002, McDonough used this positive turn in electoral fortunes to announce that she was stepping down as NDP leader. On January 25, 2003, at the Toronto leadership convention, she was succeeded by Jack Layton. She was re-elected to Parliament in the 2004 federal election and again in 2006. In the NDP's shadow cabinet, McDonough served as the critic for International Development, International Cooperation and Peace Advocacy. Retirement On June 2, 2008, McDonough announced that she would not run again in the riding of Halifax in the next federal election. She made the announcement at the Lord Nelson Hotel, the same place where she celebrated her 1997 victory as the MP for Halifax. McDonough said that she would continue on as the MP for Halifax until the next federal election. On June 29, 2009, it was announced that McDonough was named the new interim president of Mount Saint Vincent University, in Halifax, Nova Scotia. Her one-year appointment began in August 2009. It was announced on December 30, 2009, that she will be appointed an officer of the Order of Canada for her pioneering work as both the Nova Scotia and Federal leader of the New Democratic Party. She received an honorary Doctor of Civil Laws degree from Acadia University, in Wolfville, Nova Scotia on May 13, 2012. Personal life Her first marriage was to Halifax lawyer, Peter McDonough, with whom she had two sons: Justin and Travis. In 1993 she separated from Peter McDonough, and is now divorced from him, though she claims that her political career did not play a part in it. In 1994, just before she stepped down as Nova Scotia leader, she had a hysterectomy, and waited until she recuperated before she announced her resignation. During her time as leader of the federal NDP, McDonough was romantically involved with David MacDonald, a former Progressive Conservative (PC) MP for Toronto Centre‚ÄîRosedale and a cabinet minister. MacDonald ran as the NDP candidate in Toronto Centre‚ÄîRosedale in the 1997 election; in the previous election, he was the PC incumbent, and like every other PC candidate in Ontario in 1993, was defeated. The pair split up prior to the 2004 federal election McDonough's retirement has been focused on her 7 grandchildren, along with travel with friends. On May 3, 2013, McDonough announced that she had been diagnosed with breast cancer about four months earlier during a mammogram. She has been receiving treatment and is doing well.

It is a phytosteroid and is similar in structure and effects to digoxin (though the effects are longer-lasting). Unlike digoxin (which is eliminated from the body via the kidneys), it is eliminated via the liver, so could be used in patients with poor or erratic kidney function. However, it is now rarely used in current Western medical practice. While several controlled trials have shown digoxin to be effective in a proportion of patients treated for heart failure, the evidence base for digitoxin is not as strong, although it is presumed to be similarly effective. Toxicity Digitoxin exhibits similar toxic effects to the more commonly used digoxin, namely: anorexia, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, confusion, visual disturbances, and cardiac arrhythmias. Antidigoxin antibody fragments, the specific treatment for digoxin poisoning, are also effective in serious digitoxin toxicity. History The first description of the use of foxglove dates back to 1775. For quite some time, the active compound was not isolated. Oswald Schmiedeberg was able to obtain a pure sample in 1875. The modern therapeutic use of this molecule was made possible by the works of the pharmacist and the French chemist Claude-Adolphe Nativelle (1812-1889). The first structural analysis was done by Adolf Otto Reinhold Windaus in 1925, but the full structure with an exact determination of the sugar groups was not accomplished until 1962.

Use in cancer chemotherapy  Digitoxin and related cardenolides display potent anticancer activity against a range of human cancer cell lines in vitro but the clinical use of digitoxin to treat cancer has been restricted by its narrow therapeutic index. Digitoxin glycorandomization led to the discovery of novel digitoxigenin neoglycosides which displayed improved anticancer potency and reduced inotropic activity (the perceived mechanism of general toxicity). Steroidal glycosides based upon this latter discovery served as the basis for the development of a new class of antibody-drug conjugate known as extracellular drug conjugates (EDCs) as first in class agents to treat cancer by the biotechnology company Centrose.

A modern townhouse is often one with a small footprint on multiple floors. In a different British usage, the term originally referred to any type of city residence (normally in London) of someone whose main or largest residence was a country house. History Historically, a townhouse was the city residence of a noble or wealthy family, who would own one or more country houses in which they lived for much of the year. From the 18th century, landowners and their servants would move to a townhouse during the social season (when major balls took place).For a description of an 18th-century town house in England, for example, see Olsen, Kirsten. Daily Life in 18th-Century England. Greenwood Publishing Group, 1999, pp. 84‚Äì85. Also see Stewart, Rachel. The Town House in Georgian London. Yale University Press for the Paul Mellon Centre for Studies in British Art, 2009. Europe The Norfolk House is on the far right on this mid-18th-century engraving. In the United Kingdom, most townhouses are terraced. Only a small minority of them, generally the largest, were detached, but even aristocrats whose country houses had grounds of hundreds or thousands of acres often lived in terraced houses in town. For example, the Duke of Norfolk owned Arundel Castle in the country, while his London house, Norfolk House, was a terraced house in St James's Square over 100 feet (30 meters) wide. North America In the United States and Canada, a townhouse has two connotations. The older predates the automobile and denotes a house on a small footprint in a city, but because of its multiple floors (sometimes six or more), it has a large living space, often with servants' quarters. The small footprint of the townhouse allows it to be within walking or mass-transit distance of business and industrial areas of the city, yet luxurious enough for wealthy residents of the city.For a history of the townhouse in the United States, see Herman, Bernard L. Town House: Architecture and Material Life in the Early American City, 1780-1830. UNC Press Books, 2005. Townhouses in Portland, Oregon Townhouses are expensive where detached single-family houses are uncommon, such as in New York City, Chicago, Boston, Philadelphia, Toronto, Washington, DC, and San Francisco. Rowhouses are similar and consist of several adjacent, uniform units originally found in older, pre-automobile urban areas such as Baltimore, Philadelphia, Charleston (South Carolina), Savannah and New Orleans, but now found in lower-cost housing developments in suburbs as well. A townhouse is where there is a continuous roof and foundation, and a single wall divides adjacent townhouses, but some have a double wall with inches-wide air space in between on a common foundation. A rowhouse will generally be smaller and less luxurious than a dwelling called a townhouse. Suburban style: a townhouse in Burke, Virginia The name townhouse or townhome was later used to describe non-uniform units in suburban areas that are designed to mimic detached or semi-detached homes. Today, the term townhouse is used to describe units mimicking a detached home that are attached in a multi-unit complex. The distinction between living units called apartments and those called townhouses is that townhouses usually consist of multiple floors and have their own outside door as opposed to having only one level and/or having access via an interior corridor hallway or via an exterior balcony-style walkway (more common in the warmer climates). Another distinction is that in most areas of the US outside of the very largest cities, apartment refers to rental housing, and townhouse typically refers to an individually owned dwelling, with no other unit beneath or above although the term townhouse-style (rental) apartment is also heard for bi-level apartments. Townhouses can also be \\"stacked\\". Such homes have multiple units vertically (typically two), normally each with its own private entrance from the street or at least from the outside. They can be side by side in a row of three or more, in which case they are sometimes referred to as rowhouses. A townhouse in a group of two could be referred to as a townhouse, but in Canada and the US, it is typically called a semi-detached home and in some areas of western Canada, a half- duplex. In Canada, single-family dwellings, be they any type, such as single- family detached homes, apartments, mobile homes, or townhouses, for example, are split into two categories of ownership: * Condominium (strata title), where one owns the interior of the unit and also a specified share of the undivided interest of the remainder of the building and land known as common elements. * Freehold, where one owns exclusively the land and the dwelling without any condominium aspects. These may share the foundation as well but have narrow air spaces between and still referred to as a townhouse. Condominium townhouses, just like condominium apartments, are often referred to as condos, thus referring to the type of ownership rather than to the type of dwelling. Since apartment style condos are the most common, when someone refers to a condo, many erroneously assume that it must be an apartment-style dwelling and conversely that only apartment-style dwellings can be condos. All types of dwellings can be condos, and this is therefore true of townhouses. A brownstone townhouse is a particular variety found in New York. Asia, Australia, South Africa, Zimbabwe Boulevard du Lac in The Beverly Hills, a private townhouse development in Tai Po, Hong Kong In Asia, Australia, South Africa and Zimbabwe , the usage of the term follows the North American sense. Townhouses are generally found in complexes. Large complexes often have high security, resort facilities such as swimming pools, gyms, parks and playground equipment. Typically, a townhouse has a Strata Title; i.e., a type of title where the common property (landscaped area, public corridors, building structure, etc.) is owned by a corporation of individual owners and the houses on the property are owned by the individual owners. In population-dense Asian cities dominated by high-rise residential apartment blocks, such as Hong Kong, townhouses in private housing developments remain almost exclusively populated by the very wealthy due to the rarity and relatively large sizes of the units. Prominent examples in Hong Kong include Severn 8, in which a townhouse sold for HK$285 million (US$37 million) in 2008, or HK$57,000 (US$7,400) per square foot, a record in Asia, and The Beverly Hills, which consists of multiple rows of townhouses with some units as large as . Commonly in the suburbs of major cities, an old house on a large block of land is demolished and replaced by a short row of townhouses, built 'end on' to the street for added privacy.

Ropes have tensile strength and so can be used for dragging and lifting. Rope is thicker and stronger than similarly constructed cord, string, and twine.  Construction  Three-strand natural fiber laid line Rope may be constructed of any long, stringy, fibrous material, but generally is constructed of certain natural or synthetic fibres. Synthetic fibre ropes are significantly stronger than their natural fibre counterparts, they have a higher tensile strength, they are more resistant to rotting than ropes created from natural fibers, and they can be made to float on water. But synthetic rope also possess certain disadvantages, including slipperiness, and some can be damaged more easily by UV light. Common natural fibres for rope are manila hemp, hemp, linen, cotton, coir, jute, straw, and sisal. Synthetic fibres in use for rope-making include polypropylene, nylon, polyesters (e.g. PET, LCP, Vectran), polyethylene (e.g. Dyneema and Spectra), Aramids (e.g. Twaron, Technora and Kevlar) and acrylics (e.g. Dralon). Some ropes are constructed of mixtures of several fibres or use co-polymer fibres. Wire rope is made of steel or other metal alloys. Ropes have been constructed of other fibrous materials such as silk, wool, and hair, but such ropes are not generally available. Rayon is a regenerated fibre used to make decorative rope. The twist of the strands in a twisted or braided rope serves not only to keep a rope together, but enables the rope to more evenly distribute tension among the individual strands. Without any twist in the rope, the shortest strand(s) would always be supporting a much higher proportion of the total load.  Size measurement  The long history of rope means that many systems have been used to state the size of a rope. In systems that use the \\"inch\\" (British Imperial and United States Customary Measure), large ropes over diameter such as are used on ships are measured by their circumference in inches; smaller ropes have a nominal diameter based on the circumference divided by three (rounded- down value for pi). In metric systems of measurement, nominal diameter is given in millimetres. The current preferred international standard for rope sizes is to give the mass per unit length, in kilograms per metre. However, even sources otherwise using metric units may still give a \\"rope number\\" for large ropes, which is the circumference in inches.H A McKenna, J. W. S. Hearle, N O'Hear, Handbook of Fibre Rope Technology, Elsevier, 2004,, page 18  Use  Bollard and mooring line Rope has been used since prehistoric times. It is of paramount importance in fields as diverse as construction, seafaring, exploration, sports, theatre, and communications. Many types of knots have been developed to fasten with rope, join ropes, and utilize rope to generate mechanical advantage. Pulleys can redirect the pulling force of a rope in another direction, multiply its lifting or pulling power, and distribute a load over multiple parts of the same rope to increase safety and decrease wear. Winches and capstans are machines designed to pull ropes. = Rock climbing ropes = Dynamic kernmantle rock climbing rope with its braided sheath cut to expose the twisted core yarns and core yarn plies Section through kernmantle rope The sport of rock climbing uses what is termed \\"dynamic\\" rope, an elastic rope which stretches under load to absorb the energy generated in arrestIng a fall without creating forces high enough to injure the climber. Such ropes are of kernmantle construction, as described below. Oppositely, \\"static\\" ropes have minimal stretch and are not designed to arrest free falls. They are used in caving, rappelling, rescue applications, and industries such as window washing. The UIAA, in concert with the CEN, sets climbing-rope standards and oversees testing. Any rope bearing a GUIANA or CE certification tag is suitable for climbing. Climbing ropes cut easily when under load. Keeping them away from sharp rock edges is imperative. Previous falls arrested by a rope, damage to its sheath, and contamination by dirt or solvents all weaken a rope and can render it unsuitable for further sport use. Rock climbing ropes are designated as suitable for single, double or twin use. A single rope is the most common, and is intended to be used by itself. These range in thickness from roughly 9 mm to 11 mm. Smaller diameter ropes are lighter, but wear out faster. Double ropes are thinner than single, usually 9 mm and under, and are intended for use in pairs. These offer a greater margin of safety against cutting, since it is unlikely that both ropes will be cut, but complicate both belaying and leading. Double ropes may be clipped into alternating pieces of protection, allowing each to stay straighter and reduce Both individual and totalrope drag. Twin ropes are thin ropes which must be clipped into the same piece of protection, in effect being treated as a single strand. This adds security in situations where a rope may get cut. However new lighter-weight ropes with greater safety have virtually replaced this type of rope. The butterfly and alpine coils are methods of coiling a rope for carrying.  History  Ancient Egyptians were the first to document tools for ropemaking The use of ropes for hunting, pulling, fastening, attaching, carrying, lifting, and climbing dates back to prehistoric times. It is likely that the earliest \\"ropes\\" were naturally occurring lengths of plant fibre, such as vines, followed soon by the first attempts at twisting and braiding these strands together to form the first proper ropes in the modern sense of the word. The earliest evidence of true rope making is a very small fragment of three-ply cord from a Neanderthal site dated 40,000 years ago. Later impressions of cordage found on fired clay provide evidence of string and rope-making technology in Europe dating back 28,000 years. Fossilized fragments of \\"probably two-ply laid rope of about 7 mm diameter\\" were found in one of the caves at Lascaux, dating to approximately 15,000 BC.J.C. Turner and P. van de Griend (ed.), The History and Science of Knots (Singapore: World Scientific, 1996), 14. The ancient Egyptians were probably the first civilization to develop special tools to make rope. Egyptian rope dates back to 4000 to 3500 BC and was generally made of water reed fibres.(See http://www.madehow.com/Volume-2/Rope.html, word-for-word not sure which \\"plagiarized\\" which) Other rope in antiquity was made from the fibres of date palms, flax, grass, papyrus, leather, or animal hair. The use of such ropes pulled by thousands of workers allowed the Egyptians to move the heavy stones required to build their monuments. Starting from approximately 2800 BC, rope made of hemp fibres was in use in China. Rope and the craft of rope making spread throughout Asia, India, and Europe over the next several thousand years. From the Middle Ages until the 18th century, in Europe ropes were constructed in ropewalks, very long buildings where strands the full length of the rope were spread out and then laid up or twisted together to form the rope. The cable length was thus set by the length of the available rope walk. This is related to the unit of length termed cable length. This allowed for long ropes of up to 300 yards long or longer to be made. These long ropes were necessary in shipping as short ropes would require splicing to make them long enough to use for sheets and halyards. The strongest form of splicing is the short splice, which doubles the cross-sectional area of the rope at the area of the splice, which would cause problems in running the line through pulleys. Any splices narrow enough to maintain smooth running would be less able to support the required weight. Leonardo da Vinci drew sketches of a concept for a ropemaking machine, but it was never built. Remarkable feats of construction were accomplished using rope but without advanced technology: In 1586, Domenico Fontana erected the 327 ton obelisk on Rome's Saint Peter's Square with a concerted effort of 900 men, 75 horses, and countless pulleys and meters of rope. By the late 18th century several working machines had been built and patented. Some rope is still made from natural fibres, such as coir and sisal, despite the dominance of synthetic fibres such as nylon and polypropylene, which have become increasingly popular since the 1950s.

Common twisted rope generally consists of three strands and is normally right-laid, or given a final right-handed twist. The ISO 2 standard uses the uppercase letters S and Z to indicate the two possible directions of twist, as suggested by the direction of slant of the central portions of these two letters. The handedness of the twist is the direction of the twists as they progress away from an observer. Thus Z-twist rope is said to be right-handed, and S-twist to be left-handed. Twisted ropes are built up in three steps. First, fibres are gathered and spun into yarns. A number of these yarns are then formed into strands by twisting. The strands are then twisted together to lay the rope. The twist of the yarn is opposite to that of the strand, and that in turn is opposite to that of the rope. It is this counter-twist, introduced with each successive operation, which holds the final rope together as a stable, unified object. Rope making using the twisted rope method on a 1928 Metters Rope Making Machine Traditionally, a three strand laid rope is called a plain- or hawser-laid, a four strand rope is called shroud-laid, and a larger rope formed by counter-twisting three or more multi-strand ropes together is called cable-laid. Cable-laid rope is sometimes clamped to maintain a tight counter- twist rendering the resulting cable virtually waterproof. Without this feature, deep water sailing (before the advent of steel chains and other lines) was largely impossible, as any appreciable length of rope for anchoring or ship to ship transfers, would become too waterlogged ‚Äì and therefore too heavy ‚Äì to lift, even with the aid of a capstan or windlass. One property of laid rope is partial untwisting when used. This can cause spinning of suspended loads, or stretching, kinking, or hockling of the rope itself. An additional drawback of twisted construction is that every fibre is exposed to abrasion numerous times along the length of the rope. This means that the rope can degrade to numerous inch-long fibre fragments, which is not easily detected visually. Twisted ropes have a preferred direction for coiling. Normal right-laid rope should be coiled clockwise, to prevent kinking. Coiling this way imparts a twist to the rope. Rope of this type must be bound at its ends by some means to prevent untwisting. = Braided rope = A rope braiding machine at the Arbetets Museum (Museum of Work) in Norrk√∂ping, Sweden While rope may be made from three or more strands, modern braided rope consists of a braided (tubular) jacket over strands of fiber (these may also be braided). Some forms of braided rope with untwisted cores have a particular advantage; they do not impart an additional twisting force when they are stressed. The lack of added twisting forces is an advantage when a load is freely suspended, as when a rope is used for rappelling or to suspend an arborist. Other specialized cores reduce the shock from arresting a fall when used as a part of a personal or group safety system. Braided ropes are generally made from nylon, polyester, polypropylene or high performance fibers such as high modulus polyethylene (HMPE) and aramid. Nylon is chosen for its strength and elastic stretch properties. However, nylon absorbs water and is 10‚Äì15% weaker when wet. Polyester is about 90% as strong as nylon but stretches less under load and is not affected by water. It has somewhat better UV resistance, and is more abrasion resistant. Polypropylene is preferred for low cost and light weight (it floats on water) but it has limited resistance to ultraviolet light, is susceptible to friction and has a poor heat resistance. Braided ropes (and objects like garden hoses, fibre optic or coaxial cables, etc.) that have no lay (or inherent twist) uncoil better if each alternate loop is twisted in the opposite direction, such as in figure-eight coils, where the twist reverses regularly and essentially cancels out. Single braid consists of an even number of strands, eight or twelve being typical, braided into a circular pattern with half of the strands going clockwise and the other half going anticlockwise. The strands can interlock with either twill or plain weave. The central void may be large or small; in the former case the term hollow braid is sometimes preferred. Double braid, also called braid on braid, consists of an inner braid filling the central void in an outer braid, that may be of the same or different material. Often the inner braid fibre is chosen for strength while the outer braid fibre is chosen for abrasion resistance. In solid braid, the strands all travel the same direction, clockwise or anticlockwise, and alternate between forming the outside of the rope and the interior of the rope. This construction is popular for general purpose utility rope but rare in specialized high performance line. Kernmantle rope has a core (kern) of long twisted fibres in the center, with a braided outer sheath or mantle of woven fibres. The kern provides most of the strength (about 70%), while the mantle protects the kern and determines the handling properties of the rope (how easy it is to hold, to tie knots in, and so on). In dynamic climbing line, core fibres are usually twisted, and chopped into shorter lengths, which makes the rope more elastic. Static kernmantle ropes are made with untwisted core fibres and tighter braid, which causes them to be stiffer in addition to limiting the stretch. = Other types = Plaited rope is made by braiding twisted strands, and is also called square braid. It is not as round as twisted rope and coarser to the touch. It is less prone to kinking than twisted rope and, depending on the material, very flexible and therefore easy to handle and knot. This construction exposes all fibres as well, with the same drawbacks as described above. Brait rope is a combination of braided and plaited, a non-rotating alternative to laid three-strand ropes. Due to its excellent energy-absorption characteristics, it is often used by arborists. It is also a popular rope for anchoring and can be used as mooring warps. This type of construction was pioneered by Yale Cordage. Endless winding rope is made by winding single strands of high-performance yarns around two end terminations until the desired break strength or stiffness has been reached. This type of rope (often specified as cable to make the difference between a braided or twined construction) has the advantage of having no construction stretch as is the case with above constructions. Endless winding is pioneered by SmartRigging and FibreMax.

To prevent kinking it is usually coiled. To prevent fraying or unravelling, the ends of a rope are bound with twine (whipping), tape, or heat shrink tubing. The ends of plastic fibre ropes are often melted and fused solid; however, the rope and knotting expert Geoffrey Budworth warns against this practice thus: > Sealing rope ends this way is lazy and dangerous. A tugboat operator once > sliced the palm of his hand open down to the sinews after the hardened (and > obviously sharp) end of a rope that had been heat-sealed pulled through his > grasp. There is no substitute for a properly made whipping. If a load-bearing rope gets a sharp or sudden jolt or the rope shows signs of deteriorating, it is recommended that the rope be replaced immediately and should be discarded or only used for non-load-bearing tasks. The average rope life-span is 5 years. Serious inspection should be given to line after that point. However, the use to which a rope is put affects frequency of inspection. Rope used in mission-critical applications, such as mooring lines or running rigging, should be regularly inspected on a much shorter timescale than this, and rope used in life-critical applications such as mountain climbing should be inspected on a far more frequent basis, up to and including before each use. Avoid stepping on climbing rope, as this might force tiny pieces of rock through the sheath, which can eventually deteriorate the core of the rope. Ropes may be flemished into coils on deck for safety, presentation, and tidiness. Many types of filaments in ropes are weakened by corrosive liquids, solvents, and high temperatures. Such damage is particularly treacherous because it often invisible to the eye. Shock loading should be avoided with general use ropes, as it can damage them. All ropes should be used within a safe working load, which is much less than their breaking strength. A rope under tension ‚Äì particularly if it has a great deal of elasticity ‚Äì can be dangerous if parted. Care should be taken around lines under load.  Terminology  \\"Rope\\" is a material, and a tool. When it is assigned a specific function it is often referred to as a \\"line\\", especially in nautical usage. A line may get a further distinction, for example sail control lines are known as ‚Äúsheets‚Äù (e.g. A jib sheet). A halyard is a line used to raise and lower a sail, typically with a shackle on its sail end. Other maritime examples of ‚Äúlines‚Äù include anchor line, mooring line, fishing line, . Common items include clothesline and a chalk line. In some marine uses the term rope is retained, such as man rope, bolt rope, and bell rope.

Both of these papers espoused the doctrines traditionally known as Calvinism. In 1979, the Sword and Trowel leaders began to sponsor an annual \\"Council on Baptist Theology.\\" Through this form of exchange, it became clear that this \\"Dallas\\" group held different understandings, especially in the area of Covenant Theology, from those espoused by northeastern Reformed Baptists led by Walter Chantry and Albert N.

Beliefs held by the churches of this body include the doctrines of grace, often referred to as the Five Points of Calvinism, the gathered believers church, believers' baptism by immersion requisite to church membership and to participation at the Lord's table, and the autonomy of each local church. Continental Baptist Churches accept the First London Confession of Faith (1646 edition) as a general expression of their beliefs. Continental Baptist churches generally disagree with other Baptists in the Reformed tradition concerning the function of the moral law and the ten commandments in the Christian age, maintaining, for instance, the seventh-day Sabbath position that Christians have no obligation to observe the first day of the week as Christian Sabbath because of the fourth commandment. The organizational structure includes an Executive Committee composed of a Council elected by the churches and the officers (Chairman, Vice Chairman, Secretary and Treasurer) elected by the association. A periodical called Kindred Minds is the official publication of Continental Baptist Churches. The association holds a Bible Conference and business meeting each year. In 1995, nine churches were participating in the association.

Both the membership and interests of the society are worldwide. History The organization, originally named the American Philatelic Association, was established on September 14, 1886 in New York City, and the following day elected John K. Tiffany as its first president. Voting membership was granted to 219 individuals who paid two bits (25¬¢) for the privilege. The organization's name was changed to its present name for a few months in 1897, then back, then permanently in 1908. Society membership reached over 4,000 in 1940, and included U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt and his Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes. At the 1942 APS convention, board member Donald Lybarger argued for the creation of a central office near the geographic center of the philatelic community, but not in a large city. When he was elected APS President in 1943, he was able to turn his vision into reality. At the 1944 APS convention it was announced that the APS would accept applications for the position of Executive Secretary. H. Clay Musser of State College, Pennsylvania, was selected and the APS office was established there on April 1, 1945. As a testament to their leadership, the APS became the US representative to the Federation Internationale de Philatelie in 1947. By the mid-1990s, the expanded services, staff and the American Philatelic Research Library had outgrown the facility in State College. A study determined that because of high local real estate values, it was not cost effective to expand the existing building. A search of alternatives identified a property ten miles (sixteen kilometers) from State College that was basically sound and could be acquired for a reasonable amount. In 2002, after much discussion, debate and soul searching, the APS committed millions of dollars to purchasing and renovating what was known as the Match Factory in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania. The American Philatelic Center was dedicated in June, 2004. Philatelic services APS headquarters in the renovated Match Factory The APS offers several services to its members: * The American Philatelist - monthly magazineThe American Philatelist web page * StampStore - online stamp buying * member sales circuits via mail * American Philatelic Research Library * Insurance for stamp collections * American Philatelic Expertizing Service * Accreditation of Judges and National Exhibitions * Educational opportunities * Member Code of Ethics and a Complaint Process * APS Stamp Talk with Nancy Clark on internet radio talk station wsRadio. Members APS membership includes over 600 commercial stamp dealers and about 450 local stamp clubs. In addition, nearly 200 specialty societies are affiliated with the APS. Individual membership reached a high of 57,000 in 1991, and stands at just over 28,000 as of June 2018. Events The organization has two national events each year: APS AmeriStamp Expo is held each Winter and APS StampShow is scheduled in the Summer. Both shows rotate to different locations around the country. The Summer event is the largest annual national show with 150 dealers, 10,000 pages of exhibits, meetings of more than 25 national societies, and over 100 educational seminars. Local stamp clubs host smaller shows, some several times each year. According to the ARIPEX website, its 61st annual show to be held 15‚Äì17 February 2019 in Mesa, AZ, will be \\"the last winter show conducted by the APS.\\"http://www.aripex.org Honors and awards The society honors those who serve notably in the field of philately. The American Philatelic Society Hall of Fame honors those now-deceased philatelists who have served philately. In addition the society honors living distinguished philatelists for their contributions to the field with the Luff Award. Controversy Around 1970, numerous newly independent countries realized that issuing stamps was an excellent source of revenue. Because the stamps were sent to other countries, there was little risk of the stamps actually being used for postage. Historically, a country issued stamps to commemorate an event or honor a national figure, but these new nations created stamps that appealed to popular collecting themes, such as Disney figures, airplanes or space, famous people in the world. Instead of releasing a single stamp, they would create a set, with values ranging from a penny to five dollars. The APS was appalled, and created the ‚Äúblack blot‚Äù program. The society published a monthly magazine for members, and began to include a list of new stamp issues that were judged to be overpriced or unnecessary. A country with high illiteracy and a marginal postal service did not require 100 different stamps each year. However, many collectors rebelled at being told to reject some stamps, and the program was eventually dropped.

They are the successors of the popular HP 48 series. There are five calculators in the 49/50 series of HP graphing calculators. These calculators have both algebraic and RPN entry modes, and can perform numeric and symbolic calculations using the built-in Computer Algebra System (CAS), which is an improved ALG48 and Erable combination from the HP 48 series. HP 49G Released in August 1999, the HP 49G (F1633A, F1896A) calculator was the first HP unit to break from the more traditional subdued coloration. In addition to having a metallic blue color, the keyboard material was rubber and did not have the traditional HP calculator hinged keyboard feel. In addition, it lacked a large key which was seen by many as the defining characteristic of an HP calculator. These changes were disliked by many traditional HP calculator users. The 49G incorporated many of the most powerful interface and mathematics tools available on the HP 48 series into the firmware of the new 49G, including the ability to easily decompile and compile both SysRPL and Saturn assembly code on the unit. The 49G was the first HP calculator to use flash memory and have an upgradable firmware. In addition, it had a hard sliding case as opposed to the soft pouches supplied with the HP 48 series. Almost the same hardware is also used by the HP 39G and HP 40G. The last officially supported firmware update for the 49G calculator was 1.18, but several unofficial firmware versions were released by the developers. The final firmware version was 1.19-6. Several firmware versions for the successor hp 49g+ and HP 50g calculators have also been released in builds intended for PC emulation software that lacked full utilization of the successors' ARM CPU. Until at least firmware version 2.09, those emulator builds could be installed on the original HP 49G. In 2003, the CAS source code of the 49G firmware was released under the LGPL. In addition, this release included an interactive geometry program and some commands to allow compatibility with certain programs written for the newer 49g+ calculator. Due to licensing restrictions, the recompiled firmware cannot be redistributed. hp 49g+ In August 2003, Hewlett-Packard released the hp 49g+ (F2228A). This unit had metallic gold coloration and was backward compatible with the HP 49G. Instead of the rubber keyboard found on the HP 49G, this calculator's keyboard had plastic hinges intended to return the feel of older HP calculators, and also included a pouch to protect the unit, similar to those included with older HP models. It was designed and manufactured by Kinpo Electronics for HP. This calculator featured an entirely new processor architecture, USB (Mini-B) and IrDA (IrCOMM) infrared communication, memory expansion via an SD (SDSC/MMC) card, and a slightly larger screen, as well as other improvements over the previous model. The calculator system did not run directly on the new ARM processor, but rather on an emulation layer for the older Saturn processors found in previous HP calculators. This allowed the 49g+ to maintain binary-level compatibility with most of the programs written for the HP 49G calculator, as well as source code-level compatibility with many written for the HP 48 series. Despite the emulation, the 49g+ was still much faster than any older model of HP calculator. The speed increase over the HP 49G is around 3-7 times depending on the task. It is even possible to run programs written for the ARM processor thus bypassing the emulation layer completely. A port of the GNU C compiler is also available (see HPGCC below). hp 48gII The hp 48gII (F2226A), which was announced on 20 October 2003, was not a replacement for the HP 48 series as its name suggested. Rather it was a 49g+, also with an ARM processor (unlike the HP 48G), but with reduced memory, no expansion via an SD memory card, lower clock speed, a smaller screen, and a non-flashable firmware. This calculator seems to target users that desire mathematical capability, but have no desire to install many programs. The original 2003 version had 128 KiB RAM and ran on 3 AAA batteries, whereas the second 2007 version (based on the Apple V2 platform) needs four AAA batteries and comes with 256 KiB RAM, added a USB (Mini-B) port and features a better keyboard. HP 50g The HP 50g (F2229A) is the latest calculator in the 49/50 series. The most apparent change is a revised color scheme, returning the unit to a more traditional HP calculator appearance. Using black plastic for the entire body, white, orange and yellow are used for function shift keys. The back shell is textured more deeply than the 49g+ to provide a more secure grip. A blue and white color scheme variant specifically tailored for high-contrast is available as well (NW240AA). HP 50g in blue The form and size of the calculator shell is identical to the 49g+ series, but four AAA batteries are used as opposed to three in previous models. In addition to all the features of the 49g+, the 50g also includes the full equation library found in the HP 48G series (also available for the 49g+ with firmware 2.06 and above), as well as the periodic table library originally available as a plug-in card for the 48S series, as of firmware 2.15/ 2.16 (the latest, as of 2015), and has a 3.3V TTL-level asynchronous serial port in addition to IrDA and USB Mini-B ports of the 49g+. Like the 49g+, the range of the infrared port has been limited to about 10 cm (4 inches). The asynchronous serial port is not a true RS-232 port as it uses different voltage levels and a non-standard connector. An external converter/adapter is required to interface with RS-232 equipment. The keyboard, the most often criticized feature of the 49g+ calculators, uses the new design introduced on the very last 49g+ calculators (hinged keys) to eliminate previous problems. A worldwide announcement regarding the availability of this calculator was made by HP in September 2006, and official details were available on the HP calculators webpage. The calculator was officially discontinued in 2015. Programming The HP 49/50 series of calculators support both algebraic and a stack-based programming language named RPL, a combination of Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) and Lisp. RPL adds the concepts of lists and functions to stack-based programming, allowing the programmer to pass unevaluated code as arguments to functions, or return unevaluated code from a function by leaving it on the stack. The highest level language is User RPL, consisting of sequences of built-in postfix operations, optionally including loops and conditionals. Every User RPL command checks the stack for its particular arguments and returns an error if they are incorrect or not present. Below User RPL is System RPL (SysRPL). Most System RPL commands lack argument checking and are defined only for specific argument types (e.g. short integer vs. long integer), making System RPL programs run dramatically faster than equivalent User RPL ones. In addition, System RPL includes many advanced functions that are not available in User RPL. System RPL programs can be created without the use of PC software (although it is available), thanks to the calculator's built-in compiler, MASD. MASD also can compile Saturn assembly language and, with the latest firmware revision for the 49g+/50g, ARMv4T assembly language on the calculator itself. Many tools exist to assist programmers and make the calculator a powerful programming environment. Saturn assembly, and, on the 49g+/50g, ARM assembly and C, are also programmable using desktop based compilers. See also the programs available for the HP 48 series. No model of this series is programmable in HP PPL. HPGCC for the 49g+/50g HPGCC is an implementation of the GCC compiler, released under the GNU GPL. It is now mainly targeted at the ARM- based 49g+/50g calculators. Previous versions of HPGCC supported the other ARM-based calculator models (the 48gII, and the hp 39g+/HP 39gs/HP 40gs), but this was removed due to lack of interest and compatibility issues. Formally, HPGCC is a cross-compiler; it compiles code for the ARM-based HP calculators, but runs on a PC rather than the target system. The latest version of HPGCC offers many enhancements from earlier versions. Most notably, the compiled code is now in ARM Thumb mode by default, resulting in great reduction in code size with little performance hit. Besides implementing most of ANSI C, there are device-specific libraries that allow access to things like the calculator's RPN stack, memory and piezoelectric buzzer. The GCC compiler itself is the property of the Free Software Foundation, and they state that its use does not impose any particular licensing restrictions on any of its output. However, the libraries included with HPGCC, including routines necessary to actually invoke any HPGCC-compiled program on an actual calculator, are released under a modified GPL license, contrary to GCC on many other platforms which use a more permissive license for their libraries. Thus any programs that link against them can only be distributed if they are also released under the GPL (with an exception for \\"non-profit\\" software). Linux, Windows, and Mac OS X versions are available for download. The Windows version also includes a version of Programmer's Notepad for a basic IDE. Emulators There are several emulators available for the HP 49G calculator. A version of EMU48 is available in the Debug4x IDE that allows emulation of most of the features of the 49g+/50g, but will not execute any ARM-based code. An ARM- based emulator, x49gp, has been released and allows the true emulation of the 49g+/50g ARM processor and successfully runs HPGCC 2 and 3 compiled programs. The emulator is only available for Linux and Mac OS X and must be compiled from the source. (See README.QUICKSTART for details.) The commercial version of the application m48 also supports HP 49G. So far, there are no 49g+/50g emulators for smartphones with the exception of HP 50g for iPhone and iPad released in October 2012. An emulator for Microsoft Windows Mobile (PPC, smartphones) is available. Other 49G/49g+/50g emulators for Android (without ARM support). In 2012, Hewlett-Packard released an emulator named HP 50g Virtual Calculator (version 3.1.29/3.1.30 with firmware 2.16 and support for the StreamSmart 410) for Windows. Firmware updates The 49/50 series allows the user to update the firmware to gain enhanced features or bug fixes. Official firmware updates are released by Hewlett-Packard. Unsupported unofficial firmware updates are also available at sites such as hpcalc.org.

He died prior to the publication of his first novel; his work is primarily dark fantasy.  Fan, editor, convention organizer  Thomas Earl Reamy was born in Woodson, Texas during the Great Depression. While still in his teens in the early 1950s, Reamy became active in science fiction fandom's fanzine and convention culture, as both a fan writer and fan artist. During this period, Reamy began to experiment with writing fantasy and science fiction stories. He was never quite satisfied with or confident enough to submit his stories to the editors of the professional genre magazines of the era, despite encouragement from friends and others who felt he had talent; Reamy continued to hone his writing for many years, while exploring other expressions for his growing creativity. Reamy, along with transplanted Texan Orville W. Mosher, founded the first organized science fiction fan club in Texas: The Dallas Futurian Society (DFS), so named after the earlier New York Futurians. The DFS was founded in late fall of 1953 when Reamy was eighteen, and the club was continually active until July 6, 1958, when it expired in a colorful fashion. During that five-year period, Mosher and Reamy traded off editing the club's fanzine CriFanAc (a fandom term for Critical Fan Activity), attracting a variety of contributors, both local and from greater science fiction fandom; Reamy became its sole editor with its sixth issue. He had been contributing both artwork and commentary to its pages, as he was also doing to other science fiction fanzines of the era. With fellow Dallas Futurians James and Gregory Benford, Reamy organized the first science fiction convention held in Texas. A rotating city and state regional convention of the era, Southwesterncon's sixth incarnation was held in Dallas on the weekend of July 5, 1958, concluding the next day, July 6; the professional guest of honor was new writer and well-known fan Marion Zimmer Bradley, who by then had replaced Fredric Brown. Longtime science fiction fan personality, collector, and literary agent Forrest J Ackerman came from Los Angeles and served at the convention's banquet as toastmaster. During the mid-to-late 1960s, while working as a technical illustrator for aerospace contractor Collins Radio at their Dallas branch, Reamy became the editor and publisher of Trumpet, a slickly produced, professionally printed fanzine (the norm for the era was to use the much less expensive ditto or mimeograph reproduction for fanzines). Between 1965 and 1969 ten issues appeared, the later issues having full-color front covers. In 1966 Trumpet received enough nominations for inclusion on that year's final Hugo Awards ballot; it was later ruled as being ineligible because it failed to meet the Hugo's minimum number of published issues requirement needed for nomination. In 1967 and then again in 1969 Trumpet made it on the final ballot in the Best Fanzine category for science fiction's Hugo Award. In the late 1960s Reamy also organized and became chairman of Dallas fandom's long-running \\"Big D in '73\\" bid to host the 31st World Science Fiction Convention. He also edited and designed the bid's official publication, The Dallascon Bulletin, which, like Trumpet, used photo-offset printing. Nothing like them had been produced by previous Worldcon bidders. Each issue's appearance polarized strong support for or against the Texas bid, due to its widespread, free circulation to 6000+, and the large amount of paid advertising each issue carried. As a result, the Texans were sometimes accused of trying to buy a win for the Dallas bid. Ultimately, the long-running Dallascon bid collapsed for complex reasons unrelated to this controversy, several months before 1973's site-selection vote was taken at Noreascon, the 1971 Worldcon in Boston. As a result, the Toronto bid won the 31st Worldcon, becoming Torcon II. Early in the 1970s, Reamy became one of the founders of the Dallas area's Turkey City Writer's Workshop. Many new Texas genre writers emerged from this workshop, eventually giving birth in 1976 to the all-Texas original speculative fiction hardcover anthology, Lone Star Universe; the workshop continues to this day. Reamy's high-profile Worldcon bid in science fiction fandom and its Dallascon Bulletin had a lasting impact: These and Reamy's ten issues of Trumpet inspired the formation on July 3, 1971 of the still-ongoing Kansas City Science Fiction and Fantasy Society (KaCSFFS) and several year's later, Kansas City's bid for the 1976 Worldcon. Many of Dallas' \\"Big Bid\\" concepts were adopted by KC and used in its multi-level bidding strategy. Reamy joined the KC bid at chairman Ken Keller's request, shortly before their victory in 1974, filling two key department head positions on the convention committee. The ill-fated \\"Big D in '73\\" bid was reborn in Kansas City as \\"KC in '76.\\" Kansas City went on to win their Worldcon bid at Discon 2, held during Labor Day weekend 1974. Following his move to KC in the late summer of 1974, Reamy retired Trumpet and began publishing the similar Nickelodeon. There, with new business partner Ken Keller, he started a typesetting and graphic design business, Nickelodeon Graphics Arts Service. Together, they created the publications division for KC's now official MidAmeriCon, the 34th World Science Fiction Convention. Reamy immediately established a strong editorial style and modern graphic design approach to the convention's progress reports and other publications. That included a first: a full-sized, hardcover program book, a concept left over from the old Dallascon bid. All of this had a permanent influence on all Worldcon publications that followed. Reamy was also the department head of the convention's ambitious film program department that developed another first: a comprehensive, 80-hour, all 35mm science fiction film retrospective within a World Science Fiction Convention. The concept included a movie theater-style concessions area that offered freshly popped popcorn, selections of soda, and candies.  Published writer  In the early 1970s, having honed his writing craft quietly for many years, Reamy felt confident enough to begin submitting his fiction to the genre's magazines and original short story anthologies; his work began selling almost immediately, the first two stories on the very same day. Thirteen stories of various lengths and one novel were completed before his untimely death. Reamy's only novel Blind Voices, published posthumously in both hardcover and mass-market paperback editions, earned critical comparisons with the works of Richard Matheson, Ray Bradbury, and Harlan Ellison. The novel deals with the arrival of a strange and wonderful ‚Äúfreak show‚Äù at a rural town in Kansas during the 1920s and its effects on the lives of the residents. While not quite as polished as those authors‚Äô works (there was some question as to whether Reamy intended another draft of the novel, at least), critics regarded Blind Voices as an exceptional first novel, causing both fans and critics to ponder how important a figure he could have become if he had lived. Other than Blind Voices, the only other Tom Reamy book is a posthumous collection of his shorter fiction, San Diego Lightfoot Sue and Other Stories, also published in both hardcover and mass-market paperback (with an introduction by Harlan Ellison). \\"San Diego Lightfoot Sue,\\" the individual story, won the 1975 Nebula Award for Best Novelette, and was a finalist for the 1976 Hugo Award for Best Novelette. Only one original, 17,000-word Reamy story remains unpublished after all this time: the novella \\"Potiphee, Petey and Me\\" was sold to Harlan Ellison for his now infamous Last Dangerous Visions original anthology and was supposed to have been published in the third and final volume of that series; the anthology never appeared in Ellison's lifetime.  Death  Tom Reamy died on November 4, 1977Tom Reamy, Find a Grave. at age 42 while at his home in Independence, Missouri. He was found dead from a heart attack, slumped over his typewriter seven pages into a new, untitled story for editor Edward L. Ferman at The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction. He was laid to rest in Woodson Cemetery in Woodson, Texas, where other members of the Reamy family were interred. Prior to his death, Reamy and artist George Barr had begun working again on their graphic novel adaptation of Poul Anderson's fantasy novel The Broken Sword, which had begun appearing a decade before in the pages of Reamy's Trumpet; the project languished after his untimely death.

Most popular graphing calculators are also programmable and therefore considered to be programmable calculators, allowing the user to create customized programs, typically for scientific, engineering and education applications. Because they have large displays in comparison to standard four-operation handheld calculators, graphing calculators also typically display several lines of text and calculations at the same time.  History  Casio fx-7000G; The world's first graphing calculator An early \\"graphical calculator\\" was designed and patented by electrical engineer, Edith Clarke, in 1925. The calculator was used to solve problems with electrical power line transmission. Casio produced the first commercially available graphing calculator, the fx-7000G, in 1985. Casio's innovations include an icon menu for easy access to functions (1994, FX-7700GE and later), graphing in several colors (1995, CFX-9800G), textbook-like \\"Natural Display\\" input and output (2004, FX-82ES/300ES & FX-9860G), expandable memory (2005, FX-9860SD), backlit screen (2006, FX-9860G Slim), full-color, high resolution backlit screen (2010, FX-CG10/CG20 PRIZM). Sharp produced its first graphing calculator, the EL-5200, in 1986. Since then Sharp's innovations include models with a touchscreen (EL9600 series), Equation Editor (textbook-like input) (EL-9300 ( 1992 ) and later), and reversible keyboard to ease learning (one side has basic functions, the other side has additional functions) (March 2005, EL-9900). Hewlett Packard followed in the form of the HP-28C. This was followed by the HP-28S (1988), HP-48SX (1990), HP-48S (1991), and many other models. Models like the HP 50g (2006) or the HP Prime (2013) feature a computer algebra system (CAS) capable of manipulating symbolic expressions and analytic solving. An unusual and powerful CAS \\"calculator\\" is the now obsolete year 2001 Casio Cassiopeia A-10 and A-11 (flip top) stylus-operated PDAs, which ran the Maple V symbolic engine. The HP-28 and -48 ranges were primarily meant for the professional science/engineering markets; the HP-38/39/40 were sold in the high school/college educational market; while the HP-49 series cater to both educational and professional customers of all levels. The HP series of graphing calculators is best known for its Reverse Polish notation (RPN) / Reverse Polish Lisp (RPL) interface, although the HP-49G introduced a standard expression entry interface as well. Texas Instruments has produced graphing calculators since 1990, the first of which was the TI-81. Some of the newer calculators are similar, with the addition of more memory, faster processors, and USB connection such as the TI-82, TI-83 series, and TI-84 series. Other models, designed to be appropriate for students 10‚Äì14 years of age, are the TI-80 and TI-73. Other TI graphing calculators have been designed to be appropriate for calculus, namely the TI-85, TI-86, TI-89 series, and TI-92 series (TI-92, TI-92 Plus, and Voyage 200). TI offers a CAS on the TI-89, TI-Nspire CAS and TI-92 series of calculators. TI calculators are targeted specifically to the educational market, but are also widely available to the general public.  Features  = Computer algebra systems = Some graphing calculators have a computer algebra system (CAS), which means that they are capable of producing symbolic results. These calculators can manipulate algebraic expressions, performing operations such as factor, expand, and simplify. In addition, they can give answers in exact form without numerical approximations. Calculators that have a computer algebra system are called symbolic or CAS calculators. Examples of symbolic calculators include the HP 50g, the HP Prime, the TI-89, the TI-Nspire CAS and TI-Nspire CX CAS and the Casio ClassPad series. = Laboratory usage = Many graphing calculators can be attached to devices like electronic thermometers, pH gauges, weather instruments, decibel and light meters, accelerometers, and other sensors and therefore function as data loggers, as well as WiFi or other communication modules for monitoring, polling and interaction with the teacher. Student laboratory exercises with data from such devices enhances learning of math, especially statistics and mechanics. =Games and utilities= alt=The game Graphing calculators are sometimes used for gaming. Since graphing calculators are typically user-programmable, they are also widely used for utilities and calculator gaming, with a sizable body of user- created game software on most popular platforms. The ability to create games and utilities has spurred the creation of calculator application sites (e.g., Cemetech) which, in some cases, may offer programs created using calculators' assembly language. Even though handheld gaming devices fall in a similar price range, graphing calculators offer superior math programming capability for math based games. However, for developers and advanced users like researchers, analysts and gamers, third party software development involving firmware modifications, whether for powerful gaming or exploiting capabilities beyond the published data sheet and programming language, is a contentious issue with manufacturers and education authorities as it might incite unfair calculator use during standardized high school and college tests where these devices are targeted. Nowadays graduate (Masters) students and researchers have turned to advanced Computer Aided Math software for learning as well as experimenting.  Graphing calculators in education  TI-89 Titanium, capable of doing Symbolic Manipulation, Computer Algebra System (CAS) * North America ‚Äì high school mathematics teachers allow and even encourage their students to use graphing calculators in class. In some cases (especially in calculus courses) they are required. Some of them are disallowed in certain classes such as chemistry or physics due to their capacity to contain full periodic tables. * College Board of the United States ‚Äì permits the use of most graphing or CAS calculators that do not have a QWERTY-style keyboard for parts of its AP and SAT exams, but the ACT exam and IB schools do not permit the use of calculators with computer algebra systems. * United Kingdom ‚Äì a graphing calculator is allowed for A-level maths courses, however they are not required and the exams are designed to be broadly 'calculator neutral'. Similarly, at GCSE, all current courses include one paper where no calculator of any kind can be used, but students are permitted to use graphical calculators for other papers. The use of graphical calculators at GCSE is not widespread with cost being a likely factor. The use of CAS is not allowed for either A-level or GCSE. General, Vocational and Diploma Qualifications Instructions for conducting examinations. The Scottish SQA allows the use of graphic calculators in maths exams (excluding paper 1, which is exclusively non- calculator), however these should either be checked before exams by invigilators or handed out by the exam centre, as certain functions / information is not allowed to be stored on a calculator in the exam. SQA exams do not favour a graphic calculator, and since working must be shown for full marks, do not give a significant advantage over candidates who do not use them. * Finland and Slovenia ‚Äì and certain other countries, it is forbidden to use calculators with symbolic calculation (CAS) or 3D graphics features in the matriculation exam. This changed in the case of Finland, however, as symbolic calculators were allowed from spring 2012 onwards. * Norway ‚Äì calculators with wireless communication capabilities, such as IR links, have been banned at some technical universities. * Australia ‚Äì policies vary from state to state. ** Victoria ‚Äì the VCE specifies approved calculators as applicable for its mathematics exams. For Further Mathematics an approved graphics calculator (for example TI-83/84, Casio 9860, HP-39G) or CAS (for example TI-89, the ClassPad series, HP-40G) can be used. Mathematical Methods (CAS) has a technology free examination consisting of short answer and some extended answer questions. It then also has a technology-active examination consisting of extended response and multiple choice questions: a CAS is the assumed technology for Mathematical Methods (CAS). Specialist Mathematics has a technology free examination and a technology-active examination where either an approved graphics calculator or CAS may be used. Calculator memories are not required to be cleared. In subjects like Physics and Chemistry, students are only allowed a standard scientific calculator. ** Western Australia ‚Äì all tertiary entrance examinations in Mathematics involve a calculator section which assume the student has a graphics calculator; CAS enabled calculators are also permitted. In subjects such as Physics, Chemistry and Accounting only non-programmable calculators are permitted.http://www.curriculum.wa.edu.au/internet/_Documents/Policy/Calculators_use_in_the_WACE_examinations_2010_pdf.pdf Calculator use in the 2011 WACE examinations ** New South Wales ‚Äì graphics calculators are allowed for the General Mathematics Higher School Certificate exam, but disallowed in the higher level Mathematics courses. * China - Only the Shanghai College Entrance Examination allows the use of calculators without graphing and memory.

Most students use the TI-83 Plus or TI-84 Plus, but other graphing calculators are allowed, including the Casio fx-9860G and HP-39G. Graphing calculators are almost always allowed to be used during tests instead of normal calculators, which sometimes results in cheat sheets being made on forehand and exchanged before the test starts using link cables. * Israel ‚Äì Graphing calculators are forbidden to use in the Bagrut (equivalent to the American SAT) math exam, in addition to programmable calculators.http://meyda.education.gov.il/sheeloney_bagrut/2012/1/HEB/35807.PDF The instructions for conducting the 5-point exam Bagrut in math, 2012 in Hebrew. University degree and diploma courses have their own rules on use and permitted models of calculators in exams.  Programming  Most graphing calculators, as well as some non-graphing scientific calculators and programmer's calculators can be programmed to automate complex and frequently used series of calculations and those inaccessible from the keyboard. The actual programming can often be done on a computer then later uploaded to the calculators. The most common tools for this include the PC link cable and software for the given calculator, configurable text editors or hex editors, and specialized programming tools such as the below-mentioned implementation of various languages on the computer side. Earlier calculators stored programs on magnetic cards and the like; increased memory capacity has made storage on the calculator the most common implementation. Some of the newer machines can also use memory cards. Many graphing and scientific calculators will tokenize the program text, replacing textual programming elements with short numerical tokens. For example, take this line of TI-BASIC code: \`Disp [A]\` . In a conventional programming language, this line of code would be nine characters long (eight not including a newline character). For a system as slow as a graphing calculator, this is too inefficient for an interpreted language. To increase program speed and coding efficiency, the above line of code would be only three characters. \\"Disp_\\" as a single character, \\"[A]\\" as a single character, and a newline character. This normally means that single byte chars will query the standard ASCII chart while two byte chars (the Disp_ for example) will build a graphical string of single byte characters but retain the two byte character in the program memory. Many graphical calculators work much like computers and use versions of 7-bit, 8-bit or 9-bit ASCII-derived character sets or even UTF-8 and Unicode. Many of them have a tool similar to the character map on Windows. They also have BASIC like functions such as chr$, chr, char, asc, and so on, which sometimes may be more Pascal or C like. One example may be use of ord, as in Pascal, instead of the asc of many Basic variants, to return the code of a character, i.e. the position of the character in the collating sequence of the machine. A cable and/or IrDA transceiver connecting the calculator to a computer make the process easier and expands other possibilities such as on-board spreadsheet, database, graphics, and word processing programs. The second option is being able to code the programs on board the calculator itself. This option is facilitated by the inclusion of full-screen text editors and other programming tools in the default feature set of the calculator or as optional items. Some calculators have QWERTY keyboards and others can be attached to an external keyboard which can be close to the size of a regular 102-key computer keyboard. Programming is a major use for the software and cables used to connect calculators to computers. The most common programming languages used for calculators are similar to keystroke-macro languages and variants of BASIC. The latter can have a large feature set‚Äîapproaching that of BASIC as found in computers‚Äîincluding character and string manipulation, advanced conditional and branching statements, sound, graphics, and more including, of course, the huge spectrum of mathematical, string, bit-manipulation, number base, I/O, and graphics functions built into the machine. Languages for programming calculators fall into all of the main groups, i.e. machine code, low-level, mid-level, high-level languages for systems and application programming, scripting, macro, and glue languages, procedural, functional, imperative &. object-oriented programming can be achieved in some cases. Most calculators capable to being connected to a computer can be programmed in assembly language and machine code, although on some calculators this is only possible through using exploits. The most common assembly and machine languages are for TMS9900, SH-3, Zilog Z80, and various Motorola chips (e.g. a modified 68000) which serve as the main processors of the machines although many (not all) are modified to some extent from their use elsewhere. Some manufacturers do not document and even mildly discourage the assembly language programming of their machines because they must be programmed in this way by putting together the program on the PC and then forcing it into the calculator by various improvised methods. Other on-board programming languages include purpose-made languages, variants of Eiffel, Forth, and Lisp, and Command Script facilities which are similar in function to batch/shell programming and other glue languages on computers but generally not as full featured. Ports of other languages like BBC BASIC and development of on-board interpreters for Fortran, REXX, AWK, Perl, Unix shells (e.g., bash, zsh), other shells (DOS/Windows 9x, OS/2, and Windows NT family shells as well as the related 4DOS, 4NT and 4OS2 as well as DCL), COBOL, C, Python, Tcl, Pascal, Delphi, ALGOL, and other languages are at various levels of development. Some calculators, especially those with other PDA-like functions have actual operating systems including the TI proprietary OS for its more recent machines, DOS, Windows CE, and rarely Windows NT 4.0 Embedded et seq, and Linux. Experiments with the TI-89, TI-92, TI-92 Plus and Voyage 200 machines show the possibility of installing some variants of other systems such as a chopped-down variant of CP/M-68K, an operating system which has been used for portable devices in the past. Tools which allow for programming the calculators in C/C++ and possibly Fortran and assembly language are used on the computer side, such as HPGCC, TIGCC and others. Flash memory is another means of conveyance of information to and from the calculator. The on-board BASIC variants in TI graphing calculators and the languages available on HP-48 type calculators can be used for rapid prototyping by developers, professors, and students, often when a computer is not close at hand. Most graphing calculators have on-board spreadsheets which usually integrate with Microsoft Excel on the computer side. At this time, spreadsheets with macro and other automation facilities on the calculator side are not on the market. In some cases, the list, matrix, and data grid facilities can be combined with the native programming language of the calculator to have the effect of a macro and scripting enabled spreadsheet.

He was honoured in 1988 with the Dadasaheb Phalke Award, the highest national award for cinema artists, by the Government of India and also received the Padma Bhushan in 1999 for his contributions to Indian cinema. He is considered to be one of India's finest actors ever, playing leading, antagonist and character roles with equal panache.  Background and family  Ashok Kumar was born Kumudlal Ganguly to a Bengali Hindu family in Bhagalpur, Bengal Presidency, British India (present-day Bihar, India). His father, Kunjlal Ganguly, was a lawyer while his mother, Gouri Devi, was a home-maker. Kumudlal was the eldest of four children. His only sister, Sati Devi, a few years younger to him, was married at a very young age to Sashadhar Mukherjee and became the matriarch of a large \\"film family\\". Next was his brother, Kalyan, more than 14 years younger (b.1926), who later took the screen name Anoop Kumar. Youngest of all was Abhas (b.1929), whose screen name was Kishore Kumar, who became a phenomenally successful playback singer of Hindi films. Although the eldest by several years, Kumudlal outlived all his siblings. In fact, he stopped celebrating his birthday after his youngest brother, Kishore, died on that very day in 1987. While still a teenager, and well before he had even given thought to a career in films, the young Kumudlal was married to Shobha, a girl of his own Bengali Brahmin community and similar family background, in a match arranged by their parents in the usual Indian way. Their lifelong marriage was a harmonious and conventional one, and despite his film career, the couple retained a very middle-class outlook and value system, bringing up their children with traditional values in a remarkably simple home. They were the parents of one son, Aroop Ganguly, and three daughters named Bharati Patel, Rupa Verma and Preeti Ganguly. Aroop Kumar Ganguly worked in only one film, appearing as hero in Bezubaan (1962), which flopped at the box office. He then made a career in the corporate world. The eldest daughter, Bharati Patel, is the mother of the actress Anuradha Patel. His second daughter, Rupa Verma, is the widow of the actor and comedian Deven Verma. The youngest daughter, Preeti Ganguly, was the only one among his daughters to enter the film industry. She acted as a comedienne in several Hindi films during the 1970s and 1980s, and died unmarried in 2012. Kumudlal's daughter Bharati married twice. Her first marriage was to a Mr. Patel, a Gujarati gentleman. By this marriage, she had one daughter, the actress Anuradha Patel, who is married to the actor Kanwaljeet Singh. Later, and much against the wishes of all her relatives, Bharati married Hameed Jaffrey, a Muslim, the brother of the actor Saeed Jaffrey. By this second marriage, Bharati also acquired step-daughters, Genevi√®ve and Shaheen, who were Hameed's daughters by his first wife Valerie Salway, a woman of Scottish, Irish, Portuguese and Italian heritage. Genevi√®ve married a Sindhi businessman named Jagdeep Advani. Their daughter is actress Kiara Advani. Thus, Ashok Kumar has no blood relationship with Kiara Advani and she is not his great-granddaughter, as is sometimes rumoured.  Early years  Reverently called Dadamoni (affectionate term for elder brother), Kumudlal Ganguly was born in Bhagalpur and educated at Presidency College of the University of Calcutta, Kolkata, where he studied to become a lawyer. However, his heart was not in his law studies. Ganguly was more interested in cinema, in which he dreamt of working as a technician. Career & Life =Early career (1936‚Äì42)= Kumudlal's father wanted him to become a lawyer and got him enrolled in a law college. However, Kumudlal failed his exams and, to escape acrimony at home, came to live with his sister in Mumbai for a few months, until the exams were held again. Kumudlal's sister Sati Devi had been married at a very young age to Sashadhar Mukherjee, who lived in Chembur in Mumbai and worked in a fairly senior position in the technical department of Bombay Talkies, a pioneering Indian film studio. Kumudlal wanted to earn some spending money for himself, and at his request, Sashadhar Mukherjee used his influence to get him a job as laboratory assistant at Bombay Talkies. This was in the early 1930s. The salary was quite decent; furthermore, Kumudlal was successful at his job and found the work interesting, which had not been the case with law college. He tried to convince his father that he would not become successful as a lawyer and that he would be able to earn a living as a technician or lab assistant. His father would not hear of this, and it required the intervention of Sashadhar Mukherjee before he finally reconciled himself to the situation and agreed to let Kumudlal abandon his law studies. Thus began the storied film career, not as an actor but as laboratory assistant, of the future Ashok Kumar. Kumar in Naya Sansar (1941) Kumudlal was happy working as a laboratory assistant and remained in that position for some five years. His acting career started purely by accident. Shooting was already underway on the Bombay Talkies production Jeevan Naiya in 1936, when the male lead, Najm-ul-Hassan, eloped with his co-star Devika Rani, who happened to be the wife of Himanshu Rai, millionaire owner of Bombay Talkies. Rani subsequently returned to her husband who, out of spite, dismissed Hassan and summarily ordered Kumudlal to replace him. This he did against the advice of director Franz Osten, who reckoned that the young man did not have the good looks needed for an actor. Kumudlal was given the screen name Ashok Kumar, in keeping with the general trend in an era when actors concealed their real identities behind screen names. With Devika Rani in Achhut Kanya (1936) Ashok Kumar, as Kumudlal Ganguly was now known, started off his acting career reluctantly. His subsequent venture with Devika Rani in Achhut Kanya, the same year was one of the early blockbusters of Hindi cinema. Like several movies of that era, Achhut Kanya was a reformist piece featuring a Brahmin boy falling in love with a girl from the so-called untouchables in Indian society. The runaway success of Achhut Kanya cemented Ashok Kumar and Devika Rani as the most popular on-screen couple of that era. The two did a string of films thereafter, including Janmabhoomi (1936), Izzat (1937), Savitri (1937), Vachan (1938) and Nirmala (1938). Their last on-screen venture was the 1941 movie Anjaan, whose failure at the box office brought an end to the legendary on- screen couple. Devika Rani was consistently the bigger star, with Ashok Kumar working in her shadow. He started emerging from Devika Rani's shadow owing to pairing opposite Leela Chitnis, another actress who was senior to him in age as well as stature. Back-to-back successes with Kangan (1939), Bandhan (1940) and Azad (1940) saw Ashok Kumar emerge as a popular actor in his own right. The success of Jhoola (1941), in which he starred opposite Leela Chitnis, established him as one of the most bankable actors of the era. = Stardom (1943‚Äì50) = Ashok Kumar in the 1943 film Kismet. The Gyan Mukherjee directed 1943 movie Kismet, featuring Ashok Kumar as the first anti-hero in Indian Cinema smashed all existing box office records, becoming the first Hindi movie to gross 1 crore at the box office. The success of Kismet made Ashok Kumar the first superstar of Indian cinema. Such was his popularity at the time that, in the words of Manto, \\"Ashok's popularity grew each passing day. He seldom ventured out, but wherever he was spotted, he was mobbed. Traffic would come to a stop and often the police would have to use lathis to disperse his fans.\\"Stars from Another Sky by Saadat Hassan Manto Sumitra Devi in Mashaal (1950) After Kismet, Ashok Kumar became the most bankable star of the era, delivering a succession of box office successes with movies such as Chal Chal Re Naujawan (1944), Shikari (1946), Sajan (1947), Mahal (1949), Mashaal (1950), Sangram (1950) and Samadhi (1950). He produced several films for Bombay Talkies during the final years of the company including Ziddi (1948), which established the careers of Dev Anand and Pran, Neelkamal (1947), which marked the debut of Raj Kapoor, and the famous Mahal in 1949 in which he co- starred with Madhubala. = Post-stardom (1950s) = With the advent of the 1950s, Ashok Kumar switched over to more mature roles, with the exception of the 1958 classic Howrah Bridge. Despite the arrival of a younger crop of stars like Dev Anand, Dilip Kumar and Raj Kapoor, Ashok Kumar remained one of the stars of the era with hits like Afsana (1951), Nau Bahar (1952), Parineeta (1953), Bandish (1955) and EK Hi Raasta (1956). His most successful film of that era was Deedar (1951), in which he played second lead to Dilip Kumar. with Meena Kumari in Parineeta. Ashok Kumar appeared frequently opposite Nalini Jaywant in several movies of the 1950s. He did around 17 films with Meena Kumari in a span of twenty years ranging from Tamasha in 1952 to 1972 magnum opus, Pakeezah. He played the suave cigarette-smoking criminal or police officer in several films in the mid to late 1950s, in what was the Indian film-noir movement. = Later Career (1960s & 1970s) = By the 1960s, Ashok Kumar switched over to character roles, variously playing the parent, uncle or grandparent, being careful never to be typecast. From a judge in Kanoon (1960), an aging freedom fighter in Bandini (1963), an aging priest in Chitralekha (1964), a vicious zamindar in Jawaab (1970) and a criminal in Victoria 203 (1971), he played a wide variety of roles. Ashok Kumar played important roles in several landmark movies in the 1960s and 1970s, including Jewel Thief (1967), Aashirwad (1968) (for which he won a Filmfare Award as well as National Award in 1969), Purab aur Pashchim (1970), Pakeezah (1972), Mili (1975), Chhoti Si Baat (1975) and Khoobsurat (1980). Ashok Kumar and Pran were best friends and have acted in 27 films together from 1951-1987 and had 20 super-hit films together. Films like Purab Aur Pashchim, Victoria 203, Chor Ke Ghar Chor, Chori Mera Kaam, Adhikar (1971), Maan Gaye Ustad were major hits. He teamed up with Shashi Kapoor and Rajesh Khanna in many films in 1970s and 1980s and acted as the main supporting actor in their films.  Last years and death  He acted in fewer films in the 1980s and 1990s, and occasionally appeared on television, most famously anchoring the first Indian soap opera Hum Log and appearing as the title character in the unforgettable Bahadur Shah Zafar. Ashok Kumar's last film role was in the 1997 movie Aankhon Mein Tum Ho. Besides acting, he was an avid painter and a practitioner of homeopathy. A qualified homoeopath, Ashok Kumar earned a reputation for conjuring up miracle cures.The Tribune ‚Äì Windows ‚Äì Main Feature-Breathing new life into samadhis by Roopinder Singh . Tribuneindia.com (15 December 2001). Retrieved on 2018-11-09. Altogether, he starred in over 275 films. He has done more than 30 Bengali dramas in Dhakuria. Ashok Kumar died at the age of 90 in Mumbai on 10 December 2001 of heart failure at his residence in Chembur. The then Prime Minister Atal Bihari Vajpayee described him as \\"an inspiration... for many generations of aspiring actors.\\"  Legacy  Kumar on a 2013 stamp of India Ashok Kumar is widely regarded as a pioneering actor who introduced natural acting to Hindi cinema. He was the first superstar of Hindi cinema as well as the first lead actor to play an anti-hero. He also became the first star to reinvent himself, enjoying a long and hugely successful career as a character actor. Ashok Kumar is also credited with mentoring several personalities who went on to make significant contributions to Indian cinema. As producer with Bombay Talkies, Ashok Kumar gave Dev Anand his first break in Ziddi (1948), which also established Pran (then a struggling actor who had just fled to India during partition), as one of the leading villains of the era. The 1949 film Mahal, starring Ashok Kumar and made under his watch at Bombay Talkies launched the career of Madhubala, one of the leading actresses of the 1950s. The legendary song \\"Aayega Aanewala\\" from Mahal was the turning point in the career of a hitherto little known young singer called Lata Mangeshkar. Off the screen, Ashok Kumar gave B.R. Chopra, then a film critic and unsuccessful filmmaker, his first break as director with the 1951 film Afsana. The success of Afsana established Chopra as a respected filmmaker. Ashok Kumar also played mentor to his assistant at Bombay Talkies, Hrishikesh Mukherjee, who went on to become one of the great directors of Hindi cinema. He was the lucky mascot for a promising young director called Shakti Samanta in the late 1950s, delivering a series of hits with Inspector (1956), Howrah Bridge (1958) and Detective (1958) which helped the young man establish himself as a successful director. Shakti Samanta would go on to deliver several movies in the 1960s and 1970s which are regarded today as classics. Ashok Kumar also paved the way for his younger brothers Kalyan (Anoop) and Kishore Kumar. While Anoop is best remembered for his role in Chalti Ka Naam Gaadi (1958), Kishore went on to become a legendary singer. Arguably, Kishore is today the most popular of the brothers. The distinctive style and mannerisms that Ashok Kumar adopted in his late career still remain extremely popular among mimicry artists.

After the Nazis seized power in 1933, Braun went into exile in Switzerland. German Empire Born in K√∂nigsberg, East Prussia, as the son of a railway employee, Braun attended Volksschule and completed an apprenticeship in lithography. In 1888, he joined the Social Democratic Party, which was then illegal. He advanced in the typical manner for a local functionary: chairman of the local Arbeiter-Wahlvereins, the legal front of the party, and later publisher, editor and printer of the party newspaper Volkstrib√ºne (later K√∂nigsberger Volkszeitung). In 1904, he was one of several Social Democrats charged with high treason for smuggling pamphlets calling for the toppling of the Russia tsar but was not found guilty because of inconclusive evidence. Braun was active in supporting the rights of farm labourers in East Prussia, which was dominated by large landowners. From 1909 to 1920, he was a member of the board of the Deutscher Landarbeiter-Verband, a farmworker association, which he had cofounded. He also became an expert on agricultural issues within his party. Braun rose to chairman of the East Prussian Social Democratic Party, became in 1911 a member of the board of the national party and in 1913 was elected to the Prussian House of Representatives. During World War I, he supported the Burgfriedenspolitik policy of the majority SPD. His only child died in the war; his son had volunteered for service and died of diphteria in 1915. Weimar Republic After the German Revolution, Braun became Prussian Minister for Agriculture. In 1919, he was elected to the Weimar National Assembly. Following the abortive Kapp-L√ºttwitz Putsch in March 1920, Braun became Minister President of Prussia, a position in which he served from 1920 and 1932 except for brief periods in 1921 and 1925. He also held a seat in the Prussian Landtag (1913‚Äì33) and in the Reichstag (1920‚Äì33). He was the Social Democratic presidential candidate in the first round of presidential elections in 1925 and came second. He withdrew his candidacy during the runoff to help the Centre Party's Wilhelm Marx defeat Paul von Hindenburg, who had not stood in the first round. Marx was eventually defeated by Hindenburg. Prussian Prime Minister Otto Braun (left) in 1925 Braun's coalition government was based on the SPD, the Centre Party and the German Democratic Party (until 1924 also the German People's Party). It was one of the strongest democratic bastions of the Weimar Republic, as Braun worked closely with his Ministers of the Interior, Carl Severing and Albert Grzesinski. During his tenure, the Prussian government enacted a partial land reform and a school reform. Prussia became a modern free state based on civil servants and security forces who felt loyal to the new republican state. Braun managed to introduce a temporary nationwide ban on the Nazi-Sturmabteilung. However, those policies resulted in the enmity of the far right and the communists. He was not a social revolutionary, says Holborn, but was \\"a determined democratic reformer\\" and a shrewd coalition builder. In the April 1932 Prussian elections, Braun's government lost its majority. Under the Prussian constitution, an incumbent government could not be deposed unless a prospective successor already commanded a majority. That measure, the constructive vote of no confidence, was intended to ensure that a government had sufficient support to govern. Neither of the other major parties, the Communist Party (KPD) and the National Socialist Party (NSDAP), would support the governing coalition. However, neither of them could muster sufficient support to form government in their own right. The Communists and Nazis would not consider working with each other. Thus, Braun's coalition remained in office as a caretaker minority government. Braun's government was deposed in the Preu√üenschlag of July 1932, when Reich Chancellor Franz von Papen, himself governing without a parliamentary majority, assumed direct control of Prussia's administration as Reichskommissar (commissioner). Braun, however, remained de jure prime minister and continued to represent the state of Prussia in the Reichsrat until January 1933, when Papen became prime minister for two months. Hermann G√∂ring then held the office until 1945. As an opponent of the Nazi regime, Braun decided to leave Germany and emigrated to Switzerland after Adolf Hitler became chancellor in January 1933. Braun's wife, Emilie, was terminally ill, and he followed her to Ascona on 4 April 1933 after she had been warned of his imminent arrest. Later life At the end of the Second World War, Braun approached the Allies to reinstate the previous democratic Prussian government, but they were not receptive to his proposition because they had decided to abolish Prussia and to divide its eastern part between Poland and the Soviet Union. Braun died in exile in Locarno in 1955.

She made her film debut in the Australian drama For Love Alone (1986) and then appeared in the Australian television series Hey Dad..! (1990), Brides of Christ (1991), Home and Away (1991), and the film Flirting (1991). After moving to the United States, Watts struggled as an actress for years, with appearances in small-scale films. Watts rose to international prominence for playing an aspiring actress in David Lynch's psychological thriller Mulholland Drive (2001) and a tormented journalist in the horror remake The Ring (2002). She received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actress for her performance as a grief-stricken mother in Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu's film 21 Grams (2003). Her profile continued to grow with starring roles in I Heart Huckabees (2004), King Kong (2005), Eastern Promises (2007), and The International (2009). For her role as Maria Bennett in the disaster film The Impossible (2012), Watts received another Academy Award nomination for Best Actress. In the 2010s, she starred in such films as Birdman (2014), St. Vincent (2014), While We're Young (2015), The Glass Castle (2017), and Luce (2019). Watts also continued to act in blockbusters, with appearances in the Divergent franchise (2015‚Äì2016), and ventured into television with the Showtime mystery drama series Twin Peaks (2017) and the biographical limited series The Loudest Voice (2019). Watts is particularly known for her work in remakes and independent productions with dark or tragic themes, as well as portrayals of characters that endure loss or suffering. Magazines such as People and Maxim have included her on their lists of the world's most beautiful women. She has been an ambassador for Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS and Pantene's Beautiful Lengths. Despite significant media attention, Watts is reticent about her personal life. She had a relationship with American actor Liev Schreiber from 2005 to 2016, with whom she has two sons. Early life Naomi Ellen Watts was born on 28 September 1968, in Shoreham, Kent, England. She is the daughter of Myfanwy (Miv) Edwards (n√©e) Roberts), an antiques dealer and costume and set designer, and Peter Watts (1946‚Äì1976), a road manager and sound engineer who worked with Pink Floyd.Stated on Inside the Actors Studio, 2003. Miv was born in England but lived in Australia between the ages of one and seven. Watts's maternal grandfather was Welsh and her maternal grandmother was Australian. Watts's parents divorced when she was four years old. After the divorce, Watts and her elder brother, Ben Watts, moved several times across South East England with their mother. Peter Watts left Pink Floyd in 1974, and remarried in 1976. In August 1976, he was found dead in a flat in Notting Hill, of an apparent heroin overdose. Following his death, Watts's mother moved the family to Llanfawr Farm in Llangefni and Llanfairpwllgwyngyll, towns on the island of Anglesey in North Wales, where they lived with Watts's maternal grandparents, Nikki and Hugh Roberts, for three years. During this time, Watts attended a Welsh language school, Ysgol Gyfun Llangefni. She later said of her time in Wales: \\"We took Welsh lessons in a school in the middle of nowhere while everyone else was taking English. Wherever we moved, I would adapt and pick up the regional accent. It's obviously significant now, me being an actress. Anyway, there was quite a lot of sadness in my childhood, but no lack of love.\\" In 1978, her mother remarried (though she would later be divorced again) and Watts and her brother then moved to Suffolk, where she attended Thomas Mills High School. Watts has stated that she wanted to become an actress after seeing her mother performing on stage and from the time she watched the 1980 film Fame. In 1982, when Watts was 14, she moved to Sydney in Australia with her mother, brother and stepfather. Myfanwy established a career in the burgeoning film business, working as a stylist for television commercials, then turning to costume design, ultimately working for the soap opera Return to Eden. After emigrating, Watts was enrolled in acting lessons by her mother; she auditioned for numerous television advertisements, where she met and befriended actress Nicole Kidman. Watts obtained her first role in the 1986 drama film, For Love Alone, based on the novel of the same name by Christina Stead, and produced by Margaret Fink. In Australia, Watts attended Mosman High School and North Sydney Girls High School. She failed to graduate from school, afterwards working as a papergirl, a negative cutter and managing a Delicacies store in Sydney's affluent North Shore. She decided to become a model when she was 18. She signed with a models agency that sent her to Japan, but after several failed auditions, she returned to Sydney. There, she was hired to work in advertising for a department store, that exposed her to the attention of Follow Me, a magazine which hired her as an assistant fashion editor. A casual invitation to participate in a drama workshop inspired Watts to quit her job and to pursue her acting ambitions. Regarding her nationality, Watts has stated: \\"I consider myself British and have very happy memories of the UK. I spent the first 14 years of my life in England and Wales and never wanted to leave. When I was in Australia I went back to England a lot.\\" She also has expressed her ties to Australia, declaring: \\"I consider myself very connected to Australia, in fact when people say where is home, I say Australia, because those are my most powerful memories.\\" Career =Early roles and struggling career (1986‚Äì2000)= Watts's career began in television, where she made brief appearances in commercials. The 1986 film For Love Alone, set in the 1930s and based on Christina Stead's 1945 best-selling novel of the same name, marked her debut in film. She then appeared in two episodes of the fourth season of the Australian sitcom Hey Dad..! in 1990. After a five-year absence from films, Watts met director John Duigan during the 1989 premiere of her friend Nicole Kidman's film Dead Calm and he invited her to take a supporting role in his 1991 indie film Flirting. The film received critical acclaim and was featured on Roger Ebert's list of the 10 best films of 1992. Also in 1991, she took the part of Frances Heffernan, a girl who struggles to find friends behind the walls of a Sydney Catholic school, in the award- winning mini-series Brides of Christ and had a recurring role in the soap opera Home and Away as the handicapped Julie Gibson. Watts was then offered a role in the drama series A Country Practice but turned it down, not wanting to \\"get stuck on a soap for two or three years\\", a decision she later called \\"na√Øve\\". Watts then took a year off to travel, visiting Los Angeles and being introduced to agents through Kidman. Encouraged, Watts decided to move to America, to pursue her career further. In 1993 she had a small role in the John Goodman film Matinee and temporarily returned to Australia to star in three Australian films: another of Duigan's pictures, Wide Sargasso Sea; the drama The Custodian; and had her first leading role in the film Gross Misconduct, as a student who accuses one of her teachers (played by Jimmy Smits) of raping her. Watts then moved back to America for good but the difficulty of finding agents, producers and directors willing to hire her during that period frustrated her initial efforts. Though her financial situation never led her to taking a job out of the film industry, she experienced problems like being unable to pay the rent of her apartment and losing her medical insurance. \\"At first, everything was fantastic and doors were opened to me. But some people who I met through Nicole [Kidman], who had been all over me, had difficulty remembering my name when we next met. There were a lot of promises, but nothing actually came off. I ran out of money and became quite lonely, but Nic gave me company and encouragement to carry on.\\" She then won a supporting role in the futuristic 1995 film Tank Girl, winning the role of \\"Jet Girl\\" after nine auditions. The film was met with mixed reviews and flopped at the box office, although it has gone on to become something of a cult classic. Throughout the rest of the decade, she took mostly supporting roles in films and occasionally considered leaving the business, but: \\"there were always little bites. Whenever I felt I was at the end of my rope, something would come up. Something bad. But for me it was 'work begets work'; that was my motto.\\" In 1996, she starred alongside Joe Mantegna, Kelly Lynch and J.T. Walsh in George Hickenlooper's action-thriller Persons Unknown; alongside James Earl Jones, Kevin Kilner and Ellen Burstyn in the period drama Timepiece; in Bermuda Triangle, a TV pilot that was not picked up for a full series, where she played a former documentary filmmaker who disappears in the Bermuda Triangle; and as the lead role in Children of the Corn IV: The Gathering, in which children in a small town become possessed under the command of a wrongfully murdered child preacher. In 1997, she starred in the Australian ensemble romantic drama Under the Lighthouse Dancing starring Jack Thompson and Jacqueline McKenzie. She also played the lead role in the short-lived television series Sleepwalkers. In 1998, she starred alongside Neil Patrick Harris and Debbie Reynolds in the TV film The Christmas Wish, played the supporting role of Giulia De Lezze in Dangerous Beauty, and provided some voice work for Babe: Pig in the City. She said in an interview in 2012, \\"That really should not be on my r√©sum√©! I think that was early on in the day, when I was trying to beef up my r√©sum√©. I came in and did a couple days' work of voiceovers and we had to suck on [helium] and then do a little mouse voice. But I was one in a hundred, so I'm sure you would never be able to identify my voice. I probably couldn't either!\\" In 1999, she played Alice in the romantic comedy Strange Planet and the Texan student Holly Maddux in The Hunt for the Unicorn Killer, which was based on the real life effort to capture Ira Einhorn, who was charged with Maddux's murder. In 2000, while David Lynch was expanding the rejected pilot of Mulholland Drive into a feature film, Watts starred alongside Derek Jacobi, Jack Davenport and Iain Glen in the BBC TV film The Wyvern Mystery, an adaptation of the novel of the same name by Sheridan Le Fanu that was broadcast in March of that year. Much of her early career is filled with near misses in casting, as she was up for significant roles in films such as 1997's The Postman and The Devil's Advocate and 2000's Meet the Parents, which eventually went to other actresses. In an interview in 2012, Watts said, \\"I came to New York and auditioned at least five times for Meet the Parents. I think the director liked me but the studio didn't. I heard every piece of feedback you could imagine, and in this case, it was 'not sexy enough'.\\" Watts recalled her early career in an interview in 2002, saying, \\"It is a tough town. I think my spirit has taken a beating. The most painful thing has been the endless auditions. Knowing that you have something to offer, but not being able to show it, is so frustrating. As an unknown, you get treated badly. I auditioned and waited for things I did not have any belief in, but I needed the work and had to accept horrendous pieces of shit.\\" Watts studied the Meisner Technique. =Rise to fame (2001‚Äì2002)= Watts with filmmaker David Lynch at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival In 1999, director David Lynch began casting for his psychological thriller Mulholland Drive. He interviewed Watts after looking at her headshot, without having seen any of her previous work, and offered her the lead role. Lynch later said about his selection of Watts, \\"I saw someone that I felt had a tremendous talent, and I saw someone who had a beautiful soul, an intelligence‚Äîpossibilities for a lot of different roles, so it was a beautiful full package.\\" Conceived as a pilot for a television series, Lynch shot a large portion of it in February 1999, planning to keep it open-ended for a potential series. However, the pilot was rejected. Watts recalled thinking at the time, \\"just my dumb luck, that I'm in the only David Lynch programme that never sees the light of day.\\" Instead, Lynch filmed an ending in October 2000, turning it into a feature film which was picked up for distribution. The film, which also starred Laura Harring and Justin Theroux, was highly acclaimed by critics and would become Watts's breakthrough. She was praised by critics, including Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian, who said, \\"Watts's face metamorphoses miraculously from fresh-faced beauty to a frenzied, teary scowl of ugliness.\\" and Emanuel Levy, who wrote, \\"... Naomi Watts, in a brilliant performance, a young, wide-eyed and grotesquely cheerful blonde, full of high hopes to make it big in Hollywood.\\" The film premiered at the 2001 Cannes Film Festival and received a large number of awards and nominations, including the Best Actress Award for Watts from the National Society of Film Critics and a nomination for Best Actress from the American Film Institute. The surrealist film following the story of the aspiring actress Betty Elms, played by Watts, attracted controversy with its strong lesbian theme. Also in 2001, she starred in two short films, Never Date an Actress and Ellie Parker, and the horror film The Shaft, director Dick Maas' remake of his 1983 film De Lift. In 2002, she starred in one of the biggest box office hits of that year, The Ring, the English language remake of the Japanese horror film Ringu. Directed by Gore Verbinski, the film, which also starred Martin Henderson and Brian Cox, received favourable reviews and grossed around US$129 million domestically (equivalent to US$ million in ). Watts portrayed Rachel Keller, a journalist investigating the strange deaths of her niece and other teenagers after watching a mysterious videotape, and receiving a phone call announcing their deaths in seven days. Her performance was praised by critics, including Paul Clinton of CNN.com, who stated that she \\"is excellent in this leading role, which proves that her stellar performance in Mulholland Drive was not a fluke. She strikes a perfect balance between scepticism and the slow realisation of the truth in regard to the deadly power of the videotape.\\" That year, she also starred in Rabbits, a series of short films directed by David Lynch; alongside several other famous British actors in the black comedy Plots with a View; and with Tim Daly in the western The Outsider. =Established career (2003‚Äì2007)= In 2003, Watts took the part of Julia Cook in Gregor Jordan's Australian film Ned Kelly opposite Heath Ledger, Orlando Bloom and Geoffrey Rush; as well as starring in the Merchant-Ivory film Le Divorce, portraying Roxeanne de Persand, a poet who is pregnant and abandoned by her husband Charles-Henri de Persand. Roxeanne and her sister Isabel (played by Kate Hudson) dispute the ownership of a painting by Georges de La Tour with the family of Charles-Henri's lover. Entertainment Weekly gave the film a \\"C\\" rating and lamented Watts's performance: \\"I'm disappointed to report that Hudson and Watts have no chemistry as sisters, perhaps because Watts never seems like the expatriate artiste she's supposed to be playing\\". Conversely, her performance opposite Sean Penn and Benicio del Toro in director Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu's 2003 drama 21 Grams earned Watts numerous award nominations, including an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress, later that year. In the story, told in a non-linear manner, she portrayed Cristina Peck, a grief-stricken woman living a suburban life after the killing of her husband and two children by Jack Jordan (Benicio del Toro), who became involved in a relationship with the critically ill academic mathematician Paul Rivers (Sean Penn). She has said of the nomination, \\"It's far beyond what I ever dreamed for ‚Äì that would have been too far fetched\\". The New York Times praised her: \\"Because Ms. Watts reinvents herself with each performance, it's easy to forget how brilliant she is. She has a boldness that comes from a lack of overemphasis, something actresses sometimes do to keep up with Mr. Penn\\". The San Francisco Chronicle wrote: \\"Watts is riveting, but she's much better in scenes of extreme emotion than in those requiring subtlety.\\" Watts in Sydney in 2012 In 2004, Watts starred alongside Mark Ruffalo in the independent film We Don't Live Here Anymore, based on short stories by Andre Dubus, which depicts the crisis of two married couples, reunited with Sean Penn in The Assassination of Richard Nixon, playing the wife of the would-be presidential assassin Samuel Byck (Penn), and teamed up with Jude Law and Dustin Hoffman in David O. Russell's ensemble comedy I Heart Huckabees. She headlined and produced the semi-autobiographical drama Ellie Parker (2005), which depicted the struggle of an Australian actress in Hollywood. The film began as a short film that was screened at the Sundance Film Festival in 2001 and was expanded into a feature-length production over the next four years. Film critic Roger Ebert praised Watts's performance: \\"The character is played by Watts with courage, fearless observation and a gift for timing that is so uncanny it can make points all by itself.\\" Watts starred in the sequel to The Ring, The Ring Two (2005), which despite a negative critical response, made over US$161 million worldwide gross (equivalent to US$ million in ). In 2005, Watts also headlined the remake of King Kong as Ann Darrow. She was the first choice for the role, portrayed by Fay Wray in the original film, with no other actors considered. In preparation for her role, Watts met with Wray, who was to make a cameo appearance and say the final line of dialogue, but she died during pre-production at the age of 96. King Kong proved to be Watts's most commercially successful film yet. Helmed by The Lord of the Rings director Peter Jackson, the film won high praise and grossed US$550 million worldwide (equivalent to US$ million in ). The Seattle Post-Intelligencer praised her performance: \\"The third act becomes a star-crossed, \\"Beauty and the Beast\\" parable far more operatic and tragic than anything the original filmmakers could have imagined, exquisitely pantomimed by Watts with a poignancy and passion that rates Oscar consideration.\\" Alongside the movie, she reprised her role as Darrow in the video game adaptation of King Kong.King Kong cast bananas for game Retrieved 17 May 2019. She was nominated for Best Performance by a Female at the 2005 Spike Video Game Awards for her role as Darrow, as well as winning the Best Cast award with the rest of the game's voice cast. Her other 2005 film release was Marc Forster's psychological thriller Stay, alongside Ewan McGregor, Ryan Gosling and Bob Hoskins. At this point in her career, Watts stated the following: The romantic drama The Painted Veil (2006), with Edward Norton and Liev Schreiber, featured Watts as the daughter of a lawyer who marries a man for his reputation as a physician and bacteriologist. Comparing her portrayal with Greta Garbo's in the original movie, the San Francisco Chronicle wrote \\"Watts makes the role work on her own terms ‚Äì her Kitty is more desperate, more foolish, more miserable and more driven . . . and her spiritual journey is greater. Watts also provided the voice of a small role, Suzie Rabbit, in David Lynch's psychological thriller Inland Empire. That year, she was announced as the new face of the jewellers David Yurman and completed a photoshoot which was featured in the 2007 Pirelli Calendar. Watts portrayed a Russian-British midwife who delivers the baby of a drug-addicted 14-year old prostitute in David Cronenberg's Eastern Promises (2007), with Viggo Mortensen. In its review, Slate magazine observed that she \\"brings a wounded radiance to the overcurious midwife Anna. Though it's a bit of a one-note role, it's a note she's long specialised in, a kind of flustered moral aggrievement\\". Eastern Promises grossed US$56 million worldwide, (equivalent to US$ million in ). She was one of the producers and starred as a mother who, along with her family, are held hostage by a pair of sociopathic teenagers in Michael Haneke's Funny Games (also 2007), a remake of Haneke's 1997 film of the same name. The director said that he agreed to make the film on condition that he be allowed to cast Watts, according to UK's The Daily Telegraph, but it went largely unnoticed by critics and audiences. Nevertheless, Newsweek felt that Watts \\"hurls herself into her physically demanding role with heroic conviction\\". =Biographical and independent films (2009‚Äì2014)= After a short hiatus from acting following the birth of her two children, Watts returned to acting in 2009, starring alongside Clive Owen in the political thriller The International, in which she played a Manhattan assistant district attorney who partners with an Interpol agent to take down a merchant bank. The production was a moderate commercial success, grossing over US$60 million (equivalent to $ million in ) worldwide. She next appeared in the drama Mother and Child, portraying the role of a lawyer who never knew her biological mother. ViewLondon found her to be \\"terrific as [her character], delivering a powerful performance that [...] isn't afraid to be unsympathetic\\". She was nominated for the Best Actress award at the Australian Film Institute Awards and for the Independent Spirit Award for Best Supporting Female. Watts at the Deauville American Film Festival in 2011 Her next film, the Woody Allen dramedy You Will Meet a Tall Dark Stranger, opened at the 2010 Cannes Film Festival, and saw her portray Sally, a woman who has a troubled marriage with author Roy (played by Josh Brolin). It made over US$26 million (equivalent to $ million in ). Her portrayal of Valerie Plame in the biographical thriller Fair Game followed, and marked the third pairing of Watts with Sean Penn after 21 Grams and The Assassination of Richard Nixon. The film earned Watts a Satellite Award nomination for Best Actress. In 2011, she appeared with Daniel Craig and Rachel Weisz in Jim Sheridan's psychological horror film Dream House, as the neighbour of a murdered family, and with Leonardo DiCaprio in Clint Eastwood's biographical drama J. Edgar, playing secretary Helen Gandy. While Dream House flopped, J. Edgar had a more favorable reception. Watts starred in The Impossible (2012), a disaster drama based on the true story of Mar√≠a Bel√≥n and her family's experience of the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami; she played the lead role, with her name changed to Maria Bennett. The film was a critical darling, had the highest-grossing opening weekend for a film in Spain, and made US$180.2 million (equivalent to $ million in ) globally. Deborah Young of The Hollywood Reporter stated that \\"Watts packs a huge charge of emotion as the battered, ever-weakening Maria whose tears of pain and fear never appear fake or idealised,\\" while Justin Chang of Variety magazine remarked that she \\"has few equals at conveying physical and emotional extremis, something she again demonstrates in a mostly bedridden role.\\" Damon Wise of The Guardian felt that \\"Watts is both brave and vulnerable, and her scenes with the young Lucas [...] are among the film's best.\\" Watts went on to be nominated for the Academy Award, Golden Globe and Screen Actors Guild Award for Best Actress. In Adore (2013), Watts starred with Robin Wright as two childhood friends who fall in love with each other's sons. On the film, critics concluded that Watts and Wright \\"give it their all, but they can't quite make Adore's trashy, absurd plot believable\\". She obtained the FCCA Award for Best Actress in 2014 for her role. The anthology comedy Movie 43 (2013) featured Watts as a devoted mother, alongside Liev Schreiber. Movie 43 was universally panned by critics, with Richard Roeper calling it \\"the Citizen Kane of awful\\". In Laurie Collyer's independent drama Sunlight Jr. (2013), Watts starred with Matt Dillon as a struggling working- class couple. San Francisco Chronicle, praising Watts and Dillon, wrote in its review for the film that they are \\"formidable actors at the top of their game here [...] exhibiting a remarkable chemistry\\". Watts portrayed the title role in Oliver Hirschbiegel's Diana (her final film released in 2013), a biographical drama about the last two years of the life of Diana, Princess of Wales. Released amid much controversy given its subject, the film was a critical and commercial flop. James Berardinelli found the film to be a \\"dull, pointless\\" production and remarked that while Watts did a \\"decent job encapsulating the look and feel of Diana\\", her portrayal was \\"a two- dimensional recreation\\". Alejandro Gonz√°lez I√±√°rritu's dark comedy Birdman or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance) (2014) featured Watts as the actress of a play mounted by a faded Hollywood actor (played by Michael Keaton). The film was the subject of widespread acclaim, and won four awards at the 87th Academy Awards including Best Picture; Watts and the other cast members earned the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Cast in a Motion Picture. Her other two awaiting projects were screened at the 2014 Toronto International Film Festival. The dramedy St. Vincent starred Watts as a Russian prostitute. She learnt the accent by spending time with Russian women in a West Village spa during a six-week period. Los Angeles Times reported a dividing reaction towards her performance, asserting that her part \\"put off some critics with its outrageousness\\", but \\"earned plenty of plaudits too\\". Watts nabbed a Screen Actors Guild Award nomination for Outstanding Supporting Actress. In While We're Young, Watts starred with Ben Stiller as a New York City-based married couple who begin hanging out with a couple in their 20s. That film was an arthouse success and Watts received praise for her on-screen chemistry with Stiller. =Film and television balance (2015‚Äìpresent)= Watts at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival Watts played rebel leader Evelyn Johnson-Eaton in Insurgent (2015), the second film in The Divergent Series, which is based on Veronica Roth's best-selling young adult novel of the same name. Despite mixed reviews, the film was a commercial success, grossing US$274.5 million worldwide. Watts reprised her role in the series' third instalment, Allegiant, released on 18 March 2016, to negative reviews and lackluster box office sales. Watts starred in Gus Van Sant's mystery drama The Sea of Trees, opposite Matthew McConaughey, as the wife of an American man who attempts suicide in Mount Fuji's \\"Suicide Forest\\". The film premiered at the 2015 Cannes Film Festival where it competed for the Palme d'Or, but was heavily panned by both critics and audiences, who reportedly booed and laughed during its screening. Critic Richard Mowe stated the audience reaction should \\"give the film's creative team pause for reflection about exactly where they went so badly awry.\\" Justin Chang of Variety also criticised the film, but commended Watts's performance for being \\"solidly moving and sometimes awesomely passive- aggressive.\\" The Sea of Trees did not find an audience in theaters. Like St. Vincent and While We're Young the previous year, Watts had two starring vehicles ‚ÄîDemolition and Three Generations‚Äî screening at the Toronto International Film Festival, in 2015. In Demolition, directed by Jean-Marc Vall√©e and opposite Jake Gyllenhaal, Watts played a customer service representative and the interest of a grieving investment banker (Gyllenhaal). The Wrap felt that she \\"empathetically captures [her] harried single mom\\" role as she played \\"both the wit and the sadness with grace\\". In Three Generations, directed by Gaby Dellal, she appeared with Susan Sarandon and Elle Fanning as the mother of a young transgender man (Fanning). Pulled from the schedule days before its intended initial release, the film subsequently opened on selected theatres in May 2017. Watts played Linda, the second wife of heavyweight boxer Chuck Wepner (played by Liev Schreiber) in the biographical sport drama The Bleeder (2016), revolving around the life of Wepner and his 1975 fight with Muhammad Ali. Variety wrote in its review: \\"Slightly out of place as the feisty bartender who gives Wepner a second chance at his downest and outest, a spirited Naomi Watts nonetheless gives proceedings her best Amy Adams in The Fighter.\\" She headlined the thriller Shut In (also 2016), playing a psychologist insolated with her child in a rural house during a winter storm. The film received largely negative reviews and made US$8 million worldwide. Watts appeared in Twin Peaks, a limited event television series and a continuation of the 1990 show of the same name. It was broadcast on Showtime in 2017, to critical acclaim. Watts starred as \\"a therapist who begins to develop dangerous and intimate relationships with the people in her patients' lives\\" in the Netflix drama series Gypsy (also 2017), and served as one of its executive producers. While response was mixed, Gypsy was cancelled by Netflix after one season. In The Book of Henry (2017), Watts portrayed the mother of young genius who plans save the girl next door from abuse. The film polarized critics and audiences, but Rolling Stone described her as \\"a plus in any movie\\" and found her to be \\"excellent\\" in the role. In her other 2017 film, The Glass Castle opposite Brie Larson, and Woody Harrelson. An adaptation of Jeannette Walls' best selling memoir of the same name, Watts played the nonconformist mother of the author. In 2019, Watts portrayed Gretchen Carlson in the Showtime miniseries The Loudest Voice based on the book The Loudest Voice in the Room about Roger Ailes's sexual harassment of Carlson. She will next star in the films Penguin Bloom, Boss Level, and This Is The Night.

In 2012, she became an ambassador for Pantene's Beautiful Lengths, a program that donates real-hair wigs to women with cancer.

In the spring of 2005, Watts began a relationship with American actor Liev Schreiber. The couple's first son, Alexander \\"Sasha\\" Pete, was born in July 2007 in Los Angeles, and their second son, Samuel \\"Sammy\\" Kai, in December 2008 in New York City.

He was created by Shigeru Miyamoto and designed by Takaya Imamura. Falco acts as the wingman and friend of the titular Fox McCloud for the majority of the series. Falco first appeared in the 1993 video game Star Fox. Since then, he has appeared in multiple Star Fox games. A variety of voice actors have lent their voice to the character in English language releases, whereas Hisao Egawa portrayed Falco in the majority of the Japanese language releases. He was, however, replaced by K≈çsuke Takaguchi starting with Star Fox 64 3D. Hisao briefly reprised his role in Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U. Besides the Star Fox games, Falco has starred in his own manga, and also appears as a playable character in the Super Smash Bros. games beginning with Super Smash Bros. Melee. Falco was based on the model designer of the original Star Fox game. Reception to the character has been mixed, with popularity among fans high. Falco has been mainly criticized for his appearance and contentious attitude, but praised for being far less annoying than other characters in the series. Reaction to his appearance in the Super Smash Bros. series has been similarly mixed, with some reviewers objecting to his moves being cloned from Fox, citing it as an example of low effort on the part of the developers. However, Falco does have some differences: for example, he can jump higher than Fox, use a blaster that can stop opponents in their tracks, and has a deflector which moves in either the direction he is facing as opposed to being still whilst performing this move. Characteristics Falco's name and hooked beak suggests that he is a falcon of some kind, with some official material referring to him as a falcon. On the contrary, the color of his feathers and the shape of his tail feathers resembles that of a pheasant, more specifically the Mikado pheasant and Edwards's pheasant. Interviews with the original developers reveal that Falco was originally intended to be a pheasant. Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate make reference to this in the Palutena's guidance easter egg. Falco's body feathers are blue, with red caruncles around his eyes. His beak is large, yellow and hook-shaped. His build has varied from being somewhat stocky in Star Fox to more of a slim build in Star Fox Assault. Falco originally wore a jumpsuit with a flight jacket and gray tanker boots in Star Fox, like the other characters. His jumpsuit was orange in color, which he retained in Star Fox 64. In Star Fox Adventures, he wore a leather vest over a white shirt, leather pants, a white headband, and sunglasses. In Star Fox Assault, he wore a flashy red and silver long-sleeve jumpsuit with exaggerated shoulder guards. In Star Fox Command, he returned to his Star Fox and Star Fox 64 attire, although his jumpsuit is red instead of orange. \\"Lombardi\\" is the only surname for the original Star Fox team that Dylan Culbert of Q-Games did not come up with. Instead, it came from 2D artist and scenario designer Takaya Imamura. While the character's first name, \\"Falco,\\" is the genus for raptors that includes falcons and kestrels, Falco's surname in the Japanese versions, \\"Rambaldi\\", was taken from Carlo Rambaldi, an Italian special effects artist who worked on films such as Close Encounters of the Third Kind and E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial. The original four members of the Star Fox Team are based on the team for the first game. Falco in particular is based on the model designer, Watanabe. During the events of Star Fox 64, Falco is 19 years old. Falco started as the head of a galactic gang, and possesses an uncooperative attitude, though he is devoted to the pilots he flies with. Falco is one of the most respected and skilled pilots of the Star Fox Team. His personality in general is brash and cocky. Falco has incredible nerves and is able to accurately predict the tide of battle on most occasions. Appearances Falco initially appeared in the first Star Fox game for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. He subsequently appeared in the sequel, Star Fox 64 for the Nintendo 64. In both games, he served as a member of the Star Fox Team, but a minor character nonetheless. Falco often acts as backup for Fox in the games, spinning in to take up Fox's flank. After the defeat of Andross at the end of Star Fox 64, Falco disappears, and is not seen for a significant time. Falco does not appear during the majority of Star Fox Adventures, as he could not be properly integrated into the plot in time for the game's release. Near the end of the game, however, Falco arrives to aid Fox with the final boss, and appears in the last cutscene of the game where he rejoins the Star Fox Team. In Star Fox: Assault for the GameCube, Falco appears as a main member of Star Fox Team once more, this time labelled an ace pilot. Unlike other characters in the game, Falco never leaves his Arwing to fight on the ground, instead providing air support. Star Fox Command has Falco isolating himself from the rest of the team, including flying a new vehicle called the Sky Claw, a slimmer version of the Arwing. The nature of Falco's membership within the Star Fox Team changes depending upon the path the player chooses. In one ending, he joins Fox's son Marcus McCloud and forms a new Star Fox Team. Farewell, Beloved Falco is a manga series that detailed the eight-year gap between Star Fox 64 and Star Fox Adventures. In the manga, Falco receives a request for help from Katt Monroe, leaving the Star Fox Team. At the end of the manga, he stays with Katt Monroe, while Fox returns to the team, and stays away for a long absence. Falco Lombardi made his first appearance in the Super Smash Bros. series in its second installment, Super Smash Bros. Melee, with a similar set of moves to that of Fox. In Melee, Falco is the second-most viable character in competitive play.https://smashboards.com/tiers/#Melee Falco returned for Super Smash Bros. Brawl, Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate as a playable character, trophies, and spirits. Falco is one of the game's fastest characters, and performs his moves very quickly. He jumps higher than Fox and uses a similar reflecting shield, blaster, and Landmaster tank. In Melee, Falco's appearance is based on his design in Star Fox 64, his design in Brawl and Super Smash Bros. for Wii U and 3DS is based on his appearance in Star Fox: Assault and Star Fox Command, while his design in Super Smash Bros. Ultimate combines elements from his appearance in Star Fox Zero and the previous two Super Smash Bros. games. In the Nintendo Switch version of Starlink: Battle for Atlas, Falco makes an appearance along with the other members of the Star Fox team. They join forces with the Starlink team to save Atlas from the Forgotten Legion. Reception Falco is a favorite among Star Fox fans, and among Nintendo fans in general. Though he could be described as \\"cranky\\", Falco gained esteem as a counterpoint to the seemingly annoying Slippy Toad and the older Peppy Hare. UGO Networks listed Falco as one of the top twenty-three second in commands in entertainment, characterizing him as a \\"dick\\", but the most reliable character in the Star Fox series. They also ranked him fifth on its \\"25 Most Memorable Italians in Video Games\\" list. CraveOnline ranked Falco as the tenth \\"Greatest Nintendo Characters\\" describing him as the Han Solo to Fox McCloud's Luke Skywalker. Falco was also placed among by GamesRadar in a list of 10 sidekicks that deserve their own games. On other hand, he has been labeled as a \\"douchebag\\"; Complex listed him on their list of 25 \\"douchiest\\" video game characters, as \\"Falco's ego was too big for the team\\", and he was ranked sixth on Joystick Division's \\"The Top Ten Biggest Douchebags in Video Game History\\" for the same reason. The portrayal of Falco in the Super Smash Bros. series has been both praised and criticized. While IGN noted that Falco operated a bit differently than Fox in the game, and did so in a \\"cool black jacket\\" (in reference to one of his alternate costumes), he was essentially a simple clone of the controllable Fox McCloud. IGN also cited Falco as proof that Masahiro Sakurai did not appear to care about producing original characters with unique move sets. UGO Networks called Falco a lame \\"purple-feathered bird who wears a white jacket and silver boots\\", but still recognizes the effectiveness of his fighting style.

Based in Black Mountain, North Carolina, the school was ideologically organized around John Dewey's principles of education, which emphasized holistic learning and the study of art as central to a liberal arts education. Many of the school's faculty and students were or would go on to become highly influential in the arts, including Josef and Anni Albers, Charles Olson, Ruth Asawa, Walter Gropius, Ray Johnson, Robert Motherwell, Dorothea Rockburne, Cy Twombly, Robert Rauschenberg, Susan Weil, Merce Cunningham, John Cage, Buckminster Fuller, Franz Kline, Aaron Siskind, Willem and Elaine de Kooning, and Mary Caroline Richards. Although it was quite notable during its lifetime, the school closed in 1957 after 24 years due to funding issues, Camp Rockmont for Boys now sits on the campus' site. The history and legacy of Black Mountain College are preserved and extended by the Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center located in downtown Asheville, North Carolina.  History  Black Mountain was founded in 1933 by John Andrew Rice, Theodore Dreier, Frederick Georgia, and Ralph Lounsbury, who were dismissed as faculty from Rollins College in a seminal academic freedom incident, specifically for refusing to sign a loyalty pledge, for which Rollins was formally censured by the American Association of University Professors.Mary Seymour, \\"The Ghosts of Rollins (and Other Skeletons in the Closet)\\", Rollins Magazine, fall 2011, http://www.rollins.edu/magazine/fall-2011/ghosts-of-rollins-2.html ; John Andrew Rice, I Came Out of the Eighteenth Century (1942), reissued, with new introduction by Rice's grandson, William Craig Rice, University of South Carolina Press, 2014, The institution was established to \\"avoid the pitfalls of autocratic chancellors and trustees and allow for a more flexible curriculum,\\" and \\"with the holistic aim 'to educate a student as a person and a citizen.'\\" The school was originally funded through a $10,000 gift from \\"Mac\\" Forbes, a former Rollins College faculty member, after the founders were unable to raise funds from traditional sources.:7 Black Mountain was experimental in nature and committed to an interdisciplinary approach, prioritizing art-making as a necessary component of education and attracting a faculty and lecturers that included many of America's leading visual artists, composers, poets, and designers. During the 1930s and 1940s the school flourished, becoming well known as an incubator for artistic talent. Notable events at the school were common; it was here that the first large-scale geodesic dome was made by faculty member Buckminster Fuller and students, where Merce Cunningham formed his dance company, and where John Cage staged his first musical happening. In the 1950s, the focus of the school shifted to the literary arts under the rectorship of Charles Olson. Olson founded The Black Mountain Review in 1954 and, together with his colleague and student Robert Creeley, developed the poetic school of Black Mountain Poets. Additionally, the College was an important incubator for the American avant- garde. Black Mountain proved to be an important precursor to and prototype for many of the alternative colleges of today, ranging from College of the Atlantic, Naropa University, the University of California, Santa Cruz, and Marlboro College to Evergreen State College, Hampshire College, Shimer College, Prescott College, Goddard College, World College West (1973-1992), and New College of Florida, among others, including Warren Wilson College located just minutes down the road from where Black Mountain College was located. Bennington College, based on the same philosophy, was founded one year before Black Mountain College.  Structure  Main Building of the former Black Mountain College, on the current grounds of Camp Rockmont The school operated using non-hierarchical methodologies that placed students and educators on the same plane. Revolving around 20th-century ideals about the value and importance of balancing education, art, and cooperative labor, students were required to participate in farm work, construction projects, and kitchen duty as part of their holistic education. The students were involved at all levels of institutional decision-making. They were also left in charge of deciding when they were ready to graduate, which notoriously few ever did. There were no course requirements, official grades (except for transfer purposes), or accredited degrees. Graduates were presented with handcrafted diplomas as purely ceremonial symbols of their achievement. The liberal arts program offered at Black Mountain was broad, and supplemented by art making as a means of cultivating creative thinking within all fields. While Albers led the school, the only two requirements were a course on materials and form taught by Albers and a course on Plato. From 1933 to 1941, Black Mountain College was located at the YMCA Blue Ridge Assembly.  Sociopolitical context  In 1933, the Nazis shut down the Bauhaus in Germany, a similarly progressive arts-based educational institution. Many of the school's faculty left Europe for the US, and a number of them settled at Black Mountain, most notably Josef Albers, who was selected to run the art program, and his wife Anni Albers, who taught weaving and textile design. Adolf Hitler's rise to power and the subsequent persecution taking place in Europe led many artists and intellectuals to flee and resettle in the US, populating Black Mountain College with an influx of both students and faculty. In addition, the college was operating in the South during the period of legal racial segregation at other colleges and universities in the region. While not immune from racial tensions, the student Alma Stone Williams, an African American woman, is considered by some to be the first black student to enroll in an all-white institution of higher education in the South during the Jim Crow era. Notable African American teachers included Carol Brice and Roland Hayes during the 1945 Summer Music Institute; Percy H. Baker, hired on full-time in 1945; Jacob Lawrence and Gwendolyn Knight during the 1946 Summer Art Institute; and Mark Oakland Fax for the Spring 1946 quarter. The Julius Rosenwald Fund provided African American teachers' salaries as well as student scholarships.  Locations  The college originally rented the YMCA Blue Ridge Assembly buildings south of Black Mountain, North Carolina. In 1937, it purchased a 667-acre property across the valley at Lake Eden.:8 In May 1941, following the end of their lease at Blue Ridge Assembly, the College moved its operations to Lake Eden, where it remained until its closing in 1957.:8 The property was later purchased and converted to an ecumenical Christian boys' residential summer camp (Camp Rockmont). This has been used for years as the site of the Black Mountain Festival, the Lake Eden Arts Festival, and Black Mountain College Museum + Arts Center's {Re}HAPPENING. A number of the original structures are still in use as lodgings or administrative facilities, and two frescos painted by Jean Charlot remain intact on the site.  Closing  Black Mountain College closed in 1957, eight years after Albers left to direct the first design department at Yale. The college suspended classes by court order due to debts; the school was unable to sustain itself financially given the greatly decreased number of students. In 1962, the school's books were finally closed, with all debts covered.Buckminster Fuller at Black Mountain College in 1949  Legacy  The Black Mountain College Museum & Arts Center, founded in 1993, continues the legacy of Black Mountain College through talks, exhibitions, performances, collection and preservation, and an annual fall conference that examines the college's history and impact. The Journal of Black Mountain College Studies is a peer-reviewed, open-access digital publication that publishes articles, essays, and creative work related to the school and the individuals associated with it. Black Mountain College was the subject of the museum exhibition Leap Before You Look: Black Mountain College 1933-1957, which opened at the Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston on October 10, 2015. The show was curated by Helen Molesworth with Ruth Erickson. (exhibit review) The show later exhibited at the Hammer Museum from February 21 to May 15, 2016. Black Mountain College was featured in Nicholas Sparks' novel, The Longest Ride (2013) and the 2015 movie adaptation of the same name.

By the time of his death, he had conquered most of the world known to the ancient Greeks.See, e.g., ac.wwu.edu However, he failed to conquer all of South Asia.

Alexander assumed the kingship of Macedonia following the death of his father Philip II, who had unified most of the city-states of mainland Greece under Macedonian hegemony in a federation called the Hellenic League.Sacks, David, (1995), Encyclopedia of the Ancient Greek World, London: Constable and Co. Ltd, , p. 16. After reconfirming Macedonian rule by quashing a rebellion of southern Greek city-states and staging a short but bloody excursion against Macedon's northern neighbors, Alexander set out east against the Achaemenid Persian Empire, under its \\"King of Kings\\" (the title all Achaemenid kings went by), Darius III, which he defeated and overthrew. His conquests included Anatolia, Syria, Phoenicia, Judea, Gaza, Egypt, Mesopotamia, Persia and Bactria, and he extended the boundaries of his own empire as far as Taxila, India (now Pakistan). Alexander had already made more plans prior to his death for military and mercantile expansions into the Arabian Peninsula, after which he was to turn his armies to the west (Carthage, Rome, and the Iberian Peninsula). However, Alexander's diadochi quietly abandoned these grandiose plans after his death. Instead, within a few years of Alexander's death, the diadochi began fighting with each other, dividing up the Empire between themselves, and triggering 40 years of warfare. Background The Kingdom of Macedon in 332 BC Philip II was assassinated by the captain of his bodyguard, Pausanias. Philip's son, and previously designated heir, Alexander was proclaimed king by the Macedonian noblemen and army.McCarty, Alexander the elmo, p. 30-31. * Plutarch, The Age of Alexander, p. 262-263 * Renault, The Nature of Alexander the Great, p. 61-62 * Fox, The Search For Alexander, p. 72 News of Philip's death roused many states into revolt including Thebes, Athens, Thessaly, and the Thracian tribes to the north of Macedon. When news of the revolt reached Alexander he responded quickly. Though his advisers counseled him to use diplomacy, Alexander mustered the Macedonian cavalry of 3,000 men and rode south towards Thessaly, Macedon's immediate neighbor to the south. When he found the Thessalian army occupying the pass between Mount Olympus and Mount Ossa, he had the men ride over Mount Ossa and, when the Thessalians awoke, they found Alexander at their rear. The Thessalians surrendered and added their cavalry to Alexander's force as he rode down towards the Peloponnese.McCarty, Alexander the Great, p. 31. * Plutarch, The Age of Alexander, p. 263 * Renault, The Nature of Alexander the Great, p. 72 * Fox, The Search For Alexander, p. 104 * Bose, Alexander the Great's Art of Strategy, p. 95 Alexander stopped at Thermopylae, where he was recognized as the leader of the Sacred League before heading south to Corinth. Athens sued for peace and Alexander received the envoy and pardoned anyone involved with the uprising. At Corinth, he was given the title 'Hegemon' of the Greek forces against the Persians. Whilst at Corinth, he heard the news of a Thracian uprising in the north.Bose, Alexander the Great's Art of Strategy, p. 96. * Renault, The Nature of Alexander the Great, p. 72 Balkan campaign Before crossing to Asia, Alexander wanted to safeguard his northern borders and, in the spring of 335 BC, he advanced into Thrace to deal with the revolt, which was led by the Illyrians and Triballi. At Mount Haemus, the Macedonian army attacked and defeated a Thracian garrison manning the heights. The Macedonians were then attacked in the rear by the Triballi, who were crushed in turn. Alexander then advanced on to the Danube, encountering the Getae tribe on the opposite shore. The Getae army retreated after the first cavalry skirmish, leaving their town to the Macedonian army.*Arrian, The Campaigns of Alexander, p. 44‚Äì48. * Renault, The Nature of Alexander the Great, p. 73‚Äì74. News then reached Alexander that Cleitus, King of Illyria, and King Glaukias of the Taulantii were in open revolt against Macedonian authority. Alexander defeated each in turn, forcing Cleitus and Glaukias to flee with their armies, leaving Alexander's northern frontier secure.*Arrian, The Campaigns of Alexander, p. 50‚Äì54. * Renault, The Nature of Alexander the Great, p. 77. While he was triumphantly campaigning north, the Thebans and Athenians rebelled once more. Alexander reacted immediately, but, while the other cities once again hesitated, Thebes decided to resist with the utmost vigor. This resistance was useless, however, as the city was razed to the ground amid great bloodshed and its territory divided between the other Boeotian cities. The end of Thebes cowed Athens into submission, leaving all of Greece at least outwardly at peace with Alexander. Persia =Asia Minor= In 334 BC, Alexander crossed the Hellespont into Asia. It took over one hundred triremes (triple-banked galleys) to transport the entire Macedonian army, but the Persians decided to ignore the movement.cf. In these early months, Darius still refused to take Alexander seriously or mount a serious challenge to Alexander's movements. Memnon of Rhodes, the Greek mercenary who aligned himself with the Persians, advocated a scorched earth strategy. He wanted the Persians to destroy the land in front of Alexander, which he hoped would force Alexander's army to starve, and then to turn back. The satraps in Anatolia rejected this advice, considering it their duty to defend their land. Eventually, with Alexander advancing deeper into Persian territory, Darius ordered all five satraps of the Anatolian provinces to pool their military resources together and confront Alexander. This army was guided by Memnon, while absolute command was split among the five satraps. Battle of the Granicus River Map of what would become Alexander's empire The Battle of the Granicus River in May 334 BC was fought in Northwestern Asia Minor (modern-day Turkey), near the site of Troy. After crossing the Hellespont, Alexander advanced up the road to the capital of the Satrapy of Phrygia. The various satraps of the Persian empire gathered their forces at the town of Zelea and offered battle on the banks of the Granicus River. Alexander ultimately fought many of his battles on a river bank. By doing so, he was able to minimize the advantage the Persians had in numbers. In addition, the deadly Persian chariots were useless on a cramped, muddy river bank. Arrian, Diodorus, and Plutarch all mention the battle, with Arrian providing the most detail. The Persians placed their cavalry in front of their infantry, and drew up on the right (east) bank of the river. The Macedonian line was arrayed with the heavy Phalanxes in the middle, Macedonian cavalry led by Alexander on the right, and allied Thessalian cavalry led by Parmenion on the left. The Persians expected the main assault to come from Alexander's position and moved units from their center to that flank. Herma of Alexander (Roman copy of a 330 BC statue by Lysippus, Louvre Museum). According to Diodorus, the Alexander sculptures by Lysippus were the most faithful. Alexander's second-in-command, Parmenion, suggested crossing the river upstream and attacking at dawn the next day, but Alexander attacked immediately. He ordered a small group of cavalry and light infantry to attack from the Macedonian right to draw the Persians off the bank and into the river. Seeing that he successfully broke the Persian line, Alexander led his horse companions in oblique order further to the right in order to outflank the Persians and buy time for his infantry to cross the river. Several high-ranking Persian nobles were killed by Alexander himself or his bodyguards, although Alexander was stunned by an axe-blow from a Persian nobleman named Spithridates. Before the noble could deal a death-blow, however, he was himself killed by Cleitus the Black. The Macedonian cavalry opened a hole in the Persian line as the Macedonian infantry advanced, forcing the enemy back and eventually breaking their center. The Persian cavalry turned and fled the battlefield, and the Greek mercenary infantry they held in reserve were encircled by the Macedonians and slaughtered; only around two-thousand of which survived, and were sent back to Macedonia for labor. Alexander consolidates support in Asia Minor After the battle, Alexander buried the dead (Greeks and Persians), and sent the captured Greek mercenaries back to Greece to work in the mines, as an abject lesson for any Greek who decided to fight for the Persians. He sent some of the spoils back to Greece, including three hundred panoplies (complete Persian suits of armor) back to Athens to be dedicated in the Parthenon with the inscription \\"Alexander, son of Philip and the Greeks, Lacedaemonians (Spartans) excepted, these spoils from the barbarians who dwell in Asia\\".https://issuu.com/sonjcemarceva/docs/alexander_the_great_-_historical_so, see page 72 [Arrian, 1.16.7.] Antipater, whom Alexander had left in charge of Macedon in his absence, had been given a free hand to install dictators and tyrants wherever he saw fit in order to minimize the risk of a rebellion. As he moved deeper into Persia, however, the threat of trouble seemed to grow. Many of these towns had been ruled for generations by heavy handed tyrants, so in these Persian towns, he did the opposite of what he did in Greece. Wanting to appear to be a liberator, he freed the population and allowed self-government. As he continued marching into Persia, he saw that his victory at Granicus had been lost on no one. Town after town seemed to surrender to him. The satrap at Sardis, as well as his garrison, was among the first of many satraps to capitulate. As these satraps gave up, Alexander appointed new ones to replace them, and claimed to distrust the accumulation of absolute power into anyone's hands. There appeared to be little change from the old system. Alexander, however, appointed independent boards to collect tribute and taxes from the satrapies, which appeared to do nothing more than improve the efficiency of government. The true effect, however, was to separate the civil from the financial function of these satrapies, thus ensuring that these governments, while technically independent of him, never truly were. Otherwise, he allowed the inhabitants of these towns to continue as they always had, and made no attempt to impose Greek customs on them. Meanwhile, ambassadors from other Greek cities in Asia Minor came to Alexander, offering submission if he allowed their 'democracies' to continue. Alexander granted their wish, and allowed them to stop paying taxes to Persia, but only if they joined the League of Corinth. By doing so, they promised to provide monetary support to Alexander. Siege of Halicarnassus The Siege of Halicarnassus was undertaken in 334 BC. Alexander, who had a weak navy, was constantly being threatened by the Persian navy. It continuously attempted to provoke an engagement with Alexander, who would have none of it. Eventually, the Persian fleet sailed to Halicarnassus, in order to establish a new defense. Ada of Caria, the former queen of Halicarnassus, had been driven from her throne by her usurping brother. When he died, Darius had appointed Orontobates satrap of Caria, which included Halicarnassus in its jurisdiction. On the approach of Alexander in 334 BC, Ada, who was in possession of the fortress of Alinda, surrendered the fortress to him. Alexander and Ada appear to have formed an emotional connection. He called her \\"mother\\", finding her more amicable than his megalomaniacal snake-worshiping mother Olympias. In return for his support, Ada gave Alexander gifts, and even sent him some of the best cooks in Asia Minor, realizing that Alexander had a sweet tooth. In the past, Alexander had referred to his biological father, Philip, as his \\"so-called\\" father, and preferred to think of the deity Amon Zeus as his actual father. Thus, he had finally managed to divorce himself from both of his biological parents. Orontobates and Memnon of Rhodes entrenched themselves in Halicarnassus. Alexander had sent spies to meet with dissidents inside the city, who had promised to open the gates and allow Alexander to enter. When his spies arrived, however, the dissidents were nowhere to be found. A small battle resulted, and Alexander's army managed to break through the city walls. Memnon, however, now deployed his catapults, and Alexander's army fell back. Memnon then deployed his infantry, and shortly before Alexander would have received his first (and only) defeat, his infantry managed to break through the city walls, surprising the Persian forces and killing Orontobates. Memnon, realizing the city was lost, set fire to it and withdrew with his army. A strong wind caused the fire to destroy much of the city. Alexander then committed the government of Caria to Ada; and she, in turn, formally adopted Alexander as her son, ensuring that the rule of Caria passed unconditionally to him upon her eventual death. =Syria= Shortly after the battle, Memnon died. His replacement was a Persian who had spent time in Macedonia called Pharnabazus. He disrupted Alexander's supply routes by taking Aegean islands near the Hellespont and by fomenting rebellion in southern Greece. Meanwhile, Darius took the Persian army to intercept Alexander. Alexander marched his army east through Cappadocia, where, for a stretch of nearly , there was no water. As his army approached Mount Taurus, they found only one route through which to pass, which was a narrow defile called \\"The Gates\\". The defile was very narrow, and could have been easily defended. However, the Persian satrap of Cappadocia had an inflated view of his own abilities. He had been at the Battle of the Granicus River, and had believed that Memnon's scorched Earth strategy would work here. He didn't realize that the different circumstances of the terrain made that strategy useless. Had he mounted a credible defence of the defile, Alexander would have been easily repulsed. He left only a small contingent to guard the defile, and took his entire army to destroy the plain that lay ahead of Alexander's army. The Persian contingent that was supposed to guard the defile soon abandoned it, and Alexander passed through without any problems. Alexander supposedly said after this incident that he had never been so lucky in his entire career. After reaching Mount Taurus, Alexander's army found a stream that flowed from the mountain with water that was ice cold. Not thinking, Alexander jumped into the stream, suffered a cramp and then a convulsion, and was pulled out nearly dead. He quickly developed pneumonia, but none of his physicians would treat him, because they feared that, if he died, they would be held responsible. One physician named Philip, who had treated Alexander since he was a child, agreed to treat him. Although he soon fell into a coma, he eventually recovered. Battle of Issus Alexander's decisive attack The battle of Issus took place in November 333 BC. After Alexander's forces successfully defeated the Persians at the Battle of the Granicus, Darius took personal charge of his army, gathered a large army from the depths of the empire, and maneuvered to cut the Greek line of supply, requiring Alexander to countermarch his forces, setting the stage for the battle near the mouth of the Pinarus River and south of the village of Issus. Darius was apparently unaware that, by deciding to stage the battle on a river bank, he was minimizing the numerical advantage his army had over Alexander's. Initially, Alexander chose what was apparently unfavorable ground. This surprised Darius who mistakenly elected to hold the wrong position while Alexander instructed his infantry to take up a defensive posture. Alexander personally led the more elite Greek Companion cavalry against the Persian left up against the hills, and cut up the enemy on the less encumbering terrain, thereby generating a quick rout. After achieving a breakthrough, Alexander demonstrated he could do the difficult and held the cavalry successfully in check after it broke the Persian right. Alexander then mounted his beloved horse Bucephalus, took his place at the head of his Companion cavalry, and led a direct assault against Darius. The horses that were pulling Darius' chariot were injured, and began tossing at the yoke. Darius, about to fall off his chariot, instead jumped off. He threw his royal diadem away, mounted a horse, and fled the scene. The Persian troops, realizing they had lost, either surrendered or fled with their hapless king. The Macedonian cavalry pursued the fleeing Persians for as long as there was light. As with most ancient battles, significant carnage occurred after the battle as pursuing Macedonians slaughtered their crowded, disorganized foe. The Battle of Issus occurred in southern Anatolia, in November 333 BC. The invading troops led by Alexander were outnumbered more than 2:1, yet they defeated the army personally led by Darius III of Achaemenid Persia. The battle was a decisive Macedonian victory and it marked the beginning of the end of Persian power. It was the first time the Persian army had been defeated with the King present on the field. Darius left his wife and an enormous amount of treasure behind as his army fled. The greed of the Macedonians helped to persuade them to keep going, as did the large number of Persian concubines and prostitutes they picked up in the battle. Darius, now fearing for both his throne and his life, sent a letter to Alexander in which he promised to pay a substantial ransom in exchange for the prisoners of war, and agreeing to a treaty of alliance with and the forfeiture of half of his empire to Alexander. Darius received a response which began \\"King Alexander to Darius\\". In the letter, Alexander blamed Darius for his father's death and claimed Darius was but a vulgar usurper, who planned to take Macedonia. He agreed to return the prisoners without ransom, but told Darius that he and Alexander were not equals, and that Darius was to henceforth address Alexander as \\"King of all Asia\\". Darius was also curtly informed that, if he wanted to dispute Alexander's claim to the Achaemenid throne, that he would have to stand and fight, and that if he instead fled, Alexander would pursue and kill him. By this, Alexander revealed for the first time that his plan was to conquer the entire Persian Empire. Siege of Tyre A naval action during the siege, Drawing by Andr√© Castaigne The Siege of Tyre occurred in 332 BC when Alexander set out to conquer Tyre, a strategic coastal base. Tyre was the site of the only remaining Persian port that did not capitulate to Alexander. Even by this point in the war, the Persian navy still posed a major threat to Alexander. Tyre, the largest and most important city-state of Phoenicia, was located both on the Mediterranean coast as well as a nearby Island with two natural harbors on the landward side. At the time of the siege, the city held approximately 40,000 people, though the women and children were evacuated to Carthage, an ancient Phoenician colony. Alexander sent an envoy to Tyre, proposing a peace treaty, and asked to visit their city and offer sacrifices to their God Melqart. The Tyrians politely told Alexander that their town was neutral in the war, and that allowing him to offer sacrifices to Melqart would be tantamount to recognizing him as their king. Alexander considered building a causeway that would allow his army to take the town by force. His engineers didn't believe it would be possible to successfully build such a massive structure, and so Alexander sent peace envoys once more to propose an alliance. The Tyrians believed this to be a sign of weakness, and so they killed the envoys and threw their bodies over the city wall. The dissent against Alexander's plans to take the city by force disappeared, and his engineers began to design the structure. Alexander began with an engineering feat that shows the true extent of his brilliance; as he could not attack the city from sea, he built a kilometer-long causeway stretching out to the island on a natural land bridge no more than two meters deep. Alexander then constructed two towers 150 feet high and moved them to the end of the causeway. The Tyrians, however, quickly devised a counterattack. They used an old horse transport ship, filling it with dried branches, pitch, sulfur, and various other combustibles. They then lit it on fire, creating what we might call a primitive form of napalm, and ran it up onto the causeway. The fire spread quickly, engulfing both towers and other siege equipment that had been brought up. This convinced Alexander that he would be unable to take Tyre without a navy. Fate would soon provide him with one. Presently, the Persian navy returned to find their home cities under Alexander's control. Since their allegiance was to their city, they were therefore Alexander's. He now had eighty ships. This coincided with the arrival of another hundred and twenty from Cyprus, which had heard of his victories and wished to join him. Alexander then sailed on Tyre and quickly blockaded both ports with his superior numbers. He had several of the slower galleys, and a few barges, refit with battering rams, the only known case of battering rams being used on ships. Alexander started testing the wall at various points with his rams, until he made a small breach in the south end of the island. He then coordinated an attack across the breach with a bombardment from all sides by his navy. Once his troops forced their way into the city, they easily overtook the garrison, and quickly captured the city. Those citizens that took shelter in the temple of Heracles were pardoned by Alexander. It is said that Alexander was so enraged at the Tyrians' defense and the loss of his men that he destroyed half the city. Alexander granted pardon to the king and his family, whilst 30,000 residents and foreigners taken were sold into slavery. There was a family, though, that Alexander gave a very high position in his government, but the only contact he ever had with them was when he spent the night with the wife of the household. =Egypt= Siege of Gaza The stronghold at Gaza was built on a hill and was heavily fortified. The inhabitants of Gaza and their Nabataean allies did not want to lose the lucrative trade which was controlled by Gaza. Alexander Mosaic, showing Battle of Issus, from the House of the Faun, Pompeii Batis, the commander of the fortress of Gaza, refused to surrender to Alexander. Though a eunuch, Batis was physically imposing and ruthless. After three unsuccessful assaults, the stronghold was finally taken by force, but not before Alexander received a serious shoulder wound. When Gaza was taken, the male population was put to the sword and the women and children were sold into slavery. According to the Roman historian Quintus Curtius Rufus, Batis was killed by Alexander in imitation of Achilles' treatment of the fallen Hector. A rope was forced through Batis's ankles, probably between the ankle bone and the Achilles tendon, and Batis was dragged alive by chariot beneath the walls of the city. Alexander, who admired courage in his enemies and might have been inclined to show mercy to the brave Persian general, was infuriated at Batis's refusal to kneel and by the enemy commander's haughty silence and contemptuous manner. With Gaza taken, Alexander marched into Egypt. The Egyptians hated the Persians, in part because Persia considered Egypt as nothing more than a breadbasket. They welcomed Alexander as their king, placed him on the throne of the Pharaohs, giving him the crown of Upper and Lower Egypt, and named him the incarnation of Ra and Osiris. He set in motion plans to build Alexandria, and, though future tax revenues would be channeled to him, he left Egypt under the management of Egyptians, which helped to win him their support. =Mesopotamia= Battle of Gaugamela The Battle of Gaugamela took place in 331 BC in what is now Iraqi Kurdistan, possibly near Dohuk,http://www.kurdishglobe.net/article/18EDF300EF8A0184B86ADF8FB69F6BC0/The-Location-of-the-Battle-of-Gaugamela-Discovered.htmlHighBeam and resulted in a decisive victory for the Macedonians. After the Siege of Gaza, Alexander advanced from Syria towards the heart of the Persian empire, crossing both the Euphrates and the Tigris rivers without any opposition. Darius was building up a massive army, drawing men from the far reaches of his empire, and planned to use sheer numbers to crush Alexander. Though Alexander had conquered part of the Persian empire, it was still vast in area and in manpower reserves, and Darius could recruit more men than Alexander could dream of. Also present in the Persian army, a sign that the Persians were still very powerful, were the feared war elephants. While Darius had a significant advantage in number of soldiers, most of his troops weren't as organized as Alexander's. Alexander's decisive attack The battle began with the Persians already present at the battlefield. Darius had recruited the finest cavalry from his eastern satrapies. Darius placed himself in the center with his best infantry as was the tradition among Persian kings. The Macedonians were divided into two, with the right side of the army falling under the direct command of Alexander, and the left to Parmenion. Alexander began by ordering his infantry to march in phalanx formation towards the center of the enemy line. Darius now launched his chariots, which were intercepted by the Agrianians, and quickly rendered useless. Alexander, while leading the charge, formed his units into a giant wedge, which quickly smashed right into the weakened Persian center. Darius' charioteer was killed by a spear, and chaos rang out as everyone (incorrectly) thought it was Darius who had been killed. The Persian line then collapsed, and Darius fled. Darius escaped with a small core of his forces remaining intact, although the Bactrian cavalry and Bessus soon caught up with him. The remaining Persian resistance was quickly put down. In all, the Battle of Gaugamela was a disastrous defeat for the Persians, and possibly one of Alexander's finest victories. =Bactria= Alexander's first victory over Darius, the Persian king depicted in medieval European style in the 15th century romance The History of Alexander‚Äôs Battles After the battle, Parmenion rounded up the Persian baggage train while Alexander and his own bodyguard chased after Darius in hopes of catching up. Substantial amounts of loot were gained following the battle, with 4,000 talents captured, as well as the King's personal chariot and bow. Darius planned to head further east, and raise another army to face Alexander while he and the Macedonians headed to one of the Persian capitals, Babylon, and then to another, Susa. There, Alexander found wealth that even he had never imagined possible. He paid his troops, and sent a sum of money six times the annual income of Athens to Greece, in order to put down a Spartan rebellion. Darius, meanwhile, dispatched letters to his eastern satrapies asking them to remain loyal. The satrapies, however, had other intentions, and quickly capitulated to Alexander. Bessus fatally stabbed Darius, before fleeing eastwards. Darius was found by one of Alexander's scouts, moaning in pain. Darius, dying and chained to a baggage train being pulled by an ox, was lying next to a lone dog and royal robes covered in blood. He asked for water, and then, clutching the Macedonian soldier's hand, said that he was thankful that he would not die utterly alone and abandoned. Alexander, who may have felt genuinely saddened at Darius' death, buried Darius next to his Achaemenid predecessors in a full military funeral. Alexander claimed that, while dying, Darius had named Alexander as his successor to the Achaemenid throne and had asked Alexander to avenge his death, a striking irony since it was Alexander who had pursued him to his death. The Achaemenid Persian Empire is considered to have fallen with the death of Darius. Alexander, viewing himself as the legitimate Achaemenid successor to Darius, viewed Bessus as a usurper to the Achaemenid throne, and eventually found and executed this 'usurper'. The majority of the existing satraps were to give their loyalty to Alexander, and be allowed to keep their positions. Alexander's troops now thought the war was over. Alexander was unsure how to deal with this, so he decided to scare them into submission. He gave a speech, arguing that their conquests were not secure, that the Persians did not want the Greeks to remain in their country, and that only the strength of Macedon could secure the country. The speech worked, and Alexander's troops agreed to remain with him. Alexander, now the Persian \\"King of Kings\\", adopted Persian dress and mannerisms, which, in time, the Greeks began to view as decadent and autocratic. They began to fear that Alexander, the king they had hero-worshiped, was turning into an eastern despot, although a young eunuch was eventually introduced to Alexander, and helped to keep his decadence in check. =Battle of the Persian Gate= Map of the Persian Gate In the winter of 330 BC, at the Battle of the Persian Gate northeast of today's Yasuj in Iran, the Persian satrap Ariobarzanes led a last stand of the Persian forces. . After the Battle of Gaugamela in present-day Iraqi Kurdistan, Alexander had advanced to Babylon and Susa. A Royal Road connected Susa with the more eastern capitals of Persepolis and Pasargadae in Persis (the Persian Empire had several \\"capitals\\"), and was the natural venue for Alexander's continued campaign. After the conquest of Susa, Alexander split the Macedonian army into two parts. Alexander's general, Parmenion, took one half along the Royal Road, and Alexander himself took the route towards Persis. Passing into Persis required traversing the Persian Gates, a narrow mountain pass that lent itself easily to ambush.For the identification, see Henry Speck, \\"Alexander at the Persian Gates. A Study in Historiography and Topography\\" in: American Journal of Ancient History n.s. 1.1 (2002) 15-234; more.... Believing that, after his victory over the Uxians, he would not encounter any more enemy forces during his march, Alexander neglected to send scouts ahead of his vanguard, and thus walked into Ariobarzanes' ambush. Once the Macedonian army had advanced sufficiently into the narrow pass, the Persians rained down boulders on them from the northern slopes. From the southern slope, Persian archers and catapults launched their projectiles. Alexander's army initially suffered heavy casualties, losing entire platoons at a time.Quintus Curtius Rufus Ariobarzanes had hoped that defeating Alexander at the Persian Gates would allow the Persians more time to field another army, and possibly stop the Macedonian invasion altogether. Ariobarzanes held the pass for a month,N. G. L. Hammond (1992). \\"The Archaeological and Literary Evidence for the Burning of the Persepolis Palace\\", The Classical Quarterly 42 (2), p. 358-364. but Alexander succeeded in encircling the Persian army and broke through the Persian defenses. The defeat of Ariobarzanes's forces at the Persian Gate removed the last military obstacle between Alexander and Persepolis. Upon his arrival at the city of Persepolis, Alexander appointed a general named Phrasaortes as successor of Ariobarzanes. Four months later, Alexander allowed the troops to loot Persepolis. A fire broke out and spread to the rest of the city. It is not clear if it had been a drunken accident, or a deliberate act of revenge for the burning of the Acropolis of Athens during the Second Greco-Persian War. Siege of the Sogdian Rock After Alexander defeated the last of the Achaemenid Empire's forces in 328 BC, he began a new campaign against the various Indian kings in 327 BC. He wanted to conquer the entire known world, which in Alexander's day, ended on the eastern end of India. Greeks of Alexander's day knew nothing of China, or any other lands east of India. The Siege of the Sogdian Rock, a fortress located north of Bactria in Sogdiana, occurred in 327 BC. Oxyartes of Bactria had sent his wife and daughters, one of whom was Roxana, to take refuge in the fortress, as it was thought to be impregnable, and was provisioned for a long siege. When Alexander asked the defenders to surrender, they refused, telling him that he would need \\"men with wings\\" to capture it. Alexander asked for volunteers, whom he would reward if they could climb the cliffs under the fortress. There were some 300 men who from previous sieges had gained experience in rock-climbing. Using tent-pegs and strong flaxen lines, they climbed the cliff face at night, losing about 30 of their number during the ascent. In accordance with Alexander's orders, they signaled their success to the troops below by waving bits of linen, and Alexander sent a herald to shout the news to the enemy's advanced posts that they might now surrender without further delay. The defenders were so surprised and demoralized by this that they surrendered. Alexander fell in love with Roxana, whom ancient historians call the \\"most beautiful woman in the world\\" (not an uncommon claim for an ancient queen) on sight and eventually married her. The story of the siege is told by the Roman historian Arrian of Nicomedia, in Anabasis (section 4.18.4‚Äì19.6). Indian (Modern History) Campaign Campaigns and landmarks of Alexander's invasion of the Indian subcontinent After the death of Spitamenes and his marriage to Roxana (Roshanak in Bactrian) to cement his relations with his new Central Asian satrapies, Alexander was finally free to turn his attention to the Indian subcontinent. Alexander invited all the chieftains of the former satrapy of Gandhara, in the north of what is now Jhelum River, Pakistani region (Mordern History) to come to him and submit to his authority. Omphis, ruler of Taxila, whose kingdom extended from the Indus to the Hydaspes, complied, but the chieftains of some hill clans, including the Aspasioi and Assakenoi sections of the Kambojas (known in Indian texts also as Ashvayanas and Ashvakayanas), refused to submit. In the winter of 327/326 BC, Alexander personally led a campaign against these clans; the Aspasioi of Kunar valley, the Guraeans of the Guraeus valley, and the Assakenoi of the Swat and Buner valleys. A fierce contest ensued with the Aspasioi in which Alexander himself was wounded in the shoulder by a dart but eventually the Aspasioi lost the fight. Alexander then faced the Assakenoi, who fought bravely and offered stubborn resistance to Alexander in the strongholds of Massaga, Ora and Aornos. The fort of Massaga could only be reduced after several days of bloody fighting in which Alexander himself was wounded seriously in the ankle. According to Curtius, \\"Not only did Alexander slaughter the entire population of Massaga, but also did he reduce its buildings to rubbles\\".Curtius in McCrindle, Op cit, p 192, J. W. McCrindle; History of Punjab, Vol I, 1997, p 229, Punajbi University, Patiala, (Editors): Fauja Singh, L. M. Joshi; Kambojas Through the Ages, 2005, p 134, Kirpal Singh. A similar slaughter then followed at Ora, another stronghold of the Assakenoi. In the aftermath of Massaga and Ora, numerous Assakenians fled to the fortress of Aornos. Alexander followed close behind their heels and captured the strategic hill-fort after the fourth day of a bloody fight. This fight was the challenge Alexander was looking for, an army with huge elephants that were almost able to defeat Alexander. A painting by Charles Le Brun depicting Alexander and Porus (Puru) during the Battle of the Hydaspes. After gaining control of the former Achaemenid satrapy of Gandhara, including the city of Taxila, Alexander advanced into Punjab, where he engaged in battle against the regional king Porus, whom Alexander defeated in the Battle of the Hydaspes in 326 BC,Fuller, pg 198 The Anabasis of Alexander/Book V/Chapter XVIII but was so impressed by the demeanor with which the king carried himself that he allowed Porus to continue governing his own kingdom as a satrap.The Anabasis of Alexander/Book V/Chapter XIX Although victorious, Battle of the Hydaspes was also the most costly battle fought by the Macedonians.Peter Connolly. Greece and Rome at War. Macdonald Phoebus Ltd, 1981, p. 66 East of Porus' kingdom, near the Ganges River, was the powerful Nanda Empire of Magadha and Gangaridai Empire of Bengal. According to the Greek sources, the Nanda army was five times larger than the Macedonian army. Fearing the prospects of facing the powerful Nanda Empire armies and exhausted by years of campaigning, his army mutinied at the Hyphasis River, refusing to march further east. This river thus marks the easternmost extent of Alexander's conquests. > As for the Macedonians, however, their struggle with Porus blunted their > courage and stayed their further advance into India.

Alexander, seeing the unwillingness of his men agreed and diverted. Along the way his army conquered the Malli clans (in modern-day Multan). In the territory of the Indus, he nominated his officer Peithon as a satrap, a position he would hold for the next ten years until 316 BC, and in the Punjab he left Eudemus in charge of the army, at the side of the satrap Porus and Taxiles. Eudemus became ruler of a part of the Punjab after their death. Both rulers returned to the West in 316 BC with their armies. In 321 BC, Chandragupta Maurya founded the Maurya Empire in India and overthrew the Greek satraps. Return from India Alexander now sent much of his army to Carmania (modern southern Iran) with his general Craterus, and commissioned a fleet to explore the Persian Gulf shore under his admiral Nearchus, while he led the rest of his forces back to Persia by the southern route through the Gedrosian Desert (now part of southern Iran and Makran now part of Pakistan). According to Plutarch, during the 60-day march through the desert, Alexander lost three-quarters of his army to the harsh desert conditions along the way.Plutarch, The Life of Alexander, 66.

Ardenna was first used to refer to a seabird by Italian naturalist Ulisse Aldrovandi in 1603, and grisea is medieval Latin for \\"grey\\". In New Zealand, it is also known by its MƒÅori name , and as muttonbird, like its relatives the wedge-tailed shearwater (A. pacificus) and the Australian short-tailed shearwater (A. tenuirostris). It appears to be particularly closely related to the great shearwater (A. gravis) and the short-tailed shearwater, all blunt-tailed, black-billed species, but its precise relationships are obscure. In any case, these three species are among the larger species of shearwaters that have been moved into a separate genus Ardenna based on a phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial DNA. Description Up close, the chocolate-coloured plumage can be appreciated. Sooty shearwaters are 40‚Äì51 cm in length with a 94‚Äì to 110-cm wingspan. It has the typical \\"shearing\\" flight of the genus, dipping from side to side on stiff wings with few wing beats, the wingtips almost touching the water. Its flight is powerful and direct, with wings held stiff and straight, giving the impression of a very small albatross. This shearwater is identifiable by its dark plumage, which is responsible for its name. In poor viewing conditions, it looks all black, but in good light, it shows as dark chocolate-brown with a silvery strip along the center of the underwing. Usually loud, sooty shearwaters coo and croak while on the breeding grounds. In the Atlantic, it is the only such bird, whereas in the Pacific part of its range, other all-dark large shearwaters are found. The short-tailed shearwater in particular is almost impossible to tell apart from the present species at a distance. Distribution and movements Upper body of a bird swimming off the shore of California Sooty shearwaters breed on small islands in the south Pacific and south Atlantic Oceans, mainly around New Zealand, the Falkland Islands, Tierra del Fuego, and in the Auckland Islands and Phillip Island off Norfolk Island. They start breeding in October, and incubate their young for about 54 days. Once the chick hatches, the parents raise their chick for 86 to 109 days. They are spectacular long-distance migrants, following a circular route, traveling north up the western side of the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans at the end of the nesting season in March‚ÄìMay, reaching subarctic waters in June‚ÄìJuly, where they cross from west to east, then return south down the eastern side of the oceans in September‚ÄìOctober, reaching to the breeding colonies in November. They do not migrate as a flock, but rather as individuals, associating only opportunistically; in June 1906, for example, two were shot near Guadalupe Island off Baja California, Mexico, several weeks before the bulk of the population would pass by. Likewise, the identity of numerous large, dark shearwaters observed in October 2004 off Kwajalein in the Marshall Islands remain enigmatic; they might have been either sooty or short-tailed shearwaters, but neither species is generally held to pass through this region at that time. In the Atlantic Ocean, they cover distances in excess of from their breeding colony on the Falkland Islands (52¬∞S 60¬∞W) north to 60 to 70¬∞N in the North Atlantic Ocean off north Norway; distances covered in the Pacific are similar or larger; although the Pacific Ocean colonies are not quite so far south, at 35 to 50¬∞S off New Zealand, and moving north to the Aleutian Islands, the longitudinal width of the ocean makes longer migrations necessary. Recent tagging experiments have shown that birds breeding in New Zealand may travel 74,000 km in a year, reaching Japan, Alaska, and California, averaging more than 500 km per day. In Great Britain, they move south in late August and September; with strong north and north-west winds, they may occasionally become \\"trapped\\" in the shallow, largely enclosed North Sea, and heavy passages may be seen flying back north up the British east coast as they retrace their path back to the Atlantic over northern Scotland. Ecology and status A small portion of a huge flock off the shore of California, United States in September The sooty shearwater feeds on fish and squid. They can dive up to 68 m deep for food, but more commonly take surface food, in particular often following whales to catch fish disturbed by them. They also follow fishing boats to take fish scraps thrown overboard. They breed in huge colonies and the female lays one white egg. These shearwaters nest in burrows lined with plant material, which are visited only at night to avoid predation by large gulls. The architecture of sooty shearwater burrows can vary within and between breeding colonies, and is influenced by competition for breeding space and habitat type, with soil under dense tussac grass being easier to excavate than other substrates. In New Zealand, about 250,000 muttonbirds are harvested for oils and food each year by the indigenous MƒÅori population. Young birds just about to fledge are collected from the burrows, plucked, and often preserved in salt. Its numbers have been declining in recent decades, and it is presently classified as near threatened by the IUCN. In 2009, the harvest reported record-low catches, on average a trapping cage yielded nearly 500 birds; in 2009, the number was estimated to be closer to 40 per cage.

On August 6, 1926, she became the first woman to swim across the English Channel. Among other nicknames, the press sometimes called her \\"Queen of the Waves.\\"  Early years  Gertrude Ederle was born on October 23, 1905, in Manhattan, New York City. She was the third of six children and the daughter of German immigrants, Gertrude Anna Haberstroh and Henry Ederle.Gertrude Ederle becomes the first woman to swim the English Channel. History.com. Retrieved on May 20, 2014. According to a biography of Ederle, America's Girl, her father ran a butcher shop on Amsterdam Avenue in Manhattan. Her father taught her to swim in Highlands, New Jersey, where the family owned a summer cottage.  Amateur career  Ederle trained at the Women's Swimming Association (WSA), which produced such competitors as Ethelda Bleibtrey, Charlotte Boyle, Helen Wainwright, Aileen Riggin, Eleanor Holm and Esther Williams. Her yearly dues of $3 allowed her to swim at the tiny Manhattan indoor pool. But, according to America's Girl, \\"the WSA was already the center of competitive swimming, a sport that was becoming increasingly popular with the evolution of a bathing suit that made it easier to get through the water.\\" The director, Charlotte \\"Eppy\\" Epstein, had already urged the AAU to endorse women's swimming as a sport in 1917 and in 1919 pressured the AAU to \\"allow swimmers to remove their stockings for competition as long as they quickly put on a robe once they got out of the water.\\" That wasn't the only advantage of belonging to the WSA. The American crawl, a variation of the Australian crawl, was developed at the WSA by Louis Handley. According to America's Girl, \\"Handley thought the Australian crawl, in which swimmers did three kicks and then turned on their side to take a breath and do a scissors kick, could be improved ... The finished product ‚Äì and its eight-beat variation, which Ederle would use ‚Äì became the American crawl, and Handley was its proud father.\\" Along with Handley, Epstein made New York female swimmers a force to be reckoned with. Ederle joined the club when she was only twelve. The same year, she set her first world record in the 880-yard freestyle, becoming the youngest world record holder in swimming. She set eight more world records after that, seven of them in 1922 at Brighton Beach. In total, Ederle held 29 US national and world records from 1921 until 1925.International Swimming Hall of Fame, Honorees, Gertrude Ederle (USA). Retrieved on March 16, 2015. At the 1924 Summer Olympics in Paris, Ederle won a gold medal as a member of the first-place U.S. team in the 4√ó100 meter freestyle relay. Together with her American relay teammates Euphrasia Donnelly, Ethel Lackie and Mariechen Wehselau, she set a new world record of 4:58.8 in the event final.

Retrieved March 16, 2015. Ederle had been favored to win a gold in all three events and \\"would later say her failure to win three golds in the games was the biggest disappointment of her career.\\" Still, she was proud to have been a part of the American team that brought home 99 medals from the Paris Olympics. It was an illustrious Olympic team ‚Äì swimmer Johnny Weissmuller, oarsman Benjamin Spock, tennis player Helen Wills, and long- jumper DeHart Hubbard, who, according to America's Girl, was \\"the first black man to win an individual gold.\\" The U.S. Olympic team had its own ticker-tape parade in 1924.  Professional career In 1925, Ederle turned professional. The same year she swam the 22 miles from Battery Park to Sandy Hook in 7 hours and 11 minutes, a record time which stood for 81 years before being broken by Australian swimmer Tammy van Wisse.The Two River Times . Trtnj.com. Retrieved on May 20, 2014. Ederle's nephew Bob later described his aunt's swim as a \\"midnight frolic\\" and a \\"warm-up\\" for her later swim across the English Channel. The Women's Swimming Association sponsored Helen Wainwright and Ederle for an attempt at swimming the Channel. Helen Wainwright pulled out at the last minute because of an injury, so Ederle decided to go to France on her own. She trained with Jabez Wolffe, a swimmer who had attempted to swim the Channel 22 times. During the training, Wolffe continually tried to slow her pace, saying that she would never last at that speed. The training with Wolffe did not go well. In her first attempt at the Channel on August 18, 1925, she was disqualified when Wolffe ordered another swimmer (who was keeping her company in the water), Ishak Helmy, to recover her from the water. According to her and other witnesses, she was not \\"drowning\\" but resting, floating face- down. She bitterly disagreed with Wolffe's decision. Wolffe had previously commented that women may not be capable of swimming the Channel and it was speculated that he did not want Ederle to succeed. Her successful Channel swim ‚Äì this time training with coach Bill Burgess who had successfully swum the Channel in 1911 ‚Äì began approximately one year later at Cape Gris-Nez in France at 07:08 on the morning of August 6, 1926. She came ashore at Kingsdown, Kent, 14 hours and 34 minutes later. Her record stood until Florence Chadwick swam the Channel in 1950 in 13 hours and 20 minutes. Ederle used motorcycle goggles to protect her eyes from salty water, as did Burgess in 1911. However, while Burgess swam breaststroke, she used crawl, and therefore had her goggles sealed with paraffin to render them water tight. Ederle possessed a contract from both the New York Daily News and Chicago Tribune when she attempted the Channel swim a second time. The money she received paid her expenses and provided her with a modest salary. It also gave her a bonus in exchange for exclusive rights to her personal story. The Daily News and the Chicago Tribune got the jump on every other newspaper in America. Another American swimmer in France in 1926 to try and swim the Channel was Lillian Cannon from Baltimore. She was also sponsored by a newspaper, the Baltimore Post, which tried to create a rivalry between her and Ederle in the weeks spent training off the French coast. In addition to Cannon, several other swimmers, including two other American women ‚Äì Clarabelle Barrett and Amelia Gade Corson ‚Äì were training in England with the goal of becoming the first woman to swim the Channel. Barrett and Cannon were unsuccessful but three weeks after Ederle's feat, Corson crossed in a time that was 50 minutes slower than Ederle. For her second attempt at the Channel, Ederle had an entourage aboard the tug (the Alsace) on August 6, 1926, which included her father and one of her sisters, Meg, as well as Julia Harpman, wife of Westbrook Pegler and a writer for the New York Daily News, the paper that sponsored Ederle's swim. Harpman wouldn't allow reporters from other newspapers on the tug ‚Äì in order to protect her \\"scoop\\" ‚Äì and as a result a second tug was hired by the disgruntled reporters. On several occasions during the swim this tug (the Morinie) came in close to Ederle and nearly endangered her chances. The incident caused subsequent bitterness. It also led to accusations in the British press that the two tugs had in fact sheltered Ederle from the bad weather and thus made her swim \\"easier\\". During her twelfth hour at sea, Burgess, her trainer, had become so concerned by unfavorable winds that he called to her 'Gertie, you must come out!' The swimmer lifted her head from the choppy waters and replied, 'What for?' Only five men had been able to swim the English Channel before Ederle. The best time had been 16 hours, 33 minutes by Enrique Tiraboschi. Ederle walked up the beach at Kingsdown, England, after 14 hours and 34 minutes. The first person to greet her was a British immigration officer who requested a passport from \\"the bleary-eyed, waterlogged teenager.\\" (She was actually 20, not \\"a teenager,\\" when she successfully swam the Channel.) When Ederle returned home, she was greeted with a ticker-tape parade in Manhattan. More than two million people lined the streets of the parade route to cheer her. She made an arrangement with Edward L. Hyman to make a personal appearance at the Brooklyn Mark Strand, and she was paid an amount far greater than they had ever paid an individual performer prior.Ferguson, Lee. \\"Developments of Screen and Stage Shows Traced in Career of E. L. Hyman\\", Motion Picture News, New York, 7 January 1928. Retrieved on 13 June 2018. Subsequently, she went on to play herself in a movie (Swim Girl, Swim starring Bebe Daniels) and tour the vaudeville circuit, including later Billy Rose's Aquacade. She met President Coolidge and had a song and a dance step named for her. Her manager, Dudley Field Malone, was not able to capitalize on her notoriety, so Ederle's career in vaudeville wasn't a huge financial success. The Great Depression also diminished her financial rewards. A fall down the steps of her apartment building in 1933 twisted her spine and left her bedridden for several years, but she recovered well enough to appear at the 1939 New York World's Fair.  Death  The grave of Gertrude Ederle Ederle had poor hearing since childhood due to measles, and by the 1940s she was almost completely deaf. Aside from her time in Vaudeville, she taught swimming to deaf children. She never married and she was living in an old peoples home in 2001.

Via the Ohio River, it is part of the Mississippi River watershed. It is formed between Louisa, Kentucky, and Fort Gay, West Virginia, by the confluence of the Tug Fork and Levisa Fork. It flows generally northwardly in a highly meandering course, between Lawrence and Boyd counties in Kentucky and Wayne County in West Virginia. It joins the Ohio between Catlettsburg, Kentucky and Kenova, West Virginia, west of Huntington, West Virginia, at the common boundary between West Virginia, Kentucky, and Ohio. The river is navigable and carries commercial shipping, primarily coal mined in the immediate region. The name of the river comes from the presence of extensive sand bars. The Native American names for the river included Tatteroa, Chatteroi, and Chatterwha which had similar meaning to the English name. It was known to the Lenape as Sikeacepe, meaning \\"Salt River\\", from the presence of salt licks on the river (see: Licking River). The name \\"Big Sandy\\" was in use no later than February, 1789.

It rises in Auglaize County just west of Roundhead, Ohio, flows through Columbus, Ohio, where it collects its largest tributary, the Olentangy River, and meets the Ohio River at Portsmouth. Early settlers and Native Americans used the river for shipping\\"Scioto River ‚Äì Ohio History Central\\" but it is now too small for modern commercial shipping. The primary economic importance for the river now is for recreation and drinking water. It is the longest river that is entirely within Ohio. Geography and geology Hardin County, within of its source The lower Scioto River valley is large compared to the width of the river and is extensively farmed. Meltwaters from retreating glaciers carved the valley exceptionally wide. Valley bottoms are smooth, and flood deposits created during and since the most recent Glacial period cause floodplain soils to be very productive. As a result, farms line much of the lower Scioto where it flows through low, rolling hills covered in hardwood trees. The geologic history of the Scioto River is tied to the destruction of the Teays River network during the Ice Ages and consequent creation of the Ohio River. The north flowing Teays River was dammed by glaciers, and damming of other rivers led to a series of floods as lakes overflowed into adjacent valleys. Glacial Lake Tight is estimated to have been two-thirds the size of modern Lake Erie. Valleys beyond the reach of glaciers were reorganized to create the Ohio River, and the Scioto River replaced the Teays River. The Scioto River flows through segments of the Teays River valley but opposite the direction the Teays River flowed. In the cities of Columbus and Dublin, the river has cut a gorge in fossil-bearing Devonian limestone, and many tributary streams have waterfalls, such as Hayden Falls.  History  Chillicothe Scioto River in Columbus, Ohio The Scioto River valley was home to many Native American cultures. The best known groups are the Mound Builders of the Hopewell tradition with mounds constructed by the Adena people more than 2000 years ago. Numerous burial mounds can be seen near Chillicothe at the Hopewell Culture National Historic Park. The former strength of these cultures is demonstrated in settler accounts from as far east as Virginia. The name Scioto is derived from the Wyandot word ' ‚Äúdeer‚Äù (compare Shenandoah, derived from the word for deer in another Iroquoian language). During the antebellum years, the Scioto River provided a route to freedom for many slaves escaping from the South, as they continued north after crossing the Ohio River. Towns such as Chillicothe became important stops on the Underground Railroad. A traditional fiddle tune in the Appalachian repertoire, ‚ÄúBig Scioty‚Äù, takes its name from the river. The melody is attributed to the Hammons family of West Virginia. In 2012, the river dropped to record- or near-record-low water levels as a result of the acute effects of the 2012 North American drought in Ohio. Dams and reservoirs There are two major dams on the river. Griggs Dam in Columbus was built in 1904‚Äì1908 to impound a water supply for the city. Farther upstream, at Shawnee Hills, the O'Shaughnessy Dam was built in 1922‚Äì1925 creating a larger reservoir which was billed at the time as \\"the finest inland waterway in the United States.\\" Both dams are operated by the city of Columbus. The removal of the Main Street Dam in downtown Columbus, which was built in 1921, began in November 2013. The $35.5 million removal project was initially proposed in the 2010 Strategic Plan for downtown Columbus and was funded by a coalition of public and private entities. Prior to its demolition, the Main Street Dam impounded roughly of the Scioto River, artificially enlarging its width to an average of in downtown Columbus. Once completed, the Scioto Greenways project will reduce the width by nearly half, and expose of land which will be reclaimed as parkland by the city. Riffles and pools will be restored to the river channel, returning it to its natural riparian state. Experts believe the restoration project will result in a healthier river and better habitat for native plant, fish, and mussel species.

Brief plot summary An enormously wealthy older woman returns to her former hometown with a dreadful bargain: she wants the townspeople to kill the man who got her pregnant, then jilted her. In exchange, she will provide enough money to revitalize the decrepit town. The townspeople eventually agree. Plot =Act I= The story opens with the town of G√ºllen (a name evoking \\"liquid manure\\" in German) preparing for the arrival of famed billionaire Claire Zachanassian, who grew up there. G√ºllen has fallen on hard times, and the townspeople hope that Claire will provide them with much-needed funds. Anton Schill (Alfred Ill in the German-language version) is the owner of G√ºllen's general store and the most popular man in town. He was Claire's lover when they were young, and agrees with the mayor that the task of convincing her to make a donation should fall to him. After settling into the hotel, Claire joins the rest of the town, who have gathered outside for a homecoming celebration. Claire takes the opportunity to announce that she will make a huge donation: one billion (presumably Swiss francs), half for the town and half to be shared among the families. The townspeople are overjoyed, but their happiness is dampened when Claire's butler steps forward to reveal her condition for the donation. The butler was once the Lord Chief Justice of G√ºllen, and had heard the paternity suit that Claire had brought against Anton. In the suit, Anton produced two false witnesses (who have since been transformed into Claire's eunuchs), and the court ruled in his favor. Her donation is conditional on someone killing Anton. The mayor refuses and the town seems aghast, but Claire says that she will wait. =Act II= As time passes, Anton becomes increasingly paranoid as he sees everyone purchasing especially costly items on credit in his shop. Anton visits the police officer and the mayor, who have also bought new expensive items, and they dismiss his concerns. He then visits the priest, who attempts to calm him, but finally admits they have been paid off, and advises Anton to flee. Schill heads to the railway station to escape, but finds that the entire town is gathered there. They ask him where he is going, and he says that he is planning to move to Australia. They wish him well, again assuring him that he has nothing to fear in G√ºllen, but Schill grows increasingly nervous nonetheless. The train arrives, but he decides not to board, believing that someone will stop him anyway. Paralyzed, he collapses in the crowd, crying, \\"I'm lost!\\" =Act III= Claire weds a new husband in the G√ºllen cathedral. The doctor and the schoolmaster go to see her and explain that the townspeople have run up considerable debt since her arrival. The schoolmaster begs her to abandon her desire for vengeance and help the town out of the goodness of her heart. However, Claire informs him that she herself caused G√ºllen to fall on hard times, to ensure that the people would do anything for money. Anton's terror grows as the townspeople buy more expensive products on credit. Hearing of Claire's wedding, reporters are everywhere, and they enter the store to interview Anton. The schoolmaster, drunk, tries to inform the press about Claire's proposal, but the townspeople stop him. The schoolmaster and Anton have a discussion and the schoolmaster explains Anton will be killed. Anton accepts his guilt and acknowledges the town's suffering is his fault. Anton is then confronted by the mayor who asks if Anton will accept the town's judgment. Anton says that he will. Claire tells Anton that she never stopped loving him, but that over time her love has grown into something monstrous. When Anton arrives at the town meeting, it is flooded with the press, and the town publicly announces their acceptance of Claire's donation. The inhabitants then go through the formality of a vote, which is unanimous, and the mayor states that they have Anton to thank for their newfound wealth. The doors are locked and the lights dimmed. Anton is killed by a townsman. Just as a reporter reappears in the auditorium, the doctor announces that Anton has died of a heart attack. The reporters gather and declare that Anton has died of joy. Claire examines the body, gives the mayor his check, and leaves the town with Anton's body in the casket that she brought with her when she arrived. Themes =Main theme= The author often emphasized that The Visit is intended first and foremost as a comedy. However, it is difficult to ignore the serious, dark points being made about human nature throughout the play. The use of unsettling humor was popular among German-language authors of this period as a method of pointing out concerns they considered important. The main theme is that money corrupts even the most morally strong people. The main theme of the tragicomedy is also the utilitarianism and its manifestation seen in the play. Utilitarianism is an ethical theory which distinguishes right from wrong with respect to outcomes. The school of thought believes that the most ethical choice is one which benefits the majority. In the context of the play the driving force behind the persecution and execution of Ill is solely on the basis that his death will lead to the town being lifted from the pits of poverty as Claire would donate the one billion Swiss francs promised, resulting in an increase in living standards and economic prosperity. However, this comes at the cost of Ill's life, who represents the minority that suffers as a consequence of decisions made that benefit the majority. =Women's rights= Women did not achieve full suffrage in Switzerland until 1971 (in one canton until 1990); along with neighboring Liechtenstein it was the only European country to limit women's voting rights at the time. Women still lacked voting rights when the author refashioned the play as an opera libretto for Gottfried von Einem (premiered 1971). The sham vote at the end, where Claire has no say, followed by the false ascription of the town's new wealth to Anton, highlights this injustice in Swiss society. Symbolically, Claire lacks a hand and foot ‚Äì tools to control her destiny. She has been thrown by men into prostitution against her will. Satire =European art and history= In the play, D√ºrrenmatt uses the sold out museum in the city as a way to satirize the art and history of Europe. The G√ºllen museum talked about in the story sold everything it had to other museums located in America. This satirizes the idea that to learn about the history of Europe, one must travel to America. =Democracy= Democracy in The Visit can be seen satirized in Act III, where the townsfolk gather to vote on the issue of whether or not to kill Ill. This event also brings up the fact that everyone thinks that somebody will kill Ill, but it won't be them. In the end, the vote goes against Ill and he is killed for the reward. This gives readers an example of how a democracy can indeed be worse than other forms of government. =Human bodies as objects/human labor= A few examples of this subject arise in the play. One is Claire's prostitution, another is Ill's worth of a billion dollars. In Claire's case, D√ºrrenmatt pokes at the idea of selling one's body. He describes the prostitution as almost the same as labor jobs. He asks if there is a difference between those two occupations in terms of giving your body away for money. Alfred Ill's situation brings up another subject with the same kind of subject. Ill's body is priced at a billion dollars. This suggests that his body can be bought, sold, and consumed just like things in the economy. Ill's body is made into an object once Claire puts a price on him. Adaptations The play by the Maribor Slovene National Theatre in 1960 The Visit is a popular production to attend for German language students, as it is considered one of the keystones of twentieth century German-language literature. The play is also often used as a text for those taking German as a foreign language. Premiered as Besuch der alten Dame at Schauspielhaus Z√ºrich, Ruedi Walter played in 1956 the blind eunuch Loby. The original 1956 play by Friedrich D√ºrrenmatt was adapted for American audiences by Maurice Valency; this version features a number of significant alterations. Its first Broadway theatre production, in 1958, was directed by Peter Brook and starred Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne.New York Times, Maurice Valency 93 theatrical master dies In Spanish, it was performed in Teatro Espa√±ol, Madrid, in 1959, and in Catalan language it was created in Barcelona in 1962. The play was adapted as an opera libretto by the author and set to music by composer Gottfried von Einem, entitled Der Besuch der alten Dame and translated as The Visit of the Old Lady, and was first performed in 1971. In 1976 The Visit was adapted for Lebanese National Television \\"Tele Liban\\" (the only broadcasting station in Lebanon at that time) as the full sixth episode of the hit TV series \\"Allo Hayeti ÿ£ŸÑŸà ÿ≠Ÿäÿßÿ™Ÿä\\" directed for TV by Antoine Remi ÿ£ŸÜÿ∑ŸàÿßŸÜ ÿ±ŸäŸÖŸä, and Starring Hind Abi Al Lamaa ŸáŸÜÿØ ÿ£ÿ®Ÿä ÿßŸÑŸÑŸÖÿπ as Claire (or Clara as called in the Lebanese production) and Abdel Majeed Majzoob ÿπÿ®ÿØ ÿßŸÑŸÖÿ¨ŸäÿØ ŸÖÿ¨ÿ∞Ÿàÿ® as her lover Alfred, Layla Karam, Philip Akiki (as the Mayor) and Elias Rizk (as the teacher). This production made Friedrich D√ºrrenmatt known to the Lebanese public as well as to Arabic viewers. Ingrid Bergman and Anthony Quinn starred in a much-altered film adaptation, also called The Visit, directed by Bernhard Wicki, in 1964. A significant alteration is in the ending. Just as Alfred Ill (Serge Miller in the movie) is about to be executed on the trumped-up charges the town has created, the billionairess stops the execution. She declares that she will give the money to the town as pledged. Her revenge on Miller is that now, as she declares, he must live in the town among the people who would have executed him on false charges for money. In 1988 a TV movie titled Bring Me the Head Of Dobie Gillis was a version of The Visit adapted to the characters and world of The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis. In 1989 a TV movie titled –í–∏–∑–∏—Ç –¥–∞–º—ã (The Visit of the Lady) was created in the Mosfilm studio (Russia, at that time the USSR) Mira Stupica, famous Serbian actress performed character of Claire Zachanassian. Senegalese director Djibril Diop Mamb√©ty's film Hy√®nes, from 1992, is based on the play. The Visit was performed at Chichester Arts Festival of 1995. Players included Lauren Bacall and Joss Ackland. A fairly faithful musical The Visit, with music by John Kander, lyrics by Fred Ebb, and book by Terrence McNally, received its first production at Chicago's Goodman Theatre, starring Chita Rivera and John McMartin in 2001. That production was choreographed by Ann Reinking and directed by Frank Galati. The musical was revised and played from May 13 ‚Äì June 22, 2008, at Signature Theatre in Arlington, Virginia, in a production once again starring Rivera, this time with George Hearn. It received glowing reviews from the critics. In 2015, Chita Rivera and Roger Rees brought this adaptation of The Visit to Broadway when it began preview performances on March 26, 2015 at the Lyceum Theatre under the Tony Award-winning direction of John Doyle (Sweeney Todd, Company). It opened on April 23, 2015 and closed on June 14, 2015. The 95-minute production debuted in the summer of 2014 at the Williamstown Theater Festival, with choreography by Broadway veteran Graciela Daniele (The Rink, Ragtime). The Chilean telenovela Roman√© loosely use some elements of the plot in the script. It gives the story a slightly happier ending, though; the main characters aren't fully reconciled, but they manage to sort out their differences before Jovanka, the Claire equivalent, leaves the town. The Visit of the Old Lady (, 2006) is a faithful, dark adaption for TV from Estonian theatrical veterans Roman Baskin (director), Ita Ever (Claire) and Aarne √úksk√ºla (Ill). Tallinn, the capital of Estonia, substitutes for Guellen. ‚Ä≥The Visit‚Ä≥ 2016 production directed by Stan Wlasick and performed at El Rancho High School. A Russian language production, directed by Alexander Morfov, has been running in the repertoire of the Lenkom Theatre in Moscow since 2008. An adaptation entitled Miss Meena was performed in 2010 by Perch in Bengaluru.Rangashankara.org A second musical adaptation, starring Pia Douwes and Uwe Kr√∂ger, premi√®red at the Thun musical festival in Switzerland in the summer of 2013. It opens, with the same two leads, at the Ronacher Theatre, Vienna, in February 2014. Indian playwright Madhu Rye adapted the play as Sharat in the Gujarati language. A new English language adaptation written by Tony Kushner and directed by Jeremy Herrin is currently in previews at the National Theatre in London from February 11 to May 13, 2020. Starring Lesley Manville as Claire and Hugo Weaving as Alfred, this production likewise retains D√ºrrenmatt's original three-act structure (as does Valency's adaptation) but updated the location of the play from the town of G√ºllen to Slurry, New York. Paulo Coelho's The Devil and Miss Prym mentions the author, but not the story directly referenced; the concept of Coelho's book is based on the German 1956 play The Visit, by Friedrich D√ºrrenmatt.

In 1945, the village had 1,310 inhabitants, most of whom were Muslim and the remainder Christians. Al-Damun bordered the al-Na'amin River (Belus River), which the village's inhabitants used as a source of irrigation and drinking water from installed wells. History Excavations at the site has shown pot sherds dating from the Late Bronze Age, up to and including Early Islamic, Crusader, Mamluk and Ottoman times.Ronen, 1966. Cited in Stern, 2010, Ed-Damun Final Report It might be the village Damun in lower Galilee, noted in Roman times.Tsafrir et al, 1994 (TIR), pp. 107‚àí108; cited in Petersen, 2001, p. 131 Al-Damun is mentioned in early Arab and Persian sources since the 11th century CE. Local tradition identified the village as containing the tomb of the prophet Dhul- Kifl, who is mentioned in the Qur'an twice. Despite Islamic tradition claiming the tomb to be in al-Kifl near Najaf or Kifl Hares near Nablus, Nasir Khusraw believed it to be al-Damun when he visited the region in 1047. He writes \\"I reached a small cave, which is in Damun where I performed the ziyarat too, for it is said to be the tomb of Dhul-Kifl, peace be upon him.\\"Sharon, 2004, pp. 7-9Also in Le Strange, 1890, pp. 435, 436 Al-Damun was captured by the Crusaders, who referred to it as \\"Damar\\" or \\"Damor\\" during their invasion of Levant in 1099,Khalidi, 1992, p.11 and it remained in their hands unlike most of Palestine which was conquered by the Ayyubidss under Sultan Saladin in 1187. In 1253 John Aleman, Lord of Caesarea sold several villages, including al-Damun, to the Knights Hospitaller.Delaville Le Roulx, 1883, p. 184; cited in Clermont-Ganneau, 1888, pp. 309‚Äì310; cited in R√∂hricht, 1893, RRH, p. 319, No. 1210. It was mentioned as part of the Crusaders' domain in the hudna (truce agreement) between the Acre-based Crusaders and the Mamluks under Sultan al-Mansur Qalawun in 1283.Barag, 1979, p. 209 =Ottoman Empire= Al- Damun, like the rest of Palestine, was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, and in the census of 1596 the village was located in the Akka Nahiya (Subdistrict of Acre), part of the Safad Sanjak (District of Safed). The population consisted of 33 households and two bachelors, all Muslim. The inhabitants paid a fixed tax rate of 20% on wheat, barley, fruit trees, cotton, goats and beehives, in addition to \\"occasional revenues\\"; total revenue was 6,045 ak√ße.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 193Note that Rhode, 1979, p. 6 writes that the Safad register that H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah studied was not from 1595/6, but from 1548/9 Until the late 18th century the village was ruled by the Arab Zaydani clan, which rose to prominence in the Galilee through the campaigns of Sheikh Zahir al-Umar. They traced their lineage to the al-Zaydaniyya tribe which emigrated to Palestine from the Hejaz. The village mosque was built by a resident of al-Damun, Ali ibn Salih, who was also Zahir's uncle, in 1722-23. Inscriptions on the mosque entailed the genealogy of the Zaydani family and included a poem dedicated Ibn Salih. In the late 1700, :it:Giovanni Mariti noted that around Al-Damun and Mi'ar were two \\"delightful valleys, ornamented with groves and wild shrubs. The peasants who live in the hamlets around, enjoy a most pleasant situation.\\"Mariti, 1792, p. 343 A map by Pierre Jacotin from Napoleon's invasion of 1799 showed the place, named as Damoun.Karmon, 1960, p. 162 In 1875, al-Damun was prosperous and had roughly 800, mostly Muslim inhabitants and two mosques. In addition to the possible tomb of Dhul-Kifl, there was a shrine dedicated to a certain Sheikh Abdallah on an adjacent hill. An elementary school for boys was founded by the Ottomans in 1886.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP, I, p.270Gu√©rin, 1880, pp.424-425 A population list from about 1887 showed that Kh. ed Damun had about 725 inhabitants; all Muslims.Schumacher, 1888, p. 176 = British Mandate = At the time of the 1922 census of Palestine, al-Damun had a population of 727, of whom 687 were Muslims and 40 were Christians.Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub-district of Acre, p. 37. All the Christians were Roman Catholic.Barron, 1923, Table XXI, p. 50. The population increased in the 1931 census to 917; 870 Muslims and 47 Christians, living in a total of 183 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 100. At the beginning of the 20th century, al-Damun's houses were clustered along one road and starting in 1935, the residents started to build them with reinforced concrete. The inhabitants drew their drinking water from nearby springs and irrigated some of their crops from the Na'amin River. They also engaged in allied activities, particularly plaiting mats and baskets from esparto grass. The chief crops of al-Damun were wheat, sorghum, barley, and olives, but it was also well known for its watermelons and cantaloupes. In the 1945 statistics the population of al-Damun was 1,310; 1,240 Muslims and 70 Christians,Village Statistics The Palestine Government, April 1945 , p. 2. The village's total land area was 20,357 dunams of land according to an official land and population survey. 709 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 17,052 used for cereals,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics.

Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 130 Prior to the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, the Haganah kept files on all the Palestinian villages. The 1947 entry for al-Damun listed 25 individuals suspected of involvement with the Palestinian nationalist movement.Pappe, 2006, p. 22 In April 1948, Haganah reports say that the son of the main local land-owner, Sadiq Karaman, paid the local ALA garrison P¬£5000 to leave, presumably in an attempt to keep the village from getting involved with the hostilities in the 1948 Palestine war.15\\\\. April, note in the Haganah Archive, cited in Morris, 2004, pp. 97, 146 = Israel = After the initial Israeli successes in the central Galilee during the first stage of Operation Dekel, units of the Haganah's Sheva Brigade moved westward and captured al-Damun, among other Arab localities, in the second stage of the operation on July 15‚Äì16, 1948. However, Palestinian historian, Aref al-Aref, dates its capture earlier in May 1948, following the fall of Acre. Israeli historian Benny Morris reported that inhabitants were demoralized by the fall of Acre and then Nazareth, and so fled during the bombardment that preceded the attack on the village. The remaining residents were expelled and al-Damun itself was completely destroyed according to both historians. Following the war the area was incorporated into the State of Israel. The village's land is now used for agriculture by residents of the Yas'ur kibbutz, which itself was built on the land of al-Birwa. According to Palestinian historian, Walid Khalidi, in 1992, the site was \\"overgrown with thorns, cacti, olive trees, and pines. Stone and concrete rubble is scattered around it. The structure that formerly protected the central water source and regulated its flow stands untended and is collapsing in several places. The cemetery is extant, although the markers over a few graves are collapsing.\\" British historian Andrew Petersen writes that the village had a number of eighteenth or nineteenth-century stone houses, some which had decorated facades.Petersen, 2001, p. 131 See also *List of Arab towns and villages depopulated during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War References Bibliography         p. 89 External links *Welcome to al-Damun, palestineremembered.com *al- Damun, Zochrot *Survey of Western Palestine, Map 5: IAA, Wikimedia commons *Al-Damun, from the Khalil Sakakini Cultural Center *Al-Damun, Dr. Moslih Kanaaneh *Remembering al-Damun, Zochrot *Tour to the village of al-Damun, Saturday, 15.8.09, By Umar Ighbariyyeh, Zochrot Category:Arab villages depopulated during the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War Category:District of Acre ","title":"Al-Damun"},{"id":"335066","title":"Zell Miller"},{"id":"335068","title":"John Cornyn"},{"id":"335069","text":"Barbara Jill Walters (born September 25, 1929) is an American retired broadcast journalist, author, and television personality. Respected for her interviewing ability and popularity with viewers, Walters appeared as the host of numerous television programs, including Today, The View, 20/20, and the ABC Evening News. All told, Walters was a working journalist from 1952 until 2015. Walters began her career on The Today Show in the early 1960s as a writer and segment producer of women's interest stories. Her popularity with viewers resulted in Walters receiving more airtime, and in 1974 she became co-host of the program, the first woman to hold such a title on an American news program. In 1976, she continued to be a pioneer for women in broadcasting by becoming the first female co-anchor of a network evening news program, alongside Harry Reasoner on the ABC Evening News. From 1979 to 2004, Walters worked as a producer and co-host on the ABC newsmagazine 20/20. She also became known for an annual special aired on ABC, Barbara Walters' 10 Most Fascinating People. Walters also created, produced, and co-hosted the ABC daytime talk show The View, on which she appeared from 1997 until her retirement in 2014. Thereafter, she continued to host a number of special reports for 20/20 as well as documentary series for Investigation Discovery. Her final on-air appearance for ABC News was in 2015.

After about a year at a small advertising agency, she began working at the NBC network affiliate in New York City, WNBT-TV (now WNBC), doing publicity and writing press releases. She began producing a 15-minute children's program, Ask the Camera, directed by Roone Arledge in 1953. She began producing for TV host Igor Cassini (Cholly Knickerbocker). However, she left the network after her boss pressured her to marry him and engaged in a fist-fight with a man she preferred to date. Then she went to WPIX to produce the Eloise McElhone Show; it was canceled in 1954. She became a writer on The Morning Show at CBS in 1955. Career =The Today Show= Gene Shalit, Barbara Walters, and Frank McGee in The Today Show, 1973. After a few years as a publicist with Tex McCrary Inc. and a job as a writer at Redbook magazine, Walters joined NBC's The Today Show as a writer and researcher in 1961. She moved up to become that show's regular \\"Today Girl,\\" handling lighter assignments and the weather. In her autobiography, she describes this era before the Women's Movement as a time when it was believed that nobody would take a woman seriously reporting \\"hard news.\\" Previous \\"Today Girls\\" (whom Walters called \\"tea pourers\\") included Florence Henderson, Helen O'Connell, Estelle Parsons and Lee Meriwether.Audition, pp. 107‚Äì114 Within a year, she had become a reporter-at-large developing, writing, and editing her own reports and interviews.

She had a great relationship with host Hugh Downs for years. When Frank McGee was named host, he refused to do joint interviews with Walters unless he was given the first three questions. She was not named co- host of the show until McGee's death in 1974 when NBC officially designated Walters as the program's first female co-host. Beginning in 1971, she also hosted her own local NBC affiliate show, Not for Women Only, which ran in the mornings after The Today Show.Audition, p. 190 Barbara Walters in her office, as photographed by Lynn Gilbert in 1979. =ABC Evening News and 20/20= Walters has seldom minced words when describing the visible, on-the-air disdain her co-anchor Harry Reasoner displayed for her when she was teamed up with him on the ABC Evening News from 1976 to 1978. Reasoner had a difficult relationship with Walters, because he disliked having a co-anchor, even though he worked with former CBS colleague Howard K. Smith nightly on ABC for several years. In 1981, five years after the start of their short-lived ABC partnership and well after Reasoner returned to CBS News, Walters and her former co-anchor had a memorable (and cordial) 20/20 interview on the occasion of Reasoner's new book release. Walters is also known for her years on the ABC newsmagazine 20/20 where she reunited with former Today Show host Hugh Downs in 1979. Throughout her career at ABC, Walters has appeared on ABC news specials as a commentator, including presidential inaugurations and the coverage of 9/11. She was also chosen to be the moderator for the third and final debate between candidates Jimmy Carter and Gerald Ford, held on the campus of the College of William and Mary at Phi Beta Kappa Memorial Hall in Williamsburg, Virginia, during the 1976 presidential election.CNN: 1976 Presidential Debates. Retrieved on June 14, 2008. In 1984, she moderated a Presidential debate held at the Dana Center for the Humanities at Saint Anselm College in Goffstown, New Hampshire. Interviews Walters interviewing President Gerald Ford and Betty Ford in 1976. Walters is known for \\"personality journalism\\" and her \\"scoop\\" interviews. In November 1977, she achieved a joint interview with Egypt's President, Anwar Al Sadat, and Israel's Prime Minister, Menachem Begin. According to The New York Times, when she went mano a mano with Walter Cronkite to interview both world leaders, at the end of Cronkite's interview, he is clearly heard saying: \\"Did Barbara get anything I didn't get?\\" Her interviews with world leaders from all walks of life are a chronicle of the latter part of the 20th century. They include the Shah of Iran, Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, and his wife, the Empress Farah Pahlavi; Russia's Boris Yeltsin and Vladimir Putin; China's Jiang Zemin; the UK's Margaret Thatcher; Cuba's Fidel Castro, as well as India's Indira Gandhi, Czechoslovakia's V√°clav Havel, Libya's Muammar al-Gaddafi, King Hussein of Jordan, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, and Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez, among many others. Other interviews with influential people include pop icon Michael Jackson, actress Katharine Hepburn, Vogue editor Anna Wintour, and in 1980 Sir Laurence Olivier. Walters considered Robert Smithdas, a deaf-blind man who spent his life improving the lives of other individuals who are deaf- blind, as her most inspirational interview. Walters was widely lampooned for asking actress Katharine Hepburn, \\"If you were a tree, what kind would you be?\\" On her last 20/20 television episode, Walters showed video of the Hepburn interview, showing the actress saying that she would like to be a tree. Walters merely followed up with the question, \\"What kind of a tree?\\",Kate the Great, The Katharine Hepburn Forum ‚Äì The Barbara Walters Interview Retrieved May 10, 2008 and Hepburn responded \\"an oak\\" because they are strong and pretty. According to Walters, for years Hepburn refused her requests for an interview. And when she finally agreed to one, she said she wanted to meet her first. Walters walked in all smiles and ready to please, while Hepburn was at the top of the stairs and barked, \\"You're late. Have you brought me chocolates?\\" Walters hadn't but said she never showed up without them from then on. They had several other meetings since that first time, mostly in Hepburn's living room where she would give Walters her opinions. Careers and marriage did not mix. Children and careers were out of the question. Walters said Hepburn's opinions stuck with her so much, she could repeat them almost verbatim to this day. Her television special about Cuban leader Fidel Castro aired on ABC-TV on June 9, 1977. Although the footage of her two days of interviewing Castro in Cuba showed his personality, in part, as freewheeling, charming, and humorous, she pointedly said to him, \\"You allow no dissent. Your newspapers, radio, television, motions picture are under state control.\\" To this, he replied, \\"Barbara, our concept of freedom of the press is not yours. If you asked us if a newspaper could appear here against socialism, I can say honestly no, it cannot appear. It would not be allowed by the party, the government, or the people. In that sense we do not have the freedom of the press that you possess in the U.S. And we are very satisfied about that.\\" She concluded the broadcast of the interview by remarking, \\"What we disagreed on most profoundly is the meaning of freedom‚Äîand that is what truly separates us.\\" At the time, Walters kept quiet about seeing New York Yankees owner George Steinbrenner, pitcher Whitey Ford, and several coaches in Cuba, there to assist Cuban ballplayers. On March 3, 1999, her interview of Monica Lewinsky was seen by a record 74 million viewers, the highest rating ever for a news program. Walters asked Lewinsky, \\"What will you tell your children when you have them?\\" Lewinsky replied, \\"Mommy made a big mistake,\\" at which point Walters brought the program to a dramatic conclusion, turning to the viewers and saying, \\"And that is the understatement of the year.\\" =The View= The Views panel (left‚Äìright Whoopi Goldberg, Barbara Walters, Joy Behar, Sherri Shepherd and Elisabeth Hasselbeck) interview United States President Barack Obama on July 29, 2010. Walters was a co-host of the daytime talk show The View, of which she also is co-creator and co-executive producer with her business partner, Bill Geddie. It premiered on August 11, 1997. Walters described the show in its original opening credits as a forum for women of \\"different generations, backgrounds, and views.\\" She added, \\"Be careful what you wish for...\\" on the opening credits of its second season. Through The View, she was able to clinch two Daytime Emmy Awards for Best Talk Show in 2003 and Best Talk Show Host (with longtime host Joy Behar, moderator Whoopi Goldberg, Elisabeth Hasselbeck, and Sherri Shepherd) in 2009. Walters retired from being a co-host on May 15, 2014. Although retired, Walters returned as a guest co-host on an intermittent basis throughout 2014 and 2015. =Retirement= Since leaving her role as 20/20 co-host in 2004, Walters remained as a part-time contributor of special programming and interviews for ABC News until 2016. On March 7, 2010, Barbara Walters announced she would no longer hold Oscar interviews, but will still be working with ABC and on The View. In a November 2010 episode of The View, while interviewing Larry King on his retirement from CNN, Walters alluded to her impending retirement, stating, \\"I know when my time's coming.\\" On March 28, 2013, numerous media outlets reported that Barbara Walters would retire in May 2014 and that she would make the announcement on the show four days later. However, on the April 1 episode, Walters neither confirmed nor denied the retirement rumors; she said \\"if and when I might have an announcement to make, I will do it on this program, I promise, and the paparazzi guys -- you will be the last to know\\". Walters confirmed six weeks later that she would be retiring from television hosting and interviewing in May 2014, as originally reported; she made the official announcement on the May 13, 2013, episode of The View while also announcing that she will continue as the show's executive producer for as long as it's on the air. On June 10, 2014, it was announced that she would be 'coming out of retirement' in order to do a special 20/20 interview with Peter Rodger, the father of Elliot Rodger who had committed the 2014 Isla Vista killings. Since then, she has hosted special 20/20 episodes featuring interviews with Mary Kay Letourneau and Donald and Melania Trump. In 2015, Walters hosted the documentary series American Scandals on Investigation Discovery. Walters continued to host her 10 Most Fascinating People series in 2014 and 2015. Her final on-air interview was of presidential candidate Donald Trump for ABC News in December 2015. Walters last appeared publicly in 2016. Personal life Walters has been married four times to three different men. Her first husband was Robert Henry Katz, a business executive and former Navy lieutenant. They married on June 20, 1955, at The Plaza Hotel in New York City.\\"Katz‚ÄîWalters\\", The New York Times, June 21, 1955, page 36 The marriage was reportedly annulled after 11 months, or in 1957. Her second husband was Lee Guber, theatrical producer and theater owner. They married on December 8, 1963, and divorced in 1976. They have one daughter, Jacqueline Dena Guber (born 1968, adopted the same year). Her third husband was Merv Adelson, the CEO of Lorimar Television. They married in 1981 and divorced in 1984. They remarried in 1986 and divorced for the second time in 1992. She dated lawyer Roy Cohn in college; he said that he proposed marriage to Walters the night before her wedding to Lee Guber, but Walters denied this. She explained her lifelong devotion to Cohn as gratitude for his help in her adoption of her daughter, Jacqueline. In her autobiography, Walters says she also felt grateful to Cohn because of his legal assistance to her father. According to Walters, her father was the subject of an arrest warrant for \\"failure to appear\\" after he failed to show up for a New York court date because the family was in Las Vegas, and Cohn was able to have the charge dismissed. Walters testified as a character witness at Cohn's 1986 disbarment trial. Walters dated future U.S. Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan in the 1970s and was linked romantically to United States Senator John Warner in the 1990s. In Walters's autobiography Audition, she claimed that she had an affair in the 1970s with Edward Brooke, then a married United States Senator from Massachusetts. It is not clear whether Walters also was married at the time. Walters said they ended the affair to protect their careers from scandal. In 2007 she dated Pulitzer Prize-winning gerontologist Robert Neil Butler. Walters is close friends with Tom Brokaw and Woody Allen, and was close friends with Joan Rivers as well with former Fox News head Roger Ailes from the late 1960s until his death in 2017.Fehrman, Craig (January 21, 2011) When Roger Ailes was honest about what he does , Salon.com In 2014, Walters said she regretted not having more children. =Health= In May 2010, Walters said she would be having open heart surgery to replace a faulty aortic valve. She had known for quite a while that she was suffering from aortic valve stenosis, even though she was symptom-free. The procedure to fix the faulty heart valve \\"went well, and the doctors are very pleased with the outcome,\\" Walters's spokeswoman, Cindi Berger, said four days later. On July 9, 2010, it was announced that Walters would return to The View and her Sirius XM satellite show, Here's Barbara, in September 2010. Four years later, Walters retired permanently from both shows. Legacy Barbara Walters was inducted into the Television Hall of Fame in 1989. On June 15, 2007, Walters received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. She has won Daytime and Prime Time Emmy Awards, a Women in Film Lucy Award, and a GLAAD Excellence in Media award. Her impact on popular culture is illustrated by Gilda Radner's \\"Baba Wawa\\" impersonation of her on Saturday Night Live, featuring her idiosyncratic speech with its rounded \\"R\\". Her name also appeared in the January 23, 1995 New York Times Monday Crossword Puzzle. In 2008, she was honored with the Disney Legends award, given to those who made an outstanding contribution to The Walt Disney Company, which owns the network ABC. That same year, she received the Lifetime Achievement Award from the New York Women's Agenda. On September 21, 2009, Walters was honored with a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 30th Annual News and Documentary Emmy Awards at New York City's Lincoln Center. =Awards and nominations= * 1985: Paul White Award, Radio Television Digital News Association Daytime Emmy Awards * 1975 Award for Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Talk Show Host (Today) * 1998 Nomination for Best Talk Show (The View) * 1998 Nomination for Best Talk Show Host (The View) * 1999 Nomination for Best Talk Show (The View) * 1999 Nomination for Best Talk Show Host (The View) * 2000 Nomination for Best Talk Show (The View) * 2000 Nomination for Best Talk Show Host (The View) * 2001 Nomination for Best Talk Show (The View) * 2001 Nomination for Best Talk Show Host (The View) * 2002 Nomination for Best Talk Show (The View) * 2002 Nomination for Best Talk Show Host (The View) * 2003 Award for Best Talk Show (The View) * 2003 Nomination for Best Talk Show Host (The View) * 2006 Nomination for Best Talk Show (The View) * 2006 Nomination for Best Talk Show Host (The View) * 2007 Nomination for Best Talk Show (The View) * 2007 Nomination for Best Talk Show Host (The View) * 2008 Nomination for Best Talk Show (The View) * 2008 Nomination for Best Talk Show Host (The View) * 2009 Award for Daytime Emmy for Outstanding Talk Show Host (The View) (with Whoopi Goldberg, Joy Behar, Elisabeth Hasselbeck and Sherri Shepherd) * 2010 Nomination for Best Talk Show Host (The View) NAACP Image Award * 2009 Award for Best Talk Series (The View) * 2010 Nomination for Best Talk Series Women in Film Crystal + Lucy Award * 1998 Lucy Award in recognition of her excellence and innovation in her creative works that have enhanced the perception of women through the medium of television.Past Recipients .

To Walters's great surprise, the book was a success. As of 2008, it had gone through eight printings, sold hundreds of thousands of copies worldwide, and had been translated into at least six languages.

The official residence of the president is at Boyana Residence, Sofia. After the completion of the second round of voting, candidate Rumen Radev was elected President of Bulgaria on 13 November 2016. In Bulgaria, the president's role is primarily as a symbolic figure, with the main function being to be the 'arbitrator' of disputes between Bulgaria's different institutions. They are not considered head of government or part of the nation's executive power. The president is elected for a five-year term, which is renewable only once. After an individual has served two terms as President, that individual will forever be barred from being elected to the presidency again under the rules set out by Bulgaria's Constitution. The president addresses the nation on national television annually on New Year's Eve, just moments before the start of the new year.  Election  = Eligibility for election = For a Bulgarian citizen to be able to run for the office of President of Bulgaria, they must fulfil the following conditions: *Must be a Bulgarian citizen *Must be at least 40 years old *Must have lived in Bulgaria for the five years prior to the candidacy *Must fulfil all conditions that would be required for election as a representative to Bulgaria's National Assembly = Electoral system = The president is elected directly by the Bulgarian people in a two-round majoritarian election. If a candidate manages to obtain more than 50% of the vote in the first round, that candidate is elected. If no candidate manages to obtain more than 50% of the vote in the first round, then the two top- performing candidates face off in a second round with first-past-the-post voting, with the candidate receiving the larger number of votes considered elected.  Restrictions  The president is banned from also being a member of the National Assembly, as well taking on any other government, public or private offices for the duration of his term. The president is also constitutionally forbidden from being involved in a leadership position of a political party while in office. In practice, despite the fact that most candidates for President are elected from a political party's list and despite the fact that the Constitution doesn't forbid the president from being an ordinary member of a political party, it is widely expected in Bulgarian society that the president-elect renounce all affiliations with political parties once elected and serve as an independent politician. Powers and privileges The president of Bulgaria has a number of functions and powers that are regulated in Chapter 4 of the 1991 Constitution of Bulgaria. The president is elected directly by a popular vote for a period of five years which is renewable. = Presidential powers = The following powers belong to the president of Bulgaria: *The ability to give, restore or revoke Bulgarian citizenship, as well as refugee status. *Appoint and dismiss senior government officials *Exercise the right to pardon convicted criminals, as well as forgive 'uncollectible' debts owed to the government *Rename villages, towns and cities, as well as objects of national importance *Act as Supreme commander-in-chief of the Bulgarian Armed Forces *Represent Bulgaria at home and abroad *Schedule the National and local elections within the intervals designated by law *Veto any bill coming from the National Assembly by refusing to sign it after its passage in the assembly. *Declares war, martial law or any other state of emergency (This is done with the assistance of the Consultative Council on National Security) *Grant and award the orders, decorations, and medals of Bulgaria = Immunity = The president enjoys blanket legal immunity during his tenure and is not held responsible for any act performed while on duty, with the exception of treason or violation of the Bulgarian constitution. His authority may only be stripped via impeachment and may not be removed by any other institution. The president cannot be detained and may not be prosecuted.  Vice President  The president is assisted in these duties by the vice president of Bulgaria. The vice president replaces the president in case of absence. Only upon early termination of office of the vice president will assume the duties of president until elections are held. The Constitution permits the president to delegate to the vice president the powers to appoint and dismiss certain officials, issue pardons and amnesty, provide citizenship and refugee status, but does not allow the president to delegate any of his other powers., enjoys the same privileges of immunity as the president and can only be dismissed from his office under the same procedures as those regarding the president. Termination of office According to the constitution, the mandate of the president is completed if and when: *The presidential term expires *The president resigns before the Constitutional Court *The president is permanently unable to perform his/her duties due to serious illness *The president dies while in office *The president is impeached = Impeachment = Impeachment can only begin if the president has committed treason or has violated the Constitution of Bulgaria. Impeachment starts after at least a quarter of the members of the National Assembly deposit an accusatory act before the assembly. The act must then be approved by a supermajority of 2/3 of all elected representatives in order to be accepted. If accepted, the case is referred to the Constitutional Court of Bulgaria, which must decide within a one-month time span whether or not the president is guilty of the crime he has been accused of by the Assembly. If the constitutional court finds that the president has committed treason or violated the constitution, as per the accusatory act, then the president is considered successfully impeached and is stripped of his authority.

In presidential systems, the legislature has the power to pass a budget, but the executive often has a veto in which there are insufficient votes in the legislature to override. If no emergency provisions are made for the government's budget, a budget crisis may develop into a government shutdown in which the government temporarily suspends non-essential services until a budget is passed. Unlike parliamentary systems, where a loss of supply would trigger the immediate fall of the government, a budget crisis can often lead to an extended stand-off. At the federal level in the United States, a crisis can often be averted by a continuing resolution which appropriates funding at the same level as the previous budget. A budget crisis can also occur if the legislative branch has a constitutionally mandated dissolution or suspension date and the budget hasn't been passed up to that point. The term \\"budget crisis\\" could be used for situation where the executive branch freezes certain funds (impoundment) despite the directions of the law on annual budget already passed by parliament. Politically, a budget crisis may develop in a situation of disagreement between state and civil society. Constitutional economics is a field of economics and constitutionalism which describes and analyzes the specific interrelationships between constitutional issues and functioning of the economy including budget process. The standards of constitutional economics when used during annual budget planning, as well as the latter's transparency to the society, are of the primary guiding importance to the implementation of the rule of law. Also, the availability of an effective court system, to be used by the civil society in situations of unfair government spending and executive impoundment of any previously authorized appropriations, becomes a key element for the success of any influential civil society. Examples =United States federal government shutdown of 1995 and 1996= A particularly severe budget crisis occurred in the United States in November 1995, when the House of Representatives under Speaker Newt Gingrich and the administration of President Bill Clinton quarrelled over apportionments. The failure of the House and Clinton to pass a continuing budget resolution to apportion temporary funds forced a closure of most non-essential United States government offices for several weeks. =United States federal government shutdown of 2013= History repeated for the United States in 2013. It again occurred with a Democratic President, Barack Obama. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives boycotted the budget to protest the Affordable Care Act. The failure of the House to pass a continuing budget resolution forced a closure of most non-essential United States government offices for several weeks in October 2013. Uses in popular culture In the episode \\"Shutdown\\" of The West Wing, a budget crisis situation like the 1995-1996 federal government shutdown was depicted when Josiah Bartlet and Republican Speaker of the House Haffley disagree over budget cuts and shuts down the government for a number of days.

The survey team had been permitted to visit Germany only after President Truman had been subjected to increased pressure both by the American Congress and public. In January 1946 34 U.S. senators had petitioned that private relief organizations be allowed to help Germany and Austria, stating that the desperate food situation in occupied Germany \\"presents a picture of such frightful horror as to stagger the imagination, evidence which increasingly marks the United States as an accomplice in a terrible crime against humanity.\\"Steven Bela Vardy and T.

Materials processing  In metal processing, a reducing atmosphere is used in annealing ovens for relaxation of metal stresses without corroding the metal. A non oxidizing gas, usually nitrogen or argon, is typically used as a carrier gas so that diluted amounts of reducing gases may be used. Typically, this is achieved through using the combustion products of fuels and tailoring the ratio of CO:CO2. However, other common reducing atmospheres in the metal processing industries consist of dissociated ammonia, vacuum, and/or direct mixing of appropriately pure gases of N2, Ar, and H2. A reducing atmosphere is also used to produce specific effects on ceramic wares being fired. A reduction atmosphere is produced in a fuel fired kiln by reducing the draft and depriving the kiln of oxygen. This diminished level of oxygen causes incomplete combustion of the fuel and raises the level of carbon inside the kiln. At high temperatures the carbon will bond with and remove the oxygen in the metal oxides used as colorants in the glazes. This loss of oxygen results in a change in the color of the glazes because it allows the metals in the glaze to be seen in an unoxidized form. A reduction atmosphere can also affect the color of the clay body. If iron is present in the clay body, as it is in most stoneware, then it will be affected by the reduction atmosphere as well. In most commercial incinerators, exactly the same conditions are created to encourage the release of carbon bearing fumes. These fumes are then oxidized in reburn tunnels where oxygen is injected progressively. The exothermic oxidation reaction maintains the temperature of the reburn tunnels. This system allows lower temperatures to be employed in the incinerator section, where the solids are volumetrically reduced.  Planetary atmospheres  The same principle applies to planets. Many scientists think the early Earth had a reducing atmosphere, along with Mars, Venus and Titan. This would have proven to be a good environment for Cyanobacteria to evolve the first photosynthetic metabolic pathways which gradually increased the oxygen portion of the atmosphere, changing it to what is known as an oxidizing atmosphere. With increased levels of oxygen, the evolution of the more efficient aerobic respiration might have been enabled, allowing animal life to evolve and thrive. Though most scientists conceive of the early atmosphere as reducing, a 2011 article in Nature found that cerium oxidation in zircon‚Äîwhich comprises the oldest rocks on Earth at roughly 4.4 billion years of age‚Äîwas comparable to that of present-day lava. This observation implies that Hadean atmospheric oxygen levels were similar to those of today. The research raises questions about how the jump from inorganic compounds to life-supporting amino acids and DNA occurred on earth and suggests those building blocks were delivered from elsewhere in the galaxy. The results however do not run contrary to existing theories on life's journey from anaerobic to aerobic organisms. The results quantify the nature of gas molecules containing carbon, hydrogen, and sulphur in the earliest atmosphere, but they shed no light on the much later rise of free oxygen in the air. Although a hard vacuum, interplanetary space is reducing because solar wind consists mostly of hydrogen plasma. The Moon is directly exposed to solar wind, such that sodium is reduced and evaporated to produce the sodium tail of the Moon (see atmosphere of the Moon).

Located six kilometers west of the city of Nazareth, many of its inhabitants became internally displaced refugees, after taking refuge in NazarethRabinowitz, 1997, p. 27 and the neighbouring town of Yafa an- Naseriyye. Despite having never left the territory that came to form part of Israel, the majority of the villagers of Maalul, and other Palestinian villages like Andor and Al-Mujidal, were declared \\"absentees\\", allowing the confiscation of their land under the Absentees Property Law. Today, much of the former village's lands are owned by the Jewish National Fund. All that remains of its former structures are two churches, a mosque and a Roman era mausoleum, known locally as Qasr al-Dayr (\\"Castle of the monastery\\"). History In 1850, Rabbi Joseph Schwartz identified Ma'alul with the Biblical town of Nahalal.Keil, 1865, p. 194Schwarz, 1850, p. 172 =Ottoman era= Incorporated into the Ottoman Empire in 1517, Ma'alul appeared in the census of 1596, located in the nahiya (\\"subdistrict\\") of Tiberias under the liwa' (\\"district\\") of Safad with a population of seventy-seven. It paid taxes on a number of crops, including wheat and barley, as well as goats and beehives.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 189. Quoted in Khalidi, p. 346.Note that Rhode, 1979, p. 6 writes that the register that H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah studied was not from 1595/6, but from 1548/9 Ma'alul, and the neighbouring towns and villages of Nazareth, Mejdal, Yafa, Jebatha and Kneffis paid taxes to the monks of Nazareth, who bought the right to collect these taxes from the Ottoman authorities in 1777 for two hundred dollars. Thirty years later, they again purchased this right, though this time for two thousands five hundred dollars, owing to the rise in the price of cereals and ground rents.De Haas, 1934, p. 361 Pierre Jacotin called the village Matoun on his map from 1799.Karmon, 1960, p. 167 In 1859 the population was estimated to be 280, who cultivated 42 faddans of land.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, pp. 274 - 322- 335 Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 347 In 1875 Victor Gu√©rin found Ma'alul to have 350 inhabitants; all Muslim except about 30 \\"Schismatic Greeks.\\"Gu√©rin, 1880, pp. 387-390 By the late nineteenth century, the village was made of adobe bricks, built on a hill, Just outside the village was a magnificent Roman mausoleum, called Qasr al-Dayr.

In 1921 the Sursuqs sold all but 2,000 dunams of Ma'alul's land to the Zionist Palestine Land Development Company.a total of 16,000 dunams, with 90 families, according to List of villages sold by Sursocks and their partners to the Zionists since British occupation of Palestine, evidence to the Shaw Commission, 1930 Zionist pioneers founded the moshav of Nahalal on that land the same year. The remaining 2,000 dunums were insufficient to support the village's population, so at the request of the Mandate government, the company agreed to lease an additional 3,000 dunams to the villagers until 1927. The villagers had the option to buy this land before the lease expired. According to the British Mandate's 1922 census of Palestine, Ma'alul had 436 inhabitants; 186 Muslims and 250 Christians,Barron, 1923, Table XI, Sub- district of Nazareth, p. 38 where all the Christians were Orthodox.Barron, 1923, Table XVI, p. 50 By the 1931 census the population had decreased to 390; 228 Muslims, and 162 Christians, in a total of 90 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 74 In the 1945 statistics the population of Ma'alul was 690; 490 Muslims and 200 Christians, with a total of 4,698 dunams of land, according to an official land and population survey.

Its origin is in the region between the Western Ghats of southern India and the rainforests of Malaysia. The jack tree is well-suited to tropical lowlands, and is widely cultivated throughout tropical regions of the world. It bears the largest fruit of all trees, reaching as much as in weight, in length, and in diameter. A mature jack tree produces some 200 fruits per year, with older trees bearing up to 500 fruits in a year. The jackfruit is a multiple fruit composed of hundreds to thousands of individual flowers, and the fleshy petals of the unripe fruit are eaten. The ripe fruit is sweet (depending on variety) and is more often used for desserts. Canned jackfruit has a mild taste and meat-like texture that lends itself to being called a \\"vegetable meat\\". Jackfruit is commonly used in South and Southeast Asian cuisines.The encyclopedia of fruit & nuts, By Jules Janick, Robert E. Paull, pp. 481‚Äì485 Both ripe and unripe fruits are consumed. The jackfruit is the national fruit of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, and the state fruit of the Indian states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. It is available internationally canned or frozen and in chilled meals as are various products derived from the fruit such as noodles and chips. Etymology and history Jackfruit tree illustrated from one of the earliest natural history books about China by Jesuit Missionary author Michael Boym in 1656. The word jackfruit comes from Portuguese , which in turn is derived from the Malayalam language term (Malayalam: ), when the Portuguese arrived in India at Kozhikode (Calicut) on the Malabar Coast (Kerala) in 1499. Later the Malayalam name () was recorded by Hendrik van Rheede (1678‚Äì1703) in the , vol. iii in Latin. Henry Yule translated the book in Jordanus Catalani's () Mirabilia descripta: the wonders of the East. This term is in turn derived from the Proto-Dravidian root (\\"fruit, vegetable\\"). The common English name \\"jackfruit\\" was used by physician and naturalist Garcia de Orta in his 1563 book .Oxford English Dictionary, Second Edition, 1989, online edition Centuries later, botanist Ralph Randles Stewart suggested it was named after William Jack (1795‚Äì1822), a Scottish botanist who worked for the East India Company in Bengal, Sumatra, and Malaya. The jackfruit was domesticated independently in South Asia and Southeast Asia, as evidenced by the fact that the Southeast Asian names for the fruit are not derived from the Sanskrit roots. It was probably first domesticated by Austronesians in Java or the Malay Peninsula. The word for jackfruit in Proto-Western-Malayo-Polynesian is reconstructed as . Modern cognates include Javanese, Malay, Balinese, and Cebuano ; Tagalog, Pangasinan, Bikol and Ilocano ; Chamorro or ; Kelabit ; Wolio ; Ibaloi ; and Lun Dayeh . Note, however, that the fruit was only recently introduced to Guam via Filipino settlers when both were part of the Spanish Empire.  Botanical description  Jackfruit tree trunk showing texture and coloration = Shape, trunk and leaves = Artocarpus heterophyllus grows as an evergreen tree that has a relatively short trunk with a dense treetop. It easily reaches heights of and trunk diameters of . It sometimes forms buttress roots. The bark of the jackfruit tree is reddish- brown and smooth. In the event of injury to the bark, a milky juice is released. The leaves are alternate and spirally arranged. They are gummy and thick and are divided into a petiole and a leaf blade. The petiole is long. The leathery leaf blade is long, and wide and is oblong to ovate in shape. In young trees, the leaf edges are irregularly lobed or split. On older trees, the leaves are rounded and dark green, with a smooth leaf margin. The leaf blade has a prominent main nerve and starting on each side six to eight lateral nerves. The stipules are egg-shaped at a length of . = Flowers and fruit = Flower buds and leaves of a jackfruit tree Jackfruit tree with fruits Jack fruits in Kerala The inflorescences are formed on the trunk, branches or twigs (caulifloria). Jackfruit trees are monoecious, having both female and male flowers on a tree. The inflorescences are pedunculated, cylindrical to ellipsoidal or pear-shaped, to about long and wide. Inflorescences are initially completely enveloped in egg-shaped cover sheets which rapidly slough off. The flowers are small, sitting on a fleshy rachis. The male flowers are greenish, some flowers are sterile. The male flowers are hairy and the perianth ends with two membrane. The individual and prominent stamens are straight with yellow, roundish anthers. After the pollen distribution, the stamens become ash-gray and fall off after a few days. Later all the male inflorescences also fall off. The greenish female flowers, with hairy and tubular perianth, have a fleshy flower-like base. The female flowers contain an ovary with a broad, capitate or rarely bilobed scar. The blooming time ranges from December until February or March. The ellipsoidal to roundish fruit is a multiple fruit formed from the fusion of the ovaries of multiple flowers. The fruits grow on a long and thick stem on the trunk. They vary in size and ripen from an initially yellowish-greenish to yellow, and then at maturity to yellowish-brown. They possess a hard, gummy shell with small pimples surrounded with hard, hexagonal tubercles. The large and variously shaped fruit have a length of and a diameter of and can weigh or more. The fruits consist of a fibrous, whitish core (rachis) about thick. Radiating from this are many individual fruits. They are elliptical to egg-shaped, light brownish achenes with a length of about and a diameter of . There may be about 100‚Äì500 seeds per fruit. The seed coat consists of a thin, waxy, parchment- like and easily removable testa (husk) and a brownish, membranous tegmen. The cotyledons are usually unequal in size, and the endosperm is minimally present. An average fruit consists of 27% edible seed coat, 15% edible seeds, 20% white pulp (undeveloped perianth, rags) and bark and 10% core. The fruit matures during the rainy season from July to August. The bean-shaped achenes of the jackfruit are coated with a firm yellowish aril (seed coat, flesh), which has an intense sweet taste at maturity of the fruit. The pulp is enveloped by many narrow strands of fiber (undeveloped perianth), which run between the hard shell and the core of the fruit and are firmly attached to it. When pruned, the inner part (core) secretes a sticky, milky liquid, which can hardly be removed from the skin, even with soap and water. To clean the hands after \\"unwinding\\" the pulp an oil or other solvent is used. For example, street vendors in Tanzania, who sell the fruit in small segments, provide small bowls of kerosene for their customers to cleanse their sticky fingers. When fully ripe, jackfruit has a strong pleasant aroma, the pulp of the opened fruit resembles the odor of pineapple and banana. As food Jackfruit flesh Ripe jackfruit is naturally sweet, with subtle pineapple- or banana-like flavoring. It can be used to make a variety of dishes, including custards, cakes, or mixed with shaved ice as es teler in Indonesia or halo-halo in the Philippines. For the traditional breakfast dish in southern India, idlis, the fruit is used with rice as an ingredient and jackfruit leaves are used as a wrapping for steaming. Jackfruit dosas can be prepared by grinding jackfruit flesh along with the batter. Ripe jackfruit arils are sometimes seeded, fried, or freeze-dried and sold as jackfruit chips.219x219pxThe seeds from ripe fruits are edible, and are said to have a milky, sweet taste often compared to Brazil nuts. They may be boiled, baked, or roasted. When roasted, the flavor of the seeds is comparable to chestnuts. Seeds are used as snacks (either by boiling or fire-roasting) or to make desserts. In Java, the seeds are commonly cooked and seasoned with salt as a snack. They are commonly used in curry in India in the form of a traditional lentil and vegetable mix curry. Young leaves are tender enough to be used as a vegetable. =Aroma= Jackfruit has a distinctive sweet and fruity aroma. In a study of flavour volatiles in five jackfruit cultivars, the main volatile compounds detected were ethyl isovalerate, propyl isovalerate, butyl isovalerate, isobutyl isovalerate, 3-methylbutyl acetate, 1-butanol, and 2-methylbutan-1-ol. A fully ripe and unopened jackfruit is known to \\"emit a strong aroma\\" ‚Äì perhaps unpleasant ‚Äì with the inside of the fruit described as smelling of pineapple and banana. After roasting, the seeds may be used as a commercial alternative to chocolate aroma. =Nutritional value= The edible pulp is 74% water, 23% carbohydrates, 2% protein, and 1% fat. The carbohydrate component is primarily sugars, and is a source of dietary fiber. In a portion, raw jackfruit provides , and is a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of vitamin B6 (25% DV). It contains moderate levels (10-19% DV) of vitamin C and potassium, with no other micronutrients in significant content. Jackfruit seeds The jackfruit is a partial solution for food security in developing countries. =Culinary uses= The flavor of the ripe fruit is comparable to a combination of apple, pineapple, mango, and banana. Varieties are distinguished according to characteristics of the fruit flesh. In Indochina, the two varieties are the \\"hard\\" version (crunchier, drier, and less sweet, but fleshier), and the \\"soft\\" version (softer, moister, and much sweeter, with a darker gold-color flesh than the hard variety). Unripe jackfruit has a mild flavor and meat-like texture and is used in curry dishes with spices in many cuisines. The skin of unripe jackfruit must be peeled first, then the remaining jackfruit flesh is chopped in a labor-intensive process into edible portions and cooked before serving. The final chunks resemble prepared artichoke hearts in their mild taste, color, and flowery qualities. The cuisines of many Asian countries use cooked young jackfruit. In many cultures, jackfruit is boiled and used in curries as a staple food. The boiled young jackfruit is used in salads or as a vegetable in spicy curries and side dishes, and as fillings for cutlets and chops. It may be used by vegetarians as a substitute for meat such as pulled pork. It may be cooked with coconut milk and eaten alone or with meat, shrimp or smoked pork. In southern India, unripe jackfruit slices are deep-fried to make chips. South Asia In Bangladesh, the fruit is consumed on its own. The unripe fruit is used in curry, and the seed is often dried and preserved to be later used in curry. In India, two varieties of jackfruit predominate: muttomvarikka and sindoor. Muttomvarikka has a slightly hard inner flesh when ripe, while the inner flesh of the ripe sindoor fruit is soft. A sweet preparation called chakkavaratti (jackfruit jam) is made by seasoning pieces of muttomvarikka fruit flesh in jaggery, which can be preserved and used for many months. The fruits are either eaten alone or as a side to rice. The juice is extracted and either drunk straight or as a side. The juice is sometimes condensed and eaten as candies. The seeds are either boiled or roasted and eaten with salt and hot chilies. They are also used to make spicy side dishes with rice. Jackfruit may be ground and made into a paste, then spread over a mat and allowed to dry in the sun to create a natural chewy candy.

The ripe fruit is usually sold separately and consumed on its own, or sliced and mixed with shaved ice as a sweet concoction dessert such as es campur and es teler. The ripe fruit might be dried and fried as kripik nangka, or jackfruit cracker. The seeds are boiled and consumed with salt, as they contain edible starchy content; this is called beton. Young (unripe) jackfruit is made into curry called gulai nangka or stewed called gudeg. In the Philippines, jackfruit is called langka in Filipino and ' in Cebuano. The unripe fruit is usually cooked in coconut milk and eaten with rice; this is called ginataang langka. The ripe fruit is often an ingredient in local desserts such as halo-halo and the Filipino turon. The ripe fruit, besides also being eaten raw as it is, is also preserved by storing in syrup or by drying. The seeds are also boiled before being eaten. Thailand is a major producer of jackfruit, which are often cut, prepared, and canned in a sugary syrup (or frozen in bags or boxes without syrup) and exported overseas, frequently to North America and Europe. In Vietnam, jackfruit is used to make jackfruit ch√®, a sweet dessert soup, similar to the Chinese derivative bubur cha cha. The Vietnamese also use jackfruit pur√©e as part of pastry fillings or as a topping on x√¥i ng·ªçt (a sweet version of sticky rice portions). Jackfruits are found primarily in the eastern part of Taiwan. The fresh fruit can be eaten directly or preserved as dried fruit, candied fruit, or jam. It is also stir-fried or stewed with other vegetables and meat.

When prepared in this way, jackfruit has the look and texture of meat and is used as a meat substitute. In Brazil, three varieties are recognized: jaca-dura, or the \\"hard\\" variety, which has a firm flesh, and the largest fruits that can weigh between 15 and 40 kg each; jaca-mole, or the \\"soft\\" variety, which bears smaller fruits with a softer and sweeter flesh; and jaca-manteiga, or the \\"butter\\" variety, which bears sweet fruits whose flesh has a consistency intermediate between the \\"hard\\" and \\"soft\\" varieties.General information , Department of Agriculture, State of Bahia Africa From a tree planted for its shade in gardens, it became an ingredient for local recipes using different fruit segments. The seeds are boiled in water or roasted to remove toxic substances, and then roasted for a variety of desserts. The flesh of the unripe jackfruit is used to make a savory salty dish with smoked pork. The jackfruit arils are used to make jams or fruits in syrup, and can also be eaten raw. Wood and manufacturing The golden yellow timber with good grain is used for building furniture and house construction in India. It is termite-proof and is superior to teak for building furniture. The wood of the jackfruit tree is important in Sri Lanka and is exported to Europe. Jackfruit wood is widely used in the manufacture of furniture, doors and windows, in roof construction, and fish sauce barrels. The wood of the tree is used for the production of musical instruments. In Indonesia, hardwood from the trunk is carved out to form the barrels of drums used in the gamelan, and in the Philippines, its soft wood is made into the body of the kutiyapi, a type of boat lute. It is also used to make the body of the Indian string instrument veena and the drums mridangam, thimila, and kanjira. Cultural significance The jackfruit has played a significant role in Indian agriculture for centuries. Archeological findings in India have revealed that jackfruit was cultivated in India 3000 to 6000 years ago. It has also been widely cultivated in Southeast Asia. The ornate wooden plank called avani palaka, made of the wood of the jackfruit tree, is used as the priest's seat during Hindu ceremonies in Kerala. In Vietnam, jackfruit wood is prized for the making of Buddhist statues in temples The heartwood is used by Buddhist forest monastics in Southeast Asia as a dye, giving the robes of the monks in those traditions their distinctive light-brown color.Forest Monks and the Nation-state: An Anthropological and Historical Study in Northeast Thailand, J.L. Taylor 1993 p. 218 Jackfruit is the national fruit of Bangladesh, and the state fruit of the Indian states of Kerala and Tamil Nadu. Cultivation In terms of taking care of the plant, minimal pruning is required; cutting off dead branches from the interior of the tree is only sometimes needed. In addition, twigs bearing fruit must be twisted or cut down to the trunk to induce growth for the next season. Branches should be pruned every three to four years to maintain productivity. Some trees carry too many mediocre fruits and these are usually removed to allow the others to develop better to maturity. Stingless bees such as Tetragonula iridipennis are jackfruit pollinators, and so play an important role in jackfruit cultivation. =Production and marketing= In 2017, India produced 1.4 million tonnes of jackfruit, followed by Bangladesh, Thailand, and Indonesia. The marketing of jackfruit involves three groups: producers, traders, and middlemen, including wholesalers and retailers. The marketing channels are rather complex. Large farms sell immature fruit to wholesalers, which helps cash flow and reduces risk, whereas medium-sized farms sell the fruit directly to local markets or retailers.

It is also extensively cultivated in the Brazilian coastal region, where it is sold in local markets. It is available canned in sugary syrup, or frozen, already prepared and cut. Jackfruit industries are established in Sri Lanka and Vietnam, where the fruit is processed into products such as flour, noodles, papad, and ice cream. It is also canned and sold as a vegetable for export. Jackfruit is also widely available year-round, both canned and dried. Dried jackfruit chips are produced by various manufacturers. As reported in 2019, jackfruit became more widely available in US grocery stores, cleaned and ready to cook, as well as in premade dishes or prepared ingredients. It is on restaurant menus in preparations such as pulled pork and taco filling. Invasive species In Brazil, the jackfruit can become an invasive species as in Brazil's Tijuca Forest National Park in Rio de Janeiro. The Tijuca is mostly an artificial secondary forest, whose planting began during the mid- nineteenth century; jackfruit trees have been a part of the park's flora since it was founded. The species has expanded excessively because its fruits, which naturally fall to the ground and open, are eagerly eaten by small mammals, such as the common marmoset and coati. The seeds are then dispersed by these animals, spreading jackfruit trees that compete for space with native tree species. The supply of jackfruit has allowed the marmoset and coati populations to expand. Since both prey opportunistically on bird eggs and nestlings, the increases in marmoset and coati populations are detrimental to local birds.

Lubya had a total land area of 39,629 dunams (3,963ha), of which 83% was Arab-owned and the remainder public property. Most of its cultivable land was planted with cereals while only 1,500 dunams (150 ha) were planted with olive groves. The village's built-up area was 210 dunams (21 ha).

This site was probably a caravansary during medieval times.Gu√©rin, 1880, p. 185 In the early 19th century, James Silk Buckingham described Lubya as a very large village on top of a high hill.Buckingham, 1821, p. 491 Johann Ludwig Burckhardt, a Swiss traveler to Palestine, referred to the village as \\"Louby\\" and noted that wild artichokes covered the village plain.Burckhardt, 1822, p. 333 The American scholar Robinson, who passed through the village in 1838, noted that it had suffered greatly from the Galilee earthquake of 1837, with 143 villagers reported dead.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, p. 238 Mark Twain mentioned it in his 1869 travel book, \\"The Innocents Abroad\\": \\"We jogged along peacefully over the great caravan route from Damascus to Jerusalem and Egypt, past Lubia and other Syrian hamlets, perched, in the unvarying style, upon the summit of steep mounds and hills, and fenced round about with giant cactuses\\".Twain, 1869, p. 519 In 1875, the French explorer Victor Gu√©rin visited the village, called Loubieh, and estimated it had 700 inhabitants.Gu√©rin, 1880, p. 184 He further noted that: \\"A house built of cut stones of medium size in the direction of east and west appears to occupy the site, and to be built out of old materials formerly used for a Christian Church\\"Gu√©rin, 1880, p. 184, as translated by Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 412 Later that century, the village was described as being built of stone, on top of a limestone hill. Its population, estimated to be between 400 and 700, cultivated olive and fig trees.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 361. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 527 A population list from about 1887 showed Lubieh to have about 2,730 inhabitants; all Muslims.Schumacher, 1888, p. 185 An elementary school was established in 1895 and remained in use throughout the rule of the British Mandate of Palestine from 1923-1947. =British Mandate era= In the 1922 census of Palestine conducted by the British Mandate authorities the population was 1,712; 1,705 Muslims, four Christians and three Druze,Barron, 1923, Table IX, Sub-district of Tiberias, p. 39 increasing in the 1931 census to 1,850; 1,849 Muslims and one Christian, in a total of 405 houses.Mills, 1932, p. 83 During this period, Lubya was the second largest village in the Tiberias District.Khalidi, 1992, p. 527 According to the Palestine Government's village statistics, Lubya had a population of 2,350 in 1945 statistics, all Muslim.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 72 All the inhabitants were Muslim.Village Statistics April 1945, The Palestine Government , p. 7 The total land area was 39,629 dunams. Of this, a total of 1,655 dunams were for plantations and irrigable land, 32,310 for cereals,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 122 while a total of 210 dunams were built-up land.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 172 =Occupation by Israel= At the onset of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War Lubya was being defended by local militia volunteers. Village forces constantly skirmished with the Jewish militias which would soon become the Israeli Army; the first Israeli raid on the village occurred on January 20, 1948, coordinated with one on nearby Tur'an, leaving one Lubya resident dead. On February 24, local militiamen and Arab Liberation Army (ALA) members ambushed a Jewish convoy on the village's outskirts, causing several casualties, including one militiaman. The attack signaled that the Israelis were unable to keep the roads open and that foreign volunteers (the ALA) were taking over the offensive in the eastern Galilee.Tal, 2004, p.69 In early March, Israeli forces attempted to create a route between Tiberias and the village of Shajara, which required attacking Lubya. During the attack militiamen repulsed the Israelis, killing seven and losing six of their own. After Tiberias was occupied by Israel, Lubya turned to the ALA in nearby Nazareth for military support and guidance. In early June, the 14th. battalion from the Golani Brigade was ordered to take Lubya and \\"to expel its inhabitants.\\" However, the attack failed, due to heavy resistance from the villagers.Morris, 2004, p. 262, note 810 p. 308 based on report IDFArchive 665\\\\51\\\\\\\\\\\\2 The ALA attacked the Jewish town of Sejera on June 10 at the time when a truce was being brokered between Lubya's militiamen and Israeli forces. After the truce expired on July 16, Israel launched Operation Dekel, capturing Nazareth at the start. After news of Nazareth's fall, the majority of non-combatant village residents fled north towards Lebanon or to nearby Arab towns. The ALA also withdrew, leaving the local militia to confront incoming forces. When a single Israeli armored unit appeared outside the village, the militia retreated and left the village. The few remaining residents reported that Israeli forces subsequently shelled Lubya, demolished a few houses and commandeered many others. The village was finally demolished in the 1960s.Aron Shai, The Fate of Abandoned Arab Villages in Israel, 1965‚Äì1969, History & Memory, Vol. 18, Number 2, Fall/Winter 2006, pp. 86-106. The Israeli town of Lavi was built on Lubya's land, northeast of the village site. There are also two parks on the village lands: the Lavi Pine Forest and the South African Park. They are used as picnic grounds for local residents, including former residents of Lubya who are internally displaced persons living in various existing Arab localities in Israel.Davis, 2003, pp. 55-58 In the 1990s, two books were published about Lubya by Ibrahim Yahya Al- Shahabi, one under the auspices of Birzeit University,Davis, 2011, p. 285 and one book about Lubya was published in Denmark, in 1995, by Mahmoud Issa.Issa, 1995, Palestinians from Lubya in Denmark: Dreams and Realities Demographics The village's population rose and dropped dramatically throughout its history; In 1596, Lubya had a population of 1,177 dropping to about 400‚Äì700 in the beginning of the 19th century. The village's residents predominantly adhered to Islam. It was estimated that there was 16,741 Palestinian refugees descending from Lubya in 1998.Welcome to Lubya: Towns Statistics and Facts Palestine Remembered. After 1948, the majority of refugees lived at the Wavel refugee camp in Lebanon and other places in Lebanon, Jordan and Syria.Mahmoud Issa, Resisting oblivion: Historiography of the destroyed Palestinian village of Lubya, Refuge, Vol. 21, No. 2, 2003, pp. 14‚Äì22 A few hundred remained in Israel as present absentees, living first in Kafr Kana.Rassem Khamaisi, Land ownership as a determinant in the formation of residential areas in Arab localities, Geoforum, Vol. 26, No.2 1995, pp211‚Äì224. After the departure of the PLO from Lebanon in 1983 and the Sabra and Shatila massacres, many Lubya refugees emigrated from Lebanon to Europe. By 2003 about 2,000 lived in Denmark, Sweden and Germany.

By type = Directed-energy weapons = Directed-energy weapons (DEW) figure prominently in the Star Wars franchise, with the most common type referred to as lasers or blasters. The in-universe description for how these weapons function is that a high-energy gas is charged by a power cell and converted into plasma, which is fired as a coherent energy bolt at the enemy via magnetic bottle effect. Small-arms blasters come in many types, from pistols to rifles, with accuracy and range improving as barrel length increases.Luceno, et al. (2018), p. 15 Blaster cannons and laser cannons are more powerful types of these weapons commonly found on Star Wars vehicles, starfighters and other spacecraft, with laser cannons generally considered superior of the two. The most powerful type of these weapons are referred to as turbolasers, commonly found on Star Wars capital ships. Turbolasers require large crews and power generators to function but are effective against other capital ships and planetary targets. Another common type of DEW in the Star Wars universe is the ion weapon, which background literature describes as firing powerful bolts of ionized energy designed to overload electrical systems or fuse mechanical components, disabling a target without causing lasting damage.Luceno, et al. (2019), p. 14 An example of this weapon is the v-150 Planet Defender which appears in The Empire Strikes Back defending the Rebel base on Hoth. A surface-based ion cannon designed to ward off orbiting starships, the v-150 is described as having a maximum range of and is powerful enough to disrupt an Imperial Star Destroyer with a single bolt.Barr, et al. (2019), p. 282 A unique type of DEW appearing in Star Wars films and other media are sonic weapons. Such weapons are commonly used by bounty hunters as a way to incapacitate their prey according to background material.Barr, et al. (2017), p. 168 It also refers to Geonosians specifically as being well-known within the setting for their sonic weaponry. First appearing in Attack of the Clones, Geonosian sonic weapons are described as using oscillators to create powerful sonic blasts which are enveloped in plasma-containment spheres and fired at the enemy.Barr, et al. (2019), p. 257 ;Analysis A laser is a device which emits a beam of coherent light at a target. Controlling or containing the direction of light energy is also known as synchronization. This concentration of energy in one direction gives it strong and sometimes powerful intensity. Lasers have different uses for military purposes, many of which strongly differ from what is seen in Star Wars, but still follow the same concepts of concentrating energy and/or material within a limited magnetic range. A major difference is that until recently, current laser technology did not emit lasers in separate bolts, but single rays; whereas Star Wars depicts both. Additionally Rhett Allai, associate professor of physics at Southeastern Louisiana University, argues the energy bolts fail to fit the definition of laser and explains that in many ways the laser cannons in Star Wars actually defy the rules of physics. However, a 1995 paper by Richard E. Russo from the National Laboratory in Berkeley, California, discusses the functions of lasers and mildly argues the Star Wars depiction of lasers as accurate.Richard E. Russo, \\"Laser Ablation,\\" Appl. Spectrosc. 49, 14A-28A (1995) Furthermore, researchers in Poland in partnership with the Faculty of Physics at the University of Warsaw claim to have developed lasers in bolted form and caught on camera. The professionals claimed that the lasers were so powerful and intense that it resulted in them being ionized. The interaction of the pulse with the plasma generates light of many different wavelengths. The American Air Force Research Laboratory is currently working on long term developments of aerial laser weapons. Their aim is to make fighter aircraft laser capable by the year 2030. The laser cannons use the same concept of ion-based technology as seen in Star Wars. The United States Navy has begun to induct laser weapons in its fleet since late 2014. The weapons will be used for both sea-to-air and sea-to-sea purposes. Israeli company Rafael Advanced Defense Systems claimed in 2014 that it is close to developing laser shields named Iron Beam, which company spokesman compares by similarity to the lasers of Star Wars. The company claims that Iron Beam can deflect drones, missiles, rockets and mortars. In a similar development, Chinese scientists produced laser guns that can disable the sensors of missiles, satellites and other sensor equipped devices. The guns are expected to be used by the Chinese military in future warfare and have been compared to Star Wars laser guns. A more recent and advanced development in 2017 involved students at Macquarie University in Australia developed a method of multiplying laser power by the use of diamonds. This concept is similar to the fictional kyber crystals used in the Star Wars universe to power up laser weapons from smaller scale weapons (e.g. blasters, lightsabers) to super-scale intensity in the case of the Death Star. The Death Star's laser power works in a similar method to this by concentrating multiple light beams into one spot from where they combine into a single beam. This beam has been described as more powerful than usual because it can be used for the purpose of destroying/damaging solid objects such as drones and debris that it was compared to the lasers used by the Death Star. = Projectile weapons = Projectile weapons, also referred to as slugthrowers, appear in the Star Wars universe in various forms. Reference material identifies the Tusken Raiders as using a type of slugthrower called a cycler rifle, built from stolen and scavenged parts and firing a solid shot enveloped in energy.Barr, et al. (2019), p. 255 The bounty hunter Aurra Sing is also identified as wielding an Adventurer slugthrower rifle, which is described as flooding the firing chamber with a rich oxidizer as it detonates its shell to give the projectile extra range and power.Luceno, et al. (2018), p. 89 The bowcaster is a crossbow-like weapon carried by Chewbacca (Peter Mayhew/Joonas Suotamo) during the events of the Star Wars films. Canonically, bowcasters were developed by the Wookiees and were a favorite weapon of theirs; other races were generally not strong enough to operate the cocking mechanism. Their function is described in reference material as firing a metal bolt called a quarrel. Alternating polarizer orbs on either end of the bow create a magnetic field which propels the quarrel forward, emerging from the barrel enveloped in blaster energy to give it an explosive impact.Barr, et al. (2019), p. 277Luceno, et al. (2018), p. 250 Chirrut √émwe (Donnie Yen) carries a custom- built bowcaster in Rogue One: A Star Wars Story. Identified as a lightbow, the weapon operates on the same principle as a Wookie bowcaster and is said to be more powerful than a heavy blaster rifle, allowing Chirrut to shoot down a TIE fighter during the events of the film.Barr, et al. (2019), p. 275 = Rockets and missiles = A replica of Boba Fett's outfit, which also includes a small seeker missile mounted on his jet pack. The usage of rockets and missiles is seen frequently throughout the Star Wars franchise, including in films, comics, and novels. In the original Star Wars movie, Luke Skywalker (Mark Hamill) destroys the Death Star by firing a pair of proton torpedoes into its exhaust port. Proton torpedoes are described in background literature as missile weapons which can be fired at long-range targets and, upon impact, release clouds of high-velocity protons to damage the enemy. These weapons can display incredible maneuverability, such as making a 90-degree turn within a turning circle of one meter.Windham (2019), p. 104 Another type of missile weapon are concussion missiles, such as those seen in Return of the Jedi when Lando Calrissian (Billy Dee Williams) pilots the Millennium Falcon into the Death Star II and destroys its reactor with a pair of concussion missiles. Within the Star Wars universe, concussion missiles are said to be primarily used for atmospheric combat, where their explosions create devastating sonic booms and ground tremors that can cause tremendous devastation. However their warheads are still powerful enough that they are effective when used in space combat.Windham (2018), p. 81 Not all missile weapons in the Star Wars universe carry explosive warheads. The discord missile is a type described by in- universe material as agile enough to avoid anti-missile fire and deploy up to seven buzz droids on a target vessel. These droids then use their mechanical arms and cutting tools to inflict as much damage on the vessel as possible. Discord missiles were first seen in Revenge of the Sith during the opening space battle as a group of missile-deployed buzz droids attack Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) in his Jedi interceptor.Luceno, et al. (2018), p. 132Barr, et al. (2019), p. 268 Many individual characters are seen or described as using rockets and missiles in the Star Wars universe. The bounty hunter Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison) wears a jet pack which can fire an anti-vehicle homing missile, which he uses against Obi-Wan Kenobi in their duel on Kamino in Attack of the Clones.Luceno, et al. (2018), p. 108Barr, et al. (2019), p. 267 Boba Fett (Jeremy Bulloch) also wears a jet pack which can fire either a homing missile or grappling hook, and carries a wrist-mounted mini concussion rocket launcher which can fire a variety of small homing rockets.Luceno, et al. (2018), p. 210Barr, et al. (2019), p. 281 = Other explosive devices = Hand-held explosive devices are commonly seen and mentioned in the Star Wars saga and other media. Many hold a large amount of explosive power in a small package and can be triggered in a variety of ways, such as remotely or via timed fuse. Examples include concussion disks, EMP grenades, and thermal detonators.Barr, et al. (2017), p. 170 In Return of the Jedi, a disguised Princess Leia (Carrie Fisher) threatens Jabba the Hutt with a Class-A thermal detonator. Star Wars fiction describes these devices as filled with a volatile baradium core contained within a thermite shell and capable of disintegrating anything within a blast radius.Barr, et al. (2019), p. 283 Another example of unique explosive devices are the Gungan weapons that feature in the climactic battle of The Phantom Menace and are referred to in Star Wars literature as \\"boomas.\\" It describes these grenade-type weapons as containing plasmic energy which is mined from deep in the porous crust of Naboo and contained within protective shells. Upon impact these shells burst, releasing the plasma and a powerful electric shock on the target. These weapons come in multiple sizes, from handheld types that can be thrown to larger artillery shells launched by catapults and powerful enough to disable an armored tank.Barr, et al. (2019), p. 256 Larger explosive devices include the seismic charges seen on film in Attack of the Clones, where Jango Fett (Temuera Morrison) deploys them in an attempt to destroy Obi-Wan Kenobi (Ewan McGregor) and prevent him from pursuing him. According to the Star Wars Databank, these weapons draw in sound and explode in devastating concussive waves of energy. Another is the electro- proton bomb which made its first appearance in the 2008 Clone Wars television series. Deployed on the planet Malastare, the bomb disabled an entire droid army in one blast but also awakened a slumbering Zillo Beast.Barr, et al. (2019), p. 202 =Melee = The Star Wars universe also makes extensive use of melee weapons, such as staffs, swords, batons and whips. The most notable of those is the Lightsaber. The presence of those types of weapons allows for dramatic combat sequences such as lightsaber combat. A Gaffii Stick or Gaderiffi is a staff weapon with a heavy end which appears similar to the medieval flanged mace. These weapons are described in background material as being hand-crafted by Tusken Raiders using a variety of materials, though with a preference for durable metals. They can be wielded a number of different ways to kill an opponent, or to incapacitate them when coated with the paralyzing venom of the fictional sandbat creature native to Tatooine.Luceno, et al. (2018), p. 90 An electrostaff is a melee weapon which is designed to withstand lightsaber strikes. According to reference literature, they accomplish this task thanks to the fictional material Phrik, a rare and virtually indestructible alloy which conducts energy. Either end of the staff features electromagnetic modules which, when activated, are sheathed in energy tendrils and deliver debilitating electrical charges that can be adjusted to lethal levels. These weapons made their first theatrical appearance in Revenge of the Sith being used by General Grevious's bodyguards, the IG-100 MagnaGuards, and have featured in other Star Wars media.Barr, et al. (2019), p. 262 Similar to the electrostaff is the Z6 riot control baton, which made its theatrical appearance in The Force Awakens and is utilized by the First Order's stormtroopers to quell riots. Collapsible conductor contact veins are capable of delivering a powerful electric shock to incapacitate an opponent and can deflect a lightsaber blade. Reference literature also states the baton's adhesive grip pairs magnatomically with a stormtrooper's gloves.Barr, et al. (2019), p. 286Luceno, et al. (2018), p. 299Barr, et al. (2017), p. 173 Other types of melee weapons have featured in Star Wars Legends continuity. The amphistaff is the primary anti-personnel living weapon of the Yuuzhan Vong. Amphistaff scales can produce an edge harder than a diamond's that can stop a lightsaber. In addition to its default staff/spear configuration, an amphistaff can be wielded as a whip or flail by selectively hardening parts of its body. Vibroweapons are a highly lethal class of melee weapon that utilises a generator, usually located on the weapon's hilt, to create supersonic vibrations. Many variations of vibroweapon exist; due to the adaptable nature of vibroweapon generators, vibroweapons can be made out of axes, pikes, knives, and swords. At least as far back as 3956 BBY, vibroweapons have often been laced with Cortosis (a rare metal known to short out lightsabers). This allows the user of the vibroblade to defend their self against a lightsaber wielding opponent.Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic (2003) Vibroweapons have been used by characters in various media, such as Lando Calrissian from the Star Wars movies and Mission Vao from Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic. The Emperor's Imperial guards, as seen in Return of the Jedi, use Force Pikes. These not only have a vibrating power tip, but can be set to deliver an electric stun charge. In order to allow this conductivity, the shaft of the force pike is made of reinforced graphite. Not only does this allow the pike to flex to absorb impact rather than breaking, but also means the weapon weighs no more than 7 kg and can therefore be handled with extreme swiftness and agility for a weapon of its length.  Lightsabers  Lightsabers are described as one of the most rare and mysterious weapons of the Star Wars universe and are generally used by the Jedi and the Sith. The standard lightsaber is a sword-like weapon that emits a blade of pure energy from its metal hilt which has no mass but can cut through almost anything and deflect blaster bolts. The core of the lightsaber is a kyber crystal, which according to Star Wars canon acts as the focusing element and takes on a specific color when it \\"bonds\\" with someone sensitive to the Force.Luceno, et al. (2018), p. 14Barr, et al. (2017), p. 174 Variations on the standard design include double-bladed lightsabers like the one wielded by Darth Maul (Ray Park) in The Phantom Menace.

The Japanese Instrument of Surrender was the written agreement that formalized the surrender of the Empire of Japan, marking the end of hostilities in World War II. It was signed by representatives from the Empire of Japan, the United States of America, the Republic of China,Not to be confused with the People's Republic of China which did not then exist. the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, the Commonwealth of Australia, the Dominion of Canada, the Provisional Government of the French Republic, the Kingdom of the Netherlands, and the Dominion of New Zealand. The signing took place on the deck of in Tokyo Bay on September 2, 1945. The date is sometimes known as Victory over Japan Day, although that designation more frequently refers to the date of Emperor Hirohito's Gyokuon-h≈çs≈ç (Imperial Rescript of Surrender), the radio broadcast announcement of the acceptance of the terms of the Potsdam Declaration at noon Japan Standard Time on August 15. Preparation Gen. MacArthur's staff headed by Col. LeGrande A. Diller were tasked to prepare the draft of the Instrument of Surrender. This was a challenge given resources were limited in war-torn Manila. Nevertheless, an enterprising staff member found rare parchment in a basement of a monastery, and this was given to MacArthur's printer. Surrender ceremony Japanese Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu signing the Instrument of Surrender on behalf of the Japanese Government, formally ending World War II General of the Army Douglas MacArthur signing the Instrument of Surrender on behalf of the Allied Powers The ceremony aboard the deck of the Missouri lasted 23 minutes and was broadcast throughout the world. The instrument was first signed by the Japanese foreign minister Mamoru Shigemitsu \\"By Command and on behalf of the Emperor of Japan and the Japanese Government\\" (9:04 am). General Yoshijir≈ç Umezu, Chief of the Army General Staff, then signed the document \\"By Command and on behalf of the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters\\" (9:06 am). photo at AWM of Umezu signing. The Japanese representatives present for the signing were the following: * Foreign Minister Mamoru Shigemitsu * General Yoshijir≈ç Umezu, Chief of the Army General Staff * Major General Yatsuji Nagai * Katsuo Okazaki (Foreign Ministry) * Rear Admiral Tadatoshi Tomioka * Toshikazu Kase (Foreign Ministry) * Lt. General Suichi Miyakazi * Rear Admiral Ichiro Yokoyama * Saburo Ota (Foreign Ministry) * Captain Katsuo Shiba (Navy) * Colonel Kaziyi Sugita At 9:08 a.m., U.S. General of the Army Douglas MacArthur, the Commander in the Southwest Pacific and Supreme Commander for the Allied Powers, accepted the surrender on behalf of the Allied Powers and signed in his capacity as Supreme Commander. After MacArthur's signature as Supreme Commander, the following representatives signed the instrument of surrender on behalf of each of the Allied Powers: * Fleet Admiral Chester Nimitz for the United States (9:12 a.m.) photo at AWM, Nimitz signing. * General Hsu Yung-chang for China (9:13 a.m.) AWM photo, Hsu Yung-chang signing. * Admiral Sir Bruce Fraser for the United Kingdom (9:14 a.m.) photo at AWM, Fisher signing. * Lieutenant General Kuzma Derevyanko for the Soviet Union (9:16 a.m.) AWM photo 040968, Derevyanko signing. The Soviet Union had only declared war on Japan a month earlier, after the Hiroshima bombing. * General Sir Thomas Blamey for Australia (9:17 a.m.) AWM photo, Blamey about to sign. * Colonel Lawrence Moore Cosgrave for Canada (9:18 a.m.) AWM photo, Cosgrave signing. * G√©n√©ral de Corps d'Arm√©e Philippe Leclerc de Hauteclocque for France (9:20 a.m.) AWM photo, Leclerc signing. * Lieutenant Admiral C. E. L. Helfrich for the Netherlands (9:21 a.m.) AWM photo, Helfrich signing. * Air Vice-Marshal Leonard M. Isitt for New Zealand (9:22 a.m.) AWM photo, Isitt signing. The UK invited Dominion governments to send representatives to the ceremony as subordinates to its own. MacArthur supported the government of Australia's demand to attend and sign separately from the UK, although Australia objected to his recommendation that Canada, the Netherlands, and France also sign the document. On September 6, Colonel Bernard Theilen took the document and an imperial rescript to Washington, D.C., and presented them to President Harry S. Truman in a formal White House ceremony the following day. The documents were then exhibited at the National Archives. Flags at the ceremony Commodore Perry's flag was flown from Annapolis, Maryland to Tokyo for display at the surrender ceremonies which officially ended World War II. The deck of the Missouri was furnished with two American flags. A commonly heard story is that one of the flags had flown over the White House on the day Pearl Harbor was attacked. However, Captain Stuart Murray of USS Missouri explained: That special flag on the veranda deck of the Missouri had been flown from Commodore Matthew Perry's flagship in 1853‚Äì54 when he led the U.S. Navy's Far East Squadron into Tokyo Bay to force the opening of Japan's ports to foreign trade. MacArthur was a direct descendant of the New England Perry family and cousin of Commodore Matthew Perry. Photographs of the signing ceremony show that this flag is displayed backward‚Äîreverse side showing (stars in the upper right corner). This was because American flags on the right of an object plane, ship, or person have the stars on the upper right corner, to look like the flag is heading into battle‚Äîas if attached to a pole and someone is carrying it. Stars in the upper left of a flag displayed on the right side of the object would make the flag look like it was going away from battle. The cloth of the historic flag was so fragile that the conservator at the U.S. Naval Academy Museum directed that a protective backing be sewn on it, leaving its \\"wrong side\\" visible; and this was how Perry's 31-star flag was presented on this unique occasion. A replica of this historic flag can be seen today on the Surrender Deck of the Battleship Missouri Memorial in Pearl Harbor. This replica is also placed in the same location on the bulkhead of the veranda deck where it had been initially mounted on the morning of September 2, 1945, by Chief Carpenter Fred Miletich. The original flag is still on display at the Naval Academy Museum, as is the table and tablecloth upon which the instrument of surrender was signed, and the original bronze plaque marking the location of the signing (which was replaced by two replicas in 1990). However, it is not certain that the table is the actual one used as the deck had been cleaned and items returned to storage before anyone thought to save it. Differences between versions The Japanese copy of the treaty varied from the Allied in the following ways: * The Allied copy was presented in leather and gold lining with both countries' seals printed on the front, whereas the Japanese copy was bound in rough canvas with no seals on the front. * The Canadian representative, Colonel Lawrence Moore Cosgrave, signed below his line instead of above it on the Japanese copy, so everyone after him had to sign one line below the intended one. This was attributed to Col. Cosgrave being blind in one eye from a World War I injury. When the discrepancy was pointed out to General Sutherland, he crossed out the pre-printed name titles of the Allied nations and rewrote by hand the titles in their correct relative positions. The Japanese initially found this alteration unacceptable‚Äîuntil Sutherland initialed (as an abbreviated signature) each alteration. The Japanese representatives did not complain further., Current locations The Allied copy of the Instrument is at the United States National Archives Building in Washington, D.C.. A replica of the Japanese version can be viewed at the Edo- Tokyo Museum in Tokyo. Gen. MacArthur originally had 11 full-sized facsimiles made of the Instrument of Surrender, but later increased this for distribution among the allied nations present during the signing. Two of the copies which were given to Col. LeGrande A. Diller and MGen. Basilio Valdes for the Philippines are now displayed at The International Museum of World War II in Natick, Massachusetts. As witnesses, American general Jonathan Wainwright, who had surrendered the Philippines, and British lieutenant-general Arthur Percival, who had surrendered Singapore, received two of the six pens used by General MacArthur to sign the instrument. Another pen went to the West Point military academy, and one to MacArthur's aide. All of the pens used by MacArthur were black, except the last, which was plum-colored and went to his wife. A replica of it, along with copies of the instrument of surrender, is in a case on Missouri by the plaque marking the signing spot. The model of USS Missouri in the National Museum of the United States Navy at the Washington Navy Yard, has a scale replica of the signing table in the correct location.

It had a population of 20 households, an estimated 110 persons, all Muslim. The villagers paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on agricultural products, such as on wheat barley, wheat, olives, beehives, and goats; a total of 3,920 ak√ße. 1/3 of the revenue went to a waqf.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 189. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 535Note that Rhode, 1979, p. 6 writes that the register that H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah studied was not from 1595/6, but from 1548/9 A map from Napoleon's invasion of 1799 by Pierre Jacotin showed the place, named as Nemen.Karmon, 1960, p. 166. In the nineteenth century, Nimrin grew to become a stone-built village of 250 Muslim people. It was described as being built on the slope of a hill, surrounded by arable land.Conder and Kitchener, 1881, SWP I, p. 361. Quoted in Khalidi, 1992, p. 535 The Ottomans founded an elementary school in the village.

The Ottoman school was closed down during this period. In the 1945 statistics the population consisted of 320 Muslims, and the total land area was 12,019 dunams. Of this, Arabs used 7,905 dunams for cereals, 335 for plantations and irrigable land,Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945.

Strange and exotic weapons are a recurring feature in science fiction. In some cases, weapons first introduced in science fiction have been made a reality; other science fiction weapons remain purely fictional, and are often beyond the realms of known physical possibility. At its most prosaic, science fiction features an endless variety of sidearms‚Äîmostly variations on real weapons such as guns and swords. Among the best-known of these are the phaser‚Äîused in the Star Trek television series, films and novels‚Äîand the lightsaber and blaster‚Äîfeatured in Star Wars movies, comics, novels and TV shows. Besides adding action and entertainment value, weaponry in science fiction sometimes touch on deeper concerns and become a theme, often motivated by contemporary issues. One example is science fiction that deals with weapons of mass destruction.  Weapons in early science fiction  Weapons of early science fiction novels were usually bigger and better versions of conventional weapons, effectively more advanced methods of delivering explosives to a target. Examples of such weapons include Jules Verne's fulgurator and the \\"glass arrow\\" of the Comte de Villiers de l'Isle-Adam. A classic science fiction weapon particularly in British and American science fiction novels and films is the ray gun. A very early example of a ray gun is the Heat-Ray featured in H. G. Wells' The War of the Worlds (1898).Van Riper, op.cit., p. 46. The discovery of x-rays and radioactivity in the last years of the 19th century led to an increase in the popularity of this family of weapons, with numerous examples in the early twentieth century, such as the disintegrator rays of George Griffith's future war novel The Lord of Labour (1911). Early science fiction film often showed raygun beams making bright light and loud noise like lightning or large electric arcs. Wells also prefigured modern armored warfare with his description of tanks in his 1903 short story \\"The Land Ironclads\\", and aerial warfare in his 1907 novel The War in the Air.  Lasers and particle beams  Arthur C. Clarke envisaged particle beam weapons in his 1955 novel Earthlight, in which energy would be delivered by high-velocity beams of matter. After the invention of the laser in 1960, it briefly became the death ray of choice for science fiction writers. For instance, characters in the Star Trek pilot episode The Cage (1964) and in the Lost in Space TV series (1965‚Äì1968) carried handheld laser weapons. By the late 1960s and 1970s, as the laser's limits as a weapon became evident, the ray gun began to be replaced by similar weapons with names that better reflected the destructive capabilities of the device. These names ranged from the generic \\"pulse rifle\\" to series-specific weapons, such as the phasers from Star Trek. In the Warhammer 40,000 franchise, a faction known as the Imperial Guard has a \\"lasgun\\", which is described as being a handheld laser weapon, as their main weapon, and larger cannon versions being mounted onto tanks and being carried around by Space Marines. The Eldar has a special unit called the Swooping Hawks equipped with a \\"lasblaster\\". In the Command & Conquer video game series, various factions make extensive use of laser and particle beam technology. The most notable are Allied units Prism Tank from Red Alert 2 and Athena Cannon from Red Alert 3, the Nod's Avatar and Obelisk of Light from Tiberium Wars, as well as various units from Generals constructed by USA faction, including their \\"superweapon\\" Particle Cannon.  Plasma weaponry  Weapons using plasma (high-energy ionized gas) have been featured in a number of fictional universes.  Weapons of mass destruction  Nuclear weapons are a staple element in science fiction novels. The phrase \\"atomic bomb\\" predates their existence, and dates back to H. G. Wells' The World Set Free (1914) when scientists had discovered that radioactive decay implied potentially limitless energy locked inside of atomic particles (Wells' atomic bombs were only as powerful as conventional explosives, but would continue exploding for days on end). Cleve Cartmill predicted a chain-reaction-type nuclear bomb in his 1944 science-fiction story \\"Deadline\\", which led to the FBI investigating him, due to concern over a potential breach of security on the Manhattan Project.\\"Reflections: The Cleve Cartmill Affair\\" by Robert Silverberg The use of radiological, biological and chemical weapons is another common theme in science fiction. In the aftermath of World War I, the use of chemical weapons, particularly poison gas, was a major worry, and was often employed in the science fiction of this period, for example Neil Bell's The Gas War of 1940 (1931). Robert A. Heinlein's 1940 story \\"Solution Unsatisfactory\\" posits radioactive dust as a weapon that the US develops in a crash program to end World War II; the dust's existence forces drastic changes in the postwar world. In The Dalek Invasion of Earth, set in the 22nd Century, it is claimed the Daleks invaded Earth after it was bombarded with meteorites and a plague wiped out entire continents. A subgenre of science fiction, post-apocalyptic fiction, uses the aftermath of nuclear or biological warfare as its setting. The Death Star is the Star Wars equivalent to a weapon of mass destruction and as such might be the most well known weapon of mass destruction in Science fiction.  Powered armor and fighting suits  Glove-scientist-weapons-concept The idea of powered armor has appeared in a wide variety of fiction, beginning with E. E. Smith's Lensman series in 1937. One of the most famous early versions was Robert A. Heinlein's 1959 novel Starship Troopers, which can be seen as spawning the entire subgenre concept of military \\"powered armor\\", which would be further developed in Joe Haldeman's The Forever War. The Marvel character Iron Man is another noteworthy example. Other examples include the power armor used by the Space Marines and other characters from Games Workshop's Warhammer 40k franchise, and the power armor used by the Brotherhood of Steel in the Fallout franchise, and the MJOLNIR Armor worn by protagonist Master Chief in the Halo series of video games. The anime series Gundam Wing centers around nuclear powered piloted suits of armor called mobile suits, The Mobile suits referred to as Gundams (Being made from the highly durable material, Gundanium) are virtually indestructible, highly maneuverable and boasting formidable firepower. Powered armor suits appear numerous times in the later Command and Conquer games. The Terrans, a future version of humanity in the StarCraft series, are often seen in powered combat suits and equipped with rifles that fire bullets similar to a tip of a pencil. Others are equipped with the a sort of cybernetic implants. Some science fiction stories contain accounts of hand-to-hand combat in zero gravity, and the idea that old-fashioned edged weapons‚Äîdaggers, saws, mechanical cutters‚Äîmay still have the advantage in close-up situations where projectile weapons are impractical.  Cyberwarfare and cyberweapons  The idea of cyberwarfare, in which wars are fought within the structures of communication systems and computers using software and information as weapons, was first explored by science fiction. John Brunner's 1975 novel The Shockwave Rider is notable for coining the word \\"worm\\" to describe a computer program that propagates itself through a computer network, used as a weapon in the novel. William Gibson's Neuromancer coined the phrase cyberspace, a virtual battleground in which battles are fought using software weapons and counterweapons. The Star Trek episode A Taste of Armageddon is another notable example. Certain Dale Brown novels place cyberweapons in different roles. The first is the \\"netrusion\\" technology used by the U.S. Air Force. It sends corrupt data to oncoming missiles to shut them down, as well as hostile aircraft by giving them a \\"shutdown\\" order in which the systems turn off one by one. It is also used to send false messages to hostiles, in order to place the tide of battle in the favor of America. The technology is later reverse- engineered by the Russian Federation to shut down American anti-ballistic missile satellites from a tracking station at Socotra Island, Yemen. Cyberwarfare has moved from a theoretical idea to something that is now seriously considered as a threat by modern states. In a similar but unrelated series of incidents involved various groups of hackers from India and Pakistan that hacked and defaced several websites of companies and government organizations based in each other's country. The actions were committed by various groups based in both countries, but not known to be affiliated with the governments of India or Pakistan. The cyber wars are believed to have begun in 2008 following the Mumbai attacks believed to be by a group of Indian cyber groups hacking into Pakistani websites. Hours after the cyber attacks, a number of Indian websites (both government and private) were attacked by groups of Pakistani hackers, claiming to be retaliation for Indian attacks on Pakistani websites. The back and forth attacks have persisted on occasions since then.  Doomsday machines  A Doomsday machine is a hypothetical construction which could destroy all life, either on Earth or beyond, generally as part of a policy of mutual assured destruction. In Fred Saberhagen's 1967 Berserker stories, the Berserkers of the title are giant computerized self-replicating spacecraft, once used as a doomsday device in an interstellar war aeons ago, and, having destroyed both their enemies and their makers, still attempting to fulfil their mission of destroying all life in the universe. The 1967 Star Trek episode \\"The Doomsday Machine\\" written by Norman Spinrad, explores a similar theme. Alien doomsday machines are common in science fiction as \\"Big Dumb Objects\\", McGuffins around which the plot can be constructed. An example is the Halo megastructures in the video game franchise Halo, which are world-sized doomsday machines that when fired, eliminate all sentient life in a radius.  The sentient weapon  The science fiction themes of autonomous weapons systems and the use of computers in warfare date back to the 1960s, often in a Frankensteinian context, notably in Harlan Ellison's 1967 short story \\"I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream\\" and films such as The Forbin Project, originally released in 1970 (based on a novel by Dennis Feltham Jones). In Keith Laumer's Bolo novels, the eponymous protagonists are huge main battle tanks with self-aware artificial intelligence. Another common theme is that of dehumanised, cyborg or android soldiers: human, or quasi- human beings who are themselves weapons. Philip K. Dick's 1953 short story \\"Second Variety\\" features self-replicating robot weapons, this time with the added theme of weapons imitating humans. In his short story \\"Impostor\\", Dick goes one step further, making its protagonist a manlike robot bomb that actually believes itself to be a human being. The idea of robot killing machines disguised as humans is central to James Cameron's film The Terminator, and its subsequent media franchise. They also appear as the central problem of the 1995 cult film Screamers (based on \\"Second Variety\\") and its sequel. The Battlestar Galactica's cylons are sentient weapons too, even in the original series and in its reboot in the 2000s. However, human- looking cylons are the central characters of the remake series (in the original series, only one prototype was human-looking). In Harlan Ellison's 1957 short story \\"Soldier From Tomorrow\\" the protagonist is a soldier who has been conditioned from birth by the State solely to fight and kill the enemy. Samuel R. Delany's 1966 novella Babel-17 features TW-55, a purpose-grown cloned assassin. Ridley Scott's 1982 film Blade Runner, like Philip K. Dick's novel Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?, on which it is loosely based, uses the story of a hunt for escaped military androids to explore the idea what it means to be human. In John Carpenter's 1974 film Dark Star, a notable portion of the plot involves the characters trying to convince a large intelligent bomb not to detonate inside the ship. The idea of animate weapons is now so much a science fiction trope that it has spawned a whole genre of science fiction films such as Hardware, Death Machine and Universal Soldier.  War on the mind  Themes of brainwashing, conditioning, memory-erasing, and other mind control methods as weapons of war feature in much science fiction of the late 1950s and 1960s, parallelling the contemporary panic about communist brainwashing, existence of sleeper agents, and the real-world attempts of governments in programs such as MK-ULTRA to make such things real. David Langford's short story BLIT (1988) posits the existence of images (called basilisks) that are destructive to the human brain, which are used as weapons of terror by posting copies of them in areas where they are likely to be seen by the intended victims. Langford revisited the idea in a fictional FAQ on the images, published by the science journal Nature in 1999.BLIT, David Langford, Interzone, 1988.comp.basilisk FAQ, David Langford, \\"Futures,\\" Nature, December 1999. The neuralyzer from the Men in Black films are compact objects which can erase and modify the short-term memories of witnesses by the means of a brief flash of light, ensuring that no one remembers encountering either aliens or the agents themselves. The TV series Dollhouse (2009) features technology that can \\"mindwipe\\" people (transforming them into \\"actives\\", or \\"dolls\\") and replace their inherent personalities with another one, either \\"real\\" (from another actual person's mind), fabricated (for example, a soldier trained in many styles of combat and weaponry, or unable to feel pain), or a mixture of both. In a future timeline of the series, the technology has been devised into a mass weapon, able to \\"remote wipe\\" anyone and replace them with any personality. A war erupts between those controlling actives, and \\"actuals\\" (a term to describe those still retaining their original personas). An offshoot technology allows actual people to upload upgrades to their personas (such as fighting or language skills), similar to the process seen in The Matrix, albeit for only one skill at a time.  The resizeability of weapons in science fiction  Kylo Ren's three bladed lightsaber. Some weapons in science fiction can be folded and put away for easy storage. For instance the sword carried by Hikaru Sulu in the Star Trek movie of 2009 had its blade unfold from its own form into the fully extended position from the state of a simple handle. Another example of this are the weapons of the Mass Effect universe. The weaponry in the games would fold up into smaller and more compact shapes when holstered or deactivated. Lightsabers from Star Wars are no larger than a flashlight until they are turned on.  Parallels between science fiction and real-world weapons  Some new forms of real world weaponry resemble weapons previously envisaged in science fiction. The early 1980s-era Strategic Defense Initiative, a proposed missile defense system intended to protect the United States from attack by ballistic strategic nuclear weapons (Intercontinental ballistic missiles and Submarine-launched ballistic missiles), gained the popular name \\"Star Wars\\" after the popular franchise created by George Lucas.Sharon Watkins Lang. SMDC/ASTRAT Historical Office. Where do we get \\"Star Wars\\"?. The Eagle. March 2007. In some cases, the influence of science fiction on weapons programs has been specifically acknowledged. In 2007, the science fiction author Thomas Easton was invited to address engineers working on a DARPA program to create weaponized cyborg insects, as envisaged in his novel Sparrowhawk. Active research on powered exoskeletons for military use has a long history, beginning with the abortive 1960s Hardiman powered exoskeleton project at General Electric, and continuing into the 21st century. The borrowing between fiction and reality has worked both ways, with the power loader from the film Aliens resembling the prototypes of the Hardiman system. American military research on high power laser weapons started in the 1960s, and has continued to the present day, with the U.S. Army planning, as of 2008, the deployment of practical battlefield laser weapons. Lower-powered lasers are currently used for military purposes as laser target designators and for military rangefinding. Laser weapons intended to blind combatants have also been developed, but are currently banned by the Protocol on Blinding Laser Weapons, although low-power versions designed to dazzle rather than blind have been developed experimentally. Gun-mounted lasers have also been used as psychological weapons, to let opponents know that they have been targeted in order encourage them to hide or flee without having to actually open fire on them.

Biography  He served as an army medic during World War II and began to pursue a career in art upon returning to the United States. He earned degrees in art education and art administration from Bluffton College and the University of Colorado, then turned his attention to ceramics. He focused first on functional pottery. In 1954, Soldner became Peter Voulkos' first student in the nascent ceramics department at the Los Angeles County Art Institute (now the Otis College of Art and Design). As Soldner helped his teacher establish the program, he made several changes to the studio pottery equipment, which led to him founding Soldner Pottery Equipment Corp. in 1955, to market his inventions. He eventually held seven patents related to pottery equipment. After receiving his MFA in ceramics in 1956, Soldner began teaching at Scripps College. In the 1960s he helped found Anderson Ranch Arts Center in Snowmass, Colorado. He was also involved in starting the National Council on Education for the Ceramic Arts. He developed a type of low-temperature salt firing.Soldner essay Along with Voulkos, Soldner has been credited with creating the \\"California School\\" of ceramic arts by combining Western materials and technology with Japanese techniques and aesthetics.Makers, A History of American Studio Craft Chap.7, Voulkos and Soldner at Pages 224 - 231 While teaching at Scripps College, he organized the Scripps Ceramics Annual - a nationally recognized ceramic exhibition. In addition, as a result of his lifelong friendship with ceramic collectors Fred and Mary Marer, Scripps became the fortunate recipient of the extensive Marer Collection of Contemporary Ceramics. In 1990, Scripps received an NEA Grant to research and organize and exhibition titled, \\"Paul Soldner:A Retrospective'\\" that travelled throughout the United States.

The steep roof with windows creates an additional floor of habitable space (a garret), and reduces the overall height of the roof for a given number of habitable stories. The upper slope of the roof may not be visible from street level when viewed from close proximity to the building. The earliest known example of a mansard roof is credited to Pierre Lescot on part of the Louvre built around 1550. This roof design was popularized in the early 17th century by Fran√ßois Mansart (1598‚Äì1666), an accomplished architect of the French Baroque period. It became especially fashionable during the Second French Empire (1852‚Äì1870) of Napol√©on III. Mansard in Europe (France, Germany and elsewhere) also means the attic or garret space itself, not just the roof shape and is often used in Europe to mean a gambrel roof.  Identification  Mansard rooftops along Boulevard Haussmann in Paris constructed during the Second French Empire. Two distinct traits of the mansard roof ‚Äì steep sides and a double pitch ‚Äì sometimes lead to it being confused with other roof types. Since the upper slope of a mansard roof is rarely visible from the ground, a conventional single-plane roof with steep sides may be misidentified as a mansard roof. The gambrel roof style, commonly seen in barns in North America, is a close cousin of the mansard. Both mansard and gambrel roofs fall under the general classification of \\"curb roofs\\" (a pitched roof that slopes away from the ridge in two successive planes). However, the mansard is a curb hip roof, with slopes on all sides of the building, and the gambrel is a curb gable roof, with slopes on only two sides. (The curb is a horizontal, heavy timber directly under the intersection of the two roof surfaces.) French roof is often used as a synonym for a mansard but is also defined as an American variation\\"French\\". (1998). In The Chambers Dictionary (1998 ed.).

A significant difference between the two, for snow loading and water drainage, is that, when seen from above, gambrel roofs culminate in a long, sharp point at the main roof beam, whereas mansard roofs always form a low-pitched roof. In France and Germany, no distinction is made between gambrels and mansards ‚Äì they are both called \\"mansards\\". In the French language, mansarde can be a term for the style of roof, or for the garret living space, or attic, directly within it. A cross- sectional diagram of a timber-framed Mansard roof; each of its four faces has the same profile.  Advantages  The mansard style makes maximum use of the interior space of the attic and offers a simple way to add one or more storeys to an existing (or new) building without necessarily requiring any masonry. Often the decorative potential of the mansard is exploited through the use of convex or concave curvature and with elaborate dormer window surrounds. One frequently seen explanation for the popularity of the mansard style is that it served to shelter its owners against taxes as well as rain. One such example of this claim, from the 1914 book How to Make a Country Place, reads, \\"Monsieur Mansard is said to have circumvented that senseless window tax of France by adapting the windowed roof that bears his name.\\" This is improbable in many respects: Mansart was a profligate spender of his clients' money, and while a French window tax did exist, it was enacted in 1798, 132 years after Mansart's death, and did not exempt mansard windows. Later examples suggest that either French or American buildings were taxed by their height (or number of storeys) to the base of the roof, or that mansards were used to bypass zoning restrictions. This last explanation is the nearest to the truth: a Parisian law had been in place since 1783, restricting the heights of buildings to 20 metres (65 feet). The height was only measured up to the cornice line, making any living space contained in a mansard roof exempt. A 1902 revision of the law permitted building three or even four stories within such a roof.  History and use  The Landed Gentry House in Szczecin, Poland = Early use = The style was popularized in France by architect Fran√ßois Mansart (1598‚Äì1666). Although he was not the inventor of the style, his extensive and prominent use of it in his designs gave rise to the term \\"mansard roof\\", an adulteration of his name. The design tradition was continued by numerous architects, including Jules Hardouin-Mansart (1646‚Äì1708), his great nephew, who is responsible for Ch√¢teau de Dampierre in Dampierre-en-Yvelines. = Second Empire = The mansard roof became popular once again during Haussmann's renovation of Paris beginning in the 1850s, in an architectural movement known as Second Empire style. Second Empire influence spread throughout the world, frequently adopted for large civic structures such as government administration buildings and city halls, as well as hotels and railway stations. In the United States and Canada, and especially in New England, the Second Empire influence spread to family residences and mansions, often corrupted with Italianate and Gothic Revival elements. A mansard-topped tower became a popular element incorporated into many designs, such as Main Building (Vassar College), Poughkeepsie, New York, which shows a large mansard-roofed structure with two towers.Vassar College Archives = 20th century = The Germania Life Insurance Company Building in New York City, built in 1911, with a four-storey mansard roof The 1916 Zoning Resolution adopted by New York City promoted the use of mansard roofs; rules requiring the use of setbacks on tall buildings were conducive to the mansard design. In the 1960s and 1970s, a modernised form of mansard roof, sometimes with deep, narrow windows, became popular for both residential and commercial architecture in many areas of the United States. In many cases, these are not true mansard roofs but flat on top, the sloped fa√ßade providing a way to conceal heating, ventilation and air-conditioning equipment from view. The style grew out of interest in postmodern stylistic elements and the \\"French eclectic\\" house style popular in the 1930s and 1940s, and in housing also offered a way to provide an upper story despite height restrictions. Houses with mansard roofs were sometimes described as French Provincial; architect John Elgin Woolf popularized it in the Los Angeles area, calling his houses Hollywood Regency.  Transportation  The roof of two Victorian Railways hopper wagons resembled a mansard roof. The Australian Commonwealth Railways CL class locomotive also has a mansard roof.

With a population of 11,700, Leominster is the largest of the five towns (Leominster, Ross-on-Wye, Ledbury, Bromyard and Kington) in the county. From 1974 to 1996, Leominster was the administrative centre for the former local government district of Leominster. Toponymy The town takes its name from the English word minster, meaning a community of clergy and the original Celtic name for the district Leon or Lene, probably in turn from an Old Welsh root lei to flow.J. & C. Hillaby, Leominster Minster, Priory, and Borough c.660‚Äì1539 (Logaston Press, Almeley, Herefs. 2006), 4‚Äì5. The Welsh name for Leominster is Llanllieni. with Llan suggesting a possible Celtic origin to the town's religious community. Contrary to certain reports, the name has nothing to do with Leofric, an 11th- century Earl of Mercia (most famous for being the miserly husband of Lady Godiva). History Milepost, showing the old spelling 'Lemster', now in Leominster Museum During the Early Middle Ages, Leominster was home to √Üthelmod of Leominster, an English saint known to history mainly through the hagiography of the Secgan Manuscript. Stowe MS 944 , British Library He is reputedly buried in Leominster. During the 8th and 9th Century, Danes (or Vikings) frequently raided the area. In 2015, two individual (operating without landowner permission), using metal detectors, found a large hoard near Leominster (the Leominster hoard) consisting primarily of Saxon jewellery and silver ingots but also coins; the latter date to around 879 CE. According to a news report, \\"experts believe it was buried by a Viking during a series of raids\\", while Wessex was ruled by Alfred the Great and Mercia by Ceolwulf II of Mercia. According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, a raid by Gruffudd ap Llywelyn on Leominster in 1052 resulted in the Battle of Llanllieni, between the Welsh and a combined force of Normans (mercenaries) and English Saxons. Henry I bestowed the minster and its estates on Reading Abbey, which founded a priory at Leominster in 1121, although there was one here from Saxon times.Hillaby, 53-7 Its Priory Church of St. Peter and St. Paul, which now serves as the parish church, is the remaining part of this 12th-century Benedictine monastery. Quatrefoil piers were inserted between 1872‚Äì79 by Sir George Gilbert Scott.The Buildings of England: Herefordshire, Nikolaus Pevsner, (1963) p226 The priory was ransacked by the Welsh forces of Owain Glynd≈µr after their victory at the Battle of Bryn Glas near Pilleth in 1402, along with several local manor houses. Investigations to the north of the priory in 2005 located the position of the cloister, although most of the stone had been stolen following the Dissolution. Discarded animal bones found on the site when submitted to carbon dating showed that the area was occupied in the 7th century. This agrees with the date of 660 CE associated with the founding myth, which suggests a Christian community was established here by a monk, St. Edfrid, from Northumberland. Leominster is also the historical home of Ryeland sheep, a breed once famed for its \\"Lemster\\" wool, known as 'Lemster ore'. This wool was prized above all other English wool in trade with the continent of Europe in the Middle Ages. It was the income and prosperity from this wool trade that established the town and the minster and attracted the envy of the Welsh and other regions. From approximately 1748 to 1754, Pinsley Mill in Leominster was home to one of the Paul-Wyatt cotton mills, the first four cotton mills in the world, employing the spinning machines of Lewis Paul and John Wyatt. The mill was financed by Lancashire native Daniel Bourn, and was partly owned by other men from Lancashire. Bourn introduced his own version of the carding engine to work at this mill, and of the four Paul-Wyatt mills, it may have been the most successful, as shortly after the fire that destroyed the mill, it was reported that the cotton works \\"had been viewed with great pleasure and admiration by travellers and all who had seen them.\\"Manchester Mercury, reported on 5 November 1754 One of the last ordeals by ducking stool took place in Leominster in 1809, with Jenny Pipes as the final incumbent. The ducking stool is on public display in Leominster Priory; a mechanised depiction of it is featured on the town clock.

Like roadway and water distribution systems, a loop or ring is used to provide redundancy. SDH, SONET and WDM systems are often configured in self-healing rings. Description The system consists of a ring of bidirectional links between a set of stations, typically using optical fiber communications. In normal use, traffic is dispatched in the direction of the shortest path towards its destination. In the event of the loss of a link, or of an entire station, the two nearest surviving stations \\"loop back\\" their ends of the ring. In this way, traffic can still travel to all surviving parts of the ring, even if it has to travel \\"the long way round\\". A second break in the ring may divide it into two sub-rings, but in such a case each sub-ring will remain functional. Advantages Self-healing rings offer high levels of resilience at low cost, since it is often geographically easy to take multiple paths across the landscape and link them up into a ring with very little extra fiber length. Recent submarine communications cables are typically built in pairs to function as a self-healing ring. Very high resilience systems are typically built on interconnected meshes of self-healing rings. Another example of a self-healing ring network technology is the FDDI local-area network.

In modern systems, the number of phases is usually three or a multiple of three. Each phase carries a sinusoidal alternating current whose phase is delayed relative to one of its neighbours and advanced relative to its other neighbour. The phase currents are separated in time evenly within each period of the alternating current. For example, in a three-phase system, the phases are separated from each other by one-third of the period. Coil construction Like all coils used in electrical machinery, polyphase coils (made from insulated conducting wire) are wound around ferromagnetic armatures with radial projections and maximum core-surface exposure to the magnetic field. The windings are physically separated around the circumference of an electrical machine. The result of such an arrangement is a rotating magnetic field that is used to convert electrical power to rotary mechanical work, or vice versa. Polyphase motors and generators Compared to single-phase motors and generators, polyphase motors are simpler, because they do not require external circuitry (using capacitors and inductors) to produce a starting torque. Polyphase machines can deliver constant power over each period of the alternating current, eliminating the pulsations found in a single-phase machine as the current passes through zero amplitude. History The use of polyphase coils in electrical power systems was pioneered by the engineers Nikola Tesla, Galileo Ferraris, and Michail Dolivo-Dobrovolsky.

It was created on 22 August 1892 for the former Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, Lawrence Dundas, 3rd Earl of Zetland. Zetland is an archaic spelling of Shetland. The Dundas family descends from the wealthy Scottish businessman and Member of Parliament, Lawrence Dundas. In 1762 he was created a Baronet, of Kerse in the County of Linlithgow, in the Baronetage of Great Britain. The title was created with remainder, failing heirs male of his own, to his brother Thomas Dundas and the heirs male of his body. He was succeeded by his son, the second Baronet. He represented Richmond and Stirling in the House of Commons and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Orkney and Shetland. In 1794 he was created Baron Dundas, of Aske in the North Riding of the County of York, in the Peerage of Great Britain. Lord Dundas notably purchased the right to the earldom of Orkney and lordship of Zetland from James Douglas, 14th Earl of Morton. His son, the second Baron, was a Member of Parliament for Richmond and also served as Lord Lieutenant of Orkney and Shetland. In 1838 he was created Earl of Zetland in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Earl. He also represented Richmond and York in Parliament and served as Lord Lieutenant of the North Riding of Yorkshire. On his death the titles passed to his nephew, the third Earl. At first a Liberal, he held minor office in the second administration of William Ewart Gladstone but later joined the Conservative Party and served from 1889 to 1892 as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland. The latter year he was honoured when he was made Earl of Ronaldshay, in the County of Orkney and Zetland, and Marquess of Zetland. The Earl of Ronaldshay is the courtesy title of the eldest son and heir of the Marquess. He was succeeded by his son, the second Marquess. He was also a prominent politician and served as Governor of Bengal and as Secretary of State for India. the titles are held by his grandson, the fourth Marquess, who succeeded his father in 1989.

He was responsible for commissioning the Charlotte Dundas, the world's \\"first practical steamboat\\". Biography Marske Hall Aske Hall c.1880 Dundas was the only son of Sir Lawrence Dundas, 1st Baronet, the \\"Nabob of the North\\". Following education at Eton and St. Andrews University he did the Grand Tour, then became Member of Parliament for Richmond, 1763-1768, then for Stirlingshire, 1768-1794\\\\. He was elevated to the peerage as Baron Dundas of Aske in August 1794, and was also Lord Lieutenant and Vice Admiral of Orkney and Shetland, Councillor of state to the Prince of Wales (later George IV), President of the Society of Scottish Antiquaries and Colonel of the North York Militia. He acquired Marske Hall in North Yorkshire in 1762 after the death of Sir William Lowther, 3rd Baronet. He succeeded his father as 2nd Baronet in 1781, inheriting Aske Hall, also in North Yorkshire. Charlotte Dundas Dundas followed his father in having an interest in Grangemouth and in the Forth and Clyde Canal, under construction from 1768 to 1790, and he would have been aware of the 1789 trials on the canal of Patrick Miller of Dalswinton's double-hulled paddle boat powered with a steam engine fitted by William Symington. In 1800 Dundas, as Governor of the Forth and Clyde Canal Company, engaged Symington to design a steam tug on the lines of a failed attempt by Captain John Schank for the Bridgewater Canal. At a meeting of the canal company's directors on 5 June 1800 Dundas \\"produced a model of a boat by Captain Schank to be worked by a steam engine by Mr Symington\\", and it was agreed this should be immediately put in hand. The boat was built to Symington's design. It had successful trials on the River Carron in June 1801 and further trials towing sloops from the river Forth up the Carron and thence along the Forth and Clyde Canal. The other proprietors of the canal were concerned about wave damage to the canal banks, and the Committee decided that the boat would \\"by no means answer the purpose\\". Symington had proposals for an improved boat which were presented in the form of a model, shown to Lord Dundas, of the boat which would become famous as the Charlotte Dundas, named in honour of one of his Lordship's daughters. One account states that Lord Dundas had advised Symington to prepare the model and bring it to his Lordship in London, where Symington was introduced to the Duke of Bridgewater who was enthusiastic enough to immediately order eight boats of similar construction for his canal. Unfortunately the Duke of Bridgewater died a few days before the first sailing, and nothing came of this order. Lord Dundas and some of his relatives and friends were on board for the first sailing of the boat on the canal in 1803, but despite the success of the Charlotte Dundas fears of erosion of the banks prevailed, and the trials were ended leaving Symington out-of-pocket.

Anglo- Saxon secular buildings in Britain were generally simple, constructed mainly using timber with thatch for roofing. No universally accepted example survives above ground. There are, however, many remains of Anglo-Saxon church architecture. At least fifty churches are of Anglo-Saxon origin with major Anglo-Saxon architectural features, with many more claiming to be, although in some cases the Anglo-Saxon part is small and much-altered. It is often impossible to reliably distinguish between pre- and post-Conquest 11th century work in buildings where most parts are later additions or alterations. The round-tower church and tower-nave church are distinctive Anglo-Saxon types. All surviving churches, except one timber church, are built of stone or brick, and in some cases show evidence of re-used Roman work. The architectural character of Anglo-Saxon ecclesiastical buildings range from Celtic influenced architecture in the early period; Early Christian basilica influenced architecture; and in the later Anglo-Saxon period, an architecture characterised by pilaster-strips, blank arcading, baluster shafts and triangular headed openings. In the last decades of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom a more general Romanesque style was introduced from the Continent, as in the now built-over additions to Westminster Abbey made from 1050 onwards, already influenced by Norman style. In recent decades architectural historians have become less confident that all undocumented minor \\"Romanesque\\" features post- date the Norman Conquest. Although once common, it has been incorrect for several decades to use the plain term \\"Saxon\\" for anything Anglo-Saxon that is later than the initial period of settlement in Britain. Early Anglo-Saxon buildings in Britain were generally simple, constructed mainly using timber with thatch for roofing. Generally preferring not to settle within the old Roman cities, the Anglo-Saxons built small towns near their centres of agriculture, at fords in rivers or sited to serve as ports. In each town, a main hall was in the centre, provided with a central hearth.York and London both offer examples of this trend. Houses and other secular buildings Reconstruction of the Anglo-Saxon royal palace at Cheddar around 1000 Anglo- Saxon secular buildings were normally rectangular post built structures, where timber posts were driven into the ground to form the framework of the walls upon which the thatched roofs were constructed. Only ten of the hundreds of settlement sites that have been excavated in England from this period have revealed masonry domestic structures and confined to a few quite specific contexts. The usual explanation for the tendency of Anglo‚ÄìSaxons to build in timber is one of technological inferiority or incompetence. However it is now accepted that technology and materials were part of conscious choices indivisible from their social meaning. Le Goff, suggestsLe Goff, J. (1988), Medieval Civilization 400‚Äì1500 (Oxford: Blackwell):203 that the Anglo-Saxon period was defined by its use of wood, providing evidence for the care and craftsmanship that the Anglo‚ÄìSaxon invested into their wooden material culture, from cups to halls, and the concern for trees and timber in Anglo‚ÄìSaxon place‚Äìnames, literature and religion.Bintley, Michael DJ, and Michael G. Shapland, eds. Trees and Timber in the Anglo-Saxon World. Oxford University Press, 2013 Michael Shapland suggests: Anglo‚ÄìSaxon building forms were very much part of this general building tradition. Timber was 'the natural building medium of the age':Turner, H. L. (1970), Town Defences in England and Wales: An Architectural and Documentary Study A. D. 900‚Äì1500 (London: John Baker) the very Anglo‚ÄìSaxon word for 'building' is 'timbe'. Unlike in the Carolingian world, late Anglo‚ÄìSaxon royal halls continued to be of timber in the manner of Yeavering centuries before, even though the king could clearly have mustered the resources to build in stone.Higham, R. and Barker, P. (1992), Timber Castles (London: B. T. Batsford):193 Their preference must have been a conscious choice, perhaps an expression of 'deeply‚Äìembedded Germanic identity' on the part of the Anglo‚ÄìSaxon royalty. Though very little contemporary evidence survives, methods of construction, including examples of later buildings, can be compared with methods on the continent. The major rural buildings were sunken-floor (Grubenh√§user) or post- hole buildings, although Helena Hamerow suggest this distinction is less clear.Hamerow, Helena. Early medieval settlements: the archaeology of rural communities in Northwest Europe, 400‚Äì900. Oxford University Press, 2004. An excavated example is at Mucking. In addition to the sunken huts, vernacular buildings from the migration period found at Mucking included more substantial halls up to long and wide with entrances in the middle of both longer sides. Even the elite had simple buildings, with a central fire and a hole in the roof to let the smoke escape and the largest of which rarely had more than one floor, and one room. Buildings vary widely in size, most were square or rectangular, though some round houses have been found. Frequently these buildings have sunken floors; a shallow pit over which a plank floor was suspended. The pit may have been used for storage, but more likely was filled with straw for winter insulation. A variation on the sunken floor design is found in towns, where the \\"basement\\" may be as deep as 9 feet, suggesting a storage or work area below a suspended floor. Another common design was simple post framing, with heavy posts set directly into the ground, supporting the roof. The space between the posts was filled in with wattle and daub, or occasionally, planks. The floors were generally packed earth, though planks were sometimes used. Roofing materials varied, with thatch being the most common, though turf and even wooden shingles were also used.Hamerow During the 9th and 10th centuries, fortifications (burhs) were constructed around towns to defend against Viking attacks. Almost no secular work remains above ground, although the Anglian Tower in York has been controversially dated to the seventh century. Recent evidence opens up the possibility that St George's Tower, Oxford, may be a surviving part of the defenses surrounding the Anglo- Saxon burh of Oxford. There is a reconstruction of an Anglo-Saxon settlement at West Stow, and contemporary illustrations of both secular and religious buildings are sometimes found in illuminated manuscripts.  Church architecture: historical context  The fall of Roman Britain at the beginning of the fifth century, according to Bede, allowed an influx of invaders from northern Germany including the Angles and Saxons. Reconstructed basilican plan of Brixworth church The Angles and the Saxons had their own religion, but Christianity was on its way. St Patrick, a Romano-British man, converted Ireland to Christianity, from where much of Western Scotland was converted and much of Northumbria was reconverted. Links were also established between the Christian communities in Ireland and those in Wales and the West country at sites such as St Piran's Oratory which represents some of the earliest Christian architecture extant on the British mainland. The architecture though was initially influenced by Coptic monasticism.Pevsner, N. (1963) An Outline of European Architecture, Harmondsworth Examples of this can be seen today in the form of rectangular dry-stone corbelled structures such as at Gallarus Oratory, Dingle and Illauntannig, Ireland. Christianity and Irish influence came to England through missionaries. In 635, a centre of Celtic Christianity was established at Lindisfarne, Northumbria, where St Aidan founded a monastery. In 597, the mission of Augustine from Rome came to England to convert the southern Anglo-Saxons, and founded the first cathedral and a Benedictine monastery at Canterbury. These churches consisted of a nave with side chambers. In 664 a synod was held at Whitby, Yorkshire, and leaders of both the Celtic and Roman Church united the church throughout England. Larger churches developed in the form of basilicas, for example at Brixworth. The Romano-British populations of Wales, the Westcountry, and Cumbria experienced a degree of autonomy from Anglo-Saxon influence, represented by distinct linguistic, liturgical and architectural traditions, having much in common with the Irish and Breton cultures across the Celtic Sea, and allying themselves with the Viking invaders. This was however, gradually elided by centuries of English dominance. Characteristically circular buildingsMedieval Devon & Cornwall; Shaping an Ancient Countryside, Ed. Sam Turner, 2006 as opposed to rectangular, often in stone as well as timber, along with sculptured Celtic crosses, holy wells and the reoccupation of Iron Age and Roman sites from hillforts such as Cadbury Castle, promontory hillforts such as Tintagel, and enclosed settlements called Rounds characterise the western Sub-Roman Period up to the 8th century in southwest England and continue much later in independent Wales at post-Roman cities such as Caerleon and Carmarthen. Triple arch opening separating the nave and apse in the 7th- century church at Reculver, Kent (now destroyed) Subsequent Danish (Viking) invasion marked a period of destruction of many buildings in Anglo-Saxon England, including in 793 the raid on Lindisfarne. Buildings including cathedrals were rebuilt, and the threat of conflict had an inevitable influence on the architecture of the time. During and after the reign of Alfred the Great (871-899), Anglo-Saxon towns (burhs) were fortified. Contemporary defensive banks and ditches can still be seen today as a result of this. Oxford is an example of one of these fortified towns, where the eleventh century stone tower of St. Michael's church has prominent position beside the former site of the North gate. The building of church towers, replacing the basilican narthex or West porch, can be attributed to this late period of Anglo-Saxon architecture.  7th century  In contrast to secular buildings, stone was used from very early on to build churches, although a single wooden example has survived at Greensted Church, which is now thought to be from the end of the period. Bede makes it clear in both his Ecclesiastical History and his Historiam Abbatum that the masonry construction of churches, including his own at Jarrow, was undertaken morem Romanorum, \\"in the manner of the Romans\\", in explicit contrast to existing traditions of timber construction. Even at Canterbury, Bede believed that St Augustine's first cathedral had been 'repaired' or 'recovered' (recuperavit) from an existing Roman church, when in fact it had been newly constructed from Roman materials. The belief was \\"the Christian Church was Roman therefore a masonry church was a Roman building\\". The earliest surviving Anglo-Saxon architecture dates from the 7th century, essentially beginning with Augustine of Canterbury in Kent from 597; for this he probably imported workmen from Frankish Gaul. The cathedral and abbey in Canterbury, together with churches in Kent at Minster in Sheppey (c.664) and Reculver (669), and in Essex at the Chapel of St Peter-on-the-Wall at Bradwell-on-Sea (where only the nave survives), define the earliest type in southeast England. A simple nave without aisles provided the setting for the main altar; east of this a chancel arch, perhaps a triple arch opening as at Reculver, separated off the apse for use by the clergy. However there is no surviving complete 7th-century church with an apse. Flanking the apse and east end of the nave were side chambers serving as sacristies; further porticus might continue along the nave to provide for burials and other purposes. Exceptions to this include the Old Minster, Winchester. Church designs at the time differed between the North of England, which are narrow with square ended chancels, rather than the apses of the south. In Northumbria the early development of Christianity was influenced by the Irish mission, important churches being built in timber. Masonry churches became prominent from the late 7th century with the foundations of Wilfrid at Ripon and Hexham, and of Benedict Biscop at Monkwearmouth-Jarrow. These buildings had long naves and small rectangular chancels; porticus sometimes surrounded the naves. Elaborate crypts are a feature of Wilfrid's buildings. The best preserved early Northumbrian church is Escomb Church.Wilkinson, David John, and Alan McWhirr.

The decades before the Conquest were prosperous for the elite, and there was great patronage of church building by figures such as Lady Godiva. Many cathedrals were constructed, including Westminster Abbey, although all these were subsequently rebuilt after 1066. Norman workers may have been imported for Westminster Abbey through the Norman Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert of Jumi√®ges. Recent arguments and recent archaeological discoveries have raised the possibility that the 11th-century St George's Tower, Oxford, predates both the foundation of Oxford Castle and the Norman Conquest, and functioned as a gate tower commanding the western entrance into the pre-Conquest burh. If so, the tower was then incorporated into the Norman castle built on the site in the 1070s, instead of being constructed along with it as architectural historians have long assumed. It would thus be almost without parallel in England as a purely secular and defensive Anglo-Saxon structure (see below, Secular architecture). *Greensted Church, Essex (1013 with oak palisade walls) *Stow Minster, Lincolnshire (c. 1040 with a small part surviving from 975) *St Bene't's Church, Cambridge (c. 1040) *St Michael at the Northgate, Oxford (c. 1040) *St Nicholas' Church, Worth, West Sussex (c. 950 - 1050) *Church of St Mary the Blessed Virgin, Sompting, West Sussex (c. 1050) *Odda's Chapel, Deerhurst, Gloucestershire (1056) *St Matthew's Church, Langford, Oxfordshire (formerly Berkshire) (after 1050) *The tower of Holy Trinity Church in Colchester, Essex has a pre-Conquest 11th century tower built out of Roman rubbleCrummy, Philip (1997) City of Victory; the story of Britain's first Roman town.

H.M. Taylor surveyed 267 churches with Anglo- Saxon architectural features and ornaments.H M & J Taylor, Anglo-Saxon Architecture Architectural historians used to confidently assign all Romanesque architectural features to after the Conquest, but now realize that many may come from the last decades of the Anglo-Saxon kingdom. Typical Anglo- Saxon features include:Pamela Cunnington How Old is that Church? (Marston House, reprinted 2001) * long-and-short quoins * double triangular windows; * narrow, round-arched windows (often using Roman tile); * herringbone stone work * west porch (narthex). It is rare for more than one of these features to be present in the same building. A number of early Anglo-Saxon churches are based on a basilica with north and south porticus (projecting chambers) to give a cruciform plan. However cruciform plans for churches were used in other periods. Similarly, a chancel in the form of a rounded apse is often found in early Anglo-Saxon churches, but can be found in other periods as well.

After early work in Australia he moved to Britain in 1932, where he joined the Vic- Wells Ballet under its creator, Ninette de Valois. He became one of the company's leading men, partnering Alicia Markova and later Margot Fonteyn. When Frederick Ashton, the company's chief choreographer, was called up for military service in the Second World War Helpmann took over from him while continuing as a principal dancer. From the outset of his career Helpmann was an actor as well as a dancer, and in the 1940s he turned increasingly to acting in plays, at the Old Vic and in the West End. Most of his roles were in Shakespeare plays but he also appeared in works by Shaw, Coward, Sartre and others. As a director his range was wide, from Shakespeare to opera, musicals and pantomime. In 1965 Helpmann became co-director of the Australian Ballet, for whom he created several new ballets. He became sole director in 1975 but disagreements with the company's board led to his dismissal a year later. He directed for Australian Opera and acted in stage plays into the 1980s. Although primarily a stage artist, he appeared in fifteen films between 1942 (One of Our Aircraft is Missing) and 1984 (Second Time Lucky), including The Red Shoes, The Tales of Hoffmann and Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. Helpmann died in Sydney and was given a state funeral in St Andrew's Cathedral. The Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, gave a tribute in the Parliament of Australia, and a motion of condolence was passed ‚Äì a rare tribute for a non-politician. Helpmann is commemorated in the Helpmann Awards for Australian performing arts, established in his honour in 2001.

Retrieved 19 May 2019. After being what his biographer Kathrine Sorley Walker calls \\"an uninterested and recalcitrant scholar\\" at Prince Alfred College, Adelaide, Helpmann was taken on as a student apprentice by Anna Pavlova when she was on tour in Australia in 1926. He was trained by Alexis Dolinoff, her leading male dancer.An Adelaide Dancer\\", The Advertiser, 4 December 1926, p. 14 He then joined the theatrical producers J. C. Williamson Ltd, as principal dancer for musicals, revues, and pantomimes, beginning with Franz Leh√°r's Frasquita in 1927. He later appeared in Katinka, The Merry Widow, The New Moon, Queen High, This Year of Grace and Tip-Toes, appearing with stars such as Gladys Moncrieff, Marie Burke and Maisie Gay. Sorley Walker writes, \\"His vitality and bravura presentation of dances stopped various shows\\".Sorley Walker (1998a), p. 7 Robert Helpmann cites Melbourne eccentric, beautician, radio broadcaster, actor and dancer Stephanie Deste as one of the influences over his dancing and acting career.https://www.newspapers.com/clip/18727797/stephanie_deste/ =Vic-Wells Ballet= The English actress Margaret Rawlings, who was touring Australia, was impressed by Helpmann. She encouraged him to pursue a career in Britain, and provided him with an introduction to Ninette de Valois, director of the Vic-Wells Ballet (later named the Sadler's Wells Ballet). Helpmann left Australia in 1932, and did not return until 1955.Sorley Walker (1998a), p. 9 De Valois accepted him into her company. He impressed her ‚Äì she later wrote \\"Everything about him proclaims the artist born\\"De Valois, p. 11 ‚Äì although she noted not only his strengths but also his weaknesses: \\"talented, enthusiastic, extremely intelligent, great facility, witty, cute as a monkey, quick as a squirrel, a sense of theatre and his own possible achievements therein\\" but \\"academically technically weak, lacking in concentration, too fond of a good time and too busy having it\\".Salter, pp. 52‚Äì53 In 1934, probably at Rawlings's suggestion he added a second \\"n\\" to his surname, to give it a more foreign and exotic air. Helpmann and Margot Fonteyn in Frederick Ashton's Fa√ßade In April 1934 de Valois created a new ballet, The Haunted Ballroom, with Helpmann and Alicia Markova in the leading roles. The Times commented that of the soloists Helpmann \\"had the greatest opportunities, and made fine use of them\\".\\"Sadler's Wells Ballet\\", 4 April 1934, p. 10 He co- starred with Markova in Swan Lake, danced in operas, and appeared at the Open Air Theatre, Regent's Park. In 1935 he was leading dancer in the revue Stop Press, with music by Irving Berlin.\\"Adelphi Theatre\\", The Times, 22 February 1935, p. 12 At Sadler's Wells he danced the principal role in another new de Valois ballet, The Rake's Progress, and in 1936 Frederick Ashton choreographed a highly romantic ballet, Apparitions, to music by Liszt, featuring Helpmann and the teenaged Margot Fonteyn. Sorley Walker writes that he and Fonteyn were a \\"perfectly matched partnership\\", exemplified by \\"their superb rendering of the Aurora pas de deux in The Sleeping Beauty\\". As well as romantic leading roles, Helpmann became known for his gift for comedy. Sorley Walker singles out his roles in Copp√©lia, Ashton's A Wedding Bouquet and de Valois's The Prospect Before Us. Character roles included the doddery Red King in de Valois' Checkmate, which he first danced at the age of 28 and last danced in 1986 when he was 77. Helpmann's non-ballet work in the later 1930s included his Oberon in Tyrone Guthrie's production of A Midsummer Night's Dream at the Old Vic, which also starred Vivien Leigh as Titania and Ralph Richardson as Bottom.\\"Old Vic\\", The Times, 28 December 1937, p. 10 The drama critic of The Times wrote: :It will be useless in future for Mr. Robert Helpmann to pretend that he is exclusively a dancer of the first rank. Certainly his dancing gives strength to his Oberon; he glides into imagined invisibility; but that is not all: his verse sings with his thought, his Oberon flashes with power, and presides, as Oberons do rarely, over the whole magic of the wood. The doyen of London critics, James Agate, pronounced Helpmann's Oberon to be, in its way, \\"the best I have ever seen or ever shall see\\".Quoted in Sorley Walker (1998a), p. 37 While at the Old Vic Helpmann met the director Michael Benthall; they formed a lifelong personal partnership and frequently worked together in the theatre. =1940s= During the Second World War Sadler's Wells Ballet became a prominent contributor to public morale, giving London seasons interspersed with a demanding programme of provincial tours.Sorley Walker (1987), p. 233 Helpmann's workload often required him to dance leads in three performances in one day, and when Ashton was called up for active service in 1941,Anderson, p. 78 Helpmann took on the additional role of choreographer to the company.Sorley Walker (1987), p. 231 Ashton, in his enforced absence from the company, observed Helpmann's rise to pre-eminence with feelings of envy, and their relationship became edgy on Ashton's part.Sorley Walker (1998a), pp. 63‚Äì64 The ballets that Helpmann created for the wartime company were Comus (1942, based on Milton), The Birds (1942, to Respighi's Gli uccelli), Miracle in the Gorbals (1944, a story of redemption with a plot by Benthall and music by Arthur Bliss),Anderson pp. 310‚Äì311 and a version of Hamlet set to Tchaikovsky's music. While on leave from the RAF in 1943, Ashton created a new ballet for Helpmann, The Quest, a patriotic tale of Saint George, with music by William Walton, who commented that Helpmann in the lead \\"looked more like the Dragon than St George.\\"Palmer, Christopher (1990).

Helpmann played Octavius Caesar in the first and Apollodorus in the second. When the productions were taken to Broadway at the end of the year he played the same roles. He appeared in another Shaw play the following year, as the male lead, the Doctor, opposite Katharine Hepburn as Epifania, in The Millionairess.\\"New Theatre\\", The Times, 28 June 1952, p. 8 Between these plays Helpmann acted in the Powell and Pressburger film The Tales of Hoffmann, conducted by Sir Thomas Beecham and choreographed by Ashton.

It was two different points of view and it didn't work.\\"Castle, p. 213 In May 1955 Helpmann returned to Australia, leading a tour of the country by the Old Vic company, with Hepburn as a guest artist. He played Petruchio in The Taming of the Shrew, Angelo in Measure for Measure and Shylock. At the Old Vic in 1956 he directed John Neville and Claire Bloom in Romeo and Juliet,\\"The Old Vic\\", The Times, 13 June 1956, p. 3 a production later given on Broadway. He joined the company as an actor later in the year, playing Shylock, Launce in The Two Gentlemen of Verona, Saturnius in Titus Andronicus and the title role in Richard III. During 1957 Helpmann played the title role in Jean-Paul Sartre's Nekrassov,Sorley Walker (1998b), p. 275 and then took over the lead part of Sebastien in Coward's comedy Nude with Violin in London. The role had been created by John Gielgud, who had been succeeded, not altogether satisfactorily, by Michael Wilding.Gielgud, p. 205 Helpmann's vitality revived the spirits of the company, and the play continued its run into the following year.Mander and Mitchenson, p. 460; and \\"Theatres\\", The Times, 1 February 1958, p. 2 Helpmann toured Australia in the piece in 1958‚Äì59, after he had returned to ballet for a season at Covent Garden in The Rake's Progress, Hamlet, Copp√©lia, Miracle in the Gorbals and Petrushka. His performance in the last of these was not well received: in the role of a lovelorn puppet, he was seen as too overtly human and intelligent.Sorley Walker (1998b), p. 276$277 =1960s= At the start of the 1960s Helpmann worked mostly in non-ballet theatre, forgoing the opportunity to create the role of the Widow Simone in Ashton's La fille mal gard√©e in favour of directing Vivien Leigh and Mary Ure in Jean Giraudoux's play Duel of Angels on Broadway.Sorley Walker (1998b), pp. 278-279 In 1962 he performed again for Australian audiences in another Old Vic company, this time headed by Vivien Leigh, which appeared in the Far East, South America and Australia. In 1963 he choreographed his sixth work for The Royal Ballet, the short-lived and critically damned Elektra, with music by Malcolm Arnold and featuring Nadia Nerina, David Blair, Monica Mason and Derek Rencher.\\"Spectacular Helpmann dance-drama\\", The Times, 27 March 1963, p. 15; Kennedy, James, \\"Helpmann's Elektra\\", The Guardian, 27 March 1963, p. 7; and Bland, Alexander, \\"Helpmann aims too low\\", The Observer, 31 March 1963, p. 28 He also supervised a new production of Swan Lake for the company, with important new choreographic contributions from Ashton.Sorley Walker (1998b), p. 281 In the same year he played Prince Tuan in the film 55 Days at Peking. In 1962 Peggy van Praagh, formerly of Sadler's Wells, launched a new company, the Australian Ballet, which, Sorely Walker writes, steadily gained ground as \\"a company full of lively young Australian talent, helped along by top-level international stars like Erik Bruhn, Rudolf Nureyev, and Sonia Arova.\\"Sorley Walker (1998c), pp. 411‚Äì412 Van Praagh approached Helpmann to create a new work for the company and he suggested a story based around the native Australian lyrebird. He was keen to promote Australian talent, and recruited Sidney Nolan to design the costumes and scenery and Malcolm Williamson to compose the score. The work, titled The Display, was premiered at the Adelaide Festival in March 1964, with Kathleen Gorham in the leading role, to an enthusiastic reception.Sorley Walker (1998c), p. 412 Back in London, Helpmann directed and choreographed the first British production of Lerner and Loewe's musical Camelot in 1964. He had been approached by its authors to play Merlin in the original Broadway production, but nothing came of the suggestion. For the London production he sought to recapture, more than the American production had done, the sprit of The Once and Future King, the book on which the show was based.\\"A Camelot Made in England\\", The Times, 10 August 1964, p. 5 The musical received tepid reviews, but Helpmann's production, with designs by John Truscott, was praised as a \\"dazzling\\" and \\"gorgeous spectacle\\"; the show ran for well over a year.\\"Theatres\\", The Times, 1 November 1965, p. 2 The success of The Display led to Helpmann's appointment as co-director of the Australian Ballet in 1965. His biographer Christopher Sexton comments that Helpmann and van Praag \\"complemented each other with their different personalities and skills: she the pedagogue, teacher and administrator; he the restless 'jet-setting' star who spent six months of the year overseas and attracted international names to perform with the company\\". His ballets for the company during the rest of the 1960s were Yugen (1965); an expanded version of Elektra (1966) and Sun Music (1968). Helpmann made two more films during the 1960s. In 1966 he played Weng in The Quiller Memorandum and in 1968 he played the Child Catcher in Chitty Chitty Bang Bang. One critic observed, \\"He will eternally frighten children as the demented child catcher\\";Billman, p. 352 others called Helpmann's performance \\"the most sinister presence I have ever seen on film\\",Chapman, Gary. \\"Starchoice\\", The Times, 26 March 2005, p. 10 and \\"a devastating turn\\" that would give children nightmares.Simpson, p. 18 In 1968 Helpmann was appointed artistic director designate of the Adelaide Festival of 1970, and spent much time seeking out the performers for it. As well as showcasing Australian talent he aimed to attract internationally prestigious performers.Sorley Walker (1998c), pp. 423 and 426 =1970s= Under Helpmann's direction the line-up for the 1970 Adelaide Festival was, by common consent, exceptionally impressive.\\"Giants dominate the SA festival\\", The Canberra Times, 7 March 1970, p. 10 Among those appearing were the Royal Shakespeare Company, led by Judi Dench and Donald Sinden, in The Winter's Tale and Twelfth Night; Benjamin Britten and Peter Pears brought the English Opera Group; there were art exhibitions from Pompeii and Mexico. Dance was represented not only by the Australian Ballet, but also by the Royal Thai Ballet, the Balinese Dance Company and the Georgian State Dance Company. Nureyev was guest artist with the Australian Ballet in a revival of Helpmann's Hamlet, new to the company's repertoire and greatly admired.Sorley Walker (1998c), p. 426 Nureyev also presented his version of Marius Petipa's classic ballet Don Quixote, dancing the romantic lead, Basilio, with Helpmann in the title role of the deluded knight. This was the first time the two dancers had worked together; they took to each other with enthusiasm and continued their fruitful professional relationship. Nureyev continued to play Helpmann's old role of Hamlet in revivals of the 1942 ballet, and the two starred in a film of Don Quixote with the Australian company in 1973, shown internationally and subsequently published on DVD. By the 1970s the combination of Helpmann and Ashton in comic drag as the Ugly Sisters in Ashton's Cinderella had become a much-loved institution at Covent Garden in various revivals since its 1948 premiere.Anderson, p. 99; Salter, pp. 217 and 222; and Sorley Walker (1998c), p. 422\\"Cinderella\\" , Royal Opera House performance archive. Retrieved 29 May 2019 In 1972 Helpmann succeeded in getting Ashton to join him for a production by the Australian Ballet, but despite Helpmann's urging, Ashton never created a new work for the company, although he restaged his La fille mal gard√©e for them.Sorley Walker (1998c), pp. 429‚Äì430 Helpmann's biographer Elizabeth Salter comments that 1974 was \\"a year of disaster\\" for both directors of the Australian Ballet.Salter, p. 238 Van Praag was forced by arthritis to retire, and Helpmann's partner, Michael Benthall, died. The two men had lived together in London since the 1940s, and although both had extracurricular affairs they remained devoted to each other, and Helpmann felt the loss deeply.Sorley Walker (1998c), p. 434; and Salter, p. 238 1974 was also the year of the last ballet created by Helpmann, the plotless Perisynthyon. He commissioned scores from two Australian composers in succession, but finding neither satisfactory he turned at the last minute to Sibelius's First Symphony. The late changes caused inadequate preparation time for the dancers, and the piece was not well received.Sorley Walker (1998c), pp. 432‚Äì433 The following year disagreements between Helpmann and the board of the Australian Ballet came to a head. He was outspoken about the inadequacy of the company's budget, and refused to cut costs, on the grounds that doing do would be artistically and technically damaging. He made it publicly clear that he felt the board had become \\"dominated by money-men who had no experience or understanding of artistic matters\\". The board decided that he must go, and tried to ease him out quietly. He did not cooperate, and made it known that he had been dismissed: \\"I want the public and the dancers to know that I didn't decide to leave them. I would have stayed with them until I dropped dead.\\"Sorley Walker (1998c), p. 437 In 1977 Peter Wright, director of the Sadler's Wells Royal Ballet, invited Helpmann to appear with the company in two of his old starring roles: the Red King in Checkmate and Dr Copp√©lius in Copp√©lia. British ballet audiences had seen little of him in leading roles for some years, and his return was greeted with enthusiasm. The ballet critic of The Times described his Copp√©lius as \\"a legend come to life\\",Percival, John. \\"Comic legend returns\\", The Times, 3 May 1977, p. 9 and his Financial Times colleague wrote of Helpmann's \\"riotous and wonderful control\\", concluding, \\"British ballet owes Helpmann a vast debt ‚Äì his present performances in Copp√©lia and Checkmate increase it still further\\".Crisp, Clement. \\"Ballet\\", The Financial Times, 3 May 1977, p. 17 =1980s= In 1981 Helpmann staged another revival of his ballet Hamlet, this time featuring Anthony Dowell. The production was given first at Covent Garden and was later taken to New York. In Sydney, Helpmann directed and choreographed Handel's opera Alcina, and in the US he directed Lilli Palmer in a one-woman show about Sarah Bernhardt, Sarah in America. The following year he appeared with Diana Rigg in Harvey Schmidt's musical, Colette, which opened in Seattle but folded before reaching Broadway. He then made his last British appearance in an acting role, playing Cardinal Pirelli in a revival of Sandy Wilson's Valmouth at the Chichester Festival. Irving Wardle wrote in The Times, \\"It is not a large part, but Helpmann's hooded smiles and baleful oeuillades, his capacity to express elegant corruption to his beringed finger- tips, lodge one imperishable image.\\"Wardle, Irving. \\"Theatre\\", The Times, 20 May 1982, p. 13 In 1983 Helpmann directed Gounod's opera Rom√©o et Juliette in Sydney, and later in the year appeared there as the elderly Bosie in Justin Fleming's play about Oscar Wilde, The Cobra, with Mark Lee as Bosie's young self. In 1984, together with Googie Withers and John McCallum, he toured in Ted Willis's play Stardust, and joined his sister Sheila to record two episodes of the Australian soap opera A Country Practice, which were shown in 1985. Early in that year he was in the US directing a revival of the operetta The Mery Widow for the San Diego Opera. In June, at the Sydney Opera House, he directed Joan Sutherland in Bellini's I Puritani. His last stage appearances were as the Red King in Checkmate, with the Australian Ballet, in Sydney in May 1986. Helpmann died of emphysema in Sydney on 28 September 1986.Sorley Walker (1998c), pp. 442‚Äì443 He was given the rare tribute of a state funeral, held on 2 October at St Andrew's Cathedral, Sydney. Tributes were paid in both Houses of the Parliament of Australia.Sorley Walker (1998c), pp. 443‚Äì444 In the Senate all senators present stood in silence. This was noted as a rarity, and it was put on record that \\"it is only in exceptional circumstances that motions of condolence are moved for distinguished Australians who have not sat in the Parliament\\". Senator Stan Collard said: :He always regarded himself as an Australian, although much of his life was spent away from these shores ... His love of the theatre and his ability to use it as a medium of communication and expression knew no bounds. He put this country on the map in the cultural arena.... He was always looking for new challenges and was never content to rely on past successes.... He was one of our great ambassadors. In the House of Representatives the Prime Minister, Bob Hawke, said, \\"No one should underestimate Sir Robert Helpmann's role in the development of the growing maturity of Australia's art and culture. ... He demonstrated to the world the diversity of this nation's talents and capabilities.\\" In London a memorial service was held at St Paul's, Covent Garden (known as \\"the actors' church\\"); Ashton represented Princess Margaret, Fonteyn gave the address, a tribute was read from de Valois, and the British ballet and theatre were represented by some of their best-known members.\\"Memorial service: Sir Robert Helpmann\\", The Times, 29 November 1986, p. 18 Honours, reputation and legacy In 1954 Helpmann was appointed to the Royal Order of the Polar Star (Sweden) and in 1957 he was created a Knight of the Cedar (Lebanon). He was appointed CBE in 1964, named as Australian of the Year for 1965, and was created a Knight Bachelor in 1968. In The Daily Telegraph, de Valois wrote in an obituary tribute: :To work with Robert Helpmann was always an inspiration. There was at work an alert intelligence with an acute sense of perception. ... Bobby had a sense of humour that surmounted everything. Sometimes it was expressed by word of mouth, sometimes by an outburst of \\"mime\\"; at other times by just a look ‚Äì and the latter could prove to be the most potent of all, for his timing on such occasions was as faultless as it was fatal.Quoted in Sorley Walker (1998c), p. 444 An unsigned obituary in The Times caused upset by calling Helpmann \\"A homosexual of the proselytising kind, [who] could turn young men on the borderline his way.\\"\\"Sir Robert Helpmann\\", The Times 29 September 1986, p. 14. It was quickly pointed out that Helpmann kept his professional and private lives firmly separate.Kersley, Leo, \\"Sir Robert Helpmann\\", The Times, 7 October 1986, p. 17 An assessment in The Guardian ranked him as capable in \\"princely\\" roles in classic ballets, but \\"peerless\\" in dramatic parts, and best of all in comic roles.Kennedy, James. \\"The prince of Sadler's Wells\\", The Guardian, 29 September 1986, p. 13 The Australian Dictionary of Biography (ADB) describes Helpmann as \\"the complete man of the theatre\\", but adds that in some people's view he worked in too many fields to achieve supremacy in any one of them. Malcolm Williamson observed, \\"he never became a Gielgud, Olivier or Redgrave, or an Ashton, Balanchine or Petit because he was the most pluralistic of the lot\\"; the ADB quotes the dancer Moira Shearer: \\"he wasn't a great dancer ‚Äì he wasn't a great actor ‚Äì but he was most certainly a great mime, the perfect bridge between the two\\". The New York Times said of him: :While some critics question whether he would measure up to today's rigid standards for great classical dancers, Sir Robert was a dancer who could act and an actor who could dance. His personality and talent played a vital part in building the fledgling British ballet.Basler, Barbara. \\"Sir Robert Helpmann is Dead\\", The New York Times, 29 September 1986, p. 14 The Helpmann Academy in South Australia was named in his honour; it is a partnership of the major visual and performing arts education and training institutions in South Australia offering award courses for people seeking professional careers in the arts.\\"History\\" , The Helpmann Academy.

An alternative approach is using dedicated I/O processors, commonly known as channels on mainframe computers, which execute their own instructions. Memory-mapped I/O uses the same address space to address both memory and I/O devices. The memory and registers of the I/O devices are mapped to (associated with) address values. So when an address is accessed by the CPU, it may refer to a portion of physical RAM, or it can instead refer to memory of the I/O device. Thus, the CPU instructions used to access the memory can also be used for accessing devices. Each I/O device monitors the CPU's address bus and responds to any CPU access of an address assigned to that device, connecting the data bus to the desired device's hardware register. To accommodate the I/O devices, areas of the addresses used by the CPU must be reserved for I/O and must not be available for normal physical memory. The reservation may be permanent, or temporary (as achieved via bank switching). An example of the latter is found in the Commodore 64, which uses a form of memory mapping to cause RAM or I/O hardware to appear in the \`0xD000-0xDFFF\` range. Port-mapped I/O often uses a special class of CPU instructions designed specifically for performing I/O, such as the \`in\` and \`out\` instructions found on microprocessors based on the x86 and x86-64 architectures. Different forms of these two instructions can copy one, two or four bytes (\`outb\`, \`outw\` and \`outl\`, respectively) between the EAX register or one of that register's subdivisions on the CPU and a specified I/O port which is assigned to an I/O device. I/O devices have a separate address space from general memory, either accomplished by an extra \\"I/O\\" pin on the CPU's physical interface, or an entire bus dedicated to I/O. Because the address space for I/O is isolated from that for main memory, this is sometimes referred to as isolated I/O.  Overview  Different CPU-to-device communication methods, such as memory mapping, do not affect the direct memory access (DMA) for a device, because, by definition, DMA is a memory-to-device communication method that bypasses the CPU. Hardware interrupts are another communication method between the CPU and peripheral devices, however, for a number of reasons, interrupts are always treated separately. An interrupt is device-initiated, as opposed to the methods mentioned above, which are CPU-initiated. It is also unidirectional, as information flows only from device to CPU. Lastly, each interrupt line carries only one bit of information with a fixed meaning, namely \\"an event that requires attention has occurred in a device on this interrupt line\\". I/O operations can slow memory access if the address and data buses are shared. This is because the peripheral device is usually much slower than main memory. In some architectures, port-mapped I/O operates via a dedicated I/O bus, alleviating the problem. One merit of memory-mapped I/O is that, by discarding the extra complexity that port I/O brings, a CPU requires less internal logic and is thus cheaper, faster, easier to build, consumes less power and can be physically smaller; this follows the basic tenets of reduced instruction set computing, and is also advantageous in embedded systems. The other advantage is that, because regular memory instructions are used to address devices, all of the CPU's addressing modes are available for the I/O as well as the memory, and instructions that perform an ALU operation directly on a memory operand (loading an operand from a memory location, storing the result to a memory location, or both) can be used with I/O device registers as well. In contrast, port-mapped I/O instructions are often very limited, often providing only for simple load-and-store operations between CPU registers and I/O ports, so that, for example, to add a constant to a port-mapped device register would require three instructions: read the port to a CPU register, add the constant to the CPU register, and write the result back to the port. As 16-bit processors have become obsolete and replaced with 32-bit and 64-bit in general use, reserving ranges of memory address space for I/O is less of a problem, as the memory address space of the processor is usually much larger than the required space for all memory and I/O devices in a system. Therefore, it has become more frequently practical to take advantage of the benefits of memory-mapped I/O. However, even with address space being no longer a major concern, neither I/O mapping method is universally superior to the other, and there will be cases where using port-mapped I/O is still preferable. Memory- mapped I/O is preferred in x86-based architectures because the instructions that perform port-based I/O are limited to one register: EAX, AX, and AL are the only registers that data can be moved into or out of, and either a byte- sized immediate value in the instruction or a value in register DX determines which port is the source or destination port of the transfer. Since any general-purpose register can send or receive data to or from memory and memory-mapped I/O devices, memory-mapped I/O uses fewer instructions and can run faster than port I/O. AMD did not extend the port I/O instructions when defining the x86-64 architecture to support 64-bit ports, so 64-bit transfers cannot be performed using port I/O.  Memory barriers  Since the caches mediate accesses to memory addresses, data written to different addresses may reach the peripherals' memory or registers out of the program order, i.e. if software writes data to an address and then writes data to another address, the cache write buffer does not guarantee that the data will reach the peripherals in that order. It is the responsibility of the software to include memory barrier instructions after the first write, to ensure that the cache buffer is drained before the second write is executed. Memory-mapped I/O is the cause of memory barriers in older generations of computers, which are unrelated to memory barrier instructions. The 640 KB barrier is due to the IBM PC placing the Upper Memory Area in the 640‚Äì1024 KB range within its 20-bit memory addressing. The 3 GB barrier and PCI hole are manifestations of this with 32-bit memory addressing; with 64-bit memory addressing these are usually no longer problems on newer architectures.  Examples  {class=\\"wikitable floatright\\" style=\\"margin-left: 1.5em;\\" + A sample system memory map ! Address range (hexadecimal) ! Size ! Device - ! 0000-7FFF  32 KiB  RAM - ! 8000-80FF  256 bytes  General-purpose I/O - ! 9000-90FF  256 bytes  Sound controller - ! A000-A7FF  2 KiB  Video controller/text-mapped display RAM - ! C000-FFFF  16 KiB  ROM } A simple system built around an 8-bit microprocessor might provide 16-bit address lines, allowing it to address up to 64 kibibytes (KiB) of memory. On such a system, the first 32 KiB of address space may be allotted to random access memory (RAM), another 16 KiB to read only memory (ROM) and the remainder to a variety of other devices such as timers, counters, video display chips, sound generating devices, etc. The hardware of the system is arranged so that devices on the address bus will only respond to particular addresses which are intended for them, while all other addresses are ignored. This is the job of the address decoding circuitry, and that establishes the memory map of the system. As a result, system's memory map may look like in the table on the right. This memory map contains gaps, which is also quite common in actual system architectures. Assuming the fourth register of the video controller sets the background colour of the screen, the CPU can set this colour by writing a value to the memory location A003 using its standard memory write instruction. Using the same method, graphs can be displayed on a screen by writing character values into a special area of RAM within the video controller. Prior to cheap RAM that enabled bit-mapped displays, this character cell method was a popular technique for computer video displays (see Text user interface).  Basic types of address decoding  Address decoding types, in which a device may decode addresses completely or incompletely, include the following: ; Complete (exhaustive) decoding : 1:1 mapping of unique addresses to one hardware register (physical memory location). Involves checking every line of the address bus. ; Incomplete (partial) decoding : n:1 mapping of n unique addresses to one hardware register. Partial decoding allows a memory location to have more than one address, allowing the programmer to reference a memory location using n different addresses. It may also be done to simplify the decoding hardware by using simpler and often cheaper logic that examines only some address lines, when not all of the CPU's address space is needed. Commonly, the decoding itself is programmable, so the system can reconfigure its own memory map as required, though this is a newer development and generally in conflict with the intent of being cheaper. :Synonyms: foldback, multiply mapped, partially mapped, address aliasing. ; Linear decoding : Address lines are used directly without any decoding logic. This is done with devices such as RAMs and ROMs that have a sequence of address inputs, and with peripheral chips that have a similar sequence of inputs for addressing a bank of registers. Linear addressing is rarely used alone (only when there are few devices on the bus, as using purely linear addressing for more than one device usually wastes a lot of address space) but instead is combined with one of the other methods to select a device or group of devices within which the linear addressing selects a single register or memory location.  Port I/O via device drivers  In Windows-based computers, memory can also be accessed via specific drivers such as DOLLx8KD which gives I/O access in 8-, 16- and 32-bit on most Windows platforms starting from Windows 95 up to Windows 7. Installing I/O port drivers will ensure memory access by activating the drivers with simple DLL calls allowing port I/O and when not needed, the driver can be closed to prevent unauthorized access to the I/O ports. Linux provides the \`pcimem\` utility to allow reading from and writing to MMIO addresses. The Linux kernel also allows tracing MMIO access from kernel modules (drivers) using the kernel's mmiotrace debug facility. To enable this, the Linux kernel should be compiled with the corresponding option enabled. mmiotrace is used for debugging closed-source device drivers.

At in length, it is one of the smallest species of gull. Its plumage is mainly white with grey upperparts. During breeding season, Bonaparte's gull gains a slate-grey hood. The sexes are similar in appearance.  Taxonomy and etymology  When George Ord first described Bonaparte's gull in 1815, he gave it the scientific name Sterna philadelphia, assigning it to the genus now used for medium-sized terns. Most later taxonomists assigned it to the genus Larus, a longtime catch-all for most of the gull species. However, in 1858, George Newbold Lawrence moved the species to the genus Chroicocephalus, and some taxonomists followed suit. Recent molecular DNA studies have shown that this species fits neatly into a clade with other \\"masked gulls\\", and that it and the slender-billed gull are each other's closest relatives and are basal to the rest of that grouping. Based on these studies, the American Ornithologists' Union, which had previously assigned the species to the genus Larus, moved it into its current genus in 2008. It is monotypic across its range. The species is named for Charles Lucien Bonaparte, a French ornithologist (and nephew to the former French emperor Napoleon Bonaparte) who spent eight years in America, contributing to the understanding of the taxonomy and nomenclature of birds there and elsewhere. Its genus name, Chroicocephalus, is a combination of the Greek words chroikos, an adjective form of chroa meaning \\"colour\\", and kephalƒì meaning \\"head\\". This refers to the dark heads that gulls of this genus show during the breeding season. The specific epithet philadelphia is a Latinized adjective meaning \\"from Philadelphia\\", a reference to the location from which the type specimen was collected.  Description  Bonaparte's gull is among the smallest of the gull species; only little gull and Saunders's gull are smaller. Adults range from in length, with a wingspan of and a body mass of . There is no difference in plumage or bare part colour between the sexes, though males tend to be heavier than females. Bonaparte's gull is smaller- bodied, smaller-headed, and smaller-billed than the other common hooded gulls of North America. The adult has grey upperparts and white underparts; its wingtips are black above and pale below. In breeding plumage, it has a slaty black hood, which it loses in non-breeding plumage. Its short, thin bill is black, and its legs are orangish-red. In their first summer, the appearance of Bonaparte's gull is similar to that in its first winter, but paler due to wear. Fewer than 5% of Bonaparte's gulls acquire a dark hood in their first summer, and on those that do, the hood is duller than on breeding adults.  Distribution and habitat  Bonaparte's gull breeds in boreal forest across southern Alaska and much of interior western Canada, as far east as central Quebec and south to within of the United States/Canada border. It avoids dense stands of conifers, instead choosing more open areas, such as the treed edges of bogs, fens, marshes, ponds, or islands. It typically nests within of open water. It winters along the coasts of North America, and in the Great Lakes. It is a rare vagrant to western Europe and the Azores, where it generally associates with black-headed gulls. In 2017 a breeding pair was spotted on Iceland.  Behaviour  They are migratory and most move east or west to coastal waters, also the Great Lakes. They are graceful in flight, more like terns. = Feeding = Like most gulls, Bonaparte's gull has a varied diet, with prey items changing over the course of the year, and from year to year. During the breeding season, it is largely insectivorous. It is known to quickly congregate in large numbers to take advantage of termite dispersal flights, circling over the emerging swarm and hovering briefly to take the insects in flight. It also gathers in large numbers to feed on the eggs of spawning salmon, alighting on the water and, if necessary, diving to take drifting eggs. During migration and into the winter, insects are first supplemented, then replaced by other food items, including fish, small crustaceans, mollusks, euphausiids, marine worms, and other invertebrates. At least one immature bird has been recorded as having fed on walnut meat. Bonaparte's gulls are known to engage in kleptoparasitism, and have been observed stealing earthworms from foraging dunlins and black-bellied plovers. = Breeding = Once they leave the nest, chicks follow their parents to the nearest water. Bonaparte's gulls begin breeding at two years of age; they are thought to be monogamous. The breeding season begins in mid-June. Courting pairs perform swooping display flights, calling loudly and diving at each other, and then drop down to perch on a branch. Crouched and facing each other, with neck and crown feathers erected and wings slightly raised, they scream at each other with bills opened wide, bobbing up and down as they do so. This display can continue for several minutes before ending abruptly; afterwards, the birds may sit quietly together for some time before separating again. They raise a single brood per year, nesting singly or in loose colonies of , with nests spaced at least apart. Unlike most other gulls, Bonaparte's gulls typically nest in trees ‚Äî almost exclusively conifers, including black spruce, Atlantic white cedar, tamarack and jack pine. Both sexes help to build the nest, which is a platform of small sticks, sometimes with lichen, moss or marsh vegetation added, measuring about in diameter. Most nests are placed above the ground, and within of open water, though they have been found low as , as high as , and as far as from open water. They are only rarely placed on the ground. Adults are aggressive in defending their nests, chasing away even large potential predators such as hawks, common ravens and humans. There is some evidence that human activity in the area of their nests may cause decreased productivity ‚Äî they are known to travel as far as a kilometer (about a half mile) to mob people, for example ‚Äî but, contrarily, some choose to nest near human habitation. The female lays a clutch of , with most nests containing . The eggs are subelliptical, slightly glossy and smooth, measuring and weighing . They range in colour from pale to medium green, olive or buff, and may be variably marked with spots, blotches, or scrawls of brown, grey, violet, or black; these markings may be fine and evenly distributed over the entire surface of the egg, or thick and concentrated towards the egg's larger end. The eggs are incubated by both parents for . Studies have shown that breeding populations can be significantly impacted by bad weather. In one multi-year study in Churchill, Manitoba, for example, more than half of the eggs laid in observed nests were blown out of those nests during storms; only 42% of eggs survived to hatching. Hatchling Bonaparte's gulls are semi- precocial, emerging from their eggs covered with natal down feathers, and with eyes already opened. The down is yellowish-buff, greyer on the flanks and belly, and somewhat pinkish on the breast, with dark brown mottling on the upperparts and head. The bill is blue-black with a pinkish base, and the legs and feet are pinkish-buff. Young birds typically leave the nest within of hatching, jumping out and following their parents to the nearest open water. Both parents tend the young. The time it takes the young to fledge is unknown. Bonaparte's gulls may live to 18 years. = Voice = Bonaparte's gull has a voice described as nasal and raspy, with calls variously transcribed as cherr or cheeer.  Conservation  Because of its extremely large range and its increasing population, Bonaparte's gull is listed as a species of least concern by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. In North America, it is protected by the Migratory Bird Treaty Act. Because it occurs in Europe and Africa only as a vagrant, it is not protected by the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds. The species is known to be preyed upon by peregrine falcons. Like many birds, it hosts a number of internal and external parasites. The linguatulid species Reighardia sternae, a tiny, worm-like crustacean, is sometimes found in the gull's air sacs. The acanthocephala worm Corynosoma bipapillum is sometimes found in the bird's posterior gut, as is the intestinal worm Echinostomum spinulosum. Gigantobilharzia lawayi, a schistosome (or blood fluke) may be carried in the capillaries. Externally, it is known to carry several species of lice, including Actornithophilus funebre, Degeeriella atrimarginata, Degeeriella punctata, Menopon species, and Philopterus gonothorax.

Although he had an important political career, he is chiefly remembered for his poetry. His main pioneering achievement was the Eneados, a full and faithful vernacular translation of the Aeneid of Virgil into Scots, and the first successful example of its kind in any Anglic language. Other extant poetry of his includes Palice of Honour, and possibly King Hart. Life and career =Early life= Gavin (or Gawin, Gawane, Gawain) Douglas was born c. 1474‚Äì76, at Tantallon Castle, East Lothian, the third son of Archibald, 5th Earl of Angus by his second wife Elizabeth Boyd. A Vatican register records that Gavin Douglas was 13 in 1489, suggesting he was born in 1476. An application had been lodged to award Gavin the right to hold a Church canonry or prebend and enjoy its income. Another appeal to Rome concerning church appointments made in February 1495 states his age as 20.Bawcutt 1994, pp. 95‚Äì96. (Bawcutt is unclear about whether these are \\"old style\\" dates.) The 1495 register refers to Douglas as a Glasgow M.A., which may mark a confusion with a namesake, Gavin Douglas, son of the Laird of Drumlanrig. He was a student at St Andrews University in 1489‚Äì94, and thereafter, it is supposed, at Paris. In 1496 he obtained the living of Monymusk, Aberdeenshire, and later he became parson of Lynton (modern East Linton) and rector of Hauch (modern Prestonkirk), in East Lothian. About 1501 he was preferred to the deanery or provostship of the collegiate church of St Giles, Edinburgh, which he held with his parochial charges.Balfour Paul, vol 1, p. 185. =Early career= Until the Battle of Flodden in September 1513, Gavin Douglas appears to have been occupied with his ecclesiastical duties and literary work. Indeed, all the extant writings by which he has earned his place as a poet and translator belong to this period. After the disaster at Flodden he was completely absorbed in public business. Before the crisis of 1513, Douglas was a friend and correspondent of many of the internationally renowned men of his age, including Polydore Vergil, John Major, Cardinal Wolsey and Henry, 3rd Lord Sinclair. Because of his powerful family connections and role in high public life, he is the best-documented of the early Scottish makars. Indeed, of poets in the British Isles before him, only the biography of Chaucer is as well documented or understood. All his literary work was composed before his 40th year while he was Provost of St Giles in Edinburgh. Douglas's literary work was composed in a highly polished Middle Scots, often aureate in style. After the Eneados he is not known to have produced any further poetry, despite being at the height of his artistic powers when it was completed in 1513, six weeks before the Battle of Flodden. No more than four of works by him are known to exist; The Palice of Honour, Conscience, his major translation the Eneados, and possibly King Hart. Statue of Douglas on St Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh While Provost of St Giles, in 1510 Gavin applied to the Pope for permission to celebrate the marriages of couples who were related within the limits and degrees proscribed by the Church. Gavin argued that these marriages helped to make peace in Scotland, and the long delay in receiving a dispensation from Rome in each case, which was a formality, was inconvenient and unnecessary. Gavin asked to be allowed to conduct ten such marriages over four years.Bawcutt 1994, p. 98. =Career during the minority of James V= After the Battle of Flodden, during the minority of James V of Scotland, the Douglas family assumed a pivotal role in public affairs. Three weeks after the Battle of Flodden Gavin Douglas, still Provost of St Giles, was admitted a burgess of Edinburgh. His father, the \\"Great Earl\\", was then the civil provost of the capital. The Earl died soon afterwards in January 1514 in Wigtownshire, where he had gone as justiciar. As his son had been killed at Flodden, the succession fell to Gavin's nephew, Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus. The marriage of the young Earl of Angus to James IV's widow on 6 August 1514 did much to identify the Douglases with the English party in Scotland, as against the French party led by the Duke of Albany, and incidentally to determine the political career of his uncle Gavin. During the first weeks of the Queen's sorrow after the battle, Gavin, with one or two colleagues of the council, acted as personal adviser, and it may be taken for granted that he supported the pretensions of the young earl. His own hopes of preferment had been strengthened by the death of many of the higher clergy at Flodden. The first outcome for Gavin from the new family connection was his appointment to the Abbacy of Aberbrothwick by the Queen Regent, as Margaret Tudor was before her marriage, probably in June 1514. Soon after the marriage of Angus to Margaret she nominated him Archbishop of St Andrews, in succession to William Elphinstone, archbishop-designate. But John Hepburn, prior of St Andrews, having obtained the vote of the chapter, expelled him, and was himself in turn expelled by Andrew Forman, Bishop of Moray, who had been nominated by the Pope. In the interval, Douglas's rights in Aberbrothwick had been transferred to James Beaton, Archbishop of Glasgow, and he was now without title or temporality. The breach between the Queen's party and Albany's had widened, and the Queen's advisers had begun an intrigue with England, to the end that the royal widow and her young son should be removed to Henry's court. In those deliberations Gavin Douglas took an active part, and for this reason stimulated the opposition which successfully thwarted his preferment. Gavin Douglas became heavily involved in affairs of state, seeking a dominant role as one of the Lords of Council and bidding to attain one or more of the many sees, including the archbishopric of St Andrews, left vacant in the destructive aftermath of the Scottish defeat. He finally obtained the bishopric of Dunkeld in 1516, but only after a bitter struggle. In 1517, in his more settled public position, Douglas was one of the leading members of the embassy to Francis I which negotiated the Treaty of Rouen, but his role in the volatile politics of the period, mainly centring on control over the minority of James V, was deeply contentious. By late 1517 he had managed to earn the enduring hostility of the Queen Mother, a former ally, and in subsequent years became manifestly involved in political man≈ìuvring against the Regent Albany. At the same time he remained ambitious for the St Andrews archbishopric, which fell vacant once again in 1521. His career was cut short when he died suddenly during a brief period in exile in London. =Bishop of Dunkeld= Seal of Gavin Douglas as Bishop of Dunkeld In January 1515 on the death of George Brown, Bishop of Dunkeld, Douglas's hopes revived. The queen nominated him to the now vacant seat, which he ultimately obtained, though not without trouble. For John Stewart, 2nd Earl of Atholl had forced his brother, Andrew Stewart, prebendary of Craig, upon the chapter, and had put him in possession of the bishop's palace. The queen appealed to the pope and was seconded by her brother of England, with the result that the Pope's sanction was obtained on 18 February 1515. Some of the correspondence of Douglas and his friends incident to this transaction was intercepted. When Albany came from France and assumed the regency, these documents and the \\"purchase\\" of the bishopric from Rome contrary to statute were made the basis of an attack on Douglas, who was imprisoned in Edinburgh Castle, thereafter in St Andrews Castle (under the charge of his old opponent, Prior Hepburn), and later in Dunbar Castle, and again in Edinburgh. Papal intervention procured his release after nearly a year's imprisonment. The Queen, meanwhile, had retired to England. After July 1516 Douglas appears to have been in possession of his see and to have patched up a diplomatic peace with Albany. On 17 May 1517 the Bishop of Dunkeld proceeded with Albany to France to conduct the negotiations which ended in the Treaty of Rouen. He was back in Scotland towards the end of June. Albany's longer absence in France permitted the party faction of the nobles to come to a head in a plot by James Hamilton, 1st Earl of Arran to seize the Earl of Angus, the Queen's husband. The issue of this plot was the well-known fight of Cleanse the Causeway, in which Gavin Douglas's part stands out in picturesque relief. The triumph over the Hamiltons had an unsettling effect upon the Earl of Angus. He made free with the Queen's rents and abducted Lord Traquair's daughter. The Queen set about obtaining a divorce and used her influence for the return of Albany as a means of undoing her husband's power. Albany's arrival in November 1521, with a large body of French men-at-arms, compelled Angus, with the bishop and others, to flee to the Borders. From this retreat Gavin Douglas was sent by the earl to the English court, to ask for aid against the French party and against the Queen, who was reported to be the mistress of the Regent. Meanwhile, Douglas was deprived of his bishopric and forced, for safety, to remain in England, where he effected nothing in the interests of his nephew. The declaration of war by England against Scotland, in answer to the recent Franco-Scottish negotiations, prevented his return. His case was further complicated by the libellous animosity of James Beaton, Archbishop of Glasgow (whose life he had saved in the \\"Cleanse the Causeway\\" incident), who was anxious to put himself forward and thwart Douglas in the election to the archbishopric of St Andrews, left vacant by the death of Forman. Death In 1522 Douglas was stricken by the plague which raged in London, and died at the house of his friend Lord Dacre. During the closing years of exile he was on intimate terms with the historian Polydore Vergil, and one of his last acts was to arrange to give Polydore a corrected version of Major's account of Scottish affairs. Douglas was buried in the church of the Savoy, where a monumental brass (removed from its proper site after the fire in 1864) still records his death and interment. For Douglas's career see, in addition to the public records and general histories, John Sage's Life in Thomas Ruddiman's edition, and that by John Small in the first volume of his edition The Poetical Works of Gavin Douglas (1874). Works =Palice of Honour= The Palice of Honour, dated 1501, is a dream-allegory extending to over 2000 lines, composed in nine-line stanzas. It is his earliest work. In its descriptions of the various courts on their way to the palace, and of the poet's adventures ‚Äì first, when he incautiously slanders the court of Venus, and later when after his pardon he joins in the procession and passes to see the glories of the palace ‚Äì the poem carries on the literary traditions of the courts of love, as shown especially in the \\"Romaunt of the Rose\\" and \\"The Hous of Fame\\". The poem is dedicated to James IV, not without some lesson in commendation of virtue and honour. No manuscript of the poem is extant. The earliest surviving edition (c. 1553) was printed at London by William Copland (died 1569). An Edinburgh edition, from the press of Henry Charteris (died 1599), followed in 1579. From certain indications in the latter and the evidence of some odd leaves discovered by David Laing, it has been concluded that there was an earlier Edinburgh edition, which has been ascribed to Thomas Davidson, printer, and dated c. 1540. =Eneados= Douglas's major literary achievement is the Eneados, a Scots translation of Virgil's Aeneid, completed in 1513, and the first full translation of a major poem from classical antiquity into any modern Germanic language. His translation, which is faithful throughout, includes the 13th book by Mapheus Vegius. Each of the 13 books is introduced additionally by an original verse prologue. These deal with various matters, sometimes semi- autobiographical, in a variety of styles. =Other accredited works= Two other poems are accredited to Gavin Douglas, King Hart and Conscience. Conscience is a short four-stanza poem. Its subject is the \\"conceit\\" that men first clipped away the \\"con\\" from \\"conscience\\" to leave \\"science\\" and \\"na mair\\"; then they lost \\"sci\\" and had nothing but \\"ens\\": that schrew, Riches and geir. King Hart is a poem of doubtful accreditation. Like The Palice of Honor, it is a later allegory, and as such, of high literary merit. Its subject is human life told in the allegory of King Hart (Heart) in his castle, surrounded by his five servitors (the senses), Queen, Plesance, Foresight and other courtiers. The poem runs to over 900 lines and is written in eight-line stanzas. The text is preserved in the Maitland folio manuscript in the Pepysian library, Cambridge. It is not known to have been printed before 1786, when it appeared in Pinkerton's Ancient Scottish Poems.

Biography S√¶mundr is known to have studied abroad. Previously it has generally been held that he studied in France, but modern scholars rather believe his studies were carried out in Franconia. In Iceland he founded a long-lived school at Oddi. He was a member of the Oddaverjar clan and was the father of Loftur S√¶mundsson. S√¶mundr wrote a work, probably in Latin, on the history of Norwegian kings. The work is now lost but was used as a source by later authors, including Snorri Sturluson. The poem N√≥regs konungatal summarizes S√¶mundr's work. The authorship of the Poetic Edda, or, more plausibly, just the editor's role in the compilation, was traditionally attributed to S√¶mundr - Bishop Brynjulf asked in 1641 \\"Where now are those huge treasuries of all human knowledge written by Saemund the Wise, and above all that most noble Edda\\"?Quoted in C. Tolkien ed., The Legend of Sigurd and Gudrun (London 2009) p. 33 \\\\- but is not accepted today. Icelandic folklore In Icelandic folklore, S√¶mundr is a larger-than-life character who repeatedly tricks the Devil into doing his bidding. For example, in one famous story S√¶mundr made a pact with the Devil that the Devil should carry him home to Iceland from Europe in the form of a seal. S√¶mundr escaped a diabolical end when, on arrival, he hit the seal on the head with the Bible, and stepped safely ashore.G√≠sli Sigur√∞sson, 'Icelandic National Identity: From Romanticism to Tourism', in Making Europe in Nordic Contexts, ed. by Pertti J. Anttonen, NIF Publications, 35 (Turku: Nordic Institute of Folklore, University of Turku, 1996), pp. 41--76 (p. 52). Although the above is a commonly told story about S√¶mundr and his association with the Black School (Svartisk√≥li or Svartask√≥li ), there are several others. In one account, S√¶mundr sailed abroad to learn the Dark Arts, but there was no schoolmaster present. Every time the students requested information regarding the arts, books about the subject would be provided the next morning or otherwise be written up on the walls. Above the entrance to the school, it was written: \\"You may come in; your soul is lost.\\" There was also a law that forbade anyone to study at the school for more than three years. Whenever the students left in a given year, they had to leave at the same time. The devil would keep the last one remaining, and so they always drew lots to determine who would be the last one to leave. On more than one occasion the lot fell on S√¶mundr, and so he remained longer than the law permitted. One day, Bishop J√≥n was traveling through Rome and passed nearby. He found out that S√¶mundr was trapped in the Black School, so he offered him advice on how to escape as long as he returned to Iceland and behaved as a good Christian. S√¶mundr agreed, but as he and Bishop J√≥n were leaving the school, the Devil reached up and grabbed Bishop J√≥n's cloak. Bishop J√≥n escaped, but the Devil trapped S√¶mundr and made him a deal‚Äîif S√¶mundr could hide for three days, he would be able to return to Iceland. Ultimately, S√¶mundr was successful in hiding, and he presumably returned. Another account explains that when S√¶mundr left the Black School, he sewed a leg of mutton into his cloak, and he followed the rushing group out of the doors. When S√¶mundr was near the exit, the Devil reached up to grab his cloak but only grabbed the leg that was sewn into the clothing. S√¶mundr then dropped the cloak and ran, saying: \\"He grabbed, but I slipped away!\\".

Vergil is sometimes referred to in contemporary documents as Polydore Vergil Castellensis or Castellen, leading some to assume that he was a kinsman of his patron, Cardinal Adriano Castellesi. However, it is more likely that the alias simply indicates that he was in Castellesi's service.Hay 1952, p. 3. Biography Vergil's family home and alleged birthplace in Urbino, marked with a plaque (the lower of the two) =Early life in Italy= Vergil was born in about 1470 either at Urbino, or more probably at Fermignano, within the Duchy of Urbino.Connell 2004. His father, Giorgio di Antonio, owned a dispensary. His grandfather, Antonio Virgili, \\"a man well skilled in medicine and astrology\\", had taught philosophy at the University of Paris; as did Polydore's own brother, Giovanni-Matteo Virgili, at Ferrara and Padua. Another brother, Girolamo, was a merchant trading with England.Hay 1952, pp. 1, 15‚Äì16. The niece of Polydore Vergil, Faustina, married Lorenzo Borgogelli, count of Fano, from whom descend the family of Borgogelli Virgili. Polydore was educated at the University of Padua, and possibly at Bologna. He was ordained by 1496.Hay 1952, pp. 1‚Äì2. He was probably in the service of Guidobaldo da Montefeltro, Duke of Urbino, before 1498, as in the dedication of his Proverbiorum Libellus (April 1498) he styles himself Guido's client. His second book, De Inventoribus Rerum, was dedicated to Guido's tutor, Lodovico Odassio, in August 1499. At some point prior to 1502 Polydore entered the service of Pope Alexander VI. =Move to England= The \\"Old Archdeaconry\\" in Wells, traditionally identified as Vergil's residence there. Now the Music School of Wells Cathedral School In 1502, Vergil travelled to England as the deputy of Cardinal Adriano Castellesi in the office of Collector of Peter's Pence, and, in practice, the Cardinal's agent in a variety of affairs. In October 1504 he was enthroned Bishop of Bath and Wells as proxy for Adriano; and in 1508 he himself was installed as Archdeacon of Wells. He probably spent little time in Wells, but was active as the Chapter's representative in London.Hay 1952, pp. 8‚Äì9, 19‚Äì20. He also donated a set of hangings for the quire of Wells Cathedral.Harris 2005. He held other ecclesiastical sinecures, including, from 1503, the living of Church Langton, Leicestershire; from 1508 prebends in Lincoln and Hereford Cathedrals; and from 1513 the prebend of Oxgate in St Paul's Cathedral. As an established author, and a representative of Italian humanist learning, Vergil was received in England as a minor celebrity, and was welcomed at court by King Henry VII.Hay 1952, pp. 4‚Äì5. It was at the King's behest that he began work on his Anglica Historia, a new history of England, probably as early as 1505. On 22 October 1510, he was naturalised English. Early in 1515 ‚Äì through the intrigues of Andrea Ammonio, who sought the subcollectorship for himself ‚Äì an ill-judged letter from Vergil was intercepted by the authorities. It contained what was read as implied criticism of both Thomas Wolsey and Henry VIII, and as a result Vergil was imprisoned in April in the Tower of London. His supporters and advocates included Pope Leo X, who wrote to the King on his behalf. From prison Vergil wrote to Wolsey, begging that the approaching Christmas season ‚Äì a time which witnessed the restitution of a world ‚Äì might also see his pardon: his letter's tone has been described as \\"almost blasphemous\\". He was released before Christmas 1515, but never regained his subcollectorship.Hay 1952, pp. 10‚Äì13. =Return visits to Italy and death= Although Vergil lived predominantly in England from 1502 onwards, he paid several return visits to Urbino, in 1513‚Äì14, 1516‚Äì17 and 1533‚Äì34. In 1534, Francesco Maria, Duke of Urbino, in recognition of his literary achievements, admitted Vergil and his family to the ranks of the nobility.Franco Negroni, \\"Punctualizzazioni archivistiche sulla famiglia Virgili di Urbino\\", in Bacchielli 2003, pp. 39‚Äì51, at p. 42. In 1546 Vergil resigned the Archdeaconry of Wells to the Crown, perhaps in anticipation of his retirement to Italy. He was licensed to return to Urbino in 1550, and probably left England for the last time in the summer of 1553. He died in Urbino on 18 April 1555. Works =Perotti's Cornucopiae= Vergil published his first work in 1496. This was an edition of Niccol√≤ Perotti‚Äôs Cornucopiae latinae linguae, a commentary on Martial's Epigrams. =Proverbiorum Libellus (Adagia)= Vergil's Proverbiorum Libellus (Venice, 1498), retitled in later editions as Adagiorum Liber, and often known as the Adagia, was a collection of Latin proverbs. It was the first such collection printed, preceding the similar Adagia of Erasmus by two years. The initial controversy between the two authors that arose from their rival claims for priority (Erasmus still believed as late as 1533 that his work had been the earlier) gave place to a sincere friendship. The first edition of Vergil's work contained 306 proverbs taken from classical sources. A second, expanded, edition appeared in 1521: it contained a further series of 431 Biblical proverbs, and was dedicated to Wolsey's follower, Richard Pace. This edition is preceded by an interesting letter sent in June 1519, which gives the names of many of Vergil's English friends, including Thomas More, William Warham, Thomas Linacre and Cuthbert Tunstall. The Adagia ran through about 20 editions down to 1550. =De Inventoribus Rerum= Vergil's De Inventoribus Rerum was published in 1499, having been written in only three months. It was a history of origins and inventions, describing in three books the \\"first begetters\\" of all human activities. Book I investigated the origin of the gods and the word \\"God\\", along with such matters as the creation, marriage, religion and learning. Book II covered, among other topics, the origins of law, time, military science, money, precious metals and art. Book III covered, again among other topics, the origins of agriculture, architecture, towns, theatres, tools and materials, maritime navigation, commerce and prostitution. For the edition of 1521, Vergil added five more books, devoted to the initia institorum rei Christianae, i.e. the origins of Christian rites and institutions. He probably thought that this addition would be a popular one, but it was also a concession towards critics who had labelled the De Inventoribus a work of heretics and depravity. The work nonetheless included criticisms of monks, priestly celibacy, indulgences, and of the policies and constitutional status of the papacy. As a consequence it was placed on the Index Librorum Prohibitorum (papal list of prohibited books) in 1564: an expurgated text, sanctioned by Gregory XIII, was published in 1576. De Inventoribus was, however, exceedingly popular, and was quickly translated into French (1521), German (1537), English (1546) and Spanish (1551). Thirty Latin editions had been published by the time Vergil died in 1555; and the work eventually ran to around 70 Latin editions, and another 35 translations.Hay 1952, pp. 52, 74. The English edition of 1546 was an abridgement made by Thomas Langley, which also proved highly successful and was reprinted several times.Hay 1952, pp. 66‚Äì69. The work is notable for the immense industry that went into its compilation, and the range of ancient and modern writers on which Vergil was able to draw.Hay 1952, pp. 54‚Äì59. =Gildas ‚Ä¶de calamitate, excidio et conquestu Britanniae= In 1525 Vergil published an edition of Gildas' 6th-century history, De Excidio et Conquestu Britanniae, probably at Antwerp.Hay 1952, pp. 29‚Äì30. He dedicated it to Cuthbert Tunstall, Bishop of London. This was the first critical edition of a British historical text.Hay 1952, pp. 17, 30.Galdieri 1993, p. 319. In publishing it, Vergil reflected a growing interest in post-classical texts among German and Italian scholars. This interest sprang mainly from self-conscious nationalism which makes it curious at least that a foreigner chose a text about Britain. Vergil did, however, have a motive; this project provided a background for his anti- Arthurian position. Tunstall supplied one of the source manuscripts (hence the dedication), and the work of editing was undertaken by Vergil and Robert Ridley. Their editing was for the most part conscientious, although they rearranged certain words in the interests of clarity, and also suppressed a few anti-clerical passages.Hay 1952, pp. 30‚Äì31. =Dialogus de Prodigiis= Vergil's Dialogus de Prodigiis was written in 1526‚Äì27, and printed in 1531. It was dedicated to Francesco Maria, Duke of Urbino. This treatise, in three books, takes the form of a Latin dialogue between Vergil and his Cambridge friend Robert Ridley on the subject of the natural and the supernatural, and whether credence should be given to such alleged phenomena as prodigious events and portents. The setting for the dialogue is the open air, at Vergil's country house near London. Vergil's role is to state the problems and supply the historical illustrations; his friend's to explain, rationalise and depreciate as best he can.Hay 1952, pp. 34‚Äì45. The De Prodigiis also achieved great popularity, and was translated into Italian (1543), English (1546) and Spanish (1550). =Anglica Historia= Vergil's history of England, the Anglica Historia, was begun at the instigation of King Henry VII, perhaps as early as 1505. This first version was completed in 1512‚Äì13. However, the work was not published until 1534; and four distinct versions can therefore be identified: # Manuscript written in 1512‚Äì13: covering events up to 1513 (MS) # First edition, Basle, 1534, folio; covering events up to 1509 (A) # Second edition, Basle, 1546, folio: covering events up to 1509 (B) # Third edition, Basle, 1555, folio: covering events up to 1537 (C) The manuscript version is now held in the Vatican Library. Comprising two volumes, it was presented to the ducal library at Urbino in 1613 by Vergil's grand-nephew. Although he stated in prefatory notes that the manuscript was written in Vergil's hand ‚Äì an assessment fully supported by the palaeographic evidence ‚Äì it was at one time sometimes attributed to Federico Veterani. This misunderstanding arose from a colophon in the second volume, in a different hand, stating that \\"I, Federico Veterani, wrote the whole work\\". A possible explanation is that Vergil left it in the care of Veterani, who inscribed the colophon to associate it with his other treasures so that it would not be lost or damaged during the Papal invasion in Urbino in 1516. Further isolated notes in Veterani's hand, nearly all directions to a binder or printer, are found throughout the manuscript. The most plausible interpretation of the evidence is that Vergil intended to present a fine manuscript (rather than a printed book) to Henry VIII, and commissioned the work from Veterani, the most famous copyist of the day. However, no such copy by Veterani is known to have survived.Hay 1952, pp. 79‚Äì81. The manuscript version of the work was divided into 25 books. Books I‚ÄìVII described the early history of England up to the Norman conquest; Book VIII dealt with the reigns of William I and William II; and the following books covered one reign per book, ending in book XXV which dealt with the beginning of Henry VIII's reign to 1513. In 1534 the first printed version of the work appeared, a folio with decorations from John Bebel‚Äôs press in Basle. While this edition was broadly similar to the manuscript, it incorporated substantial changes, and it seems that Vergil effectively made a fresh start using the manuscript as a guideline. The rewriting appears to have taken place between 1521 and 1524 (based on one reference to his having been archdeacon of Wells for fourteen years; and another allusion to \\"this day, which is 1524\\"). Book VII of the manuscript was now split into two parts, the new book VIII running from the death of Cnut to 1066; while the reigns of the first two Norman kings, previously covered in a single book, were also divided between two books. The work had therefore gained two books, but now ended with book XXVI in 1509, no longer extending into the reign of Henry VIII.Hay 1952, pp. 81‚Äì82. The second edition appeared in 1546. This version also ended in 1509, but was much revised. The revisions included rewordings for political reasons, a greater emphasis on the civic history of London, and stylistic improvements of the Latin for European readers.Hay 1952, pp. 82‚Äì83. The third edition was published in 1555, the year of Vergil's death. In this case the revisions were minor and largely stylistic. However, Vergil added a new book (XXVII) giving an account of Henry VIII's reign to 1537, and which included a highly critical portrait of Wolsey. Vergil claimed that most of his work on the last book was done contemporaneously, and that the work was interrupted by a visit to Italy. This must refer to his visit of 1533‚Äì34, and the entire period from 1530 to 1537 is in fact treated cursorily. Denys Hay finds it reasonable to suppose that at first Vergil planned this book to describe events up to 1530, but that he postponed the publication of it due to the political uncertainties in England, enabling him to extend the terminal date.Hay 1952, pp. 83‚Äì84. Vergil drew on an impressively wide range of sources for his work, including published books and oral testimony.Hay 1952, pp. 85‚Äì95. He claimed to have been diligent in collecting materials, and to have drawn on the work of foreign as well as English historians. For this reason, he remarked, the English, Scots and French would find things reported in his pages far differently from the way they were used to hearing them within their own countries. In his search for information he applied to James IV of Scotland for a list of the Scottish kings and their annals; but not even his friendship with Gavin Douglas could make him accept the historical theories of the latter, who traced the pedigree of the Scots down from the banished son of an Athenian king and Scota, daughter of the Egyptian Pharaoh. Vergil opened the Anglica Historia with a passage heavily influenced by Caesar's Commentarii de Bello Gallico: > Britannia omnis...diuiditur in partes quatuor: quarum unam incolunt Angli, > aliam Scoti, tertiam Vualli, quartam Cornubienses. Hi omnes uel lingua; uel > moribus seu institutis inter se differunt.Polydore Vergil, Anglicae > Historiae (Basel 1557), p. 3. In an early English translation, this is rendered as: > The whole Countrie of Britaine...is divided into iiij partes ; wherof the > one is inhabited of Englishmen, the other of Scottes, the third of > Wallshemen, and the fowerth of Cornishe people. Which all differ emonge them > selves, either in tongue, either in manners, or ells in lawes and > ordinaunces.The opening lines to Caesar's Gallic War read in English as > follows: \\"Gaul as a whole is divided into three parts, one of which the > Belgae inhabit, the Aquitani another, those who in their own language are > called Celts (in ours Gauls), the third. All these differ from each other in > language, customs and laws.\\" =Other works= Vergil published a Commentariolum in Dominicam Precem (\\"Commentary on the Lord's Prayer\\") at Basle in 1525, accompanying an edition of the De Inventoribus Rerum. His comments owed much to Erasmus' Precatio Dominica in septem portiones distributa (1523).Hay 1952, pp. 31‚Äì34. At Erasmus' request, Vergil worked on a translation from the Greek of Dio Chrysostom's De Perfecto Monacho, which he published in 1533.Hay 1952, pp. 50‚Äì51. It was reprinted in 1541 and 1550. In 1545, he published his last work, the Dialogorum libri, a collection of Latin dialogues, divided into three parts as De patientia, De vita perfecta, and De veritate et mendacio.Hay 1952, pp. 45‚Äì49. Commemoration Vergil was buried in Urbino Cathedral, in the chapel of St Andrew which he himself had endowed. In 1613, it was agreed that a memorial stone should be set over his tomb. This was eventually put in place in 1631, with an inscription stating that his fame would \\"live for ever in the world\\".Negroni, \\"Punctualizzazioni archivistiche\\", pp. 42‚Äì45. However, it is believed to have been lost when the cathedral was severely damaged by an earthquake in 1789. Vergil's family home and alleged birthplace in Urbino (now a property of the University of Urbino) is marked by a plaque; and there is also a bust of him in the city, unveiled in 2000.Bacchielli 2003, pp. 75, 277. Vergil is among the worthies whose portraits were painted in c.1618‚Äì19 on the frieze in what is now the Upper Reading Room of the Bodleian Library, Oxford. Reputation and legacy In continental Europe, Vergil is principally remembered for the De Inventoribus Rerum and the Adagia: these are the works which secured his reputation before he ever came to England, and which he himself regarded as his masterpieces, writing \\"I, Polydore, was the first of the Romans to treat of these two matters\\".Hay 1949, p. 135. The De Inventoribus receives a mention, for example, in Cervantes' Don Quixote (1605‚Äì15).Hay 1952, pp. 75‚Äì76. In England, however, Vergil is more often remembered as author of the Anglica Historia. The work is an important primary source in its own right for the period 1460‚Äì1537, and as a secondary source continued to exert an influence on English historiography into the 19th century. It provided the chronicler Edward Hall with much of his sense of 15th-century English history, and so fed into the history plays of William Shakespeare.Hay 1952, pp. 127‚Äì28, 131‚Äì35, 155‚Äì68.Galdieri 1993, p. 317. A particularly controversial element of Vergil's work in England was the scepticism he expressed ‚Äì first in his edition of Gildas, and then in the Anglica Historia ‚Äì towards the traditional account of the early history of Britain derived from Geoffrey of Monmouth, and in particular towards the question of the historicity of King Arthur. This criticism touched a patriotic nerve with the antiquary John Leland, who responded forcefully, first in an unpublished tract, written perhaps in 1536, the Codrus sive Laus et Defensio Gallofridi Arturii contra Polydorum Vergilium (\\"Codrus\\", a reference to Vergil, was a type-name drawn from Juvenal for an offensive hack-poet); and afterwards in a longer published treatment, the Assertio inclytissimi Arturii regis Britannia (1544).Carley 1996. Although Leland was critical of Vergil's views in the Assertio, he treated his opponent with respect, acknowledging his intelligence and his mastery of Latin style. On another contentious issue, Vergil came down in favour of the claims of the University of Cambridge to be a more ancient foundation than the University of Oxford. When this was mentioned in a debate in the House of Commons in 1628, the Oxonian Edward Littleton sneered, \\"What have we to do with Polydore Vergil? One Vergil was a poet, the other a liar.\\" Other English readers also reacted vehemently to what seemed to be criticisms of their national history. John Bale in 1544 accused Vergil of \\"polutynge our Englyshe chronycles most shamefullye with his Romishe lyes and other Italyshe beggerye\\".Quoted in Connell 2004. An anonymous contemporary described him as \\"that most rascall dogge knave in the worlde\\", claiming that \\"he had the randsackings of all the Englishe lybraryes, and when he had extracted what he pleased he burnt those famous velome manuscripts, and made himself father to other mens workes\\".Quoted in Hay 1952, p. 159. This charge of burning manuscripts was widely reported. John Caius in 1574, for example, asserted that Vergil had \\"committed as many of our ancient and manuscript historians to the flames as would have filled a waggon, that the faults of his own work might pass undiscovered\\".Translated in William Lambarde in 1576 commented that \\"as [Vergil] was by office Collector of the Peter pence to the Popes gain and lucre, so sheweth he himselfe throughout by profession, a covetous gatherer of lying Fables, fained to advaunce the Popish Religion, Kingdome, and Myter\\". Henry Peacham in 1622 again accused Vergil of having \\"burned and embezeled the best and most ancient Records and Monuments of our Abbeies, Priories, and Cathedrall Churches, under colour ‚Ä¶ of making search for all such monuments, manusc. records, Legier bookes, &c.; as might make for his purpose\\". However, one of Peacham's contemporaries, the Leicestershire antiquary William Burton, cast Vergil in a more positive light, describing him as \\"a man of singular invention, good judgement, and good reading, and a true lover of antiquities\\". In the 19th century, Vergil's importance to English historiography finally began to be acknowledged, as \\"historians of Tudor England realized the scope of his achievement in the Anglica Historia\\".Galdieri 1993, p. 320.

In 1515, upon his return to England, he entered the service of Cardinal Wolsey where he was employed in diplomacy and espionage. In 1515, Pace became Wolsey's secretary and in 1516 a secretary of state, although he continued to engage in lengthy correspondence with the Cardinal on his orders. He was also collated Archdeacon of Dorset in 1514. holding the post until 1523.Chisholm, 1911 In 1515, Wolsey sent Pace to urge the Swiss to attack France. He was engaged in a lengthy negotiation with Emperor Maximillian I regarding Henry's support of the Emperor's activities against the French in northern Italy, but upon Wolsey's instructions, used the 100,000 florins deposited on his behalf in Antwerp to pay for Swiss soldiers. Maximillian wanted use of the funds, which he claimed had been promised to him by Henry, to levy troops in Switzerland and parts of the Austrian territories. Pace refused to act without direct orders from Henry, despite Maximillian's cajolery, demands, and frustration.Great Britain, Public Record Office, pp. xiii-xxiii. Following the Battle of Marignano, Pace was captured by the French and imprisoned for some time, but released in early spring.Great Britain, Public Record, pp. lxxix. In 1519, Pace returned to Germany (Holy Roman Empire) to discuss with the Prince-Electors the impending election of Maximillan's grandson Charles V to the imperial throne. He was made dean of St Paul's in 1519, holding the office until 1536. He was present at the Field of the Cloth of Gold in 1520, and in 1521 he went to Venice with the object of winning the support of the republic for Wolsey, who was anxious at this time to become pope. At the end of 1526 he was recalled to England, having been appointed Dean of Exeter (1522?‚Äì1527) and Dean of Salisbury (1523‚Äì1536) in his absence.

The species lived in coastal sand dunes of the Sunset District of San Francisco peninsula. The Xerces blue is believed to be the first American butterfly species to become extinct as a result of loss of habitat caused by urban development. The last Xerces blue was seen in 1941 or 1943 on land that is part of Golden Gate National Recreation Area. Specimens in California Academy of Sciences Preserved specimens are found in California Academy of Sciences, Bohart museum, and the Harvard Museum of Natural History. The species was first described and documented in 1852. It was characterized by blue wings with white spots. The butterflies fed on vegetation belonging to the genus Lotus and Lupinus. The loss of the Lotus plant that the butterfly fed on while in its larval stages is believed to be one reason for the extinction of the Xerces blue. The plant could not survive in the disturbed soils due to human development, and was no longer available to the Xerces blue. Lupin, Xerces blue's other vegetative food source, was not suitable for the Larval stages. Efforts are on to reestablish related butterflies in the Xerces blue's former habitat. The Palos Verdes blue (Glaucopsyche lygdamus palosverdesensis), which is considered a Los Angeles cousin of the Xerces, is being reared in labs. A new Xerces-like subspecies of the silvery blue (Glaucopsyche lygdamus) has been discovered as well. An endangered invertebrate conservation group known as the Xerces Society is named after the Xerces blue. The specific name derives from the French spelling of \\"Xerxes\\", the name of Persian kings Xerxes I and Xerxes II of the fifth century BC.

Biography He was born in Glasgow. His father, also William Elphinstone, later became the first Dean of the Faculty of Arts at the University of Glasgow. It has been suggested that his mother may have been Margaret Douglas, daughter of Sir William Douglas, the first laird of Drumlanrig.Macfarlane, Leslie J.

After practising for a short time as a lawyer in the church courts, he was ordained a priest, becoming rector of St. Michael's Church, Trongate, Glasgow, in 1465. Four years later he went to continue his studies at the University of Paris, where he became reader in Canon law, and then, proceeding to Orl√©ans, became lecturer in the university there. Before 1474 he had returned to Scotland, and was made academic rector of the university, and official of the see of Glasgow. Further promotion followed, but soon more important duties were entrusted to Elphinstone, who was made Bishop of Ross in 1481. He was a member of the Parliament of Scotland, and was sent by James III of Scotland on diplomatic missions to Louis XI of France and Edward IV of England. In 1483 he was appointed Bishop of Aberdeen, although his consecration was delayed for four years; and he was sent on missions to England, both before and after the death of Richard III of England in 1485. Although he regularly attended the meetings of parliament he continued with his episcopal duties, and maintained the fabric of the cathedral. Early in 1488 he was made Lord High Chancellor, but on the king's death in the following June he left office, and retired to Aberdeen. As a diplomat, his services were quickly required by the new king, James IV of Scotland, in whose interests he visited the kings of England and France, and the German king, Maximilian I, Holy Roman Emperor. Having been made Keeper of the Privy Seal of Scotland in 1492, and having arranged a dispute between the Scots and the Dutch, Elphinstone's later years were mainly spent in the foundation of the University of Aberdeen. The papal bull was obtained in 1494, and the royal charter which made Aberdeen the seat of a university is dated 1498. A small endowment was provided by the king. The university, modelled on that of Paris and intended principally as a law school, soon became the most famous and popular of the Scots seats of learning, largely due to the prestige of Elphinstone and his friend, Hector Boece, the first rector. The building of the college of the Holy Virgin in Nativity, now King's College, was completed in 1506. Elphinstone also built the central tower of St Machar's Cathedral, and funded the building of the first stone bridge over the River Dee. Continuing to participate in public affairs he opposed the policy of hostility towards England which led to the Battle of Flodden in September 1513. He died in Edinburgh. Elphinstone was partly responsible for the introduction of printing into Scotland, and for the production of the Breviarium Aberdonense. He may have written some of the lives in this collection, and gathered together materials concerning the history of Scotland.

Nureyev is regarded by some as the greatest male ballet dancer of his generation.Lord of the dance - Rudolf Nureyev at the National Film Theatre, London, 1‚Äì31 January 2003, by John Percival, The Independent, 26 December 2002.Rudolf Nureyev, Charismatic Dancer Who Gave Fire to Ballet's Image, Dies at 54, by Jack Anderson, The Independent, 7 January 1993.

Nureyev was born on a Trans-Siberian train near Irkutsk, Siberia, Soviet Union to a Bashkir-Tatar family. He began his early career with the company that in the Soviet era was called the Kirov Ballet (now called by its original name, the Mariinsky Ballet) in Leningrad. He defected from the Soviet Union to the West in 1961, despite KGB efforts to stop him. This was the first defection of a Soviet artist during the Cold War, and it created an international sensation. He went on to dance with The Royal Ballet in London and from 1983 to 1989 served as director of the Paris Opera Ballet. In addition to his technical prowess, Nureyev was an accomplished choreographer serving as the chief choreographer of the Paris Opera Ballet. He produced his own interpretations of numerous classical works, including Swan Lake, Giselle, and La Bayad√®re. Benjamin Millepied, le pari de St√©phane Lissner, Paris Match, 26 January 2013.  Early life  Nureyev was born on a Trans-Siberian train near Irkutsk, Siberia, while his mother, Farida, was travelling to Vladivostok, where his father Khamet, a Red Army political commissar, was stationed. He was raised as the only son with three older sisters in a Tatar Muslim family. Career =Education at Vaganova Academy= When his mother took Nureyev and his sisters into a performance of the ballet Song of the Cranes, he fell in love with dance. As a child, he was encouraged to dance in Bashkir folk performances and his precocity was soon noticed by teachers who encouraged him to train in Leningrad (now St. Petersburg). On a tour stop in Moscow with a local ballet company, Nureyev auditioned for the Bolshoi ballet company and was accepted. However, he felt that the Mariinsky Ballet school was the best, so he left the local touring company and bought a ticket to Leningrad. Owing to the disruption of Soviet cultural life caused by World War II, Nureyev was unable to enroll in a major ballet school until 1955, aged 17, when he was accepted by the Vaganova Academy of Russian Ballet of Leningrad, the associate school of the Mariinsky Ballet. The ballet master Alexander Ivanovich Pushkin took an interest in him professionally and allowed Nureyev to live with him and his wife. =Principal with Kirov ballet= Upon his graduation in 1958, Nureyev joined the Kirov Ballet (now Mariinsky). He moved immediately beyond the corps level, and was given solo roles as a principal dancer from the outset. Nureyev regularly partnered with Natalia Dudinskaya, the company's senior ballerina and wife of its director, Konstantin Sergeyev. Dudinskaya, who was 26 years his senior, first chose him as her partner in the ballet Laurencia. Before long, Nureyev became one of the Soviet Union's best- known dancers. From 1958 to 1961, in his three years with the Kirov, he danced 15 roles, usually opposite his partner, Ninel Kurgapkina, with whom he was very well paired, although she was almost a decade older than he was. Nureyev and Kurgapkina were invited to dance at a gathering at Khrushchev's dacha, and in 1959 they were allowed to travel outside the Soviet Union, dancing in Vienna at the International Youth Festival. Not long after, he was told by the Ministry of Culture that he would not be allowed to go abroad again.Watson, P., Nureyev: A Biography, p.147 In one memorable incident, Nureyev interrupted a performance of Don Quixote for 40 minutes, insisting on dancing in tights and not in the customary trousers. He relented in the end, but his preferred dress code was adopted in later performances. =Defection at Paris airport= Rudolf Nureyev after his defection from the Soviet Union in 1961. By the late 1950s, Nureyev had become a sensation in the Soviet Union. Yet, as the Kirov Ballet was preparing to go on a tour to Paris and London, Nureyev's rebellious character and non-conformist attitude made him an unlikely candidate for the trip, which the Soviet government considered crucial to its ambitions to demonstrate its \\"cultural supremacy\\" over the West. Furthermore, tensions were growing between Nureyev and the Kirov's artistic director Konstantin Sergeyev, who was also the husband of Nureyev's former dance partner Natalia Dudinskaya. After a representative of the French tour organizers saw Nureyev dance in Leningrad in 1960, the French organizers urged Soviet authorities to let him dance in Paris, and he was allowed to go. In Paris, his performances electrified audiences and critics. Oliver Merlin in Le Monde wrote, > I will never forget his arrival running across the back of the stage, and > his catlike way of holding himself opposite the ramp. He wore a white sash > over an ultramarine costume, had large wild eyes and hollow cheeks under a > turban topped with a spray of feathers, bulging thighs, immaculate tights. > This was already Nijinsky in Firebird.Watson, P., Nureyev: A Biography, > p.152 Nureyev was seen to have broken the rules about mingling with foreigners and allegedly frequented gay bars in Paris, which alarmed the Kirov's managementWatson, P., Nureyev: A Biography, p.151 and the KGB agents observing him. The KGB wanted to send him back to the Soviet Union. On 16 June 1961 when the Kirov company gathered at Le Bourget Airport in Paris to fly to London, Sergeyev took Nureyev aside and told him that he must return to Moscow for a special performance in the Kremlin, rather than go on to London with the rest of the company. Nureyev became suspicious and refused. Next he was told that his mother had fallen severely ill and he needed to go home immediately to see her.Watson, P., Nureyev: A Biography, p.161 Nureyev refused again, believing that on return to the USSR he was likely to be imprisoned. With the help of French police and a Parisian socialite friend, Clara Saint, who had been engaged to the son of the French Minister of Culture, Andre Malraux, Nureyev escaped his KGB minders and asked for asylum. Sergeyev and the KGB tried to dissuade him, but he chose to stay in Paris. Within a week, he was signed by the Grand Ballet du Marquis de Cuevas and performing The Sleeping Beauty with Nina Vyroubova. On a tour of Denmark he met Erik Bruhn, soloist at the Royal Danish BalletAt the time of Nureyev's meeting Bruhn, soloist was the Royal Danish Ballet's highest rank. who became his lover, his closest friend and his protector until Bruhn's death in 1986. Soviet authorities made Nureyev's father, mother and dance teacher Pushkin write letters to him, urging him to return, without effect. Although he petitioned the Soviet government for many years to be allowed to visit his mother, he was not allowed to do so until 1987, when his mother was dying and Mikhail Gorbachev consented to the visit. In 1989, he was invited to dance the role of James in La Sylphide with the Mariinsky Ballet at the Mariinsky Theatre in Leningrad.Watson, P., Nureyev: A Biography, p.426 The visit gave him the opportunity to see many of the teachers and colleagues he had not seen since his defection.Watson, P., Nureyev: A Biography, p.429 =The Royal Ballet= Principal dancer Nureyev with Liliana Cosi in Rome, 1972. Dame Ninette de Valois offered him a contract to join The Royal Ballet as Principal Dancer. During his time at the company, however, many critics became enraged as Nureyev made substantial changes to the productions of Swan Lake and Giselle.Ballets in which he partnered with Fonteyn. Nureyev stayed with the Royal Ballet until 1970, when he was promoted to Principal Guest Artist, enabling him to concentrate on his increasing schedule of international guest appearances and tours. He continued to perform regularly with The Royal Ballet until committing his future to the Paris Opera Ballet in the 1980s. Fonteyn and Nureyev Margot Fonteyn, Fred Astaire and Nureyev from a 1965 appearance on the US television show The Hollywood Palace. Nureyev's first appearance with Prima Ballerina Dame Margot Fonteyn was in a ballet matin√©e organized by The Royal Ballet: Giselle, 21 February 1962. The event was held in aid of the Royal Academy of Dance, a classical ballet teaching organisation of which she was president. He danced Po√®me Tragique, a solo choreographed by Frederick Ashton, and the Black Swan pas de deux from Swan Lake. They were so well received that Fonteyn and Nureyev proceeded to form a partnership which endured for many years. They premiered Romeo and Juliet for the company in 1965. This ballet had been originally created for Lynn Seymour and Christopher Gable. Fans of the duo would tear up their programs to make confetti that'd be joyously thrown at the dancers. Nureyev and Fonteyn might do upwards of 20 curtain calls.See section \\"Nureyev and his dance partnerships\\". On 11 July 1967, Fonteyn and Nureyev, after performing in San Francisco, were arrested on nearby roofs having fled during a police raid on a home in the Haight-Ashbury district. They were bailed out and charges of disturbing the peace and visiting a place where marijuana was used were dropped later that day for lack of sufficient evidence.From the archive, 12 July 1967: Charges against ballet stars dropped, The Guardian, 12 July 2013. Retrieved 6 April 2019. =Other international appearances= Among many appearances in North America, Nureyev developed a long-lasting connection with the National Ballet of Canada, appearing as a guest artist on many occasions. In 1972, he staged a spectacular new production of Sleeping Beauty for the company, with his own additional choreography augmenting that of Petipa. The production toured widely in the US and Canada after its initial run in Toronto, one performance of which was televised live and subsequently issued in video. Among the National Ballet's ballerinas, Nureyev most frequently partnered Veronica Tennant and Karen Kain. In 1975 Nureyev worked extensively with ABT resurrecting Le Corsaire with Gelsey Kirkland. He recreated Sleeping Beauty, Swan Lake and Ramonda with Cynthia Gregory. Gregory and Brun joined Nureyev in a pas des trois from the little known Bournonville ballet La VentanaNureyev-His Life by Diane Solway,p 404 =Director of the Paris Opera Ballet= In 1982, Nureyev became a naturalized citizen of Austria. In 1983, he was appointed director of the Paris Opera Ballet, where, as well as directing, he continued to dance and to promote younger dancers. He remained there as a dancer and chief choreographer until 1989. Among the dancers he mentored were Sylvie Guillem, Isabelle Gu√©rin, Manuel Legris, Elisabeth Maurin, √âlisabeth Platel, Charles Jude, and Monique Loudi√®res. His artistic directorship of the Paris Opera Ballet was a great success, lifting the company out of a dark period. His Sleeping Beauty remains in the repertoire and was revived and filmed with his prot√©g√© Manuel Legris in the lead. Despite advancing illness towards the end of his tenure, he worked tirelessly, staging new versions of old standbys and commissioning some of the most ground-breaking choreographic works of his time. His own Romeo and Juliet was a popular success. When he was sick towards the end of his life, he worked on a final production of La Bayad√®re which closely follows the Mariinsky Ballet version he danced as a young man. =Final years= When AIDS appeared in France's news around 1982, Nureyev took little notice. The dancer tested positive for HIV in 1984, but for several years he simply denied that anything was wrong with his health. However, by the late 1980s his diminished capabilities disappointed his admirers who had fond memories of his outstanding prowess and skill.Watson, P., Nureyev: A Biography, p.407 Nureyev began a marked decline only in the summer of 1991 and entered the final phase of the disease in the spring of 1992. In March 1992, living with advanced AIDS, he visited Kazan and appeared as a conductor in front of the audience at Musa C√§lil Tatar Academic Opera and Ballet Theater, which now presents the Rudolf Nureyev Festival in Tatarstan.Yaroslav Sedov. Russian Life. Montpelier: Jan/Feb 2006. Vol. 49, Iss. 1; p. 49 Returning to Paris, with a high fever, he was admitted to the hospital Notre Dame du Perp√©tuel Secours in Levallois- Perret, a suburb northwest of Paris, and was operated on for pericarditis, an inflammation of the membranous sac around the heart. At that time, what inspired him to fight his illness was the hope that he could fulfill an invitation to conduct Prokofiev's Romeo and Juliet at an American Ballet Theatre benefit on 6 May 1992 at the Metropolitan Opera House in New York. He did so and was elated at the reception. In July 1992, Nureyev showed renewed signs of pericarditis but determined to forswear further treatment. His last public appearance was on 8 October 1992, at the premiere at Palais Garnier of a new production of La Bayad√®re that he choreographed after Marius Petipa for the Paris Opera Ballet. Nureyev had managed to obtain a photocopy of the original score by Minkus when in Russia in 1989.Watson, P., Nureyev: A Biography, p.441 The ballet was a personal triumph although the gravity of his condition was evident. The French Culture Minister, Jack Lang, presented him that evening on stage with France's highest cultural award, the Commandeur de l'Ordre des Arts et des Lettres. Death and funeral Nureyev's tomb in Sainte-Genevi√®ve-des-Bois Nureyev re-entered the hospital Notre Dame du Perp√©tuel Secours in Levallois-Perret on 20 November 1992 and remained there until his death from AIDS complications at age 54 on 6 January 1993. His funeral was held in the marble foyer of the Paris Garnier Opera House. Many paid tributes to his brilliance as a dancer. One such tribute came from Oleg Vinogradov of the Mariinsky Ballet, stating: \\"What Nureyev did in the west, he could never have done here.\\"Watson, P., Nureyev: A Biography, p.455 Nureyev's grave, at the Russian cemetery in Sainte-Genevi√®ve-des-Bois near Paris, features a tomb draped in a mosaic of an Oriental carpet. Nureyev was an avid collector of beautiful carpets and antique textiles. As his coffin was lowered into the ground, music from the last act of Giselle was played and his ballet shoes were cast into the grave along with white lilies.Watson, P., Nureyev: A Biography, p.457  Tributes  After so many years of having been denied a place in the Mariinsky Ballet's history, Nureyev's reputation was restored. His name was re-entered in the history of the Mariinsky, and some of his personal effects were placed on display at the theatre museum in what was now St. Petersburg. A rehearsal room was named in his honor at the famed Vaganova Academy. As of October 2013, the Centre National du Costume de Scene has a permanent collection of Nureyev's costumes \\"that offers visitors a sense of his exuberant, vagabond personality and passion for all that was rare and beautiful.\\" In 2015, he was inducted into the Legacy Walk. Since his death in 1993, the Paris Opera has instituted a tradition of presenting an evening of dance homage to Nureyev every ten years. Because he was born in March, these performances have been given on 20 March 2003 and 6 March 2013.Tribute to Rudolf Nureyev - Ballet de l'Op√©ra de Paris (2012-2013 season), Homage to Rudolf Noureev, ballet director Brigitte Lef√®vre explains why Peers of Nureyev who speak about and remember him, like Mikhail Baryshnikov, are often deeply touched.Speaking to an audience Brigitte Lef√®vre and Mikhail Baryshnikov refer to Nureyev as Rudolf. Repertoire A selected list of ballet performances, ballet productions and original ballets. Dance partnerships Rudolf Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn in the Grand adage from Nureyev's staging of the Petipa/Minkus The Kingdom of the Shades for the Royal Ballet, London, 1963. Yvette Chauvir√© of the Paris Opera Ballet often danced with Nureyev; he described her as a \\"legend\\". (Chauvir√© attended his funeral with French dancer and actress Leslie Caron.) At the Royal Ballet, Nureyev and Margot Fonteyn became long-standing dance partners. Nureyev once said of Fonteyn, who was 19 years older than he, that they danced with \\"one body, one soul\\". Together Nureyev and Fonteyn premiered Sir Frederick Ashton's ballet Marguerite and Armand, a ballet danced to Liszt's Piano Sonata in B minor, which became their signature piece. Kenneth MacMillan was forced to allow them to premiere his Romeo and Juliet, which was intended for two other dancers, Lynn Seymour and Christopher Gable.Watson, P., Nureyev: A Biography, p.283 Films exist of their partnership in Les Sylphides, Swan Lake, Romeo and Juliet, and other roles. They continued to dance together for many years after Nureyev's departure from the Royal Ballet. Their last performance together was in Baroque Pas de Trois on 16 September 1988 when Fonteyn was 69, Nureyev was aged 50, with Carla Fracci, aged 52, also starring. He celebrated another long-time partnership with Eva Evdokimova. They first appeared together in La Sylphide (1971) and in 1975 he selected her as his Sleeping Beauty in his staging for London Festival Ballet. Evdokimova remained his partner of choice for many guest appearances and tours across the globe with \\"Nureyev and Friends\\" for more than fifteen years. During his American stage debut in 1962, Nureyev also partnered with Sonia Arova at New York City's Brooklyn Academy of Music. In collaboration with Ruth Page's Chicago Opera Ballet, they performed the grand pas de deux from Don Quixote.Rudolf Nureyev 1938 - 1993 by Michelle Potter - on Dance Heritage Coalition at Danceheritage.orgRudolf Nureyev, Charismatic Dance Who Gave Fire to Ballet's Image, Dies at 54, The New York Times, 7 January 1993Ruth Page: Early Architect of the American Ballet by Joellen A. Meglin on Dance Heritage Coalition, Danceheritage.orgThe Ruth Page Collection 1918-70 at the New York Public Library Archives Legacy =As an influence= Nureyev coaching Devon Carney in his production of Don Quixote. Nureyev was above all a stickler for classical technique, and his mastery of it made him a model for an entire generation of dancers. If the standard of male dancing rose so visibly in the West after the 1960s, it was largely because of Nureyev's inspiration. Nureyev's influence on the world of ballet changed the perception of male dancers; in his own productions of the classics the male roles received much more choreography. Another important influence was his crossing the borders between classical ballet and modern dance by performing both.Watson, P., Nureyev: A Biography, p.436 Today it is normal for dancers to receive training in both styles, but Nureyev was the originator and excelled in modern and classical dance. He went out of his way to work with modern dance great, Martha Graham, and she created a work specially for him.Watson, P., Nureyev: A Biography, pp.339‚Äì340 While Gene Kelly had done much to combine modern and classical styles in film, he came from a more Modern Dance influenced \\"popular dance\\" environment, while Nureyev made great strides in gaining acceptance of Modern Dance in the \\"Classical Ballet\\" sphere. Nureyev's charisma, commitment and generosity were such that he did not just pass on his knowledge.Charles JUDE Artistic Director for the Bordeaux National Opera, site of the Nureyev foundation. He personified the school of life for a dancer. Several dancers, who were principals with the Paris Opera Ballet under his direction, went on to become ballet directors themselves inspired to continue Nureyev's work and ideas. Manuel Legris is director of the Vienna State Ballet, Laurent Hilaire is ballet director of the Stanislavski Theatre of Moscow and Charles Jude ballet director of the Grand Th√©√¢tre de Bordeaux. Mikhail Baryshnikov, the other great dancer who like Nureyev defected to the West, holds Nureyev in high regard. Baryshnikov said in an interview that Nureyev was an unusual man in all respects, instinctive, intelligence, constant curiosity, and extraordinary discipline, that was his goal of life and of course love in performing.Mikhail Baryshnikov about Rudolf Nureyev, interview with Mikhail Baryshnikov filmed by David Makhateli at Le Palais des Congr√®s in May 2013, D&D; Art Productions (1 min 55)Baryshnikov's tribute to Nureyev, the wording of Mikhail Baryshnikov's statement about Rudolf Nureyev, filmed by David Makhateli at Le Palais des Congr√®s in May 2013, site of the Nureyev foundation. =Technique and quest for perfection= Nureyev had a late start to ballet and had to perfect his technique in order to be a success. John Tooley wrote that Nureyev grew up very poor and had to make up for three to five years in ballet education at a high-level ballet school, giving him a decisive impetus to acquire the maximum of technical skills and to become the best dancer working on perfection during his whole career.Sir John Tooley - Nureyev's influence on the development of Ballet in the West, official site of the Nureyev foundation. The challenge for all dancers whom Nureyev worked with was to follow suit and to share his total commitment for dance. Advocates to describe the Nureyev phenomenon precisely are John Tooley, former general director of the Royal Opera House, London, Pierre Berg√©, former president of Op√©ra Bastille, venue of the Paris Opera Ballet (in addition to the Palais Garnier) and Manuel Legris, principal dancer with the Paris Opera Ballet nominated by Nureyev in New York. Nureyev put it like this: \\"I approach dancing from a different angle than those who begin dancing at 8 or 9. Those who have studied from the beginning never question anything.\\"Rudolf Nureyev's childhood in Russia, citation of Rudolf Nureyev, official site of the Nureyev foundation. Nureyev entered the Vaganova Ballet Academy at the age of just 17 staying there for only 3 years compared to dancers who usually become principal dancers after entering the Vaganova school at 9 and go through the full 9 years of dance education. Vladimir Vasiliev, a peer of Nureyev at the Bolshoi and regarded along with Nureyev and Mikhail Baryshnikov as one of the top three ballet dancers, became a pupil of the Vaganova Ballet Academy in 1949, graduating in 1958 together with Nureyev. Like Nureyev, Baryshnikov spent only three yearsMikhail Baryshnikov was a pupil of the Vaganova Ballet Academy from 1964 to 1967. at the Vaganova school of Leningrad. Paradoxically, both Nureyev and Mikhail Baryshnikov became masters of perfection in dance.Michael Gard (2006). Men who Dance: Aesthetics, Athletics & the Art of Masculinity, New York, Peter Lang Publishing Inc., p. 65.Mikhail Baryshnikov, biography, site of the Kennedy center. Dance and life was one and the same, Pierre Berg√© said about Nureyev: \\"He was a dancer like any other dancer. It is extraordinary to have 19 points out of 20. It is extremely rare to have 20 out of 20. However, to have 21 out of 20 is even much rarer. And this was the situation with Nureyev.\\"Il √©tait danseur comme les autres. C'est formidable d'avoir 19 sur 20. C'est tr√®s rare d'avoir 20 sur 20. Mais, d'avoir 21 sur 20, c'est encore beaucoup plus rare. Et √ßa, c'√©tait le cas de Noureev. ¬ª (original citation of Pierre Berg√©).Obituary in LeSoir France in 1993 Legris said: \\"Rudolf Nureyev was a high-speed train (he was a TGV).\\"¬´ Rudolf Noureev √©tait un TGV. ¬ª (original citation of Manuel Legris).La Danse: The Paris Opera Ballets, documentary film by Frederick Wiseman, 2009. Working with Nureyev involved having to surpass oneself and \\"stepping on it.\\" Rudolf Noureev, danseur et chor√©graphe, review by Kader Belarbi, 6 November 2013, website of the Th√©√¢tre du Capitol, Paris, extract: \\"√Ä c√¥t√© de lui, il fallait vraiment se surpasser. ... √Ä partir de ce moment-l√†, j‚Äôai commenc√© √† mettre les bouch√©es doubles.\\" - By his side, you had to surpass oneself. ... From this very moment I started stepping on it. (Kader Belarbi, principal dancer with the Paris Opera Ballet when Nureyev was director and chief choreographer). Personal life Nureyev in his dressing room c. 1974, by Allan Warren Nureyev did not have much patience with rules, limitations and hierarchical order and had at times a volatile temper.Watson, P., Nureyev: A Biography, p.133 He was apt to throw tantrums in public when frustrated. His impatience mainly showed itself when the failings of others interfered with his work. He socialized with Gore Vidal, Freddie Mercury, Jackie Kennedy Onassis, Mick Jagger, Liza Minnelli, Andy Warhol, Lee Radziwill and Talitha Pol, Jessye Norman, Tamara Toumanova and occasionally visited the New York discotheque Studio 54 in the late 1970s, but developed an intolerance for celebrities.Watson, P., Nureyev: A Biography, p.370 He kept up old friendships in and out of the ballet world for decades, and was considered to be a loyal and generous friend.Watson, P., Nureyev: A Biography, p.369 Most ballerinas with whom Nureyev danced, including Antoinette Sibley, Cynthia Gregory, Gelsey Kirkland and Annette Page, paid tribute to him as a considerate partner. He was known as extremely generous to many ballerinas, who credit him with helping them during difficult times. In particular, the Canadian ballerina Lynn Seymour ‚Äì distressed when she was denied the opportunity to premiere MacMillan's Romeo and Juliet ‚Äì says that Nureyev often found projects for her even when she was suffering from weight problems and depression and thus had trouble finding roles.Watson, P., Nureyev: A Biography, p.321. Depending on the source, Nureyev is described as either bisexual, as he did have heterosexual relationships as a younger man, or homosexual.Kavanagh, Julie Nureyev: The Life (2007) He had a turbulent relationship life, with numerous bathhouse visits and anonymous pickups. Nureyev met Erik Bruhn, the celebrated Danish dancer, after Nureyev defected to the West in 1961. Nureyev was a great admirer of Bruhn, having seen filmed performances of the Dane on tour in the Soviet Union with the American Ballet Theatre, although stylistically the two dancers were very different. Bruhn and Nureyev became a couple and the two remained together off and on, with a very volatile relationship for 25 years, until Bruhn's death in 1986. In 1973, Nureyev met the 23-year-old American dancer and classical arts student Robert Tracy and a two-and-a-half-year love affair began. Tracy later became Nureyev's secretary and live-in companion for over 14 years in a long-term open relationship until death. According to Tracy, Nureyev said that he had a relationship with three women in his life, he had always wanted a son, and once had plans to father one with Nastassja Kinski. Nureyev learned that he had contracted HIV in 1984. He lived with the disease in secret, occasionally performing but with a marked decline in appearances. He was admitted to the H√¥pital Notre-Dame du Perp√©tuel Secours in Levallois, a suburb northwest of Paris, for pericarditis, an inflammation of the membranous sac around the heart. He eventually succumbed to the AIDS-related complication on 6 January 1993. Film, television and musical roles In 1962, Nureyev made his screen debut in a film version of Les Sylphides. He decided against an acting career in order to branch into modern dance with the Dutch National Ballet\\"Chris Chambers meets Rudi van Dantzig\\", Radio Netherlands Archives, October 13, 2002 in 1968.

In 1973, a film version of Don Quixote was directed by Nureyev and Helpmann and features Nureyev as Basilio, Lucette Aldous as Kitri, Helpmann as Don Quixote and artists of the Australian Ballet. In 1977, Nureyev played Rudolph Valentino in Ken Russell's film Valentino. In 1978, he appeared as a guest star on the television series The Muppet Show where he danced in a parody called \\"Swine Lake\\", sang \\"Baby, It's Cold Outside\\" in a sauna duet with Miss Piggy, and sang and tap-danced in the show's finale, \\"Top Hat, White Tie and Tails\\". His appearance is credited with making Jim Henson's series become one of the sought after programs to appear in. In 1983, he had a non-dancing role in the movie Exposed with Nastassja Kinski. In 1989, he toured the United States and Canada for 24 weeks with a revival of the Broadway musical The King and I. = Documentary films = * Rudolf Noureev au travail √† la barre (Rudolf Noureev Exercising at the Barre) (1970) (4 min 13) * Nureyev (1981), by Thames Television.

He was in some ways the most successful of the four, since he won the civil war that had been dragging on with the supporters of the exiled Mary, Queen of Scots. However, he came to an unfortunate end, executed by means of the Maiden, a predecessor of the guillotine. Biography =Early life= James Douglas was the second son of Sir George Douglas of Pittendreich, Master of Angus, and Elizabeth Douglas, daughter David Douglas of Pittendreich. He wrote that he was over 61 years old in March 1578, so was probably born around 1516.Hewitt, George R., Scotland under Morton, John Donald (1982), p.1 Before 1543 he married Elizabeth, daughter of James Douglas, 3rd Earl of Morton. In 1553 James Douglas succeeded to the title and estates of his father-in-law, including Dalkeith House in Midlothian, and Aberdour Castle in Fife. Elizabeth Douglas and her two elder sisters, who were married to Regent Arran and Lord Maxwell, suffered from mental ill-health.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol.1 (1898), p.615 Their children either did not survive to adulthood, or in the case of three daughters were declared legally incompetent in 1581. James also had five illegitimate childrenHewitt (1982), 207. At the start of war of the Rough Wooing, James and his brother David communicated with Henry VIII of England on the possibility of their surrendering Tantallon Castle to the English army that burnt Edinburgh in 1544. However, four years later he defended Dalkeith Palace against the English and was captured in June 1548, \\"sore hurt on the thigh [in those times often a euphemism for the male genitalia]\\" and taken as a hostage to England. After the Treaty of Boulogne brought peace, in 1550 James returned from captivity in England and was exchanged for the English soldier John Luttrell, and began to use his title of \\"Earl of Morton.\\" In 1559 James's political activities and allegiances during the Scottish Reformation were at first equivocal, but in February 1560 he signed the Treaty of Berwick which invited an English army into Scotland to expel the Catholic regime of Mary of Guise.Hewitt, (1982), p.1-3, citing for Tantallon,Letters & Papers Henry VIII, vol. 19 part 1 p.213, and Maitland Miscellany, vol.4. pp. 94-5, 98-9. He took part in the unsuccessful embassy to England in November 1560 to treat for the marriage of Elizabeth I of England to James Hamilton, 3rd Earl of Arran.Adams, Simon ed., Household Accounts of Robert Dudley, Earl of Leicester, Camden 5th Series vol. 6, RHS/CUP, (1995), 146 note: Hewitt (1982), p.4 On their way back from London Grey de Wilton hosted the Scottish ambassadors at Berwick and gave the Earl of Morton a personal tour of the latest fortifications.Joseph Bain, Calendar State Papers Scotland: 1547-1563, vol. 1 (Edinburgh, 1898), p. 504. Morton's town houseHistory of High Street Hostel and the Building at High Street Hostel,Edinburgh. Accessed 6 February 2012 in Edinburgh is now a backpackers' hostel In 1563 he became Lord Chancellor of Scotland. Though his sympathies were with the reformers, he took no part in the combination of Protestant reformers in 1565, but he headed the armed force which took possession of Holyrood palace in March 1566 to effect the assassination of David Rizzio, and the leading conspirators adjourned to Morton's house while a messenger was sent to obtain Queen Mary's signature to the \\"bond of security\\". The Queen, before complying with the request, escaped to Dunbar, and Morton and the other leaders fled to England. Having been pardoned, Morton returned to Scotland early in 1567, and with 600 men appeared before Borthwick Castle, where the Queen had taken refuge after her marriage to Bothwell. Morton attended the remarkable stand-off at the battle of Carberry Hill in June 1567, Mary's new husband, James Hepburn, 4th Earl of Bothwell offered to settle the matter by single combat. When Patrick, Lord Lindsay took up the challenge, Morton gave Lindsay the sword of his ancestor, Archibald Douglas, 5th Earl of Angus. Mary vetoed a fight, and surrendered.Hewitt (1982), 10, citing Calderwood, History of the Kirk of Scotland, (1843), pp.363-4. Morton took an active part in obtaining the consent of the queen, while she was imprisoned at Lochleven Castle, to her abdication in July 1567. When Mary escaped from Lochleven, he led the vanguard of the army which defeated her forces at the Battle of Langside in 1568, and he was the most valued privy counsellor of the Earl of Moray during the latter's brief term of office as Regent of Scotland. =Regent of Scotland= Scotland was now ruled by Regents on behalf of Mary's infant son, James VI of Scotland, who faced a civil war. James Stewart, Regent Moray, Mary's half- brother, was assassinated in Linlithgow and then Matthew Stewart, Regent Lennox died from a gunshot wound after a struggle on the streets of Stirling. On 18 November 1571, the new Regent, John Erskine, Earl of Mar, sent Morton with Robert Pitcairn, Commendator of Dunfermline and James MacGill of Nether Rankeillour to negotiate with Elizabeth's representative Henry Carey, 1st Baron Hunsdon, Governor of Berwick upon Tweed. Mar wanted English help to capture Edinburgh Castle from Sir William Kirkcaldy of Grange who held it for Mary, Queen of Scots. Regent Mar hoped that Morton could arrange for 12 cannons, 3000 foot soldiers, and wages for the 800 Scottish foot soldiers and 200 horsemen already in the field. Morton was instructed to offer six hostages to England from the sons of the nobility who supported James VI. He also discussed returning the Earl of Northumberland to England who was a fugitive after the failed Rising of the North. A week later Morton wrote to Hunsdon with the same request, urging an attack in winter because the Castle was vulnerable when the Nor' Loch was frozen. Hunsdon replied that Elizabeth still hoped for a peaceful settlement, but he would send an estimate of the expedition's cost to Elizabeth. Morton received a token payment. The English rebels were handed over. The treaty for military aid was still not finalised when Mar died at Stirling in October 1572.Cameron, Annie, Warrender Papers, vol. 1 (SHS: Edinburgh, 1931), pp. 104-11,115: Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1905), pp. 47-8, 52-4. On 24 November 1572, a month after the death of Regent Mar, Morton, who had been the most powerful noble during Mar and Lennox's rule, at last reached the object of his ambition by being elected regent. As Regent of Scotland, Morton expected the support of England and Elizabeth, and a week after his election, he wrote to William Cecil, Lord Burghley following his discussions with the English ambassador Henry Killigrew; > The knowledge of her Majesty's meaning has chiefly moved me to accept the > charge (the Regency), resting in assured hope of her favourable protection > and maintenance, especially for the present payment of our men-of-war their > bypast wages, \\"without the quhilk I salbe drevin in mony great > inconvenientis.\\"Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 4 (Edinburgh, 1905) p. > 441 no. 488, partly modernised in the Calendar In many respects Morton was an energetic and capable ruler. His first achievement was the conclusion of the civil war in Scotland against the supporters of the exiled Mary, Queen of Scots. In February 1573 he effected a pacification with George Gordon, 5th Earl of Huntly, the Hamiltons, and other Catholic nobles who supported Mary at Perth, with the aid of Elizabeth's envoy, Henry Killigrew.Hewitt (1982), p.25 Edinburgh Castle still held out for Mary under the command of William Kirkcaldy of Grange and William Maitland of Lethington, and after a long siege the castle was taken on 27 May 1573, aided by English artillery and soldiers which finally arrived under William Drury. The ensuing execution of the leaders of the Castle garrison men put an end to the last chance of Mary's restoration by native support. In July 1573 Morton had the king's chamber at Stirling Castle panelled, 60 new gold buttons made for his clothes, and gave him a football.Charles Thorpe McInnes, Accounts of the Treasurer: 1566-1574, vol. 12 (Edinburgh, 1970), p. 354. He made efforts to recover jewels belonging to Mary which were held by Agnes Keith, Countess of Moray and others.Thomas Thomson, A Collection of Royal Inventories (Edinburgh, 1815) pp. 195‚Äì200. While all now seemed to favour Morton, under- currents combined to procure his fall. The Presbyterian clergy were alienated by his leaning to Episcopacy, and all parties in the divided Church disliked his seizure of its estates. Andrew Melville, who had taken over as leader of the Kirk from John Knox, was firmly against any departure from the Presbyterian model, and refused to be won by a place in Morton's household. Morton rigorously pursued the collection of a third of the income from every Church benefice, a revenue that had been allocated to finance the King's household. Morton had discretion to exempt persons and institutions from paying these thirds, and the historian George Hewitt found no striking evidence of bias in Morton's exemptions.Hewitt, (1982), pp. 82-91. In 1575 Morton obtained six \\"snaphaunce\\" musket hand guns from Flanders to serve as patterns for long guns called \\"calivers\\". The Edinburgh gunmakers were ready to make 50 every week, they also made pistols called \\"dags\\" which equipped most of the gentlemen of Scotland. He sent a goldsmith Michael Sym to London for tools for the royal mint. Sym was also sent to buy silver plate for Morton and have some rubies cut for him.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1907), pp. 182, 197. In 1577 Morton was granted the barony of Stobo. However, over the next few months, opposition to Morton grew led by the Earl of Argyll and the Earl of Atholl, both leading Roman Catholics and members of the Queen's party, in league with Alexander Erskine of Gogar, governor of Stirling Castle and custodian of the young James VI. Morton was finally forced to resign as Regent in March 1578, but retained much of his power. He surrendered Edinburgh Castle, Holyrood Palace, the Great Seal and the jewels and Honours of Scotland, retiring for a while to Lochleven Castle, where he busied himself in laying out gardens. On 10 March, James VI issued a proclamation recognising that many in Scotland 'misliked' the regiment of Morton, who had now resigned, and James would now accept the burden of the administration. The King was eleven years old.Calendar of State Papers Scotland, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1907), pp. 275-279. Queen Elizabeth wrote to her agents in Scotland expressing her astonishment and displeasure, because, as she was convinced her influence had brought Morton to the regency, so his forced resignation reflected badly on her. If Morton was now to be accused of bad government, she instructed her diplomats Thomas Randolph and Robert Bowes to defend him by saying that his accusers should have first appealed to England to pressure Morton to reform his administration.Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol. 5 (Edinburgh, 1907), p. 279 no. 320. =President of the Privy Council and arrest= James Douglas, c. 1578, by Arnold Bronckorst, Scottish National Portrait Gallery On 27 April 1578, by the action of John Erskine (son of Regent Mar) and his brothers, the Commendators of Cambuskenneth and Dryburgh, Morton gained possession of Stirling Castle and the person of the king, regaining his ascendancy. On 12 August 1578, the forces of his opponents faced his army at Falkirk, but a truce was negotiated by two Edinburgh ministers, James Lawson and David Lindsay, and the English resident Robert Bowes. A nominal reconciliation was effected, and a parliament at Stirling introduced a new government. Morton, who secured an indemnity, was president of the council, but Atholl remained a privy councillor in an enlarged council with the representatives of both parties. Shortly afterwards Atholl died (allegedly of poison) and suspicion pointed to Morton. His return to power was brief, and the only important event was the prosecution of the two Hamiltons who still supported Mary. In the spring of 1579, the Scottish government's forces moved to crush the power of the Hamilton family in the west, and Claude Hamilton and his brother John Hamilton fled to England. Morton would later deny that this was his initiative.Hewitt, (1982), 64-71. The final fall of Morton came from an opposite quarter. In May 1579, at St Andrews, an eccentric called Skipper Lindsay publicly declared to Morton in the King's presence during the performance of a play that his day of judgement was at hand. In September, Esm√© Stewart, Sieur d'Aubigny, the king's cousin, came to Scotland from France, gained the favour of James by his courtly manners, and received the lands and earldom of Lennox, the custody of Dumbarton Castle, and the office of chamberlain. The young James VI was declared to have reached his majority and formally began his personal rule with some ceremony in Edinburgh in September 1579, and the period of the Regents was concluded. On 31 December 1580, an associate of Lennox, James Stuart, Earl of Arran, son of Lord Ochiltree and brother-in-law of John Knox, had the daring to accuse Morton at a meeting of the council in Holyrood of complicity in the murder of Darnley, and he was at once committed to custody in Holyroodhouse and taken to Dumbarton Castle in the Lennox heartland.Hewitt (1982), pp.76-7, 188-9. Some months later Morton was condemned by an assize for having taken part in Darnley's murder, and the verdict was justified by his confession that the Earl of Bothwell had revealed to him the design, although he denied participation, \\"art and part\\", in its execution. =Execution= The 'Maiden' in the National Museum of Scotland Stone marker in Greyfriars Kirkyard He was executed on 2 June 1581. The method of his execution was the Maiden, an early form of guillotine modelled on the Halifax gibbet. According to tradition, he brought it personally from England, having been \\"impressed by its clean work\\", Maxwell, History of the House of Douglas, Vol. I, pp.283-5 but doubt has been cast on this. It was actually ordered to be made by Edinburgh's Town Council in 1564, Maxwell, H Edinburgh, A Historical Study, Williams and Norgate (1916), p.299 David Hume of Godscroft appears to have initiated the Morton legend in his History of the House of Douglas (1644). His corpse remained on the scaffold for the following day, until it was taken for burial in an unmarked grave at Greyfriars Kirkyard. His head, however, remained on \\"the prick on the highest stone\\",Grant's Old and New Edinburgh, p.124 (a spike) on the north gable of the ancient Tolbooth of Edinburgh (outside St Giles Cathedral), for eighteen months until it was ordered to be reunited with his body in December 1582. Morton's final resting place is reputedlyJames Morton grave monument details at gravestonephotos.com marked by a small sandstone post incised with the initials \\"J.E.M.\\" for James Earl of Morton. The post is more probably a Victorian marker for a lairage. In the very unlikely event that a marker were permitted for an executed criminal, the inscribed initials would have been \\"J.D.\\" and, secondly, it would have been cleared away in 1595 when all stones were removed from Greyfriars. =Widow, daughters, and the Morton title= After the execution of her husband, Morton's wife, Dame Elizabeth Douglas was found by an inquest to be incapable of managing her affairs, as she was \\"idiot and prodigal\\" in the language of the time. King James VI signed a warrant to appoint a legal guardian called an \\"administrator and tutor\\" to supervise and protect her property.Fraser, William, eds., Lennox Muniments, vol.2 (1874), 321-322, (the name of the tutor is left blank in the original) The title of Earl of Morton passed by charter to the son of Dame Elizabeth Douglas's sister Beatrix, John Maxwell, 8th Lord Maxwell. Maxwell had been in dispute with Regent Morton over the title, and while the former Regent was in prison, Maxwell had made a contract with the Duke of Lennox on 29 April 1581. Lennox would work to give Maxwell rights over the Morton earldom, and make him the legal guardian of James Douglas and Dame Elizabeth's three daughters. The three sisters, like their mother would be declared incapable by a \\"brieve of idiotry\\". In 1586, however, the title was given to Archibald Douglas, 8th Earl of Angus, a nephew and legal heir of Regent Morton. Maxwell was still able to use the title, though it did not descend to his heirs.Fraser, William, ed., Carlaverock Book, vol.1 (1873) pp.252-3, 271 The barony of Stobo was confiscated by the Crown but eventually re-granted by charter to Sir John Maitland, Lord Chancellor of Scotland in 1587.RMS.V.1346/1549 Drochil Castle and other buildings Drochil Castle, basement corridor, the Castle is notable for its planning with central corridors on three levels James Douglas started building Drochil Castle in 1578, for his own use three years before his death. It was no more than half built and never finished. The ruins of the castle overlook Peebles and the valleys of the Tarth Water, Lyne Water and River Tweed. At Aberdour Castle in Fife, Morton's lodging survives with its terrace overlooking the Firth of Forth. Morton also extended his residence at Dalkeith Palace, but these works have long since been demolished. Morton commissioned extensive reconstruction at Edinburgh Castle after the siege, including the Portcullis Gate where his heraldic insignia of a heart can still be seen, and the iconic half-moon battery which fronts the castle and conceals the remains of buildings destroyed in 1573. On his orders, galleries, stables, and other new buildings were constructed at Stirling Castle and Holyroodhouse, and rooms refurbished and furnished for the use of the King.Accounts of the Treasurer of Scotland, vol.13, Edinburgh, HMSO (1978), pp.21-2, 26-7, 149, 150-1, 166. During his resignation in March 1578, Morton pointed out to the officers of the Scottish exchequer that the royal houses were \\"now in better case than they were at the beginning of his regiment.\\"Calendar State Papers Scotland, vol.5 (1907), p.277 no.315. Morton in fiction Morton is a character in Liz Lochhead's play Mary Queen of Scots Got Her Head Chopped Off. Nigel Tranter's novel Lord and Master (originally called The Master of Gray, the first part of a trilogy of that name) includes an account of Morton's fall from power and his execution.

All are diurnal and ovoviviparous (live-bearing, without shelled eggs). Most species are rupicolous (rock-dwelling), while a few species are arboreal or live in burrows. They defend themselves with osteoderms (flat bony plates in the skin) and by quickly retreating into rock crevices or burrows. Many species live in groups and males defend territories. Cordylids are generally listed under CITES Appendix II. They are not necessarily threatened with extinction, but trade is controlled to prevent overexploitation. Some species of Cordylus have limited ranges and may be threatened with habitat destruction or over collecting for the pet trade. Classification Broadley (2006) recognized 47 species in the genus Cordylus, including eight species originally placed in the genus Pseudocordylus (P. fasciatus, P. langi, P. melanotus, P. microlepidotus, P. nebulosus, P. spinosus, P. subviridis, and P. transvaalensis) and Hemicordylus capensis. The greatest diversity of cordylids is in South Africa, with a few species found in Angola and eastern Africa as far north as Ethiopia. Other members of the Cordylidae are the genera Chamaesaura (a group of legless lizards from southern and eastern Africa) and Platysaurus. The sister group of Cordylidae is the plated lizards, family Gerrhosauridae. In 2011, a study based on the molecular phylogeny of the family suggested several species traditionally included in Cordylus should be moved to other genera: Hemicordylus (for capensis and nebulosus), Karusasaurus (for jordani and polyzonus), Namazonurus (for campbelli, lawrenci, namaquensis, peersi and pustulatus), Ninurta (for coeruleopunctatus), Ouroborus (for cataphractus) and Smaug (for breyeri, giganteus, mossambicus, regius, vandami and warreni).

The ski/boot/binding combination is used to effectively transmit control inputs from the skier's legs to the snow. History A typical \\"universal\\" ski boot of the leather era. This example, by G. H. Bass, includes an indentation around the heel where the cable binding would fit, and a metal plate at the toe for a Saf-Ski release binding. The leather strap is a \\"long thong\\", used by downhill skiers to offer some level of lateral control. Ski boots were leather winter boots, held to the ski with leather straps. As skiing became more specialized, so too did ski boots, leading to the splitting of designs between those for alpine skiing and cross- country skiing. Modern skiing developed as an all-round sport with uphill, downhill and cross-country portions. The introduction of the cable binding started a parallel evolution of binding and boot. The binding looped a strap around the back of the boot to hold it forward into a metal cup at the toe.Wolfgang Lert, \\"A Binding Revolution\\", Ski Heritage Journal, March 2002, pp. 25-26 Boots with the sole extended rearward to produce a flange for the cable to firmly latch to become common, as did designs with semi-circular indentations on the heel for the same purpose. Effective cross-country skiing requires the boot to flex forward to allow a striding action, so the boots were designed around a sole piece that allowed forward flexing while still keeping the foot relatively firm side-to-side. The upper portions, the cuff, was relatively soft, designed primarily for comfort and warmth. Modern cross- country ski boots remain almost unchanged since 1950s, although modern materials have replaced leather and other natural fibres. With the introduction of ski lifts, the need for skiing to get to the top of the hill was eliminated, and a much stiffer design was preferred, providing better control over the ski when sliding downhill. A key development was the invention in 1928 of the Kandahar cable binding, which attached the heel solidly to the ski and used a strong spring to pull the boot forward into the toe iron. The design required a stiffer, reinforced boot sole, often build on a wooden shank.Seth Masia, \\"A Short, Colorful History of Ski Boots\\", Skiing History magazine, Sept/Oct 2016 New boots that had been boiled in oil or soaked in glue were introduced to stiffen the upper cuff. These were universally uncomfortable, especially during the break-in period when they were new. Once broken-in, they wore out quickly as they continued to soften up. Racers typically had only weeks to wear a particular pair before it was no longer useful.John Fry, \\"The Story of Modern Skiing\\", UPNE, 2006, pp. 81-86 Another attempt to stiffen the leg/ski connection was the \\"long thong\\", a long leather strap fixed directly to the ski that was wrapped several times around the lower leg and then buckled closed. This offered a great improvement in control, but increased the risk of injury in the event of an accident.Greg Morrill, \\"Long thong required a unique technique\\", Stowe Reporter, 17 February 2011 Alpine A pair of modern front-entry alpine ski boots made by Salomon. As with almost all modern examples, four buckles are used to close the openings at the top of the foot and front of the leg to produce stiff cylindrical forms. Above the top buckle on the leg is the \\"power strap\\", which acts as a fifth buckle. The rivets forming the pivot points that allow the upper and lower portions of the boot to move independently are seen in silver. Modern alpine ski boots have rigid soles and attach to the ski at both toe and heel using a spring-loaded binding. The interface between boot and binding is standardized by ISO 5355, which defines the size and shape of the hard plastic flanges on the toe and heel of the boot. Ski boots are sized using the Mondopoint system. =Front-entry= Front-entry (or \\"top-entry\\", rarely \\"overlap\\" or \\"Lange\\") boots have been the primary boot design for most of the history of downhill skiing. The design evolved from existing leather boot through several steps. In 1956, the Swiss factory Henke introduced the buckle boot, using over-center levered latches patented by Hans Martin to replace laces. Laces spread the load across a number of eyelets in the leather, whereas the buckles concentrated the load at only a few points. To spread it back out again, the boots featured C-shaped flaps that stretched over the opening where the laces would be, to the side where the buckles were located. These had the added advantage of also helping block snow from entering the front of the boot. Beginning around 1960 Bob Lange experimented with ways to replace leather with plastic. Early examples used a lace-up design, but in 1964 he combined a new, more flexible polyurethane plastic with the overlapping flap and buckle system from Henke to produce the first recognizably modern ski boot. Production examples appeared in 1966, and when Nancy Greene started winning races on them, the plastic boot became a must- have item. Replacing leather with plastic dramatically improved stiffness and control, along with durability and warmth (leather boots had a way of soaking through, which led to wet, frozen feet). Over time the cuff around the leg evolved upward, starting just over the ankle like leather boots, but rising to a point about half way to the knee by the 1980s. Only minor changes have occurred to this basic design since then. Almost all modern front-entry boots consist of two sections, one around the foot, and another around the lower leg. These are joined by rivets/rotating joints near the ankle that allows the leg to pivot forward, but not to the sides. This allows excellent control by transmitting even the smallest lateral movements of the leg to the ski. However, the rigid cuff also makes them very difficult to put on and take off. Additionally, because the boot clamps across the foot, pulling the sides inward, it is difficult to produce a single design that fits a range of foot shapes and sizes. This leads to shell modification services, when the boot is stretched to fit the skier's foot, typically by heating the plastic and pressing it into place. This is also known as \\"blowing\\" (\\"punching\\", \\"pushing\\"). Sometimes material will be ground off the boot to provide more room. This is normally used only with front-entry designs, other designs normally include much more room in the foot area as they do not clamp down the same way. Salomon's SX 92 Equipe was the penultimate development of their SX series of rear-entry ski boots. The boot on the left is in the \\"open\\" position. =Rear-entry= Rear-entry boots were brought to market in the early 1970s by the Hanson brothers to address the issue of getting conventional boots on and off, while also providing a generally better fit.Seth Masia, \\"The Rear-Entry Boot: A Life Cut Short\\", Skiing Heritage Journal, June 2007, pp. 40-42 Rear-entry designs were very popular in the 1980s, notably Salomon designs like the racing-oriented SX 91 Equipe. In the rear-entry design, the entire foot area and sole are a single unit similar to a slipper. The leg cuff is split in two, with front and rear sections that meet at the hinge point at the ankle. The rear half of the cuff can pivot far to the rear, opening wide for easy entry. Closing a cable locks the moving rear portion forward onto the front half, forming the stiff cuff that pivots around rivets at the ankle like a conventional front-entry design. As the toe area is a single piece and lacks buckles for adjustment, rear-entry boots may have considerable \\"slop\\", and various systems of cables, plates or foam-filled bladders were used to address this. The upside of this approach is that the foot area can be made larger, fitting almost any foot. The rear entry design fell from popularity in the 1990s due to their shunning by racers in search of a closer fit. Recent improvements to front-entry and mid-entry boots, primarily in the areas of comfort and ease of entry/exit, have diminished the popularity of rear-entry designs even in recreational roles, though mid-range models remain common as rental boots. =Three-piece= Three-piece (or \\"open- throat\\") boots were first developed by Mel Dalebout (around 1969), who introduced a rigid magnesium boot shell in that year (Brixia did the same thing with their aluminum shell at around the same time). The big advantage was that the main shell was a single piece that was convex at all points, meaning it could be easily produced using a plug mould. Conventional boots with overlapping flaps required more complex moulding processes. Engineers at Henke, Heierling, Sanmarco and Caber saw the advantage for high-speed moulding, and plastic three-piece boots were on the market by 1972, when Roland Collombin won the Olympic downhill in the Henke Strato. Boot designer Sven Coomer later improved the design with a corrugated tongue, and this technique was commercialized by Comfort Products, an Aspen, Colo. company owned by the ex-ski racer Erik Giese. Giese licensed Coomer's concept to the Swiss company Raichle-Molitor; the company introduced it in 1979 as the Flexon, which became very popular among downhill racers and mogul skiers. The Flexon was extremely popular among professional skiers, especially for moguls and freestyle, but a series of business blunders put Raichle out of business in the late 1990s.Seth Morrison, \\"Morrison Hotel: Boots Made for Stalking\\", ESPN, 3 November 2009 Several companies produce three-piece designs today, often referred to as \\"cabrio\\" boots (after convertible-top cabriolet vehiclesCabriolet (carriage)), and they are once again becoming popular models. The design closely resembles a conventional front-entry design, with separate foot and leg sections riveted at the ankle. However, the overlapping flaps of these designs are cut away, leaving a slot-like opening running down the front of the leg and over the foot. A separate plastic tongue is positioned over this opening on the front of the boot, and buckled down to close it. The open cuff (the \\"throat\\") makes the boots easy to get on and off, and the shaping of the tongue allows complete control over the forward flex. A single shell can be used with different tongues to provide any needed flex pattern from racing-stiff to freestyle-soft. =Hybrid leather= The introduction of plastic boots in the 1960s led a number of companies to introduce \\"hybrid\\" boots with plastic inserts for additional lateral strength. These were widespread in the late 1960s, especially from the large collection of Italian bookmakers in Montebelluna, before they started introducing all- plastic designs of their own. Typical designs used a plastic insert wrapping around the heel area and extending up to just below the ankle, allowing the skier to force their foot sideways and offering some edging control. Others, notably 1968's Raichle Fibre Jet, wrapped a soft leather boot in an external fibreglass shell, producing a side-entry design that was not particularly successful.Greg Morrill, \\"Raichle Fiber Jets\\", 20 January 2011 Hybrid designs often incorporated elements of the side-entry or three-piece designs. The Fibre Jet shared much in common with the Rosemount design, for instance. Rosemount's side-entry design, circa 1968. The metal framework that provides forward flex is not visible in these images. The \\"crushed\\" section at the top of the boot is an elastic material that prevents snow from entering the cuff. =Side-entry= Introduced by Rosemount in 1965, side-entry design consisted of an almost completely enclosed shell with a cut-out section on one side. The cut-out was covered by a flap that hinged along the back of the boot, swinging to the rear to open. Stepping in was very easy, simply sliding the foot sideways in through the opening, then swinging the flap closed and stretching a fabric cover over it to seal it. As the upper and lower sections both opened, metal plates were needed on the sides to connect the two mechanically. A problem was that the boot did not meet perfectly along the join, allowing snow to force its way into the boot, although improvements were continuous. This design fell from use in the 1970s as higher-cuff front-entry boots became largely universal.Paul Stewart, \\"A Revolutionary New Ski Boot Has a Streamlined Shell of Rigid Fiber Glass\\", Sports Illustrated, 15 November 1965 =External frames= The ski boot provides four functions; protecting the foot from the elements, providing a mounting point for the binding, and transmitting forces between the leg and the ski. In theory, there's no reason these have to be combined in a single unit, and several designs have split these functions up. One example is the Nava System from the 1980s, which used a soft boot that clipped into custom bindings, and an arm that extended up from the rear binding to wrap around the leg and provide lateral control.Clint Swett, \\"Have Your Ski Boots Got You Sore? A Comforting Change Is Now Afoot\\", Sports Illustrated, 17 November 1986 =Knee-highs= In 1980 four designs were introduced that all rose to a point just under the knee. They were normal ski boots below, but used an extended tongue that fastened around the upper leg using a variety of methods. They offered much greater edging control, and were quickly copied by many other companies. They all disappeared by 1983, a victim largely of fashion - ski pants wouldn't fit over them. None are produced today.Seth Masia, \\"The Rise and Fall of the Knee-High Boot\\", Skiing Heritage Journal, June 2003 Nordic A typical modern cross-country boot, using the original SNS style binding. Compared to downhill, cross-country boots are much simpler and more closely related to their leather ancestors. =Cross-country and telemark= Cross-country boots, like all Nordic equipment, attach to the ski usually only at the toe of the boot and are allowed to flex at the ball of the foot similarly to a normal shoe or boot. Cross-country boots generally use one of four attachment systems; NNN (New Nordic Norm), 75mm Nordic Norm (\\"three-pin\\" binding, \\"75NN\\"), d-ring, or SNS (Salomon Nordic System). A four-pin binding system similar to 75NN used to be popular in the USSR. A new Salomon Pilot binding is now widely used for racing because it uses two connection points so that the skier has more stability and control over the ski. As these boots are intended for travel over generally flat terrain, they are optimized for light weight and efficiency of motion.Barbara Brewster, \\"Gear Up Properly for Cross-Country\\", Snow Country, January 1989, pp. 72-75 Telemark refers to a specific technique for making downhill turns on Nordic equipment. This has resulted in highly specialized equipment designed for better performance in a downhill setting. Until 1992 Telemark boots were basically heavy leather boots with the front of the sole adapted to the 75mm Nordic Norm. The introduction of the New Telemark Norm (NTN) binding in 2007 change the technique dramatically.\\"NTN On-snow Test Report\\", Telemark News, 26 January 2007 Since then plastic boots have become more and more common and now make up almost all Telemark boots. Plastic allows for a laterally stiffer boot while still allowing freedom of flex at the ball of the foot through the use of bellows. Boots intended for more cross country travel generally have a lower cuff, softer flex and lighter weight. Boots specialized for downhill use have higher cuffs, stiffer flex and heavier weight. Telemark boots are almost always equipped with a rubber sole. =Alpine touring= Modern alpine touring boots from different brands. Often the inner boot can be worn separately, as shown with the red exemplar. Also common is a lever as seen on the back of both boots to switch from a rigid \\"ski\\" position to a flexible \\"walk\\" adjustment. Although randonn√©e is considered as an alpine sport, it basically combines the cross-country stride for uphill portions and then conventional alpine techniques on the downhill. The equipment uses most closely compares to modern telemark systems, with a stiff plastic boot offering good downhill control, and a binding system that allows it to pivot at the toe for cross-country striding.Ronald Eng, \\"Mountaineering: Freedom of the Hills\\", The Mountaineers Books, 2010, p. 329 Different models trade off light weight against downhill performance. They have a rockered, rubber sole to allow for easier walking. This means that they will not fit in ordinary alpine bindings. Instead, the interface between alpine touring boots and bindings is defined by ISO 9523. Other attachment methods exist and prominent amongst these are the Tech bindings and fittings that were first commercialized by Dynafit as the TLT. As yet, these are not covered by an international standard. Snowboarding snowboard gear consists of an L-shaped plastic frame for the bindings, and semi-stiff boots on the feet. Ratcheting buckles hold the boots in the frame. These are generally far more comfortable than typical alpine boots. Downhill techniques, alpine, telemark and snowboarding, all perform turns by rotating the ski or board onto its edge. Once on edge, the curved pattern cut into the side (the \\"sidecut\\") causes the ski or board to bend into a curve. As they move forward over the snow, this curved shape causes them to turn. Snowboard boots and bindings are normally far simpler than their downhill counterparts, rarely including release systems for instance, and need to provide mechanical support only in the fore and aft directions. These typically consist of an external frame, generally L shaped, which the snowboarder steps into and then fastens down using straps over the boot. The boot itself is not as responsible for transmitting forces, and can be much softer than a typical downhill boot. When the sport was first introduced, normal winter boots were used, but today it is much more common to use semi-stiff snowboarding boots. Some specialty disciplines use harder boots with step-in bindings more similar to downhill systems, but these are not widely used outside these fields, even though some downhill sports teachers use these so they can switch between snowboarding or skiing classes without having to change boots.

Released for the Dreamcast in 1999, it was the first game for the system to support online console gaming. Players must place arrows on a board to lead mice into escape rockets while avoiding cats. The game features single-player modes in which a player must save all the mice on a board, and a multiplayer mode in which players battle to collect the most mice. Directed and produced by Yuji Naka, ChuChu Rocket! was developed in part to test the online functionality of the Dreamcast and Sega's servers, and test the Dreamcast's processing power by displaying many characters at once. The knowledge gained from the network portion of the project helped Sonic Team in their development of Phantasy Star Online (2000). ChuChu Rocket! topped the Japanese sales charts its first week on sale in November 1999. When it arrived in the United States, Sega held an online tournament where players could battle against Sega and Sonic Team employees. In PAL regions, it was given free to subscribers of Sega's online gaming service Dreamarena. ChuChu Rocket! was a commercial and critical success. Critics praised the chaotic and addictive multiplayer and the simple and cute Japanese aesthetic. Sega's network gaming service received some criticism for lag. ChuChu Rocket! was ported to the Game Boy Advance as a launch title, where it gathered interest as the first game published by Sega for Nintendo hardware. It was ported to iOS in 2010 and Android in 2011, but these versions were removed from sale in 2015. The Dreamcast version can still by played online via private servers. Gameplay Competitive four-player gameplay. Players place arrows to direct mice towards their rocket, and cats towards their opponents'. ChuChu Rocket! is an action puzzle game. The basic rules of the game require the player to guide mice, dubbed \\"ChuChus\\", into a rocket while evading them from dangerous cats, dubbed \\"KapuKapus\\". A brief premise is provided in the instruction manual, explaining that ChuChus are living on a space port that is invaded by KapuKapus one day. In their frantic state, the ChuChus begin running around in chaos, and so the player must guide them to their rockets to save them. Both ChuChus and KapuKapus run in a straight line, and turn right when they hit walls. A player can place up, down, left, and right arrows on the field of play, redirecting characters that step on them. Up to three arrows can be placed by a player at any time; placing a fourth arrow will make the player's oldest arrow vanish, and all arrows fade away over time. If a KapuKapu hits an arrow twice, the arrow disappears. There are several modes of play within ChuChu Rocket! including a single-player puzzle mode, a puzzle editing mode, a cooperative challenge mode, and competitive multiplayer modes. In the puzzle mode, the player is provided a limited set of arrows to place on the field to save all the ChuChus in play. The puzzle editing mode allows players to create their own puzzles like this. In the challenge mode, players are given 30 seconds to save the ChuChus in play without any arrow limitations as in puzzle mode. In the competition modes, each player has a rocket and must guide as many ChuChus as possible into their rocket in the time limit. This mode supports up to four players, either in free-for-all or team-based fashion. ChuChu Rocket! is notable for being the first Dreamcast online multiplayer game. During the time Sega was operating its servers, players were able to play the competitive modes online, while also being able to upload their custom puzzles and download those made by other users. Players could use an onscreen or physical keyboard to chat with other players. Servers for the game's online functionality were brought back online by fans in 2016. Development ChuChu Rocket! was developed by Sonic Team. Director and producer Yuji Naka conceived the game as a way to use the power of the Dreamcast to create 100 sprites moving at once. He believed there are two trends to use evolving hardware: one is to make increasingly beautiful graphics, while the other is to squeeze as much processing power to use it to its fullest; he chose the latter in this case. Naka and his team found difficulty working on the networking component, but believed it was a good learning experience. Part of ChuChu Rocket!s purpose was to test the capabilities of online multiplayer gaming on the Dreamcast; the team used what they learned to help drive the development of Phantasy Star Online (2000). A NAOMI arcade version of the game was also planned, but later scrapped. Promotion and release Sega announced ChuChu Rocket! on September 2, 1999 as Sonic Team's second game for the Dreamcast after Sonic Adventure (1998). Prior to the game's release in Japan in November 1999, Sega promoted the game with a website dedicated to ChuChu Rocket!, and a 15-second commercial advertising the game was solicited to television stations across the country, with the commercial also made available to download through the website. ChuChu Rocket! released in Japan on November 11, 1999 and climbed to the top of the Japanese sales charts in its first week on sale, selling 35,000 copies and knocking the PlayStation release of Chrono Trigger off the top spot. That December, video game magazine Famitsu held a contest using a ChuChu-themed minigame for the Dreamcast Visual Memory Unit (VMU) that could be downloaded from the internet. Players who successfully beat the minigame were given a password which could be sent back to Famitsu. Various prizes were given out to winners of the contest, including Dreamcast controllers, VMU stickers, and pens. In January 2000, Sega of America announced they would be bringing ChuChu Rocket! to North America on March 2, 2000, three months earlier than the original anticipated release in June. Prior to the North American release of the game, a Shockwave demo featuring 30 levels from the game's puzzle mode was made available to play on personal computers through Sega's website. ChuChu Rocket! was released in North America on March 7, 2000, a week later than had been announced earlier. It retailed for $29.99, lower than an average for a new Dreamcast game. Sega held an online tournament on March 25, 2000 where players could battle with members of Sonic Team, the Dreamcast network team, and other Sega employees in online matches. The European and PAL versions of the game were not released until months after the North American release; on June 9, 2000. The game was gifted for free to subscribers of Dreamarena, the online gaming service for the Dreamcast in Europe, which at the time of ChuChu Rocket!s launch in Europe, had over 25,000 subscribers, despite the absence of online play beforehand. =Ports= A port of ChuChu Rocket! was released as a launch game for the Game Boy Advance in Japan on March 21, 2001. The release garnered interest as the first game Sega published for a Nintendo system. This version retains all the gameplay modes of the Dreamcast version except online play. Players can use Game Link Cables to connect up to four systems together to play using only one cartridge. Sonic Team also selected 2,500 of the 17,000 custom puzzles uploaded to the Dreamcast servers to include in the game. The polygonal graphics from the Dreamcast version are replaced with animated sprites. Players can also edit their own character sprites. This version of ChuChu Rocket! was re-released on the Wii U in Japan in 2015. Sega released iOS and Android ports of ChuChu Rocket! in 2010 and 2011, respectively. The iOS version featured local multiplayer over Wi-Fi, this feature was not in the Android version. Both were pulled from the online marketplace in 2015. Reception The Dreamcast version of ChuChu Rocket! received positive reviews. Critics highlighted the multiplayer modes as being great fun and addictive. Stuart Taylor of Dreamcast Magazine (UK) called the multiplayer the \\"bread and butter\\" of ChuChu Rocket!, and praised it for being easy to pick up and put down. He concluded the game was \\"shamelessly retro and monstrously addictive.\\" Other critics also picked up on the game's Japanese and retro aesthetics, citing the simple, cute, and kawaii graphics. Some reviewers drew attention to the game's \\"chaos\\" and \\"insanity\\", such as Nick Jones writing for Arcade, who said the game was \\"complete madness and rates as an example of Japanese gaming eccentricity at its very finest\\". In addition critics also praised the game for its low retail price, giving a great fresh experience to gamers on a budget. The most common complaints were in regards to the game's network component. Some critics noted problems with lag in their games, as well as difficulty getting logged in. Concluding their thoughts, IGN staff called it \\"quite simply the best multiplayer effort [they]'ve played in years, on any console.\\" Chris Simpson of AllGame said: \\"ChuChu Rocket! is the most rapidly paced game I have ever had the pleasure of playing...The multiplayer will become a benchmark of quality.\\" The Game Boy Advance port of ChuChu Rocket! also received generally favorable reviews. The game is almost identical to the Dreamcast version, and thus reviewers generally shared the same thoughts as those on the Dreamcast version. Some complaints were made about the D-pad controls being inferior to the Dreamcast's analog stick. However, praise was given for the ability to hook up four Game Boy Advances and play multiplayer using only one cartridge, and also for the inclusion of 2,500 user-created stages uploaded to the Dreamcast servers. Legacy Minigames based on ChuChu Rocket! were included in Sega Superstars (2004) and Sega Superstars Tennis (2008). ChuChus are also playable characters in Sonic & Sega All-Stars Racing (2010). A proper sequel titled ChuChu Rocket! Universe was announced in September 2019 as part of the initial wave of games for Apple Arcade.

It is usually made of metal, often silver or gold or some other material. Brooches are frequently decorated with enamel or with gemstones and may be solely for ornament or serve a practical function as a clothes fastener. The earliest known brooches are from the Bronze Age. As fashions in brooches changed rather quickly, they are important chronological indicators. Many of the ancient European brooches found in archaeology are usually referred to by the Latin term fibula. Ancient brooches Brooches were known as fibula (plural fibulae) prior to the Middle Ages. These decorative items, used as clothes fasteners, were first crafted in the Bronze Age. In Europe, during the Iron Age, metalworking technology had advanced dramatically. The newer techniques of casting, metal bar-twisting and wire making were the basis for many new objects, including the fibula. In Europe, Celtic craftsmen were creating fibulae decorated in red enamel and coral inlay, as early as 400 BC. The earliest manufacture of brooches in Great Britain was during the period from 600 to 150 BC. The most common brooch forms during this period were the bow, the plate and in smaller quantities, the penannular brooch. Iron Age brooches found in Britain are typically cast in one piece, with the majority made in copper alloy or iron. Prior to the late Iron Age, gold and silver were rarely used to make jewellery.

During the 5th and 6th centuries, five Germanic tribes migrated to and occupied four different areas of Europe and England after the collapse of the Roman Empire. The tribes were the Visigoths who settled in Spain, the Ostrogoths in Eastern Germany and Austria, the Franks in West Germany, the Lombards in Northern Italy and the Anglo-Saxons in England. Because the tribes were closely linked by their origins, and their jewellery techniques were strikingly similar, the work of these people was first referred to as Barbarian art. This art style is now called Migration period art. Brooches dating from this period were developed from a combination of Late Roman and new Germanic art forms, designs and technology. Metalworkers throughout western Europe created some of the most colorful, lively and technically superior jewellery ever seen. The brooches of this era display techniques from Roman art: repouss√©, filigree, granulation, enamelling, openwork and inlay, but it is inlay that the Migration period artists are famous for. Their passion for colour makes their jewellery stand out. Colour is the primary feature of Migration period jewellery. The precious stone most often used in brooches was the almandine, a burgundy variety of garnet, found in Europe and India. According to J. Anderson Black, \\"designers would cover the entire surface of an object with the tiny geometric shapes of precious stones or enamel which were then polished flat until they were flush with the cloisonn√© settings, giving the appearance of a tiny stained glass window.\\" Brooch designs were many and varied: geometric decoration, intricate patterns, abstract designs from nature, bird motifs and running scrolls. Zoomorphic ornamentation was a common element during this period, in Anglo-Saxon England as well as in Europe. Intertwined beasts were a signature feature of these lively, intricately decorated brooches. Bow shaped, S-shaped, radiate-headed and decorated disc brooches were the most common brooch styles during the Migration period, which spanned the 5th through the 7th centuries.

The long brooch style was most commonly found in 5th- and 6th-century England. Circular brooches first appeared in England in the middle of the 5th century. During the 6th century, craftsmen from Kent began manufacturing brooches using their own distinctive styles and techniques. The circular form was the preferred brooch type by the end of the 6th century. During the 7th century, all brooches in England were in decline. They reappeared in the 8th century and continued to be fashionable through the end of the Anglo-Saxon era. Brooch styles were predominantly circular by the middle to late Anglo-Saxon era. During this time period, the preferred styles were the annular and jewelled (Kentish) disc brooch styles. The circular forms can be divided generally into enamelled and non-enamelled styles. A few non-circular style were fashionable during the 8th to 11th centuries. The ansate, the safety-pin, the strip and a few other styles can be included in this group. Ansate brooches were traditional brooches from Europe migrated to England and became fashionable in the late Anglo-Saxon period. Safety- pin brooches, more abundant in the early Anglo-Saxon period became more uncommon by the 7th century and by the 8th century, evolve into the strip brooch. Miscellaneous brooches during this time period include the bird, the ottonian, the rectangle and the cross motif.

Techniques, styles and materials used by the Celts were different from Anglo-Saxon craftsmen. Certain attributes of Celtic jewellery, such as inlaid millefiori glass and curvilinear styles have more in common with ancient brooches than contemporary Anglo-Saxon jewellery. The jewellery of Celtic artisans is renowned for its inventiveness, complexity of design and craftsmanship. The Tara Brooch is a well-known example of a Celtic brooch.

The lively decorative style originated in Denmark in the late fifth century as an insular response to Late Roman style metalwork. During the early medieval period, Scandinavian craftsmen created intricately carved brooches with their signature animal style ornamentation. The brooches were generally made of copper alloy or silver. Beginning in the eighth century and lasting until the eleventh century, Scandinavian seafarers were exploring, raiding and colonizing Europe, Great Britain and new lands to the west. This era of Scandinavian expansion is known as the Viking Age, and the art created during this time period is known as Viking art. Metalwork, including brooches, produced during this period were decorated in one or more of the Viking art styles. These five sequential styles are: Oseberg, Borre, Jellinge, Mammen, Ringerike and Urnes. A variety of Scandinavian brooch forms were common during this period: circular, bird-shaped, oval, equal-armed, trefoil, lozenge-shaped, and domed disc. The most common Scandinavian art styles of the period are the Jellinge and Borre art styles. Some of the characteristics of these related art styles are: interlaced gripping beasts, single animal motifs, ribbon-shaped animals, knot and ring-chain patterns, tendrils, and leaf, beast and bird motifs.

Brooch shapes were generally: star-shaped, pentagonal, lobed, wheel, heart-shaped, and ring. Rings were smaller than other brooches, and often used to fasten clothing at the neck. Brooch decoration usually consisted of a simple inscription or gems applied to a gold or silver base. Inscriptions of love, friendship and faith were a typical feature of ring brooches of this period. The heart shaped brooch was a very popular gift between lovers or friends. Amulet brooches were very common prior to medieval times. In late antiquity, they were embellished with symbols of pagan deities or gems that held special powers to protect the wearer from harm. These pagan inspired brooches continued to be worn after the spread of Christianity. Pagan and Christian symbols were often combined to decorate brooches during the Middle Ages. Beginning in the fourteenth century, three-dimensional brooches appeared for the first time. The Dunstable Swan Brooch is a well-known example of a three-dimensional brooch.

Global exploration and colonization brought new prosperity to Europe and Great Britain along with new sources of diamonds, gems, pearls, and precious metals. The rapid changes in clothing fashion during this era generated similar changes in jewellery styles. The demand for new jewellery resulted in the deconstruction and melting down of many old jewellery pieces to create new jewellery. Because of this, there are very few surviving jewellery pieces from this era. The primary jewellery styles during this time period are: Renaissance, Georgian and Neoclassical. =Renaissance= The Renaissance period in jewellery (1300‚Äì1600) was a time of wealth and opulence. Elaborate brooches covered in gemstones or pearls were in fashion, especially with the upper classes. Gemstones commonly used for brooches were emeralds, diamonds, rubies, amethyst and topaz. Brooches with religious motifs and enamelled miniature portraits were popular during this time period. Gems were often selected for their protective properties as well as their as their vibrant colours. During the fifteenth century, new cutting techniques inspired new gemstone shapes. The abundance of jewellery is well documented in paintings during the time period.

In the early 1700s, ornate brooches with complex designs were fashionable. By the mid to late 1700s, simpler forms and designs were more common, with simpler themes of nature, bows, miniature portraits and animals. Georgian jewelry was typically handmade in gold or silver. Diamonds and pearls continued to be fashionable during this period.

The main difference between Renaissance jewellery and neoclassical jewellery was that Renaissance jewellery was created primarily for the upper class and neoclassical jewellery was made for the general public. An important innovation in jewellery making during this era was the technique of producing cameos with hard pastes called black basalt and jasper. English pottery manufacturer, Josiah Wedgewood, is responsible for this important contribution to jewellery making. Cameos and brooches with classical scenes were fashionable during this period. Pearls and gemstones continued to be used in brooches, but were less popular than before. The beginning of the French Revolution halted the manufacture and demand for opulent jewellery. Italian - Neoclassical Brooch - Walters 41270.jpgItalian Neoclassical Brooch Wedgwood_-_Apollo_with_a_Zodiac_Border_- _Walters_481971.jpgWedgewood medallion Late modern brooches The late modern age of jewellery covers the period from 1830 to 1945. The major jewellery styles of this period are: Victorian (1835‚Äì1900), Art Nouveau (1895‚Äì1914), Edwardian (1901‚Äì1910) and Art deco (1920‚Äì1939). =Victorian= This period was named for Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom who reigned from 1837 to 1901. Cameos, locket brooches, flowers, nature, animal and hearts were popular jewellery styles in the early Victorian era. When Queen Victoria's husband, Prince Albert died in 1861, jewellery fashion changed to reflect the Queen in mourning. Styles turned heavier and more somber, using materials like black enamel, jet, and black onyx. Mourning brooches were commonly worn until the end of the Victorian period. It was fashionable during this time period to incorporate hair and portraiture into a brooch. The practice began as an expression of mourning, then expanded to keepsakes of loved ones who were living. Human hair was encased within the brooch or braided and woven into a band to which clasps were affixed.

The style began in France as a reaction to the heavy, somber jewellery of the Victorian era . Innovative, flowing designs were now in fashion along with nature, flowers, insects and sensuous women with flowing hair. The jewellery style was fashionable for fifteen years, and ended with the beginning of World War I.

This period marked the first time platinum was used in jewellery. Because of platinum's strength, new jewellery pieces were created with delicate filigree to look like lace and silk. The main gemstones used in brooches were diamonds, typically with platinum or white gold, and coloured gemstones or pearls. Platinum and diamond brooches were a common brooch style. Small brooches continued to be fashionable. Popular brooch forms were bows, ribbons, swags, and garlands, all in the delicate new style.

Cubism and Fauvism, early 20th century art movements, were inspirations for this new art style, along with Eastern, African and Latin American art. Art Deco was named after the Exposition International des Arts D√©coratifs et Industriels Modernes, a decorative and industrial arts exhibition held in Paris in 1925. Common brooch decoration of this period are: geometric shapes, abstract designs, designs from Cubism, Fauvism, and art motifs from Egypt and India. Black onyx, coral, quartz, lapis and carnelian were used with classic stones such as diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and sapphires.

The water and fat are replaced by certain plastics, yielding specimens that can be touched, do not smell or decay, and even retain most properties of the original sample. Process The centerpiece of plastination: \\"forced impregnation\\" Hardening and posing of plastinates Four steps are used in the standard process of plastination: fixation, dehydration, forced impregnation in a vacuum, and hardening. Water and lipid tissues are replaced by curable polymers, which include silicone, epoxy, and polyester-copolymer. The first step of plastination, fixation, frequently uses a formaldehyde-based solution, and serves two functions. Dissecting the specimen to show specific anatomical elements can be time-consuming. Formaldehyde or other preserving solutions help prevent decomposition of the tissues. They may also confer a degree of rigidity. This can be beneficial in maintaining the shape or arrangement of a specimen. A stomach might be inflated or a leg bent at the knee, for example. After any necessary dissections have taken place, the specimen is placed in a bath of acetone (freezing point ‚àí95 ¬∞C [-139 ¬∞F]) at ‚àí20¬∞ to ‚àí30 ¬∞C (‚àí4 to ‚àí22 ¬∞F). The volume of the bath should be 10 times that of the specimen. The acetone is renewed two times over the course of six weeks. The acetone draws out all the water and replaces it inside the cells. In the third step, the specimen is then placed in a bath of liquid polymer, such as silicone rubber, polyester, or epoxy resin. By creating a vacuum, the acetone is made to boil at a low temperature. As the acetone vaporizes and leaves the cells, it draws the liquid polymer in behind it, leaving a cell filled with liquid plastic. The plastic must then be cured with gas, heat, or ultraviolet light, to harden it. A specimen can vary from a full human body to a small piece of an animal organ, and they are known as 'plastinates'. Once plastinated, the specimens and bodies are further manipulated and positioned prior to curing (hardening) of the polymer chains. History German anatomist Gunther von Hagens, the inventor of plastination In November 1979, Gunther von Hagens applied for a German patent, proposing the idea of preserving animal and vegetable tissues permanently by synthetic resin impregnation. Since then, von Hagens has applied for further US patents regarding work on preserving biological tissues with polymers. With the success of his patents, von Hagens went on to form the Institute for Plastination in Heidelberg, Germany in 1993. The Institute for Plastination, along with von Hagens, made their first showing of plastinated bodies in Japan in 1995, which drew more than three million visitors. The institute maintains three international centres of plastination, in Germany, Kyrgyzstan, and China. Related preservation methods Other methods have been in place for thousands of years to halt the decomposition of the body. Mummification used by the ancient Egyptians is a widely known method which involves the removal of body fluid and wrapping the body in linens. Prior to mummification, Egyptians would lay the body in a shallow pit in the desert and allow the sun to dehydrate the body. Formalin, an important solution to body preservation, was introduced in 1896 to help with body preservation. Soon to follow formalin, color-preserving embalming solutions were developed to preserve lifelike color and flexibility to aid in the study of the body. Paraffin impregnation was introduced in 1925, and the embedding of organs in plastic was developed in the 1960s. Body preservation methods current to the 21st century are cryopreservation, which involves the cooling of the body to very low temperatures to preserve the body tissues, plastination, and embalming. Other methods used in modern times include the Silicone S 10 Standard Procedure, the Cor-Tech Room temperature procedure, the Epoxy E 12 procedure, and the Polyester P 35 (P 40) procedure. The Silicone S 10 is the procedure most often used in plastination and creates opaque, natural-looking specimen. Dow Corning Corporation's Cor-Tech Room Temperature Procedure is designed to allow plastination of specimen at room temperature to various degrees of flexibility using three combinations of polymer, crosslinker, and catalyst. According to the International Society for Plastination, the Epoxy E 12 procedure is used \\"for thin, transparent, and firm body and organ slices\\", while the Polyster P 35 (P 40) preserves \\"semitransparent and firm brain slices\\". Samples are prepared for fixation through the first method by deep freezing, while the second method works best following 4‚Äì6 weeks of preparation in a formaldehyde mixture. Uses of plastinated specimens Plastination is useful in anatomy, serving as models and teaching tools. It is used at more than 40 medical and dental schools throughout the world as an adjunct to anatomical dissection. Histological section of bovine tongue, epoxy technique Students enrolled in introductory animal science courses at many universities learn animal science through collections of multispecies large- animal specimens. Plastination allows students to have hands-on experience in this field, without exposure to chemicals such as formalin. For example, plastinated canine gastrointestinal tracts are used to help in the teaching of endoscopic technique and anatomy. The plastinated specimens retain their dilated conformation by a positive pressure air flow during the curing process, which allows them to be used to teach both endoscopic technique and gastrointestinal anatomy. With the use of plastination as a teaching method of animal science, fewer animals have to be killed for research, as the plastination process allows specimens to be studied for a long time. TTT sheet plastinates for school teaching and lay instruction provide a thorough impression of the complexity of an animal body in just one specimen. TTT sheet plastinate of a fish North Carolina State University's College of Veterinary Medicine in Raleigh, North Carolina, uses both plastic coating (PC) and plastination (PN) to investigate and compare the difference in the two methods. The PC method was simple and inexpensive, but the PN specimens were more flexible, durable, and lifelike than those preserved by the PC method. The use of plastination allowed the use of many body parts such as muscle, nerves, bones, ligaments, and central nervous system to be preserved. The University of Texas Health Science Center at San Antonio was the first school in the United States to use this technique to prepare gross organ specimens for use in teaching. The New York University College of Dentistry, Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine, University of Warwick, and University of Northumbria use collections of plastinates as teaching aids. The University of Vienna and the University of Sheffield have their own plastination laboratories. Ethical concerns Concern over consent of bodies being used in the plastination process has arisen. Over 20 years ago, von Hagens set up a body donation program in Germany and has signed over 9,000 donors into the plastinate program: 531 have already died. The program has reported an average of one body a day being released to the plastination process. About 90% of the donors registered are German. Von Hagens' body donations are now being managed by the Institute for Plastination (IfP) established in 1993. =Religious opposition= A number of religious sects prohibit organ donation. Ultra-Orthodox Jews oppose post mortem organ donation, and have tried to pass laws against unclaimed cadavers being used in research. A number of religious organizations, including Catholic and Jewish ones, object to the display of plastinated body parts at public exhibitions. Plastination exhibitions For the first 20 years, plastination was used to preserve small specimens for medical study. In the early 1990s, the equipment was developed to make plastinating whole body specimens possible, each specimen taking up to 1,500-man-hours to prepare. The first exhibition of whole bodies was displayed by von Hagens in Japan in 1995. Over the next two years, Von Hagens developed the K√∂rperwelten (Body Worlds) public exhibitions, showing whole bodies plastinated in lifelike poses and dissected to show various structures and systems of human anatomy. The earliest exhibitions were presented in the Far East and in Germany, and Gunther von Hagens' exhibitions have subsequently been hosted by museums and venues in more than 50 cities worldwide, attracting more than 29 million visitors.. Gunther von Hagens' Body Worlds exhibitions are the original, precedent-setting public anatomical exhibitions of real human bodies, and the only anatomical exhibits that use donated bodies, willed by donors to the Institute for Plastination for the express purpose of serving the Body Worlds mission to educate the public about health and anatomy. To date, more than 10,000 people have agreed to donate their bodies to Institute for Plastination. In 2004, Premier Exhibitions began their \\"Bodies Revealed\\" exhibition in Blackpool, England, which ran from August through October 2004. In 2005 and 2006, the company opened their \\"Bodies Revealed\\" and \\"Bodies...The Exhibition\\" in Seoul, Tampa, and New York City. The West Coast exhibition site opened on 22 June 2006 at the Tropicana Resort and Casino Las Vegas. , BODIES... The Exhibition is showing at the Ambassador Theatre (Dublin) in Dublin, Ireland... The exhibition was in Istanbul, Turkey, until the end of March 2011. Plastination galleries are offered in several college medical schools, including the University of Michigan (said to possess the nation's largest such lab), Vienna University, and the JSS Medical College Gunther von Hagens maintains a permanent exhibition of plastinates and plastination at the Plastinarium in Guben, Germany.

National Hydrography Dataset high-resolution flowline data. The National Map , accessed March 9, 2011 river in White, Van Buren, Searcy, Stone and Cleburne counties of north-central Arkansas. History During the American Civil War, the Battle of Whitney's Lane took place near Searcy on the banks of the Little Red River. Location The upper tributaries of the Little Red River are known as the South Fork, the Middle Fork, and the Devils Fork. Prior to the impoundment of Greers Ferry Lake the three tributaries converged just east of Sugar Loaf Mountain.Mountain View, Arkansas, 1:125000 Topographic Quadrangle, USGS, 1894 (1949 revision) The South Fork begins in the Ozark National Forest near Scotland in Van Buren County and flows into Greers Ferry Lake near Clinton. The Middle Fork begins only a few miles from the South Fork near Tilly in Van Buren County but flows northward into Searcy County. In Searcy County the river turns east and flows into Stone County where it turns south and flows to meet Greers Ferry Lake in Cleburne County. The Devils Fork begins in northeastern Cleburne County, and flows southwest to meet Greers Ferry Lake near Ida. The three forks converge into the north section of Greers Ferry Lake, which is connected to the south section of the lake by The Narrows, the site of the former Little Red River. The Little Red River begins to flow again at the Greers Ferry Dam at Heber Springs. :Mouth: Confluence with the White River in White County, Arkansas :Source: At the Greers Ferry Dam in Cleburne County Discharge The Little Red River has an average discharge of 1,830 cubic feet per second at Dewey, Arkansas.https://waterdata.usgs.gov/ar/nwis/uv/?site_no=07076517&PARAmeter;_cd=00065,00060 Below the dam The single channel runs from Greers Ferry Dam to its mouth at the White River near Georgetown. The area around the mouth of the river is within the Henry Gray/Hurricane Lake Wildlife Management Area south of Augusta in White County.Henry Gray/Hurricane Lake Wildlife Management Area The water level of the lower sections varies greatly because of releases of cold water from the dam at Greers Ferry during power generation. These water releases can be challenging for boaters. The lower section has a varied geography with areas of gravelly rapids, boulder-strewn areas, and slow, deep pools. The stretch just below the Greers Ferry Dam on the river is well known for its excellent trout fishing. The US Fish and Wildlife Service maintains a trout hatchery just below the dam and releases large numbers of mature trout regularly. The Little Red River was the home of the world-record brown trout (40 pounds 4 ounces (18.3 kg)) from 1992 until 2009. Because cold water flows from beneath the dam, many native warm-water fish are no longer plentiful. \\"We had 40 miles of river that was basically worthless,\\" said Tom Lowery of Judsonia, referring to the section of river downstream from Pangburn. \\"It was pretty to look at, but there was no fishing.\\" While trout thrive near the dam, the cold water drove out many native species. Largemouth bass, crappie, and bream populations may never return to normal. However, recent attempts have been made to reintroduce sport fish, such as walleye and smallmouth bass, to the section of the Little Red River near Searcy. Tom Bly (District Fisheries Biologist for the Arkansas Game and Fish Commission) noted that the walleye and smallmouth bass were chosen for their coveted taste and renowned fighting abilities, respectively. Tom Lowery and Bly also mentioned the lack of public access to the river between Pangburn and Searcy and that the recent influx of oil and gas companies to the area may influence this: ‚ÄúWe know they are going to drill and they are going to need water, which is a renewable resource,‚Äù Bly said. ‚ÄúThey want to work with us to make it environmentally and resource friendly. They may be able to help find areas for public access. They seem willing to work on that. It‚Äôs a win-win situation.\\"Hambrick, Pat, \\"Fishing May Return to Lower Little Red River.\\" The Daily Citizen (Searcy). Online edition. 26 June 2007. accessed 27 June 2007. Carl Garner, in his job as manager of the Little Red River and Greers Ferry Lake, sought participation from the local citizenry to collect trash scattered about the waterways.

Highland Park is considered by whisky insiders one of the greatest single malts in the world. It has been named \\"The Best Spirit in the World\\" on three occasions by F. Paul Pacult, America's foremost expert on distilled spirits. Highland Park has also performed well at international spirit ratings competitions. Its 25 Year Old whisky was the first spirit to ever receive a perfect 100-point score at the Ultimate Spirits Challenge. In 2018, two of its special distillery releases, The Light and The Dark were awarded a Double Gold medal each by the San Francisco World Spirits Competition. In 2019 and for the fourth year running, Highland Park took home the Ultimate Spirits Challenge's top honor, the Chairman's Trophy for Best in Category. In 2018, Highland Park ranked #2 behind sister distillery, The Macallan in whisky auction sales driven by growing demand for the distillery's special releases from whisky collectors. History Highland Park distillery was founded by Magnus Eunson, a butcher and church officer by day and illicit distiller and whisky smuggler by night. In 1798 he was caught illegally distilling whisky on the site. In 1826, nearly 30 years later, Highland Park received an official license to distill whisky. The name of the distillery does not refer to the area of Scotland known as The Highlands, but rather to the fact that the distillery was founded on an area called 'High Park' distinguished from a lower area nearby. Within the malthouse at Highland Park Distillery.  Production  The basic process at Highland Park is similar to that at other distilleries. However, there are some key differences that make Highland Park unique in the world of single malts. Heathery peat: Highland Park is the only distillery in the world to use peat from Orkney. Exposed to the elements and pounded relentlessly by gale- force winds, few trees survive Orkney‚Äôs harsh conditions. In absence of trees, the peat the distillery burns to smoke its hand-malted barley is densely compacted heather dating back 4,000 - 9,000 years. This peat burns slowly, delivering the distinctive aromatic smoke the distillery is known for. Temperate weather: Although rainy and windy, the islands of Orkney are blessed with a surprisingly temperate climate, providing the perfect environment for whisky casks to quietly mature at an even pace, without being exposed to extremes in temperature. Sherry-seasoned oak casks: Between 60-80% of a whisky‚Äôs flavor comes the cask in which it matures. Highland Park uses casks made of either American or European oak. These are built by hand in Spain, filled with Oloroso Sherry and left to season for two years. The casks are then emptied and sent to Orkney where they are filled with the new make spirit and left to mature for at least a decade ‚Äì and up to five in the case of Highland Park 50 Year Old.  Character  Highland Park has a unique flavor profile that no other whisky has. The distillery's signature sherry seasoned oak casks deliver big, rich flavors while Orkney's unique heathery peat adds layers of aromatic smoke. The Highland Park range includes permanent and limited edition whiskies that are all grounded in the distillery's trademark smoky character.

Biography  Claude Simon was born in Tananarive on the isle of Madagascar. His parents were French, his father being a career officer who was killed in the First World War. He grew up with his mother and her family in Perpignan in the middle of the wine district of Roussillon. Among his ancestors was a general from the time of the French Revolution. After secondary school at Coll√®ge Stanislas in Paris and brief sojourns at Oxford and Cambridge he took courses in painting at the Andr√© Lhote Academy. He then travelled extensively through Spain, Germany, the Soviet Union, Italy and Greece. This experience as well as those from the Second World War show up in his literary work. At the beginning of the war Claude Simon took part in the battle of the Meuse (1940) and was taken prisoner. He managed to escape and joined the resistance movement. At the same time he completed his first novel, Le Tricheur (\\"The Cheat\\", published in 1946), which he had started to write before the war. He lived in Paris and used to spend part of the year at Salses in the Pyrenees. In 1960, he was a signatory to the Manifesto of the 121 in favor of Algerian independence. In 1961 Claude Simon received the prize of L'Express for La Route des Flandres and in 1967 the M√©dicis prize for Histoire. The University of East Anglia made him honorary doctor in 1973.  Novels  Much of Claude Simon's writing is autobiograpichal dealing with personal experiences from World war II and the Spanish Civil war, and his family history. His early novels are largely traditional in form, but with Le vent (1957) and L'Herbe (1958) he developed a style associated with the Nouveau roman. La Route de Flandres (1960), that tells about wartime experiences, earned him the L'Express prize and international recognition. In Triptyque (1973) three different stories are mixed together without paragraph breaks. The novels Histoire (1967), Les G√©orgiques (1981) and L'Acacia (1989) are largely about Simon's family history.Claude Simon Authors calendar = Style and influences = Simon is often identified with the nouveau roman movement exemplified in the works of Alain Robbe-Grillet and Michel Butor, and while his fragmented narratives certainly contain some of the formal disruption characteristic of that movement (in particular Histoire, 1967, and Triptyque, 1973), he nevertheless retains a strong sense of narrative and character.Entre tradition et modernit√© (1967‚Äì1980). ccic-cerisy.asso.fr In fact, Simon arguably has much more in common with his Modernist predecessors than with his contemporaries; in particular, the works of Marcel Proust and William Faulkner are a clear influence. Simon's use of self-consciously long sentences (often stretching across many pages and with parentheses sometimes interrupting a clause which is only completed pages later) can be seen to reference Proust's style, and Simon moreover makes use of certain Proustian settings (in La Route des Flandres, for example, the narrator's captain de Reixach is shot by a sniper concealed behind a hawthorn hedge or haie d'aub√©pines, a reference to the meeting between Gilberte and the narrator across a hawthorn hedge in Proust's √Ä la recherche du temps perdu). The Faulknerian influence is evident in the novels' extensive use of a fractured timeline with frequent and potentially disorienting analepsis (moments of chronological discontinuity), and of an extreme form of free indirect speech in which narrative voices (often unidentified) and streams of consciousness bleed into the words of the narrator. The ghost of Faulkner looms particularly large in 1989's L'Acacia, which uses a number of non-sequential calendar dates covering a wide chronological period in lieu of chapter headings, a device borrowed from Faulkner's The Sound and the Fury. = Themes = Despite these influences, Simon's work is thematically and stylistically highly original. War is a constant and central theme (indeed it is present in one form or another in almost all of Simon's published works), and Simon often contrasts various individuals' experiences of different historical conflicts in a single novel; World War I and the Second World War in L'Acacia (which also takes into account the impact of war on the widows of soldiers), the French Revolutionary Wars and the Second World War in Les G√©orgiques. In addition, many of the novels deal with the notion of family history, those myths and legends which are passed down through generations and which conspire in Simon's work to affect the protagonists' lives. In this regard, the novels make use of a number of leitmotifs which recur in different combinations between novels (a technique also employed by Marguerite Duras), in particular the suicide of an eighteenth-century ancestor and the death of a contemporary relative by sniper-fire. Finally, almost all of Simon's novels feature horses; Simon was himself an accomplished equestrian, and fought in a mounted regiment during World War II (the ridiculousness of mounted soldiers fighting in a mechanised war is a major theme of La Route des Flandres and Les G√©orgiques). Simon's principal obsession, however, is with the ways in which humans experience time (another Modernist fascination). The novels often dwell on images of old-age, such as the decaying 'LSM' or the old woman (that 'flaccid and ectoplasmic Cassandra') in Les G√©orgiques, which are frequently seen through the uncomprehending eyes of childhood. Simon's use of family history equally attempts to show how individuals exist in history‚Äîthat is, how they might feel implicated in the lives and stories of their ancestors who died long ago.

As a writer he was an interesting figure, distancing himself both from the conservative environment in which he was brought up and from his socialist contemporaries and friends. He was the youngest and in many ways the most original and influential member of the Modern Break-Through. Early life and career Pontoppidan c. 1874 The son of a Jutlandic vicar and belonging to an old family of vicars and writers, Pontoppidan gave up an education as an engineer, worked as a primary school teacher and finally became a freelance journalist and full-time writer, making his debut in 1881. The first phase of his work constitutes rebellious social criticism, and as such was also a revolt against his own privileged family background. In a famous quote, Henrik Pontoppidan mocked the historic latinisation of his own surname Pontoppidan from its original Danish root Broby Henrik Pontoppidan. e-poke.dk (in Danish) In matter-of-fact short stories he mercilessly describes the life of the peasants and country proletarians, with whom he lived in close contact. He was perhaps the first Danish progressive writer to break with an idealised portrayal of farmers. The tales from this era are collected in Landsbybilleder (\\"Village Pictures\\", 1883) and Fra Hytterne (\\"From the Huts\\", 1887). An important part is his 1890 political collection of short stories Skyer (\\"Clouds\\"), a biting description of Denmark under the authoritarian semi-dictatorship of the Conservatives both condemning the oppressors and scorning the Danes‚Äô lack of disaffection. After this period he increasingly concentrated on psychological and naturalist problems without giving up his social engagement. Pontoppidan's 1889 review \\"Messias\\" and 1890 piece \\"Den gamle Adam\\" were anonymously published and triggered a controversy after being denounced as blasphemous. The publisher, newspaper editor Ernst Brandes, was fined 300 kroner for \\"Messias\\" in December 1891 and committed suicide in 1892. Main works The three novels which are normally considered to be Pontoppidan‚Äôs main works were written from about 1890 to 1920. In these works he established on his own terms a Danish version of the \\"broad description of society\\" novel in the tradition of Balzac and Zola. Centred on a hero he paints a picture of Denmark in the era of the Constitutional Struggle between Conservative and Liberals, rising industrialisation, cultural conflicts and awakening revolutionary movements. * Det forj√¶ttede Land (I-III 1891‚Äì95, English translation of vol. I-II The Promised Land 1896), describes a fantasist and his dream of being a preacher in the country which leads to self-deception and insanity. * The partly autobiographical Lykke-Per (1898‚Äì1904) (Lucky Per), perhaps his most famous novel, deals with the self-confident, richly gifted man who breaks with his religious family in order to be an engineer and a conqueror, free of heritage and milieu. However, at the height of his success, they at last catch up with him and he gives up his career to find himself in loneliness. * The bitter De d√∏des Rige (1912‚Äì16, \\"The Realm of the Dead\\") shows Denmark after the apparent victory of democracy in 1901, a society in which political ideals are mouldering, capitalism is marching on and press and art are prostituted, all centred about the hopeless love and reform plans of a young progressive squire afflicted by illness. Other works Pontoppidan's last large novel Mands Himmerig (1927, \\"Man‚Äôs Heaven\\") is an almost desperate description of the crisis of a Danish intellectual at the time of the outbreak of World War I. Pontoppidan also wrote many short novels and long tales in which he discussed political, psychological and sexual themes. Isbj√∏rnen (1887, \\"The Polar Bear\\") describes the confrontation between an outspoken vicar from Greenland and his narrow-minded Danish provincial clergymen. Mimoser (1886, Engl. transl. The Apothecary‚Äôs Daughters, 1890) is an ironic-tragic tale about the exaggerated intolerance of unfaithfulness. Nattevagt (1894, \\"Night Watch\\") deals with a courageous and revolutionary artist who is nevertheless a frustrated failure as a husband. Pontoppidan drew on the life of his friend the painter L. A. Ring for the portrait of the artist Thorkild Drehling, Ring considered it a betrayal of trust and broke off the friendship.Finn, Terman, Frederiksen. 2007. EN K√ÜRLIGHEDSHISTORIE: Nogle kunsthistoriske konsekvenser af L.A. Rings forhold til Johanne Wilde. Ud.Tryk vol. 8:1. Den gamle Adam (1894, \\"The Old Adam\\") deals with both men‚Äôs fear of women and of sexuality as a whole. √òrneflugt (1899, \\"Eagles flight\\") is a direct commentary on Hans Christian Andersens The Ugly Duckling with the opposite morale. An eagle brought up in a barnyard grows fat and eventually dies crashlanding into a dungpile - the morale being that you may very well have been born in an eagle's egg but that won't matter if you're brought up in a barnyard. \\"Borgmester Hoeck og Hustru\\" (1905, Engl. transl. Burgomaster Hoeck and His Wife, 1999) portrays a tragic marriage dominated by the husband's jealousy and dislike of his wife's joy in life. A central theme in most of these tales is the difficulties of handling the new tolerance, open-mindedness and democratisation which are introduced by both the transition of society and by literature. Another theme is the conflict between the introverted and closed male nature and the vitality of the woman. Behind all this lies the classic naturalist theme of heritage and milieu against which man has to rebel without quite denying their existence. In his later works he sometimes seems to become a mixture of a castigator of society and a prophet of doom. Between 1933 and 1943 Pontoppidan wrote two different versions of his Memoirs, in which he tried to define his own view of his personal development. Though handicapped by blindness and deafness in later life, he continued to take an interest in politics and cultural life until his final years. Literary and cultural influence Portrait of Pontoppidan by Michael Ancher (1908) As a stylist Pontoppidan has been described a born naturalist. His language looks plain, simple and easy but is often loaded with symbols and secret hints, hidden irony and ‚Äúobjective‚Äù descriptions. He often revised previous works, simplifying them but also changing their plot or sharpening their attitude. In spite of being well known as a man of positions and attitudes Pontoppidan remains one of the most discussed modern Danish writers. This is partly because of his personal character. Pontoppidan was a man of many paradoxes: a clear liberal in his time, but a stern patriot, an anti-clerical puritan, a disillusioned fighting nature, collaborating with socialists but always from an independent and individualist position. But it is also partly due to his style which has often been regarded as ambiguous and impenetrable; his mixture of partiality and objectivity has often confused both readers and critics and in fact liberals, radicals, conservatives, right wingers and socialists have all tried to reflect their own ideals in his works. He has been regarded both as the absolute antagonist of Georg Brandes and as his most congenial pupil. Among all the authors of the Modern Break-Through, Pontoppidan is probably the most influential and longest living. His social critical writings mark him as a pioneer of 20th Century Danish literature. Cultural conservatives have been inspired by his critique of modernism after World War I. Finally, he set a standard of \\"novels about society\\" which remains relevant. Trivia * Pontoppidan originally studied at the Polyteknisk L√¶reanstalt (today the Technical University of Denmark) to become a civil engineer. When in 1876 another student at Polyteknisk L√¶reanstalt was preferred to Pontoppidan to participate in the Greenland Expedition, Pontopiddan was devastated and quit his studies shortly before the final exam in disappointment. It has been said that due to the failure to be selected for the Greenland Expedition that he hoped would make him famous, Pontoppidan became - famous. The other student selected instead of Pontoppidan died during the expedition. * Pontoppidan's brother's daughter-in-law was the famous Danish actress Clara Pontoppidan (IMDB). * Pontoppidan's brother, Knud Pontoppidan was a famous psychiatrist and doctor. * Pontoppidan was related through his family with the famous pietistic priest Erik Pontoppidan * Pontoppidan is buried in his family's grave site in the cemetery of R√∏rvig Kirke. * The name Pontoppidan is latinisation of the Danish surname Broby, literally translated into Bridge (by the) City, or in Latin, Pons Oppidum. Henrik Pontoppidan mocked this practice, which had taken place in the 17th century, as \\"the bad idea from educated people's custom, to decorate their good Danish name with a Latin Adrienne,\\" (a female dress worn at the time for dances) \\"a ridiculous Peacockish plumage\\".

He was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1922 \\"for the happy manner in which he has continued the illustrious traditions of the Spanish drama\\". Biography Born in Madrid, the son of a celebrated pediatrician, he returned drama to reality by way of social criticism: declamatory verse giving way to prose, melodrama to comedy, formula to experience, impulsive action to dialogue and the play of minds. Benavente showed a preoccupation with aesthetics and later with ethics. A liberal monarchist and a critic of socialism, he was a reluctant supporter of Francoist Spain as the only viable alternative to what he considered the disastrous republican experiment of 1931‚Äì1936. In 1936 Benavente's name became associated with the assassination of the Spanish poet and dramatist Federico Garc√≠a Lorca. This happened when the Nationalist newspapers Estampa, El Correo de Andalucia, and Ideal circulated a fake news story that Lorca had been killed as a reprisal for the Republican murder of Benavente. Benavente died in Aldeaencabo de Escalona (Toledo) at the age of 87. He never married. According to many sources, he was homosexual.

Early life  Alexis Leger was born in Pointe-√†-Pitre, Guadeloupe. His great-grandfather, a solicitor, had settled in Guadeloupe in 1815. His grandfather and father were also solicitors; his father was also a member of the city council. The Leger family owned two plantations, one of coffee (La Jos√©phine) and the other of sugar (Bois-Debout). In 1897, H√©g√©sippe L√©gitimus, the first native Guadeloupan elected president of the Guadeloupe General Council, took office with a vindictive agenda towards colonists. The Leger family returned to metropolitan France in 1899 and settled in Pau. The young Alexis felt like an expatriate and spent much of his time hiking, fencing, riding horses and sailing in the Atlantic. He passed the baccalaur√©at with honours and began studying law at the University of Bordeaux. When his father died in 1907, the resulting strain on his family's finances led Leger to temporarily interrupt his studies, but he eventually completed his degree in 1910. In 1904, he met the poet Francis Jammes at Orthez, who became a close friend. He frequented cultural clubs, and met Paul Claudel, Odilon Redon, Valery Larbaud and Andr√© Gide.They are some of the intellectual friendships over the course of his lifetime that are attested to by the correspondence published in his ≈íuvres Compl√®tes. He wrote short poems inspired by the story of Robinson Crusoe (Images √† Crusoe) and undertook a translation of Pindar. He published his first book of poetry, √âloges, in 1911.  Diplomatic service  In 1914, he joined the French diplomatic service, and spent some of his first years in Spain, Germany and the United Kingdom. When World War I broke out, he was a press corps attach√© for the government. From 1916 to 1921, he was secretary to the French embassy in Peking. In 1921 in Washington, DC, while taking part in a world disarmament conference, he was noticed by Aristide Briand, Prime Minister of France, who recruited him as his assistant. In Paris, he got to know the fellow intellectual poet Larbaud, who used his influence to get the poem Anabase published, written during Leger's stay in China. Leger was warm to classical music and knew Igor Stravinsky, Nadia Boulanger, and Les Six. Saint-John Perse attends the negotiations for the Munich Agreement on 29 September 1938. He stands behind Mussolini, right. While in China, Leger had written his first extended poem Anabase, publishing it in 1924 under the pseudonym \\"Saint-John Perse\\", which he employed for the rest of his life. He then published nothing for two decades, not even a re-edition of his debut book, as he believed it inappropriate for a diplomat to publish fiction. After Briand's death in 1932, Leger served as the General Secretary of the French Foreign Office (Quai d'Orsay) until 1940. Within the Foreign Office he led the optimist faction that believed that Germany was unstable and that if Britain and France stood up to Hitler, he would back down.May, Ernest Strange Victory, New York: Hill & Wang, 2000, p. 150. He accompanied the French Prime Minister √âdouard Daladier at the Munich Conference in 1938, where the cession of part of Czechoslovakia to Germany was agreed to. He was dismissed from his post right after the Fall of France in May 1940, as he was a known anti-Nazi. In mid-July 1940, Leger began a long exile in Washington, DC.  Later life  In 1940, the Vichy government dismissed him from the L√©gion d'honneur order and revoked his French citizenship (it was reinstated after the war). He was in some financial difficulty as an exile in Washington until Archibald MacLeish, the director of the Library of Congress and himself a poet, raised enough private donations to enable the library to employ him until his official retirement from the French civil service in 1947. He declined a teaching position at Harvard University. During his American exile, he wrote his long poems Exil, Vents, Pluies, Neiges, Amers, and Chroniques. He remained in the US long after the end of the war. He travelled extensively, observing nature and enjoying the friendship of US Attorney General Francis Biddle and his spouse, philanthropist Beatrice Chanler, and author Katherine Garrison Chapin. He was on good terms with the UN Secretary General and author Dag Hammarskj√∂ld. In 1957, American friends gave him a villa at Giens, Provence, France. He then split his time between France and the United States. In 1958, he married the American Dorothy Milburn Russell. In 1960, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature. After receiving the Nobel Prize, he wrote the long poems Chronique, Oiseaux and Chant pour un √©quinoxe and the shorter Nocturne and S√©cheresse. In 1962, Georges Braque worked with master printmaker Aldo Crommelynck to create a series of etchings and aquatints, L'Ordre des Oiseaux, which was published with the text of Perse's Oiseaux by Au Vent d'Arles. A few months before he died, Leger donated his library, manuscripts and private papers to Fondation Saint-John Perse, a research centre devoted to his life and work (Cit√© du Livre, Aix-en-Provence), which remains active to the present day. He died in his villa in Giens and is buried nearby. Works *√âloges (1911, transl.

It is the former capital of Khwarezmia and the Khanate of Khiva. Itchan Kala in Khiva was the first site in Uzbekistan to be inscribed in the World Heritage List (1991). The astronomer, historian and polymath, Al-BiruniPatrologia Orientalis Tom. Decimus, p.291 https://archive.org/details/patrologiaorient10pariuoft (973-1048 CE) was born in either Khiva or the nearby city of Kath.  Etymology  The origin of the name Khiva is unknown, but many contradictory stories have been told to explain it. A traditional story attributes the name to one of the sons of Prophet Noah(AS): \\"It is said that Shem(AS) [from whence the word Semitic is derived], after the flood, he found himself wandering in the desert alone. Having fallen asleep, he dreamt of 300 burning torches. On waking up, he was pleased with this omen, he founded the city with outlines in the form of a ship mapped out according to the placement of the torches, about which he had dreamt. Then Sim dug the 'Kheyvak' well, the water from which had a surprising taste. It is possible to see this well in Ichan-Kala (an internal town of Khiva City) even today.\\" Another story relates that travellers passing through the city, upon drinking the excellent water, would exclaim \\"Khey vakh!\\" (\\"What a pleasure!\\") and hence the city became known as Kheyvakh, whence Khiva. A third proposal is that the name comes from the word Khwarezm, altered by borrowing into Turkic as Khivarezem, then shortened to Khiva.  History  The painter Vasily Vereshchagin was present at the taking of Khiva by Russian forces. In the early part of its history, the inhabitants of the area came from Iranian stock and spoke an Eastern Iranian language called Khwarezmian. Turks replaced the Iranian ruling-class in the 10th century A.D., and the region gradually turned into an area with a majority of Turkic speakers. The earliest records of the city of Khiva appear in Muslim travel accounts from the 10th century, although archaeological evidence indicates habitation in the 6th century. By the early 17th century, Khiva had become the capital of the Khanate of Khiva, ruled by a branch of the Astrakhans, a Genghisid dynasty. 2014 Image of Palvan Gate Of Khiva, built early 19th Century, known to have hosted large slave market and a center of punishments and executions In the 17th century Khiva began to develop as a slave market. During the first half of the 19th century, around one million Persians and an unknown number of Russians, were enslaved there before being sold. A large part of them were involved in the construction of buildings in the walled Ichan-Kala. =Campaigns= In the course of the Russian conquest of Central Asia, in 1873 the Russian General Konstantin von Kaufman launched an attack on the city of Khiva, which fell on 28 May 1873. Although the Russian Empire now controlled the Khanate, it allowed Khiva to remain as a nominally quasi-independent protectorate. Following the Bolshevik seizure of power in Russia after the October Revolution of 1917, a short-lived (1920-1925) Khorezm People's Soviet Republic formed out of the territory of the old Khanate of Khiva before its incorporation into the USSR in 1925. The city of Khiva became part of the Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic. Sights City wall Khiva is split into two parts. The outer town, called Dichan Kala, was formerly protected by a wall with 11 gates. The inner town, or Itchan Kala, is encircled by brick walls, whose foundations are believed to have been laid in the 10th century. Present- day crenellated walls date back to the late 17th century and attain the height of 10 meters. Kalta Minor, the large blue tower in the central city square, was supposed to be a minaret, but the Khan died and the succeeding Khan did not complete it. The old town retains more than 50 historic monuments and 250 old houses, mostly dating from the 18th or the 19th centuries. Djuma Mosque, for instance, was established in the 10th century and rebuilt in 1788‚Äì89, although its celebrated hypostyle hall still retains 112 columns taken from ancient structures.

Her experiences resulting from the rise of the Nazis in World War II Europe transformed her into a poignant spokesperson for the grief and yearnings of her fellow Jewish people. Her best-known play is ' (1950); other works include the poems \\"\\" (1962), \\"\\" (1970), and the collections of poetry ' (1947), ' (1959), ' (1961), and ' (1971). She was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature in 1966. Life and career Leonie Sachs was born in Berlin-Sch√∂neberg, Germany, in 1891 to a Jewish family. Her parents were the wealthy natural rubber and gutta-percha manufacturers Georg William Sachs (1858‚Äì1930) and his wife Margarete, n√©e Karger (1871‚Äì1950). She was educated at home because of frail health. She showed early signs of talent as a dancer, but her protective parents did not encourage her to pursue a profession. She grew up as a very sheltered, introverted young woman and never married. She pursued an extensive correspondence with her friends Selma Lagerl√∂f and Hilde Domin. As the Nazis took power, she became increasingly terrified, at one point losing the ability to speak, as she would remember in verse: \\"When the great terror came/I fell dumb.\\" Sachs fled with her aged mother to Sweden in 1940. It was her friendship with Lagerl√∂f that saved their lives: shortly before her own death Lagerl√∂f intervened with the Swedish royal family to secure their release from Germany. Sachs and her mother escaped on the last flight from Nazi Germany to Sweden, a week before Sachs was scheduled to report to a concentration camp. They settled in Sweden and Sachs became a Swedish citizen in 1952. Living in a tiny two-room apartment in Stockholm, Sachs cared alone for her mother for many years, and supported their existence by translations between Swedish and German. After her mother's death, Sachs suffered several nervous breakdowns characterized by hallucinations, paranoia, and delusions of persecution by Nazis, and spent a number of years in a mental institution. She continued to write while hospitalized, and eventually recovered sufficiently to live on her own, though her mental health remained fragile. Her worst breakdown was ostensibly precipitated by hearing spoken German during a trip to Switzerland to accept a literary prize. But she maintained a forgiving attitude toward younger Germans, and corresponded with many German-speaking writers of the postwar period, including Hans Magnus Enzensberger and Ingeborg Bachmann. On the 127th anniversary of her birthday, 10 December 2018, Sachs was commemorated with a Google Doodle in parts of Europe and the US.  Paul Celan and lyrical poetry In the context of the Shoah, her deep friendship with \\"brother\\" poet Paul Celan is often noted today. Their bond was described in one of Celan's most famous poems, \\"\\" (\\"Z√ºrich, The Stork Inn\\").Excerpt Selected Poems and Prose of Paul Celan, translated by John Felstiner. W. W. Norton. In The New York Times Sachs and Celan shared the Holocaust and the fate of the Jews throughout history, their interest in Jewish and Christian beliefs and practices, and their literary models; their imagery was often remarkably similar, though developed independently. Their friendship was supportive during professional conflicts. Celan also suffered from artistic infighting (Claire Goll's accusations of plagiarism) during a period of frustration with his work's reception. When Sachs met Celan she was embroiled in a long dispute with Finnish-Jewish composer over his adaptation of her play '. In Celan she found someone who understood her anxiety and hardships as an artist. Sachs's poetry is intensely lyrical and reflects some influence by German Romanticism, especially in her early work. The poetry she wrote as a young woman in Berlin is more inspired by Christianity than Judaism and makes use of traditional Romantic imagery and themes. Much of it concerns an unhappy love affair Sachs suffered in her teens with a non-Jewish man who would eventually be killed in a concentration camp. After Sachs learned of her only love interest's death, she bound up his fate with that of her people and wrote many love lyrics ending not only in the beloved's death, but in the catastrophe of the Holocaust. Sachs herself mourns no longer as a jilted lover but as a personification of the Jewish people in their vexed relationship to history and God. Her fusion of grief with subtly romantic elements is in keeping with the imagery of the kabbalah, where the Shekhinah represents God's presence on earth and mourns for the separation of God from His people in their suffering. Thus Sachs's Romanticism allowed her to develop self-consciously from a German to a Jewish writer, with a corresponding change in her language: still flowery and conventional in some of her first poetry on the Holocaust, it becomes ever more compressed and surreal, returning to a series of the same images and tropes (dust, stars, breath, stones and jewels, blood, dancers, fish suffering out of water, madness, and ever-frustrated love) in ways that are sometimes comprehensible only to her readers, but always moving and disturbing. Though Sachs does not resemble many authors, she appears to have been influenced by Gertrud Kolmar and Else Lasker-Sch√ºler in addition to Celan. In 1961 Sachs won the first Nelly Sachs Prize, a literary award given biennially by the German city of Dortmund and named in her honour. When, with Shmuel Yosef Agnon, she was awarded the 1966 Nobel Prize in Literature, she observed that Agnon represented Israel whereas \\"I represent the tragedy of the Jewish people.\\" She read her poem \\"In der Flucht\\" at the ceremony. Sachs died from colorectal cancer in 1970. She was interred in the Norra begravningsplatsen in Stockholm. Her possessions were donated to the National Library of Sweden. A memorial plaque commemorates her birthplace, Maa√üenstra√üe 12, in Sch√∂neberg, Berlin, where there is also a park named for her in Dennewitzstra√üe. A park on the island of Kungsholmen in Stockholm also bears her name.

It consists of stick-like elongated spiders that catch prey by stretching a web across their front legs before propelling themselves forward. These unusual webs will stretch two or three times their relaxed size, entangling any prey that touch them. The posterior median eyes have excellent night vision, allowing them to cast nets accurately in low-light conditions. These eyes are larger than the others, and sometimes makes these spiders appear to only have two eyes. Ogre-faced spiders (Deinopis) are the best known genus in this family. The name refers to the perceived physical similarity to the mythological creature of the same name. This genus also includes the humped-back spiders (Menneus). They are distributed through tropics worldwide from Australia to Africa and the Americas. In Florida, Deinopis often hangs upside down from a silk line under palmetto fronds during the day. At night, it emerges to practice its unusual prey capture method on invertebrate prey. Its eyes are able to gather available light more efficiently than the eyes of cats and owls, and are able to do this despite the lack of a reflective layer (tapetum lucidum); instead, each night, a large area of light-sensitive membrane is manufactured within the eyes, and since arachnid eyes do not have irises, it is rapidly destroyed again at dawn.

Coombs is home to approximately 1,327 people and is renowned for its Old Country Market (which features a family of goats living on the roof), Butterfly World (which includes a small indoor tropical rainforest), the 106 year old Coombs Fall Fair and the Coombs Bluegrass Festival held every B.C. Day weekend. The history of Coombs goes back many years. The Ford House which is the old log house situated on the Alberni Highway is dated back to the early 1900s. The pioneer Walter Ford house was completed in 1911. Next to the Ford House is the old General Store which also always housed the General Post Office. The Coombs Fair Grounds is an active place throughout the year. The Rodeo Grounds just up the highway heading towards Port Alberni is a successful and active place during the summer months. The railway line is also a huge part of the history of Coombs. Along with the United Church and just over the French Creek Bridge is the French Creek School, opened in 1912, which closed in 2015 but is used now as a Coombs Community Commons. French Creek school was a huge asset to the community for over 100 years. The community was established in 1910 under a Salvation Army emigration plan to relocate people from the crowded cities in Great Britain. This new town was named after Commissioner Thomas Bales Coombs, head of the Salvation Army movement in Canada in the early 1900s. Coombs was retiring in 1911 so the Salvation Army honored him by naming the new Vancouver Island colony after him. Unfortunately Commissioner Coombs never visited the Coombs Colony.

The distillery is operated by John Dewar & Sons Ltd for Bacardi. History The Brackla distillery was built in 1812 by Captain William Fraser of Brackla House on the estate of Cawdor Castle. Brackla whisky was selected by King William IV to be his whisky at the Royal Court. In 1833 Brackla Distillery became the first whisky distillery to be granted a Royal Warrant by order of the King. This made Royal Brackla one of only three distilleries to bear the name 'Royal', the others being the active distillery Royal Lochnagar and the demolished distillery Glenury Royal. Queen Victoria renewed Brackla's Royal Warrant in 1838. In 1839 William Fraser & Co took over the distillery and it was passed from William Fraser to his son Robert Fraser in 1852. It was in 1878 that Robert Fraser disposed of the distillery to the firm Robert Fraser & CoRoyal Brackla Distillery Co.,Company Prospectus 1879 and in 1879 the company was reconstructed as the Brackla Distillery Co Ltd. The 1897 Prospectus reveals that the capital of the company was ¬£100,000, divided into 40,000 preference and 60,000 ordinary shares. The Directors of the company were James Anderson, Wine Merchant, Leith, Andrew Usher of Northfield, John Usher of Norton and Walter C. Newbigging, distiller at Brackla. The Prospectus also reported: \\"Brackla's whisky has long been known as one of the best Highland malt whiskies in the market. The demand for it has for years been much in excess of the supply, and in order to cope with this demand considerable additions have recently been made to the distillery.\\" The distillery and warehouse, at this time, was on a site of over 13 acres, this was held under lease from the Earl of Cawdor. In 1919 John Mitchel and James Leith of Aberdeen acquired the company but then sold it in 1926 to John Bisset & Co Ltd of Leith. They were taken over by the Distillers Company Ltd in 1943. Due to restrictions on the use of barley for distilling during the Second World War a majority of Scotch Whisky distilleries closed, including the Royal Brackla Distillery from 1943 until 1945. An airfield was built beside the distillery in 1940, to provide a landing ground for operational training and air gunnery. 1964 saw the distillery close its doors again until 1966, this was due to major reconstruction and re-planning. The traditional method of coal-firing the stills by hand was changed to internal heating by steam generated from a coal-fired boiler. In 1965 an underground supply of water, created during the Second World War for an airfield, was acquired and used for cooling spirit vapour. In 1970 the distillery was expanded by adding a second pair of stills and converting the coal-fired boiler to oil-fired. New racked warehouses were built in 1975 to replace the older traditional warehouses that were still in use at the time. The Royal Brackla Distillery closed again in 1985. The casks of whisky remained on site in the warehouses where they continued to mature and be used for blending, as required by the owners. The distillery reopened in 1991. Methods of production Royal Brackla has a mash tun of and eight wash backs with a total volume of . Cawdor Burn has been the constant water supply for Royal Brackla, with the Cursack Springs being used for mashing. The distillery uses four stills to produce its whisky, two wash stills with a combined capacity of i and two spirit stills that have combined capacity of 42,000 litres. The fermentation process lasts for a total of 70 hours and is followed by the distillation process. Tall Royal Brackla stills, designed to allow plenty of reflux, are operated slowly in the distillation process to smooth the blend to maximise copper contact and produce a light spirit. The final stage is maturation and this takes place in oak casks. Proprietary bottlings 1991: To commemorate the re-opening of Royal Brackla Distillery, a special 60-year-old Royal Brackla single malt was released. It was claimed the cask (from 1924) was discovered in a warehouse in 1984. 40%, 70cl. 1993: Royal Brackla was released as a 10-year-old in the Flora and Fauna series, produced by United Distillers.

He played in Major League Baseball for the Florida Marlins, Detroit Tigers, Arizona Diamondbacks and Cincinnati Reds. Willis was notable for his success during his first few years in the major leagues and for his unconventional pitching style, which included a high leg kick and exaggerated twisting away from the batter.Dontrelle Willis bio He was named the 2003 National League Rookie of the Year. Career =Early career= Willis was raised by his mother, Joyce, a welder, in Alameda, California. She played in elite-level softball leagues when Willis was a child. Willis never knew his father, Clinton Ostah, who was a minor league player in the 1970s. Growing up, Willis rooted for the Oakland Athletics as a child. Willis' favorite player was former Oakland Athletics' pitcher Dave Stewart. Willis attended Encinal High School in Alameda, where he played baseball for four years. In Willis' senior year in 2000, he had a 0.70 earned run average (ERA) with 111 strikeouts in 70 innings pitched and was named California Player of the Year. He initially committed to play college baseball at Arizona State. He was drafted by the Chicago Cubs in the 8th round of the 2000 Major League Baseball draft. In 2001, Willis was promoted to the Boise Hawks of the Northwest League. He finished with 8 wins and a 2.98 earned run average. Opposing hitters only batted .217 against Willis. In a Baseball America poll, several NWL managers called Willis Boise's best player. =Florida Marlins= Willis with the Florida Marlins in 2007. On March 27, 2002, the Cubs traded Willis (then a minor leaguer), fellow pitchers Juli√°n Tav√°rez and Jos√© Cueto, and catcher Ryan Jorgensen to the Florida Marlins, in exchange for pitchers Matt Clement and Antonio Alfonseca. After being traded, Willis struggled early on. However, Willis started to get better as he got to low Class A ball. By the end of the season, he went 10-2 and finished the season with the Class-A Jupiter Hammerheads. In five starts, he went 2-0 with a 1.83 earned run average, leading the Midwest League in earned run average. For his performance, he was named the Marlins' Minor League Pitcher of the Year. In the 2003 spring training, Willis reported to Jupiter. The plan was to start him with the Class-AA Carolina Mudcats. The hope was that he would make the leap to AAA, and potentially be available for a spot start in Florida or a back-of-the-bullpen job late in the season. The Marlins then sent Willis down to Carolina to work on consistency and control. Willis would dominate at Carolina; he went 4‚Äì0 with a 1.49 earned run average. 2003 season On May 9, 2003, Willis made his Major League debut for the Florida Marlins. Against the Rockies, he pitched six innings, allowed seven hits and three earned runs, and got a no decision. On May 14, in a start against the Padres, Willis went five innings, allowed five hits, three earned runs, and four walks, and received his first Major League win. On June 16, Willis pitched nine innings and allowed no runs in a 1-0 victory over the Mets in his first career shutout. Willis' opponent in that game was Tom Glavine, one of his childhood heroes. Willis was named Rookie of the Month for the month of June and became the first Marlins pitcher to be named Pitcher of the Month. He became the first rookie pitcher to win Pitcher of the Month since Hideo Nomo did it in 1995 for the Los Angeles Dodgers and he became the first rookie pitcher to win seven straight starts since Jason Isringhausen, also in 1995. In 5 starts, Willis went 5‚Äì0 with a 1.04 earned run average. Heading into the All-Star Break in mid-July, Willis was 9‚Äì1 with a 2.08 earned run average in 13 starts. He made the National League All-Star team as injury replacement for Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher Kevin Brown. He became the second Marlins rookie to make the All-Star team; Alex Gonz√°lez did it in 1999. On July 30, Willis faced another one of his childhood heroes, Randy Johnson of the Diamondbacks, in a head-to-head pitching duel. Willis went seven innings and allowed only one earned run. After coming out of the bullpen in game 1 of the 2003 National League Division Series against the Giants, Willis started game 4 of the series. In 5.1 innings pitched, Willis allowed 5 hits, 2 base on balls, struck out 3 batters but allowed 5 earned runs. Despite struggling with his pitching, Willis showcased his remarkable (for a pitcher) hitting ability by going 3-for-3 with a triple and scoring a run during that game, which the Marlins won 7‚Äì6 to advance to the NL Championship Series against the Cubs, the team that drafted Willis. In game 4, Willis again struggled with his command. In just 2.1 innings pitched, he allowed 3 hits and allowed 5 base on balls and took the loss. His only other appearance in the series was in game 6, when he allowed a run in one inning of relief. Despite his limited contributions, the Marlins went on to defeat the Cubs in 7 games. The Marlins then defeated the New York Yankees in the 2003 World Series. After the 2003 season, Willis was named the National League Rookie of the Year. He went 14‚Äì6 with a 3.30 earned run average in 27 starts for the year. 2004 season In 2004, Willis started the year 3-0, and did not allow an earned run in his first three starts. He also showed great hitting skills for a pitcher. In his first two starts, Willis went 6-for-6 with a home run. His seven consecutive hits in the regular season was 1 short of the club record held by Gary Sheffield and Preston Wilson. In his next start against the Phillies, Willis struck out in his first at bat, snapping his streak of 10 consecutive hits dating back to previous year's postseason. He finished the 2004 season with a record of 10‚Äì11 and an earned run average of 4.02. 2005 season In 2005, Willis became one of the best pitchers in baseball. He started the 2005 season by pitching two shutouts against the Washington Nationals and the Philadelphia Phillies. During the month of April, Willis went 5‚Äì0 in 5 starts and allowed five earned runs in 35 innings pitched for a 1.29 earned run average. He was named NL Pitcher of the Month. On May 6, Willis became the league's first six-game winner when he went seven innings and allowed no runs against the Rockies. \\"I felt strong,\\" Willis said. \\"I was able to stay down in the zone. That's my key, because I don't throw 100 mph. I can't live up in the zone. In all my starts I've been trying to stay down, and hopefully they swing at it.\\" On June 8, Willis became the major league's first 10-game winner when he pitched the Marlins to a 5-4 victory over the Seattle Mariners, allowing 4 runs. Willis became only the third pitcher in Marlins history to record 10 wins before the All-Star break. On June 23, Willis became the NL's first 12-game winner when he pitched a shutout against the Braves. \\"He's tough,\\" Braves manager Bobby Cox said. \\"He deserves to start the All-Star game, to be honest with you. He's the dominant pitcher in the National League right now.\\" Going into the All- Star break, Willis was 13-4 with a 2.39 earned run average and a 1.14 Walks plus hits per inning pitched. Willis was named to the All-Star team but did not pitch in the game. Willis kept pace with his great first half after the All-Star break. He went 9‚Äì6 and posted a 2.91 earned run average and a 1.13 walks plus hits per innings pitched the rest of the season. During his last start before the All-Star break, Willis struggled against the Cubs. In 4.1 innings, he allowed 8 runs, all earned. He struggled in each of his first two starts after the break, failing to make it past the sixth inning in games against the Philadelphia Phillies and San Francisco Giants. However, he would get back on track. Willis matched his highest win total on July 28 against the Pirates when he went 7 innings, allowed 3 hits, no earned runs, and picked up his 14th victory of the season, which tied his career high for most wins in a season. Willis won his career-high 15th victory on August 7 against the Reds. He went 8 innings, allowed 4 hits, and no earned runs. On August 17, Willis held the Padres scoreless by shutting the Padres out in 9 innings, earning him his 16th win of the season, second most in baseball. \\"He's as good as anybody,\\" San Diego manager Bruce Bochy said. \\"We aren't the first team he has shut out this year.\\" The win put Florida one-and-a-half games behind Houston and Philadelphia in the wild card standings. Willis won his 19th game of the season against the Mets on September 2, breaking Carl Pavano's franchise record for most wins in a season. Pavano held the Marlins' mark for most victories in a season by a Marlins' pitcher for a year. On September 7 against the Washington Nationals, Willis pitched 6 innings and allowed 1 earned run, which gave him his 20th win of the season. He became the first African- American pitcher to win 20 games in a season since Dave Stewart did it in 1990, and in the process, he became the first pitcher to win 20 games and have 20 hits as a batter since Mike Hampton did it in 1999 for the Astros. On September 22, Willis became the first pitcher to bat seventh or higher since Montreal's Steve Renko batted seventh on August 26, 1973. Willis went 1-for-4 against the New York Mets. He would go on to post a 22-10 record with a 2.63 earned run average and 1.13 walks plus hits per innings pitched. His 22 wins was the most in baseball. He also pitched 7 complete games and 5 shutouts, also the most in baseball. Willis is still the only pitcher in Marlins history to win 20 games in a season. Willis would go on to finish 2nd in the N.L. Cy Young Award voting behind Chris Carpenter of the St. Louis Cardinals. He did, however, win the Warren Spahn Award, given to the best left-handed pitcher in each league. 2006 season In the 2006 season, Willis' numbers were down from his great 2005 season. Willis started the season by going 1‚Äì6 with a 4.93 earned run average and did not get his second victory of the season until June 2. He still posted decent numbers for the year and went 12‚Äì12 with a 3.87 earned run average, including 11-6 with a 3.39 earned run average from June to September. His 12 wins were tied for the most on the Marlins. Willis also led the Marlins in complete games (4), innings pitched (), base on balls (83), and hit by pitch (19). On June 20, Willis earned his 50th career win in a start against the Baltimore Orioles. On July 7, Willis hit a grand slam off of Mets pitcher Jos√© Lima, becoming the first pitcher to hit a grand slam since Robert Person did it in 2002. It was his fourth career home run. On September 20, 2006, he hit 2 home runs, off of √ìliver P√©rez and Roberto Hern√°ndez. He became the first pitcher since Randy Wolf in 2004 to hit 2 home runs in a game. 2007 season On January 15, 2007, Willis signed a one-year contract with the Marlins for $6.45 million, avoiding salary arbitration. In the 2007 season, Willis went 10‚Äì15 with a 5.17 earned run average and a 1.60 walks plus hits per innings pitched. Up to that point, it was his worst season of his career. Willis led the National League in earned runs allowed with 118. During his career with the Marlins, Willis went 68-54 with a 3.78 earned run average.

In the Eastern Orthodox Church and Eastern Catholic Churches of the Byzantine rite his feast day is September 4, in the Roman Rite, January 24. He has the distinction of being the first saint recorded as having had his remains moved or \\"translated\\" for religious purposes; a practice that was to become extremely common in later centuries.Eduard Syndicus; Early Christian Art; p. 73; Burns & Oates, London, 1962 Life He was the successor of Zebinus as Bishop of Antioch in the reign of the Emperor Gordian III (238-244), being the twelfth bishop of the see. During the Decian persecution (250) he made an unwavering confession of faith and was thrown into prison where he died from his sufferings. He was, therefore, venerated as a martyr.Kirsch, Johann Peter. \\"St. Babylas.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 2. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1907. 12 Feb. 2014 John Chrysostom's homily upon Babylas and the Acts of the Martyrs report the following story, that Babylas once refused the visiting pagan emperor, on account of his sinful ways, permission to enter the church and had ordered him to take his place among the penitents. John does not give the name of the emperor; the Acts mention Numerian. It is more likely the contemporary Philip the Arab of whom Eusebius (Historia ecclesiastica, VI, 34) reports that a bishop would not let him enter the gathering of Christians at the Easter vigil. Later legend elaborates on this, stating that Babylas demanded that he do penance for his part in the murder of the young Gordian III before he would allow Philip to celebrate Easter. Veneration In 351 the Caesar Constantius Gallus built a new church in honor of Babylas at Daphne, a suburb of Antioch, and had the remains of the bishop transferred to it. The intention of Gallus in translating the remains of Babylas to Daphne was to neutralize the pagan effects of the temple of Apollo located there, or, as Chrysostom expresses it, to \\"bring a physician to the sick.\\" According to Chrysostom, when Emperor Julian consulted the oracle of Apollo at the temple in Daphne (362), he received no answer, and was told that it was because of the proximity of Babylas. He therefore, had the sarcophagus of the martyr exhumed and taken back to his original place of burial. A few days later, on October 22, a mysterious fire broke out in the temple of Apollo, consuming the roof of the building, and the statue of the god, copied from Phidias' statue of Zeus at Olympia. Julian, suspecting angry Christians were responsible, ordered the cathedral of Antioch closed, and an investigation into the cause of the fire: Ammianus Marcellinus reports \\"a frivolous rumor\\" laid the blame to some candles lit by a worshipper late the previous night (XXII, 13). John Chrysostom claimed a bolt of lightning set the temple on fire. The remains of Babylas were reinterred in a church dedicated to him on the other side of the River Orontes. Near the close of his discourse John Chrysostom refers to the erection of the church dedicated to Babylas, and to the zeal of the Bishop Meletius in promoting it, who actually took part in the work with his own hands. This was the first recorded \\"translation\\" of the buried remains of a saint, something that was to become routine in the Middle Ages. The columns and walls of the ruined temple were still pointed out twenty years later. In the Middle Ages, the remains of Babylas are said to have been moved to Cremona.

It is the oldest legal distillery in the parish of Glenlivet, and the production place of the Scottish whisky of the same name. It was founded in 1824 and has operated almost continuously since. The distillery remained open throughout the Great Depression and its only closure came during World War II. The Glenlivet distillery has grown in the post-war period to become one of the biggest single malt distilleries in order to keep up with global demand; The Glenlivet brand is the biggest selling single malt whisky in the United States and the second biggest selling single malt brand globally. Today, the distillery is owned by the French alcoholic beverages company Pernod Ricard, which also oversees the distillery's production of 5,900,000 proof litres per annum. The majority of this ‚Äì enough for 6 million bottles ‚Äì is sold as The Glenlivet single malt, with the remainder being used in Pernod Ricard's blended whisky brands.  Production  The distillery draws water from Josie's Well and other springs a short distance from the distillery. The malt comes from Crisp Maltings, Portgordon. Glenlivet's stills are lantern shaped with long, narrow necks, all of which helps to produce a light-tasting spirit. The distillery has 7 wash stills each with a capacity of 15,000 litres and 7 spirit stills with a capacity of 10,000 litres. The spirit is then matured in oak casks. Glenlivet is categorised as a Speyside distillery. As of 2016, The Glenlivet range consists of 14 whiskies. The main product range from the distillery is The Glenlivet range of single malt scotch whisky, but whisky from the distillery is also used in the production of Pernod Ricard's other brands, including Chivas Regal and Royal Salute whisky brands. Bottling of The Glenlivet took place at a Chivas Brothers bottling plant at Newbridge just outside Edinburgh, but that plant was sold at the end of 2009 with bottling to be transferred to other Chivas Brothers plants. In 2008, The Glenlivet announced expansion plans for the distillery to keep up with increased demand. This includes the installation of a new mash tun, new stills and new wash backs.http://www.just-drinks.com/article.aspx?id=93133 The expansion cost the equivalent of US $15 million and significantly increased capacity.  History  Illicit distilleries were commonplace throughout the Speyside area from 1700s but were largely made redundant with the passing of the Excise Act in 1823. It was under this legislation that legal distilleries could be formed, subject to holding a license. Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon, was allegedly instrumental in the passing of this legislation. Although there is no historical record of his involvement in the issue, his tenant, George Smith, who was operating an illicit distillery on his Upper Drummin farm at the time, became the first person in Scotland to apply for and receive a license to legally produce spirit.THE GLENLIVET HISTORYA Comprehensive Yet Concise History of Scotch WhiskyThe Glenlivet Single Malt Whisky George Smith's decision would prove to be an unpopular decision; every other distiller was operating illegally at the time and hoping the new Excise Act would be repealed, something which would not happen if some distillers accepted the new law. Threats were made against Smith, so George Gordon provided Smith with two pistols to be used to ensure both his own safety and that of the distillery. In 1824, The Glenlivet distillery was established at Upper Drumin by George and his youngest son John Gordon Smith. George Smith established a second distillery during 1849, named the Cairngorm-Delnabo Distillery but by 1855 or 1856, both distilleries were running at full capacity, and were unable to meet rising demand. The operation of two separate sites was also proving difficult and expensive, so plans were formed around the same time to build a new, larger distillery further down the hill at Minmore. Construction of this new distillery was underway when the old Upper Drumin distillery was destroyed by fire during 1858. Construction of the new Minmore distillery was sped up and salvageable equipment from the Upper Drumin distillery was transferred to the new Mimmore distillery. The Delnabo distillery was closed at the same time and the best parts of the equipment were also transferred to the Minmore plant. Production commenced at the new plant during 1859 and it was around the same time the legal entity of George & J.G. Smith, Ltd. was formed. George Smith died in 1871 and his son John Gordon Smith inherited the distillery. The quality of the product from their distillery had resulted in the other distilleries in the area renaming their products to \\"Glenlivet\\" and by the time of George's death, several distillers were doing so. J.G. Smith decided to take legal action and tried to claim ownership on The Glenlivet name, this legal action was only partially successful - the verdict forced other distillers in the area to stop calling their whisky Glenlivet and gave J.G. Smith and the blender Andrew Usher sole permission to use the brand, but permitted other distilleries to hyphenate their distillery name with the \\"Glenlivet\\" name, which resulted in new distillery names such as The Glen Moray-Glenlivet Distillery, a distillery which is situated nearby. The distillery remained open throughout the Great Depression, an event which affected many other distilleries; it wasn't until the Second World War that the distillery was mothballed for the first time, by Government decree. In the aftermath of World War Two, Britain was heavily indebted and needed to export large quantities of goods to earn foreign revenue (mainly United States dollars). Distilling was an ideal industry with whisky much in demand overseas. Distilling restrictions were rapidly lifted and output from the distillery was at pre-war levels by 1947, despite ongoing barley, fuel, and manpower limitations. Bread rationing was retained until 1948 in order to ensure supplies of grain for the distilleries. Glenlivet Distillery (George & J.G. Smith, Ltd.) merged with the Glen Grant Distillery (J. & J. Grant Glen Grant, Ltd.) in 1953 to form The Glenlivet and Glen Grant Distillers, Ltd.. The company would go on to merge with Hill Thomson & Co., Ltd. and Longmorn-Glenlivet Distilleries, Ltd. in 1970 before changing their name to Glenlivet Distillers Ltd in 1972. The company was then purchased by Canadian drinks and media company Seagram in 1977. Seagram's alcohol production interests were acquired by Pernod Ricard and Diageo during 2000, with ownership of Glenlivet Distillers passing to Pernod Ricard. While Glen Grant Distillery was sold to Campari Group in 2005 Pernod Ricard kept control over the Glenlivet and Aberlour single malt whisky brands. The Malt Whisky Trail Map The Glenlivet is the best selling malt whisky in the United States, and the fourth best selling in the UK with a 7% market share. The Glenlivet is the world's second best selling single malt whisky, and current global sales total 6 million bottles per annum. Today, the distillery is a major stop on the Scotland's Malt Whisky Trail of seven working Speyside single malt distilleries in the Strathspey, Scotland region. During the Glenlivet tour (after paying a fee), visitors can sample three of the products.

He is best known for the invention of mechanical puzzles including Rubik's Cube (1974), Rubik's Magic, Rubik's Magic: Master Edition, and Rubik's Snake. While Rubik became famous for inventing the Rubik's Cube and his other puzzles, much of his recent work involves the promotion of science in education. Rubik is involved with several organisations such as Beyond Rubik's Cube, the Rubik Learning Initiative and the Judit Polgar Foundation all of whose aim is to engage students in science, mathematics, and problem solving at a young age. Early life =Childhood and parental influence= Ern≈ë Rubik was born in Budapest, Hungary, 13 July 1944, during World War II, and has lived all his life in Hungary. His father, Ern≈ë Rubik Sr., was a flight engineer at the Esztergom aircraft factory, and his mother, Magdolna Sz√°nt√≥, was a poet. He has stated in almost every interview that he got his inspiration from his father. His father, Ern≈ë Sr., was a highly respected engineer of gliders. His extensive work and expertise in this area gained him an international reputation as an expert in his field. Ern≈ë Rubik has stated that: Rubik studied sculpture at the Technical University in Budapest and architecture at the Academy of Applied Arts and Design, also in Budapest. While a professor of design at the academy, he pursued his hobby of building geometric models. One of these was a prototype of his cube, made of 27 wooden blocks; it took Rubik a month to solve the problem of the cube. It proved a useful tool for teaching algebraic group theory, and in late 1977 Konsumex, Hungary's state trading company, began marketing it. By 1980 Rubik's Cube was marketed throughout the world, and over 100 million authorized units, with an estimated 50 million unauthorized imitations, were sold, mostly during its subsequent three years of popularity. Approximately 50 books were published describing how to solve the puzzle of Rubik's Cube. Following his cube's popularity, Rubik opened a studio to develop designs in 1984; among its products was another popular puzzle toy, Rubik's Magic. =Education= From 1958 to 1962, Rubik specialised in sculpture at the Secondary School of Fine and Applied Arts. From 1962 to 1967, Rubik attended the Budapest University of Technology where he became a member of the Architecture Faculty. From 1967 to 1971, Rubik attended the Hungarian Academy of Applied Arts and was on the Faculty of Interior Architecture and Design. Rubik considers university and the education it afforded him as the decisive event which shaped his life. Rubik has stated that \\"Schools offered me the opportunity to acquire knowledge of subjects or rather crafts that need a lot of practice, persistence and diligence with the direction of a mentor.\\" Career =Early professorship and birth of Rubik's Cube= From 1971 to 1979, Rubik was a professor of architecture at the Budapest College of Applied Arts (Iparm≈±v√©szeti F≈ëiskola). It was during his time there that he built designs for a three-dimensional puzzle and completed the first working prototype of the Rubik's Cube in 1974, applying for a patent on the puzzle in 1975. In an interview with CNN, Rubik stated that he was \\"searching to find a good task for my students.\\"The little cube that changed the world Retrieved 2013-04-29. Rubik's Cube =From classroom tool to Magic Cube to Rubik's Cube= Starting with blocks of wood and rubber bands, Rubik set out to create a structure which would allow the individual pieces to move without the whole structure falling apart. Rubik originally used wood for the block because of the convenience of a workshop at the university and because he viewed wood as a simple material to work with that did not require sophisticated machinery. Rubik made the original prototypes of his cube by hand, cutting the wood, boring the holes and using elastic bands to hold the contraption together. Rubik showed his prototype to his class and his students liked it very much. Rubik realized that, because of the cube's simple structure, it could be manufactured relatively easily and might have appeal to a larger audience. Rubik's father possessed several patents, so Rubik was familiar with the process and applied for a patent for his invention. Rubik then set out to find a manufacturer in Hungary, but had great difficulty due to the rigid planned economy of Hungary at the time. Eventually, Rubik was able to find a small company that worked with plastic and made chess pieces. The cube was originally known in Hungary as the 'Magic Cube'. Rubik licensed the Magic Cube to Ideal Toys, a US company in 1979. Ideal rebranded The Magic Cube to the Rubik's Cube before its introduction to an international audience in 1980.Villapaz, Luke.\\"Rubik's Cube 40th Anniversary: 9 Facts Behind The Famous 3-D Toy Puzzle\\".International Business Times, 25 April 2014.

The Rubik's Cube would go on to become an instant success worldwide, winning several Toy of the Year awards, and becoming a staple of 1980's popular culture. To date, over 350 million Rubik's Cubes have been sold, making it one of the best selling toys of all time.\\"Rubik's Cube 25 years on: crazy toys, crazy times\\", Independent, 15 August 2007. =Other inventions= In addition to Rubik's Cube, Rubik is also the inventor of Rubik's Magic, Rubik's Snake and Rubik's 360 among others. =Later career and other works= In the early 1980s, he became the editor of a game and puzzle journal called ..√âs j√°t√©k (...And games), then became self-employed in 1983, founding the Rubik St√∫di√≥, where he designed furniture and games. In 1987 he became a professor with full tenure; in 1990 he became the president of the Hungarian Engineering Academy (Magyar M√©rn√∂ki Akad√©mia). At the Academy, he created the International Rubik Foundation to support especially talented young engineers and industrial designers. In 2009, he was appointed as an honorary professor of Keimyung University, Daegu, South Korea. Work and engagements in the 2010s In the 2010s, Rubik has recently spent much of his time working on Beyond Rubik's Cube, a Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics (STEM fields) based exhibition, which would travel the globe over the next six years.\\"Beyond Rubik's Cube\\" Liberty Science Center, N.D. Retrieved 6 May 2014 The grand opening of the exhibit was held on 26 April 2014 at the Liberty Science Center in New Jersey.

S√°nchez Vidal began working with defunct Spanish airline Spantax, acquiring his first model, a Convair CV-990 of that airline, in 1973. He made friendships with co-workers of other airlines, and he began receiving more models. Eventually, his hobby led him to meet some airline personalities, some of them famous celebrities, like Niki Lauda, Formula One champion and owner of Lauda Air. The largest model in his collection, a model of an Air France Airbus A320, was obtained after he traded one of his planes with a local Air France worker who also collects models. He also made a McDonnell Douglas MD-11 model of Air Europa, airline for which he works now. Air Europa never actually used this type of aircraft in real life.

Under the various iterations of the Constitution of Egypt following the Egyptian Revolution of 1952, the president is also the supreme commander of the Armed Forces, and head of the executive branch of the Egyptian government. The current president is Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, in office since 8 June 2014. History The first President of Egypt was Mohamed Naguib, who, along with Gamal Abdel Nasser, led the Egyptian Revolution of 1952 that overthrew King Farouk. Though Farouk's infant son was formally declared by the revolutionaries as King Fuad II, all effective executive power was vested in Naguib and the Revolutionary Command Council. On 18 June 1953, just under a year after the toppling of Farouk, the Council abolished the monarchy of Egypt and Sudan, and declared Egypt a republic, with Mohamed Naguib as president. Naguib resigned as president in November 1954, following a severe rift with the younger military officers who had participated with him in the revolution. Thereafter, the office of President remained vacant until January 1956, when Gamal Abdel Nasser was elected as president via a plebiscite. Nasser would remain as President of Egypt, and then President of the United Arab Republic, until his sudden death in September 1970 at the age of 52. Nasser was succeeded as president by his vice president, Anwar Sadat, elected by plebiscite in October 1970. Sadat served as president until his assassination in October 1981, after which his vice president, Hosni Mubarak, was elected president by plebiscite. In the Egyptian Revolution of 2011, Mubarak, who held office from 14 October 1981 until 11 February 2011, was forced to resign following mass nationwide protests demanding his removal from office. On 10 February 2011 Mubarak transferred presidential powers to his recently appointed vice president, Omar Suleiman. Suleiman's wielding of presidential powers was a momentary formality, as the position of President of Egypt was then officially vacated, and the Supreme Council of the Armed Forces, led by Field Marshal Mohamed Hussein Tantawi, assumed executive control of the state. On 30 June 2012, Mohamed Morsi was sworn in as President of Egypt, having won the 2012 Egyptian presidential election on 24 June. =Old electoral system= Presidential Standard, 1972‚Äì1984 The Egyptian Constitution has had various forms since the establishment of the republic in 1953. In all iterations of the republican constitution until 2005, the method of electing the President was based on that of the French Fifth Republic. Both the pre-revolution Egyptian Civil Code, and the semi-presidential system of government adopted after the revolution were strongly influenced by the legal and political tradition of France. In this two-stage system, the Egyptian legislature, the National Assembly (a name also inspired by its French counterpart), would nominate one of a number of candidates for the presidency. A candidate needed at least a two-thirds majority in the Assembly in order to win the nomination. In the second stage, the candidate was confirmed in office by popular plebiscite of all eligible voters in the country. Egypt maintained this system even after it was abandoned by France in 1962 in favour of direct presidential elections, eliminating the role of the legislature in the election of the French President. In the Egyptian Constitution of 1971, the name of the National Assembly was changed to the People's Assembly. =2005/2007 constitutional amendments= In 2005 and 2007, constitutional amendments were made. Principles in the amended constitution include: * Election of the president of the republic by direct secret ballot by citizens who have the right to vote. * Ensuring that multiple candidates be put forward for the people to choose from. * Ensuring the credibility of the nomination process. * Providing the opportunity for political parties to put forward one of their leaders to contest the first presidential elections to be held in light of the amendment. * The establishment of a presidential election commission that would enjoy complete independence to supervise the election process. * Carrying out the election in a single day. * Ensuring judicial supervision over the voting process. The following provisions regarding the election process are stipulated in Article 76 as amended: A successful candidate must be elected by the majority of the votes. If no candidate attains such a majority, elections will be repeated after at least seven days between the two candidates having the highest votes. In case of a tie between the candidate who attained the second highest votes and a third candidate, the third candidate shall participate in the second round. The candidate who receives the highest votes in the second round shall be declared president. The amendment also provides that a law will be passed to regulate the relevant election procedures. This law is expected to regulate the various aspects of the election process itself, including campaign funding, equal access to the media, and guarantees of fair competition. As required by the amendment, the law will be submitted to the Supreme Constitutional Court to opine on its constitutionality. This establishes an important precedent in Egypt's legal tradition, by which the Supreme Constitutional Court shall have the right of prior review of national legislation to decide on its compatibility with the Constitution. This differs from the practice thus far by which the review process undertaken by the Court on national legislation was done by judicial review subsequent to the passage of legislation. Presidential powers Under the system created by the 1980, 2003 and 2007 constitutional amendments to the 1971 Constitution, the President is the pre-eminent executive figure, who names the Prime Minister of Egypt as well as appoints the Cabinet per the latter's recommendation, while in reality, was the head of both the state and of the government, aside from being the top foreign policy maker and holding supreme command over the military. During martial law, the President also anoints deans of faculties and majors, and can also enlist or oust people in the private sector. He or she then also has the power to issue regulations for the enforcement of laws, ensuring proper public services, etc., which have been transferred to the Prime Minister under the 2012 and 2014 Constitutions. Egypt had been under martial law since 1981. After the Egyptian revolution in 2011 ‚Äì 2012, that ousted the 30-year regime of then President Hosni Mubarak, the martial law was suspended. The 2012 Constitution, provides for a semi- presidential form of government in which the President shares executive powers with the Prime Minister. This structure was retained under a new Constitution that was ratified on 2014, one year after a military coup ousted the country's first democratically elected president, Mohamed Morsi. Defense Minister and Field Marshal Abdel Fattah el-Sisi later suspended the 2012 Constitution. Sisi was elected President of Egypt under the 2014 Constitution, months after it was ratified. Under the present 2014 Constitution, the President is the head of state as well as that of the executive. He or she lays down, along with the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, the state's general policy and oversees its implementation, represents Egypt in foreign relations and has the power to ratify treaties, can issue decrees having the force of law when the House of Representatives is in recess and such decrees is subject for approval by the House after resuming its sessions at the end of the recess and acts as the supreme commander of the armed forces. He or she has also the power of pardon, and exercise necessary powers in times of emergencies. Requirements to hold office Article 141 of the Egyptian Constitution establishes the requirements one must meet in order to become president. The president of the republic should: be an Egyptian citizen, be born to Egyptian parents (never having dual nationality), have participated in the military or be exempted from it and cannot be less than 40 years old. Election Election procedures are taken before the end of the incumbent president's term by 60 days. Last Election =Candidacy= Additional requirements were provisioned in Article 142 of the Egyptian constitution concerning candidates for the president's office. * Candidates must have the recommendation of 20 members of the House of Representatives or the endorsement of 25,000 people across 15 governorates, with at least 1,000 signatures from each. Presidential campaign =Presidential Election Commission= The amendment to Article 76 of the constitution provides for the establishment of a ‚ÄúPresidential Election Commission‚Äù that would have complete independence, and would be charged with the supervision of the presidential election process. The commission will be composed of 10 members, presided by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Constitutional Court and four other ex officio members of the judiciary who are the most senior serving Deputy President of each of the Supreme Constitutional, the Court of Cassation, and the High Administrative Court, and the president of the Cairo Court of Appeal. The rest of the commission will be made up from five independent and neutral public figures: three to be selected by the Peoples Assembly and two to be selected by the Shoura Council. Decisions of this Committee shall be passed by a majority of seven votes. This commission will have a term of five years and will be exclusively competent to supervise the presidential election process, including accepting nominations, announcing the names of accepted candidates, supervision of election procedures, vote counting and announcement of the results. It will also have final judicial competence to rule on any contesting or challenge submitted in relation to the presidential elections, and its decision will be final and subject to no appeal. The committee will issue its own regulations and shall be competent to establish general sub-committees from among members of the judiciary, to monitor the various phases of the election process, under its supervision. The election process will be completed in one day. =Inauguration and oath of office= In accordance with Article 79 of the constitution, the president must take the following oath or affirmation before exercising his functions: \\"I swear by Allah The Almighty to sincerely maintain the Republican system, to respect the Constitution and law, to fully care about the interests of the people, and to maintain the independence and territorial integrity of the Homeland.\\" =Term(s) of office= Under the Constitution, the president serves for a term of four years. He is limited to two terms, whether successive or separated. For example, if incumbent President Sisi had been unsuccessful in his bid for reelection in 2018, he would have been eligible to run again in 2022, and if successful would have had to leave office for good in 2022. The Egyptian parliament voted overwhelmingly on Thursday 14 February 2019 to approve draft amendments to the country's 2013 constitution, putting an end to presidential term limits and potentially allowing incumbent President Abdel-Fattah el-Sissi to remain in office until 2034. These amendments were subsequently ratified in the 2019 Egyptian constitutional referendum. During his tenure in office, the president is not allowed to be a formal member of a political party. If the president- elect is announced before the end of the incumbent president's term, the incumbent president continues in office until the end of his term. =Succession= In the case of temporary incapacitation of the president, the constitution provides the president to relinquish his powers to the Vice President or the Prime Minister. However the person who takes office is limited in power as the new president can not dissolve the parliament, propose constitutional amendments or remove the cabinet from office. In case of the vacancy of the presidential office or the permanent incapacitation of the President, the Speaker of the People's Assembly shall temporarily assume the presidency. In case the People's Assembly is dissolved at such a time the President of the Supreme Constitutional Court shall take over the presidency on condition that neither shall nominate himself for the presidency. Both are also limited in power as in they can not dissolve the parliament, remove the cabinet, or propose constitutional amendments. The People's Assembly shall then proclaim the vacancy of the office of President, and a new president shall be chosen within a maximum period of sixty days from the date of the vacancy of the office. Although, the constitution does not directly stipulate any role for the vice president in the process of presidential succession, it had become a tradition for the People's Assembly to nominate a vice president for the vacant office of the president. Both Sadat and Mubarak served as vice- presidents at the time the presidential office became vacant, however on Mubarak's succession in 1981 as president he did not appoint a vice-president until 29 January 2011 when during substantial protests demanding reforms he appointed Omar Suleiman to the role. =Resignation= President Gamal Abdel Nasser submitted his resignation after the overwhelming Egyptian defeat in 1967 war with Israel, before returning to office after mass demonstrations by the Egyptian public.Aburish, Said. Nasser: The Last Arab. St. Martin's Press, 2004. pp.268‚Äì269 President Mubarak also resigned on 11 February 2011 after eighteen days of protest against his regime. The president may resign by delivering his resignation to the People's Assembly under the 2012 and 2014 Constitutions. =Official residences= The Presidency in Egypt controls 8 presidential residences in addition to other presidential guest houses. Egypt's official residence and office of the president is Heliopolis Palace in Cairo. Other presidential palaces include: * Abdeen Palace, in Old Cairo, Cairo. * Koubbeh Palace, in Cairo. * Ras Al-Teen Palace, in Alexandria * Montaza Palace, in Alexandria * Al-Tahra Palace, in Cairo * Al-Oroba Palace, in Cairo Living former presidents Following the deaths of Mohamed Morsi on 17 June 2019 and Hosni Mubarak on 25 February 2020, there are no living former presidents.

Categories of sport drinks Sports drinks can be split into three major types: *Isotonic sport drinks contain similar concentrations of salt and sugar as in the human body. *Hypertonic sport drinks contain a higher concentration of salt and sugar than the human body. *Hypotonic sport drinks contain a lower concentration of salt and sugar than the human body. Most sports drinks are approximately isotonic, having between 4 and 5 heaped teaspoons of sugar per eight ounce (13 and 19 grams per 250ml) serving. Purpose and effectiveness Athletes actively training and competing lose water and electrolytes by sweating, and expending energy. However, Robert Robergs, an exercise physiologist at the University of New Mexico who studied Gatorade, said that unless someone is exercising or competing in a sporting event for longer than 90 minutes, there is no reason to drink something with excess sugar and electrolytes. The Australian Institute of Sport states that excessive salt supplementation during exercise may lead to \\"gastrointestinal problems or cause further impairment of fluid balance\\" and may cause salt-induced cramps. Gatorade is a popular brand of sports drinks Sodium in drinks might help to avoid hyponatraemia (low sodium), but only after sustaining athletic activity for more than four hours; a sports drink containing sodium may be appropriate for recovery from intense and prolonged training or competition. A stated purpose of sports drinks, which provide many calories of energy from sugars, is to improve performance and endurance. In an analysis by Matthew Thompson and colleagues from the Oxford Centre for Evidence Based Medicine, of 431 marketing claims of performance enhancement, most cited no evidence. 174 sources were cited for GlaxoSmithKline's Lucozade; of them, Thompson found only three studies of high quality with a low risk of bias. The rigorous studies that did show improved endurance were \\"of limited relevance to most people because the tests were on elite athletes\\". Thompson said that, for the vast majority of people, drinking such products \\"could completely counteract exercising more, playing football more, going to the gym more\\". The drinks are marketed as soft drinks. In response to the Oxford analysis, a soft drinks industry spokesman claimed: \\"By helping people participating in sport to perform better and to recover more quickly, sports drinks can encourage people to exercise more\\". An effect of drinking sports drinks with carbohydrates without prolonged exercise is weight gain. A study presented at the Obesity Society's Obesity 2012 scientific meeting found people in their teens gained over two years for every bottle of sports drink consumed per day. The leading author of the study, Alison Field of Harvard Medical School, said she was surprised to find that \\"Sports drinks have an even stronger relationship than sugared sodas with weight gain\\".theheart.org: Sports drinks, not just sodas, drive up weight in teens, 24 September 2012 In August 2019, a study by University College London found that sports drinks were causing high amount of tooth decay in professional athletes because of high sugar content. Generally, sports drinks contain two-thirds the amount of sugar found in a normal soda. The sugar found in sports drinks still exceeds the recommended amount of sugar in a day for a child. Sports drinks advertise the electrolytes they contain, but the electrolytes do not matter if the body is already receiving the electrolyte from good nutrition. The purpose of electrolytes is to replenish the body with ions to carry throughout the body for muscle contractions and nerve impulses. Electrolytes are also a scientific term for \\"salts\\" and water is a better carrier for salts than any other liquid, so the effectiveness of what sports drinks advertise is unnecessary for normal bodily functions and may cause harm due to the high sugar content. History In the 19th and early 20th centuries, athletes occasionally drank beer of low alcohol content replenishing water, minerals and energy in the body. As the water is boiled during the brewing process and thus sterilized, the beer was a safer option than water from an unknown source. However, it is studied that even a low dose of ethanol decreases endurance performance: it inhibits liver glucose output during exercise, and also impairs psychomotor skills such as reaction time, hand-eye coordination and balance.

An ingot is a piece of relatively pure material, usually metal, that is cast into a shape suitable for further processing.Chalmers, p. 254. In steelmaking, it is the first step among semi-finished casting products. Ingots usually require a second procedure of shaping, such as cold/hot working, cutting, or milling to produce a useful final product. Non-metallic and semiconductor materials prepared in bulk form may also be referred to as ingots, particularly when cast by mold based methods. Precious metal ingots can be used as currency (with or without being processed into other shapes), or as a currency reserve, as with gold bars. Types Ingots are generally made of metal, either pure or alloy, heated past its melting point and cast into a bar or block using a mold chill method. A special case are polycrystalline or single crystal ingots made by pulling from a molten melt. =Single crystal= Single crystal ingots (called boules) of materials are grown (crystal growth) using methods such as the Czochralski process or Bridgeman technique. The boules may be either semiconductors (e.g. electronic chip wafers, photovoltaic cells) or non-conducting inorganic compounds for industrial and jewelry use (e.g., synthetic ruby, sapphire). Single crystal ingots of metal are produced in similar fashion to that used to produce high purity semiconductor ingots,Indium ingots , lesscommonmetals.com. i.e. by vacuum induction refining. Single crystal ingots of engineering metals are of interest due to their very high strength due to lack of grain boundaries. The method of production is via single crystal dendrite and not via simple casting. Possible uses include turbine blades. =Copper alloys= In the United States, the brass and bronze ingot making industry started in the early 19th century. The US brass industry grew to be the number one producer by the 1850s.Innovations: The History of Brass Making in the Naugatuck Valley. Copper.org (2010-08-25). Retrieved on 2012-02-24. During colonial times the brass and bronze industries were almost non-existent because the British demanded all copper ore be sent to Britain for processing.Innovations: Overview of Recycled Copper. Copper.org (2010-08-25). Retrieved on 2012-02-24. Copper based alloy ingots weighed approximately . Manufacture Crystalline structure of mold cast ingot Ingots are manufactured by the cooling of a molten liquid (known as the melt) in a mold. The manufacture of ingots has several aims. Firstly, the mold is designed to completely solidify and form an appropriate grain structure required for later processing, as the structure formed by the cooling of the melt controls the physical properties of the material. Secondly, the shape and size of the mold is designed to allow for ease of ingot handling and downstream processing. Finally the mold is designed to minimize melt wastage and aid ejection of the ingot, as losing either melt or ingot increases manufacturing costs of finished products. A variety of designs exist for the mold, which may be selected to suit the physical properties of the liquid melt and the solidification process. Molds may exist in top, horizontal or bottom-up pouring and may be fluted or flat walled. The fluted design increases heat transfer owing to a larger contact area. Molds may be either solid \\"massive\\" design, sand cast (e.g. for pig iron) or water- cooled shells, depending upon heat transfer requirements. Ingot molds are tapered to prevent the formation of cracks due to uneven cooling. Crack or void formation occurs as the liquid to solid transition has an associated volume change for a constant mass of material. Formation of these ingot defects may render the cast ingot useless, and may need to be re-melted, recycled or discarded. Teeming ingots at a steel mill The physical structure of a crystalline material is largely determined by the method of cooling and precipitation of the molten metal. During the pouring process, metal in contact with the ingot walls rapidly cools and forms either a columnar structure, or possibly a \\"chill zone\\" of equiaxed dendrites, depending upon the liquid being cooled and the cooling rate of the mold. For a top-poured ingot, as the liquid cools within the mold, differential volume effects cause the top of the liquid to recede leaving a curved surface at the mold top which may eventually be required to be machined from the ingot. The mold cooling effect creates an advancing solidification front, which has several associated zones, closer to the wall there is a solid zone which draws heat from the solidifying melt, for alloys there may exist a \\"mushy\\" zone, which is the result of solid-liquid equilibrium regions in the alloy's phase diagram, and a liquid region. The rate of front advancement controls the time that dendrites or nuclei have to form in the solidification region. The width of the mushy zone in an alloy may be controlled by tuning the heat transfer properties of the mold, or adjusting the liquid melt alloy compositions. Continuous casting methods for ingot processing also exist, whereby a stationary front of solidification is formed by the continual take-off of cooled solid material, and the addition of molten liquid to the casting process. Approximately 70 percent of aluminium ingots in the U.S. are cast using the direct chill casting process, which reduces cracking. A total of 5 percent of ingots must be scrapped because of stress induced cracks and butt deformation. Historical ingots Image:Minoan copper ingot from Zakros, Crete.jpgAncient copper oxhide ingot from Zakros, Crete.

A love ballad, it was written by Paul McCartney and credited to Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney. McCartney includes it among his personal favourites of all the songs he has written. In 2000, Mojo ranked it 4th in the magazine's list of the greatest songs of all time. The Beatles recorded \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\" in June 1966, towards the end of the sessions for Revolver. Having recently attended a listening party for the Beach Boys' Pet Sounds album, McCartney drew inspiration from Brian Wilson's song \\"God Only Knows\\". Inspiration and background When discussing his song \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\", Paul McCartney has often cited Brian Wilson's \\"God Only Knows\\" as his main source of inspiration. The latter track appeared on the Beach Boys' 1966 album Pet Sounds and was itself inspired by Wilson repeatedly listening to the Beatles' Rubber Soul album. On 17 May 1966, the day after the new Beach Boys album had been released in America, McCartney and John Lennon attended a private listening party for Pet Sounds held at London's Waldorf Hotel. In 1990, McCartney told Beach Boys biographer David Leaf that it was \\"just the introduction that's influenced [by the Beach Boys]\\", referring to the harmonies he and Lennon devised for the opening lines of \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\". McCartney added that, with this style of introduction, they wanted to capture the \\"old-fashioned\\" idea of a preamble to the song. McCartney began writing \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\" at Lennon's house in Weybridge, in early June, while waiting for Lennon to wake up. McCartney recalled: \\"I sat out by the pool on one of the sun chairs with my guitar and started strumming in E. And soon [I] had a few chords, and I think by the time he'd woken up, I had pretty much written the song, so we took it indoors and finished it up.\\" Musical structure Author Kenneth Womack describes \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\" as a romantic ballad \\"about living in the here and now\\" and \\"fully experiencing the conscious moment\\". The verse is based on an ascending major chord sequence, while the middle eight (being 4 bars in fact), which modulates to the relative major of the tonic ‚Äì if it had been minor, creates a telling contrast. The introduction beginning \\"To lead a better life\\" opens in the key of G and involves a I‚Äìiii‚ÄìIII‚Äìii‚ÄìV7 chord progression. The III (B chord) on \\"I need my love to be here\\" (arpeggiated in the melody line) is a dissonant substitute for the more predictable VI (E7) that would normally lead to the ii (Am) chord. Music critic Richie Unterberger considers that this \\"dramatic opening [lyric]\\" contains \\"an almost philosophical undertone of humility, acknowledging that the singer needs his woman not just to be happy, but also to be a better person\\". The verse opens strongly anchored on \\"Here\\" in the key of G (with simultaneous I (G chord) and melody G note) and moves equally predictably to a I‚Äìii‚Äìiii‚ÄìIV chord shift (G‚ÄìAm‚ÄìBm‚ÄìC) through \\"making each day of the year\\". This repeats on \\"Changing my life with a wave\\"; but immediately after (in bar 5) the song indeed changes on \\"of her hand\\". It goes down six semitones from the IV (C chord) to a vii (Fm) [adding a non-G scale C#] then a V-of-vi (B7) chord [adding a non-G scale D] which briefly modulates towards a new tonic E minor. McCartney mostly sings a B note (\\"of her hand\\") over both Fm, where it is the eleventh, and the B7, where it is the tonic. When the sequence is repeated (\\"nobody can\\"), McCartney sings both B and C over the Fm, the C natural producing a tritone. The harmonic fascination with the bridge segment beginning \\"I want her everywhere\\" is that at that point the key centre does go \\"everywhere\\". It shifts via an F7 chord (a VII in the old G key and a V7 in the new B key) to a I‚Äìvi‚Äìii (B‚ÄìGm‚ÄìCm) chord progression in B major. It then shifts again via a D7 chord (a III7 in the old B key and a V7 in the new Gm key) to G minor where we go through a i‚Äìiv (Gm‚ÄìCm chord) progression. Finally the pivot of D7 takes us back to the G major tonic and reinforcing G melody note of \\"Everywhere\\". Rolling Stone has noted: \\"The tune's chord sequence bears Brian Wilson's influence, ambling through three related keys without ever fully settling into one, and the modulations ‚Äì particularly the one on the line 'changing my life with a wave of her hand' ‚Äì deftly underscore the lyrics, inspired by McCartney's girlfriend, actress Jane Asher.\\" Recording The Beatles recorded \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\" towards the end of the sessions for their 1966 album Revolver. The band worked on the song at Abbey Road Studios over three session dates ‚Äì on 14, 16 and 17 June. Before carrying out overdubs, they taped 13 takes before achieving a satisfactory basic track. The recording is noted for its layered backing vocals, which McCartney, Lennon and George Harrison spent much of the three days attempting to perfect. McCartney mentioned in the 1989 radio series McCartney on McCartney that the vocals were meant to have a Beach Boys sound; he has also said that he was trying to sing it in the style of Marianne Faithfull. McCartney's lead vocal on the recording is multi-tracked. In his book Revolution in the Head, Ian MacDonald also comments on Harrison's lead guitar part being given a mandolin-like tone via a Leslie speaker effect, before it adopts a \\"horn-like timbre\\" for the song's ending. Release and reception \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\" was released in August 1966 as the fifth track on Revolver, sequenced between Harrison's Indian-styled \\"Love You To\\", and the children's song \\"Yellow Submarine\\". Writing of its positioning in the running order, music critic Tim Riley says that \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\" \\"domesticates\\" the \\"eroticisms\\" of \\"Love You To\\", and he praises the composition as \\"the most perfect song\\" that McCartney had ever written. In his review for AllMusic, Richie Unterberger describes \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\" as one of its author's \\"outstanding contribution[s]\\" to the genre of \\"love ballads\\", and a song with \\"the sound of an instant standard\\". Unterberger comments on the recording: \\"The delicacy of the execution is exquisite, the sensual imagery more explicit, the sense of desire and fulfillment tangible.\\" Less impressed, Ian MacDonald admired the \\"ingenuity of the music\\", but concluded that \\"for all its soft-focus charm, the song's overall effect is chintzy and rather cloying.\\" In his chapter on Revolver in the book The Album, James Perone describes \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\" as a \\"mid 1960s love ballad that could find its way into the set list for bands at a senior prom\\" and a track that to some listeners appears \\"syrupy and mushy\\". Chris Coplan of Consequence of Sound pairs it with \\"Got to Get You into My Life\\" as songs that are \\"seemingly out of place\\" on Revolver amid the overtly psychedelic and experimental music that typifies the album. In his authorised biography, Many Years from Now, McCartney names \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\" as one of his personal favourites. Beatles producer George Martin also highlighted it among his favourite McCartney songs. Lennon reportedly told McCartney that \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\" was \\"the best tune\\" on Revolver. In a 1980 interview for Playboy magazine, Lennon described it as \\"one of my favourite songs of the Beatles\\". In 2000, Mojo placed \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\" at number 4 on its list of the greatest songs of all time. In April 2004, Rolling Stone ranked it 25th out of the \\"100 Greatest Beatles Songs\\". Art Garfunkel has cited this as his all-time favourite pop song. Cover versions Unterberger highlights Emmylou Harris among the notable artists who have recorded \\"Here, There and Everywhere\\". Harris' version became a minor hit in 1976, reaching number 65 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 13 on the Adult Contemporary chart in the United States. Other noted performers of the song include Beegie Adair, Clay Aiken, David Benoit, George Benson, Gina Jeffreys on Old Paint, Peter Breinholt, Petula Clark, Perry Como, Count Basie Orchestra, Darren Day, John Denver, Romina Power, C√©line Dion (for a George Martin/Beatles tribute album), Arik Einstein, Episode Six, Matt Monro, Jose Feliciano (instrumental), The Fourmost, Jerry Garcia and Merl Saunders (instrumental), Bobbie Gentry, St√©phane Grappelli, Ofra Harnoy, The Flying Pickets, Jay and the Americans, The Lettermen, Locksley, Kenny Loggins (on Kenny Loggins Alive), Claudine Longet, John McDermott, Carmen McRae, Olivia Ong, Maaya Sakamoto, George Shearing, The Singers Unlimited, Sissel, G√∂ran S√∂llscher, Marina Verenikina, Jose Mari Chan, Camilo Sesto, John Williams (instrumental),Classic Guitar Greatest Hits CD Andy Williams, David Gilmour, Umberto Tozzi and Boulou Ferr√© (on Pour Django, instrumental). Bruce Welch of The Shadows claimed in his autobiography that McCartney offered the tune to Shadows lead guitarist Hank Marvin before the Beatles' recording. Marvin eventually released an instrumental version of the song on his 2007 album Guitar Man. Frank Ocean references the line \\"Spending each day of the year\\" on White Ferrari, even giving Lennon-McCartney songwriter's credit. In popular culture In the TV series Friends, this song is played on steel drums when Phoebe Buffay walks down the aisle during her wedding. It was the second time a song written by McCartney was used in a wedding sequence in the series, the first being \\"My Love\\" when Chandler and Monica married. Gary Sparrow sings the song at the piano in an episode of Goodnight Sweetheart. Geoff Emerick, who engineered many of the Beatles' recordings, used the title of the song for his 2006 memoir Here, There, and Everywhere: My Life Recording the Music of The Beatles.

John Lennon said of the song, \\"One of my favourites of his--a nice piece of work.\\" Writing and recording McCartney recalls writing \\"For No One\\" in the bathroom of a ski resort in the Swiss Alps while on holiday with his then girlfriend Jane Asher. He said, \\"I suspect it was about another argument.\\" The lyrics end enigmatically with \\"...a love that should have lasted years...\\" The song's working title was \\"Why Did It Die?\\" It is built upon a descending scale progression with a refrain that modulates to the supertonic minor. The song was recorded on 9, 16 and 19 May 1966. McCartney sang and played clavichord (rented from George Martin's AIR company), piano and bass guitar, while Ringo Starr played drums, tambourine and maracas.http://www.the-paulmccartney-project.com/song/for-no-one/ John Lennon and George Harrison did not contribute to the recording. The French horn solo was by Alan Civil, a British horn player described by recording engineer Geoff Emerick as the \\"best horn player in London\\". During the session, McCartney pushed Civil to play a note that was beyond the usual range of the instrument. According to Emerick, the result was the \\"performance of his life.\\" Civil said that the song was \\"recorded in rather bad musical style, in that it was 'in the cracks', neither B-flat nor B-major. This posed a certain difficulty in tuning my instrument.\\" Reception Thomas Ward of AllMusic describes \\"For No One\\" as \\"one of Paul McCartney's great ballads with the Beatles,\\" writing that it is \\"a simply beautiful song, full of idiosyncratic McCartney touches yet undeniably inspired.\\" Ward praises McCartney's vocal performance and calls the song's melody \\"one of the most inspired of the singer's whole career.\\" Ward also praises the bass line and French horn solo, concluding his review by calling the song \\"one of the most delicate and fine ballads of the Beatles entire canon.\\" Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone praised McCartney's songwriting on Revolver, writing \\"[his songs] have a new caustic realism.\\" Sheffield called \\"For No One\\" the \\"ultimate 'you stay home, she goes out' break-up song.\\" Personnel *Paul McCartney ‚Äì vocals, bass guitar, piano, clavichord *Ringo Starr ‚Äì drums, tambourine, maracas *Alan Civil ‚Äì French horn :Personnel per Ian MacDonald Notes References   External links * Category:The Beatles songs Category:Baroque pop songs Category:Pop ballads Category:Song recordings produced by George Martin Category:Songs written by Lennon‚ÄìMcCartney Category:Songs published by Northern Songs Category:Cilla Black songs Category:1966 songs Category:1960s ballads ","title":"For No One"},{"id":"335373","text":"Kathleen Hanna (born November 12, 1968) is an American singer, musician, artist, feminist activist, pioneer of the feminist punk riot grrrl movement, and punk zine writer. In the early-to-mid-1990s she was the lead singer of feminist punk band Bikini Kill, before fronting Le Tigre in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Since 2010, she has recorded as The Julie Ruin. A documentary film about Hanna was released in 2013 by director Sini Anderson, titled The Punk Singer, detailing Hanna's life and career, as well as revealing her years-long battle with Lyme disease. Hanna is married to Adam Horovitz of the Beastie Boys. Life and career =1968‚Äì88: Early life and feminism= Hanna was born November 12, 1968, in Portland, Oregon. At age four, her family moved to Calverton, Maryland; as Hanna's father changed occupations, the family moved several more times. Hanna first became interested in feminism around the age nine, after her mother took her to a rally in Washington D.C. where feminist icon Gloria Steinem spoke. In a 2000 interview with BUST magazine, Hanna recalled: \\"My mom was a housewife, and wasn't somebody that people would think of as a feminist, and when Ms. magazine came out we were incredibly inspired by it. I used to cut pictures out of it and make posters that said 'Girls can do anything', and stuff like that, and my mom was inspired to work at a basement of a church doing anti-domestic violence work. Then she took me to the Solidarity Day thing, and it was the first time I had ever been in a big crowd of women yelling, and it really made me want to do it forever.\\" Hanna's interest grew when her mother checked out a copy of Betty Friedan's The Feminine Mystique from the library. Their involvement in the women's rights movement was done quietly during Hanna's childhood, due to her father's disapproval.\\"Don't Need You: The Herstory of Riot Grrrl\\", 2006, Kerri Koch Upon her parents' divorce, Hanna returned to Portland and attended Lincoln High School. After high school, she relocated from Portland to Olympia, Washington to attend The Evergreen State College in the late 1980s. During this time she worked as a stripper to pay her tuition. \\"My parents didn't go to college. I felt lucky [to attend].\\" While at Evergreen, with fellow student and photographer Aaron Baush-Greene, she set up a photo exhibit featuring the pair's photography, which dealt with sexism, violence against women, and AIDS-- issues that were heightened for Hanna when she volunteered for SafePlace, a domestic violence organization. However, the school administrators took the photos down before they had the chance to be viewed, an act of censorship that prompted what Hanna refers to as her \\"first foray into activism\\": the creation of Reko Muse, an independent feminist art gallery, with friends Heidi Arbogast and Tammy Rae Carland. Hanna began doing spoken word performances that addressed sexism and violence against women. Eventually she abandoned spoken word in favor of music after a conversation with one of her favorite writers, countercultural icon Kathy Acker. Hanna recalled, Hanna then formed a band with Arbogast and Carland, called Amy Carter, which put on shows before the art exhibitions. =1989‚Äì99: Bikini Kill= Hanna performing with Bikini Kill in 1991 Later, Hanna started another band called Viva Knievel that toured the United States for two months before disbanding. Upon returning to Olympia, Hanna began collaborating with Evergreen student and punk zinester Tobi Vail after seeing a performance of The Go-Team (a band made up of Vail, Billy Karren, and Calvin Johnson) and recognizing Vail as the mastermind behind the fanzine Jigsaw, which Hanna greatly admired and loved. The band, named Bikini Kill, soon became part of the seminal Olympia, Washington music scene of the early 1990s. One goal of the band was to inspire more women to join the male-dominated punk rock scene. The band's first release for the Kill Rock Stars label was a self-titled EP produced by Ian MacKaye of Fugazi. Bikini Kill then toured the UK, recording a split LP with UK band Huggy Bear. This tour was filmed and the band was interviewed by Lucy Thane for her documentary, It Changed My Life: Bikini Kill In The UK. Upon returning to the U.S., the band began working with Joan Jett, who produced their single, \\"New Radio/Rebel Girl\\". After the release of this record, Hanna began co-writing some songs with Jett for her new album. At the same time Hanna produced several solo pieces for the Kill Rock Stars \\"Wordcore\\" series of recordings, including the 7\\" single \\"Rockstar\\" and the song \\"I Wish I Was Him\\" (a song written by Ben Lee and originally recorded by his band Noise Addict about alternative rock heartthrob Evan Dando) on the KRS compilation Rock Stars Kill. Kathleen Hanna performing with Bikini Kill, 1996 The first two Bikini Kill EPs were released on CD as The C.D. Version of the First Two Records in 1993. The band released two more full-length albums, Pussy Whipped in 1994 and Reject All American in 1996, and in 1998, Kill Rock Stars released Bikini Kill: The Singles, a collection of the group's seven inch and compilation tracks. Bikini Kill amicably disbanded in mid-1998. =2000‚Äìpresent: Le Tigre, the Julie Ruin= After Bikini Kill's breakup, Hanna began working on a solo project called Julie Ruin. The project was created entirely in Hanna's bedroom using a $40 drum machine. One self-titled album was released under the Julie Ruin pseudonym, and was partially inspired by the work of feminist theorist Julia Kristeva. Hanna said of the project: While in Portland, Oregon, Hanna began working with friend and zine editor Johanna Fateman on a live show for Julie Ruin. The collaboration resulted in the two briefly forming a band called the Troublemakers, named after a G. B. Jones film, which ended when Fateman relocated to New York City to attend art school. Hanna soon moved to New York City as well, and with the addition of filmmaker Sadie Benning, they started another band called Le Tigre. Le Tigre was based upon a more electronic style of music, similar to the sampler-driven sound Hanna had begun to explore with Julie Ruin. Hanna refers to it as part of a \\"Punk Feminist Electronic genre\\". The band recorded for the Mr. Lady Records label, its first recording being an eponymous album which included the singles \\"Hot Topic\\" and \\"Deceptacon.\\" Benning then left the band and was replaced by JD Samson for their second album, Feminist Sweepstakes. Mr. Lady Records folded, and the group switched to Universal Records for the 2004 release of This Island. Hanna left the band in 2005 due to illness; she was later diagnosed with late stage Lyme disease. According to the Le Tigre website, during her time off from the band, Hanna volunteered as a band coach for the Willie Mae Rock and Roll Camp for Girls. She also taught an art class at NYU's grad school in the Fall 2007 semester and attended interior design classes. In 2010, Hanna DJed at the Museum of Modern Art, later joining the Raincoats on stage to cover the Slits' Vindictive. Also in 2010, Hanna announced she was rebuilding her 1997 act Julie Ruin, turning it into a full band called The Julie Ruin with Kenny Mellman and Kathi Wilcox, and that they would be creating a new record. The band played their first show at Knitting Factory in New York City. The show included songs from Bikini Kill and Le Tigre, and one new composition. From 2010 to 2013, director Sini Anderson worked on a documentary on Kathleen Hanna titled The Punk Singer, documenting her works from Bikini Kill to the Julie Ruin. It premiered at SXSW in 2013. In June 2013, Julie Ruin released its first single, \\"Oh Come On\\". An album, Run Fast was released in September 2013 with the band going on tour. The Julie Ruin cancelled the tour planned for May to September 2014 due to Hanna's Lyme disease condition deteriorating. She has since recovered and begun performing again. The Julie Ruin's second album, Hit Reset, was published on July 2016 by Hardly Art. Activism and impact Hanna's outspoken feminism has always influenced her work. She became a voice for third-wave feminism and the Riot Grrrl movement in 1991. In 1991, Bikini Kill spent the summer in Washington, D.C., where Hanna began collaborating with Allison Wolfe, Molly Neuman, and Jen Smith from the band Bratmobile on the zine Riot grrrl, which became a call to action for young women to embrace feminism and equal female involvement in the punk rock scene.

The Bikini Kill Zine, which began in 1991, was born from this, along with the desire to present \\"feminist issues through a punk rock lens.\\" By Issue Two, the Riot Grrrl Manifesto was born, urging women to defy society's expectations upon them as women, and to form a collective for women to freely discuss current issues. While Hanna never sought nor intended to become the spokeswoman for Riot Grrl, she hoped that it would provide a voice for issues that are relevant to women on local, national, and global levels.Hanna, Kathleen, and Melissa Klein. \\"RIOT GRRRLS.\\" Off Our Backs 23.2 (1993) 6-12. Web. At Bikini Kill concerts, Hanna would ask women to move to the front of the stage to avoid harassment from males, as part of her idea of \\"girls to the front' or \\"Revolution Girl Style Now.\\" In a mostly male-dominated punk rock scene where shows often turned violent because of mosh pits (where women were often assaulted), Hanna wanted space for women to be able to feel safe. Additionally, with a barrier of girls in the front rows, she too could feel safe and supported at her own shows, where male hecklers were constantly present. Her feminist contributions to punk music are also evident in her lyrics. In an interview with Nicole Brodeur from The Seattle Times, it is said that, \\"Hanna's lyrics were about girls who did and wore what they wanted, despite societal expectations.\\" Hanna: \\"It doesn't mean you're not a feminist because you expose your legs.\\" She zeroed in on the idea that women should have the ability to express themselves in any way they please, without backlash, and her performances regularly reflected such themes. Bradeur: \\"Hanna exposed her breasts and rear-end with lust-killing bluntness; she wore a girlish ponytail and danced around with 'slut' written in lipstick across her midriff.\\" In 1991, Hanna performed with Bikini Kill (alongside Fugazi) at the Pro-Choice Rally at the National Mall in Washington, D.C. before the Planned Parenthood v. Casey trial. Having had an abortion herself at 15, Hanna said: \\"It's about women not dying in back-alley abortions, but it's also about women saying: 'My life is worth it, too. I deserve to have control over my life and my health care.' Imagine if a man was told, 'You can't make the decision to have a vasectomy.'\\" Hanna also spoke at the 2011 Planned Parenthood \\"Stand Up for Women's Health\\" Rally. During her speech, she told her story of when she was 19 years old, on tour, and broke. She had acquired an infection, was extremely ill, and walked into a Planned Parenthood clinic for help. Despite having less than $10 in her pocket, she was \\"met with open arms\\" at the clinic, was treated with respect, and received medical care. Hanna contributed the piece \\"Gen X Survivor: From Riot Grrrl Rock Star to Feminist Artist\\" to the 2003 anthology Sisterhood Is Forever: The Women's Anthology for a New Millennium, edited by Robin Morgan. The riot grrrl genre, to which Hanna was central, has been credited as a historical site for the empowerment of women by such documentaries as The Punk Singer, which credits Hanna with having molded many tenets of third-wave feminism. In 2009, the Fales Library at New York University created a Riot Grrrl Collection. This collection focuses on the early formation of the Riot Grrrl movement, and has a series of zines, art pieces, photography, video, music, journals, and more. Some of Hanna's solo work, along with zines that she has created with Bikini Kill and other collaborators are also included. In a 2014 interview with Amy Middleton of Australian webzine Archer, Hanna stated that she supported marriage equality. Hanna also noted that while on tour with Le Tigre, she met teenagers who had told her of starting LGBT groups and gay/straight alliances in their high schools; she said, \\"Hearing that made me feel so hopeful for the future\\". In the same interview, Hanna stated she was saddened by trans- exclusionary feminist movements, and appeared to support transfeminism. Previously, critics had suggested Hanna was trans-exclusionary for having performed at the Michigan Womyn's Music Festival in 2001 and 2005, which had a policy of exclusively allowing \\"womyn-born-womyn\\" into the event. In 2018, Hanna started \\"Tees 4 Togo\\", a project which sells t-shirts with drawings of Hanna's friends such as Kim Gordon, Patton Oswalt, Joan Jett, and Chuck D, along with artists such as Sarah Larnach, Adee Roberson, and Hannah Lucy. 100% of the proceeds go to the non-profit Peace Sisters, which helps fund local girls' school tuition costs in Dapaong, Togo. The cost of one $40 shirt funds an entire school year for a student. Personal life In 2006, Hanna married Adam Horovitz of the Beastie Boys in a civil ceremony in Hawaii, after being a couple for nine years. The songs \\"Capri Pants\\" by Bikini Kill and \\"Just My Kind\\" by The Julie Ruin are written about her relationship with Horovitz. Hanna suffered from Lyme disease for six years before it was correctly diagnosed. The disease forced her to enter a three-month course of treatment in 2014, resulting in canceling live performances with her band the Julie Ruin. By June 2015, tests revealed that she was Lyme-free. In popular culture * Hanna unintentionally came up with the name for Nirvana's 1991 breakthrough single \\"Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" by writing \\"Kurt Smells Like Teen Spirit\\" on Kurt Cobain's wall. At the time, Cobain was unaware that Hanna was referring to a deodorant marketed specifically to young women, and thought that the phrase would anchor the song's theme. * The NOFX song \\"Kill Rock Stars,\\" from the album So Long and Thanks for All the Shoes, is written about Hanna, referencing her by name: \\"Kill the rockstars? How ironic, Kathleen. You've been crowned the newest queen.\\" The song's title is a reference to independent label Kill Rock Stars. *Hanna appears in the music video for Sonic Youth's song \\"Bull in the Heather\\". *Hanna is featured in a monologue at the end of the song \\"Heartbeat\\" on Mike Watt's album Ball-Hog or Tugboat?.http://www.hootpage.com/hoot_wrestlingandkathleen.html *Hanna is referenced in an Idles' song Mr. Motivator.

BellSouth was one of the seven original Regional Bell Operating Companies after the U.S. Department of Justice forced the American Telephone & Telegraph Company to divest itself of its regional telephone companies on January 1, 1984. In a merger announced on March 5, 2006, and executed on December 29, 2006, AT&T; Inc. (originally SBC Communications) acquired BellSouth for approximately $86 billion (1.325 shares of AT&T; for each share of BellSouth). The merger also consolidated ownership of Cingular Wireless and Yellowpages.com, both of which were joint ventures between BellSouth and AT&T.; With the merger completed, wireless services previously offered by Cingular Wireless were then offered under the AT&T; name, and BellSouth Telecommunications (a subsidiary of Bell Operating Company) began doing business as AT&T; Southeast. The company became known as BellSouth, LLC on June 26, 2015. BellSouth was the last of the Regional Bell Operating Companies to keep its original corporate name after the 1984 AT&T; breakup, as well as the last one to retain the Bell logo as part of its main corporate identity. BellSouth also operated in Argentina, Australia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, Guatemala, New Zealand, Nicaragua, Panama, Peru, Uruguay and Venezuela. BellSouth operated in New Zealand under the name of BellSouth New Zealand Limited from 1993 until 1998 when it was acquired by Vodafone to become Vodafone New Zealand.http://www.vodafone.co.nz/about/#history Vodafone acquires BellSouth NZ It competed against Telecom New Zealand. Its operations in Australia were under the name of BellSouth Australia Pty Limited. All of Bellsouth's operations in Latin America were acquired by Telefonica in late 2004 for nearly $5.85 billion. Organization and services As part of the breakup of the old AT&T; during 1984, BellSouth was formed as the holding company for the telephone operating companies in the southern portion of the old Bell System‚ÄîAtlanta-based Southern Bell and Birmingham, Alabama-based South Central Bell. The creation of BellSouth, in effect, reunited most telephone service in the Southeastern United States. Southern Bell had been the Bell System operating company for the entire Southeast until 1967, when the western portion of its service territory became South Central Bell. BellSouth formed a shared services company, BellSouth Services, to provide centralized functions such as engineering and information technology to Southern Bell and South Central Bell. Services provided in the BellSouth operating area include telephone and DSL/Dial-Up Internet services in the states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee. Satellite television service was provided as a partnership with DirecTV. Cable television (often via MMDS) was provided in limited markets as BellSouth Entertainment (as part of the Americast venture). The company maintained its largest operation centers in Atlanta and Birmingham. Region-wide headquarters operations were also primarily in Atlanta and Birmingham. Statewide operations centers were located in Birmingham, Miami, Atlanta, Louisville, New Orleans, Jackson, Charlotte, Columbia, and Nashville. BellSouth Mobility was based in Atlanta, Georgia and Birmingham, Alabama. In August 1998, BellSouth launched FastAccess DSL, their broadband service provided through a DSL connection, initially launched in the Atlanta, Birmingham, Charlotte, Miami/Ft. Lauderdale, Jacksonville, New Orleans and Raleigh/Durham areas. Eventually, it became available in all of BellSouth's service area. Toward its end, BellSouth realigned itself in two important areas, wireless and broadband. In 2001, they merged BellSouth Mobility, their wireless enterprise, with SBC's wireless services, and took 40% stake in the resulting company, Cingular Wireless. The new company provided a large percentage of BellSouth's revenue. This joint venture continued after SBC purchased the old AT&T; and rebranded as AT&T; Inc. Continued increase of broadband penetration and applications in the consumer market was a key strategy to the company. These activities were being funded in part by the sale of Latin America operations. BellSouth became the first \\"Baby Bell\\" that did not operate pay telephones. By 2003, BellSouth's payphone operation was discontinued because it had become too unprofitable, most likely due to the increased availability of cell phones. Cincinnati Bell has taken BellSouth's place for payphones in northern BellSouth territory; independents have set in further south. BellSouth's main operating units at its end were the Communications Group, Domestic Wireless, and Advertising and Publishing. The communications group operated two wholly owned subsidiaries, BellSouth Telecommunications Inc. (BST) and BellSouth Long Distance, Inc. (BSLD). The main marketing groups for the communications group were consumer, small business, large business, and interconnection (wholesale services). The communications group provided wireline communications services, including local exchange, network access, intraLATA long-distance services, and Internet services, as well as long-distance services. The advertising and publishing group was responsible for printing and distributing telephone books, selling advertising, and operating online electronic directories. The BellSouth ‚Äì SBC/AT&T; relationship went further than just Cingular Wireless. BellSouth & SBC/AT&T; also co-owned yellowpages.com (formerly RealPages.com and SmartPages.com).

Any incoming call originating from a Sprint PCS cell phone will usually display the City, State format on the caller ID display instead of the name or business name associated with that number. Based on a 1996 agreement between Sprint and BellSouth, it is likely that this is a result of a ten-year contract. In 2003, Sprint sued BellSouth for $20 million as a result of Sprint claiming Bellsouth violated a 1996 contract by not providing Sprint caller-identification information to BellSouth customers.Atlanta Business Chronicle: December 17, 2003-Sprint sues BellSouth over caller ID, atlanta.bizjournals.com Similar caller ID \\"deals\\" have been left to the consumer to fight either with their own carrier or through government regulatory commissions for what they should have displayed on their caller ID device.

Biography Josef Albers, Rosa mystica ora pro nobis, 1918 (reconstruction, original destroyed 1944) = German years =  Formative years in Westphalia  Albers was born into a Roman Catholic family of craftsmen in Bottrop, Westphalia, Germany in 1888. His father, Lorenzo Albers, was variously a housepainter, carpenter, and handyman. His mother came from a family of blacksmiths. His childhood included practical training in engraving glass, plumbing, and wiring, giving Josef versitility and lifelong confidence in the handling and manipulation of diverse materials. Retrieved 2020-03-29 Retrieved 2020-03-29 He worked from 1908 to 1913 as a schoolteacher in his home town; he also trained as an art teacher at K√∂nigliche Kunstschule in Berlin, Germany, from 1913 to 1915. From 1916 to 1919 he began his work as a printmaker at the Kunstgewerbschule in Essen, where he learnt stained-glass making with Dutch artist Johan Thorn Prikker.de Melo, M. (2019) Mosaic as an Experimental System in Contemporary Fine Art Practice and Criticism. PhD Thesis: University for the Creative Arts; University of Brighton, p.111 In 1918 he received his first public commission, Rosa mystica ora pro nobis, a stained-glass window for a church in Essen. In 1919 he moved to Munich, Germany, to study at the K√∂nigliche Bayerische Akademie der Bildenden Kunst, where he was a pupil of Max Doerner and Franz Stuck.Josef Albers Crystal Bridges Museum of American Art, Bentonville.  Entry into the Bauhaus Albers enrolled as a student in the preliminary course (vorkurs) of Johannes Itten at the Weimar Bauhaus in 1920. Although Albers had studied painting, it was as a maker of stained glass that he joined the faculty of the Bauhaus in 1922, approaching his chosen medium as a component of architecture and as a stand-alone art form.Holland Cotter (July 26, 2012), Harmony, Harder Than It Looks ‚Äì ‚ÄòJosef Albers in America: Painting on Paper,‚Äô at the Morgan The New York Times. The director and founder of the Bauhaus, Walter Gropius, asked him in 1923 to teach in the preliminary course 'Werklehre' of the department of design to introduce newcomers to the principles of handicrafts, because Albers came from that background and had appropriate practice and knowledge. In 1925, the year the Bauhaus moved to Dessau, Albers was promoted to professor. At this time, he married Anni Albers (n√©e Fleischmann) who was a student at the institution. His work in Dessau included designing furniture and working with glass. As a younger instructor, he was teaching at the Bauhaus among established artists who included Oskar Schlemmer, Wassily Kandinsky, and Paul Klee. The so-called \\"form master\\" Klee taught the formal aspects in the glass workshops where Albers was the \\"crafts master\\"; they cooperated for several years. =Emigration to the United States= Black Mountain College With the closure of the Bauhaus under Nazi pressure in 1933 the artists dispersed, most leaving the country. Albers emigrated to the United States. The architect Philip Johnson, then a curator at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City, arranged for Albers to be offered a job as head of a new art school, Black Mountain College, in North Carolina.Pepe Carmel (June 25, 1995), A Modern Master of Bottles, Scraps and Squares The New York Times. In November 1933, he joined the faculty of the college where he was the head of the painting program until 1949. At Black Mountain, his students included Ruth Asawa, Ray Johnson, Robert Rauschenberg, Cy Twombly, and Susan Weil. He also invited important American artists such as Willem de Kooning, to teach in the summer seminar. Weil remarked that, as a teacher, Albers was \\"his own academy\\". She said that Albers claimed that \\"when you're in school, you're not an artist, you're a student\\", although he was very supportive of self-expression when one became an artist and began on her or his journey. Albers produced many woodcuts and leaf studies at this time. Yale University Josef Albers, Proto-Form (B), oil on fiberboard, 1938, Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden In 1950, Albers left Black Mountain to head the department of design at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut. While at Yale, Albers worked to expand the nascent graphic design program (then called \\"graphic arts\\"), hiring designers Alvin Eisenman, Herbert Matter, and Alvin Lustig. Albers worked at Yale until he retired from teaching in 1958. At Yale, Richard Anuszkiewicz, Eva Hesse, Neil Welliver, and Jane Davis Doggett were notable students. In 1962, as a fellow at Yale, he received a grant from the Graham Foundation for the Advanced Studies of Fine Arts for an exhibit and lecture on his work. Albers also collaborated with Yale professor and architect King-lui Wu in creating decorative designs for some of Wu's projects. Among these were distinctive geometric fireplaces for the Rouse (1954) and DuPont (1959) houses, the fa√ßade of Manuscript Society, one of Yale's secret senior groups (1962), and a design for the Mt. Bethel Baptist Church (1973). Also, at this time he worked on his structural constellation pieces. Also during this time, he created the abstract album covers of band leader Enoch Light's Command LP records. His album cover for Terry Snyder and the All Stars 1959 album, Persuasive Percussion, shows a tightly packed grid or lattice of small black disks from which a few wander up and out as if stray molecules of some light gas. He was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1973. Albers continued to paint and write, staying in New Haven with his wife, textile artist Anni Albers, until his death in 1976. Works =Homage to the Square= Accomplished as a designer, photographer, typographer, printmaker, and poet, Albers is best remembered for his work as an abstract painter and theorist. He favored a very disciplined approach to composition, especially in the hundreds of paintings and prints that make up the series Homage to the Square. In this rigorous series, begun in 1949, Albers explored chromatic interactions with nested squares. Usually painting on Masonite, he used a palette knife with oil colors and often recorded the colors he used on the back of his works. Each painting consists of either three or four squares of solid planes of color nested within one another, in one of four different arrangements and in square formats ranging from 406√ó406 mm to 1.22√ó1.22 m.Josef Albers Museum of Modern Art, Manhattan =Murals= Albers \\"Wrestling\\" (1977) in Sydney In 1959, a gold-leaf mural by Albers, Two Structural Constellations was engraved in the lobby of the Corning Glass Building in Manhattan. For the entrance of the Time & Life Building lobby, he created Two Portals (1961), a 42-feet by 14-feet mural of alternating glass bands in white and brown that recede into two bronze centers to create an illusion of depth.David W. Dunlap (June 17, 2002), Press 'L' for Landmark; Time & Life Lobby, a 50's Gem, Awaits Recognition The New York Times. In the 1960s, Walter Gropius, who was designing the Pan Am Building with Emery Roth & Sons and Pietro Belluschi, commissioned Albers to make a mural. The artist reworked City, a sandblasted glass construction that he had designed in 1929 at the Bauhaus, and renamed it Manhattan. The giant abstract mural of black, white, and red strips arranged in interwoven columns stood 28-feet high and 55-feet wide and was installed in the lobby of the building; it was removed during a lobby redesign around 2000. Before he died in 1976, Albers left exact specifications of the work so that it could easily be replicated; in 2019, it was replicated and reinstalled in its original place in the Pan Am building, now renamed MetLife.Carol Vogel (July 9, 2001), A Familiar Mural Finds Itself Without a Wall The New York Times.https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/manhattan-returns-to-its-rightful- place-outside-grand-central-station In 1967, his painted mural Growth (1965) as well as Loggia Wall (1965), a brick relief, were installed on the campus of the Rochester Institute of Technology. Other architectural works include Gemini (1972), a stainless steel relief for the Grand Avenue National Bank lobby in Kansas City, Missouri, and Reclining Figure (1972), a mosaic mural for the Celanese Building in Manhattan destroyed in 1980. At the invitation of a former student, the architect Harry Seidler, Albers designed the mural Wrestling (1976) for Seidler's Mutual Life Center in Sydney. Color theory In 1963, Albers published Interaction of Color, which is a record of an experiential way of studying and teaching color. He asserted that color \\"is almost never seen as it really is\\" and that \\"color deceives continually\\", and he suggested that color is best studied via experience, underpinned by experimentation and observation. The very rare first edition has a limited printing of only 2,000 copies and contained 150 silk screen plates. This work has since been republished, and is now available as an iPad App. Color model representing Albers' color theory as described in Interaction of Color (1963) Albers presented color systems at the end of his courses (and at the end of 'Interaction of Color') and these featured descriptions of primary, secondary and tertiary color, as well as a range of connotations that he assigned to specific colors on his triangular color model. In respect to his artworks, Albers was known to meticulously list the specific manufacturer's colours and varnishes he used on the back of his works, as if the colours were catalogued components of an optical experiment.Josef Albers: February 28 ‚Äî March 27, 2007 Waddington Custot Galleries, London. His work represents a transition between traditional European art and the new American art.Piper, David. The Illustrated History of Art, , p469. It incorporated European influences from the Constructivists and the Bauhaus movement, and its intensity and smallness of scale were typically European, but his influence fell heavily on American artists of the late 1950s and the 1960s. \\"Hard-edge\\" abstract painters drew on his use of patterns and intense colors,Piper, David. The Illustrated History of Art, , p470. while Op artists and conceptual artists further explored his interest in perception. In an article about the artist, published in 1950, Elaine de Kooning concluded that however impersonal his paintings might at first appear, not one of them \\"could have been painted by any one but Josef Albers himself.\\". Teaching and influence Although Albers prioritized teaching his students principles of color interaction, he was admired by many of his students for instilling a general approach to all materials and means of engaging it in design. Albers \\"put practice before theory and prioritised experience; 'what counts,' he claimed 'is not so-called knowledge of so-called facts, but vision ‚Äì seeing.' His focus was process.\\" Although their relationship was often tense, and sometimes, even combative, Robert Rauschenberg later identified Albers as his most important teacher.Christopher Knight (May 14, 2008), Robert Rauschenberg, 1925 ‚Äì 2008: He led the way to Pop Art Los Angeles Times. Albers is considered to be one of the most influential teachers of visual art in the twentieth century. =Noted students of Albers= * Richard Anuszkiewicz (painter) * Ruth Asawa (sculptor) * Varujan Boghosian (collage artist and sculptor) * Norman Carlberg (sculptor, educator) * Jane Davis Doggett (graphic designer) * Robert Engman (sculptor) * Erwin Hauer (sculptor) * Gerald Garston (painter) * Eva Hesse (sculptor) * A.

Legacy The Josef Albers papers, documents from 1929 to 1970, were donated by the artist to the Smithsonian Institution's Archives of American Art in 1969 and 1970. In 1971 (nearly five years before his death), Albers founded the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation,The Josef and Anni Albers Foundation website a nonprofit organization he hoped would further \\"the revelation and evocation of vision through art\\". Today, this organization not only serves as the office for the estates of both Josef Albers and his wife Anni Albers, but also supports exhibitions and publications focused on the works of both Albers. The official foundation building is located in Bethany, Connecticut, and \\"includes a central research and archival storage center to accommodate the Foundation's art collections, library and archives, and offices, as well as residence studios for visiting artists.\\"The Josef and Anni Albers Foundation: Mission Statement The executive director of the foundation is Nicholas Fox Weber. Later the foundation was instrumental in having four fakes from Italy, represented as the work of Albers and on sale in auction houses and galleries in France and Germany, seized by the police. In 1997, one year after the auction house, Sotheby's, had bought the Andre Emmerich Gallery, the Josef and Anni Albers Foundation, the main beneficiary of the estates of both artists, did not renew its three-year contract with the gallery.Carol Vogel (October 3, 1997), Sotheby's Loses Albers Estate The New York Times.

Krakow Witkin Gallery in Boston also holds a selection of Albers' works. Criticism Joseph Albers' book Interaction of Color continues to be influential despite criticisms that arose following his death. In 1981, Alan Lee attempted to refute Albers' general claims about colour experience (that colour deceives continually) and to posit that Albers' system of perceptual education was fundamentally misleading. Lee examined four topics in Albers' account of colour critically: additive and subtractive colour mixture; the tonal relations of colours; the Weber-Fechner Law; and simultaneous contrast. In each case Lee suggested that Albers made fundamental errors with serious consequences for his claims about colour and his pedagogical method. Lee suggested that Albers' belief in the importance of colour deception was related to a misconception about aesthetic appreciation (that it depends upon some kind of confusion about visual perception). Lee suggested that the scientific colour hypothesis of Edwin H. Land should be considered in lieu of the concepts put forward by Albers. Finally, Lee's called for a reassessment of Albers' art as necessary, following successful challenge to the foundational colour concepts that were the basis of his corpus.Lee, Alan. \\"A Critical Account of Some of Josef Albers' Concepts of Color.\\" Leonardo (1981): 99‚Äì105.Jameson, Dorothea. \\"Some Misunderstandings about Color Perception, Color Mixture and Color Measurement\\". Leonardo, vol. 16, no. 1, 1983, pp. 41‚Äì42. JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/1575043. Dorothea Jameson has challenged Lee's criticism of Albers, arguing that Albers' approach toward painting and pedagody emphasized artists' experiences in the handling and mixing of pigments, which often have different results than predicted by color theory experiments with projected light or spinning color disks. Furthermore, Jameson explains that Lee's own understanding of additive and subtractive color mixtures is flawed.Jameson, Dorothee. Some Misunderstandings about Color Perception, Color Mixture and Color Measurement. Leonardo, vol. 16, no. 1, 1983, pp. 41-42. JSTOR, https://www.jstor.org/stable/1575043.

It is also known as histiocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis, Kikuchi necrotizing lymphadenitis, phagocytic necrotizing lymphadenitis, subacute necrotizing lymphadenitis, and necrotizing lymphadenitis. Kikuchi disease occurs sporadically in people with no family history of the condition. It was first described by Dr Masahiro Kikuchi (1935‚Äì2012) in 1972Kikuchi M. Lymphadenitis showing focal reticulum cell hyperplasia with nuclear debris and phagocytes. Acta Hematol Jpn 1972;35:379‚Äì80. and independently by Y. Fujimoto. Signs and symptoms The signs and symptoms of Kikuchi disease are fever, enlargement of the lymph nodes (lymphadenopathy), skin rashes, and headache. Rarely, enlargement of the liver and spleen and nervous system involvement resembling meningitis are seen. Often a bout of extreme fatigue can occur - often taking hold during latter parts of the day and the affected person can be more prone to fatigue from exercise. Pathophysiology Some studies have suggested a genetic predisposition to the proposed autoimmune response. Several infectious candidates have been associated with Kikuchi disease. Many theories exist about the cause of KFD. Microbial/viral or autoimmune causes have been suggested. Mycobacterium szulgai and Yersinia and Toxoplasma species have been implicated. More recently, growing evidence suggests a role for Epstein-Barr virus, as well as other viruses (HHV6, HHV8, parvovirus B19, HIV and HTLV-1) in the pathogenesis of KFD. However, many independent studies have failed to identify the presence of these infectious agents in cases of Kikuchi lymphadenopathy. In addition, serologic tests including antibodies to a host of viruses have consistently proven noncontributory and no viral particles have been identified ultrastructurally. KFD is now proposed to be a nonspecific hyperimmune reaction to a variety of infectious, chemical, physical, and neoplastic agents. Other autoimmune conditions and manifestations such as antiphospholipid syndrome, polymyositis, systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis, bilateral uveitis, arthritis and cutaneous necrotizing vasculitis have been linked to KFD. KFD may represent an exuberant T-cell-mediated immune response in a genetically susceptible individual to a variety of nonspecific stimuli. Human leukocyte antigen class II genes are more frequent in patients with Kikuchi disease, suggesting a genetic predisposition to the proposed autoimmune response. Diagnosis It is diagnosed by lymph node excision biopsy.Kikuchi disease is a self-limiting illness which has symptoms which may overlap with Hodgkin's lymphoma leading to misdiagnosis in some patients.Antinuclear antibodies, antiphospholipid antibodies, anti-dsDNA, and rheumatoid factor are usually negative, and may help in differentiation from systemic lupus erythematosus. =Differential diagnosis= The differential diagnosis of Kikuchi disease includes systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), disseminated tuberculosis, lymphoma, sarcoidosis, and viral lymphadenitis. Clinical findings sometimes may include positive results for IgM/IgG/IgA antibodies.For other causes of lymph node enlargement, see lymphadenopathy. Management No specific cure is known. Treatment is largely supportive. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are indicated for tender lymph nodes and fever, and corticosteroids are useful in severe extranodal or generalized disease. Symptomatic measures aimed at relieving the distressing local and systemic complaints have been described as the main line of management of KFD. Analgesics, antipyretics, NSAIDs, and corticosteroids have been used. If the clinical course is more severe, with multiple flares of bulky enlarged cervical lymph nodes and fever, then a low- dose corticosteroid treatment has been suggested. Epidemiology Kikuchi- Fujimoto disease (KFD) is a rare, self-limiting disorder that typically affects the cervical lymph nodes. Recognition of this condition is crucial, especially because it can easily be mistaken for tuberculosis, lymphoma, or even adenocarcinoma. Awareness of this disorder helps prevent misdiagnosis and inappropriate treatment. Kikuchi's disease is a very rare disease mainly seen in Japan. Isolated cases are reported in North America, Europe, Asia and at least two cases New Zealand. It is mainly a disease of young adults (20‚Äì30 years), with a slight bias towards females. The cause of this disease is not known, although infectious and autoimmune causes have been proposed. The course of the disease is generally benign and self-limiting. Lymph node enlargement usually resolves over several weeks to six months. Recurrence rate is about 3%. Death from Kikuchi disease is extremely rare and usually occurs due to liver, respiratory, or heart failure.

The term is a portmanteau of white and nigger. The term \\"nigger\\" is pejorative and is viewed as a highly offensive racist insult and slur. One dictionary defines the term as a slang, derogatory reference to \\"...a white youth who adopts black youth culture by adopting its speech, wearing its clothes, and listening to its music.\\" Another dictionary defines the term as \\"offensive slang\\" referring to a \\"...white person, usually a teenager or young adult, who adopts the fashions, the tastes, and often the mannerisms considered typical of urban black youth.\\" The term is generally considered derogatory, reflecting stereotypes of African- American, black British, and white culture (when used as a synonym of white trash). The wannabe connotation may be used pejoratively, implying a failed attempt at cultural appropriation by a white person. It is also sometimes used in a racist manner by the white culture, not only belittling the person perceived as \\"acting black\\", but also demeaning black people and culture, by proxy. Phenomenon The phenomenon of white people adopting stereotypical black mannerisms, speech, and apparel‚Äìwhich in the general case is called allophilia‚Äìhas appeared in several generations since slavery was abolished in the Western world. The concept has been documented in the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and other white-majority countries. An early form of this was the white negro in the jazz and swing music scenes of the 1920s and 1930s; as examined in the 1957 Norman Mailer essay \\"The White Negro\\". It was later seen in the zoot suiter of the 1930s and 1940s, the hipster of the 1940s, the beatnik of the 1950s-1960s, the fascination with Jamaican ska and rude boy culture in Britain's 1960s mod subculture, the blue- eyed soul of the 1970s (soul music sung by white singers), and the hip hop done by white rappers in the 1980s and 1990s. Bakari Kitwana, \\"...a culture critic who's been tracking American hip hop for years...\\" has written Why White Kids Love Hip Hop: Wankstas, Wiggers, Wannabes, and the New Reality of Race in America. In 1993, an article in the UK newspaper The Independent described the phenomenon of white, middle-class kids who were \\"wannabe Blacks\\". The African-American hip hop artist Azealia Banks has criticized white rapper Iggy Azalea \\"..for failing to comment on \\"black issues\\" despite capitalising on the appropriation of African American culture in her music.\\" Banks has called Azalea a \\"wigger\\" and there have been \\"...accusations of racism against Azalea\\" focused on her \\"...insensitivity to the complexities of race relations and cultural appropriation.\\" Robert A. Clift's documentary, \\"Blacking Up: Hip-Hop's Remix of Race and Identity,\\" questions white enthusiasts of black hip-hop culture. The term of art wigger \\"...is used both proudly and derisively to describe white enthusiasts of black hip-hop culture.\\" Clift's documentary examines \\"...racial and cultural ownership and authenticity -- a path that begins with the stolen blackness seen in the success of Stephen Foster, Al Jolson, Benny Goodman, Elvis Presley, the Rolling Stones -- all the way up to Justin Bieber, Vanilla Ice (popular music's ur-wigger) and Eminem.\\" A review of the documentary refers to the wiggers as \\"white poseurs.\\" One of the earliest examples of a wigger is to be found in the fictional character of Felix in Harry Crews' book All We Need of Hell. Felix is the son of white parents who, as the narrative develops, begins to adopt the mannerisms, speech, and sensibilities of a Southern Black athlete he spends time with. Although the book was published in 1987, it was actually written in the 1970s. The character of Ed Wuncler III on the television series The Boondocks is another example of a fictional wigger.

The ship was the fourth US Navy ship to bear the name, and was named after the capture of Fort Ticonderoga in the American Revolutionary War. Ticonderoga was commissioned in May 1944, and served in several campaigns in the Pacific Theater of Operations, earning five battle stars. Decommissioned shortly after the end of the war, she was modernized and recommissioned in the early 1950s as an attack carrier (CVA), and then eventually became an antisubmarine carrier (CVS). She was recommissioned too late to participate in the Korean War, but was very active in the Vietnam War, earning three Navy Unit Commendations, one Meritorious Unit Commendation, and 12 battle stars. Ticonderoga differed somewhat from the earlier Essex-class ships in that she was longer to accommodate bow-mounted anti-aircraft guns. Most subsequent Essex-class carriers were completed to this \\"long-hull\\" design and were apparently referred to as the . At the end of her career, after a number of modifications, she was said to be in the Hancock class according to the Naval vessel register. Ticonderoga was decommissioned in 1973 and sold for scrap in 1975. Construction and commissioning The ship was laid down as Hancock on 1 February 1943 at Newport News, Virginia, by the Newport News Shipbuilding & Dry Dock Co., renamed Ticonderoga on 1 May 1943, and launched on 7 February 1944, sponsored by Miss Stephanie Sarah Pell. She was commissioned at the Norfolk Navy Yard on 8 May 1944, Captain Dixie Kiefer in command. Service history Ticonderoga remained at Norfolk for almost two months outfitting and embarking Air Group 80. On 26 June 1944, the carrier shaped a course for the British West Indies. She conducted air operations and drills en route and reached Port of Spain, Trinidad, on 30 June. For the next 15 days, Ticonderoga trained intensively to weld her air group and crew into an efficient wartime team. She departed the West Indies on 16 July and headed back to Norfolk where she arrived on 22 July for post-shakedown repairs and alterations. On 30 August, the carrier headed for Panama. She transited the Panama Canal on 4 September and steamed up the coast to Naval Base San Diego the following day. On 13 September, the carrier moored at San Diego where she loaded provisions, fuel, aviation gas, and an additional 77 aircraft, as well as the Marine Corps aviation and defense units that went with them. On 19 September, she steamed for Hawaii where she arrived five days later. Ticonderoga remained at Pearl Harbor for almost a month. She and conducted experiments in the underway transfer of aviation bombs from cargo ship to aircraft carrier. Following those tests, she conducted air operations ‚Äì day and night landing and antiaircraft defense drills ‚Äì until 18 October, when she exited Pearl Harbor and headed for the western Pacific. After a brief stop at Eniwetok, Ticonderoga arrived at Ulithi in the Western Caroline Islands on 29 October. There she embarked Rear Admiral Arthur W. Radford, Commander, Carrier Division 6, and joined Task Force 38 (TF 38) as a unit of Rear Admiral Frederick C. Sherman's Task Group 38.3 (TG 38.3). =World War II= Philippine campaign The carrier sortied from Ulithi with TF 38 on 2 November 1944. She joined the other carriers as they resumed their extended air cover for the ground forces supporting the Battle of Leyte. She launched her first air strike on the morning of 5 November. The aircraft of her air group spent the next two days pummeling enemy shipping near Luzon and air installations on that island. Her aircraft bombed and strafed the airfields at Zablan, Mandaluyong, and Pasig. They also joined those of other carriers in sinking the heavy cruiser . In addition, Ticonderoga pilots claimed six Japanese aircraft shot down and one destroyed on the ground, as well as 23 others damaged. Around 16:00 on 5 November, the enemy attacked with a group of kamikaze aircraft. Two of the suicide aircraft penetrated the American combat air patrol and antiaircraft fire to crash into the aircraft carrier . Ticonderoga emerged from that attack unscathed and claimed a tally of two splashes. On 6 November, the warship launched two fighter sweeps and two bombing strikes against the Luzon airfields and enemy shipping in the vicinity. Her airmen returned later that day claiming the destruction of 35 Japanese aircraft and attacks on six enemy ships in Manila Bay. After recovering her aircraft, the carrier retired to the east to resupply. She refueled and received replacement aircraft on 7 November and then headed back to continue operating against enemy forces in the Philippines. Early on the morning of 11 November, her aircraft combined with others of TF 38 to attack a Japanese reinforcement convoy, just as it was preparing to enter Ormoc Bay from the Camotes Sea. Together, the aircraft accounted for all the enemy transports and four of the seven escorting destroyers. On 12‚Äì13 November, Ticonderoga and her sister ships launched strikes at Luzon airfields and docks and shipping around Manila. This raid destroyed the light cruiser , four destroyers, and seven merchant ships. At the conclusion of the raid, TF 38 retired eastward for refueling. Ticonderoga and the rest of TG 38.3, however, continued east to Ulithi where they arrived on 17 November to replenish, refuel, and rearm. On 22 November, the aircraft carrier departed Ulithi once more and steamed back toward the Philippines. Three days later, she launched air strikes on central Luzon and adjacent waters. Her pilots sank the heavy cruiser , previously damaged in the Battle off Samar. Later, they attacked an enemy convoy about southwest of Kumano in Dasol Bay. Of this convoy, cruiser Yasoshima, a merchantman, and three landing ships were sunk. Ticonderogas air group ended their day of destruction with an aerial battle which cost the Japanese 15 aircraft shot down and 11 destroyed on the ground. While her air group fought the Japanese, Ticonderogas shipboard crew also went into action. Just after noon, a torpedo launched by an enemy aircraft broached in the wake of the light aircraft carrier , announcing the approach of an enemy air raid. Ticonderogas gunners manned their battle stations defending against both conventional and suicide attacks on the task group. Her sister ship was set afire when one of the kamikazes crashed into her. When a second suicide aircraft tried to attack the stricken carrier, Ticonderogas gunners joined those firing from other ships in shooting it down. That afternoon, while damage control parties worked on Essex, Ticonderoga recovered aircrew which the damaged Essex and were unable to receive. The following day, TF 38 retired to the east. TF 38 stood out of Ulithi again on 11 December and headed for the Philippines. Ticonderoga arrived at the launch point early in the afternoon of 13 December and sent her aircraft aloft to blanket Japanese airbases on Luzon while Army aircraft attacked those in the central Philippines. For three days, Ticonderoga airmen and their comrades launched airstrikes on enemy airfields. She withdrew on 16 December with the rest of TF 38 in search of a fueling rendezvous. While attempting to find calmer waters in which to refuel, TF 38 steamed directly through a violent, but unheralded, typhoon. Though the storm cost Admiral William Halsey's force three destroyers and over 800 lives, Ticonderoga and the other carriers managed to ride it out with a minimum of damage. Having survived the battle, Ticonderoga returned to Ulithi on 24 December. Repairs occasioned by the typhoon kept TF 38 in the anchorage almost until the end of the month. The carriers did not return to sea until 30 December 1944 when they steamed north to hit Formosa and Luzon in preparation for the landings on the latter island at Lingayen Gulf. Severe weather limited the Formosa strikes on 3‚Äì4 January 1945 but also hampered enemy operations. The warships fueled at sea on 5 January. Despite rough weather on 6 January, the strikes on Luzon airfields were carried out. That day, Ticonderogas airmen and their colleagues of the other air groups increased their score by another 32 enemy aircraft. 7 January brought more strikes on Luzon installations. After a fueling rendezvous on 8 January, Ticonderoga sped north at night to get into position to blanket Japanese airfields in the Ry≈´ky≈´s during the Lingayen assault the following morning. However, foul weather, the bugaboo of TF 38 during the winter of 1944 and 1945, forced TG 38.3 to abandon the strikes on the Ry≈´ky≈´ airfields and join TG 38.2 in pounding Formosa. South China Sea combat During the night of 9‚Äì10 January, TF 38 steamed through the Luzon Strait and then headed generally southwest, diagonally across the South China Sea. Ticonderoga provided combat air patrol coverage on 11 January and helped to bring down four enemy aircraft which attempted to snoop the formation. Otherwise, the carriers and their consorts proceeded uneventfully to a point some off the coast of Indochina. There, on 12 January, they launched their approximately 850 aircraft and made a series of anti- shipping sweeps during which they sank 44 ships, totaling over . After recovering aircraft in the late afternoon, the carriers moved off to the northeast. Heavy weather hindered fueling operations on the 13th‚Äì14th and air reconnaissance failed to detect any worthwhile targets. On 15 January, fighters raided Japanese airfields on the Chinese coast while the carriers headed for a position from which to strike Hong Kong. The following morning, they launched anti-shipping bombing raids and fighter sweeps of air installations. Weather prevented air operations on 17 January and again made fueling difficult. It worsened the next day and stopped replenishment operations altogether, so that they were not finally concluded until 19 January. The force then took a course generally northward to retransit Luzon Strait via Balintang Channel. Attacks on South Japanese islands The three task groups of TF 38 completed their transit during the night of 20‚Äì21 January. The next morning, aided by favorable flight conditions, their aircraft hit airfields on Formosa, in the Pescadores, and at Sakishima Gunto. While it allowed American flight operations to continue through the day, it also allowed for Japanese kamikaze operations. Ticonderoga listing after kamikaze attacks, 21 January 1945. Just after noon, a single-engine Japanese aircraft scored a hit on Langley with a glide-bombing attack. Seconds later, a kamikaze swooped out of the clouds and plunged toward Ticonderoga. The aircraft crashed through the ship's flight deck abreast of the No. 2 mount, and its bomb exploded just above her hangar deck. Several aircraft stowed nearby erupted into flames and men were killed. While the crew were ordered into action to save the endangered carrier, Captain Kiefer conned his ship skilfully. First, he changed course to keep the wind from fanning the blaze. Then, he ordered magazines and other compartments flooded to prevent further explosions and to correct a 10¬∞ starboard list. Finally, he instructed the damage control party to continue flooding compartments on Ticonderogas port side which induced a 10¬∞ port list which dumped the fire overboard. Firefighters and aircraft handlers completed the dangerous job of dousing the flames and jettisoning burning aircraft. Other kamikaze then assailed the carrier. Her antiaircraft gunners shot down three which all crashed into the sea, but a fourth aircraft struck the carrier's starboard side near the island. Its bomb set more aircraft on fire, riddled her flight deck, and injured or killed another 100 sailors, with Captain Kiefer one of the wounded. Ticonderogas crew continued their efforts and were spared further attacks. They brought her fires completely under control not long after 1400, and Ticonderoga retired. Repair and relaunch The stricken carrier arrived at Ulithi on 24 January but remained there only long enough to move her wounded to hospital ship , to transfer her air group to , and to embark passengers bound for home. Ticonderoga cleared the lagoon on 28 January and headed for the U.S. The warship stopped briefly at Pearl Harbor en route to the Puget Sound Navy Yard where she arrived on 15 February. Captain William Sinton assumed command in February 1945. Her repairs were completed on 20 April, and she cleared Puget Sound the following day for the Alameda Naval Air Station, Alameda, California. After embarking passengers and aircraft bound for Hawaii, the carrier headed for Pearl Harbor where she arrived on 1 May. The next day, Air Group 87 came on board and, for the next week, trained in preparation for the carrier's return to combat. Ticonderoga stood out of Pearl Harbor and shaped a course for the western Pacific. En route to Ulithi, on 17 May, she launched her aircraft for what amounted to training strikes on Japanese-held Taroa in the Marshalls. On 22 May, the warship arrived in Ulithi and rejoined the Fast Carrier Task Force as an element of Rear Admiral Radford's TG 58.4. =Preparing for the Japan campaign= Two days after her arrival, Ticonderoga sortied from Ulithi with TF 58 and headed north to spend the last weeks of the war in Japanese home waters. Three days out, Admiral Halsey relieved Admiral Raymond Spruance, the 5th Fleet reverted to 3rd Fleet, and TF 58 became TF 38 again for the duration. On 2‚Äì3 June, Ticonderoga fighters struck at airfields on Ky≈´sh≈´ in an effort to neutralize the remnants of Japanese air power ‚Äì particularly the kamikaze ‚Äì and to relieve the pressure on American forces at Okinawa. During the following two days, Ticonderoga rode out her second typhoon in less than six months and emerged relatively unscathed. She provided combat air patrol cover for 6 June refueling rendezvous, and four of her fighters intercepted and destroyed three Okinawa-bound kamikazes. That evening, she steamed off at high speed with TG 38.4 to conduct a fighter sweep of airfields on southern Ky≈´sh≈´ on 8 June. Ticonderogas aircraft then joined in the aerial bombardment of Minami Daito and Kita Daito islands before the carrier headed for Leyte where she arrived on the 13th. During the two-week rest and replenishment period she enjoyed at Leyte, Ticonderoga changed task organizations from TG 38.4 to Rear Admiral Gerald F. Bogan's TG 38.3. On 1 July, under the flag of Rear Admiral Clifton Sprague, she departed Leyte with TF 38 and headed north to resume raids on Japan. Two days later, a damaged reduction gear forced her into Apra Harbor, Guam, for repairs. She remained there until the 19th when she steamed off to rejoin TF 38. On the 24th, her aircraft joined those of other fast carriers in striking ships in the Inland Sea and airfields at Nagoya, Osaka, and Miko. During those raids, TF 38 aircraft found the sad remnants of the once-mighty Japanese Fleet and bagged battleships , , and as well as an escort carrier, , and two heavy cruisers. On 28 July, her aircraft directed their efforts toward the Kure Naval Base, where they pounded an aircraft carrier, three cruisers, a destroyer, and a submarine. She shifted her attention to the industrial area of central Honsh≈´ on 30 July, then to northern Honsh≈´ and Hokkaid≈ç on 9‚Äì10 August. The latter attacks thoroughly destroyed the marshaling area for a planned airborne suicide raid on the B-29 bases in the Marianas. On 13‚Äì14 August, her aircraft returned to the Tokyo area and helped to subject the Japanese capital to another severe drubbing. On the morning of 16 August, Ticonderoga launched another strike against Tokyo. During or just after that attack, word reached TF 38 to the effect that Japan had capitulated. The shock of peace, though not so abrupt as that of war almost four years previously, took some getting used to. Ticonderoga and her sister ships remained on a full war footing. She continued patrols over Japanese territory and sent reconnaissance flights in search of camps containing Allied prisoners of war so that air-dropped supplies could be rushed to them. On 6 September ‚Äì four days after the formal surrender ceremony aboard ‚Äì Ticonderoga entered Tokyo Bay. Post-war Her arrival at Tokyo ended one phase of her career and began another. From Tokyo, she embarked homeward-bound to Bremerton Navy Yard in Puget Sound and was again put to sea on 20 October, 1945. After a stop in Pearl Harbor in November to alter the carrier to accommodate additional passengers for the Operation Magic Carpet voyage, she steamed to Okinawa, Japan, to pick up servicemen and returned home with a Typhoon on her back reaching Alameda Navy Yard in Oakland, CA in December 1945. She disembarked her passengers and unloaded cargo before heading out to the Philippines at Samar to pick up another group of veterans. Leaving Philippines in early January 1946, she headed home to Puget Sound Naval Shipyard outside of Seattle, WA delivering an estimated two to four thousand returning servicemen and unloading armaments and ammunition before entering the Bremerton Navy Yard to prepare for inactivation. Almost a year later on 9 January 1947, Ticonderoga was placed out of commission and berthed with the Bremerton Group of the Pacific Reserve Fleet. =Redeployment in the Pacific= On 31 January 1952, Ticonderoga came out of reserve and went into reduced commission for the transit from Bremerton to New York. She departed Puget Sound on 27 February and reached New York on 1 April. Three days later, she was decommissioned at the New York Naval Shipyard to begin the extensive SCB-27C conversion. During the ensuing 29 months, the carrier received numerous modifications ‚Äì steam catapults to launch jets, a new nylon barricade, a new deck-edge elevator and the latest electronic and fire control equipment ‚Äì necessary for her to become an integral unit of the fleet. On 11 September 1954, Ticonderoga was recommissioned at New York, Captain William A. \\"Bill\\" Schoech in command. Ticonderoga following her SCB-27C conversion, circa 1954. In January 1955, the carrier shifted to her new home port ‚Äì Naval Station Norfolk, Norfolk, Virginia ‚Äì where she arrived on the 6th. Over the next month, she conducted carrier qualifications with Air Group 6 in the Virginia Capes operating area. On 3 February, she stood out of Hampton Roads for shakedown near Cuba, after which she returned via Norfolk to New York for additional alterations. During the late summer, the warship resumed carrier qualifications in the Virginia Capes area. She visited Philadelphia over Labor Day weekend to participate in the International Air Show. To demonstrate the power of her new steam catapults, on three consecutive days she launched North American AJ-1 Savages while standing at anchor in the Delaware River. Ticonderoga next participated in tests of four new aircraft ‚Äì the A4D-1 Skyhawk, F4D-1 Skyray, F7U Cutlass, and F3H-2N Demon. Ticonderoga then returned to normal operations along the East Coast until 4 November when she departed Naval Station Mayport, Florida, and headed for Europe. She relieved Intrepid at Gibraltar 10 days later and cruised the length of the Mediterranean during the following eight months. On 2 August 1956, Ticonderoga returned to Norfolk and entered the shipyard to receive an angled flight deck and an enclosed hurricane bow as part of the SCB-125 program. Those modifications were completed by early 1957, and in April she got underway for her new home port ‚Äì Alameda, California. She reached her destination on 30 May, underwent repairs, and finished out the summer with operations off the California coast. On 16 September, she stood out of San Francisco Bay and shaped course for the Far East. En route, she stopped at Pearl Harbor before continuing west to Yokosuka Japan, where she arrived on 15 October. For six months, Ticonderoga cruised the waters from Japan in the north to the Philippines in the south. Upon arriving at Alameda on 25 April 1958, she completed her first deployment to the western Pacific since recommissioning. =Vietnam= Pre-conflict operations From 1958‚Äì1963, Ticonderoga made four more peacetime deployments to the western Pacific. During each, she conducted training operations with other units of the 7th Fleet and made goodwill and liberty port calls throughout the Far East. Early in 1964, she began preparations for her sixth cruise to the western Pacific and, following exercises off the west coast and in the Hawaiian Islands, the carrier cleared Pearl Harbor on 4 May for what began as another peaceful tour of duty in the Far East. The first three months of that deployment brought normal operations‚Äîtraining and port calls. Initial actions On 2 August, while operating in international waters in the Gulf of Tonkin, the destroyer reported being attacked by units of the (North) Vietnam People's Navy. Within minutes of her receipt of the message, Ticonderoga dispatched four, rocket-armed F8E Crusaders to the destroyer's assistance. Upon arrival, the Crusaders launched Zuni rockets and strafed the North Vietnamese craft with their cannon. After the efforts of Ticonderoga and Maddox, one boat was left dead in the water and the other two damaged. Two days later, late in the evening of 4 August, Ticonderoga received urgent requests from the destroyer ‚Äî by then on patrol with Maddox ‚Äî for air support in resisting what the destroyer alleged to be another torpedo boat foray. The carrier again launched aircraft to aid the American surface ships, and Turner Joy directed them. The Navy surface and air team believed it had sunk two boats and damaged another pair. President Lyndon Johnson responded with a reprisal to what he felt at the time to be two unprovoked attacks on American seapower and ordered retaliatory air strikes on selected North Vietnamese motor torpedo boat bases. On 5 August, Ticonderoga and launched 60 sorties against four bases and their supporting oil storage facilities. The USN attacks reportedly resulted in the destruction of 25 PT-type boats, severe damage to the bases, and almost complete razing of the oil storage depot. For her quick reaction and successful combat actions on those three occasions, Ticonderoga received the Navy Unit Commendation. Stand-down After a return visit to Japan in September, the aircraft carrier resumed normal operations in the South China Sea until winding up the deployment late in the year. She returned to the Naval Air Station North Island, California, on 15 December 1964. Following post-deployment and holiday stand-down, Ticonderoga moved to the Hunter's Point Naval Shipyard on 27 January 1965 to begin a five- month overhaul. She completed repairs in June and spent the summer operating along the coast of southern California. On 28 September, the aircraft carrier put to sea for another deployment to the Orient. She spent some time in the Hawaiian Islands for an operational readiness exercise then continued on to the Far East. She reached \\"Dixie Station\\" on 5 November and immediately began combat air operations. =1965‚Äì66 deployment= refuels Ticonderoga on 15 July 1965. U.S. Navy photo. Ticonderogas winter deployment of 1965 and 1966 was her first total combat tour of duty during American involvement in the Vietnam War. During her six months in the Far East, the carrier spent a total of 116 days in air operations off the coast of Vietnam dividing her time almost evenly between \\"Dixie\\" and \\"Yankee Stations\\", the carrier operating areas off South and North Vietnam, respectively. Her air group delivered over of ordnance in more than 10,000 combat sorties, with a loss of 16 aircraft, but only five pilots. For the most part, her aircraft hit enemy installations in North Vietnam and interdicted supply routes into South Vietnam, including river-borne and coastwise junk and sampan traffic as well as roads, bridges, and trucks on land. Specifically, they claimed the destruction of 35 bridges as well as numerous warehouses, barracks, trucks, boats, and railroad cars and severe damage to a major North Vietnamese thermal power plant located at Uong Bi north of Haiphong. After a stop at Yokosuka, Japan, from 25 April-3 May 1966, the warship put to sea to return to the United States. On 13 May, she pulled into port at San Diego to end the deployment. On 5 December 1965, a Douglas A-4 Skyhawk was lost overboard while the aircraft carrier was from Kikai Island, Kagoshima Prefecture, Japan. The aircraft was being rolled from a hangar bay onto an elevator. The aircraft had mounted on it a B43 nuclear bomb. The pilot, Lieutenant JG Douglas Webster, the A-4E Skyhawk, BuNo 151022, of Attack Squadron VA-56 \\"Champions\\", and the nuclear weapon were all lost. No public mention was made of the incident at the time and it would not come to light until a 1981 United States Department of Defense report revealed that a one-megaton bomb had been lost. Japan then asked for details of the incident. 1966‚Äì67, 1967‚Äì68 deployments Following repairs she steamed out of San Diego on 9 July to begin a normal round of West Coast training operations. Those and similar evolutions continued until 15 October, when Ticonderoga departed San Diego, bound via Hawaii for the western Pacific. The carrier reached Yokosuka, Japan, on 30 October and remained there until 5 November when she headed south for an overnight stop at U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay, Subic Bay in the Philippines on 10‚Äì11 November. On 13 November, Ticonderoga arrived in the Gulf of Tonkin and began the first of three combat tours during her 1966‚Äì1967 deployment. She launched 11,650 combat sorties, all against enemy targets located in North Vietnam. Again, her primary targets were logistics and communications lines and transportation facilities. For her contribution and that of Air Wing Nineteen to Operation Rolling Thunder, Ticonderoga was awarded her second Navy Unit Commendation. Aircraft of Attack Carrier Air Wing Nineteen (CVW-19) near the time described in the article - this photo is from 1971 when Air Wing Nineteen had moved to USS Oriskany.She completed her final line period on 27 April 1967 and returned to Yokosuka, from which she departed again on 19 May to return to the United States. Ten days later, the carrier entered San Diego and began a month-long, post- deployment stand-down. At the beginning of July, she shifted to Bremerton, Washington, where she entered the Puget Sound for two months of repairs. Upon the completion of yard work, she departed Bremerton on 6 September and steamed south to training operations off the coast of southern California. On 28 December 1967, Ticonderoga sailed for her fourth combat deployment to the waters off the Indochinese coast and arrived on Yankee Station in January 1968. Ticonderoga was on Yankee Station for the beginning of the 1968 Tet Offensive. Nearly coincidental with the Tet Offensive, the siege of Khe Sanh began and , an American spy ship, was seized by the North Koreans and taken to Wonsan harbor. The aircraft carrier was immediately deployed to the coast of North Korea, beginning Operation Formation Star. Approximately a week later, Ranger was relieved off Korea by Ticonderoga and returned to Yankee Station. joined Ticonderoga and strikes were planned against seven MiG airfields with approximately 200 MiGS. These strikes were never executed and Ticonderoga returned to Yankee Station to resume her role in the Tet Offensive. Between January 1968 and July 1968, Ticonderoga was on the line off the coast of Vietnam for five separate periods totaling 120 days of combat duty. During that time, her air wing flew just over 13,000 combat sorties against North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces, most frequently in the continuing attempts to interdict the enemy lines of supply. Between line periods, she regularly returned to Subic Bay and Naval Air Station Cubi Point for rest and replenishment. She also made port visits at Singapore and Hong Kong. On 9 July, during her fifth line period, LCDR John B. Nichols claimed Ticonderogas first MiG kill. The carrier completed that line period and entered Subic Bay for upkeep on 25 July. Ticonderoga then proceeded for her homeport in Naval Air Station North Island, Coronado, California arriving on 17 August 1968 after a one-day delay in the fog off San Diego in the San Clemente Channel. Shortly thereafter, Ticonderoga moved to the Long Beach Naval Shipyard for repairs and certain conversions to handle the A-7 Corsair attack jet and to prepare for her fifth combat cruise in February 1969. =Final deployments= man the rail as the ship passes through the Sunda Strait in April 1971. During the first month of 1969, Ticonderoga made preparations for her fifth consecutive combat deployment to the Southeast Asia area. On 1 February, she cleared San Diego and headed west. After a brief stop at Pearl Harbor a week later, she continued her voyage to Yokosuka where she arrived on the 20th. The carrier departed Yokosuka on 28 February for the coast of Vietnam where she arrived on 4 March. Over the next four months, Ticonderoga served four periods on the line off Vietnam, interdicting Communist supply lines and making strikes against their positions. During her second line period, however, her tour of duty off Vietnam came to an abrupt end on 16 April when she was shifted north to the Sea of Japan. North Korean aircraft had shot down a Navy reconnaissance aircraft in the area, and Ticonderoga was called upon to beef up the forces assigned to the vicinity. However, the crisis abated, and Ticonderoga entered Subic Bay on 27 April for upkeep. On 8 May, she departed the Philippines to return to \\"Yankee Station\\" and resumed interdiction operations. Between her third and fourth line periods, the carrier visited Sasebo and Hong Kong. The aircraft carrier took station off Vietnam for her last line period of the deployment on 26 June and there followed 37 more days of highly successful air sorties against enemy targets. Following that tour, she joined TF 71 in the Sea of Japan for the remainder of the deployment. Ticonderoga concluded the deployment‚Äîa highly successful one, for she received her third Navy Unit Commendation for her operations during that tour of duty‚Äîwhen she left Subic Bay on 4 September. Post-Vietnam service Apollo 17 recovery operations Ticonderoga arrived in San Diego on 18 September. After almost a month of post-deployment stand-down, she moved to the Long Beach Naval Shipyard in mid-October to begin conversion to an antisubmarine warfare (ASW) aircraft carrier. Overhaul and conversion work began on 20 October, and Ticonderoga was redesignated CVS-14 the next day. She completed overhaul and conversion on 28 May 1970 and conducted exercises out of Long Beach for most of June. On 26 June, the new ASW support carrier entered her new home port, San Diego. In July‚ÄìAugust, she conducted refresher training, refresher air operations, and carrier landing qualifications. She operated off the California coast for the remainder of the year and participated in two naval exercises-HUKASWEX 4‚Äì70 late in October and COMPUTEX 23‚Äì70 between 30 November and 3 December. During the remainder of her active career, Ticonderoga made two more deployments to the Far East. Because of her change in mission, neither tour of duty included combat operations off Vietnam. Both, however, included training exercises in the Sea of Japan with ships of the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force. The first of these two cruises also brought operations in the Indian Ocean with units of the Thai Navy and a transit of Sunda Strait during which a ceremony was held to commemorate the loss of the cruisers and in 1942. Ticonderoga off the coast of California in 1972 at the start of her final WESTPAC cruise In between these two last deployments, she operated in the eastern Pacific and participated in the recovery of the Apollo 16 Moon mission capsule and astronauts 215 miles SE off Christmas Island during April 1972. The second deployment came in the summer of 1972, and, in addition to the training exercises in the Sea of Japan, Ticonderoga also joined ASW training operations in the South China Sea. That fall, she returned to the eastern Pacific and, in November practiced for the recovery of Apollo 17. The next month, Ticonderoga recovered her second set of space voyagers near American Samoa at decimal -17.88, -166.11. The carrier then headed back to San Diego where she arrived on 28 December. On 22 June 1973, Ticonderoga recovered the Skylab 2 astronauts near San Diego. Ticonderoga remained active for nine more months, first operating out of San Diego and then making preparations for inactivation. On 1 September 1973, the aircraft carrier was decommissioned after a board of inspection and survey found her to be unfit for further naval service. Her name was struck from the Navy list on 16 November 1973, and arrangements were begun to sell her for scrap. She was sold for scrap 1 September 1975. Awards Ticonderoga received five battle stars during World War II and three Navy Unit Commendations, one Meritorious Unit Commendation, and 12 battle stars during the Vietnam War.

Nicknamed City Cars, the R1s were the first of five subway car classes collectively referred to as Arnines, or R1-9s, with future passenger stock orders ‚Äì including contracts R4, R6, R7/A, and R9 ‚Äì being virtually identical, with minor mechanical and cosmetic variations. The first R1s were delivered in 1931, in anticipation for the opening of the IND Eighth Avenue Line. For their time, the R1s introduced several improvements to subway car design that greatly sped up the flow of passengers in and out of trains. The R42s, R44s, and R46s gradually replaced the fleet of R1s, with the final run taking place in 1977. Several R1 cars were saved for preservation, while the rest were scrapped. Description The R1s were numbered 100‚Äì399. They were the first \\"R\\" type contract order (referring to the practice of naming a car class by the letter \\"R\\" ‚Äì which stands for rapid transit ‚Äì followed by a number derived from the actual contract number). Future orders of subway cars, including those built for the A Division, would follow the R contract. The R2 contract order was for trucks and motors for the R1 fleet. In 1930, each new car cost $39,201: $30,483 for the car body under contract R1, and $8,718 for trucks and motors under contract R2. History R1 car 100 on the alt= The first R1 cars to see passenger service were twenty individual cars to serve for two 8 car trains plus spares that were placed in revenue service on the BMT Sea Beach Line from July 8 to November 1931 for testing and then returned to the IND the same year. The BMT was to have been paid by the City of New York for the testing, but since they were fairly extensively used in service (made up as two 8-car trains), the BMT and City called it even. The cars were ordered so that the new Eighth Avenue Line subway could be operated. In 1949, when all of the R10 cars were delivered and placed in service on the A line, approximately 224 of these R1 cars were transferred to the 36th Street Yard of the BMT Southern Division to relieve a car shortage on the BMT Lines. They were used for service on the BMT 2 (now R) Broadway 4th Avenue Local service, which in 1949 was also extended from Queensboro Plaza to Astoria‚ÄìDitmars Blvd, requiring more cars until 1961 when new R27/30 cars were delivered to the New York City Transit System's BMT Lines. The new R27/30 cars replaced and released these loaned R1 cars back to the IND Division. =Retirement= Most R1s were retired between 1969 and 1970 as age decayed the cars' internal components, causing the cars to perform worse than their newer contemporaries. Many were replaced by the R42s, but some remained past 1970 until being retired and replaced by the R44s. However, car 369, which was renumbered to 576 in 1969 and then to 1768 in 1972, was transferred to the East New York Yard. It ran on the Eastern Division until February 1977, when it was finally replaced by the R46s. Following their removal from service, the majority of the fleet was scrapped. Few cars remained as work cars and were used until the 1980s. Several other cars have been preserved and remain today, including: *100 ‚Äì preserved by the New York Transit Museum and restored. It is the first car of the Arnine fleet, numerically. *103 ‚Äì preserved by Railway Preservation Corp. and restored.

The distillery is operated by Diageo, and Talisker's 10 year old expression has been nominated as part of their Classic Malts series. The brand is considered a premium Single Malt Whisky. History The distillery was founded in 1830 by Hugh and Kenneth MacAskill, and built in 1831 at Carbost after a number of false starts on other sites when they acquired the lease of Talisker House from the Macleod of MacLeod . The distillery was rebuilt 1880‚Äì87 and extended in 1900. When a new lease for the distillery was negotiated with the chief of Clan MacLeod in 1892 the annual payment was to be ¬£23.12s and a ten-gallon cask of best-quality Talisker. It was rebuilt in 1960 after a stillhouse fire completely destroyed the distillery. The distillery operates five stills; two wash stills and three spirit stills. All the stills use worm tubs (condensing coils) rather than a modern condenser, which are believed to give the whisky a \\"fuller\\" flavour (itself an indication of higher sugar content). During this early period, the whisky was produced using a triple distilling method, but changed to the more conventional double distilling in 1928. Talisker was acquired by Distillers Company in 1925 and is now part of Diageo. After the 1960 fire, five exact replicas of the original stills were constructed to preserve the original Talisker flavour. In 1972 the stills were converted to steam heating and the maltings floor was demolished. Talisker's water comes from springs directly above the distillery via a network of pipes and wells. The malted barley used in production comes from Muir of Ord. Talisker has an unusual feature‚Äîswan neck lye pipes. A loop in the pipes takes the vapour from the stills to the worm tubs so some of the alcohol already condenses before it reaches the cooler. It then runs back into the stills and is distilled again. Talisker now has an annual output of three and a half million litres of spirit. Talisker was the favourite whisky of writers Robert Louis Stevenson and HV Morton. In his poem \\"The Scotsman's Return From Abroad\\", Stevenson mentioned \\"The king o' drinks, as I conceive it, Talisker, Islay, or Glenlivet.\\" In early 2020, Talisker came under scrutiny after a radiocarbon study suggested Talisker 1863 whisky was produced much later, either between 1957-58 or 2007-2014. Character The distillery The spirit is most frequently matured in American oak casks. The malt is peated to a phenol level of approximately 18‚Äì22 parts per million (ppm), which is a medium peating level. Additionally, the water used for production, from Cnoc nan Speireag (Hawk Hill), flows over peat which adds additional complexity to the whisky. The distillery began producing special bottlings of the whisky for connoisseurs in the early 2000s, with a 20- and 25-year bottling (where previously only a 10-year and 18-year were available). The 25-year bottling, despite being more expensive than the 20-year bottling, was distributed more widely. In 2007 Talisker 18-year-old won \\"Best Single Malt In The World 2007\\" at the World Whiskies Awards. and in 2015 Talisker 10 Year Old won a Double Gold Medal and \\"Best Single Malt Scotch up to 12 years\\" in the San Francisco World Spirits Competition.

The 10- and 18-year varieties, meanwhile, have received scores of 85-89 and 90-95 from Wine Enthusiast. Spirits ratings aggregator proof66.com, which averages scores from the San Francisco World Spirits Competition, Wine Enthusiast, and others, classifies Talisker's 10-year scotch in its highest (\\"Tier 1\\") performance category. Talisker Distiller's Edition won Best Islands Single Malt at the 2013 World Whiskies Awards. References in popular culture Talisker is repeatedly referenced in the BBC Radio 4 comedy Cabin Pressure. Three separate episodes (\\"Edinburgh\\" in series 1, \\"Paris\\" in series 3 and \\"Timbuktu\\" in series 4) revolve around First Officer Douglas Richardson's attempts to steal 25-year aged Talisker whisky rightfully belonging to the wealthy regular passenger Mr Birling, and it is also mentioned in several other episodes. In the movie Charlie Wilson's War, CIA agent Gust Avrakotos presents US Rep. Wilson a bottle of Talisker. The agent explains to Charlie the scotch is mentioned in a Robert Louis Stevenson poem, \\"The Scotsman's Return From Abroad\\". The bottle is bugged and allows him to listen to the congressman's conversations. Talisker is also referenced in John LeCarre's \\"A Legacy of Spies,\\" as Alec Leamus' favorite. In the 2019 Amazon Prime / BBC co-production Good Omens, the demon Crowley (played by Scotsman David Tennant) drinks Talisker by the bottle as he awaits the coming apocalypse.

Sextus Julius Africanus, who visited Alexandria in the Bishoprice of Demetrius, places his accession as eleventh bishop from Mark in the tenth year of Roman Emperor Commodus; Eusebius of Caesarea places it in the tenth year of Septimus Severus.Historia Ecclesiastica, VI, 2 Life Demetrius was a farmer, who cohabited with his wife as celibates, for 47 years, until he was chosen Patriarch. According to the Synexarium, a biographical collection of the Church's saints, the ailing Patriarch Julian had a vision informing him that his successor would visit him, with a cluster of grapes, while out of season at that time of year. The next day, a farmer named Demetrius arrived with a cluster of grapes for the Bishop, asking for his blessings, and was announced next as Bishop Demetrius I, the twelfth bishop of Alexandria. Bishop Demetrius was eager to establish a fixed calendar for church fasts and feast days. He established a liturgical calendar by which fast dates were determined. As bishop of the great metropolis, Demetrius was engaged in the controversy over the canonical calculation of Easter. He was the first to apply the calculation method for determining the dates of Easter. His edict was approved by the Nicene Council (325 AD). The Oriental Orthodox churches continue to follow Alexandria. Jerome claimed that Demetrius sent Pantaenus on a mission to India, it is likely that Clement succeeded Pantaenus as head of the Catechetical School before the patriarchy of Demetrius. When Clement left Alexandria (c. 203), Demetrius appointed Origen, who was in his eighteenth year, as Clement's successor. Demetrius supported Origen in the beginning of his career, it is said to have admired his scholarship. He dispatched Origen to Arabia, upon an invitation for his visit in letters to the prefect of Alexandria. When the Emperor Caracalla sacked Alexandria in 215 AD, Origen fled to Caesarea, where the Palestinean bishops requested him to give sermons. Demetrius was enraged and wrote to rebuke that his teaching was not canonical for him, as a layman. Bishops Alexander of Jerusalem and Theoctistus of Caesarea wrote in his defense and mentioned precedents for laymen to give sermons, but despite their efforts Demetrius recalled Origen. In 230, Origen was asked to settle a dispute in Achaea which required his presence, so he set out by way of Palestine. Origen was then ordained priest at Caesarea.Eusebius, Historia Ecclesiastica VI, 23. When Demetrius learned of this, he considered it an act of emancipation, which deteriorated their relationship. Demetrius convened a synod in 232 that banished Origen, then sent a condemnation of Origen behavior to all the churches. It is evident, it was personal jealousy not merely non ordination, that have been alleged by Demetrius for such a reaction. Rome accepted the decision, but Caesarea, Phoenicia, Arabia, Achaea disputed it. From Caesarea Origen sent forth letters in his self defence, and attacked Demetrius. Demetrius then passed Catechetical School under the charge of Heraclas, an assistant of Origen, who had long been his associate. This may have been Demetrius' final act as bishop. Demetrius governed the Church of Alexandria for forty-two years, and died at the age of 105.\\"Departure of Abba Demetrius\\", Mission St. Clare Notes References * Category:2nd-century births Category:2nd-century archbishops Category:2nd-century Christian saints Category:3rd-century archbishops Category:3rd-century Christian saints Category:Christian clerical marriage Category:Saints from Roman Egypt Category:Greek Orthodox Patriarchs of Alexandria Category:Popes of the Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria ","title":"Pope Demetrius I of Alexandria"},{"id":"335411","text":"MDS or M.D.S. may refer to: Organizations * Brazilian Ministry of Social Development * Mennonite Disaster Service, a disaster relief volunteer group * Movement for Socialist Democracy (Mouvement pour la D√©mocratie Socialiste), a former political party in Burkina Faso * Movement of Socialist Democrats (Mouvement des D√©mocrates Socialistes), a political party in Tunisia =Companies= * MDS America, a telecommunications company * MDS Gateways, a telecommunications company in Ireland * MDS Inc., a healthcare company * Microwave Data Systems, a wireless modem company * Mohawk Data Sciences Corporation, a computer company Science and technology * Minimum detectable signal, a measure of sensitivity * Molybdenum disulfide, a compound added to some plastics to make parts more slippery * Multi-Displacement System, a Chrysler automobile technology =Computing= * .mds, a file extension associated with disk image descriptions * MDS 2400, a computer * Mandriva Directory Server, an LDAP server * Microsoft SQL Server Master Data Services, a database management product * mds, a daemon in macOS Spotlight * Microarchitectural Data Sampling, a set of vulnerabilities in Intel processors * Cisco MDS, a line of Fibre Channel switches =Medicine= * Miller‚ÄìDieker syndrome, a neurological disorder * Minimum Data Set, information collected for US Medicare/Medicaid asessement * Myelodysplastic syndrome =Mathematics= * Martingale difference sequence, in probability theory * Maximum distance separable code, in mathematical coding theory * Multidimensional scaling, a statistical technique Other uses * MDs (TV series), a 2002 American medical drama * Marathon des Sables, an ultramarathon held in Morocco * Master of Dental Surgery * Meridian Southern Railway, in Mississippi, US * Mission Design Series, a United States Department of Defense aerospace vehicle designation * Middle Caicos Airport, IATA code * Miriam Defensor Santiago (born 1945), former senator of the Philippines ","title":"MDS"},{"id":"335419","text":"West End Games (WEG) was a company that made board, role-playing, and war games. It was founded by Daniel Scott Palter in 1974 in New York City, but later moved to Honesdale, Pennsylvania. Its current and past product lines include Star Wars, Paranoia, Torg, DC Universe, and Junta.  History  West End Games was named after the bar in which the meeting that finalized its founding occurred: the West End Bar near Columbia University. Initially a producer of board wargames, the company began producing roleplaying games in 1984 with Paranoia. The high production values demanded by the wargames industry made them one of the few companies who could compete with TSR, and they were able to acquire the license from Columbia Pictures to produce an RPG based on the film Ghostbusters. This game, Ghostbusters: A Frightfully Cheerful Roleplaying Game, formed the basis of the D6 System which was to be heavily used in many of their licensed products. In 1987, the company released their Star Wars role-playing game. Since the films had been released some years previously, and there was (at the time) no new media forthcoming, the success of these books came as a surprise. The game established much of the groundwork of what later became the Star Wars expanded universe. Lucasfilm considered their sourcebooks so authoritative that when Timothy Zahn was hired to write what became the Thrawn trilogy, he was sent a box of West End Games Star Wars books and directed to utilize the background material presented within. Zahn's trilogy, in turn, renewed interest in the franchise and provided further sales for West End Games. 1990 saw the release of the Torg roleplaying game, followed in 1994 by the Masterbook system, which was mostly used in licensed RPG adaptations: Indiana Jones, Necroscope, Species, Tales from the Crypt, Tank Girl, and World of Aden. Another licensed game, the Hercules & Xena Roleplaying Game was the last title released by the initial version of the company: in July 1998, West End Games went into bankruptcy, following mismanagement between West End Games and its then-parent company, shoe importer Bucci Retail Group. When the parent company filed for bankruptcy, West End Games was forced to go under as well. =D6 Legends= The bankrupt West End Games became WEG / Creative Design Group while a new West End Games (D6 Legends, Inc.) was formed in partnership with Yeti, a French design house and publisher and subsidiary of Humanoids Publishing, in March 1999. Under court supervision, WEG / Creative Design Group sold off product and assets to pay off debt. WEG / Creative Design Group sold to the new company intellectual property, the Paranoia licensing contracts, and the trademarks. Licensing contracts for Indiana Jones, Star Wars and Xena remained with Creative Design Group, though the Star Wars license was soon lost to Wizards of the Coast, who released their own Star Wars game in 2000. As Humanoids Publishing was the publisher of the Metabarons graphic novels, they utilized the D6 System to release an RPG based upon that setting. At the 1999 GAMA Trade Show, the new West End Games announced a third edition of Paranoia for late June or early July of that year, followed by a Bug Sector supplement, but these were never released. The DC Universe license was acquired and a new RPG was also announced at that time, which was published in 1999. On July 1, 2002, the company made its systems‚ÄîD6 Classic, D6 Legend, MasterBook, and Torg‚Äîavailable via license to any publisher. = Purgatory Publishing = In November 2003 West End Games was bought by Eric J. Gibson's Purgatory Publishing. He moved the company to Downingtown, Pennsylvania, in 2004. Under his tenure, Torg received a revised edition and a generic version of the D6 System was produced, which led to a line of irregularly produced supplements and met with general approval from fans. However, this did not translate into high sales; in a post on the official West End forums in 2008 Gibson announced that none of the D6 products produced since he acquired West End had turned a profit, and West End's other RPG lines were not performing as well as he had expected, leading to losses of hundreds of thousands of dollars. West End also expanded back into board games, beginning with a new edition of Junta, which according to Gibson was one of the few products that did turn a profit. In 2007, the company announced a new science-fiction RPG by Bill Coffin called Septimus, offering preorders, but following delays it was publicly cancelled by Gibson in March 2008. Gibson stated in July 2008 that West End Games could not afford to provide refunds to customers who preordered the cancelled Septimus product, and indeed could not even afford to pay the postage to ship books to individuals who were willing to accept a refund in the form of products instead of money. Following the Septimus cancellation and fan backlash, Gibson said that he was planning on selling all of WEG's properties, although this did not occur at that time. WEG eventually released Septimus via PDF and print on demand. Gibson stated in a 2010 podcast interview that he was \\"perhaps foolishly optimistic\\" in assuming sales would be higher than they turned out to be because \\"the name West End Games would carry a lot of weight\\". He further stated that this led him to print more books than he could sell, books which he eventually had to destroy in order to save on storage costs. Gibson planned to release the d6 System under the terms of the Open Gaming License (OGL) to increase sales but also \\"to protect it from myself\\", meaning that if the company had to be sold or go out of business, the system would still be available to the general public. In 2009, West End Games moved forward with these plans, with the resulting license known as OpenD6. Following the Septimus project, Purgatory Publishing sold off most of their properties. In June 2010, Torg was sold to German game company Ulisses Spiele, while in July 2010 the Masterbook system, Shatterzone, and Bloodshadows were sold to Precis Intermedia. West End Games itself and its remaining properties‚Äîwhich by then consisted primarily of the D6 System‚Äîwas purchased in April 2016 by Nocturnal Media, White Wolf Publishing founder Stewart Wieck's gaming company. = Nocturnal Media = Nocturnal intended to keep the West End Games brand alive, and their first project using this branding was a revised edition of Greg Costikyan's 1984 WEG boardgame, Web and Starship. A Kickstarter was launched in April 2016 and was successfully funded, but the death of Nocturnal owner Stewart Wieck in June 2017 ultimately resulted in the cancellation of that project. A licensing deal to publish a Second Edition of the D6 System was made with Gallant Knight Games in October 2017.

In 1994 Arran Distillers was founded by Harold Currie, former director of Chivas and a D-Day veteran, with the intention of building a distillery on Arran. During the construction of the distillery, a pair of golden eagles built their nest on a cliff near the distillery; since golden eagles are a protected species, construction of the distillery was temporarily halted. The distillery, funded by private investors and the sale of bonds, opened in 1995. There used to be about fifty distilleries on the island, but most of them were \\"moonlight\\" or illegal distilleries. The most recent legally founded distillery on Arran, called \\"Lagg\\", closed in 1837. Until recently a proportion of the casks were stored in the warehouses of Springbank, due to a lack of room in the distillery, and the legal impossibility of extending the current warehouses at the Arran distillery. However, the distillery now has a storage warehouse, on site, that allows easier access to barrels. The distillery offers a cask purchase scheme which offers private individuals the opportunity to own their own cask of whisky, which can be stored on site at the distillery. The Arran distillery is a patron of the World Robert Burns Federation and as such has created a Robert Burns single malt and Robert Burns blended whisky in honour of Scotland's national poet. They are the only whisky distillery to be able to use the image and signature of Robert Burns on their packaging. The whisky of Arran is mostly used to produce their single malt whisky, but a small proportion also goes into the production of their range of blended whiskies: Lochranza Blend, Robert Burns Blend and Arran Gold Single Malt Whisky Cream Liqueur. The Arran distillery traded at a loss for many years until 2010. In 2003 Currie sold his shares and resigned from the board, the remaining shareholders own the business known as Isle of Arran Distillers Ltd., and the managing director is Euan Mitchell. 2010 saw the release of a 15th Anniversary bottling on the occasion of the distillery open day on 3 July. Autumn 2010 also saw the release of the first official 14-year-old to be released by the distillery. The first peated Arran single malt (called Machrie Moor) has been available since 8 December 2010. The distillery celebrated its 21st anniversary in June 2016. Lagg Plans for the company to build a second distillery in Lagg at the south end of the island were approved in August 2016 and building work began on this project in October 2016. Lagg Distillery began production in April 2019 and opened its visitor's center on 1 July 2019. As the company has now opened a second distillery on the island the distilleries are referred to as 'Lochranza' and 'Lagg'. In May 2020 a new blended whisky was announced which is made up from whisky from both of the Arran distilleries.

The model of the continuum is a basic polarized line, with erotophobia (fear of sex or negative attitudes about sex) at one end and erotophilia (positive feelings or attitudes about sex) at the other end. The word erotophobia is derived from the name of Eros, the Greek god of erotic love, and Phobos, Greek (œÜœåŒ≤ŒøœÇ) for \\"fear\\". Researchers occasionally use the term \\"sex-negative\\" interchangeably with erotophobia and \\"sex-positive\\" interchangeably with erotophilia. Types Erotophobia has many manifestations. An individual or culture can have one or multiple erotophobic attitudes. Some types of erotophobia include fear of nudity, fear of sexual images, negative attitudes towards homosexuality, fear of sex education, fear of sexual discourse.John Ince \\"The Politics of Lust\\" (2005 edition ; 2003 edition ) Clinical erotophobia As a clinical phobia, 'erotophobia' describes an irrational and potentially debilitating fear of some object, person or act that is related to sex. This fear either impairs a person's desire or ability to have sexual relationships, or completely prevents a person's ability to have sex. Erotophobia can also in some (but not all) individual cases, be a part of larger patterns of any of the following psychological problems--social phobia, avoidant personality disorder, body dysmorphic disorder, or general social anxiety problems. Erotophobia can also, for others, be very specific to love making with another person and not be related to any of these other social anxiety disorders. In the case of specific erotophobia, only the fear of something related to sex would be present without any other fears or syndromes. Psychological studies In psychological studies, the term is often used to describe degree of (general) sexual aversion versus (general) interest in sex. In this sense erotophobia is descriptive of one's place in a range on a continuum (theory) of sexual feeling or aversion to feeling. Erotophobes score high on one end of the scale that is characterized by expressions of guilt and fear about sex. Psychologists sometimes attempt to describe sexuality on a personality scale. Erotophobes are less likely to talk about sex, have more negative reactions to sexually explicit material, and have sex less frequently and with fewer partners over time. In contrast, erotophiles score high on the opposite end of the scale, erotophilia, which is characterized by expressing less guilt about sex, talking about sex more openly, and holding more positive attitudes toward sexually explicit material. This dimension of personality is used to assess openness to sex and sexuality. It is an important dimension to measure because of the health and safety risks associated with poor sexual education. Research on this personality dimension has shown a correlation between high erotophobia scores and a less consistent use of contraception and a lack of knowledge about human sexuality. It is also important because erotophobia has been shown to create relationship and marital difficulties in multiple studies, dating back to Kinsey.  Political use  The word erotophobia has been used by anti-oppression activists to describe sex-negative attitudes as a form of discrimination and oppression (akin to homophobia). In \\"Disability, Sex Radicalism, and Political Agency\\", Abby Wilkinson argues that \\"constraints on sexual agency should be recognized as a hallmark of oppression.\\" In \\"Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack of Sexual Conservatism\\" (after Peggy McIntosh's influential \\"White Privilege: Unpacking the Invisible Knapsack\\"), TJ Bryan says, \\"Since power-based hierarchies in society form a matrix of domination, I understand that erotophobia occupies a supportive space adjacent to isms and phobias like classism, racism, sexism, ableism, homophobia.\\" In his book The Politics of Lust, author and sexual activist John Ince examines three distinct cause and effect forces that fuel erotophobia: \\"antisexualism,\\" the irrational negative response to harmless sexual expression; \\"nasty sex,\\" which includes rape and violent pornography; and \\"rigidity,\\" the inability to enjoy \\"playful and spontaneous\\" sex. Ince also argues that social inequality and politics are interlinked with erotophobia and that overcoming erotophobia is one of the first steps to a truly democratic society.

By Speedword Dutton meant a word in his constructed language.\\" is an international auxiliary language as well as an abbreviated writing system using the English alphabet for all the languages of the world. It was devised by Reginald J. G. Dutton (born 8 November 1886 in Nottingham, UK; died 23 June 1970, Skegness, UK) who initially ran a shorthand college promoting Dutton Shorthand (a geometric script), then offered a mail order (correspondence) self-education course in Speedwords while still supporting the Dutton Shorthand. The business was continued by his daughter Elizabeth after his death. Requirements for communication Any transcription, note taking or correspondence system must fulfill six requirements (Oliver, 2019, Micro- intellectual capital: A case study of Dutton Speedwords): :1. Rules for ensuring an agreed vocabulary, how additions are included, and, how technical terms are expressed :2. Systematic method for representing the vocabulary including abbreviations or contractions or truncations, particularly where literal transcription is necessary :3. A pronunciation system that makes the vocalisation meaningful :4. A meaningful word order :5. Rule for designating or rejecting parts of speech :6. A method for learning the new system of communication Ideally, these requirements should not be wholly biased toward English but consider European, Asian and Middle East languages. The system of Speedwords created over 50 years by Dutton addresses all these requirements. Other systems have copied the solutions devised by Dutton without greatly improving his approach. One major advantage of Dutton's Speedwords is that it is readily available to everyone. Its current competitors either require pre- payment for materials before revealing the full details of their system, or, have system that is a subset of the words necessary for a complete system. Objectives of Speedwords Over time, three objectives were claimed by Dutton for Speedwords: Initially, Dutton proposed Speedwords as an International Auxiliary Language (often abbreviated IAL) to encourage people to communicate internationally. Dutton wanted to provide a system so that a sender could use which did not require them to learn the (foreign) language used by the recipient before establishing communication. Speedwords achieves this by relying on a deliberately small vocabulary. For international communication, the writer and reader are different, so, it is important that communication is unambiguous. Then Dutton promoted Speedwords for high-speed writing. This used ideas and experience based on Dutton Shorthand. Dutton developed this stenographic method between 1919 and 1926. This approach also assumed that the writer and reader were different. Up to this time, Speedwords avoided synonyms. Synonyms are variants of the same English word and treated them as equivalent. There are two possibilities: (1) One Speedword for different parts of speech. For example, 'hon' refers to sincere, sincerely, sincerity). (2) The same Speedword covers several different English words (e.g., 'kla' means class, kind, or sort. There are also derivatives of Speedwords (e.g., 'bi' means life but there is also 'bie' lively, bik vital, 'bir' creature, 'biu' welfare, 'biv' spirit, 'bix' death, 'bixk' fatal, 'bixy' kill, 'bixya' murder. Later, realising that some writing required literal transcription, Dutton expanded the vocabulary to allow words which are synonyms that were required to precisely distinguish shades of meaning. Dutton offered two methods to distinguish these synonyms which were required for literal transcription. The first was to use an initial capital letter. The capital letter indicates the Speedword is being used to denote a specific word not the range of words covered by a Speedword. These were officially recognised by being listed in the Speedwords Dictionary. The second method was to underline the Speedword. Dutton does not detail how this would work so it is assumed that this was left to the discretion of the Speedwords user. Finally, Dutton promoted Speedwords for individual (personal) note writing and note reading. This approach assumed that the writer and reader were mostly the same person. Dutton encouraged this group of users to adopt some personal conventions to adapt it to their personal needs (e.g., underlining). The widely available \\"Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords\\" (original 1951 edition and revised 1971 edition, but paragraph 4 in both editions) was focused on the note taking and note making objective although Dutton still claimed it could also be used to fulfill the other objectives. See below for how these objectives were used to construct Speedwords. Usage There are three possible uses: writing, speaking including dictation, and, note taking = Writing = This was the original use intended by Dutton. Speedwords would allow peoples with different national languages to communicate using Speedwords as the medium. This would be accomplished because it had a compact vocabulary and rigid meanings to avoid ambiguity. All versions of Speedwords were customised for writing and minimising the number of letters that had to be written. =Speaking including dictation= Criticisms in 1935-6 of the predecessor of Speedwords (called International 2 Letter Script which had many combinations of consonants) were focused on the difficulty in pronouncing strings of consonants. Speedwords overcame this deficiency. =Note taking= \\"Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords\\" adapted Speedwords to note taking. It modified the standard Speedwords from written correspondence without any time pressure to allow taking notes at high speed. Competitors to Speedwords There are three competitors to Speedwords. They are (1) shorthand as simplified letterforms, (2) shorthand as picture symbols, and, (3) shorthand using non-stenographic systems (that is, alphabetic characters). Simplified letterforms are also called stenographic shorthand systems. One type of letterform geometric is based on circles, parts of circles, and straight lines placed strictly horizontally, vertically or diagonally. The most popular example is Pitman shorthand released 1837, and many lesser-known systems such as Boyd's syllabic shorthand originally published 1903, as well as predecessor systems such as Duployan Shorthand. These use symbols which do not represent letters, but rather sounds so the words are written more or less as they are spoken. Contrasted with geometric are script shorthands that are oriented around the movement of the hand when writing. The original is Gabelsberger shorthand which began in Germany and spread through Europe. Script-geometric, or semi-script, shorthands are a hybrid of geometric systems and the script systems. The notable example is Gregg shorthand first published in 1888. Other examples include Superwrite, Easyscript, Keyscript, Speedwriting, Quickscript, Breviogrph, Stenoscript ABC, and Teeline. Picture symbols were proposed by Austrian Charles K. Bliss (1897‚Äì1985) who created Blissymbolics in 1949 as a universal written language for speakers of any language to learn and communicate. It avoided the problems of constructed quasi-European language like Esperanto, or, natural languages such as English. Blissymbolics was conceived as a purely visual, speech-less language but provided a basic vocabulary that could be spoken. Non-stenographic systems or alphabetic systems may also supplement the alphabetic characters by using punctuation marks as additional characters, give different meanings when letters are capitalised, or add non-alphabetic symbols. The most popular of these is Esperanto. Dutton contrasted Speedwords with its major rival Esperanto by claiming correctly that Speedwords had a smaller vocabulary and did not require the extensive study that was required to converse or write Esperanto. Another rapid writing system with a similar name, Speedwriting (also called Brief English Systems) was invented by Emma Dearborn at Simmons College, Columbia University and published in 1925. Her method used letters of the alphabet and some punctuation marks to represent the sounds of English which could be reproduced on the typewriter. Dearborn initially franchised teaching and then sold the rights which passed between various companies who made further changes and marketed it throughout the US and in various languages (e.g., Spanish). Other methods included Personal Shorthand also known as Briefscript, and Keyscript. Forkner Shorthand was promoted as an alternative to Pitman shorthand from 1955‚Äì1995 but is no longer taught. The benchmark for pronunciation is the International Phonetic Alphabet (IPA) produced by the International Phonetic Association. It is easily printable by hand or keyboard although its conventions are often not used to depict pronunciation in dictionaries and other reference materials. The major reason that Dutton Speedwords continues to receive attention is its strict alphabetical constraint that allows it to be used on a keyboard, and its breadth of practical application which Dutton embodied in his system. Design of Speedwords The design of Speedwords has four features: :1. Unlike other shorthand methods, (e.g., Pitman, Gregg) which use new symbols, strokes or geometric shapes, Speedwords method uses the 26 letters of the English alphabet (upper and lower case) plus the ampersand symbol ('&'). :2. Unlike most other shorthand and rapid writing methods, Speedwords has its roots in a shorthand system that Dutton found cumbersome and which he believed he overcame by using alphabetic characters. :3. Unlike other shorthand and rapid writing systems, Dutton emphasised the speed of learning. :4. Like other shorthand systems, Dutton sought to maximise speed and minimise the amount of writing. Principles of Speedwords In all publications, Dutton describes various principles of Speedwords but there is no consolidated list of principles. They can be summarised as: :1. Select its vocabulary from the entire Indo-European language family, particularly maximising the internationality of words, that is, selecting a word that is common between languages, (Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords, 1951, page 90). :2. Abbreviate those words guided by a 1925 analysis by Horn on the frequency of words. The most frequently used words were allocated the shorted abbreviation. So the most frequent words have just one letter (Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords, 1951, page 5). :3. Structure the vocabulary around high frequency words. A 1,000 word vocabulary handles 85% of daily conversation while a 3,000 word vocabulary handles 98% of daily conversation so Speedwords only needs a simple rule for 2% of its vocabulary. Dutton seems to suggest that the solution is to write out the word in full. :4. Make one Speedword have only one meaning which results in a basic vocabulary which Dutton calls 'keywords' (Speedwords Dictionary, 1945, page 7). :5. Avoid grammatical differences, so a keyword can also refer to noun, verb, adjective, adverb (Speedwords Dictionary, 1945, page 5). :6. Create other meanings by adding suffixes to show relationships or create antonyms (Speedwords Dictionary, 1945, page 3). While this approach is sound it has both advantages and a few disadvantages discussed below. Speedwords was meant to be written and spoken, so Dutton provided some guidelines on pronunciation which is included below. Advantages In Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords, Dutton claims at least eight benefits from Speedwords: :1. Knowing just a few Speedwords (he means the one letter Speedwords) allows immediate savings in time and effort (Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords 1951, page 7). The words can be substituted for the English equivalents as the Speedwords vocabulary is learnt. This contrasts with geometric shorthand shapes that require the entire system to be mastered. :2. It uses the English alphabet. This means it Speedwords can be written or typed (TYDS, page 8). :3. It uses a range of Indo-European words. So, its vocabulary has an \\"international currency\\" (page 87). :4. Speedwords are chosen based on the frequency of usage. This means that the most frequently used words are the shortest (TYDS, page 7). :5. Correspondence can be exchanged although the individual writers without having to learn the foreign language of all their many correspondents. This means the writers can be ignorant of the language of their correspondent (TYDS, page 8). :6. Knowing speed words takes between 20 and 30 hours (TYDS, pages 9, 90). The work of learning \\"is a fascinating pastime and in no sense an arduous task\\" (TYDS, page 9) :7. Speedwords makes 5 out of 6 words far shorter (page 87). This increases the speed of writing and note taking approximately 100-120 words per minute (page 137) or up to 150 wpm (page 8). :8. The 'hurdle' to overcome language barriers is considerably reduced because the Speedwords vocabulary is small. The basic vocabulary is 493 words (page 89). The more extensive vocabulary is 1,000 words (page 142) Disadvantages The disadvantages appear to be: :1. No-one is developing Speedwords, so authoritative information about it is now hard to find, except for the Teach yourself Dutton Speedwords book. Some have taken Speedwords and adapted it. For example, see Briefscript by Ray Brown athttp://www.carolandray.plus.com/Briefscript/index.html :2. The Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords book does not have a full discussion of pronunciation which Dutton suggests is essential to using Speedwords. Hearsay is that Dutton had a simplified pronunciation system which may have been shared with some inquirers after his death, but it was never published :3. Dutton did not disclose the rules he used to formulate Speedwords so some apparent anomalies and obscurities exist. So, Dutton appears to make arbitrary decisions on the choice of a Speedword. For example, on page 25 Dutton states that 'ao' means 'away' although 'ax' would be logical. However, 'ax' has already been used to mean 'ask'. This shows that over 50 years Dutton had not reached 100% perfection of his system. This is consistent with the effort required to be expended to fully complete as shown by the Pareto Principle. Also, on TYDS, page 25 Dutton used the Speedword 'dy' for since but gives the rationale French 'depuis' but it does not contain 'y' and in French could also translate to 'for' which has the Speedword 'f'. :4. Some guidelines stated in Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords book are difficult to apply. For example, Dutton allows the reader to use synonyms for the basic Speedwords and distinguishes them from the basic speedwords by capitalising their first letter. Also, for example, English 'at' becomes the Speedword 'A' because Speedword 'a' means 'to' (TYDS, page72). Dutton says the reader can create her or his own supplementary list but does not detail how this is done or how she or he manages it. None of these disadvantages prevent its successful use for personal note taking. Achievements of Dutton Dutton Speedwords continues to be referred to despite its orphan status because of his achievements: :1. He preferred to keep the vocabulary compact using frequency of use as the criteria. :2. He provided a proven learning approach (incremental learning with repetition) which makes it easy to master. :3. He persevered with it over a long period (1933‚Äì1970) so it was refined with experience and feedback. Evolution of speedwords It appears that Speedwords developed in five main stages: :1. As a competitor to Pitman and Gregg shorthand. Based on the available Dutton shorthand publications held in libraries this occurred 1919‚Äì1925. At this point, it was a geometric shorthand method that competed with Pitman and Gregg shorthand methods and did not use the English alphabet. :2. Under the influence of Horn's frequently used words list, an early attempt was made to develop an alternate international abbreviated language. Dutton expressed this in his one-page sheet called International 2-letter correspondence symbols (published 1933). :3. Further development occurred to create an alternate international language. It began in 1935 when International 2-letter correspondence symbols were revised and reissued in 1935 as International Symbolic Script. Another version called Word Speedwords was published between 1941‚Äì1945 (page 18 of Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords). There is a booklet of the same name published in 1946 which appears to contain 100 Speedwords. Despite attempts by Dutton to popularise World Speedwords it was not adopted as an international language. The intention expressed on page 88 in Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords (1951) to produce language-specific versions of the Speedwords course, did not eventuate. It appears another variation called Dutton Youth Speedwords was published in 1943. Both World Speedwords and Speedwords used words from Flemish (Dutch), French, German, Greek, Latin, Portuguese, Scandinavia, Slav, and Spanish are sources for both World Speedwords and Speedwords (According to pages 8, and 88 of Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords, 1951 and 1971). :4. By 1946 it had been renamed Speedwords. By 1951 Dutton conceded that Speedwords was ideal for individual note taking and note making (page 7 Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords) and made some variations to Word Speedwords to adapt it for the new purpose (page 8 Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords). His audience is, therefore, students and time-poor people seeking to make the best use of their time or people who incur high costs in communication. He comments that he hopes that \\"the student who has worked through the present course will look to this wide horizon (page 88) that is, international communication so Dutton always maintained his duality of objectives and functions. :5. It has been revived from time to time in its own right as well as with adaptations. The Dutton Society (no longer extant) promoted Speedwords. Some time management writers and computer specialists who describe online applications including e-mail and situations where communication is either slow or expensive. Foreign-language versions of Speedwords In Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords (page 88), Dutton says that \\"It is intended to publish this Speedwords course in all the major languages of both hemispheres.\\" This did not occur. It is unclear whether the impediment was (a) problems that equivalents (including the use of suffixes) were not suitable in foreign languages, (b) authors of the foreign-language versions of Speedwords were not forthcoming, (c) lack of a publisher, or (d) anomalies and difficulties became apparent when Speedwords was translated, making the English- and foreign-language version no longer in uniform. Sources describing Dutton Speedwords There are three main sources of information about Speedwords: (1) Speedwords publications issued by Dutton, (2) the Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords book in the Teach Yourself series and (3) third party publications and commentaries (see the references). =Dutton publications= All the Dutton Speedwords booklets published between 1933 and 1951 are out of print. Very few libraries show holdings of copies. Helpful booklets used in preparing this page were the Speedwords dictionary.\\"Dutton, Reginald 1945 Dutton Speedwords Dictionary, (Third edition). London: Dutton Publications\\" It consists of 4,000 basic and with derivatives 10,000 English- Speedword and Speedword-English words. A more accessible version focused on note taking and note making called Dutton Speedwords was published in 1951 in the Teach Yourself series published by English Universities Press as a hardcover. It was reprinted in 1959 and 1962 (with the distinctive yellow dustjacket for both years). A revised edition was published in 1971. It was reissued in 1973 as a paperback. The only revisions made in 1971 were in Part 1 of the high-speed vocabulary appendix (pages 137‚Äì147). Part 2 of the High- Speed appendix which is aimed solely at English speakers was unchanged between the original 1951 and revised 1971 editions. Copies of the 1951 and 1971 editions are relatively easy to find second hand. The 1951 edition and its 1962 reprint are printed on higher quality paper than the updated 1971/1973 edition which has yellowed pages that easily tear. Both editions have misprints. This is an incomplete list: :1. Paragraph number 83 occurs twice: once in Lesson 8, and, also in the High-Speed Appendix. :2. Lists in Speedwords are frequently not in alphabetical order: for example, 'fon' and 'for' in the Alphabetic Speedwords list is out of order (page 94). =Third party publications= The references below list some third-party publications and commentaries that are still available. Many other webpages have been lost and are no longer available. These missing webpages included the Dutton Society, the Robert Petry pages when he was promoting Speedwords in approximately 1997, and pages by the New Congress/Der Neue Kongress s.Z. who promised a new revised edition of Dutton's Speedwords. However, there is no record of a library holding the reissued publication by New Congress/Der Neue Kongress s.Z. Timeline of Speedwords Dutton was assiduous in developing Speedwords and its predecessor Dutton shorthand. After developing Dutton shorthand, Dutton continued to improve it. But then realising the shortcomings of using shorthand, Dutton develops Dutton Shorthand. Dutton Shorthand was also revised many times. Dutton never gave up refining Speedwords, advocating its merits, and offering it for sale and as a correspondence course. Below is a selection of publications that Dutton produced over his lifetime. =Shorthand publications= : 1915 Dutton 24-hour shorthand (First edition). : 1916 Dutton Shorthand as a competitor [to Pitman and Gregg shorthand called \\"Shorthand in Three Days\\" [with Key]. : 1917 Dutton 24-hour shorthand (Second edition).

These are Speedword stems or elements (TYDS, page 88, 89, 137). * 1,000 Speedwords. These are the most frequently used words (TYDS, page 141). * 4,000 Speedwords. These are the words in the Speedwords Dictionary (TYDS, page 87). * 10,000 Speedwords. These are derivatives of Speedwords (TYDS, page 91). =Method of learning= Speedwords was taught as a correspondence course by both Dutton and his daughter in the pre and post-war period. Their course was supported by an extensive array of booklets that he had developed. Many of the booklets are listed in the timeline section. The option of enrolling in a course offered directly by Dutton's organisation or third parties is no longer available. Several system such as Forkner shorthand emphasised replacing some longhand writing with shortcuts as soon as they begin studying the system. Many systems also claimed it was possible to achieve dictation rates above 50 words per minute. These all have learning times of a year or more. Learning Dutton Speedwords takes around a week to a fortnight. In TYDS (page 9) Dutton cites his records which show that learning the takes between 20 and 24 hours with 30 hours being the maximum. Dutton agrees that individual Speedwords can be substituted one or two at a time. However, Dutton believes that the entire Speedwords system can be learnt quickly and therefore it is not necessary to learn it piecemeal. Some websites provide summaries of Speedwords (that is, the one and two-letter Speedwords). Some websites provide illustrations or highlights of the method. They are not recommended because they either mis- state Dutton or are incomplete. The chief characteristic of Dutton Speedwords is its detail and the extensive guidelines Dutton provides in his booklets. =Resources for learning= A few lucky people may be able to read some of the Speedwords booklets Dutton published between 1940‚Äì1951. The booklets promote the other booklets which were available but do not explain their interrelationship. So this is a brief description on how to use them. Essentially there are four interrelated booklets. All four are required. They are: (1) The \\"textbook\\". (2) The \\"companion\\". It provides additional exercises and the answers to exercises in the textbook. (3) The \\"supplement\\". It provides further exercises with answers to enhance learning through additional practice (4) The bi-lingual vocabulary. This is an alphabetic list of Speedwords (between 3,00 and 10,000 depending upon the edition) with their English equivalent, as well as an English-to-Speedwords lookup list. The vocabulary contains an introductory commentary by Dutton which is valuable for understanding and using the dictionary. Depending upon when they were published, they may be called \\"Dutton Speedwords, \\"Dutton Double Speedwords\\", \\"Duttom Youth Speedwords\\" or \\"Dutton World Speeedwords\\". They were published at different times with different titles and contain minor differences. There is usually more than one edition of each. Later editions (1946 or preferably 1951) are the most complete and up-to-date. They usually contain an explanation of any changes made in the latest edition. The most common authoritative source is \\"Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords\\". It is focused on note taking (page 2, paragraph 4). It contains eight lessons, an appendix and a dictionary with about 1,00 speedwords. International versus English/domestic use of Speedwords One important factor that can affect learning is whether communication is between speakers of Indo-European languages. Learning Speedwords is affected by background. It is oriented to the English language in its vocabulary and sentence construction. Dutton claims (TYDS, page 90) that memorisation will be slower for non-Indo-European language speakers, they will be able to extend their vocabulary as easily once the vocabulary is mastered. This means the learner must always be conscious of whether Dutton is describing Speedwords to be used in international communication or the English only use. The English-only use makes concessions that are counterproductive to international communication. Those concessions can be summarised as: :1. Using selected synonyms found in English which are designated by the word being given a capital letter. For example, 'O' for 'sir' (TYDS, page 35, para 35). :2. Recognising an even wider range of synonyms and additional words that are not distinguished in any way from the internationally usable Speedwords (See, for example, TYDS, pages 148-154). :3. Abbreviating some Speedwords (contractions) which may be inconsistent with international use. For example, 'Bil' for 'bill' when there already is 'bil' used for 'account'. :4. Using Speedwords with abbreviations which will be meaningless in international use. For example, omit the 'i' from 'bil' (TYDS, page 141, para 85). :5. Creating compounds with additional suffixes. For example, the new suffix '-c' is used to -tion, tious, -cious, -tial, ture, -sure while '-m' is used to express -ment, (TYS, page 152, rule 14). :6. Creating compounds of Speedwords which may be inconsistent with international use. For example, 'ze' + 'nav' is abbreviated 'zev' (page 56, para 60). Consequently, the learner of Speedwords needs to be aware that some of the extensions they make and use, may inhibit rather than facilitate international communication. Lexicon The principle behind the choice of word roots of Dutton Speedwords is the maxim that frequently used words should be shorter than seldom-used words in order to speed up communication (see information theory). There are 493 one-, two- and three-letter roots. The 46 most frequent English words are equated with 27 one-letter Speedword roots also called parent words in the Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords book: :a \\"at, to\\" (< French √†) :b \\"but, butt\\" (< English) :c \\"this\\" (< French ce) :d \\"of, from\\" (< French de) :e \\"to be, is, am, are\\" (< French est) :f \\"for\\" (< English) :g \\"they, them\\" :h \\"has, have\\" (< English?) :i \\"in, within\\" (< English) :j \\"I, me\\" (< French je) :k \\"that\\" [conjunction] (< French que) :l \\"the\\" (< French le) :m \\"with\\" (< German mit) :n \\"no, not\\" (< English) :o \\"on\\" (< English) :p \\"can, to be able\\" (< French peut) :q \\"do (question particle), question, query\\" (< English) :r \\"will, shall\\" (< ?) :s \\"he, him\\" (< French se) ::sh \\"she, her\\" (< English) :t \\"it\\" (< English) :u \\"a, an, one\\" (< Latin unus) :v \\"you\\" (< French vous) :w \\"we, us\\" (< English) :x \\"whether, if\\" :y \\"was, were\\" :z \\"as, then\\" (< English? \\"zen\\"?) :& \\"and\\" (< English) Some two- and three-letter words are :good -- gu :know -- sa :love -- am :beautiful -- bel :language -- lin :game, play -- lud (Note that all but the first of these examples are taken from Latin roots --sapio, amo, bellus, lingua, ludus--as are \\"room\\" and \\"sleep\\" below--camera and dormio--while \\"good\\" and the root for \\"air\\" below come from German: gut, luft.) The few hundred roots are combined through the use of affixes to expand vocabulary. For example: the affix -a indicates an unfavorable connotation to the root-word; thus, bixy = kill, bixya = murder. Some compounds appear fanciful, or at least not immediately transparent, such as ky + luf (eat + air) to mean \\"picnic\\". Grammatical features include the use of single letters (as opposed to verb conjugations) to indicate tense; the letter r indicates future tense and y indicates past. Thus, j sa = I know, j ysa = I knew, j r sa = I will know. Nouns and verbs have the same form (as do many English words: the light, I light, etc.) as do adverbs and adjectives (bel = \\"beautiful\\" and \\"beautifully\\"). Compounds follow a headnoun-modifier sequence, as in ca + dor (room + sleep) = bedroom. Phonology and orthography Dutton orthography is irregular. It is combined with phonology below. =Stress= Stress is on the first syllable (first vowel), except that the opposite suffix -o is always stressed, and the verbal prefixes u- (present participle) and y- (past tense) are never stressed.Dutton Speedwords: Pronunciation, page 1. Compiled by Raymond Brown from \\"Dutton World Speedwords\\" (3rd ed. 1946) and \\"Dutton Double-Speed Words Companion to Text\\" (3rd ed. 1946). =Vowels= Vowels are rather similar to Latin. When a vowel occurs at the end of a morpheme or before another vowel, it is long, otherwise, it is usually short (though some suffixes shorten a preceding morpheme-final vowel).Raymond Brown Dutton Speedwords: Pronunciation, pages 1 & 2. {class=wikitable !Letteraeiouauy - - !Long \\"ah\\" \\"eh\\" \\"ee\\" \\"oh\\" \\"oo\\" rowspan=2\\"ow\\" rowspan=2\\"might\\" rowspan=2\\"sofa\\" - !Short \\"at\\" The 'short a' is probably meant to be the northern English and Midlands [a] rather than southern English [”ï]; see Raymond Brown Dutton Speedword Pronunciation, page 1 \\"get\\" \\"it\\" \\"od\\" \\"put\\" } Vowel length for the most part not phonemic, but are determined by position. However, there is morphophonemic contrast in a few cases where a root word contrasts with a suffixed word, with suffixes that do not shorten the vowel. For example, :pad \\"paid\\" (pa \\"pay\\" + -d passive participle) vs pad \\"pad\\"; :sud\\" \\"improved' ( \\"su\\" + -d passive participle) vs sud \\"sudden\\".Raymond Brown Speedwords pronunciation is complicated: Vowels Only au and y are diphthongs. Other sequences of vowels are pronounced in separate syllables, e.g. eis \\"ice\\" is .Dutton Speedword Pronunciation, page 1 \\"CHECK YOUR PRONUNCIATION 364 Vowel sequences in roots are ei, eu, oi, oe, ui, ue, ia, io, iu. The sequences ie, uo are found in written contractions, but may not be pronounced that way since all written contractions should be pronounced in full. \\"Y\\" is a consonant in ye \\"yes\\" and in y \\"was, were\\" only. =Consonants= Consonants are mostly as in the IPA; e.g., s is always voiceless, as in \\"less\\", g is always hard, as in \\"get\\", and r is trilled, as in Scots and Italian. Exceptions: *c is (as in \\"itch\\") *j is (as in French) *q is (as in \\"quick\\") *sh is (as in English) *x is (as in English) Words spelled as a single consonant are usually pronounced as that consonant plus a \\"very short ee\\" before a vowel, and as that consonant + schwa otherwise, clearly mirroring Dutton's pronunciation of the e in \\"the.\\"Dutton Speedword Pronunciation, page 5 The suffixes -r (agent) and -z (plural) are pronounced with a preceding schwa when they follow a consonant.Dutton Speedword Pronunciation, page 2, Suffixes 371, 372 do not occur in final position.Lack of final is presumably an accidental gap; there is also no suffix j. Lack of final reflects English phonotactics. only occurs in final position in an unwritten affix. A nasal occurs (in final position only) in two affixes, but is not written in either. (See below.) occurs initially in just two words, ye and y; finally it arguably ends the diphthong y. The letter w does not occur in final position, but arguably ends the diphthong au. Consonant sequences in word-initial position are bl, br, pl, pr, dr, tr, gl, gr, kl, kr, fl, fr, sl, q [kw], sp, st. The only consonant sequence in root-medial position is tt in otto \\"eight\\". Consonant sequences in word-final position are nd, nt, ng, lk, rb, rd, rt, rg, rk, rm, rn, st, sk, and x [ks].

It is very unlikely Dutton would have kept h and hi as homophones; but we are not told how h is now to be pronounced. Note: h (and its past tense hy and present participle hu) is used only as an auxiliary verb; \\"have/has\\" in the sense of \\"have/has got\\" is ha \\"Dutton World Speedwords\\", pages 23 & 25 (¬ß¬ß50, 51, 52), and page 28 (¬ß70) Some suffixes have an unwritten vowel that only occurs after certain consonants. They are detailed below. =Affixes= As noted above, the prefixes past-tense y- and u- do not take stress, and u- is pronounced with an unwritten engma. Me- and my- also remain unstressed when forming comparatives and superlatives, e.g. mebel \\"more beautiful\\", mybel \\"most beautiful\\".\\"Dutton World Speedwords\\", page62, ¬ß308 Suffixed vowels are long and take an epenthetic (English y) when following a vowel. For example, gree \\"awfully, extremely\\" (< are + e) is pronounced , mua \\"too (much)\\" (< mua + a) is and dau \\"allow, grant\\" (< da + u) is Dutton Speedword Pronunciation, page 2, Suffixes 368 The suffixes -n and -st are derived from the speedwords un \\"negative\\" and its \\"professional\\" and are always pronounced in full and take an epenthetic when following a vowel, e.g. gan \\"scarcely\\" (< ga + n) is and rist \\"clerk\\" (< ri + st) is .Dutton Speedword Pronunciation, pages 2 & 3, Suffixes 369 & 375 The words co \\"collect, collection\\" and za \\"dear, endearment, intimate\\" may also be used as suffixes; if appended to a word ending in a vowel, they do not shorten that vowel, e.g. lec \\"correspondence, mail\\" is and perza \\"dad(dy), papa\\" is Dutton Speedword Pronunciation, pages 2 & 3, Suffixes 369 & 375 Suffixes pronounced as a single consonant after a vowel generally shorten that vowel. The exceptions are -d, -z, -r, which leave the vowel long. (As noted above, -z and -r take an epenthetic schwa after any consonant.) Many consonants are pronounced with an unwritten vowel after certain consonants: *-d is pronounced after vowels and voiced consonants but d, and after d and voiceless consonants.Dutton Speedword Pronunciation, page 2, Suffixes 370 *-m (derived from the word om \\"article, object, thing\\") shortens a preceding vowel and is pronounced after any consonant, e.g. dam \\"donation, gift, present\\" (< da + m) is and tegm \\"cover, lid\\" (< teg + m) is Dutton Speedword Pronunciation, page 2, Suffixes 373 *Other single-consonant suffixes - -b (< ib \\"possible\\"), -g (< ig \\"general\\"), -k (< ik \\"property, quality\\", -l (< il \\"particular (e)special\\", -p (< ep \\"location, place, position, set, put\\"), -s (< is \\"complement\\") and -t (< et \\"little, small\\") - shorten the preceding vowel and, when they \\"can be articulated without difficulty\\" are pronounced as a single consonant after another consonant, otherwise they are pronounced in full as the words from they are derived after other consonants. Dutton adds that -s must always be pronounced after word ending in -k or -g \\"to avoid confusion with the suffix -x.Dutton Speedword Pronunciation, page 2, Suffixes 374 In addition, three suffixes have completely different forms after consonants and vowels:Raymond Brown Speedwords Single consonant suffixes *-f after vowels and -y after consonants *-v after vowels and -i after consonants *-x after vowels and -o after consonants f ~ -y are obviously abstracted from fy \\"cause, make, reason, render\\"; the pairs -v ~ -i and -x ~ -o appear to be arbitrary creations. Also in the pre-1951 version of Speedwords, Dutton gave the apostrophe as a possessive suffix pronounced , e.g. l mant'kap \\"the boy's head\\". But in the 1951 Dictionary Dutton list a new root word zy \\"disease\\". It is inconceivable that Dutton would have retained the apostrophe homophonous with zy \\"disease.\\" The apostrophe is retained in \\"Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords\\" (1951, 1971) but there is no indication how this is to be pronounced.Dutton Speedword Pronunciation, page 3, The Possessive Case =Irregularities to avoid homophones= The only examples specifically given by Dutton are: # \\"away\\" as an opposite of directional a \\"to\\" is ao [aÀê'joÀê] as *ax would be homophonous with ax \\"ask.\\"\\"Dutton World Speedwords\\", page 23, ¬ß49 # The agent suffix -r (< er \\"person\\") is written as the full word and pronounced with an epenthetic , when it would otherwise create a homophone with an existing word. For example, \\"maker\\" is maer to avoid confusion with mar \\"marry, marriage\\" (In \\"Dutton Double-Speed Words Companion to Text-Book\\", Dutton also gives jeer \\"judge\\" to avoid confusion with jur \\"law, legal\\"; in the 1951 Dictionary, however, \\"judge\\" is given as just Following 2 above, we may reasonably assume that if adding -b, -c, -g, -k, -l, -m, -n, -p, -s or -t, then the full word from which these are derived would have been written and pronounced with an epenthetic , thus *noib \\"noticeable\\" to avoid confusion with nob \\"celebrated, honour, note, repute\\" . Following 1 above, we may reasonably assume that this would always be the case if by adding -x a homophone would have been created. We may also assume that the same would apply to the -v ~ -i pair, i.e. if by adding -v we had a homophone, we must add -i instead; the same well have applied to the -f ~ y pair, i.e. if by adding -f we had a homophone, we must add -y {IPA[ÀàjaiÃØ}} instead; but as these suffixes derive from the word fy, it may be that Dutton, following 1 above, would have added -fy.Raymond Brown Speedwords Single consonant suffixes =Compound words= When two roots form a compound, the unwritten affix is placed after the first root. When three roots form a compound, the unwritten affix is placed after the first root. Either affix takes an epenthetic after a consonant.Dutton Speedword Pronunciation, page 3, Idea Compounds 377 & 378 Examples: :albe \\"already\\" (< al + be) is :diel \\"telephone\\" (< di + el) is :rysan \\"hospital\\" (< ry + san) is :opmekav \\"anti-aircraft\\" (< op + mek + av) is 'OPP-ish-mek-avv' :ryefki \\"gymnasium\\" (< ry + ef + ki) is Morphology and syntax Root words may function as adjectives, nouns, verb or adverbs. In \\"Dutton Speedwords Dictionary\\" (1951, London, Dutton Publications) we read: \\"The English language, like most other natural languages, is inconsistent in having separate words for the adjective 'hot' and the noun 'heat' whereas the same word 'cold' can function as either a noun or an adjective according to its context. What applies to 'cold' can logically apply also to 'hot'; consequently the Speedword he denotes either 'heat' or 'hot', according to circumstance. ... \\"Just as there is no distinction in English between the noun 'cold' and the adjective 'cold', so there is none between the adjective 'fast' and the adverb 'fast' (there being no English word 'fastly' corresponding to 'slowly'). What applies to the adjective 'fast' can logically apply also to other qualifiers, and consequently, there is no necessity to differentiate between, say, 'beautiful' and 'beautifully'. This means that, in international correspondence, the Speedword bel can convey not only 'beauty' and 'beautiful' ... but 'beautifully' as well ... \\"Verbs and nouns are similarly interchangeable, for in the same way that each of the English words 'work', 'answer' and 'praise' can function either as a verb or noun according to its environment, so can any other word have a dual role. In English the noun form of the verb 'fail' is 'failure', and of 'pay' 'payment'; but in everyday expressions such as 'without fail' and 'in his pay' the unnecessary distinction has been eliminated ... the Soeedword [sic? or speeedwords] policy is to cut the Gordian knot and make pa mean either 'pay' or 'payment', pre either 'prepare' or 'preparation', kok 'cook' or 'cookery', men 'remember' to 'memory', and so on throughout.\\"\\"Dutton Speedwords Dictionary\\", pages 5 & 6 There are, however, grammatical affixes pertinent to particular parts of speech. =Verb affixes= The present tense is unmarked, e.g. j spe \\"I speak\\". The past is marked by the unstressed prefix y- , e.g. j yspe \\"I spoke\\". Two verbs are irregular:\\"Dutton World Speedwords\\", page 34, ¬ß¬ß110, 111, 112 *to be: e \\"be, am. is, are\\"; y \\"was, were\\". *to have (perfect auxiliary): h (post-1951 pronunciation unknown) \\"has, have\\"; hy \\"had\\". The unmarked form also serves as the infinitive, e.g.sh am spe \\"she loves to speak\\"\\"Dutton World Speedwords\\", page 13, ¬ß2 There are two participles: : Present participle has prefix u- , e.g. uspe \\"speaking\\" : Perfect participle has suffix -d , e.g. sped \\"spoken\\" Only one irregular verb: the present participle of the auxiliary h is hu \\"Dutton World Speedwords\\", page 53 ¬ß241 Note: Dutton is quite clear that the prefix u forms a participle, i.e. a verbal adjective, e.g. u uspe tem 'a speaking clock', l ura on \\"the working man.\\" Indeed, he devotes five paragraphs to hammer this point home.\\"Dutton World Speedwords\\", page 53, ¬ß¬ß237-241. Dutton devotes six paragraphs\\"Dutton World Speedwords\\", pages 59 7 60, ¬ß¬ß292-297 to hammer home the difference between the English gerund (verbal noun) and the present participle. He is adamant that forms prefixed with u- may be used only as a present participle. In Speedwords the gerund must be expressed by the same form as the infinitive, i.e. the unmarked verb, e.g. g amt spe \\"they like speaking\\", gi ko & go \\"their coming and going\\" Furthermore :the continuous tenses are formed with \\"to be\\" and the unmarked verb, e.g. s e ri \\"he is writing\\"; w y ri \\"we were writing\\".\\"Dutton World Speedwords\\", pages 47 & 48, ¬ß¬ß198-200 :the perfect tenses are form with the auxiliary h and the unmarked verb, e.g. s h ri \\"he has written; g hy spe \\"they had spoken\\".\\"Dutton World Speedwords\\", page 23, ¬ß50 =Noun affixes= The plural, where necessary, is shown by the suffix -z, e.g. femz \\"women\\". Dutton is emphatic that if it is clear from context that the noun must be plural, the ending -z is not used, e.g. ud fem \\"many women\\"; cz on \\"Dutton World Speedwords\\"\\", page 55 & 56, ¬ß¬ß250-260 In the pre-1951 version pf Speedwords, the possessive of nouns is , and written with an apostrophe, e.g. l fem' ryg \\"the woman's house\\"; but in 1951, Dutton introduced a new root word zy meaning \\"disease\\". It is very unlikely that Dutton would have retained the apostrophe with the same sound. But we do not know what he subsequently did.Dutton Speedwords Pronunciation, page 3 =Adjective/ Adverb affixes= :me- comparative, more, -er (< me greater, increase, more), e.g. mebel \\"more beautiful(ly)\\" :my- superlative, most, -est (< my most), e.g. mybel \\"most beautiful(ly)\\" =Word Formative Suffixes= :-a unfavourable :-b possibility, -ible, -able (< ib possible) :-c collection (< co collect, collection) :-e augmentative :-f causative (after a vowel) (< fy cause, make, reason, render) :-g (an idea having a general relationship to the root) (< ig general) :-i association (after a consonant), possessive on pronouns :-k quality, -ic (< ik property, quality) :-l (an idea having a special relationship to the root) (< il particular, special, especial) :-m thing (< om article, object, thing) :-n negative, -less, in-, un- (< un negative) :-o contrary, opposite (after a consonant) :-p place (< ep location, place, position, put, set) :-r person, agent, -er (< er person) :-s (an idea having a complementary relationship to the root) (< is complement) :-t diminutive, -ette (< et little, small) :-u favorable :-v association (after a vowel) :-x contrary, opposite (after a vowel) :-y causative (after a consonant) (< fy cause, make, reason, render) :-z plural, -s :-st professional, -ist (< ist professional) In \\"Dutton World Speedwords\\" we are given on page 64, ¬ß328, the 'indefinite preposition' iv. But it is clear from Dutton's entry that the affixes -i and -v are not derived from this preposition but rather that the preposition is a backformation from the affixes. Dutton says [words in italics were written as italicized speedwords in the original]: \\"The prepositions 'at', 'on', 'by', 'under', etc. are sometimes used to convey a somewhat loose idea of association without any definite idea of position, as in 'at the most', 'by the way', 'on business', 'under difficulties', etc. When, therefore, any preposition is not literally applicable, the Speedword 'iv' is used. This Speedword consists of the two association suffixes 'i-' and '-v' and hence appropriately conveys the idea of association without definite sense of place.\\" =Interfixes (not written)= :- two-root compound :- three-root compound For examples see Compound words in the 'Phonology and orthography' section above. Potential improvements to Speedwords There are three potential improvements to Speedwords which would overcoming ambiguities, remove omissions or deficiencies, and overcome confusion. These were discussed.\\"Oliver, Gary R, 2019 Micro-intellectual capital: The case of Dutton Speedwords, International Conference on Intellectual Capital and Knowledge Management, Macquarie University 5 December.\\" A major ambiguity is terminological. Dutton uses three terms interchangeably in TYDS. They are 'parent word' (page 9, 88), 'radical' (page 88) 'word-root' (page 51, 52), and 'word family' (page 89). He sometimes uses them identically, to mean the stem, that is an indivisible element TYS page 88). At other times he means the indivisible element plus prefix or suffix or the compounds of indivisible elements (TYDS, page 158). By doing so he lacks the ability to distinguish between them. It would be much simpler to reserve the three terms for the indivisible element and then use the term \\"extension\\" for the addition of prefix or suffix. \\"Compound\\" would retain its existing usage. Even more confusingly he adds another term 'word familities' (TYDS, page 89). It is not clear whether this refers to the ndivisible element plus all its prefixes and suffixes. Dutton also refers to \\"keywords\\" meaning the basic or essential stem words to which prefixes and suffixes are added. So, this means there is ambiguity for the learner on what is the basic vocabulary of Speedwords. Some further research is underway to see if this can be clarified. There is an obvious omission and deficiency. These could have easily been rectified by Dutton using his personal knowledge and included in an expanded TYDS edition. The major omission is a description of his rationale behind formulating the Speedwords he has chosen. In his opening chapter of all editions of Teach Yourself Dutton Speedwords titled \\"Dutton Speedwords Analysed\\" (TYDS, pages 7‚Äì9) he describes some of the principles he used. For example, using Horn's analysis of frequently used words\\"Horn, Ernest 1926 A basic writing vocabulary: 10,000 words most commonly used in writing. Iowa City, IO: College of Education, University of Iowa.\\" to determine how much to abbreviate or truncate his Speedword vocabulary, and, drawing on words common to several European languages. But this does not equate to a systematic account of how new technical words and expressions could be added to the Speedword vocabulary. Nor does it show that the existing Speedwords were wisely chosen. The major deficiencies arise from overcoming confusion caused by apparent inconsistencies in understanding what is meant by particular Speedwords given the variety of Speedword formation methods available. There are four possible areas of confusion. First, deciphering the meaning of a Speedword can produce several possible candidate meanings. There are 20 suffixes (TYDS, page 90). The practice of incorporating a Speedword suffix into the Speedword meakes it difficult to decide whether a Speedword is either a Speedword stem (that is, an indivisible element) or a Speedword and a suffix. For example, the Speedword 'de' is day, 'deb' is debt but 'debe' is yesterday. The suffix 'e' is an augmentive (TYDS, page 37) signalling a comparative increase. So, an untutored interpretation would suggest that 'debe' is a large debt. Dutton's answer to this objection is that they need to be learnt. Second, contractions of frequently used Speedwords actually multiply the vocabulary by creating new Speedwords. For example, 'debe' yesterday is shortened to 'db', and 'jecen' percent is shortened to 'jc'. Again, Dutton's answer to this objection is that they need to be learnt. Third, there are some puzzling inconsistencies. For example, 'La' is great, 'Mla' is greater. 'M' is also used as an abbreviation for 'Mr'. It is unclear whether this is a misprint with the L in lower case and what the 'm' signifies. Finally, Dutton encourages joining Speedwords together as compounds except where they are equivalent to an existing Speedword. This creates new Speedwords which become unrecognisable because they are not in the dictionary, Again, Dutton's answer to this objection is that they need to be learnt. The disadvantage is it increases the vocabulary reducing the benefit from keeping the vocabulary small. In summary, these shortcomings are resolvable. Ambiguity could be resolved by obtaining a copy of the Speedwords publication which lists the 493 elementary Speedwords but this is unobtainable. It may also contain the rationale for formulating Speedwords. The deficiencies should be addressed differently. Instead of immediately changing some Speedwords, the system of affixes (prefix, suffix) need to be re-examined. The number of prefixes should be reduced. Some overlap (e.g., augmentation, and favourable, TYDS, pages 37‚Äì38, 34 respectively). The complement suffix denote an incorrect pair or is out of sequence TYDS, pages 50‚Äì51) for example, 'ze' means send but 'zes' is bring. The diminutive suffix does not convey magnitude (TYDS, page 51), for example, 'do' for live, while 'dot' is visit). The use of a prefix conceals the Speedword because the first letter cannot be immediately recognised. These proposals would make Speedwords more easily recognisable because the elementary stem would be reliably recognisable. Apparently in the 1980s and 1990s some attempts were made to amend Speedword shortcomings but they are no longer available for inspection and evaluation. Improvements depend upon reading Dutton publications from 1933 and 1951 which may disclose method and rationale.

By July, 1941 Hughes Aircraft had relocated its flight line to Culver City, California, in the Playa del Rey wetlands alongside Ballona Creek. as a division of Hughes Tool Company. The company was known for producing, among other products, the Hughes H-4 Hercules Spruce Goose aircraft, the atmospheric entry probe carried by the Galileo spacecraft, and the AIM-4 Falcon guided missile.Parker, Dana T.

Hughes developed the AIM-120 AMRAAM, one of the world's most advanced air-to-air missiles. During World War II the company designed and built several prototype aircraft at Hughes Airport. These included the famous Hughes H-4 Hercules, better known by the public's nickname for it, the Spruce Goose, the H-1 racer, D-2, and the XF-11. However the plant's hangars at Hughes Airport, location of present-day Playa Vista in the Westside of Los Angeles, California, were primarily used as a branch plant for the construction of other companies' designs. At the start of the war Hughes Aircraft had only four full-time employees‚Äîby the end the number was 80,000.Parker, Dana T. Building Victory: Aircraft Manufacturing in the Los Angeles Area in World War II, pp. 49-58, Cypress, CA, 2013. During the war, the company was awarded contracts to build B-25 struts, centrifugal cannons, and machine gun feed chutes. =Post‚ÄìWorld War II= Hughes Aircraft was one of many aerospace and defense companies which flourished in Southern California during and after World War II and was at one time the largest employer in the area. Yet, employment had dropped to 800 by 1947. By the summer of 1947 certain politicians had become concerned about Hughes' alleged mismanagement of the Spruce Goose and the XF-11 photo reconnaissance plane project. They formed a special committee to investigate Hughes which culminated in a much-followed Senate investigation, one of the first to be televised to the public. Despite a highly critical committee report, Hughes was cleared. The company then expanded into the booming electronics field, eventually employing 3,300 Ph.D.s. Hughes hired Ira Eaker, Harold L. George, and Tex Thornton to run the company. By 1953, the company employed 17,000 and had $600,000,000 in government contracts. In 1948 Hughes created a new division of the company, the Aerospace Group. Two Hughes engineers, Simon Ramo and Dean Wooldridge, had new ideas on the packaging of electronics to make complete fire control systems. Their MA-1 system combined signals from the aircraft's radar with a digital computer to automatically guide the interceptor aircraft into the proper position for firing missiles. At the same time other teams were working with the newly formed US Air Force on air-to-air missiles, delivering the AIM-4 Falcon, then known as the F-98. The MA-1/Falcon package, with several upgrades, was the primary interceptor weapon system of the USAF for many years, lasting into the 1980s. Ramo and Wooldridge, having failed to reach an agreement with Howard Hughes regarding management problems, resigned in September 1953 and founded the Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation, later to join Thompson Products to form the Thompson-Ramo-Wooldridge based in Canoga Park, with Hughes leasing space for nuclear research programs (present day West Hills (Canoga Park). TRW Canoga Park The company became TRW in 1965, another aerospace company and a major competitor to Hughes Aircraft. In 1951 Hughes Aircraft Co. built a missile plant in Tucson, Arizona. The construction of this plant, wrote David Leighton, in the Arizona Daily Star newspaper, was due to \\"Howard Hughes‚Äô long-held fear that his plant in Culver City, California, was vulnerable to enemy attack because it was on the Pacific Coast.\\" By the end of that year, the U.S. Air Force had purchased the property but allowed the company to continue to run day to day operations of the site. This Tucson plant is still in operation under the ownership of Raytheon Co. Howard Hughes donated Hughes Aircraft to the newly formed Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI) in 1953 allegedly as a way of avoiding taxes on its huge income. The next year, L.A. \\"Pat\\" Hyland was hired as vice president and general manager of Hughes Aircraft; he would ultimately become company president and CEO after Howard Hughes' death in 1976. Under Hyland's guidance, the Aerospace Group continued to diversify and become massively profitable, and became a primary focus of the company. The company developed radar systems, electro-optical systems, the first working laser, aircraft computer systems, missile systems, ion-propulsion engines (for space travel), and many other advanced technologies. The 'Electronic Properties Information Center' (EPIC) of the United States was hosted at the Hughes Culver City library in the 1970s. EPIC published the multi-volume Handbook of Electronic Materials as public documents. Nobel Laureates Richard Feynman and Murray Gell-Mann had Hughes connections: Feynman would hold weekly seminars at Hughes Research Laboratories; Gell-Mann shared an office with Malcolm Currie, later a chairman of the board and chief executive officer at Hughes Aircraft. Greg Jarvis and Ronald McNair, two of the astronauts on the last flight of the Space Shuttle Challenger, were Hughes alumni. =Ground Systems Group= Hughes Aircraft Ground Systems Group was located in Fullerton, California. The facility was 3 million square feet and included manufacturing, laboratories, offices, and a Munson road test course. It designed developed and produced the Air Defense Systems that replaced the Semi Automatic Defense Ground Environment (SAGE) in the United States with the Joint Surveillance System (JSS) AN/FYQ-93 including NORAD with Joint Tactical Information Distribution System (JTIDS) and provided defense systems and air traffic control systems around the world. These systems are massive and at its peak Ground Systems Group employed 15,000 people and generated revenue in excess of $1 billion per year. These systems included the following Ground Systems Group subsystems: Computer H5118, Consoles HMD-22 and HMD-44, Liquid Crystal Large Screen Displays, and Software that set the standard for software developmentTECHNICAL REPORT CMU/SEI-98-TR-006 ESC-TR-98-006 Hughes Aircraft‚Äôs Widespread Deployment of a Continuously Improving Software Process based on science and engineering starting with the Combat Grande System. Ground Systems Group was known to push technology envelopes in the computers, displays, local area networks, human interfaces, and software in their systems. They also blazed the path to very highly distributed human intensive systems.  Hughes Space and Communications Group and the Hughes Space Systems Division built the world's first geosynchronous communications satellite, Syncom, in 1963 and followed by the first geosynchronous weather satellite, ATS-1, in 1966. Later that year their Surveyor 1 made the first soft landing on the Moon as part of the lead- up to the moon landings in Project Apollo. Hughes also built Pioneer Venus in 1978, which performed the first extensive radar mapping of Venus, and the Galileo probe that flew to Jupiter in the 1990s. The company built nearly 40 percent of commercial satellites in service worldwide in 2000.Boeing: Integrated Defense Systems - Space and Intelligence Systems - About Space and Intelligence Systems =Hughes helicopter business= In 1947, Howard Hughes redirected Hughes Aircraft's efforts from airplanes to helicopters. The effort began in earnest in 1948, when helicopter manufacturer Kellett Aircraft Co. sold its latest design to Hughes for production. The XH-17 \\"Sky Crane\\" first flew in October 1952, but was commercially unsuccessful. In 1955, Howard Hughes split the helicopter production unit from the Hughes Aircraft Company, and reconstituted it with Hughes Tool Company, calling it Hughes Tool Company's Aircraft Division. The Aircraft Division had a focus on the production of light helicopters, mainly the Hughes 269/300 and the OH-6 Cayuse/Hughes 500. =Howard Hughes Medical Institute sells Hughes Aircraft Company= Hughes left no will and following his death in 1976 there were numerous claims to his estate. A Hughes executive and a Hughes lawyer claimed they had the right to set up an \\"executive committee\\" to take over the running of the HHMI and its Hughes Aircraft subsidiary. The Attorney General of Delaware Richard R. Wierhttps://www.lawyercentral.com/richard-r-wier-jr- interactive-profile--20-136613.html challenged this and filed suit in 1978. Charles M. Oberly continued the action when he became attorney general in 1983. Oberly stated he wished to see an independent board of trustees to ensure both that the institute fulfilled its charitable mission and that it did not continue to operate as a tax shelter. In January 1984 Judge Grover C. Brown ruled that the Chancery Court should appoint the trustees because Hughes had not left a succession plan. Brown asked for both the executive committee and the attorney general's office to submit a list of recommendations that he could approve. Brown approved a list in April 1984. In January 1985 the new board of trustees of the HHMI announced they would sell Hughes Aircraft either by private sale or public stock offering. =Hughes Electronics Corporation= Hughes logo, adopted after its new owner General Motors Mock-up of a Hughes satellite kickmotor inside the Space Shuttle Independence (similar to the one carried on STS-49) On June 5, 1985 General Motors was announced as the winner of a secretive five month, sealed-bid auction. Other bidders included Ford Motor Company and Boeing. The purchase was completed on December 20, 1985, for an estimated $5.2 billion, $2.7 billion in cash and the rest in 50 million shares of GM Class H stock. On December 31, 1985, General Motors merged Hughes Aircraft with its Delco Electronics unit to form Hughes Electronics Corporation, an independent subsidiary. The group then consisted of: Delco Electronics Corporation and Hughes Aircraft Company. In August of 1992 Hughes Aircraft completed its purchase of General Dynamics' missile businesses for $450 million. This brought the Tomahawk Cruise Missile, Advanced Cruise Missile, Standard missile, Stinger missile, Phalanx Close-in weapon system, and Rolling Airframe Missile into Hughes' portfolio. In 1994 Hughes Electronics introduced DirecTV, the world's first high-powered DBS service. In 1995 Hughes Electronic's Hughes Space and Communications division became the largest supplier of commercial satellites. Also in 1995 the group purchased Magnavox Electronic Systems from the Carlyle Group. In 1996 Hughes Electronics and PanAmSat agree to merge their fixed satellite services into a new publicly held company, also called PanAmSat with Hughes Electronics as majority shareholder. In 1995, Hughes Aircraft sold its Technology Products Division (automated wire and die bonder) to an investor group led by Citicorp and incorporated the division as Palomar Technologies.http://www.palomartechnologies.com/about-us/corporate- information/hughes-palomar-history In 2008, Citicorp sold the bonder division to the current management team at Palomar Technologies. In 1997 GM transferred Delco Electronics to its Delphi Automotive Systems business. Later that year the assets of Hughes Aircraft were sold to Raytheon for $9.5 billion. The remaining companies remained under the Hughes Electronics name and within GM. In 2000, The Boeing Company purchased three units within Hughes Electronics Corp.: Hughes Space and Communications Co., Hughes Electron Dynamics, and Spectrolab Inc., in addition to Hughes Electronics' interest in HRL, the company's primary research laboratory. The four joined Boeing Satellite Systems, a company subsidiary, later becoming the Satellite Development Center, part of Boeing Integrated Defense Systems. Hughes Companies... Joining the Boeing Family In 2003 the remaining parts of Hughes Electronics (DirecTV, DirecTV Latin America, PanAmSat, Hughes Network Systems) were purchased by News Corporation from GM and renamed The DirecTV Group. Corporate legacy The wide range of science and technology developed by Hughes Aircraft never included medical applications because the company was owned by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI). This restriction was imposed to avoid even the appearance of a conflict of interest.HughesNews (the company's weekly newspaper) However the money provided to HHMI by Hughes Aircraft led to major improvements to the medical field from genetics, cancer research, to producing doctors who provide care to millions of people. The city of Fullerton, California named Hughes Drive after the site that the company formerly occupied before 1997. After Hughes closed, the city developed Amerige Heights, a residential community.

D√∫n na S√©ad Verified 2011-02-09. translated as the \\"Fort of the Jewels\\") is a village in western County Cork, Ireland. It is the main village in the parish of Rathmore and the Islands, the southernmost parish in Ireland. It is the main ferry port to Sherkin Island, Cape Clear Island and the eastern side of Roaring Water Bay (Loch Trasna) and Carbery's Hundred Isles. Although the name Baltimore is an anglicisation of the Irish meaning \\"town of the big house\\", the Irish-language name for Baltimore is that of the O'Driscoll castle, D√∫n na S√©ad or Dunashad (\\"fort of the jewels\\"). The restored castle is open to the public and overlooks the town. In ancient times, Dunashad was considered a sanctuary for druids and the place name is associated with Bealtaine. History Baltimore was a seat of one of Ireland's most ancient dynasties, the Corcu Lo√≠gde, former Kings of Tara and Kings of Munster. An English colony was founded here about 1605 by Sir Thomas Crooke, 1st Baronet, with the blessing of King James I of England; Crooke leased the lands from Sir Fineen O'Driscoll, head of the O'Driscoll clan. It was a lucrative centre of the pilchard fisheries, and in the early 1600s a pirate base, where not only all the justices including the vice-admiral of Munster, but the entire population, were involved; all the women of Baltimore were reputed to be either wives or mistresses of pirates.Appleby J.C. A Nursery of Pirates: The English pirate community in Ireland in the early seventeenth century. IJMH II (1990) no. 1 pp 1-27. As reported in Rodger, N.A.M., The Safeguard of the Sea. A naval history of Britain, 660-1649. p 349. 1997. Republished Penguin Books 2004. These activities were unaffected by official discouragement under King James, but English piracy generally declined shortly thereafter, partly due to competition from Barbary pirates. In 1607 Baltimore became a market town, with the right to hold a weekly market and two annual fairs. Control passed after Crooke's death to Sir Walter Coppinger. The town was depopulated in 1631 in the Sack of Baltimore, a raid by Barbary pirates from either Ottoman Algeria or Sal√© (Morocco). Between 100 and 237 English settlers and local Irish people were sold into slavery, of whom only two or three ever saw Ireland again. Reminders of the incident still exist in the form of pub names, like the \\"Algiers Inn\\". The survivors fled to Skibbereen, and Baltimore for generations was almost deserted. A slow recovery began in the 18th century, and by the early 1800s the village was starting to prosper again, only to suffer further great losses in the Great Famine. Baltimore was granted borough status in 1612 with a town government consisting of a \\"sovereign\\" (Sir Thomas Crooke) and twelve burgesses. It returned two members to the Irish House of Commons 1613-1801. Places of interest Lot's wife One of the most notable landmarks in the area is the Baltimore Beacon, also known as Lot's wife. Towards the end of July 1847, Commander James Wolfe, R.N., informed the Ballast Board that he had recently completed a survey of Baltimore Harbour and noticed the destruction of the beacon on the eastern point of the southern entrance to the harbour. George Halpin, the Board's inspector was ordered to report the matter which he did the following month, stating that the original, locally built beacon was too small, poorly built, and had been vandalised. He recommended a large and properly constructed beacon with which the Board concurred. Almost a year passed, 6 July 1848, before the Board requested the secretary to seek permission from Lord Carbery for a piece of ground ten yards in diameter, on which to build the beacon. By the end of July a reply had been received from Mr. Arthur Perry-Aylmer informing the Board that Lady Carbery of Castle Freke near Rosscarbery had given her full permission to either rebuild or re-construct the existing beacon and granted free access as the beacon was a matter of such vast importance to fishermen and others. By February 1849 inspector George Halpin reported that the masonry work of the beacon was complete but the iron staff and vane still had to be placed on top. The conspicuous conical white painted Baltimore Beacon, sometimes called the 'pillar of salt' or 'Lot's wife' is approximately 50 feet (15.2m) high and 5 yards (4.6m) in diameter at the base. The vent, mentioned by Halpin in 1849 was obviously vulnerable and at a later date was replaced by a sphere. Tourism Baltimore attracts visitors and the resident population increases in summer months due to the summer homes that have been built in the area. Baltimore is used by visitors interested in sailing, fishing and exploring the countryside. Baltimore is a base from which tourists explore Cape Clear, Sherkin and Lough Hyne. Lough Hyne, Ireland's first marine nature reserve is approximately 5 km from town. Baltimore also has become a venue for scuba diving, due largely to the number and variety of shipwrecks in the bay. These include a Second World War submarine (U-260), the bulk carrier Kowloon Bridge and the Alondra from 1916. Accommodation in the area includes Casey's of Baltimore hotel, the Waterfront Hotel and a number of bed and breakfasts. Sport The local GAA club is Ilen Rovers, which was formed in 1973 and consists of the surrounding parish and that of Lisheen and Kilcoe. They compete in the Cork County Senior Football Championship and appeared in the Senior final in 2007 losing to Nemo Rangers. The local soccer team Baltimore FC also known as the Crabs were established in 2006. They won division 2 in 2010 and are currently a division 1 side in the West Cork League. Sailing is also a popular activity in Baltimore. Courses are held in the summer months for both adults and children. Transport Ferries sail from Baltimore to Schull further along the coast, to Sherkin Island, and to the more remote Cape Clear Island. Baltimore is located on the R595 road, leading to the N71 road for Cork, roughly 100 kilometres from the village. The closest town to Baltimore is Skibbereen, 13.4 kilometres north-east of the village. Bus services to Skibbereen and Cork are provided by Bus √âireann. The nearest airport is Cork Airport Baltimore railway station on the West Cork Railway opened on 2 May 1893, but finally closed on 1 April 1961.

It is a biennial plant usually grown as an annual. Its long, tuberous root has cream-colored skin and flesh, and, left in the ground to mature, it becomes sweeter in flavor after winter frosts. In its first growing season, the plant has a rosette of pinnate, mid-green leaves. If unharvested, in its second growing season it produces a flowering stem topped by an umbel of small yellow flowers, later producing pale brown, flat, winged seeds. By this time, the stem has become woody and the tuberous root inedible. The parsnip is native to Eurasia; it has been used as a vegetable since antiquity and was cultivated by the Romans, although some confusion exists between parsnips and carrots in the literature of the time. It was used as a sweetener before the arrival in Europe of cane sugar. The parsnip is usually cooked, but it can also be eaten raw. It has a very sweet taste, like carrots. It is high in vitamins and minerals, especially potassium. It also contains antioxidants and both soluble and insoluble dietary fiber. It should be cultivated in deep, stone-free soil. It is attacked by the carrot fly and other insect pests, as well as viruses and fungal diseases, of which canker is the most serious. Handling the stems and foliage can cause a skin rash if the skin is exposed to sunlight after handling. Description The parsnip is a biennial plant with a rosette of roughly hairy leaves that have a pungent odor when crushed. Parsnips are grown for their fleshy, edible, cream-colored taproots. The roots are generally smooth, although lateral roots sometimes form. Most are cylindrical, but some cultivars have a more bulbous shape, which generally tends to be favored by food processors as it is more resistant to breakage. The plant's apical meristem produces a rosette of pinnate leaves, each with several pairs of leaflets with toothed margins. The lower leaves have short stems, the upper ones are stemless, and the terminal leaves have three lobes. The leaves are once- or twice-pinnate with broad, ovate, sometimes lobed leaflets with toothed margins; they grow up to long. The petioles are grooved and have sheathed bases. The floral stem develops in the second year and can grow to more than tall. It is hairy, grooved, hollow (except at the nodes), and sparsely branched. It has a few stalkless, single- lobed leaves measuring long that are arranged in opposite pairs. The yellow flowers are in a loose, compound umbel measuring in diameter. Six to 25 straight pedicels are present, each measuring that support the umbellets (secondary umbels). The umbels and umbellets usually have no upper or lower bracts. The flowers have tiny sepals or lack them entirely, and measure about . They consist of five yellow petals that are curled inward, five stamens, and one pistil. The fruits, or schizocarps, are oval and flat, with narrow wings and short, spreading styles. They are colored straw to light brown, and measure long. Despite the slight morphological differences between the two, wild parsnip is the same taxon as the cultivated version, and the two readily cross-pollinate. Parsnip has a chromosome number of 2n=22. History Like carrots, parsnips are native to Eurasia and have been eaten there since ancient times. Zohary and Hopf note that the archaeological evidence for the cultivation of the parsnip is \\"still rather limited\\", and that Greek and Roman literary sources are a major source about its early use. They warn that \\"there are some difficulties in distinguishing between parsnip and carrot (which, in Roman times, were white or purple) in classical writings since both vegetables seem to have been sometimes called pastinaca, yet each vegetable appears to be well under cultivation in Roman times\\". The parsnip was much esteemed, and the Emperor Tiberius accepted part of the tribute payable to Rome by Germany in the form of parsnips. In Europe, the vegetable was used as a source of sugar before cane and beet sugars were available. As pastinache comuni, the \\"common\\" pastinaca figures in the long list of comestibles enjoyed by the Milanese given by Bonvesin da la Riva in his \\"Marvels of Milan\\" (1288).Noted by John Dickie, Delizia! The Epic History of Italians and Their Food (New York, 2008), p. 38 (where they are identified as parsnips). This plant was introduced to North America simultaneously by the French colonists in Canada and the British in the Thirteen Colonies for use as a root vegetable, but in the mid-19th century, it was replaced as the main source of starch by the potato and consequently was less widely cultivated. In 1859, a new cultivar called 'Student' was developed by James Buckman at the Royal Agricultural College in England. He back-crossed cultivated plants to wild stock, aiming to demonstrate how native plants could be improved by selective breeding. This experiment was so successful, 'Student' became the major variety in cultivation in the late 19th century. Taxonomy Illustration from Johann Georg Sturm's 1796 Deutschlands Flora in Abbildungen Pastinaca sativa was first officially described by Carolus Linnaeus in his 1753 work Species Plantarum. It has acquired several synonyms in its taxonomic history: *Pastinaca fleischmannii Hladnik, ex D.Dietr. *Pastinaca opaca Bernh. ex Hornem. *Pastinaca pratensis (Pers.) H.Mart. *Pastinaca sylvestris Mill. *Pastinaca teretiuscula Boiss. *Pastinaca umbrosa Steven, ex DC. *Pastinaca urens Req. ex Godr. Several species from other genera (Anethum, Elaphoboscum, Peucedanum, Selinum) are likewise synonymous with the name Pastinaca sativa. Like most plants of agricultural importance, several subspecies and varieties of P. sativa have been described, but these are mostly no longer recognized as independent taxa, but rather, morphological variations of the same taxon. *Pastinaca sativa subsp. divaricata (Desf.) Rouy & Camus *Pastinaca sativa subsp. pratensis (Pers.) ƒåelak. *Pastinaca sativa subsp. sylvestris (Mill.) Rouy & Camus *Pastinaca sativa subsp. umbrosa (Steven, ex DC.) Bondar. ex O.N.Korovina *Pastinaca sativa subsp. urens (Req. ex Godr.) ƒåelak. *Pastinaca sativa var. brevis Alef. *Pastinaca sativa var. edulis DC. *Pastinaca sativa var. hortensis Ehrh. ex Hoffm. *Pastinaca sativa var. longa Alef. *Pastinaca sativa var. pratensis Pers. *Pastinaca sativa var. siamensis Roem. & Schult. ex Alef. In Eurasia, some authorities distinguish between cultivated and wild versions of parsnips by using subspecies P. s. sylvestris for the latter, or even elevating it to species status as Pastinaca sylvestris. In Europe, various subspecies have been named based on characteristics such as the hairiness of the leaves, the extent to which the stems are angled or rounded, and the size and shape of the terminal umbel. Uses Parsnip prepared with honey and mustard Parsnips resemble carrots and can be used in similar ways, but they have a sweeter taste, especially when cooked. They can be baked, boiled, pureed, roasted, fried, grilled, or steamed. When used in stews, soups, and casseroles, they give a rich flavor. In some cases, parsnips are boiled and the solid portions are removed from the soup or stew, leaving behind a more subtle flavor than the whole root, and starch to thicken the dish. Roast parsnip is considered an essential part of Christmas dinner in some parts of the English-speaking world and frequently features in the traditional Sunday roast. Parsnips can also be fried or thinly sliced and made into crisps. They can be made into a wine with a taste similar to Madeira. In Roman times, parsnips were believed to be an aphrodisiac. However, parsnips do not typically feature in modern Italian cooking. Instead, they are fed to pigs, particularly those bred to make Parma ham. Nutrients A typical 100-g parsnip contains 75 kcal (230 kJ) of energy. Most parsnip cultivars consist of about 80% water, 5% sugar, 1% protein, 0.3% fat, and 5% dietary fiber. The parsnip is rich in vitamins and minerals, and is particularly rich in potassium with 375 mg per 100 g. Several of the B-group vitamins are present, but levels of vitamin C are reduced in cooking. Since most of the vitamins and minerals are found close to the skin, many will be lost unless the root is finely peeled or cooked whole. During frosty weather, part of the starch is converted to sugar and the root tastes sweeter. The consumption of parsnips has potential health benefits. They contain antioxidants such as falcarinol, falcarindiol, panaxydiol, and methyl-falcarindiol, which may potentially have anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties. The dietary fiber in parsnips is partly of the soluble and partly the insoluble type and comprises cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The high fiber content of parsnips may help prevent constipation and reduce blood cholesterol levels. Etymology The etymology of the generic name Pastinaca is not known with certainty, but is probably derived from either the Latin word pastino, meaning \\"to prepare the ground for planting of the vine\\" or pastus, meaning \\"food\\". The specific epithet sativa means \\"sown\\". While folk etymology sometimes assumes the name is a mix of parsley and turnip, it actually comes from Middle English pasnepe, alteration (influenced by nep, turnip) of Old French pasnaie (now panais) from Latin pastinum, a kind of fork. The word's ending was changed to -nip by analogy with turnip because it was mistakenly assumed to be a kind of turnip. Cultivation The wild parsnip from which the modern cultivated varieties were derived is a plant of dry rough grassland and waste places, particularly on chalk and limestone soils. Parsnips are biennials, but are normally grown as annuals. Sandy and loamy soils are preferable to silt, clay, and stony ground; the latter produces short, forked roots. Parsnip seed significantly deteriorates in viability if stored for long. Seeds are usually planted in early spring, as soon as the ground can be worked to a fine tilth, in the position where the plants are to grow. The growing plants are thinned and kept weed-free. Harvesting begins in late fall after the first frost, and continues through winter. The rows can be covered with straw to enable the crop to be lifted during frosty weather. Low soil temperatures cause some of the starches stored in the roots to be converted into sugars, giving them a sweeter taste. =Cultivation problems= Parsnip leaves are sometimes tunnelled by the larvae of the celery fly (Euleia heraclei). Irregular, pale brown passages can be seen between the upper and lower surfaces of the leaves. The effects are most serious on young plants, as whole leaves may shrivel and die. Treatment is by removing affected leaflets or whole leaves, or by chemical means. The crop can be attacked by larvae of the carrot fly (Chamaepsila rosae). This pest feeds on the outer layers of the root, burrowing its way inside later in the season. Seedlings may be killed while larger roots are spoiled. The damage done provides a point of entry for fungal rots and canker. The fly is attracted by the smell of bruised tissue. Parsnip is used as a food plant by the larvae of some lepidopteran species, including the parsnip swallowtail (Papilio polyxenes), the common swift moth (Korscheltellus lupulina), the garden dart moth (Euxoa nigricans), and the ghost moth (Hepialus humuli). The larvae of the parsnip moth (Depressaria radiella), native to Europe and accidentally introduced to North America in the mid-1800s, construct their webs on the umbels, feeding on flowers and partially developed seeds. Parsnip canker is a serious disease of this crop. Black or orange-brown patches occur around the crown and shoulders of the root accompanied by cracking and hardening of the flesh. It is more likely to occur when seed is sown into cold, wet soil, the pH of the soil is too low, or the roots have already been damaged by carrot fly larvae. Several fungi are associated with canker, including Phoma complanata, Ilyonectria radicicola, Itersonilia pastinaceae, and I. perplexans. In Europe, Mycocentrospora acerina has been found to cause a black rot that kills the plant early. Watery soft rot, caused by Sclerotinia minor and S. sclerotiorum, causes the taproot to become soft and watery. A white or buff-colored mold grows on the surface. The pathogen is most common in temperate and subtropical regions that have a cool wet season. Violet root rot caused by the fungus Helicobasidium purpureum sometimes affects the roots, covering them with a purplish mat to which soil particles adhere. The leaves become distorted and discolored and the mycelium can spread through the soil between plants. Some weeds can harbour this fungus and it is more prevalent in wet, acid conditions. Erysiphe heraclei causes a powdery mildew that can cause significant crop loss. Infestation by this causes results in yellowing of the leaf and loss of foliage. Moderate temperatures and high humidity favor the development of the disease. Several viruses are known to infect the plant, including seed-borne strawberry latent ringspot virus, parsnip yellow fleck virus, parsnip leafcurl virus, parsnip mosaic potyvirus, and potyvirus celery mosaic virus. The latter causes clearing or yellowing of the areas of the leaf immediately beside the veins, the appearance of ochre mosaic spots, and crinkling of the leaves in infected plants. Toxicity The shoots and leaves of parsnip must be handled with care, as its sap contains furanocoumarins, phototoxic chemicals that cause blisters on the skin when it is exposed to sunlight, a condition known as phytophotodermatitis. It shares this property with many of its relatives in the carrot family. Symptoms include redness, burning, and blisters; afflicted areas can remain sensitive and discolored for up to two years. Reports of gardeners experiencing toxic symptoms after coming into contact with foliage have been made but these have been small in number compared to the number of people who grow the crop. The problem is most likely to occur on a sunny day when gathering foliage or pulling up old plants that have gone to seed. The symptoms have mostly been mild to moderate. The toxic properties of parsnip extracts are resistant to heating, and to periods of storage lasting several months. Toxic symptoms can also affect livestock and poultry in parts of their bodies where their skin is exposed. Polyynes can be found in Apiaceae vegetables such as parsnip, and they show cytotoxic activities.  Invasivity  Previous-year growth of wild parsnip as seen in the spring. Invasive specimen photographed in Ottawa, Ontario. The parsnip is native to Eurasia. However, its popularity as a cultivated plant has led to the plant being spread beyond its native range, and wild populations have become established in other parts of the world. Scattered population can be found throughout North America. The plant can form dense stands which outcompete native species, and is especially common in abandoned yards, farmland, and along roadsides and other disturbed environments. The increasing abundance of this plant is a concern particularly due to the plant's toxicity and increasing abundance in populated areas such as parks. Control is often carried out via chemical means, with glyphosate-containing herbicides considered to be effective.

Best known for the picture books Sylvester and the Magic Pebble, Abel's Island, and Doctor De Soto, he was also the creator of Shrek!, which inspired the film series of the same name. He was the U.S. nominee for both of the biennial, international Hans Christian Andersen Awards, as a children's book illustrator in 1982 and a writer in 1988. Early life Steig was born in Brooklyn, New York in 1907, and grew up in the Bronx. His parents were Polish-Jewish immigrants from Austria, both socialists. His father, Joseph Steig, was a house painter, and his mother, Laura Ebel Steig, was a seamstress who encouraged his artistic leanings. As a child, he dabbled in painting and was an avid reader of literature. Among other works, he was said to have been especially fascinated by Pinocchio. In addition to his artistic endeavors, he also did well at athletics, being a member of the collegiate All-American water polo team. He graduated from Townsend Harris High School at 15 but never completed college, though he attended three, spending two years at City College of New York, three years at the National Academy of Design and a mere five days at the Yale School of Art before dropping out of each. Career Hailed as the \\"King of Cartoons\\", Steig began drawing illustrations and cartoons for The New Yorker in 1930, producing more than 2,600 drawings and 117 covers for the magazine. One of his cartoon characters, Poor Pitiful Pearl, was made into a popular line of dolls starting in 1956. Steig, later, when he was 61, began writing children's books. In 1968, he wrote his first children's book. He excelled here as well, and his third book, Sylvester and the Magic Pebble (1969), won the Caldecott Medal. He went on to write more than 30 children's books, including the Doctor De Soto series, and he continued to write into his nineties. Among his other well-known works, the picture book Shrek! (1990) formed the basis for the DreamWorks Animation film Shrek (2001). After the release of Shrek 2 in 2004, Steig became the first sole-creator of an animated movie franchise that went on to generate over $1 billion from theatrical and ancillary markets after only one sequel. In 1984, Steig's film adaptation of Doctor De Soto, directed by Michael Sporn, was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. Also in 1984, Steig received the CINE Golden Eagle Award in Education. for the film adaptation of this book. Personal life Steig married four times and had three children. From 1936 to 1949, Steig was married to educator and artist Elizabeth Mead Steig (1909‚Äì1983), sister of anthropologist Margaret Mead, from whom he was later divorced. For a time, Steig lived at 75¬Ω Bedford Street, purported to be the narrowest house in Manhattan. Steig's first marriage also made him a brother-in-law of Leo Rosten and an uncle of Mary Catherine Bateson. Steig and Mead were the parents of jazz flutist Jeremy Steig and a daughter, Lucinda. He married second wife Kari Homestead in 1950, and they had a daughter, Margit Laura (now professionally known as Maggie Steig). After their divorce, he was married to Stephanie Healey from 1964 to 1966. His final marriage, to Jeanne Doron, endured for the rest of his life. His brother Irwin was a journalist and painter, for whom he illustrated two books on poker strategy. His brother Henry was a writer who played the saxophone and painted. And his brother Arthur was a writer and poet, who, according to Steig, read The Nation in the cradle, was telepathic and \\"drew as well as Picasso or Matisse\\". Steig died of natural causes in Boston on October 3, 2003, aged 95. Shrek 2, which was released seven months after his death, was dedicated to his memory. Works * 1932, Man About Town (New York: R.

He published many of the outstanding educational and reference works of 19th-century France, including the 15 volume Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe si√®cle. Early life Monument to Pierre Larousse in his native town (early 20th century). Pierre Larousse was born in Toucy, where his father was a blacksmith. At the age of sixteen he won a scholarship at the teaching school in Versailles. Four years later, he returned to Toucy to teach in a primary school, but became frustrated by the archaic and rigid teaching methods. In 1840 he moved to Paris to improve his own education by taking free courses. Career The cover of the first Larousse French dictionary in 1856 From 1848 to 1851 he taught at a private boarding school, where he met his future wife, Suzanne Caubel (although they would not marry until 1872). Together, in 1849, they published a French language course for children. In 1851 he met Augustin Boyer, another disillusioned ex-teacher, and together they founded the Librairie Larousse et Boyer (Larousse and Boyer Bookshop). They published progressive textbooks for children, and instruction manuals for teachers, with an emphasis on developing the pupils' creativity and independence. In 1856 they published the New Dictionary of the French Language, the forerunner of the Petit Larousse, but Larousse was already starting to plan his next, much larger project. On December 27, 1863 the first volume of the great encyclopedic dictionary, the Grand dictionnaire universel du XIXe si√®cle (Great Universal 19th-Century Dictionary), appeared. It was praised by Victor Hugo and became a classic. It is still highly respected in its modern, revised form. In 1869 Larousse ended his partnership with Boyer and spent the rest of his life working on the Great Dictionary. The dictionary was finished (15 volumes, 1866‚Äì76; supplements 1878 and 1890), by Larousse's nephew Jules Hollier in 1876, after Larousse's death (in Paris in 1875) from a stroke caused by exhaustion. Publishing legacy The publishing house √âditions Larousse still survives, but was acquired by Compagnie Europ√©enne de Publication in 1984, Havas in 1997, Vivendi Universal in 1998 and the Lagard√®re Group in 2002. English-language variants of √âditions Larousse encyclopedias were published for many decades by Hamlyn (publishers) and Prometheus Books.

Nosaltres, els valencians (; \\"We, the Valencians\\"), is a historical and political essay by the Valencian (Spain) author Joan Fuster, first published in 1962. The book deals with Valencians, especially their national identity and their relationship with Spain, Catalonia and the Catalan-speaking community as a whole. It does so from an ardourous Catalanism. The fact that it represented the first solid intellectual effort in the twentieth century to construct an overview of the past and the present of Valencians from a Catalanist point of view explains its relevance and controversy back in the day. It was because of the novelty of this new Catalanist paradigm, consisting of Catalanism made from Valencia, that the book caused a stir in the Valencian Francoist establishment and, with the advent of democracy in Spain, still remained deeply controversial for its uncompromising views. Nosaltres, els valencians marked the dawn of Valencian nationalism in its modern formulation. It was also the main force behind a revival of the Pa√Øsos Catalans idea and, with it, of the blaverist reaction against it as well. The book was also criticized by some Valencian nationalists as well, who considered that Fuster took the Catalan nationalist model without adjusting it to the reality of what soon after (1982) became the present Valencian Community with the passing of the Valencian Statute of Autonomy. The book remained most influential in the Valencian Community during the 1980s. It began losing relevance by the early 1990s, as the Unitat del Poble Valenci√†, a party which had been partially inspired by it, started shifting their doctrine from Catalanism to Valencianism-proper, still within the Catalanist tenet, though. To date, Nosaltres els Valencians remains a fundamental cornerstone of the literature on Valencian identity, as much despised by some ‚Äîwho see in it a Catalanist fifth column in Valencia‚Äî as revered by others ‚Äîwho regard it as a yet to be surpassed reflection on the Valencian identity. Sources and influences Fuster was influenced by Jaume Vicens i Vives's 1954 essay Not√≠cia de Catalunya. Not√≠cia de Catalunya was to initially be titled Nosaltres els catalans, but it was renamed under Josep Pla's advice,Hist√≤ria de la historiografia catalana, p.225 for fear of Francoist censorship.De la revoluci√≥n liberal a la democracia parlamentaria: Valencia (1808-1975), p.35.

He has written several novels and poetry books. He has received several awards such as Padma Shri, Sahitya Academy Award, Pravasi Bharatiya Samman, WH Smith Literary Award and Crossword Book Award. Seth's collections of poetry such as Mappings and Beastly Tales are notable contributions to the Indian English language poetry canon. Early life and education Seth was born on 20 June 1952 in Calcutta. His father, Prem Nath Seth, was an executive of Bata Shoes and his mother, Leila Seth, a barrister by training, became the first female judge of the Delhi High Court and first woman to become Chief Justice of a state High Court in India. He received his primary education at St. Xavier's High School in Patna, and then went to The Doon School in Dehradun, where he edited The Doon School Weekly. At Doon, he was influenced by his teacher, the mountaineer Gurdial Singh, who taught him geography and, according to Leila Seth, \\"guided Vikram in many ways...encouraged him to appreciate Western classical music and instilled in him a love of adventure and daring.\\" Singh later described Seth as an \\"indefatigable worker, and he maintains without difficulty his distinguished level in studies...he has put in enormous amount of energy in other spheres of school life, in dramatics, in debating, in first aid, in music, and in editing the Doon School Weekly.\\" After graduating from Doon, Seth went to Tonbridge School, England, to complete his A-levels. Later he read Philosophy, Politics and Economics at Corpus Christi College, Oxford. He then pursued a Ph.D. in Economics at Stanford University though never completed it.Vikram Seth's Founder's Day Address, The Doon School, Penguin Books of Modern Speeches (2009) p.34 \\"...edited the Weekly and did other things\\" Work and style Seth has published eight books of poetry and three novels. In 1980, he wrote Mappings, his first book of poetry. The publication of A Suitable Boy, a 1,349-page novel, propelled Seth into the public limelight. It was adapted into a BBC television drama miniseries in 2020. His second novel is An Equal Music deals with the troubled love-life of a violinist. Seth's work Two Lives published in 2005 is a memoir of the marriage of his great-uncle and aunt. In addition to The Golden Gate, Seth has written other works of poetry including Mappings (1980), The Humble Administrator's Garden (1985), All You Who Sleep Tonight (1990) and Three Chinese Poets (1992). His children's book, Beastly Tales from Here and There (1992) consists of 10 stories about animals. He has written a travel book, From Heaven Lake: Travels through Sinkiang and Tibet (1983), an account of a journey through Tibet, China and Nepal. He was also commissioned by the English National Opera to write a libretto based on the Greek legend of Arion and the Dolphin. The opera was performed for the first time in June 1994. A sequel to A Suitable Boy, A Suitable Girl, was announced in 2009. Life and career Seth's former literary agent Giles Gordon recalled being interviewed by Seth for the position, \\"Vikram sat at one end of a long table and he began to grill us. It was absolutely incredible. He wanted to know our literary tastes, our views on poetry, our views on plays, which novelists we liked\\"..\\" Seth later explained to Gordon that he had passed the interview not because of commercial considerations, but because unlike the others he was the only agent who seemed as interested in his poetry as in his other writing. Seth followed what he has described as \\"the ludicrous advance for that book\\" (¬£250,000 for A Suitable Boy) with ¬£500,000 for An Equal Music and ¬£1.4 million for Two Lives. He prepared an acrostic poem for his address at Gordon's 2005 memorial service. Seth was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 2001.

It is named after Stephen B√°thory, the 16th-century Polish king. The Foundation‚Äôs mission is to support the development of an open, democratic society in Poland along with other Central and East European countries. Foundation‚Äôs activity is financed from income on endowment and grants from foreign institutions, from gifts of individual donors and 1% personal income tax designations. History and beginnings The Batory Foundation was founded in 1988 when the communist system in Central Europe was disintegrating. It was established by an American philanthropist of Hungarian extraction, George Soros, and Polish democratic opposition leaders of the 1980s. The mission of the Foundation was to contribute to the preparation of Polish society in the transition from communism to democracy, civil society and a market economy. Early on, the Batory Foundation invested in the preparation of cadres for the market economy and democratic system taking roots in Poland by funding hundreds of scholarships and travel grants for economists, bankers, physicians, teachers, and local government activists. It also made a significant contribution to the various reforms being implemented in the country after the collapse of communism, supporting the reform of local government, public administration, and social welfare policy. These reform-related initiatives eventually gave rise to the Institute of Public Affairs, a major think-tank in Warsaw, which the Foundation helped to establish in 1995. The Foundation disbursed hundreds of micro-grants to a variety of local civic initiatives, contributing to the establishment of numerous local organizations. Until 2007, the Stefan Batory Foundation has spent USD 95,9 million on all its programs, USD 71 million of which were assigned for grantmaking. Throughout 2007, the Foundation provided 513 grants to institutions and organizations, 47 travel grants to cover costs of 169 participants attending events and projects abroad, as well as 5 awards; overall expenditure for grantmaking and operational activities in 2007 totaled EUR 4,9 million. Priorities of the Foundation In 2016, the Foundation ran 3 grantmaking, and 5 operational programs. =Grantmaking programs= *Citizens for Democracy ‚Äì the aim of the Programme, planned for 2013-2016 is to strengthen civil society development and enhance the contribution of non- governmental organizations.

Open Society Foundations financially support civil society groups around the world, with a stated aim of advancing justice, education, public health and independent media.. The group's name is inspired by Karl Popper's 1945 book The Open Society and Its Enemies..  Overview  The OSF has branches in 37 countries, encompassing a group of country and regional foundations, such as the Open Society Initiative for West Africa, and the Open Society Initiative for Southern Africa; its headquarters are in New York City. In 2018, OSF announced it was closing its European office in Budapest and moving to Berlin, in response to legislation passed by the Hungarian government targeting the foundation's activities. Since its establishment in 1993, OSF has reported expenditures in excess of $11 billion mostly in grants towards NGOs, aligned with the organisation's mission. History On May 28, 1984, Soros signed a contract between the Soros Foundation (New York) and the Hungarian Academy of Sciences, the founding document of the Soros Foundation Budapest.. This was followed by several foundations in the region to help countries move away from communism. In 1991, the foundation merged with the Fondation pour une Entraide Intellectuelle Europ√©enne, an affiliate of the Congress for Cultural Freedom, created in 1966 to imbue 'non-conformist' Eastern European scientists with anti-totalitarian and capitalist ideas. Open Society Institute was created in the United States in 1993 to support the Soros foundations in Central and Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. In August 2010, it started using the name Open Society Foundations (OSF) to better reflect its role as a benefactor for civil society groups in countries around the world. Soros believes there can be no absolute answers to political questions because the same principle of reflexivity applies as in financial markets. In 2012, Christopher Stone joined the OSF as the second president. He replaced Aryeh Neier, who served as president from 1993 to 2012. Stone announced in September 2017 that he was stepping down as president. In January 2018, Patrick Gaspard was appointed president of the Open Society Foundations. In 2016, the OSF was reportedly the target of a cyber security breach. Documents and information reportedly belonging to the OSF were published by a website. The cyber security breach has been described as sharing similarities with Russian-linked cyberattacks that targeted other institutions, such as the Democratic National Committee. In 2017, Soros transferred $18 billion to the Foundation. Activities George Soros at a talk in Malaysia Its $873 million budget in 2013, ranked as the second-largest private philanthropy budget in the United States, after the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation budget of $3.9 billion. As of 2020, its budget increased to $1.2 billion. The foundation reported granting at least $33 million to civil rights and social justice organizations in the United States. This funding included groups such as the Organization for Black Struggle and Missourians Organizing for Reform and Empowerment that supported protests in the wake of the shooting of Trayvon Martin, the death of Eric Garner, the shooting of Tamir Rice and the shooting of Michael Brown.Ferguson Inc. ‚Äî The city's protest movement tries to find a path forward; Politico; March 4, 2015Riot Act;Snopes; January 17, 2015 According to the Center for Responsive Politics, the OSF spends much of its resources on democratic causes around the world, and has also contributed to groups such as the Tides Foundation. OSF has been a major financial supporter of U.S. immigration reform, including establishing a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. OSF projects have included the National Security and Human Rights Campaign and the Lindesmith Center, which conducted research on drug reform. The Library of Congress Soros Foundation Visiting Fellows Program was initiated in 1990. Reception and influence In 2007, Nicolas Guilhot (a senior research associate of CNRS) wrote in Critical Sociology that the Open Society Foundations serve to perpetuate institutions that reinforce the existing social order, as the Ford Foundation and Rockefeller Foundation have done before them. Guilhot argues that control over the social sciences by moneyed interests has depoliticized this field and reinforced a capitalist view of modernization. An OSF effort in 2008 in the African Great Lakes region aimed at spreading human rights awareness among prostitutes in Uganda and other nations in the area was not received well by the Ugandan authorities, who considered it an effort to legalize and legitimize prostitution. Open Society Foundation has been criticized in pro-Israel editorials, Tablet Magazine, Arutz Sheva and Jewish Press, for including funding for the activist groups Adalah and I'lam, which they say are anti-Israel and support the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement. Among the documents released by DCleaks, an OSF report reads \\"For a variety of reasons, we wanted to construct a diversified portfolio of grants dealing with Israel and Palestine, funding both Israeli Jewish and PCI (Palestinian Citizens of Israel) groups as well as building a portfolio of Palestinian grants and in all cases to maintain a low profile and relative distance‚Äîparticularly on the advocacy front.\\"George Soros hacked, documents posted online Rachel Kaplan, 14/08/16 NGO Monitor, an Israeli NGO, produced a report which says, \\"Soros has been a frequent critic of Israeli government policy, and does not consider himself a Zionist, but there is no evidence that he or his family holds any special hostility or opposition to the existence of the state of Israel. This report will show that their support, and that of the Open Society Foundation, has nevertheless gone to organizations with such agendas.\\" The report says its objective is to inform OSF, claiming: \\"The evidence demonstrates that Open Society funding contributes significantly to anti-Israel campaigns in three important respects: # Active in the Durban strategy; # Funding aimed at weakening United States support for Israel by shifting public opinion regarding the Israeli- Palestinian conflict and Iran; # Funding for Israeli political opposition groups on the fringes of Israeli society, which use the rhetoric of human rights to advocate for marginal political goals.\\" The report concludes, \\"Yet, to what degree Soros, his family, and the Open Society Foundation are aware of the cumulative impact on Israel and of the political warfare conducted by many of their beneficiaries is an open question.\\"Bad Investment: The Philanthropy of George Soros and the Arab-Israeli Conflict: How Soros-funded Groups Increase Tensions in a Troubled Region, Alexander H. Joffe, Professor Gerald M. Steinberg, May 1, 2013 In 2015, Russia banned the activities of the Open Society Foundations on its territory, declaring \\"It was found that the activity of the Open Society Foundations and the Open Society Institute Assistance Foundation represents a threat to the foundations of the constitutional system of the Russian Federation and the security of the state\\".Reuters. Russia bans George Soros foundation as state security 'threat'. November 30, 2015. In 2017, Open Society Foundations and other NGOs that promote open government and help refugees have been targeted for crackdowns by authoritarian and populist governments who have been emboldened by encouraging signals from the Trump Administration. Several politicians in eastern Europe, including Liviu Dragnea in Romania and typically right-wing figures Szilard Nemeth in Hungary, North Macedonia's Nikola Gruevski, who called for a \\"de-Sorosization\\" of society, and Poland's Jaroslaw Kaczynski, who has said that Soros-funded groups want \\"societies without identity\\", regard many of the NGO groups to be irritants at best, and threats at worst. Some of those Soros-funded advocacy groups in the region say the renewed attacks are harassment and intimidation, which became more open after the election of Donald Trump in the United States. Stefania Kapronczay of the Hungarian Civil Liberties Union, which receives half of its funding from Soros-backed foundations, claims that Hungarian officials are \\"testing the waters\\" in an effort to see \\"what they can get away with.\\" In 2017, the government of Pakistan ordered the Open Society Foundation to cease operations within the country.Sayeed, Saad (December 13, 2017) \\"Pakistan orders George Soros foundation, other aid groups to close,\\" Reuters In May 2018, Open Society Foundations announced they will move its office from Budapest to Berlin, amid Hungarian government interference. In November 2018, Open Society Foundations announced they are ceasing operations in Turkey and closing their ƒ∞stanbul and Ankara offices due to \\"false accusations and speculations beyond measure\\", amid pressure from Turkish government and governmental interference through detainment of Turkish intellectuals and liberal academics claimed to be associated with the foundation and related NGOs, associations and programmes.

Written between 1963 and 1967, Treatise is a graphic musical score comprising 193 pages of lines, symbols, and various geometric or abstract shapes that largely eschew conventional musical notation. Implicit in the title is a reference to the philosophy of Ludwig Wittgenstein, which was of particular inspiration to Cardew in composing the work. The score is not accompanied by any explicit instructions to the performers in how to perform the work, or what sound-producing means are to be used. Although the bottom of each page has two five-line musical staves, this is not apparently meant to suggest piano or other keyboard instrument(s). It is apparently only meant to indicate that the graphic elements are musical, not purely artistic, in character. Cardew worked on the composition from 1963 to 1967. Although the score allows for absolute interpretive freedom (no one interpretation will sound like another), the work is not normally played spontaneously, as Cardew had previously suggested that performers devise in advance their own rules and methods for interpreting and performing the work. There are, however, almost infinite possibilities for the interpretation of Treatise that fall within the implications of the piece and general principles of experimental music performance in the late 1960s, including presentation as visual art and map- reading (Anderson 2006). Subsequently Cardew embraced Maoism and wholeheartedly repudiated this and other works of his avant-garde period. A savage indictment of Treatise may be seen in a speech delivered by Cardew at the ‚ÄòInternational Symposium on the Problematic of Today‚Äôs Musical Notation‚Äô held in Rome in October 1972, as transcribed in his highly polemical book Stockhausen Serves Imperialism (1974), available in PDF format at UBUweb. Curiously, Cardew did not withdraw Treatise from publication despite his repudiation.

M. Coetzee, published in 1999. It won the Booker Prize. The writer was also awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature four years after its publication. Plot David Lurie is a South African professor of English who loses everything: his reputation, his job, his peace of mind, his dreams of artistic success, and finally even his ability to protect his own daughter. He is twice-divorced and dissatisfied with his job as a 'communications' lecturer, teaching a class in romantic literature at a technical university in Cape Town in post-apartheid South Africa. Lurie's sexual activities are all inherently risky. Before the sexual affair that will ruin him, he becomes attached to a prostitute and attempts to have a romantic relationship with her (despite her having a family), which she rebuffs. He then seduces a secretary at his university, only to completely ignore her afterwards. His \\"disgrace\\" comes when he seduces one of his more vulnerable students, a girl named Melanie Isaacs, plying her with alcohol and other actions that arguably amount to rape; later, when she stops attending his class as a result, he falsifies her grades. Lurie refuses to stop the affair, even after being threatened by Melanie's erstwhile boyfriend, who knocks the papers off Lurie's desk, and her father, who confronts him but whom David runs from. This affair is thereafter revealed to the school, amidst a climate of condemnation for his allegedly predatory acts, and a committee is convened to pass judgement on his actions. David refuses to read Melanie's statement, defend himself, or apologize in any sincere form and so is forced to resign from his post. Lurie is working on an opera concerning Lord Byron's final phase of life in Italy which mirrors his own life in that Byron is living a life of hedonism and excess and is having an affair with a married woman. Dismissed from his teaching position, he takes refuge on his lesbian daughter Lucy's farm in the Eastern Cape. For a time, his daughter's influence and natural rhythms of the farm promise to harmonise his discordant life; for example, in attending farmers markets where Lucy sells her wares, and in working with Petrus, a polygamously-married black African whose farm borders Lucy's and who nominally works for Lucy as a \\"dog-man\\" (Lucy boards dogs). But the balance of power in the country is shifting. Shortly after becoming comfortable with rural life, he is forced to come to terms with the aftermath of an attack on the farm. Three men, who claim to need Lucy's phone to call for aid for a sick relative, force their way into the farmhouse. The men rape Lucy and attempt to kill David by setting him on fire. In addition, they also shoot the caged dogs which Lucy is boarding, an action which David later muses was done since black people in South Africa are taught to fear dogs as symbols of white power and oppression. The men drive off in David's car: it is never recovered and they are never caught, although police once contact David to come pick up \\"his\\" car, which is in fact evidently not his car (different colour and registration number, different sound system). To David's relief, newspapers spell Lurie's name inaccurately (\\"Lourie\\"), meaning nothing will tie his disgraced academic persona to the news story describing the attack on his daughter's farm. Lucy becomes apathetic and agoraphobic after the attack. David presses her to report the full circumstances to the police, but she does not. Lucy does not want to, and in fact does not, discuss the attack with David until much later. The relationship between Lucy and David begins to show strain as the two recover from the attack in different ways. Lurie begins work with Bev Shaw, a friend of Lucy's, who keeps an animal shelter and frequently euthanizes animals, which David then disposes of. Shaw has an affair with Lurie, despite David finding her physically unattractive. Meanwhile, David suspects Petrus being complicit in the attack. This suspicion is strengthened when one of the attackers, a young man named Pollux, attends one of Petrus's parties and is claimed by Petrus as a kinsman. Lucy refuses to take action against Pollux, and she and David simply leave the party. As the relationship between Lucy and David deteriorates, David decides to discontinue living with his daughter and return to Cape Town Returning home to his house in Cape Town, David finds that his house has been broken into during his long absence. He attempts to attend a theatre performance starring Melanie, but is harassed into leaving by the same boyfriend who had earlier threatened him. He also attempts to apologize to Melanie's father, leading to an awkward meeting with Melanie's younger sister, which rekindles David's internal passion and lust. David finally meets with Melanie's father, who makes him stay for dinner. Melanie's father insists that his forgiveness is irrelevant: Lurie must follow his own path to redemption. At the novel's end, Lurie returns to Lucy's farm. Lucy has become pregnant by one of the rapists, but ignores advice to terminate the pregnancy. Pollux ultimately comes to live with Petrus, and spies on Lucy bathing. When David catches Pollux doing this, Lucy forces David to desist from any retribution. David surmises that ultimately, Lucy will be forced into marrying Petrus and giving him her land, and it appears that Lucy is resigned to this contingency. Lurie returns to working with Shaw, where Lurie has been keeping a resilient stray from being euthanised. The novel concludes as Lurie \\"gives him up\\" to Bev Shaw's euthanasia. Reception and interpretation According to Adam Mars-Jones, writing in The Guardian, \\"Any novel set in post-apartheid South Africa is fated to be read as a political portrait, but the fascination of Disgrace is the way it both encourages and contests such a reading by holding extreme alternatives in tension. Salvation, ruin.\\" In the new South Africa, violence is unleashed in new ways, and Lurie and his daughter become victims, yet the main character is no hero; on the contrary, he commits violence in his own way as is clearly seen in Lurie's disregard for the feelings of his student as he manipulates her into having sexual relations with him. This characterization of violence by both the 'white' and the 'black' man parallels feelings in post-apartheid South Africa where evil does not belong to the 'other' alone. By resisting the relegation of each group into positive and negative poles Coetzee portrays the whole range of human capabilities and emotions. The novel takes its inspiration from South Africa's contemporary social and political conflict, and offers a bleak look at a country in transition. This theme of transition is represented in various forms throughout the novel, in David's loss of authority, loss of sexuality and in the change in power dynamics of groups that were once solely dominant or subordinate. Sarah Ruden suggests that: > As in all of his mature novels, Coetzee here deals with the theme of > exploitation. His favorite approach has been to explore the innocuous- > seeming use of another person to fill one's gentler emotional needs. This is a story of both regional and universal significance. The central character is a confusing person, at once an intellectual snob who is contemptuous of others and also a person who commits outrageous mistakes. His story is also local; he is a white South African male in a world where such men no longer hold the power they once did. He is forced to rethink his entire world at an age when he believes he is too old to change and, in fact, should have a right not to. This theme, about the challenges of aging both on an individual and societal level, leads to a line, \\"No country, this, for old men,\\" an ironic reference to the opening line of the W. B. Yeats poem, \\"Sailing to Byzantium\\". Furthermore, Lurie calls his preference for younger women a \\"right of desire\\", a quote taken up by South African writer Andr√© Brink for his novel \\"The Rights of Desire\\". By the end of the novel, though, Lurie seems to mature beyond his exploitative view of women. In recognizing the right of Lucy to choose her course in life, he finally puts \\"their strained relationship on a more equal footing\\" -- the first time in his relationships with women.Mary LeBlanc, in \\"Hushed Resolve, Reticence, and Rape in J.M. Coetzee's Disgrace,\\" Philosophy and Literature, Vol. 41, No. 1 (April 2017), 158-68, emphasizes the importance of this recognition on David Lurie's part. His pursuit of a sexual relationship with Bev Shaw also marks something of a path toward personal salvation, \\"by annihilating his sexual vanity and his sense of superiority.\\" This is Coetzee's second book (after Life and Times of Michael K) where man is broken down almost to nothing before he finds some tiny measure of redemption in his forced acceptance of the realities of life and death. Coetzee has always situated his characters in extreme situations that compel them to explore what it means to be human. Though the novel is sparse in style, it covers a number of topics: personal shame, the subjugation of women, a changing country, and romantic poetry and its allegory and symbolism. Another important theme in the novel is the difficulty or impossibility of communication and the limits of language. Although Lurie teaches communications at Cape Town Technical University and is a scholar of poetry, language often fails him. Coetzee writes: > Although he devotes hours of each day to his new discipline, he finds its > first premise, as enunciated in the Communications 101 handbook, > preposterous: 'Human society has created language in order that we may > communicate our thoughts, feelings, and intentions to each other.' His own > opinion, which he does not air, is that the origins of speech lie in song, > and the origins of song in the need to fill out with sound the overlarge and > rather empty human soul. A 2006 poll of \\"literary luminaries\\" by The Observer newspaper named the work as the \\"greatest novel of the last 25 years\\" of British, Irish or Commonwealth origin in years between 1980 and 2005. A film adaptation of Disgrace starring John Malkovich had its world premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in 2008, where it won the International Critics' Award. On November 5, 2019, the BBC News listed Disgrace on its list of the 100 most influential novels. References External links * 'The Trouble with J.M.

Prior to 2019, SVT was funded by a television licence fee payable by all owners of television sets. The Swedish public broadcasting system is largely modelled after the system used in the United Kingdom, and Sveriges Television shares many traits with its British counterpart, the BBC. SVT is a public limited company that can be described as a quasi-autonomous non-government organisation. Together with the other two public broadcasters, Sveriges Radio and Sveriges Utbildningsradio, it is owned by an independent foundation, F√∂rvaltningsstiftelsen f√∂r Sveriges Radio AB, Sveriges Television AB och Sveriges Utbildningsradio AB. The foundation's board consists of 13 politicians, representing the political parties in the Riksdag and appointed by the Government. The foundation in turn appoints the members of the SVT board. SVT's regulatory framework is governed by Swedish law. Originally, SVT and Sveriges Radio were a joint company, but since 1979 they and Sveriges Utbildningsradio are sister companies sharing some joint services. SVT maintained a monopoly in domestic terrestrial broadcasting from its start in 1956 until the privately held TV4 started broadcasting terrestrially in 1992. It is barred from accepting advertisements except in the case of sponsors for sporting events. Until the launch of the Swedish language satellite television channel TV3 in 1987, Sveriges Television provided the only Swedish television available to the public. SVT is still the biggest TV network in Sweden, with an audience share of 36.4 percent. History Flags outside the SVT Television Centre, 2008 When radio broadcasting was first organized in the 1920s, it was decided to adopt a model similar to that of the British Broadcasting Company in the United Kingdom. Radio would be a monopoly funded by a licence fee and organized as a limited company, AB Radiotj√§nst (\\"Radio Service Ltd.\\"), owned by the radio industry and the press. The transmitters were owned by the state through Telegrafverket and the press held a monopoly on newscasts through Tidningarnas Telegrambyr√•. AB Radiotj√§nst was one of 23 founding broadcasting organizations of the European Broadcasting Union in 1950. Tidningarnas Telegrambyr√• lost its monopoly on newscasts de jure in 1947 and de facto in 1956, but otherwise the same model would be applied to television. It was decided to start test transmissions of television in June 1954. The first transmissions were made on 29 October 1954 from the Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm. In 1956 the Riksdag decided that television broadcasting should continue on a permanent basis and on 4 September Radiotj√§nst initiated official transmissions from the new Nacka transmitter. A television licence for those owning a television set was introduced in October of that year. Television clock in the 1960s Regularly scheduled television programming began in 1957. At the same time, Radiotj√§nst was renamed Sveriges Radio (SR) and its ownership was changed. The state and the press would have equal 40% shares, while the company itself would own 20% (in 1967, the state increased its share to 60% at the expense of the press). In 1958, the first newscast, Aktuellt, was broadcast. During the 1960s the establishment of a second TV channel was frequently discussed. These discussions resulted in the launch of TV2 on 5 December 1969. The original channel became TV1 and it was intended that the two channels would broadcast in \\"stimulating competition\\" within the same company. The first stage of the main headquarters building and TV studios for Sveriges Television, called TV-huset (sv), was inaugurated on Oxenstiernsgatan in the √ñstermalm district in Stockholm on 30 October 1967. The completion of the second stage of TV-huset and its official opening was on 5 December 1969, the same day as the start of operations of TV2, making it one the largest television studios in Europe at that time. TV2 clock in the 1970s 1970 saw the start of the first regional programme, Sydnytt from Malm√∂. More regional news programmes launched in 1972 and the entire country was covered by regional news programmes by 1987 when ABC from Stockholm began. When TV2 started the news programmes were reorganized. Aktuellt was replaced by TV-nytt, which was responsible for the main 19.30 bulletin on TV1 as well as news updates on both channels. In addition, the two channels would get one \\"commentary bulletin\\" each. TV2's was entitled Rapport and TV1's was Nu. In 1972, the news was reorganized once again. Rapport was moved to the 19.30 slot on TV2 while Aktuellt was revived, to broadcast at 18.00 and 21.00 on TV1. These timeslots would mostly stay unchanged for the following decades. In 1966, the first colour broadcast was made, with regular colour broadcasts being introduced in 1970. Teletext started in 1978. SVT headquarters in Stockholm At the end of the 1970s, SR was reorganized. From 1 July 1979, Sveriges Radio AB became the mother of four companies: Sveriges Riksradio (RR) for national radio, Sveriges Lokalradio AB (LRAB) for local radio, Sveriges Utbildningsradio (UR) for educational broadcasting and Sveriges Television (SVT) for television. SVT would provide all television broadcasting, except for educational programming which was the responsibility of Sveriges Utbildningsradio. The abbreviation SVT was chosen over the arguably more logical \\"STV\\" as that abbreviation was already occupied by Scottish Television in the EBU. The Swedish EBU membership is currently jointly held by SVT, SR and UR. The two channels were reorganized in 1987. TV1 was renamed Kanal 1 and contained almost all programmes produced in Stockholm, while TV2 consisted of the ten regional districts and the Rapport news desk. Broadcasting in Nicam Stereo was made permanent in 1988. This year also saw the launch of a channel called SVT World in southern Finland, broadcasting content from SVT for Finland-Swedes. The channel, which was later renamed SVT4, was rebranded as SVT Europa in 1997, when it started broadcasting to all of Europe via satellite. Following its expansion into Asia and Africa, it was rebranded as SVT World in 2005. In 1992, the Riksdag decided that Sveriges Radio would be reorganized once again, this time into three independent companies (with RR and LRAB merged). From 1994, they would be owned by three independent foundations. The three foundations later became one. In 1990, the television broadcasting day would usually begin at 16.00 and end before 24.00. The 1990s saw an increase in broadcasting hours, with the addition of reruns in the afternoon, a morning show, and lunch-time news bulletins. SVT also met competition from new commercial broadcasters. TV3 became the first channel to break SVT's monopoly on television in Sweden and in 1992 the newly elected right-wing parliamentary majority allowed TV4 to start terrestrial broadcasting. TV4 soon established nationwide coverage and in 1995 passed TV2 in the overall ratings to become the nation's most viewed channel. In 1996, the channels were once again reorganized. The previous organization and competition between the two channels disappeared as they became part of a single organization. Kanal 1 and TV2 were renamed SVT1 and SVT2. The first season of Expedition: Robinson (Survivor) was shown in 1997. The first digital terrestrial television (DTT) broadcasts took place in 1999. SVT started six new channels: the news channel SVT24 and five regional channels. 2000 saw the reorganization of the news desks. Aktuellt, Rapport, and SVT24 all came under the control of one central news desk. In 2001 a new logo and new programme schedules, among other things, were introduced. This made SVT1 the broader mainstream channel with higher ratings and SVT2 the narrower channel. The main news bulletins at 19.30 and 21.00 switched channels, with Aktuellt now shown on SVT2 and Rapport on SVT1. The regional channels were closed at the beginning of 2002 and replaced by SVT Extra. In December 2002, a new channel known as Barnkanalen began showing children's programmes during the day. On 24 February 2003 SVT24 and SVT Extra were renamed 24, a theme channel for news and sports. Also in 2003, all the SVT channels dropped their encryption in the DTT network. On 25 June 2003, SVT broadcast its first programme with 5.1 sound on DTT. The first 5.1 show was Alls√•ng p√• Skansen. In November 2004, SVT added two audio streams that read out the translation subtitles on SVT1 and SVT2. The knowledge-oriented channel Kunskapskanalen started broadcasting in September 2004. The switch-off of analogue transmitters started in 2005 on Gotland. By 2007 all analogue transmissions from SVT had ceased. SVT started VODcasting a number of programmes in February 2006. Altogether three broadcasters competed to be the first one to VODcast in Sweden. In the end, all three started in the same week. SVT made its first broadcasts in high definition television during the 2006 FIFA World Cup on a channel operated in co-operation with TV4 AB. Regular high-definition broadcasting started on the SVT HD channel on 22 October 2006. The first programme was the film Lost in Translation, followed the next day by a 50th anniversary tribute to television in Sweden, which was the first live entertainment programme to be broadcast in high definition in Sweden. On 25 August 2008, new logos and channel identities were introduced on the network with Barnkanalen renamed SVTB and 24 returning to its former name of SVT24, while SVT1 began carrying Regionala Nyheter (regional news bulletins) for the first time. SVT was the host broadcaster for the 1975, 1985, 1992, 2000, 2013, and 2016 Eurovision Song Contests. In 2018, the Riksdag voted to replace the traditional TV licensing system with a new public-service fee based on personal income tax. Programming A reporter from SVT =News= News programmes News programmes are an important part of SVT. Since 1972 there have been two main news programmes: Rapport and Aktuellt (translated \\"Report\\" and \\"Current [events]\\", respectively). The two news programmes had completely separate organizations, meaning a lot of duplicated coverage was provided. After some co-operation in the 1990s, the two programmes were allowed to merge in 2000 with the newly created SVT24 to form a single organization. The different programme names and identities were kept, however. Eventually, Rapport has become the main news programme, and Aktuellt will only broadcast one bulletin per day from autumn 2007. The main national news bulletins are Rapport, broadcast at 18.00 and 19.30, and Aktuellt which reports in greater depth at 21.00. Additionally, shorter news bulletins are shown in the mornings and throughout the day on SVT1, SVT2, and SVT24. These are styled SVT Nyheter. SVT also broadcasts video news on the Internet through a service called Play Rapport. SVT provides news programmes in various minority languages: Uutiset in Finnish, Nyhetstecken in Swedish Sign Language, and, in co-operation with NRK and Yle, Oƒëƒëasat in Northern Sami, as well as special editions of Sverige idag in Me√§nkieli and Romani.Hult, F.M. (2010). Swedish Television as a mechanism for language planning and policy. Language Problems and Language Planning, 34(2), 158-181. There are also regional news bulletins ‚Äì on SVT1 at 18.33 on Mondays to Fridays and 18.10 on Sundays, as well as 19.55 daily except Saturdays ‚Äì on SVT2 at 21.46 on Mondays to Thursdays and 21.25 on Fridays *ABC from Stockholm (Stockholm and Uppsala) *G√§vledala from Falun (Dalarna and G√§vleborg) *Mittnytt from Sundsvall (V√§sternorrland) *Nordnytt from Lule√• (Norrbotten) *√ñstnytt from Norrk√∂ping (√ñsterg√∂tland, S√∂dermanland and Gotland) *Sm√•landsnytt from V√§xj√∂ (Kronoberg, Kalmar and J√∂nk√∂ping) *SVT Nyheter J√§mtland from √ñstersund (J√§mtland) *SVT Nyheter V√§st from Gothenburg (V√§stra G√∂taland and Halland) *Sydnytt from Malm√∂ (Sk√•ne and Blekinge) *Tv√§rsnytt from √ñrebro (√ñrebro and V√§stmanland) *V√§rmlandsnytt from Karlstad (V√§rmland) *V√§sterbottensnytt from Ume√• (V√§sterbotten) Party political orientation A survey in 1999 claimed that 33 percent of the journalists working for SVT and SR supported the Left Party, which was about the same proportion as among journalists employed in commercial broadcasting and the print media, but significantly higher than among the general public, only 15 percent of whom supported the Left Party. Support for the Left Party, the Green Party and the Liberal Party was stronger among journalists on SVT and SR than among the general public, while the Moderate Party, the Social Democrats, and the Christian Democrats had significantly less support among SVT and SR journalists than they did among the public at large.JMGdata 2000 Journalisternas partisympatier The study nevertheless concluded that the private political opinions of the journalists had little impact on their work and that news stories are treated the same regardless of the political colour of individual journalists. It is also worth mentioning that SJF, the organisation amongst whose members the study was partly conducted, is a trade union, which could have skewed the representivity of the sample (lessening the validity of the survey) as it is possible it excluded some rightwing journalists. The University of Gothenburg also made another study during the Swedish 2006 general election, comparing SVT's news programme Rapport to the country's five largest newspapers. The study concluded that Rapport's coverage of the election was the most balanced of them all.Dagens Nyheter, June 9 2006 =Entertainment= Alls√•ng p√• Skansen Entertainment shows on Fridays and Saturdays are, together with popular sports, the programmes that attract the largest audiences. *Melodifestivalen (1959-), the preselection for the Eurovision Song Contest, is very popular in Sweden. The final generally gets around 4 million viewers. *Expedition Robinson (1997‚Äì2004, 2009‚Äì2012), the original Swedish version of Survivor. Sveriges Television was the first network to broadcast this reality television series in 1997. The show, with a name alluding to Robinson Crusoe, was a major hit in Sweden. The show which consistently held high ratings was concluded after its seventh and final year on the network (the final season aired 2003-2004). The popular series was continued on the commercial channel TV3, but with much lower ratings. Expedition Robinson was aired in 2009 with a brand new season, but the series is/was just called \\"Robinson\\", and now on the commercial channel TV4. *P√• sp√•ret (1987‚Äìpresent), popular entertainment show in which celebrities answer questions related to different locations. A cut down film in extremely high speed of a train journey towards the location is shown and the sooner the contestants stop it the higher the points. In later years even car journeys has been filmed that way. Humouristic and well hidden clues are given verbally during the journey. The name of the show means \\"on the track\\" in English. The show is one of very few Swedish original ideas. It has been syndicated in other countries as well. *S√• ska det l√•ta (1997‚Äìpresent), the Swedish adaptation of The Lyrics Board which has on several occasions reached more than 3 million viewers. *Alls√•ng p√• Skansen (1979‚Äìpresent) Broadcast live from Skansen in Stockholm, this popular summer show features sing-alongs with Swedish folk music. The first sing-along at Skansen was held in 1935. Radio transmissions of the event started shortly after that. The sing-along at Skansen has been a tradition every summer since then. *Antikrundan (1989-), the Swedish version of Antiques Roadshow which has often attracted approximately 2 million viewers. Sveriges Television hosted the Eurovision Song Contest 1985, 1992, 2000, 2013, and 2016, and also as a part of Sveriges Radio hosted the 1975 contest. =Drama= Corridor at SVT in Stockholm SVT produces drama in several genres and forms. *Rederiet (1992‚Äì2002) was one of the most popular soap operas in Sweden. =Regional programming= Regional content is entirely solely restricted to news which is broadcast on SVT1 and SVT2. The eighteen news programmes are: ABC, Blekingenytt, G√§vledala, Hallandsnytt, J√§mtlandsnytt, J√∂nk√∂pingsnytt, Mittnytt, Nordnytt, Sm√•landsnytt, Sydnytt, Tv√§rsnytt, Uppland, V√§rmlandsnytt, V√§sterbottensnytt, V√§stmanlandsnytt, V√§stnytt and √ñstnytt. The regional news programmes are broadcast on SVT1 at 18.33‚Äì18.45 on Mondays to Fridays (18.10‚Äì18.15 on Sundays), with a follow-up bulletin at 19.55‚Äì20.00. SVT2 also broadcasts regional news following Aktuellt at 21.46‚Äì21.56 on Mondays to Thursdays and 21.25‚Äì21.30 on Fridays. There are no regional news bulletins on Saturdays. =Children= Kalles kl√§ttertr√§d ran on Sveriges Television starting in 1975 and grew to become one of the most popular children's programmes of the 1970s. The children's strand Bolibompa was broadcast every day at 18.00 on SVT1, before moving to SVTB in August 2008. =Foreign programming= SVT also airs foreign programming, primarily from the United States, United Kingdom and other Nordic countries, in their original audio with Swedish subtitles, as is the case on other Nordic television channels. The only cases in which dubbing is widespread is in programming aimed directly at children who are not expected to have learned reading skills yet. However, for some programmes, viewers may also access 'talking subtitles' through their remote where someone reads the subtitles to viewers (though 'talking subtitles' are not strictly in sync with the original audio as dubbing is). These same practices are also done for segments of local programmes that contain foreign language dialogue. 33% of the national first-time broadcasts consisted of foreign content in 2005. Of all acquired programming (including Swedish programming not produced by SVT) 27% came from the United States, 22% from the United Kingdom, 13% from Sweden, 13% from the other Nordic countries, 6% from France, 4% from Germany and 9% from the rest of Europe. In Italy produced with RAI a famous TV series Il Commissario Montalbano. SVT √Örsredovisning 2005 page 28 (in Swedish) SVT often cooperates with the other Nordic public broadcasters via Nordvision. Thus, many Danish, Norwegian, Icelandic and Finnish programming air on SVT, while DR, NRK, YLE, KVF and R√öV show Swedish programmes. When there is major breaking news out of Denmark however, SVT may also source live coverage from TV2. Kakn√§stornet in Stockholm is the major broadcasting antenna for TV and radio.  Channels  SVT has five regular channels broadcasting to Sweden: *SVT1 ‚Äì The main channel with broad and regional content. The 10 most seen Swedish TV shows in 2006 were shown on this channel. SVT1 HD simulcasts in high definition. *SVT2 ‚Äì A channel with slightly narrower programming with an emphasis on culture, current affairs and documentaries. SVT2 HD simulcasts in high definition. *Barnkanalen (The Children's Channel) ‚Äì Programmes for children and (pre-)teens. *Kunskapskanalen (The Knowledge Channel) ‚Äì Broadcasting debates, seminars and documentaries in cooperation with UR. *SVT24 ‚Äì Reruns of programmes from SVT1 and SVT2 in the evening and continuous news updates during the night. Shares frequency with Barnkanalen. In addition to these channels, SVT has a special events channel called SVT Extra. It is generally unused and was (as of 2006) last used for live coverage during the 2004 Summer Olympic Games. In 2006, SVT launched a high-definition channel called SVT HD, simulcasting HD versions of programmes on the other SVT channels. All channels, except SVT1 HD and SVT2 HD, are available in most of Sweden through the digital terrestrial television network and encrypted from Thor and Sirius satellites. Until September 2005, both SVT1 and SVT2 were available nationwide via analogue terrestrial transmitters. Cable networks are required to broadcast four SVT channels for free in either digital or analogue form. SVT World, a mix of the SVT channels, is broadcast on satellite and worldwide via IPTV, and also as a terrestrial channel in Swedish-speaking areas of southern Finland. For rights reasons, SVT World does not show acquired material, such as movies, sport, or English language programming. SVT1, SVT2, Barnkanalen, SVT24, and Kunskapskanalen are also available through DTT on √Öland and can be distributed on Finnish cable networks. In Ostrobothnia, Finland, SVT1, SVT2, SVTB and SVT24 are transmitted through DTT as pay TV to the Swedish-speaking population. The signals from the terrestrial transmitters in Sweden can be received in some areas of Denmark and Norway as well as in northernmost Finland near Sweden. With special equipment reception of Swedish terrestrial transmitters is possible even on some parts of the Finnish coast as well as the Polish and German coast closest to Sweden. Cable networks in the Nordic countries generally redistribute SVT1 and SVT2 often for an additional monthly subscription charge in addition to the subscriber's main package. Some Nordic hotels, especially in Denmark and Norway, also offer SVT1 or SVT2 to guests. SVT considers their website, svt.se, a channel in its own right. SVT also provides an on-demand service called SVT Play through which most of the programmes produced for SVT and air on its channels are available. However most non-news and non-current event programmes on SVT Play are only available for viewing in Sweden. Organization The executive management of SVT is handled by a CEO, appointed by the board. The CEO of SVT is currently Hanna Stj√§rne who took over the role from Eva Hamilton in 2015. The Chairman of the Board is Lars Engqvist, deputy Prime Minister of the previous Social Democratic government. SVT's regional studio in Malm√∂ SVT's regional studio in Gothenburg SVT is divided into eight operative programme- producing units - four of these are located in Stockholm while the other four are located around the country at regional studios and are based on the ten regional transmission areas which were merged in 2000: *Malm√∂ - SVT Syd (SVT Malm√∂ and SVT V√§xj√∂) *Gothenburg - SVT V√§st (SVT G√∂teborg) *Norrk√∂ping - SVT Mellansverige (SVT Falun, D√∂vas TV Leksand, SVT Karlstad, SVT √ñrebro and SVT Norrk√∂ping) *Ume√• - SVT Nord (formerly SVT Lule√•, SVT Ume√• and SVT Sundsvall) These four district areas produce networked output and co-ordinate ten of the eleven regional news services broadcast daily on SVT1. The Stockholm-based units are: *SVT Nyheter & Samh√§lle - national news, current affairs, documentaries and the regional news service ABC. *SVT Sport *SVT Fiktion - drama, entertainment, youth and children's programming. *SVTi - multimedia and interactive services. =Chair of the Board of Directors= *Anna-Greta Leijon, 1994-2000 *Allan Larsson, 2000-2005 *Lars Engqvist, 2005 - present =Chief executive officers= Before Sveriges Television was formed in 1978, television broadcasting was controlled by channel controllers. Nils Erik Baehrentz was the controller between 1958-1968. He was succeeded by H√•kan Unsgaard who became TV1's controller in 1968 and √ñrjan Wallquist who became the TV2 controller in 1969. *Magnus Fax√©n, 1978-1981 *Sam Nilsson, 1981-1999 *Maria Curman, 2000-2001 *Christina Jutterstr√∂m, 2001-2006 *Eva Hamilton, 2006 - 2014 *Hanna Stj√§rne, 2014 ‚Äì present When Sam Nilsson retired, the executive chair was split between a CEO and a Programme Officer. This position was abolished in 2007. *Mikael Olsson, 2000‚Äì2000 *Leif Jakobsson, 2001‚Äì2007 thumbA diagram showing the different shares of the viewing for the four major television companies in 2006.  Viewing  Since the arrival of commercial television, SVT's combined viewing share has declined steadily and digital channels have also provided competition. The commercial TV4 became the most watched station in 1995 and maintained its position until 2002, when SVT1 regained the status. TV4 became the most watched channel again 2006. The combined viewing share of the SVT channels declined from 50% in 1997 to 40% in 2005. SVT was the most watched network in Sweden with a share of 38.3% in 2006, although all three major commercial channels attract a higher share of 15- to 24-year-olds than the two SVT channels combined. = Audience trust = A media study released in 2020 showed that trust in SVT programming polarised the audience. 80-90% of viewers who supported liberal or left-leaning parties Green Party, Swedish Social Democratic Party, Liberals, Left Party and Centre Party had high trust in SVT whereas fewer viewers who supported conservative- leaning parties Christian Democrats (60%), Moderate Party (54%) and Sweden Democrats (30%) had high trust in SVT. This meant that SVT was an issue that polarised the audience more than US president Donald Trump. Editorial practices =Changing genders of fictional characters in imported programmes= In what was described as an effort to make television series aimed at children and family less sexist, SVT has been changing genders of certain fictional characters (usually anthropomorphic non-human objects) in such series it imported from outside Sweden, a practice that began in 2013. For example, in South Korean-Chinese-American animated series Super Wings, the gender of a red airplane named Jett was switched from male to female in Swedish version. Also, in Canadian animated series Trucktown, a male light blue truck named Ted would be known as a female truck of same colour named Linn. In an interview with Aftonbladet, Pontus Torpvret, purchasing manager at SVT, told that the corporation 'chose which characters to change with an eye to giving girls strong role models', and that it also wanted to showcase boy characters with soft personality, in a bid to defy from traditional portrayals of gender stereotypes. The changes are made with the consent of the production companies, and, in the event of the copyright holder not giving its consent to such changes, SVT would turn down the corporation's offer to purchase the series.

The name comes from the first six letters at the top left of the keyboard: ( ).  Overview  QWERTZ keyboard of old Swiss typewriter The main difference between QWERTZ and QWERTY is that the positions of the and keys are switched (hence the nickname \\"kezboard\\"). This change was made for three major reasons: * was a much more common letter than in German; this status still exists, and the latter rarely appears outside words whose spellings reflect either their importation from a foreign language or the Hellenization of an older German form under the influence of Ludwig I of Bavaria. * and often appear next to each other in the German orthography, and typewriter jamming would be reduced by placing the two keys so they could be typed with separate hands. * and are also next to each other. , meaning \\"to\\" in German, and also a very common prefix can also be written very easily. Similar to many other non-English keyboards: * Part of the keyboard is adapted to include language-specific characters, e.g. umlauted vowels (√§, √∂, √º) in German and Austrian keyboards. * QWERTZ keyboards usually change the right key into an key to access a third level of key assignments. This is necessary because the language-specific characters leave no room to have all the special symbols of ASCII, needed by programmers among others, available on the first or second (shifted) levels without unduly increasing the size of the keyboard. * The placements of some special symbols are changed when compared to the English (UK and US) versions of QWERTY. Some of special key inscriptions are often changed from an abbreviation to a graphical symbol (for example becomes a hollow arrow pointing down, becomes a left-pointing arrow). In German and Austrian keyboards, most of the other abbreviated labels are in German: (control) is translated to its German equivalent \\"Strg\\" for ', and is abbreviated \\"Entf\\" ('). and on the numeric keypad are not translated, however. (See: Key labels) Variants The QWERTZ layout is fairly widely used in Germany and in the majority of Central European and Balkan countries that use the Latin script. Many German-speaking regions use this layout, but the German-speaking East Cantons of Belgium uses the AZERTY instead. =Albanian= QWERTZ is the default keyboard layout for the Albanian language in Microsoft Windows. =Austria and Germany= German keyboard layout ‚ÄúT2‚Äù according to DIN 2137:2012-06. The characters shown in black are present in the traditional ‚ÄúT1‚Äù layout also. The PC keyboard layout commonly used in Germany and Austria is based on one defined in a former edition (October 1988) of the German standard DIN 2137-2. The current edition DIN 2137:2012-06 standardizes it as the first (basic) one of three layouts, calling it ‚ÄúT1‚Äù (', or ‚Äúkeyboard layout 1‚Äù). It employs dead keys to type accented characters like ‚Äú√©‚Äù, and the AltGr key to access characters in the third level (e.g. ‚Äú[‚Äù, ‚Äú]‚Äù, ‚Äú@‚Äù, the euro sign ‚Äú‚Ç¨‚Äù, or the micro- ‚Äú¬µ‚Äù). The ‚ÄúT2‚Äù layout as specified in the 2012 edition of the German standard also uses the group selection to access special characters like the long s, or foreign characters like ‚Äú√Ü‚Äù or ‚Äú∆è‚Äù. Sorbian Sorbian QWERTZ is practically identical to the German layout, but the additional Sorbian characters can be entered with dead keys; it has three different layouts: Standard, Legacy, and Extended. All are supported by Microsoft Windows (Windows 7 and later only). =Czech = Czech QWERTZ keyboard layout The QWERTZ keyboard layout is commonly used in the Czech Republic, but the QWERTY variant is an unofficial option. The characters from the American keyboard (@#$&\\\\[]{}<>^\`~*) and some other characters and diacritic signs (√∑√ó¬§‚Ç¨√üƒêƒë≈Å≈Ç¬∞ÀòÀù¬∑Àõ¬∏) that are missing on the Czech mechanical typewriter keyboard can be accessed with the AltGr key. The layout on the picture is supported by Microsoft Windows. In internet poll in 2013 56% of Czech users used QWERTZ and 44% used QWERTYhttps://www.zive.cz/clanky/bitva-o-klavesnici-qwerty-qwertz-i- naprosta-exotika/sc-3-a-170708/default.aspx, but in 2020 57% of Czech users used QWERTY and 43% used QWERTZhttps://www.cnews.cz/klavesnice-qwerty-samsung- smartphony/. =Hungary= Hungarian keyboard layout Hungarian keyboard layout On some keyboards, the \\"≈±\\" key is located to the left of the Enter key, while on others it is placed to the left of the backspace key (see the two pictures on the right). An unusual feature of this Hungarian keyboard layout is the position of the 0 (zero): it‚Äôs located to the left of the 1, so that most of the accented characters can be together on the right side of the keyboard. The official layout is of type QWERTZ, which is therefore the most widely used keyboard layout in the country. QWERTY used to be widespread due to there not being a dedicated Hungarian layout commonly available for older computers, but since this is no longer an issue, virtually everyone uses QWERTZ in everyday computing. On \\"ISO\\" keyboards (as in the two pictures), the √≠ is positioned on the key to the right of the left Shift key. To adapt to 101/102-key keyboards which don‚Äôt have that key, the MS Windows QWERTY layout has put the √≠ on the usual key for the 0 (zero) while the 0 has been moved to that key‚Äôs AltGr/Option level; On the Mac both layouts (QWERTY and QWERTZ) have this adaptation.Microsoft keyboard layouts =Poland= Polish keyboard for typewriters according to PN-87. Polish QWERTZ keyboard used on Macintosh. Layout PL-214 used in MS-DOS, Windows and Linux. A variant of the QWERTZ keyboard has been used in Poland, but QWERTY keyboards have been dominant since the early 1990s. = Romanian = The Romanian keyboard in Windows 9x/ME/2000/XP. The standard keyboard layout as established by the standard SR 13392:2004 is QWERTY. However, a Romanian QWERTZ keyboard (corresponding to older standards) was set up on Windows 9x/2000/ME/XP. Since it was devised before the disunification of \\"»ò\\" (S-comma) and \\"»ö\\" (T-comma) with \\"≈û\\" (S-cedilla; used in Turkic languages) and \\"≈¢\\" (T cedilla), the characters with cedilla were used in the layout. In 2012, a revision with commas was made. =Slovak: = Slovak QWERTZ keyboard layout Typewriters in Slovakia have used the QWERTZ layout quite similar to the layout used on the Czech typewriters. Slovak QWERTZ layout differs from the Czech one in using the letter instead of the Czech on the same position, also the letter is on the position of Czech and the letter is on the position of Czech . There are 2 more keys that differ in these 2 languages: Slovak key replaces the Czech key and Slovak key replaces the Czech key. There are 17 characters from American keyboard (@#$&\\\\[]{}<>^\`~*') that are missing on the Slovak keyboard because of the presence of the Slovak letters (ƒæ≈°ƒç≈à≈•≈æ√¥√∫√°√≠√Ω√©√§¬∞¬¥Àá¬ß). Users can access them with the key, however, position of these characters varies between different operating systems. Besides the QWERTZ keyboard layout inherited from the typewriter era, QWERTY layout is also used by computer users in Slovakia. The only difference is that the and keys are swapped. =South Slavic Latin= Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian and Slovene keyboard layout The Bosnian, Croatian, Serbian Latin and Slovene keyboard layout has five additional special characters ƒå, ƒÜ, ≈Ω, ≈† and ƒê. This keyboard layout was standardized in the 1980s in Yugoslavia. Characters ƒÜ and ƒê are only part of Gaj's Latin alphabet but not part of the Slovene alphabet, nevertheless they remain in Slovenian keyboards (for economic reasons, for historical reasons and for writing words in the closely related South Slavic languages). The ≈Ω is on the right side of the ƒÜ key on keyboards which have a longer backspace key, and the usual inverted L shaped Enter key. The layout makes heavy use of the AltGr (right Alt) key for non-alphabetic characters and dead key combinations for adding diacritics to Latin characters. It is possible to type German and Italian using only the Bosnian/Croatian/Serbian keyboard layout. There is a proposed variant of new Slovene keyboard layout, which would remove ƒÜ and ƒê from top layout and add @ instead. The command keys would also become translated into Slovene and some minor second level layout changes would be made. For Serbian, there is also a Cyrillic keyboard variant, in which Q and W are replaced with –â (Lj) and –ä (Nj) respectively. However, the Apple keyboards for Croatian are QWERTY.How to identify keyboard localizations - Apple Support = Switzerland (German, French, Italian, Romansh), Liechtenstein, Luxembourg= Swiss keyboard layout The layout of the Swiss keyboard is established by the national standard SN 074021:1999. It is designed to allow easy access to frequently used accents of the French, German and Italian languages and major currency signs. It was designed from the beginning for usage with multiple languages, also beyond Swiss languages, in mind.. The difference between the Swiss German () and the Swiss French () layout is that the German variety has the German umlauts (√§, √∂, √º) accessible without dead keys, while the French version has the French accented characters (√©, √†, √®) accessible in the unshifted state. The actual keyboards have the keys engraved for both variations; the difference is only in the driver setting. In the latest versions of Windows there are also separately listed driver settings for Swiss Italian and Swiss Romansh, but they correspond to the Swiss French and Swiss German layout, respectively. In Mac OS X 10.6, only Swiss French and Swiss German is available, and on iPadOS, the Swiss German layout is not supported for any language other than German. On Windows, Swiss German does not include the esszett (√ü) ligature, which is only used in Germany and Austria, meaning that that letter is unimportant in Switzerland, and is therefore not found on the keyboard. Linux typically assigns √ü to AltGr-s. While the German keyboard uses German labels for its keys (e.g. Strg instead of Ctrl), Swiss keyboards use the English abbreviations as a \\"neutral\\" solution, as they are used for all the national languages of Switzerland. Luxembourg does not have a keyboard layout of its own. Public education and administration use the Swiss-French keyboard which also represents the Microsoft Windows standard keyboard layout for Luxembourg, while some of the private sector prefer the Belgian layout . Other places may use the US layout. Liechtenstein, which mostly speaks Swiss German and the Liechtenstein German dialect, also use the Swiss German layout without an √ü character.

Bombing At the time of her suicide, Jaradat was a law student due to qualify as a lawyer in a few weeks. She had studied law at Yarmouk University in Jordan. Jaradat reportedly carried out the bombing in Haifa as an act of revenge after Israel Defense Forces undercover operatives in Jenin killed her cousin (Salah, 34) and her younger brother (Fadi, 25),Mid- East cycle of vengeance by Verity Murphy, BBC News Online, October 5, 2013. both of whom were members of Islamic Jihad, with her cousin being considered to be a senior member of the Al-Quds Brigades group. Earlier, when she was 21, her fianc√© had been killed by Israeli security forces. Following the killing of her cousin and brother, Jaradat went into mourning and began study of the Koran and fasting two days a week.David Blair, \\"Revenge sparked suicide bombing\\". The Daily Telegraph via The Ottawa Citizen, October 6, 2003: A9. The bomb included metal fragments packed around the explosive core, that sprayed around the restaurant, maximizing lethal effect. According to Haifa police sources, the aftermath was gruesome, with some of the dead still sitting upright at their tables, while others, including children and babies, were slammed against the walls. Due to the force of the explosion, all that remained of Jaradat was her head. In response to his daughter's actions, her father Taisir said \\"My daughter's action reflected the anger that every Palestinian feels at the occupation.

Snow White and The Madness of Truth Jaradat was the subject of Snow White and The Madness of Truth, a controversial item of installation art by Swedish, Israeli-born composer and musician Dror Feiler, and his Swedish wife, artist Gunilla Sk√∂ld-Feiler. The installation consisted of a portrait of Hanadi Jaradat floating on a small white boat named \\"Sn√∂vit\\" (\\"Snow White\\") in a long pool of blood red water. This tableau was accompanied by written text on nearby walls and the sound of Bach's Cantata 199, Mein Herze schwimmt im Blut, BWV 199 (English: My heart swims in blood). Translated into English, Cantata 199 begins, \\"My heart swims in blood / because the brood of my sins / in God's holy eyes / makes me into a monster\\". The artwork became the centre of controversy when the Israeli ambassador to Sweden, Zvi Mazel, vandalized the installation. After pushing some lightstands into the pool, causing a short-circuit and disabling the light, Mazel told Feiler that \\"This is not a work of art. This is an expression of hatred for the Israeli people. This has glorified suicide bombers\\". Further he said to the press that the piece constituted a \\"complete legitimization of genocide, the murder of innocent people, innocent civilians, under the guise of culture\\". Feiler rejected charges that their intention was to glorify suicide bombers and accused Mazel of \\"practicing censorship\\". He said the installation was made to \\"call attention to how weak people left alone can be capable of horrible things\\".\\"Sharon backs envoy's art attack\\" CNN January 19, 2004\\"Israel Diplomat Defends Attack On Bomber Art In Stockholm\\" New York Times\\"Israelisk attack mot konstverk\\" Svenska Dagbladet Following the incident, Mazel was unrepentant, and said: \\"I was standing before an exhibit calling for genocide, praising the genocide of me, you, my brothers and sisters.\\"Envoy who damaged art work is praised.

The genus name is from Latin Larus which appears to have referred to a gull or other large seabird. The specific delawarensis refers to the Delaware River. Description Species is named for the dark ring around its bill Measurements: * Length: 16.9-21.3 in (43-54 cm) * Weight: 10.6-24.7 oz (300-700 g) * Wingspan: 41.3-46.1 in (105-117 cm) The head, neck and underparts are white; the relatively short bill is yellow with a dark ring; the back and wings are silver gray; and the legs are yellow. The eyes are yellow with red rims. This gull takes three years to reach its breeding plumage; its appearance changes with each fall moult. The average lifespan of an individual that reaches adulthood is 10.9 years Distribution and habitat The ring-billed gulls' breeding habitat is near lakes, rivers, or the coast in Canada and the northern United States. They nest colonially on the ground, often on islands. This bird tends to be faithful to its nesting site, if not its mate, from year to year. The ring-billed gull is a familiar sight in American parking lots, where it can regularly be found congregating in large numbers. In some areas, it is displacing less aggressive birds such as the common tern. They are migratory and most move south to the Gulf of Mexico and the Atlantic and Pacific coasts of North America, and the Great Lakes. = Vagrancy = This gull is a regular wanderer to western Europe. In Ireland and Great Britain it is no longer classed as a rarity, with several birds regularly wintering in those countries. Diet Ring billed gull in Weed, California Ring-billed gulls forage in flight or pick up objects while swimming, walking or wading. They also steal food from other birds and frequently scavenge. They are omnivorous; their diet may include insects, fish, grain, eggs, earthworms and rodents. These birds are opportunistic and have adapted well to taking food when discarded or even left unattended by people. It is regarded as a pest by many beach-goers because of its willingness to steal unguarded food on crowded beaches. The birds congregate at beaches, marinas, docks and parks where people will hand feed them. The gull's natural enemies are rats, foxes, dogs, cats, raccoons, coyotes, eagles, hawks, and owls. Status In the late 19th century, the ring-billed gull was hunted for its plumage. Its population has since rebounded and it is probably the most common gull in North America.

It is a dark reddish to greyish-brown, with spotted sides and half of a white ring around the back of the neck. This species is found in the boreal forests of Northern and Central Europe to Siberia. This is a sedentary species, meaning that adults are resident throughout the year in its range. The exception may be during harsh winters, when the adults may move south. Young of the species usually move in autumn or winter. Habitat This owl can be found primarily in coniferous forests of the taiga and higher mountainous regions with coniferous and mixed forests. These areas generally have cooler temperatures and higher rainfall than nearby lowland regions. The owl usually lives along the edges of clearings surrounded by moist or swampy land, generally with a water source nearby. It nests in old woodpecker holes, often those of the great spotted woodpecker. Description The Eurasian pygmy owl is usually red-tinged to a greyish-brown with dots on its back. The tail is generally darker than the body with five narrow, whitish bars. It has a small, short head with white to grey eyebrows and yellow eyes. It lacks the ear tufts that many other owls have. There is a white half collar on the back of the neck. The belly is mostly white with brown speckles. The beak is a greyish yellow and hook-shaped. In order to be able to carry larger vertebrate prey, it has evolved disproportionately large feet. The legs and toes are a brownish-yellow with black talons. Females are 17.4 to 19 centimetres (6.8 to 7.5 inches) long, and males are generally smaller, measuring 15.2 to 17 centimetres (6 to 6.7 inches) in length. Females are about 67 to 77 grams, and males are 50 to 65 grams in weight. Call The call of the Eurasian pygmy owl is much higher in pitch than what is generally perceived as a normal owl \\"hoot\\". The call of the male is a monotonous chain of clear, fluted notes spaced by about two seconds. The call of the female is similar, but higher in pitch. Before and after the mating season, both males and females make a five to seven note rise on the pitch scale. Breeding Chicks in a nest box egg of Glaucidium passerinum - MHNT This owl nests in tree cavities, often in old woodpecker holes. It prefers conifers but will occupy birches and beeches. Pairs form in autumn through early spring. During courtship the male leads the female through his territory. If he has obtained a nest hole, he leads her to it. The male will also feed the female. This species is serially monogamous, forming bonded pairs for one or more breeding seasons. The male is territorial and may use the same nesting territory for up to seven years. The female lays about four to seven eggs, generally in April. They are incubated for four weeks, starting when the third egg is laid. They hatch nearly simultaneously and the female remains with them for nine to ten days, being fed by the male. After three weeks the young are active and the female returns to the nest only to feed them and clean out waste. Fledging occurs at 30 to 34 days. The chicks remain close to the nest for a few days before departing. Feeding The diet of the Eurasian pygmy owl includes mostly small mammals, such as voles, lemmings, bats, and mice, and small birds such as thrushes, crossbills, chaffinches, and leaf-warblers. They are able to catch birds in flight. Other prey items may include lizards, fish, and insects. Pygmy owls store large quantities of small mammals and birds in the food stores they collect in the autumn and that will be used throughout the winter to supplement their diet . Their food hoarding behaviour is deeply influenced by weather conditions , making them susceptible to climatic changes. This owl is crepuscular, being active during the daylight hours near sunrise and sunset. Notes References *Sparks, J. and T. Soper. Owls. New York: Facts On File, 1989. *Wardhaugh, A. A.

From 1979 to 2001 he was a backbencher Member of Parliament (MP) in the House of Commons. Early life He is a nephew of the former Independent Labour Party leader and World War I conscientious objector, James Maxton. His father, also named John Maxton, was also a conscientious objector in World War I, and the younger John Maxton was himself a conscientious objector from 1955 to 1957, working on building sites and in farming. He was educated at Lord Williams's Grammar School, Thame, and subsequently attended University College, Oxford. Political career He joined the Labour Party in 1970 and became a prominent campaigner as Vice Chairman of the group Scottish Labour Against the Market during the 1975 referendum on continuing British membership of the Common Market. He was selected to oppose the sitting MP, the Shadow Secretary of State for Scotland, Teddy Taylor, at the 1979 general election in the Glasgow Cathcart constituency. The changing demographics of the area and Labour's increasing popularity in Scotland made it a winnable seat, and Maxton's victory was made more likely by the Conservative Party's strident opposition to the Scottish National Party, which drove some of its voters back to Labour. Maxton was the only Labour candidate at that election to gain a seat won by the Conservatives at the previous general election. In Parliament, he allied with the left in the Tribune Group, and voted against the Falklands War. In 1983, his constituency was redrawn to his disadvantage, but Maxton ruled out a move to any neighbouring and more favourable areas; he therefore notionally gained his seat from the Conservatives again in the 1983 general election. Maxton was a popular backbencher, but did not obtain much support when he stood for election to the Labour Shadow Cabinet. He was Labour's Scottish Whip in 1985Scottish Government Yearbook 1986, page 13. and a spokesman on Scottish Affairs from 1985‚Äì1992. He stood down from the House of Commons at the 2001 general election and was given a life peerage on 17 June 2004, as Baron Maxton, of Blackwaterfoot in Ayrshire and Arran.

It is native to Europe, but has been introduced around the world. Name The name fallow is derived from the deer's pale brown color. The Latin word dƒÅma or damma, used for roe deer, gazelles, and antelopes, lies at the root of the modern scientific name, as well as the German Damhirsch, French daim, Dutch damhert, and Italian daino. In Croatian and Serbian, the name for the fallow deer is jelen lopatar (\\"shovel deer\\"), due to the form of its antlers. The Modern Hebrew name of the fallow deer is yachmur (◊ô◊ó◊û◊ï◊®). Taxonomy Some taxonomists include the rarer Persian fallow deer as a subspecies (D. d. mesopotamica), while others treat it as a different species (D. mesopotamica). The white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) was once classified as Dama virginiana and the mule deer or black-tailed deer (Odocoileus hemionus) as Dama hemionus; they were given a separate genus in the 19th century. Description Male (buck) Mature buck showing common darker colouring of a winter coat with lighter area around the tail The male fallow deer is known as a buck, the female is a doe, and the young a fawn. Adult bucks are long, in shoulder height, and typically in weight; does are long, in shoulder height, and in weight. The largest bucks may measure long and weigh .Burnie D and Wilson DE (Eds.), Animal: The Definitive Visual Guide to the World's Wildlife. DK Adult (2005), Fawns are born in spring around and weigh around . Their lifespan is around 12‚Äì16 years. Much variation occurs in the coat colour of the species, with four main variants: common, menil, melanistic, and leucistic ‚Äì a genuine colour variety, not albinistic.The British Deer Society White is the lightest coloured, almost white; common and menil are darker, and melanistic is very dark, sometimes even black (and is easily confused with the sika deer). * Common: Chestnut coat with white mottles, it is most pronounced in summer with a much darker, unspotted coat in the winter. The light-coloured area around the tail is edged with black. The tail is light with a black stripe. * Menil: Spots are more distinct than common in summer and no black is seen around the rump patch or on the tail. In winter, spots are still clear on a darker brown coat. * Melanistic (black): All year the coat is black, shading to greyish-brown. No light-coloured tail patch or spots are seen. White variants of fallow deer in the Beijing Zoo * Leucistic (white, but not albino): Fawns are cream-coloured; adults become pure white, especially in winter. Dark eyes and nose are seen. The coat has no spots.Prior, John. Dear Watch. David & Charles Inc., 1987. p. 80. Most herds consist of the common coat variation, yet animals of the menil coat variation are not rare. The melanistic coat variation is generally rarer, and the white coat variation is very much rarer still, although wild New Zealand herds often have a high melanistic percentage.New Zealand Hunting Info A skeleton of a stag (male) exhibited at the Mammal Gallery in the Natural History Museum of Pisa University A pair of fallow deer antlers Only bucks have antlers, which are broad and shovel-shaped (palmate) from three years. In the first two years the antler is a single spike. They are grazing animals; their preferred habitat is mixed woodland and open grassland. During the rut bucks spread out and females move between them; at that time of year fallow deer are relatively ungrouped compared with the rest of the year, when they try to stay together in groups of up to 150. Agile and fast in case of danger, fallow deer can run at a maximum speed of The Deer of the Ranch of America over short distances. Being naturally less muscular than other cervids such as the roe deer, they are not as fast. Fallow deer can also jump up to high and up to in length. History Skeleton of the extinct subspecies Dama dama geiselana The fallow deer was native to most of Europe during the last interglacial. In the Pleistocene (the last ice age) the distribution was restricted to the Middle East and refugia in parts of the Mediterranean Basin: Sicily, Anatolia and the Balkan.Fern√°ndez-Garc√≠a, J. L. (2012) The endangered Dama dama mesopotamica: genetic variability, allelic loss and hybridization signals. Contributions to Zoology, 81.4, 223-233. Pleistocene fallow deer were larger, extant populations have evolved into smaller animals. Humans began to expand the distribution of this deer in the last two millennia by introducing it throughout Europe and further afield. In the Levant, fallow deer were an important source of meat in Palaeolithic cultures (420,000‚Äì200,000 BCE), as is shown by bones, also used for conserving the marrow to be eaten weeks after the kill, found in the Qesem cave, but the species appears to have disappeared from the southern Levant in the following Epipalaeolithic Natufian culture, 13,000‚Äì7,500 BCE, although gazelle and especially roe deer proliferated, perhaps because of climate change (increased aridity and the decrease of wooded areas), in combination with changing land use patterns and hunting pressure. At the same time the taxon persisted in the north in the Galilee region and the north of the West Bank. Distribution =Native= Rhodes, Greece The Rhodian population of fallow deer are smaller on average than those of central and northern Europe, though they are similarly coloured. In 2005, the Rhodian fallow deer was found to be genetically distinct from all other populations and to be of urgent conservation concern. At the entrance to the harbour of Rhodes city, statues of a fallow deer buck and doe now grace the location where the Colossus of Rhodes once stood. =Introduced= Outside of Europe, this species has been introduced to to Antigua and Barbuda, Argentina, South Africa, Fernando P√≥, S√£o Tom√©, Madagascar, Mauritius, Mayotte, R√©union, the Seychelles, the Comoros, Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, Cyprus, Israel, Cape Verde, Lebanon, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, the United States, the Falkland Islands, and Peru.Long, J. L. (2003). Introduced Mammals of the World: Their History, Distribution and Influence (Cabi Publishing) . Argentina The fallow deer was introduced to Victoria Island in Neuqu√©n Province by billionaire Aaron Anchorena, who intended to increase hunting opportunities. He freed wildlife of European and Asian origin, making them common inhabitants of the island. Great Britain and Ireland The fallow deer was spread across central Europe by the Romans. The Normans are thought to have first introduced them to Great Britain from Sicily for hunting in the royal forests. However, recent finds at Fishbourne Roman Palace show that fallow deer were introduced into southern England in the 1st century AD. Whether these escaped to form a feral colony, or whether they died out and were reintroduced by the Normans is unknown. Fallow deer are now widespread on the U.K. mainland and are present in most of England and Wales below a line drawn from the Wash to the Mersey. Populations in the New Forest and the Forest of Dean are long-standing, and many of the other populations originated from park escapees. They are not quite so widespread in the northern parts of England, but are present in most lowland areas and also in parts of Scotland, principally in Strathtay and around Loch Lomond. According to the British Deer Society distribution survey 2007, they have increased in range since the previous survey in 2000, although the increase in range is not as spectacular as for some of the other deer species. A significant number of the fallow deer in the Forest of Dean and in Epping Forest are of the black variety. One particularly interesting population, known as \\"long-haired fallow deer\\", inhabit Mortimer Forest on the England/Wales border; a significant part of the population has long body hair with distinct ear tufts. A historical herd is at Phoenix Park in Ireland where a herd of 400‚Äì450 fallow deer descends from the original herd introduced in the 1660s. Three of the fallow deer colour variants found at the Fossil Rim Wildlife Center in Texas New Zealand From 1860, fallow deer were introduced into New Zealand. Significant herds exist in a number of low- altitude forests.Hunting: Things to do South Africa Fallow deer are popular in the rural areas of KwaZulu-Natal for hunting purposes, in parts of the Gauteng province to beautify ranches, and in the Eastern Cape where they were introduced on game farms for the hunting industry because of their exotic qualities. Fallow deer adapted extremely well to the South African environment with access to savanna grasslands and particularly in the cooler climate ranges such as the highveld. Sweden One noted historical herd of fallow deer is located in the Ottenby nature reserve in √ñland, where Charles X Gustav of Sweden erected a dry stone wall some 4 km long to enclose a royal fallow deer herd in the mid-17th century; the herd still exists as of 2006.Environmental Baseline Study, Lumina Technologies, √ñland, Sweden, July, 2004 United States In recent times, fallow deer have been introduced in parts of the United States. A small feral population exists on one barrier island in Georgia. Fallow deer have also been introduced in Texas, along with many other exotic deer species, where they are often hunted on large game ranches. In Pennsylvania, fallow deer are considered livestock, since no feral animals are breeding in the wild. Occasional reports of wild fallow deer in Pennsylvania and Indiana are generally attributed to escapes from preserves or farms. A herd of white fallow deer is located near Argonne National Laboratories in northeastern Illinois.And another in Willits CA. on the famous Sea Biscuit Ranch. They number about 50 and have resided there for the last 50 years Herd of white deer roams Argonne campus. White fallow deer near Argonne National Labs in Westmont, Illinois, U.S. A small herd of 15 mostly white fallow deer resides at the Belle Isle Nature Zoo on Belle Isle in Detroit, Michigan. Until the turn of the 21st century, this herd had the run of the island; the herd was thereafter confined, with extirpation being the initial goal. A small herd, believed to be the oldest in the United States, exists in the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area (LBL) in far western Kentucky and Tennessee. The fallow deer herd in the LBL \\"was brought to LBL by the Hillman Land Company in 1918. LBL's herd is believed to be the oldest population of fallow deer in the country, and at one time was the largest. Today, the herd numbers fewer than 150 and hunting of fallow deer is not permitted. Although LBL's wildlife management activities focus on native species, the fallow herd is maintained for wildlife viewing and because of its historical significance.\\" Fallow deer are present in the Point Reyes National Seashore, California; some of them are white.  Mating system  Fallow deer are highly dimorphic, polygynous breeders;Feldhamer, G. A., Farris-Renner, K. C., & Barker, C. M. (1988). Dama dama. Mammalian Species, 97(317), 1‚Äì8. .McElligot, A. G., Mattiangeli, V., Mattiello, S., Verga, M., Reynolds, C. A., & Hayden, T. (1998). Fighting tactics of fallows bucks (Dama dama, Cervidae): Reducing the Risks of Serious Conflict. Ethology, 104(9), 789‚Äì803. . the breeding season or rut lasts approximately 135 days. In the Northern hemisphere the breeding season tends to occur in the second half of October, while it occurs in April in the south, some matings can still occur before and after.Thirgood, S. J. (1991). Alternative Mating Strategies and Reproductive Success in Fallow Deer. Behaviour, 116(1/2), 1‚Äì10. . . This mating behaviour within the rut most often occurs in leks, where males congregate in small groups on mating territories in which the females‚Äô only purpose for visiting these territories is for copulation. There can be variation within fallow deer mating systems; other than the traditional behaviour of lekking, different types of mating behaviours can include harems, dominance groups, stands, temporary stands, and multiple stands.Langbein, J. & Thirgood, S. J. (1989). Variation in Mating Systems of Fallow Deer (Dama dama) in Relation to Ecology. Ethology, 83(3), 195‚Äì214. . Different populations, environmental variation, size, and even age can determine the type of variation within a fallow deer mating system, but lekking behaviour is the most commonly found and studied in nature; variation can be explained by three characteristics (1) the optimal strategy under specific environmental or social conditions, (2) the strategy of an individual may be dependent on the strategies of other individual males within the same population and (3) individual males may be less capable at gaining access to females, since they can be outcompeted by other males that are more capable. Lek mating systems are important to understanding, which leads to fewer studies focusing on the reproductive success of males away from the lek or other mating system types. The females are polyestrous, meaning that during their sexual cycle the females will \\"heat up\\", which means that they are ready to mate and willing to accept a male, but if this does not occur, the \\"heat\\" will come repeatedly throughout the breeding season. The heat is usually referred to as increased serum progesterone levels in the female fallow deer and is associated with the corpora lutea. The male rut behaviour includes licking and sniffing the anal area of the female and the hair below the vulva, this helps the male to determine if the female is fertile. A high-pitched whine is used many times to initiate mating behaviour; after the male displays this a number of times, the female will eventually allow the male to mount; copulation can last as long as 5 minutes. = Ecology and mating system characteristics = Fallow deer herd Many deer species‚Äîincluding fallow deer‚Äîhave a social organization which can be tremendously plastic depending on their environment, meaning that group size and habitat type are closely linked to herd size.Putman, R. J. (1986). Grazing in temperate ecosystems: Large herbivores and the ecology of the New Forest. Croom Helm: Beckenham. It is important to note that most of the detailed research on the ecological characteristics and behaviour of fallow deer occur in large blocks of woodland, which means there may be some bias present. Fallow deer can be found in a variety of habitats, which can range from cool and wet to hot and dry. Fallow deer seem to have a preference for older forests with dispersed areas of grass, trees, and a variety of other vegetation. The largest herd occurs right before the rutting season, while the smallest groups are females with fawns. Throughout a large portion of the year the sexes remain separated and only congregate during the mating months; however, other patterns may be described, such as bachelor groups and even mixed groups. In male fallow deer, their low frequency groans are produced by vocal tracts that are of consistent but complex shape. Experimentation showed that vocal production of these groans are dependent on both their nasal and oral cavities. Ruts are characterized by males gaining the best territory possible to increase their odds for mating and are often characterized by the presence of females on stands. During this time, males will stop feeding to defend their ruts from subordinate males. Males defending this territory will often lose an average of 17% of their body weight, and the liver will exhibit steatosis, which is reversible. Throughout breeding seasons, the male may obtain the same rut; in some cases, ruts can be held by more than one individual; some possibilities for this include high population density and less rut space, or more suitable habitats which can be shared. = Parental care = Mother fallow deer and fawn After the females are impregnated, the gestation period lasts up to 245 days and usually one fawn is born, as twins can be quite rare. The females can conceive when they are 16 months old, whereas the males can successfully breed at 16 months, but most do not breed until they are 48 months old. The females can become very cagey just before they give birth to their fawn and find secluded areas such as a bush or cave; sometimes females will give birth near the herd. As soon as the female gives birth, the female will then lick the fawn to clean it; this helps initiate the maternal bond between the two, females are the only sex that provides parental investment; males do not participate in rearing the fawn. After the birth of the fawn occurs, the females do not return to the herd for at least 10 days and for most of the days the mother is separated from the fawn, returning only to feed the fawn. The nursing period lasts about 4 months and happens every 4 hours each day. Rumination is a critical part of development in the fawn‚Äôs life, and this develops about 2 to 3 weeks into the fawn's life. Females initiate the weaning periods for the fawn which lasts about 20 days; 3 to 4 weeks; later, the fawn will start to follow its mother, and they will finally rejoin the herd together. The mother frequently licks the fawn's anal area to stimulate suckling, urination, and defecation, which is a critical part of the development of the fawn. Weaning is completed at around 7 months and at around 12 months the fawn is independent; after the 135 days of reproduction, the rut comes to an end, which can be characterized by the changes in group size and behaviour. = Contests and weaponry = Fallow deer bucks fighting at Charlecote Park Since fallow deer are polygynous species that congregate once every year, males must fight to obtain access to estrous females.Bergeron, P., Festa-Bianchet, M., von Hardenberg, A., & Bassano, B. (2008). Heterogeneity in Male Horn Growth and Longevity in a Highly Sexually Dimorphic Ungulate. Oikos, 117(1), 77‚Äì82. . . The relationship between antler size and body condition can be treated as indicators to reflect body condition within a given year.Ciuti, S., & Apollonio, M. (2011). Do Antlers Honestly Advertise the Phenotypic Quality of Fallow Buck (Dama dama) in a Lekking Population? Ethology, 117(2), 133‚Äì144. . These secondary sexual characteristics can have dual functions, which include the attractiveness of males which females can ultimately choose and fighting ability of the male.Darwin, C. (1859). On the Origin of Species by Means of Natural Selection. (Murray, London).Darwin, C. (1871) The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex.Andersson M. (1994). Sexual selection. Princeton University Press, Princeton, New Jersey It was found that males with larger antlers had higher mating success, where males with asymmetrical antlers did not. When males develop their antlers, there are always trade-offs between reproduction and survival, which can shape the decision in an individual's choice. Genetic variations exist within fallow deer populations with variable antler growth, males that exhibited faster- growing antlers early in life are able to grow longer antlers without any significant cost; this shows that there is, in fact, phenotypic variation among fallow deer populations. Aggressive behaviour is often observed when individuals are seeking out mates, scarce resources, and even territories.Jennings, D. J., Boys, R. J., & Gammell, M. P. (2017). Weapon damage is associated with contest dynamics but not mating success in fallow deer (Dama dama). Biology Letters, 13(11), 20170565. . Species that compete using their weapons usually engage when there is a mutual agreement, but if there are any noticeable asymmetries such as a broken or lost weapon this may alter the behaviour of an individual to engage in a fight. Likelihood and severity of antler damage were looked at in fallow deer, to test whether antler damage was associated with contest tactics and duration, and if there was an association with the tendency for individuals to engage in fighting. Individuals with undamaged antlers were more likely to attack, using high-risk tactics which included jumping, clashing, or backward-pushing behaviour, this was exhibited by both contestants; dominant males were more likely to have damaged antlers. Dominance ranks exist within fallow deer populations, which can be linked to aggression level and body size; when competing for a male, however, how ranks are obtained is not studied extensively.Jennings, D. J., Carlin, C. M., Hayden, T. J., & Gammell, M. P. (2010). Investment in fighting in relation to body condition, age and dominance rank in the male fallow deer, Dama dama. Animal Behaviour, 79(6), 1293‚Äì1300. . = Endurance rivalry = Male fallow deer Male fallow deer are highly competitive during the rutting season; successful mating depends mainly on body size and dominance rank.McElligott, A. G., Gammell, M. P., Harty, H. C., Paini, D. R., Murphy, D. T., Walsh, J. T., & Hayden, T. J. (2001). Sexual size dimorphism in fallow deer (Dama dama): Do larger, heavier males gain greater mating success? Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 49(4), 266‚Äì272. . . Many factors can determine the seasonal reproductive success of an individual male fallow deer; these factors include body size, which can affect reproduction and survival. The amount of time spent in a lek can be an important factor in determining male reproductive success; energy can play an important role for the duration of competitive leks.Craig, A. S., Herman, L. M., Gabriele, C. M., & Pack, A. A. (2003). Migratory timing of humpback whales (Megaptera novaengliae) in the central North Pacific varies with age, sex and reproductive status. Behaviour, 140(8), 981‚Äì1001. . . Among ungulates, fallow deer exhibit one of the most outstanding examples of sexual dimorphism, as males are much larger than females. For sexual selection to lead to the evolution of sexual dimorphism, where males are bigger than females, there must be advantages: (1) advantages during combat, (2) endurance rivalry advantage, (3) female preference for larger males and (4) advantages during sperm competition. Sexual selection has chosen bigger males over an evolutionary time scale and conferred advantages during competition of mates by a variety of mechanisms, which are intrasexual competition, access to females, and resource accessibility, which effects female attractiveness. Body size is important during male-male agonistic interactions and endurance rivalry, while females tend to have a preference for larger males.Alonso, J. C., Maga√±a, M., Palac√≠n, C., & Carlos, M. A. (2010). Correlates of male mating success in great bustard leks: the effects of age, weight, and display effort. Behavioral Ecology and Sociobiology, 64(10), 1589‚Äì1600. . . Dominance rank is a good indicator of body size and body mass, however, age was not an important factor. In a study done by McElligott et al. (2001), it was found that mating success was related to body size, pre-rut and rut rank. Similarly, in another study, researchers found that age, weight, and display effort were all significant factors in determining mating success; in both studies, mating success was measured by the frequency of copulations, which means that a variety of factors in different fallow deer populations can affect the overall energy allocation which will ultimately affect mating success. Maternal investment early in life can be critical to the development of body size, since it can be quite variable at that stage depending on resources and habitat type. Mature male body size can be a better indicator of overall male quality rather than body mass, since body mass depends on a variety of resources each year and is not a static trait; body mass can be a complex trait to measure.

P. Grice, H. Paul Grice, or Paul Grice, was a British philosopher of language, whose work on meaning has influenced the philosophical study of semantics. He is known for his theory of implicature. Life Born and raised in Harborne (now a suburb of Birmingham), in the United Kingdom, he was educated at Clifton College\\"Clifton College Register\\" Muirhead, J.A.O. p431: Bristol; J.W Arrowsmith for Old Cliftonian Society; April, 1948 and then at Corpus Christi College, Oxford.publish.uwo.ca/~rstainto/papers/Grice.pdf After a brief period teaching at Rossall School, he went back to Oxford where he taught at St John's College until 1967. In that year, he moved to the United States to take up a professorship at the University of California, Berkeley, where he taught until his death in 1988. He returned to the UK in 1979 to give the John Locke lectures on Aspects of Reason. He reprinted many of his essays and papers in his valedictory book, Studies in the Way of Words (1989). He was married and had two children. Grice on meaning One of Grice's two most influential contributions to the study of language and communication is his theory of meaning, which he began to develop in his article \\"Meaning\\", written in 1948 but published only in 1957 at the prodding of his colleague, P. F. Strawson.See discussion of this history in Russell Dale, The Theory of Meaning, Chapter 1, endnote 31, p. 34. See Chapter 2, \\"The Theory of Meaning in the Twentieth Century\\" for background on Grice's ideas in the 1957 paper \\"Meaning\\". Grice further developed his theory of meaning in the fifth and sixth of his William James lectures on \\"Logic and Conversation\\", delivered at Harvard in 1967. These two lectures were initially published as \\"Utterer's Meaning and Intentions\\" in 1969 and \\"Utterer's Meaning, Sentence Meaning, and Word Meaning\\" in 1968, and were later collected with the other lectures as the first section of Studies in the Way of Words in 1989. =Natural vs. non- natural meaning= In the 1957 article \\"Meaning\\", Grice describes \\"natural meaning\\" using the example of \\"Those spots mean (meant) measles.\\" And describes \\"non-natural meaning\\" using the example of \\"John means that he'll be late\\" or \\"'Schnee' means 'snow'\\". Grice does not define these two senses of the verb 'to mean', and does not offer an explicit theory that separates the ideas they're used to express. Instead, he relies on five differences in ordinary language usage to show that we use the word in (at least) two different ways.Grice 1989, pp. 213‚Äì215. =Intention-based semantics= For the rest of \\"Meaning\\", and in his discussions of meaning in \\"Logic and Conversation\\", Grice deals exclusively with non-natural meaning. His overall approach to the study of non-natural meaning later came to be called \\"intention-based semantics\\" because it attempts to explain non-natural meaning based on the idea of a speakers' intentions.Schiffer 1982.Borg 2006.Russell Dale, The Theory of Meaning (1996). To do this, Grice distinguishes two kinds of non-natural meaning: Utterer's meaning: What a speaker means by an utterance. (Grice wouldn't introduce this label until \\"Logic and Conversation.\\" The more common label in contemporary work is \\"speaker meaning\\", though Grice didn't use that term.) Timeless meaning: The kind of meaning that can be possessed by a type of utterance, such as a word or a sentence. (This is often called \\"conventional meaning\\", although Grice didn't call it that.) The two steps in intention-based semantics are (1) to define utterer's meaning in terms of speakers' overt audience-directed intentions, and then (2) to define timeless meaning in terms of utterer's meaning. The net effect is to define all linguistic notions of meaning in purely mental terms, and to thus shed psychological light on the semantic realm. Grice tries to accomplish the first step by means of the following definition: > \\"A meantNN something by x\\" is roughly equivalent to \\"A uttered x with the > intention of inducing a belief by means of the recognition of this > intention\\".Grice 1989, p. 219. (In this definition, 'A' is a variable ranging over speakers and 'x' is a variable ranging over utterances.) Grice generalises this definition of speaker meaning later in 'Meaning' so that it applies to commands and questions, which, he argues, differ from assertions in that the speaker intends to induce an intention rather than a belief.Grice 1989, p. 220. Grice's initial definition was controversial, and seemingly gives rise to a variety of counterexamples,Schiffer 1972, pp.17‚Äì29. and so later adherents of intention-based semantics‚Äîincluding Grice himself,Grice 1968, 1989. Stephen Schiffer,Schiffer 1972, ch. 3. Jonathan Bennett,Bennett 1976, ch.5 Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson,Sperber and Wilson 1986, pp.21‚Äì31. and Stephen NealeNeale 1992, pp.544‚Äì550.‚Äîhave attempted to improve on it in various ways while keeping the basic idea intact. Grice next turns to the second step in his program: explaining the notion of timeless meaning in terms of the notion of utterer's meaning. He does so very tentatively with the following definition: > \\"x meansNN (timeless) that so-and-so\\" might as a first shot be equated with > some statement or disjunction of statements about what \\"people\\" (vague) > intend (with qualifications about \\"recognition\\") to effect by x. The basic idea here is that the meaning of a word or sentence results from a regularity in what speakers use the word or sentence to mean. Grice would give a much more detailed theory of timeless meaning in his sixth Logic and Conversation lecture.Grice 1968. A more influential attempt to expand on this component of intention-based semantics has been given by Stephen Schiffer.Schiffer 1972, chs. 4 and 5. Grice's theory of implicature Grice's most influential contribution to philosophy and linguistics is his theory of implicature, which started in his 1961 article, 'The Causal Theory of Perception', and was most fully developed in his 1967 \\"Logic and Conversation\\", at Harvard's 'William James Lectures'.Grice 1989, chs.1‚Äì7. =Saying/implicating distinction= According to Grice, what a speaker means by an utterance can be divided into what the speaker \\"says\\" and what the speaker thereby \\"implicates\\".Neale 1992, pp.523‚Äì524. Grice makes it clear that the notion of saying he has in mind, though related to a colloquial sense of the word, is somewhat technical, referring to it as \\"a favored notion of 'saying' that must be further elucidated\\".Grice 1989, p.86. Nonetheless, Grice never settled on a full elucidation or definition of his favoured notion of saying, and the interpretation of this notion has become a contentious issue in the philosophy of language. One point of controversy surrounding Grice's favoured notion of saying is the connection between it and his concept of utterer's meaning. Grice makes it clear that he takes saying to be a kind of meaning, in the sense that doing the former entails doing the latter: \\"I want to say that (1) \\"U (utterer) said that p\\" entails (2) \\"U did something x by which U meant that p\\" (87).Grice 1989, p.87. This condition is controversial, but Grice argues that apparent counterexamples‚Äîcases in which a speaker apparently says something without meaning it‚Äîare actually examples of what he calls \\"making as if to say\\", which can be thought of as a kind of \\"mock saying\\" or \\"play saying\\".Neale 1992, p.554. Another point of controversy surrounding Grice's notion of saying is the relationship between what a speaker says with an expression and the expression's timeless meaning. Although he attempts to spell out the connection in detail several times,Grice 1989, pp.87‚Äì88. the most precise statement that he endorses is the following one: > In the sense in which I am using the word say, I intend what someone has > said to be closely related to the conventional meaning of the words (the > sentence) he has uttered.Grice 1989, p.25. Unfortunately, Grice never spelled out what he meant by the phrase \\"closely related\\" in this passage, and philosophers of language continue to debate over its best interpretation. In 'The Causal Theory of Perception', Grice contrasts saying (which he there also calls \\"stating\\") with \\"implying\\", but in Logic and Conversation he introduces the technical term \\"implicature\\" and its cognates \\"to implicate\\" and \\"implicatum\\" (i.e., that which is implicated).Grice 1989, p.24. Grice justifies this neologism by saying that \\"'Implicature' is a blanket word to avoid having to make choices between words like 'imply', 'suggest', 'indicate', and 'mean'\\". Grice sums up these notions by suggesting that to implicate is to perform a \\"non-central\\" speech act, whereas to say is to perform a \\"central\\" speech act.Grice 1989, p.88. As others have more commonly put the same distinction, saying is a kind of \\"direct\\" speech act whereas implicating is an \\"indirect\\" speech act. This latter way of drawing the distinction is an important part of John Searle's influential theory of speech acts.Searle 1975. =Conventional vs. conversational implicature= Although Grice is best known for his theory of conversational implicature, he also introduced the notion of conventional implicature. The difference between the two lies in the fact that what a speaker conventionally implicates by uttering a sentence is tied in some way to the timeless meaning of part of the sentence, whereas what a speaker conversationally implicates is not directly connected with timeless meaning. Grice's best-known example of conventional implicature involves the word 'but', which, he argues, differs in meaning from the word 'and' only in that we typically conventionally implicate something over and above what we say with the former but not with the latter. In uttering the sentence 'She was poor but she was honest', for example, we say merely that she was poor and she was honest, but we implicate that poverty contrasts with honesty (or that her poverty contrasts with her honesty).Neale 1992, p.521‚Äì522. Grice makes it clear that what a speaker conventionally implicates by uttering a sentence is part of what the speaker means in uttering it, and that it is also closely connected to what the sentence means. Nonetheless, what a speaker conventionally implicates is not a part of what the speaker says. > U's doing x might be his uttering the sentence \\"She was poor but she was > honest\\". What U meant, and what the sentence means, will both contain > something contributed by the word \\"but\\", and I do not want this contribution > to appear in an account of what (in my favored sense) U said (but rather as > a conventional implicature). Grice did not elaborate much on the notion of conventional implicature, but many other authors have tried to give more extensive theories of it, including Lauri Karttunen and Stanley Peters,Karttunen and Peters 1978. Kent Bach,Bach 1999. Stephen Neale,Neale 1999. and Christopher Potts.Potts 2005. =Conversational implicature= To conversationally implicate something in speaking, according to Grice, is to mean something that goes beyond what one says in such a way that it must be inferred from non-linguistic features of a conversational situation together with general principles of communication and co-operation. The general principles Grice proposed are what he called the Cooperative principle and the Maxims of Conversation. According to Grice, the cooperative principle is a norm governing all cooperative interactions among humans. Cooperative Principle: \\"Make your contribution such as it is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged.\\" (Grice 1989: 26). The conversational maxims can be thought of as precisifications of the cooperative principle that deal specifically with communication. Maxim of Quantity: Information * Make your contribution as informative as is required for the current purposes of the exchange. * Do not make your contribution more informative than is required. Maxim of Quality: Truth * Do not say what you believe to be false. * Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence. Maxim of Relation: Relevance * Be relevant. Maxim of Manner: Clarity (\\"be perspicuous\\") * Avoid obscurity of expression. * Avoid ambiguity. * Be brief (avoid unnecessary prolixity). * Be orderly.Grice 1989, pp.26‚Äì27. Grice follows his summary of the maxims by suggesting that \\"one might need others\\", and goes on to say that \\"There are, of course, all sorts of other maxims (aesthetic, social, or moral in character), such as \\"Be polite\\", that are also normally observed by participants in exchanges, and these may also generate nonconventional implicatures.\\"Grice 1989, pp.28. Conversational implicatures are made possible, according to Grice, by the fact that the participants in a conversation always assume each other to behave according to the maxims. So, when a speaker appears to have violated a maxim by saying or making as if to say something that is false, uninformative or too informative, irrelevant, or unclear, the assumption that the speaker is in fact obeying the maxims causes the interpreter to infer a hypothesis about what the speaker really meant.Kordiƒá 1991, pp.91‚Äì92. That an interpreter will reliably do this allows speakers to intentionally \\"flout\\" the maxims‚Äîi.e., create the appearance of breaking the maxims in a way that is obvious to both speaker and interpreter‚Äîto get their implicatures across. Perhaps Grice's best-known example of conversational implicature is the case of the reference letter, a \\"quantity implicature\\" (i.e., because it involves flouting the first maxim of Quantity): > A is writing a testimonial about a pupil who is a candidate for a philosophy > job, and his letter reads as follows: \\"Dear Sir, Mr. X's command of English > is excellent, and his attendance at tutorials has been regular. Yours, etc.\\" > (Gloss: A cannot be opting out, since if he wished to be uncooperative, why > write at all? He cannot be unable, through ignorance, to say more, since the > man is his pupil; moreover, he knows that more information than this is > wanted. He must, therefore, be wishing to impart information that he is > reluctant to write down. This supposition is tenable only if he thinks Mr. X > is no good at philosophy. This, then, is what he is implicating.)Grice 1989, > pp.33. Given that a speaker means a given proposition p by a given utterance, Grice suggests several features which p must possess to count as a conversational implicature. Nondetachability: \\"The implicature is nondetachable insofar as it is not possible to find another way of saying the same thing (or approximately the same thing) which simply lacks the implicature.\\"Grice 1989, p.43. Cancelability: \\"...a putative conversational implicature is explicitly cancelable if, to the form of words the utterance of which putatively implicates that p, it is admissible to add but not p, or I do not mean to imply that p, and it is contextually cancelable if one can find situations in which the utterance of the form of words would simply not carry the implicature.\\"Grice 1989, p.44. Non-Conventionality: \\"...conversational implicata are not part of the meaning of the expressions to the employment of which they attach.\\" Calculability: \\"The presence of a conversational implicature must be capable of being worked out; for even if it can in fact be intuitively grasped, unless the intuition is replaceable by an argument, the implicature (if present at all) will not count as a conversational implicature; it will be a conventional implicature.\\"Grice 1989, pp.31. (See also Grice 1981, p.187 and Neale 1992, p527.) =Generalized vs. particularised conversational implicature= Grice also distinguishes between generalised and particularised conversational implicature. Grice says that particularised conversational implicatures (such as in the reference letter case quoted above) arise in \\"cases in which an implicature is carried by saying that p on a particular occasion in virtue of special features about the context, cases in which there is no room for the idea that an implicature of this sort is normally carried by saying that p.\\"Grice 1989, p.37. Generalized implicature, by contrast, arise in cases in which \\"one can say that the use of a certain form of words in an utterance would normally (in the absence of special circumstances) carry such-and-such an implicature or type of implicature.\\" Grice does not offer a full theory of generalised conversational implicatures that distinguishes them from particularlised conversational implicatures, on one hand, and from conventional implicatures, on the other hand, but later philosophers and linguists have attempted to expand on the idea of generalised conversational implicatures.For a prominent example, see Levinson 2000. Grice's paradox In his book Studies in the Way of Words (1989), he presents what he calls Grice's paradox.Paul Grice, Studies in the Way of Words (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1989), pp. 78‚Äì79. In it, he supposes that two chess players, Yog and Zog, play 100 games under the following conditions: (1) Yog is white nine of ten times. (2) There are no draws. And the results are: (1) Yog, when white, won 80 of 90 games. (2) Yog, when black, won zero of ten games. This implies that: (i) 8/9 times, if Yog was white, Yog won. (ii) 1/2 of the time, if Yog lost, Yog was black. (iii) 9/10 that either Yog wasn't white or he won. From these statements, it might appear one could make these deductions by contraposition and conditional disjunction: ([a] from [ii]) If Yog was white, then 1/2 of the time Yog won. ([b] from [iii]) 9/10 times, if Yog was white, then he won. But both (a) and (b) are untrue‚Äîthey contradict (i). In fact, (ii) and (iii) don't provide enough information to use Bayesian reasoning to reach those conclusions. That might be clearer if (i)-(iii) had instead been stated like so: (i) When Yog was white, Yog won 8/9 times. (No information is given about when Yog was black.) (ii) When Yog lost, Yog was black 1/2 the time. (No information is given about when Yog won.) (iii) 9/10 times, either Yog was black and won, Yog was black and lost, or Yog was white and won. (No information is provided on how the 9/10 is divided among those three situations.) Grice's paradox shows that the exact meaning of statements involving conditionals and probabilities is more complicated than may be obvious on casual examination. Criticisms Relevance theory of Dan Sperber and Deirdre Wilson builds on and also challenges Grice's theory of meaning and his account of pragmatic inference.Relevance: Communication and Cognition (Oxford: Blackwell, 1986) Notes References * Bach, Kent (1999). \\"The Myth of Conventional Implicature,\\" Linguistics and Philosophy, 22, pp. 327‚Äì366. * Bennett, Jonathan (1976).

It is a common breakfast item in traditional American \\"farmer\\" or \\"country\\" breakfasts, as it originated as a way for farmers to make use of as much of their livestock (usually pigs) as possible. Scraps and trimmings were ground, seasoned and later consumed by the farmer as an inexpensive, high-protein morning meal. It is perhaps most popular for home consumption in rural areas, particularly in the southern states, where it is in the form of smoked or fresh or patties or links (the latter might have a natural or synthetic casing, or no form of any casing). Most diners, fast-food restaurants, and family restaurants across the country will also carry one or more versions of it during breakfast hours, whether on a sandwich, in a breakfast platter, or both; some fine-dining establishments will also have a sausage option on their breakfast or brunch menu. The cased link variety is most similar to English-style sausages and has been produced in the United States since colonial days. It is essentially a highly seasoned ground meat, so it does not keep and should be stored and handled appropriately. Newer variations made from pork and beef mixtures as well as poultry can also be found. There are also vegetarian varieties that use textured vegetable protein in place of meat. In the United States, the predominant flavorings used for seasoning are black pepper or white pepper and sage, although there are varieties also seasoned with cayenne pepper, or even maple syrup. Some breakfast sausage is flavored with cured bacon. Breakfast sausage is normally fried in a pan, grilled, or microwaved. Some people like to put maple syrup onto their breakfast sausages. Cooked breakfast sausage is also mixed into egg casseroles before baking. Crumbled and added to white gravy, it is a central component of sausage gravy. Brands Some common US brands include: P.G. Molinari & Sons, Bob Evans, Jimmy Dean, Swaggerty's Farm, Owen's Sausage, Purnell's Old Folks Country Sausage, Tennessee Pride, Johnsonville, Farmland, and Jones.

In 2007 it had 1,279 inhabitants. History The area around Cala Gonone was inhabited in the Nuragic Era. The remains of a Nuragic settlement can be seen at Nuraghe Mannu on the outskirts of the village, just off the road to Dorgali. The modern village was founded by a colony of fishermen from the island of Ponza Historical infos on sardegnaweb.it at the beginning of the 20th century. The town however remained largely isolated from the rest of Sardinia until the tunnel through the hills from Dorgali was opened in 1860. Geography The town is situated in the Bay of Orosei on the east of the island and in the geographical region of Supramonte, 9 kilometers from Dorgali, 41 from Nuoro and 108 from Olbia. Close to the village, and reachable by the sea, is the show cave of Bue Marino. Many boats from small speedboats to large tourist boats dock in at the Bue Marino or travel further down the coast to Cala Luna to let the passengers bath in the turquoise water or explore the caves that have been hollowed out by the sea. Almost everyone that goes to the small caves writes their name in charcoal, from a small fire, on the wall, creating a huge mass of writing across several meters of the cave wall. Due to its natural environment (the territory is included in the Gennargentu National Park Gennargentu National Park official site) and to the quality of its waters, Cala Gonone is a popular tourist venue.

It is located at about 150 km north of Cagliari and 160 km south of Olbia, in the middle of the Gulf of Arbatax.  History  Santa Maria Navarrese, founded in the 1950s by Baunese settlers, has grown around a Medieval church dating back to around the AD 1000, consecrated to Santa Maria Assunta. According to tradition, the church was built on behalf of a princess of Navarra, hence the adjective Navarrese in the village's name. The place is known also for a 17th-century watchtower built on the beach and for the thousand-year old oleasters in the main square.  Geography and economy  Santa Maria Navarrese has a typical maquis shrubland seascape. Although it is part of the municipality of Baunei, it can be regarded as a separate town in some respects, mainly because Santa Maria Navarrese lies at 9,1 km (12 minutes by car) from Baunei and has a typical seaside landscape and an increasingly tourist economy, while Baunei is located inland and is mostly a mountainous town. Santa Maria Navarrese is also contiguous to the Tancau sul Mare frazione of Lotzorai and is part of a strip of Ogliastra's coastal settlements that stretches southwards to Tortol√¨ and Arbatax. It has a small, well-served tourist port, from which it is possible to reach the famous Sardinian cale: Cala Goloritz√©, Cala Luna, Cala Mariolu (also called Isp√πligi de Nie), Cala Sisine, Cala Biriala, Spiaggia dei Gabbiani and Grotta del Fico. The town remains outside most commercial tourist routes and thus still offers a rural unspoiled landscape that provides an insight in day-to-day Sardinian life and is interesting for nature trail tourism. One trekking route that is focused on nature that starts from this city is Selvaggio Blu.

Early life Sestak was born in Gonzales, Texas. He had mixed heritage, with his grandparents on his father's side being from Czechoslovakia while his grandparents on his mother's side being from Poland. Alongside his two brothers, he played in numerous sports as a child, such as football and track. http://www.polishsportshof.com/?page_id=512 He played tight end in the collegiate ranks at McNeese State University in Lake Charles, Louisiana. Career His talents led to him being drafted in the 17th round by the Buffalo Bills in 1962. He was also drafted by the Detroit Lions in the sixteenth round that year. He was an example of a trend of the young league to draft players from small colleges, which was deemed innovative in part due to its results that it cultivated, which Sestak represented well. He was to play defensive lineman for the Bills, owing to his 6-4 size, speed, and strength. Sestak was a starter in his rookie year and, until a series of knee injuries ended his career after the 1967 season, used his strength to dominate the line of scrimmage. Sestak was a three-time selection to All-American Football League teams and a unanimous All-AFL defensive tackle in three consecutive years; 1963, 1964 and 1965. Sestak served as the cornerstone of a defense that took the Bills to the playoffs four straight years (1963‚Äì1966) and consecutive AFL championships in 1964 and 1965. Over the 1964 and 1965 seasons, Sestak and his defense mates held opposing rushers without a touchdown for seventeen consecutive games, a Professional Football record that still stands. Twice during his outstanding career he realized the defensive lineman's \\"dream\\", returning interceptions for touchdowns, and once returned a recovered fumble for a score. His teammates described his play as \\"crazy as hell\\". He notably played a season with three broken ribs, and his knees problems meant that he spent time at a stationary bicycle instead of scrimmage during practice. During the 1960s, only six professional defensive linemen were unanimous All- League selections for three or more years, Sestak (3), Bob Lily (5), Merlin Olsen (4), Willie Davis (3), Gino Marchetti (3), and Deacon Jones (3). The latter five, all former NFL players, have already been inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, while Sestak, a star from the AFL, like many other AFL players has been ignored by the Hall of Fame selectors. He was named to the First Team for his position at defensive tackle, along with Houston Antwine. In contrast, Buck Buchanan (a Second Team selection) is a Hall of Famer while Sestak is not. In January 1970, Sestak was selected as a member of the All- Time All-AFL Team, and in 2009 as a member of the Bills' 50th Anniversary Team. In 2007, Tom Sestak was inducted into the National Polish American Sports Hall of Fame. In 2011, the Professional Football Researchers Association named Sestak to the PRFA Hall of Very Good Class of 2011 In 2019, despite not being in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, he was chosen as a finalist for the NFL‚Äôs 100th Anniversary Team http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000001080708/article/defensive-lineman- finalists-revealed-for-nfl-100-alltime-team Sestak died of a heart attack in 1987.

A dining car (American English) or a restaurant car (British English), also a diner, is a railroad passenger car that serves meals in the manner of a full-service, sit-down restaurant. It is distinct from other railroad food service cars that do not duplicate the full-service restaurant experience, such as buffet cars, cars in which one purchases food from a walk-up counter to be consumed either within the car or elsewhere in the train. Grill cars, in which customers sit on stools at a counter and purchase and consume food cooked on a grill behind the counter are generally considered to be an \\"intermediate\\" type of dining car. History Notice from the Central Pacific Railroad, ca. 1870 B&O; Royal Blue in 1895 =United States= Before dining cars in passenger trains were common in the United States, a rail passenger's option for meal service in transit was to patronize one of the roadhouses often located near the railroad's \\"water stops\\". Fare typically consisted of rancid meat, cold beans, and old coffee. Such poor conditions discouraged many from making the journey. Most railroads began offering meal service on trains even before the First Transcontinental Railroad. By the mid-1880s, dedicated dining cars were a normal part of long-distance trains from Chicago to points west, save those of the Santa Fe Railway, which relied on America's first interstate network of restaurants to feed passengers en route. The \\"Harvey Houses\\", located strategically along the line, served top-quality meals to railroad patrons during water stops and other planned layovers and were favored over in-transit facilities for all trains operating west of Kansas City. As competition among railroads intensified, dining car service was taken to new levels. When the Santa Fe unveiled its new Pleasure Dome lounge cars in 1951, the railroad introduced the travelling public to the Turquoise Room, promoted as \\"The only private dining room in the world on rails.\\" The room accommodated 12 guests, and could be reserved anytime for private dinner or cocktail parties, or other special functions. The room was often used by celebrities and dignitaries traveling on the Super Chief. A dining car on the Union Pacific's City of Denver, ca. 1950s. Edwin Kachel was a steward for more than twenty-five years in the Dining-Car Department of the Great Northern Railway. He said that \\"on a dining car, three elements can be considered -- the equipment, the employee, then passenger.\\" In other words, \\"the whole is constituted by two-thirds of human parts.\\" As cross-country train travel became more commonplace, passengers began to expect high-quality food to be served at the meals on board. The level of meal service on trains in the 1920s and 1930s rivaled that of high-end restaurants and clubs. =United Kingdom= They were first introduced in England on 1 November 1879 by the Great Northern Railway Company on services between Leeds and London. A Pullman car was attached to the train for the purpose. As of 2018 Great Western Railway is the only UK train company to provide a full dining Pullman service on selected trains to the West Country & Wales. Food Elegance is one of the main words used to describe the concept of dining on a train. Use of fresh ingredients was encouraged whenever possible. Some of the dishes prepared by chefs were: Braised Duck Cumberland, Hungarian Beef Goulash with Potato Dumplings, Lobster Americaine, Mountain Trout Au Bleu, Curry of Lamb Madras, Scalloped Brussels Sprouts, Pecan and Orange Sticks and Pennepicure Pie to name a few items. The Christmas menu for the Chicago, Milwaukee & St. Paul Railway in 1882 listed the following items: Hunter's Soup, Salmon with Hollandaise Sauce, Boned Pheasant in Aspic Jelly, Chicken Salad, Salmis Prairie Chicken, Oyster Patties, Rice Croquette, Roast Beef, English Ribs of Beef, Turkey with Cranberry Sauce, Stuffed Suckling Pig with Applesauce, Antelope Steak with Currant Jelly, potatoes, green peas, tomatoes, sweet potatoes, Mince Pie, Plum Pudding, Cake, Ice Cream, Fruits and coffee. Dining car configuration Pullman Dining Car In one of the most common dining car configurations, one end of the car contains a galley (with an aisle next to it, so passengers can pass through the car to the rest of the train) while the other end has table or booth seating on either side of a center aisle. Trains with high demand for dining car services sometimes feature \\"double-unit dining cars\\" consisting of two adjacent cars functioning to some extent as a single entity, generally with one car containing a galley plus table or booth seating and the other car containing table or booth seating only. In the dining cars of Amtrak's modern bilevel Superliner trains, booth seating on either side of a center aisle occupies almost the entire upper level, while the galley is below; food is sent to the upper level on a dumbwaiter. Dining cars enhance the familiar restaurant experience with the unique visual entertainment of the ever- changing view. While dining cars are less common today than in the past (having been supplemented, or in some cases replaced altogether by other types of food-service cars) they still play a significant role in passenger railroading, especially on medium- and long-distance trains. Today, a number of tourist-oriented railroads offer dinner excursions to capitalize on the public's fascination with the dining car experience. The U76/U70 tram line between the German cities of D√ºsseldorf and Krefeld offers a Bistrowagen (\\"dining car\\" in German), where passengers can order drinks and snacks. This practice comes from the early 20th Century, when interurban trams conveyed a dining car. Despite the introduction of modern tram units, 4 trams still have a Bistrowagen and operate every weekday.

In January 2002, CCB Chairman Wang Xuebing resigned from the bank after being charged with accepting bribes while he was employed with Bank of China; he was sentenced to 12 years in prison. In March 2005, his successor, Zhang Enzhao, resigned for \\"personal reasons\\". Just prior to his resignation, he had been charged in a lawsuit with accepting a US$1 million bribe. He was later sentenced to 15 years in jail in connection with the case. China Construction Bank Corporation was formed as a joint-stock commercial bank in September 2004 as a result of a separation procedure undertaken by its predecessor, China Construction Bank, under the PRC Company Law. Following the China Banking Regulatory Committee's approval on 14 September 2004, the next day the bank (Jianyin) became a separate legal entity, owned by the Chinese government holding company, Central Huijin Investment Company or simply Huijin. During the 2013 Korean crisis, the China Construction Bank halted business with a North Korean bank accused by the United States of financing Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programs. In 2015, China Construction Bank ranks the 2nd in Forbes‚Äô 13th annual Global 2000 ranking of the biggest, most powerful and most valuable companies in the world.  Investment by Bank of America  In 2005, Bank of America acquired a 9% stake in China Construction Bank for US$3 billion. It represented the company's largest foray into China's growing banking sector. Bank of America currently has offices in Hong Kong, Shanghai, and Guangzhou and sought to expand its Chinese business as a result of this deal. On or about 5 June 2008, Bank of America purchased 6 billion H-shares for approximately HK$2.42 per share using call options under a formula in the initial acquisition agreement. Bank of America now holds about 25.1 billion H-shares, representing about 10.75% of CCB's issued shares. Bank of America may not sell the 6 billion shares that it purchased from Huijin using the call option before 29 August 2011 without prior consent of CCB. Bank of America still has the option to purchase additional shares. In May 2009, speculation was raised that US$7.3 billion worth of CCB shares had been sold by BoA after being ordered to obtain more capital following the results of the Dodd-Frank Act Annual Stress Test. On August 29, 2011, Bank of America announced it would sell approximately half its stake in CCB (13.1 billion shares worth about US$8.3 billion) to an undisclosed group of investors. In September 2013, Bank of America sold its remaining stake in the China Construction Bank for as much as $1.5 billion. In June 2017, China Construction Bank (Malaysia) signs 13 Memorandum of Understandings on its opening day in Malaysia.  International expansion  In 2006, CCB acquired Bank of America (Asia), which started in 1912 in Hong Kong as Bank of Canton, and had a subsidiary in Macao. CCB opened a London office on 2 June 2009. In 2008, CCB submitted an application to the New York State Banking Department and the Federal Reserve Board to establish a branch in New York City. CCB officially opened its New York branch on 6 June 2009. In 2013, CCB opened its European Headquarters in Luxembourg. In 2016, CCB Indonesia was founded by the merger between two banks: Bank Windu Kentjana and Bank Anda.

Early years Charles Follis is believed to be the first black professional football player, having played for the Shelby Steamfitters from 1902 to 1906. Follis, a two-sport athlete, was paid for his work beginning in 1899. From its inception in as a loose coalition of various regional teams, the American Professional Football Association had comparatively few African-American players; a total of nine black people suited up for NFL teams between 1920 and 1926, including future attorney, black activist, and internationally acclaimed artist Paul Robeson, as well as famed race record producer J. Mayo Williams. Fritz Pollard and Bobby Marshall were the first black players in what is now the NFL in 1920. Pollard became the first (and until 1989, only) black coach in 1921; during the early-to-mid-1920s, the league used player-coaches and did not have separate coaching staffs. 1927 through 1933 After , all five of the black players that were still in the subsequent National Football League left the league. Several teams were kicked out of the league that year, and with a large number of available, talented white players, black players were generally the first to be removed, never to return again. For the next few years, a black player would sporadically pop up on a team: Harold Bradley Sr. played one season with the Chicago Cardinals in 1928, and David Myers played for two New York City-based teams in 1930 and 1931. In contrast, ethnic minorities of other races were fairly common. Thanks to the efforts of the Carlisle Indian School football program, which ended with the school's closure in 1918, there were numerous Native Americans in the NFL through the 1920s and 1930s, most famously Jim Thorpe. The Dayton Triangles also featured the first two Asian-Americans in the NFL, Chinese-Hawaiian running back Walter Achiu and Japanese-Scottish quarterback Arthur Matsu, both in 1928, and the first Hispanic players in the NFL, Cuban immigrant Ignacio Molinet of the 1927 Frankford Yellow Jackets and Jess Rodriguez of the 1929 Buffalo Bisons, played in the NFL during this time frame. 1934 to 1945 In 1933, the last year of integration, the NFL had two black players, Joe Lillard and Ray Kemp. Both were gone by the end of the season: Lillard, due largely to his tendency to get into fights, was not invited back to the Chicago CardinalsRoss, 1999, p. 40‚Äì45.Peterson, 1997 p. 179. despite in 1933 being responsible for almost half of the Cardinals' points, while Kemp quit of his own accord to pursue a coaching career (one that turned out to be long and successful).Minor difference in detail exists between authors (e.g., Piascik p. 2-5, Willis p. 314) Ross, 1999, p. 50. Many observers will attribute the subsequent lockout of black players to the entry of George Preston Marshall into the league in 1932. Marshall openly refused to have black athletes on his Boston Braves/Washington Redskins team, and reportedly pressured the rest of the league to follow suit. Marshall, however, was likely not the only reason: the Great Depression had stoked an increase in racism and self-inflicted segregation across the country, and internal politics likely had as much of an effect as external pressure. Marshall's hostility was specifically directed at the black race; he openly allowed (and promoted) Native Americans on his team, including his first head coach, Lone Star Dietz, widely believed to be a Native American at the time. The choice of Redskins as his team name in 1933 was in part to maintain the native connotations that came with the team's previous name, the Boston Braves. Another reason for Marshall's anti-black sentiment was to curry favor in the Southern United States. Marshall's Redskins had a strong following in that part of the country, which he vigorously defended, and he stood up against the NFL's efforts to put expansion teams in the South until Clint Murchison, Jr.'s successful extortion attempt (Murchison acquired the rights to the Redskins' fight song and threatened not to let Marshall use the song unless he got an expansion team in Dallas) led to the establishment of the Dallas Cowboys in 1960. By 1934, there were no more black players in the league.Davis, 2005, p. 98Algeo, 2006, p. 38 The NFL did not have another black player until after World War II. Most black players either ended up in the minor leagues (six joined the American Association and several others found their way into the Pacific Coast Professional Football League) or found themselves onto all-black barnstorming teams such as the Harlem Brown Bombers. Unlike in baseball, where the Negro Leagues flourished, no true football Negro league was known to exist until 1946, and by this time, the major leagues had begun reintegrating.Black players in minor professional football from the Professional Football Researchers Association Post-WWII In 1939, UCLA had one of the greatest collegiate football players in history, Kenny Washington, a senior.Strode, 1990, p. 104. Washington, an African American,Demas, 2010, pp. 28‚Äì29. was very popular,Strode, 1990, p. 142.Peterson, 1997, p. 181. and his team had garnered national attention in the print media.Demas, 2010, p. 37. After he played in the College All-Star game in August 1940, George Halas asked him not to return to Los Angeles immediately because Halas wanted to sign him to a contract with the Chicago Bears. After a week or so, Washington returned to Los Angeles without an NFL contract.MacCambridge, 2005, p. 19.Levy writes that Washington's extra week in Chicago was only \\"... apparently at the private request of George Halas\\". Levy, 2003, p. 68.Ross, 1999, p. 65.Willis, 2010, p. 329. Washington spent the majority of the early 1940s in the Pacific Coast League with the Hollywood Bears, even during World War II, during which he managed to avoid military service, thanks in part to a timely injury that forced him to miss the 1942 season but likely rendered him ineligible for service. Washington, after his injuries were healed, was a rarity in that he was a healthy, available athlete during a time when the NFL was resorting to using partially handicapped players ineligible for service, but received no interest from any NFL teams at the time. (Washington would ultimately serve a tour of duty in the armed forces in 1945 as a type of sports ambassador.) In 1946, after the Rams had received approval to move to Los Angeles and Washington returned from the war, members of the African American print media made the Los Angeles Coliseum commission aware the NFL did not have any African American playersMacCambridge, 2005, p. 41. and reminded the commission the Coliseum was supported with public funds. Therefore, its commission had to abide by an 1896 Supreme Court decision, Plessy v. Ferguson, by not leasing the stadium to a segregated team.Levy, 2003, p. 92‚Äì93. Also, they specifically suggested the Rams should give Washington a tryout. The commission advised the Rams that they would have to integrate the team with at least one African American in order to lease the Coliseum, and the Rams agreed to this condition.The Commission consisted of \\"three representatives of city, county and state government [which] was brimming with [USC] and UCLA alums.\\" MacCambridge, 2005, p. 19.Davis, 2005, p. 202.Strode writes the Los Angeles Supervisors also oversaw the Coliseum. Strode, 1990, p. 140. Subsequently, the Rams signed Washington on March 21, 1946.Coenen, 2005, p. 123.MacCambridge writes he was signed on May 4, 1946. MacCambridge, 2005, p. 19.Ross, 1999, p. 82. The signing of Washington caused \\"all hell to break loose\\" among the owners of the NFL franchises.Rathet, 1984, p. 210. The Rams added a second black player, Woody Strode, on May 7, 1946, giving them two black players going into the 1946 season. Even after this incident, racial integration was slow to come to the NFL. No team followed the Rams in re-integrating the NFL until the Detroit Lions signed Mel Groomes and Bob Mann in 1948. No black player was selected in the NFL draft until 1949 when George Taliaferro was selected in the 13th round; Taliaferro signed instead with the rival All- America Football Conference. The AAFC, which formed in 1946, was more proactive in signing black players; in 1946, the Cleveland Browns signed Marion Motley and Bill Willis, and by the time the AAFC merged with the NFL in 1950, six of the league's eight teams had signed black players, most by the league's second season in 1947. In comparison, only three of the ten NFL teams (the Rams, Lions and New York Giants) signed a black player before 1950. The Green Bay Packers followed in 1950, but the bulk of NFL teams did not sign a black player until 1952, by which time every team but the Washington Redskins had signed a black player.Hall of Fame: Permanent reintegration of pro football Marshall was quoted as saying \\"We'll start signing Negroes when the Harlem Globetrotters start signing whites.\\" The Redskins had no black players until Interior Secretary Stewart Udall threatened to evict them from D. C. Stadium unless they signed a black player. The Redskins first attempted to comply by drafting Ernie Davis, who refused to play under Marshall; the Redskins in turn traded Davis to the Cleveland Browns. The Redskins eventually signed Bobby Mitchell and two other African American players by 1962. Quotas limiting the number of black players were commonplace, and black players were often stacked into the same positions to allow them to be eliminated as a matter of competition.Rhoden, William C. (December 12, 2011). At some NFL positions, stereotypes reign. The New York Times. Retrieved April 25, 2013. Reportedly, black players routinely received lower contracts than whites in the NFL, while in the American Football League there was no such distinction based on race. Foreword by Miller Farr. Position segregation was also prevalent at this time. According to several books, such as the autobiography of Vince Lombardi, black players were stacked at \\"speed\\" positions such as defensive back but excluded from \\"intelligent\\" positions such as quarterback and center. Walt Frazier, an esteemed high school quarterback who received scholarship offers to play college football, chose to play basketball in college instead, believing he had no future as a black quarterback when his time came to play professionally (the move paid off, as Frazier would have a Hall of Fame basketball career). However, despite the NFL's segregationist policies, after the league merged with the more tolerant AFL in 1970, more than 30% of the merged league's players were African American. The American Football League had the first black placekicker in U.S. professional football, Gene Mingo of the Denver Broncos (Mingo's primary claim to fame, however, was as a running back, and was only secondarily a placekicker); and the first black regular starting quarterback of the modern era, Marlin Briscoe of the Denver Broncos. Willie Thrower was a back-up quarterback who saw some action in the 1950s for the Chicago Bears. In 1954, running back Joe Perry of the San Francisco 49ers became the first black player to be recognized as NFL Most Valuable Player, when United Press International named him pro football's player of the year. 21st century At the start of the 2014 season, NFL surveys revealed that the league was approximately 68% African-American and about 28% white, with the remaining 4% comprising Asian/Pacific Islander, non- white Hispanics, and those preferring a Mixed Race category. By 2020, 70% of players in the NFL are black. These statistics are in contrast to the general population of the United States, which is about 28% non-white (white including Hispanic whites) although among the demographic that plays in the NFL (men approximately 21 to 35 years of age), the proportion of the American population that is non-white is somewhat greater. Scout.com national recruiting analyst Greg Biggins said: \\"I honestly think it‚Äôs harder for a white wide receiver than it is a black quarterback to get recruited at a high level in this day and age,\\" Biggins said. \\"Unless you have an extreme skill set that jumps out.\\" In recent decades the cornerback position has been played exclusively by black players, and the halfback/tailback position overwhelmingly so. There are currently no white cornerbacks in the NFL and there have not been since New York Giants cornerback Jason Sehorn played his final season for the team in 2002.Sheahin, Ed (December 18, 2009).

At the start of the 2013 season, 23 of the 32 starting quarterbacks (72%) in the NFL were white. Whites slightly outnumber blacks in the makeup of offensive linemen (49% vs 46%) yet the center position is 82% white.there aren‚Äôt more Black Quarterbacks in the NFL, Matt Ralston. Of the 32 starting kickers in the NFL in 2013, only one was black. Also, there were two African American punters, Reggie Hodges for the Cleveland Browns and Marquette King for the Denver Broncos. Outside of playing, the first black head coach in the NFL since the end of the player- coach era did not come until 1989, when Art Shell took over the then-Los Angeles Raiders; he was followed three years later by Dennis Green of the Minnesota Vikings. An affirmative action policy known as the Rooney Rule was implemented in 2003 requiring teams to interview racial minorities for head coaching positions and, since 2009, other senior management and player personnel positions. (Such minorities need not specifically be black; Hispanics of any race and persons of any nonwhite race are also eligible to qualify under the rule.) The league has never had a black franchise owner (it rejected the opportunity to do so twice, first with Rommie Loudd's Orlando Suns expansion bid, and then with Reggie Fowler's bid on the Minnesota Vikings), and only two of the league's owners (Korean-born Kim Pegula of the Buffalo Bills, and Pakistani-American Shahid Khan of the Jacksonville Jaguars) are of non-European descent.

Computer microprocessors generally run much faster than the computer's other subsystems, which hold the data the CPU reads and writes. Even memory, the fastest of these, cannot supply data as fast as the CPU could process it. In an example from 2011, typical PC processors like the Intel Core 2 and the AMD Athlon 64 X2 run with a clock of several GHz, which means that one clock cycle is less than 1 nanosecond (typically about 0.3 ns to 0.5 ns on modern desktop CPUs), while main memory has a latency of about 15‚Äì30 ns. Some second-level CPU caches run slower than the processor core. When the processor needs to access external memory, it starts placing the address of the requested information on the address bus. It then must wait for the answer, that may come back tens if not hundreds of cycles later. Each of the cycles spent waiting is called a wait state. Wait states are a pure waste of a processor's performance. Modern designs try to eliminate or hide them using a variety of techniques: CPU caches, instruction pipelines, instruction prefetch, branch prediction, simultaneous multithreading and others. No single technique is 100% successful, but together can significantly reduce the problem. Energy conservation Wait states can be used to reduce the energy consumption of a processor, by allowing the main processor clock to either slow down or temporarily pause during the wait state if the CPU has no other work to do. Rather than spinning uselessly in a tight loop waiting for data, sporadically reducing the clock speed in this manner helps to keep the processor core cool and to extend battery life in portable computing devices. Alternative meaning on IBM mainframes On IBM mainframes, the term wait state is used with a different meaning. A wait state refers to a CPU being halted, possibly due to some kind of serious error condition (such as an unrecoverable error during operating system to IPL). A wait state is indicated by bit 14 of the PSW being set to 1, with other bits of the PSW providing a wait state code giving a reason for the wait. In z/Architecture mode, the wait state code is found in bits 116-127.

A phenomenological definition of the NOE in nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) is the change in the integrated intensity (positive or negative) of one NMR resonance that occurs when another is saturated by irradiation with an RF field. The change in resonance intensity of a nucleus is a consequence of the nucleus being close in space to those directly affected by the RF perturbation. The NOE is particularly important in the assignment of NMR resonances, and the elucidation and confirmation of the structures or configurations of organic and biological molecules. The two-dimensional NOE experiment (NOESY) is an important tool to identify stereochemistry of proteins and other biomolecules in solution, whereas in solid form crystal x-ray diffraction must be used to identify the stereochemistry. History The NOE developed from the theoretical work of American physicist Albert Overhauser who in 1953 proposed that nuclear spin polarization could be enhanced by the microwave irradiation of the conduction electrons in certain metals. The electron-nuclear enhancement predicted by Overhauser was experimentally demonstrated in 7Li metal by T. R. Carver and C. P. Slichter also in 1953. A general theoretical basis and experimental observation of an Overhauser effect involving only nuclear spins in the HF molecule was published by Ionel Solomon in 1955. Another early experimental observation of the NOE was used by Kaiser in 1963 to show how the NOE may be used to determine the relative signs of scalar coupling constants, and to assign spectral lines in NMR spectra to transitions between energy levels. In this study, the resonance of one population of protons (1H) in an organic molecule was enhanced when a second distinct population of protons in the same organic molecule was saturated by RF irradiation. The application of the NOE was used by Anet and Bourn in 1965 to confirm the assignments of the NMR resonances for Œ≤,Œ≤-dimethylacrylic acid and dimethyl formamide showed that conformation and configuration information about organic molecules can be obtained. Bell and Saunders reported direct correlation between NOE enhancements and internuclear distances in 1970 while quantitative measurements of internuclear distances in molecules with three or more spins was reported by Schirmer et al. Richard R. Ernst was awarded the 1991 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for developing Fourier transform and two- dimensional NMR spectroscopy, which was soon adapted to the measurement of the NOE, particularly in large biological molecules. In 2002, Kurt Wuthrich won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for the development of nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy for determining the three-dimensional structure of biological macromolecules in solution, demonstrating how the 2D NOE method (NOESY) can be used to constrain the three-dimensional structures of large biological macromolecules.. Professor Anil Kumar was the first to apply the two- dimensional Nuclear Overhauser Effect (2D-NOE now known as NOESY) experiment to a biomolecule, which opened the field for the determination of three- dimensional structures of biomolecules in solution by NMR spectroscopy. Relaxation Nuclear spin energy level diagram for two spin nuclei. Steady- state pulse sequence for 1H NOE experiments The NOE and nuclear spin-lattice relaxation are closely related phenomena. For a single spin- nucleus in a magnetic field there are two energy levels that are often labeled Œ± and Œ≤, which correspond to the two possible spin quantum states, + and -, respectively. At thermal equilibrium, the population of the two energy levels is determined by the Boltzmann distribution with spin populations given by PŒ± and PŒ≤. If the spin populations are perturbed by an appropriate RF field at the transition energy frequency, the spin populations return to thermal equilibrium by a process called spin-lattice relaxation. The rate of transitions from Œ± to Œ≤ is proportional to the population of state Œ±, PŒ±, and is a first order process with rate constant W. The condition where the spin populations are equalized by continuous RF irradiation (PŒ± = PŒ≤) is called saturation and the resonance disappears since transition probabilities depend on the population difference between the energy levels. In the simplest case where the NOE is relevant, the resonances of two spin- nuclei, I and S, are chemically shifted but not J-coupled. The energy diagram for such a system has four energy levels that depend on the spin-states of I and S corresponding to Œ±Œ±, Œ±Œ≤, Œ≤Œ±, and Œ≤Œ≤, respectively. The W's are the probabilities per unit time that a transition will occur between the four energy levels, or in other terms the rate at which the corresponding spin flips occur. There are two single quantum transitions, W1I, corresponding to Œ±Œ± ‚ûû Œ±Œ≤ and Œ≤Œ± ‚ûû Œ≤Œ≤; W1S, corresponding to Œ±Œ± ‚ûû Œ≤Œ± and Œ≤Œ± ‚ûû Œ≤Œ≤; a zero quantum transition, W0, corresponding to Œ≤Œ± ‚ûû Œ±Œ≤, and a double quantum transition corresponding to Œ±Œ± ‚ûû Œ≤Œ≤. While rf irradiation can only induce single-quantum transitions (due to so-called quantum mechanical selection rules) giving rise to observable spectral lines, dipolar relaxation may take place through any of the pathways. The dipolar mechanism is the only common relaxation mechanism that can cause transitions in which more than one spin flips. Specifically, the dipolar relaxation mechanism gives rise to transitions between the Œ±Œ± and Œ≤Œ≤ states (W2) and between the Œ±Œ≤ and the Œ≤Œ± states (W0). Expressed in terms of their bulk NMR magnetizations, the experimentally observed steady-state NOE for nucleus I when the resonance of nucleus S is saturated (M_{S} = 0 ) is defined by the expression: ::: \\\\eta_{I}^{S} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{M_{I}^{S}-M_{0I}}{M_{0I}}\\\\right) where M_{0I} is the magnetization (resonance intensity) of nucleus I at thermal equilibrium. An analytical expression for the NOE can be obtained by considering all the relaxation pathways and applying the Solomon equations to obtain ::: \\\\eta_{I}^{S}=\\\\frac{M_{I}^{S}-M_{0I}}{M_{0I}} = \\\\frac{\\\\gamma_S }{\\\\gamma_I }\\\\frac{\\\\sigma_{IS}}{\\\\rho_{I}} = \\\\frac{\\\\gamma_S}{\\\\gamma_I}\\\\left(\\\\frac{W_{2}-W_{0}}{2W_{1}^{I}+W_{0}+W_{2}}\\\\right) where ::: \\\\rho_{I} = 2W_{1}^{I}+W_{0}+W_{2} and \\\\sigma_{IS} = W_{2} - W_{0}. \\\\rho_{I} is the total longitudinal dipolar relaxation rate (1/T_{1}) of spin I due to the presence of spin s, \\\\sigma_{IS} is referred to as the cross- relaxation rate, and \\\\gamma_{I} and \\\\gamma_{S} are the magnetogyric ratios characteristic of the I and S nuclei, respectively. Saturation of the degenerate W1S transitions disturbs the equilibrium populations so that PŒ±Œ± = PŒ±Œ≤ and PŒ≤Œ± = PŒ≤Œ≤. The system's relaxation pathways, however, remain active and act to re-establish an equilibrium, except that the W1S transitions are irrelevant because the population differences across these transitions are fixed by the RF irradiation while the population difference between the WI transitions does not change from their equilibrium values. This means that if only the single quantum transitions were active as relaxation pathways, saturating the S resonance would not affect the intensity of the I resonance. Therefore to observe an NOE on the resonance intensity of I, the contribution of W_{0} and W_{2} must be important. These pathways, known as cross- relaxation pathways, only make a significant contribution to the spin-lattice relaxation when the relaxation is dominated by dipole-dipole or scalar coupling interactions, but the scalar interaction is rarely important and is assumed to be negligible. In the homonuclear case where \\\\gamma_{I} = \\\\gamma_{S}, if W_{2} is the dominant relaxation pathway, then saturating S increases the intensity of the I resonance and the NOE is positive, whereas if W_0 is the dominant relaxation pathway, saturating S decreases the intensity of the I resonance and the NOE is negative. Molecular motion Whether the NOE is positive or negative depends sensitively on the degree of rotational molecular motion. The three dipolar relaxation pathways contribute to differing extents to the spin-lattice relaxation depending a number of factors. A key one is that the balance between œâ2, œâ1 and œâ0 depends crucially on molecular rotational correlation time, \\\\tau_{c}, the time it takes a molecule to rotate one radian. NMR theory shows that the transition probabilities are related to \\\\tau_{c} and the Larmor precession frequencies, \\\\omega, by the relations: :::W_{1}^{I} \\\\propto \\\\frac {3\\\\tau_c }{(1+\\\\omega_{I}^2\\\\tau_{c}^2)} \\\\frac {1}{r^{6}} :::W_{0} \\\\propto \\\\frac {2\\\\tau_c }{(1+(\\\\omega_{I}-\\\\omega_S)^2\\\\tau_{c}^2)} \\\\frac {1}{r^{6}} :::W_{2} \\\\propto \\\\frac {12\\\\tau_c }{(1+(\\\\omega_{I}+\\\\omega_S)^2\\\\tau_{c}^2)} \\\\frac {1}{r^{6}} where r is the distance separating two spin- nuclei. For relaxation to occur, the frequency of molecular tumbling must match the Larmor frequency of the nucleus. In mobile solvents, molecular tumbling motion is much faster than W_{0}. The so-called extreme-narrowing limit where \\\\omega\\\\tau_{c} \\\\ll 1 ). Under these conditions the double-quantum relaxation œâ2 is more effective than œâ1 or œâ0, because œÑc and 2œâ0 match better than œÑc and œâ1. When œâ2 is the dominant relaxation process, a positive NOE results. :::W_{1}^{I} \\\\propto \\\\gamma_{I}^{2}\\\\gamma_{S}^{2}\\\\frac {3\\\\tau_{c}}{r^{6} } :::W_{0} \\\\propto \\\\gamma_{I}^{2}\\\\gamma_{S}^{2}\\\\frac {2\\\\tau_{c}}{r^{6} } :::W_{2}\\\\propto \\\\gamma_{I}^{2}\\\\gamma_{S}^{2}\\\\frac {12\\\\tau_{c}}{r^{6} } ::: \\\\eta_{I}^{S}(max) = \\\\frac{\\\\gamma_S }{\\\\gamma_I }\\\\left[\\\\frac { \\\\frac {12\\\\tau_{c}}{r^{6}} - \\\\frac{2\\\\tau_{c}}{r^{6}} } { \\\\frac {2\\\\tau_{c}}{r^{6}} + 2\\\\frac{3\\\\tau_{c}}{r^{6}} + \\\\frac {2\\\\tau_{c}}{r^{6}} } \\\\right] =\\\\frac{\\\\gamma_S }{\\\\gamma_I }\\\\left[ \\\\frac {12-2 }{2+6+12 } \\\\right] = \\\\frac{\\\\gamma_S }{\\\\gamma_I }\\\\frac{1}{2} This expression shows that for the homonuclear case where I = S, most notably for 1H NMR, the maximum NOE that can be observed is 1\\\\2 irrespective of the proximity of the nuclei. In the heteronuclear case where I ‚â† S, the maximum NOE is given by 1\\\\2 (Œ≥S/Œ≥I), which, when observing heteronuclei under conditions of broadband proton decoupling, can produce major sensitivity improvements. The most important example in organic chemistry is observation of 13C while decoupling 1H, which also saturates the 1J resonances. The value of Œ≥S/Œ≥I is close to 4, which gives a maximum NOE enhancement of 200% yielding resonances 3 times as strong as they would be without NOE. In many cases, carbon atoms have an attached proton, which causes the relaxation to be dominated by dipolar relaxation and the NOE to be near maximum. For non-protonated carbon atoms the NOE enhancement is small while for carbons that relax by relaxation mechanisms by other than dipole- dipole interactions the NOE enhancement can be significantly reduced. This is one motivation for using deuteriated solvents (e.g. CDCl3) in 13C NMR. Since deuterium relaxes by the quadrupolar mechanism, there are no cross-relaxation pathways and NOE is non-existent. Another important case is 15N, an example where the value of its magnetogyric ratio is negative. Often 15N resonances are reduced or the NOE may actually null out the resonance when 1H nuclei are decoupled. It is usually advantageous to take such spectra with pulse techniques that involve polarization transfer from protons to the 15N to minimize the negative NOE. Structure elucidation First NOE's reported by Anet and Bourne While the relationship of the steady-state NOE to internuclear distance is complex, depending on relaxation rates and molecular motion, in many instances for small rapidly tumbling molecules in the extreme- narrowing limit, the semiquantitative nature of positive NOE's is useful for many structural applications often in combination with the measurement of J-coupling constants. For example, NOE enhancements can be used to confirm NMR resonance assignments, distinguish between structural isomers, identify aromatic ring substitution patterns and aliphatic substituent configurations, and determine conformational preferences. Nevertheless, the inter-atomic distances derived from the observed NOE can often help to confirm the three- dimensional structure of a molecule. In this application, the NOE differs from the application of J-coupling in that the NOE occurs through space, not through chemical bonds. Thus, atoms that are in close proximity to each other can give a NOE, whereas spin coupling is observed only when the atoms are connected by 2‚Äì3 chemical bonds. However, the relation Œ∑IS(max)= obscures how the NOE is related to internuclear distances because it applies only for the idealized case where the relaxation is 100% dominated by dipole-dipole interactions between two nuclei I and S. In practice, the value of œÅI contains contributions from other competing mechanisms, which serve only to reduce the influence of W0 and W2 by increasing W1. Sometimes, for example, relaxation due to electron-nuclear interactions with dissolved oxygen or paramagnetic metal ion impurities in the solvent can prohibit the observation of weak NOE enhancements. The observed NOE in the presence of other relaxation mechanisms is given by :::\\\\eta_{I} = \\\\frac {\\\\sigma_{IS}} {\\\\rho_{I}+\\\\rho^{*}} where œÅ‚ãá is the additional contribution to the total relaxation rate from relaxation mechanisms not involving cross relaxation. Using the same idealized two-spin model for dipolar relaxation in the extreme narrowing limit: :::\\\\rho_{I} \\\\propto \\\\frac {\\\\tau_{c}} {r^{6}} It is easy to show that :::\\\\eta_{I}^{S} \\\\propto \\\\left( \\\\frac {\\\\tau_{c}} {\\\\rho^{*}} \\\\right)\\\\frac {1}{r^{6}} Thus, the two-spin steady-state NOE depends on internuclear distance only when there is a contribution from external relaxation. Bell and Saunders showed that following strict assumptions œÅ‚ãá/œÑc is nearly constant for similar molecules in the extreme narrowing limit. Therefore taking ratio's of steady-state NOE values can give relative values for the internuclear distance r. While the steady-state experiment is useful in many cases, it can only provide information on relative internuclear distances. On the other hand, the initial rate at which the NOE grows is proportional to rIS‚àí6, which provides other more sophisticated alternatives for obtaining structural information via transient experiments such as 2D-NOESY. Two-dimensional NMR  Pulse sequence for the standard two-dimensional NOESY experiment 2D NOESY spectrum of codeineThe motivations for using two-dimensional NMR for measuring NOE's are similar as for other 2-D methods. The maximum resolution is improved by spreading the affected resonances over two dimensions, therefore more peaks are resolved, larger molecules can be observed and more NOE's can be observed in a single measurement. More importantly, when the molecular motion is in the intermediate or slow motional regimes when the NOE is either zero or negative, the steady-state NOE experiment fails to give results that can be related to internuclear distances. Codeine molecule Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy (NOESY) is a 2D NMR spectroscopic method used to identify nuclear spins undergoing cross-relaxation and to measure their cross-relaxation rates. Since 1H dipole-dipole couplings provide the primary means of cross-relaxation or organic molecules in solution, spins undergoing cross-relaxation are those close to one another in space. Therefore, the cross peaks of a NOESY spectrum indicate which protons are close to each other in space. In this respect, the NOESY experiment differs from the COSY experiment that relies on J-coupling to provide spin-spin correlation, and whose cross peaks indicate which 1H's are close to which other 1H's through the chemical bonds of the molecule. The basic NOESY sequence consists of three 90¬∞ pulses. The first pulse creates transverse spin magnetization. The spins precess during the evolution time t1, which is incremented during the course of the 2D experiment. The second pulse produces longitudinal magnetization equal to the transverse magnetization component orthogonal to the pulse direction. Thus, the idea is to produce an initial condition for the mixing period œÑm. During the NOE mixing time, magnetization transfer via cross-relaxation can take place. For the basic NOESY experiment, œÑm is kept constant throughout the 2D experiment, but chosen for the optimum cross-relaxation rate and build-up of the NOE. The third pulse creates transverse magnetization from the remaining longitudinal magnetization. Data acquisition begins immediately following the third pulse and the transverse magnetization is observed as a function of the pulse delay time t2. The NOESY spectrum is generated by a 2D Fourier transform with respect to t1 and t2. A series of experiments are carried out with increasing mixing times, and the increase in NOE enhancement is followed. The closest protons show the most rapid build-up rates of the NOE. Inter-proton distances can be determined from unambiguously assigned, well-resolved, high signal-to- noise NOESY spectra by analysis of cross peak intensities. These may be obtained by volume integration and can be converted into estimates of interproton distances. The distance between two atoms i and j can be calculated from the cross-peak volumes V and a scaling constant c ::: r_{\\\\text{NOE}} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{c}{V_{ij}}\\\\right)^{1/6} where c can be determined based on measurements of known fixed distances. The range of distances can be reported based on known distances and volumes in the spectrum, which gives a mean c and a standard deviation c_{SD}, a measurement of multiple regions in the NOESY spectrum showing no peaks, i.e. noise V_{\\\\rm err}, and a measurement error m_v. The parameter x is set so that all known distances are within the error bounds. This shows that the lower range of the NOESY volume can be shown ::: r_{\\\\text{NOE lower}} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{c-xc_{SD}}{\\\\frac{1}{m_v}V_{ij}+V_{\\\\rm err}}\\\\right)^{1/6} and that the upper bound is ::: r_{\\\\text{NOE higher}} = \\\\left(\\\\frac{c+xc_{SD}}{\\\\frac{1}{m_v}V_{ij}-V_{\\\\rm err}}\\\\right)^{1/6} Such fixed distances depend on the system studied. For example, locked nucleic acids have many atoms whose distance varies very little in the sugar, which allows estimation of the glycosidic torsion angles, which allowed NMR to benchmark LNA molecular dynamics predictions. RNAs, however, have sugars that are much more conformationally flexible, and require wider estimations of low and high bounds. In protein work, NOEs are used to create constraints on intramolecular distances. In this method, each proton pair is considered in isolation and NOESY cross peak intensities are compared with a reference cross peak from a proton pair of fixed distance, such as a geminal methylene proton pair or aromatic ring protons. This simple approach is reasonably insensitive to the effects of spin diffusion or non-uniform correlation times and can usually lead to definition of the global fold of the protein, provided a sufficiently large number of NOEs have been identified. NOESY cross peaks can be classified as strong, medium or weak and can be translated into upper distance restraints of around 2.5, 3.5 and 5.0 √Ö, respectively. Such constraints can then be used in molecular mechanics optimizations to provide a picture of the solution state conformation of the protein. Full structure determination relies on a variety of NMR experiments and optimization methods utilizing both chemical shift and NOESY constraints.  Experimental methods  Some examples of one and two-dimensional NMR experimental techniques exploiting the NOE include: * NOESY, Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy * HOESY, Heteronuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy * ROESY, Rotational Frame Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy * TRNOE, Transferred Nuclear Overhauser Effect * DPFGSE-NOE, Double Pulsed Field Gradient Spin Echo NOE experiment NOESY is the determination of the relative orientations of atoms in a molecule, for example a protein or other large biological molecule, producing a three-dimensional structure. HOESY is NOESY cross-correlation between atoms of different elements. ROESY involves spin-locking the magnetization to prevent it from going to zero, applied for molecules for which regular NOESY is not applicable. TRNOE measures the NOE between two different molecules interacting in the same solution, as in a ligand binding to a protein. In a DPFGSE-NOE experiment, a transient experiment that allows for suppression of strong signals and thus detection of very small NOEs.  Examples of nuclear Overhauser effect  Nuclear Overhauser effect The figure (top) displays how Nuclear Overhauser Effect Spectroscopy can elucidate the structure of a switchable compound. In this example, the proton designated as {H} shows two different sets of NOEs depending on the isomerization state (cis or trans) of the switchable azo groups. In the trans state proton {H} is far from the phenyl group showing blue coloured NOEs; while the cis state holds proton {H} in the vicinity of the phenyl group resulting in the emergence of new NOEs (show in red). Another example (bottom) where application where the NOE is useful to assign resonances and determine configuration is polysaccharides. For instance, complex glucans possess a multitude of overlapping signals, especially in a proton spectrum. Therefore, it is advantageous to utilize 2D NMR experiments including NOESY for the assignment of signals. See, for example, NOE of carbohydrates. Homonuclear NMR techniques in carbohydrate studies.

In Europe, chorizo is a fermented, cured, smoked sausage, which may be sliced and eaten without cooking, or added as an ingredient to add flavor to other dishes. Elsewhere, some sausages sold as chorizo may not be fermented and cured, and require cooking before eating. Spanish chorizo and Portuguese chouri√ßo get their distinctive smokiness and deep red color from dried, smoked, red peppers (piment√≥n/piment√£o). Chorizo is eaten sliced in a sandwich, grilled, fried, or simmered in liquid, including apple cider or other strong alcoholic beverages such as aguardiente. It is also used as a partial replacement for ground (minced) beef or pork. Names The word chorizo probably comes from the Late Latin salsƒ´cia 'salted', via the Portuguese souri√ßo; it is a doublet of the Spanish word salchicha 'sausage', which was transmitted through Italian salsiccia.\\"Etimolog√≠a de Chorizo\\", deChile.net s.v.Oxford English Dictionary, 1st edition, 1910, s.v. 'sausage' In English, chorizo is usually pronounced , though sometimes the Castilian Spanish [Œ∏] sound is used: . Pronunciation and spelling vary slightly among the Iberian languages: * Astur-Leonese: chorizu  , Varieties by region =Europe= Spain Spanish chorizo Spanish chorizo is made from coarsely chopped pork and pork fat, seasoned with garlic, piment√≥n ‚Äì a smoked paprika ‚Äì and salt. It is generally classed as either picante (spicy) or dulce (sweet), depending upon the type of piment√≥n used. Hundreds of regional varieties of Spanish chorizo, both smoked and unsmoked, may contain herbs, and other ingredients. For example, chorizo de Pamplona is a thicker sausage with the meat more finely ground. Among the varieties is chorizo Riojano from the La Rioja region, which has PGI protection within the EU. Chorizo is made in short or long and hard or soft varieties; leaner varieties are suited to being eaten at room temperature as an appetizer or tapas, whereas the fattier versions are generally used for cooking. A rule of thumb is that long, thin chorizos are sweet, and short chorizos are spicy, although this is not always the case. Spain produces many other pork specialties, as well, such as lomo embuchado or salchich√≥n, cured and air-dried in a similar way. Lomo is a lean, cured meat to slice, made from the loin of the pig, which is marinated and then air-dried. Salchich√≥n is another cured sausage without the piment√≥n seasoning of chorizo, but flavoured with black peppercorns, instead. Depending on the variety, chorizo can be eaten sliced without further cooking, sometimes sliced in a sandwich, or grilled, fried, or baked alongside other foodstuffs, and is also an ingredient in several dishes where it accompanies beans, such as fabada or cocido monta√±√©s. The version of these dishes con todos los sacramentos (with all the trimmings, literally sacraments) adds to chorizo other preserved meats such as tocino (cured bacon) and morcilla (blood sausage). Portugal A variety of Portuguese chouri√ßos Portuguese chouri√ßo or chouri√ßa, is made (at least) with pork, fat, wine, paprika, garlic, hot pepper and salt. It is then stuffed into natural or artificial casings and slowly dried over smoke. The many different varieties differ in color, shape, spices and taste. Many dishes of Portuguese and Brazilian cuisine make use of chouri√ßo, including cozido √† portuguesa and feijoada. A Portuguese charcutaria display A popular way to prepare chouri√ßo is slicing it part-way through and cooking it over an alcohol flame at the table (chouri√ßo √† bombeiro) in purpose-made glazed earthenware dishes with a lattice top. In Johannesburg, South Africa, the many Portuguese immigrants in the 1960s from Portugal and Mozambique tended to settle in a suburb called La Rochelle (Little Portugal).Abundant Portuguese Residents Elude The South African Census, The New York Times, May 29, 1981 Most of them either returned to Portugal or moved on to more affluent suburbs in the city, but restaurants in the area and the very well-supported annual \\"Lusitoland\\" fundraiser festival have chouri√ßo on the menu. In the heavily Portuguese counties in the US states of Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts, chouri√ßo is often served with little neck clams and white beans. Chouri√ßo sandwiches on grinder rolls, with saut√©ed green peppers and onions, are commonly available at local delis and convenience stores. Stuffed quahogs (also known as stuffies), a Rhode Island specialty, usually include chouri√ßo. In Portugal a blood sausage similar to black pudding is called chouri√ßa de sangue (blood chouri√ßo). Other types of chouri√ßo include chouri√ßa de vinho, chouri√ßo de cebola, chouri√ßo fumado, chouri√ßo de ossos, chouri√ß√£o and chouri√ßa de vinha d‚Äôalho. =Latin America= Mexico Mexican chorizo served over enchiladas as part of a breakfast in Tlaxiaco, Oaxaca Based on the uncooked Spanish chorizo fresco (fresh chorizo), the Mexican versions of chorizo are made not just from fatty pork, but also from beef, venison, chicken, turkey, and even tofu, kosher, and vegan versions are made. The meat is usually ground (minced) rather than chopped, and different seasonings are used. This type is better known in Mexico and other parts of the Americas, including the border areas of the United States, and is not frequently found in Europe. Due to culinary tradition and the high cost of imported Spanish smoked paprika, Mexican chorizo is usually made with native chili peppers of the same Capsicum annuum species, making it spicier than Spanish and Portuguese varieties of the sausage. Mexican longaniza are typically longer and spicier than chorizo. Spanish-American cuisine adds vinegar instead of the white wine usually used in Spain. Chorizo verde (green chorizo) is an emblematic food item of the Valle de Toluca, and is claimed to have originated in the town of Texcalyacac. Chorizo from Oaxaca The area around Toluca specializes in \\"green\\" chorizo, made with some combination of tomatillo, cilantro, chili peppers, and garlic. Most Mexican chorizo is a deep reddish color, and is largely available in two varieties, fresh and dried, though fresh is much more common. Some of the cheapest commercial chorizos use offal stuffed in inedible plastic casing to resemble sausage links, rather than muscle meat. Before consumption, the casing is usually cut open and the sausage is fried in a pan and mashed with a fork until it resembles finely minced ground beef. A common alternative recipe does not have casings. Pork and beef are cured overnight in vinegar and chili powder. Served for breakfast, lunch, or dinner, it has the finely minced texture mentioned above, and is quite intense in flavor. In Mexico, restaurants and food stands make tacos, queso fundido (or choriqueso), burritos, and tortas with cooked chorizo, and it is also a popular pizza topping. Chorizo con huevos is a popular breakfast dish in Mexico and areas of the United States with Mexican populations. It is made by mixing fried chorizo with scrambled eggs. Chorizo con huevos is often used in breakfast burritos, tacos, and taquitos. Another popular Mexican recipe is fried chorizo combined with pinto or black refried beans. This combination is often used in tortas as a spread, or as a side dish where plain refried beans would normally be served. In Mexico and the southwestern United States chorizo is also used to make chorizo con queso (or choriqueso), a popular appetizer consisting of small pieces of chorizo served with melted cheese and eaten with small corn tortillas or tortilla chips. In heavily Mexican parts of the United States, a popular filling for breakfast tacos is chorizo con papas, or diced potatoes saut√©ed until soft with chorizo mixed in. Central America and the Caribbean Salvadorean-style chorizo In Puerto Rico, Panama, and the Dominican Republic, chorizo and longaniza are considered two separate portions of meat. Puerto Rican chorizo is a smoked, well-seasoned sausage nearly identical to the smoked versions in Spain. Puerto Rican and Dominican longanizas have a very different taste and appearance. The seasoned meat is stuffed into a pork casing and is formed very long by hand. It is then hung to air-dry. Longaniza can then be fried in oil or cooked with rice or beans. It is eaten with many different dishes. Chorizo is a popular pizza topping in Puerto Rico. Salvadorean chorizo is short, fresh (not dried) and tied in twins. South America Argentinian chorizos in an asado In Ecuador, many types of sausage have been directly adopted from European or North American cuisine. All sorts of salami, either raw or smoked, are just known as salami. Most commonly known are sorts from Spanish chorizo, Italian pepperoni, and wiener sausages; wieners are the most popular. Some local specialities include morcilla, longaniza, and chorizo. Morcilla, as in most Spanish-speaking countries, is basically cooked pork blood encased in pork intestine casing (black pudding in English). Longaniza is a thin sausage containing almost any mixture of meat, fat, or even cartilage, smoked rather than fresh. Chorizo is a mixture of chopped pork meat, pork fat, salt, whole pepper grains, cinnamon, achiote, and other spices, which produce its characteristic deep red color. A traditional dish consists of fried egg, mashed potatoes, avocado, salad, and slices of fried chorizo. In Argentina, Uruguay, Bolivia, Peru, Colombia and Venezuela, chorizo is the name for any coarse meat sausage. Spanish-style chorizo is also available, and is distinguished by the name \\"chorizo espa√±ol\\" (Spanish chorizo). Argentine chorizos are normally made of pork, and are not spicy hot. Some Argentine chorizos include other types of meat, typically beef. In Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, Chile, and Peru, fresh chorizo, cooked and served in a bread roll, is called a chorip√°n. In Colombia, chorizo is usually accompanied by arepa. In Brazil, chouri√ßo is the word used for what in the rest of Latin America is morcilla; meat sausages similar to the chorizos of other Latin American countries are called lingui√ßa. Many varieties of Portuguese-style chouri√ßo and lingui√ßa are used in many different types of dishes, such as feijoada. In Bolivia, chorizos are made of pork, fried and served with salad (tomato, lettuce, onion, boiled carrots and quirqui√±a), mote, and a slice of bread soaked with chorizo fat. Chorizo sandwiches, without mote, are also eaten. =South and Southeast Asia= East Timor Chouri√ßos in East Timor Chouri√ßo is made in East Timor. It was introduced by the Portuguese, with their colonization of East Timor. Goa Goan sausages being sold at the Mapusa market, Goa, India. In Goa, India, which was ruled by the Portuguese for 450 years and has a large percentage of Goan Catholics, chouri√ßo is made from pork marinaded in a mixture of vinegar, red chilies, and spices such as garlic, ginger, cumin, turmeric, cloves, pepper, and cinnamon, which is stuffed into casings.Chourico de Goa recipe. https://www.celebrationinmykitchen.com/chouriccedilo-de-goa- goa-sausages These are enjoyed either with the local Goan Portuguese-style crusty bread, or pearl onions, or both. They are also used, cut into chunks, as the meat ingredient in rice pilaf. They can be raw (wet), smoked or cured through salting and air-drying. Three kinds of chouri√ßo are found in Goa: dry, wet, and skin. Dry chouri√ßo is aged in the sun for long periods (three months or more). Wet chouri√ßo has been aged for about a month or less. Skin chouri√ßo, also aged, is rare and difficult to find. It consists primarily of minced pork skin along with some of its subcutaneous fat. All three chouri√ßos are made in variations such as hot, medium, and mild. Other variations exist, depending on the size of the links, which range from 1 in (smallest) to 6 in. Typically, the wet varieties tend to be longer than the dry ones. Goan chorizo should be distinguished from \\"Goan frankfurters\\", which look similar to equivalents in the United States, but with a predominantly peppercorn flavor. Philippines Various types of Philippine longganisas (chorizos) in Quiapo, Manila Longaniza (; Visayan: chorizo, choriso, soriso) are Philippine chorizos flavored with indigenous spices, and may be made of chicken, beef, or even tuna. While the term longaniza refers to fresh sausages, it is also used in the Philippines to refer to cured sausages. Philippine longganisa are often dyed red with achuete seeds. There are dozens of variants from various regions in the Philippines. =North America=  United States  In comparison to Spanish chorizo, in the United States the term generally refers to a sausage that is never dried, has a fattier filling, and is very spicy. It is most popular near the Mexican border, especially in the Southwest near Chihuahua, Sonora, and Nuevo Leon. It is also found further north in places like Austin, Texas or Santa Fe, New Mexico, where its earliest evidence dates to well before the Wild West.It is most commonly eaten for breakfast on its own, or mixed with a local version of migas. =Louisiana= Creole and Cajun cuisine both feature a variant of chorizo called chaurice, which is frequently used in the Creole dish of red beans and rice.Meats and Sausages: Chaurice As with its cousin to the west, smoking this variant is an acceptable practice in local cuisine.

Occasionally a slight yellowish color of the skin or whites of the eyes may occur. Other possible symptoms include feeling tired, weakness, and abdominal pain. Gilbert's syndrome is due to a mutation in the UGT1A1 gene which results in decreased activity of the bilirubin uridine diphosphate glucuronosyltransferase enzyme. It is typically inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern and occasionally in an autosomal dominant pattern depending on the type of mutation. Episodes of jaundice may be triggered by stress such as exercise, menstruation, or not eating. Diagnosis is based on higher levels of unconjugated bilirubin in the blood without either signs of other liver problems or red blood cell breakdown. Typically no treatment is needed. If jaundice is significant phenobarbital may be used. Gilbert's syndrome affects about 5% of people in the United States. Males are more often diagnosed than females. It is often not noticed until late childhood to early adulthood. The condition was first described in 1901 by Augustin Nicolas Gilbert. Signs and symptoms =Jaundice= Gilbert's syndrome produces an elevated level of unconjugated bilirubin in the bloodstream, but normally has no serious consequences. Mild jaundice may appear under conditions of exertion, stress, fasting, and infections, but the condition is otherwise usually asymptomatic.Kasper et al., Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine, 16th edition, McGraw-Hill 2005Boon et al., Davidson's Principles & Practice of Medicine, 20th edition, Churchill Livingstone 2006 Severe cases are seen by yellowing of the skin tone and yellowing of the sclera in the eye. Gilbert's syndrome has been reported to contribute to an accelerated onset of neonatal jaundice. The syndrome cannot cause severe indirect hyperbilirubinemia in neonates by itself, but it may have a summative effect on rising bilirubin when combined with other factors, for example in the presence of increased red blood cell destruction due to diseases such as G6PD deficiency. This situation can be especially dangerous if not quickly treated, as the high bilirubin causes irreversible neurological disability in the form of kernicterus. =Detoxification of certain drugs= The enzymes that are defective in GS ‚Äì UDP glucuronosyltransferase 1 family, polypeptide A1 (UGT1A1) ‚Äì are also responsible for some of the liver's ability to detoxify certain drugs. For example, Gilbert's syndrome is associated with severe diarrhea and neutropenia in patients who are treated with irinotecan, which is metabolized by UGT1A1. While paracetamol (acetaminophen) is not metabolized by UGT1A1, it is metabolized by one of the other enzymes also deficient in some people with GS. A subset of people with GS may have an increased risk of paracetamol toxicity. =Cardiovascular effects= Several analyses have found a significantly decreased risk of coronary artery disease (CAD) in individuals with GS. Specifically, people with mildly elevated levels of bilirubin (1.1 mg/dl to 2.7 mg/dl) were at lower risk for CAD and at lower risk for future heart disease. These researchers went on to perform a meta-analysis of data available up to 2002, and confirmed the incidence of atherosclerotic disease (hardening of the arteries) in subjects with GS had a close and inverse relationship to the serum bilirubin. This beneficial effect was attributed to bilirubin IXŒ± which is recognized as a potent antioxidant, rather than confounding factors such as high-density lipoprotein levels. This association was also seen in long-term data from the Framingham Heart Study. Moderately elevated levels of bilirubin in people with GS and the (TA)7/(TA)7 genotype were associated with one-third the risk for both coronary heart disease and cardiovascular disease as compared to those with the (TA)6/(TA)6 genotype (i.e. a normal, nonmutated gene locus). Platelet counts and MPV are decreased in patients with Gilbert's syndrome. The elevated levels of bilirubin and decreasing levels of MPV and CRP in Gilbert's syndrome patients may have an effect on the slowing down of the atherosclerotic process. =Other= Symptoms, whether connected or not to GS, have been reported in a subset of those affected: feeling tired all the time (fatigue), difficulty maintaining concentration, unusual patterns of anxiety, loss of appetite, nausea, abdominal pain, loss of weight, itching (with no rash), and others,GilbertsSyndrome.com , such as humor change or depression. But scientific studies found no clear pattern of adverse symptoms related to the elevated levels of unconjugated bilirubin in adults. However, other substances glucuronidized by the affected enzymes in Gilbert's syndrome sufferers could theoretically, at their toxic levels, cause these symptoms. Consequently, debate exists about whether GS should be classified as a disease. However, Gilbert's syndrome has been linked to an increased risk of gallstones. Genetics Gilbert's syndrome is a phenotypic effect, mostly clearly associated with increased blood bilirubin levels, but also sometimes characterized by mild jaundice due to increased unconjugated bilirubin, that arises from several different genotypic variants of the gene for the enzyme responsible for changing bilirubin to the conjugated form. Gilbert's syndrome is characterized by a 70‚Äì80% reduction in the glucuronidation activity of the enzyme (UGT1A1). The UGT1A1 gene is located on human chromosome 2. More than 100 variants of the UGT1A1 gene are known, designated as UGT1A1*n (where n is the general chronological order of discovery), either of the gene itself or of its promoter region. UGT1A1 is associated with a TATA box promoter region; this region most commonly contains the genetic sequence A(TA)6TAA; this variant accounts for about 50% of alleles in many populations. However, several allelic polymorphic variants of this region occur, the most common of which results from adding another dinucleotide repeat TA to the promoter region, resulting in A(TA)7TAA, which is called UGT1A1*28; this common variant accounts for about 40% of alleles in some populations, but is seen less often, around 3% of alleles, in Southeast and East Asian people and Pacific Islanders. In most populations, Gilbert's syndrome is most commonly associated with homozygous A(TA)7TAA alleles. In 94% of GS cases, two other glucuronosyltransferase enzymes, UGT1A6 (rendered 50% inactive) and UGT1A7 (rendered 83% ineffective), are also affected. However, Gilbert's syndrome can arise without TATA box promoter polymorphic mutations; in some populations, particularly healthy Southeast and East Asians, Gilbert's syndrome is more often a consequence of heterozygote missense mutations (such as Gly71Arg also known as UGT1A1*6, Tyr486Asp also known as UGT1A1*7, Pro364Leu also known as UGT1A1*73) in the actual gene coding region, which may be associated with significantly higher bilirubin levels. Because of its effects on drug and bilirubin breakdown and because of its genetic inheritance, Gilbert's syndrome can be classed as a minor inborn error of metabolism. Diagnosis People with GS predominantly have elevated unconjugated bilirubin, while conjugated bilirubin is usually within the normal range and is less than 20% of the total. Levels of bilirubin in GS patients are reported to be from 20 ŒºM to 90 ŒºM (1.2 to 5.3 mg/dl) compared to the normal amount of < 20 ŒºM. GS patients have a ratio of unconjugated/conjugated (indirect/direct) bilirubin commensurately higher than those without GS. The level of total bilirubin is often further increased if the blood sample is taken after fasting for two days, and a fast can, therefore, be useful diagnostically. A further conceptual step that is rarely necessary or appropriate is to give a low dose of phenobarbital: the bilirubin will decrease substantially. Tests can also detect DNA mutations of UGT1A1 by polymerase chain reaction or DNA fragment sequencing. =Differential diagnosis= While Gilbert's syndrome is considered harmless, it is clinically important because it may give rise to a concern about a blood or liver condition, which could be more dangerous. However, these conditions have additional indicators: * Hemolysis can be excluded by a full blood count, haptoglobin, lactate dehydrogenase levels, and the absence of reticulocytosis (elevated reticulocytes in the blood would usually be observed in haemolytic anaemia). * Viral hepatitis can be excluded by negative blood samples for antigens specific to the different hepatitis viruses. * Cholestasis can be excluded by normal levels of bile acids in plasma, the absence of lactate dehydrogenase, low levels of conjugated bilirubin, and ultrasound scan of the bile ducts. * More severe types of glucuronyl transferase disorders such as Crigler‚ÄìNajjar syndrome (types I and II) are much more severe, with 0‚Äì10% UGT1A1 activity, with sufferers at risk of brain damage in infancy (type I) and teenage years (type II). * Dubin‚ÄìJohnson syndrome and Rotor syndrome are rarer autosomal recessive disorders characterized by an increase of conjugated bilirubin. * In GS, unless another disease of the liver is also present, the liver enzymes ALT/SGPT and AST/SGOT, as well as albumin, are within normal ranges. Treatment Typically no treatment is needed. If jaundice is significant phenobarbital may be used.  History  Gilbert's syndrome was first described by French gastroenterologist Augustin Nicolas Gilbert and co-workers in 1901. In German literature, it is commonly associated with Jens Einar Meulengracht. Alternative, less common names for this disorder include: * Familial benign unconjugated hyperbilirubinaemia * Constitutional liver dysfunction * Familial non-hemolytic non-obstructive jaundice * Icterus intermittens juvenilis * Low-grade chronic hyperbilirubinemia * Unconjugated benign bilirubinemia Notable cases * Napoleon I of France * Arthur Kornberg, Nobel laureate in Physiology or Medicine, 1959 * Nicky Wire, Manic Street Preachers bassist * Alexandr Dolgopolov (tennis player) * Jonas Folger, MotoGP rider References  External links  https://gilbertssyndrome.org.uk Gilbert's Syndrome BMJ Best Practices monograph Category:Accessory digestive gland disorders Category:Hepatology Category:Heme metabolism disorders Category:Genetic syndromes Category:Pediatrics Category:Wikipedia medicine articles ready to translate ","title":"Gilbert's syndrome"},{"id":"335630","text":"Laodice I (; flourished 3rd century BC, died before 236 BC) was a Greek noblewoman of Anatolia who was a close relative of the early Seleucid dynasty and was the first wife of the Seleucid Greek King Antiochus II Theos.Laodice I article at Livius.org Family Background Laodice was the daughter of Achaeus, a wealthy nobleman who owned estates in Anatolia.

Life and marriage Her birth date is unknown,Seleukid Genealogies and Biographies - Antiochos II and little is known on her early life. Laodice I married her paternal first cousin Antiochus II Theos before 266 BC as his first wife. She married Antiochus II before he was the heir to the Seleucid throne. When her paternal uncle Antiochus I Soter died in 261 BC, Antiochus II succeeded his father. Through her marriage, Laodice I became a Seleucid queen. Little is known on her relationship with Antiochus II. Laodice I bore her husband two sons: Seleucus II Callinicus and Antiochus Hierax, and three daughters: Apama, Stratonice of Cappadocia and Laodice.Biographical information on Antiochus II Theos Divorce with Antiochus II In 252 BC after the Second Syrian War, Antiochus II was obliged to make peace with the Egyptian Greek Pharaoh Ptolemy II Philadelphus. Antiochus made peace with the Pharaoh by divorcing Laodice and marrying the daughter of Ptolemy II, Berenice, with the understanding that any children born from their union would inherit the Seleucid throne.Bromiley, International Standard Bible Encyclopedia: A-D p.144 Although she was no longer queen, Laodice was still a very powerful and political influential figure. In their divorce settlement, Antiochus gave Laodice various land grants throughout Anatolia which are known through inscriptions.Billows, Kings and colonists: aspects of Macedonian imperialism p.126 Laodice I owned a large estate in the Hellespont,Grainger, A Seleukid prosopography and gazetteer p.47 other properties near Cyzicus, Ilion and in Caria. In a royal record at Sardis mentions her land titles were to be kept as royal land in disposal in grants or sales.Billows, Kings and colonists: aspects of Macedonian imperialism p.p.114-5 In a clause in the divorce settlement, Laodice was allowed to sell or donate land in which she had the right to choose which attachment of a city were to be passed on to the new landlord, unless Laodice had taken care of the matter herself.Aperghis, The Seleukid royal economy: the finances and financial administration of the Seleukid empire p.102 Antiochus gave her a grace period to settle matters on her land before she decided whether to hold on to the land or dispose it.Aperghis,The Seleukid royal economy: the finances and financial administration of the Seleukid empire p.103 She may have been given the revenue of two harvests with which to pay a nominal purchase price to set at the valuation of the land for tax purposes. When Laodice was able to make payment, the land she intended to purchase could remain part of royal land and couldn‚Äôt be made as a part of an attachment to a city. The only one who could order to reallocate or rearrange land lots was the King. When Laodice sold a land attachment, the new owner was not permitted to remove it from the city or attach it to another. As she was a former queen, as a part of a land sale she possessed everything on the land that was transferred to her during the sale. She collected revenue from annual agriculture harvests and other forms from her lands. Antiochus, on one occasion, granted Laodice a complete property tax exemption.Aperghis,The Seleukid royal economy: the finances and financial administration of the Seleukid empire p.144 Deaths of Antiochus II and his second family During Antiochus II‚Äôs marriage to Berenice, she bore him a son called Antiochus. Laodice I lived at Ephesus. On January 28 246 BC, Ptolemy II died, and was succeeded by Ptolemy III Euergetes. After the death of Ptolemy II, Antiochus II left his second family in Antioch and returned to Laodice. He named his first son with Laodice as his successor to the throne. In July 246 BC, Antiochus II died (some suggest that he was poisoned by a revengeful Laodice) leaving a confusing dynastic situation. Seleucus II succeeded his father as king and his brother Antiochus Hierax was named co-ruler in Sardis. They lived with Laodice at Ephesus. Laodice, either for revenge or to prevent civil war, had Berenice and her son murdered in the late summer of 246 BC. Out of his outrage, the brother of Berenice, Ptolemy III declared war and invaded the Seleucid Empire. His suspicions about the deaths of his sister and nephew were firmly grounded and were a part of the cause of the Third Syrian War also known as the ‚ÄòLaodicean War‚Äô or the ‚ÄòWar of Laodice‚Äô. Ptolemy captured Laodice and had her killed. This happened no earlier than 236 BC because there are two honorific inscriptions in Babylon dedicated to her dated to 247 BC and 237 BC. During the war, while Seleucus was fighting Ptolemy, Laodice supported the revolt of her second son against her first son. This occurred in 244 BC which caused a civil war for the next 17 years between Seleucus II and Antiochus Hierax.

Geography  Picture of Xiang River in Changsha, the Orange Island Bridge is on the left and Orange Isle (Juzizhou) is in front. The Upper Xiang River has two large Branches, the West (left) and East (right). The West Branch is traditionally known as the main stream, originating from the Haiyang Mountains in Guilin of Guangxi. In Hunan, there had been debate on whether or not this tradition of regarding the West Branch as the main stream is actually founded. According to the 2011 national Water Census of China,first national water census of China: chinadaily.com.cn (20-Dec-11) or chinadaily.com.cn (18-Mar-11) it is the East Branch, not the West, that should be regarded as the main stream of the Xiang. This is because it is both longer and contributes a greater volume of water than the western branch. The east branch retains the name of Xiao River, and it rises in Yegou Mountain (ÈáéÁãóÂ≤≠) of Xiangjiangyuan Township (ÊπòÊ±üÊ∫êÁë∂Êóè‰π°) in Lanshan County, Hunan. The two branches converge at Ping Island to form the Main Stem of the Xiang. The Main Stem is located in the eastern part of Hunan. The Xiang generally flows southwest to northeast from Lingling District of Yongzhou to Xiangyin County, and empties into the Yangtze River via Lake Dongting. =Upper Course= The Left Branch, also known as the West Branch of the upper course is traditionally known the upper Xiang River, the portion of the Xiang River upstream called Xiangshui River (ÊπòÊ∞¥).

People say the Xiang and the Li Rivers share the same origin, because the upper reaches of the two rivers are connected by the ancient Lingqu Canal, which is located in Xing'an County, Guangxi. According to a traditional saying, 70% of the water in Lingqu flows into the Xiang and 30% flows into the Li River.

She is the only surely attested wife of Ptolemy XII. Her only known child is Berenice IV, but she was also probably the mother of Cleopatra VII. Descent and marriage Because of the poor body of source material Cleopatra V is a very obscure member of the Ptolemaic dynasty. Only a few ascertained facts about her are known. Many aspects of her life are the subject of controversial theories.Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones: Cleopatra VI Tryphaina. In: Roger S. Bagnall et al.: The Encyclopedia of Ancient History. Wiley-Blackwell, Malden (MA) 2013, , vol. 3, p. 1568. In all known ancient sources she is given the byname Tryphaena. She may have borne this name before accession to the throne when she assumed the traditional royal name Cleopatra.Christopher Bennett: Cleopatra V., note 1. In some modern specialist literature Cleopatra Tryphaena, wife of Ptolemy XII, is referred to as Cleopatra VI.Dodson, Aidan and Hilton, Dyan. The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt. Thames & Hudson. 2004. The historian of classical antiquity Werner Hu√ü refers to her as Cleopatra VII Tryphaena.Werner Hu√ü, √Ñgypten in hellenistischer Zeit (Egypt in Hellenistic times). C. H. Beck, Munich 2001, , p. 674 and passim. The parentage of Cleopatra V is not recorded. She may have been a legitimate or illegitimate daughter of Ptolemy IXWerner Hu√ü, √Ñgypten in hellenistischer Zeit, p. 674-675 with note 16 (who considers it probable, that Cleopatra V was the full sister of Ptolemy XII). or the legitimate daughter of Ptolemy X. It is mentioned that in 88 BC, Ptolemy X Alexander fled Egypt with his wife Berenice III and his daughter. Cleopatra Tryphaena might be this unnamed daughter.Christopher Bennett: Cleopatra V., note 5. Cleopatra V is first mentioned in 79 BC in two papyri. One of these papyri dates from January 17, 79 BC.Friedrich Preisigke, Wilhelm Spiegelberg: Prinz Joachim-Ostraka. Nr. 1 (= Sammelbuch griechischer Urkunden aus √Ñgypten (SB). Bd. 3, Nr. 6027). In that year she married Ptolemy XII, king of Egypt. They received divine worship as theo√≠ Philop√°tores kai Phil√°delphoi (father-, brother- and sister-loving gods).Whitehorne, pp. 177‚Äì178; W. Hu√ü, p. 674-675 Cleopatra‚Äôs Egyptian titles, found primarily at Edfu and Philae, include Daughter of Re, Female Ruler, and Mistress of Two Lands.Lloyd Llewellyn-Jones: Cleopatra VI Tryphaina. In: Roger S. Bagnall et al.: The Encyclopedia of Ancient History, vol. 3, p. 1569. Death and identity It is unclear how long Cleopatra V lived, and with which mentions of Cleopatra Tryphaena in the historical record she should be identified, as the numbering used to distinguish the Ptolemies is a modern invention. Cleopatra Tryphaena V vanished around the time Cleopatra VII was born (69 BC): her name begins to disappear from monuments and papyri, and there is a papyrus of Ptolemy XII from 69 BC that does not mention her but would be expected to do so had she still been alive. She is lastly mentioned in a monument dated on August 8, 69 BC (Wilhelm Dittenberger In: Orientis Graeci inscriptiones selectae. (OGIS) I 185), but her name is already missing in a record dated on November 1, 69 BC (Christopher Bennett: Cleopatra V., note 11). There is some indication that Cleopatra may have died in 69 BC ‚Äî she may have died in childbirth or was possibly murdered. Should she really have died that early, then the Cleopatra Tryphaena who is mentioned ‚Äî after the expulsion of Ptolemy XII ‚Äî as co-ruler of Egypt (together with Berenice IV) in 58 and 57 BC, and died around 57 BC, must be her daughter, numbered by some historians as Cleopatra VI Tryphaena. This is also supported by Porphyry.Felix Jacoby, Fragmente der griechischen Historiker, no. 260 F 2, 14Whitehorne, p. 182 On the other hand, there is a dedication on the Temple of Edfu from December 5, 57 BC that inscribes Cleopatra Tryphaena's name alongside Ptolemy XII's (who however was not present in Egypt at that time), which would have meant the king's wife rather than daughter and would be unlikely had Ptolemy XII's wife really died already twelve years earlier. Thus some, though not all, modern historianse. g. W. Hu√ü, √Ñgypten in hellenistischer Zeit (Egypt in Hellenistic times). C. H. Beck, Munich 2001, p. 679 consider Cleopatra V to be identical with the purported Cleopatra VI Tryphaena, and have her living to c. 57 BC. This would comport with the account by Strabo,Geographica 17.1.11, p. 796 who reports Ptolemy XII to have had only three daughters; these can reliably be identified as Berenice IV, Cleopatra VII, and Arsinoe IV as the king's daughters, so that there would not be left any room for a Cleopatra VI. Werner Huss assumes, that quarrels erupted between Cleopatra V and Ptolemy XII in 69 BC and that as a result of these disputes Cleopatra V fell in disgrace and was compelled to resign.Werner Hu√ü, √Ñgypten in hellenistischer Zeit, p. 679. Cleopatra V was probably the mother of Cleopatra VII. Michael Grant comes to the conclusion that \\"on the whole\\" it seems most likely Cleopatra V was the mother of Cleopatra VII, noting that had Cleopatra VII been illegitimate, her \\"numerous Roman enemies would have revealed this to the world.\\" He continues we should rule out the hypothesis Cleopatra VII was conceived by Ptolemy XII's second wife-to-be while Cleopatra V was on the scene, and that if this unknown second wife would have been Cleopatra VII's mother and later made \\"queen legitimized\\", Cleopatra VII would still have been considered a bastard and \\"her Roman foes would not have missed the hint.\\" Duane W. Roller speculates that Cleopatra could have been the daughter of a theoretical half-Macedonian- Greek, half-Egyptian woman belonging to a family of priests dedicated to Ptah and was \\"only technically illegitimate\\" (however, he contends that whatever Cleopatra's ancestry, she valued her Greek Ptolemaic heritage the most), but notes if this unknown woman was not Cleopatra's mother, then Cleopatra V would be her mother. Part of his argument is based on Strabo's mention of Ptolemy XII's having only three daughters, Berenice being the only legitimate one. But as Grant notes that, of all the attacks on Cleopatra VII, her being illegitimate is not among them, and that it is only mentioned in a casual statement by Strabo. Most scholars agree that Berenice IV was a daughter of Cleopatra V. A different wife of Ptolemy XII may have been the mother of the younger siblings of Cleopatra VII, that is Arsinoe IV, Ptolemy XIII and Ptolemy XIV.This assumes e. g. Christoph Sch√§fer: Kleopatra. Wissenschaftliche Buchgesellschaft, Darmstadt 2006, , p. 18 However, Christopher Bennett thinks that Cleopatra V was the mother of all known children of Ptolemy XII.Christopher Bennett: Cleopatra V., note 17 and 18.

One Bah√° º√≠ scholar states that it can be regarded as the \\"most influential Quran commentary in Persian outside the Muslim world,\\" because of its international audience. It is sometimes referred to as the Book of Iqan or simply The Iqan.  Background  The work was composed partly in Persian and partly in Arabic by Bah√°'u'll√°h, the founder of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith, in 1861, when he was living as an exile in Baghdad, then a province of the Ottoman Empire. While Bah√°'u'll√°h had claimed to have received a revelation some ten years earlier in the S√≠y√°h-Ch√°l (lit. black-pit), a dungeon in Tehran, he had not yet openly declared his mission. References to his own station therefore appear only in veiled form. Christopher Buck, author of a major study of the √çq√°n, has referred to this theme of the book as its \\"messianic secret,\\" paralleling the same theme in the Gospel of Mark. The √çq√°n constitutes the major theological work of Bah√°'u'll√°h, and hence of the Bah√° º√≠ Faith. It is sometimes referred to as the completion of the Persian Bay√°n.

In 1861 he traveled to Karbala, Iraq, to visit his brother, ·∏§√°j√≠ M√≠rz√° ·∏§asan-'Al√≠, and then went to Baghdad to meet Bah√°'u'll√°h.

The Kit√°b-i-√çq√°n was probably the first work of Bah√°‚Äôu‚Äôll√°h that was published in print. A lithographed edition was published by relatives of the B√°b (the Afn√°ns) in Bombay, India, around 1299 AH (1882 CE) by the ·∏§asan√≠ Z√≠var Press.British Library. The Earliest Bah√° º√≠ Publication. It was first translated into English in 1904, one of the first works of Bah√°'u'll√°h to appear in English. Shoghi Effendi re-translated the work into English in 1931.  Contents  The book is in two parts: the first part deals with the foundational discourse that divine revelation is progressive and religions are related to one another, with each major monotheistic religion accepting the previous ones and, often in veiled terms, prophesying the advent of the next one. Since the questioner is a Muslim, Bah√°'u'll√°h uses verses from the Bible to show how a Christian could interpret his own sacred texts in allegorical terms to come to believe in the next dispensation. By extension the same method of interpretation can be used for a Muslim to see the validity of the claims of the B√°b. The second and larger part of the book is the substantive discourse and deals with specific proofs, both theological and logical, of the mission of the B√°b. One of the best-known and best-loved passages of this part is known as the \\"Tablet of the True Seeker.\\" Shoghi Effendi has offered the following lengthy description of the book's content: > Within a compass of two hundred pages it proclaims unequivocally the > existence and oneness of a personal God, unknowable, inaccessible, the > source of all Revelation, eternal, omniscient, omnipresent and almighty; > asserts the relativity of religious truth and the continuity of Divine > Revelation; affirms the unity of the Prophets, the universality of their > Message, the identity of their fundamental teachings, the sanctity of their > scriptures, and the twofold character of their stations; denounces the > blindness and perversity of the divines and doctors of every age; cites and > elucidates the allegorical passages of the New Testament, the abstruse > verses of the Quran, and the cryptic Muhammadan traditions which have bred > those age-long misunderstandings, doubts and animosities that have sundered > and kept apart the followers of the world's leading religious systems; > enumerates the essential prerequisites for the attainment by every true > seeker of the object of his quest; demonstrates the validity, the sublimity > and significance of the B√°b's Revelation; acclaims the heroism and > detachment of His disciples; foreshadows, and prophesies the world-wide > triumph of the Revelation promised to the people of the Bay√°n; upholds the > purity and innocence of the Virgin Mary; glorifies the Imams of the Faith of > Muhammad; celebrates the martyrdom, and lauds the spiritual sovereignty, of > the Imam Husayn; unfolds the meaning of such symbolic terms as \\"Return,\\" > \\"Resurrection,\\" \\"Seal of the Prophets\\" and \\"Day of Judgment\\"; adumbrates and > distinguishes between the three stages of Divine Revelation; and expatiates, > in glowing terms, upon the glories and wonders of the \\"City of God,\\" > renewed, at fixed intervals, by the dispensation of Providence, for the > guidance, the benefit and salvation of all mankind.

He wrote some high quality epic poetry, for example the first Slovene ballad and the first Slovene epic. After his death, he became the leading name of the Slovene literary canon.Bo≈æiƒç, Zoran (2011).Dejavniki literarne kanonizacije v srednje≈°olskih berilih ‚Äì na primeru Pre≈°erna (Factors of literary canonisation in high school reading materials ‚Äì the case of Pre≈°eren), Jezik in slovstvo, vol.56, 5‚Äì6, pp. 3‚Äì26 He tied together the motifs of his own unhappy love with that of an unhappy, subjugated homeland. Especially after World War II in the Slovene Lands, one of Pre≈°eren's motifs, the \\"hostile fortune\\", has been adopted by Slovenes as a national myth, and Pre≈°eren has been described being as ubiquitous as the air in Slovene culture. During his lifetime, Pre≈°eren lived in conflict with both the civil and religious establishment, as well as with the provincial bourgeoisie of Ljubljana. He fell victim to severe drinking problems and tried to take his life on at least two occasions, facing rejections and seeing most of his closest friends die tragically. His lyric poetry dealt with the love towards his homeland, the suffering humanity, as well as his unfulfilled love towards his muse, Julija Primic. Although he wrote in Slovene, some poems were also written in German. As he lived in Carniola, he at first regarded himself a Carniolan, but gradually took the broader Slovene identity. Life = Early life and education = Pre≈°eren's birthplace in Vrba France Pre≈°eren was born in the Upper Carniolan village of Vrba, then part of the Habsburg Monarchy (today in Slovenia), as the third of eight children and the first son in the family of a well-off farmer and an ambitious and better educated mother who taught her children to write and read and soon sent them to their uncles who were Roman Catholic priests. Already as a child, France showed considerable talent, and so his parents decided to provide him with a good education. At the age of eight, he was sent to elementary schools in Grosuplje and Ribnica, run by the local Roman Catholic clergy. In 1812, he moved to the Carniolan provincial capital of Ljubljana, where he attended the State Gymnasium. Already at a very young age, he learned Latin, Ancient Greek, and German, which was then the language of education, administration, and high culture in most areas inhabited by Slovenes. In Ljubljana, Pre≈°eren's talent was spotted by the poet Valentin Vodnik, who encouraged him to develop his literary skills in Slovene. As a high school student, he became friends with the future philologist Matija ƒåop, who would have an extremely important influence on the development of Pre≈°eren's poetry. In 1821, Pre≈°eren enrolled at the University of Vienna, where he studied law, against the wishes of his mother, who wanted him to become a priest. In Vienna, he became acquainted with the western canon from Homer to Goethe, but he was most fascinated by Dante and the Italian trecentists, especially Petrarch and Boccaccio. He also read contemporary Romantic poets, and he was even fired from a teaching post at Klinkowstr√∂m's Jesuit institute for having loaned a booklet of banned poetry to his friend Anastasius Gr√ºn. = Later life = Pre≈°eren's muse, Julija Primic, in a portrait by Matev≈æ Langus After acquiring a law degree in 1828, he returned to Ljubljana, where he was employed as an assistant in the firm of the lawyer Leopold Baumgartner. He constantly strove to become an independent lawyer, filing as many as six applications, but he was not successful. In 1832, he briefly moved to Klagenfurt in the hope of furthering his career, but returned to Ljubljana after less than a year. In the spring of 1833, he met Julija Primic, the daughter of a rich merchant, who would become the unfulfilled love of his life. In 1833, he became a member of the Ljubljana high society's social club, called the Casino Society (, ), and met Julija in 1834 and 1835 at the theatre and at the dances in Kazina, but did not have the courage to directly show her his feelings towards her. In 1834, he began working as an assistant to his friend Bla≈æ Crobath, who gave Pre≈°eren enough free time to engage in his literary activities. In the same year, he met the Czech romantic poet Karel Hynek M√°cha and the Slovene-born Croatian poet Stanko Vraz and had long and fruitful discussions on poetry with them. Around 1836, Pre≈°eren finally realized that his love for Julija would never become mutual (she had married another man the previous year). The same year, he met Ana Jelov≈°ek, with whom he entered into a permanent relationship. They had three children, but never married. Pre≈°eren supported Ana financially and treated her as his rightful mate, but engaged in several other love affairs at the same time. He also spent a lot of time travelling throughout Carniola, especially to Lake Bled, from the scenery of which he drew inspiration for his poems. In 1846, Pre≈°eren was finally allowed to open his own law firm and moved to Kranj with his family. He died there on 8 February 1849. Upon his deathbed he confessed that he had never forgotten Julija. In general, Pre≈°eren's life was an unhappy one. Work =Early years= Pre≈°eren's first serious poetic attempts date from his student years in Vienna. In 1824, he wrote some of his most popular poems, still under the influence of Valentin Vodnik and the rich tradition of Slovene folk poetry. In 1825, he completed a collection of \\"Carniolan poems,\\" which he showed to the philologist Jernej Kopitar. Kopitar was very critical of the young man's literary attempts, and so Pre≈°eren destroyed the entire collection. Kopitar's rejection hindered the development of Pre≈°eren's creativity; he did not publish anything more until 1827, when his satirical poem \\"To Maidens\\" (Dekletom) was published by the German language journal Illyrian Paper (). In 1828, Pre≈°eren wrote his first important poem, \\"A Farewell to Youth.\\" However, it was published only in 1830, in the literary almanac Krajnska ƒçbelica (The Carniolan Bee), established the same year by the librarian Miha Kastelic in Ljubljana. The journal published another well-known poem by Pre≈°eren that year, the first Slovene ballad. It was titled \\"The Water Man\\" () and was a narration about Ur≈°ka, a flirt from Ljubljana that ended in the hands of a handsome man who happened to be a water man. In 1830, his friend from high school, Matija ƒåop, returned to Ljubljana and re-established contacts with Pre≈°eren. ƒåop soon recognized his friend's poetic talent and persuaded him to adopt Romanic poetic forms. Following ƒåop's advice, Pre≈°eren would soon become a master of the sonnet. His poems were noticed by the Czech scholar Franti≈°ek ƒåelakovsk√Ω, who published several highly positive critiques of it. ƒåelakovsk√Ω's praise was extremely important for Pre≈°eren's self-esteem and gave him the strength to continue in the path on which ƒåop had orientated him. =The most productive years= Between 1830 and 1835, Pre≈°eren composed his esthetically most accomplished poems, which were inspired by the setbacks in his personal life, especially by his unrequited love for Julija Primic. Pre≈°eren followed ƒåop's advice and transformed Julija into a poetic figure, reminiscent of Dante's Beatrice and Petrarch's Laura. A Wreath of Sonnets A Wreath of Sonnets () is Pre≈°eren's most important poem from his early period. It is a crown of 15 sonnets. It was published on 22 February 1834 in the Illyrian Paper. In it, Pre≈°eren tied together the motifs of his own unhappy love with that of an unhappy, subjugated homeland. The poem was recognized as a masterpiece by Matija ƒåop, but it did not gain much recognition beyond the small circle around the journal Krajnska ƒçbelica. Moreover, Julija was unimpressed. Understandably, Pre≈°eren moved to more bitter verses. Sonnets of Misfortune O Vrba, the first of the Sonnets of Misfortune, published in 1834 in the 4th volume of Krajnska ƒçbelica Another important work from this period are the \\"Sonnets of Misfortune\\" (Sonetje nesreƒçe), which were first drafted already in 1832, but were published in the 4th volume of Krajnska ƒçbelica only in July 1834, with some changes. They are the most pessimistic of Pre≈°eren's works. This is a group of six (initially seven) sonnets expressing the poet's despair over life. In the first sonnet, titled \\"O Vrba,\\" Pre≈°eren reflects on what his life could have been like, had he never left his home village. The other sonnets from the circle have not gained such a widespread popularity, but are still considered by scholars to be among Pre≈°eren's most genuine and profound works. =After ƒåop's death= 1835 was Pre≈°eren's annus horibilis. His closest friend Matija ƒåop drowned while swimming in the Sava River, Julija Primic married a wealthy merchant, and Pre≈°eren became alienated from his friend and editor of the literary journal Krajnska ƒçbelica, Miha Kastelic. Following his best friend's death, Pre≈°eren wrote the epic-lyric poem The Baptism on the Savica (), dedicating it to ƒåop. Set during the forced Christianisation of the predecessors of Slovenes, the Carantanians, in the late 8th century, the poem addresses the issues of collective identity and faithfulness to the ancestors' ways, as well as the issue of individual and his hope and resignation. The philosopher Slavoj ≈Ωi≈æek interpreted the poem as an example of the emergence of modern subjectivity. In 1837, Pre≈°eren met Emil Korytko, a Polish political activist from Galicia, confined by the Austrian authorities to Ljubljana. Korytko introduced to Pre≈°eren the work of Adam Mickiewicz, which had an important influence on his later works. The two even jointly translated one of Mickiewicz's poems (\\"Resygnacja\\") from Polish to Slovene and started collecting Slovene folk songs in Carniola and Lower Styria. In 1839, Korytko died, leaving Pre≈°eren without an important interlocutor after ƒåop's death. In the autumn of the same year, Andrej Smole, one of Pre≈°eren's friends from his youth, returned home after many years of living and travelling abroad. Smole was a relatively rich young intellectual from a well-established merchant family, who supported the development of Slovene culture. The two spent much of the winter of 1839‚Äì1840 on Smole's estate in Lower Carniola, where they planned several cultural and literary projects, including the establishment of a daily newspaper in the Slovene language and the publishing of Anton Toma≈æ Linhart's comedy Matiƒçek's Wedding which had been prohibited as \\"politically inappropriate\\" in 1790, due to the outbreak of the French Revolution. Both projects failed: the planned journal Ilirske novice was blocked by the Viennese censorship, and Linhart's play would be staged only in 1848, without Pre≈°eren's assistance. Smole died suddenly in 1840, literally in Pre≈°eren's arms, while celebrating his 40th birthday. Pre≈°eren dedicated a touching, yet unexpectedly cheerful and vitalist poem to his late friend. =The later years= The original manuscript for Zdravljica, written in the old Slovene alphabet After 1840, Pre≈°eren was left without any interlocutor who could appreciate his works, but continued to write poetry, although much less than in the 1830s. He gradually departed from the typical romantic trend, adopting an increasingly diverse and innovative style. In 1843, an important breakthrough for Pre≈°eren happened: Janez Bleiweis started publishing a new daily journal in the Slovene language and invited Pre≈°eren to participate in its cultural section. The two men came from rather different backgrounds: Bleiweis was a moderate conservative and staunch supporter of the ecclesiastical and imperial establishments and alien to the Romantic culture. He nevertheless established a fair relationship with the poet. Pre≈°eren's participation in Bleiweis' editorial project was the closest he would come to public recognition during his lifetime. In 1844, he wrote the patriotic poem \\"Zdravljica\\" (A Toast), the most important achievement of his late period. In 1847, a volume of his collected poems was published under the simple title Poezije dr. Franceta Pre≈°erna (Poems of Dr. France Pre≈°eren). Pre≈°eren spent the last two years of his life occupied with private life and his new job as a lawyer in Kranj. According to some accounts, he was planning several literary projects, including a novel in the realistic style and an experimental play, but he was struck with liver disease caused by his excessive drinking in prior years. The revolution of 1848 left him rather indifferent, although it was carried out by the young generation who already saw him as an idol of democratic and national ideals. Before his death, he did however redact his Zdravljica, which was left out from the 1847 volume of poems, and made some minor adjustments for a new edition of his collected poems. Reception and influence Today, Pre≈°eren is still considered one of the leading poets of Slovene literature, acclaimed not only nationally or regionally, but also according to the standards of developed European literature. Pre≈°eren was one of the greatest European Romanticists. His fervent, heartfelt lyrics, intensely emotional but never merely sentimental, have made him the chief representative of the Romantic school in Slovenia. Nevertheless, recognition came slowly after his death. It was not before 1866 that a real breakthrough in the reception of his role in Slovene culture took place. In that year, Josip Jurƒçiƒç and Josip Stritar published a new edition of Pre≈°eren's collection of poems. In the preface, Stritar published an essay which is still considered one of the most influential essays in Slovene history. In it, he showed the aesthetic value of Pre≈°eren's work by placing him in the wider European context. From then on, his reputation as the greatest poet in the Slovene language was never endangered. Legacy A memorial with ‚Äú≈Ωive naj vsi narodi‚Äù the first line of the Slovene national anthem by France Pre≈°eren near the Schuman roundabout, Brussels. Pre≈°eren's legacy in Slovene culture is enormous. He is generally regarded as the national poet. In 1905, his monument was placed at the central square in Ljubljana, now called Pre≈°eren Square. By the early 1920s, all his surviving work had been catalogued and numerous critical editions of his works had been published. Several scholars were already dealing exclusively with the analysis of his work and little was left unknown about his life. In 1945, the anniversary of his death, called Pre≈°eren Day, was declared as the Slovene cultural holiday. In 1989, his Zdravljica was declared the national anthem of Slovenia, replacing the old Naprej, zastava slave. In 1992, his effigy was portrayed on the Slovene 1000 tolar banknote, and since 2007, his image is on the Slovene two-euro coin. The highest Slovene prize for artistic achievements, the Pre≈°eren Award, is named after him.

According to Gregory of Tours, during the time of the Emperors Decius Pope Fabian sent out seven bishops from Rome to Gaul to preach the Gospel: Gatien to Tours, Trophimus to Arles, Paul to Narbonne, Saturnin to Toulouse, Denis to Paris, Austromoine to Clermont, and Martial to Limoges. He succeeded in converting the inhabitants to Christianity, and his memory has always been venerated there.Clugnet, L√©on. \\"St. Martial.\\" The Catholic Encyclopedia Vol. 9. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1910. 10 January 2016 Abbey Sarcophagus of St Martial in the crypt below the Place de la R√©publique, Limoges Martial died in Limoges and was buried outside the Roman town. As his tomb became progressively more important as a pilgrimage site, the monks found patronage in the Benedictine order in the 9th century. The site became the Benedictine Abbey of Saint- Martial, a great library (second only to the library at Cluny) and scriptorium. The 12th-century chronicler Geoffroy du Breuil of Vigeois worked in its library.Charles de Lasteyrie, L'Abbaye de Saint-Martial de Limoges (Paris) 1901. The abbaye de Saint-Martial, one of the great pilgrimage churches of western Christianity, was so thoroughly razed in the 19th century, that only the scattered manuscripts of its library remain. Some of said manuscripts had been bought for Louis XV and have come to the Biblioth√®que Nationale de France. The original crypt was exhumed in 1966‚Äì1970. Twelve Romanesque carved capitals were discovered built into the foundations of a barn and purchased in 1994 for the Museum of the Bishopric of Limoges. Hagiography Saint Martial cures the son of Arnulfus. The Miracula Martialis, an account of 7th-, 8th- and 9th-century miracles, was written shortly after 854. The influx of pilgrims to the abbey where the historical Martial lay buried encouraged the creation of an elaborate hagiography during the 10th century. As the hagiography grew, Martial was moved back in time: now, sent into Gaul by Saint Peter himself, he is said to have evangelized not only the Province of Limoges but all of Aquitaine. He performed many miracles, among others the raising of a dead man to life, by touching him with a rod that Saint Peter had given him. The mythology culminated in the 11th century forgeries of Ademar of Chabannes, The Life of St. Martial, attributed to Bishop Aurelian, his successor, which was designed to 'prove' that Martial had been baptized by Peter, was one of the seventy-two disciples and present at the Last Supper. In the 13th century compendium of lore, the Golden Legend, the legendary Martial appears with many miracles, casting out fiends and raising the dead and conducting mass baptisms.\\"Saint Martial\\", Treasures of Heaven In the midst of a revival of his cult in the 14th century, 73 miracles were recorded between 1378 and 1388 in the Miracula sancti Martialis anno 1388 patrata. As late as 1854, Mons. Buissas, Bishop of Limoges, petitioned Pope Pius IX to bestow on Martial the honors of a disciple of Christ, but was turned down. The full discovery of Ademar's tissue of forged documents, including an imaginary church council and a papal letter, was not revealed until the 1920s, and continued for several generations to be resisted in conservative Catholic circles. Saint Martial also became associated with Saint Valerie of Limoges, a legendary martyr of the 3rd or 4th centuries, who is said to have carried her head to him after decapitation. Veneration His help was invoked during an epidemic of widespread ergot poisoning in Limoges in 994.\\"Saint Martial\\", Cath√©drale Saint Etienns, Limoges Martial was particularly honored in Bordeaux, where his pastoral staff was kept in the Basilica Saint-Seurin and used in processions to invoke his aid during outbreaks of pestilence.\\"Saint Martial de Limoges\\", Nominis He is also venerated in Italy, where Colle di Val d'Elsa Cathedral is dedicated to him.

It shares borders with Bosnia-Herzegovina, Bulgaria, Croatia, Hungary, North Macedonia, Montenegro, Romania and Albania through the disputed territory of Kosovo. Serbia is landlocked, though it is able to access the Adriatic Sea through Montenegro and inland Europe and the Black Sea via the Danube. Area and borders Serbia covers a total area of , which places it 111th in the world. Arable land covers (%), and forests cover (%) of the territory of Serbia.Republic Statistical Office of Serbia, Annual book, Chapter 13-Agriculture Republiƒçki zavod za statistiku Srbije , Prikaz stanja ≈°uma po povr≈°ini Serbia's total border length amounts to : with Bosnia and Herzegovina , with Bulgaria , with Croatia , with Hungary , with North Macedonia , with Montenegro and with Romania ).CIA World Factbook:Serbia ;Extreme points: * North: 46¬∞11'N (near Hajdukovo) * South: 41¬∞86' N (near Rastelica) * East: 23¬∞01'E (Senokos near Dimitrovgrad) * West: 18¬∞51'E (near Bezdan in Vojvodina) Physical geography =Topography= Serbia's terrain ranges from fertile plains of northern Vojvodina to limestone ranges and basins in the east and ancient mountains and hills in the southeast. The north is dominated by the Danube River. The Morava River, a tributary of the Danube, flows through the more mountainous southern regions of Serbia. Topographic map of Serbia The terrain of central Serbia consists chiefly of hills and low to medium-high mountains, interspersed with numerous rivers and creeks. The main communication and development line stretches southeast of Belgrade towards Ni≈° and Skopje (in North Macedonia), along the valley formed by the Great and South Morava rivers. Most major cities, as well as the main railroad and highway, are located on or around this line. To the east of this line, in an area that is relatively sparsely populated, the terrain rises to the limestone ranges of Stara Planina and the Serbian Carpathians. To the west, mountains slowly rise towards the southwest, but do not form real ridges. Zlatibor and Kopaonik are the highest mountains of this area. Mountains cover the largest parts of the country. Four mountain systems meet in Serbia: the Dinaric Alps in the west cover the greatest territory, stretching from northwest to southeast. The Carpathian and Balkan Mountains stretch in a north-south direction in eastern Serbia, east of the Morava valley. Ancient mountains along the South Morava, the highest one being Besna Kobila, belong to the Rila-Rhodope mountain system. The most significant mountains in Serbia are: * Kopaonik * Stara Planina * Mokra Gora * Besna Kobila * Dukat * Golija * Suva Planina * Gramada * Tara * Zlatibor The highest peak in Serbia is Velika Rudoka in the ≈†ar Mountains () if Kosovo is counted. Otherwise, Serbia's highest point is Mid≈æor. =Hydrology= Practically the entire territory (92%) of Serbia belongs to the Danube (Black Sea) drainage basin. Part of Kosovo (5%) belongs to the Adriatic drainage basin, chiefly via the White Drin river. The rest (3%) in Kosovo and southern Serbia belongs to Aegean basin, chiefly via the Vardar river. Hydrographic map of Serbia The Danube flows 588 km through Serbia or as a border river (with Croatia in the northwest and Romania in the southeast). Other chief rivers in Serbia are tributaries of the Danube including the Sava (flowing from the west), Tisa (flowing from the north), Drina (flowing from the south, forming a natural border with Bosnia and Herzegovina), and Morava. Only the Morava flows nearly entirely through Serbia. Their tributaries form a dense network of smaller rivers and creeks that cover most of the country. Due to its terrain, natural lakes in Serbia are sparse and small and most are located in Vojvodina, such as the glacial lake Paliƒá and numerous oxbow lakes along rivers. There are, however, numerous artificial lakes, mostly due to the construction of hydroelectric dams, the biggest being ƒêerdap on the Danube, Peruƒáac on the Drina, and Vlasina Lake. The abundance of relatively unpolluted surface water and numerous underground water sources of high quality might present opportunities for exportation and economic improvement. Extensive exploitation and production of bottled water has begun only recently. Despite the country's access to these water resources, water supply to many Serbian cities is poor due to mismanagement and a lack of adequate investment in infrastructure. This is complicated by water pollution (e.g., pollution in the Ibar River from Trepƒça zinc-lead compounds affecting Kraljevo and the presence of natural arsenic in underground waters in Zrenjanin). The theoretical hydroenergetic potential in Serbia is estimated to be around 17,000 GWh. Roughly 10,000 GWh or 60% of Serbia's hydroenergetic potential is generated by large power plants. The remainder could be generated in small and medium power plants (<25 MW), whose construction by the private sector may improve Serbia's economy and energy reliability. Serbia also has a huge geothermal potential, but it is only partially and sporadically accessed. Geothermal water is primarily used for balneological purposes: there are around 60 spas in Serbia, which are seen as an opportunity to improve tourism in the country.Utilization of Geothermal Hydrology in Serbia\\", M. Milivojeviƒá and M. Martinoviƒá, International Geothermal Conference, Reykjavik 2003. =Climate= Climate of Serbia is moderate continental with a diversity on local level, caused by geographic location, relief, terrain exposition, presence of river and lake systems, vegetation, urbanization etc. Proximity of the mountain ranges of Alps, Carpathians, Rhodopes, as well as Adriatic Sea and Pannonian plain affect the climate.
