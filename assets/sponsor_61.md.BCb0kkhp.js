Cellach's byname is derived from the land of Cualu which lay around Glendalough. The name U√≠ M√°il may mean \\"grandsons of the princes\\". This, along with their ownership of certain objects symbolic of the kingship of Leinster, has suggested that they may once have been considered the rightful rulers of Leinster, at least by themselves. Alternatively, U√≠ M√°il may have derived their name from the Glen of Imaal, in the west of modern County Wicklow, which lay in the centre of their historic lands. Cellach's father was not king of Leinster, but his second cousin Fiannamail mac M√°ele Tuile (died 680) was. Cellach succeeded his cousin as king of U√≠ M√°il when Fiannamail was murdered by a servant named Fochsech√°n, probably on the orders of F√≠nsnechta Fledach.Annals of Tigernach AT 680.3 The kingship of Leinster passed to the U√≠ D√∫nlainge in the person of Bran Mut mac Conaill who died in 693, to be followed as king by Cellach.

The Battle of Claenath, fought near Clane in modern County Kildare, was a victory for Cellach, with Bodbchath killed and Fogartach fled.Annals of Ulster AU 704.4 In 707 the U√≠ N√©ill High King of Ireland Congal Cennmagair campaigned in Leinster and obtained Cellach's submission to his authority.Annals of Ulster AU 707.7 In 709, aided by British allies--usually presumed to be mercenaries, exiled members of the warbands of the British kingdoms conquered by expansionist Northumbria--he fought a battle at Serg where his sons Fiachra and Fiannamail were killed. Serg is unidentified, Whitley Stokes translates it as \\"the battle of the Hunt\\". The Annals of Tigernach locate it somewhere in the fortuatha of Leinster, that part of the province east of the Wicklow Mountains.Annals of Tigernach AT 709.2 His adversaries are not named. Cellach's death in 715 is reported without comment by the Irish annals. Family His first wife was Mugain ingen Failbe of U√≠ Bairrche. Their daughter Conchenn (died 743) married Murchad mac Brain Mut (died 727), his successor as king of Leinster. Mugain was also the mother of his sons Fiachra and Fianamail slain in 709. Cellach's wife B√© F√°il, the third of four, was the daughter of Sechnassach, the High King of Ireland. Several of his sons died in his lifetime. His daughters married well. Muirenn (died 748) was the mother of High King Cin√°ed mac √çrgalaig and perhaps of Cin√°ed's successor Flaithbertach mac Loingsig by a second marriage.

She is known for her work on the relationships between scientific discovery and social and political phenomena. Early life and education Nye was born December 5, 1944, to Joe Allen and Mildred Mann of Nashville, Tennessee. She began her undergraduate studies as a chemistry major at Vanderbilt University, but became interested in history of science after taking a class from Robert Siegfried. In 1964 she left Vanderbilt to attend the University of Wisconsin in Madison, Wisconsin, where she completed her BA in Chemistry in 1965. She married Robert A. Nye, also a historian, on February 17, 1968. They traveled to France to do doctoral research in 1968: their trip coincided with revolutionary unrest and offered them opportunities to learn French cooking. Mary Jo Nye completed a Ph.D. in History of Science at the University of Wisconsin in 1970, advised by Erwin N. Hiebert, whom Nye credits for his egalitarian support of women students. At the time, students studying the 19th and 20th century were also a minority in the field. Nye's generation of scholars is credited with creating a shift that embraces international perspectives and examines the interactions of politics and science. Career Nye was awarded a National Science Foundation post-doc in the history of science in 1969. In 1970 she began teaching part-time at the University of Oklahoma, later moving to a tenure-track position. She was appointed Assistant Professor in 1975, Associate Professor in 1978, served as Acting Chair of the History of Science department in 1981, and became a Full Professor in 1985. In 1991 she was named George Lynn Cross Research Professor in the History of Science. She and her husband, also a faculty member, shared responsibility for caring for their daughter and frequently traveled to France for research. Their interests later broadened to include England and Germany, as Nye studied the British physicist and Nobel laureate P.M.S. Blackett. In 1993, Nye was appointed chair of the History of Science Department at the University of Oklahoma. Mary Jo Nye was active in the History of Science Society (HSS), serving as vice-president in 1987 and succeeding Bill Coleman as president from 1988-1989 when he became ill. She has also served as Second Vice-President of the Division of History of Science in the International Union of History and Philosophy of Science. She has held a number of visiting research appointments at institutions including the University of Pittsburgh, Rutgers University, the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, Churchill College at the University of Cambridge, the Max Planck Institute for the History of Science in Berlin, and Harvard University. In 1994, Nye and her husband were co-appointed as Thomas Hart and Mary Jones Horning Professors of the Humanities and Professors of History at Oregon State University. AT OSU she became interested in Linus Pauling, whose papers are held by the university, and whose career covers much of the 20th century.

Biography Wu was born in Zhoushan, Zhejiang Province. His art is Conceptual in nature, often dealing with issues surrounding language.Holland Cotter, New York Times online His work includes painting, drawing, installation, photography and performance.AsianNouveau.com Wu Shanzhuan graduated from the Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts in Hangzhou (now the China Academy of Art) in 1986. He moved to Europe in the late 1980s, and obtained a master's degree from the College of Fine Arts at the University of Fine Arts of Hamburg (Hochschule f√ºr Bildende K√ºnste, 1989). He lived in Germany and Iceland for over ten years, and returned to China in 2005. As one of the leaders of the Chinese Conceptual Movement in the 1980s, Wu Shanzhuan was the first Chinese artist to assimilate textual pop references into his work. Wu's pivotal installation, Red Humour International (1986), laid the foundation for his \\"highly idiosyncratic and sophisticated approach to painting, which forgoes image in favour of political jingoism, religious scripture, and advertising slogans\\". Known for his experimental works with language and the use of big character posters, Wu is a kind of precursor to the better known works of Gu Wenda and Xu Bing. Wu was part of the red humor group, who toyed with language and meaning. His works are filled with satire, language tricks, symbols and radical games. He has posed nude in his art works for a while with his wife, Inga Svala Thorsdottir. Inga was born in 1966 in Iceland, and graduated from the Painting Department of the Icelandic School of Arts and Crafts in 1991. In 1995, she graduated from the Hochschule f√ºr bildende K√ºnste in Hamburg. She founded Thor's Daughter's Pulverization Service in 1993, and BORG in 1999. \\"His work is filled with absurd imagery and fantastical language.\\" The Chinese Character and the Cultural Revolution The Cultural Revolution caught public attention when the first Marxist-Leninist ‚Äòbig character‚Äô poster was put up at Peking University in 1966. These ‚Äòbig character‚Äô posters started appearing all over campus in the next few days. Although they were a common medium in the political battle of Mao Zedong‚Äôs time, they reached their peak during the Cultural Revolution. Campaigns were declared on these posters, along with criticisms of factions, and the denunciation of individuals. When this ‚Äòmass voice‚Äô became fully supported by Mao, a new visual landscape was created, with slogans, directives, criticisms and moral aphorisms flooding all surfaces. A key visual aspect of the Cultural Revolution was Mao's portrait and the image of a worker/peasant/soldier. Mao accomplished mass coverage, and the Chinese text was used to carry the literary meaning to the people. The artistic value of calligraphy can sometimes overpower its content though, like in cursive styled texts or of the fragments of a masterpiece. As the writer Wu Hung suggests, ‚Äúall traditional calligraphers conducted this transformation in one way or another, but none of them tried to completely divorce form from content. A radical departure from this ancient tradition only occurred in contemporary Chinese art‚Äù. This change of the meaning of text occurred after the Cultural Revolution. During the Cultural Revolution, identified as a ‚Äúgreat revolution that touches people to their very souls‚Äù, writing was used to deliver visual violence as well as political messages. The language is the most deeply rooted element of the Chinese culture, and the revolution infringed on this for sure success. With the visual power of the Chinese character, it was inevitable that the avant- garde artists would revisit the potential of the written word in the late 1980s. As Wu Shanzhuan said, ‚ÄúThe Chinese character is the most significant element, in terms of its ability to shape people‚Äôs thinking or to influence the national psychology‚Äù. School Some of the other graduates of the Zhejiang Academy of Fine Art, who began to play a leading role in China in the mid-1980s, were Wang Guangyi, Shang Peili, Geng Jianyi, Huang Yongping, and Gu Wenda. Although they probably didn't learn too much from the teachers directly, due to the domination of a realist style in academies, they learned from young teachers and classmates outside of the classroom. Imported Euro- American books also inspired these artists in the early 1980s. The director of the academy bought all the publications from the ‚ÄúExhibition of International Art Publications‚Äù, which opened in the National History Museum in Beijing in 1982, and these resources, published in various languages, greatly stimulated the ‚Äô85 Movement generation. Another influential force came from the open educational environment adopted by the school. In 1985, students became allowed to create a single work in any freely chosen style, although they had to follow their instructor‚Äôs favored subject and technique. Though quite controversial, this resulted in experimental works that expressed many different individual conceptions and styles. Under this new policy, the students were also able to choose different conceptual and technical approaches that allowed the creation of multipart series. A sensation was caused in the Chinese art world when the experimental works of the class of 1985 were displayed at the graduation exhibition. These artists, born in the generation of the 1960s, who were trained after the Cultural Revolution, adopted the new avant-garde orientation. Similar happenings were taking place in other academies in China, such as in Sichuan, Beijing, and Guangzhou. Works from various academies were brought together in May 1985 in the exhibition ‚ÄúYoung Art of Progressive China‚Äù, held in the National Art Museum of China. Neorealism and Western surrealism were shown in the most remarkable of the works. Guannian Art Two types of low-key avant-garde existed during the early 1990s: apartment art and maximalism. They involved a retreat from the public sphere, differing from political pop and cynical realism. Tracking back to the 1970s and 1980s, they only came to be known in the 1990s through neo- Chinese guannian (idea) art. ‚ÄúThe neo-guannian art of Chinese avant-garde artists had been forced to abandon the avant-garde myth, the innocence, and even the naivet√© that had been adopted by the ‚Äô85 Movement‚Äù. ‚ÄòRevolution in art‚Äô was no longer their interest. Instead, change in the relationships between themselves and their environment became the focus. Wu Shanzhuan, and other guannian artists, like Xu Bing, fixated on the revolution in ideas itself to elaborate on their concept of an anti-art project. The works of these artists were expected to be understood by viewers, and to be objects of byproducts. 1980s art can be partially comprehended as part of a project of dematerializing art-making. There is no Western historical relationship that goes along with this movement due to the integral nature of calligraphic history, along with the vital allegorical, metaphorical, and poetic combination of words and images in the history of Chinese art. Wu Shanzhuan, along with other Chinese artists such as Xu Bing and Gu Wenda, hold ideas where images and words are undertaken into one holistic concept. The anti-art development, therefore, is a response to the outside forces of the social and artistic environment. The project was initiated by Huang Yongping, and further developed by Wu Shanzhuan, Gu Wenda, Xu Bing, and others. All of these artists also embraced the traditional philosophy of Chad Buddhism, ‚Äúwhich encourages an ironic sensibility and a refusal to privilege any one doctrine over another in the search for truth‚Äù. Apartment art had moved on to a different approach on materialization, and that of communicated relations between artists and things, in which the subject matter was more valued than the concept/idea. Subjects being taken from daily life, the discovery of new ideas was secondary to the work being engaged. Artists were able to make art in a strictly controlled environment because originality to them didn't come from thinking, but from touching the materials. This kind of art was concentrated on the observable and palpable. The physical context of an object, its location and relocation, was also important to them. Red Humor installations There are four parts to Wu's Red Humor installations in Zhejiang: Red Characters: Big- Character Posters, Red Seals, Windy Red Flags, and Big Business. He often used ready-made objects in his art. 70% Red, 25% Black, and 5% White serves as a preface for the Red Humor group. Cultural Revolution slogans mix freely with advertising pitches, and ancient poems on the walls of the installation Red Humor. On the floor are four large characters saying, ‚ÄúNobody knows what it means.‚Äù He created a \\"Big Business\\" performance that involved selling shrimp; he brought 300 kilograms of fresh shrimp from a fishing village in Zoushan, Zhejing province. After writing the price of the shrimp on a blackboard, he began selling them. Liu Kaiqu, one of the most influential sculptors in China, was the first buyer. This work demonstrated Wu's idea that modern art in society is just a big business. He explained his performance after the authorities shut him down saying, \\"The National Art Museum is not only a place to display artwork, but it also can be a black market. For the Chinese New Year, I have brought first-quality shrimp suitable for export from my home village in celebration of the holiday and to enrich people's spiritual and material life in our capital. The unit price: 9.5 yuan. Place of display: National Art Museum. Urgent for buying.\\" Selected exhibitions 2003 A Strange Heaven: Contemporary Chinese Photography, Galerie Rudolfinum, Prague, Czech Republic 2002 Made By Chinese, Galerie Enrico Navarra, Paris Chicago Art Fair, Chicago 2001 Today No Water, Ethan Cohen Fine Arts, New York 2000 Conceptualist Art: Points of Origin 1950s-1980s, Walker Art Center 1999 Thing‚Äôs Right(s), Cuxhavener Kunstverein, Germany 1998 Inside Out ‚Äì New Chinese Art, New York, P.S 1 Contemporary Art Center, New York Vege-Pleasure, Ingolfsstraeti 8 Gallery, The Reykjavik Art Festival 1998, Iceland 1996 Please Don‚Äôt Move, Bahnw√§rterhaus, Gallery der Stadt, Esslingen 1995 Xineses, Centre d‚ÄôArt Santa M√≤nica, Barcelona 1994 Maos Ungez√§hmte Kinder, R√∂mer Museum Hildesheim References External links *Ursula Panhans-Buhler on Wu Shanzhuan from CCC-HS.net *Images, biography and texts from the Saatchi Gallery *Wu Shanzhuan on ArtFacts.net *Further information from Hanart TZ Gallery *Wu Shanzhuan on ArtNet.com *Wu Shanzhuan Archive Asia Art Archive Category:Artists from Zhejiang Category:Chinese photographers Category:Living people Category:1960 births Category:People from Zhoushan ","title":"Wu Shanzhuan"},{"id":"13989289","text":"Page from a 14th-century MS that Gaisford used for his 1848 edition.

It is the largest Byzantine lexicon and draws on many earlier grammatical, lexical and rhetorical works. Its main sources were two previous etymologica, the so-called Etymologicum Genuinum and the Etymologicum Gudianum.

The editio princeps of the Etymologicum Magnum was published by Zacharias Kallierges and Nikolaos Vlastos under the patronage of Anna Notaras at Venice in 1499. The typeface was designed and cut by Kallierges, modeled on his own handwriting. The decorative initial letters and headpieces are patterned on the decorations of the Byzantine manuscript tradition, and the woodcut borders incorporate elaborate arabesque designs, usually colored white on red, but also white on gold.

He undertook his genpuku ceremony under Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Iemitsu on May 3, 1630, and was given the adult name of the \\"Mitsuyoshi\\", which included the same kanji \\"Mitsu\\" as the Sh≈çgun. As a further sign of favor, his official wife, Chiyohime later Reisen-in, was also the daughter of sh≈çgun Tokugawa Iemitsu. His childhood name was Gor≈çta (‰∫îÈÉéÂ§™). On the death of his father on June 28, 1650, he became the 2rd Tokugawa daimy≈ç of Owari Domain, with lower 3rd court rank and the courtesy title of Captain of the Right Imperial Guards. He completed the clan mortuary temple of Kenchu- ji the following year, and was raised to upper 3rd court rank and Ch≈´nagon on August 12, 1653. On November 1, 1671, he formally changed his name to \\"Mitsutomo\\". On May 4, 1690, he received the courtesy title of Dainagon, and a week later was awarded 2nd Court Rank. On April 25, 1693, he officially retired, turning his offices and position as clan heed to his son, Tokugawa Tsunanari; however, although officially retired, he continued to wield all political power using his son's name, until his son's death on July 1, 1699. During this period, he lived at the ≈åzone Shimoyashiki, a palatial palace with extensive gardens some distance from Nagoya Castle. In addition to his official wife (a daughter of Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Iemitsu), Mitsutomo had at least 10 official concubines, by whom he had 17 children (11 male, 6 female). Noted for his accomplishments in the Japanese tea ceremony and Japanese calligraphy, Mitsutomo was especially noted as a master of the Shinkage-ry≈´ style of Japanese swordsmanship, having been taught by the Owari Yagy≈´ clan. He proved so adept that he was named the 6th s≈çke by Yagy≈´ Toshikane, and added a number of teaching concepts to the ry≈´. His grave is at the Owari Tokugawa clan temple of Kench≈´-ji in Nagoya.

Biography Tokugawa Yoshimichi was the 10th son of the 3rd daimy≈ç of Owari Domain, Tokugawa Tsunanari by a concubine, H≈çju-in, who was believed to have been a commoner. His childhood name was Matsudaira Yabutaro (ÊùæÂπ≥Ëó™Â§™ÈÉé) later become Yoshito (ÂêâÈÉé) and changed again to Gorota (‰∫îÈÉéÂ§™). On August 25, 1695, he was permitted to take the Tokugawa surname in place of Matsudaira, and in December of the same year was awarded with one kanji from Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Tsunayoshi's name, lower 4th court rank and ceremonial court title of Captain of the Left Guards. On the death of his father in 1699, Yoshimichi officially became the 4th Tokugawa daimy≈ç of Owari Domain with 3rd Court Rank, but since he was only age 11 at the time, his uncle Matsudaira Yoshiyuki served as regent, and he continued to reside at the Yotsuya residence of his mother in Edo until 1705. During this period, he studied Japanese martial arts, Confucianism, and Shinto, and later was considered to be a scholarly and wise ruler of Owari Province. He was awarded the title of Ch≈´nagon on November 28, 1704. He was also ranked as the 8th master of the Yagy≈´ Shinkage-ry≈´ school of Japanese swordsmanship. In addition to his official wife (a daughter of court noble Kuj≈ç Tsukezane) by whom he had a son, Yoshimichi had also had two concubines, by whom he had two daughters. Yoshimichi died on July 26, 1713, under somewhat uncertain circumstances. It is known that he was held in high regard by Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ienobu, who approached Yoshimichi in 1712 with regards to his possible succession to the Tokugawa shogunate ‚Äì a post for which he declared to have no desire or ambition. Plans for Yochimichi to either succeed Ienonu, or to act as regent for Ienobu's infant son were vehemently opposed by Ienobu's councilor, Arai Hakuseki. However, in May 1713, a plot by some of his retainers in Nagoya resulted in twelve sentences of death or seppuku, and Yoshimichi went into permanently secluded retirement back with his mother, H≈çju-in, on July 21 of the same year. He died, reportedly of illness, less than five days later. His grave is at the Owari Tokugawa clan temple of Kench≈´-ji in Nagoya.

This trope uses the phonetic reading of a grouping of kanji (Chinese characters) to suggest several interpretations: first on the literal level (e.g. Êùæ, matsu, meaning \\"pine tree\\"), then on subsidiary homophonic levels (e.g. ÂæÖ„Å§, matsu, meaning \\"to wait\\"). Thus it is that many waka have pine trees waiting around for something. The presentation of multiple meanings inherent in a single word allows the poet a fuller range of artistic expression with an economical syllable-count. Such brevity is highly valued in Japanese aesthetics, where maximal meaning and reference are sought in a minimal number of syllables. Kakekotoba are generally written in the Japanese phonetic syllabary, hiragana, so that the ambiguous senses of the word are more immediately apparent. History Pivot words are first found in the earliest extant manuscripts where poetic verse is preserved in written form. The earliest examples are from the Nara period. The provenance of the technique is unclear, however it is likely it was already in common use in the period before writing was introduced, as part of the oracular poetic tradition. It is a technique devised to enrich the way of conveying a poem in a limited space. The general pattern is as follows: #Using the context of the sentence before the kakekotoba and after it to create a new meaning. #The kakekotoba is translated to two different meanings by itself. Because it can be translated with different meanings, kakekotoba translations can sometimes be meaningless by themselves, and need a context to bring out their meaning, which was not considered a problem in the Heian period. Examples ;Kokin Wakash≈´ 571 Love 2 This poem from the Kokin Wakash≈´ makes a pun that is translated explicitly in the English version. Kara, herecan mean \\"empty shell\\" or \\"corpse\\" (since the implied narrator's soul has left his body). Spelling this out in translation is the only way to express the pun to an English reader, but doing so destroys the subtlety that makes the original so poignant Shirane, Haruo. Traditional Japanese Literature. page 161, Columbia University, New York, 2007 ;Kokin Wakash≈´ 639 (From a poetry contest/utaawase) Although the mix-up of tears and rain is a bit trite in Japanese poetry, Toshiyuki creates a new beauty from old fragments through the unusual verb \\"kokitarete\\" (drenched) and the kakekotoba on \\"furisohochi\\" (meaning both \\"to fall\\" and \\"to soak through\\"). The kakekotoba is just one way through which poets are able to make unique and beautiful works of art despite working with a rather limited set of acceptable forms, styles, and references Shirane, Haruo. Traditional Japanese Literature. page 163, Columbia University, New York, 2007 ;Chikuba Kyoginshu 227-228 Miscellaneous Though from a much later period (15th century), this poem utilizes a multi-layered play on the literary term utamakura (\\"poem- pillow\\"). An utamakura is a place-name that is described with set words and associated constantly with the same scenery, season, time of day, etc...; poets often kept notes of their favorite tropes of this sort. Two of the Six Poetic Immortals of the Kokin Wakash≈´ era were the Priest Henjou and Ono no Komachi, who were reputed to be romantically involved despite their competition. The literary term utamakura is here being used for one of its literal constitutive words, \\"pillow,\\" to imply that Henjou and Komachi were sleeping together. The poem is also referencing similar scenes in the Gosenshu and Yamato Monogatari. Kakekotoba, as this poem shows, are often humorous displays of the writer's wit.Shirane, Haruo. Traditional Japanese Literature. page 1157, Columbia University, New York, 2007 In English a similar technique is sometimes employed in both poetic and prose language. One contemporary example is: \\"They say conversation rule the nation, I can tell, but I could never right my wrongs unless I write them down for real.\\" -Kendrick Lamar (Poetic Justice) This example only works when the line is heard, not read (because the spelling of the two words are distinct): \\"right a wrong\\" and \\"write a wrong.\\" Conversely, this line would have to be rendered explicitly if it was translated into another language where the two words are not homophones. Another contemporary example: \\"...they like 'go Forres[t], run Forres[t], run Forres[t], go Forres[t]', yeah I mean you already wrote for us... what's one more quote for us?\\" -Drake (0 to 100) In this example, the pivot word is based on the vernacular pronunciation of the words \\"Forrest\\" and \\"for us\\" where Forrest (alluding to the name Forrest Gump) is pronounced with the final /t/ dropped and the /r/ in both words / phrases elides so that the preceding vowel is elongated, thus \\"forrest\\" > foos and \\"for us\\" > foos with only slight differentiation in stress, which is basically neutralized in the song. This example is highly complex in that it would require five phrases to be rendered twice each; e.g. \\"go Forrest\\" and \\"go for us\\" etc., and the final line, which reveals the play on words, \\"what's one more quote for us?\\" and \\"what's one more quote Forrest?\\" It is important to note that both these and the majority of Japanese kakekotoba are highly dependent on vocal recitation, not writing.  Notation  The term can also be written as (Êá∏Ë©û), but the (ÊéõË©û) form is more common.  See also  * paronomasia * garden path sentence References External links * Zhivkova, Stella.

Biography Tokugawa Tsugutomo was the 11th son of the 3rd daimy≈ç of Owari Domain, Tokugawa Tsunanari by a concubine, who was a commoner, his childhood name was Hachisaburo (ÂÖ´‰∏âÈÉé). He became 6th Tokugawa daimy≈ç of Owari Domain on the unexpected death of his brother Tokugawa Yoshimichi, and Yoshimichi's son Tokugawa Gor≈çta in 1713. He was severely reprimanded by the domain's senior retainer, Takenokoshi Masatake, for having thrown a celebratory party immediately on his succession, ignoring the customary mourning period. Tsugutomo was awarded lower 4th Court Rank and the ceremonial position of Captain of the Left Guards on January 11, 1713, and was promoted to 3rd Court Rank and was given a kanji from the name of Sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ietsugu. He advanced to the ceremonial post of Ch≈´nagon on December 26, 1715. Whereas his predecessor, Yoshimichi, had enjoyed the high regard of the 6th sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ienobu, Tsugutomo was viewed with suspicion by senior shogunal retainers Manabe Akifusa and Arai Hakuseki, as Tsugutomo had the closest claim by direct descent to the position of sh≈çgun, and the 7th sh≈çgun Tokugawa Ietsugu had no heirs. Tsugutomo's position was also bolstered by the fact that his official wife was the daughter of the kampaku Konoe Iehiro, with ties to the powerful faction led by Tenei-in within the ≈åoku of Edo Castle. Despite his blood ties and political connections, Tsugutomo was bypassed by the shogunal succession, and Tokugawa Yoshimune from Kii Domain was selected to become 8th sh≈çgun instead. Tsugutomo was noted for his fiscal acuity from an early age, and reformed the finances of Owari Domain. He also supported Yoshimune's Ky≈çh≈ç Reforms, which left the domain with a very considerable fiscal surplus. The castle town of Nagoya prospered under his administration, increasing in population, and attracting merchants such as Echigoya from Edo. Tsugutomo died on January 5, 1731, without an heir (his only son, by a concubine, having died in infancy). The leadership of the domain passed to his younger half-brother, the 19th son of Tokugawa Tsunanari, Tokugawa Muneharu. Tsugutomo's grave is at the Owari Tokugawa clan temple of Kench≈´-ji in Nagoya.

MV Golden Nori was refueled after being released Military confrontation After receiving a distress call, , an American , arrived at the scene and attacked and sank two skiffs being towed by the tanker. The tanker's owner and operator, Dorval Kaiun Shipping, reported that its cargo consisted of four kinds of chemicals, including highly flammable benzene. The United States Fifth Fleet spokesperson, Lydia Roberts, stated, \\"we were aware of what was on the ship when we fired\\". As the hijacked tanker continued underway, Porters sister ship received authorization from Somali authorities to pursue it. This is the first incident of Somali piracy where the United States Navy was given permission for pursuit within Somali territorial waters. The Navy continued to shadow the vessel through October and November, 2007. One of the crewmembers escaped from the ship and made it to safety, angering the pirates and complicating the situation even further. In November negotiations started for the tanker's release, but by 4 December Golden Nori had been cornered in the port of Bosasso by two American and one German ship. Coalition forces called on the pirates to surrender, threatening them with military force if the standoff continued. The pirates in return demanded one million dollars in ransom or else they would kill all 21 members of the crew. On 12 December, the pirates left the vessel for the coast and set the crew free. It is still unclear if the pirates received their demanded ransom, or left simply because of the pressure applied by the coalition. Similar incident USS James E. Williams Another hijacking in the same region occurred late on 29 October when gunmen attacked the North Korean freighter Dai Hong Dan. A helicopter from , responding to a telephoned report of a hijacking, flew over the freighter on 30 October and radioed a demand for the attackers to surrender. The freighter's crew subsequently overwhelmed the gunmen, killing one and detaining the rest. With the permission of the freighter's crew, US Navy forces boarded the freighter to treat the wounded, which included three crewmen and three pirates. This hijacking may not have been the work of indiscriminate area pirates; the hijackers are believed to be security guards hired by the freighter's shipping agent. Aftermath After the release of Golden Nori, the US Navy started pressuring pirates on other vessels to release their captives and flee. Not too long after the release of Golden Nori all other vessels were released, some after US warships threatened to use force to remove the pirates on them. Some of the pirates fled without taking any ransoms, but it appears that others were indeed given ransom payments before leaving the ships they had taken. American ships escorted the freed vessels out of Somali waters and provided assistance to the crews of those vessels. All vessels were freed and no vessel was captured by pirates for a matter of months after the release of Golden Nori, allowing for a short period of peace along the coast.

Biography Tokugawa Tsunanari was the son of the second daimy≈ç of Owari Domain, Tokugawa Mitsutomo by his official wife, Chiyohime later Reisen-in, the daughter of sh≈çgun Tokugawa Iemitsu. Although Mitsutomo's second son, he was given the position of first son and heir over his elder brother, who had been born to a concubine. He undertook his genpuku ceremony under Shogun Tokugawa Ietsuna on April 5, 1657, and was given the adult name of the \\"Tsunayoshi\\". He changed his name to \\"Tsunanari\\" to avoid confusion with an uncle of the same name who was daimy≈ç of Tatebayashi Domain. His childhood name was Gorota (‰∫îÈÉéÂ§™). On the retirement of his father on April 27, 1693, Tsunanari became the 3rd Tokugawa daimy≈ç of Owari Domain, with 3rd court rank and the courtesy title of Ch≈´nagon. Although officially daimy≈ç, all power remained in the hands of his retired father and Tsunanari spent most of his time in various scholarly pursuits, including starting work on a comprehensive history of Owari Province in 1698. In addition to his official wife (a daughter of court noble Hirohata Tadayki), Tsunanari had 16 concubines, by whom he had a total of 40 children (22 male, 18 female). Tsunanari died on July 1, 1699, by eating a tainted strawberry, and was succeeded by his 10th son, Tokugawa Yoshimichi. He was posthumously awarded 2nd Court Rank and the courtesy title of Dainagon. His grave is at the Owari Tokugawa clan temple of Kench≈´-ji in Nagoya.

The group was formed in Sardinia in 1988 by Andrea Parodi, Gigi Camedda and Gino Marielli. The group's music is characterized by the influence from traditional Sardinian music; the lyrics of most of its songs are in Sardinian language (especially in its Logudorese dialectal variety) rather than Italian. The name of the band was taken from Second Foundation, a novel of the Foundation series by Isaac Asimov. In the novel the planet \\"Tazenda\\" (the name of which comes from the English expression \\"Star's End\\") plays an important role. The choice, according to Tazenda, of this name was because of an assonance with their own language.

The diocese comprises the Department of Haute-Garonne. Its see is Toulouse Cathedral, in the city of Toulouse, and the current archbishop is Robert Jean Louis Le Gall, appointed in 2006 and translated from the Diocese of Mende. Suffragans The Archdiocese has 7 suffragan dioceses and archdioceses: Archdiocese of Albi, Archdiocese of Auch, Diocese of Cahors, Diocese of Montauban, Diocese of Pamiers, Diocese of Rodez, Diocese of Tarbes- et-Lourdes. Jurisdiction As re-established by the Concordat of 1802, it included the departments of Haute-Garonne and Ari√®ge, at which time, the archbishop joined to his own the title of Auch, jurisdiction over Auch being given to the Diocese of Agen, also the title of Narbonne, an archdiocese over which jurisdiction went by the Concordat to the Diocese of Carcassonne, and the title of Albi, over which, though formerly an archdiocese, jurisdiction went by the Concordat to the See of Montpellier. In consequence of the creation of the Archdiocese of Auch and Archdiocese of Albi under the Restoration, the Archbishop of Toulouse only styled himself Archbishop of Toulouse and Narbonne, and when the Diocese of Pamiers was created the limits of the Archdiocese were restricted to the Department of Haute-Garonne. As thus marked off by the Bull Paternae Caritatis, July, 1822, the Archdiocese of Toulouse includes almost the whole of the ancient Diocese of Toulouse, Diocese of Rieux, and Diocese of Comminges, and a few small portions of the ancient Diocese of Montauban, Diocese of Lavaur, Diocese of St-Papoul, Diocese of Mirepoix, and Diocese of Lombez. History Toulouse, chief town of the Tectosagi, at the end of the second century B.C. tried to shake off the yoke of Rome during the invasion of the Cimbri, but at the beginning of the empire it was a prosperous Roman civitas with famous schools in which the three brothers of the Emperor Constantine were pupils. In the fourth century it was reckoned the fifteenth town in importance in the empire. In 413 it was taken by Astulph, the Goth, and in 419 under Wallia it became the capital of the Visigothic Kingdom. In 508 after conquest by Clovis it became Frankish. Legends of more or less recent date claim that it was evangelized by St. Martial, but as far as historical evidence goes the see seems to have been founded by St. Saturninus (Sernin) in the middle of the third century. The Passio Sancti Saturnini corroborates this date as that of his incumbency and martyrdom. Subsequent tradition claims that he was a disciple of St. Peter. St. Papoul was his companion and like him a martyr. St. Honoratus, given in some lists as St. Saturninus's successor, is recognised as a pre-Schism Western saint by the Orthodox Church and it is therefore wrong to suggest that he seems just to have crept in through error from the fabulous legend of St. Firminus of Amiens. Among the bishops of Toulouse may be mentioned: Rhodanius (350-58), exiled by Constantius to Phrygia because of his efforts against Arianism at the Council of B√©ziers in 356; St. Hilary, whom some historians place before Rhodanius, but who is placed after him by Duchesne; St. Sylvius (360-400); St. Exuperius (c. 400), who drove from his diocese in 405 the heretic Vigilantius, saved Toulouse from the Vandals, and was the friend of St. Jerome; St. Germerius (Germier), whose episcopate (c. 541) is questioned by Duchesne; Magnulphus (c. 585), exiled by King Gundoald; (657), a monk of Fontenelle who returned to his monastery to die. From being the capital of the Duchy of Aquitaine, from 631, Toulouse became in 778 the capital of the County of Toulouse created by Charlemagne, and which in the tenth century was one of the main fiefs of the crown. Raymond IV, Count of Toulouse, known as Raymond de Saint Gilles (1042‚Äì1105), was one of the leaders of the First Crusade. Raymond VI and Raymond VII, Counts of Toulouse, had leanings towards the Cathars. Simon of Montfort in 1218 died under the walls of Toulouse, At this time Toulouse had as bishop Fulk of Marseilles (1206‚Äì1231), who fought against Raymond VI and protected the Friars-Preachers in their early days. The marriage (1249) of Jeanne, daughter of Raymond VII, with Alphonse de Poitiers, brother of Louis IX of France, led to the uniting in 1271 of the County of Toulouse to the Crown of France, and Toulouse became the capital of the Province of Languedoc. The See of Toulouse was for a time made famous by St. Louis (1296‚Äì97), son of Charles II, King of Naples and the Two Sicilies, and of Mary, daughter of the King of Hungary: he was nephew of St. Elizabeth of Hungary and grand-nephew of St. Louis, King of France. Louis had resigned to his brother Robert all rights over the Kingdom of Naples, and had accepted from Pope Boniface VIII the See of Toulouse after becoming a Franciscan friar. His successor was Peter de la Chapelle Taillefer (1298‚Äì1312) who was created cardinal in 1305. To this epoch belongs a change that took place in the history of the Diocese of Toulouse. It decreased in size but increased in dignity. Before 1295 the Diocese of Toulouse was very extensive. At the beginning of the thirteenth century Bishop Fulk had wished to divide it into several dioceses. In 1295 a portion of territory was cut off by Boniface VIII to form the Diocese of Pamiers. Then in 1319 John XXII cut off the Diocese of Toulouse from the metropolitan church of Narbonne and made it a metropolitan with the Sees of Montauban, Saint-Papoul, Rieux, and Lombez as suffragans; a little later Lavaur and Mirepoix also became suffragans of Toulouse. The majority of these sees were composed of territory cut off from the ancient See of Toulouse itself. According to Pope John XXII, not only was the diocese too large and too populated for a single bishop to carry out all of his necessary functions, but also it was immensely rich and did not spend its wealth for the growth of the faith, but on luxuries and dissipation of every sort.J.-M. Vidal, \\"Les origines de la province eccl√©siastique de Toulouse,\\" Annales du Midi 15 (1903), pp. 469-492. Pope John XXII offered the See of Riez in Provence to Gaillard de Preyssac, Bishop of Toulouse since 1305, whom he suspected of having conspired against him with Hugues Giraud, Bishop of Cahors. Gaillard refused the offer, and retired to Avignon where he died in 1327. The first archbishop was Raymond de Comminges, Bishop of Maguelonne from 1309, who, when created cardinal in 1327, resigned the See of Toulouse in order to take up his duties at the Papal Curia in Avignon, where he died in 1348. He left a book on the \\"Passion of the Saviour\\", and some \\"Sermons for Festival Days\\". Among his successors were: the Dominican William de Laudun (1327‚Äì1345), previously bishop of Vienne; Raymond de Canillac (1345‚Äì50), who resigned upon being named a cardinal in 1350; Cardinal Francis de Gozie (1391‚Äì92); Bernard du Rosier (1451‚Äì1474), author of two treatises on the temporal power of the pope and on the liberty of the Church, and who founded at Toulouse the College de Foix for the support of twenty-five poor scholars, where he collected one of the first libraries of the period; John of Orl√©ans (1503‚Äì1533), cardinal in 1533. Protestantism entered Toulouse in 1532 through foreign students. As early as 1563 the Catholics of Toulouse founded a league to uphold the prerogatives of Catholicism, protected by the Parlement but jeopardized by certain Protestant town-councillors. From 1586 to 1595 the League party under Montmorency, Governor of Languedoc, and the Duc de Joyeuse held control in Toulouse. The rule of Henry IV of France was definitively recognized there in 1596. During this period of religious unrest Toulouse had many notable archbishops: Gabriel de Gramont (1533‚Äì34), cardinal in 1530; Odet de Ch√¢tillon, Cardinal de Coligny (1534‚Äì1550), who became a Calvinist, married in 1564, and died in 1571; Anthony Sanguin (1550‚Äì1559), Cardinal de Meudon in 1539; Georges d'Armagnac (1562‚Äì1577), cardinal in 1544; Fran√ßois de Joyeuse (1584‚Äì1605), cardinal in 1583 and who conducted the negotiations between Henry IV and the Holy See.

She was the first woman ever elected to the Yukon Territorial Council, serving from 1967 to 1970. Biography Gordon was born in 1918 in Vancouver, British Columbia and grew up in the B.C. towns of Alice Arm and Stewart. She met Wilfred Gordon in Stewart and married him in 1937 when she was 19 years old; a year later they moved to Dawson City, Yukon. In Dawson City, the Gordons took up animal trapping and raised three bear cubs. They lived there until 1945, when they moved to Mayo, Yukon so that their young daughter could attend school and socialise with other children. In Mayo, Gordon started volunteering: she was a secretary and treasurer for the Mayo Community Club, an accountant for the Mayo Community Theatre, and a columnist for the local newspaper, the Whitehorse Star. In 1967 she decided to run for election to the Yukon Territorial Council because of her concern for water and sewer systems in the local area. She was later quoted as saying that the main reason for her running was because \\"I couldn't keep my mouth shut\\". Her election campaign was successful, and she became the first woman ever elected to the council in its 59-year history. She sat on the council for three years, during which time she requested that the other (male) members call her Charlie to make it clear that \\"she expected no special treatment as a woman\\". Gordon was not re-elected to the Yukon Territorial Council in 1970, so instead she completed a certificate in bookkeeping and took jobs with Canada Manpower, the Mayo post office, and established the Mayo Outreach Office. She also spent 20 years working for the Yukon Water Board and helped to coordinate the International Year of Older Persons in Yukon in 1999, which involved planting a birch tree for every senior citizen in Mayo. She died in 2008 in Mayo after a prolonged illness.

It involved 10 one-hour episodes (together with 7 half-hour \\"up close and personal\\" shows) and was originally shown on BBC Three in October 2007.  Description  The series involved 12 opinionated teens who were required to prove that they could successfully run a school without adult teachers. It was seen as a social experiment, as the group of twelve teenagers were expected to act as teachers. It was an aspiration of each member to undertake such a task, but the producers had created a challenge for each 'teacher', one which proved difficult from the start. The filming took place at Wispers School in Haslemere, Surrey and lasted for 3 weeks. The show depicted the struggles the teenagers went through to keep their cool teaching a class, and featured clips of the teens living under the same roof. The experiment was structured in a way that forced the new teachers into cooperation with each other, creating a team out of a collection of strangers. Throughout the series, effects of the experiment were shown, and many social issues came into play. Throughout the course of schooling, a professional school inspector was asked to oversee the proceedings, taking note of the teen's progress and ability. At the conclusion of the programme, the teachers had failed 2 inspections, but seemed to have improved greatly from their previous selves, completing the experiment and bringing the series to a close.

Sentence He was sentenced to 18 months in prison, suspended for two years, after admitting nine charges of indecently assaulting seven pupils (six girls and one boy, between the ages of 10 and 13) in the late 1960s/1970s. After lengthy legal wrangling and plea-bargaining he pleaded guilty and was allowed to walk free. Judge David Griffiths said, a serious breach of trust which would normally warrant a custodial sentence, but due to Peverett's accomplishments - there were glowing testimonies from former pupils, staff, parents, fellow heads and even one ex-cabinet minister - his was an exceptional case. He was later stripped of his OBE (awarded 1995) following his conviction. 2003: Another male victim came forward. CPS declined to take up the case. 2014: A further male victim filed a complaint with Kent Police who indicated that they were aware of two other male victims who were not part of the original criminal and civil cases.

Through this Declaration, WAN-IFRA has stated its conviction that Africa urgently needs a strong, free and independent press to act as a watchdog over public institutions, a crucial role that the press is hindered from and punished for playing by the widespread resort to 'insult laws' and criminal defamation, in particular. Major African and international non-governmental organisations that, day after day, defend and promote freedom of expression and freedom of the press have now endorsed the Declaration and expressed their readiness to contribute to this campaign. Together, with determination, we will now aggressively press our case in the hope for a better future for African media freedom.

The Demonstrations are open-source, which means that they not only demonstrate the concept itself but also show how to implement it. Alternatives The use of the web to transmit small interactive programs is reminiscent of Sun's Java applets, Adobe's Flash, and the open-source Processing. However, those creating Demonstrations have access to the algorithmic and visualization capabilities of Mathematica making it more suitable for technical demonstrations.

It is a GABA analogue, or an analogue of the neurotransmitter Œ≥-aminobutyric acid (GABA), and has been found to be an endogenous metabolite of GABA. Medical uses GABOB is an anticonvulsant and is used in the treatment of epilepsy. Pharmacology GABOB is a GABA receptor agonist. It has two stereoisomers, and shows stereoselectivity in its actions. Specifically, (R)-(‚Äì)-GABOB is a moderate-potency agonist of the GABAB receptor, while (S)-(+)-GABOB is a partial agonist of the GABAB receptor and an agonist of the GABAA receptor. (S)-(+)-GABOB is around twice as potent an anticonvulsant as (R)-(‚Äì)-GABOB. GABOB is used medically as a racemic mixture. Relative to GABA, GABOB has more potent inhibitory effects on the central nervous system, perhaps due to its greater capacity to cross the blood‚Äìbrain barrier. However, GABOB is of relatively low potency as an anticonvulsant when used by itself, and is more useful as an adjuvant treatment used alongside another anticonvulsant. Chemistry GABOB, or Œ≤-hydroxy-GABA, is a close structural analogue of GABA (see GABA analogue), as well as of Œ≥-hydroxybutyric acid (GHB), phenibut (Œ≤-phenyl-GABA), baclofen (Œ≤-(4-chlorophenyl)-GABA), and pregabalin (Œ≤-isobutyl-GABA). Society and culture =Generic name= GABOB has been referred to by the generic name buxamine or buxamina. =Brand names= GABOB is sold primarily under the brand name Gamibetal.

Works American Fundamentalists: Christ‚Äôs Entry into Washington in 2008 In 2004 Pelletier created a modern-day version of James Ensor's Christ's Entry Into Brussels in 1889 called American Fundamentalists: Christ‚Äôs Entry into Washington in 2008. Pelletier‚Äôs work adapts and expands Ensor's mockery of government, religious and business leaders, recasting the return of Jesus based on modern biblical interpretations of the late 20th century American Christian Fundamentalist and Christian Dominionist movements, especially of Left Behind author and activist Tim LaHaye. The work has been displayed throughout the United States and Europe, usually accompanied by presentations by and discussion with the artist. American Fundamentalist Movement Pelletier has written a manifesto that comments on American Fundamentalism. Religion, politics, economy, and corporations are discussed.

Zhang was born in Pingliang. He works in a variety of media such as painting (sometimes with soy sauce), sculpture, collage, ceramics, digital imaging and installation.Wang Ying, Reading Zhang Hongtu, University of Pittsburgh online His work explores the freedom to criticize the Chinese authorities afforded to an artist living in the West.Legacy-Project.org It also reflects on themes of authority and belief (specifically the power of iconic imagery)and cross-cultural 'East and West' connections.These themes are largely derived from his \\"outsider\\" standing as a Muslim in China and, after his move to the United States, as a Chinese citizen in the Western world. He studied at the Central Academy of Arts and Crafts in Beijing. In 1987 he took part in the founding of The Chinese United Overseas Artists Association, along with Li Shuang, Qu Leilei, Ai Weiwei. Biographical =Early life= Zhang Hongtu was born in 1943 into a Muslim family in Pingliang, 100 miles northwest of Xi‚Äôan. His family was constantly on the move however, so that Hongtu never quite belonged to any of the places he moved. Zhang Hongtu's father, Zhang Bingduo, was a devout Muslim and traveled throughout China to start schools in the Arabic language. From 1947 to 1950, with the Chinese civil war raging, Hongtu's father mobilized his family, moving them from Pingliang in the northwest to Shanghai, Suzhou, and Nanjing, and then north to Zhengzhou. Before the communist defeat, Zhang Bingduo intended to escape with his family to Hong Kong, but was convinced to move to Beijing by a Muslim professor. In Beijing, the members of the Zhang family were outsiders. Hongtu's father worked various jobs for the new government, including the Minority Affairs Association, the Xinhua News Agency, the Central Broadcasting Administration, and eventually he became the vice president of the National Muslim Association. However, their religious affiliation in an officially atheistic state made life increasingly difficult. Bingduo was branded a Rightist in 1957. And while he avoided being sent to a reeducation camp, Hongtu's mother lost her job and talk of religion disappeared within the household. =The Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution= In 1958, Chairman Mao Zedong‚Äôs Great Leap Forward began and its effects were felt profoundly by the Zhang family. From that period, Hongtu remembered being asked to create a mural at his junior high school. He produced a mural with three revolutionary flags ‚Äì one symbolizing the Great Leap Forward, a second symbolizing the People‚Äôs Communes, and the third symbolizing the General Principle of Socialist Construction. But when the Great Leap Forward failed as the result of economic mismanagement, famine plagued China. Zhang Hongtu remembered: ‚Äú we discovered all the hungry people, beggars from the country so skinny, with no clothes. Every single day, and you're so hungry yourself that you just couldn't sleep but so tires you can't wake up. We heard one thing from school and the newspapers but we saw something else from reality and we felt betrayed. You needed a scale to weigh out food to make sure there'd be some at the end of the month. I'd go with my father to the park to pick plants to eat.‚Äù In 1966, Chairman Mao tried to redeem the failure of the Great Leap Forward by introducing a Cultural Revolution. At its outset, the Muslim Association was disbanded, greatly disillusioning Zhang Hongtu‚Äôs father, who refused to re-accept his job when the Cultural Revolution finally ended in 1976. =Art education within the context of the Cultural Revolution= In 1960, when Hongtu was sixteen years old, he began his studies at the high school attached to Beijing‚Äôs prestigious Central Academy of Arts. However, in 1964, the school was declared ‚Äúcorrupt‚Äù by Chairman Mao's wife, Jiang Qing, and Hongtu began his professional art studies at Beijing's Central Academy of Arts and Crafts. At the dawn of the Cultural Revolution in 1966, Hongtu's art studies were terminated and political activities became a more central focus. During the Cultural Revolution, trains were made available to students for travel and \\"linking up\\" with the people of China.Hongtu used the opportunity to travel west to Xinjiang and then to Guangzhou. However, the government found the ‚Äúlinking up‚Äù program to be unmanageable and the program was ended. So Hongtu and five friends, including artist Yu Youhan, used the historical ‚ÄúLong March‚Äù as a model, crossing the countryside by foot and using their art on behalf of the current political movement. They marched north to the Jinggang Mountains in the Jiangxi province. This place was where Mao's first organization activities for the Chinese Communist Party began. From there, the group traveled to Mao's birthplace at Shaoshan, carrying flags and a portrait of Chairman Mao. By the time they returned to Beijing, the Cultural Revolution had begun to have serious repercussions for the Zhang family. Hongtu was criticized for his bad family background and his interest in Western art. He was then prohibited from painting Mao's portrait. Looking back on his long march, Zhang Hongtu has said: ‚ÄúNobody bothered me at that time about my family background. It was nice to see the landscape, so nice for a city boy. But after this trip, I changed a lot. The bad part is, I saw people kill each other, literally. I began to ask, ‚ÄòIs this really the Cultural Revolution?‚Äô I saw people put so many books all together like a hill and then burn them. I saw so many poor people, it was beyond my imagination. The reality of it didn't fit my imagination of the Cultural Revolution. I got back and instead of being a participant, I became an ‚Äòescapist‚Äô.‚Äù In Beijing, his home was searched for materials against the revolutionary movement. His trust in Mao and Mao‚Äôs writings slowly turned into sentiments of betrayal. Looking back on the Cultural Revolution, Zhang Hongtu has said, \\"I had to criticize my own painting‚Ä¶ One friend who was so good toward me but really was just spying checked out my diary without telling me, to see how badly I hated the Communist Party. He found nothing and said so, but I was so hurt. After that, I couldn‚Äôt write anything. That was the worst result of the Cultural Revolution. To this day, people don‚Äôt trust each other, don‚Äôt think about the future, just think about themselves and find security only in making money. That‚Äôs hard to change now, and most people in my generation just don‚Äôt want to talk about the Cultural Revolution.‚Äú Although Hongtu's education was brought to an end in 1966, his class still officially graduated and was sent to the countryside near Shijiazhuang to work in the rice fields. The last two years they spend in the fields, they were allowed to produce art on Sundays and stored their painting tools and materials in the baskets used for collecting cow dung. They became known as the ‚ÄúDung Basket School of Painting.‚Äù In 1972, the class was assembled and given their diplomas ‚Äì belatedly. A year after receiving his diploma, Zhang Hongtu was assigned work in the Beijing Jewelry Import-Export Company. =Transition to the United States= After Zhang Hongtu was assigned to work with the Beijing Jewelry Import-Export Company, he spent nine years doing professional jewelry design. In 1981, Zhang suggested to his supervisors that they send him to the Buddhist cave paintings at Dunhuang to gather design ideas for jewelry making. He has suggested that the twenty-nine days he spent in Dunhuang making copies of the paintings became very important to his later artworks. Zhang Hongtu did most of his artwork on Sunday evenings, dabbling in still-life drawings, landscapes, and paintings from models. In 1979, he joined the ‚ÄúContemporaries‚Äù art group, Tongdai Ren. Their group was the first to exhibit their works at the National Art Gallery in June 1980 and included mostly landscapes and portraits. The attention he received for his works at the exhibition led Zhang to request permission to change jobs, but his file would not be released by the Jewelry Company. For the sake of his work, Zhang Hontu resolved to leave the country. In three days, the jewelry design company gave him permission to travel to New York City and study at the Art Students League. It was two years before Zhang Hongtu's family was able to follow him to the United States. He worked construction jobs, painting walls for a meager $50 per day. It took two years for him to sell two paintings, the second painting providing some encouragement to the struggling artist for its $1800 pay check by the World Bank in Washington, D.C. I purchased Zhang's first painting in the US it is called \\"Beijing Bicyclists\\" It has hung on my walls since 1982 in New York and now Pittsburgh Pa.We purchased the painting for $1700.00 A few years ago I was able to communicate with Zhang about the painting and he was pleased that we still retained possession of the piece. But Zhang Hongtu's career in the Western world didn't really take off until 1987, when he painted a portrait of Chairman Mao onto a Quaker Oats box; an act that would eventually transform into part of Hongtu's famous Long Live Chairman Mao Series. \\"Political Pop\\" (late 1980s to 1990s) In 1987, Zhang Hongtu took brush and paint to a Quaker Oats box. One day, while eating oatmeal for breakfast, it occurred to him that there was a resemblance between Mr. Quaker and Chairman Mao. The idea of Chairman Mao's presence being so inescapable, even in his life in the United States, and that with just a few brushstrokes, the face of an American icon could become a Chinese icon, marks an important shift in Hongtu's artistic development. This was the birth of his Long Live Chairman Mao Series This particular artwork became one of the first of China's ‚Äúpolitical pop‚Äù movement that helped launch Contemporary Chinese painting into its current popularity. \\"Political Pop\\" refers to artworks that appropriate the visual tropes of propaganda (specifically the Cultural Revolution) and reworks them into he Western \\"pop art\\" style. It marked the beginning of what Jerome Silbergeld notes as ‚Äúa long romance between Chinese and Western icons‚Äù in Zhang Hongtu's work. Shortly after the Events at Tiananmen Square in 1989, Zhang Hongtu painted the Last Banquet, which satirized Chairman Mao's deification and the revered writings of the Little Red Book. A senatorial group sponsored an exhibition in the Russell Rotunda in Washington D.C. as a response to the events at Tiananmen Square and Zhang Hongtu submitted Last Banquet for the exhibition. Senator Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts declared the artwork as \\"sacrilegious\\" and barred it from the exhibition. According to Silbergeld, \\"Zhang had come full circle, censored at an American exhibition protesting censorship in China.\\" Zhang pulled out of the exhibit and his fellow artists followed his lead. Consequently, though originally priced at $4000, Last Banquet was sold five years later for $50,000. Both the Long Live Chairman Mao Series and the Last Banquet set the stage for his later works, which reached back into his personal history. Many of these works took influences from his experiences as a Muslim outsider in China and his \\"otherness\\" in the United States. Zhang's works reflect on authority and belief; about the power of icons. His icons are meant to reach across cultural boundaries and to \\"offend all audiences equally.\\" About the walls between cultures, Zhang Hongtu has said, \\"In my art, I try to make a way through the wall, to put a door, a hole in the wall, by using Western art with my own art. There's a Chinese saying, 'You can't breed a horse with a cow'. My work is the opposite, like 'Daring to breed the horse with the cow'. Zhang collaborated with designer Vivienne Tam on her 1995 collection of clothing with satirical images of Mao. When Tam decided to place Zhang's provocative images of Mao on her line of shirts and dresses, it provoked controversy in both China and the United States. Several Hong Kong garment manufacturers refused to produce her Mao designs. Chairman Mao was not the only cultural icon portrayed in Zhang's artwork. In a series of cut-outs from the early 1990s, he also includes images of Buddha, the crucifixion of Christ, the cross, the holy trinity, ionic columns, traditional Chinese book bound with thread, and the Great Wall. In his deconstruction of cultural icons, Zhang Hongtu has used cutouts and contrast. He cuts images out, turning positives into negatives and solids into voids. In so doing, the artist criticizes commonly held value judgements of high and low and the distinction between them. These unfilled images are surrounded by materials such as oil, rice, grass, MSG, soy sauce, cement, nails and corns etc. The conflicting image of emptiness and basic, raw surrounding substances have attributed in his success in creating tension. This tension has caused viewers to think about the contrasting relationships between 'high and low', 'common and grand' and 'reality and illusion.' Importantly, Zhang Hongtu does not provide answers to the issues his artworks raise about globalization, 'East and West', 'high and low', and elite culture from the museum to mass culture. Instead, they provoke the viewer to question and to think about the issues from different cultural and societal perspectives. Landscape paintings Zhang Hongtu's most recent artworks examine the relationship between the \\"East and West\\" in landscape paintings. He began producing oil paintings in the late 1990s, using compositions of Chinese landscapes and executed them in the styles of European Impressionists. The series explores the nature of modernism and the artistic encounter between China and the West. Repainting Shanshui is a series that Zhang Hongtu began in 1998 to explore the parody of values and conventions of Chinese and Western art. Selected artworks =Long Live Chairman Mao Series #29 (1989)= Acrylic and Quaker Oats Box 24.4 x 12.7 x 12.7 cm In 1987, Zhang Hongtu first took his paintbrush to a Quaker Oats box, changing the iconic Western figure into the iconic Chinese figure of Chairman Mao. He transplanted the omnipresent image of Chairman Mao into a parody Western logo. For Zhang, the image of Chairman Mao seemed ubiquitous, and with just a few brushstrokes he was able to juxtapose Western and Eastern cultures in a humorous critique. This artwork is seen as one of the first \\"political pop\\" artworks from a Chinese artist. The Saatchi Gallery, which housed an exhibition of Zhang Hongtu's work, notes that \\"The uncanny resemblance between communist leader and puritan farmer ironically confuses propaganda, religion, and ideology with the kitsch of advertising and cult of personality; like Elvis and Jesus, once you start looking Mao can be found everywhere.\\" Thus, the image expands cross-culturally, suggesting the pervasiveness of Mao's international legacy. =The Last Banquet (1989)= 60 x 168 The pages of the \\"Little Red Book\\" and acrylic After the Tiananmen Square Massacre in 1989, Zhang Hongtu's reacted through the production of artworks. In The Last Banquet, Zhang recreated Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper to criticize the social and political banquets of Mao's China. The Last Banquet was going to be exhibited by the Congressional Human Rights Foundation in Washington, D.C. to mark the first anniversary of the Tiananmen Square Massacre. The painting was rejected because it \\"offended Christian values.\\" The painting was intended to be a satire about the deification of Chairman Mao, surrounded by disciples who made themselves in his image.

These editions are: = Mainstream editions = ; Enterprise: SQL Server Enterprise Edition includes both the core database engine and add-on services, with a range of tools for creating and managing a SQL Server cluster. It can manage databases as large as 524 petabytes and address 12 terabytes of memory and supports 640 logical processors (CPU cores). ; Standard: SQL Server Standard edition includes the core database engine, along with the stand-alone services. It differs from Enterprise edition in that it supports fewer active instances (number of nodes in a cluster) and does not include some high-availability functions such as hot-add memory (allowing memory to be added while the server is still running), and parallel indexes. ; Web: SQL Server Web Edition is a low-TCO option for Web hosting. ; Business Intelligence: Introduced in SQL Server 2012 and focusing on Self Service and Corporate Business Intelligence. It includes the Standard Edition capabilities and Business Intelligence tools: PowerPivot, Power View, the BI Semantic Model, Master Data Services, Data Quality Services and xVelocity in-memory analytics. ; Workgroup: SQL Server Workgroup Edition includes the core database functionality but does not include the additional services. Note that this edition has been retired in SQL Server 2012. ; Express: SQL Server Express Edition is a scaled down, free edition of SQL Server, which includes the core database engine. While there are no limitations on the number of databases or users supported, it is limited to using one processor, 1 GB memory and 10 GB database files (4 GB database files prior to SQL Server Express 2008 R2). It is intended as a replacement for MSDE. Two additional editions provide a superset of features not in the original Express Edition. The first is SQL Server Express with Tools, which includes SQL Server Management Studio Basic. SQL Server Express with Advanced Services adds full- text search capability and reporting services. = Specialized editions = SQL Server 2005 Developer Edition installation disc ; Azure: Microsoft Azure SQL Database is the cloud-based version of Microsoft SQL Server, presented as a platform as a service offering on Microsoft Azure. ; Azure: Azure SQL Data Warehouse is the cloud-based version of Microsoft SQL Server in a MPP (massively parallel processing) architecture for analytics workloads, presented as a platform as a service offering on Microsoft Azure. ; Compact (SQL CE): The compact edition is an embedded database engine. Unlike the other editions of SQL Server, the SQL CE engine is based on SQL Mobile (initially designed for use with hand-held devices) and does not share the same binaries. Due to its small size (1 MB DLL footprint), it has a markedly reduced feature set compared to the other editions.

It supports 256 logical processors and virtually unlimited memory and comes with StreamInsight Premium edition. The Datacenter edition has been retired in SQL Server 2012; all of its features are available in SQL Server 2012 Enterprise Edition.  Architecture  The protocol layer implements the external interface to SQL Server. All operations that can be invoked on SQL Server are communicated to it via a Microsoft- defined format, called Tabular Data Stream (TDS). TDS is an application layer protocol, used to transfer data between a database server and a client. Initially designed and developed by Sybase Inc. for their Sybase SQL Server relational database engine in 1984, and later by Microsoft in Microsoft SQL Server, TDS packets can be encased in other physical transport dependent protocols, including TCP/IP, named pipes, and shared memory. Consequently, access to SQL Server is available over these protocols. In addition, the SQL Server API is also exposed over web services.  Data storage  Data storage is a database, which is a collection of tables with typed columns. SQL Server supports different data types, including primitive types such as Integer, Float, Decimal, Char (including character strings), Varchar (variable length character strings), binary (for unstructured blobs of data), Text (for textual data) among others. The rounding of floats to integers uses either Symmetric Arithmetic Rounding or Symmetric Round Down (fix) depending on arguments: \`SELECT Round(2.5, 0)\` gives 3. Microsoft SQL Server also allows user-defined composite types (UDTs) to be defined and used. It also makes server statistics available as virtual tables and views (called Dynamic Management Views or DMVs). In addition to tables, a database can also contain other objects including views, stored procedures, indexes and constraints, along with a transaction log. A SQL Server database can contain a maximum of 231 objects, and can span multiple OS-level files with a maximum file size of 260 bytes (1 exabyte). The data in the database are stored in primary data files with an extension \`.mdf\`. Secondary data files, identified with a \`.ndf\` extension, are used to allow the data of a single database to be spread across more than one file, and optionally across more than one file system. Log files are identified with the \`.ldf\` extension. Storage space allocated to a database is divided into sequentially numbered pages, each 8 KB in size. A page is the basic unit of I/O for SQL Server operations. A page is marked with a 96-byte header which stores metadata about the page including the page number, page type, free space on the page and the ID of the object that owns it. The page type defines the data contained in the page. This data includes: data stored in the database, an index, an allocation map, which holds information about how pages are allocated to tables and indexes; and a change map which holds information about the changes made to other pages since last backup or logging, or contain large data types such as image or text. While a page is the basic unit of an I/O operation, space is actually managed in terms of an extent which consists of 8 pages. A database object can either span all 8 pages in an extent (\\"uniform extent\\") or share an extent with up to 7 more objects (\\"mixed extent\\"). A row in a database table cannot span more than one page, so is limited to 8 KB in size. However, if the data exceeds 8 KB and the row contains varchar or varbinary data, the data in those columns are moved to a new page (or possibly a sequence of pages, called an allocation unit) and replaced with a pointer to the data. For physical storage of a table, its rows are divided into a series of partitions (numbered 1 to n). The partition size is user defined; by default all rows are in a single partition. A table is split into multiple partitions in order to spread a database over a computer cluster. Rows in each partition are stored in either B-tree or heap structure. If the table has an associated, clustered index to allow fast retrieval of rows, the rows are stored in-order according to their index values, with a B-tree providing the index. The data is in the leaf node of the leaves, and other nodes storing the index values for the leaf data reachable from the respective nodes. If the index is non-clustered, the rows are not sorted according to the index keys. An indexed view has the same storage structure as an indexed table. A table without a clustered index is stored in an unordered heap structure. However, the table may have non-clustered indices to allow fast retrieval of rows. In some situations the heap structure has performance advantages over the clustered structure. Both heaps and B-trees can span multiple allocation units. = Buffer management = SQL Server buffers pages in RAM to minimize disk I/O. Any 8 KB page can be buffered in-memory, and the set of all pages currently buffered is called the buffer cache. The amount of memory available to SQL Server decides how many pages will be cached in memory. The buffer cache is managed by the Buffer Manager. Either reading from or writing to any page copies it to the buffer cache. Subsequent reads or writes are redirected to the in-memory copy, rather than the on-disc version. The page is updated on the disc by the Buffer Manager only if the in-memory cache has not been referenced for some time. While writing pages back to disc, asynchronous I/O is used whereby the I/O operation is done in a background thread so that other operations do not have to wait for the I/O operation to complete. Each page is written along with its checksum when it is written. When reading the page back, its checksum is computed again and matched with the stored version to ensure the page has not been damaged or tampered with in the meantime. = Concurrency and locking = SQL Server allows multiple clients to use the same database concurrently. As such, it needs to control concurrent access to shared data, to ensure data integrity‚Äîwhen multiple clients update the same data, or clients attempt to read data that is in the process of being changed by another client. SQL Server provides two modes of concurrency control: pessimistic concurrency and optimistic concurrency. When pessimistic concurrency control is being used, SQL Server controls concurrent access by using locks. Locks can be either shared or exclusive. Exclusive lock grants the user exclusive access to the data‚Äîno other user can access the data as long as the lock is held. Shared locks are used when some data is being read‚Äîmultiple users can read from data locked with a shared lock, but not acquire an exclusive lock. The latter would have to wait for all shared locks to be released. Locks can be applied on different levels of granularity‚Äîon entire tables, pages, or even on a per-row basis on tables. For indexes, it can either be on the entire index or on index leaves. The level of granularity to be used is defined on a per-database basis by the database administrator. While a fine-grained locking system allows more users to use the table or index simultaneously, it requires more resources, so it does not automatically yield higher performance. SQL Server also includes two more lightweight mutual exclusion solutions‚Äîlatches and spinlocks‚Äîwhich are less robust than locks but are less resource intensive. SQL Server uses them for DMVs and other resources that are usually not busy. SQL Server also monitors all worker threads that acquire locks to ensure that they do not end up in deadlocks‚Äîin case they do, SQL Server takes remedial measures, which in many cases are to kill one of the threads entangled in a deadlock and roll back the transaction it started. To implement locking, SQL Server contains the Lock Manager. The Lock Manager maintains an in-memory table that manages the database objects and locks, if any, on them along with other metadata about the lock. Access to any shared object is mediated by the lock manager, which either grants access to the resource or blocks it. SQL Server also provides the optimistic concurrency control mechanism, which is similar to the multiversion concurrency control used in other databases. The mechanism allows a new version of a row to be created whenever the row is updated, as opposed to overwriting the row, i.e., a row is additionally identified by the ID of the transaction that created the version of the row. Both the old as well as the new versions of the row are stored and maintained, though the old versions are moved out of the database into a system database identified as \`Tempdb\`. When a row is in the process of being updated, any other requests are not blocked (unlike locking) but are executed on the older version of the row. If the other request is an update statement, it will result in two different versions of the rows‚Äîboth of them will be stored by the database, identified by their respective transaction IDs.  Data retrieval and programmability  The main mode of retrieving data from a SQL Server database is querying for it. The query is expressed using a variant of SQL called T-SQL, a dialect Microsoft SQL Server shares with Sybase SQL Server due to its legacy. The query declaratively specifies what is to be retrieved. It is processed by the query processor, which figures out the sequence of steps that will be necessary to retrieve the requested data. The sequence of actions necessary to execute a query is called a query plan. There might be multiple ways to process the same query. For example, for a query that contains a join statement and a select statement, executing join on both the tables and then executing select on the results would give the same result as selecting from each table and then executing the join, but result in different execution plans. In such case, SQL Server chooses the plan that is expected to yield the results in the shortest possible time. This is called query optimization and is performed by the query processor itself. SQL Server includes a cost-based query optimizer which tries to optimize on the cost, in terms of the resources it will take to execute the query. Given a query, then the query optimizer looks at the database schema, the database statistics and the system load at that time. It then decides which sequence to access the tables referred in the query, which sequence to execute the operations and what access method to be used to access the tables. For example, if the table has an associated index, whether the index should be used or not: if the index is on a column which is not unique for most of the columns (low \\"selectivity\\"), it might not be worthwhile to use the index to access the data. Finally, it decides whether to execute the query concurrently or not. While a concurrent execution is more costly in terms of total processor time, because the execution is actually split to different processors might mean it will execute faster. Once a query plan is generated for a query, it is temporarily cached. For further invocations of the same query, the cached plan is used. Unused plans are discarded after some time. SQL Server also allows stored procedures to be defined. Stored procedures are parameterized T-SQL queries, that are stored in the server itself (and not issued by the client application as is the case with general queries). Stored procedures can accept values sent by the client as input parameters, and send back results as output parameters. They can call defined functions, and other stored procedures, including the same stored procedure (up to a set number of times). They can be selectively provided access to. Unlike other queries, stored procedures have an associated name, which is used at runtime to resolve into the actual queries. Also because the code need not be sent from the client every time (as it can be accessed by name), it reduces network traffic and somewhat improves performance. Execution plans for stored procedures are also cached as necessary. = T-SQL = T-SQL (Transact-SQL) is Microsoft's proprietary procedural language extension for SQL Server. It provides REPL (Read-Eval- Print-Loop) instructions that extend standard SQL's instruction set for Data Manipulation (DML) and Data Definition (DDL) instructions, including SQL Server-specific settings, security and database statistics management. It exposes keywords for the operations that can be performed on SQL Server, including creating and altering database schemas, entering and editing data in the database as well as monitoring and managing the server itself. Client applications that consume data or manage the server will leverage SQL Server functionality by sending T-SQL queries and statements which are then processed by the server and results (or errors) returned to the client application. For this it exposes read-only tables from which server statistics can be read. Management functionality is exposed via system-defined stored procedures which can be invoked from T-SQL queries to perform the management operation. It is also possible to create linked Servers using T-SQL. Linked servers allow a single query to process operations performed on multiple servers. = SQL Server Native Client (a.k.a. SNAC) = SQL Server Native Client is the native client side data access library for Microsoft SQL Server, version 2005 onwards. It natively implements support for the SQL Server features including the Tabular Data Stream implementation, support for mirrored SQL Server databases, full support for all data types supported by SQL Server, asynchronous operations, query notifications, encryption support, as well as receiving multiple result sets in a single database session. SQL Server Native Client is used under the hood by SQL Server plug-ins for other data access technologies, including ADO or OLE DB. The SQL Server Native Client can also be directly used, bypassing the generic data access layers. On November 28, 2011, a preview release of the SQL Server ODBC driver for Linux was released. = SQL CLR = Microsoft SQL Server 2005 includes a component named SQL CLR (\\"Common Language Runtime\\") via which it integrates with .NET Framework. Unlike most other applications that use .NET Framework, SQL Server itself hosts the .NET Framework runtime, i.e., memory, threading and resource management requirements of .NET Framework are satisfied by SQLOS itself, rather than the underlying Windows operating system. SQLOS provides deadlock detection and resolution services for .NET code as well. With SQL CLR, stored procedures and triggers can be written in any managed .NET language, including C# and VB.NET. Managed code can also be used to define UDT's (user defined types), which can persist in the database. Managed code is compiled to CLI assemblies and after being verified for type safety, registered at the database. After that, they can be invoked like any other procedure. However, only a subset of the Base Class Library is available, when running code under SQL CLR. Most APIs relating to user interface functionality are not available. When writing code for SQL CLR, data stored in SQL Server databases can be accessed using the ADO.NET APIs like any other managed application that accesses SQL Server data. However, doing that creates a new database session, different from the one in which the code is executing. To avoid this, SQL Server provides some enhancements to the ADO.NET provider that allows the connection to be redirected to the same session which already hosts the running code. Such connections are called context connections and are set by setting \`context connection\` parameter to \`true\` in the connection string. SQL Server also provides several other enhancements to the ADO.NET API, including classes to work with tabular data or a single row of data as well as classes to work with internal metadata about the data stored in the database. It also provides access to the XML features in SQL Server, including XQuery support. These enhancements are also available in T-SQL Procedures in consequence of the introduction of the new XML Datatype (query, value, nodes functions).  Services  SQL Server also includes an assortment of add-on services. While these are not essential for the operation of the database system, they provide value added services on top of the core database management system. These services either run as a part of some SQL Server component or out-of-process as Windows Service and presents their own API to control and interact with them. = Machine Learning Services = The SQL Server Machine Learning services operates within the SQL server instance, allowing people to do machine learning and data analytics without having to send data across the network or be limited by the memory of their own computers. The services come with Microsoft's R and Python distributions that contain commonly used packages for data science, along with some proprietary packages (e.g. revoscalepy, RevoScaleR, microsoftml) that can be used to create machine models at scale. Analysts can either configure their client machine to connect to a remote SQL server and push the script executions to it, or they can run a R or Python scripts as an external script inside a T-SQL query. The trained machine learning model can be stored inside a database and used for scoring. = Service Broker = Used inside an instance, programming environment. For cross-instance applications, Service Broker communicates over TCP/IP and allows the different components to be synchronized, via exchange of messages. The Service Broker, which runs as a part of the database engine, provides a reliable messaging and message queuing platform for SQL Server applications. Service broker services consists of the following parts: * message types * contracts * queues * service programs * routes The message type defines the data format used for the message. This can be an XML object, plain text or binary data, as well as a null message body for notifications. The contract defines which messages are used in an conversation between services and who can put messages in the queue. The queue acts as storage provider for the messages. They are internally implemented as tables by SQL Server, but don't support insert, update, or delete functionality. The service program receives and processes service broker messages. Usually the service program is implemented as stored procedure or CLR application. Routes are network addresses where the service broker is located on the network. Also, service broker supports security features like network authentication (using NTLM, Kerberos, or authorization certificates), integrity checking, and message encryption. = Replication Services = SQL Server Replication Services are used by SQL Server to replicate and synchronize database objects, either in entirety or a subset of the objects present, across replication agents, which might be other database servers across the network, or database caches on the client side. Replication Services follows a publisher/subscriber model, i.e., the changes are sent out by one database server (\\"publisher\\") and are received by others (\\"subscribers\\"). SQL Server supports three different types of replication: ; Transaction replication: Each transaction made to the publisher database (master database) is synced out to subscribers, who update their databases with the transaction. Transactional replication synchronizes databases in near real time. ; Merge replication: Changes made at both the publisher and subscriber databases are tracked, and periodically the changes are synchronized bi-directionally between the publisher and the subscribers. If the same data has been modified differently in both the publisher and the subscriber databases, synchronization will result in a conflict which has to be resolved, either manually or by using pre-defined policies. rowguid needs to be configured on a column if merge replication is configured. ; Snapshot replication: Snapshot replication publishes a copy of the entire database (the then-snapshot of the data) and replicates out to the subscribers. Further changes to the snapshot are not tracked. = Analysis Services = SQL Server Analysis Services adds OLAP and data mining capabilities for SQL Server databases. The OLAP engine supports MOLAP, ROLAP and HOLAP storage modes for data. Analysis Services supports the XML for Analysis standard as the underlying communication protocol. The cube data can be accessed using MDX and LINQ queries. Data mining specific functionality is exposed via the DMX query language. Analysis Services includes various algorithms‚ÄîDecision trees, clustering algorithm, Naive Bayes algorithm, time series analysis, sequence clustering algorithm, linear and logistic regression analysis, and neural networks‚Äîfor use in data mining. = Reporting Services = SQL Server Reporting Services is a report generation environment for data gathered from SQL Server databases. It is administered via a web interface. Reporting services features a web services interface to support the development of custom reporting applications. Reports are created as RDL files. Reports can be designed using recent versions of Microsoft Visual Studio (Visual Studio.NET 2003, 2005, and 2008) with Business Intelligence Development Studio, installed or with the included Report Builder. Once created, RDL files can be rendered in a variety of formats, including Excel, PDF, CSV, XML, BMP, EMF, GIF, JPEG, PNG, and TIFF, and HTML Web Archive. = Notification Services = Originally introduced as a post-release add-on for SQL Server 2000, Notification Services was bundled as part of the Microsoft SQL Server platform for the first and only time with SQL Server 2005. SQL Server Notification Services is a mechanism for generating data-driven notifications, which are sent to Notification Services subscribers. A subscriber registers for a specific event or transaction (which is registered on the database server as a trigger); when the event occurs, Notification Services can use one of three methods to send a message to the subscriber informing about the occurrence of the event. These methods include SMTP, SOAP, or by writing to a file in the filesystem. Notification Services was discontinued by Microsoft with the release of SQL Server 2008 in August 2008, and is no longer an officially supported component of the SQL Server database platform. = Integration Services = SQL Server Integration Services (SSIS) provides ETL capabilities for SQL Server for data import, data integration and data warehousing needs. Integration Services includes GUI tools to build workflows such as extracting data from various sources, querying data, transforming data‚Äîincluding aggregation, de-duplication, de-/normalization and merging of data‚Äîand then exporting the transformed data into destination databases or files. = Full Text Search Service = The SQL Server Full Text Search service architecture SQL Server Full Text Search service is a specialized indexing and querying service for unstructured text stored in SQL Server databases. The full text search index can be created on any column with character based text data. It allows for words to be searched for in the text columns. While it can be performed with the SQL \`LIKE\` operator, using SQL Server Full Text Search service can be more efficient. Full allows for inexact matching of the source string, indicated by a Rank value which can range from 0 to 1000‚Äîa higher rank means a more accurate match. It also allows linguistic matching (\\"inflectional search\\"), i.e., linguistic variants of a word (such as a verb in a different tense) will also be a match for a given word (but with a lower rank than an exact match). Proximity searches are also supported, i.e., if the words searched for do not occur in the sequence they are specified in the query but are near each other, they are also considered a match. T-SQL exposes special operators that can be used to access the FTS capabilities. The Full Text Search engine is divided into two processes: the Filter Daemon process (\`msftefd.exe\`) and the Search process (\`msftesql.exe\`). These processes interact with the SQL Server. The Search process includes the indexer (that creates the full text indexes) and the full text query processor. The indexer scans through text columns in the database. It can also index through binary columns, and use iFilters to extract meaningful text from the binary blob (for example, when a Microsoft Word document is stored as an unstructured binary file in a database). The iFilters are hosted by the Filter Daemon process. Once the text is extracted, the Filter Daemon process breaks it up into a sequence of words and hands it over to the indexer. The indexer filters out noise words, i.e., words like A, And, etc., which occur frequently and are not useful for search. With the remaining words, an inverted index is created, associating each word with the columns they were found in. SQL Server itself includes a Gatherer component that monitors changes to tables and invokes the indexer in case of updates. When a full text query is received by the SQL Server query processor, it is handed over to the FTS query processor in the Search process. The FTS query processor breaks up the query into the constituent words, filters out the noise words, and uses an inbuilt thesaurus to find out the linguistic variants for each word. The words are then queried against the inverted index and a rank of their accurateness is computed. The results are returned to the client via the SQL Server process. = SQLCMD = SQLCMD is a command line application that comes with Microsoft SQL Server, and exposes the management features of SQL Server. It allows SQL queries to be written and executed from the command prompt. It can also act as a scripting language to create and run a set of SQL statements as a script. Such scripts are stored as a \`.sql\` file, and are used either for management of databases or to create the database schema during the deployment of a database. SQLCMD was introduced with SQL Server 2005 and has continued through SQL Server versions 2008, 2008 R2, 2012, 2014, 2016 and 2019. Its predecessor for earlier versions was OSQL and ISQL, which were functionally equivalent as it pertains to TSQL execution, and many of the command line parameters are identical, although SQLCMD adds extra versatility. = Visual Studio = Microsoft Visual Studio includes native support for data programming with Microsoft SQL Server. It can be used to write and debug code to be executed by SQL CLR. It also includes a data designer that can be used to graphically create, view or edit database schemas. Queries can be created either visually or using code. SSMS 2008 onwards, provides intellisense for SQL queries as well. = SQL Server Management Studio = SQL Server Management Studio is a GUI tool included with SQL Server 2005 and later for configuring, managing, and administering all components within Microsoft SQL Server. The tool includes both script editors and graphical tools that work with objects and features of the server. SQL Server Management Studio replaces Enterprise Manager as the primary management interface for Microsoft SQL Server since SQL Server 2005. A version of SQL Server Management Studio is also available for SQL Server Express Edition, for which it is known as SQL Server Management Studio Express (SSMSE). A central feature of SQL Server Management Studio is the Object Explorer, which allows the user to browse, select, and act upon any of the objects within the server. It can be used to visually observe and analyze query plans and optimize the database performance, among others. SQL Server Management Studio can also be used to create a new database, alter any existing database schema by adding or modifying tables and indexes, or analyze performance. It includes the query windows which provide a GUI based interface to write and execute queries. = SQL Server Operations Studio = SQL Server Operations Studio (Preview) is a cross platform query editor available as an optional download. The tool allows users to write queries; export query results; commit SQL scripts to Git repositories and perform basic server diagnostics. SQL Server Operations Studio supports Windows, Mac and Linux systems. It was released to General Availability in September 2018, at which point it was also renamed to Azure Data Studio. The functionality remains the same as before. = Business Intelligence Development Studio = Business Intelligence Development Studio (BIDS) is the IDE from Microsoft used for developing data analysis and Business Intelligence solutions utilizing the Microsoft SQL Server Analysis Services, Reporting Services and Integration Services. It is based on the Microsoft Visual Studio development environment but is customized with the SQL Server services-specific extensions and project types, including tools, controls and projects for reports (using Reporting Services), Cubes and data mining structures (using Analysis Services). For SQL Server 2012 and later, this IDE has been renamed SQL Server Data Tools (SSDT).

History The earliest mines worked in India by Sumner, Heatly and Redferne included Damulia, in the Raniganj area, near the Damodar River. There were reports that the coal they mined in India was inferior to coal imported from Britain and their ventures failed. In 1814, Warren Hastings sent Rupert Jones to survey the area. Having found trace of coal at a place called Jurwah (Jirwaghar), he sank a shaft there and got coal at a depth of 9 feet only. He found the coal fared well in comparison with British coal.

A bound tariff is one which has a \\"ceiling\\" beyond which it cannot be increased. Economic issues The main economic issues that arise with tariffication stem from the nonequivalence of tariffs in NTBs in a number of scenarios. The issue analyzes nonequivalence arising from the existence of imperfect competition in importing countries, price instability in importing and exporting countries, and inefficient allocation of quantitative restrictions. It is shown that in all these cases the definition of an appropriate \\"equivalent tariff\\" to be used in tariffication is not straightforward, and that in general this equivalent tariff cannot be computed on the basis of only observed price differences between countries. Tariff-rate quotas, which are meant to be the main tool in implement tariffication according to the existing proposal, are analyzed in some detail. Concerning the relationship between tariffication and the other elements of the trade liberalization package, it is shown that tariffication would limit the scope of export subsidy policies, and that the existence of production and export subsidies makes observed price gaps between countries of questionable value in setting equivalent tariff levels. Finally, it is argued that the main focus on tariffication should be the conversion of NTBs to acceptable long-run (bound) tariffs rates, and considerable flexibility in the conversion process could be exercised during the transition period. Controversy Some pressure groups believe that tariffs are both necessary and desirable and should remain in place permanently in order to protect indigenous industries. In the Philippines, the secretary of the Department of Agriculture warned that the Rice Tariffication Law could lead to the death of the country's rice industry. The National Food Authority stated that the law would allow private traders or companies to import rice without being subject to regulation to stabilize prices, leading to uncontrolled increases in the price of rice. Research group Ibon Foundation said that non-quota tariff rice importation threatens food security and self-sufficiency in the Philippines. The group also said that tariffication will not ensure the stability of rice supply and instead will cause the price of rice to increase. Farmer's organization Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas estimates that the livelihood of some 500,000 of country's farmers will be affected by the tariffication of rice imports.

He is believed to have learned his trade from his father, about whom little is known. Lorenzo‚Äôs style, as well as that of his contemporaries Jacopo di Cione and Niccol√≤ di Pietro Gerini, was influenced by the artist Andrea di Cione. Lorenzo's paintings made use of bright colors and his compositions avoided complexity. The figures he painted tended to have round faces and were often expressionless. Another one of Lorenzo's distinctive characteristics was his precision of execution. He was known for exceptional talent in drawing, an ability that he put to use at the initial stages of his painting. Unlike many celebrated Florentine artists of this period, Lorenzo mostly received commissions from the country clergy and from the lower-middle class Florentine guilds. His successors, Bicci di Lorenzo and Neri di Bicci, continued to serve these groups. Early life and training Lorenzo di Bicci was born in Florence around 1350. He is thought to have been taught the art of painting by his father, who most likely went by the nickname Jacopo, although his full name is currently unknown. By 1370, Lorenzo had become a member of the Guild of Saint Luke, the painters‚Äô guild of Florence. The guild was named in honor of Luke the Evangelist, the patron saint of artists, whom John of Damascus had recognized as having painted the Virgin Mary's portrait. The Guild of Saint Luke brought together artists from a range of disciplines in Renaissance Florence. Lorenzo's earliest work suggests the influence of a master whose identity is unknown but who was believed to be a member of the Guild of Saint Luke.Vasari, Giorgio (1987). Lives of the Artists. London: Penguin.  Early career  Lorenzo's first public work was a panel depicting St. Martin Enthroned, painted for the Arte dei Vinattieri, the wine-merchants‚Äô guild of Florence. The painting was mounted in the Florentine church of Orsanmichele on a pilaster assigned to the guild on October 4, 1380, and is now in the Depositi Galleria d'Arte in Florence. The predella depicts the episode of St. Martin dividing his cloak with the beggar. It was about this time that Lorenzo began working with the painters Agnolo Gaddi, Corso di Jacopo, and Jacopo di Luca, and the goldsmiths Piero del Miglior and Niccolo del Lucia. As a group they were commissioned to value the statues of Faith and Hope by Giacomo di Pero created for the spandrels of the Loggia della Signoria in Florence. Lorenzo was commissioned to apply the blue enamelled ground and to gild the statues, work that provided him a steady income. A more significant project arrived In 1387 when Lorenzo was employed to decorate the cathedral of Florence. This was a major project already underway at the time. Together with Spinello Aretino and Agnolo Gaddi, Lorenzo produced preliminary drawings for the statues of the four Apostles which would be executed in marble for the fa√ßade of the church. Once the series of statues was completed, he was then commissioned, again with Aretino and Gaddi, to paint and gild them. In his biography of the artist, Giorgio Vasari notes that Lorenzo learned much of his craft from Spinello, probably during this time. Although Giorgio Vasari‚Äôs biography of Lorenzo is replete with misattributions, it does suggest that Lorenzo, during this period, produced frescoes both in and out of the city of Florence. Vasari suggests that Giovanni di Bicci de‚Äô Medici commissioned Lorenzo to paint the hall of the old house of the Medici family. Among other works that Vasari mentions are a shrine on the bridge of Scandicci and a fresco of saints together with a Madonna at Cerbaia. According to Vasari, Lorenzo was then commissioned by the family of the Medici to paint a chapel in San Marco in Florence, a fresco in which he illustrated many stories of the Madonna and depicted the Virgin herself surrounded by many saints. Later Work In 1394 Lorenzo returned to the Loggia della Signoria where he painted and gilded the statue of Charity by Jacopo di Piero Guidi. In 1395, he was commissioned to value a statue of St. Victor by Piero di Giovanni Tedesco for the facade of the Florence cathedral. Three years later, in Florence, Lorenzo created three polylobed panels for the altar of the Madonna delle Grazie in the cathedral‚Äôs nave. The panels displayed half-length images of St John the Evangelist, St. Matthew, and St. Mark. Another artist, Pesello, was responsible for the image of the Agnus Dei, which centered the canopy‚Äôs vault, while Lorenzo's most significant contribution was a curtain that accompanied the image of the Virgin. This canopy has since been dismantled and Lorenzo's panels depicting the Evangelists are now housed in the Sagrestia dei Canonici in the cathedral. The Compagni della Croce di Santo Stefano in Empoli commissioned Lorenzo, in 1399, to produce a triptych. 'Crucifixion' painting by Lorenzo di Bicci, Museo della Collegiata di Sant'Andrea, c. 1399 Lorenzo is believed to have painted two crucifixions during the years 1399 and 1400 respectively. The first is housed in the Museo della Collegiata di Sant'Andrea in Empoli and utilizes a simple, two-dimensional design. The panel represents the Crucifixion with the Virgin Mary, St. John the Evangelist and St. Francis of Assisi at the foot of the cross. It is believed to have constituted the top half of a larger panel. The second crucifixion depicts Christ on the cross surrounded by angels collecting his spilt blood. The letters INRI labeling \\"Jesus of Nazareth The King of the Jews\\" are displayed on the red headpiece above the cross. The Christ and angels depicted in the later crucifixion are compositionally very similar to the first. Imago Pietatis', painting by Lorenzo di Bicci, Czartoryski Museum in Krak√≥w, first quarter of 15th century Historians believe that Lorenzo painted a work of St. Francis and St. Anthony Abbot around the year 1400. The painting is thought to have occupied the left side of a multi-paneled altarpiece. The remaining panels are either lost or unidentified. The figures illustrated are the saints Francis of Assisi, who founded the Franciscan order in the early thirteenth century, and Anthony the Great, a Christian monk known as the Father of All Monks. The stigmata of St Francis are pin-pointed with tiny gold rays. Information concerning the next decade of Lorenzo's life and work is scanty. From 1410 there is a record of him having being paid fourteen florins for a figure of St. Nicholas for the lunette of the portal of the Ospedale di San Matteo, Florence. This work is now at the Accademia di Belle Arti. Some historians believe Lorenzo oversaw the construction of the Palazzo Capponi alle Rovinate, a late-Gothic style palace located on Via de‚Äô Bardi in Florence, Italy. This work appears to have been commissioned by Niccol√≤ da Uzzano, an Italian politician in the government of Florence. Lorenzo was often commissioned by Uzzano, and these commissions included frescoes and a painting for the Church of Saint Lucia d√® Magnoli. Giorgio Vasari‚Äôs biography of Lorenzo indicates that in 1418, Lorenzo painted a large fresco of St. Thomas examining a wound in the side of Christ. This fresco additionally included the other Apostles who were shown as surrounding Christ. Adjacent to this scene Lorenzo created a fresco of St. Christopher, and Vasari suggests that up until this point, no artist had successfully depicted a figure on such a large scale with accurate proportions. Other historians have attributed these works to Bicci di Lorenzo, Lorenzo's son. In any case, both works, impressive in scale, have managed to retain their color and definition for hundreds of years. 'Madonna and Child' painting by Lorenzo Di Bicci, Walters Art Museum, c. 1400 =Madonna and Child Paintings= Lorenzo is reported to have completed many Madonna and child paintings, however little is known about the composition dates of these paintings. Between 1375 and 1380, Lorenzo is known to have painted a Madonna of Humility with Two Angels, which is extant and held privately. Until 1936, this panel was attributed to Jacopo di Cione.Philadelphia Museum of Art. Paintings from Europe and the Americas in the Philadelphia Museum of Art: A Concise Catalogue. Philadelphia, 1994, repro. p. 220 A very similar work known to have been completed by Lorenzo between 1405 and 1410 titled Madonna and Child with Angels is conserved in the Fine Arts Museum of San Francisco, lending further support to the current attribution of the Madonna of Humility. In style, Lorenzo's is part of an established tradition. The best known is the Madonna dell'Umilita, painted by Guariento di Arpo, which Lorenzo's painting closely resembles. In both paintings, the Madonna is posed on a cushion, seated in a demure fashion suggestive of humility. The blue of her apparel is in the tradition of the Madonna and, in the case of Lorenzo's painting, the clothing is notable for its simplicity, with the absence of any elaborate drapery that is sometimes depicted. Again, this style is suggestive of the humble nature of the seated figure.Burton B. Fredericksen and Federico Zeri. Census of Pre-Nineteenth-Century Italian Paintings in North American Public Collections. Cambridge, 1972, p. 148 Some years later Lorenzo painted a Madonna and Child with St. John the Baptist, Catherine of Alexandria, Anthony Abbott, and St. Nicholas at the Virgin's feet.Philadelphia Museum of Art. Paintings from Europe and the Americas in the Philadelphia Museum of Art: A Concise Catalogue. Philadelphia, 1994, repro p. 220 The work is executed in tempera and gold on a wood panel and its size is that of a typical anconetta, or small altarpiece. During the time of Lorenzo, this image would likely have been framed in a Gothic-style tabernacle as it would have served for private, rather than public, enjoyment. Neri di Bicci, Lorenzo's grandson painted a similar work. Neri's Virgin and Child Enthroned with Two Angels and St. Ansanus, John the Baptist, St. Nicholas, St. Sebastian, Catherine of Alexandria, and Bartholomew currently resides at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. It is believed that Neri drew inspiration from his grandfather Lorenzo. A number of other Madonnas are attributed to Lorenzo, one of which is located at the Walters Art Museum in Baltimore. The locations of the remaining paintings are unknown. = Major Work = Perhaps Lorenzo's best-known work is a devotional triptych painted in 1399 that now hangs in the Museo della Collegiata di Sant'Andrea in Empoli. The Madonna is present in all three panels, although only in the center panel is she the dominant presence. The left wing depicts the Nativity and shows the Madonna kneeling in an attitude of prayer. A seated saint is in the foreground and the panel's upper section, which comes to a point, depicts a seated angel. The right panel displays the crucifixion and the Madonna is one of three figures beneath the crucifix. As in the left panel, she is clearly recognizable because of the consistency in the color of her garments and the simplicity of her figure. The pinnacle of the right panel showcases a seated female figure praying. In both side panels, Madonna's figure is on the same scale as the other figures, whereas in the center panel, she is not.R. Fremantle, Florentine Gothic Painters, London 1975, p. 411, reproduced fig. 837. The central figure is nearly identical to the Madonna of Humility with Two Angels, further suggesting that the earlier Madonna was indeed the work of Lorenzo. The Madonna in the center panel sits on a Gothic throne, adorned with a red and gold cloth. A Christ Child sits on her lap and grips her finger. Surrounding them are a group of six Saints, including both John the Evangelist and John the Baptist. Lorenzo's artistic style is seen in the clean and simple compositional structure, the use of bright color, and the expressionless character of the figures' faces.Itinerari del Museo, della Collegiata e della Chiesa di Santo Stefano. Proto Pisani R. C., Firenze, Editori: Becocci/Scala, 1994.  Influences  Lorenzo's style was influenced by Andrea di Cione di Arcangelo, who was an Italian painter, sculptor, and architect in Florence.M. Boskovits, Pittura Fiorentina alla vigilia del Rinascimento: 1370-1400, Florence 1975, pp. 55 and 108. Lorenzo served as one of his pupils and worked alongside Jacopo di Cione, Andrea's younger brother and an Italian Gothic period painter active in Florence. Death and legacy It is now clear that many of the works that Vasari attributed to Lorenzo di Bicci were in fact produced by his son, Bicci di Lorenzo. Similarly, Joseph Archer Crowe and Giovanni Battista Cavalcasele, two highly respected Italian art critics, attributed several frescoes to Lorenzo, including those in the Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence, and those in San Francesco, Arezzo, that are now thought to be painted by Bicci di Lorenzo.Bruno Santi. \\"Lorenzo di Bicci.\\" Grove Art Online. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press. Web. 20 Feb. 2017. <http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T051954>. Some confusion between the works of father and son is understandable, considering that Lorenzo personally trained his son in his workshop, one of the largest and most active studios in Florence at that time. Bicci di Lorenzo went on to become an influential painter and sculptor, much like his father, while Lorenzo's grandson, Neri di Bicci, inherited the workshop following the death of Lorenzo di Bicci and Bicci di Lorenzo. Lorenzo is believed to have died in 1427, although the exact date of death is unknown.Stirton, Paul. \\"Bicci di Lorenzo.\\" The Oxford Companion to Western Art. Oxford Art Online. Oxford University Press, accessed February 20, 2017, http://www.oxfordartonline.com/subscriber/article/opr/t118/e276. Lorenzo's workshop continued to flourish for over a century. Even now, art historians believe that many of his most significant works have yet to be identified.

On November 3, 2007, the Navy Midshipmen defeated the Notre Dame Fighting Irish 46‚Äì44 in triple-overtime at Notre Dame's home field, Notre Dame Stadium in South Bend, Indiana. Notre Dame came into this annual game with 43 straight wins against Navy since the last loss against Heisman Trophy winner Roger Staubach in 1963. With the win, Navy improved to 5‚Äì4 and Notre Dame fell to 1‚Äì8 on the season. Leading into the game The Navy‚ÄìNotre Dame football rivalry is the longest running college football series between two teams not in the same conference. The 2007 Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team began the season with a 33‚Äì3 loss to Georgia Tech. It was the most lopsided loss Notre Dame had ever suffered in a season-opening game. Notre Dame then lost to Penn State, Michigan (tying Notre Dame's worst-ever loss at 38‚Äì0), Michigan State, and Purdue It was the first time in school history for Notre Dame to open the season with five losses. Notre Dame's worst opening before 2007 was 0‚Äì3. The Fighting Irish snapped their losing streak with a win at UCLA but then lost to Boston College and USC to fall to 1‚Äì7. With only four regular season games remaining, Notre Dame was assured of a losing season and they were out of contention for a bowl game. The 2007 Navy Midshipmen football team was off to a better start. They had achieved victories against Temple, Duke, Air Force, and Pittsburgh. Losses against Rutgers, Ball State, Wake Forest, and Delaware put them 4‚Äì4 on the season. With four games remaining in the season, Navy needed to win at least two in order to be invited to a bowl game. The Poinsettia Bowl had arranged for the Midshipmen to play in that bowl if they reached six wins. At the time, both teams played NCAA Division I FBS football as independent teams, unaffiliated with any conference. The game was televised nationally by NBC, which has the exclusive TV broadcast rights to Notre Dame home games. Game summary Notre Dame made the first score of the game, a 3-yard touchdown run by Robert Hughes. It was the only score of the first quarter. Each team scored a pair of touchdowns in the second quarter, to give the Irish a 21‚Äì14 lead at halftime. Navy scored a touchdown in the third quarter but they missed the potential game-tying extra point. It was the only score of the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, Navy's Chris Kuhar-Pitters collected a fumble at the Notre Dame 16 yard line and ran it in for a touchdown. Kaipo-Noa Kaheaku-Enhada rushed for the two-point conversion to take a 28‚Äì21 lead ‚Äì their first of the game. Notre Dame tied the score with a touchdown. The game eventually went to overtime, with the aid of a questionable decision from Irish head coach Charlie Weis: With 45 seconds left in regulation, Notre Dame faced a fourth-and-8 on the Navy 24; instead of attempting a 41-yard field goal that could have won the game, Weis opted to go for the first down. The gamble backfired in spectacular fashion when Navy sacked quarterback Evan Sharpley, with Midshipmen linebacker Ram Vela literally leaping over a blocker to assist in the sack. In the first overtime, Notre Dame won the coin toss and elected to go on defense. Navy scored a touchdown and their extra point was good. The Irish replied with a touchdown and extra point to bring up the second overtime. This time, each team scored a field goal, necessitating a third overtime. NCAA rules stipulate that, beginning with the third overtime, teams may not kick an extra point after making a touchdown; instead, they must go for a two-point conversion. Navy went to the air; Reggie Campbell caught a 25-yard pass from Kaheaku-Enhada on their first play from scrimmage. Kaheaku-Enhada threw again to Campbell for the successful two-point conversion. Notre Dame also scored a touchdown on their possession. Their first attempt at the conversion ended in an incomplete pass, but Navy was called for pass interference on the play. The Irish got a second chance at the conversion, this time from the -yard line instead of the 3. They opted for a running play, but Navy stuffed the attempt at the line of scrimmage. That gave Navy the 46‚Äì44 win. Analysis The game ended the longest streak for most consecutive wins by one team over another in college football. Prior to the game, Notre Dame had achieved 43 straight wins against Navy since the last loss in 1963, when Roger Staubach was quarterback for Navy. The game was the fifth straight home loss for the Irish, establishing a new school record. After the game, Notre Dame coach Charlie Weis was asked whether the game, following Notre Dame's 38‚Äì0 loss to USC, was a low point for the Fighting Irish. He said, \\"A low point is when you get beat 38‚Äì0. That's a low point. A low point is when the game is going OK and one team is pulling away from you and making plays when you're not making plays. The low point for me is we didn't win the game.\\" Navy coach Paul Johnson said, \\"It's a big win for our program. It's a big win for the academy. I'm happy I don't have to answer anything else about the streak every time we play.\\" Weis, on the other- hand, was not bothered by being the coach of the team that allowed Navy to end the streak. He said the 43-year winning streak had no meaning to him or his team. ESPN reported, \\"For Notre Dame, it was its school-record fifth straight home loss, another low point in a season of lows.\\" With this streak broken, the Kentucky Wildcats held the two longest active losing streaks to an annual opponent in Division I FBS. Their streak of 22 losses to Tennessee at that time reached 26 before the Wildcats ended that streak on November 26, 2011. The Wildcats' losing streak against Florida, which was 20 at the end of the 2006 season and 21 by the time of this Navy‚ÄìNotre Dame game, ended in 2018 at 31 games. Temple had a 31-game losing streak to Penn State in a series played discontinuously since 1941, though it ended in 2015.

Harrison wrote the song during a period when he had become uninterested in contemporary music and was enjoying success as a film producer with his company HandMade Films. Partly influenced by his extended holidays in Hawaii and Australia, the lyrics convey his dismay at the world's preoccupation with money and status, although, unlike several of Harrison's previous musical statements on the subject, he expresses resignation and acceptance. Harrison recorded the song at his Friar Park studio in 1982. The track includes contributions from British musicians such as Henry Spinetti, Herbie Flowers and Ray Cooper, along with a deep-toned vocal part from American gospel singer Willie Greene. Indicating Harrison's enduring admiration for the song, it was one of the B-sides of the 12-inch single \\"When We Was Fab\\" in 1988, and he subsequently included it on his compilation album Best of Dark Horse 1976‚Äì1989. Among retrospective appraisals of Harrison's musical career, several commentators have identified \\"That's the Way It Goes\\" as a highlight of Gone Troppo. In November 2002, a year after Harrison's death, Joe Brown performed the song at the Concert for George in London. Its inclusion marked a rare example of a post-1973 Harrison song being performed at that tribute concert. Background and inspiration George Harrison wrote \\"That's the Way It Goes\\" and other songs for his Gone Troppo album during a period when his interest in contemporary popular music had diminishedHarrison, p. 344.Dave Thompson, \\"The Music of George Harrison: An album-by-album guide\\", Goldmine, 25 January 2002, p. 53. in favour of a part- time career as a film producer, with the success of his company HandMade Films.Clayson, p. 387.Larkin, p. 2647. In a television interview to promote HandMade's Time Bandits in December 1981, Harrison described himself as an \\"ex-pop star\\" and a \\"peace-seeker, gardener, ex-celeb\\".Harry, p. 193. The songs he wrote for the album reflected his time spent holidaying in AustraliaMadinger & Easter p 462. and in Hawaii,Harry, p. 225. where he owned a property near Hana on the island of Maui.Tillery, p. 127. In his book on Harrison for the Praeger Singer-Songwriter series, Ian Inglis groups \\"That's the Way It Goes\\" with the title track to Gone Troppo and \\"Mystical One\\" as songs that offer \\"a clear insight into his frame of mind\\" at this time.Inglis, p. 82. Inglis continues: > Here is a man who has lived through the extravagances of the 1960s, received > global acclaim for the humanitarian and spiritual facets of his music, > experienced the darker side of popular music's excesses, seen the murder of > one of his closest friends [John Lennon], and has now settled on a life away > from the constant spotlight of public scrutiny. Composition Harrison biographer Simon Leng considers \\"That's the Way It Goes\\" to be a social commentary that conveys the artist's withdrawal from the \\"money madness of the '80s\\" as typified by the anti-societal policies of British prime minister Margaret Thatcher. The song's title is a phrase typically used in British English to convey resignation at an unfortunate or unjust situation.Leng, pp. 230‚Äì31. The composition consists of four verses in which Harrison laments the world's preoccupation with money and status. After each verse, the line \\"And that's the way it goes\\" is followed by an instrumental break in which Harrison's slide guitar further voices his reluctant acceptance.Inglis, p. 80. Hana, Hawaii. Harrison drew part of his inspiration for the song from the tranquility he experienced at Hana, on the island of Maui, together with Hawaiian music. The first three verses of the song depict a different character, each seemingly at a spiritual malaise in their attempts to attain wealth or advance their position. In the opening verse, Harrison sings of a man preoccupied with his financial losses on the stock market.Allison, p. 117. The next character is a speculator who intends to purchase \\"the promised land\\" with his South African Krugerrand, and then develop and sell it on for a profit. In the third verse, a film actor aspires to achieve stardom in the form of \\"a shining city on a hill\\", yet the starring roles he seeks merely bury his sense of individuality. According to theologian Dale Allison, the lyrics suggest that Harrison pities the first of these three individuals yet has only contempt for the speculator. In the final verse, Harrison sings of \\"a fire that burns away the lies\\" and is \\"manifested in the spiritual eye\\".Allison, p. 97. He adds that, by failing to perceive material things as secondary in importance to spiritual transcendence, people hide \\"all there is to know\\".Allison, pp. 117, 120. Unlike in his early-1970s songs \\"The Lord Loves the One (That Loves the Lord)\\", \\"Awaiting on You All\\" and \\"The Day the World Gets 'Round\\", Harrison refrains from trying to convert these people from their apparent misconception. Instead, he has resigned himself to being misunderstood and accepts that he cannot change their perspective. Allison likens this approach to the lyrical content of Harrison's 1980 composition \\"Save the World\\", whereby the singer, having expressed his concern for problems afflicting the material world, concludes with a message of \\"personal piety [that] is really a sign of surrender, the end of all political idealism\\".Allison, pp. 75‚Äì76. Leng writes that, in contrast to the mood of resignation in the lyrics, the musical aspects of \\"That's the Way It Goes\\" are \\"richly positive\\". These include the song's slide guitar solos, which, typically of Harrison's playing on Gone Troppo,Leng, pp. 231, 232. reflect his absorption in Pacific musical cultures, particularly Hawaiian music.Clayson, p. 391. Leng highlights the solos for their variety in musical style and nuance, citing a country influence in Harrison's second break and, later in the song, \\"obvious inflections from Indian music\\" through Harrison's incorporation of gamak. Recording Having spent the New Year on Hamilton IslandTillery, p. 128. in Australia,Huntley, p. 184. Harrison and his family continued to travel for much of early 1982, including making a visit to Los Angeles where he received an award from UNICEF in recognition of his 1971 benefit concert for the fledgling nation of Bangladesh.Badman, pp. 291, 296.Harry, p. 87. Harrison then recorded the track at his Friar Park studio, FPSHOT, in Oxfordshire,Leng, pp. 229‚Äì30. during sessions held between 5 May and 27 August 1982.Badman, p. 300. Authors Chip Madinger and Mark Easter write that Harrison set out to make \\"a friendly, buoyant album, even a commercial one at times\\", possibly in reaction to Warner Bros. Records' initial rejection of his previous album, Somewhere in England. Aside from Harrison, the musicians playing on \\"That's the Way It Goes\\" were Mike Moran (on keyboards), Ray Cooper (percussion), Herbie Flowers (bass) and Henry Spinetti (drums). According to Leng, the line-up of mainly English musicians on Gone Troppo was further evidence of Harrison's limited interest in music during this period, with many of the new acquaintances having come through Cooper,Leng, p. 229. who also had an executive role at HandMade.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 204.Simmons, p. 84. Harrison's musical contributions to the recording included all the guitar parts on the song, as well as synthesizer. Leng describes the musical arrangement as typical of Harrison's work at the time: \\"layers of acoustic guitars topped by picking light electrics, understated keyboards, and lots of slide riffs\\". In addition, the track includes occasional vocal interjections (credited as \\"bass voice\\") performed by Willie Greene, a gospel bass singer whom Harrison recruited from slide guitarist Ry Cooder's touring band.Leng, pp. 231, 237. Release and reception Warner Bros. Records issued Gone Troppo on Harrison's Dark Horse label on 5 November 1982.Madinger & Easter, p. 636. \\"That's the Way It Goes\\" was sequenced as the second track, between the album's lead single, \\"Wake Up My Love\\", and Harrison's cover of \\"I Really Love You\\", a 1961 hit for the Stereos.Lindsay Planer, \\"George Harrison 'I Really Love You'\\", AllMusic (retrieved 16 November 2016). The album was little noticed at the time,Clayson, p. 392. due to Harrison's refusal to promote the release and Warner's similarly carrying out minimal promotion.Huntley, p. 187.Doggett, p. 280. Gone Troppo became Harrison's last album for five years,The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 48. during which he continued to focus on film production,Tillery, pp. 128, 130‚Äì31.Simmons, p. 85. while making occasional musical contributions to film soundtracks.Leng, pp. 239‚Äì41, 243.Inglis, pp. 84‚Äì86. In preparation for the release of his 1987 comeback album, Cloud Nine, Harrison remixed the song for inclusion on the European CD and 12-inch vinyl formats of his \\"When We Was Fab\\" single,Madinger & Easter, pp. 463, 632. released in January 1988.Badman, p. 402. For this new mix, Harrison and Jeff Lynne increased the presence of the drums and added snapback echo on the lead vocal. Madinger and Easter view Harrison's choosing to return to the track, five years after its recording, as evidence that he \\"rather cherished\\" the song. In another indication of his personal preferences,Huntley, p. 224.Madinger & Easter, p. 477. \\"That's the Way It Goes\\" appeared on the 1989 compilation album Best of Dark Horse.Inglis, pp. 129, 153. The 1982 mix was used for this release.Madinger & Easter, p. 463. \\"That's the Way It Goes\\" was among the 35 songs that Harrison shortlisted to play on his 1991 Japanese tour with Eric Clapton,Madinger & Easter, p. 482. which was Harrison's first concert tour since 1974.The Editors of Rolling Stone, pp. 48, 191. Harrison, Clapton and the latter's band rehearsed the song at Bray Studios in Berkshire,Badman, p. 469. but it was not performed at any of the subsequent shows.Madinger & Easter, pp. 481, 482. Retrospective assessment and legacy Writing shortly after Harrison's death in November 2001, music journalist Rip Rense cited the track as evidence that \\"All his albums, even the rather hasty 'Extra Texture,' and the post-scripty 'Gone Troppo,' contain some of the most affecting moments in his career.\\"Rip Rense, \\"There Went the Sun: Reflection on the Passing of George Harrison\\", Beatlefan, 29 January 2002 (retrieved 16 November 2016). Reviewing Harrison's solo releases in 2004, for Blender magazine, Paul Du Noyer considered the song to be the album's \\"standout track\\".Paul Du Noyer, \\"Back Catalogue: George Harrison\\", Blender, April 2004, pp. 152‚Äì53. Among reviews of the Dark Horse Years Harrison reissues that same year, Kit Aiken of Uncut described Gone Troppo as a \\"return to form of sorts\\" after Somewhere in England and viewed the song as \\"the sort of strumalong fatalistic shrug George had made his own\\".Kit Aiken, \\"All Those Years Ago: George Harrison The Dark Horse Years 1976‚Äì1992\\", Uncut, April 2004, p. 118. Conversely, Music Box editor John Metzger dismissed Gone Troppo as \\"undoubtedly the worst of George Harrison's solo albums\\", although he considered \\"That's the Way It Goes\\" to be one of the few tracks that might have succeeded with a less-polished musical arrangement.John Metzger, \\"George Harrison The Dark Horse Years (Part Four: Gone Troppo)\\", The Music Box, vol. 11 (5), May 2004 (retrieved 16 November 2016). Nick DeRiso of the music website Something Else! admires the song as \\"a potent rumination\\" on slide guitar. He adds that Harrison's mood of acceptance in the lyrics marks \\"a remarkable departure for a performer best known for a determined kind of proselytizing\\" through songs such as \\"Awaiting on You All\\", \\"Living in the Material World\\" and \\"That Which I Have Lost\\".Nick DeRiso, \\"On Second Thought: George Harrison ‚Äì Gone Troppo (1982)\\", Something Else!, 22 October 2013 (retrieved 16 November 2016). Simon Leng rates \\"That's the Way It Goes\\" as \\"the highlight of the LP\\".Leng, p. 230. Amid his praise for Harrison's guitar solos on the track, Lengs concludes: > Ironically, it was Ry Cooder who underlined the obvious proximity between > Harrison's slide sound and Indian phrasing. If there's one instrumental > album that George Harrison may have dreamed of recording, it is probably > Cooder's Meeting by the River, a collaboration with Indian slide maestro > V.M. Bhatt ‚Ä¶ That was a 1993 disc ‚Äì with \\"That's the Way It Goes,\\" Harrison > had shown that he was the true pioneer of honestly incorporating Indian > music into Western rock.Leng, p. 231. Ian Inglis includes \\"That's the Way It Goes\\" among Harrison's \\"often overlooked\\" songs that possess \\"great charm, energy, and beauty\\".Inglis, p. 141. Concert for George performance Joe Brown (pictured in 2010) performed the song at the Harrison tribute concert in November 2002. \\"That's the Way It Goes\\" was the only song from Harrison's post-1973 releases to be played at the Concert for George tribute, where it was performed by English singer Joe Brown, a near-neighbour of Harrison's in Henley-on-Thames since the 1980s.Clayson, p. 390. The concert was organised by Clapton and took place at London's Royal Albert Hall on 29 November 2002, exactly a year after Harrison's death.Leng, p. 309. Brown played mandolin on the song and was backed by musicians including Andy Fairweather-Low (on slide guitar) and Phil Capaldi (drums).Concert for George DVD booklet (Warner Vision, 2003; directed by David Leland; produced by Ray Cooper, Olivia Harrison, Jon Kamen & Brian Roylance), p. 28. Brown's performance of \\"That's the Way It Goes\\" was omitted from the theatrical release of David Leland's documentary Concert for George in 2003, but included on the two-disc DVD, issued in November that year.William Ruhlmann, Various Artists A Concert for George (Video)\\", AllMusic (retrieved 16 November 2016). Inglis comments that his \\"informal sing-along style\\" was a good match for the song's \\"casual tone and relaxed outlook\\";Inglis, p. 125. Allison similarly considers that Brown \\"reprised [the song] wonderfully\\".Allison, p. 157. In addition to playing \\"Here Comes the Sun\\",Jon Kanis, \\"I'll See You in My Dreams: Looking Back at the Concert for George\\", San Diego Troubadour, December 2012 (retrieved 16 November 2016). Brown also performed the concert's closing song, \\"I'll See You in My Dreams\\".Paul Du Noyer, \\"Review: Various Artists Concert For George\\", The Word, January 2004 (retrieved 16 November 2016). For the latter, Brown played a ukulele,Inglis, p. 127. a Hawaiian instrument with which Harrison was strongly associated from the 1980s onwards.Clayson, pp. 436, 447.Leng, p. 302.

It is currently headquartered in Fort Worth, Texas.APHA Contact Information accessed on October 31, 2007 It was founded in 1965 with the merging of two different color breed registries that had been formed to register pinto-colored horses of Quarter Horse bloodlines. One of these organizations was the American Paint Quarter Horse Association (or APQHA) and the other was the American Paint Stock Horse Association (or APSHA). History The APQHA was formed in 1961 in Abilene, Texas, mainly to register cropout horses from the matings of registered Quarter Horses. They also allowed the registering of non-cropouts (\\"solids\\") who had Quarter Horse conformation and bloodlines.Oelke The Paint Horse p. 33 The APSHA was formed in February 1962. The APSHA registration rules differed from APQHA in that they excluded gaited horses and mandated that horses that were mainly dark colored must have a minimum of three white spots three inches wide on their body, and that mostly white horses must have a dark spot at least six inches wide on their body.Haynes The American Paint Horse p. 45-46 Both registries agreed to merge in 1965, although the APHA calls the APSHA its forerunner.Oelke The Paint Horse p. 36 Coloration The need for these registries arose because, in the days prior to DNA parentage testing, the American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) would not register horses with excessive white markings, sometimes called \\"cropouts\\", thinking that such markings were a sign of non-purebred breeding and was maintained for several decades because it was also feared that excess white increased the risk of horses producing a foal with lethal white syndrome (LWS). This policy was known as the \\"white rule.\\" (The AQHA also would not register Appaloosa, cremello or perlino horses for similar reasons.) This policy arose in part from long observation of the tobiano spotting pattern, which is a dominant gene, and was known to not occur unless one parent is tobiano, a color not recognized in the foundation breeds, such as the Thoroughbred, that were the predecessors of the American Quarter Horse. What was not understood then is that the overo pattern, found in the Spanish mustang ancestors of the Quarter horse, and sabino pattern, which exists in the Arabian and Thoroughbred, occur as either a gene complex or a recessive gene; thus two solid-colored horses could produce a spotted foal if both were carriers. It is also known now that lethal white is a recessive, and even two solid-colored horses can carry the LWS gene. Since the advent of DNA parentage testing and a test for LWS has also been developed, the AQHA has repealed its \\"white rule\\" and there are now Paint horses of verifiable Quarter Horse bloodlines that are cross-registered with both the APHA and the AQHA. The APHA currently registers horses that exhibit the overo (which, under APHA categories, includes sabino), tobiano, and tovero spotting patterns, as well as solid colored horses with Paint bloodlines. It also keeps track of each horse's performance and progeny record. It allows registration of Paint to Paint breedings, as well as Paint to Quarter Horse and Paint to Thoroughbred. They allow live cover, artificial insemination, shipped cooled semen, frozen semen and embryo transfers.APHA Breeding Guide PDF accessed on October 31, 2007 Programs The APHA sanctions horse shows and holds an annual Youth World Championship Paint Horse Show in the early summer, and an annual Open and Amateur World Championship Paint Horse Show every November.APHA Events accessed on October 31, 2007 They also offer racingPaint Racing accessed on February 15, 2013 and added money to Paint horses competing in open shows held by the National Snaffle Bit Association and the National Reining Horse Association.APHA Paint Preferred Program accessed on October 31, 2007 The APHA also has programs such as PAC which is an open show program, in which Paint Horses are rewarded for their performance in other events such as show jumping which is not always included in the APHA hosted shows. They also have a trail program which records and rewards Paint horses and their owners for time spent in saddle pleasure riding or trail riding.

Harrison wrote the song following his temporary departure from the Beatles in January 1969, during the troubled Get Back sessions that resulted in their Let It Be album and film. The lyrics reflect his frustration with the atmosphere in the group at that time ‚Äì namely, Paul McCartney's over-assertiveness and criticism of his guitar playing, John Lennon's lack of engagement with the project and dismissal of Harrison as a songwriter, and Yoko Ono's constant involvement in the band's activities. Music critics and biographers recognise the song as Harrison's statement of personal and artistic freedom from the Beatles. Its creation contrasted sharply with his rewarding collaborations outside the group in the months before the Get Back project, particularly with Bob Dylan and the Band in upstate New York. Recorded shortly after the Beatles' break-up in 1970, \\"Wah-Wah\\" was the first track taped for All Things Must Pass. The recording features a dense production treatment from Phil Spector and backing from a large cast of musicians including Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr, Billy Preston, Bobby Keys and the band Badfinger. On release, Rolling Stone magazine described it as \\"a grand cacophony of sound in which horns sound like guitars and vice versa\\". While several reviewers find the heavy production appropriate for the song, Harrison considered the recording overproduced and the sound too cluttered. \\"Wah-Wah\\" was the first song Harrison played live as a solo artist when he performed it as his opener for the Western-music portion of the Concert for Bangladesh, in August 1971. Viewed by some commentators as superior to the studio recording, this version re-created Spector's Wall of Sound treatment in a live setting, using many of the participants from the 1970 album sessions. At the Concert for George in November 2002, a year after Harrison's death, \\"Wah-Wah\\" was performed by an all-star band that included Clapton, Jeff Lynne, Starr and McCartney. Ocean Colour Scene, Buffalo Tom, Beck and the Tedeschi Trucks Band are among the other artists who have covered the song. Background =October‚ÄìDecember 1968 US visit= When discussing the song \\"Wah-Wah\\" and George Harrison's temporary departure from the Beatles in January 1969, several commentators note the importance of his recent two- month visit to America, which followed the completion of the band's 1968 double album The Beatles, commonly known as the White Album.Leng, pp. 39‚Äì40, 55.Clayson, pp. 259‚Äì60. In Los Angeles, where he was producing a Jackie Lomax solo album for the Beatles' Apple record label, Harrison directed top session players such as Hal Blaine and Larry Knechtel,Miles, p. 313. and met two American musicians with whom he would soon collaborate in London, Delaney Bramlett and Leon Russell.Leng, pp. 62‚Äì63. Later in the US trip, Harrison stayed in upstate New York, where he established a musical bond with Bob Dylan and thrived among what author Simon Leng calls the \\"group ethic and camaraderie\\" of the Band.Leng, pp. 51‚Äì53. Throughout this period, Harrison continued to bloom as a songwriter, having contributed four songs to The Beatles that, in the words of author Nicholas Schaffner, \\"firmly established him as a contender\\" beside bandmates John Lennon and Paul McCartney.Schaffner, p. 115. In addition, he had recently co-written Cream's single \\"Badge\\" with Eric Clapton,The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 176. as well as collaborating with Dylan in Bearsville.Leng, pp. 37‚Äì39, 51‚Äì54. =January 1969 at Twickenham Film Studios= Part of Twickenham Film Studios, in south-west London Harrison later recalled his two months in the United States as having been \\"such a good time\\", yet \\"the moment I got back with the Beatles [for their Get Back film project], it was just too difficult\\".Mitchell Glazer, \\"Interview with George Harrison\\", Crawdaddy, February 1977, p. 37.Huntley, p. 18. These difficulties included having to endure McCartney's habit of dictating how the others should play their instrumentsMacDonald, pp. 288‚Äì89.Clayson, p. 261. and Lennon's increasing withdrawal from the band and emotional dependence on his ever- present partner, Yoko Ono.MacDonald, p. 301.Hertsgaard, pp. 250‚Äì51, 267.Martin O'Gorman, \\"Film on Four\\", in Mojo Special Limited Edition: 1000 Days of Revolution, p. 70. The couple had recently descended into heroin addiction,MacDonald, p. 246.Sulpy & Schweighardt, pp. 1‚Äì2.Hertsgaard, pp. 251, 257. leaving Lennon, in author Peter Doggett's words, \\"emotionally removed and artistically bankrupt\\".Peter Doggett, \\"Fight to the Finish\\", in Mojo Special Limited Edition: 1000 Days of Revolution, p. 138. In their study of the Get Back project, Doug Sulpy and Ray Schweighardt write that, as another frustration for Harrison, Lennon and McCartney regularly overlooked his compositions, even when they were \\"far better than their own\\".Sulpy & Schweighardt, p. 1. On 6 January 1969, the band's third day at Twickenham Film Studios, in south-west London,Miles, pp. 327‚Äì28. an argument was captured on film where McCartney criticised Harrison's guitar playing on the song \\"Two of Us\\".Sulpy & Schweighardt, p. 51. A resigned Harrison told him: \\"I'll play ... whatever you want me to play, or I won't play at all if you don't want me to play. Whatever it is that will please you, I'll do it.\\"Miles, p. 328.Hertsgaard, p. 267. With the sessions being recorded by film director Michael Lindsay-Hogg,Martin O'Gorman, \\"Film on Four\\", in Mojo Special Limited Edition: 1000 Days of Revolution, pp. 70‚Äì71. tapes reveal Beatles associates Neil Aspinall and George Martin sympathising with Harrison's position,Huntley, p. 22. recognising that McCartney and Lennon \\"don't offer him enough freedom within their compositions\\".Sulpy & Schweighardt, p. 173. Ringo Starr, who had quit the band briefly during the White Album sessions, partly as a result of McCartney's hectoring of his drumming,Hertsgaard, pp. 250‚Äì51. recalled of Harrison's refusal to be \\"dominated\\" by McCartney any longer: \\"Paul [typically] wanted to point out the solo to George, who would say, 'Look, I'm a guitarist. I'll play the solo.' And he always did, he always played fine solos.\\"Ringo Starr, in The Beatles, p. 316. Over the first three days at Twickenham, Harrison had presented new compositions such as \\"All Things Must Pass\\", \\"Let It Down\\" and \\"Hear Me Lord\\" for consideration;Spizer, pp. 212, 220, 223. these and other \\"numerous beautiful songs\\", music journalist Martin O'Gorman writes, \\"received derision and disinterest from Lennon or heavy- handed interference from McCartney\\".Martin O'Gorman, \\"Film on Four\\", in Mojo Special Limited Edition: 1000 Days of Revolution, p. 73. On 8 January, Harrison debuted \\"I Me Mine\\", a song inspired by the bickering and negativity within the band.Greene, p. 115. It was met with ridicule by LennonHuntley, p. 21. and an argument ensued between the two musicians, during which Lennon dismissed Harrison's abilities as a songwriter. According to Sulpy and Schweighardt, Lennon's resentment was most likely a reaction to Harrison's productivity throughout the sessions, since he himself was \\"unable to write a decent new song\\".Sulpy & Schweighardt, p. 170. In addition, Harrison had been alone in voicing his objections to Ono's presence,Huntley, p. 24. telling the couple how, in Lennon's later recollection, \\"Dylan and a few people said she's got a lousy name in New York\\".Andrew Grant Jackson, \\"Book Excerpt: George Harrison Realizes It's Time to Move On From the Beatles\\", rollingstone.com, 17 August 2012 (retrieved 29 January 2015).Martin O'Gorman, \\"Film on Four\\", in Mojo Special Limited Edition: 1000 Days of Revolution, p. 72. Over lunch on Friday, 10 January,Winn, p. 246. a more severe argument took place in which Harrison berated Lennon for contributing nothing positive to the rehearsals. Harrison walked out of the Beatles, saying that the others should advertise in the NME for his replacement.Sulpy & Schweighardt, pp. 167, 169‚Äì70. He then drove to his home, Kinfauns, in Surrey, and wrote \\"Wah-Wah\\" that same afternoon.George Harrison, p. 194.Clayson, p. 262. Despite the animosity between himself and Lennon on the day he quit the group,Sulpy & Schweighardt, pp. 169‚Äì70.Huntley, p. 25. Harrison later confirmed a suggestion made by music journalist Timothy White that, just like Lennon's \\"How Do You Sleep?\\" and \\"Crippled Inside\\", the song was a \\"swipe\\" at McCartney. =Harrison's return to the Beatles= Harrison's diary records that Lennon and Ono \\"diverted\\" him at home over breakfast the following morning,Dhani Harrison, in George Harrison: Living in the Material World, Disc 2; event occurs between 2:52 and 2:58.Olivia Harrison, pp. 192‚Äì93. but even after a subsequent band meeting at Starr's house, author Barry Miles writes, their \\"feud\\" remained \\"intractable\\".Miles, p. 329. At the meeting, much to Harrison's annoyance, Lennon once more chose to have Ono speak on his behalf.Jim Irvin, \\"Close to the Edge\\", Mojo, December 2003, p. 82. Harrison then went to his parents' home in Warrington for a few days before imposing terms for his return to the bandRodriguez, p. 381. ‚Äì namely, that McCartney's plans for a live concert be abandoned and the project be relocated to the Beatles' own Apple Studio, at London's Savile Row.Miles, pp. 330, 331. Commentators have remarked on a change in Harrison's standing within the band as a result of his walkout,Clayson, pp. 254, 262.Greene, pp. 116‚Äì17. and later in 1969, Lennon and McCartney would be speaking admiringly of Harrison's growth as a songwriter.Mark Lewisohn, \\"Something Else\\", in Mojo Special Limited Edition: 1000 Days of Revolution, p. 118.Fawcett, p. 96. In an article for Mojo magazine's July 2001 \\"Solo Beatles Special\\", John Harris wrote that although Harrison \\"nominally\\" remained a Beatle, he was \\"serving out his notice\\" after 10 January 1969.Harris, p. 68. Composition In his autobiography, I, Me, Mine, Harrison explains that the song title was a reference to \\"a 'headache' as well as a footpedal\\", the wah-wah pedal being a guitar effect that he favoured for much of the early Get Back sessions.Sulpy & Schweighardt, pp. 63‚Äì64, 77.Winn, p. 250. The message of the song, according to Harrison, was: \\"you're giving me a bloody headache.\\"Huntley, p. 55. Leng identifies \\"Wah-Wah\\" as being directed at the \\"artifice\\" and \\"pretense\\" surrounding the Beatles.Leng, p. 86. The song is based around an electric guitar riff that Leng describes as \\"snarling\\". Written in the key of E, the tune incorporates chord changes that musicologist Wilfrid Mellers once admired as \\"audacious\\";Mellers, p. 147. musically, Harrison biographer Elliot Huntley suggests, the composition mirrors the \\"intense atmosphere\\" at Twickenham in January 1969.Huntley, p. 54. Referring to the released recording, author Ian Inglis views \\"Wah-Wah\\" as a hard rock song where the \\"forceful rhythm\\" conveys \\"the momentum of [Harrison's] anger\\". Like \\"Run of the Mill\\", which Harrison also wrote in early 1969, the lyrics touch on the failure of friendships within the band,Doggett, p. 141. which in the case of Harrison, McCartney and Lennon dated back to school years.Leng, p. 94.\\"George Harrison ‚Äì In His Own Words\\", superseventies.com (retrieved 3 October 2012). Harrison later spoke of their familiarity with one another resulting in McCartney, especially, failing to recognise his artistic growth;Doggett, p. 134. in I, Me, Mine, he refers to \\"Wah-Wah\\" as reflecting \\"that concept of how everybody sees and treats everybody else, allowing no consideration for the fact that we are changing all the time\\". The second verse reflects Harrison's frustration at being viewed by Lennon and McCartney as subservient to their ambitions, just as his 1968 composition \\"Not Guilty\\" had found Harrison defending himself for supposedly leading his fellow Beatles \\"astray\\" to the Maharishi's meditation retreat in India.Huntley, p. 165.Leng, pp. 33, 38. In \\"Wah-Wah\\", he states sarcastically: Over the song's two middle eights, Harrison laments that his bandmates never take the time to notice his sorrow or \\"hear me sighing\\".Inglis, p. 25. Harrison's Surrey home, Kinfauns, where he wrote \\"Wah- Wah\\" immediately after leaving the Beatles Religious academic Joshua Greene has written of Harrison being \\"too sure of his life's higher purpose\\" by January 1969, through his dedication to Hindu spirituality, to continue devoting time to the group's \\"petty squabbles\\".Greene, p. 116. In the song's final verse, Harrison provides what AllMusic critic Bill Janovitz terms a \\"simple, spiritual sentiment\\", which serves as a statement of his independence from the Beatles:Spizer, p. 222. \\"Wah-Wah\\" was never offered to the Beatles once Harrison joined the proceedings at Apple Studio.Sulpy & Schweighardt, pp. 331‚Äì32. The choice of Harrison songs that would end up on the Let It Be album in May 1970 ‚Äì \\"I Me Mine\\" and \\"For You Blue\\" ‚Äì has led some authors to speculate that he deliberately withdrew his higher-quality compositions rather than risk having them played without the attention they deserved.Huntley, p. 27. Leng lists \\"Wah-Wah\\" among a number of solo Beatles songs that are \\"self- referential\\" in their lyrical theme and serve as episodes in what he calls \\"the Beatles soap opera\\".Leng, p. 85. Harrison's bitterness at the restrictions imposed on him during the Beatles years resurfaced explicitly in \\"Who Can See It\\", a song written in 1972.Leng, pp. 129‚Äì30.Rodriguez, p. 156. Recording McCartney's refusal to have the release of his eponymous first solo album delayed until after Let It Be led to him announcing his departure from the band on 9 April 1970,Hertsgaard, p. 285.Doggett, pp. 121‚Äì26. and to Harrison finally deciding to make an album of his many unused songs from the Beatles' later years.O'Dell, pp. 155‚Äì56. He subsequently described the process of recording his songs with outside musicians as \\"a breath of fresh air\\".Spizer, p. 220. Shortly before starting work on the album, Harrison gave a radio interview to Village Voice reporter Howard Smith,Badman, p. 6. and explained that, although he had some ideological differences with Lennon, his objection to any possible Beatles reunion was based solely on his musical differences with McCartney.\\"It's Really a Pity\\", Contra Band Music, 15 March 2012 (retrieved 4 October 2012).Doggett, pp. 133‚Äì34. Delaney and Bonnie Bramlett, whose soul revue influenced the sound on \\"Wah-Wah\\", after Harrison had toured with them in December 1969 In the same 1970 radio interview, Harrison announced that he would be co-producing the album with Phil Spector, whose work on the Let It Be album had recently enraged McCartney.Schaffner, p. 138.Doggett, pp. 130‚Äì31. \\"Wah-Wah\\" was the first song taped for All Things Must Pass,Madinger & Easter, p. 428. recording for which began at Abbey Road Studios in late May that year.Badman, p. 10. In keeping with Spector's signature production style, a large group of musicians took part in the sessions.Schaffner, p. 142. According to Leng and author Bruce Spizer, the musicians on the track were: Harrison and Eric Clapton on electric guitars, three members of Badfinger on acoustic rhythm guitars, Billy Preston and Gary Wright on keyboards, the former Delaney & Bonnie horn section of Jim Price and Bobby Keys, bassist Klaus Voormann, Starr on drums, and Badfinger's Mike Gibbins playing tambourine. While Leng consulted Voormann, Badfinger's Joey Molland and orchestral arranger John Barham for his chapter discussing the recording of All Things Must Pass,Leng, pp. 79‚Äì81, 82fn. Bobby Whitlock, another former sideman with Delaney & Bonnie,Clayson, p. 288. has stated that he played electric piano on \\"Wah-Wah\\".Whitlock, pp. 76, 79.Nick DeRiso, \\"Gimme Five: Gary Wright, Robben Ford, Bobby Whitlock, Alan White, Joey Molland on George Harrison\\", Something Else!, 25 February 2014 (archived version retrieved 14 July 2016). Whitlock recalls that, having arrived at the session late due to traffic, and finding that the other musicians were all playing on the downbeat on the song, he was left to play alone in the obvious \\"open spot\\" ‚Äì on the upbeat.Whitlock, p. 76. Speaking in 2000 about this first session,All Things Must Pass (30th Anniversary Edition) EPK, Gnome Records/EMI, 2001. Harrison said that the music sounded \\"really nice\\" in the room, \\"with all these nice acoustics and piano, and no echo on anything\\", but he was shocked during the playback when he heard how Spector had recorded the track.George Harrison, in George Harrison: Living in the Material World, Disc 2; event occurs between 23:53 and 24:25. In Leng's words, Spector \\"[unleashed] his full armory of reverb-flooded production values\\" on \\"Wah-Wah\\". Harrison dismissed the result as \\"horrible\\", and recalled that when Clapton said he liked the way it sounded, he replied, \\"Well, you can have it on your album, then.\\" Although Harrison said \\"I grew to like it\\", he subsequently reverted to his original opinion that the song, like much of All Things Must Pass, was overproduced.The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 180. Overdubs on many of the album's basic tracks were carried out at either Abbey Road or Trident Studios, without Spector's assistance, and completed by 12 August.Madinger & Easter, p. 427. After receiving Harrison's initial mixes, Spector wrote back with suggestions for each song; in the case of \\"Wah-Wah\\", these included the addition of a saxophone solo by Keys, and backing vocals.\\"All Things Must Pass (album)\\", The Beatles Bible (retrieved 3 February 2015). As well as overdubbing his slide guitar solos, Harrison sang all the various vocal parts,Whitlock, p. 79. crediting himself as \\"the George O'Hara-Smith Singers\\" on the album sleeve.Castleman & Podrazik, p. 195. The recording begins with Harrison's guitar riff, which is then joined by Clapton's guitar, played through a wah- wah pedal. Leng suggests that the musical arrangement was influenced by the Delaney & Bonnie song \\"Comin' Home\\", following Clapton and Harrison's guest roles on the band's European tour in December 1969. \\"Wah-Wah\\" also features prominent percussion, including uncredited maracas and congas, and, in Leng's description, a \\"rollicking horn chart\\" from Price that helps define the middle-eight sections. Adding to the musical tension, Janovitz notes, Harrison sings high in his range throughout, \\"almost drowned out\\" by Spector's Wall of Sound, which sees keyboards, horns and the many guitar parts competing for space in the mix. The song fades out on the single-chord main riff, accompanied by the sound of a car engine changing gear.Clayson, p. 292. Release Apple Records issued All Things Must Pass on 27 November 1970Castleman & Podrazik, p. 94. with \\"Wah-Wah\\" sequenced as the third track, between \\"My Sweet Lord\\" and \\"Isn't It a Pity\\". Despite its unusually high retail price, as one of rock music's first studio triple LP sets,Schaffner, p. 140. the album was a significant commercial success worldwide,Rodriguez, pp. 5‚Äì6. and comfortably outperformed Lennon and McCartney's respective solo releases over 1970‚Äì71.Peter Doggett, \\"George Harrison: The Apple Years\\", Record Collector, April 2001, p. 37. Music journalist Anthony DeCurtis later wrote of the album representing \\"[the] bracing air of creative liberation\\" for Harrison. Like \\"Isn't It a Pity\\", the song \\"All Things Must Pass\\",Anthony DeCurtis, Rolling Stone, 12 October 2000 (retrieved 4 October 2012). and Barry Feinstein's cover photo of Harrison surrounded by four comical-looking garden gnomes,Harris, p. 73. \\"Wah-Wah\\" was recognised as a comment by Harrison on his Beatle past.Album review by Andrew Gilbert, in Robert Dimery, 1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die, Universe (New York, NY, 2005); quoted in The Super Seventies \\"Classic 500\\", George Harrison ‚Äì All Things Must Pass (retrieved 4 October 2012).The Editors of Rolling Stone, p. 40. In February 1971, he, Lennon and Starr united in the British high court to challenge McCartney's suit to dissolve the band's legal partnership,Huntley, pp. 65‚Äì66. all three of them submitting affidavits that mentioned their difficult experiences of working with him, particularly during the Get Back sessions.Badman, pp. 27‚Äì28, 31. In the context of this post-breakup unity, \\"Wah-Wah\\" was widely assumed to be directed at McCartney only,Neal Alpert, \\"George Harrison's Concert for Bangladesh\\", Gadfly Online, December 2001 (retrieved 5 October 2012). just as Harrison's walkout two years before was thought to have been due solely to McCartney. Reception and legacy In his book on the Beatles' first decade as solo artists, Robert Rodriguez includes \\"Wah-Wah\\" among the \\"essential components\\" of All Things Must Pass, and he recalls the \\"buzz\\" surrounding the release as having been \\"about a major talent unleashed, one who'd [previously] been hidden in plain sight\\" behind Lennon and McCartney.Rodriguez, pp. 147, 253. In a contemporary review for Rolling Stone, Ben Gerson suggested that the album was the rock-music equivalent of Tolstoy's epic novel War and Peace, while describing \\"Wah-Wah\\" as a \\"vintage Beatle song\\" and \\"a grand cacophony of sound in which horns sound like guitars and vice versa\\".Ben Gerson, \\"George Harrison All Things Must Pass\\", Rolling Stone, 21 January 1971, p. 46 (retrieved 4 February 2015). By contrast, Alan Smith of the NME found the dense sound oppressive and regarded the song as \\"inconsequential ‚Ä¶ one of the weaker tracks, although it's not short on dressing\\".Alan Smith, \\"George Harrison: All Things Must Pass (Apple)\\", NME, 5 December 1970, p. 2; available at Rock's Backpages (subscription required). AllMusic's Bill Janovitz sums up the track as \\"a glorious rocker ... [that's] as edgy as anything Harrison ever sang while in the Beatles, if not more so\\", and \\"a driving, majestic song on the edge of being out of control\\".Bill Janovitz, \\"George Harrison 'Wah-Wah'\\", AllMusic (retrieved 25 September 2012). John Bergstrom of PopMatters suggests that the best moments on All Things Must Pass \\"involve Harrison addressing his former band\\"; of these, the \\"raucous, killer jam\\" of \\"Wah-Wah\\" dismisses the Beatles' strife-filled final years as \\"so much white noise\\". While the song is \\"cutting\\", Bergstrom adds, \\"the sense of liberation is almost palpable.\\"John Bergstrom, \\"George Harrison: All Things Must Pass\\", PopMatters, 14 January 2011 (retrieved 4 February 2015). Writing for Rough Guides, Chris Ingham considers that without Spector's Wall of Sound excesses, All Things Must Pass \\"wouldn't be the magnificently overblown item that it is\\", and he writes of \\"the sheer size of the sound ‚Ä¶ threatening to trample both song and singer\\" in the case of \\"the thunderous Wah-Wah\\".Ingham, pp. 132‚Äì33. Former Mojo editor Paul Du Noyer describes the album as \\"Harrison's handful of earth upon the Beatle coffin\\", but, less impressed with the composition, he cites \\"Wah-Wah\\" as a rare example where \\"the material is probably too slight to carry the colossal weight of Spector's production\\".Paul Du Noyer, \\"George Harrison's All Things Must Pass\\" , pauldunoyer.com, 13 March 2009 (retrieved 29 January 2015). Among Harrison biographers, Simon Leng writes that the song \\"trashes the roseate memory of the Beatles\\". He concludes his discussion of this \\"unusually heavy chunk of rock\\" with the observation: \\"It's a song of anger and alienation, redolent of betrayal and hostility. To that extent, it's a good-time number to rival Delaney & Bonnie, with a heart of pure stone.\\"Leng, pp. 85‚Äì86. Noting the production's \\"layer upon layer of sonic bombast\\", Elliot Huntley states that \\"Spector fans must have been in seventh heaven\\" when they first heard \\"Wah-Wah\\". Huntley refers to it as \\"one of the outstanding tracks\\" of Harrison's career, and a welcome though rare \\"flat-out, kick-ass rocker\\" in the singer's canon. Still dissatisfied with Spector's \\"Cinemascope\\"-like production on \\"Wah-Wah\\", when All Things Must Pass was reissued in January 2001, Harrison admitted that he had been tempted to remix many of the tracks rather than simply remaster the album's original mixes.Huntley, pp. 305‚Äì06. In an interview with Guitar World magazine to promote the reissue, he also revealed that McCartney had \\"long since\\" apologised for his behaviour towards him during the Beatles years.Huntley, pp. 12, 23‚Äì24. In the 2000 book The Beatles Anthology, Harrison comments: \\"It's important to state that a lot of water has gone under the bridge ... But talking about what was happening at that time [with McCartney, Lennon and Ono], you can see it was strange.\\"George Harrison, in The Beatles, p. 316. Live version On 1 August 1971, Harrison performed \\"Wah-Wah\\" as the opening song for the rock-music portion of the two Concert for Bangladesh shows,Madinger & Easter, pp. 436‚Äì37. held at Madison Square Garden in New York.Badman, pp. 43‚Äì44. It was therefore the first song he ever played live as a solo artist and, given the humanitarian cause behind the event, Alan Clayson writes, the New York audience \\"loved him ... before he'd even plucked a string\\".Clayson, p. 312. The running order of the Concert for Bangladesh live album follows the setlist for the second show that day,Madinger & Easter, pp. 436‚Äì38. about which Joshua Greene remarks on the \\"logical chronology\\" in Harrison's three-song opening segment: \\"Wah-Wah\\" \\"declared his independence from the Beatles, followed by 'My Sweet Lord,' which declared his internal discovery of God and spirit, and then 'Awaiting on You All,' which projected his message to the world.\\"Greene, p. 190. Re- creating the Wall of Sound from All Things Must Pass,Schaffner, p. 147. Harrison was backed by a large band that again included Clapton, Starr, Preston, Voormann and Badfinger,Richard S. Ginell, \\"George Harrison The Concert for Bangladesh\\", AllMusic (retrieved 5 February 2015). together with musicians such as Leon Russell, saxophonist Jim Horn and drummer Jim Keltner,The Editors of Rolling Stone, pp. 42, 122. and a group of seven backing singers.Spizer, p. 241. The recording of \\"Wah-Wah\\" that appears on the live album was a composite of the audio from both the afternoon and evening showsSpizer, p. 242. ‚Äì one of the few examples of studio manipulation on an otherwise faithful record of the concert.Madinger & Easter, pp. 436, 438. Due to technical problems with the film footage, the \\"Wah-Wah\\" segment in Saul Swimmer's concert documentary was created through a series of edits and cuts between visuals from the first and second shows.George Harrison, pp. 60‚Äì61. Harrison's staging of the two benefit concerts enhanced his standing as the most popular of the former Beatles;Harris, pp. 73‚Äì74.Schaffner, pp. 147, 159. Doggett describes him as having become \\"arguably music's most influential figure\\" over this period.Doggett, p. 175. In a laudatory review of the Concert for Bangladesh album, for Rolling Stone,Spizer, p. 246.Huntley, pp. 80‚Äì81. Jon Landau described \\"Wah-Wah\\" as \\"a simple statement by a musician who knows who he is and what he wants to play\\".Jon Landau, \\"George Harrison, Concert for Bangla Desh\\", Rolling Stone, 3 February 1972 (retrieved 6 October 2012). Like Rodriguez, who considers that the song \\"truly [came] into its own\\" that day, Andrew Grant Jackson views this live reading as superior to the studio recording. He writes: \\"The live version is a notch slower, and the cleaner mix allows breathing room to hear the space between the instruments. And more importantly, there's the euphoria of the performance itself.\\" Cover versions On 29 November 2002, exactly a year after his death from cancer, \\"Wah-Wah\\" was the last Harrison composition performed at the Concert for George, held at London's Royal Albert Hall.Inglis, p. 127.

He was then exiled to Siberia. He is known for his paintings of the uprising and the Siberian katorga and exile. Biography Aleksander Sochaczewski was born Leib Sonder. His parents were Jews. In 1858, Sochaczewski entered the Warsaw Academy of Fine Arts to learn painting. Even while still a student he stood out as an exceptionally talented artist. In the early part of the 1860s, infused with the spirit of revolution that was set in motion by the movement for Polish independence from Russia, Sochaczewski joined his fellow students in demonstrations and covert activities against the Russians. On September 2, 1862, Sochaczewski was arrested and imprisoned. A search of his apartment yielded equipment for making bullets, underground publications and other anti-government material. He was sentenced to death on 24 April 1863. His sentence was altered and he was sent instead for hard labor to Siberia. =Return from Siberia= Sochaczewski's prison term in Siberia ended in 1883, and he emigrated to Munich. There he found himself in the company of several Polish painters. A few years later, he moved to Brussels, living there for a few years before settling in Vienna. The 21 years Sochaczewski spent in Siberia left an indelible mark on his mind. Siberia, the harshness of weather and the taxing work at the camps, became a central theme to his works. Sochaczewski set about to depict life in the East. His paintings of this period of his life have the recurrent scenes of convicts and exiles, the arduous trip to Siberia, working conditions in the camp, commonplace activities of camp life, attempts of escaping from the camps, and the misery of the inmates. His works relating to this period won several awards in cities across Europe. Sochaczewski's paintings were the standout feature of the exhibitions that were held in Lviv in 1913. The occasion was the 50th anniversary of the outbreak of the January Uprising. Sochaczewski eventually donated all his paintings to the city Lviv. In return, he asked for a life annuity. This way the painting collection, known as the 'Siberian Collection', became the property of the Lviv National Museum and was being kept together. During the 2nd World War, while Lviv fell successively to the Soviets and the Nazis, the collection was saved by being stored in Kiev. In 1956 Sochaczewski's paintings were returned by the Soviet Ministry of Culture to Poland, as part of returning many old polish heritage items to them. They found a temporary home at the Historical Museum of Warsaw. In 1963, on the 100th anniversary of the January Uprising, most of the collection was transferred to the newly formed Museum of Independence in the Xth Pavilion of the Warsaw Citadel, becoming part of its permanent display. The collection remains there today, comprising 118 paintings and some sketches. Farewell to Europe Farewell to Europe, by Aleksander Sochaczewski. The artist himself is among the exiled here, near the obelisk, on the right. Sochaczewski's most famous painting, Farewell to Europe (), is an homage to his Polish national pride. The name of the painting refers to the last stop of the exiles' convoy at the Europe-Asia border. It is a symbolic painting which depicts various famous Sybiraks (Polish exiles to Siberia), including himself, a person in the right of the Europe-Asia border obelisk looking at it. The painting is on display in the Museum of Independence, Warsaw, Poland.Galeria malarstwa Aleksandra Sochaczewskiego na oficjalnej stronie internetowej Muzeum X Pawilonu Cytadeli Warszawskiej File:Branka 1863.JPGOne of Sochaczewski' works, entitled \\"Branka\\" (1863).

Once forming a rather unified group, they were historically separated, unified under a democratic system, separated during threat of war, and reunified under an authoritarian regime. However, a democratization process has led to a definition of separate statehood for the majority of Czechs and Slovaks.  History  =Ancient time= The Czechs and Slovaks are both ethnic Slavs and speak very similar languages. Moreover, these peoples once formed a very unified group of tribes, which were basically indistinguishable from one another. It is through history and different circumstances, it is believed, that those tribes acquired the characteristics that made them Czechs and Slovaks. As to where exactly the Slav tribes came from, historians cannot agree. =Empires= Great Moravia The Slavonic tribes of Bohemia, Moravia, and Slovakia were formerly embraced within the great Moravian Empire.Kuno≈°i, A. (1944). The basis of Czechoslovak unity. London: A. Dakers limited. Prince Mojm√≠r I, founder of the House of Mojm√≠r, established Great Moravia in 833. At the end of the 9th century, it extended further under the rule of Svatopluk I and became the most powerful Slavonic state of Christendom. However, the tribes living in today's Slovakia were conquered by Magyar (Hungarian) tribes and were separated from the Moravians and Bohemians. In 1025, the territory of present-day Slovakia indeed became a part of the Kingdom of Hungary, thus reducing, but not ending relations between the Czechs and Slovaks. In this period, culture expanded mostly through literature, creating nationalist feelings. Nevertheless, the Czechs and Slovaks were still far from forming a strong united country and the Slovaks remained under Hungarian influence. Habsburg Monarchy In 1526, Bohemia became part of the Habsburg crown, but it was not until the battle of the White Mountain in 1620 that Bohemian independence was liquidated and the native, Czech aristocracy dispossessed.Crampton, R. J. (1994). Eastern Europe in the twentieth century. London ; New York : Routledge As for Moravia, it also became part of the Habsburg Monarchy in 1648. Thus, the Czechs' and Slovaks' lands were divided between Austria and Hungary. This division remained even after the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867, whereby the Dual Monarchy of Austria-Hungary was established. In their respective Empires, Czechs and Slovaks lived under strongly different conditions. On the one hand, Czechs enjoyed a certain autonomy within Austria. Their culture and language could continue to live and expand, even though Czech remained mainly spoken by the peasantry.Crampton, Eastern Europe in the twentieth century. Moreover, they were represented in the Austrian Parliament. In 1862, the Sokol movement was founded in Prague. It played an important part in the Czech national revival and eventually extended to other Slavic countries (Sok√≥≈Ç in Poland). Educated Czechs called for increased political participation. They wanted to have similar privileges as the Magyars, or Hungarians, and Germans, but were unable to form a united force. Thus, the Czech national movement was mostly suppressed.ƒåada, V. (1987). The birth of Czechoslovakia. S. Matou≈°kov√° (Trans.) Prague: Orbis Press Agency. On the other hand, Slovaks were living under harsher conditions in the Kingdom of Hungary. Having no political nor economic power, they were dominated by the Hungarians who tried to assimilate them through Magyarisation process as Slovak schools were closed.Kuno≈°i, The basis of Czechoslovak unity. Under such conditions, the development of a national identity was much more complex and slower.ƒåada, The birth of Czechoslovakia. Having cultural ties with the Czechs, Slovaks were divided between associating with the Czechs or seeking for a separate existence. Moreover, the appeal of joining the Czechs was great since they considered Slovaks as members of their own people and often defended Slovak interests in the Austrian Parliament. =First Czechoslovak Republic= Czechoslovakism was mainly a product of the First World War. The three founders of the Czechoslovak National Council, Masaryk, Bene≈°, and ≈†tef√°nik, met in France, seeking for complete independence rather than only more autonomy in the Habsburg Empire. On 6 January 1918 Czech deputies in the Reichsrat issued the ‚ÄòTwelfth Night Declaration‚Äô demanding self-determination for the Czechoslovaks. On October 28, the National Council seized power and Czechoslovakia was created as a parliamentary democracy. Besides the mutual feelings of unity among Czechs and Slovaks, there were also clear demographic incentives for creating Czechoslovakia. One in three of the population of the Czechs lands was Germans, most of them living in the Sudetenland region. The Czechs could not be confident of defending the new state against a German minority which constituted approximately a third of the population; association with the Slovaks would decrease the minority to just under a quarter and thus make it much more manageable. The Czechoslovak Constitution of 1920 identified the \\"Czechoslovak nation\\" as the creator and principal constituent of the Czechoslovak state and established the \\"Czechoslovak language\\" as the official language. The concept of Czechoslovakism was necessary in order to justify the establishment of Czechoslovakia towards the world, because otherwise the statistical majority of the Czechs as compared to Germans would be rather weak. After World War I, the First Czechoslovak Republic was finally formed by combining the Czech lands, Upper Hungary, and Carpathian Ruthenia, which was annexed in 1919 due to the Allies‚Äô pressure. If the desire for a Czechoslovak nation had been expressed for a long time, the Slovaks in the 1920s, nevertheless, felt resentment because they were proportionally less represented into the Czechoslovak administration. This, however, can be explained by the fact that, in Austria-Hungary, the Czechs had the opportunity to develop an elite which could then lead the new country and that such an elite was totally absent in the Slovak population. Moreover, the formation of a Czechoslovak Hussite Church which conducted its services in Czech created large discontent. New national holidays, such as July 6, which commemorated the death of Czech reformer Jan Hus, created opposition within the Catholics. Also during the 1920s, the Slovaks became more and more literate, thus developing their own culture, and the structures promoting such a Slovak culture. =1938‚Äì1945: Nazi Regime and World War II= The resentment felt by the Slovak population was expressed by the growing support it gave to the Nazi regime and policies. Thus, when Adolf Hitler decided to split Czechoslovakia, Slovaks showed little opposition. The Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia was created, and Slovak State became a puppet state of Nazi Germany. However, Slovaks soon realized that this clearly meant Nazi domination and control, not real independence. The Slovak National Uprising in 1944 was suppressed by Nazi Germany, but guerrilla warfare continued until the Soviet Army liberated Slovakia in 1945. =Soviet-backed regime= Following the defeat of the Nazis and the end of the Second World War, Czechoslovakia was restored as a unitary state. After the Czechoslovak coup d'√©tat of 1948, the Slovak independence movement was suppressed and the Communist Party of Slovakia incorporated into the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia.Latawski, P. (Ed.). (1995). Contemporary nationalism in East Central Europe. New York : St. Martin‚Äôs Press. In addition, Slovak communists who favoured a unitary state were installed in power.Latawski, Contemporary nationalism in East Central Europe. The most important change in the 1960 Constitution of Czechoslovakia was that it severely limited the autonomy granted to Slovakia. This provision was the decision of President Anton√≠n Novotn√Ω. The executive branch of the Slovak government was abolished and its duties assigned to the Presidium of the Slovak National Council, thus combining executive and legislative functions into a single body. The legislative National Assembly was given authority to overrule decisions of the Slovak National Council, and central government agencies took over the administration of the major organs of Slovak local government. The situation changed under Nikita Khrushchev‚Äôs leadership. The new General Secretary had a very different perspective about nationalities and decided to rehabilitate Slovak nationalists. Moreover, the purges and destalinization process of the 1950s caused the revival of Slovak nationalism. On the one hand, many Slovaks had been purged from the Party, and on the other hand, the destalinization process asked for more concessions and compromises. Intellectuals began to have ideas of federalism. The Prague Spring in 1968 was followed by a period of normalization, sometimes called Husakism after Gust√°v Hus√°k. Thus, in October 1968, Czechoslovakia amended the 1960 Constitution by the Constitutional Law of Federation. The Slovaks were recognized as a separate nation and were given their own governmental bodies, namely the Slovak national council and the board of commissioners. =Velvet Revolution and divorce= With the Velvet Revolution of 1989 and the end of the Soviet Union, the historic differences between the Czechs and the Slovaks came back. Those were mainly expressed through different political and economic viewpoints. While Slovaks were more attached and committed to state welfare and ownership, Czechs were wishing for a quick change to the western model of capitalism.Kellas, J. G. (1991). The politics of nationalism and ethnicity. New York: St. Martin‚Äôs Press. Moreover, there were intense debates on renaming the country, with various hyphened versions of Czechoslovakia (this conflict was called the Hyphen War). In addition, the system of checks and balances set up by the constitution made it possible for Slovak autonomists to block political institutions from functioning. On July 17, 1992, the Slovak national council adopted Slovakia's declaration of sovereignty, and major constitutional changes gave the Slovaks their own state, which they had desired for a long time. The peaceful dissolution of Czechoslovakia led to the establishment of the Czech and Slovak Republics.  National characteristics  =Languages= Czech and Slovak remain very similar languages. At the time of their formation, Czech and Slovak were actually the same. They both come from Church Slavonic, the original language of Slav tribes and transformed into a literary language by Saints Cyril and Methodius, who brought Christianity to Eastern Europe. However, spoken Czech is today very different from Slavonic, due to the many reforms, notably those of Jan Hus. As for Slovak, it consists of many dialects. Those from the Western part resemble Czech and those from the East are more similar to Slavonic. Differences between the Czech and Slovak languages can also be explained by the Magyarisation of Slovak which occurred mainly in the 19th Century. However, even though Czech and Slovak are different languages, in most cases both Czech and Slovaks can easily understand each other, speaking their own language. Nevertheless, language is an important stone of the Czech and Slovak societies. Thus, knowledge of language is a requirement for the acquisition of citizenship. =Religions= The Bohemian population was mainly Protestant. Today, however, it is mostly non-religious. The Moravian and Slovak populations are mainly Catholic. However, Czechoslovakia is truly a mosaic of diverse religions.  Citizenship laws  After the Velvet Divorce, laws about citizenship became clearer with the new constitutions. During the Soviet Regime, there was not much place for the rule of law. The rights and duties of citizens were similar to other socialist states, an included the right to serve in the military and the right to work. If the citizens clearly had no recognized political rights, they were, however, able to organize and get some political impact through the civil society, highly developed in Czechoslovakia. Moreover, the Bene≈° Decrees were very discriminatory against the German and Hungarian minorities of Czechoslovakia, who could not be granted citizenship. Emphasis was thus put on the unitary character of Czechoslovakia. = Definition of citizenship = As of December 31, 1992, citizens of the Czech and Slovak Republic could either choose to become Czech or Slovak citizens. However, since in 1968 Slovakia was given some degree of autonomy, there existed a Slovak Republic that was granting citizenship. Thus, people who had Czechoslovak citizenship, but not Slovak citizenship had one year to apply for Slovak citizenship, which usually meant loss of Czech nationality. As for citizens of both Czechoslovakia and Slovak Republic, they could be automatically granted any of both citizenship, according to their choice. = Slovak citizenship laws = Children acquire their citizenship from their parents, even if they are adoptive parents, or by birth on Slovak territory if otherwise they would become stateless. Acquisition of citizenship is also granted upon request if a person has lived for at least 5 continuous years on Slovak territory and speaks Slovak language. Moreover, persons having no other citizenship are usually favoured. In addition, citizenship is easily granted to a person married to a Slovak citizen, or to a person who has economically, culturally, scientifically, or technologically greatly contributed to the Slovak society. As for loss to citizenship, a person who request it in order to get citizenship from another state, will be released from state bond.Slovak Nationality Law 1993 = Czech citizenship laws = Citizenship in Czech Republic is granted by Jus Sanguinis principle. Thus, nationality is granted to children of Czech Citizens. Unless the parents are stateless, and at least one is a permanent resident of the Czech Republic, the children born on Czech territory from non-Czech parents are not granted citizenship. However, children under 15 years old, born in Czech territory, whose parents‚Äô nationality cannot be identified become Czech citizens. As for naturalization, permanent residents of the Czech Republic who have lived on the territory for at least 5 years and do not hold citizenship from another country and who has sufficient knowledge of Czech language, can apply to be granted of Czech citizenship. More flexibility is possible if the person demanding is the spouse of a Czech citizen, or if that person was adopted by a Czech citizen. As for the loss of citizenship, it is given on voluntary demand, unless that would make the person stateless. = Rights and duties = Czech and Slovak citizens basically have the same rights and duties than most citizens of other democratic countries, including the right to vote. Moreover, they cannot be refused access to their country and may benefit from diplomatic protection.

He was visited by Saint David who was so impressed with his holiness that he made him his confessor and Abbot of St David's Cathedral. However, Justinian became disillusioned with the poor attitude of the monks at St Davids and took himself away the short distance to remote Ramsey Island to establish a more holy spiritual community. His more loyal monks followed him. Legend has it that he was eventually murdered by some disgruntled servants or monks fed up with his strict regime, it is said by beheading him. Apparently he picked up his head and crossed Ramsey Sound walking on the water carrying his head in his arms and his body was buried in the small ruined chapel which still stands on the mainland at St Justinian's, immediately opposite his island home; his bones are believed to rest in St Davids Cathedral. Veneration Justinian is listed on very ancient Welsh calendars of saints and martyrs and the Anglican church at Llanstinan, near Fishguard, is dedicated to him.

In other words, uncertainty analysis aims to make a technical contribution to decision-making through the quantification of uncertainties in the relevant variables. In physical experiments uncertainty analysis, or experimental uncertainty assessment, deals with assessing the uncertainty in a measurement. An experiment designed to determine an effect, demonstrate a law, or estimate the numerical value of a physical variable will be affected by errors due to instrumentation, methodology, presence of confounding effects and so on. Experimental uncertainty estimates are needed to assess the confidence in the results. A related field is design of experiments. Likewise in numerical experiments and modelling uncertainty analysis draws upon a number of techniques for determining the reliability of model predictions, accounting for various sources of uncertainty in model input and design. A related field is sensitivity analysis. A calibrated parameter does not necessarily represent reality, as reality is much more complex. Any prediction has its own complexities of reality that cannot be represented uniquely in the calibrated model; therefore, there is a potential error. Such error must be accounted for when making management decisions on the basis of model outcomes.

The 1st Squadron, 75th Cavalry Regiment (1-75 CAV) is a United States Army cavalry squadron established in 2004. It is the Reconnaissance, Surveillance and Target Acquisition Squadron (RSTA) squadron of the 2nd Brigade Combat Team \\"Strike\\" ‚ô•, 101st Airborne Division (Air Assault), and performs reconnaissance and cavalry missions in support of that brigade. Activation 1st Squadron, 75th Cavalry (\\"Widowmakers\\"), a RSTA, was formed under the U.S. Army's transformation in September 2004. The squadron was formed under 2nd Infantry Brigade Combat Team \\"Strike\\", 101st Airborne Division in place of 3-502nd Infantry. The first commander of the squadron was LTC Alfonso J. Ahuja with CSM Scott C. Schroeder. The lineage of the Squadron dates back to World War II, as the 705th Tank Destroyer Battalion which was attached to the 502nd Infantry Regiment. The motto of 1-75 CAV (Widowmakers) is ONE ROUND! Deployment and training The 1-75 Cavalry deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in autumn of 2005. The squadron remained with 2BCT, 101st Airborne Division based out of Camp Striker. The squadron, along with the rest of 2BCT, patrolled Southwest Baghdad in an area known as the \\"triangle of death\\". 1-75 CAV is noted for locating and destroying multiple weapons caches as well as detaining several ranking members of Al- Qaeda in Iraq. In January 2006 the Squadron was moved to protect a deadly Main Supply Route (MSR) leading into Baghdad. While controlling this supply route, the squadron successfully decreased improvised explosive device and small arms attacks by over 80%, thus enabling safe transport of supplies and materials into central and northern Iraq. During the time spent on MSR security, the squadron suffered two casualties. 1-75 CAV returned to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom in October 2007, and redeployed to Fort Campbell in late November 2008. 1-75 CAV deployed to Afghanistan in support of Operation Enduring Freedom in June 2010 and returned in April 2011.

It is a variation on the story told in the 1719 novel Robinson Crusoe by Daniel Defoe. The film stars Aidan Quinn as Crusoe. Plot Tidewater, Virginia 1808. The story begins at sea with the main protagonist, Crusoe (Aidan Quinn), en route to Africa to retrieve slaves. His ship runs into a powerful storm, and the entire crew perishes except for Crusoe. He eventually makes his way to a tropical island, where he is alone and stranded until he discovers that a dog named Scamp and a small flock of geese have also survived. He befriends Scamp, and gains a close ally. He initially encounters many challenges, but eventually manages to make himself at ease on the island. Later he finds a rifle inside the shipwreck, and, weapon in hand and Scamp by his side, begins exploring the island. After spending more time on the island, Crusoe stumbles upon a group of tribesmen who are indigenous to the area but not the island. He finds, to his horror, that they are cannibals. Following this discovery, Crusoe begins chopping down trees in an attempt to build a boat and escape. His plans do not immediately succeed, and he fashions a cavern into a homestead. Subsequently, Scamp gets sick, and his attempts to cure him fail. Crusoe finds him dead the following morning. This starts a period of intense loneliness for Crusoe. Through his grief he fails to notice several small boats approaching the island. The natives have come to this island to perform the ritual cremation of their chief along with the sacrifice of three of their fellow tribesmen. The chief lies dead on a great branch armchair, which is set ablaze. At the same moment, the throats of two of the tribesmen are cut, but just before the last killing, Crusoe shoots his rifle, distracting the would- be assassins. The man who was to be sacrificed (Hepburn Graham) escapes; as does Crusoe. The two meet by chance in the forest and Crusoe, fearing for his life, threatens the man with his gun. The tribesman, however, does not perceive this as a threat. They both return to the beach thinking the cannibalistic tribesmen have left in their boats. From this moment the tribesman, named Lucky, starts to trust Crusoe. Crusoe takes him back to his cave but still does not allow Lucky to sleep in the cave with him. He leaves him chained by the ankle outside the cave. The following morning Crusoe finds Lucky gone. He sees smoke coming from the place of the sacrifices and investigates. There he discovers the head of Lucky. Crusoe ends up in the trap of another tribesman (Ade Sapara) who ties him to a tree near his cave. The following day, Crusoe attempts to take revenge on the tribesman. A pursuit follows, and Crusoe tries to shoot the tribesman which surprises him. During their struggle they stumble into some quicksand. The cannibal is able to escape the shifting sands, leaving Crusoe to sink. As Crusoe is about to perish he is granted clemency from the cannibal who decides to help by lowering him a tree branch. Soon, the two attempt to collaborate in the native language of the cannibal. In time, Crusoe is able to understand the intentions of the cannibal. These intentions are to manufacture a small boat to return home with the help of Crusoe. After completing construction on the boat, Crusoe decides to build a second boat. A strange shot however, announces the arrival of another ship, this one full of European sailors. Crusoe runs to high ground and attempts to catch their attention. Little does he know that they have come to the island to capture his new friend. Crusoe has other concerns, however, like returning home. He stows away on their ship, hoping to catch a ride. While hiding onboard he discovers that among the crew is a scientist, Dr. Martin (Michael Higgins), who has studied cannibals and plans to bring his friend back to London. Crusoe, who does not agree with this plan, attempts to free his friend without being seen by the crew. Crusoe eventually escapes the island which helps him to realize that liberty and life are precious. Cast * Aidan Quinn as Crusoe * Hepburn Graham as Lucky * Ade Sapara as Tribesman * Michael Higgins as Dr. Martin * Ricco Ross as 2nd Victim Critical response Reviews for the film were mixed. Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times gave the film three and a half out of four stars, saying \\"It is a big, bold production, with the width of vision that sometimes develops when the director has a background in cinematography. Caleb Deschanel, who made it, needs few spoken words to tell his story, and probably could have done with less.\\" Film4 said that although \\"the film is stronger on visuals than actual substance\\" it was \\"still a brave interpretation of an oft-told tale, with Quinn as a convincingly unpleasant Crusoe.\\" Rita Kempley of The Washington Post gave the film a negative review saying \\"Crusoe makes a pretty, fairly tame voyage from an antiquated, salty yarn to a modern-day repudiation of slavery. It's lost its rhythms along the way, as well as its personality.\\" The New Yorkers Pauline Kael said \\"[Deschanel] has an instinct for image magic, his emotionality and his feeling for atmosphere can carry a viewer along. Aidan Quinn's Crusoe is a hippie Christ figure - a young man finding the way to be gentle. He's the right actor for Deschanel's conception. The Robinson Crusoe story has been reimagined so that it's not a wilderness test of survival - it's a stripped down search for values.\\" References External links Category:1989 films Category:1980s adventure drama films Category:British films Category:British adventure drama films Category:English-language films Category:Films based on Robinson Crusoe Category:Films shot in Serbia Category:Films directed by Caleb Deschanel Category:1988 drama films Category:1989 drama films ","title":"Crusoe (film)"},{"id":"13990751","text":"WJQS (1400 AM, \\"The Fan\\") is a sports talk radio station in Jackson, Mississippi, owned by Alpha Media through licensee Alpha Media Licensee LLC.

Archaeology Ruins of the ancient synagogue The Kfar Bar'am synagogue is preserved up to the second story and has been restored. The architecture is similar to that of other synagogues in the Galilee built in the Talmudic period. In 1522, Rabbi Moses Basula wrote that the synagogue belonged to Simeon bar Yochai, who survived the Second Jewish War in 132-135 CE (the Bar-Kochba revolt). Archaeologists, however, have concluded that the building was built at least a century later. According to another tradition, the synagogue was built in honor of Rabbi Shimon bar Yochai, and bore his name.Burial Places of the Fathers, published by Yehuda Levi Nahum in book: ·π¢ohar la-·∏•asifat ginzei teiman (Heb. ◊¶◊î◊® ◊ú◊ó◊©◊ô◊§◊™ ◊í◊†◊ñ◊ô ◊™◊ô◊û◊ü), Tel-Aviv 1986, p. 252 (Hebrew) Israeli archaeologist Lipa Sukenik (1889‚Äì1953), who was instrumental in establishing the Department of Archaeology at the Hebrew University, excavated a relief in one of the synagogues in 1928, and dated the Bar‚Äôam synagogue to the 3rd century CE. The synagogue is made of basalt stone, standard for most buildings in the area. The six-column portico is unusual. The front entrance of the synagogue has three doorways that face Jerusalem. In front of the entrance are some of the (originally eight) columns with Attic bases which supported a porch. There is an inscription under the right window on the facade, which reads: \\"Banahu Elazar bar Yodan\\", which means \\"Elazar bar Yodan built it\\". Elazar bar Yodan is a Jewish Aramaic name. The interior of the synagogue was divided by rows of columns into three aisles and an ambulatory. An unusual feature in an ancient synagogue is the presence of three-dimensional sculpture, a pair of stone lions. A similar pair of three-dimensional lions was found at Chorazin.Art and Judaism in the Greco-Roman world: toward a new Jewish archaeology, Steven Fine, Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 190. A carved frieze features a winged victory and images of animals and, possibly, human figures.Art and Judaism in the Greco-Roman world: toward a new Jewish archaeology, Steven Fine, Cambridge University Press, 2005, p. 92. There was a second, smaller synagogue, but little of it was found. A lintel from this smaller synagogue is at the Louvre. The Hebrew inscription on the lintel reads, \\"Peace be upon the place, and on all the places of Israel.\\"Art and Judaism in the Greco-Roman world: toward a new Jewish archaeology, Steven Fine, Cambridge University Press, 2005, Chapter 1, Building an Ancient Synagogue on the Delaware, pp. 12-21 In 1901, publication of photos of the ancient synagogue led the Jewish Hospital of Philadelphia, (now the Albert Einstein Medical Center,) to erect a synagogue, the Henry S. Frank Memorial Synagogue, inspired by Bar'am and other ancient Israeli synagogues. The hospital's synagogue replicated the round arch of the door of the standing ruin and the lintel from the smaller synagogue that is now in the Louvre.

It was formerly a primarily industrial zone, known for the glass and rope making industries, but is now an area of regeneration.  Geography  The area formerly known as New Charlton is situated in the Greenwich wards of Peninsula and Woolwich Riverside. It is bounded by the river Thames in the north and the A206 (Woolwich Road) in the south. On the west it borders the Greenwich Peninsula at Horn Lane and Horn Link Way. On the east it borders Woolwich at the Thames Barrier and Eastmoor Street. The Westminster Estate, the area between the Thames Barrier and Warspite Road, has at times been referred to as part of New Charlton. The Survey of London however regards it as a part of Woolwich, since it is situated in the historic parish of Woolwich. From 1863 until 1968 this was the site of Siemens Brothers, where many who were living across the road in New Charlton worked. This is also where Charlton Athletic F.C. played their first football matches at Siemens Meadow from 1905 until 1907.Saint & Guillery, The Survey of London vol. 48: Woolwich, Yale, 2012 (online PDF, pp. 44-53). In the Charlton Riverside Masterplan SPD the Westminster Estate is considered a part of Charlton Riverside. The SPD also includes Charlton railway station and a small section of Charlton Church Lane.  History  New Charlton in 1905, as seen from Maryon Park. On the left: housing along Hardens Manor Way, now Eastmoor Street, all since demolished. To the right, along Woolwich Road: Maryon Park School (1896), now Windrush Primary School. In the centre: Charlton Athletic's earliest ground. Beyond: factory buildings of Siemens Brothers Industrial development on the flat land adjoining the Thames at Charlton Riverside began in the middle of the 19th century, especially after the opening of a private railway branch line to Angerstein Wharf in 1852. A notable establishment was the Siemens Brothers Telegraph Works opened in 1863 (although the factory was largely in Woolwich). The company manufactured two new transatlantic cables in the 1880s,A Visit to the Works of Messrs. Siemens Bros, The Telegraphist, 2 June 1884. and contributed to the PLUTO project in World War II. Since the 1960s the area had sunk into industrial decline, with most of the original factories closing (Siemens Brothers in 1968).  Recent history; regeneration  There have been several regeneration projects in the area, starting in the 1980s, after the opening of the Thames Barrier. It was identified as part of an Opportunity Area by the Mayor of London in 2008 and, more clearly, in the London Plan of 2011. Regeneration of the area is now focused on the Charlton Riverside Masterplan agreed by the Royal Borough of Greenwich in April 2012 and updated in February 2017. The masterplan envisages a series of new neighbourhoods with medium-rise housing and a significant proportion of family homes. A network of streets and open spaces will be shaped by the area's industrial heritage. In 2013, Royal Greenwich UTC opened as part of this plan. The college failed to attract sufficient numbers of students and in 2016 was converted into a free school, Royal Greenwich Trust School. Adjacent to it, also on Woolwich Road and officially in Woolwich, is Windrush Primary School, formerly Maryon Park School, from the 1990s until 2015 Holborn College.

Description  = Northern part = In total there are around 400 businesses in Charlton Riverside (including the section east of the Thames Barrier). One of the few remaining industrial facilities on the riverside is the construction aggregate and ready mix cement works of Aggregate Industries at Angerstein Wharf adjacent to the Greenwich Peninsula. The southern end of the Thames Barrier which opened in 1983 is at Charlton Riverside. The Thames Path was laid out here shortly afterwards but officially only opened in 1996. There is only one functioning public house in the area, the Anchor & Hope, with an outdoor caf√© overlooking the Thames. A set of watermen's stairs has survived here, reconstructed in concrete. The former Lads of the Village pub was later named the Thames Barrier Arms. It is now a veterinary clinic. A former industrial site near the Thames Barrier houses an indoor paintball facility. = Southern part = The southern part of Charlton Riverside along Woolwich Road and Bugsby's Road is now dominated by shopping centres, supermarkets and retail warehouses. Large retailers are Asda, Sainsbury's, Makro, Argos and Marks & Spencer. In the south-west corner, around Woolwich Road and Aldeburgh Street there is some housing, as well as along Anchor and Hope Lane. East of this street is Ropery Business Park with several small business.

It is a 131 kDa protein with amino acid sequence of 1242 residues. It contains a single pleckstrin homology (PH) domain at the N-terminus and a PTB domain ca. 40 residues downstream of this, followed by a poorly conserved C-terminus tail. Together with IRS2, IRS3 (pseudogene) and IRS4, it is homologous to the Drosophila protein chico, whose disruption extends the median lifespan of flies up to 48%. Similarly, Irs1 mutant mice experience moderate life extension and delayed age-related pathologies.  Function  Insulin receptor substrate 1 plays a key role in transmitting signals from the insulin and insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) receptors to intracellular pathways PI3K / Akt and Erk MAP kinase pathways. Tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS-1 by insulin receptor (IR) introduces multiple binding sites for proteins bearing SH2 homology domain, such as PI3K, Grb-2/Sos complex and SHP2. PI3K, involved in interaction with IRS-1, produces PIP3, which, in turn, recruits Akt kinase. Further, Akt kinase is activated via phosphorylation of its T308 residue and analogous sites in PKC by PDK1. This phosphorylation is absent in tissues lacking IRS-1. The cascade is followed by glucose uptake. Formation of the Grb-2/Sos complex, also known as the RAS guanine nucleotide exchange factor complex, results in ERK1/2 activation. IRS-1 signal transduction may be inhibited by SHP2 in some tissues. Tyrosine phosphorylation of the insulin receptors or IGF-1 receptors, upon extracellular ligand binding, induces the cytoplasmic binding of IRS-1 to these receptors, through its PTB domains. Multiple tyrosine residues of IRS-1 itself are then phosphorylated by these receptors. This enables IRS-1 to activate several signalling pathways, including the PI3K pathway and the MAP kinase pathway. An alternative multi-site phosphorylation of Serine/Tyrosine in IRS-1 regulates insulin signaling positively and negatively. C-terminal region contains most of the phosphorylation sites of the protein. The C-terminal tail is not structured, therefore the mechanisms of regulation of IRS-1 by phosphorylation still remain unclear. It has been shown that TNFŒ± causes insulin resistance and multi-site S/T phosphorylation, which results in block of interaction between IRS-1 and juxtamembrane domain peptide, thus converting IRS-1 into an inactive state. IRS-1 plays important biological function for both metabolic and mitogenic (growth promoting) pathways: mice deficient of IRS1 have only a mild diabetic phenotype, but a pronounced growth impairment, i.e., IRS-1 knockout mice only reach 50% of the weight of normal mice. Regulation The cellular protein levels of IRS-1 are regulated by the Cullin7 E3 ubiquitin ligase, which targets IRS-1 for ubiquitin mediated degradation by the proteasome. Different Serine phosphorylation of IRS-1, caused by various molecules, such as fatty acids, TNFŒ± and AMPK, has different effects on the protein, but most of these effects include cellular re- localization, conformational and steric changes. These processes lead to decrease in Tyrosine phosphorylation by insulin receptors and diminished PI3K recruitment. Altogether, these mechanisms stimulate IRS-1 degradation and insulin resistance. Other inhibitory pathways include SOCS proteins and O-GlcNAcylation of IRS-1. SOCS proteins act by binding to IR and by interfering with IR phosphorylation of IRS-1, therefore attenuating insulin signaling. They can also bind to JAK, causing a subsequent decrease in IRS-1 tyrosine phosphorylation. During insulin resistance induced by hyperglycemia, glucose accumulates in tissues as its hexosamine metabolite UDP-GlcNAc. This metabolite if present in high amounts leads to O-GlcNAc protein modifications. IRS-1 can undergo this modification, which results in its phosphorylation and functional suppression.  Interactions  IRS1 has been shown to interact with: * Bcl-2, * Grb2, * INSR, * IGF1R, * JAK1, * JAK2, * MAPK8, * PIK3R1 * PIK3R3, * PTK2, * PTPN11, * PTPN1, and * YWHAE.  Role in cancer  IRS-1, as a signalling adapter protein, is able to integrate different signalling cascades, which indicates its possible role in cancer progression. IRS-1 protein is known to be involved in various types of cancer, including colorectal, lung, prostate and breast cancer. IRS-1 integrates signalling from insulin receptor (InsR), insulin-like growth factor-1 receptor (IGF1R) and many other cytokine receptors and is elevated in Œ≤-catenin induced cells. Some evidence shows that TCF/LEF-Œ≤-catenin complexes directly regulate IRS-1. IRS-1 is required for maintenance of neoplasmic phenotype in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC) - mutated cells, it is also needed for transformation in ectopically expressing oncogenic Œ≤-catenin cells. IRS-1 dominant-negative mutant functions as tumor suppressor, whereas ectopic IRS-1 stimulates oncogenic transformation. IRS-1 is upregulated in colorectal cancers (CRC) with elevated levels of Œ≤-catenin, c-MYC, InsRŒ≤ and IGF1R. IRS-1 promotes CRC metastasis to the liver. Decreased apoptosis of crypt stem cells is associated with colon cancer risk. Reduced expression of IRS-1 in Apc (min/+) mutated mice showes increased irradiation-induced apoptosis in crypt. Deficiency in IRS-1 - partial (+/-) or absolute (-/-) - in Apc (min/+) mice demonstrates reduced amount of tumors comparing to IRS-1 (+/+)/ Apc (min/+) mice. In lung adenocarcinoma cell line A549 overexpression of IRS-1 leads to reduced growth. Tumor infiltrating neutrophils have recently been thought to adjust tumor growth and invasiveness. Neutrophil elastase is shown to degrade IRS-1 by gaining access to endosomal compartment of carcinoma cell. IRS-1 degradation induces cell proliferation in mouse and human adenocarcinomas. Ablation of IRS-1 alters downstream signalling through phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase (PI3K), causing an increased interaction of it with platelet-derived growth factor receptor (PDGFR). Therefore, IRS-1 acts as major regulator of PI3K in lung adenocarcinoma. Some evidence shows role of IRS-1 in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). In rat model, IRS-1 focal overexpression is associated with early events of hepatocarcinogenesis. During progression of preneoplastic foci into hepatocellular carcinomas expression of IRS-1 gradually decreases, which is characterises a metabolic shift heading towards malignant neoplastic phenotype. Transgenic mice, co-expressing IRS-1 and hepatitis Bx (HBx) protein, demonstrate higher rate of hepatocellular displasia that results in HCC development. Expressed alone, IRS-1 and HBx are not sufficient to induce neoplastic alterations in the liver, though their paired expression switches on IN/IRS-1/MAPK and Wnt/Œ≤-catenin cascades, causing HCC transformation. LNCaP prostate cancer cells increase cell adhesion and diminish cell motility via IGF-1 independent mechanism, when IRS-1 is ectopically expressed in the cells. These effects are mediated by PI3K. Uncanonical phosphorylation of Serine 612 by PI3K of IRS-1 protein is due to hyper-activation of Akt/PKB pathway in LNCaP. IRS-1 interacts with integrin Œ±5Œ≤1, activating an alternative signalling cascade. This cascade results in decreased cell motility opposing to IGF-1 - dependent mechanism. Loss of IRS-1 expression and PTEN mutations in LNCaP cells could promote metastasis. Ex vivo studies of IRS-1 involvement in prostate cancer show ambiguous results. Down-regulation of IGF1R in bone marrow biopsies of metastatic prostate cancer goes along with down-regulation of IRS-1 and significant reduction of PTEN in 3 out of 12 cases. Most of the tumors still express IRS-1 and IGF1R during progression of the metastatic disease. IRS-1 has a functional role in breast cancer progression and metastasis. Overexpression of PTEN in MCF-7 epithelial breast cancer cells inhibits cell growth by inhibiting MAPK pathway. ERK phosphorylation through IRS-1/Grb-2/Sos pathway is inhibited by phosphatase activity of PTEN. PTEN does not have effect on IRS-1 independent MAPK activation. When treated with insulin, ectopic expression of PTEN in MCF-7 suppresses IRS-1/Grb-2/Sos complex formation due to differential phosphorylation of IRS-1. Overexpression of IRS-1 has been linked to antiestrogen resistance and hormone independence in breast cancer. Tamoxifen (TAM) inhibits IRS-1 function, therefore suppressing IRS-1/PI3K signalling cascade in estrogen receptor positive (ER+) MCF-7 cell line. IRS-1 siRNA is able to reduce IRS-1 transcript level, thereby reducing protein expression in MCF-7 ER+ cells. Reduction of IRS-1 leads to decreased survival of these cells. siRNA treatment effects are additive to effects of TAM treatment. IGFRs and estrogen coaction facilitates growth in different breast cancer cell lines, however amplification of IGF1R signalling can abrogate need of estrogen for transformation and growth of MCF-7 cells. IRS-1 overexpression in breast cancer cells decreased estrogen requirements. This decrease is dependent on IRS-1 levels in the cells. Estradiol enhances expression of IRS-1 and activity of ERK1/2 and PI3K/Akt pathways in MCF-7 and CHO cells transfected with mouse IRS-1 promoter. Estradiol acts directly on IRS-1 regulatory sequences and positively regulates IRS-1 mRNA production. Decreased anchorage- dependent/independent cell growth and initiation of cell death under low growth factor and estrogen conditions are observed in MCF-7 cells with down-regulated IRS-1. mir126 is underexpressed in breast cancer cells. mir126 targets IRS-1 at transcriptional level and inhibits transition from G1/G0 phase to S phase during cell cycle in HEK293 and MCF-7 cells. Transgenic mice overexpressing IRS-1 develop metastatic breast cancer.The tumors demonstrate squamous differentiation which is associated with Œ≤-catenin pathway. IRS-1 interacts with Œ≤-catenin both in vitro and in vivo. IRS-1 and its homologue IRS-2 play distinct roles in breast cancer progression and metastasis. Overexpression of either one is sufficient to cause tumorogenesis in vivo. Frequency of lung metastasis in IRS-1 deficient tumor is elevated opposing to IRS-2 deficient tumor, where it is decreased. Basically, IRS-2 has a positive impact on metastasis of breast cancer whereas a stronger metastatic potential is observed when IRS-1 is down-regulated. IRS-1 is strongly expressed in ductal carcinoma in situ', when IRS-2 is elevated in invasive tumors. Increased IRS-1 makes MCF-7 cells susceptible to specific chemotherapeutic agents, such as taxol, etoposide, and vincristine.Therefore, IRS-1 can be a good pointer of specific drug therapies effectiveness for breast cancer treatment.

Biography =Family background and education= Hunter was the older of the two sons of Henry Charles Vicars Hunter, , and the Honourable Florence Edith Louise (n√©e Dormer), daughter of John Baptist Joseph Dormer, 12th Baron Dormer of Wyng. His father was the principal landowner in Kilburn, Derbyshire, but lived at Abermarlais Park, Llangadog, Carmarthenshire. His younger brother Thomas Vicars Hunter also served in the Rifle Brigade and Royal Flying Corps during World War I, but was killed in 1917. =World War I= After passing out from Royal Military College, Sandhurst, Hunter was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the Rifle Brigade (Prince Consort's Own) on 5 February 1913. He was promoted to lieutenant on 27 November 1914, and to captain on 8 December 1915. Hunter was wounded in 1915 and, following his recovery, was seconded to the Royal Flying Corps later in the year. He was granted Royal Aero Club Aviators' Certificate No. 2872 on 9 May 1916, and was appointed a flying officer on 24 May 1916. On 17 October 1916 he was appointed a flight commander with the acting rank of captain. He was awarded the Military Cross, which was gazetted on 20 October 1916. His citation read: :Captain Henry John Francis Hunter, Rifle Brigade, and Royal Flying Corps. ::\\"For conspicuous gallantry and skill. He has done fine work for the artillery, and has accounted for many enemy guns. On one occasion, when a heavy storm drove all other machines back to their aerodromes, and the enemy guns took the opportunity to become active, he remained up and did fine work.\\" On 1 June 1917 he was appointed squadron commander, with the acting rank of major, of No. 9 Squadron RFC, flying the R.E.8 in France. He received a mention in despatches on 7 November 1917. On 1 April 1918, the Army's Royal Flying Corps (RFC) and the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) were merged to form the Royal Air Force, and Hunter was transferred to the RAF with the rank of captain (acting- major). On 17 April he was appointed commander of No. 42 Squadron RAF, another R.E.8 squadron in France. =Inter-war career= On 15 January 1919 Hunter was appointed to command of No. 105 Squadron RAF, a Bristol F.2 Fighter reconnaissance squadron based in Omagh, Northern Ireland. On 11 July he received another mention in despatches. He served as the commander of the School of Army Co-operation at Old Sarum from 25 July, and on 1 August resigned his commission in the Rifle Brigade after being awarded a permanent commission as a major in the RAF. A year later, on 1 August 1919, when the RAF adopted its own rank system, Major Hunter became Squadron Leader Hunter. On 1 March 1921 he was appointed Officer Commanding, No. 12 Squadron RAF part of the Army of Occupation in Germany, based at Bickendorf. He was posted to the RAF Depot at Uxbridge as a supernumerary on 25 May 1922, before attending a course at the Senior Officers' School, Woking, from 26 May to 18 August. On 19 September 1922 he was transferred from the RAF Depot (Inland Area) to the Headquarters of No. 10 Group (Coastal Area) for personnel staff duties. Hunter was transferred to the staff of the RAF Training Base at Leuchars on 8 November 1925, receiving promotion to wing commander on 1 January 1926. Hunter attended the Royal Naval War College from 14 March 1927, and from 3 January 1928 was Officer Commanding, Flying, aboard the carrier . From 10 November 1928 Hunter was once again a supernumerary at the RAF Depot at Uxbridge, pending a posting. From 21 January 1929 he attended a staff course at the RAF Staff College, Andover, and on 14 December 1929 he was posted to No. 1 (Apprentices) Wing at the No. 1 School of Technical Training, RAF Halton, for administrative duties. Hunter was promoted to group captain on 1 January 1933. From 6 February 1933 to 16 April 1934 he served as Senior Air Staff Officer, HQ Fighting Area, Uxbridge, and served as the commander of the Aircraft Depot at Hinaidi, Iraq, for two years, from 11 November 1934. After serving as the station commander of RAF Finningley from 2 February 1937, Hunter was retired from the RAF at own request on 15 June 1939. =World War II= Hunter was recalled to duty on 26 September 1939 to serve in Bomber Command, and was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire on 24 September 1941. On 30 January 1942 Hunter was appointed Air Officer Commanding, No. 225 (Bomber) Group in southern Sumatra, operating from an airfield at Prabumulih, codenamed \\"P2\\", in a vain attempt to stem the Japanese advance. However, despite some local successes, the ABDACOM forces were soon overwhelmed, and following the Battle of Palembang all Allied personnel were evacuated from the island by 16 February. From 20 April 1942 to 1 May 1943 Hunter served as AOC, No. 221 (Bomber) Group, later No. 221 (Tactical) Group, then from 1 May 1943 to 5 October 1944 as AOC, No. 223 (Composite) Group, both based in India. Hunter received his third mention in despatches on 2 June 1943, and his fourth on 14 January 1944. After the end of the war, on 18 January 1946, Hunter reverted to the retired list, retaining the rank of Air Commodore. He died in Exeter, Devon, on 12 September 1966. Personal life Hunter married the Honourable Mrs. Pearson, widow of the Hon. Geoffrey Pearson, on 11 April 1918. Sporting activities Hunter was also a keen tennis player, competing at Wimbledon in the men's singles in 1924, 1927 and 1930. He was beaten in the first round in the first and third of these, but in 1927 defeated Anthony Wass Buzzard to progress to the second round, where he was beaten in straight sets by the French champion Jacques Brugnon. He also competed at Monte Carlo in 1928, but again did not progress through from the first round, being beaten by the Czech Friedrich Rohrer, who had represented his country at the 1924 Olympics. He fared better against his fellow officers, reaching the final of the RAF Singles Championship in 1925, only to be beaten by the title holder Flying Officer Charles Frederick Roupell. In 1930 he made it through to the third round. However he had the consolation of being RAF Doubles Champion, partnered with Squadron Leader Richard Saul, for several years.

The International Buster Keaton Society takes its name, The Damfinos, from this film. Plot Buster is married with two children (both of whom wear the porkpie hat made famous by Keaton). He has built a large boat he has christened Damfino inside his home. When he finishes and decides to take the boat out to sea, he discovers it is too large to fit through the door. Buster enlarges the opening a bit, but when he tows the boat out, it proves to be a bit bigger than he estimated, and the house completely collapses. Buster loses his car during the attempt to launch the boat. The boat passes with impunity under the exceedingly low bridges of the Venice (California) canals thanks to Buster's boat design. While out on the Pacific, Buster and his family are caught in a terrible storm. The boat is barely seaworthy to begin with, and it does not help that Buster nails a picture up inside the boat, causing an improbable leak, or when he further drills through the bottom of the boat to let the water out, resulting in a spectacular gusher of a leak. He radios a Morse Code call for help, but when the navy or coast guard operator asks who it is, he answers, \\"d-a-m-f-i-n-o\\" in Morse Code. The operator interprets it as \\"damn if I know\\" and dismisses the call as a prank. Taking to a ridiculously small dinghy that is in fact a bathtub, the family resign themselves to the fact that they will sink into the sea, only to discover that the water is in fact only two feet deep. After a short walk through the water Buster and his family happen upon a deserted beach in dark of night. \\"Where are we?\\" asks his wife (via an intertitle), to which Buster replies, \\"Damn if I know\\" (mouthing the words to the camera, no intertitle is used).

In 1401 he was one of the artists who participated in the contest that was held to design the North doors of the Baptistery, won by Lorenzo Ghiberti. In 1408 he was chosen as one of three sculptors to create one of the seated Evangelists (St. Mark) at the Florence Cathedral. The statue of St. Mark for the Florence Cathedral was completed in 1415 and is now housed at the Museo dell'Opera del Duomo in Florence.Pope-Hennessy, 273; Munman, 207 He was later active in both Venice and Bologna.

However, while under the rule of Japanese imperialism, the missionaries stopped managing the whole school system due to Shinto worship being enforced by the Japanese rulers. Thus, the school remained closed by the end of the Second World War. After Korea gained its independence from Japan in 1945, the school moved from Sunan and joined with the church headquarters Hoegi, Seoul; The move was completed in 1949. On the June 25, 1950, the Korean War forced the school to close again. After Seoul was won back in November 1951, the school was relocated to its current location at Gongdeok, Yangjoo, Gyeonggi (later renamed Seoul) and reopened. The school was also renamed Sahmyook College, and the minister James Lee was inaugurated as the first president. Applications Each January over 10,000 students apply at Sahmyook University.

He has performed throughout Europe, Asia, and North America. Biography Wolfgang Brendel grew up in Wiesbaden, where he took singing lessons with Rolff Sartorius during his time at the conservatory. In 1971, he debuted at the Pfalztheater in Kaiserslautern as Guglielmo in Cos√¨ fan tutte. His artistic home for the greater part of his career was the Bayerische Staatsoper in Munich, where in 1977 he became the youngest Kammers√§nger in the company's history. In some sense taking up the mantle of Josef Metternich, who had retired in 1971, Brendel established his primacy as the star Munich baritone of his era across an extraordinary range of roles, from Mozart (not only Guglielmo but Count Almaviva in Le nozze di Figaro, Papageno in Die Zauberfl√∂te, the title role in Don Giovanni) to Verdi (Germont in La traviata, Posa in Don Carlo, Renato in Un ballo in maschera, Carlo in La forza del destino, and di Luna in Il trovatore) and beyond. Already in 1973, he achieved acclaim as Pell√©as in a new production by Jean-Pierre Ponnelle of Debussy's Pell√©as et M√©lisande. Sabine Tomzig wrote in the Hamburger Abendblatt: \\"A discovery: the 25-year-old Munich baritone as Pelleas, a Gallic figure with that lightness and brightness of timbre that predestines him for a part that is usually sung by tenors\\" (\\"Eine Entdeckung: der 25j√§hrige M√ºnchener Bariton Wolfgang Brendel als Pelleas, ein romanischer Typ mit jener Leichtigkeit und Helligkeit des Timbres, das ihn f√ºr diese meist von Ten√∂ren gesungene Partie pr√§destiniert\\"). Early on the conductor Carlos Kleiber selected him to sing Germont, conducting him also in other roles (for example, Falke in Die Fledermaus; in later years, Brendel would graduate to Eisenstein). In these early years he also sang a variety of other roles, including Silvio in Pagliacci. Brendel began his Wagner career with Wolfram von Eschenbach in Tannh√§user. Over the years he would take on heavier Wagner roles (Amfortas in Parsifal, Holl√§nder in Der fliegende Holl√§nder), eventually singing Hans Sachs in Die Meistersinger von N√ºrnberg and adding Kurwenal in Tristan und Isolde to his repertoire in 2005. Other Verdi baritone roles included Ford in Falstaff, Miller in Luisa Miller, and the title roles in Simon Boccanegra, Nabucco and Macbeth. He performed the title role in Tchaikovsky's Eugene Onegin frequently but became perhaps most closely associated with a series of baritone roles in Richard Strauss operas‚ÄîMandryka in Arabella and Barak in Die Frau ohne Schatten -- that were particularly well-suited to him. (He has also performed the Music Master in Ariadne auf Naxos, Orest in Elektra, the Count in Capriccio, and Altair in Die √§gyptische Helena). He has also sung Puccini: Marcello in La boh√®me, Sharpless in Madama Butterfly, Rance in La fanciulla del West, and, most recently, Scarpia in Tosca. Brendel has performed on all the major opera stages in Germany (Hamburg State Opera, both the Deutsche Oper and the Staatsoper in Berlin, Dresden) and throughout Europe (Vienna, Milan, London, Paris, Bayreuth, Dresden, Amsterdam, Lisbon, Madrid), in Tokyo, and in the United States (New York, Chicago, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Dallas). Since Brendel's debut at the Metropolitan Opera in 1975, age 27, as Count Almaviva, he has sung 91 performances there through 2007 in Mozart (Papageno), Verdi (Germont, Miller), Wagner (Amfortas), Puccini (Sharpless), J. Strau√ü (Dr. Falke and Eisenstein), and R. Strauss (Mandryka, Barak, Count in Capriccio, Music Master, Altair). In his Andante on-line review of Brendel's Barak in the new production of Die Frau ohne Schatten in 2001, Paul Griffiths catches the essence of the baritone in so many of his roles: \\"Wolfgang Brendel is extraordinarily resourceful. With his subtle control of color and phrasing, he can suggest a man fiercely resolute, tired or ironically self-dismissive, yet always good and trustworthy. He sings with melodious ease: the entire part comes across as the man's natural mode of expression.\\" Brendel, for many years a professor of voice at the Munich Hochschule f√ºr Musik und Theater, as of fall, 2011, is Professor of Practice at the Jacobs School of Music, Indiana University, Bloomington, Indiana. In 1997 he was awarded the Cross of the Order of Merit of the Federal Republic of Germany. His most recent appearances have been as Scarpia, Mandryka, Sachs, Eisenstein, and Holl√§nder. Recordings While most of the studio recordings Brendel made are not currently available (e.g., I pagliacci, a German-language La boh√®me), a few are: Die Fledermaus (Previn, 1999), in which he is the Eisenstein, Schumann's Das Paradies und die Peri (Giulini, 1974), Brahms‚Äô Deutsches Requiem (Sinopoli), highlights of Die Zauberfl√∂te (Haitink; the complete recording is out of print), and two discs of arias (Orfeo). A good number of his live performances are documented on DVD and CD. He can be seen as the High Priest in Samson et Dalila (San Francisco, 1981), Papageno (Munich, 1983), Eugene Onegin (Chicago, 1985), Dr. Falke (Munich, 1987), Wolfram (Bayreuth, 1989), Sachs (Deutsche Oper Berlin, 1995), Mandryka (MET, 1995), and the Music Master in \\"Ariadne auf Naxos\\" (MET, 2003); there are also DVDs of his Posa (Barcelona, 1985) and Germont (Madrid, 1990) in limited circulation. He was featured in made-for-televisions films of two J. Strauss operettas: Eine Nacht in Venedig (1975) and Der Zigeunerbaron (1976). CDs in circulation of complete live performances - some quite rare - include: his Germont under Kleiber from at least two different Munich performances (1975 and 1977), a youthful Wolfram (Perugia, 1972) and Guglielmo (Munich, 1978), both under Sawallisch, Posa (Munich, 1977; San Francisco, 1979; Munich, 1983), Count Almaviva (Munich, 1983), Onegin (Vienna, 1988), Enrico (London, 1988), Amfortas (Milan, 1991; New York, 1995), di Luna (Munich, 1992), and Mandryka (Munich, 2001).

It was developed by Atari, Inc. and released in August 1979. It was the most popular version to date of the \\"Lunar Lander\\" concept, surpassing the prior Moonlander and numerous text-based games, and most later versions of the concept are based on this Atari version. The player controls a lunar landing module viewed from the side and attempts to land safely on the Moon. The player can rotate the module and burn fuel to fire a thruster, attempting to gently land on marked areas. The scenario resets after every successful landing or crash, with new terrain, until no fuel remains. Coins can be inserted at any time to buy more fuel. Development of the game began with the creation of a vector graphics engine by Atari after the release of the 1978 Cinematronics game Space Wars. Engine co-designer Howard Delman proposed using it to create a Lunar Lander game, a genre which dates to 1969. Delman and Rich Moore developed the game, which was Atari's first vector-based game and the first multiple-perspective video game, changing views to zoom in as the module approached the Moon. Lunar Lander sold 4,830 units, a moderate success, but was soon overtaken by the November 1979 Asteroids, and 300 Asteroids units were shipped in Lunar Lander-branded cabinets. Lunar Lander was one of the first two games to be registered with the United States Copyright Office, though the prior games in the genre kept the gameplay from being patented. Lunar Lander was included in an art installation at the Dublin Science Gallery. Gameplay Lunar Lander is a single-player game in the Lunar Lander subgenre in which the player attempts to land a lunar landing module on the Moon. The game is displayed using black and white vector graphics and depicts a side-on view of the terrain and the landing module. At the top of the screen, the player is given information on the module's speed, altitude, and fuel, along with the score and time spent in the game. The terrain is jagged and has only a few flat areas appropriate for landing. The player controls the orientation of the module and fires the thruster to steer the module safely to a landing area. The module is always displayed in the center of the screen, with the terrain scrolling beneath it as it travels horizontally, wrapping the single screen-width of terrain endlessly. Screenshot of gameplay; the lander is tilted to the right, and two safe landing areas are highlighted If the player successfully lands the module, they are awarded points based on how softly the module landed and the difficulty of the landing site and are awarded a small amount of fuel for good landings. The safe landing areas are highlighted with a flashing bonus multiplier, which is higher for smaller areas. If the module crashes‚Äîwhich happens if it is moving too fast, or rotated too far from vertical when it touches the ground, or landed on a not- flat area‚Äîthen a small number of points is awarded. When the lander gets close to the surface, the view changes to a close-up view of the lander. The player has a limited amount of fuel, which is consumed by controlling the module. Whether the player lands safely or crashes, the game starts another round with a different set of terrain and the player's remaining fuel. The game ends when the module touches the ground after running out of fuel. The game is controlled via two buttons that rotate the module left and right, a large handle that fires the thruster (proportionally to how hard it is pulled), and an \\"abort\\" button that rotates the module back to vertical and fires the thruster, burning a large amount of fuel in an attempt to stop the module from crashing. Each action uses fuel, and when the fuel runs out the module no longer responds to the controls. The game features four levels of difficulty which adjust the landing areas and module controls. The highest difficulty causes the module to continue rotating after it is turned until the player counters the rotation instead of only turning while the button is pressed. The player can adjust the game's difficulty at any time during play. Unlike other arcade games, Lunar Lander does not feature a time limit; instead, the game starts with a set amount of fuel and inserting additional quarters purchases more fuel, allowing indefinite gameplay. The amount of fuel gained per coin, including the initial game starting-coin, is adjustable by the operator to set levels ranging from 450 units to 5400 units. Development DEC GT40 graphics terminal running Moonlander The Lunar Lander concept was initially created in 1969 as a text-based game called Lunar, or alternately the Lunar Landing Game. Many further versions of the game were developed over the course of the next decade; by 1979 the style of game was collectively seen as its own subgenre. The first graphical version of the subgenre, Moonlander, was released in 1973 by DEC, which commissioned a real-time, graphical Lunar Lander game to demonstrate the capabilities of its new DEC GT40 graphics terminals. After the release of the 1977 Cinematronics vector graphics game Space Wars, Atari began work on their own vector graphics engine, in which the graphics are constructed by drawn lines instead of pixels like in the more standard raster graphics engines. The initial hardware design work was done by Cyan Engineering, Atari's research and development subsidiary. Once it built an initial hardware concept, the project was passed on to Atari employee Howard Delman, who enhanced the prototype engine into one that could be used by game designers. Once it was done, he proposed using the monochrome game engine for a Lunar Lander game. Delman had previously played Moonlander during a tour of NASA and had played one of the text-based Lunar Lander games in college. In Fall 1978 development of the game began, with Delman in charge of the hardware and Rich Moore, who had only been with Atari for a few months and who had also played a Lunar Lander game in college, focusing on the programming. Development began with Moore drawing out the game's graphics on graph paper, after which the pair wrote out the game's code on paper for typists to transcribe. Delman and Moore worked closely together, bouncing ideas off each other as Moore proposed programming designs and Delman iterated the hardware design. One point of contention in the development process was the difficulty of the game; Delman initially wanted the module to move as realistically as possible, but they determined that the result was almost impossible to play. As Delman noted in an interview in 2010, \\"even the real lunar landers had computer assist!\\" Eventually, they settled on including four difficulty levels, as compared to Moonlanders three, though Delman has referred to the hardest level as \\"one of the most painful difficulty spikes in gaming\\". Delman chose the large handle used to control the thruster: Atari initially planned to use a standard joystick, but he wanted a control with more physicality, including adding a rubber pad at the bottom to give players the impression that they could pull harder for a little more thrust. The thrust control has ten levels of thrust, as compared to the single on or off level of thrust in previous Lunar Landers, though Moore has noted that this gives players more incorrect options to choose from. The game's font was designed by Ed Logg and used for several other Atari vector graphics games. Several planned ideas had to be cut from the game during development. Delman has stated that chief among these was retaining a crater where the player's previous spaceships had crashed; it was cut as the new hardware could not draw enough lines fast enough to handle the detail. He also wanted to add in a McDonald's location easter egg, as was present in Moonlander. Over a year after development started, Lunar Lander was released in August 1979, just after the tenth anniversary of the first manned Moon landing, though Atari did not link this connection in its marketing of the game. Reception and legacy Lunar Lander proved moderately commercially successful, selling 4,830 cabinets. Cash Box noted in September 1979 that the machines were very popular with customers. It was Atari's first vector graphics game and the first multiple-perspective video game with the inclusion of the up-close view of the lander. Atari developed a two-player version of the game, but only two prototypes were ever made as it did not enter production. The two-player version was cancelled as Lunar Landers popularity was soon overtaken by Atari's Asteroids (November 1979), which used the same vector graphics engine and which had initially been based on Lunar Landers code. Atari ceased production early on Lunar Lander in favor of shipping Asteroids games in Lunar Lander cabinets; the first 300 Asteroids games were released with Lunar Lander artwork on the side. The Atari Lunar Lander was the most popular version to date of the \\"Lunar Lander\\" concept, surpassing the prior Moonlander and text-based games, and most later versions of the concept are implicitly or explicitly based on the Atari version. In 1977, Atari produced Star Ship for the Atari 2600, which contained several space-related games; one of these was titled Lunar Lander, though despite the name its gameplay involved landing on a surface while avoiding enemy spaceships instead of the gameplay of the arcade game. While Atari did not produce any true sequels or contemporary ports of the game, in 1980 Adventure International produced a version of the concept under the title Lunar Lander as part of a series of arcade game clones for the TRS-80 and Atari 8-bit computers, which, though featuring differences from the Atari version, was advertised as \\"an arcade game simulation\\". At least one other arcade game based on the Lunar Lander concept was developed around the same time, the non-vector graphics game Lunar Rescue by Taito. The Atari Lunar Lander has been included in several Atari compilation releases for various platforms starting in 2003, such as Atari: 80 Classic Games in One (2003, personal computer), the Atari Flashback 2 console (2005), Millipede / Super Breakout / Lunar Lander (2005, Game Boy Advance), Retro Atari Classics (2005, Nintendo DS), Atari Masterpieces (2005, N-Gage), Atari Classics Evolved (2007, PlayStation Portable), Atari Greatest Hits (2010, Nintendo DS, Android, iOS), and Atari Flashback Classics Volume 1 (2017, PlayStation 4, Xbox One). In 1980, Asteroids and Lunar Lander became the first two games to be registered in the United States Copyright Office, though Burness has claimed that Atari also attempted to patent the game design, which was rejected due to his prior Moonlander. In 2012, for the 40th anniversary of Atari's founding, it released a set of its early games as browser-based games as the \\"Atari Arcade\\"; Lunar Lander was one of the initial set of eight games. That same year, Lumen Prize- winner Seb Lee-Delisle presented his \\"Lunar Trails\\" art installation at the Science Gallery in Dublin, in which a machine draws out the cumulative paths taken by players of a Lunar Lander arcade game.

Released in 1971, the film was directed by Baird Bryant and Johanna Demetrakas. A young Gary Weis was among the cinematographers; other members of the camera and sound crew also went on to become famous in their fields, including Peter Smokler, Peter Pilafian, and Joan Churchill. The film was released in 2011 as a Region 1 DVD. The festival, one in an annual series of concerts held on the grounds of the Esalen Institute in Big Sur from 1964 to 1971, was held on the weekend of September 13‚Äì14, 1969, only one month after the famous and considerably larger Woodstock Music & Art Fair, which is referred to repeatedly. Celebration at Big Sur did not receive the same critical acclaim as the 1970 Woodstock film. Performances About 10‚Äì15,000 people camped out for three miles up and down Highway One for the two-day festival. The event audience was so well-mannered that those without the $4.00 admission price listened from the highway, even though there was no gate. The artists performed on a low stage behind a pool, backed by the Pacific Ocean. Musical performances dominate the film, with footage of surrounding occurrences interspersed into the music sequences. =Joan Baez= Baez was a Big Sur-festival regular whose folk music workshop at Esalen in 1965 helped attract pop/rock acts later to the festival. She is featured prominently throughout the film. Celebration begins with Baez opening the festival with Bob Dylan's \\"I Shall Be Released\\" and closes with her leading a large crowd in singing \\"Oh Happy Day\\" in the event's finale. She also sings two of her own compositions, \\"A Song for David\\" and \\"Sweet Sir Galahad\\", during the course of the film. =Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young= The film includes early footage of Neil Young, This is the earliest listed film appearance by Young. who had recently appeared at Woodstock with Crosby, Stills & Nash, but refused to be filmed. Here, fortified by session drummer Dallas Taylor and Motown bassist Greg Reeves, CSNY perform Young's \\"Sea of Madness\\" and \\"Down by the River\\". Perhaps the film's most famous scene is an altercation between Stephen Stills and a heckler. =Joni Mitchell= Mitchell, who did not appear at the Woodstock Festival, performs the song \\"Woodstock\\" prior to any album release, first attempting to teach the audience to sing the melodically complicated refrain. Ironically, Mitchell would later develop a well-known distaste for festival gigs, but in this performance her enthusiasm is evident. Mitchell talks about having spotted whales off the coast, and is generally seen with then-boyfriend Graham Nash of CSNY. She also sings \\"Get Together\\" with members of Crosby, Stills & Nash in a seemingly impromptu jam. Although Mitchell had made earlier televised appearances, this may be her earliest filmed performance. N.B.: fan site. =Others= In addition to CSNY, Baez and Mitchell, other performers featured in Celebration included John Sebastian, Dorothy Combs Morrison and The Combs Sisters, Mimi Fari√±a, Carol Ann Cisneros, Julie Payne, Chris Ethridge and The Struggle Mountain Resistance Band. While Ruthann Friedman, The Flying Burrito Brothers and The Incredible String Band performed at this event, they do not appear in the film.

It may have a loose plug or a valve at the bottom end. A tremie is used to pour concrete underwater in a way that avoids washout of cement from the mix due to turbulent water contact with the concrete while it is flowing. This produces a more reliable strength of the product. Common applications include the following. *Caissons, which are the foundations of bridges, among other things, that span bodies of water. * Pilings. * Monitoring wells. Builders use tremie methods for materials other than concrete, and for industries other than construction. For example, bentonite slurries for monitoring wells are often emplaced via tremie pipe.  Function  The tremie is often supported by a working platform above the water level. The pipe is made up of short sections commonly joined by screw thread with O-ring seal so that the length can be adjusted during the pour without getting the top of the pipe below the water or removing the bottom end from below the surface of the poured concrete. To facilitate management of pipe length it may be built up from 1 to 3.5m sections. A foam rubber 'pig' may be used to plug the pipe while introducing the first batch of concrete. The tremie concrete placement method uses a vertical or nearly vertical pipe, through which concrete is placed by gravity feed below water level. The lower end of the pipe is kept immersed in fresh concrete so that concrete rising from the bottom displaces the water, thus limiting washing out of the cement content of the fresh concrete to the exposed upper surface. The upper end of the tremie pipe is kept above the water level during the pour and is provided with a conical hopper for batch loading, or concrete may be pumped into the top of the tremie pipe. Concrete must be poured at a rate which avoids setting in the tremie. Admixtures may be used to control setting time, slump and workability. Vibration and jerking of the pipe may be applied to encourage slumping and levelling of the upper surface of the pour, and the tremie may need to be raised occasionally during the pour so that the bottom end is not too deeply embedded, but the pipe must not be moved sufficiently to break clear of the mound and expose the bottom opening to the water, as this would allow washout of cement. Placement To start placement, the tremie pipe is first lowered into position. Air and water must be kept out of the tremie during placement by keeping the pipe full of concrete at all times. This is facilitated if the hopper capacity is at least equal to the volume of the pipe. When initially charging the tremie a wad of empty cement bags or a foam rubber plug known as a pig may be stuffed into the pipe to keep the flow under control while the first concrete forces the plug down the pipe and displaces the water. The pig will float out and rise to the surface. The discharge opening must be kept well immersed in the placed concrete, allowing flow from within the placement. of embedment should be maintained as a minimum if possible. This can be measured by finding the level of the concrete surface below the top of the pipe with a weighted tape and subtracting from the known length of the tremie. It is critically important to concrete quality that the tremie discharge remains well embedded in the concrete. As the pour progresses, if flow slows or stops, the discharge opening is raised so that the head in the pipe can maintain flow. Continuous flow is desirable if possible. If it is necessary to move the tremie laterally, it is better to lift it out vertically, plug it and start a new pour at the new position than to drag it sideways through freshly placed concrete. If the area of the pour is too large to manage from a single point, it is better to use several tremies in parallel than to shift a single tremie around. A spacing between tremies of between 3.5 and 5m, and a distance of about 2.5m from the formwork has been recommended. The risk of segregation and uneven setting can be minimised by providing a continuous flow of concrete through all the tremies to maintain a moderately even surface. Concrete Concrete for tremie placement should have a very high slump of about 150 mm to 200 mm.

A year later, the station converted to an oldies format as WXGL-FM. Atlantic Coast Radio purchased the station in 1999, and in January 2000, the station switched to an adult album alternative format as WCLZ. A few months later, WCLZ adopted a sports talk format, initially as a simulcast of WJAE (the descendant of WJAB); the next year, the station took the call letters WJJB-FM. On August 25, 2008, WLOB-FM was converted to a simulcast of WJJB (which WJAE had become by that time), resulting in WLOB's programming being heard only on the AM signal. This was part of a shuffle of Atlantic Coast Radio's FM stations as a result of the conversion of two of its stations, including WJJB-FM, on September 1, 2008 to simulcasts of WEEI. Shortly after the completion of these format changes, 95.5's call letters were changed to WGEI (it had initially planned to use the WTEI call sign, and for a week in September 2008 used the WUEI call letters). On April 1, 2009, WGEI converted to a simulcast of WLOB; it became WLOB-FM a few days later. In August 2011, WLOB-FM returned to simulcasting WEEI. On September 7, 2011, WLOB-FM changed their call letters to WPPI.

The Seljuk forces attacked the Byzantine army a number of times to no effect; having suffered losses to his army in the course of these attacks, Malik Shah sued for peace. Background Following the success of the First Crusade, the Byzantine armed forces, led by John Doukas the megas doux, reconquered the Aegean coastline and much of the interior of western Anatolia. However, after the failure of the Crusade of 1101, the Seljuq and Danishmend Turks resumed their offensive operations against the Byzantines. Following their defeats, the Seljuqs under Malik Shah had recovered control of central Anatolia, re-consolidating a viable state around the city of Iconium. Emperor Alexios I Komnenos, aged and suffering from an illness which proved to be terminal, was unable to prevent Turkish raids into the recovered areas of Byzantine Anatolia, though an attempt to take Nicaea in 1113 was thwarted by the Byzantines. In 1116 Alexios was able to personally take the field and was engaged in defensive operations in northwest Anatolia. Basing his army at Lopadion, and later at Nicomedia, he succeeded in defeating raiding Turks in a minor battle at Poemanenon.Birkenmeier, p.78 After receiving reinforcements to his army Alexios decided to move onto the offensive.Birkenmeier, p.79 Byzantine advance to Philomelion Emperor Alexios I In the campaign of Philomelion Alexios led a sizeable Byzantine army deep into the Anatolian interior. Anna Komnene, the primary source for the campaign, implies that the Seljuq capital of Iconium was the goal of the expedition, but evidently Alexios abandoned this plan and contented himself with staging a conspicuous show of force and evacuating the native Christian population from the Turkish dominated areas his army passed through.Komnene, ed. Sewter (1969), p.481 The Byzantines were to employ a new battle formation of Alexios' devising, the parataxis. Anna Komnene's description of this formation is so imprecise as to be useless.Komnene, ed. Sewter (1969), pp. 479-480 However, from her account of the army in action the nature of the parataxis is revealed; it was a defensive formation, a hollow square with the baggage in the centre, infantry on the outside and cavalry in-between, from whence they could mount attacks.Birkenmeier, p.79 An ideal formation for tackling the fluid Turkish battle tactics, reliant on swarm attacks by horse-archers. A similar formation was later employed by Richard I of England at the Battle of Arsuf. The Byzantines moved through Santabaris, sending detachments via Polybotos and Kedros, and, after dispersing Turkish resistance, took Philomelion by assault. Parties of scouts were then sent out to round up the local Christian population for evacuation to areas under firm Byzantine control.Komnene, ed. Sewter (1969), p.483Birkenmeier, p.79 Battle Alexios became aware that a substantial Seljuq army was approaching from the north and began his retreat to his own territory. His army resumed its defensive formation with the civilians accompanying the baggage in the centre. The Turks, under an officer called Manalugh, were initially baffled by the Byzantine formation and did not attack with any vigour. However, the following day Sultan Malik Shah arrived and the Byzantines were attacked in earnest.Komnene, ed. Sewter (1969), p.484-485 The Turks mounted a simultaneous attack on the van and rear of the Byzantine army. The Byzantine cavalry made two counterattacks, the first seems to have been unsuccessful.Komnene, ed. Sewter (1969), p.485 A further counterattack was more fortunate, led by Nikephoros Bryennios the Younger (Anna Komnene's husband and Alexios' son-in-law) the leader of the Byzantine right wing, it broke that part of the Turkish force led in person by the Sultan, which then turned to flight. Malik Shah narrowly escaped capture.Komnene, ed. Sewter (1969), p.486 The Seljuqs then made a night attack, but the Byzantine dispositions again frustrated them. The following day Malik Shah again attacked, his troops completely surrounding the Byzantine army on all sides. The Turks were once more repulsed with loss, having achieved nothing. The next day Malik-Shah sent to Alexios with proposals for peace.Komnene, ed. Sewter (1969), pp.486-487Birkenmeier, p.79 footnote Aftermath Alexios and Malik Shah met, Alexios throwing his own costly cloak around the sultan's shoulders. A peace involving an undertaking by Malik Shah to stop Turkish raiding and an admission by the sultan of some measure of, largely theoretical, dependence on the Byzantine emperor was made. Anna Komnene records that the peace treaty involved an undertaking by Malik Shah to evacuate Anatolia, but this is unlikely in the extreme and must represent hyperbole on her part.Komnene pp. 487-488 The campaign was remarkable for the high level of discipline shown by the Byzantine army. Alexios had demonstrated that he could march his army with impunity through Turkish dominated territory.Birkenmeier, pp. 79-80 The reverse suffered by Malik Shah at Philomelion and the consequent loss of prestige probably contributed to his demise as he was soon deposed, blinded and eventually murdered by his brother Mas'ud.Komnene, pp. 488-491 Alexios' death in 1118 meant that the ambition of reconquering all of Asia Minor was left to his 31-year-old son, John II Komnenos.

Titterton George F. Titterton (19 August 1904 in New York City, New York ‚Äì 12 January 1998)U.S. Social Security Death Index at FamilySearch.org was a design engineer and Senior Vice- President of the Grumman Corporation.  Personal life  Titterton married Ada Ryan on October 6, 1929.  Career history  After graduating from New York University in 1925 with a degree in Mechanical Engineering, George remained as an instructor in Engineering for a year. He then joined the Navy Bureau of Aeronautics in Washington, D.C. George became a Consulting Engineer in 1927, specializing in structural analysis of commercial airplanes. During this period, he authored 15 articles for Aviation magazine which were later published in book form under the title, Airplane stress analysis: an introductory treatise.Grumman Plane News, January 14, 1955 In early 1928, George joined Keystone Aircraft and later assumed the position of Chief Engineer for Huntington Aircraft in Stratford, Connecticut where he designed and built two small commercial airplanes. In 1931, George was employed by the Navy Inspection Office as an Aeronautical Engineer stationed at the General Inspector of Naval Aircraft Office in New York City. In 1933, he became the resident inspector for the U.S. Navy at the Navy Aircraft Office located at Grumman Aircraft,Jimmy Collins' Last Test Flight by Corky Meyer (1998) then in Farmingdale, New York. In this capacity, Mr. Titterton was a \\"watchdog\\" for the Navy's interests and created numerous memos documenting suggestions for improvement in the Grumman production process as was (and still is) typical of a government agency overseeing its contractors.The Grumman Story p96 During his three-year stay there, he was awarded a degree in Aeronautical Engineering by New York University. Mr. Titterton joined Grumman on April 1, 1936, as a Project Engineer. His first assignment, much to the amusement of Grumman founders Roy Grumman and Bill Schwendler, was to address a rather large stack of Navy complaint memos which he himself wrote. The following year he wrote his second book Aircraft Materials and Processes published by Pittman and Company. This second book is still used as reference materials in various countries in order to obtain a commercial aviation license.Directorate General of Civil Aviation of India web site During his early years at Grumman, Titterton was the project engineer for both of Grumman's Gulfhawk models. He was appointed Assistant Chief Engineer in Charge of Production Airplanes in 1939 and in 1950 took on the duties of Contract Coordinator. In April 1955, he was named Assistant Vice President and in October the same year was promoted to Vice President ‚Äì Contracts. Six years later, George was named Vice President ‚Äì Program Management with responsibility for the executive direction of all contracts. In 1963, after leading in negotiating the contract with NASA to build the Lunar Excursion Module, he became Senior Vice President ‚Äì Operations with responsibilities varying in time and breadth for all aircraft, spacecraft, and marine programs.Grumman Plane News, December 23, 1968 As a member of the \\"Top Management Review Board\\" for the Apollo Lunar Module project,Grumman Corporation's Apollo Extension Systems Management Plan Volume VII Mr. Titterton was influential in its engineering design decisions.Inside the Iron Works: How Grumman's Glory Days Faded pp.85-94 When the first delivery of the lunar module did not meet NASA quality standards, George replaced Tom Kelly as overall project manager for Grumman Corporation's Lunar Excursion Module contract with NASA.Moon Lander: How We Built The Apollo Lunar Module by Thomas J. Kelly (2001) pp. 165-168 George's reputation for correcting large production problems with complex projects at Grumman made him the ideal choice to ensure the success of the Apollo Lunar Module project and he did so. Around this time, George created 100 copies of a hardcover book entitled Alibis That Stuck containing one page, upon which was written \\"There ain't none\\".Frank Pullo Mirror on Eric Hartwell's InfobabbleGrumman Plane News, December 1969 This book was distributed to Grumman employees at the plant. Finally, in the end of 1968, Mr. Titterton retired from Grumman, remaining as a member of its board of directors for several years afterward. George joined the Grumman retirees club and toured the country speaking at retiree club functions until a few years before his death in 1998.

South Africa resumed official international cricket in 1991 when the team made a short tour of India. It then played in the 1992 Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. All of the matches played during the rebel tours had been granted first-class status, but this was subsequently and controversially withdrawn by the ICC in 1993. In August 2007, the ICC was reviewing the status of all matches played in South Africa between 1961 and 1991, including those played during the rebel tours, with a view to restoring first-class status to some matches.

He is credited as the first African American to receive the Ph.D. degree from Boston University, which was granted in 1887. Biography =Early life= Bowen was born in New Orleans, Louisiana, on December 3, 1855, the son of Edward Bowen and Rose Simon Bowen. Edward Bowen, a carpenter, was originally from Maryland and later lived in Washington, D.C., but moved to New Orleans, where he was enslaved and held in bondage until he purchased his own freedom. In 1858, he purchased freedom for his wife and son, then three years old. Edward Bowen later served in the Union Army during the Civil War. Rose Simon Bowen was the granddaughter of an African princess of the Jolloffer tribe on the west coast of Africa. (This information comes from a one-page anonymous biographical sketch of Bowen while he was still living). =Education= J. W. E. Bowen Sr., c. 1880s J. W. E. Bowen III, c. 1927. After the Civil War, J. W. E. Bowen studied at the Union Normal School in New Orleans, and New Orleans University, a university established by the Methodist Episcopal Church for the education of freedmen. (New Orleans University merged with Straight College in 1934 to form Dillard University) Bowen received a Bachelor of Arts degree with the university's first graduating class in 1878. From 1878 to 1882, he taught mathematics, Latin and Greek at Central Tennessee College (later known as Walden University (Tennessee)) in Nashville. In 1882, Bowen began theological studies at Boston University. While a theological student, he was the pastor of Revere Street Methodist Episcopal Church in Boston, Massachusetts. In 1884, he completed work on, and was awarded, a Master of Arts (M.A.) degree from New Orleans University. When he completed the requirements for the Bachelor of Sacred Theology (S.T.B.) degree from Boston University in 1885, his classmates selected him as one of two students to speak at commencement exercises. After graduation, Bowen became pastor of St. John's Methodist Episcopal Church in Newark, New Jersey. He received a Master of Arts degree from New Orleans University in 1886. He married Ariel Serena Hedges of Baltimore, Maryland in 1886. They became the parents of four children. In that same year, Bowen entered the Ph.D. program at Boston University in historical theology. He also did special advanced work in Greek, Latin, Hebrew, Chaldee, Arabic, and German, and in metaphysics and psychology. Boston University conferred the Ph.D. degree upon him in 1887. Later, Gammon Theological Seminary made him its first recipient of the honorary degree of doctor of divinity. =Baltimore and Washington D.C. years= Bowen was chiefly a pastor after completing his doctoral degree. He pastored the Centennial Methodist Episcopal Church in Baltimore and also served as a professor of church history and systematic theology at Morgan College. A gifted preacher, Bowen conducted a notable revival during this pastorate in which there were 735 conversions. Bowen also served as pastor of Asbury Methodist Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C. and as a professor of Hebrew at Howard University. From 1889 to 1893, Bowen was a member and examiner for the American Institute of Sacred Literature. In 1892, he published \\"What Shall the Harvest Be? A National Sermon; or A Series of Plain Talks to the Colored People of America, on Their Problems.\\" He represented the Methodist Episcopal church at the Conferences of World Methodism in Washington D.C. in 1891 and London in 1901. =Years at Gammon Theological Seminary= In 1893, Bowen became professor of historical theology at Gammon Theological Seminary in Atlanta, Georgia, a seminary founded in 1883 by the Methodist Episcopal Church for the preparation of African-American clergymen. He was the first African-American to teach there full-time. As the secretary of Gammon's Stewart Missionary Foundation for Africa, he also edited its periodical, the Stewart Missionary Magazine. In October, 1895, Bowen delivered \\"An Appeal to the King\\" on \\"Negro Day\\" at the Atlanta Cotton States' Exposition. That December, he organized an important three-day conference on Africa held in conjunction with the exposition and published its proceedings as \\"Africa and the American Negro...Addresses and Proceedings of the Congress on Africa Held Under the Auspices of the Stewart Missionary Foundation for Africa of Gammon Theological Seminary in Connection with the Cotton States and International Exposition December 13‚Äì15, 1895\\" (1896). As a member of the Board of Control of the Methodist Episcopal Church's Epworth League, he organized a national conference in Atlanta on the Christian education of African-American youth. With Irvine Garland Penn, Bowen also edited and published its proceedings, \\"The United Negro:‚Ä¶Addresses and Proceedings, The Negro Young People's Christian and Educational Congress,\\" held on August 6-11, 1902 (1902). In January 1904, Bowen and Jesse Max Barber launched The Voice of the Negro, a Literary journal addressed to a national audience of African Americans. In September, 1905, they endorsed the Niagara Movement. Months later, they promoted the organization of the Georgia Equal Rights League, which had similar objectives. At the peak of its circulation in 1906, The Voice of the Negro claimed 12,000 to 15,000 subscribers. In 1906, Bowen became the President of Gammon. In September, however, his inaugural year was shadowed by a severe race riot in which white rioters brutally attacked black people in Atlanta. Bowen opened the seminary to shelter black refugees from the riot. Three days after the rioting began, he was beaten and arrested by Atlanta's white police. Barber fled the city, taking The Voice of the Negro with him to Chicago, where he continued its publication for a year without Bowen's assistance. Bowen survived the Atlanta race riot and served as Gammon's President until 1910. Bowen retired as head of the church history department of Gammon in 1926 but continued to teach until 1932, when he became an emeritus professor. Bowen and his first wife, Ariel Serena Hedges Bowen, were the parents of four children. One of the children, John W.E. Bowen Jr., graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy, Wesleyan University and Harvard University. He became, like his father, a prominent figure in the Methodist Episcopal church, and was elected a bishop in 1949. Bowen's first wife died in 1904 while visiting the World's Fair in St. Louis, Missouri. In 1906 he married Irene L. Smallwood, who survived him. Bowen died on July 20, 1933, the last of his New Orleans University graduating class and the school's oldest alumnus. \\"Who has not heard of John Wesley Edward Bowen, who was born in New Orleans in 1855, educated there and at Boston University and has worked at Morgan, Howard and Gammon? For twenty-five years while at Gammon he has been the kind of upstanding figure in the Methodist Episcopal Church which has made that church hesitate to get rid of him and his kind.\\" (W. E. B.

(2005) Courage and Innovation: The Story of the Lord Corporation, Albrecht & Associates, As of October 30, 2019, the company has been acquired by Parker Hannifin.  History  In 1919, Hugh C. Lord, a patent attorney in Erie, Pennsylvania, began exploring the potential of bonding rubber-to-metal to isolate and control shock, noise and vibration. This led to the founding of the LORD Corporation, in addition to inventions such as chemical formulations, bonding processes, elastomers, adhesives, coatings and bonded elastomer assemblies. During the 1920s, General Electric used LORD manufactured mounts for trolley cars. Lincoln and Nash Motors automobiles also began to use LORD engine mountings. LORD was trademarked, leading to the creation of the LORD Manufacturing Company. The company's instrument panel mounts were also used by airplane manufacturers in order to lengthen service life. In the 1940s, the LORD Manufacturing Company was incorporated. The company would supply engine mounts to many aircraft manufacturers. Mountings for railroad cars and buses were manufactured and LORD produced the first ever elastomeric transmission parts and engine isolators(also known as bushings) for helicopters. Elastomeric compounds are also developed by LORD as substitutes for natural rubber for the Korean War in the 1950s. To isolate aircraft cowlings, cowl mountings and motor-nose supports were manufactured. LORD developed the outboard motor mounting for the marine industry, Chemlok adhesives, and the snubbing skirt mounting for heavy equipment installations.Courage and Innovation: the story of LORD Corporation, 1924 to 2002.

Currently he is an assistant coach of the Greek national football team. He represented Bahrain during the Asian Games in 1974. He became a coach, and managed the Bahrain national football team for a period of time. With a deal between the Bahrain and Pakistan on closer cooperation on football, he took charge of the Pakistan national football team from late 2005 with his first assignment being the South Asian Football Federation Gold Cup 2005. Sharida employed attacking tactics and won his first match, with a 1-0 victory against Sri Lanka. This was followed by a win and a draw against Afghanistan and the Maldives respectively. In the semis, Pakistan lost to Bangladesh 1-0. Within two weeks of the defeat, Sharida had to face Bangladesh again over two legs for the 2007 AFC Asian Cup qualification in a pre-qualifying round, losing 1-0 on aggregate. Sri Lanka pulled out of the Asian Cup qualification, meaning Pakistan were given the spot instead. Pakistan were placed in Group C alongside Jordan, Oman and UAE. He with the PFF arranged a friendly against Palestine before the first match with Jordan. Pakistan lost both the friendly and the qualifier. In April, Pakistan played in the 2006 AFC Challenge Cup in Group D. He helped create an upset when Pakistan beat Kyrgyzstan 1-0, curtsy of a Muhammad Essa goal. They were unable to repeat that feat against Tajikistan, and then needing a win against one of the weakest teams in Asia to qualify, they were unable to beat Macao with the match ending 2-2. Despite the inconsistency shown, it was an improvement on previous performances by the national team. Between August and September, Pakistan fell to two heavy defeats in the Asia Cup qualifiers against Oman. They then lost to Jordan 3-0. In the final qualifier against the UAE in November, Sharida still stuck with the attacking football and Pakistan took a surprise lead thanks to Naveed Akram. After the break, UAE levelled and then took the lead, but Pakistan hit back with a Tanveer Ahmed header. Though they eventually lost 3-2, it was seen as a good result for Pakistan. Just after that, he coached Pakistan in the 2006 Asian Games. There they lost to Japan 3-2, then lost to North Korea 1-0 and finally fell to another loss, this time to Syria 2-0. As Pakistan were expected to lose heavily to all three teams, this was seen as another step up. Their spirited attacking game that Sharida introduced was allowing Pakistan to become more competitive. In 2007, he was to coach Pakistan for the Olympic Preliminaries against Singapore. Singapore were favourates to go through to the next round, but Pakistan defeated them 2-1 in the away leg and then came from 2-0 down to beat them 3-2 at home. However, just before the first qualifying group stage matches, his relationship with the PFF turned sour when a pay dispute caused Salman to return to Bahrain, with just under 2 years of his contract remaining. He now managed Muharraq Club and coached them to win AFC Cup 2008. He then managed the Al-Arabi club in Umm al-Quwain, UAE. He has signed as the coach of the Bahraini national team. In April 2018, he was one of the applicants for the vacant Cameroon national team job.

It tells the story of a hotshot mech pilot in a post-apocalyptic 2041 who must stop mech hijackers from provoking global war. It is sometimes referred to as a sequel to Robot Jox. However, while both films came from the same production company and have similar themes (giant robot battles), their storylines are unrelated. Of note is that the venerable actor Danny Kamekona plays different characters in both movies.  Plot  By 2041, North America has been ravaged by \\"the great toxic gas scare of 1993\\": large swaths of land have been turned into inhospitable desert, where bands of raiders called \\"Centros\\" attack transports. The former United States have been assimilated into a Western bloc called the North Hemi. The opposing Eastern bloc is known as the Eastern Alliance, and the North Hemi is planning to salvage its economy by manufacturing defense robots called \\"mini- megs\\" for the Eastern Alliance. These robots would be smaller offshoots of giant \\"mega-robots\\", once ubiquitous in warfare but now reduced to a single specimen, the MRAS-2 (which looks like a mechanized scorpion). MRAS-2 conducts tours for civilians, and carries laser assault weapons to defend itself. It is operated by Drake (Don Michael Paul) and his copilot Stumpy (James Staley). During a transport run, Drake's mech is ambushed by Centros. Drake opts for a defensive strategy, but his boss Rooney orders him to attack so he can show off the robot to general Wa-Lee (Danny Kamekona), a visiting dignitary from the Eastern Alliance sent to negotiate the purchase of the mini-megs. The violent rocking motions of the mech during the battle cause an archaeologist passenger, Leda (Barbara Crampton), to drop and break her valuable specimens. When Drake brings the robot to port, Leda angrily confronts him about the specimens, but he dismisses her with flirtatious remarks. Drake is summoned to Rooney's office, and shows him a recovered Centro weapon which appears to be of Eastern alliance origin. Drake deduces that the Eastern alliance is conspiring with the Centros, but Rooney disbelieves him. Drake pressures Rooney to stop the MRAS-2 tours to avoid risking more lives, and when his boss refuses, Drake vows to quit piloting the robot. Meanwhile, Leda has met with her journalist friend Anne, and exposes some suspicious activity going on in Crystal Vista, a perfectly preserved 20th-century town that survived the toxic gas scare: the town is built on a layer of 21st-century materials which are impenetrable to satellite imaging, and she has found components similar to those of the old MEGA-1 robot, which was supposedly dismantled. Later, Wa-Lee holds a traditional fighting ceremony and invites Drake, who apparently has long-standing animosity against him, to fight. Drake accepts, and knocks Wa- Lee down before the battle begins proper, cementing the tension between them. Drake then makes good on his promise to Rooney and gives up pilot duty to volunteer for a special op against the Centros; there he recovers more Eastern-manufactured equipment. Despite Drake's insistence that the MRAS-2 is under threat from Centros, Rooney allows the tour to proceed, and even has Wa- Lee taught how to pilot the robot as a courtesy. At a bar later on, Stumpy tells Drake that his grandfather was part of an effort to hide MEGA-1. Meanwhile, Leda and Anne have ridden the MRAS-2 to Crystal Vista. There, they go underground through the basement of a schoolhouse, and find the micron transponders of the MEGA-1. Anne returns to catch the MRAS-2 return trip, while Leda stays behind to continue the investigation. Suddenly, Centros appear and chase Leda. She escapes for a while, and the rest of the Centros head for the Crystal Vista robot port. There, they join Wa-Lee's officers in a mutiny and kill the North Hemi security, proving Drake right about the Eastern alliance's duplicity. Wa-Lee hijacks the MRAS-2, taking the passengers hostage, and begins destroying strategic targets. Rooney pleads with Drake and Stumpy to retake the robot, and they agree upon learning that the Centros have captured Leda. The general heads for Crystal Vista to kill Drake, who has freed Leda, found the MEGA-1 intact, reactivated it and is now piloting it. The two robots meet in the desert and begin fighting. Drake removes the MRAS-2's cabin, saving the passengers, and eventually manages to subdue the general. The film ends happily as he and Leda admit their attraction to each other.

Pharmacological receptor models preceded accurate knowledge of receptors by many years. John Newport Langley and Paul Ehrlich introduced the concept of a receptor that would mediate drug action at the beginning of the 20th century. Alfred Joseph Clark was the first to quantify drug-induced biological responses (using an equation described f-mediated receptor activation. So far, nearly all of the quantitative theoretical modelling of receptor function has centred on ligand-gated ion channels and GPCRs. History =The receptor concept= In 1901, Langley challenged the dominant hypothesis that drugs act at nerve endings by demonstrating that nicotine acted at sympathetic ganglia even after the degeneration of the severed preganglionic nerve endings.Langley J. On the stimulation and paralysis of nerve cells and of nerve-endings. Part 1. J Physiol 1901 October 16; 27(3): 224‚Äì236. In 1905 he introduced the concept of a receptive substance on the surface of skeletal muscle that mediated the action of a drug. It also postulated that these receptive substances were different in different species (citing the fact that nicotine-induced muscle paralysis in mammals was absent in crayfish).J. N. Langley. On the reaction of cells and of nerve-endings to certain poisons, chiefly as regards the reaction of striated muscle to nicotine and to curare. J Physiol 1905; 33: 374‚Äì413. Around the same time, Ehrlich was trying to understand the basis of selectivity of agents. He theorized that selectivity was the basis of a preferential distribution of lead and dyes in different body tissues. However, he later modified the theory in order to explain immune reactions and the selectivity of the immune response. Thinking that selectivity was derived from interaction with the tissues themselves, Ehrlich envisaged molecules extending from cells that the body could use to distinguish and mount an immune response to foreign objects. However, it was only when Ahlquist showed the differential action of adrenaline demonstrated its effects on two distinct receptor populations, did the theory of receptor-mediated drug interactions gain acceptance.L.E. Limbird (2005) Cell Surface Receptors: A Short Course on Theory and Methods. 3rd Edition Springer =Nature of receptor‚Äìdrug interactions= Receptor occupancy model The receptor occupancy model, which describes agonist and competitive antagonists, was built on the work of Langley, Hill, and Clark. The occupancy model was the first model put forward by Clark to explain the activity of drugs at receptors and quantified the relationship between drug concentration and observed effect. It is based on mass-action kinetics and attempts to link the action of a drug to the proportion of receptors occupied by that drug at equilibrium.E.M Ross, and T.P. Kenakin. (2001) Pharmacodynamics. Mechanisms of drug action and the relationship between drug concentration and effect. In Goodman & Gilman‚Äôs The Pharmacological Basis of Therapeutics, Vol. Tenth. J.G. Hardman & L.E. Limbird, Eds. McGraw-Hill. New York. In particular, the magnitude of the response is directly proportional to the amount of drug bound, and the maximum response would be elicited once all receptors were occupied at equilibrium. He applied mathematical approaches used in enzyme kinetics systematically to the effects of chemicals on tissues. He showed that for many drugs, the relationship between drug concentration and biological effect corresponded to a hyperbolic curve, similar to that representing the adsorption of a gas onto a metal surface and fitted the Hill‚ÄìLangmuir equation. Clark, together with Gaddum, was the first to introduce the log concentration‚Äìeffect curve and described the now-familiar 'parallel shift' of the log concentration‚Äìeffect curve produced by a competitive antagonist. Attempts to separate the binding phenomenon and activation phenomenon were made by Ari√´ns in 1954 and by Stephenson in 1956 to account for the intrinsic activity (efficacy) of a drug (that is, its ability to induce an effect after binding). Classic occupational models of receptor activation failed to provide evidence to directly support the idea that receptor occupancy follows a Langmuir curve as the model assumed leading to the development of alternative models to explain drug behaviour. =Competitive inhibition models= The development of the classic theory of drug antagonism by Gaddum, Schild and Arunlakshana built on the work of Langley, Hill and Clark.D. Colquhoun, The relation between classical and cooperative models for drug action. In: H.P. Rang, Editor, Drug Receptors, Macmillan Press (1973), pp. 149‚Äì182. http://www.ucl.ac.uk/Pharmacology/dc- bits/colquhoun-1973.pdf Gaddum described a model for the competitive binding of two ligands to the same receptor in short communication to the Physiological Society in 1937. The description referred only to binding, it was not immediately useful for the analysis of experimental measurements of the effects of antagonists on the response to agonists. It was Heinz Otto Schild who made measurement of the equilibrium constant for the binding of an antagonist possible. He developed the Schild equation to determine a dose ratio, a measure of the potency of a drug. In Schild regression, the change in the dose ratio, the ratio of the EC50 of an agonist alone compared to the EC50 in the presence of a competitive antagonist as determined on a dose response curve used to determine the affinity of an antagonist for its receptor. =Agonist models= The flaw in Clark's receptor-occupancy model was that it was insufficient to explain the concept of a partial agonist. This led to the development of agonist models of drug action by Ariens in 1954 and by Stephenson in 1956 to account for the intrinsic activity (efficacy) of a drug (that is, its ability to induce an effect after binding). =Two-state receptor theory= The two-state model is a simple linear model to describe the interaction between a ligand and its receptor, but also the active receptor (R*). The model uses an equilibrium dissociation constant to describe the interaction between ligand and receptor. It proposes that ligand binding results in a change in receptor state from an inactive to an active state based on the receptor's conformation. A receptor in its active state will ultimately elicit its biological response. It was first described by Black and Leff in 1983 as an alternative model of receptor activation.J.W. Black and P. Leff. (1983) Operational Models of Pharmacological Agonism. In: Proc. R. Soc. London Ser. B 220, pp. 141‚Äì162. Similar to the receptor occupancy model, the theory originated from earlier work by del Castillo & Katz on observations relating to ligand-gated ion channels. In this model, agonists and inverse agonists are thought to have selective binding affinity for the pre-existing resting and active states or can induce a conformational change to a different receptor state. Whereas antagonists have no preference in their affinity for a receptor state. The fact that receptor conformation (state) would affect binding affinity of a ligand was used to explain a mechanism of partial agonism of receptors by del Castillo & Katz in 1957 was based on their work on the action of acetylcholine at the motor endplate build on similar work by Wyman & Allen in 1951 on conformational-induced changes in hemoglobin's oxygen binding affinity occurring as a result of oxygen binding. The del Castillo- Katz mechanism divorces the binding step (that can be made by agonists as well as antagonists) from the receptor activation step (that can be only exerted by agonists), describing them as two independent events. =Ternary complex model= The original Ternary complex model was used to describe ligand, receptor, and G-protein interactions. It uses equilibrium dissociation constants for the interactions between the receptor and each ligand (Ka for ligand A; Kb for ligand B), as well as a cooperativity factor (Œ±) that denotes the mutual effect of the two ligands on each other's affinity for the receptor. An Œ± > 1.0 refers to positive allosteric modulation, an Œ± < 1.0 refers to negative allosteric modulation, and an Œ± = 1.0 means that binding of either ligand to the receptor does not alter the affinity of the other ligand for the receptor (i.e., a neutral modulator). Further, the Œ± parameter can be added as a subtle but highly useful extension to the ATCM in order to include effects of an allosteric modulator on the efficacy (as distinct from the affinity) of another ligand that binds the receptor, such as the orthosteric agonist. Some ligands can reduce the efficacy but increase the affinity of the orthosteric agonist for the receptor. Although it is a simple assumption that the proportional amount of an active receptor state should correlate with the biological response, the experimental evidence for receptor overexpression and spare receptors suggests that the calculation of the net change in the active receptor state is a much better measure for response than is the fractional or proportional change. This is demonstrated by the effects of agonist/ antagonist combinations on the desensitization of receptors. This is also demonstrated by receptors that are activated by overexpression, since this requires a change between R and R* that is difficult to understand in terms of a proportional rather than a net change, and for the molecular model that fits with the mathematical model.Optimal Agonist/Antagonist Combinations Maintain Receptor Response by Preventing Rapid Œ≤-adrenergic Receptor Desensitization  BIO BALANCEMolecular dynamics of a biophysical model for b2-adrenergic and G protein-coupled receptor activation  BIO BALANCEThe Biophysical Basis for the Graphical Representations  BIO BALANCE Postulates of receptor theory *Receptors must possess structural and steric specificity. *Receptors are saturable and finite (limited number of binding sites) *Receptors must possess high affinity for its endogenous ligand at physiological concentrations *Once the endogenous ligand binds to the receptor, some early recognizable chemical event must occur References Category:Biochemistry Category:Sensory receptors Category:Pharmacology ","title":"Receptor theory"},{"id":"13991738","text":"Eisenstein is a surname which may refer to: * Bruce Eisenstein, American electrical engineer and academic * Charles Eisenstein, American author, speaker and activist * Daniel Eisenstein (born 1970), American cosmologist and academic * Elizabeth Eisenstein (1923-2016), American historian * Gotthold Eisenstein (1823-1852), German mathematician * Ira Eisenstein (1906-2001), American rabbi who cofounded Reconstructionist Judaism * James P.

It was part of the Home nightclub chain owned by Big Beats, including the clubs in Sydney and London, as well as the Homelands outdoor festivals. The decline of the club started earlier however due to Westminster council denying the club a 6am licence. History The club opened in September 1999 and during its existence it was one of the most popular clubs in the United Kingdom. It was considered to be foremost amongst the UK's superclubs whilst it was open. Paul Oakenfold was a resident DJ at the club and also its \\"director of music policy\\", and was one of many top DJs who were resident at the club. Weekly residents we also Steve Lawler, Tim Sheridan, Paul Barkworth and Dave Haslam. Both Oakenfold and Lawler left before the demise of club, as did Darren Hughes one of the founders leaving Paul Barkworth taking over the club and the music programming. The premises had a legal fire capacity of 2,400 and was spread over 7 floors. Like many clubs a much higher number was usual. However, on most weekday nights the capacity was reduced to 1,775 and only floors 2-4 were open to the public. Weekends were at capacity from its birth to demise. Many of the staff and management ended up at the sister venue in Sydney, Australia. =Post closure= Since the closure, the venue has been used for a number of purposes including another nightclub known as The Marquee Club, which also closed within 18 months of its opening in 2004. Currently the premises are used by MTV and was the location of the television show 1 Leicester Square. It is currently used as the studio for the UK version of Total Request Live. The fate of the building as a licensed premises was continually put into question by the very force that initially licensed it, Westminster Council. Located in the heart of Leicester Square, Home became Vertigo and later The Penthouse, a multi-purpose venue.

It is located on the Provateio Oros Mt. in the island's interior, about 15 km from Chios town. It is well known for its mosaics, which, together with those at Daphni and Hosios Loukas, are among the finest examples of \\"Macedonian Renaissance\\" art in Greece.Monasteries of Daphni, Hosios Loukas and Nea Moni of Chios, World Heritage site  History  The monastery was built in the mid-11th century, by Byzantine emperor Constantine IX Monomachos and his wife, Empress Zoe. According to tradition, it is built on the location where three monks, Nikitas, Ioannes and Iosif, miraculously found an icon of the Virgin Mary, hanging from a branch of myrtle.The Nea Moni of Chios, from the Church of Greece website At that time, Constantine was exiled in nearby Lesbos, and the monks visited him and told of a vision according to which he would eventually become emperor. Constantine promised to build a church if this should come to pass. Indeed, in 1042, Constantine became emperor, and in gratitude began constructing the monastery, dedicated to the Theotokos. The main church (the katholikon) was inaugurated in 1049, and the complex finished in 1055, after Constantine's death.The Nea Moni of Chios , from the Greek Ministry of Culture Arrest of Jesus mosaic (11th) View of the interior The monastery was early on endowed with privileges: in a chrysobull of July 1049, Constantine Monomachos granted the monastery the head tax of all Jews of the island of Chios, and set the monastery apart from any superior ecclesiastic or secular hierarchy.Linder, Amnon: The Jews in the Legal Sources of the Early Middle Ages, pp. 160-163 As a result of land grants, tax exemptions and other privileges granted by successive emperors, the monastery prospered during the Byzantine period. Over the centuries, the monastery amassed substantial riches and became one of the wealthiest monasteries in the Aegean. At its peak, around 1300, its estates covered one third of Chios and it is estimated that up to 800 monks belonged to it. The subsequent Genoese domination reduced its wealth, but the monastery prospered again during the Ottoman era, when it was subject directly to the Patriarch of Constantinople, and enjoyed considerable autonomy. The late 16th-century traveler Samuel Purchas recounts that it had 200 monks, and that \\"alone in all Greece they had the right to use bells.\\" During the 17th century the number of monks decreased further, but recovered in the next century. The Patriarch of Jerusalem, Chrysanthos Notaras, and the French priest Fourmont, who visited the monastery in 1725 and 1729 respectively, commented on the large numbers of monks, the quantity of relics preserved, and the beauty of the church and its decoration. The monastery's decline began only after the destruction of Chios by the Ottomans in April 1822, during the Greek War of Independence. 2,000 people had sought refuge in the monastery, but the Ottomans stormed it, slaughtered many, and set fire to the templon and other wooden furnishings of the church, including the roof, leaving the rest of the refugees to burn there. The monastery never recovered its former glory. In 1881, an earthquake added further damage to the main church, leading to the collapse of its dome, while several other buildings, like the 1512 bell-tower, were destroyed. In 1952, due to the shortage of monks, Nea Moni was converted to a convent. According to the 2001 census, it is inhabited by only three nuns.  Structures and architecture  Plan of the katholikon The monastery complex covers an area of approximately 17,000 m2 and consists of the katholikon, two smaller churches (dedicated to the Holy Cross and to St Panteleimon) the dining hall (\\"trapeza\\"), the monks' cells (\\"kelia\\"), the reception hall or \\"triklinon\\" and underground water cistern (\\"kinsterna\\"). The complex is surrounded by a wall (the original Byzantine wall was destroyed in 1822), and in the northeastern corner stands a defensive tower, in earlier times used as a library. In addition, outside the walls, near the monks' cemetery, there is a small chapel to St Luke. The katholikon is the monastery's central structure, dedicated to the Dormition of the Virgin Mary. It is composed of the main church, the esonarthex and the exonarthex. The main church is of an octagonal shape, the so-called \\"insular\\" type, found in Chios and Cyprus. Although all three sections date to the 11th century, the main church suffered significant damage in 1822 and 1881, with the result that its current, rebuilt, form is different from the original. The bell tower was constructed in 1900, replacing an older one built in 1512. Originally, the remains of the three founders were kept in the exonarthex, but most of these were destroyed during the sack of 1822. Along with the katholikon, the only remaining 11th century buildings are the partially ruined tower, the chapel of St Luke, the cistern and parts of the trapeza. The cells, most of which are in a ruined state, date to the Venetian and Genovese periods. A small museum, opened in 1992, exists to the NW of the katholikon, housed in a renovated cell.

These daimyo been remote rulers, especially the 11th, Nariharu, who had spent all his time in Edo without making a single trip to Owari, resulting in low morale amongst the Owari samurai. Because Yoshikatsu was perceived as being more sympathetic to affairs in Owari, local political circles such as the Gold & Iron Party (ÈáëÈâÑÂÖö) had formed, drawing strength from the low-ranking samurai, to lobby for Yoshikatsu's appointment when the matter arose in 1839 and 1845, but Naritaka and Yoshitsugu had been appointed instead. However, when Yoshikatsu was finally appointed in 1849, he did not have as much clout amongst Bakufu officials and the high-ranking samurai in Owari, due to weaker blood relations to the Shogun than his predecessors. Accordingly, forming a consensus amongst high-ranking retainers was indispensable for Yoshikatsu to exercise his authority.Ëó§Áî∞Ëã±Êò≠„ÄåÊñá‰πÖ„ÉªÂÖÉÊ≤ªÊúü„Å´„Åä„Åë„ÇãÂæ≥Â∑ùÊÖ∂Âãù„ÅÆÂãïÂêë„Å®ÊîøÊ≤ªÁöÑÁ´ãÂ†¥„Äç„ÄÅÂæ≥Â∑ùÊûóÊîøÂè≤Á†îÁ©∂ÊâÄ„ÄéÁ†îÁ©∂Á¥ÄË¶Å„ÄèÁ¨¨53Âè∑ÊâÄÂèé„ÄÅ2019Âπ¥ÔºìÊúà, pp.126„ÄÇ After being appointed daimy≈ç, Yoshikatsu made administrative changes, primarily to trim costs. Meanwhile, information about the arrival of the Perry Expedition and the Bakufu's accommodation of foreign demands was reaching all the domains, and particularly disturbed Tokugawa Nariaki, Shimazu Nariakira (daimy≈ç of the Satsuma Domain), Date Munenari (daimy≈ç of theUwajima Domain), and others, who expressed their displeasure with the actions of high functionaries such as Abe Masahiro.Ëó§Áî∞Ëã±Êò≠„ÄåÂòâÊ∞∏„ÉªÂÆâÊîøÊúü„Å´„Åä„Åë„ÇãÂæ≥Â∑ùÊÖ∂Âãù„ÅÆ‰∫∫ËÑà„Å®ÊîøÊ≤ªÂãïÂêë„Äç„ÄÅÂæ≥Â∑ùÊûóÊîøÂè≤Á†îÁ©∂ÊâÄ„ÄéÁ†îÁ©∂Á¥ÄË¶Å„ÄèÁ¨¨44Âè∑ÊâÄÂèé„ÄÅ2017Âπ¥ÔºìÊúà„ÄÅp119„ÄÇ With a strong sense of duty as the head of the three collateral branches of the shogunal family, Yoshikatsu felt that the bakufu could only be assisted by paradoxically criticizing its policy. When the Treaty of Amity and Commerce (United States‚ÄìJapan) was signed in 1858 (Ansei 5), Yoshikatsu joined with his uncle and cousin‚ÄîTokugawa Nariaki and his son Yoshiatsu‚Äîtogether with Matsudaira Yoshinaga (daimy≈ç of the Fukui Domain) and others in making an unsolicited visit to Edo Castle, where they oppose the policies of the Tair≈ç, Ii Naosuke. This act was censured, everyone who opposed Ii Naosuke was purged (the Ansei Purge). For his part Yoshikatsu was placed under house arrest, and he was replaced by his younger brother Mochinaga, who thus became the 15th daimy≈ç of Owari. During this period, he became interested in Western photography, and learned how to take and develop photographs. Remaining photographs include subjects such as the Ninomaru Palace of Nagoya Castle (taken in 1870), Hiroshima Castle, and the suburban residence of the Owari Domain in Edo, almost 1000 photographs in all, which are a priceless historical record. Return to power The assassination of Ii Naosuke in the Sakuradamon Incident (1860) was followed by a general pardon in 1862. Yoshikatsu went to the capitol the same year, being appointed assistant to the Shogun Tokugawa Iemochi. On September 13, 1863, Mochinaga retired, and Yoshikatsu's son Motochiyo (born about the time of the Ansei Purge) was adopted by Mochinaga (15th daimy≈ç), and appointed as the 16th daimy≈ç at the age of six, his name being changed to Tokugawa Yoshinori. With the support of high-ranking samurai in the domain, such as Naruse Masamitsu, Tamiya Joun, Yoshikatsu was able to exert power once again. However others were critical of Yoshikatsu and formed an effective opposition around Morinaga, so the domain was split between the two retired daimy≈ç acting behind the scenes. Involvement in Court politics As power shifted from the Edo bakufu to the Imperial Court, Yoshikatsu spent most of his time in Kyoto. In the spring of 1863, Emperor issued \\"Order to expel barbarians\\" (ÊîòÂ§∑ÂÆüË°å„ÅÆÂãÖÂëΩ, j≈çi jikk≈ç no chokumei), and on the last day of the year formed the conference of councillors (Sanyo Kaigi (ÂèÇÈ†ê‰ºöË≠∞))), a panel of powerful daimyo to serve as his military arm. Yoshikatsu was invited to join, but declined. After the Kinmon incident in the summer, in which samurai from the Ch≈çsh≈´ Domain attempted a coup against the Tokugawa Bakufu, Yoshitaka served as the military commander during the punitive First Ch≈çsh≈´ expedition, in September‚ÄìNovember 1864, with Saig≈ç Takamori as second-in-command. The campaign was considered a success, but, when Ch≈çsh≈´ again challenged Bakufu authority, Yoshikatsu refused to participate in the Second Ch≈çsh≈´ expedition, which ended in a loss of prestige for the Bakufu and a secret alliance between the Satsuma and Ch≈çsh≈´ domains, an alliance that soon overthrew the shogunate.

Unfortunately his father has just died and Francois is clueless in regards to the business he just inherited. He trusts his father's lawyer will take care of everything including the claims of creditors who have demanded an investigation. Like his friend Xavier before Francois soon develops a crush on Marie-Loup, the town's healer. He is delighted when he sees her protecting an Indian girl against a racist. Both share a deep sympathy for the local tribe and speak its language fluently. Unlike Xavier, who serves the local authorities, Francois is successful. But after he has become Marie-Loup's lover, he is forced to escape. Right now the local authorities have discovered illegal affairs of his recently inherited company and they hold him responsible. Francois hides in the wood among friendly Indians and lets them deliver a letter to Marie-Loup. He is waiting for her to join him, so they can get away together. Unfortunately she cannot read and needs to ask the local priest what Francois has written. The priest tells Marie-Loup she had been forsaken by Francois and persuades her to marry Xavier. The desperate Marie- Loup complies with the ceremony but then refuses Xavier his conjugal rights. After she has done so for weeks, Xavier visits Francois in his hideout. He blames his rival for his misfortune and following a fierce fight he leaves him for dead. On his return to Marie-Loup the still furious Xavier utters threats. He does not survive this day. Xavier's comrades refuse to accept Xavier's death as an accident. Marie-Loup gets accused of murder and witchcraft. Francois fails to save her and only gets himself arrested. The British authorities, who have meanwhile taken over the formerly French colony, refrain from interfering in this matter for fear to rekindle hostilities.

The Wojskowy Instytut Bada≈Ñ In≈ºynierii, WIBI (\\"Military Institute of Engineering Research\\") sent Captain Ruci≈Ñski to the United States to legally acquire a Christie M1928 tank, its blueprints and license production rights. The tank was to be used as a base for a new Polish light tank. The Poles however never received the machine and Christie, fearing legal charges, refunded the purchase. Due to this failure to purchase the master model and the possible license, at the end of 1930 the WIBI Tank Design Bureau began preliminary design work on their own wheeled/tracked tank, based on the Christie M1928 and the Christie M1931 known under the working name \\"A la Christie\\". The work was based on available data and advertising leaflets as well as notes and sketches that Captain Ruci≈Ñski obtained from Christie. In 1932 the design drawings and a list of details were ready but soon the work slowed down because the designers were put in charge of a just-bought British Vickers Mark E tank that led to the 7TP light tank which was developed soon after. At the end of 1934, because of the liquidation of WIBI and establishing of the Design and Testing Centre of the Armoured Forces reporting directly to the Armoured Forces Command, most of the \\"A la Christie\\" project documentation was destroyed under the supervision of a special commission. Only a few hand- written notes and calculations were left. On 10 March 1935 design work on a new model called 10TP was started. Major Rudolf Gundlach headed the design team consisting of, among the others, engineers Jan ≈Åapuszewski, Stefan O≈Çdakowski, Mieczys≈Çaw Staszewski, Kazimierz Hejnowicz and process engineer Jerzy Napi√≥rkowski. Despite the fact that in 1936 the vehicle design was not completely finished, it was included in the programme of Armoured Forces that was a part of a general projection of growth and upgrade for the Polish Army for 1936-1942. This programme was approved by the Armament and Equipment Committee (Komitet do spraw Uzbrojenia i Sprzƒôtu, KSUS) in January 1936. The 10TP tank was specified on the list of the equipment scheduled to equip four tank battalions in the new motorised units. Assembly of the first tank prototype was commenced in 1937 in the Experimental Workshop (WD) located within the area of the State Engineering Plants (PZIn≈º.) Factory in Ursus near Warsaw, where all Polish tanks were produced during 1931-1939. The work was supervised by Captain Kazimierz Gr√ºner. At the same time two motorised cavalry brigades were formed with the intention that they would be equipped with the tank. Building of the tank was completed in July 1938. It took so much time because some basic assemblies that were not produced in Poland had to be acquired abroad - for instance an engine of sufficient power. It was not before 16 August that the 10TP tank rolled out for a first longer ride. It was driven by an experienced military specialist Sergeant Polinarek under the personal supervision of the Chief of the Trial and Experiment Department in the Bureau of Technical Studies on Armored Weapons (Biuro Bada≈Ñ Technicznych Broni Pancernych, BBT Br.Panc.) Captain Leon Czekalski. The trials were kept secret because the activities of the German Abwehr and the members of the \\"Fifth Column\\" were then getting more and more intensive in Poland.Magnuski, Janusz, Armor in Profile 1/Pancerne profile 1, Warsaw: Pelta (1997) trans. by Witold Ka≈Çu≈ºy≈Ñski Further trials were stopped by minor faults until 30 September and then the tank was sent to the WD where design modifications were made. On 16 January 1939 the tank was tested, under supervision of its chief designer, along a short distance trip to ≈Åowicz and in the spring, between 22 and 25 April, it went beyond Grodno, traveling a total distance of 610 km. After this trip, during which nearly were logged, the vehicle was sent back to the WD where it was nearly completely stripped down to check the wear on particular parts and assemblies, identify causes of malfunctions and to repair the damage. In May, the refurbished tank was demonstrated to generals and other top ranking military authorities. The designers, having analysed their experiences came to the conclusion that a tank of this type should be a purely tracked vehicle and any equipment needed for driving it on wheels was just an unnecessary weight. Getting rid of this weight allowed them to increase the armour thickness significantly while vehicle weight remained unchanged. Thus another development step of the 10TP was to be the 14TP tank. Its construction was started in the end of 1938 but it was not completed due to the war.Janusz Magnuski: \\"Czo≈Çg 10TP\\"; \\"Nowa Technika Wojskowa\\" nr. 6/96 Lekki czo≈Çg 10 TP Before the tank could enter mass production, the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 ended the independent existence of the Second Polish Republic.  Design  The 10TP tank had a wide hull that made it possible to put two members of the crew inside side by side, a front machine gun and a two-man turret. A solution to the problem of driving the vehicle both on wheels and tracks followed the American design, however Polish designers developed new, wider tracks, drive sprockets and a way of link hooking and moving. The tank steering system using hydraulic servomechanisms was their own advanced solution significantly affecting combat performance of the whole vehicle.

His critical writing on the \\"information society\\" has been translated into many languages, widely discussed and criticized.Laszlo Z. Karvalics 'Theorizing the Internet: How to defend the original, multi-criteria theories of Information Society? triple C 8(2):124-29, 2010 http://www.triple-c.at/index.php/tripleC/article/view/214/173 In Theories of the Information Society, he examined six analytically separable conceptions of the information society, arguing that all are suspect, so much so that the idea of an information society cannot be easily sustained. Biography Frank Webster comes from New Coundon (locally referred to as Coundon Station), a mining village in Durham, England where he was raised and educated. He graduated from Durham University in 1974 with a degree in sociology. He completed his studies at the London School of Economics and has worked in several universities, at home and abroad. He joined City full-time in 2003 from the University of Birmingham. He served as Head of the Department of Sociology at City University London from 2008-2012 and retired in 2013. Works His research since the 1970s has centred on information and communications trends, and has included conceptual analysis and critique, as well as studies of higher education, the effects of advanced technologies on libraries, urban change, and new media. He has more recently worked on Information War and was involved in researching Internet Activism by examining the anti-war movement and its adoption of ICTs. This work is situated in a context of interest in democratisation and information trends, an interest manifested in his teaching at City University London. A book from this project appeared in 2008 titled, Anti-War Activism: New Media and Protest in the Information Age (Palgrave), written with Kevin Gillan and Jenny Pickerill. Webster has published books on many aspects of contemporary social change. He has resisted the view that the Information society is radically new, insisting on the primacy of continuities and consolidations of established trends. He conceives today‚Äôs ‚Äòinformational capitalism‚Äô as a development from corporate capitalism and, before that, laissez-faire capitalism, that advances principles of market society such as private ownership, competition, profitability, commodification, ability to pay, and the centrality of wage labor. He wrote a Luddite analysis of Information Technology with Kevin Robins in the early 1980s that was one of the first book-length critiques of optimistic analyses of computer and telecommunications technologies. More recently, he has used the term Information Society, though this seems to contradict his early hostility to the idea. He has often drawn attention to the dark sides of informational developments, especially the military dimensions. He has adopted the concept of Information War to examine the changing information environment of recent wars. A much expanded 4th edition of Theories of the Information Society appeared in 2014.

International feeling against South Africa's apartheid policy became stronger and more vociferous as the post-war era developed. Until the mid-1960s, however, the South Africa national cricket team continued to play regularly and without undue difficulty against Australia, England and New Zealand. But matters came to a head in 1968 when the South African government refused to allow a tour by England whose team included Basil D'Oliveira. Although the Australians visited South Africa in 1969‚Äì70, the end was nigh for apartheid in sport and South Africa was banned from Test cricket for 22 years. This happened just at a time when the South African team was arguably the strongest in world cricket. In 1970, after South Africa's tour of England was cancelled, a Rest of the World team toured instead. It was captained by Gary Sobers and included other non-white players from the West Indies, India and Pakistan. It also included four of the greatest South African players (Eddie Barlow, Graeme Pollock, Mike Procter and Barry Richards) who clearly had no problems about sharing a dressing room with other cricketers whose skin was a different colour to their own.

In 1856, the county seat was moved to Buchanan and a new courthouse was built, which survived until at least the mid-1860s. A two-story framed courthouse was planned but never constructed. When part of Johnson County was consolidated into Hood County the county seat was moved again, to \\"Camp Henderson\\" which was renamed Cleburne. The first building used was off the square proper of the town, at 2 North Caddo. A two-story brick courthouse was completed on October 26, 1879. In 1882, this one was razed and a new brick building was built which included a bell tower. Though it was brick, it shared styling with neighboring Hill County's courthouse. This was destroyed by fire on April 15, 1912. Current courthouse The current Prairie style structure was completed on November 28, 1913 and was renovated in 2006.

After fighting in the Battle of Warsaw (1920), he became deputy chief of staff of Colonel Tadeusz Piskor. After the Polish-Soviet War, Zamorski returned to Wyzsza Szkola Wojenna, graduating on September 6, 1921. Promoted to the officer of Polish General Staff, he was sent to Operational Group Bieniakonie. From late 1921 until 1923, Zamorski was battalion commander at the 35th Infantry Regiment in Brzesc nad Bugiem. In 1923 - 1924, he was chief of staff of the Third Military District in Grodno.

On November 11, 1966, Polish President in Exile, August Zaleski, promoted Kordian Zamorski to the rank of Divisional general. Legacy When Kordian Zamorski was chief of the Polish State Police (1935‚Äì39), critics often referred to him by the play-on-words, \\"Zamordian\\"‚Äîa conflation of the first two syllables of his surname, \\"Zamorski\\", with the second, final syllable of his given name, \\"Kordian.\\" This whimsical alternative name for Zamorski played on the Polish colloquialism, \\"zamordyzm\\"‚Äîitself formed from \\"za\\" (\\"by\\") and \\"morda\\" (\\"muzzle\\")‚Äîwhich means \\"muzzling of dissent\\". Thus, to his critics, Zamorski was \\"Muzzler of Dissent\\".

Players' tokens are moved along a track according to the roll of the dice. The spaces on the track on two adjacent sides of the board represent the fields where prospecting (panning for gold) is done. Players landing on a prospecting space turn over the top card of one of 4 stacks representing 4 different creeks, to reveal the value of gold uncovered, if any, or else follow the instructions printed on the card that follow the description of some supposed (often humorous) situation that has befallen the player in his/her quest for gold. The other two sides of the board represents a town where players can invest in (buy up) the various services (hotels, supply stores, casinos, saloons, etc.), along the lines of Monopoly, that will fleece the gold panners who subsequently land on these spaces. The winner is the player with the most cash on hand when the gold runs out (i.e. when all four card stacks are depleted).

The author of 94 books, he attracted a broad following with works that sought to interpret Islam and its holy book, the Qur'an, in a modern light. He is widely credited with contributing to a revival of Islamic faith in Egypt in recent times. Another sources have called him \\"one of the most revered sheikhs in the Muslim world\\" and a \\"prominent spokesman for moderate Islamic revivalism in Egypt\\". Early life Al-Ghazali was born in 1917 in the small town of Nikla al-'Inab (ŸÜŸÉŸÑÿß ÿßŸÑÿπŸÜÿ®), southeast of the coastal port of Alexandria, in the Beheira Governorate. He graduated from Al Azhar University in 1941. He taught at the University of Umm al-Qura in Makkah, the University of Qatar, and at al-Amir 'Abd al-Qadir University for Islamic Sciences in Algeria. Works, beliefs, views Sheikh al-Ghazali held the post of chairman of the Academic Council of the International Institute of Islamic Thought in Cairo. Sheikh al- Ghazali authored more than sixty books, many of which have been translated into various languages, and was also the recipient of many awards, including the First Order of the Republic (Egypt) (1988), the King Faisal Award (1989) and the Excellence Award from Pakistan. Al-Ghazali was known in the western world for testifying on behalf of the assassins of secularist author Farag Foda (who had spoken out against making sharia the law of Egypt), telling the Egyptian court that \\"anyone who openly resisted the full imposition of Islamic law was an apostate who should be killed either by the government or by devout individuals.\\" His position as the \\"preeminent\\" faculty member at Egypt's preeminent Islamic institution‚ÄîAl Azhar University‚Äîallegedly put the government on the defensive in its struggle against Egypt's \\"growing tide of Islamic fundamentalism\\" and occurred \\"at the height\\" of a violent campaign by militants against Egypt's secular Government. He also called on the government to appoint a committee to measure the faith of the population and give wayward Egyptian Muslims time to repent. \\"Those who did not should be killed,\\" he said. According to Ana B. Soage during the assassination trial of Faraj Fawda, while al-Ghazali stated that punishment of those who opposed sharia should ideally be carried out by the state, \\"when the state fails to punish apostates, somebody else has to do it.\\"Middle East Review of International Affairs (MERIA), \\"Faraj Fawda, or the cost of Freedom of Expression\\" In the Muslim world, however, Al-Ghazali \\"was not closely identified with the militant cause\\". He \\"often appeared on state-run television and held a place in the pulpit of one of Cairo's largest mosques\\", After Egyptian Islamic Jihad attempted to kill Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak during a visit to Ethiopia June 1995, \\"Sheik Ghazali was among the prominent Islamic clerics who traveled to the presidential palace to congratulate Mr. Mubarak on his safe return.\\" Personal life and death He was married to Lady Amina Kouta and had seven children including two boys, and five girls and was buried in Medina, Saudi Arabia. He was a very popular Sheikh in Egypt and remained so even after his death.

Rather than upending the science of hadith criticism, he sought to redress imbalances in scholars' understanding of it. Nonetheless, the book's \\"severe\\" criticism of what Al-Ghazali believed to be the \\"literalism, and anti-interpretive approach to Islamic texts\\" of the Ahl al-Hadith (partisans of hadith) prompted sharp attacks from Islamists even more conservative than Al-Ghazali. \\"Several major conferences ... in Egypt and Saudi Arabia\\" criticizing the book, long articles in response in the Saudi- owned London-based newspaper Asharq Al-Awsat, and assorted writings of others condemning al-Ghazali and questioning \\"his motives and competence.\\"Khaled Abou El Fadl (2005), The Great Theft: Wrestling Islam from the Extremists, p. 93.

The village is constituted of a number of hamlets, among which Mamelis, Camerig, Harles and Cottessen. Including these hamlets, Vijlen has around 1,500 inhabitants (in 2005) and is part of the municipality of Vaals. Located at 200 meters above Normaal Amsterdams Peil, on top of the Vijlenerberg (Vijlener hill), it is the highest situated town in the Netherlands. The neo-gothic and Catholic St. Martinus church, which is located in the center of the village, is known as the highest located church in the country. The area around the village is well known for its natural environment and landscapes. The 'Mergelland Route', a touristic route through the South- Limburg area, leads through the village and its surroundings. With lodging and camping facilities available, tourism related business is a key source of income for the village. The origin of the village is most likely Roman. The name Vijlen is generally believed to be derived from the Roman word 'villa' or 'villare' (farm estate or 'belonging to a farm estate'). Remains of a Roman villa have been found close to the village. The earliest known documentation on the village originates from 1016. Documentation of a gift to the abbey of Aachen-Burtscheidt in that year mentions property in Villiam (Uilliam). In the adjoining forest, the 'Vijlener bos', evidence of much earlier human activity in the area has been found. Communal graves from the Linear Pottery culture have been recovered, and indicate human settlements in the area around 5000 years ago.\\" Op ontdekkingstocht door Zuid Limburg\\".

Born in Egypt and raised in Trenton, NJ, he is the author of Life without Parole: Living in Prison Today which documents some stories of prison life, interviews with other prisoners and some short essays about his personal views of Prison and Criminal Justice system in the United States. His book, which is currently in its fifth edition and has been renamed as Life without Parole: Living and Dying in Prison Today, is used by many sociology, criminal justice, and Social Work professors to help teach American justice and social control. Hassine, an intellectual who graduated from Dickinson College and New York Law School, offers a rare and intelligent insider's look at life in an American prison, including achievements and failures in the criminal justice system. Hassine's writings have been favorably reviewed by the New York Times and have garnered many awards, including two prestigious Pen American Awards in 1991 and 1992 for non-fiction writing. He also wrote poetry about prison life published in an Anthology of Prison Writings, The Crying Wall, published by Willow Tree Press in 2005.  Victor Hassine's crime  This case arises out of a conspiracy involving Hassine and his co-conspirators George Gregory Orlowski and William Eric Decker, which culminated in the August 22, 1980, murder of James Puerale and the shootings of Albert \\"Skip\\" Kellet and Lois Kellet. The evidence at trial showed that Hassine first met Orlowski in 1979, and that shortly thereafter they decided to open a store in Morrisville, Pennsylvania, called Greg's Quality Meat Market (\\"the Market\\"). The store was financed by Hassine's family, overseen and supervised by Hassine himself, and operated on a daily basis by Orlowski. However, the Market soon experienced financial problems, and, with Hassine's knowledge, Orlowski began selling marijuana and methamphetamine from a back room in the store. In June 1980, Albert Kellet, a close friend of Orlowski, purchased $150 of methamphetamine at the Market. Upon returning home, Kellet discovered that the drugs were of inferior quality and he became enraged. He called Orlowski and invited him to his apartment under the false pretense of wishing to buy more methamphetamine. When Orlowski arrived, Kellet threatened him with a club, stole all of his money and drugs, and threw him out of the apartment. Several days later, Orlowski, Hassine, and Decker, among others, met at the Market to discuss Kellet's actions. The State's witnesses testified that at this meeting, Hassine announced that he wanted Kellet \\"wasted\\" and that if Lois Kellet, Albert's wife, was present, she \\"was to go also, because any witnesses had to go.\\" As a result, Hassine, Decker, and Orlowski made several attempts over the next month to obtain a gun with which to kill Kellet, and they investigated the possibility of paying two other individuals to have Kellet murdered. A number of confrontations between Hassine and Kellet also erupted during this time, and, on at least one occasion, Hassine instructed Decker to shoot Kellet and to kill him. Because it was daylight and a witness was present, Decker declined. Nevertheless, on August 22, 1980, Decker had his own encounter with Kellet, and he returned to the Market to tell Hassine that \\"[t]onight's the night -- the cat's got to go. We'll use your gun.\\" According to the State's witnesses, Hassine picked Decker up later that evening and drove him to Hassine's parents' house in Trenton, New Jersey. While Decker waited in the car, Hassine entered the house and obtained his father's .380 caliber Llama handgun. Hassine then drove Decker to Kellet's apartment building and gave him the gun and a New York Yankees batting helmet to cover his hair. As Decker approached the building, he saw Kellet in a first-floor apartment watching television with his wife Lois, along with James Puerale and George Sofield. Decker entered the apartment, surveyed the room, and opened fire, killing Puerale instantly and injuring Skip and Lois Kellet with shots to the head. The police arrested Decker the next day, and arrested Hassine three months later, charging Hassine with first degree murder, attempted murder, conspiracy, and solicitation.  The trial  The State presented thirty-four witnesses at Hassine's trial, including Decker, who had negotiated a plea bargain with the District Attorney to avoid the death penalty. Decker and the other witnesses testified as to the details of the murder conspiracy and described Hassine's extensive involvement in the plot to murder Kellet. Hassine then took the stand in his own defense and, for the first time since his arrest, offered an innocent explanation for his role in the conspiracy. He testified that he had obtained his father's gun and stored it in the Market after Orlowski had asked him for protection from Kellet. He then claimed that Decker entered the Market on the day of the murder, and, without Hassine's knowledge, took the gun and left the store \\"ranting and raving, saying he was going to get Skip Kellet.\\" Hassine thus maintained that he never told Decker to kill Kellet, that he never gave Decker a gun with which to carry out the crime, and that he was never part of the murder conspiracy. Attempting to discredit these claims, the prosecutor asked Hassine a series of questions on cross-examination regarding Hassine's post- arrest silence. In particular, he inquired three times as to why Hassine had not offered the same exculpatory story to the authorities following his arrest. Hassine's attorney objected each time, believing that the questions violated Hassine's rights under Doyle v. Ohio, which provides that the government cannot use a defendant's post-arrest, post-Miranda silence for impeachment purposes at trial.426 U.S. at 610 The trial judge agreed, sustaining the objections and preventing Hassine from answering the prosecutor's questions. The prosecutor also made two general references to Hassine's silence in his closing argument. Nevertheless, the court did not provide curative instructions during Hassine's testimony or in the jury charge. The case was sent to the jury at the close of all evidence, and on June 11, 1981, the jury found Hassine guilty and recommended that he be sentenced to life in prison on the charge of first degree murder. After denying Hassine's motions for a new trial and arrest of judgment, the court adopted the jury's recommendation and sentenced Hassine to life imprisonment, in addition to several consecutive prison terms extending from two to twenty years. Hassine's death On April 27, 2008, Victor Hassine died while in prison in Pennsylvania under unusual circumstances. An outspoken advocate for prison reform, the cause of his death is presently under investigation by prison authorities and private investigators, though it appears that he hung himself according to a memo prepared by the Pennsylvania Department of Corrections April 28, 2008.

British Light Steel Pressings Ltd (BLSP) was formed in 1930. In its early years it made pressings for various purposes. In 1937 it was taken over by the Rootes Group, to make body shells for Sunbeam cars. After World War II, despite transfer of production of Sunbeam-Talbots from the old London Talbot factory to a new government funded site at Ryton, BLSP continued in production. In 1948, for example, versions of the Sunbeam-Talbot 80 and 90 were available with saloon bodywork from BLSP or drophead coup√© bodywork by another nearby Rootes company, Thrupp & Maberly.Sunbeam-Talbot 80 and 90 During the mid-1950s car bodies produced included the Sunbeam Mk III saloon and convertible, Sunbeam Alpine (1953‚Äì55) and thereafter the Humber Hawk, Super Snipe and Imperial in saloon and estate car versions. BLSP Ltd ran a successful apprenticeship scheme covering both professional engineering and trade programmes. By the 1960s BLSP had some of the largest presses in Britain and, as well as body shells, produced a wide range of car and commercial components for the Rootes Group including suspension units, petrol tanks and small pressings.BLSP The Rootes group by this time included Humber, Hillman, Sunbeam-Talbot, Singer, Commer and Karrier. However, from the late 1950s the company suffered from industrial unrest, which has been cited as the root of problems leading eventually to the takeover of Rootes by Chrysler. The first strike of 1,500 workers began when a couple of newly-wed night shift workers asked to be transferred to day shift, and became known as the 'Honeymoon Strike'. A spate of 82 mainly unofficial strikes in 1961 caused the loss of over 27,000 man hours at the BLSP plant, which in turn caused the loss of 17,000 man hours at other Rootes plants. Finally a strike led to an ultimatum to all 1000 workers to return to work or be sacked. A recruitment drive was started to replace striking workers but as the strike rolled on 8,000 workers from other factories were made redundant.Industrial Unrest Rootes announced its plan to close the plant in July 1966. At that time it was producing commercial vehicle cabs and van body pressings.Rootes to close body plant.

In the 19th century Helena was a village that played an important role in the manufacture and shipping of lead shot. The buildings of Helena played a key role in the Black Hawk War of 1832, despite being abandoned at the time. History Although always situated on the Wisconsin River, Helena has existed in three different locations. The first village of Helena was staked out by Henry Dodge as a river port convenient to recently discovered lead deposits around Dodgeville, Blue Mounds, and Mineral Point.Folkedahl, Beulah. \\"Forgotten Villages: Helena\\". Wisconsin Magazine of History, vol. 42 no. 4 (Summer 1959): 288-92. In 1831 Daniel Whitney, an entrepreneur from Green Bay, Wisconsin, formed a company to build a shot tower on a nearby bluff. Helena was emptied during 1832 when most of its inhabitants joined militias to fight in the Black Hawk War. Following the Battle of Wisconsin Heights, Black Hawk and his allies fled across the Wisconsin River. To follow them the U.S. army under the command of Henry Atkinson marched and arrived in Helena on July 26, 1832. They tore down many of the buildings to make rafts. Approximately 1,300 men were ferried across the Wisconsin River at Helena over the next two days. They caught up with their opponents on August 1 and conclusively ended the war with the Bad Axe Massacre. After the war Daniel Whitney and his company relocated the village of Helena a few miles to the northeast, adjacent to their Helena Shot Tower. Other settlers joined the shot tower employees and the village grew. Helena reached its peak prosperity in the mid-1850s.Stark, William F. Wisconsin, River of History. 1988. However a bridge was built across the river several miles upstream, and consequently the railroad was built through Spring Green instead of Helena. The Panic of 1857 further depressed Helena's economy. The town was moved again, to the northeast, to be along the rail line. However it did not flourish, and in the mid-1860s Helena had only 50 inhabitants. Today Historical marker of Helena's second location, in Tower Hill State Park Remnants of Helena's second iteration are visible today in Tower Hill State Park, including a reconstruction of the shot tower. The Old Helena Cemetery is across the road.  Notable residents  Owen King was a Helena lumber dealer who served as a member of the Wisconsin State Assembly in the 1870s, first as a Reform Party member, then as a Greenbacker.

Biography and career When he was 16 years old (1925), he won the gold medal in the 1500 meter swimming competition at the Varadero Nautical Club, which was considered the national championships in swimming. The following year (1926), he went to the I Juegos Centroamericanos (1st Central American Games) held in Mexico. He won the gold in the 400 meters (6:06.3) and 1500 meters (26:17.7), as an individual and a gold medal as member of the relay swimming team 4x100, along with Carlos Gonz√°lez, Alberto Gou y Gonzalo Silverio. Four years later (1930), he competed in the II Juegos Centroamericanos (2nd Central American Games) held in Havana. He again won the 400 meters (5:28.6), the 1500 meters (22:22.0), and the relay of 4x100 with Gonzalo Silverio, Cosme Carol and Pablo La Rosa (4:26.2). He also won a silver medal in the 100 meters, just behind his teammate Pablo La Rosa. A little after the 1930 games he suffered an accident and had to retire from competitive swimming. From then on until just before his death he was a teacher and swimming coach. In the 1950s Smith was the swimming coach at Belen School. The Cuban government in 1999, declared that from then on June 30 would be the Day of the Swimmer in his honor.

Ralph Byrd may well have played Dick Tracy in further adventures had he not died unexpectedly, of a heart attack, on August 18, 1952, at age 43.http://www.tcm.com/tcmdb/title/73093/Dick-Tracy-s-Dilemma/articles.html Plot Ruthless killer Steve Michel is known to the public as \\"the Claw\\" for his way of killing his victims with his prosthetic hook. After his accomplices Ryan and Taylor have broken in and stolen furs from the Flawless Furs warehouse, Steve kills the guard with his hook. When the police arrive at the crime scene in the shape of Detective Dick Tracy, he talks to Humphries, who is the owner of the store; Peter Premium, who is a representative for the insurance company; and a man named Cudd, who is the insurance investigator. The insurance company only has 24 hours to find the stolen goods, or they have to reimburse the fur company. Tracy and his semicompetent assistant Patton examine the dead body at the morgue and find a note on it stating that three perpetrators performed the hit against the warehouse. It also mentions that they used a truck with the name \\"Daisy\\" on it. Unfortunately, the three perpetrators disguise the truck before Tracy can find it, and the lead is a dead end. The robbers soon leave their hideout in a local junkyard and go to a nearby bar to phone their boss and get new instructions. As they speak with the boss on the phone, their conversation is overheard by an informant, a blind beggar called Sightless, who goes to pass the information on. Sightless is sloppy and noisy when eavesdropping, and is nearly caught by the Claw. Still, he manages to escape the bar. Sightless goes directly to Dick Tracy, but is stopped at the door by Tracy's friend, Vitamin Flintheart. Vitamin believes the beggar is up to no good, and denies him entrance to the house. After listening to Sightless' message, Vitamin gets rid of him. Still, he passes the message on to Tracy later, and Tracy and Patton manage to find the fence who the three robbers were meeting, Longshot Lillie. Lillie is taken into custody and questioned, but is unable to identify the robbers. At the same time, the Claw finds Sightless' apartment and kills the blind man with his hook. Soon after, Tracy and Patton arrive, and the Claw flees the scene. Patton pursues the killer, fires a shot and wounds him, but still, the Claw manages to escape. Tracy notices that the Claw had tried to make a phone call from Sightless' phone, and can identify the first digits from hook scratches on the phone dial. He sends Patton to find the rest of the phone number. Tracy himself goes to the insurance company and accuses them of stealing the furs from the warehouse. They protest against the charges when Patton arrives and tells them that the number leads to the storeowner Humphries. Humphries' plan was all along to sell back the furs to the insurance company after the 24 hours had passed and collect the penalty fee stated in the policy. He calls the robbers at the same bar as before, instructing them to tell the insurance company to come to the bar with $50,000. Feeling guilty about sending Sightless off to a certain death before, Vitamin goes to the bar to find the killer, pretending to be a blind beggar himself. Sam and Fred make an attempt to steal the money for themselves, but the Claw, wounded but still capable of fighting, manages to kill them both. The killings are witnessed by Vitamin, who also hears the Claw talk on the phone to Humphries, telling him the furs' whereabouts. Meanwhile, Patton and Cudd have gone to Humphries and are watching him as he talks to the Claw. Humphries tells the Claw over the phone about his predicament, and the Claw becomes suspicious towards Vitamin and his blind-beggar performance. Tracy arrives to the bar just in time to save his friend from the Claw, and a chase back down to the junkyard happens. Tracy chases the Claw to a high-voltage generator, and the killer is killed by an electric shock when he touches a wire with his hook.

Biography Renouard, born at Stamford, Lincolnshire, on 7 September 1780, was the youngest son of Peter Renouard (d. 1801) of Stamford, adjutant in the Rutland Militia, by Mary, daughter of John Henry Ott, rector of Gamston, Nottinghamshire, and prebendary of Richmond and Peterborough. George entered St Paul's School, London, in 1793, and in the same year, on the nomination of George III, was admitted on the foundation of Charterhouse School. From there, in 1798, he proceeded firstly to Trinity College, Cambridge, and then, in 1800, migrated to Sidney Sussex. He graduated Bachelor of Arts (BA) in 1802, and per literas regias Cambridge Master of Arts (MA Cantab) in 1805, and Bachelor of Divinity (BD) in 1811. After obtaining a fellowship in 1804, he became chaplain to the British Embassy at Constantinople. In 1806 he returned to England, and served as curate of Great St Mary's, Cambridge. From January 1811 to 1814 he was chaplain to the factory at Smyrna. During his residence there he discovered on a rock near Nymphio a figure which he identified with the Sesostris of Herodotus.His priority of discovery was afterwards disputed, but it was finally vindicated by L. Schmitz in the \\"Classical Museum\\", No. 2, pp. 232‚Äì3. In 1815 he returned to Cambridge to fill the post of Lord Almoner's Professor of Arabic, which he held till 1821. For a time he also acted as curate of Grantchester, near Cambridge, but in 1818 was presented to the valuable college living of Swanscombe, Kent. While at Smyrna in 1813 he baptised John William Burgon, with whom in after life he was very intimate. He looked over the manuscript of Burgon's prize essay on \\"The Life and Character of Sir Thomas Gresham\\", and publicly read the essay at the Mansion House, London, on 14 May 1836. Burgon corresponded with him from 1836 to 1852, and dedicated to him his \\"Fifty Smaller Scriptural Cottage Prints\\" in 1851. Renouard died unmarried at Swanscombe rectory on 15 February 1867, and was buried in Swanscombe churchyard on 21 February. Works Renouard was an admirable classical scholar, was acquainted with French, German and Italian language, and gained during his sojourn in the East an intimate knowledge of the Arabic, Turkish and Hebrew languages. Although his publications were few, he obtained a wide reputation as a linguist, geographer and botanist. During the forty-nine years that he resided at Swanscombe he maintained a voluminous correspondence with the most distinguished orientalists and geographers of Europe, and was an industrious contributor to the journals of learned societies. For the British and Foreign Bible Society he corrected the proofs of the translations of the scriptures into Turkish and other eastern languages. He was a leading member of the translation committee of the Royal Asiatic Society, to which he was elected in 1824, revising many of its publications. His paper on the language of the Berbers was communicated to the society in 1836.Journal, 1836, iii. 131‚Äì160 From 1836 to 1846 he was honorary foreign secretary of the Royal Geographical Society, and actively interested himself in the Syro-Egyptian Society and the Numismatic Society.

It was based on High Street Swansea, the site of the former Swansea College of Technology, and offered a portfolio of programmes which includes business, leisure and tourism, public services, management and health and social care. The School, and the colleges that originally formed Swansea Institute of Higher Education, have existed for more than 150 years. All postgraduate and undergraduate qualifications were then awarded by the University of Wales, including the MBA programmes that existed from 1991. Although initially a part of Swansea Metropolitan University, Swansea Business School moved to its current campus when Swansea Metropolitan University became a part of University of Wales Trinity Saint David in 2010. The university came into existence through the merger of the two oldest higher education institutions in Wales, the University of Wales, Lampeter and Trinity University College in 2010, under Lampeter's royal charter of 1828. In 2011, it was announced that the University of Wales would also be merged into Trinity Saint David. On 1 August 2013 the university merged with Swansea Metropolitan University which included Swansea Business School.BBC News (2009): ¬£14.3m funding for new university; accessed 15 June 2010 Swansea Business School achieved an \\"Excellent\\" grading for the quality of its teaching from the Higher Education Funding Council (Wales) and has a long and successful tradition of providing business education.

Biography Ransford was born at Bourton-on-the-Water, near Moreton in the Marsh, Gloucestershire, on 13 March 1805. He first appeared on the stage as an extra in the opening chorus at the King's Theatre, Haymarket, and was afterwards engaged in the chorus at Covent Garden. During Charles Kemble's management of Covent Garden, Ransford was heard as a baritone in the part of Don Caesar in the Castle of Andalusia, performed on 27 May 1829, and was engaged soon afterwards by Samuel James Arnold for the English Opera House (now the Lyceum). In the autumns of 1829 and 1830 he was at Covent Garden. In 1831 he played leading characters under Robert William Elliston at the Surrey Theatre, where he won great popularity. In 1832 he was with Joseph Grimaldi at Sadler's Wells, playing Tom Tuck in Andrew V. Campbell's nautical drama The Battle of Trafalgar, in which he made a great hit with S. C. Neukomm's song \\"The Sea\\". At this theatre in 1831 he sustained the part of Captain Cannonade in John Barnett's opera, The Pet of the Petticoats. On 3 November 1831 at Drury Lane, he played Giacomo in Auber's Fra Diavolo, its first production in England. He afterwards fulfilled important engagements at Drury Lane, the Lyceum, and Covent Garden. At Covent Garden he played the Doge of Venice in Othello on 25 March 1833, when Edmund Kean made his last appearance on the stage; and Sir Harry in the School for Scandal on Charles Kemble's last appearance as Charles Surface. His final theatrical engagement was with Macready at Covent Garden in 1837‚Äì38. After his retirement from the stage Ransford for a time sang at concerts, and then, from 1845 onwards, produced a series of popular musical entertainments, in which he was the chief performer. Among these ventures were \\"Illustrations of Gipsy Life and Character\\" (with the words to the songs by Eliza Cook), \\"Tales of the Sea\\", and \\"Songs of Dibdin\\". Ransford was also well known as a composer of songs and glees, and between 1835 and 1876 more than fifty published pieces bear his name. For some years he was also in business as a music publisher at Charles Street, Soho Square, and at 2 Princes Street, Cavendish Square, London. He died at 59 Welbeck Street, Cavendish Square, London, on 11 July 1876, and was buried at Bourton-on-the-Water on 15 July. His wife Hannah, who he had married in March 1825, died on 22 November 1876, aged 71. Cover illustration for \\"Come, gang awa' wi' me\\" Among his published songs, in which the words as well as the music were by himself, were: \\"Come, gang awa' wi' me\\", 1840, and \\"Summer is nigh\\", 1842. Under the name of \\"Aquila\\" he composed thirteen \\"Sacred Ballads\\" (1862‚Äì9), and wrote the words of the well-known song, \\"In the Days when we went gipsying\\".

Dieterich argued in 1996 that both free- market industrial capitalism and 20th-century socialism in the form of Marxism‚ÄìLeninism have failed to solve urgent problems of humanity such as poverty, hunger, exploitation of labour, economic oppression, sexism, racism, the destruction of natural resources and the absence of a truly participative democracy.Heinz Dieterich: Der Sozialismus des 21. Jahrhunderts ‚Äì Wirtschaft, Gesellschaft und Demokratie nach dem globalen Kapitalismus, Einleitung Socialism of the 21st Century ‚Äì Economy, Society, and Democracy in the era of global Capitalism, Introduction. Socialism of the 21st century has democratic socialist elements, but it primarily resembles Marxist revisionism. Leaders who have advocated for this form of socialism include Hugo Ch√°vez of Venezuela, N√©stor Kirchner of Argentina, Rafael Correa of Ecuador, Evo Morales of Bolivia and Luiz In√°cio Lula da Silva of Brazil. Because of the local unique historical conditions, socialism of the 21st century is often contrasted with previous applications of socialism in other countries, with a major difference being the effort towards a more decentralised and participatory planning process.  Historical foundations  After a series of structural adjustment loans and debt restructuring led by the International Monetary Fund in the late 20th century, Latin America experienced a significant increase in inequality. Between 1990 and 1999, the Gini coefficient rose in almost every Latin American country. Volatile prices and inflation led to dissatisfaction. In 2000, only 37% of Latin Americans were satisfied with their democracies (20 points less than Europeans and 10 points less than sub-Saharan Africans). In this context, a wave of left-leaning socio-political movements on behalf of indigenous rights, cocaleros, labor rights, women's rights, land rights and educational reform emerged to eventually provide momentum for the election of socialist leaders. Socialism of the 21st century draws on indigenous traditions of communal governance and previous Latin America socialist and communist movements, including those of Salvador Allende, Fidel Castro, Che Guevara, the Zapatista Army of National Liberation and the Sandinista National Liberation Front.  Theoretical tenets  According to Dieterich, this form of socialism is revolutionary in that the existing society is altered to be qualitatively different, but the process itself should be gradual and non-violent, instead utilising participatory democracy to secure power, education, scientific knowledge about society and international cooperation. Dieterich suggests the construction of four basic institutions within the new reality of post-capitalist civilisation: # Equivalence economy based on Marxian labor theory of value and democratically determined by those who directly create value instead of market-economical principles. # Majority democracy which makes use of referendums to decide upon important societal questions. # Basic state democracy with a suitable protection of minority rights. # Citizens who are responsible, rational and self-determined.  Latin American application  = Regional integration = The model of socialism of the 21st century encourages economic and political integration among nations in Latin America and the Caribbean. This is often accompanied with opposition to North American influence. Regional organizations like ALBA, CELAC, Mercosur and UNASUR promote cooperation with Latin America and exclude North American countries. ALBA is most explicitly related to socialism of the 21st century while other organizations focus on economic integration, ALBA promotes social, political and economic integration among countries that subscribe to democratic socialism. Its creation was announced in direct opposition to George W. Bush's attempts to establish a Free Trade Area of the Americas that included the United States. In 2008, ALBA introduced a monetary union using the SUCRE as its regional currency. = Bolivarian process = Socialism of the 21st century was promoted by Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez, who differentiated it from previous movements Former Venezuelan President Hugo Ch√°vez called the process of social reforms in Venezuela the Bolivarian process. This approach is more heavily influenced by the theories of Istv√†n M√©sz√°ros, Michael Lebowitz and Marta Harnecker (who was Ch√°vez's adviser between 2004 and 2011) than by those of Heinz Dieterich. The process draws its name from Latin American liberator Sim√≥n Bol√≠var and is a contemporary example of Bolivarianism. = Buen vivir = Often translated to good living or living well, the concept of buen vivir is related to the movement for indigenous rights and rights of nature. It focuses on the living sustainably as the member of a community that includes both human beings and Nature.Regine Cochrane, \\"Climate Change, Buen Vivir, and the Dialectic of Enlightenment: Toward a Feminist Critical Philosophy of Climate Justice,\\" Hypatia, vol. 29, no. 3 (Summer 2014), pp. 576-598. Buen vivir is enshrined in Ecuador's new constitution as an alternative to neoliberal development. The constitution outlines a set of rights, one of which is the rights of nature.Gudynas, Eduardo. 2011. Buen Vivir: Today's Tomorrow Development 54(4):441-447. In line with the assertion of these rights, buen vivir seeks to change the relationship between nature and humans to a more bio-pluralistic view, eliminating the separation between nature and society.SENPLADES. 2009 National Plan for Good Living. Electronic document. Retrieved May 2012. This approach has been applied to the Yasun√≠-ITT Initiative. Buen vivir is sometimes conceptualised as collaborative consumption in a sharing economy and the term is used to look at the world in way sharply differentiated from natural, social or human capital.  Criticism = Authoritarianism = Critics claim that socialism of the 21st century in Latin America acts as a fa√ßade for authoritarianism. The charisma of figures like Hugo Ch√°vez and mottoes like \\"Country, Socialism, or Death!\\" have drawn comparisons to the Latin American dictators and caudillos of the past. According to Steven Levitsky of Harvard University: \\"Only under the dictatorships of the past [...] were presidents reelected for life\\", with Levitsky further stating that while Latin America experienced democracy, citizens opposed \\"indefinite reelection, because of the dictatorships of the past\\". Levitsky then noted: \\"In Nicaragua, Venezuela and Ecuador, reelection is associated with the same problems of 100 years ago\\". The Washington Post also stated in 2014 that \\"Bolivia's Evo Morales, Daniel Ortega of Nicaragua and the late Venezuelan president Hugo Ch√°vez [...] used the ballot box to weaken or eliminate term limits\\". In 2015, The Economist stated that the Bolivarian Revolution in Venezuela‚Äînow under Nicol√°s Maduro after Ch√°vez's death in 2013‚Äîwas devolving from authoritarianism to dictatorship as opposition politicians were jailed for plotting to undermine the government, violence was widespread and opposition media shut down. Western media coverage of Ch√°vez and other Latin American leaders from the 21st-century socialist movement has been criticised as unfair by their supporters and leftist media critics.\\"Oliver Stone Interview: There's a Specter Haunting Latin America, the Specter of 21st Century Socialism\\". = Economics = The sustainability and stability of economic reforms associated with governments adhering to socialism of the 21st century have been questioned. Latin American countries have primarily financed their social programs with extractive exports like petroleum, natural gas and minerals, creating a dependency that some economists claim has caused inflation and slowed growth. For the Bolivarian government of Venezuela, their economic policies led to shortages in Venezuela, a high inflation rate and a dysfunctional economy. However, the Ch√°vez and Maduro governments have attributed Venezuela's economic problems to the decline in oil prices, sanctions imposed by the United States and economic sabotage by the opposition. In 2015, Venezuela's economy was performing poorly‚Äîthe currency had collapsed, it had the world's highest inflation rate and its GDP shrank into an economic recession. A 2017 NACLA analysis stated that \\"reductions in poverty and inequality during the Ch√°vez years were real, but somewhat superficial. [...] [S]tructural poverty and inequality, such as the quality of housing, neighborhoods, education, and employment, remained largely unchanged\\".. = Populism = Although democratic socialist intellectuals have welcomed a socialism of the 21st century, they have been sceptical of Latin America's examples. While citing their progressive role, they argue that the appropriate label for these governments is populist rather than socialist. Similarly, some of the left-wing pink tide governments were criticised for turning from socialism to authoritarianism and populism.

In the early 20th century the Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings campaigned for its restoration and it was then taken over by the National Trust. The thatched stone building is rented to a tenant and has limited public access. History The Priest's House was built by the nearby Muchelney Abbey around 1308 for the parish priest. The vicarage was valued at ¬£10 per annum in 1535. The building was said to be \\"ruinous\\" in 1608. It was used by the vicar or curate until around 1840, when the house was used as a cellar and later as a school. In the late 19th century it was rented by a farmer for storage. Because of its poor condition it was recommended for demolition in both 1896 and 1901. The Society for the Protection of Ancient Buildings organised a public appeal to raise money for repairs to which Jane Morris, Thomas Hardy and George Bernard Shaw contributed. As the funding for the restoration was no longer an issue the building was acquired, in 1911, by the National Trust who employed Ernest Barnsley of the Barnsley brothers, the Arts and Crafts movement master builders, to design and the work. It was carried out by Norman Jewson and William Weir. The work left in place and strengthened earlier structures where possible but added new aspects including a stone buttress and a kitchen range. In the 1990s and 2000s the building underwent further structural repairs, including the replacement of the timber structure supporting the roof and was rethatched with grant aid from English Heritage. Today the National Trust rent it to a tenant who provides limited access to the public. Architecture The two-storey thatched hall house is made of local stone with hamstone dressings. Externally the house measures by wide. It has four bays along the south front which incorporates original Gothic doorway and tracery windows. Inside is a 15th-century fireplace. The original hall went from floor to roof, however in the 16th century a ceiling was added dividing it into two floors. This also involved changes to the original windows. The hall has a cruck roof with a saddle apex typical of the 14th century.

In the US, most publishers use a full-time employee for this, if they do it at all. That employee is called an editorial assistant. Most publishers in the US prefer to receive some type of shorter query, decide if the subject and author fit their current plans, and then request a copy of the manuscript. When a writer ignores this request or guideline, and sends a full manuscript, many publishers return them unopened. These publishers, then, wouldn't have anyone \\"reading slush.\\" The first person to read the submissions can exercise considerable influence over the offerings of the publishers for whom they work, and many unknown writers owed their first sale to a sympathetic publishers' reader or editorial assistant. A film reader performs a similar task by reading screenplays and advising producers and directors of their viability as a potential critical and commercial success.

The city's first recorded coat of arms dates back to 1369, and since then, the coat of arms has mostly kept its features, until 1948. In 1970 a new coat of arms was designed by the communist authorities, inserting the original heraldic symbol. The current design dates from 1996, when the former mayor Gheorghe Funar organised a contest for the new symbol of the city.  Description and symbolism  The current shield of Cluj-Napoca is party per fess; yellow (instead of or), bearing a white (instead of argent) Dacian Draco. The lower part is party per pale. The dexter part is of azure, bearing Goddess Athena ‚Äì Minerva. The sinister part is of gules, bearing the Monument of the Memorandists. The shield is topped by a mural crown with seven towers, which shows the city's status as a county seat. This is the only element that respects the rule. Furthermore, the colors are the national colors, which contradicts the committee's regulation on not using the Tricolor on the coat of arms of local authorities.  History  The coat of arms of Cluj between 1926 and 1948 Cluj's traditional coat of arms and seal was first awarded in 1377 by king Louis I of Hungary. It represents three towers, a city wall with a gate in silver on a blue background. It was the coat of arms of Cluj until communist rulers modified it introducing other elements but preserving the three towers in the bottom field. The three towers coat of arms was abandoned by nationalist mayor Gheorghe Funar, in a move which did not respect the respective Romanian law. As of the subsequent mayors of Cluj- Napoca failed to reintroduce the traditional coat of arms as demanded by many heraldists, historians and civil activists.

Early years Pendleton, born on 13 September 1818, was educated at the university of Ghent and at St. Aidan's College, Birkenhead. After being ordained in the diocese of Winchester, he served as curate of St. Martin's, Guernsey, from December 1849 to June 1851, and as senior curate of St. Helier, Jersey, from August 1851 to July 1853. Work with the Waldensians He was consular chaplain to the British residents at Montevideo, Uruguay from 6 May 1854 to 31 December 1858. During his residence there 150 Waldensians, impelled by the scarcity of employment in Piedmont, left their native country and landed in Montevideo. They were followed in 1858 by about a hundred more, when the whole party settled at Florida, about sixty miles from the city. Jesuit opposition arose and the Waldensian settlers, under Pendleton's personal direction, moved to another locality known as the Rosario Oriental, where his influence obtained for them a church and a school-room. The Piedmontese Waldesian settlement prospered in the department (district) of Colonia, a few miles west of Montevideo where the town of \\"Colonia Valdense\\" can now be found. The district is the most prosperous of Uruguay- Latin America nation where Roman Catholicism was least influential. In 1857 a visitation of yellow fever swept over Monte Video, and Pendleton's services during the crisis were acknowledged by the French government, which granted him a gold medal. A similar recognition followed him from the Italian government. From 1863 to 31 December 1868 he was chaplain to the British residents at Florence. In 1862 and again in 1867 he revisited the Waldensian colony at Rosario Oriental. He resided at the Casa Fumi, Porta Romana, Florence, until 1876, when he removed to Sydenham, Kent. There he served as curate of St Bartholomew's Church till 1879. He was then curate of Ampthill, Bedfordshire, for two years, and finally became rector of St Sampson's, Guernsey, in 1882. Death and legacy He died at St Sampson's rectory, Guernsey, on 13 Sept. 1888. He wrote Lettres Pastorales in 1851, and published various sermons in English and French between 1852 and 1868.

The name was derived from the Jutish name Wihtwara (\\"Men of Wiht\\"). Its capital was a fort named Wihtwarasburgh. It has been suggested that the modern-day village of Carisbrooke was built on top of Wihtwarasburgh due to the fact that they share their location. It has also been suggested that Wihtwarasburgh was built on top of a pre-existing Roman fort, but this has not been proven. Jutish history Wihtland was the name given to the Isle of Wight. The Wihtwara were the people of Wihtland, supposedly after Wihtgar who, along with Stuf, was one of the two earliest kings of Wihtland (from 512, as recorded by St Bede). Wihtgar and Stuf were supposedly nephews of Cerdic, the founder of the Wessex dynasty known only as the Gewisse (literally \\"Allies\\").While the Gewisse dynasty has never been given a name, presumably it would have been named after its founder ‚Äî just as the kings of Kent and East Anglia were, respectively, the Oiscings and Wuffings after Oisc and Wuffa. Some scholars have suggested that Wihtgar may have been fictitious: that is, the central figure of a founding myth invented retrospectively, to justify the name.Stenton, Yorke et al. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle differs, however, instead claiming that Wihtgar and Stuf received the land from Cerdic's son Cynric in 534, with the death of Wihtgar taking place in 544. Subsequent kings are unknown until the final Jutish king, Arwald, who was probably born in the mid 7th Century. In 661 Wulfhere of Mercia conquered Wessex and gave the overlordship to his godson, King Aethelwalh of Sussex and forced the Islanders to convert to Christianity. After Wulfhere's departure the island returned to paganism. Arwald was reportedly killed resisting an invasion in 686 by King Caedwalla of Wessex (under the tutelage of St Wilfrid) together with his brother Mul of Kent. According to Bede, Caedwalla \\"endeavoured to destroy all the inhabitants\\" of Wihtland and to replace them with his own followers. When Caedwalla died a few years later, wounds sustained in the fierce fighting the Wihtwara were reputedly responsible. The only recorded survivor from the alleged massacres of the Wihtwara, was Arwald's sister (whose name is now unknown); through her its ruling dynasty became ancestors of later Anglo-Saxon kings. Arwald's sister was married to King Egbert of Kent (at the time also a Jutish kingdom besieged by Caedwalla and his brother, Mul). Arwald's sister was therefore, apparently, the mother of King Wihtred of Kent and grandmother of √Üthelbert II of Kent. √Üthelbert was the grandfather of Egbert of Wessex, who was, in turn, the paternal grandfather of King Alfred the Great. Later Middle Ages After the Norman Conquest the Isle of Wight was given to the de Redvers family in 1101 who were known as \\"Lords of the Isle of Wight\\". However the last of them was Izabel de Forz (also known as Isabella de Fortibus; 1237‚Äì1293), who was known informally as the \\"Queen of the Isle of Wight\\". Forz was visited shortly before her death by King Edward Longshanks (known later as Edward I), who said later that she had sold the Isle of Wight to him for 6,000 marks. The village of Queens Bower is said to be named after her. In 1444, Henry Beauchamp, Duke of Warwick a favourite of King Henry VI was given the title (or perhaps nickname) of King of the Isle of Wight. Beauchamp died shortly afterwards and the title was not used again.of National Biography (New York: Macmillan, 1985) vol. 4, p. 28 The closest existing title at that time - the Lordship of the Isle of Wight - was held by the uncle of King Henry VI, Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester, after being bestowed it in 1434.

It has been designated as a grade I listed building. Apart from the Bishop's Palace, Wells it is the oldest house in the county. The original 13th-century buildings have been added to several times, including a 15th-century great hall which has an arch-braced-collar truss roof. Several of the rooms have wall paintings which have been uncovered and restored since the National Trust were given the building in 1970. The house belonged to the Bishop of Bath and Wells and at one time was used to store the Great Seal of the Realm when John Langton was the chancellor of England. History The Treasurer's House is a medieval priest's house built from Hamstone during the 13th century. The solar block, which was built around 1250 survives as the oldest part of the building, making it the second oldest inhabited house in Somerset. It is mentioned as the parsonage attached to the village Church of All Saints. In 1227 it was acquired by Hugh of Wells the treasurer of Wells Cathedral who became the rector and patron of the church. The great hall was added in 1293. In 1297 John Langton, who was a chancellor of England and Bishop of Chichester, received the Great Seal of the Realm which was stored at the \\"court at Martock\\". The kitchen was added in the 15th century. The Bishop of Bath owned the building, which was known as Martock Priory, until 1849 when it was transferred to the Ecclesiastical Commissioners. It was then privately owned and a small wing added. In 1943 it was bought by Harold St George Gray, the librarian-curator of the Museum for the Somerset Archaeological and Natural History Society to preserve it. His wife bequeathed it to the National Trust in 1970. In 1987 it was designated as a Grade I listed building. Architecture The house and garden The building has undergone various extensions and alterations since it was built. The building has a T shaped plan with the west projecting wing being a hall added in the late 13th century. The great hall has a 15th-century four bay open arch-braced collar-truss timber roof. The roof was covered with slate from local quarries until it was thatched in the mid 19th century. The current clay tiles were used in the early 20th century. The kitchen block was added in the late 15th century or early 16th century and has no direct connection with the rest of the house. The Solar Block is the oldest part of the building dating from around 1250. It has a plate tracery window with a Trefoil cusping surrounded by wall paintings. The solar separated from the hall by a screens passage. The walls of one of the private chambers on the upper floor were covered with 16th century limewash which was removed in 1995, to expose a 13th-century wall painting with a depiction of Jesus on the cross and two other figures. The crucifixion scene with rosettes and vine leaf decoration was uncovered in the 1990s.

Professional counseling  The primary focus of counselor education is the training and preparation of professional counselors; this includes recruiting and training the future generations of academic professionals who will teach the curriculum of counseling theory and practice. Scholarship within counselor education centers on the training and education of master's or doctoral-level counseling graduate students, novel applications of counseling theory including competencies across cultural groups, and best practice guidelines in both academic and clinical or applied settings. Counselor educators as a professional group are trained in multiple methodological approaches to research including both qualitative and quantitative methods. Educational contents often include issues and trends related to multiculturalism, neuroscience, and other clinical considerations such as trauma and abuse assessment.  Licensure and accreditation  In order to acquire licensure, counselors are generally required to complete an accredited graduate program along with a minimum number of documented hours in supervised clinical fieldwork.https://onlinecounselingprograms.com/become-a- counselor/ Counselor Education degree programs can become accredited by The Council for the Accreditation of Counseling and Related Educational Programs. Rehabilitation Counselor Education degree programs can become accredited by The National Council on Rehabilitation Education.

It is situated at a higher elevation than most localities in the area, with an altitude of . The town is best known as the burial place of Lot, a fact already mentioned around 400 CE, when it was known as \\"Caphar Barucha\\". Following the Muslim conquest, its name was eventually Arabized as \\"Kafr al-Burayk.\\" The tomb of Lot was turned into a mosque during Islamic rule and remained so under Crusader rule. Later, the Arab tribe of \\"Bani Nu'aym\\" settled there, giving the town its current name, \\"Bani Na'im,\\" first used by Muslim scholar Abd al-Ghani al-Nabulsi in 1690. In the late 1930s the population took part in the Arab Revolt against the British Mandate. The town came under Jordanian rule after 1948, and was occupied by Israel in 1967. In 1997 it became part of the Palestinian Autonomy. Bani Na'im is a municipality of the Hebron Governorate. In 2007 it had a population of 20,084 inhabitants in. History =Byzantine period= Biblical scholar Edward Robinson identified the site with \\"Caphar Barucha\\", meaning \\"Village of Benediction\\" in Hebrew, mentioned by Saint Jerome (fl. around 400 CE) in connection with Abraham and Lot. Jerome wrote that Saint Paula, departing from Hebron, stopped at the height of Caphar Barucha and looked upon the surrounding region, remembering Lot and his sin. According to Jerome, Abraham observed the destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah from that location.Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 2, pp. 187-9 =Early Muslim through Mamluk periods= Following the Muslim conquest of the Levant, the name of the village eventually took the Arab form \\"Kafr Burayk\\", or in its vernacular form \\"Kefr Breik\\" or \\"Ibreik\\". Ali of Herat passed through the village in 1173 CE, noting that it was near Hebron and the burial place of Lot. Along with the town of Dura, Kafr al-Barik became a part of the waqf (\\"endowment\\") for the Ibrahimi Mosque (Cave of the Patriarchs) in Hebron on orders from the Ayyubid ruler of Damascus, al-Mu'azzam 'Isa on 2 May 1215. The 15th-century Muslim geographer al-Suyuti also acknowledged that Lot was buried in Kafr al-Barik and that in a cave west of the village, beneath an old mosque, laid \\"sixty prophets of whom twenty were Apostles.\\" He noted that Lot's tomb was a site of \\"visitation and veneration from ancient times, the men of the age succeeding those who have gone before.\\"le Strange, 1890, p.468. =Ottoman period= In 1517 the town was annexed to the Ottoman Empire along with the rest of the Levant. Kafr Burayk is included in the Ottoman tax registers of 1596, where it was listed in the Nahiya of Khalil of the Liwa of Quds.H√ºtteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 124 It had a population of 42 Muslim households who paid a fixed tax rate of 25% on various agricultural products, including wheat, barley, vineyards or fruit trees, grape syrup or molasses, and goats or beehives; a total of 10,500 ak√ße. The first mention of the name \\"Bani Na'im\\" is by Muslim scholar Abd al- Ghani al-Nabulsi in 1690. He wrote that the village had been known as \\"Kafr al-Barik\\" and \\"now it is called Qaryat Bani Nu'aym in a diminutive form.\\" It received this name from the Bedouin tribe of Bani Nu'aym, also referred to as Bani Na'im, who settled there after migrating from the vicinity of Petra in Transjordan. Until the end of the 19th century, the early Arabic name was still known by the residents, as mentioned by Western travellers. Robinson visited Bani Na'im in 1838, noting that it was a village with a mosque, \\"lying on very high ground, to which the ascent is gradual on every side, forming a conspicuous object to all the region far and near\\".Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 2, p. 187 When the French traveler Victor Gu√©rin visited in 1860, he found the village almost deserted since the population had left to live in tents as nomads to avoid military conscription.Gu√©rin, 1869, pp. 153‚Äì157. Beni-Na'√Øm est un village en ce moment presque enti√®rement d√©sert, car la plupart des habitants ont quitt√© leurs masons pour aller vivre, sous la tente, de la vie nomade, et t√¢cher d'√©chapper ainsi √† la loi du recrutement militaire. He found them living in a tent village one kilometer away, ready to flee to the desert if an attempt was made to enlist them. However, in 1874 the PEF's Survey of Western Palestine (SWP) described it as \\"a good-sized village\\" bordered by olive groves to the south and west with many structures built out of ancient materials.Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. 325 The residences there were mostly one-story stone cabins.Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. 303 In their second visit in 1881 the SWP described Bani Na'im as well-cultivated with abundant flocks that grazed in desert areas east of the town.Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, p. 304 The town was a major supplier of sand for the Hebron glass industry. For much of the latter half of Ottoman rule, Bani Na'im was under the administration of the Mutasarif of Jerusalem. Bani Na'im grew considerably in population during the early 20th century.Sharon, 1999, p. 12-13 =British Mandate= British forces after battling Palestinian Arab irregulars in Bani Na'im during the 1936‚Äì39 Arab revolt in Palestine Bani Na'im grew in population during the British Mandate for Palestine. It joined the 1936‚Äì39 Arab revolt as the site of a battle between the irregular Palestinian Arab forces of Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni and the British Army. In December 1937, British forces ordered the demolition of a house whose owners were accused of involvement in an anti-British incident near the town. They fined Bani Na'im's mukhtars (town chiefs) 50 British pounds and ordered the residents to carry 200 kilograms of explosives to the building for its demolition and watch the explosion as a deterrent measure. Palestinian Arab irregulars led by Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni and his local commander, Abd al- Halim Jawlani, battled British Army forces in Bani Na'im in December 1938. According to British military accounts, a resident of Bani Na'im called for intervention when the rebels entered the town. Israeli scholar Hillel Cohen wrote that Fakhri Nashashibi, a political rival of al-Husayni, informed military authorities on three rebel units forcing Bani Na'im's largely pro- Nashashibi inhabitants to join the revolt.Cohen, 2009, p.148. The British promptly confronted a force of 100 irregulars. With British Air Force assistance, al-Husayni's troops dispersed and fled east of Bani Na'im where they were pinned down. British forces killed 60 rebels and captured 15. One British soldier was killed. =Jordanian rule= Following the 1948 Arab‚ÄìIsraeli War, Bani Na'im was annexed by Jordan. =Israeli occupation= In June 1967, after the Six-Day War, the town came under Israeli occupation along with the rest of the West Bank. In 1982, an 18-year-old resident of the town was shot and killed by Jewish settlers from nearby Kiryat Arba. In 1987, during the First Intifada, a committee against the Israeli occupation was set up in Bani Na'im.Lockman and Beinin, 1989, p. 378 In May 1988, two residents were killed by the Israeli Army (IDF) in the center of the town.Watzman, 2007, p.107. =Palestinian autonomy= In 1997, in the wake of the 1995 Interim Agreement on the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, administrative control over Bani Na'im was transferred to the jurisdiction of the Palestinian National Authority (PNA). It consequently became a municipality. On August 31, 2010, four Israelis, two men and two women, were killed in a Hamas drive-by shooting on the road between Kiryat Arba and Bani Naim. The attack was condemned by Israel and the PNA. Today, Bani Na'im serves as a commercial center for Hebron area villages, although most government services are in Hebron. Tomb of Lot Maqam an-Nabi Yaqin\\"the prophet Yukin\\"; Palmer, 1881, p. 405 from the east Maqam an-Nabi Yaqin inscription Bani Na'im houses the tomb of Lot, a prophet in Islam and a righteous person in Judaism and Christianity, in the center of the town. The tomb is located within a rectangular-shaped mosque that contains an inner court and minaret. The lintel of the mosque's northern gate is built from stones dating to the Byzantine era when a church had possibly stood at the site. Lot's tomb was first mentioned by Saint Jerome, then by John of Wirtzburg in 1100, and Ali of Herat in 1173. While the Crusaders, who ruled the area from 1148 to 1187, were aware the tomb belonged to Lot, it remained a Muslim sanctuary unlike other Muslim edifices in Palestine which were converted to Christian use. In 1322, writer Sir John Mandeville writes \\"two miles from Hebron, is the grave of Lot, Abraham's brother.\\" Ibn Battuta noted in 1326 that the tomb was covered by a \\"fine building\\" made of white stone and without columns.Pringle, 1993, p. 107 Muslim writers al-Suyuti and Mujir ad-Din wrote in the 15th and 16th centuries, respectively, that Lot was buried in Bani Na'im. Tawfiq Canaan, a researcher of Palestinian popular heritage, described the golden embroidered writing on the red silk cloth covering the tomb as reading, \\"This is the tomb of prophet Lut, peace be upon him.\\"Canaan, 1927, pp. 21-22, cited in Sharon, 1999, p. 18 Islamic-era Kufic inscriptions on the front entrance to the mosque state that the Muslim scholar Abdullah bin Muhammad declared \\"the hills, the plains, the buildings, the paths, the gardens, the trees and the passage that transverses it [Bani Na'im]\\" are an endowment \\"for the prophet Lot, the son of Haran brother of Ibrahim (Abraham), the friend of the Compassionate (Allah), may the blessings of Allah be upon them ...\\"Sharon, 1999, p. 17 According to Muslim tradition, Lot lived in Bani Na'im before moving to Sodom.Sharon, 1999, p. 15 The shrine encasing the tomb was restored in 1410 by the Mamluk sultan an- Nasir Faraj, son of Sultan Barquq. The restoration work was entrusted by him to Shams al-Din al-Ansari, a member of the prominent Ansari family which specialized in religious endowments (waqf). The tomb of Lot's daughters are on an opposite hill nearby. To the southeast of Bani Na'im is a separate shrine dedicated to Lot, known as Maqam an-Nabi Yaqin (\\"Shrine of the Truthful Prophet.\\") Local legend claims Lot prayed at the site and imprints of his feet in a rock there are visible.Canaan, 1927, p. 78 According to Muslim and Christian tradition, Bani Na'im is the place where Abraham, after the departure of the angels, saw the smoke of Sodom and Gomorrah \\"rising as the smoke of a furnace.\\"Finn, 1877, p. 291 Geography and climate Bani Naim forms a generally rough rectangular layout, and widens in the northwest and southwest. The town covers a mountainous area, with an average altitude of above sea level. It is to southeast of Hebron, however the two localities have virtually merged with each other. The Israeli settlement of Kiryat Arba is situated northwest of Bani Na'im, between it and Hebron. To its south lies the village of Hureiz and the town of Yatta, to the north are Sa'ir and ash- Shuyukh, while Halhul and the forest of Hebron lie to the west. Bani Na'im's lands extend east to the mountains that overlook the Dead Sea. Bani Na'im's total land area is about 157,000 dunams, but the town's built-up areas amount to roughly 2,500 dunams. The town itself is mostly located in Area A (Palestinian security and civilian administration) and Area B (Palestinian civil administration and Israeli military control.) The nearby town of ar- Rawa'in to the east is located within Bani Na'im's municipal jurisdiction and is under Area A. However, the Israeli settlement of Ma'ale Hever which was established in 1982, has a population of 400 and is also located within the Bani Na'im's municipal borders, comes under full Israeli control. Most of Bani Na'im's lands (59.6%) fall under \\"Area C,\\" or full Israeli security and civilian administration. Average annual rainfall in Bani Na'im is . The average temperature is and the average annual humidity is 61%. Demographics An Ottoman village list of about 1870 showed that Beni Na'im had 67 houses and a population of 145 inhabitants, though the population count included only men.Socin, 1879, p. 144Hartmann, 1883, p. 142 also found 67 houses In a census conducted in 1922 by the British Mandate authorities, Bani Na'im had a population of 1,279 inhabitants, all Muslims,Barron, 1923, Table V, p.10 rising to 1,646 Muslims, in 320 houses, according to the 1931 census.Mills, 1932, p. 27 In the 1945 statistics, it increased to 2,160 according to an official land and population survey.Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics, 1945, p. 23Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. Village Statistics, April, 1945. Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. 50 Under Jordanian rule, in 1952, the population surged to 5,778, partly due to large numbers of Palestinian refugees who settled in the town as a result of the 1948 Arab-Israeli War. Later, the number of inhabitants declined due to the emigration of refugees from the town to other parts of the West Bank and Jordan. In 1961, the population of Bani Na'im was 3,392.Government of Jordan, Department of Statistics, 1964, p. 14 By 1967, there were 4,271 inhabitants in the town, gradually increasing to 6,703. In 1987, the population rose to roughly 7,600 people. In the 1997 census carried out by the Palestinian Central Bureau of Statistics (PCBS), Bani Na'im had 13,535 inhabitants of which 604 were refugees. The gender distribution was 6,779 males and 6,756 females. In the 2007 census, there were 20,084 people living in the town and 217 in nearby Masaferet Bani Na'im which is located within the municipal jurisdiction. The gender makeup of Bani Na'im's population was 50.2% male and 49.8% female. There were 3,490 housing units and the average household size consisted of 6.5 family members. Bani Na'im's inhabitants accounted for 3.67% of the Hebron Governorate's population and the town is officially considered an urban area. The inhabitants are Muslims and 16 mosques are present throughout the town. The main families are al-Manasrah (the largest), Zeidan, Trayrah, Humeidat, Ubeid, Harahsheh and Amr. Government Bani Na'im was established as a village council in 1971. After most of the built-up areas of Bani Na'im were transferred to \\"Area A,\\" giving the Palestinian National Authority full control of the town, a municipal council was established on May 20, 1997. The first council was formed from the old members of the previous village council. The council was made up of seven members, while there were 18 municipal employees. The amount of municipal seats was expanded to 13 during the Palestinian municipal elections in 2005. A local group, the Bani Na'im Martyrs list, won the most seats: five. The Al-Aqsa list won three seats, Independent lists also won three and the Hamas-backed Reform and Change list won the remaining two seats. Gender-wise, females won two seats and males eleven. Issa Hassan al-Khdour, member of the Bani Na'im Martyrs, had the most votes (3,281), and thus became the head of the municipality. In addition, the number of municipal employees increased to 30. The municipal borders of Bani Na'im extend beyond the town and include the following villages: Birin, ar- Rawa'in and Masaferet Bani Na'im. The latter is a grouping of the following hamlets: Mantiqat al-Ein, Mantiqat as-Sahel, Mantiqat Qaber K'heil, Mantiqat Hilmi, Mantiqat al-Hamra, Mantiqat al-Qurun, Mantiqat al-Mathbah, Mantiqat as- Sweidat, Mantiqat Um ar-Raqam and Khor 'Atara. Despite having a municipality, most official services are provided by the city of Hebron. However, Bani Na'im has a police station, a post office, and a local security office. Education and health Bani Na'im has 14 schools: 7 boys' schools, 5 girls' schools and 2 co-educational schools. The first school was established in 1929. Consisting of one classroom, the enrollment at the time did not exceed 20 female and male students and the highest grade level was the fourth grade. According to the 2007 census, 92.2% of the population was literate; most of the illiterate population was female. A total of 3,613 students were in elementary school, 3,601 in preparatory school, and 1,862 in high school. 958 people had college diplomas; 49 had academic degrees higher than a BA. In 2009, the municipality reported a shortage of classrooms. Most of Bani Na'im's health facilities are privately owned. The town has a maternity hospital, five health clinics, three dental clinics and a physiotherapy center. The Palestinian Ministry of Health runs a childcare center and medical lab in the town, while an additional health center and an x-ray center are run by a charitable society. In addition, there are five pharmacies in Bani Na'im. In 2009, the town had one ambulance. Residents travel to Hebron for emergency treatment. Economy and infrastructure Bani Na'im serves as a commercial center in the Hebron area. Approximately 50% of the labor force is engaged in the industrial and civil service sector. About 20% are employed in the Israeli labor market while 19% work in agriculture. Economic enterprises include four stone-cutting factories, a brick factory, a textile factory, an olive press, eleven metal workshops, four carpentry workshops, seven butcher shops, 13 clothing stores, and 110 other shops. Decline in market demand combined with movement restrictions imposed by the Israeli military have led to a deterioration of the local economy, particularly in the trade and the stone-cutting industries. In 2007, unemployment reached 30%. Consequently, many unemployed persons began looking into agriculture to earn income. The most cultivated crops are grains, especially barley, followed by lentils and chick peas. A sizable segment of the population raise livestock and 10% breed their own domestic animals. In total, there are 144 cows, 7,000 goats, 14,000 sheep, and 500 beehives. Much of the town's agricultural products are sold in Hebron. There are 4,244 buildings in Bani Na'im, of which 3,452 are houses and 213 are working establishments. Pipe water reaches more than 95% of the residents. The water pipe line, in length, is linked to the main water supply of the Israeli settlement of Efrat, south of Bethlehem. Around of main and sub lines were recently repaired. The cost of this project was roughly one million NIS. In 1994, Bani Na'im was linked to the electricity grid and the municipality installed street lights. Before then, generators operated for five hours daily at most and for house use only.

Historiographic issues about the American Civil War include the name of the war, the origins or causes of the war (slavery or states' rights), and President Abraham Lincoln's views and goals regarding slavery. The question of how important the tariff was in causing the war stems from the Nullification Crisis, which was South Carolina's attempt to nullify a tariff and lasted from 1828 to 1832. The tariff was low after 1846, and the tariff issue faded into the background by 1860 when secession began. States' rights was the justification for nullification and later secession. The most controversial right claimed by Southern states was the alleged right of Southerners to spread slavery into territories owned by the United States. Under Lincoln's leadership, the war was fought to preserve the Union. With slavery so deeply divisive, Union leaders by 1862 reached the decision that slavery had to end in order for the Union to be restored. Union war evolved as the war progressed in response to political and military issues, and historians do not use them to explain the causes of the war. The key new issues were the elimination of slavery and the legal and economic status of the freed slaves. Economic issues Abraham Lincoln Slavery was the major cause of the American Civil War, with the South seceding to form a new country to protect slavery, and the North refusing to allow that. Historians generally agree that other economic conflicts were not a major cause of the war. Economic historian Lee A. Craig reports, \\"In fact, numerous studies by economic historians the past several decades reveal that economic conflict was not an inherent condition of North- South relations during the antebellum era and did not cause the Civil War.\\"Craig in Woodworth, ed. The American Civil War: A Handbook of Literature and Research (1996), p. 505 When numerous groups tried at the last minute in 1860‚Äì61 to find a compromise to avert war, they did not turn to economic policies.Donald 2001 pp 134-38 =Regional economic differences= The South, Midwest, and Northeast had quite different worldviews. They traded with each other and each became more prosperous by staying in the Union, a point many businessmen made in 1860‚Äì61. However, Charles A. Beard in the 1920s made a highly influential argument to the effect that these differences caused the war (rather than slavery or constitutional debates). He saw the industrial Northeast forming a coalition with the agrarian Midwest against the Plantation South. Critics pointed out that his image of a unified Northeast was incorrect because the region was highly diverse with many different competing economic interests. In 1860‚Äì61, most business interests in the Northeast opposed war. After 1950, only a few mainstream historians accepted the Beard interpretation, though it was accepted by libertarian economists.Woolworth, ed. The American Civil War: A Handbook of Literature and Research (1996), 145 151 505 512 554 557 684; Richard Hofstadter, The Progressive Historians: Turner, Beard, Harrington (1969); for one dissenter see Marc Signal. \\"The Beards Were Right: Parties in the North, 1840‚Äì1860\\". Civil War History 47, no. 1. (2001): 30-56. As Historian Kenneth Stampp‚Äî who abandoned Beardism after 1950 ‚Äî sums up the scholarly consensus: \\"Most historians...now see no compelling reason why the divergent economies of the North and South should have led to disunion and civil war; rather, they find stronger practical reasons why the sections, whose economies neatly complemented one another, should have found it advantageous to remain united.\\"Also from =Tariffs= The Southerners in Congress set the federal tariffs on imported goods, especially the low tariff rates in 1857; this led to resentment by Northern industrialists. Controversy over whether slavery was at the root of the tariff issue dates back at least as far as the Lincoln-Douglas debates of 1858.Lincoln-Douglas debate at Alton, October 15, 1858 During the debate at Alton, Lincoln said that slavery was the root cause of the Nullification crisis over a tariff, while his challenger Stephen Douglas disagreed. John C. Calhoun, who led South Carolina's attempt to nullify a tariff, supported tariffs and internal improvements at first, but came to oppose them in the 1820s as sectional tensions between North and South grew along with the increasingly sectional nature of slavery. Calhoun was a plantation owner who helped develop the positive good theory of slavery.James McPherson, The War of Southern Aggression Also, Calhoun said that slavery was the cause of the Nullification Crisis.As early as 1830, in the midst of the Nullification Crisis, Calhoun identified the right to own slaves as the chief southern minority right being threatened. As Calhoun said: \\"I consider the tariff act as the occasion, rather than the real cause of the present unhappy state of things. The truth can no longer be disguised, that the peculiar domestick [sic] institution of the Southern States and the consequent direction which that and her soil have given to her industry, has placed them in regard to taxation and appropriations in opposite relation to the majority of the Union, against the danger of which, if there be no protective power in the reserved rights of the states they must in the end be forced to rebel, or, submit to have their paramount interests sacrificed, their domestic institutions subordinated by Colonization and other schemes, and themselves and children reduced to wretchedness.\\" - Ellis, Richard E. The Union at Risk: Jacksonian Democracy, States' Rights, and the Nullification Crisis (1987), page 193; Freehling, William W. Prelude to Civil War: The Nullification Crisis in South Carolina 1816‚Äì1836. (1965), page 257 - Ellis further notes that \\"Calhoun and the nullifiers were not the first southerners to link slavery with states' rights. At various points in their careers, John Taylor, John Randolph, and Nathaniel Macon had warned that giving too much power to the federal government, especially on such an open-ended issue as internal improvement, could ultimately provide it with the power to emancipate slaves against their owners' wishes.\\" While most leaders of Southern secession in 1860 mentioned slavery as the cause, Robert Rhett was a free trade extremist who opposed the tariff. However, Rhett was also a slavery extremist who wanted the Constitution of the Confederacy to legalize the African Slave Trade.William C. Davis, Look Away!, page 67 Republicans also saw support for a Homestead Act, a higher tariff and a transcontinental railroad as a flank attack on the slave power.James McPherson, Battle Cry of Freedom, page 225 There were enough Southern Senators in the U. S. Senate to keep the tariff low after 1846.Allan Nevins, Ordeal of the Union: A House Dividing - 1852‚Äì1857, pages 267‚Äì269 Even when the tariff was higher three decades before the war, only South Carolina revolted, and the issue was nullification, not secession. The tariff was much lower by 1861. When the Confederacy was formed it set a very high 15% tariff on all imports, including imports from the United States =Free labor vs. pro-slavery arguments= Historian Eric Foner has argued that a free-labor ideology dominated thinking in the North, which emphasized economic opportunity. By contrast, Southerners described free labor as \\"greasy mechanics, filthy operators, small-fisted farmers, and moonstruck theorists\\".James McPherson, \\"Antebellum Southern Exceptionalism: A New Look at an Old Question,\\" Civil War History 50#4 (2004), page 421 They strongly opposed the proposed Homestead Acts that would give out free farms in the West, fearing the small farmers would oppose plantation slavery. Indeed, opposition to homestead laws was far more common in secessionist rhetoric than opposition to tariffs.Richard Hofstadter, \\"The Tariff Issue on the Eve of the Civil War\\", The American Historical Review 44#1 (1938), pp. 50-55 full text in JSTOR =Economic status of ex-slaves= The Union government set up the Freedmen's Bureau to supervise and protect the legal and economic status of the freed slaves. It operated across the former slave states 1865-1872. Proposals were made to seize Confederate property and give land (\\"Forty acres and a mule\\") to freedmen, but Congress never approved.LaWanda Cox, \\"The promise of land for the freedmen.\\" Mississippi Valley Historical Review 45.3 (1958): 413-440. online States' rights issues Jefferson Davis, President of the Confederacy Questions such as whether the Union was older than the states or the other way around fueled the debate over states' rights. Whether the federal government was supposed to have substantial powers or whether it was merely a voluntary federation of sovereign states added to the controversy. According to historian Kenneth M. Stampp, each section used states' rights arguments when convenient, and shifted positions when convenient.Stampp, The Causes of the Civil War, page 59 Stampp mentioned Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens' A Constitutional View of the Late War Between the States as an example of a Southern leader who said that slavery was the \\"cornerstone of the Confederacy\\" when the war began and then said that the war was not about slavery but states' rights after Southern defeat. Stampp said that Stephens became one of the most ardent defenders of the Lost Cause.Stampp, The Causes of the Civil War, pages 63‚Äì65 The historian William C. Davis also mentioned inconsistencies in Southern states' rights arguments. He explained the Confederate Constitution's protection of slavery at the national level as follows: =States' rights and slavery in the territories= The \\"States' rights\\" debate cut across the issues. Southerners argued that the federal government was strictly limited and could not abridge the rights of states as reserved in the Tenth Amendment, and so had no power to prevent slaves from being carried into new territories. States' rights advocates also cited the fugitive slave clause to demand federal jurisdiction over slaves who escaped into the North. Anti-slavery forces took reversed stances on these issues. The fugitive slave clause in the Constitution was the result of compromises between North and South when the Constitution was written. It was later strengthened by the fugitive slave law that was part of the Compromises of 1850. The Southern politician and states' rights advocate John C. Calhoun regarded the territories as the \\"common property\\" of sovereign states, and said that Congress was acting merely as the \\"joint agents\\" of the states.McPherson, Battle Cry, page 57 =States' rights and minority rights= Frederick Douglass States' rights theories were a response to the fact that the Northern population was growing much faster than the population of the South, which meant that it was only a matter of time before the North controlled the federal government. Southerners were acting as a \\"conscious minority\\", and hoped that a strict constructionist interpretation of the Constitution would limit federal power over the states, and that a defense of states' rights against federal encroachments or even nullification or secession would save the South.Kenneth M. Stampp, The Causes of the Civil War, page 14 Before 1860 most presidents were either Southern or pro-South. The North's growing population would mean the election of pro-North presidents, and the addition of free-soil states would end Southern parity with the North in the Senate. As the historian Allan Nevins described the Southern politician John C. Calhoun's theory of states' rights, \\"Governments, observed Calhoun, were formed to protect minorities, for majorities could take care of themselves\\".Nevins, Ordeal of the Union: Fruits of Manifest Destiny 1847‚Äì1852, page 155 Jefferson Davis stated that a \\"disparaging discrimination\\" and a fight for \\"liberty\\" against \\"the tyranny of an unbridled majority\\" gave the Confederate states a right to secede.Jefferson Davis' Second Inaugural Address, Virginia Capitol, Richmond, February 22, 1862 Transcribed from Dunbar Rowland, ed., Jefferson Davis, Constitutionalist, Volume 5, pp. 198‚Äì203. Summarized in The Papers of Jefferson Davis, Volume 8, p. 55. In 1860, Congressman Laurence M. Keitt of South Carolina said, \\"The anti-slavery party contend that slavery is wrong in itself, and the Government is a consolidated national democracy. We of the South contend that slavery is right, and that this is a confederate Republic of sovereign States.\\"Lawrence Keitt, Congressman from South Carolina, in a speech to the House on January 25, 1860: Congressional Globe. The South's chosen leader, Jefferson Davis, defined equality in terms of the equal rights of states,When arguing for the equality of states, Jefferson Davis said, \\"Who has been in advance of him in the fiery charge on the rights of the States, and in assuming to the Federal Government the power to crush and to coerce them? Even to-day he has repeated his doctrines. He tells us this is a Government which we will learn is not merely a Government of the States, but a Government of each individual of the people of the United States\\". - Jefferson Davis' reply in the Senate to William H. Seward, Senate Chamber, U.S. Capitol, February 29, 1860, From The Papers of Jefferson Davis, Volume 6, pp. 277-84. Transcribed from the Congressional Globe, 36th Congress, 1st Session, pp. 916‚Äì18. and opposed the declaration that all men are created equal.When arguing against equality of individuals, Davis said, \\"We recognize the fact of the inferiority stamped upon that race of men by the Creator, and from the cradle to the grave, our Government, as a civil institution, marks that inferiority\\". - Jefferson Davis' reply in the Senate to William H. Seward, Senate Chamber, U.S. Capitol, February 29, 1860, - From The Papers of Jefferson Davis, Volume 6, pp. 277-84. Transcribed from the Congressional Globe, 36th Congress, 1st Session, pp. 916‚Äì18. The Constitution does include states' rights elements in that each state has the same number of Senators, and certain rights are reserved to the states or to the people. Southerners such as Davis interpreted these rights as a shield against a numerical majority of Northerners. Clarification of causes When the Civil War began, no one said it had as goals civil and voting rights for African Americans, though the more radical of the abolitionists felt they had to come. They emerged as political goals during the war: the 13th Amendment was proposed in 1863. They became major issues during the Reconstruction era. At the outset of the war, though there was pressure to do so, not even the abolition of slavery was stated as a goal. While the existence of slavery in slave states could be tolerated, it was the issue of its expansion into the new Western territories that made the conflict irrepressible.McPherson, James M., Battle Cry, page 41 Slavery was at the root of economic, moral and political differencesKenneth M. Stampp, America in 1857: A Nation on the Brink (Oxford University Press, 1990), pages 110‚Äì113 that led to control issues, states' rights and secession. Slavery greatly increased the likelihood of secessionJames Ford Rhodes, Lectures on the American Civil War, pages 2‚Äì16 and 76‚Äì77 which in turn made war probable, irrespective of the North's stated war aims, which at first addressed strategic military concerns as opposed to ultimate political and Constitutional ones. Hostilities began as an attempt, from the Northern perspective, to defend the nation after it was attacked at Fort Sumter. Lincoln's war goals evolved as the war progressed. Lincoln mentioned the need for national unity in his March 1861 inaugural address after seven states had already declared their secession. At first Lincoln stressed the Union as a war goal to unite the War Democrats, border states and Republicans. In 1862 he added emancipation because it permanently removed the divisive issue of slavery that caused secession, an issue that Lincoln said was \\"somehow the cause of the war\\".Abraham Lincoln, Second Inaugural Address, March 4, 1865 In his 1863 Gettysburg Address he added preserving democracy to emancipation and the Union as a war goal. Related issues Hinton Rowan Helper's 1857 book The Impending Crisis of the South was banned in the South and publicized by Northern Republicans. Helper, a native of North Carolina, argued in his book that slavery was bad for the economic prospects of poor white Southerners.David Potter, The Impending Crisis, pages 386-388 Southern Courts refused to convict the owners of illegal slave ships such as the Echo and the Wanderer, even though hundreds of kidnapped Africans could die on a single voyage.Allan Nevins, The Emergence of Lincoln, vol. 1, pages 434-437 A significant number of Southern politicians attempted to relegalize the Atlantic slave tradeAllan Nevins, The Emergence of Lincoln, vol. 2, pages 33-37William W. Freehling, The Road to Disunion: Secessionists at Bay 1776‚Äì1854, page 22 and pass laws that would require every free black in the South to choose a master or mistress. Pro-slavery literature dominated the Southern media to the extent that famous Southern writers and poets didn't emerge until after the war. Many people on both sides of the war (with exceptions including Robert E. Lee and William T. Sherman) thought that the war would be short at first. Nineteenth-century Americans didn't believe in peacetime armies, and the process of building armies was time-consuming. War profiteers sold badly made equipment and rancid food at high prices when the war began. Confederate guerrillas or bushwhackers such as William Quantrill (see Quantrill Raiders), Bloody Bill Anderson, the Younger Brothers, and Jesse and Frank James killed pro-Union civilians in Missouri and Lawrence, Kansas. There were also attacks on Southern civilians by pro-Union Jayhawkers. The germ theory was rejected by the medical establishment until after the war, and a large number of soldier deaths were caused by this. Army surgeons used the same saw to amputate limbs of different soldiers without cleaning or sterilizing, and, although some anesthesia existed, it was rarely used, and many injured soldiers had to drink liquor or bite leather or a bullet during amputations. The North had its share of problems with desertion, bounty jumpers, and the New York Draft Riot. The South had even greater problems with desertion, especially during the last two years of the war. The vagaries of 19th-century law allowed some (including Union soldiers Daniel Sickles and Jefferson C. Davis and Southern secessionist William Yancey) to get away with murder, and required the execution of soldiers who fell asleep at their posts or for desertion. Lincoln pardoned many of the latter group of soldiers. Jefferson C. Davis (not to be confused with Confederate President Jefferson Davis) was especially notorious. He shot fellow Union soldier William \\"Bull\\" Nelson during an argument, and later pulled up a bridge to keep emancipated slaves from following Sherman's army. Trapped ex-slaves were then killed by Confederate Wheeler's army, and others drowned trying to flee into Ebenezer Creek. Women who raised money for a sanitary fair needed the written permission of their husbands to send the money to Union hospitals. Any money a married woman had legally belonged to her husband. There were many flag controversies. The original Confederate flag was the Stars and Bars, which looked similar to the Union Stars and Stripes and caused confusion on battle fields. The Stars and Bars was replaced with the Stainless Banner, which was mostly white, and was sometimes mistaken for a white flag of surrender when the wind was down. Near the end of the war, a red vertical bar was added to the right edge of the flag to show that the South would never surrender, although this flag was quickly followed by Appomattox and Confederate defeat. The Confederacy had other flags as well, including the Bonnie Blue Flag. The Confederate Battle Flag was originally the flag of the Army of Northern Virginia, and was square. Modern Confederate flag controversies include the Confederate Battle Flag design that was added to the Georgia state flag as a protest against civil rights for blacks. Decades later, Georgia flaggers claimed that the Confederate Battle Flag design was a symbol of Southern heritage, although others saw it as a symbol of the Klan and slavery. The flag was redesigned by governor Barnes and redesigned again with the Stars and Bars replacing the Confederate Battle Flag on the Georgia state flag. South Carolina had a Confederate Battle Flag first above and then next to the state capitol, which stirred controversy that local newspapers referred to as the \\"flag flap\\"; it was removed after extensive local debate and a 2/3 vote of both houses of the South Carolina Legislature. Mississippi residents voted to keep the controversial Confederate Battle Flag as part of the Mississippi state flag.

Established in October, 2002, the UNMC aimed to increase support to achieve the Millennium Development Goals and seek a coalition of partners for action. The Millennium Campaign targets intergovernmental, government, civil society organizations and media at both global and regional levels. Background In 2000, leaders of 189 countries assembled in New York to outline a series of targets to address the most serious challenges in the developing world. The MDGs were an eight-point road map with measurable targets and clear deadlines for improving the lives of the world's poorest people. World leaders have agreed to achieve the MDGs by 2015. Establishment =Establishment= In October 2002, two years after the Millennium Declaration was signed, the Millennium Campaign was established by then-Secretary General Kofi Annan and UNDP Administrator Mark Malloch Brown as a response to the failing efforts of governments in keeping their promises and commitments to achieve the MDGs by the target year 2015. =Purpose= Consistent with the call in the Monterrey Consensus for a ‚Äúglobal information campaign‚Äù, the Millennium Campaign aims to increase support for development assistance, trade opportunities, debt relief, technology transfer and other support needed to achieve the MDGs and, in the process, encourage the emergence of broad, self-sustaining and pragmatic coalitions of partners for action on the MDGs. The global Millennium Campaign targets intergovernmental and international bodies/forums at global and regional levels; national governments and legislatures; civil society organizations; the private sector; and the media.

Town of McCormick, 321 U.S. 573 (1944), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that people who earn their living by selling or distributing religious materials should not be required to pay the same licensing fees and taxes as those who sell or distribute non-religious materials..  Facts of the case  Follett was convicted of violating an ordinance of the town of McCormick, South Carolina which provided: '... the following license on business, occupation and professions to be paid by the person or persons carrying on or engaged in such business, occupation or professions within the corporate limits of the Town of McCormick, South Carolina: Agents selling books, per day $1.00, per year $15.00.' Follett was a Jehovah's Witness and had been certified by the Watch Tower Bible & Tract Society as 'an ordained minister of Jehovah God to preach the gospel of God's kingdom under Christ Jesus.' He is a resident of McCormick, South Carolina, where he went from house to house distributing certain books. He obtained his living from the money received; he had no other source of income. He claimed that he merely offered the books for a 'contribution'. But there was evidence that he 'offered to and did sell the books'. He had no license from the town and refused to obtain one. Prior history At his trial, Follett moved for a directed verdict of not guilty at the close of the evidence, claiming that the ordinance restricted freedom of worship in violation of the First Amendment which the Fourteenth Amendment makes applicable to the States. The motion was overruled and appellant was found guilty by the jury in the Mayor's Court. That judgment was affirmed by the Circuit Court of General Sessions for McCormick County and then by the Supreme Court of South Carolina. The Supreme Court of South Carolina recognized the principles established in Jones v. Opelika and Murdock v. Pennsylvania but had asserted that this case was different from the Murdock and Opelika decisions. It pointed out that Follett was not an itinerant, but was a resident of the town where the canvassing took place, and that the principle of the Murdock decision was applicable only to itinerant preachers. It stated, moreover, that appellant earned his living \\"by the sale of books,\\" that his \\"occupation was that of selling books, and not that of colporteur,\\" that \\"the sales proven were more commercial than religious.\\" It concluded that the \\"license was required for the selling of books, not for the spreading of religion.\\" Decision of the court =Majority opinion= Justice Douglas delivered the opinion of the Court. The decision held that the municipal ordinance was violative of the freedom of worship guaranteed by the First and Fourteenth Amendments when applied to an evangelist or preacher who distributed religious tracts in his hometown and who made his livelihood from such activity. =Concurring opinions= In his concurring opinion, Justice Frank Murphy addressed concerns that had been raised by the dissenting justices that the majority decision would \\"[open] the door to exemption of wealthy religious institutions, like Trinity Church in New York City, from the payment of taxes on property investments from which support is derived for religious activities.\\" Murphy rebutted these arguments by stating that \\"(t)here is an obvious difference between taxing commercial property and investments undertaken for profit, whatever use is made of the income, and laying a tax directly on an activity that is essentially religious in purpose and character or on an exercise of the privilege of free speech and free publication.\\" References External links Category:United States Supreme Court cases Category:United States Supreme Court cases of the Stone Court Category:United States free exercise of religion case law Category:Jehovah's Witnesses litigation in the United States Category:1944 in United States case law Category:1944 in religion Category:Christianity and law in the 20th century ","title":"Follett v.

A defensive right-handed opening batsman and a good outfielder, Reggie Northway followed his older brother Edward in playing occasional games for Somerset from the 1929 season up to 1933. In his second match, against Cambridge University at Fenners in 1930, he made an unbeaten 75 which remained his highest first-class score. He played in 12 first-class games for Somerset in 1930, but only a handful over the next three years.CricketArchive https://cricketarchive.com/Archive/Players/3/3737/3737.html. Accessed 30 October 2007. Northway reappeared in first-class cricket for Northamptonshire in the 1936 season. Northamptonshire was a very weak side at this time, finishing last in the County Championship and failing to record a victory for four years from May 1935 to May 1939. Northway opened the batting for more than half of the matches in the 1936 season, batting alongside Fred Bakewell, the England Test batsman and the county's one genuine first-class player. In 17 matches he scored just 429 runs, with just one score of over 50 ‚Äì a 58 against his former county, Somerset, at Bath, when he batted for three hours. Northway is perhaps best remembered for the tragic end to his cricket career and that of his opening partner Bakewell. Travelling home from the final match of the season, where Northamptonshire had made a surprisingly good showing against the season's County Champions, Derbyshire, Northway's car overturned on the A6 road at Kibworth, Leicestershire. Northway was flung from the car and killed, his body being found in a roadside ditch. Bakewell, who had made an unbeaten 241 in Northamptonshire's second innings, had his arm crushed and despite optimism over several following years he never played first-class cricket again.

Hayer served as the Parliamentary Secretary for Multiculturalism and Immigration from 2005 to 2011. http://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/oic/arc_oic/0427_2008/search/CIVIX_DOCUMENT_ROOT_STEM:(Dave%20Hayer)?5#hit2 Hayer was noted as a voice for moderate Sikhs in Greater Vancouver and as a consistent critic of terrorism and Sikh extremism. In 2010, an official with the Dashmesh Darbar Gurdwara (Sikh temple) that is extremely vocal in their support for the Khalistani separatist movement, advised Hayer and moderate Federal Sikh politician Ujjal Dosanjh that their attendance at an annual Sikh religious parade would be at their own risk; this prompted a police investigation, and prompted then-Premier Gordon Campbell to ask temple officials to apologize and Surrey mayor Dianne Watts to consider a review of the status of the following year‚Äôs parade. On July 7, 2012, Hayer announced that he would not seek re-election in the May 2013 provincial election. \\"Part of that decision was that if re-elected as MLA in May 2013, and then leave to run as an MP in 2015, it would have triggered an expensive by-election which would be costly for my constituents & that would have been the wrong thing to do for my community,\\" noted Hayer. In 2013, Hayer criticized the Liberal government's Quick Wins ethnic outreach scandal. Hayer's attempt to be nominated by the Conservative Party of Canada for the 2015 federal election in the riding of Cloverdale‚ÄîLangley City was defeated in November 2014 by Dean Drysdale.

Massachusetts, 321 U.S. 158 (1944), was a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States held that the government has broad authority to regulate the actions and treatment of children. Parental authority is not absolute and can be permissibly restricted if doing so is in the interests of a child's welfare. While children share many of the rights of adults, they face different potential harms from similar activities.  Background  A Jehovah's Witness woman named Sarah Prince was convicted for violating child labor laws. She was the guardian of a nine-year-old girl, Betty M. Simmons, whom she had brought into a downtown area to preach on the streets. The preaching involved distributing literature in exchange for voluntary contributions. The child labor laws that she was charged with violating stipulated that no boys under 12 and no girls under 18 were permitted to sell literature or other goods on public thoroughfares. There were three complaints filed against Prince: #Refusal to disclose her child's identity and age to a public officer whose duty was to enforce the statutes; #Furnishing the girl with magazines, knowing she was to sell them unlawfully, that is, on the street; and #As child's custodian, permitting her to work contrary to law. Both Prince and her husband were ordained ministers and commonly took their children out to distribute religious literature. Prince argued that the state's child labor laws violated her Fourteenth Amendment rights to exercise her religion and her equal protection rights, in particular because the children themselves were ministers of their religion as well.  Decision  In a 5‚Äì4 decision, with Justice Rutledge writing the majority opinion, the Supreme Court upheld the Massachusetts laws restricting the abilities of children to sell religious literature. The decision asserted that the government has broad authority to regulate the actions and treatment of children. Parental authority is not absolute and can be permissibly restricted if doing so is in the interests of a child's welfare. While children share many of the rights of adults, they face different potential harms from similar activities. One issue that the Court considered was whether a parent's presence makes it permissible for the child to engage in actions that would otherwise be prohibited. Noting that the dangers would still exist, the Court decided that the state was free to legislate against this activity, even if adults were allowed to engage in them. The opinion noted: > The family itself is not beyond regulation in the public interest, as > against a claim of religious liberty. And neither the rights of religion nor > the rights of parenthood are beyond limitation‚Ä¶. The right to practice > religion freely does not include the right to expose the community or the > child to communicable disease or the latter to ill-health or death.... > Parents may be free to become martyrs themselves. But it does not follow > they are free, in identical circumstances, to make martyrs of their children > before they have reached the age of full and legal discretion when they can > make that choice for themselves. Massachusetts has determined that an > absolute prohibition, though one limited to streets and public places and to > the incidental uses proscribed, is necessary to accomplish its legitimate > objectives. Its power to attain them is broad enough to reach these > peripheral instances in which the parent's supervision may reduce but cannot > eliminate entirely the ill effects of the prohibited conduct. We think that > with reference to the public proclaiming of religion, upon the streets and > in other similar public places, the power of the state to control the > conduct of children reaches beyond the scope of its authority over adults, > as is true in the case of other freedoms, and the rightful boundary of its > power has not been crossed in this case. Although the dispute did not involve a vaccination mandate, the court, citing the 1905 case of Jacobson v. Massachusetts, described vaccination as an example of a fundamental police power justifying the outcome in Prince. For this reason, Prince has at times also been cited by courts upholding the constitutionality of vaccination mandates.Brian Dean Abramson, Vaccine, Vaccination, and Immunization Law (Bloomberg Law, 2019), 6-10. =Dissenting opinions= Justice Frank Murphy dissented: \\"Religious freedom is too sacred a right to be restricted or prohibited in any degree without convincing proof that a legitimate interest of the state is in grave danger.\\" Justice Robert H. Jackson, joined by Justices Owen Roberts and Felix Frankfurter, also dissented. They agreed with the judgment of the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court. See also *Children's rights *Jacobson v.

Whether A. sulcata should be recognized as a synonym of A. viridis remains a matter of dispute.  Description  This sea anemone has two ecotypes; one has a basal disk up to in diameter and has fewer than 192 tentacles (usually 142 to 148); the other has a disk up to in diameter and 192 tentacles or more, up to 348. The tentacles are long, slender and tapering, arranged in six whorls round the central mouth on the oral disk. They vary in colour but are usually some shade of green, grey or light brown. A knob on the tip of each tentacle, where the stinging cells are concentrated, may be violet.  Distribution and habitat  This sea anemone is native to the Mediterranean Sea and the eastern Atlantic Ocean as far south as Western Sahara. It is found in the intertidal zone and the sublittoral zone, on rocky ledges, in crevices and on boulders. Ecotype 1 occurs down to about while ecotype 2 occurs down to about .  Biology  Anemonia sulcata has a symbiotic relationship with zooxanthellae, which inhabit the tissues and provide energy for the sea anemone. It is dioecious, with individuals becoming sexually mature when they weigh about and the basal disc measures about across. There are no gonads, and the germ cells develop inside the mesenteries and break through the epithelium to enter the body cavity and thence move into the water column. At this stage, the oocytes already contain symbiotic zooxanthellae. Fertilisation takes place in the sea. Breeding seems to take place throughout the year, but peaks between March and May. The sea anemones can also reproduce asexually. This sea anemone aggressively defends its territory from other individuals which are genetically dissimilar. It extends specialised tentacles (called acrorhagi), the tips of which have a concentration of cnidocytes (stinging cells); these sting the invader, causing tissue necrosis, and making the competitor move away.  Uses  Fried ortiguillas. This sea anemone is popular as a seafood in southern Spain, specially, C√°diz, where it is known as or ; for the fishery to be sustainable, the Andalusian authorities have set a minimum weight below which the sea anemones cannot be harvested. To neutralize the poison, the anemones are marinated in water with vinegar. The usual recipe is to batter them in flour and maybe egg and fry them in olive oil until they develop a crunchy cover. Ortiguilla omelets are also cooked.  Toxicity  Anemonia Sulcata have toxic cnidocysts organelles that are able to inject venom and cause an allergic reaction, particularly a skin reaction. Their stings are known to cause neurotoxicity and act on the sodium and potassium channels but also cause cytolysis on the cell membranes.Tezcan, O. D., and O. Gozer. 2015. Severe Toxic Skin Reaction Caused by a Common Anemone and Identification of the Culprit Organism. Journal of Travel Medicine 22:269‚Äì271. A research conducted in rabbits‚Äô ventricular myocytes were analyzed under exposure to these toxins to better understand their role. Specifically, toxin ll (ATX ll) derived from the Anemonia Sulcata was used in rabbit's myocytes to determine whether they induced the late sodium current causing overloading of sodium ions and consequently calcium ions inside the cell via reverse Na+/Ca2+ exchanger current. Since the heart depends heavily on the balance of Na+ and Ca2+ homeostasis, any unbalance from this can result in heart arrythmias. These toxins induce augmentations in diastolic Ca2+ concentration, calcium transient amplitude, and myocyte shortening therefore increasing serious cardiac failure and cell apoptosis.Cao, Z., Z.

Description  The main feature that distinguishes A. saurognathus from the ancestral Dissacus species is its size: Ankalagon grew to be as large as a bear,Paleocene mammals of the world \\"Carnivores, creodonts and carnivorous ungulates: Mammals become predators\\" as compared to the coyote or jackal-sized species of Dissacus. In fact, the only North American mesonychids that surpassed Ankalagon in size were the larger species of the Early Eocene genus, Pachyaena, such as P. gigantea and P. ossifraga, which, too, grew to the size of bears. Evidence of sexual dimorphism comes from an analysis of tooth and jaw size in two specimens of this genus, compared with unrelated, extant Carnivora (where the body size and sex of living individuals can be recorded and compared with their tooth size). Though the two Ankalagon jaws are of very different sizes, and one has much larger canines, the first two molars are close to the same size. As the size of the first two molars varies little in individuals of the same species even when body size is different, the study suggests two conclusions: first, that these two adult individuals are the same species, so Ankalagon had significant sexual dimorphism. Second, that size/weight estimates of Ankalagon and other fossil mammals with sexual dimorphism may not be trustworthy, since estimates are usually made with a formula based on the size of the first two molar teeth, and these teeth may be the same size in individuals of much different body sizes.  Ecology  The strong jaw musculature specialized for up-and-down biting rather than side-to-side grinding movement, and the triangular, laterally compressed premolars and molars with carnassial notches of Ankalagon are typical of mesonychids. Though no living group of animals has similar structures, these features suggest that A. saurognathus was carnivorous. Paleontologists believe that mesonychids would not have been able to slice meat as effectively as other carnivorous animals, but large genera like Ankalagon would have used their pointed teeth to grab a chunk of meat and their unusually strong jaw muscles to pull it free from a large carcass, perhaps bracing it with their front feet. Whether the genus was active hunters, scavengers, or both is unknown. The evidence of sexual dimorphism in Ankalagon suggests that they formed either permanent social groups (like a pride of lions) or temporary associations (like a lek of grouse) of one male and several females; all living species of Carnivora as well as Primates that show sexual dimorphism in canine size form mating groups of this type.  Etymology  The generic name refers to the dragon Ancalagon, who was mentioned in The Silmarillion by J.R.R. Tolkien. In The Silmarillion, Ancalagon was described as being one of the more powerful servants of the malevolent being, Morgoth, having been bred to be the fiercest, mightiest, and largest dragon in all of Middle Earth. According to Tolkien, \\"Ancalagon\\" translates from Sindarin as being anc 'jaw', alag 'impetuous'. The species name, \\"saurognathus,\\" translates as \\"lizard jaw.\\" Leigh Van Valen studied the New Mexico mesonychid Dissacus saurognathus and eventually came to the conclusion that D. saurognathus differed enough from the sympatric D. navajovius, and from other members of the genus to merit its own genus. Van Valen attempted to erect the new genus \\"Ancalagon\\" for \\"Dissacus\\" saurognathus in 1978. However, he later found that the name was already occupied by Ancalagon minor, a Middle Cambrian priapulid worm described in 1977 by Simon Conway Morris. As a result, he renamed \\"Ancalagon\\" saurognathus to Ankalagon saurognathus in 1980.

He was elected as a Member of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia to represent the riding of Richmond-Steveston in the 2005 provincial election. He was subsequently re-elected in the 2009 election and 2013 election. As a member of the BC Liberal Party, he has served as the Minister of Advanced Education, Innovation, and Technology and as Minister Responsible for Multiculturalism, as well as Minister of State for Climate Action. Yap is currently an opposition MLA. Personal life and family Of Hokkien descent, John Yap was born in Singapore to a homemaker mother and a medical doctor father. He speaks some Mandarin and Cantonese. The family immigrated to Canada, settling in Richmond, British Columbia in 1986. He attended the University of British Columbia, where he completed a Bachelor of Science and graduated with a Master of Business Administration. He went on to lead a twenty-year career in banking with Toronto-Dominion Bank and financial planning with the Investors Group. Yap is a member and past-president (1999‚Äì2000) of the Richmond Sunset Rotary Club and an honorary member of the Vancouver Diamond Lions Club. He was heavily involved with the Gilmore Park United Church and the Gilmore Gardens Seniors Centre. Yap is married with two grown children, a son and a daughter. For the past two decades, he and his family have resided in Richmond. In December 2014, he received heart bypass surgery at Vancouver General Hospital. Yap has visited his ancestral village in Yongchun, Fujian. Political career John previously served as British Columbia's Parliamentary Secretary for Clean Technology, Minister of State for Climate Action, Vice-Chair of the Cabinet Committee on Climate Change and Chair of the Government Caucus. He also previously served as member of the cabinet committees of Treasury Board and Legislative Review, as well as the Select Standing Legislative Committees of Public Accounts, Crown Corporations, Finance and Government Services and the Special Legislative Committee on Sustainable Aquaculture. In the Richmond-Steveston riding, Yap had worked on Geoff Plant's 1996 election campaign and volunteered as Plant's campaign chairman in the 2001 election. After Plant announced his retirement, Yap sought the BC Liberal nomination in Richmond-Steveston for the upcoming 2005 election. Plant vocally supported Yap's candidacy and Yap was acclaimed uncontested. In the 38th Provincial General Election, held on May 17, 2005, Yap was elected to the 38th Parliament of British Columbia. He defeated three other candidates in the Richmond-Steveston riding: Employment-agency owner and NDP candidate Kay Hale, Green Party candidate Egidio Spinelli, and Democratic Reform BC candidate Daniel Ferguson. As a Member of the Legislative Assembly in the 38th Parliament, Yap was a member of the Treasury Board and served on several committees: the Legislative Review Cabinet Committee, and the Special Committee on Sustainable Aquaculture, and the Select Standing Committees of Public Accounts, Crown Corporations, and Finance and Government Services. In September 2006 Yap was elected by his peers to be the Chair of the BC Government Caucus. In the 39th Provincial General Election, held on May 12, 2009, Yap was re-elected, defeating three other candidates: NDP candidate and retired medical transcriptionist Sue Wallis, Green Party candidate Jeff Hill, and Barry Chilton, former BC Conservative Party leader. Yap was retained as Minister of State for Climate Action during Gordon Campbell's final cabinet shuffle in October 2010. Yap supported the Province's move towards the Harmonized Sales Tax. Yap also supported the Premier's initiative in income tax reduction to the first $72,000 of income, effective January 1, 2011. In the 2011 BC Liberal Party leadership election Yap endorsed Kevin Falcon, though Christy Clark eventually won. He was appointed as the Parliamentary Secretary for Clean Technology to the Minister of Energy and Mines on March 14, 2011. On December 8, 2011, Premier Christy Clark formed The British Columbia Immigration Task Force and appointed Yap as chair. The purpose of the ITF was to \\"review key government programs to increase the number of skilled immigrants and investors in British Columbia.\\" The ITF report, delivered to Premier Christy Clark on March 31, 2012 was composed of the findings of eight British Columbia-wide regional consultations. Industry officials, stakeholders, and the general public were asked to provide their viewpoints, suggestions, and expertise in regards to the challenge of attracting skilled immigrants to BC. The ITF report listed 10 major recommendations, including:http://www.jtst.gov.bc.ca/immigration_task_force/docs/Immigration_Task_Force_WEB.PDF * Immediately increase immigration levels to B.C. * Grow and expand the BC Provincial Nominee Program (BC PNP) as the most effective way of supporting regional economic development. * Ensure economic immigration program application processes and requirements are as straightforward and efficient as possible and reflect business realities for employers. * Capitalize on B.C. as a destination of choice for entrepreneurs and investors. * Provide timely, effective information and support to newcomers and employers. Ultimately, the task force found that if BC fails to attract more skilled immigrants, businesses will be adversely affected through relocations or closures, in turn harming BC's economic outlook. As chairperson of the ITF, Yap provided a quote on his experiences and findings: \\"Travelling across the province, hearing stories from a range of employers about the challenges they are facing filling jobs in all types of industries impressed upon the task force the immediate and overwhelming need to bring more skilled immigrants to B.C. through a more efficient and responsive system.\\" John Yap was appointed Minister of Advanced Education, Innovation and Technology and Minister Responsible for Multiculturalism on September 5, 2012. In the 40th Provincial General election, held on May 14, 2013, Yap was re-elected, defeating several candidates: NDP candidate Scott Stewart, Conservative candidate Carol Day, Green Party candidate Jerome James Dickey, and UCBP candidate Mike Donovan. In July 2013, John Yap was appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Justice and Attorney General for Liquor Policy Reform. Yap was also appointed to the Cabinet Committee for a Strong Economy, as well as the committee for Legislative Review. Yap was also appointed the Chair of a new Special Committee to Appoint an Auditor General. = Ethnic Outreach Scandal and Resignation from Cabinet = Yap resigned from Cabinet on March 4, 2013, as a government investigation took place regarding an outreach scandal targeting ethnic communities. The scandal erupted over the leaking of a document, created using taxpayer resources, to attract ethnic voters to the BC Liberals in hopes of winning key ridings in the May 14, 2013 provincial election. Despite his association in the scandal, Yap announced that he would be running in the provincial election. Yap subsequently won re-election in his riding of Richmond-Steveston. Parliamentary Secretary for Clean Technology On March 14, 2011 Yap was appointed Parliamentary Secretary for Clean Technology to the Minister of Energy and Mines. During this time, Yap consulted with British Columbia's major fuel suppliers and reviewed low-carbon transportation fuel options to improve low carbon fuel requirements. In response to the concerns on the price and availability of high-quality renewable diesel for use in cold weather, Yap relaxed the renewable and low carbon fuel requirements legislation which saved 418,919 tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions from being released into the environment in 2010. In July 2011 Yap chaired the Bio- Economy Committee to identify ways to expand British Columbia's bio-economy through engagement with the industry and academia. As a part of that role, the provincial government provided $700,000 to FPInnovations to gauge the extent of British Columbia's bio-economy, and help industry identify cost-effective fiber available for new projects, including areas affected by the mountain pine beetle. :\\"This research funding is an example of the timely action our committee has recommended government take to develop a stronger and more robust bio-economy for British Columbians.\\". \\\\- John Yap, MLA for Richmond- Steveston Minister of State of Climate Action On June 10, 2009 British Columbia Premier Gordon Campbell promoted Yap to the Executive Council of British Columbia as the Minister of State for Climate Action. Yap was responsible for implementing British Columbia's Climate Action Plan and overseeing B.C.'s legislated carbon emissions reduction target of 33% by 2020. Regarding climate action initiatives, Yap worked to ensure the 2010 Winter Olympics and Paralympics were carbon neutral, and with various ministries he helped supervise the public sector's transition to carbon neutrality, increases in provincial fuel taxes (based on the fuel's carbon content), the creation of a Crown corporation to administer B.C.-specific carbon off-sets (the Pacific Carbon Trust), a memorandum of understanding with the California Air Resources Board regarding auto emission standards, expanded recycling initiatives, and a cap and trade system through the Western Climate Initiative. Yap also signed agreements with Washington Department of Ecology Director Ted Sturdevant on limiting carbon emissions from government operations and promoting awareness of the impacts of sea level rise on coastal areas. On February 7, 2011 Yap and Terasen Gas provided $6.9 million for 35 energy projects in ten school districts to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption and costs through British Columbia's Energy Conservation Agreement Fund. In addition, Yap supported the $15-million, three-year LiveSmart BC for small businesses across B.C. to access free energy-efficiency advice, equipment and incentives. \\"This program will allow thousands of B.C. small businesses to save money and reduce their energy consumption,\\" Yap said. \\"We know small businesses are the backbone of the economy and together we can work towards our climate action goals.\\" = Energy Conservation Agreement = Yap supported the first Public Sector Energy Conservation Agreement in 2009 (PSECA) as a partnership between BC Hydro and the Government of British Columbia. This agreement achieved annual energy cost savings of close to $7.4 million, GHG reductions of over 18,700 tonnes and conservation of 38.6 GWh of electricity. = Revenue Neutral Carbon Tax = On July 1, 2008 Yap implemented the British Columbia revenue carbon tax to fuels such as gasoline, diesel, natural gas, heating fuel, propane and coal, and to peat and tires when used to produce energy or heat. Carbon tax revenue is returned to taxpayers through tax reductions and is not used to fund government programs. The refundable Low Income Climate Action Tax Credit ensures that low-income individuals and families are compensated for the tax. This legislation was supplemented by a $100 Climate Action Dividend that was distributed to all British Columbians in 2008. The Youth Outreach Initiative Yap began a non-partisan program called the Youth Outreach Initiative Program (YOI) in 2008 to encourage youth involvement in the political process. The purpose of the YOI is to bridge the gap between the youth and the government. At Robert Cecil Palmer Secondary's Richmond School District's Student Leadership Conference (RSLC), Yap and his youth presenter educate and discuss issues such as lowering voting age to 16, mandatory voting laws, electronic voting options and increase classroom education.

The Council, established by Pope John Paul II on 28 June 1988, was dedicated to the spiritual welfare of migrant and itinerant people. The last President of the Council was Cardinal Antonio Maria Vegli√≤, who was appointed by Pope Benedict XVI on 28 February 2009. The last Secretary was Bishop Joseph Kalathiparambil, who was appointed by Pope Benedict XVI on February 22, 2011, and who had until then been serving as the Bishop of the Calicut, India. Effective 1 January 2017, the work of the Council was assumed by the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development. Role According to Article 149 of the Apostolic Constitution on the Roman Curia, Pastor Bonus, promulgated by Pope John Paul II on 28 June 1988: \\"The Pontifical Council for the Pastoral Care of Migrants and Itinerant People brings the pastoral concern of the Church to bear on the special needs of those who have been forced to leave their native land or who do not have one. It also sees to it that these matters are considered with the attention they deserve.\\" Articles 150 and 151 also number refugees, exiles, nomads, circus workers, sailors, airport or airplane workers, and Christians taking pilgrimages as being under the Council's care. History During the nineteenth century, the subject of populations subject to relocation was under the jurisdiction of the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith, with the Office for the Spiritual Care of Emigrants later replacing it. In 1952, within the Sacred Consistorial Congregation, Pope Pius XII founded the Superior Council for Emigrants and the General Secretariat for the Direction of the Apostolatus Maris; in 1958, the General Direction of the Apostleship of the Skies or the Air was also erected. Pope Paul VI founded the International Secretariat for the Direction of the Apostolatus Nomadum in the same dicastery in 1965. In 1967, Pope Paul instituted the Office for the Pastoral Care of people who are part of the complex phenomenon known commonly as \\"Tourism\\" in the Congregation for the Clergy. On March 19, 1970, Paul condensed all sectors dealing with human mobility into the Pontifical Commission for the Spiritual Care of Migrants and Itinerants, in the motu proprio Apostolicae Caritatis. The Commission was made dependent on the Congregation for Bishops but this dependence was eventually terminated by Pastor Bonus, which granted it the status of a Pontifical Council. Effective 1 January 2017, the Dicastery for Promoting Integral Human Development took responsibility for the work of the Council through its Migrants and Refugees Section.

Village of Stratton, 536 U.S. 150 (2002), is a United States Supreme Court case in which the Court held that a town ordinance's provisions making it a misdemeanor to engage in door- to-door advocacy without first registering with town officials and receiving a permit violates the First Amendment as it applies to religious proselytizing, anonymous political speech, and the distribution of handbills..  Background  The Village of Stratton, Ohio promulgated an ordinance that, among other things, prohibited \\"canvassers\\" from \\"going in and upon\\" private residential property to promote any \\"cause\\" without first obtaining a permit from the mayor's office by completing and signing a registration form. The ordinance imposed criminal sanctions on canvassing or soliciting without a license.Village of Stratton ordinance 1998-5. Jehovah's Witnesses, a religious group that publishes and distributes religious materials, sought injunctive relief, alleging that the ordinance violates its First Amendment rights to the free exercise of religion, free speech, and freedom of the press. The registration procedure, revised once to address objections from Jehovah's Witnesses, required the applicant to provide detailed information that is then posted in a public record: the applicant's name, home address, the organization or cause to be promoted, the name and address of the employer or affiliated organization (with credentials from the employer or organization showing the individual's exact relationship), the length of time that \\"the privilege to canvass or solicit is desired,\\" the addresses to be contacted, and \\"such other information concerning the Registrant and its business or purpose as may be reasonably necessary to accurately describe the nature of the privilege required.\\" Stratton's anti-solicitation ordinance required registration of those who seek the \\"privilege\\" of going door-to-door, and also required the would-be solicitor to carry a permit which must be shown to anybody (i.e. police officer, or Village resident) who requests it. Under the ordinance, residents of Stratton had the right to opt out of all or some solicitations through two means. First, they could post a \\"no solicitation\\" or \\"no trespassing\\" sign on their property. Residents could also fill out a \\"no solicitation\\" registration form at the office of the mayor. As part of the registration form, residents could indicate permission for solicitations from any or all of a series of listed groups: Scouting organizations, trick-or- treaters, food vendors, Christmas carolers, political candidates, campaigners, Jehovah's Witnesses, \\"Persons affiliated with __ Church,\\" and other groups. Jehovah's Witnesses pointed to the fact that they were the only religious organization singled out on this form, as well as to discriminatory statements made by Stratton's mayor, as indications of an anti-Jehovah's Witnesses bias underlying the law. The village of Stratton, on the other hand, claimed that the ordinance was motivated by a desire to protect Stratton's elderly citizens from potential frauds and scams. The District Court upheld most provisions of the ordinance as valid, content-neutral regulations, although it did require the Village to accept narrowing constructions of several provisions. The Sixth Circuit affirmed. Among its rulings, that court held that the ordinance was content neutral and of general applicability and therefore subject to intermediate scrutiny; rejected petitioners' argument that the ordinance is overbroad because it impairs the right to distribute pamphlets anonymously that was recognized in McIntyre v. Ohio Elections Comm'n, 514 U. S. 334; concluded that the Village's interests in protecting its residents from fraud and undue annoyance and its desire to prevent criminals from posing as canvassers in order to defraud its residents were sufficient bases on which to justify the regulation; and distinguished this Court's earlier cases protecting the ministry of Jehovah's Witnesses. = Amicus briefs = Amicus briefs filed with the Supreme Court in support of Jehovah's Witnesses in the Village of Stratton case: * Independent Baptist Church of America * Electronic Privacy Information Center (EPIC) * Center for Individual Freedom * The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints * RealCampaignReform.Org, Inc., et al.  Opinion of the Court  On June 17, 2002, the Court ruled in an 8‚Äì1 decision that the requirement of the Village of Stratton's ordinance for solicitors to \\"register\\" before engaging in door-to-door advocacy violated the First Amendment. The Court stated \\"it is offensive, not only to the values protected by the First Amendment, but to the very notion of a free society, that in the context of everyday public discourse a citizen must first inform the government of her desire to speak to her neighbors and then obtain a permit to do so.\\" The Supreme Court did not address the remaining provisions of the ordinance, which remain valid and legally enforceable.  Subsequent developments  While municipalities across the United States generally abandoned ordinances similar to that which had been overturned, others apparently directed or tolerated subsequent police interference with house-to- house religious canvassing. Such incidents are now handled collectively by the branch office of Jehovah's Witnesses of the land in which they occur, rather than on a case-by-case basis by local Witnesses themselves.\\"Question Box\\", Our Kingdom Ministry, October 2009, ¬©Christian Congregation of Jehovah's Witnesses, Inc., page 3, \\"What should you do if directed to stop preaching? In some instances, the police have approached publishers who were sharing in some form of the ministry, informed them that they were violating the law, and directed them to stop. You should promptly and politely leave the territory if directed to do so. ...If it is possible, tactfully obtain the badge number of the police officer and the number of his precinct. Thereafter, promptly inform the elders, who will then contact the branch office about the incident.\\" Citing repeatedly from the now-settled law of Stratton, the Watchtower Society in 2009 filed with the United States Court of Appeals for relief from Puerto Rico's new law restricting canvassing on public streets in public, gated neighborhoods.See Watchtower Society v. De Jesus et al The law was widely interpreted as intended to restrict Jehovah's Witnesses' house-to-house evangelism.\\"Walling off the Witnesses\\" by Joel P.

The main sources of slaves were wars and politically organized enslavement expeditions in North and East Africa, Eastern Europe, the Balkans, and the Caucasus. It has been reported that the selling price of slaves decreased after large military operations.Spyropoulos Yannis, Slaves and freedmen in 17th- and early 18th-century Ottoman Crete, Turcica, 46, 2015, p. 181, 182.

Eunuch harem guards and janissaries are some of the better known positions a slave could hold, but female slaves were actually often supervised by them.

Many slave officials themselves owned numerous slaves, although the Sultan himself owned by far the most. By raising and specially training slaves as officials in palace schools such as Enderun, where they were taught to serve the Sultan and other educational subjects, the Ottomans created administrators with intricate knowledge of government, and fanatic loyalty. The male establishment of this society created links of recorded information, even though speculation is present for European writings. However, women played and held the most important roles within the Harem institution. Meccan merchant (right) and his Circassian slave. Entitled, ‚ÄòVornehmner Kaufmann mit seinem cirkassischen Sklaven‚Äô [Distinguished merchant and his circassian slave] by Christiaan Snouck Hurgronje, ca. 1888.  Early Ottoman slavery  In the mid-14th century, Murad I built an army of slaves, referred to as the Kapƒ±kulu. The new force was based on the Sultan's right to a fifth of the war booty, which he interpreted to include captives taken in battle. The captives were trained in the sultan's personal service. The dev≈üirme system could be considered a form of slavery because the Sultans had absolute power over them. However, as the 'servant' or 'kul' of the sultan, they had high status within the Ottoman society because of their training and knowledge. They could become the highest officers of the state and the military elite, and most recruits were privileged and remunerated. Though ordered to cut all ties with their families, a few succeeded in dispensing patronage at home. Christian parents might thus implore, or even bribe, officials to take their sons. Indeed, Bosnian and Albanian Muslims successfully requested their inclusion in the system. Slaves were traded in special marketplaces called \\"Esir\\" or \\"Yesir\\" that were located in most towns and cities, central to the Ottoman Empire. It is said that Sultan Mehmed II \\"the Conqueror\\" established the first Ottoman slave market in Constantinople in the 1460s, probably where the former Byzantine slave market had stood. According to Nicolas de Nicolay, there were slaves of all ages and both sexes, most were displayed naked to be thoroughly checked ‚Äì especially children and young women ‚Äì by possible buyers.

Most of the military commanders of the Ottoman forces, imperial administrators, and de facto rulers of the Empire, such as Sokollu Mehmed Pasha, were recruited in this way. By 1609, the Sultan's Kapƒ±kulu forces increased to about 100,000. A Hutterite chronicle reports that in 1605, during the Long Turkish War, some 240 Hutterites were abducted from their homes in Upper Hungary by the Ottoman Turkish army and their Tatar allies, and sold into Ottoman slavery.John A. Hostetler: Hutterite Society, Baltimore 1974, page 63.Johannes Waldner: Das Klein-Geschichtsbuch der Hutterischen Br√ºder, Philadelphia, 1947, page 203. Many worked in the palace or for the Sultan personally. Domestic slavery was not as common as military slavery. On the basis of a list of estates belonging to members of the ruling class kept in Edirne between 1545 and 1659, the following data was collected: out of 93 estates, 41 had slaves. The total number of slaves in the estates was 140; 54 female and 86 male. 134 of them bore Muslim names, 5 were not defined, and 1 was a Christian woman. Some of these slaves appear to have been employed on farms. In conclusion, the ruling class, because of extensive use of warrior slaves and because of its own high purchasing capacity, was undoubtedly the single major group keeping the slave market alive in the Ottoman Empire. Rural slavery was largely a phenomenon endemic to the Caucasus region, which was carried to Anatolia and Rumelia after the Circassian migration in 1864. Conflicts frequently emerged within the immigrant community and the Ottoman Establishment intervened on the side of the slaves at selective times. The Crimean Khanate maintained a massive slave trade with the Ottoman Empire and the Middle East until the early eighteenth century. In a series of slave raids euphemistically known as the \\"harvesting of the steppe\\", Crimean Tatars enslaved East Slavic peasants. The Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth and Russia suffered a series of Tatar invasions, the goal of which was to loot, pillage, and capture slaves into \\"jasyr\\". The borderland area to the south-east was in a state of semi- permanent warfare until the 18th century. It is estimated that up to 75% of the Crimean population consisted of slaves or freed slaves. The 17th century Ottoman writer and traveller Evliya √áelebi estimated that there were about 400,000 slaves in the Crimea but only 187,000 free Muslims. Polish historian Bohdan Baranowski assumed that in the 17th century the Polish‚ÄìLithuanian Commonwealth (present-day Poland, Ukraine and Belarus) lost an average of 20,000 yearly and as many as one million in all years combined from 1500 to 1644.Brian L. Davies (2014). Warfare, State and Society on the Black Sea Steppe. pp. 15‚Äì26. Routledge. = Prices and taxes = A study of the slave market of Ottoman Crete produces details about the prices of slaves. Factors such as age, skin color, virginity etc. significantly influenced prices. The most expensive slaves were those between 10 and 35 years of age, with the highest prices for European virgin girls 13‚Äì25 years of age and teenaged boys. The cheaper slaves were those with disabilities and sub-Saharan Africans. Prices in Crete ranged between 65 and 150 \\"esedi guru≈ü\\" (see Kuru≈ü). But even the lowest prices were affordable to only high income persons. For example, in 1717 a 12-year-old boy with mental disabilities was sold for 27 guru≈ü, an amount that could buy in the same year of lamb meat, of bread or of milk. In 1671 a female slave was sold in Crete for 350 guru≈ü, while at the same time the value of a large two-floor house with a garden in Chania was 300 guru≈ü. There were various taxes to be paid on the importation and selling of slaves. One of them was the \\"pen√ßik\\" or \\"pen√ß-yek\\" tax, literally meaning \\"one fifth\\". This taxation was based on verses of the Quran, according to which one fifth of the spoils of war belonged to God, to the Prophet and his family, to orphans, to those in need and to travelers. The Ottomans probably started collecting pen√ßik at the time of Sultan Murad I (1362‚Äì1389). Pen√ßik was collected both in money and in kind, the latter including slaves as well. Tax was not collected in some cases of war captives. With war captives, slaves were given to soldiers and officers as a motive to participate in war. The recapture of runaway slaves was a job for private individuals called \\"yavacis\\". Whoever managed to find a runaway slave would collect a fee of \\"good news\\" from the yavaci and the latter took this fee plus other expenses from the slaves' owner. Slaves could also be rented, inherited, pawned, exchanged or given as gifts.For slaves offered as gifts to the sultan and other high-rank officials, see Reindl-Kiel, Hedda. Power and Submission: Gifting at Royal Circumcision Festivals in the Ottoman Empire (16th-18th Centuries). Turcica, Vol.41, 2009, p. 53.  Barbary slave raids  For centuries, large vessels on the Mediterranean relied on European galley slaves supplied by Ottoman and Barbary slave traders. Hundreds of thousands of Europeans were captured by Barbary pirates and sold as slaves in North Africa and the Ottoman Empire between the 16th and 19th centuries.When Europeans were slaves: Research suggests white slavery was much more common than previously believed These slave raids were conducted largely by Arabs and Berbers rather than Ottoman Turks. However, during the height of the Barbary slave trade in the 16th, 17th, 18th centuries, the Barbary states were subject to Ottoman jurisdiction and for exception of Morocco were ruled by Ottoman pashas. Furthermore, many slaves captured by the Barbary corsairs were sold eastward into Ottoman territories before, during, and after Barbary's period of Ottoman rule.Milton, G. (2005). White gold: the extraordinary story of Thomas Pellow and Islam's one million white slaves. Macmillan.Maddison, A. (2007). Contours of the world economy 1-2030 AD: Essays in macro-economic history. Oxford University Press. 1815 illustration of a British Captain horrified by seeing Christians worked as slaves in Algiers Notable occasions include the Turkish Abductions  Zanj slaves  As there were restrictions on the enslavement of Muslims and of \\"People of the Book\\" (Jews and Christians) living under Muslim rule, pagan areas in Africa became a popular source of slaves. Known as the Zanj (Bantu), these slaves originated mainly from the African Great Lakes region as well as from Central Africa. The Zanj were employed in households, on plantations and in the army as slave-soldiers. Some could ascend to become high-rank officials, but in general Zanj were inferior to European and Caucasian slaves.Michael N.M., Kappler M. & Gavriel E. (eds.), Ottoman Cyprus, Otto Harrassowitz GmbH & Co., Wiesbaden, 2009, p. 168, 169. One way for Zanj slaves to serve in high-ranking roles involved becoming one of the African eunuchs of the Ottoman palace. This position was used as a political tool by Sultan Murad III () as an attempt to destabilize the Grand Vizier by introducing another source of power to the capital. After being purchased by a member of the Ottoman court, Mullah Ali was introduced to the first chief Black eunuch, Mehmed Aga. Due to Mehmed Aga's influence, Mullah Ali was able to make connections with prominent colleges and tutors of the day, including Hoca Sadeddin Efendi (1536/37-1599), the tutor of Murad III. Through the network he had built with the help of his education and the black eunuchs, Mullah Ali secured several positions early on. He worked as a teacher in Istanbul, a deputy judge, and an inspector of royal endowments. In 1620, Mullah Ali was appointed as chief judge of the capital and in 1621 he became the kadiasker, or chief judge, of the European provinces and the first black man to sit on the imperial council. At this time, he had risen to such power that a French ambassador described him as the person who truly ran the empire. Although Mullah Ali was often challenged because of his blackness and his connection to the African eunuchs, he was able to defend himself through his powerful network of support and his own intellectual productions. As a prominent scholar, he wrote an influential book in which he used logic and the Quran to debunk stereotypes and prejudice against dark-skinned people and to delegitimize arguments for why Africans should be slaves. Today, thousands of Afro Turks, the descendants of the Zanj slaves in the Ottoman Empire, continue to live in modern Turkey. An Afro-Turk, Mustafa Olpak, founded the first officially recognised organisation of Afro-Turks, the Africans' Culture and Solidarity Society (Afrikalƒ±lar K√ºlt√ºr ve Dayanƒ±≈üma Derneƒüi) in Ayvalƒ±k. Olpak claims that about 2,000 Afro-Turks live in modern Turkey.  East african slaves  The Upper Nile Valley and Abyssinia were also significant sources of slaves in the Ottoman Empire. Although the Christian Abyssinians defeated the Ottoman invaders, they did not tackle enslavement of southern pagans as long as they were paid taxes by the slave traders. Pagans and muslims from southern Ethiopian areas such as kaffa and jimma were taken north to Ottoman Egypt and also to ports on the Red Sea for export to Arabia and the Persian Gulf. In 1838, it was estimated that 10,000 to 12,000 slaves were arriving in Egypt annually using this route. A significant number of these slaves were young women, and European travelers in the region recorded seeing large numbers of Ethiopian slaves in the Arab world at the time. The Swiss traveler Johann Louis Burckhardt estimated that 5,000 Ethiopian slaves passed through the port of Suakin alone every year, headed for Arabia, and added that most of them were young women who ended up being prostituted by their owners. The English traveler Charles M. Doughty later (in the 1880s) also recorded Ethiopian slaves in Arabia, and stated that they were brought to Arabia every year during the Hajj pilgrimage. In some cases, female Ethiopian slaves were preferred to male ones, with some Ethiopian slave cargoes recording female-to- male slave ratios of two to one.  Slaves in the Imperial Harem  An 18th- century painting of the harem of Sultan Ahmed III, by Jean Baptiste Vanmour Many different characteristics and opinions arise because of the interpretation of the Ottoman Empire, due to the secretive borders implemented by the Ottoman society. The concubines of the Ottoman Sultan consisted chiefly of purchased slaves. The Sultan's concubines were generally of Christian origin. Most of the elites of the Harem Ottoman Empire included many women, such as the sultan's mother, preferred concubines, royal concubines, children (princes / princess), and administrative personnel. The administrative personnel of the palace were made up of many high-ranking women officers, they were responsible for the training of Jariyes for domestic chores. The mother of a Sultan, though technically a slave, received the extremely powerful title of Valide Sultan which raised her to the status of a ruler of the Empire (see Sultanate of Women). The mother of the Sultan played an substantial role in decision making for the Imperial Harem. One notable example was K√∂sem Sultan, daughter of a Greek Christian priest, who dominated the Ottoman Empire during the early decades of the 17th century.See generally Jay Winik (2007), The Great Upheaval. Roxelana (also known as H√ºrrem Sultan), another notable example, was the favorite wife of Suleiman the Magnificent.Ay≈üe √ñzakba≈ü, H√ºrrem Sultan, Tarih Dergisi, Sayƒ± 36, 2000 Many historians who study the Ottoman Empire, rely on the factual evidence of observers of the 16th and 17th century Islam. The tremendous growth of the Harem institution reconstructed the careers and roles of women in the dynasty power structure. There were harem women who were the mothers , legal wives , consorts , favorites , Kalfas and concubines of the Ottoman Sultan. Only a handful of these harem women were freed from slavery and married their spouses. These women were : Hurrem Sultan , Nurbanu Sultan , Saifye Sultan (disputed) , Kosem Sultan , Gulnus Sultan , Perestu Sultan and Bezmiara Kadin. The Queen mothers who held the title Valide Sultan had only five of them that were freed slaves after they were concubines to the Sultan. Giulio Rosati, Inspection of New Arrivals, 1858‚Äì1917, Circassian beauties The concubines were guarded by enslaved eunuchs, themselves often from pagan Africa. The eunuchs were headed by the Kizlar Agha (\\"agha of the [slave] girls\\"). While Islamic law forbade the emasculation of a man, Ethiopian Christians had no such compunctions; thus, they enslaved and emasculated members of territories to the south and sold the resulting eunuchs to the Ottoman Porte.Gwyn Campbell, The Structure of Slavery in Indian Ocean Africa and Asia, 1 edition, (Routledge: 2003), p.ixSee Winik, supra. The Coptic Orthodox Church participated extensively in the slave trade of eunuchs. Coptic priests sliced the penis and testicles off boys around the age of eight in a castration operation. The eunuch boys were then sold in the Ottoman Empire. The majority of Ottoman eunuchs endured castration at the hands of the Copts at Abou Gerbe monastery on Mount Ghebel Eter. Slave boys were captured from the African Great Lakes region and other areas in Sudan like Darfur and Kordofan then sold to customers in Egypt. During the operation, the Coptic clergyman chained the boys to tables and after slicing their sexual organs off, stuck bamboo catheters into the genital area, then submerged them in sand up to their necks. The recovery rate was 10 percent. The resulting eunuchs fetched large profits in contrast to eunuchs from other areas.  Ottoman Sexual Slavery  A 19th-century photograph of a K√∂√ßek, a cross-dressing young slave boy sometimes used for homosexual purposes Circassians, Syrians, and Nubians were the three primary races of females who were sold as sex slaves (Cariye) in the Ottoman Empire. Circassian girls were described as fair and light-skinned and were frequently enslaved by Crimean Tatars then sold to Ottoman Empire to live and serve in a Harem. They were the most expensive, reaching up to 500 pounds sterling, and the most popular with the Turks. Second in popularity were Syrian girls, with their dark eyes, dark hair, and light brown skin, and came largely from coastal regions in Anatolia. Their price could reach up to 30 pounds sterling. They were described as having \\"good figures when young\\". Nubian girls were the cheapest and least popular, fetching up to 20 pounds sterling. Sex roles and symbolism in Ottoman society functioned as a normal action of power. The palace Harem excluded enslaved women from the rest of society. Throughout the 18th and 19th centuries, sexual slavery was not only central to Ottoman practice but a critical component of imperial governance and elite social reproduction. Boys could also become sexual slaves, though usually they worked in places like bathhouses (hammam) and coffeehouses. During this period, historians have documented men indulging in sexual behavior with other men; and getting caught. Moreover, the visual illustrations during this period of exposing a sodomite being stigmatized by a group of people with Turkish wind instruments shows the disconnect between sexuality and tradition. However those that were accepted became tellaks (masseurs), k√∂√ßeks (cross-dressing dancers) or sƒÅqƒ´s (wine pourers) for as long as they were young and beardless.Madeline C. Zilfi Women and slavery in the late Ottoman Empire Cambridge University Press, 2010 p74-75, 115, 186-188, 191-192 The \\"Beloveds\\" were often loved by former Beloveds that were educated and considered upper class. The era of reformation known as the Tanzimat saw traditional and religious laws being replaced in favour of secular Northern European ones. Homosexuality was decriminalized as of 1838.  Decline and suppression of Ottoman slavery  bombardment of Algiers by the Anglo-Dutch fleet in support of an ultimatum to release European slaves, August 1816 Responding to the influence and pressure of European countries in the 19th century, the Empire began taking steps to curtail the slave trade, which had been legally valid under Ottoman law since the beginning of the empire. One of the important campaigns against Ottoman slavery and slave trade was conducted in the Caucasus by the Russian authorities.L.Kurtynova-d'Herlugnan, The Tsar's Abolitionists, Leiden, Brill, 2010 A series of decrees were promulgated that initially limited the slavery of white persons, and subsequently that of all races and religions. In 1830, a firman of Sultan Mahmud II gave freedom to white slaves. This category included Circassians, who had the custom of selling their own children, enslaved Greeks who had revolted against the Empire in 1821, and some others. Attempting to suppress the practice, another firman abolishing the trade of Georgians and Circassians was issued in October, 1854.Badem, C. (2017). The Ottoman Crimean War (1853-1856). Brill. p353-356 Later, slave trafficking was prohibited in practice by enforcing specific conditions of slavery in sharia, Islamic law, even though sharia permitted slavery in principle. For example, under one provision, a person who was captured could not be kept a slave if they had already been Muslim prior to their capture. Moreover, they could not be captured legitimately without a formal declaration of war, and only the Sultan could make such a declaration. As late Ottoman Sultans wished to halt slavery, they did not authorize raids for the purpose of capturing slaves, and thereby made it effectively illegal to procure new slaves, although those already in slavery remained slaves.\\"Slavery in the Ottoman Empire\\".See also the seminal writing on the subject by Egyptian Ottoman Ahmad Shafiq Pasha, who wrote the highly influential book \\"L'Esclavage au Point de vue Musulman.\\" (\\"Slavery from a Muslim Perspective\\"). The Ottoman Empire and 16 other countries signed the 1890 Brussels Conference Act for the suppression of the slave trade. Clandestine slavery persisted into the early 20th century. A circular by the Ministry of Internal Affairs in October 1895 warned local authorities that some steamships stripped Zanj sailors of their \\"certificates of liberation\\" and threw them into slavery. Another circular of the same year reveals that some newly freed Zanj slaves were arrested based on unfounded accusations, imprisoned and forced back to their lords. An instruction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs to the Vali of Bassora of 1897 ordered that the children of liberated slaves be issued separate certificates of liberation to avoid both being enslaved themselves and separated from their parents. George Young, Second Secretary of the British Embassy in Constantinople, wrote in his Corpus of Ottoman Law, published in 1905, that at time of writing the slave trade in the Empire was practiced only as contraband. The trade continued until World War I. Henry Morgenthau, Sr., who served as the U.S. Ambassador in Constantinople from 1913 until 1916, reported in his Ambassador Morgenthau's Story that there were gangs that traded white slaves during those years.Morgenthau Henry (1918) Ambassador Morgenthau's Story, Garden City, N.Y, Doubleday, Page & Co., chapter 8. Available http://www.gwpda.org/wwi- www/morgenthau/MorgenTC.htm. He also wrote that Armenian girls were sold as slaves during the Armenian Genocide of 1915. The Young Turks adopted an anti- slavery stance in the early 20th century. Sultan Abdul Hamid II's personal slaves were freed in 1909 but members of his dynasty were allowed to keep their slaves. Mustafa Kemal Atat√ºrk ended legal slavery in the Turkish Republic, but in an ambivalent manner. Turkey waited until 1933 to ratify the 1926 League of Nations convention on the suppression of slavery. Illegal sales of girls were reported in the early 1930s. Legislation explicitly prohibiting slavery was adopted in 1964.\\"Islam and the Abolition of Slavery\\", C. Hurst & Co.

The screenplay by Robert Westerby was based upon the 1912 novel Greyfriars Bobby by Eleanor Atkinson which was based, in turn, upon an incident in 19th century Edinburgh involving a dog that came to be known as Greyfriars Bobby. It was the second film based upon Atkinson's novel, the first being Challenge to Lassie in which Crisp also starred. The film was directed by Don Chaffey and shot at Shepperton Studios and on location in Scotland. The film has been released to DVD and Disney+. Plot A little Skye Terrier named Bobby is the pet of a Scottish farmer and his wife but the dog loves an old shepherd hired on the farm called Auld Jock. When money grows scarce on the farm, Auld Jock is fired. He travels to Edinburgh, and Bobby follows him. Auld Jock dies in poverty in an inn and is buried in Greyfriar's Kirkyard. Bobby returns to Auld Jock's grave every night to sleep. Against the wishes of his wife, the graveyard caretaker James Brown tries to shoo Bobby away, but Bobby always finds his way back to the grave. Bobby endears himself to all, especially the neighborhood children. Brown and a restaurant owner, Mr. Traill, compete for the affections of the dog. Brown alleges Traill should pay Bobby's license fee, which he refuses on principle, not being Bobby's master. Mr. Traill is summoned to the court for a hearing, where he pleads not guilty. Mr. Brown is also present in the court, but he tells Mr. Traill he is sick, and can't get out of bed. Mr. Traill is told to come back the next day, with Bobby as well. Bobby's fate rests with the Lord Provost of Edinburgh and, without a license and someone to take responsibility for Bobby, he may be destroyed. The children of Edinburgh contribute their pennies for Bobby's license. Bobby is declared a Freeman of the City and adopted by the populace of Edinburgh.

Fifty Sm1 units were built between 1968 and 1973 at Valmet airplane factory in Tampere. They were put into use on the first electrified Finnish railway line between Helsinki and Kirkkonummi on January 26, 1969 with five units in operation. All Sm1's were thoroughly renovated between 1994 and 2000. Commercial service ended in April 2016.  Technical information  Each Sm1 unit consists of two cars: the Sm1 is the motored car of the multiple unit, while the other car, the driving trailer, is a part of the Eio class. There is a driver's cabin at either end of the unit, which enables the train to be driven in both directions without turning it around. This is a major advantage compared to locomotive-pulled trains in commuter traffic. The two-car unit has 191 seats combined, including fourteen foldable seats. Six Sm1 units can be coupled together in total, but in reality was rarely used in commuter traffic. The units use Scharfenberg couplers. The maximum speed of the Sm1 is . The electric systems were developed and built by Str√∂mberg at their plant in Pit√§j√§nm√§ki, Helsinki. The Sm1 is technically very similar to the newer Sm2 EMU, although there are also some differences, such as the Sm1 having steel spring suspension and strengthening creases on the sides.

The album, released on the Island Records label (catalogue ILPS 9323), is a brooding and intense collection of instrumental/vocal arrangements. Dedicated to Karlheinz Stockhausen, the music has stylistic similarities with Philip Glass and Tangerine Dream, but is more lyrical and has elements of musique concr√®te. It was later re-released on CD with a different track listing. Reception Reviewing the 1998 re-release of album for AllMusic, Ned Raggett said: > Aside from backing vocals and a string quartet, everything else is > Battiato's doing, with the Krautrock touches apparent in his previous work > starting to surface all the more readily here.

At the time, there was no theater company in the United States dedicated to classics of the American stage. Kliewer saw the need to change this, and created a company where theater-goers, actors, and directors could experience entertaining and provocative plays by American masters such as Washington Irving, Rachel Crothers, and Eugene O‚ÄôNeill. Many of the company's productions have not been produced for over fifty years, and in some cases, almost ninety. Still, the topics, characters, and situations, are relevant to today.  Overview  East Lynne Theater Company (ELTC) presents works by the current generation of playwrights, with world and New Jersey premieres based on American literature and history, many of which have gone on to other stages and/or become part of the company's touring show offerings. ELTC‚Äôs intern and artist-in-residence programs teach students acting, playwriting, and production. In 1996, Ohio State University asked to house the company‚Äôs archives at its \\"Jerome Lawrence and Robert E. Lee Theatre Research Institute.\\" Playbills, reviews, photographs and other memorabilia are sent to Ohio State every year. The company was founded in North Jersey, calling the William Carlos Williams Center in Rutherford its home, until the Mid-Atlantic Center for the Arts (MAC) asked ELTC to move its production season to Cape May, NJ. ELTC became known to MAC through its touring productions. In 1989, ELTC produced its first season in Cape May comprising four different shows, running for four weeks in the fall. In 1998, after the death of Founding Artist Director Warren Kliewer, the Board of Trustees asked Gayle Stahlhuth to lead the company. Her background is in acting, directing, playwriting, and producing. The company has grown to 71 performances of seven different productions a season, running from mid-June through mid-December and March in Cape May. The company is a member of the New Jersey Theater Alliance and the South Jersey Cultural Alliance, and has received grants from the New Jersey State Council on the Arts, the Cape May County Freeholders' Fund, New Jersey Council for the Humanities, and the New Jersey Historical Commission. The company employs members of Actors' Equity Association, mostly coming from New York City and North Jersey. During the Cape May performing season, the company is in residence at The First Presbyterian Church of Cape May. Touring and educational outreach is throughout the year, throughout the country.

Bullock, 489 U.S. 1 (1989),. was a case brought before the US Supreme Court in November 1988. The case (initiated by the publishers of Texas Monthly, a well-known general-interest magazine in Texas) was to test the legality of a Texas statute that exempted religious publications from paying state sales tax. The Court, in a 6-3 decision lacking a majority, overturned an appellate court's decision that the exemption was constitutional and remanded the case. History Prior to October 2, 1984, Texas exempted from sales tax \\"magazine subscriptions running half a year or longer and entered as second class mail.\\" The exemption applied to any subscription regardless of its content. Beginning on that date, it repealed the exemption (it would later reinstate it in its entirety from October 1, 1987). However, from 1984 to 1987, it maintained an exemption for \\"periodicals published or distributed by a religious faith consisting entirely of writings promulgating the teaching of the faith, along with books consisting solely of writings sacred to a religious faith.\\" The publishers of Texas Monthly, a popular and well-known general-interest magazine that did not qualify for the exemption, challenged the exemption by paying over $400,000 in sales taxes for 1985 under protest and filing suit in Travis County District Court to recover the taxes paid. It agreed by striking down the statute as a violation of both the Establishment Clause and the Free Press Clause and ordering the State of Texas to refund the taxes paid and interest. However, the Third Texas Court of Appeals reversed in a 2-1 decision. It determined that the tax exemption met the tests required under Lemon v. Kurtzman (1971),. and so did not violate the Establishment Clause. In addition, the Court of Appeals determined that the tax exemption did not violate the Free Press Clause, as only a few publications were qualified. Decision =Brennan's plurality opinion= Justice Brennan, Justice Marshall, and Justice Stevens based their plurality opinion in the Establishment Clause: \\"Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion.\\" As had been decided in earlier cases, Congress cannot establish a religion or even pass a law with the purpose of advancing religion in respect to non-religion. The lack of a sales tax on religious literature was in effect a subsidy to the religious writers. If the religious writers did not pay a tax, then a secular writer would have to. That would in essence force tax payers, religious or not, to pay for a subsidy to religions. They held that had the statute been broader, including charities, for example, it would have been constitutional. Justice Brennan recognized the argument of Texas that taxing the publications may inhibit their ability to function to some extent thereby going against the Free Exercise Clause which states continuing from the above clause \\"or prohibiting the free exercise thereof.\\" However, Justice Brennan argued that if all American people were required to pay the tax it did not unduly burden religion to pay the tax nor \\"prohibit\\" them from exercising as they wished. =White's concurring opinion= Justice White concurred in the judgment but argued that under the Court's prior precedent in Arkansas Writers' Project v. Ragland (1987),. the Texas Law violated the Press Clause by taxing Texas Monthly but exempting other publishers solely on the basis of the religious content of their publications. =Blackmun's concurring opinion= Justice Blackmun concurred in the judgment and wrote an opinion, joined by Justice O'Connor, disagreeing with both the plurality and the dissenting opinions. He argued that the opinion does not recognize enough the Free Exercise Clause, and the dissent does not recognize the Establishment Clause. He argued that to understand the case, both clauses must be seen along with the Press Clause, which states \\"Congress shall make no law... abridging the freedom of speech.\\" When religious writings are given certain perks like a pass on sales tax, the freedom of speech of the other writers is inhibited because they have to pay sales tax. Free speech is not inhibited enough to be an issue and so one must decide where the line is between the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause. He argued that had the law been written to include other philosophical literature encouraging morality, it may have stood, but when it expressly focused on religion the Establishment Clause had been violated: \\"In this case, by confining the tax exemption exclusively to the sale of religious publications, Texas engaged in preferential support for the communication of religious messages.\\" =Scalia's dissenting opinion= Justice Scalia wrote a dissenting opinion, joined by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Kennedy, refuting the arguments of Justices Brennan and Blackmun. He extensively cited Walz v. Tax Commission of the City of New York (1970),. where the Court found a New York law allowing religions and other non-profit organizations to not pay property tax. He argued that even though it included non-profit organizations, the Court had ruled specifically in favor of the exemptions for religions stating in Walz: \\"We find it unnecessary to justify the tax exemption of the social welfare services or 'good works' that some churches perform.\\" He stated that though a tax exemption is similar economically to a subsidy, when discussing the Establishment Clause, they are different as found in Walz. Also, a line must be drawn between the Establishment Clause and the Free Exercise Clause but sees more room between them. He argued that just because a law is not necessary for the Free Exercise Clause does not mean that it is unconstitutional on Establishment Clause grounds. He also notes that it passes all three prongs of the Lemon test by not overly entangling the church and state.

He presided over the infamous trial of Plug-Ugly Henry Gambrill for the murder of a Baltimore police officer. In 1860, the Maryland General Assembly removed Stump from office for \\"misbehavior,\\" the only jurist in Maryland history to be removed from the bench. Stump was also an eyewitness to the April 19, 1861 riots in Baltimore that marked the first bloodshed in the American Civil War. Stump was the brother of John Stump of Cecil County, Maryland, brother-in-law of Mary Alicia Stump and uncle of Henry Arthur Stump (1857‚Äì1934). The latter served as Judge to the Baltimore City Supreme Bench from 1910 to 1934. Henry Stump's Baltimore office was located at 57 West Fayette Street and his residence at Barnum's Hotel. According to the American Almanac, he earned a salary of $2,000 per year.The American Almanac and Repository of Useful Knowledge, For the Year 1857. Boston: Crosby, Nichols, and Company, 1856, p. 279. Stump died on October 29, 1865, at his brother's Cecil County home.  Baltimore in the 1850s  Between 1790 and 1860, Baltimore's population increased from 13,000 to 200,000,Brown, George William. Baltimore and the Nineteenth of April, 1861: A Study of the War. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001 (1887), p. vii. making it the third largest city in the United States. The Bank crisis in the 1830s, large numbers of European immigrants (a quarter of the population by 1860), a large free black population (25,000 in 1860), as well as slavery, created economic and political tensions. In addition, the \\"state's 1851 constitution altered traditional political alignments in Maryland, and on the national front, the struggle over the Compromise of 1850 gravely injured Maryland's political equilibrium. The subsequent dissolution of the Whig Party in the 1852 national elections left many Marylanders in the lurch. These voters turned to prohibition and nativism as answers to the problems facing their communities. By 1854, the Know-Nothing, or American, Party seized the reins of mayoral power in Baltimore, marking the rise of one of America's most unusual third parties.\\"Brown, George William. Baltimore and the Nineteenth of April, 1861: A Study of the War. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001 (1887), p. ix. In 1855, the American Party won power in the Baltimore City Council, the General Assembly and the Maryland delegation to Congress. The American Party, representing nativist, anti-immigrant views, was associated with gangs such as the Plug Uglies which \\"practiced intimidation, assault, arson, and assassination.\\"Melton, Tracy Matthew. Hanging Henry Gambrill: The Violent Career of Baltimore's Plug Uglies, 1854‚Äì1860. Baltimore: Maryland Historical Society, 2005, p. 50. Much of the gang activity in Baltimore was political in nature: intimidation at the polls, for example. Immigrant and Catholic social clubs were organized by the Democratic Party (which was pro-slavery and sympathetic to the South) which competed for power with the American Party. This conflict resulted in violence \\"in which scores of participants were killed and hundreds wounded. The large number of casualties made the American Party years some of the most violent in the city's history. The rates of criminal homicide would not be exceeded for another 100 years.\\" In the midst of the political turmoil and violence, Plug-Ugly member Henry Gambrill was arrested and convicted for the murder of Baltimore police officer Benjamin Benton.

Secession Exploded: \\"This strongly anti-Confederate satire is a fantastical vision of the Union defeat of the secessionist movement. A hideous monster representing secession emerges from the water at left. He is hit by a charge from a mammoth cannon 'Death to Traitors!' operated by Uncle Sam (right). A two-faced figure representing Baltimore, whose allegiance to the Union was at least questionable during the war, pulls at Uncle Sam's coattails. The explosion sends several small demons, representing the secessionist states, hurling through the air. Prominent among them is South Carolina, in a coffin at upper right. Tennessee and Kentucky, two Southern states internally divided over the secession question, are represented by two-headed creatures. Virginia, though part of the Confederacy, is also shown divided ‚Äì probably an acknowledgment of the Appalachian and eastern regions' alignment with the Union.

Removal from the Bench  Stump was elected in 1851 to serve a ten-year term to the 5th Judicial Circuit but was removed from office in 1860 for \\"misbehavior.\\" Stump's removal is the only case in Maryland history in which the complicated procedure (initiated in the Constitution of 1851) for electing judges to office and removal of them \\"by address to the General Assembly\\" has been carried out.The Archivists' Bulldog: Newsletter of the Maryland State Archives, Vol. 17, No. 19, p. 2‚Äì3. Watkins v. The State of Maryland: \\"Incurable Judicial Blunder\\" The misconduct case against Stump included charges that he repeatedly appeared in court drunk and as a result of his drunkenness was late to court, took frequent lengthy breaks and adjourned early, to the detriment of the business of the court. \\"Even if the police could be persuaded to arrest someone, the American judge of the criminal court, the notoriously corrupt and alcoholic Henry Stump, was likely to let them go.\\"Evitts, William J. A Matter of Allegiances: Maryland from 1850 to 1861. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1974, p. 113 Stump was also accused of passing erroneous judgments such as in the case of Thomas M. Watkins, a free Negro convicted of simple larceny in Stump's court. Watkins was tried and found guilty of stealing a silver watch valued at $6. Stump then sentenced Watkins as follows: > Judgment ‚Äì to be sold for the period of five years out of the limits of the > State, from March 31, 1859.Thomas M. Watkins, (Free Negro) vs. The State. > Court of Appeals of Maryland. 14 Md. 412; 1859 Md. Lexis 87. July 29, 1859, > Decided. Maryland State Archives. Special Collection 5339-41-8. The guidelines for sentencing free Negroes in cases of simply larceny of $5 and more, found in the Act of 1858, chapter 324, stipulated that \\"they should be sentenced and sold at public sale, as slaves, for the period of not less than two, nor more than five years.\\" Charles E. Phelps, counsel for Watkins, claimed that the \\"Court has no power to sentence the party to be sold 'out of the limits of the State.'\\"Thomas M. Watkins, (Free Negro) vs. The State. Court of Appeals of Maryland. 14 Md. 412; 1859 Md. Lexis 87. July 29, 1859, Decided. Maryland State Archives. Special Collection 5339-41-8, p. 1. Basically, Stump sentenced Watkins to be sold out of state and did not have the authority to do so. In the judgment above, Stump also neglected to specify a public sale (as opposed to private) according to law. Furthermore, Stump's critics accused him of amending the judgment before sending it to the Court of Appeals upon a writ of error from the Circuit Court of Baltimore. The judgment in the record transmitted to the Court of Appeals read as follows: > Therefore, it is considered by the Court here, that the said free Negro, > Thomas Watkins, be sold out of the State of Maryland, at public sale, as a > slave for the period of five years, under the provisions of the Act of > Assembly in such case made and provided.Thomas M.

The Court of Appeals reversed another judgment and sentence from Stump's court ‚Äì the trial of William G. Ford for the alleged murder of Thomas H. Burnham ‚Äì and ordered Stump to try him again. Stump forcefully challenged the Court of Appeals, claiming it did not have the authority to make such an order. Stump wrote: \\"If you, learned Judges, will refer me to the Acts of Assembly, I will obey your order to try Ford over again. You say there are such acts, of course you ought to show them, otherwise I am not bound to obey them.\\" More than a hint of Stump's sarcasm or perhaps disdain is evident when he writes: \\"Allow me to assure you (in order to tranquilize your nerves and satisfy your religious influences that Ford had as fair a trial as any man ever tried in this State or in the world.\\" Stump goes on to chide the Appeals Court: > Let me beg you judges to consult the Governor, perhaps he will pardon or > hang him without another trial, which I certainly never will give him, until > I see your authority by Act of Assembly.

Removal Proceedings A joint committee of the House of Delegates and the Senate heard a parade of witnesses testify both for and against Judge Stump on the question of whether or not he should be removed from office. Witnesses against complained that the judge was frequently drunk and would occasionally fall asleep on the Bench; that he was late for Court and adjourned early; displayed vulgar behavior; erroneously passed judgments; and irresponsibly delegated tasks to clerks. \\"He had refused to fine anyone more than once a year for violations of the Sunday liquor laws and had accepted straw bail from John Hinsley and other disreputable figures,\\" writes Melton.Melton, Tracy Matthew.

Notably, they found: * Stump \\"has acted, while in the discharge of his official duties, in a gross, vulgar and undignified manner, especially to the members of the bar and other parties in his Court.\\" * \\"That he has been in the habitual use of intoxicating drinks, to an extent which disqualifies him for the prompt and impartial administration of justice.\\" * \\"That he has pursued a course, violative of his official oath, in refusing to obey the orders of the Court of Appeals, and indicated, by sneering remarks on the bench, his disposition to treat the action of said Court with derision and contempt.\\" * \\"That he has, from time to time, delegated to the officers of his Court discretionary powers in discharging indictments, compromising fines, as has in fact rendered his Court utterly inefficient for the protection of public morals and public peace.\\" Minority Report The Minority Report of the joint committee, written by Coleman Yellott, objected not on grounds of Stump's merit, but that the committee had overstepped its authority by removing Stump without a conviction in a court of law. Although the state constitution authorized removal either: 1) by conviction in court of law, or 2) \\"by the Governor, upon the address of the General Assembly, provided that two-thirds of all the members of each House concur in said Address,\\" Yellott said that the committee had acted as if it were a court of law and Stump did not get a fair hearing. \\"It would be strange indeed, if a case like the present, involving as it does such important rights, should be the only exception to this universal rule [of a fair trial], and that the same constitution which guaranties to a party a trial, where he has involved property to the amount of 'five dollars,' should authorize a judgment against him without trial where the effect of the judgment would be to deprive him of a future salary amounting in the aggregate to nearly four thousand dollars!\\"Minority Report of the Select Committee Appointed on the Part of the Senate in Relation to the Petition for the Removal of Judge Stump.

The General Assembly acted upon the majority opinion and, upon approval by two- thirds of both houses, petitioned Governor Thomas Hicks for Stump's removal. The governor responded to the General Assembly ordering Stump's removal from office as follows: Proceedings of the House, 1860, Volume 660, p 897 Stump's Case Prompts Proposed Constitutional Amendment ‚Äì Reforms After 100 Years Four years after Stump's removal, at the state Constitutional Convention, an amendment to the state constitution was proposed to ensure a fair trial in such cases as Stump's. The amendment was rejected (see below):Proceedings and Debates of the 1864 Constitutional Convention. Volume 102, Volume 1, Debates 363 The question being then taken, the amendment was not agreed to. However, the question of fair treatment for judges charged with misconduct or incompetence was taken up again, nearly 100 years later. In 1966, the state of Maryland adopted a judicial conduct commission to provide for disciplining of judges via a permanent agency with authority to review complaints, conduct investigations and hearings, and make disciplinary recommendations to the Court of Appeals. Prior to establishment of the commission, Maryland judges were subject to the constitutional methods for removal (removal by the Governor; impeachment; or by two-thirds vote of the General Assembly) or to informal tactics such as peer pressure. The commission is intended to provide judges procedural protection as well as protection from impeachment methods that could be by their very nature political or partisan and \\"it permits judges to enforce unpopular laws or protect unpopular views without fear of reprisal from the legislative or executive branches.\\"Harrell Jr., Judge Glenn T. \\"The Maryland Commission on Judicial Disabilities: Whither Thou Goest?,\\" The Law Forum. University of Baltimore School of Law. Spring 1996. Issue 26.2, p. 10.  Eyewitness to the Baltimore Riot of 1861  On April 19, 1861, when the Massachusetts Sixth Regiment marched through Baltimore en route to Washington, \\"more than 5,000 Baltimoreans took part in the attacks on Federal troops, which resulted in the deaths of 21 soldiers and civilians and more than 100 injuries.\\"Brown, George William. Baltimore and the Nineteenth of April, 1861: A Study of the War. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 2001 (1887), p. xiii By the time of the riot, political power had shifted away from the pro-Union Know-Nothing Party and was back in the hands of Democrats. At least part of the uproar over Union troops passing through was aimed at their association with the hated Know-Nothings than with Southern sentiment. Frank Towers writes, \\"[t]he ascendancy of Southern sympathizers in late April owed more to their control of the means of violence ‚Äì as manifested in the actions of police, militia volunteers, and federal employees ‚Äì than in did to a non-existent majority sentiment for secession.\\" Elfenbein, Jessica, John R. Breihan, Thomas L. Hollowak. From Mobtown to Charm City: New Perspectives on Baltimore's Past. Baltimore: Maryland Historical Society, 2004, p. 115. Secession sentiment did exist in Baltimore (see image) although it was largely among wealthy merchants and slave owners worried about their economic well- being if Southern trade were cut off. They attempted to draw in working-class immigrants who had been victims of the Know-Nothing nativist sentiment.Elfenbein, Jessica, John R. Breihan, Thomas L. Hollowak. From Mobtown to Charm City: New Perspectives on Baltimore's Past. Baltimore: Maryland Historical Society, 2004, p. 117. To many in the border city of Baltimore, the issue was not simply North versus South. Rather the choice was secession (which few favored) or the \\"lesser evil [of] living under a federal administration they thoroughly disliked and one that might soon return their enemies to power.\\" (118) \\"Long the targets of nativist politicians, some Irish workers allied with these wealthy Southern sympathizers rather than cast their lot with former enemies that now dominated the Union movement.\\"Elfenbein, Jessica, John R. Breihan, Thomas L. Hollowak. From Mobtown to Charm City: New Perspectives on Baltimore's Past. Baltimore: Maryland Historical Society, 2004, p. 116. And as William Evitts writes, \\"Marylanders valued the union; more, they loved and needed it, and could not conceive of existence without it. Yet they clearly perceived the threat of federal dissolution. They therefore faced a double crisis: to preserve the union while preparing themselves to make a choice if they failed.\\"Evitts, William J. A Matter of Allegiances: Maryland from 1850 to 1861.

The college is in the Prestonville area of the city. It is situated at the corner of Dyke Road (A2010) and the Old Shoreham Road (A270), a major road junction in the north-west of the city of Brighton & Hove in Seven Dials. History left The college has its origins in the Brighton Proprietary Grammar and Commercial School, founded in July 1859 at Lancaster House, Grand Parade. The school continued as the Brighton, Hove and Sussex Grammar School. It opened on its present site in 1913. During the First World War, the building was requisitioned by the War Office to create the 2nd Eastern General Hospital, a facility for the Royal Army Medical Corps to treat military casualties. A large library was added to the building in 1935.\\"BHASVIC Sixth Form College: Origins of the school\\", retrieved 20 March 2008 The grammar school was abolished in 1975 and replaced by the current sixth form college. Funding and governance BHASVIC and other sixth form colleges in England were transferred under the Further and Higher Education Act 1992 out of local government control and established as independent FE Corporations. On 1 April 2010, under the Apprentices, Schools, Children and Learning Act 2009, the college was designated as a sixth form college. Over 90% of the college's funds come from the EFA (Education Funding Agency). Corporation Members (governors) are individuals from business, the local community, staff, students and parents. The principal of the college is an ex- officio member of the corporation. In April 2017, governors decided against seeking academy status. Teaching Playing fields There are approximately 2,800 students in college, most of whom take Advanced level courses. The remaining students are enrolled in variety of courses, predominantly Vocational Intermediate level or GCSE programmes. Approximately 60% of students are from Brighton and Hove, and up to 40 students come from outside the United Kingdom.\\"BHASVIC: An Introduction To The College\\", retrieved 18 March 2008 OFSTED published a report on its assessment of BHASVIC in November 2012, and BHASVIC was the first college in the country to be awarded a grade 1 Outstanding by OFSTED under the new inspection framework.

His detention in Havre, Montana, on April 1, 2003, apparently due to ethnic profiling, led eventually to an apology and compensation from the United States Department of Justice.\\"Justice for an Iraqi Refugee\\", Civil Liberties, published by the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington, volume 39, number 3, p. 3.Mike Lewis, Iraqi immigrant gets U.S. apology, cash, Seattle Post-Intelligencer, August 23, 2007. Accessed online October 30, 2007. Admission to the U.S. Habeeb was originally admitted to the United States as a refugee after being persecuted under the regime of Saddam Hussein. The Iraqi government executed Habeeb's brother Abdallah in 1982; they imprisoned Habeeb himself twice, most recently in 1997, tortured him, and left him with scars. Habeeb's father, a prominent business and community leader among Iraq's Rabia tribe, had been a supporter of the old Hashemite monarchy; he was killed in 1999. The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees granted Habeeb refugee status, and he was admitted to the U.S. in July 2002. He took up residence in Kent, Washington. Arrest and detention On April 1, 2003, Habeeb was traveling by rail from Seattle, Washington, to Washington, DC, intending to begin a new job with an Arabic-language newspaper. He and other passengers stepped off the train to take a break during a 30-minute stop at Havre, Montana. Two Border Patrol agents demanded to know where he was from. He answered their question accurately and produced a copy of a form showing his admission into the U.S. as a refugee. The agents asked whether he had been fingerprinted and photographed through NSEERS (\\"Special Registration\\"). He answered, accurately, that he had not: refugees are exempt from that program. They arrested him. Additional Border Patrol and FBI agents questioned Habeeb and detained him overnight. The next day, he was charged for his failure to appear for special registration; the charging document falsely stated he had been required to do so. He was held three nights in Hill County Jail. According to the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington (ACLU-W), \\"[d]uring that time, he was forced to strip naked in front of a government agent and was humiliated by other detainees who called him 'Saddam.'\\" He was then flown to Seattle, transported through the airport. In Seattle he spent four more nights in detention, under threat of deportation, \\"terrified,\\" according to ACLU-W, \\"that he would be sent back to Iraq.\\" After deportation proceedings were formally terminated May 16, 2003, Habeeb sought and received help from the ACLU. Through the ACLU Seattle attorney Jesse Wing and others represented Habeeb on a pro bono basis, bringing suit on his behalf against the government for wrongful arrest and detention. Habeeb's successful suit Habeeb's attorneys charged that the agents had stopped Habeeb for his ethnic appearance, and that his detention violated his Fourth Amendment right to be free from unreasonable search and seizure. However, Judge Sam Haddon of the U.S. District Court in Great Falls, Montana, ruled against Habeeb in June 2006, in a ruling that was seen as justifying ethnic profiling.Robert L. Jamieson, Jr., The sorry story of an Iraqi's U.S. ordeal, Seattle Post-Intelligencer, August 23, 2007. Accessed online October 30, 2007. On June 13, 2007, Jeffrey Sullivan (U.S. Attorney for the Western District of Washington) gave Habeeb a formal statement that \\"the United States of America acknowledges that, by not registering under NSEERS, you did nothing wrong. The United States of America regrets the mistake.\\" On July 16, 2007, Judge Haddon consequently vacated his original judgment, so it will not stand as a precedent.

The purpose of the incident report is to document the exact details of the occurrence while they are fresh in the minds of those who witnessed the event. This information may be useful in the future when dealing with liability issues stemming from the incident.Chapter 1 - Preventive Law in the Medical Environment - INCIDENT REPORTS Generally, according to health care guidelines, the report must be filled out as soon as possible following the incident (but after the situation has been stabilized). This way, the details written in the report are as accurate as possible.Log In Problems Most incident reports that are written involve accidents with patients, such as patient falls. But most facilities will also document an incident in which a staff member or visitor is injured.

Examples include Catholics who are accused of dissenting from any or all of the Church teachings on human sexuality and things related (the so-called \\"pelvic issues\\", i.e., what it has to say about abortion, birth control, divorce, premarital sex, masturbation, pornography, prostitution and the moral status of homosexual acts) or, alternately, those who demonstrate no concern for any moral issues except abortion and contraception. Use in print An early use in print of \\"cafeteria Catholic\\" appears in 1971: A later use of \\"cafeteria Catholicism\\" appears in Fidelity, 1986. A different distinction, in the term \\"communal Catholicism\\", had already been used in 1976.Chicago Catholics and the Struggles Within Their Church page 21, Andrew M. Greeley - 2010 \\"4 Cafeteria Catholicism - In 1976, I published a book called The Communal Catholic (Greeley, 1976) in which I suggested that there two kinds of Catholics had emerged in the years after the council‚Äî'Institutional Catholics,' who obeyed or tried to obey all the rules and laws promulgated by the Church, and 'Communal Catholics,' who continued to attach themselves in some fashion to the church, but now to the community of its members rather than to the rules laid down by those in Church authority.\\" Use of the term The term is most often used by conservative Catholics critical of progressive Catholics. It is less frequently applied to the conservatives who dissent from other Catholic moral teaching on issues such as access to healthcare, social justice, capital punishment, the care of the environment or just war, often pointing to abortion as their only real concern. The term has been in use since the issuance of Humanae Vitae, an official document that propounded the Church's opposition to the use of artificial birth control and advocates natural family planning. It is often a synonymous phrase for \\"Catholic-in- name-only\\" (or CINO), \\"dissident Catholic\\", \\"heretical Catholic\\", \\"cultural Catholic\\"/\\"cultural Christian\\", \\"√† la carte Catholic\\", or \\"liberal Catholic\\". The term has no status in official Catholic teachings. However, the practice of denying adherence to the sexual morality of the Church has been criticized by Pope John Paul II stated in his talk to the Bishops in Los Angeles in 1987: During morning Mass at the Domus Sanctae Marthae, Pope Francis, speaking rather of half-hearted Catholics, said, \\"They may call themselves Catholic, but they have one foot out the door.\\" Surveys on dissenting Catholic laity In 2014, the U.S. Spanish-language network Univision commissioned a World Values Survey of 12,038 self-identified Catholics in 12 countries with substantial Catholic populations across the world, representing 61% of the world‚Äôs Catholic population and covering nine languages spread across five continents. It found that majorities of Catholics globally and in most regions disagree with Church teachings on divorce, abortion, and contraception, with greater intra- and inter-national division on gay marriage and the ordination of women and divorced men. Favourable views about the Pope (Francis) did not influence Catholics who disagree with at least some of the church's teachings. Overall, a higher proportion of Third World Roman Catholics (notably Africa and the Philippines) accept the official doctrines on these subjects, while those in Western countries tend to disagree with many of them. In the United States and Spain, the majority of Catholics support gay marriage, followed by France at 43% support. The founder of World Values Survey, Ronald Inglehart said: Francis has requested that parishes provide answers to an official questionnaire regarding the current opinions among the laity. He has also continued to assert present Catholic doctrine in less dramatic tone than his more direct predecessors who maintained that the Catholic Church is not a democracy of popular opinion. Francis launched his own survey of Catholic opinion in November 2013. Religion sociologist Linda Woodhead of Lancaster University writes, \\"it‚Äôs not a survey in any sense that a social scientist would recognize.\\" Woodhead feels many ordinary Catholics will have difficulty understanding theological jargon there. Still Woodhead suspects the survey may be influential.  Self-described cafeteria Catholics  Some notable Catholics have either been explicitly associated or identified with the term. Politician James Carville, a Democrat, has been described as \\"the ultimate cafeteria Catholic\\". Carville said, \\"Everybody in some way or another takes what they want. The real thing is how we treat each other.\\" Author Mary Karr, a convert from agnosticism, was also reported to have been a dissenter of some Catholic teaching. Having been a feminist since she was 12, Karr is pro-choice on abortion and she supports the ordination of women to the priesthood.Edelstein, Wendy (2006-02-15). \\"An Improbable Catholic\\". UC Berkeley News. Retrieved 2010-2-08.

Different cultures use different social lubricants for this purpose. Some common social lubricants are: * Humor is the most prevalent social lubricant spanning all cultures and age groups. * Alcoholic beverages (beer in pub culture, or wine in wine bars, for example) * Coffee (in coffee cultures, for example) * Tea (at tea parties, for example) * Tobacco (in cigarettes or a hookah, for example) The earliest known usage of the term can be found in Steve Allen's book, \\"How to be Funny\\". In the introduction he writes, \\"Humor is a social lubricant that helps us get over some of the bad spots.\\" The term social lubricant appears on page 110 of the book titled \\"Alcoholics Anonymous\\" in the chapter \\"To Wives.\\" \\"We know all about liquor as a social lubricant.\\" The first edition of the \\"Big Book\\" was published in 1939.

In many cases, they are made with zippers that have one or more unusual features in order to make them unlike regular clothes, and therefore harder to remove. Often, they are designed to appear in front with classic designs, such as faux buttons and plackets, collars, or T-shirt-like prints, while the backs have closures that must be open to remove the garment. Some alternative closures on these jumpsuits include zippers that zip from top to bottom (they are separating zippers similar to those found on coats) and tuck into a small pocket found below waist level. Other zippers may be off-center in order to be in a location in which the patient is not used to finding it. Mousetraps Sometimes, as an alternative to special clothes, which can be costly, devices at a lower price can be attached to regular clothes in order to prevent a person from removing the clothes. Though many names are used for these objects, they are sometimes referred to as \\"mousetraps.\\" Many versions exist, some of which are also designed to have fashionability. While in most cases, these devices are manufactured for use with persons with special medical needs, they are occasionally used by fetishists. =Types of devices= Button cover A button cover is an object larger than the button that it covers, and closes over the button, thereby making the button too large to pass through its hole. These, however, have the weakness in which the button can be removed from the garment with enough force, thereby making it less effective, and damaging the garment when it is breached. Some button covers, especially those that attach to neck-level buttons, are sometimes designed to look somewhat fashionable. Buttonhole blocks A buttonhole blocker holds the fabric at the two sides of the buttonhole together, thereby making the buttonhole too small for the button to pass through. While more secure than a button cover, it is much harder to apply, and does not have such a fashionable appearance. Zipper blocker A zipper blocker prevents the zipper from sliding down its shaft. One version is a locking safety pin in which a piece of the metal bar simply rests across the shaft, thereby blocking movement of the zipper's channel in that direction. Other versions, which are sewn onto the garment, involve two pieces of metal that hook together, and likewise block the zipper's movement. Other versions have been created that hold the pull tab on the zipper in place. In many care facilities, common safety pins are used rather than special purchases of these devices being made. Thigh rings A less common device is a pair of thigh rings, which secure around the legs below the genital area. This allows the pants to be pulled down far enough for toileting, but prevents them from being removed, and does not reduce comfort. Waistbelt Special waistbelts have been developed that hold the shirt and pants together. This prevents the patient from pulling up his or her shirt or pulling down his or her pants.

Biography McClure was born in Chicago, Illinois, then by the age of two, raised in St. Louis, and sang in church and gospel groups in his youth. He sang with The Soul Stirrers (then led by Sam Cooke) in the 1950s, and moved into secular music soon after, singing with Bobby & the Vocals, Big Daddy Jenkins, and Oliver Sain. McClure, who recorded for Checker, a subsidiary of Chess Records, scored two hit singles in the U.S. in 1965, and thereafter helped launch the careers of Little Milton and Fontella Bass; during this time he also played with Otis Clay and Shirley Brown. \\"Peak of Love\\" was a soul hit, that barely scraped the pop charts in late 1966. McClure moved on from music in the 1970s, working in an Illinois jail as a corrections officer, though he recorded some singles in the 1980s. McClure suffered a brain aneurysm in 1992, and died in Los Angeles, California, of complications from a stroke soon after. Later compilation album releases included Younger Man Blues (Shanachie, 1994) and an earlier joint album with Willie Clayton, Bobby McClure & Willie Clayton (Hi Records, 1992).

Born in 1519 in Florence to an Italian father and a French mother, Catherine de' Medici was a daughter of both the Italian and the French Renaissance. She grew up in Florence and Rome under the wing of the Medici popes, Leo X and Clement VII. In 1533, at the age of fourteen, she left Italy and married Henry, the second son of Francis I and Queen Claude of France. On doing so, she entered the greatest Renaissance court in northern Europe.Knecht, 220. King Francis set his daughter-in-law an example of kingship and artistic patronage that she never forgot.Frieda, 79. She witnessed his huge architectural schemes at Chambord and Fontainebleau. She saw Italian and French craftsmen at work together, forging the style that became known as the first School of Fontainebleau. Francis died in 1547, and Catherine became queen consort of France. But it wasn't until her husband King Henry's death in 1559, when she found herself at forty the effective ruler of France, that Catherine came into her own as a patron of architecture. Over the next three decades, she launched a series of costly building projects aimed at enhancing the grandeur of the monarchy. During the same period, however, religious civil war gripped the country and brought the prestige of the monarchy to a dangerously low ebb.\\"The Day of the Barricades\\" (12 May 1589), in which a mob took over the streets of Paris, \\"reduced the authority and prestige of the monarchy to its lowest ebb for a century and a half\\". Morris, 260. Catherine loved to supervise each project personally.The architect Philibert de l'Orme wrote: \\"your good judgement (bon esprit) shows itself more and more and shines as you yourself take the trouble to project and sketch out (protraire et esquicher) the buildings which it pleases you to commission\\". Knecht, 228. The architects of the day dedicated books to her, knowing that she would read them.Knecht, 228. The poet Ronsard accused her of preferring masons to poets. Though she spent colossal sums on the building and embellishment of monuments and palaces, little remains of Catherine's investment today: one Doric column, a few fragments in the corner of the Tuileries gardens, an empty tomb at Saint Denis. The sculptures she commissioned for the Valois chapel are lost, or scattered, often damaged or incomplete, in museums and churches. Catherine de' Medici's reputation as a sponsor of buildings rests instead on the designs and treatises of her architects. These testify to the vitality of French architecture under her patronage. Influences Historians often assume that Catherine's love for the arts stemmed from her Medici heritage. \\"As the daughter of the Medici,\\" suggests French art historian Jean-Pierre Babelon, \\"she was driven by a passion to build and a desire to leave great achievements behind her when she died.\\"Babelon, The Louvre, 263. Born in Florence in 1519, Catherine lived at the Medici palace, built by Cosimo de' Medici to designs by Michelozzo di Bartolomeo.Frieda, 24. After moving to Rome in 1530, she lived, surrounded by classical and Renaissance treasures, at another Medici palace (now called the Palazzo Madama). There she watched the leading artists and architects of the day at work in the city.Frieda, 30‚Äì31. When she later commissioned buildings herself, in France, Catherine often turned to Italian models. She based the Tuileries on the Pitti palace in Florence;Hautec≈ìur, 523. and she originally planned the Hotel de la Reine with the Uffizi palace in mind.Thomson, 176. Ch√¢teau of Chambord, built by King Francis I Catherine, however, left Italy in 1533 at the age of fourteen and married Henry of Orl√©ans, the second son of King Francis I of France. Though she kept in touch with her native Florence, her taste matured at the itinerant royal court of France. Her father-in-law impressed Catherine deeply as an example of what a monarch should be.Knecht 176; Frieda, 199. She later copied Francis' policy of setting the grandeur of the dynasty in stone, whatever the cost. His lavish building projects inspired her own.Frieda, 79, 455; Sutherland, 6. Francis was a compulsive builder. He began extension works at the Louvre,Blunt, Art and Architecture in France, 80. These extensions, supervised by Pierre Lescot and featuring relief sculptures by Jean Goujon, were continued by the last four Valois kings. added a wing to the old castle at Blois, and built the vast ch√¢teau of Chambord, which he showed off to the emperor Charles V in 1539. He also transformed the lodge at Fontainebleau into one of the great palaces of Europe, a project that continued under Henry II. Artists such as Rosso Fiorentino and Francesco Primaticcio worked on the interior, alongside French craftsmen.Norwich, 158. This meeting of Italian Mannerism and French patronage bred an original style, later known as the first School of Fontainebleau.Thornton, 51. Featuring frescoes and high-relief stucco in the shape of parchment or curled leather strapwork, it became the dominant decorative fashion in France in the second half of the sixteenth century.Norwich, 157. Catherine later herself employed Primaticcio to design her Valois chapel. She also patronised French talent, such as the architects Philibert de l'Orme and Jean Bullant, and the sculptor Germain Pilon. Initials of Henry II and Catherine on a chimney at ChenonceauHoogvliet, 111. Some scholars believe that the intertwined letter Cs may also refer to crescent moons, the emblem of Henry's lover Diane de Poitiers (the crescent moon was the symbol of the goddess Diana). However, Catherine continued to use this monogram after Henry's death. The death of Henry II from jousting wounds in 1559 changed Catherine's life. From that day, she wore black and took as her emblem a broken lance.Knecht, 58. She turned her widowhood into a political force that validated her authority during the reigns of her three weak sons.\\"Catherine's lifelong mourning was not only a manner to express grief: it was also the legitimisation of her political role.\\" Hoogvliet, 106. She also became intent on immortalizing her sorrow at the death of her husband.Knecht, 223. She had emblems of her love and grief carved into the stonework of her buildings. She commissioned a magnificent tomb for Henry, as the centrepiece of an ambitious new chapel. In 1562, a long poem by Nicolas Hou√´l likened Catherine to Artemisia, who had built the Mausoleum at Halicarnassus, one of the Seven Wonders of the Ancient World, as a tomb for her dead husband.Frieda, 266; Hoogvliet, 108. Louis Le Roy, in his Ad illustrissimam reginam D. Catherinam Medicem of 1560, was the first to call Catherine the \\"new Artemisia\\". Artemesia had also acted as regent for her children. Hou√´l laid stress on Artemesia's devotion to architecture. In his dedication to L'Histoire de la Royne Arth√©mise, he told Catherine: > You will find here the edifices, columns, and pyramids that she had built > both at Rhodes and Halicarnassus, which will serve as remembrances for those > who reflect on our times and who will be astounded at your own buildings‚Äìthe > palaces at the Tuileries, Montceaux, and Saint-Maur, and the infinity of > others that you have constructed, built, and embellished with sculptures and > beautiful paintings.Quoted by Knecht, 224. Catherine commissioned the > artists Niccol√≤ dell'Abbate and Antoine Caron to illustrate the poem. The > drawings were subsequently turned into tapestries, none of which survive; > but, according to Knecht, fifty-nine of the drawings survive. Hoogvliet, > 108, on the other hand, says that sixty-eight of the drawings survive. > ‚Ä¢ Frieda, 266. The story of Artemisia formed an iconography for Catherine > and reinforced her right to serve as regent. The later female regents Marie > de' Medici (1610‚Äì20) and Anne of Austria (1643‚Äì60) revived this iconography > in their own service. Valois Chapel Plan of the Valois Mortuary Chapel In memory of Henry II, Catherine decided to add a new chapel to the basilica of Saint Denis, where the kings of France were traditionally buried. As the centrepiece of this circular chapel, sometimes known as the Valois rotunda, she commissioned a magnificent and innovative tomb for Henry and herself. The design of this tomb should be understood in the context of its planned setting.Zerner, 383. The plan was to integrate the tomb's effigies of the king and queen with other statues throughout the chapel, creating a vast spatial composition. Catherine's approval would have been essential for such a departure from funerary tradition.Zerner, 382. =Architecture= To lead the Valois chapel project, Catherine chose Francesco Primaticcio, who had worked for Henry at Fontainebleau. Primaticcio designed the chapel as a round building, crowned by a dome, to be joined to the north transept of the basilica. The interior and exterior of the chapel were to be decorated with pilasters, columns, and epitaphs in coloured marble. The building would contain six other chapels circling the tomb of Henry and Catherine.Hoogvliet, 109. Primaticcio's circular design solved the problems faced by the Giusti brothers and Philibert de l'Orme, who had built previous royal tombs. Whereas de l'Orme had designed the tomb of Francis I to be viewed only from the front or the side, Primaticcio's design allowed the tomb to be viewed from all angles.Blunt, Art and Architecture in France, 56. Art historian Henri Zerner has called the plan \\"a grand ritualistic drama which would have filled the rotunda's celestial space\\".L'art de la Renaissance en France. L'invention du classicisme (Zerner, 1996: 349‚Äì54), quoted by Knecht, 227. Germain Pilon's Resurrection (1580s), commissioned by Catherine de' Medici for the Valois Chapel complex Work on the chapel began in 1563 and continued over the next two decades. Primaticcio died in 1570, and the architect Jean Bullant took over the project two years later. After Bullant's death in 1578, Baptiste du Cerceau led the work.Knecht, 226. The building was abandoned in 1585. Over two hundred years later, in 1793, a mob tossed Catherine and Henry's bones into a pit with the rest of the French kings and queens.Knecht, 269. =Tomb= Drawing of how the tomb of Henry II and his wife originally looked; it shows the Effigies at top and the double tomb below Tomb of Henry II and Catherine de' Medici, Saint-Denis Basilica, with marble effigies on top Close up of the Effigies on the tomb of Henry II and Catherine de' Medici at the basilica of Saint Denis, carved by Germain PilonKnecht, 227. Henry's gesture is now unclear, since a missal, resting on a prie-dieu (prayer desk), was removed from the sculpture during the French revolution and melted down. Several of the monuments built for the Valois chapel have survived. These include the tomb of Catherine and Henry‚Äîin Zerner's view, \\"the last and most brilliant of the royal tombs of the Renaissance\\".Zerner, 379. Primaticcio himself designed its structure, which eliminated the traditional bas-reliefs and kept ornamentation to a minimum. The sculptor Germain Pilon, who had provided statues for the tomb of Francis I, carved the tomb's two sets of effigies, which represented death below and eternal life above.\\"With the rise of naturalistic representations beginning in the fifteenth century, the afterlife was imagined as an exact replica of earthly existence. As a result, the tombs of the mighty often insinuated an ambiguous conflation of the glorious Life Eternal with a glorification of their earthly lives.\\" Zerner, 380. The king and queen, cast in bronze, kneel in prayer (priants) on a marble canopy supported by twelve marble columns. Their poses echo those on the nearby tombs of Louis XII and Francis I. Pilon's feel for the material, however, invests his statues with a greater sense of movement.Blunt, Art and Architecture in France, 94. Blunt believes that Benvenuto Cellini's Fontainebleau nymph may have influenced their carving. Before they were destroyed in the Revolution, the remains of the king and queen lay in the mortuary chamber below.Zerner 383‚Äì84. Girolamo della Robbia was originally commissioned to carve the queen's corpse, but his effort, in which Catherine looks emaciated, was left unfinished in 1566 and is now in the Louvre. Catherine's effigy suggests sleep rather than death, while Henry is posed strikingly, with his head thrown back.Zerner, 379; Blunt, Art and Architecture in France, 95. From 1583, Pilon also sculpted two later gisants of Catherine and Henry wearing their crowns and coronation robes.Zerner suggests that these two, apparently superfluous, recumbent effigies, as rigid as those from the thirteenth century, might have been a \\"call to order\\". In the context of the wars of religion, they may have represented a pulling back from the sensuality of the tomb, which \\"was bound to appear somewhat pagan\\". Zerner, 382‚Äì83. In this case, he portrays Catherine realistically, with a double chin. These two statues were intended to flank the altar of the chapel.Knecht, 226‚Äì27. Pilon's four bronze statues of the cardinal virtues stand at the corners of the tomb. Pilon also carved the reliefs round the base that recall Bontemps' work on the monument for the heart of Francis I.Blunt, Art and Architecture in France, 94. =Statuary= In the 1580s, Pilon began work on statues for the chapels that were to circle the tomb. Among these, the fragmentary Resurrection, now in the Louvre, was designed to face the tomb of Catherine and Henry from a side chapel.Zerner, 383. Whereas the \\"Resurrection\\" for the tomb of Francis I was positioned close to the corpses, this design would have involved the visitor. This work owes a clear debt to Michelangelo, who had designed the tomb and funerary statues for Catherine's father at the Medici chapels in Florence.Blunt, Art and Architecture in France, 95. Pilon based the Christ on Michelangelo's cartoon for Noli me tangere (1531) and carved the soldiers in Michelangelo's contrapposto style. Pilon's statue of St Francis in Ecstasy now stands in the church of St Jean and St Fran√ßois. In art historian Anthony Blunt's view, it marks a departure from the tension of Mannerism and \\"almost foreshadows\\" the Baroque.Blunt, Art and Architecture in France, 95. Pilon had by this time developed a freer style of sculpture than previously seen in France. Earlier French sculpture seems to have influenced him less than Primaticcio's decorations at Fontainebleau: the work of his predecessor Jean Goujon, for example, is more linear and classical.Blunt, Art and Architecture in France, 94, 97. Pilon openly depicts extreme emotion in his work, sometimes to the point of the grotesque. His style has been interpreted as a reflection of a society torn by the conflict of the French wars of religion.Blunt, Art and Architecture in France, 96‚Äì97. Montceaux Catherine's earliest building project was the ch√¢teau of Montceaux-en-Brie, near Paris, which Henry II gave her in 1556, three years before his death. The building consisted of a central pavilion housing a straight staircase, and two wings with a pavilion at each end. Catherine wanted to cover the alley in the garden where Henry played pall mall, an early form of croquet. For this commission, Philibert de l'Orme built her a grotto. He set it on a base made to look like natural rock, from which guests could watch the games while taking refreshments. The work was completed in 1558 but has not survived.Knecht, 228‚Äì229. The ch√¢teau ceased to be used as a royal residence after 1640, and had fallen into ruin by the time it was demolished by revolutionary decree in 1798.Coope, \\"The Chateau of Montceaux-en-Brie\\", 71‚Äì87. Tuileries 1705 map of Paris, showing the Tuileries and the Louvre in about 1589 After the death of Henry II, Catherine abandoned the palace of the Tournelles, where Henry had lain after a lance fatally pierced his eye and brain in a joust.Blunt, Art and Architecture in France, 104. Catherine planned a grid of streets to replace the palace, with houses designed by de l'Orme, but the work was never carried out. Henry IV, who ruled France from 1589 to 1610, later constructed a square on the site called the Place Royale, now known as the Place des Vosges. To replace the Tournelles, she decided in 1563 to build herself a new Paris residence on the site of some old tile kilns or tuileries. The site was close to the congested Louvre, where she kept her household. The grounds extended along the banks of the Seine and afforded a view of the countryside to the south and west.Frieda, 335. The Tuileries was the first palace that Catherine had planned from the ground up. It was to grow into the largest royal building project of the last quarter of the sixteenth century in western Europe. Her massive building schemes would have transformed western Paris, as seen from the river, into a monumental complex.Thomson, 165. ‚Ä¢ This engraving by Matth√§us Merian shows the complex in 1615, after Henry IV's additions. Detail of the court side of the Tuileries, designed by Philibert de l'Orme, drawn by Jacques Androuet du Cerceau To design the new palace, Catherine brought back Philibert de l'Orme from disgrace. This arrogant genius had been sacked as superintendent of royal buildings at the end of Henry II's reign, after making too many enemies.Knecht, 229. Historian R. J. Knecht suggests, (after Blunt, Philibert de l'Orme, London, 1958), that Catherine may have been moved to rehabilitate de l'Orme after reading his Instruction, in which he defended himself against all charges and pleaded for fair treatment. ‚Ä¢ Randall, 82‚Äì84. The reasons for de l'Orme's disgrace are not clear, but it seems that he was prone to arrogance and had made enemies. ‚Ä¢ Zerner, 402. Zerner, who calls him \\"haughty\\", mentions allegations of embezzlement and an incident in which de l'Orme and his brother killed two men in a brawl. De l'Orme mentioned the project in his treatises on architecture, but his ideas are not fully known. It appears from the small amount of work carried out that his plans for the Tuileries departed from his known principles. De l'Orme is said to have \\"taught France the classical style‚Äîlucid, rational and regular\\".Sharp, 44. He notes, however, that in this case he added rich materials and ornaments to please the queen.De l'Orme recorded that Catherine told him \\"to make several encrustations of different kinds of marble, gilded bronze and of minerals, like marcassites\\" on both the inside and the outside of the building. Knecht, 228. The plans therefore include a decorative element that looks forward to Bullant's later work and to a less classical style of architecture.Blunt, Art and Architecture in France, 55. For the pilasters of Catherine's palace, de l'Orme chose the Ionic order, which he considered a feminine form: > I will not go on to other matters without pointing out to you that I chose > the present Ionic order, from amongst all others, in order to ornament and > to give lustre to the palace, which Her Majesty the Queen, mother of the > most Christian King Charles IX, today is having built at Paris ... The other > reason why I wanted to use and to show the Ionic order properly, on the > palace of Her Majesty the Queen, is because it is feminine and was devised > according to the proportions and beauties of women and goddesses, as was the > Doric to those of men, which is what the ancients have told me: for, when > they decided to build a temple to a god, they used the Doric, and to a > goddess, the Ionic. Yet all architects have not followed that [principle], > shown in Vitruvius's text ... accordingly I have made use, at the palace of > Her Majesty the Queen, of the Ionic order, on the view that it is delicate > and of greater beauty than the Doric, and more ornamented and enriched with > distinctive features.Quoted by Thomson, 169. Catherine de' Medici was closely involved in planning and supervising the building.De l'Orme wrote that Catherine, with \\"an admirable understanding combined with great prudence and wisdom,\\" took the trouble \\"to order the organization of her said palace (the Tuileries) as to the apartments and location of the halls, antechambers, chambers, closets and galleries, and to give the measurements of width and length\\". Quoted by Knecht, 228. De l'Orme records, for example, that she told him to take down some Ionic columns that struck her as too plain. She also insisted on large panels between the dormers to make room for inscriptions.Thomson, 171; Blunt, Art and Architecture in France, 55. The way the dormers overlap the pedimented panels gives the effect of blurrier lines than in the more classical works de l'Orme had designed for Henry II. Only a part of de l'Orme's scheme was ever built: the lower section of a central pavilion, containing an oval staircase, and a wing on either side. Though work on de l'Orme's design was abandoned in 1572, two years after his death, it is nonetheless held in high regard. According to Thomson, \\"The surviving portions of the palace scattered between the Tuileries gardens, the courtyards of the Ecole des Beaux-Arts [Paris] and the Ch√¢teau de la Punta in Corsica show that the columns, pilasters, dormers and tabernacles of the Tuileries were the outstanding masterpieces of non-figurative French Renaissance architectural sculpture\\".Thomson, 171 ‚Ä¢ Pons, 79. Counts J√©rome and Charles Pozzo di Borgo bought sections of the ruins during the demolition of the Tuileries in 1883 and used them to construct the ch√¢teau de la Punta in Corsica, overlooking the gulf of Ajaccio (1885‚Äì7). Drawing by Jacques Androuet du Cerceau of an enlarged project of 1578‚Äì1579 for the Tuileries, with oval halls De l'Orme's original plans have not survived. Jacques Androuet du Cerceau, however, has left us a set of plans for the Tuileries. One engraving shows a grandiose palace, with three courts and two oval halls. This design is atypical of de l'Orme's style and so is likely to have been du Cerceau's own proposal or his son Baptiste's.Knecht, 229; Thomson 165‚Äì66. It recalls the houses with tall pavilions and multiple courtyards that du Cerceau often drew in the 1560s and 1570s. Architectural historian David Thomson suggests that the oval halls within du Cerceau's courtyards were Catherine de' Medici's idea. She may have planned to use them for her famously lavish balls and entertainments.Thomson, 168. In June 1565 and September 1581, Catherine had temporary oval structures built to house entertainments for state occasions. Du Cerceau's drawings reveal that, before he published them in 1576, Catherine decided to join the Louvre to the Tuileries by a gallery running west along the north bank of the Seine. Only the ground floor of the first section, the Petite Galerie, was completed in her lifetime.Thomson, 173. The reliefs on the arches of the Petite Galerie, like those on the court front of the Louvre, symbolise the might and moral authority of the Valois monarchy. Those of de l'Orme at the Tuileries are purely classical in style and follow the principles of Vitruvius. It was left to Henry IV, who ruled from 1589 to 1610, to add the second floor and the Grande Galerie that finally linked the two palaces.Thomson, 172. After de l'Orme died in 1570, Catherine abandoned his design for a freestanding house with courtyards. To his unfinished wing she added a pavilion that extended the building towards the river. This was built in a less experimental style by Jean Bullant. Bullant attached columns to his pavilion, as advocated in his 1564 book on the classical orders, to mark proportion. Some commentators have interpreted his different approach as a criticism of de l'Orme's departures from the style of Roman monuments.Thomson, 173‚Äì4. The only elements Bullant harmonised with de l'Orme's work were the ground-floor Ionic columns and the frieze and cornice between the first and ground floors. Jean Bullant's pavilion at the Tuileries, in an engraving of 1725 by Michel F√©libien Despite its unfinished state, Catherine often visited the palace. She held banquets and festivities there and loved to walk in the gardens. According to the French military leader Marshal Tavannes, it was in the Tuileries gardens that she planned the St. Bartholomew's Day massacre, in which thousands of Huguenots were butchered in Paris.Frieda, 306. The gardens had been laid out before work on the palace halted. They included canals, fountains, and a grotto decorated with glazed animals by the potter Bernard Palissy.Knecht, 232. In 1573, Catherine hosted the famous entertainment at the Tuileries that is depicted on the Valois tapestries. This was a grand ball for the Polish envoys who had come to offer the crown of Poland to her son, the duke of Anjou, later Henry III of France.Knecht, 230. Henry IV later added to the Tuileries; but Louis XVI was to dismantle sections of the palace. The communards set fire to the remainder in 1871. Twelve years later, the ruins were demolished and then sold off.Ayers, 42. Saint-Maur Ch√¢teau de Saint- Maur, architect: Philibert de l'Orme The palace of Saint-Maur-des-Foss√©s, south east of Paris, was another of Catherine's unfinished projects. She bought this building, on which Philibert de l'Orme had worked, from the heirs of Cardinal Jean du Bellay, after the latter's death in 1560.Blunt, Art and Architecture in France, 49. She then commissioned de l'Orme to finish the work he had begun there. Drawings by Jacques Androuet du Cerceau in the British Museum may shed light on Catherine's intentions for Saint-Maur. They show a plan to enlarge each wing by doubling the size of the pavilions next to the main block of the house. The house was to stay as one storey, with a flat roof and rusticated pilasters. That meant the extensions would not unbalance the masses of the building as seen from the side. De l'Orme died in 1570; in 1575 an unknown architect took over at Saint-Maur.Blunt, Art and Architecture in France, 89, believes this architect was Jean Bullant, of whom he writes: \\"In these last years, Bullant's desire for the colossal seems to have grown greater, and in this case it could not be harmonized with the existing building\\". The new man proposed to heighten the pavilions on the garden side and top them with pitched roofs. He also planned two more arches over de l'Orme's terrace, which joined the pavilions on the garden side.Knecht, 231. The terrace was supported by a cryptoporticus, a covered passageway. In historian R. J. Knecht's view, the scheme would have given this part of the house, a \\"colossal, even grotesque\\" pediment.Knecht, 231. The work was only partly carried out, and the house was never fit for Catherine to live in. The Ch√¢teau de Saint-Maur, still in the possession of the Cond√© family, was nationalised during the French Revolution, emptied of its contents, and its terrains divided up among real- estate speculators. The structure was demolished for the value of its materials; virtually nothing remains. H√¥tel de la Reine Isra√´l Silvestre of the H√¥tel de la Reine in Paris: the central and right-hand sections are those built during Catherine's lifetime. The Colonne de l'Horoscope can be seen in the background, to the right. Medici column After de l'Orme's death, Jean Bullant replaced him as Catherine's chief architect. In 1572, Catherine commissioned Bullant to build a new home for her within the Paris city walls. She had outgrown her apartments at the Louvre and needed more room for her swelling household.Knecht, 230. Between 1575 and 1583, for example, the number of Catherine's ladies-in-waiting rose from 68 to 111. To make space for the new scheme and its gardens, she had an entire area of Paris demolished.Frieda, 335. The area, in the parish of Saint-Eustache, included the H√¥tel Guillart and the H√¥tel d'Albret. The new palace was known in Catherine's time as the H√¥tel de la Reine and later as the H√¥tel de Soissons. Engravings made by Isra√´l Silvestre in about 1650 and a plan from about 1700 show that the H√¥tel de la Reine possessed a central wing, a courtyard, and gardens.Plan of the H√¥tel de la Reine, from an engraving of about 1700. Thomson, 176. The walled gardens of the h√¥tel included an aviary, a lake with a water jet, and long avenues of trees. Catherine also installed an orangery that could be dismantled in winter. The actual construction work was carried out after Bullant's death in 1582.Thomson, 176‚Äì7. The building was demolished in the 1760s. All that remains of the H√¥tel de la Reine today is a single Doric column, known as the Colonne de l'Horoscope or Medici column, which stood in the courtyard.Thomson, 176 It can be seen next to the domed Bourse de commerce. Catherine's biographer Leonie Frieda has called it \\"a poignant reminder of the fleeting nature of power\\".Frieda, 455. Chenonceau Catherine had two galleries built on Diane's bridge over the Cher River at Chenonceau. In 1576, Catherine decided to enlarge her ch√¢teau of Chenonceau, near Blois. On Henry II's death, she had demanded this property from Henry's mistress Diane de Poitiers. She had not forgotten that Henry had given this crown property to Diane instead of to her.Frieda, 144. In return, she gave Diane the less prized Chaumont. When Diane arrived at Chaumont, she found signs of the occult, such as pentangles drawn on the floor. She quickly withdrew to her ch√¢teau of Anet and never set foot in Chaumont again.Frieda, 148. Diane had carried out major works at Chenonceau, such as de l'Orme's bridge over the Cher River. Now Catherine set out to efface or outdo her former rival's work. She lavished vast sums on the house and built two galleries on the extension over the bridge. The architect was almost certainly Bullant. The decorations show the fantasy of his late style.Blunt, Art and Architecture in France, 89. Jean Bullant's planned enlargements at Chenonceau (c. 1572), drawn by Jacques Androuet du Cerceau, 1579 Catherine loved gardens and often conducted business in them.Benes, 211. At Chenonceau, she added waterfalls, menageries, and aviaries, laid out three parks, and planted mulberry trees for silkworms. Jacques Androuet du Cerceau made drawings of a grandiose scheme for Chenonceau. A trapezoidal lower court leads to a forecourt of semicircular atria joined to two halls that flank the original house.Thomson, 165. These drawings may not be a reliable record of Bullant's plans. Du Cerceau \\"sometimes inserted in his book designs embodying ideas which he himself would have liked to see carried out rather than those of the actual designer of the building in question\\".Knecht, 232, quotes Blunt, Philibert de l'Orme (London, 1958), 89‚Äì91. Jacques Androuet du Cerceau was a favourite architect of Catherine's. Like Bullant, he became a more fantastical designer with time.Blunt, Art and Architecture in France, 90. Nothing he built himself, however, has survived. He is known instead for his engravings of the leading architectural schemes of the day, including Saint-Maur, the Tuileries, and Chenonceau. In 1576 and 1579, he produced the two-volume Les Plus Excellents Bastiments de France, a beautiful publication dedicated to Catherine.Blunt, Art and Architecture in France, 91. The original drawings are now in the British Museum. His work is an invaluable record of buildings that were never finished or were later substantially altered.Blunt, Art and Architecture in France, 91. End of the dynasty Catherine spent ruinous sums of money on buildings at a time of plague, famine, and economic hardship in France. Cunningham, 280‚Äì81. So widespread and serious was the plague of 1565, for example, that Catherine had the surgeon Ambroise Par√© write an account of it. He concluded that plague resulted from poisoning of the air and was \\"often sent by the just anger of God punishing our offences\\". As the country slipped deeper into anarchy, her plans grew ever more ambitious.Thomson, 168. Yet the Valois monarchy was crippled by debt and its moral authority was in steep decline. The popular view condemned Catherine's building schemes as obscenely extravagant. This was especially true in Paris, where the parlement was often asked to contribute to her costs.

Of what use is her Tuileries to us? Of none, Moreau; it is but > vanity. It will be deserted within a hundred years.Knecht, 233. Ronsard > addressed these lines to the financial official Raoul Moreau. Au tresorier > de l'esparne (ca. 1573). Ronsard was in many ways proved correct. The death of Catherine's beloved son Henry III in 1589, a few months after her own, brought the Valois dynasty to an end. Precious little of Catherine's grand building work has survived.

Pratt was born in San Francisco, California, where his parents were telegraph operators. He learned Morse code when young and worked briefly as a shipboard wireless operator before entering the University of California (Class of 1914). After graduation, he joined the American Marconi Company and helped to install and operate its 300-kilowatt trans- Pacific radio station at Bolinas, California and its companion receiver station in Marshall, California. From 1915-1920 Pratt was a radio aide to the United States Navy, leading its radio laboratory and engineering at Mare Island Navy Yard, California. In this role he installed radio equipment on Navy ships and maintained West Coast shore stations until 1918, when he moved to Washington, DC, to take charge of the construction and maintenance of all high-power Navy radio stations. From 1920-1926 Pratt worked for the Federal Telegraph Company in Palo Alto, California, where he designed a system for commercial radio telegraph service. When in 1926 the United States Congress passed the Air Commerce Act to fund radio aids to air navigation, J. Howard Dellinger of the National Bureau of Standards tapped Pratt and Harry Diamond to create a suitable radio beacon system in 1927-1928. In 1928 Pratt became chief engineer of the Mackay Radio and Telegraph Company, subsequently acquired by the International Telephone and Telegraph Company (ITT), where he eventually became vice president and general manager. During World War II, Pratt served as Division Chief in the Office of Scientific Research and Development and was Chairman of the Radio Technical Planning Board 1945-1949, and in 1946 was an official observer of the Bikini atomic bomb tests. He remained with ITT until 1951 when he served from 1951-1953 as telecommunications advisor to Presidents Truman and Eisenhower. Pratt was vice president of the American Cable and Radio Corporation from 1953-1958. Pratt joined the Institute of Radio Engineers (IRE), became an IRE Director in 1935, served as president of the IRE in 1938, and was its secretary from 1943-1965. He was awarded the IRE Medal of Honor in 1944 \\"in recognition of his engineering contributions to the development of radio, of his work in the extension of communication facilities to distant lands, and of his constructive leadership in Institute affairs,\\" and the Founder's Award in 1960. The IEEE Haraden Pratt Award was established in 1971 in his honor. His papers are archived at the Bancroft Library, University of California, Berkeley.

Northwood offers a number of academies for students as well as a variety of sports and clubs. In 2018, Northwood's six academies include Montgomery Middle College (MC2); Music, Theater and Dance; Politics, Advocacy and Law; Technological, Environmental and System Sciences; Humanities, Arts and Media; and Finance, Accounting, Marketing and Education. Northwood originally opened its doors in 1956. The school was closed after 29 years in 1985 due to changing demographics in the area. As the need for additional space for high school students grew in later years, the Montgomery County Public School System re- opened Northwood in 2004. The principal is Mildred Charley-Greene. She was appointed principal to Northwood in 2013 and was named 2019 Principal of the Year by the Maryland Association of Secondary School Principals. Northwood High School is located in unincorporated Montgomery County, Maryland, and is part of Montgomery County Public Schools. It is in the Kemp Mill census- designated place,2010 CENSUS - CENSUS BLOCK MAP: Kemp Mill CDP, MD\\" (Archive). U.S. Census Bureau. Retrieved on June 22, 2015. and it has a Silver Spring postal address. History In order to relieve overcrowding in local schools adjacent to major federal installations or defense projects, President Eisenhower signed Title 45 Public Law 81-874 \\"ASSISTANCE FOR SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION\\" with $1,500,000 contributed to Montgomery County. It was decided to build a new high school along 30 Acres on Old Bladensburg Road (later known as University Blvd) in Silver Spring with planned opening in fall 1956. The 2 story brick, tile, and glass rambler cost $1,955,143, with a student population of 1425. At its dedication Arthur S. Adams, president of the American Council on Education, described the school as a \\"Magnificent Building\\" to a crowd of 1000 visitors. The Northwood area grew prior to construction. The new school became a combination junior / senior high school named Northwood Junior Senior High School with new principal Edward (Ted) A. Bartlett. Principal Bartlett was Harvard educated, a World War II veteran, and the former basketball coach from Winchester High School in Winchester, Massachusetts. At the start of school September 1956, there was no working bell system, no mirrors in the wash rooms, no lockers, no cafeteria. They used whistles to mark start-stop of class periods. On February 1, 1960 Harold R. Packard replaced Bartlett. Eugene R. Smoley became Principal in 1972. In 1977 Principal Bobby J. Mullis replaced Smoley, and retired at the 1985 closing. =Closing= The closing of Northwood High School was discussed and voted on 3 times by the Montgomery County School Board starting in 1981 and finally ordered closed in a contested decision that aimed to alleviate the concentration of minorities enrolling at Montgomery Blair High School. A nonprofit group, Northwood Community Solidarity Inc, was established to fight the closure. After the closing, school trophies were given to students, and alumni. The varsity uniforms were sold to students for $1. The Northwood Indian headdress was donated to Wheaton Library for display. From 1987 to 2004, Northwood was used to hold students from other high schools during renovations. The school was re-opened in 2004 due to increasing population. During its original run, the school's mascot was the Indians. A September 2001 vote by the Board of Education banned ethnic and race-based team mascots at county schools. Students in the first class and Alumni from the 1958 first graduating class chose the Gladiators as the new mascot. =Reopening= Prior to the reopening the funds saved by the Northwood Community Solidarity for 20 years, $8,500, was donated to Northwood in memory of the late Bobby Mullis. 2008 was the first year since the school reopened in which there were all four classes. The school had approximately 1,400 students. This size has moved it from a division 2A school in Maryland High School athletics, to a division 3A school for the 2009-10 school year. As of the 2019-20 school year, Northwood High School boasts over 1800 studentshttps://www.montgomeryschoolsmd.org/departments/regulatoryaccountability/glance/currentyear/schools/04796.pdf from diverse backgrounds. =Bomb threat= On the morning of Tuesday, April 29, 2014, Northwood High School and Northwest High School in Germantown, Maryland were evacuated after a bomb threat. The Montgomery County Police Department (MCPD) received information about the threat at 9:30 a.m. (EDT) and searched the schools, finding no bombs, and deeming them to be safe at 10:51 a.m. (EDT). Sports In 2018, Northwood students participated in 45 teams across 18 sports for the fall, winter, and spring seasons. Students played on both varsity and junior varsity levels and hosted girl, boy, and co-ed teams. Sports included baseball, basketball, bocce, cross country, field hockey, football, golf, lacrosse, pom pom, racquetball, side cheer, soccer, softball, swimming, tennis, track, volleyball, and wrestling. The school's sports program is only in their second season of having varsity teams. The varsity football squad earned a record of 5-5 and the varsity basketball team reached the regional playoffs. The boys soccer team has won the 3A/2A division championship for two consecutive years (2008, 2009). The boys Cross country running team has won the Montgomery County Public Schools division IV championship two consecutive years (2008, 2009). The boys cross-country team qualified to run in the state championships out of the 3A West region in 2009. In 2009 the girls Cross-Country team won the Montgomery County Public Schools division IV championship. In 2008 Northwood had three division 2A state champions in indoor track and one champion and runner-up in outdoor track. The varsity cheerleading squad placed second in their division in the December 2008 Montgomery County Public Schools competition. The varsity cheerleading squad placed first in their division and won spirit award in the November 2009 Montgomery County Public Schools competition Prior to closing in 1985, Northwood had a number of division, county, regional, and state championships in a variety of sports. Don Greenberg was an all county member of the football and baseball teams during the 1973 and 1974 seasons which are often referred to as the \\"glory years\\" of Northwood athletics. School facilities The schools location is at the north-east corner of University Boulevard West and Arcola Avenue in Silver Spring, Maryland. The school's architect, William N. Denton Jr., designed a classic H-shaped construction. The original school opened with 55 classrooms, 11 administrative offices, a large gym, and 108 seat library and cafeteria seating 456. Before the end of the first year, plans were made to add an additional 14 new classrooms. Northwood has a recently remodeled multipurpose stadium where their football, soccer, track and lacrosse teams play, named after former Northwood Technology Education, (mostly Electronics) teacher David Kaplan who became an activist lobbying to keep the school open in 1985. The athletic area of Northwood also includes two baseball fields, a track, and a concessions area to the left of the main stands of Kaplan Stadium. The school has a Media Center that mainly serves as a library. There is also a band room, alternate music room, a full wellness center, and a film room that is the location of Northwood's television and radio station, WNHS. WNHS During the early 1970s, WNHS was a low-power AM radio station, used for broadcasting home football games. WNHS became the television and radio station at Northwood high school. Unique throughout the county to Northwood High School, WNHS performs a live news show broadcast to students and faculty for the first twenty minutes of every school day. The program also covers sporting and school-wide events, such as graduation and prom. Shortly after reopening, the program entered and won awards in video competitions.

In 1966 in Greenwich Village, New York City, he formed the band Roger and Wendy with his partner, Wendy Penney. Performing in Village coffeehouses and clubs, such as Gerde's Folk City, the Cafe Wha? The Bitter End and the Cafe Au Go Go, they broke ground in what has come to be known as the psychedelic folk genre. They were one of the very few American innovators to play in this style as it was primarily a British movement. Characterized as having strong roots in folk music, it has electric and often complex or unconventional arrangements, with liberal use of effects such as phasing, wah wah or fuzz.

History  Renoir made a trip to Italy in 1881-82 and was deeply influenced by Renaissance art. After this trip he began to explore a new manner of painting, different from impressionism. He started to emphasize contours and modeling, abandoned the principle that scenes should be painted outdoors to capture light and atmosphere. Late in the summer of 1883, Renoir spent about a month in St. Peter Port, the capital of Guernsey, and admired the rocks, cliffs and stunning view of Moulin Huet Bay in St. Martin. He painted the starts of fifteen pictures during his stay, most of which were finished later in his Paris studio. Guernsey lies 48 km off the coast of mainland Normandy. Both share the same geology and Guernsey fulfills the \\"by the sea\\" criterion in the exhibition title. However, By the Seashore is thought to have been painted in the artist's studio. The beach depicted here is probably not in the Channel Islands but near Dieppe, on the Normandy coast. The model was Aline Charigot, his then girlfriend, whom he married in 1890. The arc of the sitter's dark eyebrows and saucily tilted nose in that pleasant, rosy-cheeked face are common to works by Renoir. Provenance The painting is in the collection of the Metropolitan since 1929 from the bequest of Mrs. H. O. Havemeyer.

They were recruited to play as the backing group to singer Adam Faith the following year, and continued to perform and record until the late 1960s. History The group originated among friends at Sutton High School for Boys, including guitarist Peter Thorp. Originally called the Strangers, they were seen by publicist Leslie Perrin, who recommended them to Adam Faith's manager Eve Taylor. Faith was looking for a touring band that would enable him to perform similar music to that of the beat bands then emerging from Merseyside. Renamed as the Roulettes, the band - then comprising Peter Thorp, Martin Blackwell, Tony Burgess and John Roberts - first performed with Faith at the Royal Albert Hall in September 1961.Eddy Bonte, \\"Soon You'll Be Leaving Me\\", Shindig! magazine, issue 84, October 2018 The group toured widely with Faith between 1961 and 1963, with several changes of personnel, and recorded one unsuccessful single for Pye, \\"Hully Gully Slip'n'Slide\\". By early 1963, the group comprised Thorp (guitar), John Rogers (bass), Bob Henrit (drums), and Russ Ballard (guitar and keyboards). They recorded a lengthy series of short 15-minute shows with Adam Faith for Radio Luxembourg. John Rogers was killed in a car crash in May 1963; he was replaced by John 'Mod' Rogan, previously of Hartlepool group the Hartbeats. They began recording with Adam Faith - who had previously recorded with session musicians - for the Parlophone label, and their records were credited to \\"Adam Faith with The Roulettes\\". They enjoyed a run of chart hits in the mid-1960s, including the UK chart hits; \\"The First Time\\", \\"We Are in Love\\", \\"I Love Being in Love With You\\", \\"If He Tells You\\", and \\"Someone's Taken Maria Away\\". They also recorded in their own right for Parlophone, recording several early compositions by Chris Andrews, though none of their singles reached the charts. Their only album Stakes And Chips was released in 1965 with similar success. As well as backing Adam Faith on record, they accompanied him on tour until October 1965, most notably backing him on a 'Live' album. Early in 1967 they joined the Philips Fontana label but still the charts eluded them, although they toured Europe until later that year when the group split up.[ Biography], Allmusic.com Band members Russ Ballard and Bob Henrit went on to join Unit 4 + 2 formed by original Roulettes' member Brian Parker (on whose 1965 number one song, \\"Concrete and Clay\\", they had both previously played); the two would later also become members of rock band Argent. In addition Ballard had later success as a solo artist and songwriter, whilst Henrit became a renowned session drummer and also replaced The Kinks' long serving drummer Mick Avory in their later years. Adam Faith's song \\"Cowman, Milk Your Cow\\" was written by Bee Gees members Barry and Robin Gibb on which the Roulettes (Ballard, Rogan and Henrit) played, Fleetwood Mac's Peter Green also played guitar on the song.

Their main activity areas include: new product evaluation, post market review and compliance and enforcement. The PMRA works with provincial, territorial and federal departments in Canada to help refine and strengthen pesticide regulation across the country. Outside of Canada, the Agency works closely with international organizations such as the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the North American Free Trade Agreement Technical Working Group, the European Union, and the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD).canada.ca: \\"About Health Canada -> Branches and Agencies -> Pest Management Regulatory Agency\\" They work to align the processes used to regulate pest control products and uphold the protection of health and the environment. As of April 2017, the agency has approximately 400 employees. Over 75% of PMRA‚Äôs employees are scientists, with specializations in toxicology, environmental science, biology and chemistry. Other employees include policy, regulations, communications and administration. The PMRA's headquarters is in the Sir Charles Tupper Building in Ottawa, ON. History In 1990, the Pesticides Registration Review Team was tasked with developing recommendations to improve the federal pesticide regulatory system. The Review Team consulted with Canadians across the country proposing a major reform to the federal pest management regulatory system.Recommendations for a Revised Federal Pest Management Regulatory System, Final Report, December 1990 Proposed reforms from the Review Team were to establish a multi-stakeholder advisory council and the federal/provincial/territorial committee. Furthermore to increase public participation they recommended providing access to information on regulatory decisions with the intention of increasing openness and transparency. Additional suggestions to improve operation included: * The use of a risk management approach * Labeling provisions for safe use * Re-evaluation of older pesticides and special reviews that may result from new information * Data protection policy * A cost recovery scheme * Mandatory incident reporting * Compliance and enforcement strategies and provisions The Canadian government provided a response in 1994 recognizing the principles of environmental sustainability: to protect human health, safety and the environment by minimizing the risks associated with pesticides all while enabling access to pest control products and pest management strategies. The goals listed above helped work to set up the agency‚Äôs mandate.Government Proposal for the Pest Management Regulatory System, October 1994 In 1995, the formation of the Pest Management Regulatory Agency was approved with the purpose of consolidating the resources and responsibilities for pest management regulation. Staff and resources were consolidated from several federal departments ‚Äî Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada, Environment Canada, Natural Resources Canada, Fisheries and Oceans Canada and Health Canada ‚Äî into a single branch under Health Canada.canada.ca: Fact Sheet on the Pest Management Regulatory Agency, written and self-published February 1997 Although the other departments are no longer officially involved in the decision-making process, they support the work of the PMRA through research and monitoring activities in their respective fields of expertise.

DOI:10.1021/bk-1999-0724.ch023 By 1998, the PMRA had set up policies for product evaluations in which additional protection was required for vulnerable sectors like children and pregnant women, and pesticide exposure from all sources had to be taken into account, including food and water. These policies were formalized when a new Pest Control Products Act was approved in 2002 and came into force on June 28, 2006, replacing the 35-year old Act. On 31 January 2008, the Review Panel Regulations were instituted, to administer sections 35 to 40 of the then-renewed Act.orders-in-council.canada.ca: \\"PC Number: 2008-0178 Date: 2008-01-31\\" A statutory review of the Pest Control Products Act was held by the Health Committee of Parliament on 27 January 2015.

The PCPA and the Pest Control Products Regulations (PCPR) maintain that: * No person manufactures, stores, displays, distributes, or uses any pest control product under unsafe conditions * No person packages, labels, or advertises any pest control product in a manner that is false, misleading, or deceptive, or is likely to create a false impression about the pest control product * No person sells or imports a pest control product unless it is registered Other Acts which have an impact on pest management are the Pesticide Residue Compensation Act (PRCA) and the Food and Drugs Act (FDA). Additionally, the PMRA uses the Agriculture and Agri-Food Administrative Monetary Penalties Act and its associated regulations as an enforcement tool for the PCPA.  Main Activities  The primary role of the PMRA is to determine if a proposed pest control product can be used safely when label directions are followed and if the product is effective for its intended use. Under the Pest Control Products Act (PCPA) a ‚Äúpest control product‚Äù is defined as: (a) a product, an organism or a substance, including a product, an organism or a substance derived through biotechnology, that consists of its active ingredient, formulants and contaminants, and that is manufactured, represented, distributed or used as a means for directly or indirectly controlling, destroying, attracting or repelling a pest or for mitigating or preventing its injurious, noxious or troublesome effects; (b) an active ingredient that is used to manufacture anything described in paragraph (a); or (c) any other thing that is prescribed to be a pest control product. = New Product Evaluation = Before a product can be submitted for evaluation, the PMRA has over 200 types of mandated tests that developers must perform to verify that the end product does not pose unacceptable risks. The PMRA then uses the given data to perform independent assessments in accordance with the PCPA. A product will only be registered if there is sufficient scientific evidence to show it does not pose an unacceptable health or environmental risk and that it serves a useful purpose. In all cases the conditions of registration are specified, including label direction instructions, so that the product can be used safely. = Post Market Review = Re-evaluations are used to access any changes in data requirements and verify that the products comply with modern day standards. A re-evaluation must be initiated if 15 years have passed since the last major risk assessment. Re-evaluations can result in amendments to the use pattern, label statements, or classification of a product. However, if it is determined that the risks to human health or the environment are no longer acceptable, or that the product is without value for its intended purpose, the registration is cancelled. Special reviews allow the PMRA to cancel or amend the registration of one or more registered pest control products without waiting for its scheduled re-evaluation. The special review of a product is initiated if there is reason to believe that risks may no longer acceptable based on new scientific information. To continue to monitor for safety after products are registered, registrants are required to report pesticide sales volumes along with any incidents associated with their products. Under the PCPA, company reports include adverse human and environmental effects as well as new data. Product users and the public can also report incidents. = Compliance and Enforcement = Health Canada works to promote, monitor, and enforce pesticide compliance activities under the National Pesticides Compliance Program (NPCP). The program is administered jointly by the Pest Management Regulatory Agency and the Regulatory Operations and Enforcement Branch (ROEB) of Health Canada. The PMRA inspects reports of illegal pesticides or misuse through its network of regional officers. Additionally, laboratory scientists test pesticides to determine if they comply with the specifications for which registration was granted. Violations of the PCPA or PCPR are responded to with appropriate compliance and enforcement measures. These measures include: * Encouraging voluntary removal of product by the distributor * Seizing the product * Refusing entry of the product into Canada * Issuing a compliance order, warning or penalty * Amending suspending or cancelling the product registration  Risk Assessment Process  The PMRA applies science-based decision making to premarket and post market reviews. These reviews incorporate human health and environmental risk assessments, as well as value and product chemistry. Through scientific evaluations the PMRA establishes standards of protection for human health and the environment. These evaluations consist of a risk-based approach which assesses hazardous properties and possible exposure. Risk is calculated by multiplying toxicity by exposure. Therefore a pesticide with low toxicity and high exposure could pose a similar risk as a pesticide with high toxicity and low exposure. Built- in safety factors are designed to take into account the potential variability of response, both within the same species (e.g., adults versus children) and between species (e.g., animals versus humans). Additional risk mitigation and communication measures are put in place with more hazardous pesticides. = Health Evaluation = Toxicological evaluations identify the possible human health effects of pesticides and establish the levels at which humans can be exposed to products without any harm. The required studies are designed to assess the possible adverse health effects on a variety of species that may result from single, multiple or lifetime exposure from pesticides via various routes of exposure. Major studies include acute, short- and long-term toxicity; carcinogenicity; genetic, reproductive, and developmental toxicity; and teratology. Occupational Exposure Assessments (OEA) are performed to determine how much exposure to a pesticide could occur in a typical day. When performing the assessments, scientists take into account the different ways people are exposed to pesticides. One consideration is the different exposures of those who work with pesticides (formulators, applicators, and farmers) versus bystanders (people working or living near where a pesticide is used). Another consideration is the different exposures at various ages (i.e. adults and children). The assessments are based on factors like routes and duration of exposure, the species tested in toxicity studies and the endpoint of toxicological concern. OEAs also include the effectiveness of personal protective equipment (PPE). Dietary Exposure Assessments evaluates all possibilities in which a product could come in contact with food. The purpose of the evaluations is to set the maximum residue limits (MRLs) for pesticides on food, both domestic and imported, under the Food and Drugs Act. Dietary Risk Assessments (DRAs) are also carried out to assess the potential daily intake of pesticide residues from all possible food sources. DRAs take into account the distinctive eating patterns of infants, toddlers, children, adolescents and adults. Toxicological evaluations also help to set the Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI); the amount of a compound that can be consumed daily for a lifetime with no adverse effects. = Environmental Risk Assessment = The environmental risk posed by a pesticide is a function of its environmental fate and environmental toxicology. The environmental fate provides an indication of what will happen to the product once it enters the environment. Factors such as the behaviour of the product in soil, water and air, the potential for its uptake by plants and animals and the possibility of bioaccumulation are evaluated. During the environmental toxicology assessments, scientists examine the effects the product has on non-target terrestrial and aquatic species. = Value Assessment = The primary consideration in a value assessment is determining a product‚Äôs efficacy; put differently, ‚Äòdoes it do what it is claimed to do‚Äô. The assessment helps certify that only products that make a positive contribution to pest management are registered; helping to protect users from deceptive claims regarding the effectiveness of pest control products. The product is evaluated based on its health, safety and environmental benefits along with its social and economic impact. Furthermore, value assessments are used to establish the lowest effective rate at which pesticides can be applied to minimize the risks to health and the environment. = Risk Mitigation = In addition to carrying out evaluations, recommendations on how to best mitigate risk are made during the risk assessment process. Based on the information gathered during the above-mentioned assessments, risk management strategies are explored to see if any are available that might sufficiently mitigate the determined risk. Evaluators must decide if risk management strategies are necessary to mitigate environmental or health risks. Mitigation options reduce exposure; examples include protective clothing for applicators, buffer zones to protect the environment, reduction of application rates, etc. Label statements outline the risk mitigation measures identified during the review process. All registered products must bear a label, which is a legal document that dictates the use instructions and safety precautions. During the re-evaluation process, interim mitigation measures such as rate reductions or use restrictions can be put in place to revise label instructions that are outdated or no longer supported.  Service Fees  Approximately 30% of PMRA‚Äôs operating budget comes from cost recovery fees. This model realigns a portion of the costs of the product registration process from federal taxpayers to the private sector ensuring there is an appropriate cost-sharing balance. Present day, fees and charges fall under the Pest Control Products Fees and Charges Regulations, pursuant to section 67 of the Pest Control Products Act. The regulations were published on February 22, 2017 and came into effect on April 1, 2017. They are adjusted annually to account for inflation. As of 2018, individual fees can range from $80 to > $100, 000. Multiple fees may also apply to one application, therefore cost of a major new registration can be in the area of $400, 000.  Controversies  Robert Arnason, a journalist at the time working The Western Producer, wrote in September 2015 an open letter to the PMRA that remarked the lack of transparency with respect to pesticide sales figures, which had ostensibly been legislated in 2006.producer.com: \\"An open letter to leaders of Pest Management Regulatory Agency\\", 16 Sep 2015 In April 2015, the PMRA announced that glyphosate was due for a periodic review, and asked for public submissions. Both the active ingredient glyphosate and its formulated products were considered during the re-evaluation. Some glyphosate products also contain POEAs, which function as surfactants. The product labels were revised to ensure that a limit of 20% POEA by weight is directed. As of April 2017, all registered glyphosate end-use products in Canada meet the 20% limit.PMRA: \\"Frequently Asked Questions on the Re-evaluation of Glyphosate\\", 28 Apr 2017 By 2019, the labels will be changed to reflect the concerns of householders, addressing buffer zones and run-offs near aquatic zones.

It was taken down in January 2009, pending creation of a new version. Veropedia editors chose Wikipedia articles that met the site's reliability standards; information was then scraped, or chosen by an automatic process, and thereafter a stable version of the article was posted on Veropedia. Any improvements required for articles to reach a standard suitable for Veropedia had to be done on Wikipedia itself. This model was intended to provide benefits to both projects: Wikipedia's open nature and large volume, and Veropedia's stability and perpetuity. the site, still in beta, had checked and imported more than 5,800 articles from the English Wikipedia into its public database. Although Veropedia intended to eventually support itself completely through advertising, the project was mainly financed by those involved in the project, and in January 2009 it disabled articles and advertisements and announced a coming \\"Beta2\\". History Veropedia was started by a group of experienced Wikipedia editors, including founder Daniel Wool, who had prior experience editing a variety of reference works including Encyclopedia of the Peoples of the World and was an employee of the Wikimedia Foundation until spring 2007. By November 2007, roughly 100 Wikipedia editors were involved in the project. The help of academics who had worked on Wikipedia was also being sought. An explanatory page on the site stated that similar projects in languages other than English might be launched; it distinguished Veropedia from \\"expert-driven\\" wikis such as Citizendium. In January 2009, the encyclopedia contents were removed and replaced with a message stating that \\"The original version of Veropedia has been taken down for now while we work on a new Veropedia. This new Veropedia will have a superior method of handling articles and introduces an improved interface.\\" Management and legal status Veropedia was operated by Veropedia, Inc., a for-profit corporation registered in Florida, and founded by Wool,Wool is referred to as the founder and sole officer Newser.comBlog.edu-cyberpg.com with Veropedia described as \\"his startup\\" a former co-ordinator at the Wikimedia Foundation, the parent organization of Wikipedia. As required by its use of Wikipedia material, all Veropedia content was licensed under the GNU Free Documentation License. Contrast with Wikipedia *Articles were uploaded when they met Veropedia's criteria. Articles were not edited once uploaded. *Veropedia used only experienced article editors, and operated an automated system for uploading, which checked proposed articles for a wide range of issues, and refused to accept them if any were present. Independent human expert review of articles was planned for the final version, but was not implemented. In Veropedia's own words: \\"Each article will be given to recognized academics and experts to review. These experts can either provide their stamp of approval or make suggestions as to how the article can be improved further. In that way, users will know that the article is reliable. Our material is written by Wikipedia contributors. The role of experts and academics will be to check it and, ideally, approve it. Their comments will be given back to our contributors to incorporate back into the articles to make them even better.\\" *While Wikipedia allows almost anyone to edit, contributing to Veropedia was by approval (following a request) or invitation only. *Veropedia's content covered a smaller range than Wikipedia: at its height it had some 5800 articles vs. 3 million for Wikipedia. The focus was explicitly upon articles that are likely to be widely useful, and are improved to a high quality standard. , Veropedia's growth rate was around 300 articles per month.based upon a total of 90 articles uploaded during the ten days 9‚Äì18 December 2007, Veropedia.com *Unlike the English Wikipedia, Veropedia had a number of tighter restrictions. For example, exclusion of fair use images and other content. The Veropedia FAQ stated: \\"We have decided to... go back to the core principles of the project by focusing on free content. Only by insisting on free content can we revert the current trend of extending copyright and encourage people to release their content to the public.\\" *While Wikipedia is funded by donations, Veropedia used paid advertising. Daniel Wool commented: \\"I was in charge of fundraising for Wikipedia, and I feel a lot more comfortable taking ads from Amazon than the donations of high school students.\\" Evaluation Nicholas Carr, a critic of Web 2.0 in general and Wikipedia in particular, criticized Veropedia as trying to \\"scrape\\" the \\"cream\\" of Wikipedia. Carr has also stated that Veropedia had an unclear interface with clicks bouncing one back and forth between Wikipedia and Veropedia. Tim Blackmore, an associate professor at the Faculty of Information and Media Studies of the University of Western Ontario, expressed scepticism toward the project, since there are already encyclopedias in existence where \\"content is checked and articles are reviewed\\". The main lure of the internet, according to him, is \\"free information\\" and Wikipedia has already emerged as a pioneer in open content information resources. A different evaluation in The Australian said Veropedia \\"seems more likely to succeed\\" than Citizendium, another then-recently founded online encyclopedia, because \\"it is less directly competitive\\" with Wikipedia. The story opined that both Veropedia and Citizendium \\"should in theory help improve the fairness and accuracy of available online information about many contentious topics although the academic bent to each raises questions over what, exactly, they will construe as fair when it comes to coverage of corporations and their actions.\\" A story in Wired News discussed whether Veropedia (and Citizendium) could avoid some of the same problems that Wikipedia has supposedly encountered: \\"Though office politics and internecine bickering abound at the Wikimedia Foundation ‚Äì one former insider described the atmosphere as \\"MySpace meets 'As the World Turns' for geeks\\" ‚Äì both Wool and Sanger deny that internal squabbles were why they started their own encyclopedias. Whether their ventures fall prey to the same turf wars, bureaucratic quagmires and academic catfights as the site that spawned them remains to be seen.\\" In a review of various Wikipedia alternatives, TechNewsWorld argued that Veropedia's estimation of 5000 articles was not credible, as \\"many of these articles are small and insignificant almanac-type entries that serve mainly as filler\\". It thus argued that like Citizendium, Veropedia avoided \\"the tough challenge of handling controversial and time-sensitive subjects\\" that Wikipedia had taken on. The article also stated that most Veropedia articles were identical to their Wikipedia counterpart.

Biography Pierre Matthieu was born at Pesmes in the Haute- Sa√¥ne. He studied under the Jesuits and mastered Latin, Ancient Greek and Hebrew. At the age of 19, he served his father as adjunct at the Coll√®ge of Vercel (in the Doubs) and it was there that his tragedy Esther (published in Lyon in 1585) was performed by the students. He studied law at Valence, received his doctorat in 1586 and became a lawyer at the Pr√©sidial Court of Lyon. Although he had expressed his attachment to the House of Guise and the Catholic League, he was among those chosen and sent by the inhabitants of Lyon to King Henry IV of France in February 1594 to assure the new king of their fidelity. With the king having visited the city the year before, Matthieu was put in charge of organizing the ceremonies of the royal reception. Subsequently, he moved to Paris and, with the protection of Pierre Jeannin, he became historiograph. He was esteemed by the royal court and enjoyed special access to Henry IV. He fell ill accompanying Louis XIII at the siege of Montauban and died in Toulouse at the age of 58. Works Pierre Matthieu wrote five tragedies: * Clytemnestre (1578) - the story of Clytemnestra * Esther (1581) - the story of Esther * Vashti (1589) - the story of Vashti * Aman, de la perfidie (1589) - the story of Haman * La Guisiade (1589) - an attack of Henry III and justification of his assassination. The five tragedies of Matthieu sought -- despite their use of Biblical or ancient stories (other than La Guisade) -- to explore contemporary issues of the French Wars of Religion and to justify the noble defense of religion; the tragedies' heroes were generally allegorical representations of Henry I, Duke of Guise. As poet, he published Tablettes de la vie et de la mort and Quatrains de la vie et de la mort. His novels, La Magicienne, Aelius Sejanus and La Femme Cathenoise were hostile to Concini and his wife. He also wrote several works of history and royal historiography. References *This article is based on the equivalent article from the French Wikipedia, consulted on October 30, 2007.

Students, who achieve a 3 or better on the exam, may be awarded college credits at US universities and colleges. Each higher education institution sets its own standards about what level of credits are awarded to a student based on their AP exam score. Most higher education give credits for scores of 4 or 5. Some schools also give credits for scores of 3. High schools give credits towards graduation to students who take the school's AP class. At Tunkhannock Area High School 55% of students who took an AP course earned a 3 or better on the exam.PDE, School Performance Profile - Academic Performance Data - Tunkhannock Area High School, December 2014 Graduation requirements Tunkhannock Area School Board has determined that a pupil must earn 26 credits to graduate including: math 4 credits, English 4 credits, social studies 3 credits, science 3 credits, Arts and/or Humanities 2 credits, Computer 1 credit, Physical Education/health 1 credit and electives 8 credits. Students must take a minimum of 6.25 credits each year while enrolled in the Tunkhannock Area High School.Tunkhannock Area School Administration, Tunkhannock Area School District Strategic plan Academic and Assessment Plan, May 06, 2009 Students not being proficient on the PSSA have an alternate means of demonstrating proficiency on the PSSA as outlined in the board policy. By law, all Pennsylvania secondary school students must complete a project as a part of their eligibility to graduate from high school. The type of project, its rigor and its expectations are set by the individual school district. Students must complete 15 hours of community service as their high school graduation project. Effective with the graduating class of 2017, the Pennsylvania State Board of Education eliminated the state mandate that students complete a culminating project in order to graduate.Pennsylvania State Board of Education, Proposed changes to Chapter 4, May 10, 2012 By Pennsylvania School Board regulations, beginning with the class of 2017, public school students must demonstrate successful completion of secondary level course work in Algebra I, Biology, and English Literature by passing the Keystone Exams. The exam is given at the end of the course. Keystone Exams replace the PSSAs for 11th grade. Students have several opportunities to pass the exam. Schools are mandated to provide targeted assistance to help the student be successful. Those who do not pass after several attempts can perform a project in order to graduate. For the class of 2019, a Composition exam will be added. For the class of 2020, passing a civics and government exam will be added to the graduation requirements.Pennsylvania Department of Education, State Board of Education Finalizes Adoption of Pennsylvania Common Core State Academic Standards and High School Graduation Requirements, March 14, 2013 In 2011, Pennsylvania high school students field tested the Algebra 1, Biology and English Lit exams. The statewide results were: Algebra 1 38% on grade level, Biology 35% on grade level and English Lit - 49% on grade level. Individual student, school or district reports were not made public, although they were reported to district officials by the Pennsylvania Department of Education. Students identified as having special needs and qualifying for an Individual Educational Program (IEP) may graduate by meeting the requirements of their IEP. School safety and bullying The Tunkhannock Area School District administration reported there were zero incidents of bullying in Tunkhannock Area High School in 2014. Additionally, there were three simple assaults on students, three knife related incidents and one case of sexual harassment involving students. The local law enforcement was involved in eighteen incidents at the schools, which resulted in no arrests. Each year the school safety data is reported by the district to the Safe School Center which then publishes the compiled reports online. Nationally, nearly 20% of pupils report being bullied at school. The Tunkhannock Area School Board has provided the district's antibully policy online. All Pennsylvania schools are required to have an anti-bullying policy incorporated into their Code of Student Conduct. The policy must identify disciplinary actions for bullying and designate a school staff person to receive complaints of bullying. The policy must be available on the school's website and posted in every classroom. All Pennsylvania public schools must provide a copy of its anti-bullying policy to the Office for Safe Schools every year, and shall review their policy every three years. Additionally, the district must conduct an annual review of that policy with students. The Center for Schools and Communities works in partnership with the Pennsylvania Commission on Crime & Delinquency and the Pennsylvania Department of Education to assist schools and communities as they research, select and implement bullying prevention programs and initiatives. Education standards relating to student safety and anti harassment programs are described in the 10.3. Safety and Injury Prevention in the Pennsylvania Academic Standards for Health, Safety and Physical Education.

Wellness policy Tunkhannock Area School Board established a district wellness policy in 2010. The policy deals with nutritious meals served at school, the control of access to some foods and beverages during school hours, age appropriate nutrition education for all students, and physical education for students K-12. The policy is in response to state mandates and federal legislation (P.L. 108 ‚Äì 265). The law dictates that each school district participating in a program authorized by the Richard B. Russell National School Lunch Act (42 U.S.C. 1751 et seq) or the Child Nutrition Act of 1966 (42 U.S.C. 1771 et seq) \\"shall establish a local school wellness policy by School Year 2006.\\" Most districts identified the superintendent and school foodservice director as responsible for ensuring local wellness policy implementation. Tunkhannock Area High School offers both a free school breakfast and a free or reduced-price lunch to children in low income families. All students attending the school can eat breakfast and lunch. Children from families with incomes at or below 130 percent of the federal poverty level are provided a breakfast and lunch at no cost to the family. Children from families with incomes between 130 and 185 percent of the federal poverty level can be charged no more than 30 cents per breakfast. A foster child whose care and placement is the responsibility of the State or who is placed by a court with a caretaker household is eligible for both a free breakfast and a free lunch. Runaway, homeless and Migrant Youth are also automatically eligible for free meals.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs - Eligibility Manual for School Meals, 2012 The meals are partially funded with federal dollars through the United States Department of Agriculture.Pennsylvania Hunger Action Center, The Pennsylvania School Breakfast Report Card, 2009 In 2013, the USDA issued new restrictions to foods in public schools. The rules apply to foods and beverages sold on all public school district campuses during the day. They limit vending machine snacks to a maximum of 200 calories per item. Additionally, all snack foods sold at school must meet competitive nutrient standards, meaning they must have fruits, vegetables, dairy or protein in them or contain at least 10 percent of the daily value of fiber, calcium, potassium, and Vitamin D.USDA, Child Nutrition Programs, June 27, 2013 In order to comply with the Healthy, Hunger- Free Kids Act of 2010 all US public school districts are required to raise the price of their school lunches to $2.60 regardless of the actual cost of providing the lunch. The Healthy Hunger-Free Kids Act of 2010 mandates that districts raise their full pay lunch prices every year until the price of non- subsidized lunches equals the amount the federal government reimburses schools for free meals. That subsidy in 2013-2014 was $2.93. In 2014, President Obama ordered a prohibition of advertisements for unhealthy foods on public school campuses during the school day. The Food and Drug Administration requires that students take milk as their beverage at lunch. In accordance with this law, any student requesting water in place of milk with their lunch must present a written request, signed by a doctor, documenting the need for water instead of milk. Tunkhannock Area School District provides health services as mandated by the Commonwealth and the federal government. A nurse is available in the building to conduct annual health screenings (data reported to the PDE and state Department of Health) and to dispense prescribed medications to students during the school day. Students can be excluded from school unless they comply with all the State Department of Health‚Äôs extensive immunization mandates. School nurses monitor each pupil for this compliance. Nurses also monitor each child's weight. Cell phone search IN 2010 a student sued the districts and the high school principal for illegally searching her cell phone in violation of the Fourth Amendment of the US Constitution. The district settled with the American Civil Liberties Union admitting no wrongdoing, but paying $33,000 in settlement. Extracurriculars Tunkhannock Area School District offers a variety of clubs, activities and an extensive sports program in association with the Pennsylvania Interscholastic Athletic Association (PIAA). Eligibility for participation is determined by school board policy. By Pennsylvania law, all K-12 students residing in the district, including those who attend a private nonpublic school, cyber charter school, charter school and those homeschooled, are eligible to participate in the extracurricular programs including all athletics. They must meet the same eligibility rules as the students enrolled in the district's schools. According to PA Child Abuse Recognition and Reporting Act 126 of 2014, all volunteer coaches and all those who assist in student activities, must have criminal background checks. Like all school district employees, they must also attend an anti child abuse training once every three years.Eleanor Chute., New Pa. law expands clearance requirements for school volunteers, employees, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, December 15, 2014Ali Stevens., Child Protective Services Law impacts schools, WKOK.com 1070AM, January 6, 2015 = Athletics = Coaches receive compensation as outlined in the teachers' union contract.

Biography Born in St. Louis, Missouri, Cash was and a graduate of St. Louis's Sumner High School (also attended by Luther Ingram, Billy Davis, Jr., and Tina Turner). Around 1962, he and three of his brothers moved to Chicago, where they performed as a dance act. Cash also searched for a recording contract. Andre Williams, who was the house producer at One-der-ful Records saw them perform as The Crawlers and had them record a tune, \\"Twine Time,\\" to exploit a popular teen dance that was the rage on the south side of Chicago in late 1963. Released on One-der-ful's Mar-V-Lus imprint in 1964, the tune became a pop hit in January 1965, and whereas 'The Crawlers' proper (Cash's brothers) did not sing on the track, a band called The NightlitersThis might be The Nite-Liters but there is no certainty about that. from Louisville, KY provided the instrumental backing. The \\"ooh-aah\\" opening was edited out on some radio stations who thought it too suggestive for their audience. \\"Twine Time\\" became popular in the UK in the Northern soul scene in the 1970s. The Crawlers name appeared on the two follow-up singles, \\"The Barracuda\\" (a national r&b; hit in 1965) and \\"The Penguin,\\" which failed to chart. By the fourth release, the Nightlighters, which had been touring with Cash and backing him on all his sides, were credited as \\"The Registers,\\" and that credit appeared on the next five Mar-V-Lus singles, namely, \\"Boston Monkey\\" (1965), \\"The Philly Freeze\\" (a national hit in 1966), \\"Alvin's Boo-Ga- Loo\\" (1966), \\"Doin' the Ali Shuffle\\" (1967), and \\"The Charge\\" (big local Chicago hit in 1967). Cash went solo after a few further singles, and recorded an album in tribute to Muhammad Ali; he also acted in several blaxploitation films, such as Petey Wheatstraw and Black Bart.

The Vezo speak a dialect of the Malagasy language, which is a branch of the Malayo-Polynesian language group derived from the Barito languages, spoken in southern Borneo. They currently populate most of the littoral zone along Madagascar's west coast between Toliara and Mahajanga. \\"Vezo\\" literally means the people who fish, but also has been known to mean 'to struggle with the sea'.Kaufmann Ethnic identity Distribution of Malagasy ethnic groups. The Vezo are classified with the Sakalava people. Vezo do not identify with a particular Malagasy ethnic group but instead with their way of life.Rita Astuti They currently populate most of the littoral zone along Madagascar's west coast between Toliara and Mahajanga.Chelonia Mydas Like most other Madagascan ethnic groups, their origins can directly be traced to that original mix of Austronesian settlers from Asia and the Bantu migrants from mainland East Africa. They have been known to state emphatically that they need have no common origin or shared essence with one another. Their identity is contextual and achieved by doing, embodied in learned skills such as fishing or swimming and the callouses they produce, rather than in blood, genes, or skin color. Because of their semi-nomadic marine migrations, their population is difficult to determine and has been estimated by counting the dugout canoes called pirogues (lakanas in Malagasy language) around Madagascar. History There are two parts to this history which are relevant to the Vezo view of the environment ‚Äì how and why the original clans of Andavadoaka left their former village and how they came to choose the site that is now Andavadoaka. The three clans that established Andavadoaka relocated to avoid the regular invasion by bandits. Marauders from inland tribes regularly attacked the old village a few kilometres north. As pacifists, the Vezo rarely defend their property and are often attacked by others. The villagers wanted an end to these attacks so used their knowledge of local fish to catch poisonous lionfish and gobies, which they cooked and scattered around the village just before the expected attack. After preparing the poison trap, the villagers sailed in their pirogues to the outlying islands to hide from the bandits. Expecting an empty village, knowing the Vezo always flee from attacks, the unsuspecting bandits arrived and ate the food that had been left behind. Many of the bandits died. On returning the villagers saw the corpses of the poisoned bandits and referred to them as those who had died from eating lionfish (moroy), and from then on referred to the village as the ‚Äòdead of moroy‚Äô or ‚ÄòTratna amy moroy.‚Äô The name of the village to this day is Antsatsamoroy. Attacks by bandits continue today. In December 2003 to January 2004, March and October 2005 and March to May 2006, cattle rustlers, dahalo or malaso, threatened villagers and stole cattle at pastures in the spiny forest, inland from the village. There have been incidents involving local villagers ‚Äì one was fatally wounded by shooting after pursuing the armed malaso in the aftermath of a village raid. On each occasion, many of the Vezo villagers put their valuables in their pirogues and send women and children to the outlying islands for safety (in particular, Nosy Hao and Nosy Ve) ‚Äì sometimes almost completely depopulating the village. The second part of Andavadoaka's history ‚Äì how the clans came to choose Andavadoaka ‚Äì relates to the local landscape. Tired with attacks, the villagers sought a location hidden from both land and sea, where it would be harder for marauders to encounter the village by chance. Their chosen site was a depression in-between surrounding limestone outcrops, on the flattened sand dunes of a sheltered bay. The description given to the location of the village was the depression (lavaka) between the hills. To the east of the village there is a hill riddled with tunnels. The question, ‚Äòlavaka aiza?‚Äô (where is the hole?), and the answer, ‚Äòlavaka loaka‚Äô (the hole is in the rock), provided the name for the village ‚Äì ‚ÄòAndavadoaka‚Äô. Society Traditional fishing lakana with a crab claw sail from Madagascar Vezo-ness is this process of transformation. It is an identity that unfolds through time, rather than being fixed in time. The Vezo are a fishing people who inhabit a coastal belt extending from Intampolo in the south to Morondava in the north of southwest Madagascar. Andavadoaka is a village whose population are of the Vezo tribe. It has a population of 1,200, with over 50% under 15 years of age. Household income is mainly from fishing. Fishermen make use of mangroves for timber, wood, and fishing.Radhika Dave The fishers participate in an artisanal fishery reliant on pirogues (canoes, made by hollowing out a large log) powered by sail and paddle, and most fishing occurs 5 km or less from shore. Men predominantly fish with line, nets, and spears. Women glean the reef flats for invertebrates including octopus and sea cucumbers. Fish sales, processing and trade supplement local income, as does tourism and local commerce. The Vezo traditionally traded with the neighbouring agro-foresters, the Masikoro. The Vezo also trade with the Mikea, exchanging fish for honey and tubers.Stiles However, increased trade has changed the economy from barter to cash-based. Furthermore, growth in fish export from Madagascar has encouraged fish processing and export companies to the region, such as Murex and Copefrito (now operating in the southwest). Their purchases of marine products have increased fish demand and strengthened the cash economy. Besides gleaning the reef flats, women are the ones who sell the catches that men bring them. With what they earn, women buy rice, the staple food, other essential foodstuff and a variety of luxury items. Children go to school in the one village school building, where there are two designated teachers. However, due to the deterioration of public administration in Madagascar, the building and the teachers are hardly ever occupied. Whenever children are in the building, and if the teacher has not run out of chalk, the teaching largely consists in copying letters, numbers, and short sentences from the blackboard onto the child's own A5 size blackboard. Understandably, the many children who do not own a blackboard are allowed to play in the burning heat outside. Family ties are extremely important among the Vezo and elders are greatly respected in the community. Families often provide for each other with younger members building boats for the elderly to use. Maintaining family ties is important to ensure that one is looked after in old age, or after an accident or ill health. Family relationships are particularly important to Vezo fishers because they determine access to marine resources and fishing gear.Velondriake =Family affiliation= The Hazomanga is an elder in a family or clan who acts as the intermediary between the ancestors and his family member. His responsibilities include overseeing ceremonies and consulting the ancestors for advice when needed. The most senior village Hazomanga in Andavadoaka is also the village historian and is a member of one of the three founding clans of Andavadoaka. He attends village events when the community considers them to require the permission or consideration of the ancestors. The Hazomanga douses the ground in rum during each consultation with the ancestors. If an occasion is particularly important, local cattle, zebu, may be sacrificed. Culture The Vezo have official cultural ceremonies called Fomba. These include Bilo, Tromba, Savatse, Takasy and Soro. All these ceremonies, except Takasy, are practiced (with some variations) by the neighbouring inland Masikoro people. The circumcision ceremony typically lasts from 4 am until 9 am. The parents ask a wise elder to suggest the best date and time for the ceremony, and identify a nurse or doctor who knows how to perform the circumcision. Family members are invited to attend the ceremony, and one of the uncles holds the child during the ceremony. After the physical cut, there is drinking of alcohol. After the ceremony the child is called savatse. =Fady= The community life of the Vezo, as elsewhere in Madagascar, is guided by numerous fady (taboos). During the course of the life of a Vezo man, he is exposed to the danger of catching hanimboky, a very unpleasant disease that only affects men. The sickness literally means swollen/full with food, which makes it considered thus a male pregnancy. A man sick with hanimboky is unable to go the bathroom and this causes his stomach to swell up until it resembles the belly of a pregnant woman. The illness is caused by food that the male kin of a sexually active woman accepted and ate from her. The food is said to be dirty, for it is assumed that the woman had acquired it with 'tangy', the presents her lover gives her for having sex with him. When a man accepts food from one of his female kin, it is therefore as if he were receiving food from the woman's lover; if a man accepted such food, he would be put in a very inferior position. In essence, they are treated as if they were women by their daughter's or sister's lover. It is also fady to spill the turtle's blood on the sand. =Funeral rites= Vezo cemeteries lie in the forest, far away from the villages and are so well hidden by the vegetation that they are considered \\"invisible to the eye\\". The cemeteries must be hidden in this way because the sight of tombs makes the people sad and unhappy. Cemeteries are not places the Vezo like to visit very often. One does not simply go for a stroll near the cemetery. The living only approach a cemetery when they bear a corpse or when they have to \\"work\\" for the dead, such as digging graves and building tombs.Invisible Objects In western Madagascar, Sakalava and Vezo funerary sculpture is renowned internationally for its erotic wooden figures, often depicted during copulation and showing oversized phalluses and breasts. It is unknown as to why the sculptures have this sort of eroticism, but it may have to do with meeting growing tourist demand. Even after their ancestors have passed, the Vezo keep them involved in many different affairs. Many events in the productive, reproductive and social life of any Vezo family require that the dead be promptly informed, for example if one intends to move to a temporary fishing location, if one is moving into a newly built house or is launching a new canoe, if one is having a difficult birth or if a newborn is brought out of the house for the first time, if one is about to sit a school exam, if difficult words have been spoken which make people's heart heavy with anger, if the visiting anthropologist arrives or leaves, and so on. It is the responsibility of the senior head of the family to call the dead and talk to them, asking for their protection or their forgiveness, and ensuring that they are kept well informed of life's events ‚Äì for whenever the dead have reasons to be ‚Äúsurprised,\\" they will want to ask questions, thereby causing trouble for the living. The dead communicate with their living descendants through the dreams that they induce in them. This is because when a person dies, the breathing stops, the body becomes stiff, cold and soon begins to stink and to decompose. But when a person dies, the ‚Äòspirit‚Äô ‚Äì known as fanahy up to the moment of death ‚Äì permanently departs from the body. In its new disembodied, ghostly form, the spirit ‚Äì now known as angatse ‚Äì is invisible, and moves around like wind. To be seen by living people, it enters their dreams, where it appears together with its original uncorrupted body, just as it was when the person was alive. Language The Vezo speak a dialect of the Malagasy language, which is a branch of the Malayo-Polynesian language group derived from the Barito languages, spoken in southern Borneo. Economy Off the coast of Madagascar, overfishing has become a major issue. The Vezo rely entirely on fishing, who for the past 2,000 years have been navigating the stretch of the Indian Ocean that separates Madagascar from the African continent in hand-carved pirogues. Increasingly, commercial boats, mostly from Asia and Europe, are fishing those same waters. Thus, it is difficult for the traditional fishermen to compete in the market. In response, many Vezo have resorted to fishing hundreds of miles offshore, spending six to nine months a year in rough and dangerous waters in search of sharks and sea cucumbers, both in high demand in Asian seafood markets. Some bring their families and all their possessions and set up camp on sandbars far from civilization. Fishermen believe that the current fishing practices have to change by keeping successful skills, removing destructive fishing practices and adopting new fishing technologies. The lack of a system allowing local users to have a shared assessment of the fishing conditions and to define a common vision is the main problem for Vezo traditional fishers. They are so good at tracking the changes in fish catches over time and have a better understanding of the multiple uses of the available habitats but when it comes to pooling their knowledge into one system, they just can not make it by themselves. This shows that traditional ways of solving problems have failed to make its way to modern days. Traditional leaders used to play an important role in preserving wealth of the community by providing guidance to resource users according to the best available judgment. This role has been weakened by several factors including his social status.Challenging Vezo Traditional Fisheries Even worse, there is no significant improvement of household revenue in short term by setting up a marine reserve, it is hoped that the approach is likely to bring a much bigger impact on targeted fisheries in a mid and long term exploitation. From a biological point of view, a larger female octopus for example tends to lay many more eggs than young ones. By providing a few more months to grow in a closed fishing ground, it allows octopus individuals to get to bigger sizes. The Vezo have a long history of subsistence turtle exploitation and associated cultural traditions. By local law, turtles are protected under Decree 24 passed in 1923, but this law has seldom been enforced. The low reproductive potential and delayed sexual maturity of turtles make all species unsuitable for intensive harvest. Even as far back as the early twentieth century, it has been reported that turtles play an important role to Malagasy fisheries. There has been a decline in numbers of the hawksbill turtle and the disappearance of nesting populations. The raiding of the turtle nests and hunting for the meat and carapaces are believed to be the fundamental causes of decline for four of the five species in the region.http://ajol.info/index.php/wiojms/article/viewFile/28491/5169 A number of interventions are being undertaken to restore fish stocks and sustain the Vezo way of life. ReefDoctor is a key NGO in this effort and has an ongoing programme that aims to enhance fish biodiversity and biomass by the introduction of artificial habitats.ReefDoctor See also * Demographics of Madagascar * Andavadoaka Notes References       Bernard Koechlin, Les Vezo du Sud-Ouest de Madagascar.

A National Historic Landmark, it was a longtime summer residence of Jeannette Rankin (1880-1973), whose 1916 election to the United States House of Representatives made her the first woman elected to the House. Her legacy includes a penchant for pacifism, women's rights, and social reform. She served another term from 1941-1943 when she was the only member of the House to oppose the declaration of war against Japan in 1941. A small portion of the ranch was designated a National Historic Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1976. and Description and history The Rankin Ranch is located on the southwestern flank of the Big Belt Mountains, between Montana Highway 284 and Helena National Forest. The ranch consists of about of land, most of which is open prairie. The ranch complex is located on Avalanche Gulch Road, a county road providing access to the national forest, just southwest of the national forest boundary, and is screened by a number of trees. The main house is a modest single-story clapboarded frame structure. The front facade, facing roughly west, is set behind a recessed porch supported by fieldstone posts. The interior, of the house, and the accompanying ranch outbuildings, are not architecturally distinguished. The ranch house is believed to have been built in 1923 by Dan Flouree, the same year the initial parcel of the ranch was purchased by Wellington Rankin, brother of Jeanette Rankin. This ranch became the regular summer home for Jeanette from then until 1956. Of all of the places she lived, it is the place where she spent the most of her time during the height of her political influence. Elected in 1916 to the United States House of Representatives, she was the first woman elected to Congress. She was a strong pacificist, opposing American entry into both World War I and World War II; in 1941, she was the only member of Congress to oppose the war declaration after the December Attack on Pearl Harbor. She was a supporter of socially progressive legislation, working to secure women's suffrage. An area of surrounding the homestead was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1976, in recognition of Rankin's historic role.

Since 1892, Connie Maxwell Children‚Äôs Home has inspired thousands of children and families to dream of a brighter future while being cared for in a faith-filled, loving environment. With 5 locations across South Carolina, this ministry becomes a family to those who need it most, restoring hope through one of its core programs: Residential Care, Family Care, Foster Care, and Crisis Care. History: W.W. Keys formally stated the call for an orphanage to be operated by South Carolina Baptists in a Baptist Courier editorial in 1888. Three years later a site was secured for the new orphanage, now a children's home, and it would be located in Greenwood, primarily through the generosity of Dr. J.C. Maxwell and his wife, Sarah. The Maxwell's had lost their seven-year-old daughter, Connie, to scarlet fever in 1883. To honor her memory, the Maxwell's gave South Carolina Baptists more than and willed their estate to be used in starting this tender ministry for children. Twelve-year-old Susie Burton from Newberry County was the first child received into care on May 22, 1892. By year's end, 25 other boys and girls had joined Susie and Superintendent J.L. Vass in the new Baptist work. During the first years of operation most of the children were orphans. The major task of yesterday was to provide food, clothing, shelter, and Christian care. South Carolina Baptist Churches sponsored individual children at the rate of $6 per month. In the early years, each Connie Maxwell cottage had its own milk cow, garden, and poultry yard. The children also went to school in their cottages, attending four terms of 12 weeks each. Atha Thomas Jamison became Connie Maxwell's superintendent in 1900. Dr. Jamison saw early in his tenure that the new century brought changing needs for children. Already, Connie Maxwell was beginning to receive boys and girls who had at least one parent living but needed care because of some other family trauma. Connie Maxwell alumnus Dr. Sam Smith took over as superintendent in 1946. That same year, the name of the Connie Maxwell Orphanage was officially changed to Connie Maxwell Children's Home. The ensuing 30 years of the home's work under the leadership of Dr. Smith and Dr. John Murdoch saw individuals across South Carolina, particularly the lakelands, reaching out in many ways to the children. Many have given of themselves through such methods as Sunday School offerings, boxcars of produce, special sponsorships of children, gifts of canned goods and clothing, Christmas gifts and special work projects. To meet the increasingly complex problems of children and their families, Connie Maxwell Children's Home has continued to develop new programs with individualized services to support and strengthen family ties and to encourage family unity. Dr. Ed Johnson was the first African American social worker employed by Connie Maxwell Children's Home. Dr. Johnson, who also continued to serve his congregation at Morris Chapel Baptist Church in Greenwood, came to Connie Maxwell in 1972 and served for twenty years. Ed was instrumental in the collaborative efforts between Connie Maxwell, South Carolina Baptists and the Baptist Educational and Missionary Convention in meeting the needs of all families. Johnson served from 1991-1996 as President of the Educational and Missionary Convention of South Carolina. Under the leadership of Dr. Heyward Prince, who began his time as president in 1977, Connie Maxwell added crisis homes in Florence and Greenwood to provide warm and compassionate care for children in need of immediate help‚Äîabandoned or abused children, runaways, or children whose families have suddenly broken apart. A satellite campus in Greenville was established for those children needing intensive community experiences. In Summerville, a Connie Maxwell social worker was placed to provide counseling services to families in the Lowcountry, and another Connie Maxwell social worker was assigned to help low-income families devastated by Hurricane Hugo during that terrible time. Dr. Joe Weber served a brief period as president after Dr. Prince. The home base for Connie Maxwell's statewide work continues to be the main campus in Greenwood where 96 children in grades one through twelve live in a family-style setting of cottages. The children attend public schools and are encouraged to participate in extra-curricular school activities. Another 8 children are in the emergency shelter in Greenwood, and a total of 34 more are at the four satellite campuses around the state. Some children in care as well as others from throughout the Greenwood area in the 1990s participated in a re-education effort at Connie Maxwell, a special campus school program for seventh and eighth grade students identified by their guidance counselors as being at risk of not finishing school. Also, through Connie Maxwell's Adventure-Based Counseling program, physical and mental challenges in an outdoor setting are used to build group communication and problem-solving skills as well as individual confidence. Many organizations, schools and businesses have used the course. The challenges and opportunities continue to be great, but Connie Maxwell Children's Home looks forward to them with faith, hope, commitment, and confidence. Dr. Jimmy McAdams came to Connie Maxwell as president in the spring of 1993 and led in the acquisition of the Brookland Plantation Home for Boys established originally on Edisto Island in 1958 that moved to Orangeburg in 1968. It serves as a home for boys and girls, and is known as Connie Maxwell's Brookland Campus. Sixteen boys and girls live in two family style cottages on of land. To enhance the work of the family service program, the Neb Cline Family Service Center was opened on the main campus. Here, children visit with a caring individual who works with the child and family to set goals to meet their needs. OASIS was created on the farm at Connie Maxwell to develop confidence in children in a natural surrounding. Many school groups have visited the educational program offered there. Efforts were also begun on a third crisis shelter care facility that saw its completion in 2004 in Chesterfield under the current president, Dr. Ben Davis, who took the leadership position in 2002, after 9 years as business and development vice president. In more recent years, Connie Maxwell Children's Home has welcomed thousands of guests to the main campus in Greenwood for \\"A Connie Maxwell Christmas.\\" In just a few years this annual event has become a family tradition for many residents of the lakelands. This Christmas occasion is a way for the children and staff of Connie Maxwell to say thank you for the much-needed support received from caring individuals, businesses, organizations and churches. The continuing mission of Connie Maxwell is to help children develop and strengthen in a Christian environment, while looking for new ways to assist families who are hurting.

In 1989, he and his business partner Bertram Lee were the first African-Americans to buy a controlling interest in a National Basketball Association (NBA) team, when they purchased a 37.5% share of the Denver Nuggets basketball team, and he is among the most influential minority figures in sports law and management. Bynoe kept the Chicago White Sox from leaving Chicago by developing a New Comiskey Park (now known as U.S. Cellular Field). He has become a negotiator for professional sports teams' venues. In addition, he was involved in the development of the 1996 and 2012 Summer Olympics. Bynoe serves on several boards of directors. Personal background Born in Boston, Massachusetts, Bynoe came from a well-respected family. His father Victor C. Bynoe, had emigrated from his native Barbados at age 13, and after graduating from Northeastern University with degrees in Civil Engineering and Law, became a successful attorney. (At one point, he represented Boston Celtics star Bill Russell.) At a time when few blacks were being promoted to important positions in government, Victor Bynoe was named to Boston Mayor John B. Hynes' cabinet in 1950, serving on the Street Commission. He later became commissioner of Veterans' Services in Boston, and served on the board of the Boston Housing Authority. Peter's mother Ethel was American; she was praised by the black newspapers for her community involvement and volunteerism. Peter also had an uncle John Bynoe, who was active in the fight for civil rights, serving as the regional civil rights director for the United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare. Bynoe attended William Lloyd Garrison Elementary School, and graduated from Boston Latin School in 1968. He credited his parents with instilling high standards and expecting him to achieve in school. He also had a love of sports, growing up as a regular Boston Celtics and Boston Red Sox fan; but although both teams had black players, racial relations in Boston at that time were still tense, and black fans like Bynoe were hesitant to attend the games. Bynoe's entire post-secondary education was at Harvard University in Cambridge, Massachusetts. He obtained his bachelor's degree cum laude at Harvard College in 1972. He then received his master's degree, an M.B.A. in 1976, with an emphasis on finance and marketing, from Harvard Business School. His Juris Doctor from Harvard Law School had a focus on corporate planning and regulation. In addition to being admitted to the practice of law before the Illinois State Bar, Bynoe is a licensed real estate broker in Illinois. In late November 1987, he married Linda Jean Walker, who was then vice-president of the fixed-income division of Morgan Stanley in New York. Business career Bynoe oversaw the development of U.S. Cellular Field to keep the Chicago White Sox from leaving Chicago. Bynoe began his professional career in 1976 at Citibank. After deciding he didn't like working for a large corporation, he left New York and moved to Chicago in 1977. He was hired by James Lowry, a management consultant whom he had met at Harvard. While with Lowry's firm, Bynoe made a name for himself as someone who could break down racial barriers and get diverse groups to work together. He also became known for his work in minority business development. By 1982, Bynoe passed the Illinois bar examination. He left Lowry and Associates in 1982, at which time he founded and managed Telemat Ltd., a business consulting firm. His career path changed in 1987 when Harold Washington, whose election campaign he had worked for and contributed to, called Bynoe to inform him that the Chicago White Sox were threatening to leave Chicago.Picher, Keith, Leading Lawyers Network, \\"Peter Bynoe: When It Comes to Sports Stadiums, He Takes The Ball And Runs With It,\\" September 2007 From January 1988 to June 1992, Bynoe served as the Executive Director of the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, a joint venture of the City of Chicago and State of Illinois, which gave him complete supervisory, planning and executing responsibility for the $250 million construction of New Comiskey Park for the Chicago White Sox, which was completed as scheduled and well within its budget. He also became known in Chicago for his business relationships with such influential sports stars as Michael Jordan, a former client with whom he remained friends. In November 1989, Bynoe and Bertram Lee purchased the Denver Nuggets. Lee and Bynoe had worked together in Boston years earlier, and Bynoe thought of Lee as a mentor. They had kept in touch, and were involved in several real estate dealings together. But the Nuggets deal was problematic from the start. In fact, it almost fell through because Lee did not have the resources everyone, Bynoe among them, thought he had. Media reports depicted Lee as a wealthy and successful businessman who was a financier with offices in two cities, and formerly part owner of Boston's WNEV-TV. But Lee and Bynoe were unable to meet the deadline to purchase the team from then-owner Sidney Shlenker. It would later be revealed that Lee had problems raising the needed capital. It was Bynoe, with the assistance of David Stern, Jay Pritzker, and Jerrold Wexler, who salvaged the transaction over the course of six months. The mainstream media reported that Lee and Bynoe were now the first two blacks to own a major sports team, but several of the black newspapers pointed out that the two men were actually managing general partners rather than owners, because the revised agreement to purchase the team meant they owned only a 37.5% stake in the team. Bynoe sold his interest in the franchise in August 1992. Communications Satellite Corporation's (COMSAT) Video Enterprises subsidiary put up 62.5% of the $65 million needed to purchase the Nuggets. Bynoe was hired in 2008 by Chicago-based Loop Capital Markets LLC. Bynoe serves as Managing Director of Corporate Finance. In August 2013, Bynoe left his executive role at Loop Capital Markets LLC to become CEO of Rewards Network, a company controlled by investor Sam Zell that offers loyalty programs for restaurants. Other achievements Bynoe consulted on the development of Centennial Olympic Stadium, which eventually was converted into Turner Field, shown here. Bynoe served as a consultant to the Atlanta-Fulton County Recreation Authority and the Atlanta Committee to Organize the Olympic Games to plan the 85,000 seat Centennial Olympic Stadium within a $210 million construction budget. The stadium has been converted to the 45,000 seat Turner Field baseball stadium for the Atlanta Braves who use it under a lease agreement Bynoe negotiated. Bynoe became a partner at DLA Piper Rudnick Gray Cary LLP (US) in 1995 when he joined the firm and remains a member of the firm's Executive Committee. Bynoe as head of DLA Piper's Sports Facilities Practice Group negotiated new facilities for the Cincinnati Reds and Bengals, Miami Heat, Washington Redskins, Milwaukee Brewers, and Columbus Blue Jackets. He specialized in infrastructure projects and represented institutional clients such as: The Boeing Company, Sara Lee Corporation, Essence Communications, and CNA Insurance. Bynoe also was involved in the 2012 Summer Olympics, and was a backer of Barack Obama. In addition, Bynoe is a Director of Frontier Communications Corporation , Covanta Holding Company www.covantaenergy.com and Signature Group Holdings, Inc. . He is a Trustee of the Goodman Theatre, the Rush University Medical Center and The CORE Center for the Research and Cure of Infectious Diseases. He formerly served as Chairman of the Chicago Plan Commission Chicago Plan Commission, the Chicago Landmarks Commission Chicago Commission Landmarks, and the Illinois Sports Facilities Authority, and was a director of Jacor Communications and Blue Chip Broadcasting. Bynoe has been a director of Covanta since 2004. In 2007, Bynoe was announced as a director for Citizens Communications (which later changed its name to Frontier Communications). In the past, Bynoe has been a member of the Harvard Board of Overseers. He has also served as a director for Uniroyal Technology Corporation, Jacor Communications (acquired by Clear Channel Communications), J&G; Industries, Huffman-Koos, Inc., the River Valley Savings Bank, and Blue Chip Broadcasting (acquired by Radio One, Inc).

It was adapted by Jane Murfin from \\"The Viennese Charmer\\", a short story by William Carey Wonderly. While it was the first film made by RKO Radio Pictures, its opening was delayed until after Syncopation, making it RKO's second release. It was very successful at the box office, accounting for almost half of RKO's profits for the entire year. Plot The Four Seasons are a very good jazz quartet, but they perform in a New York City cafe for only $100 a week, forcing them to share a small, rundown apartment. The quartet consists of Joe Spring on clarinet, Pete Summer on accordion and guitar, Mike Fall on piano and trumpet, and an ever-pessimistic Happy Winter on violin. On his way home one night, Mike drives off a man accosting a young blonde named Frederika Joyzelle. When she tells him she has not eaten in two days, he persuades her to share the group's dinner. She tells them that back in her homeland, she was a violinist. The highlight of her career given a command performance for her homeland's ruler, Prince Nicholaus of Aregon. Mike convinces his bandmates to allow \\"Freddie\\" to room with them for two weeks, after they discover she has no place to go. Freddie talks the band into asking for a raise to $200, but when they are turned down, they impulsively quit. Mike is further discouraged when they return to the apartment to find Freddie gone. However, Freddie soon returns with great news. She has spent all day trying to convince Keppel, the owner of the well-known Little Aregon Cafe, to give the quartet a tryout. She finally succeeded, and at a salary of $300 a week. She gets a job there too, as a cigarette girl and part-time violinist. As time goes on, Mike falls in love with Freddie, but is unsure how she feels about him. Prince Nicholaus of Aregon is in town, trying to arrange financing for his country. He and his entourage go to the cafe, much to Keppel's delight. When Freddie performs for him, he remembers her and kisses her on the forehead. The newspaper coverage of the kiss causes the cafe to skyrocket in popularity overnight. When a competitor of Keppel's asks the group to perform at his establishment, Keppel wins a bidding war by raising their wages to $3000 a week. This enables them to move into a much fancier apartment. However, the kiss also causes Mike to become jealous to the point of quitting the band. The popularity of Keppel's cafe allows him to move into the larger \\"Club Joyzelle\\". With the help of Prince Nicholaus, Freddie and Mike are reunited in time for the grand opening. Even Happy, who is anything but, smiles as a result.

The expedition stopped from September 9 to September 11, 1805, before crossing the Bitterroot Mountains, and again on the return trip from June 30 to July 3, 1806. Traveler's Rest is at the eastern end of the Lolo Trail. It was declared a National Historic Landmark in 1960 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. and The boundaries were subsequently revised, and mostly lie within the Traveler's Rest State Park, which is operated by the Montana Fish, Wildlife & Parks. Significant archeological findings made in 2002, including latrine sites with traces of mercury and fire hearths, make this the only site on the Lewis and Clark National Historic Trail that has yielded physical proof of the explorers' presence. Records made by Lewis and Clark often spell \\"Traveler's\\" as \\"Traveller's\\". This spot is largely unchanged from the days of Lewis and Clark. From this location, Lewis and Clark split up to explore Montana during their return trip, not reuniting until they reached Sanish, North Dakota. At the time of landmark designation in 1960, the exact location of the expedition's campsite was unknown. Boundaries were formalized on December 12, 1983. Subsequent investigations revealed that errors had been made in setting the boundaries of the landmark. Detailed historical and scientific investigations resulted in a 55-page request for boundary corrections, submitted on May 10, 2004, and approved on March 21, 2006. A new road and bridge were built in 2006. After departing here in 1806, Lewis' part of the expedition traveled to what is now the Alice Creek Historic District.

It was built in the early 1950s by the DLF Group, then known as Delhi Land and Finance, and is one of the first privately developed neighborhoods in Delhi. Model Town is a large area and divided into blocks and sub-colonies. It is one of the three administrative divisions of the North Delhi district, along with Alipur and Narela. Accessibility Model Town is well connected by the Ring Road, and there is now access to the Outer Ring Road as well. 2 Metro Stations (Model Town and Azad Pur) are within easy reach. Model Town is relatively centrally located, not more than 8 km from the city centre. Nearby areas include Azadpur, Derawal Nagar, Mahendru Enclave, Civil Lines, Kingsway Camp, Kamla Nagar, DR. Mukherji Nagar, Shalimar Bagh, Timarpur, Hudson Lines, Gujranwala Town and the University of Delhi's north campus. Neighbourhood The Imperial Town Planning Movement gave birth to New Delhi, Model Town and Civil Lines, advocating low-rise orderly development, with large plot sizes and single-storey buildings, with a maximum ground coverage of as little as 25 % of the entire plot area. Model Town is divided into 3 sub-colonies ; Model Town - I, Model Town - II & Model Town - III. Landmarks Alpana Cinema (now closed) is situated near Model Town I Crossing which was not only one of the reputed Cinema Halls of Delhi but also a well-known landmark of the area. Chhatrasal Stadium is also situated opposite Model Town III in the area and was used for soccer matches during the Asian Games, held in Delhi, India in the 80s. Model Town is connected by the Delhi Metro on the Vishwavidyalaya route and has one stop Model Town metro station. Its actual postal address is only Model Town 110009, however as it has 3 bus stops on the main road people use too often refer to the location of the stop as a reference landmark (e.g. near Model Town 1st stop) which is now often referred as Model Town 1 or 2 or 3. Model Town 1 has a lake called Naini Lake in the middle of the locality with a boating facility and has a walking path around the lake for morning and evening walkers. This lake is maintained by the Delhi Tourism. The Grand Trunk Road (originally built under the reign of Sher Shah Suri) is close to Model Town, and the historic Gurdwara Nanak Piao is located on this road. This Gurdwara Sahib is dedicated to the first Sikh Guru, Sri Guru Nanak Dev. The word \\"Piao\\" means to \\"offer liquid to drink\\" and refers to the offering of water to all the thirsty who visited this shrine. The foundation of the new capital of British India, New Delhi, was laid at the nearby Coronation Park by King George V in December, 1911, making this area historically significant.

Today they are mainly of historical relevance because every Post canonical system can be reduced to a string rewriting system (semi-Thue system), which is a simpler formulation. Both formalisms are Turing complete.  Definition  A Post canonical system is a triplet (A,I,R), where * A is a finite alphabet, and finite (possibly empty) strings on A are called words. * I is a finite set of initial words. * R is a finite set of string-transforming rules (called production rules), each rule being of the following form: : \\\\overset{ \\\\begin{matrix} g_{10} & \\\\$_{11} & g_{11} & \\\\$_{12} & g_{12} & \\\\dots & \\\\$_{1m_1} & g_{1m_1} \\\\\\\\\\\\ g_{20} & \\\\$_{21} & g_{21} & \\\\$_{22} & g_{22} & \\\\dots & \\\\$_{2m_2} & g_{2m_2} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots & \\\\ddots & \\\\vdots & \\\\vdots \\\\\\\\\\\\ g_{k0} & \\\\$_{k1} & g_{k1} & \\\\$_{k2} & g_{k2} & \\\\dots & \\\\$_{km_k} & g_{km_k} \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{matrix} } { \\\\underset{ \\\\begin{matrix} h_0 & \\\\$'_1 & h_1 & \\\\$'_2 & h_2 & \\\\dots & \\\\$'_n & h_n \\\\\\\\\\\\ \\\\end{matrix} } { \\\\downarrow } } where each and is a specified _fixed_ word, and each $ and $' is a _variable_ standing for an arbitrary word. The strings before and after the arrow in a production rule are called the rule's antecedents and consequent, respectively. It is required that each $' in the consequent be one of the $s in the antecedents of that rule, and that each antecedent and consequent contain at least one variable. In many contexts, each production rule has only one antecedent, thus taking the simpler form : g_0 \\\\ \\\\$_1 \\\\ g_1 \\\\ \\\\$_2 \\\\ g_2 \\\\ \\\\dots \\\\ \\\\$_m \\\\ g_m \\\\ \\\\rightarrow \\\\ h_0 \\\\ \\\\$'_1 \\\\ h_1 \\\\ \\\\$'_2 \\\\ h_2 \\\\ \\\\dots \\\\ \\\\$'_n \\\\ h_n The formal language generated by a Post canonical system is the set whose elements are the initial words together with all words obtainable from them by repeated application of the production rules. Such sets are recursively enumerable languages and every recursively enumerable language is the restriction of some such set to a sub-alphabet of A. = Example (well-formed bracket expressions) = Alphabet: {[, ]} Initial word: [] Production rules: (1) $ -> [$] (2) $ -> $$ (3) $1$2 -> $1[]$2 Derivation of a few words in the language of well-formed bracket expressions: [] initial word [][] by (2) [ by (1) by (2) ][ by (3) ... Normal-form theorem A Post canonical system is said to be in normal form if it has only one initial word and every production rule is of the simple form : g\\\\$ \\\\ \\\\rightarrow \\\\ \\\\$h Post 1943 proved the remarkable Normal-form Theorem, which applies to the most-general type of Post canonical system: :Given any Post canonical system on an alphabet A, a Post canonical system in normal form can be constructed from it, possibly enlarging the alphabet, such that the set of words involving only letters of A that are generated by the normal-form system is exactly the set of words generated by the original system. Tag systems, which comprise a universal computational model, are notable examples of Post normal-form system, being also monogenic. (A canonical system is said to be monogenic if, given any string, at most one new string can be produced from it in one step -- i.e., the system is deterministic.) String rewriting systems, type-0 formal grammars A string rewriting system is a special type of Post canonical system with a single initial word, and the productions are each of the form : P_1 g P_2 \\\\ \\\\rightarrow \\\\ P_1 h P_2 That is, each production rule is a simple substitution rule, often written in the form g -> h. It has been proved that any Post canonical system is reducible to such a substitution system, which, as a formal grammar, is also called a phrase-structure grammar, or a type-0 grammar in the Chomsky hierarchy.

Flight 433 was a routine scheduled flight from Amsterdam, the Netherlands, to Cardiff, Wales. Accident The aircraft took off from Runway 24 at Schiphol Airport at 2:19 pm local time, with the captain as the pilot flying. At 2:30, the pilots received a false warning of low oil pressure in the right engine, caused by a short circuit. While the first officer consulted the emergency checklist, the captain unilaterally set the right engine's power to idle, probably to reduce the risk of damage. However, the oil pressure gauge was still showing above 30 PSI, indicating that oil pressure was within safe limits and the warning was false. The checklist recommended continuing normal flight operations under the circumstances. However, the captain did not return the engine to the previous throttle setting, leaving the aircraft effectively flying on one engine. As the Saab approached flight level 170 (17,000 feet), the loss of power degraded the aircraft's climb performance. The crew misinterpreted this, and decreasing oil pressure from the retarding right engine, as confirmation that the engine was faulty. A Pan-Pan call was made at 2:33, requesting to return to Schiphol. The captain had not anticipated the consequences of flying with one engine at idle, and was unable to stabilize the final approach onto Runway 06; the situation was aggravated by an 8 knot tailwind. He also disengaged the autopilot, while the first officer neutralized the rudder trim, both of which had been compensating for the asymmetric thrust. During this time the aircraft fell below the glideslope and airspeed decreased to 115 knots, below the target approach speed of 125 knots. In response, the captain increased torque on the left engine, causing the aircraft to veer to the right of the runway. The crew did not apply additional rudder deflection to correct it, instead relying on the ailerons. At a height of 45 feet, the captain decided to perform a go-around, and commanded full throttle to the left engine, while leaving right engine at idle. The crew continued to only use the ailerons to counteract the thrust imbalance. The aircraft rolled to the right and pitched up, while airspeed decayed to 105 knots, activating the stall warning. Some rudder deflection was applied afterwards, and full deflection was applied 8 seconds later, but the aircraft was unrecoverable as airspeed decreased to 93 knots and the right bank increased to 80 degrees. At 2:46, the aircraft crashed in a field just outside the airport, 560 meters from the runway. Of the 24 people on board, 3 were killed - the captain and 2 passengers. Out of the 21 survivors, 9 suffered serious injuries, including the first officer. Due to amnesia caused by the crash, the first officer could not recall the accident. Aircraft and crew The aircraft involved was a Saab 340, registration PH-KSH, which had first flown in 1990. The aircraft was powered by two General Electric CT7-9B turboshaft engines and had flown 6,558 hours at the time of the accident. The captain, 37-year-old Gerrit Lievaart, had been with KLM Cityhopper since 2 March 1992. He had a total of 2,605 hours flying time, including 1,214 hours on a Saab 340. However, training records revealed that he had failed two engine-out checks, and on his most recent one had been given a ‚Äústandard minus,‚Äù the lowest passing grade. The first officer, 34-year old Paul Stassen, had been with KLM Cityhopper since 27 January 1992. He had a total of 1,718 hours flying time, including 1,334 hours on a Saab 340. Accident investigation KLM Cityhopper Flight 433 seating chart based on the NASB report, revealing locations of passengers, severity of injuries, and deaths The final report from the Netherlands Aviation Safety Board found that pilot error, through inadequate use of flight controls during unequal throttle go-around, resulting in loss of control, was the primary cause of the accident. In addition, the report included recommendations directed at KLM, regarding contributing factors, addressing: improved training on Crew Resource Management; improved pilot assessment techniques; and improved guidance on flying with an idle engine. In addition, the report found that the crash was generally survivable, with the Captain's death attributable to not wearing his shoulder restraints. In popular culture The crash of KLM Cityhopper Flight 433 was covered in 2019 in \\"Fatal Approach\\", a Season 19 episode of the internationally syndicated Canadian TV documentary series Mayday.

History The study of rhenium hydrides can be traced to the 1950s and included reports of the \\"rhenide\\" anion, supposedly Re‚àí. These reports led to a series of investigations by A. P. Ginsberg and coworkers on the products from the reduction of perrhenate. The rhenide anion, Re‚àí, was based on the product of the reduction of perrhenate salts, such as the reduction of potassium perrhenate () by potassium metal. \\"Potassium rhenide\\" was shown to exist as a tetrahydrated complex, with the postulated chemical formula . This compound exhibits strongly reducing properties, and slowly yields hydrogen gas when dissolved in water. The lithium and thallous salts were also reported. Later research, however, indicates that the \\"rhenide\\" ion is actually a hydridorhenate complex. \\"Potassium rhenide\\" was shown to be in fact the nonahydridorhenate, , containing the anion in which the oxidation state of rhenium is actually +7. Other methods of reduction of perrhenate salts yield compounds containing other hydrido- complexes, including . Structure, synthesis, and properties Structure of the anion, a tricapped trigonal prism. is an unusual example of a nonacoordinated complex, its high coordination number being attributed to the small size of the hydride ligand and the high positive charge on the Re(VII) center. Its structure consists of a tricapped trigonal prism,Holleman, A. F.; Wiberg, E. \\"Inorganic Chemistry\\" Academic Press: San Diego, 2001. .Housecroft, C.E. and Sharpe A.G. \\"Inorganic Chemistry\\" (2nd edn, Pearson 2005. ), p.254 as determined by neutron crystallography. The diamagnetic sodium salt, like the analogous technetium compound, is prepared by treating an ethanol solution of sodium perrhenate, NaReO4, with sodium metal. Via cation exchange, it can be converted to the corresponding tetraethylammonium salt, (N(C2H5)4)2ReH9. Isostructural with , consists of a trigonal prism with Re atom in the center and six hydrogen atoms at the corners. Three more hydrogen ligands define a triangle lying parallel to the base and crossing the prism in its center (see figure). Although those hydride ligands are not equivalent, their electronic structure is almost the same. The coordination number of 9 in this complex is the highest known for any rhenium complex.

Education and career Scott graduated from Kenyon College in 1983 with a BA in economics. After early jobs as a clerk on several Wall Street bond trading desks, he worked in the online news and information business from 1985 to 2002, holding executive positions in an electronic information division of Knight-Ridder, from 1989 to 1995. Scott moved to the Boston area in 1995 and joined Desktop Data, which became NewsEdge Corporation, ultimately holding the position of vice president of marketing until the business was sold to Thomson Corporation in 2002. At NewsEdge he and his team found that do-it-yourself programs based on creating useful content and publishing it on-line at virtually no cost consistently generated more interest from qualified buyers than expensive profession public relations programs, especially if the content was \\"ungated\\" (freely available without even requiring the reader supply personal information like an email address). Thomson Corporation terminated his employment after acquiring NewsEdge, so he started his own business as a marketing strategist. Content marketing strategist  Scott's assertion is that marketing and public relations is vastly different on the Web than in mainstream media. He says that the old rules of mainstream media are about controlling a message and getting the message into the public domain is to buying expensive advertising or begging the media to write about you. He says that the rules of marketing and PR on the Web are completely different. Instead of buying or begging your way in, Scott says anybody can earn attention by \\"publishing their way in\\" using the tools of social media such as, blogs, podcasts, online news releases, online video, viral marketing, and online media. He believes that, with few exceptions, marketers gain the best return on their investment in content creation when they choose \\"ungated\\" publication. Writing for Forbes, Nick Morgan notes that \\"David is one of those select few people who saw and understood the social media phenomenon as it began...\\" = Books = Scott is the author of several books, as detailed below. The New Rules of Marketing and PR Scott initially released the book as a free, ungated e-book. It was subsequently published as a traditional printed book. Scott summarizes the book's content marketing theme as \\"You are what you publish online.\\" The content should be about what audience cares about, not directly about the product itself. \\"Nobody cares about your product but you,\\" Scott says. Writing for The New York Times Magazine, Virginia Heffernan recommended the book \\"For practical P.R. in the age of Twitter,...\\" In an interview on Marketing Update, Scott stated that besides the fast pace of change in marketing, another motivation for the new edition was that the book had been incorporated into the curriculum of many universities. As a result, he plans to publish a new edition in summer every other year. The second edition won praise in The New York Times and Computerworld reviews. The first edition was featured in the BusinessWeek Best Seller List. John P. David describes the book as being the preeminent text on public relations. Scott believes that the ideas in the book apply not only in commerce but also political campaigning, referencing in particular the 2016 US Presidential campaign of Donald Trump. They can even be used to humanize otherwise faceless government organizations like the CIA. Newsjacking Writing about Newsjacking;How to inject your ideas into a breaking news story and generate tons of media coverage for Forbes Magazine, Nick Morgan notes that Scott and his publisher, Wiley, \\"point the way forward\\" by publishing this book only in electronic formats. He describes [newsjacking] as the art and science of injecting your ideas into a breaking news. Kristi Hedges, also writing for Forbes, observes that Scott 'answers [the question] \\"Should I be on Twitter?\\" once and for all', citing its instantaneous nature and widespread use by journalists. Writing for Fast Company, Wendy Marx cautions those who might be tempted to take the idea too far, \\"Don't ... spam reporters ... That will only backfire\\". Tracey Boudine criticizes the term because it is a mashup of news and hijack and thus \\"implies you‚Äôre doing something you‚Äôre not supposed to\\" and goes on to say there is no need for a buzzword and that PR professions should use the criterion \\"Does this elevate?\\" The word was added to the Oxford English Dictionary in 2017 (\\"the practice of taking advantage of current events or news stories in such a way as to promote or advertise one's product or brand\\") and appeared as one of the eight neologisms on their Word of the Year shortlist.

Real-Time Marketing and PR Real-Time Marketing and PR:How to Instantly Engage Your Market, Connect With Your Customers, and Create Products that Grow Your Business Now draws on Scott's earlier career as an up-to-the-second Wall Street trader, this book highlights how the timely creation of heart felt content can be more important than polished pieces with their long lead times. Examples include the Dave Carroll United Breaks Guitars phenomenon. Writing in BtoB Magazine, Christopher Hosford quotes Scott as saying, \\"The idea of real- time communication ... is the most interesting thing going on in b2b marketing right now\\". Marketing Lessons from the Grateful Dead Scott (left) with co-author Brian Halligan on the Marketing Lessons... book tour. The background photomontage includes Jerry Garcia, founder of The Grateful Dead Marketing Lessons from the Grateful Dead: What Every Business Can Learn from the Most Iconic Band in History was coauthored with Brian Halligan, CEO of HubSpot. Scott Kirsner, reviewing the book in the Boston Globe, mentions that the authors say they were inspired in part by an article in the Atlantic by Joshua Green. Rather than record sales, the band generated the majority of its revenues from live performances and associated merchandise sales. While most bands tried to prevent bootleg recordings, The Grateful Dead actually encouraged fans to record their concerts and share them with their network, building a passionate community of fans called ‚ÄòDeadheads.‚Äô Marketing the Moon Reviewing Marketing the Moon:The Selling of the Apollo Lunar Program for The Boston Globe, Carolyn Y. Johnson writes that the book documents NASA's success in placing the Apollo mission at front-of-mind of ordinary people and The Wall Street Journal found the \\"decadelong surge of public interest in all things lunar\\" remarkable. Reviewing the book for The New Yorker magazine, Joshua Rothman contrasts the usual \\"derring-do\\" presentation of the Apollo program by observing: \\"Scott and Jurek see it as ... an attempt to convince America, and the world, of its own competence, intelligence, and courage.\\" In an essay based on the coverage of astronaut celebrity in their book, Scott and Jurek link it to that of aviation predecessors such as Charles Lindbergh. A particularly important facet of the Apollo mission was live television broadcast of the landing. Scott calls this \\"one of the best decisions ever made.\\" Besides NASA's own PR tem, many of the Apollo subcontractors invested in innovative press kits. The authors critique NASA for assuming that initial levels of public interest would remain high, and not developing a long-term strategy to maintain public engagement and support. The book's foreword is by Captain Eugene Cernan, the twelfth and (so far) last man to walk on the moon. Scott and co-author Richard Jurek were consulting producers on the documentary film American Experience: Chasing The Moon by Robert Stone, which was based on the book and which aired on PBS in July 2019 for the 50th anniversary of Apollo 11. The New Rules of Sales and Service Dan Schawbel interviewed the author about The New Rules of Sales and Service: How to Use Agile Selling, Real-Time Customer Engagement, Big Data, Content, and Storytelling to Grow Your Business for Forbes magazine and notes that instant communications wasn't instant, ease of researching products online, and ease of voicing a complaint about poor service have led to these new rules. Scott published a free summary of the main points of the book on SlideShare.SlideShare: The New Rules of Selling Fanocracy: Turning Fans into Customers and Customers into Fans In January 2020, Scott published Fanocracy: Turning Fans into Customers and Customers into Fans co-authored with his daughter, Reiko Scott. It explains how to benefit from the trend where savvy companies and non-profits attract not just customers but fans who indirectly promote the product better than direct marketing from the company itself can. It was listed on the Wall Street Journal Best Selling Books list in the Hardcover Business category and on Publishers Weekly This Week's Bestsellers list.

It lies near the junction of Oregon Route 138 and Oregon Route 230 in the Umpqua National Forest in Douglas County. It is located between Mount Bailey to the west and Mount Thielsen to the east; it is just north of Crater Lake National Park. The outlet of the lake is at its north end. From there, water flows via Lake Creek into the North Umpqua River and ultimately to the Pacific Ocean.U.S. Geological Survey topographic maps Diamond Lake was named for John Diamond, for whom Diamond Peak is also named. He saw the lake in 1852 while on the summit of Diamond Peak. Diamond was a pioneer settler of Coburg, Oregon, and part of a party opening a road between the Middle Fork Willamette River and Idaho as an immigration route. An adjacent post office named Diamond Lake, Oregon, was established in 1925 and ran until 1956, when it was changed to a summer-only office. Diamond Lake is the host for the 2019 and the 2020 Major League Fishing Championship. They submitted a bid to host the 2021 Major League Fishing Championship. Diamond Lake is the host for the Tour de Diamond, a cycling event that happens every summer. It is the longest race in the World Cycling Association. Fish Although rainbow trout are not native to Diamond Lake because the lake lacks the required spawning habitat, large populations of aquatic insects make it ideal for fish. After treating the lake to remove rough fish in 1954, the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife (ODFW) stocked the lake with a Canadian strain of rainbow trout and later added local strains in about 1970. Stocked trout grew rapidly in the lake, and before other species began competing successfully with trout, anglers caught rainbows regularly, and the average catch weighed more than . However, in 1992 a non- native species, tui chub, was detected in the lake. These fish, illegally introduced to the lake, quickly multiplied and negatively affected the sport fishery. The water became murky, the insect population dropped dramatically, and the trout population declined. To eliminate the unwanted fish, the ODFW poisoned Diamond Lake with rotenone in 2006. This killed 95 million tui chub, and the lake became free of them. By 2007 dramatic improvements were noted in water clarity, insect populations, and the trout catch. The ODFW has captured golden shiners, another invasive species of bait fish illegally introduced to the lake. Although shiners are less successful than tui chubs at multiplying in Diamond Lake, the ODFW works to remove them and to discourage more from being added. In January 2016, Oregon revealed their plan to release up to 25,000 fish-eating tiger trout into the lake after the appearance of a single tui chub in an effort to prevent it from, once again, harming the lake. The tui chub found in October was 4 years old which means that it was not there for the 2006 elimination. Scientist are unsure of the origins of the single tui chub. Recreation Map of region surrounding Diamond Lake Anglers often fish by boat near Silent Creek on the south and in deep water on the north. There are five boat ramps around the lake, all of which have paved access. The speed limit on the lake is . Bank fishing is productive at points along the lake trails, near Diamond Lake Resort, near Lake Creek, and near the United States Forest Service campgrounds. The lake is generally open for fishing from late April through late October. Trails connect Diamond Lake to the summits of Mount Bailey and Mount Thielsen, and the Pacific Crest Trail and Crater Lake are also nearby. One of the lake trails is a partially paved bike path long. Wildlife viewing and birdwatching in the area are common activities. The Joseph H. Stewart State Recreation Area is the closest state park to Diamond Lake. The Forest Service operates four campgrounds near Diamond Lake. They are Diamond Lake Campground, with 240 campsites along the east side of the lake; Broken Arrow Campground, with 148 sites at the lake's south end; Thielsen View Campground, with 58 sites along the west shore, and the South Shore Area, with five sites. Campground features include picnic tables, restrooms, showers, and garbage bins; some have hookups for recreational vehicles. The South Shore Picnic Area has a playground, volleyball court, horseshoe pits, and a swimming beach, in addition to picnic accommodations. Swimming, horseback riding, and hunting are popular at Diamond Lake in summer and fall. Winter sports include snowmobiling, Nordic and Alpine skiing, inner tubing and sled dog racing. Diamond Lake Resort on the east side of the lake offers lodging, restaurants, stores, boat rentals, horse rentals, and other services. In popular culture The lake is central to the plot of Grimm, season 5 episode 8, which features a fictitious 'Diamond Lake Monster'.

It is part of the wider labor movement in Taiwan, and advocates for labor reforms and the redistribution of social resources. The party also supports the reunification of Taiwan with mainland China, with a high level of autonomy reserved for Taiwan under the \\"one country, two systems\\" principle. Party members often assist in unionizing workers and regularly hold protests against the government's labor policies, as well as perceived imperialism from the United States and Japan. Notable labor demonstrations that the Labor Party helped organize include the , and 2009 labor dispute against TSMC.  History  , one of the founders of the Labor Party. The Labor Party was founded on 29 March 1989 by unionized workers of the Far East Synthetic Fiber Company. The trade union had been protesting the company's mass layoffs and refusal to increase workers' wages; the protests culminated in the a month later. When establishing the party, the union leadership considered adopting the name \\"Taiwanese Communist Party\\", but elected not to do so due to the widespread anti-communism in Taiwan at the time. In the years following its founding, the Labor Party grew in size and influence, with its membership consisting mainly of former political prisoners of the White Terror, labor movement organizers and the working class. The party, however, did not see electoral success until the 2009 local elections, when Labor Party candidate Kao Wei-kai was elected to the Hsinchu County Council. After Kao was elected, a majority of his monthly salary (NT$80,000) was put back into the party's treasury to fund future political activities. In the 2018 local elections, Kao was reelected to the Hsinchu County Council, alongside Labor Party veteran Lo Mei-wen. The party won a total of two seats in the county council, representing the townships of Hukou and Xinpu.  Ideology  Although it is nominally socialist, the Labor Party views itself as the ideological successor to the Taiwanese Communist Party. The party opposes the electoral system in Taiwan, calling it \\"bourgeois democracy\\", but participates in elections nonetheless.

The belief that this impact has been dramatic has been largely unchallenged in media theory since its inception. However, there is much dispute as to what those effects are, how serious the ramifications are and if these effects are more or less evolutionary with human communication.  Positive effects of television  =Social surrogacy hypothesis= Current research is discovering that individuals suffering from social isolation can employ television to create what is termed a parasocial or faux relationship with characters from their favorite television shows and movies as a way of deflecting feelings of loneliness and social deprivation. Just as an individual would spend time with a real person sharing opinions and thoughts, pseudo-relationships are formed with TV characters by becoming personally invested in their lives as if they were a close friend so that the individual can satiate the human desire to form meaningful relationships and establish themselves in society. Jaye Derrick and Shira Gabriel of the University of Buffalo, and Kurt Hugenberg of Miami University found that when an individual is not able to participate in interactions with real people, they are less likely to indicate feelings of loneliness when watching their favorite TV show. They refer to this finding as the social surrogacy hypothesis. Furthermore, when an event such as a fight or argument disrupts a personal relationship, watching a favorite TV show was able to create a cushion and prevent the individual from experiencing reduced self-esteem and feelings of inadequacy that can often accompany the perceived threat. By providing a temporary substitute for acceptance and belonging that is experienced through social relationships, TV helps to relieve feelings of depression and loneliness when those relationships are not available. This benefit is considered a positive consequence of watching television, as it can counteract the psychological damage that is caused by isolation from social relationships. = Educational advantages = Several studies have found that educational television has many advantages. The Media Awareness NetworkMedia Awareness Network explains in its article \\"The Good Things about Television\\" that television can be a very powerful and effective learning tool for children if used wisely. The article states that television can help young people discover where they fit into society, develop closer relationships with peers and family, and teach them to understand complex social aspects of communication. Dimitri Christakis cites studies in which those who watched Sesame Street and other educational programs as preschoolers had higher grades, were reading more books, placed more value on achievement and were more creative. Similarly, while those exposed to negative role models suffered, those exposed to positive models behaved better. = Health effects = In the Parent Circle, by PC exclusives, Priscilla J. S. Selvaraj points out several benefits of watching TV on an educational level and on an emotional level. She explains that it can, \\"... be used... both at home as well as in classrooms. With the range of channels on offer, there is no dearth [lack] of educational content.\\" In addition to these benefits watching television brings awareness to their society, and can also help people become bilingual. Because they are learning things outside the classroom, it is making things easier for children inside it. This creates happiness and can raise the energy too. Being energetic and happy allows your body to be more active. More activity makes people healthier. Emotionally, watching television can help strengthen the bond of a family. This being said spending time with family or loved ones can cause your body to release endorphins that can make you happier as well.  Negative effects of television The rich array of pejoratives for television (for example, \\"boob tube\\" and \\"chewing gum for the mind\\" and so forth) indicate a disdain held by many people for this medium. Newton N. Minow spoke of the \\"vast wasteland\\" that was the television programming of the day in his 1961 speech. Complaints about the social influence of television have been heard from the U.S. justice system as investigators and prosecutors decry what they refer to as \\"the CSI syndrome\\". They complain that, because of the popularity and considerable viewership of CSI and its spin-offs, juries today expect to be 'dazzled\\", and will acquit criminals of charges unless presented with impressive physical evidence, even when motive, testimony, and lack of alibi are presented by the prosecution. Television has also been credited with changing the norms of social propriety, although the direction and value of this change are disputed. Milton Shulman, writing about television in the 1960s, wrote that \\"TV cartoons showed cows without udders and not even a pause was pregnant,\\" and noted that on-air vulgarity was highly frowned upon. Shulman suggested that, even by the 1970s, television was shaping the ideas of propriety and appropriateness in the countries the medium blanketed. He asserted that, as a particularly \\"pervasive and ubiquitous\\" medium, television could create a comfortable familiarity with and acceptance of language and behavior once deemed socially unacceptable. Television, as well as influencing its viewers, evoked an imitative response from other competing media as they struggle to keep pace and retain viewer- or readership.Shulman, Milton (1973) The Ravenous Eye, Cassell and Company, p. 277. According to a study published in 2008, conducted by John Robinson and Steven Martin from the University of Maryland, people who are not satisfied with their lives spend 30% more time watching TV than satisfied people do. The research was conducted with 30,000 people during the period between 1975 and 2006. This contrasted with a previous study, which indicated that watching TV was the happiest time of the day for some people. Based on his study, Robinson commented that the pleasurable effects of television may be likened to an addictive activity, producing \\"momentary pleasure but long-term misery and regret.\\" = Psychological effects = In 1989, social psychologist Douglas T. Kenrick demonstrated experimentally that following exposure to photographs or stories about desirable potential mates, human subjects decrease their ratings of commitment to their current partners. Citing Kenrick, in 1994, evolutionary biologist George C. Williams and psychiatrist Randolph M. Nesse observed that television (and other mass communications such as films) were arousing envy by broadcasting the lives of most successful members of society and were causing lower feelings of commitment to spouses as a consequence of the television industry's hiring of physically attractive actors and actresses. In 1955, a majority of U.S. households had at least one television set. From 1960 to 2011, the percentage of all U.S. adults who were married declined from 72 percent to a record low of 51 percent, with the percentage of U.S. adults over the age of 25 who had never married rising to a record high of one-fifth by 2014 and the percentage of U.S. adults living without spouses or partners rising to 42 percent by 2017. One theory says that when a person plays video games or watches TV, the basal ganglia portion of the brain becomes very active and dopamine is released. Some scientists believe that release of high amounts of dopamine reduces the amount of the neurotransmitter available for control of movement, perception of pain and pleasure and formation of feelings.ADHD - ADD Videos Games and TV A study conducted by Herbert Krugman found that in television viewers, the right side of the brain is twice as active as the left side, which causes a state of hypnosis.Moore, W. (2004). Television: Opiate of the Masses. Familyresources.com Research shows that watching television starting at a young age can profoundly affect children's development. These effects include obesity, language delays, and learning disabilities. Physical inactivity while viewing TV reduces necessary exercise and leads to over-eating. Language delays occur when a child doesn't interact with others. Children learn language best from live interaction with parents or other individuals. Resulting learning disabilities from over-watching TV include ADHD, concentration problems and even reduction of IQ. Children who watch too much television can thus have difficulties starting school because they aren't interested in their teachers. Children should watch a maximum of 2 hours daily if any television. Many scientific studies has been published about the embedded use of subliminal messages in songs, video and digital TV, trying to manipulate the choices of watchers and the public opinion. This point of view has hold up some countries to approve law, with the purpose of protecting citizens and their children. = Health effects = Studies in both children and adults have found an association between the number of hours of television watched and obesity. A study found that watching television decreases the metabolic rate in children to below that found in children at rest. Author John Steinbeck describes television watchers: :\\"I have observed the physical symptoms of television-looking on children as well as on adults. The mouth grows slack and the lips hang open; the eyes take on a hypnotized or doped look; the nose runs rather more than usual; the backbone turns to water and the fingers slowly and methodically pick the designs out of brocade furniture. Such is the appearance of semiconsciousness that one wonders how much of the 'message' of television is getting through to the brain.\\"Steinbeck, John. The Reporter, March 10, 1955 The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that children under two years of age should not watch any television and children two and older should watch one to two hours at most. Children who watch more than four hours of television a day are more likely to become overweight. TV watching and other sedentary activities are associated with greater risk of heart attack, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, and death. = Alleged dangers = Legislators, scientists and parents are debating the effects of television violence on viewers, particularly youth. Fifty years of research on the impact of television on children's emotional and social development have not ended this debate. Some scholars have claimed that the evidence clearly supports a causal relationship between media violence and societal violence. However, other authors note significant methodological problems with the literature and mismatch between increasing media violence and decreasing crime rates in the United States. A 2002 article in Scientific American suggested that compulsive television watching, television addiction, was no different from any other addiction, a finding backed up by reports of withdrawal symptoms among families forced by circumstance to cease watching. However, this view has not yet received widespread acceptance among all scholars, and \\"television addiction\\" is not a diagnoseable condition according to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual -IV -TR. A longitudinal study in New Zealand involving 1000 people (from childhood to 26 years of age) demonstrated that \\"television viewing in childhood and adolescence is associated with poor educational achievement by 12 years of age\\". The same paper noted that there was a significant negative association between time spent watching television per day as a child and educational attainment by age 26: the more time a child spent watching television at ages 5 to 15, the less likely they were to have a university degree by age 26. However, recent research (Schmidt et al., 2009) has indicated that, once other factors are controlled for, television viewing appears to have little to no impact on cognitive performance, contrary to previous thought. However, this study was limited to cognitive performance in childhood. Numerous studies have also examined the relationship between TV viewing and school grades. A study published in Sexuality Research and Social Policy concluded that parental television involvement was associated with greater body satisfaction among adolescent girls, less sexual experience amongst both male and female adolescents, and that parental television involvement may influence self- esteem and body image, in part by increasing parent-child closeness. However, a more recent article by Christopher Ferguson, Benjamin Winegard, and Bo Winegard cautioned that the literature on media and body dissatisfaction is weaker and less consistent than often claimed and that media effects have been overemphasized. Similarly recent work by Laurence Steinbrerg and Kathryn Monahan has found that, using propensity score matching to control for other variables, television viewing of sexual media had no impact on teen sexual behavior in a longitudinal analysis. Many studies have found little or no effect of television viewing on viewers (see Freedman, 2002). For example, a recent long-term outcome study of youth found no long-term relationship between watching violent television and youth violence or bullying.\\"Video Games and Youth Violence: A Prospective Analysis in Adolescents\\", Christopher J. Ferguson, Journal of Youth and Adolescence On July 26, 2000 the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association, the American Psychological Association, the American Academy of Family Physicians, and the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry stated that \\"prolonged viewing of media violence can lead to emotional desensitization toward violence in real life.\\" However, scholars have since analyzed several statements in this release, both about the number of studies conducted, and a comparison with medical effects, and found many errors.Block & Crain, 2007; Freedman, 2002 = Propaganda = Television is used to promote commercial, social and political agendas. Public service announcements (including those paid for by governing bodies or politicians), news and current affairs, television advertisements, advertorials and talk shows are used to influence public opinion. The Cultivation Hypothesis suggests that some viewers may begin to repeat questionable or even blatantly fictitious information gleaned from the media as if it were factual. Considerable debate remains, however, whether the Cultivation Hypothesis is well supported by scientific literature, however, the effectiveness of television for propaganda (including commercial advertising) is unsurpassed. The US military and State Department often turn to media to broadcast into hostile territory or nation.\\"Psychological Operations Field Manual No.33-1\\" published in August 1979 by Department of the Army Headquarters in Washington DC; and \\"Psychological Operations (PSYOP) Media Subcourse PO-0816\\" by The Army Institute for Professional Development, published in 1983  Politics  While the effects of television programs depend on what is actually consumed, Neil Postman argues that the dominance of entertaining, but not informative programming, creates a politically ignorant society, undermining democracy: \\"Americans are the best entertained and quite likely the least-informed people in the Western world.\\"Neil Postman. Amusing Ourselves to Death: Public Discourse in the Age of Show Business. Penguin USA, 1985. However, some broadcasters do offer Americans intelligent political narrative and argument. This offers otherwise ignorant viewers, who may not read about politics elsewhere, the opportunity to access current or historical political views, for example. Another interesting facet of the introduction of television to the political scene can be observed in the infamous Kennedy- Nixon presidential debate of 1960. Although the actual influence of television in these debates have been argued over time, the recent studies of James N. Druckman, previous professor at the University of Minnesota, determined that the visually-based television may have allowed viewers to evaluate the candidates more on their image (including perceived personality traits), than previous popular mediums which allowed the transmission of voice alone. Termed \\"viewer-listener\\" disagreement, this phenomenon may still affect the political scene of today.  Gender and television  While women, who were \\"traditionally more isolated than men\\" were given equal opportunity to consume shows about more \\"manly\\" endeavors, men's \\"feminine\\" sides are tapped by the emotional nature of many television programs.Meyrowitz, Joshua (1995) \\"Mediating Communication: What Happens?\\" in John Downing, Ali Mohammadi and Annabelle Sreberny-Mohamadi (eds) Questioning the Media, Sage, Thousand Oaks, pp. 39-53. Television played a significant role in the feminist movement. Although most of the women portrayed on television conformed to stereotypes, television also showed the lives of men as well as news and current affairs. These \\"other lives\\" portrayed on television left many women unsatisfied with their current socialization. The representation of males and females on the television screen has been a subject of much discussion since the television became commercially available in the late 1930s. In 1964 Betty Friedan claimed that \\"television has represented the American Woman as a \\"stupid, unattractive, insecure little household drudge who spends her martyred mindless, boring days dreaming of love‚Äîand plotting nasty revenge against her husband.\\" As women started to revolt and protest to become equals in society in the 1960s and 1970s, their portrayal on the television was an issue that they addressed. Journalist Susan Faludi suggested, \\"The practices and programming of network television in the 1980s were an attempt to get back to those earlier stereotypes of women.\\" Through television, even the most homebound women can experience parts of our culture once considered primarily male, such as sports, war, business, medicine, law, and politics. Since at least the 1990s there has been a trend of showing males as insufferable and possibly spineless fools (e.g. Homer Simpson, Ray Barone). The inherent intimacy of television makes it one of the few public arenas in our society where men routinely wear makeup and are judged as much on their personal appearance and their \\"style\\" as on their \\"accomplishments.\\" From 1930 till today daytime television hasn't changed much. Soap operas and talk shows still dominate the daytime time slot. Primetime television since the 1950s has been aimed at and catered towards males. In 1952, 68% of characters in primetime dramas were male; in 1973, 74% of characters in these shows were male. In 1970 the National Organization for Women (NOW) took action. They formed a task force to study and change the \\"derogatory stereotypes of women on television.\\" In 1972 they challenged the licences of two network-owned stations on the basis of their sexist programming. In the 1960s the shows I Dream of Jeannie and Bewitched insinuated that the only way that a woman could escape her duties was to use magic. Industry analysis Shari Anne Brill of Carat USA states, \\"For years, when men were behind the camera, women were really ditsy. Now you have female leads playing superheroes, or super business women.\\" Current network broadcasting features a range of female portrayals. This is evident in a 2014 study showing that \\"42% of all major characters on television are female\\".BOXED IN: EMPLOYMENT OF BEHIND-THE-SCENES AND ON-SCREEN WOMEN IN 2013-14 PRIME-TIME TELEVISION In August of 2007, television was helping the woman of India by giving them female empowerment. In a Survey from 2001 to 2003, \\"Indian Women don't have a lot of control over their lives. More than half need permission from their husbands to go shopping.\\" India Women were expected to be the traditional house wife that cooked, cleaned, and give birth to many of their kids. But around that time cable television had arrived in Indian villages. One of their most popular shows was where, \\"Their emancipated female characters are well-educated, work outside the home, control their own money, and have fewer children than rural women.\\" The women's attitudes that had access to the television changes profoundly. For example, \\"After a village got cable, women‚Äôs preference for male children fell by 12 percentage points. The average number of situations in which women said that wife beating is acceptable fell by about 10 percent. And the authors‚Äô composite autonomy index jumped substantially, by an amount equivalent to the attitude difference associated with 5.5 years of additional education.\\" By giving India women access to cable television it opened their eyes to see what their life could be like. It is said they should call it the \\"Empowerment Box\\" because of the awareness it brought to their country.  Stereotypes about social class in television  Children watching cartoons on television, circa 2012. Some communications researchers argue that television serves as a developmental tool that teaches viewers about members of the upper, middle, working, and lower-poor classes. Research conducted by Kathleen Ryan and Deborah Macey support this theory by providing evidence collected from ethnographic surveys of television viewers along with critical observational analysis of characters and structure of America's most popular television shows. A limited scope of findings of such studies demonstrate a shared public understanding about social class difference, which were learned through the dialogue and behavior of their favorite on-screen characters. = Television, difference, and identity = Research has been conducted to determine how television informs self-identity while reinforcing stereotypes about culture. Some communication researchers have argued that television viewers have become reliant on prime-time reality shows and sitcoms to understand difference as well as the relationship between television and culture. According to a 2013 study on matriarchal figures on the shows The Sopranos and Six Feet Under, researchers stated that the characters of Carmela Soprano and Ruth Fisher were written as stereotypical non-feminists who rely upon their husbands to provide an upscale lifestyle. They posited that these portrayals served as evidence that the media influences stereotype ideologies about class and stressed the importance of obtaining oral histories from \\"actual mothers, caretakers, and domestic laborers\\" who have never been accurately portrayed. Pop culture researchers have studied the social impacts of popular television shows, arguing that televised competition shows such as The Apprentice send out messages about identity that may cause viewers to feel inadequate. According to Justin Kidd television media perpetuates narrow stereotypes about social classes while also teaching viewers to see themselves as inferior and insufficient due to personal aspects such as \\"race or ethnicity, gender or gender identity, social class, disability or body type, sexuality, age, faith or lack thereof, nationality, values, education, or another other aspect of our identities.\\"  Representation of race in television  Television has effects on society‚Äôs behavior and beliefs by publicizing stereotypes, especially with race. According to research done in 2015 by Dixon on misrepresentation of race in local news, Blacks, in particular, were accurately depicted as perpetrators, victims, and officers. However, although Latinos were accurately depicted as perpetrators, they continued to be underrepresented as victims and officers. Conversely, Whites remained significantly overrepresented as victims and officers.  Diversity and television In 2018, Deadline Hollywood observed that portrayals of diversity, and intersectionality on television had risen, citing a poll about favorite characters and a number of new shows featuring diverse characters.  Technology trends  In its infancy, television was a time-dependent, fleeting medium; it acted on the schedule of the institutions that broadcast the television signal or operated the cable. Fans of regular shows planned their schedules so that they could be available to watch their shows at their time of broadcast. The term appointment television was coined by marketers to describe this kind of attachment. The viewership's dependence on schedule lessened with the invention of programmable video recorders, such as the videocassette recorder and the digital video recorder. Consumers could watch programs on their own schedule once they were broadcast and recorded. More recently, television service providers also offer video on demand, a set of programs that can be watched at any time. Both mobile phone networks and the Internet can give us video streams, and video sharing websites have become popular. In addition, the jumps in processing power within smartphone and tablet devices has facilitated uptake of \\"hybridised\\" TV viewing, where viewers simultaneously watch programs on TV sets and interact with online social networks via their mobile devices. A 2012 study by Australian media company Yahoo!7 found 36% of Australians will call or text family and friends and 41% will post on Facebook while watching TV. Yahoo!7 has already experienced significant early uptake of its Fango mobile app, which encourages social sharing and discussion of TV programs on Australian free-to-air networks. The Japanese manufacturer Scalar has developed a very small TV system attached to eyeglasses, called \\"Teleglass T3-F\\".

Biblio, September 1997. Hoyem's most ambitious project is the Folio Bible, with production extending over several years. This is likely to be the last Bible to be printed from metal type,CAP Online following in the tradition of large-format Bibles printed from movable type that extends from Johannes Gutenberg through John Baskerville, the Doves Press, and the Oxford Lectern Bible, designed by Bruce Rogers. The Christian Science Monitor reported that \\"From melting the lead, to proofreading, to physically lifting 40-pound frames of type, the consensus of Andrew Hoyem, as publisher of the Arion Press, and his small crew of eight craftspeople, is that a hand-wrought Bible is intrinsically valuable‚Äù.Homstrom, David. \\"Making a New Bible the Old Way\\".

In 1989 Arion acquired Mackenzie & Harris, the oldest and largest remaining type foundry in the United States, established with equipment displayed at the Panama-Pacific International Exposition in 1915. In 2000 the future of the type foundry and letterpress operations was threatened by eviction, requiring the logistical challenge and expense of moving over 140 tons of equipment and metal type to a suitable new facility. In response, Hoyem founded the nonprofit Grabhorn Institute to help preserve and continue the operation of one of the last integrated facilities for typefounding, letterpress printing, and bookbinding, developing it as a living museum and educational and cultural center, open to the public, with a gallery and tours as well as an apprenticeship program. The press and foundry relocated to the Presidio of San Francisco as a cultural tenant. In 2000 the hot-metal typecasting and letterpress printing operation was designated by the National Trust for Historic Preservation as part of \\"the nation's irreplaceable historical and cultural legacy\\" under its Save America's Treasures program.\\"Mission & Goals\\", Grabhorn Institute.

The Monastery of Moldovi»õa was built in 1532 by Petru Rare»ô, who was Stephen III of Moldavia's illegitimate son. It was founded as a protective barrier against the Muslim Ottoman conquerors from the East. History Stephen the Great, the King (in Romanian Domnitor) of Moldavia from 1457 until his death in 1504, fought 36 battles against the Ottoman Empire, winning 34 of them. He was very religious and built churches after many victories. Stephen's illegitimate son, Petru Rare»ô, who ruled Moldavia from 1527 to 1538 and again from 1541 to 1546, promoted a new vision for Bukovina churches. He commissioned artists to cover the interiors and exteriors with elaborate frescoes (portraits of saints and prophets, scenes from the life of Jesus). The best preserved are the monasteries in the towns of Sucevi»õa, Moldovi»õa, Vorone»õ, Humor, Suceava, PƒÉtrƒÉu»õi, Arbore and Probota. These eight monasteries‚Äîincluding the Monastery of Moldovi»õa‚Äîwere placed on UNESCO World Heritage list in 1993, as the Painted churches of Moldavia.  Frescoes  Frescoes Frescoes This monastery, built by Voivode Petru Rare»ô, is one of the eight monasteries in Northern Moldavia with frescoes painted on the outer walls. Sister Maika, who has been living in the monastery for more than 50 years, says that it is \\"the holy scriptures in color\\". Moldovi»õa's frescoes were painted by Toma of Suceava in 1537. They are filled with yellow accents and are well preserved. The predominantly yellow- and-blue paintings on its exterior represent recurring themes in Christian Orthodox art: a procession of saints leads up to the Virgin enthroned with the Child in her lap, above the narrow east window; the \\"Tree of Jesse\\" springs from a recumbent Jesse at the foot of the wall to marshal the ancestry of Christ around the Holy Family; The \\"Siege of Constantinople\\" commemorates the intervention of the Virgin in saving the city of Constantinople from Persian attack in A.D. 626 (although the siege depicted is rather the Fall of Constantinople in 1453). Tall arches open the porch to the outside and daylight. Within it, \\"The Last Judgment\\" covers the entire surface of the west wall with its river of fire and its depiction of the sea giving up its dead to judgment. Moldovi»õa and Humor are the last churches built with an open porch, a hidden place above the burial-vault, and with Gothic-style windows and doors.  Trivia  Moldovita on stamp of Romanian post, 1968 The monastery of Moldovi»õa was depicted on a Romanian postage stamp in 1968.

Function  This gene is one member of a family of nuclear RNA export factor genes. Common domain features of this family are a noncanonical RNP-type RNA-binding domain (RBD), 4 leucine-rich repeats (LRRs), a nuclear transport factor 2 (NTF2)-like domain that allows heterodimerization with NTF2-related export protein-1 (NXT1), and a ubiquitin- associated domain that mediates interactions with nucleoporins. Alternative splicing results in transcript variants. The LRRs and NTF2-like domains are required for export activity. The encoded protein of this gene shuttles between the nucleus and the cytoplasm and binds in vivo to poly(A)+ RNA. It is the vertebrate homologue of the yeast protein Mex67p. The encoded protein overcomes the mRNA export block caused by the presence of saturating amounts of CTE (constitutive transport element) RNA of type D retroviruses. A variant allele of the homologous Nxf1 gene in mice suppresses a class of mutations caused by integration of an endogenous retrovirus (intracisternal A particle) into an intron.  Interactions  NXF1 has been shown to interact with TNPO2, MAGOH, U2 small nuclear RNA auxiliary factor 1, DHX9, HuD and NUP214. Tap protein In molecular biology, another name for the protein NXF1 is TAP. In particular this entry focuses on the C-terminal domain, which also contains the UBA(protein domain). This entry contains the NXF family of shuttling transport receptors for nuclear export of mRNA, which include: *vertebrate mRNA export factor TAP or nuclear RNA export factor 1 (NXF1). * Caenorhabditis elegans nuclear RNA export factor 1 (nxf-1). *yeast mRNA export factor MEX67. Members of the NXF family have a modular structure. A nuclear localization sequence and a noncanonical RNA recognition motif (RRM) (see PROSITEDOC) followed by four LRR repeats are located in its N-terminal half. The C-terminal half contains a NTF2 domain (see [href=\\"http://expasy.org/prosite/PDOC50177 PROSITEDOC]) followed by a second domain, TAP-C. The TAP-C domain is important for binding to FG repeat- containing nuclear pore proteins (FG-nucleoporins) and is sufficient to mediate nuclear shuttling. The Tap-C domain is made of four alpha helices packed against each other. The arrangement of helices 1, 2 and 3 is similar to that seen in a UBA fold. and is joined to the next module by flexible 12-residue Pro-rich linker.  Function  Nuclear export of mRNAs is mediated by the Tap protein.  Structure  Tap can form a multimeric complex with itself and with other members of the NXF family. Three functional domains of Tap have been well characterized: the RNA-binding domain, the Nuclear Transport Factor 2 (NTF2)-like domain, and the ubiquitin-associated (UBA) domain.

The sandwiches sold poorly and the entire line was discontinued on August 18, 2000. The Deluxe series was a marketing disaster and is now considered to be one of the most expensive flops in McDonald's history.  History  The line was first introduced in 1991 with the McLean Deluxe; the Arch Deluxe was introduced in May 1996 and the others on September 27, 1996. Except for the McLean Deluxe, all sandwiches were developed by McDonald's executive chef Andrew Selvaggio. = Advertising = McDonald's budgeted at $100‚Äì150 million (USD) for the introduction of the line and contracted the Minneapolis-based ad firm of Fallon McElligott to oversee the roll out of the project. The original advertising for these products took the form of children criticizing the new adult oriented sandwiches and Ronald McDonald doing more adult themed things, such as going dancing or playing golf. The firm went so far as to commission the Columbus, Ohio-based Fahlgren ad firm to create a complete set of music designed specifically for the radio ad campaigns. The new tunes were designed to appeal to an 18- to 34-year-old demographic. Further ads were created by DDB Worldwide. In promotional materials for these products, all employed a similar logo that featured a different color in the background. During this time period, the Crispy Chicken Deluxe and the Fish Filet Deluxe along with the Grilled Chicken Deluxe and the Arch Deluxe were sold only in Canada, the United States, and United States territories, while the McChicken and Filet-O- Fish continued to be sold in the rest of the world. However, by 1998, the Crispy Chicken Deluxe and Grilled Chicken Deluxe were renamed the \\"Crispy Chicken Sandwich\\" and \\"Chicken McGrill\\" respectively, while the Fish Filet Deluxe and Arch Deluxe sandwiches were being increasingly discontinued at more locations throughout 1998 and 1999, until the Fish Filet Deluxe and Arch Deluxe were finally taken off the menus on August 18, 2000. Product variants All sandwiches were served on a bakery style roll and featured better quality ingredients, such as whole leaf lettuce and sliced tomatoes. =Burgers= * The McLean Deluxe was marketed as a healthy alternative to McDonald's regular menu. It was released in the United States in 1991. It had a reduced fat content compared to other McDonald's hamburgers. This was achieved through use of 91% lean beef and the addition of carrageenan to the meat. The McLean Deluxe was originally designed as a replacement of the McDLT. Like the McDLT, and despite performing well in taste-tests, it did not sell well and was dropped from the menu in February 1996. * The Arch Deluxe was another product to compete against the Burger King Whopper sandwich. It had hickory bacon, onions, tomato, ketchup, lettuce, American cheese, and a mustard and mayonnaise based Chef's sauce. =Chicken= * The Grilled Chicken Deluxe sandwich replaced the McGrilled Chicken Classic sandwich and had light mayonnaise, lettuce and tomatoes; additional sauces to replace the mayo were available. Additionally, a Crispy Chicken Deluxe sandwich, which replaced the McChicken, was made available. These sandwiches were targeted to the female and health conscious markets. The Grilled Chicken Deluxe and Crispy Chicken Deluxe sandwiches were brought back in 2015. This time, they are made on an artisan roll instead of the potato flour bun and replaced the Premium Chicken sandwich line instead of the McChicken. =Fish= * The Fish Filet Deluxe replaced the Filet-O-Fish sandwich and had tartar sauce, American cheese and lettuce. The fish patty was 50% larger than the original fish fillet used in the Filet-O-Fish. After the Fish Filet Deluxe was dropped, the larger fish patty was used in the current Filet-O-Fish. Despite failing eighteen years prior in North America, McDonald's New Zealand introduced in 2015 a nearly identical sandwich (adding a tomato slice and with two fish filets and a seedless bun instead of the potato flour bun) called the Seaside Fish Burger.

Mitofusins are GTPases embedded in the outer membrane of the mitochondria. In mammals MFN1 and MFN2 are essential for mitochondrial fusion. In addition to the mitofusins, OPA1 regulates inner mitochondrial membrane fusion, and DRP1 is responsible for mitochondrial fission.  Function  Mitofusin-2 is a mitochondrial membrane protein that participates in mitochondrial fusion and contributes to the maintenance and operation of the mitochondrial network. Mitochondria function as a dynamic network constantly undergoing fusion and fission. The balance between fusion and fission is important in maintaining the integrity of the mitochondria and facilitates the mixing of the membranes and the exchange of DNA between mitochondria. MFN1 and MFN2 mediate outer membrane fusion while OPA1 is involved in inner membrane fusion. Mitochondrial fusion is essential for embryonic development. Knockout mice for either MFN1 or MFN2 have fusion deficits and die midgestation. MFN2 knockout mice die at embryonic day 11.5 due to a defect in the giant cell layer of the placenta. Fusion is also important for mitochondrial transport and localization in neuronal processes. Conditional MFN2 knockout mice show degeneration in the Purkinje cells of the cerebellum, as well as improperly localized mitochondria in the dendrites. MFN2 also associates with the MIRO-Milton complex which links the mitochondria to the kinesin motor.  Clinical significance  Mutations of the gene are implicated in Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease. Charcot- Marie-Tooth disease type 2A (CMT2A) is caused by mutations in the MFN2 gene. While the symptoms of CMT2A are variable they are characterized by a sometimes early onset, severe phenotype, and optic atrophy. Mutations in OPA1 also cause optic atrophy, which suggests a common role of mitochondrial fusion in neuronal dysfunction. The exact mechanism of how mutations in MFN2 selectively cause the degeneration of long peripheral axons is not known. There is evidence suggesting that it could be due to defects in the axonal transport of mitochondria. The MFN2 protein may play a role in the pathophysiology of obesity. Mitochondria arrest fusion by downregulating Mfn2 in obesity and diabetes, which leads to a fragmented mitochondrial network. This fragmentation is obvious in the pancreatic beta-cells in the Islets of Langerhans and can inhibit mitochondrial quality control mechanisms such as mitophagy and autophagy - leading to a defect in insulin secretion and eventual beta-cell failure. The expression of MFN2 in skeletal muscle is proportional to insulin sensitivity in this tissue, and its expression is reduced in high-fat diet fed mice and Zucker fatty rats. This protein is involved in the regulation of vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation.

He was drafted by the Philadelphia Eagles in the seventh round of the 2010 NFL Draft. He played college football at Ohio State. Early years Coleman graduated from Northmont High School in Clayton, Ohio in 2006. He was ranked 14th at the position of cornerback according to scout.com for 2006. College career Coleman played college football at Ohio State. At a spring practice during his first year, Coleman tackled wide receiver Tyson Gentry. Gentry became paralyzed. Coleman almost quit the football team before Gentry forgave him during a hospital visit. In 2009, Coleman made 68 tackles, five interceptions and three forced fumbles. He earned first-team All-American honors by Sporting News and first-team All-Big Ten honors. Professional career =Philadelphia Eagles= The Philadelphia Eagles selected Coleman in the seventh round (244th overall) of the 2010 NFL Draft. He was the 18th safety selected and the second safety drafted by the Eagles in 2010. 2010 On June 3, 2010, the Philadelphia Eagles signed Coleman to a four-year, $1.83 million contract that also includes a signing bonus of $43,400. Throughout training camp, Coleman competed against Nate Allen and Quintin Demps to be the starting free safety after Marlin Jackson ruptured his Achilles tendon. On September 2, 2010, Coleman recorded five combined tackles and returned two fumble recoveries for touchdowns in the Eagles' 21‚Äì17 loss to the New York Jets in their fourth preseason game. Head coach Andy Reid named Coleman the backup safety to begin the regular season, behind starters Nate Allen and Quintin Mikell. He made his professional regular season debut in the Philadelphia Eagles' season-opener against the Green Bay Packers and recorded two solo tackles in their 27‚Äì20 loss. He made his first career tackle on wide receiver Jordy Nelson during a 27-yard kick return by Nelson in the first quarter. On November 7, 2010, Coleman collected three combined tackles in the Eagles' 26‚Äì24 victory against the Indianapolis Colts. During the second quarter, Coleman received a penalty for unnecessary roughness after he was part of a helmet-to-helmet collision with wide receiver Austin Collie. The hit rendered Collie unconscious and he was immediately carted off the field and was later diagnosed with a concussion. NFL commissioner Roger Goodell chose not to fine Coleman for the hit. In Week 10, Coleman earned his first career start in place of Nate Allen who was inactive due to an injury. He made five combined tackles, deflected a pass, and made his first career interception off a pass by quarterback Donovan McNabb during a 59‚Äì28 win at the Washington Redskins. On December 20, 2010, it was reported that Coleman would assume the starting free safety role after Nate Allen sustained a season-ending knee injury against the New York Giants the previous week. In Week 16, he made his second career start and collected a season-high seven solo tackles in a 24‚Äì14 loss to the Minnesota Vikings. Coleman was inactive for Eagles' Week 17 loss to the Dallas Cowboys after head coach Andy Reid opted to rest him for the playoffs. He finished his rookie season with 36 combined tackles (31 solo), two pass deflections, and an interception in 15 games and two starts. The Philadelphia Eagles finished first in the NFC East with a 10‚Äì6 record. On January 9, 2011, Coleman started in his first career playoff game and recorded seven combined tackles during a 21‚Äì16 loss to the eventual Super Bowl XLV Champions, the Green Bay Packers in the NFC Wildcard Game. 2011 Coleman entered training camp slated as the starting free safety after Quintin Mikell departed for the St. Louis Rams in free agency. Defensive coordinator Juan Castillo held a competition to name a new starting free safety between Coleman and rookie Jaiquawn Jarrett. Coleman was officially named the starter at free safety, alongside Nate Allen, to begin the regular season. He started in the Philadelphia Eagles' season-opener at the St. Louis Rams and recorded four solo tackles in their 31‚Äì13 victory. In Week 3, Coleman was benched during a 29‚Äì16 loss to the New York Giants. Head coach Andy Reid played Jarrad Page in his place and he remained the starter ahead of Coleman for the next two games (Weeks 4‚Äì5). Coleman received his starting job back in Week 6 after Page was inactive for three games (Weeks 6‚Äì8) due to an injury. On October 16, 2011, Coleman collected seven combined tackles, deflected three passes, and intercepted three passes by quarterback Rex Grossman in the Eagles' 20‚Äì13 win at the Washington Redskins in Week 6. He was the first Eagles player since 1966 to have three interceptions in one game. His performance helped snap a four-game losing streak and earned him NFC Defensive Player of the Week. In Week 9, he collected a season-high 12 combined tackles (ten solo) during a 30‚Äì24 loss to the Chicago Bears. On November 27, 2011, Coleman made a season-high 11 solo tackles and assisted on a tackle in a 38‚Äì20 loss to the New England Patriots in Week 12. On December 28, 2011, the Philadelphia Eagles placed Coleman on injured reserve due to a biceps injury he sustained during a Week 16 win at the Dallas Cowboys. Coleman finished his second season with 78 combined tackles (56 solo), five pass deflections, and four interceptions in 15 games and 13 starts. 2012 Throughout training camp, Coleman competed against O. J. Atogwe and Jaiquawn Jarrett to maintain his job as the Eagles' starting free safety. Head coach Andy Reid named Coleman and Allen the starting safety duo to begin the 2012 regular season. He started in the Philadelphia Eagles' season-opener at the Cleveland Browns and recorded five solo tackles, two pass deflections, and intercepted two passes by quarterback Brandon Weeden in the Eagles' 17‚Äì16 victory. In Week 3, he collected a season-high nine combined tackles and broke up a pass during a 27‚Äì6 loss at the Arizona Cardinals. On October 16, 2012, the Philadelphia Eagles fired defensive coordinator Juan Castillo and promoted their coach of the secondary, Todd Bowles. On October 28, 2012, Coleman collected a season-high eight solo tackles in the Eagles' 30‚Äì17 loss to the Atlanta Falcons in Week 8. In Week 13, Coleman made five combined tackles before exiting the Eagles' 38‚Äì33 loss at the Dallas Cowboys after suffering an injury to his chest. It was later discovered to be a bruised sternum and Coleman was sidelined for the next two games (Weeks 14‚Äì15). On December 31, 2012, it was announced that the Philadelphia Eagles had fired head coach Andy Reid after they finished fourth in the NFC East with a 4‚Äì12 record. He finished the season with 93 combined tackles (70 solo), four pass deflections, an interception, and a forced fumble in 14 games and 14 starts. 2013 Coleman participated in an open competition held by defensive coordinator Billy Davis to name two new starting safeties. During training camp, he competed against Kenny Phillips, Patrick Chung, Colt Anderson, Dave Sims, Nate Allen, and rookies Jordan Poyer and Earl Wolff. Head coach Chip Kelly named Coleman the backup free safety to begin the regular season, behind Patrick Chung. In Week 8, Coleman collected a season-high four combined tackles during a 48‚Äì20 win at the Oakland Raiders. He was sidelined for the Eagles' Week 16 victory against the Chicago Bears after straining his hamstring the previous week. Coleman finished his fourth season with 15 combined tackles (14 solo) in 15 games and zero starts. The Philadelphia Eagles finished first in the NFC East with a 10‚Äì6 record in their first season under head coach Chip Kelly. On January 4, 2014, Coleman made one tackle in the Eagles' 26‚Äì24 loss to the New Orleans Saints in the NFC Wildcard Game. 2014 Coleman became an unrestricted free agent after the 2014 season.

It includes the company's larger chicken sandwiches, its salad line, and its coffee products. The sandwiches are targeted at various demographic markets, the grilled chicken sandwiches and salads are targeted at both the female and health- conscious demographic markets. The entire line is intended to bring in a larger, more affluent, adult audience seeking better quality products. Sandwiches McDonald's line of larger chicken sandwiches (The Classic, Club and Ranch BLT)According to the option listing at the McDonald's Website . were introduced in July 2005 as part of McDonald's menu revamp. The classic includes Lettuce, Tomato, and Mayo. The Club also has Lettuce Tomato and Mayo, but also comes with Swiss cheese and bacon. The ranch BLT comes with a creamy ranch sauce, Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato. All three can be chosen with either buttermilk crispy or grilled chicken and all are served on a honey wheat roll. A Spicy Chicken sandwich, with chipotle spices in the breading, was part of the premium line for a limited time in 2006. It was made the same way as a Classic, but with ranch instead of mayo. The spicy Chicken was brought back temporarily in late 2008, but it was not part of the premium line. In 2011, the honey wheat roll for the sandwiches was replaced with a whole grain bakery style bun to make the sandwiches \\"more neutral\\" in flavor. The entire Premium Chicken sandwich line was replaced in 2015 by the Crispy Chicken Deluxe (in August renamed the Buttermilk Crispy Chicken Sandwich) and the Grilled Chicken Deluxe, two sandwiches that were part of the ill-fated Deluxe sandwich line in 1996 and have been slightly reformulated, meaning that they are now served on artisan rolls. Salads The Premium product line in the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom includes McDonald's salad products. First introduced in March 2003, the salads all are a mixture of iceberg lettuce and a lettuce assortment (romaine, etc.), with cherry tomatoes and different toppings to differentiate them; Each salad is sold plain or topped with either a grilled or crispy chicken patty which has been chopped and added to the salad just prior to selling. The line includes varieties of Newman's Own salad dressing that are tailored for each type of salad. The line includes: * Southwest Salad - chili-lime flavored tortilla strips, black beans, roasted tomatoes, poblano peppers, and fire-roasted corn, a lime wedge and a cilantro- lime glaze for the chicken served with a \\"southwest\\" dressing; * Bacon Ranch Salad - bacon bits, Cheddar cheese and Monterey Jack cheese served with ranch dressing; * Grilled Chicken Caesar Salad - chicken breast, Cheddar cheese, and Monterey Jack cheese served with a creamy caesar dressing. * Fruit & Walnut Salad - candied walnuts, low-fat yogurt, and red and green apple slices with red seedless grapes. * Fiesta Salad - warm seasoned beef, cheddar jack cheese, and crispy tortilla strips served with all natural chunky salsa. * The Asian Salad - mandarin oranges, red peppers, edamame, snow peas, and an orange glaze for the chicken served with low fat sesame ginger dressing. Additional dressing flavors offered include a low fat Italian dressing and low fat balsamic vinaigrette. Chicken Selects The advertising for its chicken strips product has been modified so that the word Premium appears in its description in its print, online and broadcast media. The word is capitalized, which indicates its association with the line. McDonald's stopped selling chicken selects in 2013, but they were brought back for a limited time promotion in March 2015 to combat McDonald's low sales. Beverages In the United States McDonald's has upgraded its coffee line. In the Northeastern States coffee is sold under the Newman's Own brand. In 2007 McDonald's expanded the Premium coffee line to include flavored iced coffee. In 2008-2009 it was expanded once more to lattes, cappuccinos and mochas in the North American market.

Synopsis A famous writer, Lee Joon-seop, returns to his hometown to attend his mother's funeral. Lee's illegitimate niece, who has been ostracized from the family, has also returned home for the funeral. While the funeral ceremonies take place, various old family conflicts reassert themselves. During the action of the story, a parallel children's story written by Lee is read by the illegitimate niece. The story describes a grandmother who gives her life force to her growing granddaughter, resulting in the grandmother becoming gradually younger until she reverts into an infant and finally leaves for the next world. Director's statement \\"In a sense, the life we enjoy now is the result of how our ancestors have lived. The [preceding] generations are bound to leave their legacy to the following generations-parents to their children, teachers to their students, and seniors to their juniors. Even a person who seems to lead an independent life by and of himself is strongly influenced by his ancestors. I see the entire process as tremendously beautiful and sincerely dream to show the viewers of my movie the true sense of this ongoing phenomenon. A funeral serves as the starting point for this movie. The funeral is for a warm-hearted eighty-seven-year-old lady who had strived to help those in need throughout her life. Through the motif of the funeral, the most extensively scaled ceremony in life, I have tried to explore the meaning of death and its effects shadowing the bereaved. I have also tried to bring to light the sentiments of the survivors: their sorrow, egoism, solemnity and even frivolity. I want to give the viewers who see this film a moment to think about what is truly valuable and precious in our quickly changing world. At this moment, I consider this goal my duty as a director..\\" \\\\-- Im Kwon-taek Reception During the 2000 Inter-Korean summit, North Korean leader, Kim Jong-il specifically mentioned Festival along with Im Kwon- taek's earlier Chunhyang (2000) as models of the type of cinematic works on which the two Koreas could work together.
